“Harpies,” Steve gave a short reply before moving towards the closest tree and climbing up to attempt to locate the group of flying harpies who had taken Tony. It was a slim chance but Steve took it anyway climbing over the trees and seeing the horizon from above. Steve was thankful that the trees in this forest were abnormally tall and reached almost unnatural heights.
“What’s the year?” Tony asked not looking at the woman.
“Yeah,” Steve spoke a little breathless, “not like I planned on winning...you know my luck isn’t so great Buck.”
It rung a few times and each one made Tony’s resolve waver but just as he was about to hang up he paused as he heard the line get picked up. Tony stayed silent waiting as if trying to reassure himself that it was the one person he wanted to hear on the other end.
“Please, calm down,” Stane tried but the people roared more loudly and it looked like Stane was not taking it well. Steve noticed armed harpies making a semi-circle in front of Stane and Steve worried that they would harm the innocents who had come looking for council in their leader. Steve turned to look at Tony and knew he thought the same thing, those armed harpies were not going to have the chance to hurt anyone.
It was Rhodey’s sister who noticed them first. She paused in her work on the small part of the farm they still used to stare openly in their direction. As if she by instinct without turning away she patted her mother on the back. Mama Rhodes looked up annoyed about to berate her youngest daughter only to follow her sight to spot papa Rhodes. The sight of her fidgeting excitedly with tears in her eyes before rushing over to her husband and alpha warmed Tony’s heart. Papa Rhodes let go of his son to rush towards her with open arms taking her all in as she wrapped her arms around him in glee. Papa Rhodes twisted her in the air the best he could showering her in kisses and whispers of ‘I love you’.
Steve
Steve shrugged, recovering.  “The first time I met you was in a hotel bar close to midnight and I didn’t even recognize you.  The second time I schooled you at fancy nightclub golf. So...no?”
The spotlight flashed on, she turned on bright media smile and started speaking.  “So, Steve, congratulations on this win. What were your thoughts in that final minute?”
He stared at Steve for another second then closed the lid on his dinner and got up to stash it in the fridge.  He came back with a smaller container with a pair of cannoli in it.  He waggled the box at Steve.  “Happy early birthday.”
“Not in the last week, so thank you.”  She dropped her phone into her purse. “Let’s roll, Rogers.”
re: Welcome Home
When they made it back to the locker room, Fitz dragged Steve with him into the training room to talk strategy while one of the trainers iced his knee and injected him with an anti-inflammatory.
“Hell yeah it is,” Tony crowed just before the line went dead.
“You look like you’ve been rode hard and put away wet,” Bucky said as he flopped on the grass next to Steve and passed over a bottle of water.  “Have fun?”
Sam just fixed him with a Look.  “And how does a motorcycle show help us do that?”
“Oh for sure,” she nodded.  “He’s really well trained.”
Steve grinned back.  “Fair.  Just because the world knows you’re Iron Man, you can’t give away all your secrets, I guess.”
Steve gasped as Tony swallowed him to the root, his hands tight on Steve’s hips.  Steve writhed down into the tight, wet heat of Tony’s mouth and the teasing swirl of his calloused fingers in the creases of his hips.
Sharon Carter smiled blandly up at him.  “Well, obviously, at a certain point we can’t help who we fall in love with, but you always want to be conscious of who you’re allowing into your personal life.  You don’t want your narrative off the field to overshadow your narrative on the field.”
“You gonna let me flick your switch?” Tony mumbled against his lips when they parted for air.
Okay, so you know that fic writer meme that's been making the rounds recently on the Tumblr about AO3 authors are like "hey, sorry for the short update, but I'm working  full time and my dog died and I ran away, but here's this."  I laughed the first time I saw it, but y'all, I'm sorry for the long wait and the short update, but apart from the running away, this has been my life.  I wish I was kidding.
Tony nodded.  “You’re sorry you said it.  I’m sorry for making you feel like shit over something little.  Fair enough?”
“What’s goin’ on with you and Stark?”
“Didn’t feel that way,” Steve muttered.  The feel of that final play still clung to his legs, to his arms.  Making his hands and feet feel slippery and untrustworthy.
.”  He tried to explain.  “Everybody’s straight.”
Extra special thanks this week to Starksnack for wandering through this chapter and pointing at stuff and saying "what's that?" so I knew what to put in the support document.
Bucky nodded.  “Good.”
Tony nodded.  “Just...anticipation of what’s coming.”
“Oh I did that too,” Tony nodded proudly.  “Jarvis, our butler when I was younger, he was a Jets fan, and when the old owner said he was interested in selling, I found myself interested in buying.”
She turned back to face where he still stood framed in the hotel door.  “Shoot.”
“Facing you or not?” she asked as she started running the tiny disposable razor over the inside of his throwing arm.
“Bucky texted
Carla shook her head down at Steve’s chest.  “I figured out right quick with my Raul that there’s never a simple answer to that question.”  She smiled fondly.  “But sometimes love shouldn’t be examined like a balance sheet.”
“Why did you decide to draft a quarterback in the first round when you have Fitzsimmons signed already?” a man from ESPN asked.
Steve nodded, humbled by Tony’s faith in him.  “But what if--”
Author’s Notes:
Sam nodded.  “So you’ve lost before.”
As Rich Eisen announced that Cincinnati was on the clock, Steve finally spotted Sam sitting a few tables away and caught his eye to wave.  Sam waved back, grinning at him.
By the time Steve made it downstairs, Sam had already packed their meat, the potato salad he’d made from his mom’s secret recipe, and their beer into a cooler.  “I think we can fit two bags of ice on top of this,” he said pointing at the empty space on top of their food.
“Can I help you?” Red asked from his spot perched behind the counter.
The Bengals didn’t even take their full ten minutes to announce they were taking Joe Bush, and as he made his way to shake hands with the owner and brand new head coach, Steve leaned over and murmured to Natasha, “He’s going to have his work cut out for him.”
Steve elbowed him, laughing.  “You try saying no the first time a kid talks to you like that.”
“Anything’s fine,” Steve answered.  He tugged the cover back down over the Indian then turned to Tony with a smile.  “Today’s my cheat day, so I’m only bound to a calorie count.”
Steve made it to the stage where the three biggest names in the Avengers organization were waiting to shake his hand.  Head coach Nick Fury stepped forward first and clasped his hand. “Rogers, we’re pleased you’re going to be joining us.”
~~*~~
She laughed.  “Smooth, Rogers.  You’ll go far with lines like that.”  She pulled a folder with his name on it out of her bag.  “Quick bit of business, then I’ll get out of your hair.”
Steve nodded.  “I think so.  We doing the mile and a half or the 5K loop?”
He wrapped a hand around Tony’s leaking cock.  “Wanna be yours,” he managed, stroking Tony firmly.
“Plus, there’s more of an expectation of stand-up behavior here than in college,” Fitz had followed Clint’s daughter over and taken up a spot leaning against the back of Clint’s chair.  “You’re all out there to get paid.  Unless you’re a raging bag of dicks--”
“Why’d you buy a whole football team?”
“You’d trust public parking with one of your cars?” Steve asked, incredulous.
She whipped back around and reached through the metal barricade and caught the leg of his pants.  “Thank you, Mr. Steve. Good luck this year.”
“Yeah, but then the police would be involved anyway,” Steve finished for her.
At the bottom of the heap, Miller and Fitz were both huddled around the ball, but when Miller stood up, Fitz did not.  He curled in on himself then completely stopped moving.  In that split second, the sideline exploded into motion.  The trainers were three steps onto the field when Bucky grabbed Steve’s arm and a ball and dragged him behind the benches.
Steve shrugged.  “It’s not the end of the world.  I didn’t like the all-black tires that much anyway.”
“Jesus,” Steve mumbled as his face flamed bright red again.
.”  The note of disbelief in Sam’s voice grew.
“Mmm, Tony’s just fine,” Tony hummed against the skin of his stomach.
After bolting his food, Steve forced himself to ignore the little red number on his text app and instead dialled Natasha.  Best to get this over with, whatever she’d have to say.
When his phone went off twice in rapid succession, Steve finally set down the screwdriver and directions and grabbed his phone off the dock.
Over half an hour later, Sharon finally stepped in to wrap up the postgame presser.  She thanked Steve for his time as he escaped the podium and the whole press room.  He didn’t think there were so many ways to ask the same handful of questions.  Repeatedly.  He supposed each outlet didn’t really want to run the quote someone else had gotten, but he could only say “we’re hoping for a quick, full recovery, but we have to wait for what the doctors say” so many different ways.
“Not anymore,” Tony said.  “Even if they could remove it, there’s too much scarring on my heart and my lungs have been permanently altered.  I never realized how tightly packed and finely tuned the human torso is until I had to jam a cylinder through my breastbone.”
Fury appearing on the other side of Steve’s locker paused their conversation.  “Gentlemen, if you would get changed and get into medical or the cafeteria, we’re going to be starting promptly at one.”  Fury turned his focus on Steve.  “Rogers, if you could come with me?”
“Just do you,” he muttered to himself as he was brushing his teeth.
“I guess everything really is bigger in Texas.”  He winked at Steve. “Including egos.”
Steve nodded and hung his bag in his locker without bothering to change.  He thought the notes he’d gotten from Fury that morning had been positive, but maybe they’d been looking for him to do more.  Be better.  He looked at Bucky for an answer, but Bucky just shrugged helplessly at him.
Dallas snapped, Steve touched his knee to the turf, and the celebration was on.
“He can swear all he wants, but it’s actions in the locker room and on the field that matter,” Steve said.
I owe a tremendous debt of gratitude to my American Folklore professor from grad school because I used the transcription skills I learned in his course to get the lyrics to the Monday Night Football song right (or as right as I could).  I’m using the 2018 version that featured Florida Georgia Line and Jason Derulo because it could exist in any season.  The 2019 lyrics could not.  Plus...unpopular opinion time...I liked the 2018 opener.  I know a lot of folks didn’t really like the addition of two, more contemporary (less dickbag-ish), artists, but I liked them.  They brought some snap (HA) with the way ESPN decided to remix the music.
Steve nodded.
Fury emptied the backfield and stacked the receiving corps in preparation for a long bomb.  On the other side of the field, Schmidt backed up his defensive secondary and spread them out, so they were all ready to cover deep routes.
“That’s good to hear.”  Sharon turned her attention back to her laptop, clicking around to pull up whatever she needed.  “Okay, so, I’m sure you’ve been hearing from other people the point of this sit-down.  We want to take some time to get to know you.  Both for us so we can do our job, and for our fans and media partners who are very anxious to get to know their new Avengers.”
~~*~~
Working his ass off already.  Good guy.
“Okay, Grandpa Rogers” they both agreed as they dissolved into helpless laughter.  Steve just shook his head and smiled; their familiar jibes well-worn and comfortable.
“Exactly.”  Tony rolled over and faced Steve, making him smile sadly.  “And I don’t want to hide from people I consider my friends.  I don’t.  But I can’t--I
Phillips huffed a laugh.  “You’re not wrong.”
My intention is not to go a whole-ass month between updates again.  I'm catching the rhythm of my new hybrid work sitch, so I don't get home so tired all I can do is stare at the Astros games then stumble to bed when my "go to sleep, jackass" alarm goes on my phone.
“Okay…” Tony dragged the word out, clearly trying to lift Steve’s thoughts straight out of his brain.
He turned to look at the selection of clubs, letting Tony have his secrets.  God only knew he had enough of his own. “Now how does this work?”
The trek down to lunch wasn’t far, and Scott attached himself to Steve and Sam, content to fill the space between them with good-natured chatter as they walked.  Once they’d found a table, Steve pushed his food around on his plate, hoping no one would notice he didn’t have much of an appetite.
Steve nodded back.  “I took the bike off the lift stand after I’d spent a day just trying to figure out what I was up against, and it slipped and hit the ground hard enough that the back tire just split where the radial meets the sidewall.”
She smiled.  “Strategic decision making.  Abraham was willing to take a chance on an immigrant’s kid, but in an old boy’s club like the NFL, Kansas plays better than Kremlin.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Who’re we lookin’ out for?” Clint asked from across the yard.
“T’tan’um c’rb’d,” Tony slurred, mostly asleep.
“Never any doubt,” Steve repeated.
A soft chime from Steve’s pocket made Tony sit up.  “Text from your other date?”
“Full name. Sign, print, date and date,” she confirmed, pointing at each line.
Steve winked at Tony over the top of the handlebars.  “This is why I like you.”
“I feel like I should be asking you that,” Steve replied.  “You need a hand?”
Jamaal, Steve’s favorite running back, caught his eye across the huddle and pursed his lips in an exaggerated kiss.  Steve choked on the drink of water he’d just taken as he started laughing.
.  What a sweet young man. #IKnewHimWhen
Steve sighed.  He reached into his pocket and pulled out a small brass compass and passed it over.  He watched Natasha turn it over in her hands before unclasping the cover and flipping it open.  A woman with blonde hair styled in soft curls smiled up from the inside of the compass casing.
“Locker,” he muttered to himself, turning towards the locker room, anxious to get out of the sweaty clothes that had dried on him.
“What’s happening to the baby quarterback?” Bucky demanded as he trotted over from his car to join them on their way to the locker room.  He threw an arm around Steve’s neck.  “Good show on Sunday, by the way.”
Steve shot Tony a sideways smile.  “Sure. I outscored you by what? Close to 200 points?”
“You need a little something to cut the sweet,” he said with a smirk.
“Coach?” he asked as he trotted over to the sideline.  “I know it looked messy, but we had the route--”
“Let’s go, then.”  Tony looped his arm through Steve’s elbow and steered them towards the pedestrian bridge.
She came at him wielding a half-empty tube of Aquaphor, dabbed a bit onto the fresh work, then taped down a stretch of plastic wrap over it.  “Good.  Now, shirt off and lay back,” she ordered.
“Except that random undrafted free agent who’s trying to avoid practice squad or waivers,” Bucky pointed out.  He leaned back and grinned at Steve.  “You’ll have a front row seat to all this since you’ll probably get to play most of the games.  Fitzy’ll do a series or two, get the cobwebs loose, then Fury’ll stick you in.  He might bring you out to let Bradley run a series if we’re way up or way down.”
Tony squeezed his hand.  “Let’s get out of here.”
Steve heard Bucky smack his hand on his forehead before looking over to see Bucky’s head leaning into his open palm shaking his head, “you are such a dumbass! You do this to yourself. Go talk to him you big punk!”
“This is the first time someone has given me something for me,” Tony spoke softly, “always given things so that other people could get what they wanted. It’s...it’s...this is amazing.”
Finally, the truck came to a halt and Steve heard noises as the driver talked to someone who seemed to have stopped them. Steve looked through the little flap to see nothing but plain grasslands and trees. It was an isolated place, his camp, and he felt a bit nervous. He never left New York in his life. This was new and he was essentially alone. A part of him wished he had stayed in New York but a larger part of him said that he needed to do this. He never really knew why but he just knew that he was meant to be a soldier. To fight in this war.
“We got a long day ahead of us for travel. The city of Brook will be in our sights by sunset,” Steve informed Tony as he forced himself to get out of the comfortable spot he was in. He could still feel the warmth of Tony against his side and it was a wonderful feeling.
“Who is this prince you speak of Sir Happy so we may aid in locating him for you,” Thor asked and Steve was too lost in thought about this revelation. It seemed that the situation got ten times worse. Steve had heard of the wayward Harpy prince who ran away from home because he couldn’t take the responsibility of being king. At the time he had been angered about hearing about the story but now…now he knew better.
“Yeah all those sleepless nights spent running on those treadmills finally did me some good,” Steve replied trying to keep the atmosphere light until they got to the diner. He didn’t want Tony running away just yet.
“You know if you are here to beat me up do not expect to me to just lay down and take it,” Steve growled shoving his hands in his pocket to make him look unimpressed. The man was tall and wore a long trench coat with a fedora. He was totally unrecognizable in this get up and lighting. Steve hated fighting opponents that refused to show him their face. The man stepped forward as if to engage only to back up at hearing a shout from the direction of the bar. Steve knew it was Bucky. The distraction of his friend turning the corner was all the stranger needed to disappear from Steve’s presence. Annoyed, Steve just punched the brick wall instead.
Being who he was, Tony did what he usually did in any situation, and tried to move and get a better assessment of where he was. The moment he began to squirm, the arms around his waist tightened and a tired grumbly voice spoke up behind him, “It’s Sunday sweetheart. You promised no getting up until past noon.”
Tony gasped and writhed, tightening his grip in Steve’s hair in desperation to keep himself from exploding too early. He didn’t want this to end just as it started.
Steve almost didn’t believe him but if Tony said they were good then he will take his word for it. He will, though, watch the group like a hawk until they prove themselves not to be a danger or threat to Tony or the rest of the team.
He hoped it would.
After a while of sitting around the fire, Steve felt a soft press against his side and he looked down to see Tony’s head resting against his shoulder as he fell asleep by the campfire. Steve was tempted to comb his fingers through Tony’s feathers. He looked up instead and spotted both Sam and Bucky sitting across from him with knowing smirks on their faces. The fuckers. Steve wanted to wipe their looks off their faces. Instead he just felt his face heating up. Damn his pale complection.
“I am good and safe in the city. It is you who need to stay safe Nomad,” Dum Dum replied forcing Steve into another hug. Steve just hugged his old friend one last time before heading back to his apartment.
Pepper stared worried as she looked for indecision in Tony’s eyes. There was none. And so she nodded. That was now the start of it all. That nod. Steve could feel the change in atmosphere. Tony seemed to lose the little quirky side that he loved so much and grew serious. It was terrifying to watch since Steve could feel Tony radiating command and power within a moment. Tony was raised as a prince and as the future ruler of his people, he probably had to learn this kind of skills early. Steve was willing to do anything Tony needed to achieve his new goal.
gave him after his fights but it did not come. Perturbed Steve looked up to see Bucky looking back into the alley way angrily. For the first time Bucky was not angry with him. Maybe because it was the first time Steve did not start the fight.
“I did no such thing,” Tony bowed and turned to leave, “good day your highness.”
“Tiring,” Steve shrugged still not giving anything away. Tony just quietly sat next to him holding a cup of what Steve figured was Clint's disgusting drink he tries to pass as coffee.
It felt significant. Her words. They resonated within him.
Steve stopped dead in his tracks in shock never expecting to hear those words she just spoke to him. It took him only a second to change direction and head towards the center. Steve knew exactly where it was. He ran by it a lot wondering if this was the day and somehow it never occurred to him that it would actually happen.
Instead he settled for saying, “Tony,” in reply with a smile which Tony did not return.
“I tried
Rhodey pulled Tony's forehead to his and had whispered some loving words and telling him that they will be together again. Tony closed his eyes and let Rhodey's words wash over him. Steve could see the tears Tony finally let fall.
Steve just carried Tony back to his tent but when the harpy refused to let go Steve found himself climbing onto Tony’s small mattress and pulling the other closer to him. This is probably a bad idea but he was not willing to risk using strength and waking Tony up. He knew how hard it was for Tony to fall asleep. Tony had been spotted by many of the members sitting on rocks or tree stumps at night and often would pretend he gotten more sleep than he had.
“Very eager, I see. Promise me something Steve. Do your best. Show them that you are worthy of their time. Don't let anyone tell you different,” Peggy gave him a determined look. He did not know what to say so he just nodded. She smiled her smile and walked ahead of him into the cafeteria.
“Ya laughing at me?” Dum Dum pretended to sound offended but quickly put what he was working on down and paid his full attention to Steve.
It has been long since he has been there. He didn’t always feel like it was home and a part of him missed it but he loved the nomadic life he had so the ache was not too bad.
A chuckle escaped Steve’s lips as he pulled Tony fully against himself, forcing Tony to feel the hard muscles of his chest and his morning wood pressing against Tony’s ass. Then in sudden and quick movements, Steve began to manhandle Tony until he was gently resting against the large pillows and headboard, facing Steve fully. Tony spread his legs out a bit as if inviting the other man to take what he wanted, feeling nervous and excited at where this was going.
Steve was truly ready to face any threat as long as he had Tony and his family right by his side.
The mechanic booths were located towards the left center of the market plaza where a lot of the heavy-duty forges had been built. Steve remembered his Pa took him here when he broke something that needed repairing. Most of the smithies and mechanics were kind and fixed things for much less than they should charge because most people could not afford it anywhere else. He hoped the same men were still there and were willing to help Steve buy a good toolset for a traveling mechanic for a fair price.
Steve could see the stiffness in Rhodey’s posture and he knew that the harpy was on edge since last night. He had a harsh frown painting his face which brought Steve and Tony back to the situation at hand. It felt like the small moment they were sharing was so long ago as the air grew serious and the subject grew dark.
“It's not my problem little man! You should not even be here! How did you get passed the army's tests? You're the reason why I think we need better regulations on who gets in,” the man replied and Steve felt his anger begin to fester. Still, he reigned it in not really wanting to start of his military career on a fight.
Bucky came back and handed him his travel bag looking worried and concerned. Steve understood. They all have come to enjoy Tony’s quiet company and liked having him around. They considered the harpy one of their own now and when one of them got sick the rest did everything in their power to get them better. Tony was no different to them now.
Tony cut Steve’s ramblings with a kiss and Steve immediately reciprocated it. It wasn’t deep or dirty but long and breathtakingly sweet. Tony’s lips felt soft against Steve’s just how he pictured they would be. Tony wrapped his wings around their heads blocking the rest of the world from their view letting them savor this moment forever. They only pulled away to breathe.
Best of luck,
Steve just gaped flabbergasted at watching Tony speak to him for the first time. He didn't really know what to do or say so he just sat there looking like a drowning fish opening and closing his mouth. Still, even in his shock, Steve could feel the elation build up and soon a wide smile crossed his face instead.
It was not hard to imagine that Steve was so happy and relieved at those words that he pulled Tony in for a kiss again whispering ‘I love you’ softly into those lips over and over again for what seemed like a long time.
“What time is it anyway?” Steve grumbled yawning. He tried to lie down again but Bucky wrapped his arm around his shoulder forcing him to stay up. Steve glared at his friend trying to burn his arm off his shoulder but does not move to take it away.
“Go on big boy,” Bucky pushed him forward towards the moving entity he does not want to meet. She was not
“Yeah I will but you promise to talk to Tony the moment you get back right?” Bucky presses and Steve just gives him a solid nod in reply. Bucky takes it and heads over to Steve’s tent as Bruce comes back out of his.
Safe to say he was basically useless for the rest of the day.
Steve wore his nice blue button down shirt that showed off his body in all the right places. According to Sharon, it was his greatest buy. He paired it with simple black slacks, his nicest shoes and his only expensive accessory, a watch that his ex had bought him long ago.
The campfire shined in the center of the tents and the sounds of his teammates could be heard from where he stood. As he climbed over the small walking crack they have made between his tent and Thor’s. Steve spotted all the members of his team sitting there talking while enjoying a cup of what was probably cheap beer. The only person missing was Tony and Steve feared the worst.
She seemed to  contemplate her answer before replying truthfully, “2542.”
Tony settled in between Steve and Rhodey talking a mile a minute at both of them getting happily excited that both groups are interacting well with one another. Tony seemed to have more bounce in his step, more curl to his smile and a larger fire burning behind those eyes. It made Steve a little sad that Tony was not quite there yet to feel comfortable enough to let himself fully be happy like this. Though Steve conceded that it was a dumb way to think and selfish as well. There was no way he or the Avengers could compete with the harpies who traveled all over to find him. It actually made Steve a little glad that Tony had other people to depend on...it will make it easier for Steve to say goodbye knowing Tony is happy and with family.
“S-son?” It was the Captain’s turn to stutter a bit looking shocked.
The shackles on Tony’s hands, feet and neck had come off with little difficulty. Tony shuffled in place rubbing his wrists and testing out his new found freedom. The Harpy seemed to gain a bit of confidence as he moved around more freely. Steve could swear he almost saw a smile spread across Tony’s face but as fast as it was there it was gone.
“Tony,” Steve almost shouted, “Tony! You! You are so very welcome!”
“That is swell,” the merchant smiled wide looking creepy and even more disturbing to Steve, “though I would not recommend this one. He is a pesky little thing and does nothing but cause trouble for his previous owners. Had him returned to me three times since I got him...almost not worth keeping around.”
“Sam,” Steve smiled in relief as he laid back down letting Tony settle back on his chest without further complaint instead he just wrapped his arms carefully around Tony to keep him in place.
“I don’t need your help asking my girl to cut my hair,” Bucky grumbled but nodded at Steve’s suggestion anyway. Bucky was sensitive that way sometimes ever since he had lost his arm.
(See the end of the chapter for
Just when Steve began to doubt himself and felt that he may have overstepped, Tony wrapped his fingers around the bag strap. Steve watched silently as Tony took the bag, rushed to his bed and began to instantly dig through it happily. It was a wonderful site to see Tony light up at each tool and beam happily at him. Though he slowly realized that he was rudely staring at the harpy as he enjoyed his gift. Steve scrambled and sat down looking away from Tony, face heating up and embarrassment set in.
“Tell me what you need and I will go get it. I can make it back in time just tell me what you need,” Steve placed his hands on Bruce’s shoulders forcing the man to look at him and nod. Bruce went back into his tent to get Steve a list of ingredients.
“Why what, Steve?” Tony’s eyes grew cold readying himself for a fight.
Steve enjoyed the rest of his run with Sam until the sun moved higher in the sky and the market has opened for business. He bid Sam a quick goodbye before heading towards the market plaza to get Tony’s gift. As he approached the already growing crowd of the marketplace, Steve lifted up the hoodie of his cloak to stay hidden from the rest of the townsfolk. He did not like sneaking around his hometown but he did not want to be sidetracked by all the people wanting to talk to him.
“Stark? Are you related to Howard Stark by any chance?” Rogers asked Tony pulling him back to sitting position. Tony felt like a rag doll in this man’s hand.
“Tony,” Steve called looking for the harpy but could not find him. The team had set up camp in a new area near a lake that was a bit far from any human town. Steve always did a head count and checks on all his teammates whenever they made camp. It was one of his paranoia tics that he had to do to reassure himself that everything was great.
“Yeah it’s quite the looker,” Clint rolled his eyes snatching the satchel with the artifact inside it. A soft gasp escaped him and Steve knew that it was the artifact. Clint had always been sensitive to curses and magic of the mind ever since Loki attacked them a few years back. It was not pretty to watch and Steve did not want Clint to face any more heartache from such magic.
Tony scooted up to Steve the moment Steve freed him from his grasp. Steve couldn't think with Tony trying to proposition him. And it was then that the reality crashed on top of Steve. It was hard not to see it now that he saw it. Tony was...Tony thought Steve was his
Tony smiled genuinely and replied, "that will be all Miss. Pots."
Steve never felt like his small stature was something to feel bad about until he stood next to the other army recruits waiting for further instruction. Dark thoughts began to swirl in his mind but he had long since learned how to swallow them down. He may be small but he had the courage and will to fight like the rest of them. Even more so.
Tony just nodded with an encouraging smile on his face. Steve really wanted to keep that smile on Tony’s face. It was rare and even more so to have it directed at him. He really was a lost cause.
“I need to talk to you,” Bruce replied and Steve sighed trying to evade the conversation again except Bruce cut him off before he could start by saying, “it’s about Tony.”
Because he still loved him, despite it all.
“They are having quite the pissing contest,” Clint shouted from a few trees away which made the group laugh.
“Sorry,” Steve apologized sheepishly, “it was harder than I thought it would be to not give into the curse.”
“The shoes are too big,” Tony whined shifting a bit in his spot trying to get them to stay on. Pepper let out a soft huff of a laugh. Tony poured a bit and played with the robes in nervousness.
Steve enjoyed their session as it was the first time Tony began using his wings in combat. They were healed enough to play with now and it warmed Steve to see that. It would have broken Tony hard and Steve would have probably never met the person he is talking to today. Their almost nonexistent relationship would have fallen apart before he could even get it started.
“Nah I would rather be with you,” Bucky replied sitting down next to him.
“Well of course! I can’t have you out on the front lines without any back-up. You made me promise not to finish the war without you,” Bucky smiled before turning to look in front. Steve saw his friend’s smile fade away in an instant. It hurt to see him this way.
Or…“you could take my tent tonight. I will just bunk with Sam or Bucky,” Steve rectified and suddenly the tension was gone and Tony looked up at Steve shocked. The harpy could not believe that he was giving him his tent and sleeping quarters over which was odd since they had nowhere else to put him.
Bruce climbed out of his tent and went straight for Tony’s without giving anyone else any face. That was fine with Steve as long as Bruce gave Tony the medicinal help he needed to save his wings. He watched as Bruce stood there whispering softly to Tony before climbing into the tent. A part of him was still jealous of Bruce’s ability to get along so well with Tony but Steve knew that he could still had a chance once he proved to Tony wholly that he is free to do what he wants. Steve just hoped Tony decided to stay even if there was a slim to no chance that was happening.
“Yeah, uh, yes, yes I do,” Steve answered clumsily took off his bag that he had been carrying that held all the list of items Steve had needed to collect.
“Where is he, Ma?” Steve whispered feeling dazed.
“So to let you know the gist of who we are,” Steve lead Tony to an empty log indicating for him to sit, “we are known as the Avengers. We are a missionary based group who work on random jobs here and there to get by. Though we take different forms of payments so it’s not always gonna be easy to get supplies and items we may need but it works. Our last mission was a lucky break and we got a good load of coin from it but that was a rare thing to get. But I know you will fit right in with us so you don’t have to worry! We take some getting used to but we are not a bad group of people! Most of us are just trying to do our best!”
A part of Steve wanted to fight. It was one of the few times where he felt relief. He felt happy. It helped him momentarily forget his irrational feelings. This guy had offered the release Steve needed but now cannot get.
It seemed like the prince could feel the anger behind Tony’s words and just blinks before saying calmly, “Is that so? Why don’t you enlighten us all about the subject of servants vs. thieves?”
“Do I know you?” the prince asked taking a step back after knowing Tony wasn’t going to run.
They had a son. A son. Tony wanted to cry. He took a few steps towards the image and picked it up to get a better look. Tony looked older in the photo with streaks of grey in his hair but it seemed that the stress that had constantly followed him around was no longer there. Steve looked almost the same but Tony could see the small changes time had for him. He too looked like all the troubles in the world was far away. Lastly, there was their son. Grinning wide, missing a tooth with dark brown hair and shining blue eyes. The perfect combo of them. And Tony could bet that their son was brilliant.
Here is the third chapter!! Hope you enjoy it!
He let the anger simmer for only a moment longer. Steve could stew in his feelings for a long time but he knew he needed to get back to camp and make sure Tony was okay. The poor harpy was probably confused and embarrassed at not only having made an unwanted move towards Steve but being told that he was a free man not bound to Steve in any way. He took a deep breath and made his way back to camp.
After that Steve spent a few minutes catching up with Dum Dum before leaving with a promise of returning in eight hours. Now Steve was alone and had time to find his favorite tavern to order some grub. He missed eating food he did not have to catch or preserved. Steve was going to ask Tony to come along since to get to the tavern from the market he had to pass his apartment complex.
Steve looked back up to Tony’s eyes to find the harpy already staring at him as he finished the final wrap of the medicine. Steve smiled at Tony feeling his cheeks heat up at being caught staring. Tony was beautiful and sometimes he could not help but stare even if he knows he should not. “Sorry,” Steve apologized as he came to sit next to the harpy. Tony just tapped his shoulder a few times in response. Steve learned to read Tony’s touches and body language. This was meant to be a reassuring tap.
told Tony he didn’t want to see him or have him around.
“Tony should be with...should be with his family,” Steve said out loud talking to no one in particular.
Pepper took Tony's hands in hers once Rhodey stepped away. She had smiled at him telling him that they were doing this for their people. Pepper reminded him that it was worth the risk. She kissed each cheek and spoke, "will that be all Mr.Stark?"
------
The bridge to the castle was empty with guards standing at attention at each opening. Tony's nerves were on fire and seemed to blaze against his skin with every step. Though he sure would not let it show as he held his head high and walked with purpose and determination. He passed the first set of guards without incident but the second set seemed to study him a second longer. Tony locked his gaze with one of the guards who just smiled cheekily at him. Tony rolled his eyes playfully before turning around dramatically and heading towards the slave masters. They usually passed the palace to make sure that none of the slaves were wanted by the king .
“I wish I wasn't true but the evidence is there and it was too overwhelming to ignore,” Rhodey replied and Tony just shrank in on himself hiding away as much as he could from the team’s eyes by using Steve's bulk to his advantage.
“You got that I-am-worried look on your face,” Bucky spoke up once Steve made it back to them. Steve looked at Bucky and felt himself blushing at being caught.
He felt so alone. Emptiness settled in and the world of people was gone. Steve left the bar leaving Bucky and the annoying girl behind. Outside the air was cold and crisp. The streetlights were dim making it hard to see. Still it was refreshing to be alone in the semi darkness. Steve walked away from the door and down the street when he heard a few footsteps behind him. Walking a little faster Steve turned into the first alley he found. The footsteps stopped and there was silence behind him. He turned.
. If Steve had known that the Erskine trials cost him his greatest love he would have never agreed to participate.
“I made something,” Tony came into Steve's tent without an invitation and if it were anyone else Steve would have kicked them out instantly. Instead, he shifted around to give Tony some space to sit next to him. Tony brought his mechanic bag with him so Steve figured it was something Tony had finished building. It was quite exciting to see what a brilliant mind like Tony's would make.
What a cruel world to wake up to.
“Star-Howard never had such kind big eyes,” Rogers replied and it was as if a dam broke loose inside of Tony and he began to cry.
…until Steve was laughed at when stood in front of the army men. He never felt so humiliated in his life. The angry dark side grew like a peacock and frilled its feathers in triumph. It was telling him that it
“The latter,” Rogers replied smiling sheepishly, “I never expected...wow...what year, is it? Is Star-oh sorry-Howard coming?”
“This is Tony,” Steve replied smiling sheepishly as he rubbed his neck, “uh I bo-saved him from some traders in town.”
“I-” “It’s still Tony’s decision to make,” Steve cut in focusing the attention on the smallest harpy of the group. It looked like Tony was conflicted but decided to include the Avengers in the planning. Even though he did it quite reluctantly.
I am finally moving the time line up so next chapter will be Tony's POV and it will also be a bigger time jump.
Steve awoke in the middle of the night crying. He could not remember why. His breath was short and he could feel a raging heat begin to seep into his bones. It seemed like nothing he could do can shake it off. He looked around almost not recognizing his own room. His hands began to shake as he got up from his small bed.
Steve frowned angrily as he stood up wanting nothing more than to punch the man in the face and free the harpy and all the other creatures from his grasp but instead replied, “I might be.”
“Hey Ma,” Steve grumbled at her tiredly smiling. She smiled back letting her fingers weave through his hair. Steve loved it when Bucky or his mother did that. It soothed him. Reminded Steve of
“Good morning boss,” Tony heard FRIDAY’s familiar voice, “it’s 6:28 am and your vitals are steady despite the short spike. The date is June 23rd, 2024 and you are in Independence, Oregon in your farmhouse.”
“Uh, well, um, yeah, uh you're welcome I guess,” Rogers stammered and suddenly the person on the bed was no longer a hero or a legend just a man who was trying to make conversation with the first person he met. And Tony found that he wanted to talk more with him.
That was at least the truth up until Bucky fell to his death. Steve felt himself lose what little he had left. A part of his mind broke and another seemed to reach out comfortingly. The darkness was welcoming him urging him to continue. Steve stood at the opening staring at the cliffside knowing that he was far gone from Bucky now. Steve took a breath and let the anger and fear in for only a moment. For only a second. Once that second was over Steve went on to finish his mission wishing so much that he could kill Zola. But even Steve knew that the man was more useful to them alive.
That was the easy part. This was going to be extra difficult than their norm and it required all their techniques, skills and battle plans to get this done correctly and smoothly.
Tony went into the tent and began to use healing ruins on Happy while Bruce whipped up some paste to close the wound and get it cleaned from any infections. The duo worked into the night as Steve sat outside the tent with the rest of the team that had come back over the course of the day. It was hard but Steve was so thankful that Happy was out cold that he did not feel any of the things that they needed to do to help him.
“You don’t even have to ask punk,” Bucky punched Steve in the arm, “just...go get what he needs okay. No matter what.”
Yes, Tony quoted from his favorite book, Utopia, but it seemed fitting.
“I…that is not what I meant!” the girl tried to deflect but it only added fuel to Steve’s fire of anger. He was about to retort when a strong hand came to his shoulder and squeezed hard effectively shutting him up. Once he heard Bucky start diffusing the situation he zoned out.
Tony watched Jarvis dip the cloth into the dirtying water with very tired eyes. He wanted to sleep but he knew he could not unless he was cleaned up. He had learned his lesson early to always make sure the injuries were treated. If they were not it could end with a hospital trip and those are never fun. He was running out of lies to tell the doctors when they would examine him. He almost confessed the truth to a doctor, which ended up getting him more lashes after he left the hospital. Though Tony never understood how doctors, who claimed to be educated, could believe the lies he tells. Tony always weaved them in a way that there was a chance of doubt but every single one of them just blew off the doubt.
After a long silence, Steve finally got the courage to speak his mind, “I don’t want this to be a goodbye, Tony. I...I have come to care...no I have come to love you and if you need me so I can stay here with you and help. The Avengers can go on without me but I don’t know if I can go on without you. I have come to realize that I could spend the rest of my life with you and that...I found a home, with you Tony. You gave me a home. I just...fuck I love you Tony Stark. You don’t have to feel the same but all I am asking for is a chance to win your love. Please? Uh-”
“Dive, Steffan,” the man said as they stood in front of a pool of water, “you are ready to see the truth.”
Steve spent most of his time around Tony. Training, learning, talking with him almost as much as Steve possibly could. Ever since Tony showed Steve how the gloves worked he was hesitantly agreed to allow Tony to join the more combat heavy missions as long as he learned basic fighting techniques.
Watching Bruce and Tony interact made Steve feel more and more bitter. Tony actually smiled at the other man as he checked on him. Bruce seemed to take a liking to Tony as well and just talked about things Steve was not sure he understood but from the way Tony was looking at Bruce he knew the harpy did. It made Steve itch to grab a book on medicine and learn all about the science of healing if it meant getting that smile directed at him. Steve really was quick to get attached and quick to get offended sometimes.
In sync, the whole team slowed down as to not startle the kidnappers. They all feared that if they startled them it could result in more harm. Came close enough to see a bunch of harpies huddled closely together with Tony nowhere in sight. Dread began to seep in as he crawled closer to the huddled group. They seemed to be fighting something and it was at that moment that Steve realized that the harpies were all surrounding Tony pinning him down.
Tony listened as Steve talked not uttering a word or looked away from Steve throughout his whole speech. The harpy followed where he pointed and took whatever Steve handed him. Tony did it all without complaint. Even as he did all this Steve could still see the burning fires in those eyes patiently waiting for the right time to pounce. Steve would really hate being on the other side of those claws and nails but he hoped to turn Tony around by then.
“Tony,” Steve breathed standing up straighter and shuffling his feet. The last time they had met was when he was still skinny 150 lbs asthmatic. Tony was one of the few real loves he felt and at thirty-five he has yet to come close to what he felt for the man standing a few feet away from him.
“I don’t know Steven,” she answered weaving her fingers into his hair like she always did when he was younger. Steve closed his eyes trying hard to regain himself again. These feelings kept growing, consuming him. Every night it felt his heart break. Every morning he felt hallowed and lost. No matter how much his mother or Bucky tried to cheer him up.
Tony moans and brings his hands up to his head, trying to somehow pressure his headache into nonexistence. When that doesn’t work, he uses a hand to shelter his eyes from the morning light that assaults his sight as his eyelids flicker open.
Well, the best thing to do is to start correcting at least one of those things.
“Glad to be of assistance, sir,” Jarvis’ reassuringly familiar voice rings out inside the hub, a note of amusement sharp and audible, as the screens light up.
Once he’s done with that, he leans over the hood to check the oil and coolant levels. The oil seems a little low, but the coolant is fine.
“You could say that,” Tony drawls, squinting against the morning light. “Happen to know where we are?”
“You got spunk, kid. How about this? This one needs the alternator replaced,” he says, tapping the hood of the morris. “You get the old one off, put the new one in, and I’ll consider it.”
He scrunches his face up in disgust and turns his head to the side. The thing licks again.
“Satisfied?” Tony hisses at the now surprised man.
Although it also meant he was in deep shit. According to the Deutsch proposition and its circumvention of the grandfather paradox, he was in a completely different parallel universe.
“Hey,” he says, waving a hand to the guy sitting across from him to get his attention. “Do you happen to know where I could find some work?”
“That’s what I said,” Tony barks, frowning harder in an attempt to discourage the man from asking anymore questions.
“Sure, how about this? I go in, you stay here, monitor the… dust bunnies. If I run into trouble, I’ll signal you.”
He pushes around the crummy tasting eggs on his plate and eats as much as he can bring himself to. He’s never been much of a morning person, which also means he’s rarely hungry and generally not functional until his third cup of liquid caffeine. He should just get that stuff in IV form. Unfortunately, people here don’t feel quite the same way about coffee as he does, as there’s currently none available at the boarding house -- he’d asked, repeatedly.
out of a job?”
Which also meant that his chances of returning to his original time-correct universe were close to null.
The stranger grabs an oiled stained rag and tosses it at Larry in protest, who chuckles and catches it as it hits him in the shoulder.
Admitting temporary defeat against the sun, he groans and shoves the flimsy blanket doing a poor job of protecting him against the cold December air -- they don’t even have heating,
Shit. Is he really in 1940?
He juggles the device in one hand, throwing it up and catching it as it falls back down to his hand.
He spots some loose change one of the tool tables as he works, and surreptitiously changes it out with the coins he has. He suspects the change is only there for the same purpose he just used his own penny for, so it’s not like he’s harming anyone by switching it out. Most people he’s had to use money with don’t even notice it’s ‘over’-dated anyway. Who knew Tony Stark would end up money laundering on the daily?
Needless to say, that plan didn’t exactly pan out.
Rogers seems to sense someone watching him and raises his head again, looking around with a confused frown on his face until his gaze lands on Tony. His frown deepens as he realizes Tony has been staring at him.
Rogers glowers at him in response, all coiled muscles and sparking blue eyes. “We still need a plan. It could be a trap.”
“That was my father. Captain Joseph Rogers,” he explains with a puzzled look. “Did you know him?”
He really should have remembered that tiny little tidbit of information before going over there in the first place, but he hadn’t put two and two together until he saw Rogers himself sitting in that bench the day before.
Tony doesn’t. They stare at each other in deafening silence for some good fifteen seconds.
He strolls back outside to drink himself into oblivion. Hopefully the next time he opens his eyes he’ll be home.
Larry hasn’t come out of his office yet, so he looks around for some sort of car chart, finding it near the tools on the table, and checks to see if the vehicle is due for more repairs.
He takes a few steps closer and gets a glimpse of the man’s face as he slightly raises his head to shoot a look at the Brooklyn bridge.
“Done.”
Well, fuck him. That is Steve Grant Rogers. Captain extraordinaire and long-standing idol of one Howard Stark.
There are hands on his head, holding him under, and he opens his mouth to breathe but there’s only water. Water in his eyes, water in his mouth, water in his throat, rushing down to his lungs. They’re drowning him. He’s going to die. He doesn’t want to, but he can’t tell them. He can’t build them what they want.
Once he makes it into Brooklyn, he asks around for the most affordable boarding houses to look for and is directed to Brooklyn heights.
-- but it’s blissfully numb.
So, why can’t he stop?
He has no idea what he’s gonna do if he never sees Rhodey again. His money, his fame, all that stuff, sure it will sting that he doesn’t have it -- it already does,
The lettering on the board makes him do a double take.
The boarding house is almost entirely populated by men, all of which are already up and about. Were all people early risers in the forties? How deplorable.
Sure, they’d left things off on an ok stance after New York, but the tentative truce didn’t seem to last long at all. Probably a consequence of continued exposure to Tony Stark. Honestly, if Shield wanted them to get along they should have gone the complete opposite route and minimized Rogers’ interactions with him.
He catches the man’s attention with a wave.
Maybe he should focus harder, try to decipher the words that keep pouring out of Rogers’ mouth.
He stumbles a few steps back and closes his eyes, taking a deep centering breath. He needs to stop freaking out and examine the situation. There’s always a way out. It may not be desirable but there has to be.
, 1940. Right day, wrong year.
Tony wrinkles his nose and nods in thanks. He turns around and starts walking in what he judges is the direction of Brooklyn. It’s the closer of the destinations, considering he has to make the trip on foot, and possibly safer.
So much for avoiding Barnes.
Tony gives a half-hearted shrug and resigns himself to his fate as Barnes falls into pace beside him.
He squints at the newcomer, trying to figure out what about him is ringing a bell in his mind. There’s just something… familiar about his face. Tony could swear he’s seen it before.
Tony blinks his eyes open-- when had they closed? The steady burning feeling in his chest is increasing, like someone kept tossing kindling to the fire. He feels strange--bad. His head hurts and his hair is sticking uncomfortably to his forehead inside the helmet, wet. He feels a drop of sweat run down his face.
He turns around, surprised at the spontaneous outburst of aggressive behaviour. What the hell? Usually he has to work a bit harder to get this much of a rise out of Rogers. He looks riled too, all two hundred pounds of muscle wound up and ready to strike.
. It hurts so much. Why is he hurting?
Tony blinks, swallows, and sets his jaw.
with his mechanic savviness, he’d been asked to start right away, which worked fine with him because he’d need the money. He’d get paid at the end of the week, though, twenty-two dollars. Which would seem like a practical joke in his time but was apparently very reasonable by forties standards.
Well it’s not like Tony feels a compelling need to be liked by the hero. He’s an unstable mess on his good days, and he’s fine with it, he doesn’t need the other man’s validation. He’d learnt to stop expecting things like that a long time ago.
In the meantime, Larry has left him to the morris, retreating to the side room he’d come out of before. It must be his office; he’ll sneak a peek once he heads over that way.
Tony freezes, looking up Barnes.
“I’m from there too!” Barnes brightens immediately, a grin breaking across his face. “Best hood in Brooklyn, I’m telling you. I can walk you, I’m heading there too.”
He gives himself a cursory pat down and is relieved to find his wallet still in his possession. So, nobody tried to rob him. Strange. He was in a bit of a compromising position, and alone from the looks of it.
, but something at least resembling 70s style engines, which will probably be mind blowing to people in the 40s. He can’t create greatness out of thin air -- he’s a mechanic, not a magician -- he’ll need way better materials and tools to create modern machinery.
He reaches the warehouse’s heavy double doors and pushes them open, surveying the interior as he steps inside. It’s as empty as he was expecting, dust gathered on the floor and floating in the air, a few odd shoe prints scattered about. It’s basically just an empty space with a few windows and cracked walls -- due for a repaint. Nothing in the least bit exciting. What a bore.
He glances back at Larry and nods once, turning back to pop the hood of the car open.
“What are you doing?” Rogers’ voice sounds from behind as soon as he steps foot outside. How does he already sound mad?
“What was that?” Rogers asks, immediately on edge. He tenses visibly, head whirling around as he tries to pinpoint the source of the sound.
It’s Rogers, he’s in a low crouch in front of him. When did he get here? He was across the room a second ago, trying to break the door open. It won’t work-- it won’t
The outside scene freezes him in his tracks as soon as he lays eyes on it.
He takes off the ac-dc t-shirt he used to sleep in last night and dons his single 1940s appropriate outfit. Maybe he should go back to the shop and buy another. And some underwear. He’s definitely gonna need to change at some point and he can’t very well sit nude in the parlor while he waits for his clothes to be washed.
Rogers whirls around to face him, regular scowl already planted on his face, and Tony holds up a hand to shut him up when he opens his mouth, doubtlessly to tear Tony a new one.
When they finally finish up for the day, Larry bids them a quick goodbye and Barnes walks with him outside.
like him he was at every chance his father got, there was a never ending collection of memorabilia and old records and photos dedicated to the man back in his dad’s office back in the manor.
“Still nothing, sir. Although, I should alarm you that the doors and wall paneling of that chamber seem to be made of a fortified concrete mix not stated in the building schematics.”
“So, where are you headed?” he asks as they exit the garage.
As it were, everytime Barnes opened his mouth, he acutely reminded Tony of who exactly he was walking next to, which made him think of his connection to Captain America, which in turn dug up a lot of unpleasant memories starring himself and his daddy issues.
Barnes nods and turns, walking away from the shop as Tony climbs the steps and pushes the door open.
He walks in a daze, staring at the buildings all around him. Noting how fundamentally
Tony runs a hand over his forehead, realizing too late it was smeared with oil. Great.
“There aren’t really open spots on the company right now, though I don’t think that’d be the best thing for ya.”
Did Fury really have to send them to fucking Alaska? They could have done plenty of team bonding in New York, where it’s nice and warm, heaters exist, and he has hot coffee on demand.
They need to move. The sooner they get this done, the sooner they can put this pathetic mission behind them and get gone. They’re just burning daylight by this point, of which there isn’t much here to begin with. There’s no use in sitting around twiddling his thumbs waiting for Rogers to gear up for a fight that’s not even going to happen -- well, assuming they don’t piss each other off and end up trading punches themselves. In forethought that might not be such a bad outcome; blowing off some steam -- that’s good for morale, no?
This is insane. He must be on acid trip. It’s the only plausible explanation. The only strange thing about it is how oddly focused and realistic everything is.
There’s a muffled sound somewhere-- where…
He stuffs his previous clothes inside the case (it’s not like he’s getting rid of his band shirt, he loves that shirt) and in under ten minutes he’s out of the store, no longer sticking out like a sore thumb in the crowded streets of NY and on his way to Brooklyn.
“I need a suit,” he states, eyeing the various clothes hung around the store. His gaze lands on some suitcases perched in a rack. “And maybe one of those cases.”
There’s nothing else mentioned for the morris, so he puts the chart back and gives the car a check over himself. He lowers it to the ground and inspects the brake pads, which are looking a little worn. He makes a mental note to tell Larry about it and moves on to the tires. They aren’t new, but they aren’t that bad yet, and they pass the penny inspection just so when he whips one out to test them.
People are still looking him like he’s an alien who just took a shit in their backyards, so he scurries into the park. The stray trots after him.
-- and he’d give anything to have it again, but he has to actively avoid the thought of his best friend or he starts feeling the beginnings of a panic attack setting in.
He figures keeping his last name won’t be much of a problem. His father may be a bit of celebrity at the moment -- and he really doesn't want to think about his father right now, wow -- but Stark is a common enough last name. He could just as easily have it and not be related to him in any way.
“--Oh no, no, no.
“--Goddammit Stark,” Rogers all but shouts, everything about his posture screaming fury and offense. “Jarvis, reengage life support protocol.”
He puts his modern clothing aside, taking care to store the ac-dc shirt inside the case -- he doesn’t want it misplaced, it’s his favorite and one of the only things he has of home -- and slips his wallet into his pocket, leaving the room and locking the door behind him.
Awkward.
“A job, you say? You have any experience, boy?”
Also I recognize that it’s really improbable someone would get a job like that, but what can I say, Larry is one crazy mofo and I claim fanfiction-logic privileges
Rogers finally breaks the silence after a while, the awkwardness likely proving to be too great for him, “Then how’d you know his name?”
“Don’t get too excited, you eager beaver. This room’s as deserted as the rest of the building,” Tony drawls, letting a smirk tug at his lips behind the iron man mask.
There’s a strange burning feeling in his chest, and his head feels impossibly heavy. So does his armor, now that he notices. It’s like a crushing weight on his shoulders. How does he usually manobrate this thing?
somewhere in the room.
He suspects the mechanic job will be right up his alley. Now he just has to convince the owner to employ him without any proof of prior experience. Shouldn’t be too hard, provided he gets his hands on a wrench.
He hears Rogers making his way down the hall to him, the telltale sign of vibranium cutting through the air telling him that the man just retrieved his oversized frisbee from his back harness hold.
He puts the schematics away and turns the screens off before lowering the ramp of the jet. Immediately, gelid air rushes inside the aircraft, lowering the nice toasty weather in the cockpit to almost sub-zero temperatures. He feels the cold permeate his very bones, his breaths starting to condense in the air in mere seconds.
He just needs to find a place where they won’t stare him to death for daring to breathe the same air.
Well it took me a while, but I’ve finally managed chapter two! Hopefully the next one won’t take as much time 😅 but considering the amount of things i’m working on, it’s a possibility.
Tony’s starting to think he’s not going to get any answer when one of the guys sitting closer to the end leans forward and speaks up, “Larry down on willow street owns a garage. Ya might get lucky if you stop around, ask if he needs a hand.”
If they do nothing, they’ll pass out in one minute, run out of air completely in two and, well, die immediately, really, if the air pumps continue running until the room is in vacuum. They aren't just pulling oxygen from the room, they’re pulling everything. Even Rogers couldn’t survive that.
“Yeah, yeah, yeah,” Tony drones on, holding up an armored hand in a dismissive wave. “We all know you’re in charge.”
“Is there something you need, mister?”
He comes across a few more people in his trek, but they mostly steer clear of him. His heavy frown is probably not doing him any favors in earning sympathy points.
Rogers lets out a sharp breath that almost sounds like a growl and walks forward towards the door, closing the straps of his shield around his arm with a forceful frustrated yank of the fabric. Good thing Tony fortified that stuff to resist superserumed temper tantrums.
The man is lean and scrawny, he could almost be mistaken for a child where he sat doubling over himself to doodle on the notebook propped open on his thighs. There was something very oddly familiar about him though.
“That’s what the id states.”
“Sir?” Jarvis prompts at the same time that Rogers expresses his outrage, “
As soon as the man closes his fist around the money, Tony turns his back and hurries off with the stray in tow, before the man has a chance to notice he’d just been given a future coin.
,” Tony barks out, emphasizing the command with a sharp wave of his hand. “What is it, J?”
Tony hums and nods, schooling his face into the most dejected expression he can muster.
Well, it’s good to know his assholery skills are still intact at the very least.
He finishes his search and finds his car keys (the corvette’s), which are useless since he doesn’t know where his car is, and a pack of mint gum. Ok. Now he just needs to grab a cab and get back to the manor before Obie realizes he’s missing. And possibly drink this whole day away. Scratch that. Definitely drink this whole day away.
They’re successful about fifteen minutes into their search, coming across a small hot dog stand next to the lake. There are only three people in line, so thankfully the wait won’t be long.
“Humm, who are you?” A deep voice entones from the entrance of the shop.
“Analyse the room’s structural integrity and give me a timeline, J.”
He’d recognize that face anywhere; even if he hadn’t spent the better part of his childhood being held to same standards as the star spangled legend and reminded of how very much
“Give me some time alone with that engine and a good set of tools and I’ll fine-tune it into an acceptable state, because, honestly, my microwave had better capacity than
He eventually reaches an exit and wanders out of the park, looking for street signs to tell him where he is.
He does.
“Analyzing, sir.”
Behind the dog, he notes a knocked over trash can with some old looking food scraps scattered about. Yuck.
Tony keeps moving forward, clearing the hallways one by one. He checks a few rooms that look like they once served as storage closets, but they all have one thing in common — they’re completely empty. Nothing in this godforsaken frozen land justifies the energy surge that brought them here in the first place. He’s starting to think the whole thing was just an excuse made up by Fury to force them to be in the same enclosed space for over ten hours.
“Well, does the genius have a name?”
They keep making small talk as they make their way over to the heights, and if Barnes was anyone else, literally anyone else, Tony might have been feeling glad and thankful for the company -- even he recognized he ought find some friendly acquaintances in the forties to stave off complete insanity.
“Get out of here, you hophead!” one of them jeers, earning cheers of support from his friends.
The noise stops. Oxygen concentration is at eight per cent.
He can— he can
“Have you changed the alternator yet, son?”
Huh, he was still in his aged ac-dc shirt and oil stained sweat shorts, he hadn’t changed out of his workshop wear last night. Which means he hadn’t put much thought into his impromptu outing either.
Holy shit, are the hot dogs actually being sold for twenty cents each? You can barely get a hot dog under two dollars and a half within a ten-mile radius of central park. This crazy land has its perks after all. Not that money is usually a problem for him.
He shoots his arm out, bodily shoving away at the general direction of whatever was
It doesn’t take long to find the aforementioned garage. It’s in a little nook of the street, and it looks like it was taken right out of a forties postcard. Which he supposes makes since, since these
And when he does it, he… he can go back to the night
“I’m here for a job.”
Science hasn’t seen the force of nature that is a motivated Tony Stark with a single goal in mind yet. He’ll find the resources, and he’ll do the research and he’ll be damned if he doesn’t actually find a way home again. He’s Tony fucking Stark, he once hacked the pentagon on a dare, he can find a way to revert the accidental miracle of science he single handedly performed, pissed drunk, on a wednesday night.
Rogers is saying something -- his mouth is moving -- but the mess of sounds that reaches Tony’s ears is just scrambled further in his brain. Like a puzzle with its pieces thrown in the blender -- why would someone put puzzle pieces in a blender? That sounds counterproductive.
Rogers growls, letting go of his shoulder with a rough push backwards before storming towards the closed entrance doors. Tony stumbles a little before regaining his balance.
He spots a bar that seems less reputable, judging from the look of the people loitering on the street before it, and steps inside. The stray doesn’t follow him in this time.
with a growl of blind anger and frustration.
Besides, what kind of a revenge plan is this?
The pain is unbearable, all-consuming, agonizing. But it’s familiar.
. Understanding washes over Tonyr, making him momentarily forget his affronted surprise at Rogers’ behaviour. So
Barnes studies him in silence for a moment, during which Tony tries to look as inconspicuous as possible.
Rogers’ still here, though, and there’s a strange look to his eyes. He seems worried. Why is he worried? Doesn’t he know it’s Tony inside the armor?
His eyes widen in shock.
He tips to the side, trying to scramble on the floor, but he can’t make use of his limbs, they’re all heavy and confined, as if he’d been stuffed in concrete. And he can’t escape the sizzling pain in his chest. It
and drags himself to his feet.
And isn’t that a scary thought.
What? No, this can’t be happening. Not like this. He has to find a way to-- there has to be a way out of this.
He pushes himself up to a sitting position against the wall behind him, tries not to think about how filthy it probably is and ignores the way his stomach rebels at the movement.
“Well… not exactly. See, the deal is I’ve had a ton of experience with engineering and mechanics, and I really need a job, but I’ve lost all my documentation.”
All he needs to do is convince his parents to stay in that night. He can make this right. He can fix
Stuff that he used to flip through when he was young and naïve, and thought he could somehow earn his father’s respect if he learned all he could about the late hero. After all, there was no one Howard Stark respected more than the great Steven Rogers.
He is frozen in place for a good thirty seconds, looking at his surrounding in utter shock.
It’s not that different from 1991 New York, if you didn’t account for the vastly different clothing style. People were still hurrying off and onto the bridge, in the eternal hustle and bustle typical of NY, and there were even the occasional tourists around.
But he isn’t; he’s imminently broke and alone in an unknown version of his hometown. And it doesn’t look like anyone’s going to come to his rescue.
“From my calculated statistics, your best case scenario would be to combine efforts with captain Rogers and try to weaken the door frame, sir,” Jarvis relays, pulling up statistics and computations. “However, that course of action would take the minimum of five to six minutes to complete, and regrettably, you only have two until vacuum pumps completely deplete the room of oxygen and other air molecules.”
“You seem to really know your stuff, kid. Anything you wanna add?”
resources.
No use in lying about something that could easily be disproved.
“A little too fancy, no?”
“He does,” Tony replies, smirking at him. The stranger raises the other eyebrow, but there is amusement twinking in his eyes. Tony concedes and holds his arm out for the stranger to shake. “Tony Stark.”
Tony rolls around in the hard mattress, refusing to let the first rays of morning light chase him from the bed. He’s never awake before noon as a general rule, waking up with the sun because the boarding house he’s forced to crash in doesn’t even have enough money for decent blinds is the stuff of his nightmares. And it doesn’t look like he’s escaping this particular one anytime soon.
“--Rogers,” Tony cuts him off, already tired of the lecturing monologue. “You see anybody in here? It’s a grab and bag, you should have stayed in the jet.”
There’s one last room he hasn’t checked, at the end of the corridor he finds himself in currently. The set of doors to access it looks as hefty as the entrance ones, so maybe this wasn’t all for naught.
He tries to whip his head up, but he only manages a slow steady lift of his neck. It’s harder to move, it must be the armor-- it’s heavier, it is, that’s the problem.
There’s a surprised yelp, and Tony cracks one eye open against the stupid-bright morning light.
His first attempt at opening his eyes is remarkably unsuccessful, serving only to boost his headache up to unprecedented levels of agony. Where the hell did all that light come from? It’s not supposed to be so bright is it? He was… in his lab, he thinks. As far as he can remember. Everything got pretty fuzzy after his eight shot of whiskey.
“What does it look like, Rogers? We’re not paid to sit around and look pretty -- well, I’m not paid at all, but that’s besides the point. I’m going in.”
Tony leans back in the quinjet pilot seat, examining the schematics of the warehouse in the holographic screen for the fifth time today. It still continues to be mindlessly boring and completely uninteresting.
The animal stares at the offered limb for a few seconds in apparent apprehension, until curiosity wins out and it take a few steps forwards, sniffing at it.
“Some kind.”
In the end, it isn’t the reversal of this unbelievable hallucination from hell that makes him move, it’s hunger.
His stomach starts grumbling in complaint, so he gets up, dusts himself off and enlists the stray’s help in sniffing down some sort of food selling place.
Rogers stops his shield in the air, ready for another strike, to glance at Tony. The frown on his face has morphed into something else, something... concerned? Is that worry on Captain America’s face? For little old him?
It’s cold and dark,
“What is it?” Rogers asks, appearing beside him.
the charm.
“Just a gadget.”
“Maybe something more mechanic?” he asks tentatively as the men exchange some looks amongst themselves.
Tony stares at the man some more. He really looks different without all those extra muscle pounds.
His presence doesn’t go unnoticed for long, though. A woman in a flowery knee length dress and an impressively curly hairstyle walking on his side of the road shoots him a sneer before hurriedly crossing the street. A gang of men who were congregating in a small group outside what appeared to be a bar take notice of the action and start leering at him.
What would he even do, though? He has no credentials (even though his certified genius is pretty much unparalleled) and he’s still not sure if he should make himself known here. He has no idea where
Something wet licks at his cheek.
Shit.
everything looked.
“Sir, the air supply to the suit will be terminated in ten seconds.”
Rogers immediately bristles at the word, making Tony smirk in amusement. That definitely hit a nerve.
Jarvis’ scans had already cleared the building. There’s no one inside, and there hasn’t been any activity here for at least a week -- same time the supposed energy pulse that came across Shield’s radar occured. This whole thing was a rookie assignment, as in the stuff Shield probably saved for its interns. Why was he doing this again? It certainly wasn’t for Rogers’ scintillating conversational skills -- he could swear the man was as charismatic as a bag of bricks.
He’ll die instead.
Because this is an ancient model, the hood release is in the bumper, making his work easier. Its insides will do anything but aid him, however. The only time he’s ever seen enginery like this is behind museum glass. Everything's pretty much in the same place as it is in the modern day, though, thankfully.
Right, he’s supposed to pay. Twenty-three cents. Fuck, was currency even the same in 1940?
Tony scoffs -- internally because he’s actually trying to get employed and being a little shit won’t help his case right now.
Everything goes smooth enough, and Tony uses the change he’d gotten after buying that bottle of scotch the previous night, so he doesn’t have to worry about the money being invalid. The suit and case cost a total of 9 dollars, an underwhelming amount in his time, but he’s starting to worry about his depleting cash fund.
The man’s eyes take a while to focus on him, but he eventually responds in a raspy voice with, “Brooklyn and the Bronx have some boarding houses that will make you lower prices than any of the ratholes around here.” He gives a sluggish wave of his hand and burps.
The barman’s in the process of cleaning a glass as he approaches the counter.
He goes inside the store; his arrival being announced through the ringing of the bell hung on the front door. The tailor’s head immediately shoots up at the foretelling sound and his eyes land on Tony.
“Jarvis?”
“Nothing interesting, apparently,” Tony replies as he reaches an armored hand towards the device, picking it up. The thing is light, cylindrical and seemingly innocuous. They really came all the way to the frozen wilds for this? What a waste of time.
The floor is hard stone, it would probably feel cold and solid under his fingers, refreshing. He should take a gauntlet off and try it out. Oh, no, that’s right, he can’t. He has to stay inside and choke on his own breath. Will it hurt as much as the other times? He hopes not, but it probably will. That’s ok, he’s used to it.
Well, drinking himself into oblivion for a second time didn’t work. He has no fucking clue what to do now. Fuck.
“It’s the cold,” he repeats, giggling like a lunatic.
Wait. Wasn’t he supposed to be in his lab? This is definitely not his lab. This is a random back alley with smelly scraps of old burger meat and fish bones tossed around in God knows where. How the fuck did he get here?
“Forget it,” Tony cuts in, giving a dismissive wave of his hand, “Thought you were someone else. But you’re evidently more… scrawny.”
“Look mister, I don’t know what you’re playing at but—”
It looks like time’s square is up ahead, and he might have better luck there.
Tony grabs the bottle and takes a big mouthful of the liquid, feeling the familiar burn of alcohol light a path down his throat.
Larry chuckles, giving him another once-over.
He ends up choosing a chair next to a group of rowdy men who look about his own age and starts eating. They give him some curious glances, but he mostly ignores them and soon they lose interest, resuming the debate on who’s the raciest broad, Dolores or Linda.
The next part is is easy, he locates the piece and disconnects it, using the tools left on the working table. They’re not the ones he’s used to working with — they require more strength of the arm than agility — but he’s nothing if not adaptable.
The dog is still giving him the side eye.
The rest of his group has quieted down, interest piqued now that Tony has chosen to interact with them.
Crisis avoided. He should really start paying more attention to what he says, especially around key characters in world history. He doesn’t want a Steve Rogers debacle repeat like yesterday.
Yeah, what kind of explanation is Tony supposed to pull out of his ass that won’t buy him a ticket to the next looney bin? There are no good options, so he simply shrugs.
Well, not acceptable to
Are microwaves not a thing yet? Shit.
Tony rolls his eyes and huffs in annoyance as he digs out his wallet to flash the man his hundred-dollar bill.
“Yes, sir.”
Before Rogers can start a tirade on the many reasons why he was so righteous and Tony was so not, Tony hurries off and ducks inside the boarding house, leaving a fuming American icon in his wake.
Barnes’ frown deepens, in more pronounced bewilderment this time. “How would you know that?”
Now he knows where he recognized his damn face from. He can’t believe this -- out of all the people inhabiting New York in 1940s America, how the hell does he keep running into the ones he least wants to see? Not that he has a long nurtured hate towards Bucky Barnes, but he kind got jumbled together into the same category as Steve Rogers by association.
Rogers has his back to him, most of his uniform already on. He has his cowl resting on the benches next to his belt, and is rummaging through one of the gear boxes.
It looked like the US hadn’t entered the war yet, which fell in line with the official American 1940s story. If he remembered his history correctly, they hadn’t gotten involved until after the attack on pearl harbor, which took place on December 7
Tony was curious, ok? So, if he somehow inadvertently figured out how to time travel through some arguably unlawfully obtained reports, then… well, that just went to prove his genius.
What the hell even is hophead?
He wanders through the trees, in a complete confounding state, staring dumbly at every landmark that rings a bell of recognition inside his head.
It was more than enough for him to afford his continued stay in the boarding house, and it left him with a little on the side, so he was more than happy about that. Maybe he could save up, start taking some gigs if the opportunity arose, and get enough money and status to get his hands on the materials he needed to try and figure his way out of this hot mess.
“You could say that.” He can’t turn off
He couldn’t— he couldn’t think about this. No. He can’t—
The people in front of him eventually get their orders and scurry off to get away from him in a very not inconspicuous way. He rolls his eyes and steps forward.
“You’re twenty-one? Really? You look eighteen, at the most,” Barnes quips and Tony heaves an internal sigh of relief.
“You’ve got a job, son,” Larry announces, walking towards the morris and clapping his shoulder on the way. He stops over the open hood, examining Tony’s handiwork.
And he really needed to stop thinking about this now.
“How much for a newspaper?” he asks the man, who was in the process of putting what looked like a measly amount of dressing on the sausage.
He passes another men’s clothing store as he walks, and hesitates for a while, eyeing the suits exhibited on the shop’s window. Having era appropriate clothes would probably make his stay in the apparent 1940s smoother.
“Sorry about that, Fido. You caught me in a bad day,” he rasps out, reaching out a hand in apology and letting it hover in the air before the dog.
The man has a graying head of hair, with a full beard to match. He’s wearing mechanic clothes, aged and stained with oil -- they’re well worn, from the look of them -- and he’s a little round around the stomach. Must be the shop owner, then -- Larry, he thinks his name was.
With that out of the way, Tony turns around and heads for the ramp. Time to get this show on the road.
It’s an obvious sign that they aren’t taking customers yet, but Tony isn’t here as one.
Barnes pauses next to him, glancing at the indicated tailor shop. He looks back at Tony and raises an eyebrow.
A lot of people here seemed to be in a similar situation to him anyway – i.e. homeless. And isn’t that ironic? Former billionaire playboy Tony Stark with two hundred bucks to his name and no place to crash.
“How much for a bottle of scotch?”
There were increasingly more people on the street, and they looked less uptight the further away he got form fifth avenue, so it was easier to get by unnoticed.
He must be going a bit crazy too, cause that spot of green at the end of what the other man called fifth avenue, the disposition of the buildings and the streets, everything seems eerily reminiscent of the actual street. And that’s impossible.
He slips under the door and takes a look inside, heading further into the garage. The interior is relatively small. There’s a couple of cars -- two rovers and a morris -- but not room for much else. The morris is on a rotary car lift, which seems to be the only one in the shop, and one of the rovers has the hood open, its outdated enginery in plain sight.
is going on?” Rogers’ voice finally cuts through the noise in his head, urgent and agitated.
His breathing has started to pick up and his hands are shaking worse than an engine with a faulty crankshaft damper. He rockets to his feet and paces, trying to get his breathing under control. The last he needs right now is to lose his shit over an already shitty situation.
“Jarvis, if I could, I’d kiss you right now.”
The man nods frenziedly and his demeanor changes entirely. He is much more amenable to Tony as he helps him select the best fitting suit and even assists in picking out a case.
He’d gone inside yesterday, after his riveting conversation with America’s first all-star superhero, and bought himself a stay for the week from the gruffy old man sporting an impressive pot belly that was manning what passed for a reception. He has to present payment no later than each monday on the dot or he gets the boot.
What the hell did he do last night?
He shakily pulls out a quarter and places it on the waiting hand, taking his hot dog with the other and hoping the man doesn’t look at the series number too closely.
Speaking of, he can hear one very spangled american hero rustling around in the back of the quinjet, probably gathering supplies to fit in his ‘utility belt’ -- turns out Rogers hadn’t taken too kindly to Tony calling it a fanny pack (even though it absolutely is).
The smile melts off Tony’s face. Fuck.
“Larry told me,” he bullshits, hoping Barnes won’t dig deeper into the subject.
The corner of the man’s mouth tips up in amusement -- hopefully a good sign.
“Sure thing. See you.”
Tony diverts his attention away from the newcomer, whom he just realized he might have been staring a bit too intensely at, and looks back at Larry, letting a smug smile tug on his lips.
“I’m afraid so, sir,” Jarvis informs, regret evident in his voice. “I am detecting an alarming increase in air rarefaction. It appears the room is airtight and vacuum pumps are depleting the gas molecules in its interior,” he explains, bringing up a percentage countdown of the oxygen concentration on the hub.
the forties. He’s gonna need more time to wrap his head around that.
Rhodey scolding him in the back of his head.
Tony lets out a little grunt, starting to lose his patience with the man.
It doesn’t look like much, the poor thing. It’s thin as a rake and its dull walnut fur is dirty and matted in thick knots. It was probably hungry.
Things could be worse, though. The rent costs only about seven dollars a week and includes dinner, accommodations, laundry and cleaning. Thank god for inflation -- words he never thought he would find himself thinking.
He follows the voices down the stairs and into the dining room, where most of the tenants appear to have gathered. They all have dishes of what seems like scrambled eggs mixed with a few pitiful scraps of bacon in front of them.
He lets Rogers take point, moving behind him as the super soldier pushes the doors open and walks inside the room.
“Hmm,” Larry says, a mock-deliberating expression on his face. “Tempting.”
He takes a look around the engine after, studying how these models differ from the modern versions he’s used to. He’s distracted, messing around in car inwards, so he doesn’t notice when he stops being alone in the room.
His lungs are burning. They’re on fire. He can’t breathe. Why can’t he breathe? Everything is on fire. He jerks his arms forward, brings them up to claw at his throat but they just hit something hard and solid.
not his style. He should probably find a job.
He’s burning, he’s on fire-- he’s drowning.
He’ll just try and live in the now for the time being; telling himself that everything about his situation is temporary and all he needs is a lab and a few weeks of caffeine fueled benders to get back to his world and version of events. Denial, it’s not just a river in Egypt.
The warehouse plant had shown the next room as another simple division of the building, but if he were conducting super secret bad-guy power experiments, he would definitely do it in the fortified heavy concrete vault omitted in the plants.
Rogers has paused in front of him, his confusion so obvious it’s almost audible in the air. Tony powers the repulsors down and lets his arms fall back to his sides as he heads towards the table and the mystery device.
The stray sits on its hind legs a couple feet away, a seemingly offended and hurt expression on its face as it stares at him with an unsettlingly accusing pair of bright amber eyes.
Tony lets his nose lead him to the kitchen, pays the cook for a plate of his own and goes sit down next to the others. He would prefer to keep to a corner and mind his own business, but there aren’t exactly unpopulated spaces in this room -- it’s too small, especially considering the number of people in it.
Maybe this is a second chance, after all.
He’s stuck, in what appears to be New York city of the 1940s. He has no idea how he got here, but he knows that he got drunk in his lab the night before, which meant he probably tried to do some drunk science.
. Give me a few minutes with one of these cars and I’ll show you just how good I am.”
He takes another twenty minutes to reach the Brooklyn bridge, but when he does, he stops for a few seconds, taking in the view.
“Jarvis, buddy. Tell me that’s not what I think it is,” Tony pleads, ignoring Rogers’ continuously increasing questions.
As he reaches the place he was directed to, he starts noticing signs announcing a boarding house with vacancies and breathes a sigh of relief.
That would take a few years at best, though, and Tony… wasn't sure how he felt about that. Or rather, he knew how he felt and just didn’t want to think about it too closely, because it brought abject terror to mind.
“All of it?”
Clarity floods his brain, sharp and sudden like a bolt of lightning, and he knows what he has to do.
Maybe if he gets drunk enough, he’ll wake up back in his home and everything will have been a stupid dream. Hey, it’s worked once before.
“Stay in the quinjet, then,” Tony bites out, rolling his eyes as he turns his back and starts heading towards the building’s entrance. “Close the ramp and turn up the heaters, I’ll be back in a jiffy.”
Rogers lifts his shield and brings it crashing down on the fortified steel door in an impressive display of strength and speed -- well, it
Barnes frowns, probably because of Tony’s sudden change in demeanor, and lets go of his hand, stepping back.
Another dead end. Great.
Tony rolls his eyes and turns his back on the obviously crazy man. He’s about to walk away when something strangely familiar gives him pause.
“No, sir. The building appears to remain unoccupied. I do not detect any traces of telecommunications, radiation or power surges in the vicinity,” the AI recounts, pulling up scan results to illustrate his calculations.
He takes about two minutes to figure out how to operate the old system, and soon enough, he has the car enough of a height up to look for the alternator.
He opens his wallet and counts what he still has in it. A couple crumpled fifty-dollar notes and a hundred-dollar one, plus some spare change. Good, that should be enough to get him home. He just had to find out where here was, hopefully he was still in New York.
Between an alcoholic hallucination and the very improbable possibility of time travel, the former was honestly sounding more plausible. Maybe he’d finally lost his mid.
“Sir?”
“That bad, huh?”
“Stark!” he hears Rogers’ angered shout from behind him, rising in volume as he ignores the calls and continues forward. “Get back here!”
Tony slid up to sitting, his legs around Steve’s hips, with a sinuous slide of his body against Steve’s spent and sensitive cock.  “Wanna…?”
“You were snubbed in the Heisman voting, and everyone had the Longhorns as underdogs.  How did it feel to come in here and prove everyone wrong?”
Thanks, as always, to the incomparable Betheflame for absolutely stellar handholding and cheer-reading.  Thank you to Stella, for helping me get my head on straight about how to actually *show* this chapter instead of telling.
baby, I called you
She nodded.  “He really is.  New coach, new scheme, a lot of holes to fill.”
Monty’s head disappeared back inside the window, and Steve collapsed on the front steps.  Dum Dum pulled open the door and just stood in the doorway staring at him. “You okay, there?”
“Just like we discussed,” Steve said as he got comfortable.  “I sent you the image of the logo while we were on the phone so you could pull what you needed.”
Steve nodded, still trying to ignore the feeling of eyes on the back of his neck.  “Lay on, Macduff.”
“If I knew, I wouldn’t be ask--” he scowled down at his vibrating phone and tapped the answer button.   “Hello?”
“Fuck,” Bucky muttered before he turned a winning smile on Fitz, Hopkins, and Sam.  “You guys just gotta put more points up then.”
A woman with a New York Post press pass stuck her phone forward.  “Mr. Stark, anything you can tell us about why you selected Rogers over other available quarterbacks like Rumlow?”
Steve nodded.  “I can believe that.  I’ve been sore, but not
Steve laughed, bright and happy.  “You’ll give a guy ideas talkin’ like that.”
Steve nodded.  He really did.  “I’m not...I don’t worry about saying or doing the wrong thing with you.  It’s easy.”
“That’s part of what made him hard to get a handle on.  He’s not afraid to become a run option himself.”  Steve gestured towards the Serpents’ sideline.  “Plus, Schmidt seems like he’s running a similar style of offense to what Rumlow left, so there’s less of a learning curve.”
Reply from
Steve sighed.  “Can we not do this here?”
“Nice to meet you,” Steve replied, still shaking Scott’s hand.  He glanced over at Sam, willing him to come to his rescue, but Sam just shrugged, suddenly deeply interested in the contents of his backpack.
She laughed.  “He’s a commodities broker if you can believe that.”
While they waited on the elevator, Tony tangled his fingers with Steve’s.  “You’re sure I can’t convince you to let me call you a car?”
about?”
Sharon reached out to grab his wrist.  “Since this week has been largely ramp-up, we’ve kept the media out, but you can expect time with them starting on Monday.  We’ll have a quick meeting before your first session, though, so you’ll know what to expect.”
“I would never!” Tony objected with a laugh.
“Fair,” Steve murmured to the partially reassembled handlebars in front of him.
“Hey, Mr. Rogers,” Peter said from down on the floor where he was examining the open front of the copier.  “You need help with something?”
“That’s very true,” Tony nodded.  He sidled up under Steve’s arm again as they made their way slowly towards the elevator.  “I don’t belong to my company and my name’s on the damn door, so you should certainly have more leeway.”
“Nice jersey, by the way,” Steve murmured as they finally broke free of the postgame gridlock.
“Alright, alright,” Tony flapped his hand. “No need to rub it in.”
Steve nodded then swiped at his eyes.  “Will you tell me something else?” he asked, in an effort to shift focus back off himself.
“You want to come hang around in the heat while I install a handlebar switch kit?  Tell me how I’m doing everything wrong?” he offered.
