He turned the water on in the shower, stepping in as soon as he could stand it. It wasn’t quite the relaxing soak he had been looking forward to (because
"Suck it." Dean told him, and Cas looked at him, eyes confused with a tiny bit of hurt. He'd heard Dean say that before, enough to know that it was generally an insult. Dean backtracked. "No, I mean it. Suck your finger. Spit heals, or something."
Cas hummed softly, finally stepping in to take his seat. Dean instantly served him a hot waffle and watched as Cas pulled the bacon forwards too. A savory day, then.
with this all the time, he wondered as he continued to work himself, his free hand holding firm onto the shower pole. Today when sparring with Dean he was aware of it, thankful for the tough denim of his jeans and his jacket containing the simmering of swelling. Did the Winchesters have to deal with this on every hunt, arousal as their bodies simply
“That seems like a stereotype.” Cas grumbled.
Bill smiled. "I am very lucky."
"His time isn't infinite." Anna told him. "Especially not out there."
It was definitely not as garish as Cas’s sweater, bright yellow with a bee printed on the front. Wow.
"He usually wears a tux." Dean joked. Cas looked vaguely uncomfortable and looked down at his suit, before Dean cleared his throat, gesturing at a photo on the shelf of Bill and a younger woman. "Is that your daughter?"
“Can we go inside? Or is a boulder gonna come and Raiders me as a final test?”
They didn’t.
“And if I do something that you don’t want to do?”
"We're not killing her!" Sam protested. "Not unless we have to. And right now, we don't."
“Right…” Sam was still frowning, trying to piece it together. Surely if Dean hadn’t said anything, she would’ve said that, right?
"The one who smelt it dealt it, Sammy." Dean retorted defensively.
"What do you want, Chuck?" Dean reminded, already weary of the conversation.
"Dean-"
"And how do we get past?" Sam said.
"Did you hear me asking you to stop?" The angel said kindly. Livvie finally looked at her, confused by the passivity in the angels tone. "It is you who seems to be unhappy at the circumstance."
“I’d apologise, but you didn’t exactly come across as friendly.”
His hand lingered in Cas's hair for a minute, teasing the strands there for a few seconds, and exhaled. Dean had tried his best to make Cas look like he was only sleeping, that he would wake up any second, but even that looked wrong. Cas never used to sleep, Cas would barely blink. Dean took a deep breath in, trailed his fingers down the man's cheek, and checked his pulse again. Still there, still beating.
“But we can’t just keep running.” He shook his head, staring out at the road before reaching for their Dad’s journal again, like he didn’t know the contents by heart. Oh, god, just ask him. He cleared his throat, staring steadfastly at the journal. “Cas, you worked with the dick, you have to know
"Throw that Bible away too, if it offends you so much."
Fuck, he was fed up of them being miserable. He saw the way Cas’s eyes lit up when he asked him to pick out furniture, made sure he
"Oh, crap." Dean muttered. "Call you back."
He stepped forward again, this time stood close, towering over her, looking down his nose to her. "I will still be there. I am not my powers."
Cas looked up, eyes a little bleary from having been focused on the screen for the past two hours, unsure of what to do with the unfocused ache in them.
He took his mouth away, breathing in deep again, before repeating the action, watching Cas's chest. Obediently it rose.
"It is none of your concern." He told her.
“Cas, what are you saying?” Sam asked, cutting off Dean’s retort.
Cas's face fell. "Do you think I should leave?"
"Every night."
“You good with getting him out?” Dean asked Sam, and Sam had flashed a confused look to Dean, before shrugging and leading Crowley out, slowed by each door-frame’s individual devil trap, but quickly figuring out a method of disentangling him each time. This was, very firmly, not a place that welcomed demons.
"He just went out last night, vanished." Sam told him. "When you got in you were bitching about him, saying you'd seen him."
"He's quiet now." She explained, and Gabriel rolled his eyes.
It was like when the light turned on, something switched on in the brothers. Cas, though no expert in body language or facial expressions, could see the difference in them, could see the strain of the day ease off them and and excitement take over. Cas could tell it was grander than what they were used to, that it wasn’t the type of place they would come across often, and the library certainly held intrigue to him. But it was the joy in Dean and Sam that made Cas smile, not the books.
“See?” She punched him in the arm. “You had nothing to worry about!”
When Livvie turned round, the angel had vanished. Dead, or in heaven, she didn't know.
Dean shone the light aside, following the upper level along, spotting a table and chairs that had been abandoned. An old cup of coffee had long since run dry, the tide mark showing the years. It sat next to a half played game of chess, and this weren’t no dime store set. “This was just left,” Dean said, flicking an old white cigarette butt in a silver ashtray. “What the hell happened here?”
“Dean.” He corrected.
"You fell?" Dean repeated, unable to believe it? "Since when do angels-" He stopped himself, realising his exact phrasing. That was an entirely different question. "Since when do you have an inner ear problem?"
Dean was gonna prove him wrong.
He didn't want to think about the fact that he'd probably been calling for the angel in his sleep.
As soon as it was clear Crowley was on his way out, Dean shut the door, blocking the sound from reaching the corridor. He walked towards Cas, jaw gritted tight, and worry etched into his brow, his eyes. “Are you really okay with this?” Dean asked, and Cas felt a flare of surprise.
"It's this body. It's fighting against me."
“Which side was he on?” Dean asked.
The girl left, and the silence at the table resumed. After a few seconds, Dean huffed and stood up without a word, heading towards the bathroom. Sam and Cas sat awkwardly.
“Thank you.” Cas settled. “I don’t understand fashion, so I just chose clothes which would fit.”
After a quick lunch, they drove back across town, pulling up outside the tattoo parlour. He could see a woman with two children clearly on the way back from the shops, a man jogging, a woman walking her dogs.
“This, you,” Dean took a deep breath, steadying himself, fists clenched on the table. “You look good, Cas, you always do.”
"No, but you need something to sleep in." Sam shrugged. "Doubt Dean will want to bunk with you if you're sleeping naked." Sam smirked, and Cas glanced up. There was that smile again.
"As its functionality isn't altered by its position, I'm indifferent." He explained, moving on to a picture of a heart with a knife stuck through it.
His face was painted. No, not painted, made up. He was wearing make-up.
Cas tilted his head, in such a familiar way that Dean smiled. There he was, his angel. “Am I?”
,” He repeated fondly. “It’s vindicating to know that’s not purely platonic.”
"Yeah, but, you know." Dean shrugged, before he realised Cas probably didn't. He didn't keep the same outfit every day out of preference, it just had never occurred to him to change. "You'll be fine." He smiled reassuringly.
“You do not think I am capable of hunting. You have implied over and over again that I will get myself or Sam hurt, or killed.”
“I think the place will want us to dress kinda nice? So like, whatever.”
You’d think the one thing he couldn’t fuck up would be an offer for a hook up, but he had pretty effectively proven himself wrong there. Repeatedly and consistently. It had taken him long enough to figure out that yes, he was buying what Cas was selling, but also long enough for him to put up so many roadblocks in his own way that he would need a fucking bulldozer to get through. And Baby was no bulldozer.
"Dean?"
"Well, the boys aren't that dim, are they?" She smiled. She pulled out her phone from her pocket and dialled a number. After a couple of rings, it was answered.
"Clearly." She bristled at the mention of Balthazar.
Dean frowned. "Shut up." He muttered angrily, leaning back into her lips, his hands now moving down to her waist, tugging her forward and off of the stool. She giggled as she landed on the floor, falling into his chest, her hands catching on his shirt and clinging on.
He’d been toying with the idea of getting a waffle maker, the proper electric ones, but damn the waffle skillet in the cupboard was just a classic. He grinned as he heard the first sizzle, quickly using the time to get out the yoghurt and berries from the fridge for Sam, and flipped the bacon for himself. He didn’t know which Cas would prefer this morning, he tended to flip between sweet and savory, but hopefully something would catch his fancy. Dean tugged on the bell chain next to the stove and heard the echo of it in the next couple of rooms, alerting the whole bunker that grub was up, and he chewed his lip, suddenly nervous.
Dean's mind started to drift back to Cas. For the millionth time, he went through their resources, their guns, their hunting equipment, their friends, their connections, their powers.
“I don’t wanna get into it.” Dean sighed, waving his brother off. “Just one night, come on.”
“One club’s the same as the next. Keep an eye out for your fire exits, don’t let anyone touch your drink.” His forehead creased in worry for a second. “Actually pay attention to that one, you hear me?”
Dedicating this chapter to my lovely friend Cat whose birthday is today.
Cas nodded, stepping aside and turning to Sam. "Goodnight." He sighed, stifling a yawn, and Sam smiled back in return. They both listened as Cas climbed the steps, the plodding footsteps echoing in the creaking cabin.
Dean blinked, looking away. “We’re cool, Cas.” He told him, shaking off the attention.
and current. All your aliases, all your license plates, everything.”
"The Bible."
"One moment." He said. He neatened the pictures, putting them back in the positions that he had found them in, and clasped it all back together. He then walked back to the bedroom and returned it to its place, next to the bed. If Bill were to look for the hair any time soon, he would be disappointed, but until then, he could keep things just the way they were.
He didn’t cry, not today. Just the quick flow of in, out, in, out of breath through his gritted teeth as his pulse slowed back down and his hands throbbed. His knuckle ached where he struck the bowl. His chest hurt, his jaw, his head felt fuzzy.
He heard movement, and glanced up, though was unable to see anything in the dark. Pausing, he could hear the slight rustling of sheets, the uneven breathing. Cas wasn't asleep. Sighing, Dean continued his journey onto the recliner, lying back and pulling the blanket over himself, the cool on his legs, though it would warm up soon. Only after he had settled, after he had found a position that was comfortable, did Dean speak.
“Still managed the avocado though, huh?” Dean jibed, and Sam glared across at him. “No, you did good. We didn’t know where we were landing up, I figured it was gonna be a motel or something.”
Crowley held up his hands in surrender, watching as Dean lowered the bow. “It was worth a try. A body part? Some evidence of torture?”
"I don't know if he's an angel anymore." Dean pointed out.
Cas glanced at Dean as he plucked it away, distrust at the thin slab of plastic coming off Cas in waves. “Yes.”
“Hello?” Sam answered the phone, keeping it vague until they could place them; answering with a name could just confuse the situation, they’d likely used fakes. Detective Ballard… it rang a bell, but they’d met so many cops over the years, had saved tons of numbers. Some were in the know, but plenty weren’t.
“Key word: playing. It’s not.” He told her. He drained his coffee, glancing behind him at the open door. “I’m gonna check on Cas.”
“You’re such a mother hen.” She told him affectionately.
of detail…” He held up his hands in defence. “You guys have a good night?”
Writing can be so weird... you think you're writing a nice scene about their Mom, and then all of a sudden they're talking about BDSM? Guys, it's a cemetery.
Dean jumped. Cas hadn't spoken since the motel room. He didn't reply.
“That’s a Christening dress.” Sam told him. “For babies in church.”
Charlie asked, and Dean rolled his eyes. “
A demon in front of him spoke. "The boys speak too loudly." He said simply. "You may as well have said it over the intercom."
"All done." She repeated, a little too chipper. "I'll give you two a minute." She walked out of the door, closing it behind her.
"Show time." Dean commented.
She rolled her head and moaned, stirring in her sleep.
Sam swore as he fished around for their Dad’s journal, as if they hadn’t memorised the contents by now. He hissed around the wound in his shoulder, and Cas searched in the glove compartment for the slapdash first aid kit he’d spotted earlier, handing it back to him.
“Yeah, well, being dead will do that.” He shrugged, and Charlie winced, looking at him with apology written all over her face.
Dean pulled him forwards. “Two, for my buddy and me.” Dean explained, nodding to Cas for the bouncer as he pulled cash out for entry. Cas watched, baffled, as someone pressed a stamp to the back of his hand, leaving a dark imprint of what appeared to be a rooster. They did the same for Dean, who smiled good naturedly as he tugged Cas inside.
that Dean wanted him to have a home there. He wanted to put that smile on Cas’s face every damn day. Even if Cas figured out what Dean really was, how much he could offer, how broken he really was… even if Cas walked away one day. If Cas wanted him today, how could he say no?
He answered, and Dean nodded, reaching for a sticky menu, grimacing as it tacked to his fingertips. He pointed at something which Cas couldn’t see in this light so he shrugged, which Dean accepted, and he started trying to get the bartender’s attention.
“Didn’t say you were.” Dean grumbled, testing against Cas again, but he Cas could feel it was a halfhearted attempt. Sure, if Dean really tried he could get out of this, but the fact that right now he was resigning himself to it, just letting it happen… that was good enough. It felt good.
"This accessory is problematic." Cas said as he struggled to put on the tie. Dean stood up, readjusting his jeans, walking over to him, focusing hard on the tie.
Alone, good. He had been right before, he needed to get this out of his system, now.
The brothers glanced at one another, and Sam cleared his throat. “That’s, uh, pretty big.”
Cas scoffed, looking down at the water. “You were terrified of me to start with, of all angels.”
[08:45 AM] Sammy: Definitely not my room.
"No, no I don't-" The prophet stumbled.
She paused, weighing him up, and he waited, taking a slow sip of whiskey. It wasn’t as good as the old stuff in the bunker, but what was? “Rough day
Cas was like glue against him, as determined as possible to have as much body contact as possible, and Dean was on board as all hell with it. The flat planes of his chest, the slight muscle in the pecs pressed against him, it was a little weird that he hadn’t noticed how little he noticed the difference. Usually tits would be a prime focus, a barrier between them and something fun as all hell to play with, but the lack of them didn’t leave Dean feeling like he was missing anything, and that realisation was fucking thrilling.
"Jeez, Cas; give a guy some warning!"
He looked at the bed and could see smears of dark makeup on the pillow case, swearing again. He stripped the bed, checking that the pillow underneath was clean, and held it in a bundle to his chest. He headed to the utilities room, chucking it in the machine to clean them, before heading to the kitchen. He still felt unsettled, and he took a deep breath before strolling in, grinning as he saw three people inside.
"Lookin' good." Dean commented, watching as under Kirsty's careful hands the pattern slowly came to life. She paused, stopping to mop the design, wiping away the dark mix of ink and blood, and he smiled, leaning back round to look at Cas. He felt a surge of pride as he watched his friend, knuckles white around the armrests of the chair, forehead slightly shiny with sweat, hunched over, shying away from the pain. He hadn't said one word of complaint since the ordeal had started, and Dean knew that he wouldn't utter a single one. It had to hurt, a lot; the former angel, still so unused to his body, must be feeling everything so acutely, in such detail.
. And to Dean, not just that, but the notion of masculinity, of control, so deeply tied in. Cas knows that handing that over is something Dean would have never done, it was too important. And Dean was still silent.
"I had other things on my mind than-" He started, but was quickly cut off by her lips on his again.
Her original was strong and present, the fighter, the copy of the weapon keeper of heaven; the strong, prepared one. But there was a new presence there now, a new aspect of her, however small, trying to make its voice heard; Zedkiel, the angel of forgiveness, was throwing her off balance. Livvie was now the proverbial lover and the fighter.
She held on tight as she felt him twitch, mouth gaping but nothing passing through, and his body strained, gasping for air in a place which had none. Something appeared to change, his hand flew to his mouth as if he felt something there, and for a few seconds he looked at peace, the tension gone.
Oh, he liked it. There it was again, that flare of arousal in his gut, the tightening in his chest, not to mention his pants. He shifted, and Dean smirked as he made a decision “I raise.”
Not even angels.
“Go on. You good to drive?”
“Yes, you wouldn’t want another regret.” Cas looked away, moving on to the next stall.
Dean raised an eyebrow. “What we talking?”
The smile lingered on Sam's lips after she left. He always felt smug when a woman chose to spend her attentions on him instead of his brother when given the choice; it was a fairly rare occurrence.
The woman had gasped when he had begun defacing the book, and at his last words she rung the bell beneath the desk for assistance. Flipping the page, Cas surveyed the book.
The bar was fairly quiet, it being only just five in the afternoon, but he guessed it would get busier as the night went on. Friday's were busy for bars.
She frowned. “Clone?”
“We’ve got nothing.” Dean sighed out, barely meaning to, and Sam looked up at him, satisfied with the first couple of stitches Cas had started, probably only another three or four. “We’ve lost everyone, everywhere. We don’t have anywhere left.”
A deep
Something that might have been a whimper came out of his throat, his chest, and he flinched when Cas clasped his hands on Dean’s biceps. Warm, hot actually, hot hands, radiating through his robe.
"No." Cas told him. "I have nothing like that."
The room shone with the effort as he gave the last of himself. He poured his power into the wound, fusing and healing it, shaking profusely.
And in return? Dean couldn’t even be honest with him. With himself. About what he actually wanted. Over and over again he’d said no, that he didn’t want Cas, even after he’d got on his fucking
"Another couple' pack of sixes." Dean suggested, raising the bottle, ignoring Sam's glance in his direction. He knew what he'd see there.
"Yeah, good as he ever was. Not sure how Livvie is, though."
"Crowley." Cas repeated dully.
He reached for the door and flung it open, holding it with a foot as he projected his voice into the hallway. "Dinnertime!"
"From what? Sleeping for days?" He scoffed, before pointing at the screen. "I'm educating the guy!" He looked back at Cas, a grin on his face as he looked to his friend. But, even Dean admitted, he looked beat. Eyes puffy and slightly bloodshot, squinting slightly as he tried to focus. Dean sighed, reaching for the remote and hitting the pause button. "Ah, fine, go to bed."
Dean nodded, absentmindedly scratching the stubble along his jaw. "Do you think he can be possessed?"
or some shit.
He moved backwards, scrabbling for the door handle and quickly opened it. Cold air flooded the car, and Livvie shuddered.
When had he started thinking of him as
"Maybe she's counting on us not caring one way or another if she kills the son of a bitch."
"Worth a try." Dean said, jumping out of the car instantly, quickly followed by Sam. He barely glanced around at the car park, heading straight for the footpath, heart thumping in his chest. He felt sure that Cas would be here, he was sure that as soon as he rounded the corner, as soon as he peered through that mesh fence he would see his friend in the worn out suit by the water. He would be there. He would be.
Cas looked at her, trying to piece together her words. “You’re not dating Dean?”
"Idjits."
“But she knew about Leviathans,” Dean pointed out. “And Borax. She said this was happening
” He asked, growling in Cas’s ear, and Cas frowned. The man pulled back, waiting for an answer.
The girl blinked, peering out of the window. Watching the sunrise with wide eyes, full of wonder and light, and a million-million years. Sighing slightly, she looked back to the woman in front of her, the young lady with big plans. "I hope I do you some good."
Cas blinked, processing. “It can be a psychological response to trauma…”
Sam didn't look happy, but left it. It was Cas's neck on the line, but if he was so certain...
But he was strong and she was weak. She couldn't do anything to hurt him; him or his little once-hit-twice-shy puppy dogs. Not until she was strong again; she could destroy him then.
"What, what?"
The journey back to the bunker was quiet, but happy. They were both smiling, exchanging words every now and then, but over the years they had grown so comfortable on these journeys, often so long and endless, that the space between them was just as friendly as the words. As twee as it sounded, they held hands, or rather Cas held Dean’s hand while he drove. It was as though now Cas was given the okay he didn’t want to let go, something that Dean found himself understanding completely. When their hands separated briefly to change gears or flick the turn signal his hand felt cold, and Dean laughed as he grabbed Cas’s hand back. When Cas pressed a soft kiss to his knuckles he laughed again.
“Not sure you’re gonna make that meeting,” Dean sighed as he picked up the Michael Crossbow, his new favourite weapon. “Gonna be pretty hard getting back to it, what with being dead. ”
His breathing appeared to have slowed, less laboured as he looked at Dean, as he took in the smile, the happiness, the relief so evident in his face. He smiled, a slow lifting of his features into an expression that was so rarely worn on the features that he looked like a brand new man.
“Detective Diana Ballard. Or Agent, whatever.”
“I mean, for a while?”
In the last few weeks he’d been closer, physically, to Cas than he had in all the time they’d known each other. So many reasons to need to touch, acceptable reasons to hold eye contact, to stand close. Sure, Cas had never known much about personal space before, but now it was Dean who kept breaking those boundaries.
“Please, I was only trying to kill what’s left of the angel. You two lugheads were just in the way. I figured I was doing you a favour; he screwed you over just as hard!” He gestured over at Cas. “Or have you forgotten the year of lying, the botched rescue, oh, and what am I forgetting… the Leviathan?”
Dean had already set up the area while Cas had been getting dressed, and he beckoned him over. They were stood next to the car, trunk open to reveal the collection of weapons stored inside. In his hand was a gun, one that Cas recognised as one of Dean's, silver, with a pearl grip. He frowned at it, looking at Dean warily.
"Next left." Sam said, the first words spoken in the car in 20 minutes. Dean had thought Sammy was asleep as well, and had known to take the turn anyway, but he nodded as he turned the wheel. They had switched cars an hour or so back, stealing one left on the side of the road. They’d ditch it again in a while.
The kitchen had faded, the scorched wing prints nothing more than a dim shadow in the bleached surroundings. He knew there had to be more to this. They began to walk, a slow leisurely pace, ambling towards nowhere.
He heard Charlie chuckle. “
“Eating people.” She said, face dropping. “To start with I thought it was just like a joke, or a fetish, you know, except I saw a video. This guys face just like
Packing as many of her father's weapons as she could, and putting the rest into storage, she left. Life was not easy for her; without the safety of her family or a home, she learnt quickly how to survive on the streets, a skill that she never managed to properly hone whilst she had her safety nets. She dabbled with prostitution for money, but mostly could manage to get bar work, or hustle cards or pool to get cash.
He was thinking that, he was thinking that at Cas. If Cas could still hear prayers it would’ve rung like a bell.
Thump
"Well, it's easy to say that now."
"Morning." He heard his brother say across the room, and he blinked up, seeing the guy apparently fresh from the shower, hair still shiny with water. He nodded, heading for the kitchen, before seeing Cas on the sofa, turned towards Dean in greeting, a soft smile on his face. He still didn't have a top on, and from this angle, Dean could almost see all the way down to his waist. He blinked again, realising he'd stopped in his journey, and looked away, grabbing the coffee that was hot and waiting for him.
decided to knock them all off."
Dean swallowed again, the movement stilted with Cas’s fingers still clamped around the bone. “Cas, you better stop that unless you really do wanna go for a motel.”
Cas hummed as he walked along the stalls, looking at the courgettes, the eggplants, asparagus. Lots of green stuff Dean generally didn’t eat, though could probably figure out how to make it taste edible. “You might have a point.” Cas quietly conceded, and Dean felt a flash of surprise. “The scientific advancement in that time frame has been substantial.”
"The purpose of this isn't to improve my vessel aesthetically." He reminded him, and Dean shrugged.
Cas was still staring at Dean, and he met his eyes again. His eyes were
"Oh, dear." The angel shrugged. "Because, what else is there to do?"
"Fine." Dean barked.
"She's not done it yet, then," Sam pointed out. "Killed him."
"Right. Clothes." Dean agreed, not looking back to Cas. He didn't need to see any more of the practically naked man, wet and dripping... "I'll go get some."
By now they were in the foyer and rapidly approaching the doors to the car park.
“Yeah,” He sighed, looking up at the stars, barely visible under the streetlights. “But I do.”
Cas was almost frozen, his eyes searching Dean in that way that always felt like he was looking straight down into his soul. Dean felt so small under that look, he’d jibe it away and pretend like he was wigged out but really it was always so uncomfortable, scary, to feel so
She sighed, shaking her head. "I don't know the answer, honey; it's one tough cocoon to break out of."
Dean's face twisted at the question, suddenly realising the tight spot he was in. How could he truthfully say how he found out?
“It could be a neighbour.” Cas suggested, and they both looked at him incredulously. “Or someone who uses the area to imbibe.”
“Yuhuh.”
Sam shook his head, baffled. “Last I checked, Cas is the one who literally needs to stay here?”
“Cas, I wasn’t not happy you were back-”
"Yeah, that's what I figured." Dean sighed. "This don't exactly come with a how-to guide."
Dean didn’t say anything, watching as she turned back to the laptop, pulling the page open. “It’s got bones, and it’s pretty adaptive, there’s just stuff out there that it’s not pulling from because it didn’t exist yet.”
"So how did today go?" Sam asked. "Dean wasn't a complete dick, was he?"
Cas blinked, clearly taken aback. Suddenly the question felt underhanded, cruel. “He was a kind man.”
“I don’t have anything on my hand, Dean.” Cas said, not looking away from him, his eyes drilling holes in the side of Dean’s head. That makes sense, actually; the positions they were in didn’t really lend itself to Cas getting - no, stop. No replays.
"Seriously?" Dean asked as Cas stood there, almost dropping a shirt with, swear to freaking God, frills. "You want everything there?"
Balthazar knew there were demons there before he saw them. Hundreds. The vast majority of the demons in the hospital had congregated here, ready to attack en masse. They had heard the boys talking about their plan, to go to the supply cupboard, to make a bomb. All it takes is one demon with good hearing to pass on the message. Crowley's fool proof plan.
Dean admired her choice in car. Blood red and sleek, clearly expensive, it was hardly the most professional car to steal. But Olivia didn't seem to care about that sort of thing. If she wanted to steal a sports car, apparently she would.
Silence rung through again, and he heard the unmistakable sound of a sniff, striking him deep to the core. He wasn't good with tears, with crying, and while he was used to guilt, he wasn't great at handling it either. "Cas, will you- will you quit crying?!" He snapped, and he practically
(See the end of the chapter for
Finally Dean talked the subject dry, and silence fell again. Cas still didn’t know where they were going and anxiety swirled in his gut, unknowing as to whether to feel hope or dread. Time to bite the bullet.
There was silence for a moment, but Dean wasn't fooled. After spending most of his life sleeping in the same room as his little brother, he knew when someone was sleeping and when they weren't. Eventually, Cas moved again, the sheets rustling as he adjusted his weight. "The cabin has thin walls."
“I’ve been learning about local pollinating communities.” Cas told him, gesturing to his own canvas bag full of seeds and bug boxes. “I don’t think Dean grasps how important they are to the ecosystem.”
He’d managed to just about get through last night by just powering through in some almost manic haze, playing round after round of poker, quick fire, not caring about winning or losing so long as the laughs kept coming and the action didn’t stop for a minute. Sam had played along too, probably loving seeing his brother so dang happy for once, but there was only so long he could actually wring this out.
Dean gripped the railing tight, holding himself from reaching out to Cas. And then he realised, so slowly and all in a rush… he really didn’t want to hold himself back any more. He peeled his fingers off of the wooden beam and moved, pushed against muscles that were telling him to run and forced his hand forward, placing it over Cas’s own. His hand was warm, and Dean could feel the bones of his knuckles under his fingertips. Maybe if he tried he would find his pulse under there, sure and true and proving that this was Cas, alive and his.
They were gone, their one remaining refuge lost. Nowhere to go but the road.
“Maybe. Can you just do a sweep, just in case?”
"It's punctured his lung." Cas stated, keeping his voice level, clinical.
In torturing Cas.
It turned out that a simple hormone pill that Penny took prevented them from spawning. For a long time this worked. Then one time, after she had drunk too much at some social event or other, she vomited, expelling the pill from her system. This one time had been enough. A month later Penny told Balthazar she was pregnant.
There weren't any spells, artefacts, anything to wake a comatose person.
“Yeah.” Dean cleared his throat. “Besides, you’re telling me when you beat me half to death you
"What are you thinking, Sammy?" Dean asked, suddenly short tempered. Sam remembered Dean's threat, that they must never be mentioned again. He regretted bringing them up, now of all times. "That I find a nice girl and settle down with her? Have a few kids? We can't have the apple pie life, you know that."
"Jeez!" She sat up, leaning against the door. "After the way you were looking at me in that diner, I thought that after all that, at least I was gonna get laid! Turns out, you were just perving on the man inside my skin."
"Come on." Dean said, standing up. "Let's get back."
respect?
“Dean, are you panicking?”
She’d said, and he’d been grateful. He remembered that dim awareness that this was something he wouldn’t have the courage to do, to let happen if he’d been sober, but he’d been happy.
“M’not.”
"So. You're back." Dean spoke, and the angel turned to look at him.
Cas still hadn't said anything to merit Dean staying in an enclosed space with a half naked man, and once again he was on the verge of leaving before deciding to push it just a little bit further.
It would feel good enough that it wouldn’t feel bad till much later.
"Precisely." Castiel agreed. "But they are exaggerated."
"Mmhmm." He confirmed. "It was my first lead, too; people complaining about the sky high price of parking for the woods, yet apparently there's no formal group running parking schemes in the area." Garth explained, sounding fairly smug at himself, as he, as Sam suspected, repeated what he'd been told.
Oh, but he could remember some of it viscerally. The cold concrete under his needs, the stretch of his mouth, the feel of flesh kneaded under his fingernails. He wondered if he left marks, little crescents on the back of Cas’s thighs. He probably did. He never got to see them. They’d be long gone now.
"You know he's dead?"
Sam held his position for a few more seconds, before starting to laugh. "If this ends up being nothing, I am going to be so pissed."
"How many?" He whispered, and Cas shook his head.
"You-?"
"Or we take a holiday." Sam finished.
“I wasn’t experiencing sexual arousal at that time.” Cas told him simply, and Dean nodded reasonably, looking out across the cemetery. “Angels aren’t designed to be sexual beings, it didn’t translate like that.”
"Speak for yourself." He chuckled, to which Sam laughed a little too loudly in response. Dean turned, a little confused, unused to Sam laughing so much to a crude joke. Mind you, those jokes were usually at Sam's expense; perhaps he found them more entertaining when he was not on the receiving end. Cas, having grown used to jokes being made that flew over his head, didn't pay much heed, though suspected Sam's reaction was more due to his interpretation, rather than Dean's initial statement. The intricacies of their human jokes, their quickfire wit honed from years of familiarity and human society was something that over the years he had come to appreciate more and more, enjoying them when he caught them, though was often content to appreciate their fun without participating. Now it was beginning to nick at his curiosity, and he knew that some of their laughter was at him, about him. Should he be offended, or laugh along? Would he start to understand their looks, their inside jokes, perhaps even make some?
"So what'd she say?"
"Jeez!"
They’d hit up the grocery store in a minute. The thrift shop was open, it had weird opening hours and they hadn’t manage to catch it yet. Thrifting tended to be a good shout for easy clothes top-ups and boosting Dean’s cassette collection, and they hadn’t yet accidentally bought a haunted item. Yet. This one was pretty big, spread across three floors, and they headed straight for the second floor, men’s clothing and bric-a-brac.
"So where do you want it?" Dean asked, looking at Cas as he wandered the room, peering at the displays of generic tattoos that were probably plastered across every wall of every tattoo parlour. Cas spared a glance to him, briefly looking away from the picture of a dolphin.
Dean could feel shifting in the bed and he grumbled. It felt too early to wake up. But the bed was warm, and he could feel the hot expanse of skin against his back, curving around him. He felt lips press against his shoulder, and even in this state he titled his head, allowing access. He hummed contentedly, wriggling back into the solid planes of flesh and muscle, feeling the hard press of something against his ass.
“Perhaps I should have taken you time travelling more often, you might have been so enamoured I could have swayed you to heaven’s cause.” He joked, and Dean huffed a laugh.
Sam rolled his eyes. "You know what I mean."
sad. “I beat you within an inch of your life.”
Here appeared to be… yup, underwhelming, which is pretty much what he expected. There weren’t any road cameras here, a bonus, but it was decrepit, grey and lifeless, even for winter. Dean couldn’t see anything except a door to what looked like the sewers and… oh.
He thought he’d been ashamed of himself for being there.
”, had let Cas believe that he didn’t want this too? Because, oh man, this felt like nothing he’d experienced before. No, that’s not entirely true. It felt like when Dad hadn’t been able to look at him, after he’d thrown him clean against the room, half choked the guy in the bed to death before kicking him out with next to nothing on. The way he’d barely checked the blow to Dean’s head hadn’t killed him, and left the room, left him to clean himself up. It felt like that.
"Because I was pissed. Livvie had just-"
"Understood."
"You shouldn't concern yourself with that." He told her, slight sarcasm coming out to play.
[08:44 AM] Sammy: Or anywhere communal.
"Dean?" Cas replied, and Dean let out a breath he didn't know he'd been holding.
“We miss you, Mom.” Sam was saying, and Dean looked back at Sam, still towering over the grave. It was true, every day. There never was a day they didn’t. It was just a part of them. Sam wouldn’t remember a day he didn’t.
“Well I’m still around.” He half joked, only half. Cas quirked an eyebrow, and Dean grinned. “Don’t usually do that, I tend to leave after the bell rings.”
Cas looked back at him with a scowl, clearly infuriated. “No- don’t misunderstand me.” He huffed out, walking to the next stall. “I asked you because I was-” He looked straight at Dean. “I
Cas looked to Dean, confusion present in his features. "There are... eight more films?" He asked, and Dean nodded.
She was home.
Dean shrugged. “In a dude’s body, anyway. He’s a multi-dimensional wave of intent, or whatever.”
Not that he was his Cas.
Dean frowned. Cas had pushed it too far. What he'd done was too bad to come back from.
"Dean!" Sam yelped.
“And you took him to get laid why, again?”
Dean was dimly aware that he wouldn't be able to say this to anyone who could actually hear. But with his best friend lying lifeless on the bed in front of him, the words could be spoken.
She wiped her eyes. "All the better for seeing you two again, but it's you I'm worried about."
Cas kept his face steady, staring the demon down. “Thank you.” He responded simply. In his periphery he saw Dean glance over, looking him up and down for a second. Yes, he had gained some muscle since becoming human, and while he knew it was a ploy, it was somewhat gratifying for Crowley to have noticed, even if Dean hadn’t. Crowley tracked Dean’s eyes with curiosity, raising an eyebrow and letting out a simple “
"He was your friend." Sam pointed out.
“Rough day at the office.” He smiled up at her, and she nodded. What day was it, even? Days of the week didn’t often mean much, sometimes on a hunt people would question why whoever they were posing to be was working on a Sunday, but generally it didn’t matter to their lives. Judging by her easy acceptance it had to be a weekday. “You alright?” He sat up a little straighter, taking her in.
on a hunt, Dean." Sam replied, picking up his bag through the window. "You just don't want to go shopping."
"The car." Dean spat back.
“Can’t you just say you talked it out? Reached a truce?” Sam asked.
“I was calling about the FBI.”
Dean was quiet, and Cas stopped studying his hands to look at him again. He was beautiful, jaw set and firm, and Cas ached to run a fingertip along it. This was hard for Dean, he knew. That was why the last few weeks had been so frustrating, to know that Dean was processing, was working through things and was in pain, and Cas couldn’t figure out how to help. Had only responded by becoming angry himself, turning that frustration outwards. They could be a trainwreck waiting to happen, couldn’t they?
"From what I could see." Cas attempted to explain. "It seems that Balthazar removed her powers."
“Man, I hope she’s safe out there.” Dean sighed, watching as the car turned a corner and was gone, out of sight.
She followed Cas when he vanished. Carved ribs couldn't keep her away, not with her power.
"I left my grenades at home." Balthazar spat back.
"Just... stay inside." Dean told him. "Until we sort her out. Stay inside."
“No I’m-”
"They continue the franchise without Spock?" Surmised Cas, looking away.
"And then he... he vanished! He just ran away and left us cleaning up after that stupid angels mess! Which, for the record, we're still doing."
you’re panicking.”
Dean winced, shaking his head at the memory.
"Yeah, I'm fully aware of who we're talking ab-"
"But, it's a paper cut!" Dean said. "You're an angel! You don't get paper cuts!"
Sunlight streamed into the corridor, and Dean heard a squeal before he could see anything, eyes adjusting to the light. Damn, maybe they weren’t getting out enough.
"Maybe." Dean said, still not trusting her. He opened her jacket and checked the pockets, and, after finding nothing but a pair of gloves, he did the same for her jeans. There was nothing but lint. He frisked her briefly, perfunctory, stopping short of getting genuinely invasive. If she was gonna get the jump on them and pull a weapon from natures pocket (through denim that tight?), props to her. "So, what do we do?"
"It keeps opening on the address for Dad's storage unit."
The only person who wasn't acting accordingly was Castiel. His eyes were wide in surprise and recognition, and he leaned forward, desperately trying to catch a better glimpse at the weapon, at what it was about to do.
“You saying I shoulda taken advantage?” Dean shot a look to Cas, half joking, flashing teeth. His face lit up warm orange under a passing streetlight. Dean looked more in control now behind the wheel, and they felt on even footing again. “What about when you do know better? Don’t want you looking back and realising I cheaped out on, on tonight.” Dean hesitated over his words, and Cas caught it. Still nervous, but bluster was pulling him through.
And then it was broken. Cas sighed, shaking his head. “You’re drunk.” He said simply, and Dean crossed his arms indignantly.
He felt Cas’s body relax back into the wall, all tension lost, and Dean bowed his head, resting it against Cas’s thigh while he caught his breath, the warm, soft solidity such comfort. A hand stroked through his hair, and he could dimly hear the sound of his name whispered in repeat like a prayer.
“Or, we can try our luck with whoever’s next in line.” Dean reminded him.
"You want me around." Cas surmised. "Even though I can't heal you when you're injured, I can't teleport-" He bit out. "I'm all but useless with no grace; I'm not the same 'Cas' you've always known."
A crackle of sound came through that sounded like a snort. “
“Dean?” She asked, and he looked down at her, his smile a little watery. “Have you ever tried make-up?”
"In theory, yes; there is a spell."
"Cas?" Dean tried again, voice unwittingly a little more pleading, trying to ignore the words that Sam had spoken that were ringing through his head. "Please, Cas?"
He went to the back of the house, remembering that was where the kitchen had been located, overlooking the rather spacious garden. He needed somewhere to hide.
Sam chuckled. “Last resort, these mean a lot to the family, plus,” He looked up at the wooden rafters. “We’d probably take the whole house down with it.”
"Yeah." Dean agreed, smiling easily at her. "It's good."
Charlie interjected. “
"Nightmares again?"
"You're performing-" Cas went to ask, but was immediately cut off, his lips sealed shut with a pinch of Livvie's fingers.
When he told her she didn't believe him. When he showed her, she fainted. When he explained what was growing inside of her, she vanished, finding herself in Vietnam. He, of course, followed her. He kept her safe. She came back, and five months later a small, baby girl was born. They named her Olivia.
"No." Sam spoke firmly. "He's not gonna die. You're not gonna let him." He gripped Dean's shoulder tight. "I'm not asking you to carry on, I'm not saying you have to go out there and kill monsters, I'm not even saying you have to cope. I'm saying you gotta be there for Cas." He held on a little tighter. "Cos you are gonna be the only one who can help him. You're the only one that counts."
John would hate what he was trying to do right now. That right now, as he was shoving down the memories, he was planning what to say to Cas. How he could move
They rode in silence for a while, listening, or not listening, to the stereo blasting out 80’s rock. The songs passed, and the scenery changed to trees instead of buildings again, back out into the sticks. But Dean, he had to say something. He needed to make this clear, that it was just once, and should be forgotten about. It needed to be said.
He wasn't going to be much good with a broken neck.
And he was gone. Dean stumbled forward, feet unsteady on the creaking wooden planks. He wheezed slightly, testing his chest, before looking up.
“What was it?” Cas asked, and Dean shook his head.
But his eyes didn't open.
"Whatever you say." He sighed.
The third town, the far end of the high street, there it was. Definitely not the type of place Dean would choose on any night out, not least because of the clientele, but it looked like it would be noisy and crowded, ripe for the pickings. The rainbow piping along the windows, the gig poster on the window advertising a drag show in a few days time, but a Magic Mike tribute tonight. Dean chuckled; perfect.
"Hello, Cas."
“Okay.” She sighed, leaning back in her seat. “After we crossed paths I went back to work, kept up the story that you guys escaped. Managed to get the trail back to Pete, so the force figured out what he did, and raised enough questions about whether or not you shot him in self defence.” She shrugged. “I kept working, started looking out for the weird cases. It was slow at first, stumbled across a vampire case a few months later, worked with a hunter, Asa, we took them out together. Figured out how to cover it up. I kept looking, eventually got recruited into the FBI, and kept finding the weird cases.”
quiet.
“The internet?” Dean repeated, looking up at Sam, panic across their faces.
"It can sometimes feel that way." Dean sympathised. He looked absently at the thermostat on the wall, tapping it intellectually, but doing nothing.
“Fancy taking this back home?” Dean whispered, and Cas scratched into Dean’s scalp. He felt himself being tugged forwards, propelled into Cas’s gravity, and Cas walked them backwards, mouths back on one another, Cas kissing like he never wanted to let go, and Dean let him lead, the movement slow but so delicious, so addictive. When Dean almost tripped Cas finally relinquished him, pulling back but keeping hold of his hand. His eyes were warm, pupils blown to black and he looked happier than Dean had ever seen him as they walked back to the car.
“They get to have a house, a family… they make it work. They have the life and don’t get run out of dodge every other week. How do they do that?”
"And that's our problem because...?" Dean shrugged.
"To Wonderland." He replied sarcastically.
otherwise. He had deep purple eye-shadow smeared above his eyes, smudged wide now, and dark shadow lining his lower lids, a lot less but smudged in a way that made his look like a damn raccoon. He leaned in and could see crap coating his eyelashes too, caked on and curving them upwards, longer
"Because she's waiting until he's human."
on his face.
Cas frowned. "How would you define 'complete dick'?"
Sam then turned to Dean.
“Unless you want me to heat up some cocoa?” Sam suggested, earning him a swat from Dean.
"I heard you gave Dean a bit of a scare." He joked, pausing at the perplexed look on his face.
"I'm sorry." He sighed, leaning forwards and taking Cas's right hand, looking at it. Experimentally he leaned further forwards and tugged on the limb, bringing the palm to meet the flesh of his shoulder. It was awkward, the other man's body unresponsive to him, but he held it there, using his free hand to clamp it down, curling the fingers around the flesh. For a second he felt a flash of familiarity, of déjà vu, of a memory he could never quite remember, and frankly, he didn't want to.
"You and Sam live on the fringes of society. It's odd that you should care so much."
"He's dead to the world for days, and all of a sudden he just wakes up?" Sam asked incredulously. He didn't miss the slight flinch at the word 'dead'.
“I’d heard about them at that point, and me and another hunter took him down. Borax, a lock box… still seems to be kicking around but in no state to do any damage.”
Somehow, Cas bought up some form of logic puzzle onto the screen. It called itself minesweeper, and after several failed attempts, he quickly worked out the technique to solve it, though was still confused as to why it would be there. Surely, with enough violence and action in the boys lives, they wouldn't play games that seemed to threaten them with explosions.
"Secura tibi facias libertate servire te rogamus," Dean inhaled in anticipation, the demons frantically trying to get some last seconds wounds in. "Audi nos."
And after one, last, fleeting glance to her, he was gone.
It wasn't how it used to be. They couldn't just slot him back in as if nothing had happened, as if Cas hadn't put the entire world in danger, as if he hadn't deceived them. Dean couldn't do that. It hurt way too much to see him, to see his bright blue eyes flashing, to see that puppy-dog demeanour of his begging for forgiveness. It hurt red-hot in anger, deep in the pit of his stomach, making him want to punch the angel, to keep hitting him until he went away again. Then Dean could go back to his routine. Dean could go back to pretending nothing had happened, and drinking himself into an even earlier grave.
Dean huffed out a laugh. “Like, uh, friends with benefits. Friends who hook up.”
"What?"
"I'm trying to find..." Sam pulled out some cheap motel stationary from one of the draws of a nightstand, and a pen to match. "Ahah!"
“Why?” Sam asked.
"Balthazar." He repeated. "You killed Balthazar."
Sam offered to recompense her for the travel, but she reassured him that one of the perks of being a psychic was being a dab-hand at scratch cards.
“The pots were here when we arrived, but I cleaned the room and bought fresh soil and seeds.” He looked over and the forlorn plant by the window, wondering if it needed more water. He’d repotted it, giving the roots more room to breathe, checked it over conscientiously for pests or rot. He thought it seemed healthier, happier, and could see it was leaning towards the light a little.
"Slow poison." Cas said. "Dehibilitating and power-stripping."
“Don’t worry, I’m a super hacker. And modest too.” She flashed a smile, but dropped it fast, weary. “Why? I work for Richard Roman Enterprises.” Sam raised his gun imperceptibly, which she clocked, not taking her eyes off of it. “Worked, even, though never quite got round to handing in my formal notice, so… cool it.”
Being possessed by an angel is no fun. The bored might daydream of it, the kinky may lust for it, some uber-religious nut jobs might love the idea of it; being so holy, so special to God, that they are chosen to be host to a celestial being, but if they ever actually had the chance... once you're in it, you'd rather be dead.
Dean glanced, but had to keep moving, keep reversing. “Crap, what’s he doing.”
Cas frowned. "I'm not sure what would constitute as a weird idea." He said. "Though some might deem breaking into a house to burn some hair as 'weird'."
“Cas.” Dean explained, and her eyebrows rose as she settled back into her chair.
, Dean sat as far away as possible from Cas. He wasn't even on the sofa tonight, instead at the table with Sam's laptop, his younger brother instead with Cas. And Dean focused,
After that he smashed a bottle against a wall. He was politely asked to leave.
All Sam knew in regards to the matter was that he just didn't know. And that he didn't care. He loved his big brother through thick and thin; Dean falling under a wider umbrella would never change the way he looked at him..
Except,
Dean's smile sagged slightly. "Cas..."
They knew that the angel would be the difficult one. As infamous as the Winchesters were, they were just human. The various groups covering the doors could handle them well enough, especially whilst they were otherwise occupied defending the meat suit. The Angel, however, alone and powerful, no longer had the humans slowing him down. The hundreds of demons congregated, used logic to decide to give him clear access to a spot large enough for them to charge. One-on-one fights he could handle as if they were insects; try getting through the swarm.
So he drove the three of them to the market on the far side of town. It was a little quiet, seeing as it was only early February, but Dean was surprised at how much produce was around, before remembering greenhouses were a thing that existed. Sam’s eyes lit up at some massive tomatoes on a stall, and Cas looked at cabbages with curiosity.
"What do you mean?"
"It's okay now." Livvie whispered soothingly. "It's gone. You're safe now."
After a few minutes, Cas sighed, and Dean looked up.
Dean finally glanced at him, quicky, before looking back out at the road. Cas saw him hesitate for a second. “I uh, I did, um,” He trailed off, and Cas raised an eyebrow, waiting. “I did hear you last night. What you said.”
Not until...
“How you doing, Cas?” Sam was looking at him, a head tilt Cas recognised as sympathetic, his eyes wide and kind as he took in Cas’s hobbling form.
With a glance to Cas, and a camaraderic squeeze of his wrist, he left the room, brushing past Sam, who turned round.
Sam sighed, throwing his cards down. “Fold.” He threw his cards aside, leaning back in his chair and taking a sip of his beer and draining the dregs. Dean placed two bills on the table, adding to the pile, and Cas frowned at his cards again.
Cas practically rolled his head to look at him, the movement so liquid and languid that Dean was suddenly aware of how tense he was himself. Polar opposites, right now.
"Thought there might be something in there to help Cas. Faith healers, rituals, magic, unicorn blood, anything." He reeled off in a list.
And finally, just as they were beginning to get worried that they’d really gotten lost, that they’d never find Cas at all, they hit the last room in this stretch of long corridors. It was dim, though the lights were on, and the walls and ceiling had a weird shine to them. Sam looked around, taking in pots with rock dry soil and the remnants of long dead plants. It was a greenhouse, he realised, the walls and ceiling glass long since smothered by grime, and it meant sense that the previous occupants could grow their own food here.
Oh, but Cas ached for him. He felt heat rise in him, crawling against his skin. More than anything he wanted to reach out to Dean, to pull him in, to feel the heat of his body against his, his lips against his. He wanted to show Dean
“We kinda…”
"The recipe was improved upon." He looked up at Sam, seeing his face was screwed up and squinting, eyes red and puffy. "Sam?"
He felt whole.
The word caused Castiel to frown, déjà vu ringing deep. "Balthazar?" He muttered, the word a question, eyes darting back up to his brethren.
"So easily?" She scoffed. Picking up the angel blade from the table, she turned it in her hand.
"Yeah?" Chuck sounded nervous again.
"Dean." Cas called, and the hunter looked up.
“But like… the bank robbery and murder was weird. And-” She gestured at Cas. “Being God and killing…. well, you killed Westboro, so right on. You actually had a lot of support online.” She sighed, taking another sip of whiskey. “Actually, you were all on some really weird forums online. People really like serial killers.”
He frowned, trying to explain his rationale. “I like chicks.”
“You’re telling me.” Dean sighed, thinking back to the family of cannibals, to the little girl alone in the house hunting down the new family.
"He was your friend."
"Garth." Sam shrugged.
“A date.” Cas repeated, containing the sigh in him as he looked down at the potato planter. He stood up, adjusting its position slightly to catch the right amount of light from the window. “Where is Dean taking you?”
"Can't a girl change her mind?" She cocked her head, letting a few strands of hair fall coyly across her face as she leaned forward onto the bar a bit, exposing just enough cleavage to persuade the boy.
He chose survival, dropping the match into the bowl and finished summoning the angel that would want Crowley dead as much as he did.
He finished up, shaking himself off and flushed, taking a step to the sink as he pulled off his pajamas to get in the shower. He was already looking forward to it, the hot water beating away the residual feelings of groggyness, leaving him fresh and renewed. He pulled his shirt off, catching sight of himself in the mirror and stumbling back.
"I found you because she did." Castiel explained. "She was in the room next to you. She appeared to have been tracking you, following you."
“Careful, Dean; it might sound like you care.” Cas snapped, and Dean spared a glance to him.
It was safe here. Perpetual white, fluffy clouds hung the sky, keeping the warmth in and the harsh sunlight at bay. Aside from the lapping of water and the soft calls of the birds, all was quiet.
She sat down on a bar stool, flashing her pearly whites at the bartender who obediently walked over.
? The thought came unbidden, and it took him by surprise a little.
Those eyes, those blue, bright eyes.
And there it was. A human being. He needed to be one, to know he could be one in this fate he’d landed in, and he needed to know Dean believed in him, that Dean believed he could exist in this world, that he was capable. Because this world, this world with Dean, meant hunting. And if he didn’t hunt, if he
"She's not a little girl anymore, Dean." The angel hissed. "You can't take her down."
That wasn’t a thought he needed to chase. He needed to put that away.
The light was creeping across the room and he watched the slow crawl of light for a few seconds. It had, by now, enveloped Dean's big toe, the one that had been broken in a fight when he was fourteen. It was crooked now, slightly. Over the millennia humans had evolved to find sleeping in sunlight difficult, and it would surely wake Dean if it reached his face. Cas walked over to the window and closed the curtain before padding downstairs, shutting the door behind him.
It took Dean an hour and two coffees to get him alert, spending the time reading the newspaper that Sam had picked up on his run. Garth was right, there were no hunts going, but apparently the economy was still in the crapper. No surprise there. Eventually he looked over to Cas, who had turned his attention back to reading, leaning forward so that he wasn't putting pressure on the tattoo, which was risen, and no doubt itching like all hell. Dean could see the bone structure of his spine from this position, softly jutting under the skin, the faint hint of his ribs.
"They were selling hatred in the name of God. Jesus himself overturned tables in a temple for similar blasphemies."
Dinner eaten, and dirty dishes stacked neatly by the sink in a manner that was uncharacteristically tidy for the Winchester household, Dean moved to the next item on his to-do list.
at Dean, which only narrowed it down a little. “Oh, right!” Sam nodded, and Dean could see recognition flash across his face. “Hang on.” He set the phone to speaker, placing it down on the table. “I got Dean here too, you’re on loud.”
Sam paused, noticing the care in the angel's eyes. He really cared about Dean.
“Murder.” Dean told him, and Sam raised his eyebrows in surprise. “Her partner did it, pinned it on us.”
Hang on. He was getting off track.
"Chicken." Dean said, and walked to the door, a lifetime of hangovers having given him enough practise to walk across the room steadily whilst in such a state. Making sure his hand was in easy reach of the shotgun placed beside the door, a safety precaution, he opened it, wincing as the sunlight reached his eyes.
Walking out of the room and back into the living room, he found a waste paper bin. Cas followed, still holding the picture frame with the lock of hair. He looked at Dean, who looked somewhat disinterested, having practised this a thousand times before, before extracting the hair from the frame and dropping it into the bin.
And by the time Dean had quietly climbed the stairs, Cas was asleep. Dean wondered if he might be faking it for a minute, but the slow easy breaths lifting his chest were a dead giveaway. He watched him for a minute, could just about see his face in the dim light as the moon shifted behind the clouds. Cas needed to shave again, the stubble breaking through longer than he ever used to wear it. Dean had taught him how to shave a week ago, laughing together in front of the sink, sticking scraps of paper on the nicks in Cas’s skin each time. Dean had taken his chin between his fingers, anchoring him in place as he showed him how to go around the corner of his jaw, the jut of his Adams apple.
Dean looked at the shelf, very intact, lying on the floor. Sighing, he hefted it up, straightening it so that it was level with the shelves beside it, putting the leaflets back in order.
Would Cas want to keep this car? Or he could have one of the classics in the garage. If Cas was driving now he’d need his own car to get around. Cas could go explore the world now, see it all as a human; anywhere 4 wheels could take him he could go, without Dean. Cas could leave, as soon as he got fed up of waiting for Dean to make his mind up.
“You sure?” Dean glanced up, checking the time too, nodding in approval.
Cas's eyes softened at the gesture, unused to Dean's kindness after days of hostility. He wasn't sure if it would last, he didn't know how frantically Dean had been trying to rescue him, but right now, he felt like his friend was back.
"How?"
It took Balthazar a few short moments to find his lover. He tried his best, but it was not God's will to restore her to life. Instead, Balthazar went on a smiting spree. Eighteen deaths were reported that night in that neighbourhood. Penny was not..
Charlie asked, and Sam set the phone up on speaker on the kitchen counter and went to dig around the fridge.
This was definitely, definitely not a date.
Sam chanted the spell, the long Latin vowels slow and carefully measured. He pressed the blade of the knife against his palm, watching the blood drip onto the herbs and dust and bones in the bowl.
"Thank you, for your help." Cas replied. "Though I'm sure I could have done it myself."
"Do we have any holy oil left? Any spare angel blades?" Sam asked him.
Cas looked up at Dean, eyes meeting. Dean could barely see them in the dark, and the light from the moon cast them almost grey, but to Dean they shone, bright and blue.
“Jeez, of what?” Charlie clicked open a page to scroll through, typing fast.
Turning round, he looked back to the table. Sam was sitting there with his laptop out, seemingly doing some research about the hunt he had been on today, presumably making up for the fact that he hadn't done any before being called in for it. Cas was still sitting there, fingers resting around the glass, silent. Dean wondered if he'd ever grow out of the whole sitting-like-he-had a pool-cue-up-his-ass thing.
“We’ve done alright so far.” Dean pointed out, and she raised an eyebrow.
this connection while it lasted. If only this once then
Cas struggled to think up a reasonable excuse. "I do not know the area. I doubt I could get us there accurately."
It felt like when he was seventeen, with the worker John had taken him to. Trixie, that had been her name. She took charge and he knew John had been proud of him after.
“You and Dean are kinda on each other’s backs recently, huh?”
Singing. Livvie was humming quietly to herself as she waited.
Cas didn't look behind, merely followed Dean straight to the car and got in. The hunter was now on the phone, and didn't look up at Cas. Dean nodded.
But, shit… if he’d known that would be the one time… he’d’ve made it more than a rushed blowie in a back alley-
“Dean. As you spotted earlier, I’m not really in the mood to be hit on right now. So if you’re looking to blow off some steam you might find some luck at that table down there-” She gestured to a table down the way, where a bunch of forty something women were drinking, laughing, and Dean raised an eyebrow in consideration. “But you’re wasting your time here.”
God, if his Dad could see him now, see where he was, knew what he’d just
“Yeah. She already knew she’s been looking for us since we lost our footprint.” Dean told them, and Sam nodded in confirmation. It wasn’t much of a surprise.
"Nothing."
The conversation turned to the day's hunt, both wanting to mull on something else for a while.
"What happened? Are you alright?"
"Your night was that good then?" Sam joked, and Dean winced, trying to remember what had happened.
“Nah, I really wasn’t any good.”
Sammy hadn’t felt that same twinge.
"All angels are voyeurs, Dean." He reminded him, and the frown dropped, sadness replacing it. The eye contact was dropped.
She leaned in slowly, giving him the chance to move away, and he didn’t, letting her press her lips to his. Her finger tucked under his chin, and he let himself be moved.
"He did what he had to. What else could he have done?"
He rubbed a hand across his face, feeling extra
He could retract his statement of intent, could ‘let Dean off the hook’, to use a human phrase. He could tell him that he didn’t mean it, that he had simply been sexually frustrated and intrigued. Or he could tell him that he’d changed his mind, that he had rescinded his offer, he no longer wanted this with Dean. He could lie. Perhaps it would be easier. But it unsettled him, knowing how deep that lie would be, and frankly he was unsure of his own acting abilities with regards to a matter so human. He didn’t think he could sell it, no matter how motivated he might be.
"And who did you take?" Castiel demanded, taking a step forward, closer to the fire lapping eagerly at his feet.
But behind his closed eyes… it wasn’t, what was her name? He couldn’t remember. Because all he could see was… those bright blue eyes. The smile that crinkled onto his face, still new to him but so welcome every time. The rough dark hair that needed a haircut.
"What if his gun gets knocked away? Or he gets cornered? He needs hand to hand training before we can even
"I'm sure you can," Dean winked. "But first, I just need to ask you a question."
“Sure, you’re a vamp’s wet dream.” Sam scoffed as he finally left the fire alone, satisfied it wasn’t going to snuff itself out. He walked over to the kitchen and opened the fridge, fishing out the lettuce he’d stashed in their earlier and started tearing it into a bowl, ignoring Dean’s eyeroll at the prospect of salad. “Cas did good today.”
Cas wanted him. Right now Cas was staring at him with sheer, unbridled want in his eyes, and Dean couldn’t remember seeing this before, feeling this. Cas had looked at him so many ways over the years, with passion, with affection, anger, fear, sorrow, friendship, but Dean couldn’t remember this clear, resolute need.
Dean's voice was angry. Really, really angry. Cas froze at his tone, fear jolting through him.
"Most people keep some kind of keepsake – a lock of hair, or something. Did you do that?"
Dean snapped into action. Waiting wasn't his game. Life and death situations, however...
He sighed, blinking around the tears in his eyes. “What am I missing out on? There’s so much in this world that I don’t get to have? I don’t get to settle down, I don’t get to retire, I won’t get old age or a dog or a kid? But is there stuff I can have, stuff Dad told me I just couldn’t?”
Cas eyed the book warily, still clutching it in his arms, uncertain, and Dean shrugged, exasperated.
Dean hollowed out his cheeks and sucked, pressure around Cas, and he clung on tighter. He wanted Cas around him, surrounding him, he couldn’t get enough of him. He grabbed his ass, digging his nails in and squeezing, feeling the muscle tense under his grip and he started to move up and down Cas’s shaft, not pulling off completely yet, getting further down every time. His hand moved up Cas’s shirt, feeling the muscles of his back, the tense abs hidden under skin, reaching up to find a nipple and brushing against and feeling Cas jump again, heard him lose a sharp “
“Sounds about right.” Dean walked in the kitchen, snagging a bottle out the fridge and flicking the cap off with his ring. He surveyed Cas and Sam in front of him, suspicious. “What’s going on, you planning on doing something stupid?”
"They would have noticed my absence."
Dean gaped, surprised by Cas's retort. He'd said so little since he'd been back, and what he had said had been meek and apologetic. But apparently, he'd snapped.
on a wet wipe on the floor of a car over a thousand miles away. Pieces of them left behind, a trail unfollowable but still there. They were there.
Dean blinked. "Probably for the best then." He muttered. Cas didn't speak for a minute, leaving Dean at a loss for words. Cas had looked away from him by now, but was also not looking at himself again. Instead, he was looking down, but not at anything in particular. Dean didn't know what to do. He wasn't great at these moments, talking about feelings, the emotional crap. He was far better at the practical approach; a bottle of whiskey and a pat on the back. Sam would've known what to say.
and started saying all these really weird things-”
But fuck… he was ashamed of his Dad.
“Like…” Sam swallowed his pride. “You’re gay.”
“But shout out for saying I’m an attractive human being, girl could always do with that before a big date.” She smiled. “So, Risk in 10 in the library? Mister battle strategist?”
It didn’t matter, because he could receive nothing.
It would take Cas a while to get used to all of this, he got that. But he frowned when he realised it would probably have to be him and Sam doing all the teaching. Sure, he loved kids, perhaps in another life he would've made a great dad, but it was a whole other thing teaching a fully grown man the basics of human life, or apparently, personal hygiene. Complete bed rest for the guy had left him a little ripe, and he could see damp patches beneath his arms.
“I think I understand.” Cas said, and he could see Dean breathe a sigh of relief, tension around the shoulders easing. “But… are we…”
“How’d you manage to bring so many with you in your bag, anyway?” Dean asked, promptly knocking back the shot, feeling the flow of warmth heat him from inside. He glanced at Charlie, who hadn’t flinched at the burn; he liked this chick.
She felt it surge. She felt the power enter her body, she felt the sense of completeness fill her, submerge her, burning light roaring through her veins, feeling it tickle and tingle and burn. It raged over her, her body, for a second, overwhelmed by the strain of taking in this grace, but it remembered, it remembered how to do it. She remembered how it felt, to move with grace and breathe with grace and to look through the grace.
Eventually they reached the cabin. It was dark by this time, and Sam thought his brother might've drifted off. He actually seemed to be sleeping peacefully, no visible nightmares as far as he could tell and he regretted that he had to wake him.
Dean picked his clothes pretty fast, a pile of them slung over his arm. He didn’t know much about gender dynamics or whatever, he knew what he liked in clothes and it was damn easy to find. Some comfy lounging gear to wear around the bunker on lazy evenings was a novelty, and he smiled as he slung a hoodie over his arm; he hadn’t worn these in years. He left Cas and Sam to carry on rifling through, smiling at a sweater that Cas had picked out, a garish yellow with flowers. It looked handmade, but if it made him happy then who was Dean to say anything otherwise.
“He texted, he’s gone out for the day.”
Only one way to answer that question. “Peachy.” He told her, smiling despite the purely audio nature of a phone call. There was no way to explain everything they’d been through in the years since they’d met. “What about you, still in the force?”
"Sorry." Sam sheepishly apologised.
And he gave her something. The night that Castiel found Balthazar, the night that she had been locked in the basement, he gave her a necklace. It was silver, shining, and in the curved shape of 'M', the Enochian symbol for love. It had been her mother's, he had told her.
"Look, I know this has got to be hard-"
For a second nothing happened. Then the little girl bowed her head, closing her eyes and sighing. Suddenly, her head snapped up, her eyes wide open, exhaling. Bright light filled the room, blinding, hostilely bright, coming from the girl. This light would blind a normal human, burn their eyes out of their sockets in an instant. Not Livvie.
“But you know what to do.”
and fell to the floor, contents spilling wide. He shoved the trolley over, the crash echoing in the room and he kicked it, sending it skidding into the wall. He turned around, grabbing at a bookshelf and yanking, but it stayed firm under his hands, bolted down to the floor and the metal dug into his hands. He yanked it harder, again and again, but this object was unmovable, and he wasn’t unstoppable. His head dropped down on his forearms, his breathing harsh under the sudden quiet in the room.
Dean almost didn’t see, the lights so chaotic that all bodies, all movement just one mass streaming together, how was he meant to see one soul out of the lot of them. But he did, a glimpse of one man alone leaving that mass as if spat out, ejecting himself and running straight for the fire exit, the door swinging shut hard behind him.
Sam chuckled, a single huff, warily, but it was put on, purposeful. He was weighing his response, and Dean felt like he was trapped under a microscope. “No, you don’t, but yeah… that’d be cool.”
And somehow Cas had clocked that. His face had softened.
"My wings were the most physical manifestation of my grace." He slowly explained, still not looking away from his reflection. "And even they are gone."
Garth didn't say anything, just continued listening.
Touching Dean was electric, it always had been. Ever since he had branded Dean’s body, Dean’s soul, with that fragment of his grace, that pulse between them was addictive. When he healed people he would hover a hand, but with Dean he would always touch, to have that closeness, to feel Dean, body and soul beneath him. He couldn’t feel that ethereal zing of grace any more, but something thrummed between them, and it took everything Cas had to not pull him closer, to find where it was strongest.
"Yeah, without a soul."
Cas picked up the two cards in front of him; nothing special there, a jack and a five. Dean nodded at him, and Cas put down a monopoly $10, Dean promptly putting down $20. “You know there was a time poker saved our lives? Bobby too?”
“Dean, about last night-”
"Would they?" Dean asked, incredulous, and Cas closed his eyes in resignation.
“Yeah, yeah.”
"You said you'd sleep with Cas tonight." He reminded him, and Dean blinked, before glaring.
"Sounds to me he helped you a lot too." She sighed, and looked alarmed when Dean shot her a glare.
Dean couldn’t be that for Cas. Dean couldn’t be that, he knew.
And it was done. He sagged, his hand dropped, and the water kept falling on him.
company.”
She looked to the bartender. She frowned slightly, taking in the thick moustache on his upper lip, his weathered skin. "He's not my type. Besides, you got here first this time."
"Nothing?" Dean repeated.
holding back that much.” Cas shook his head in disbelief. “I can handle it.”
that it was true. The words fell out as truth, for the first time out loud to Dean, sure, but he’d said them to Sam days before. He’d admitted them to himself weeks ago, and he knew them to be the truth for years. But Dean didn’t know that.
“I mean the whole….” Dean waved his hand awkwardly.
As he turned the corner of the house, he looked up, seeing that the back of the ground floor had a large balcony across it that presumably came from the kitchen. Annoyingly enough, it didn't have any steps to the garden below.
“Thought you didn’t trust Charlie? You leaving me here alone with her?”
Dean coughed a little on his beer, mind involuntarily blinking back to the Star Wars porn parodies he’d watched, how he’d once come watching Han Solo instead of Leia in the Falcoln. “No?” He answered in a way that was meant to be confident but came out instead like a question. Charlie laughed at him. “I do have a friend who I think might be, might be gay?”
Dean didn’t look up, and felt himself at war again on the inside. The urge to shove Cas away roared, to send him from the room, to get far, far away from here, from Cas… it was strong. But this man in front of him, this soft, gentle, terrifying, amazing warrior stood naked in front of him just wanting to hold him, to protect him, to love him…
"And the new wife has been complaining about rats in the walls."
Cas's whole body ached. A dull, bruising ache coursed across his bones, and he felt as if the air had been squeezed from his lungs. But he forced himself to stand up, and within a few seconds the pain had all but left, leaving only a slight flinching pain in his chest.
The old man peered at them, clearly confused. His thick, white eyebrows hung over the frame of his glasses. "What about the people who looked at it yesterday? I'm sure they said nothing was wrong."
“We ready for her?”
His brain still kept trying, though; throwing up old names of aged contacts, hunters and civilians, even Supernatural creatures that they didn't part on the worst of terms with.
“You’re thinking pretty hard there. You okay?” Sam pulled out a smoothie from the fridge, green and gritty, and Dean grimaced as Sam took a slug of it.
Turning quickly to Tommy, she flashed her brightest smile. "Darling; if you bring me to the back room, I will definitely make it worth your while."
They were quiet for a few seconds. “Yeah,” Sam finally spoke. “We’ll think about it.”
“Bananas?” Sam suggested, and started listing off a load of healthy things Dean had barely touched. Halfway through Dean had rolled his eyes and go a pad to write everything down, seeing as Sam was being greedy about it. When Sam seemed to run out of steam, he pointed in what he knew was Cas’s direction, without looking up at him.
"We do not biologically alter the bodies we inhabit." Castiel attempted to explain.
“Sixty-five thousand.”
Sam got them some breakfast from the cafeteria downstairs while Dean took a large gulp from the flask.
. He got in the car, glancing in the mirror at Dean still standing there. Something was pumping through him, through his body, and he recognised it with resignation as arousal; how unfortunate. He buckled up, before realising it wasn’t just one Winchester brother staring at him. “What?”
Sam stood up and helped place her onto Dean's bed. "Who's that?"
“You don’t seem to share those views.”
"Since when do you pray to God?" Chuck countered, and Dean nodded.
"I got a case." Sam told him, and Dean's eyes snapped back to his brother. Oh right, a case; their job. He looked back at Cas.
Cas nodded, clearly trying to understand. The look of panic hadn't left his eyes.
"Don't do this to me, Cas." Dean muttered, wincing as the chest stopped moving.
"We move." He told him firmly. "She knows where we are. We move to another town, and figure out our plan from there."
“It’s a dangerous job, Dean, but it will not get done if I do not get started.” He saw Dean swallow, and his eyes were wide, frozen light, what was the phrase, a doe in headlights? He leaned in closer, his mouth close to Dean’s ear and as he spoke his voice was low. “I am strong, Dean;
Right then, Cas did the opposite. He unzipped the duffel bag, pulling out items onto the bed. His other pair of jeans, shirts, his suit (crumpled, he would need to learn how to use an iron), underwear, his bible. And in amongst these were some of Dean’s things, shirts, pajamas, a pair of underwear. His headphones.
Dean felt a sob escape him, a shake wrack his body, and Cas drew him closer. “Can we get back into bed?” Cas asked, and he nodded, letting himself be dragged back into the bed, gown and all. Cas brought the sheet back over them both, and they lay facing each other, apart, Cas stroking a hand up and down Dean’s arm. They lay there for a while, the pillow beneath Dean growing damp until the tears dried up.
"Dean is angry with me." Cas quietly said.
"Missouri?" Dean blinked. "Wow, we haven't heard from her in what... six, seven years?"
He growled. "I'm not-" He'd started, a second before his drunken lips met hers. Warm lips slid over each other, breath thick with alcohol mingling together as Dean's hand caught in her tangled hair. When he pulled away, a self satisfied smirk on his face he saw the pink of her tongue dart out to stroke her flushed lips.
"What, Sam? Tell me what those options are, cos I'm not seeing them!" He walked backwards through the doors, not taking his eyes off of his brother as they moved into the car park.
"Hello, Castiel." She smiled. "It is good to see you again. I had been worried for you."
"Acquired taste. So come on," He stood up, walking over and leaning against the wall. "Where are you going to get it."
Dean finally turned, looking him in the eye. They were so green. “I figured here would be better, you might be able to find what you’re after.”
Afternoon drew into evening and evening into night. And eventually, for lack of anything better to do, the Winchesters fell asleep.
The cabin had grown dark, and Dean was slouching in his chair, looking over at the man sitting across from him. Cas was holding a glass of water in his hands, looking at the glass.
"Yeah we covered that bit." He agreed. "Who are you?"
Dean had been right last night, he needed to train up, and train up well, before he could hunt. In this state he would be overpowered in a fight easily if it came down to unarmed combat. Sam had generously laid some of the blame at being comatose for days, but that wasn’t it. He just wasn’t the angel Castiel any more. He was Castiel the human, in a borrowed body that could never be returned.
He tried to break the surface, but found himself sinking. He tried to swim up, but he couldn't find 'up'. He was getting tugged down, his air was running out fast, the pressure to breathe was becoming overwhelming. His body began to shudder, his arms and legs spasming as they tried to find a way out, and his eyes stung when he opened them to see. The water was murky, and he couldn't see a way out.
"Kind of my point." Sam told him, gesturing behind. "Turn it down."
"Yeah, well; I think I can make do without that." Dean said. "Gimme a whiskey."
"But you said she'd had her power stripped?"
It scared him, the thought of what it would do to Dean. He didn't see how is brother could cope after that. But right now, he had to be the strong one. He had to push Dean through this.
The hunt should have been quick and clean.
“For, uh, your hand?” He nodded to him, looking back at the road. Don’t look at his hand. “If there’s spunk, or whatever.”
"You stopped, for a minute." He explained carefully. "Dean said you stopped breathing, your heart stopped." He trailed off. Dean clearly hadn't told him. "Doesn't matter. You're breathing now, that's all that matters."
Castiel looked uncomfortable again, and the brothers simultaneously raised their eyebrows. He had always come across as completely indifferent to sex.
The boys glanced to each other; he wasn’t wrong.
. Nice job on disappearing online though, how’d you manage that?” He stepped forwards, as best he could in the devils trap. “I’ve known where you are, but my demons have been on watch duty
“Got a case?” Dean followed.
Cas nodded, taking another sip of his beer in thought.
"It's fine." Cas replied, tensing in anticipation of the pressure of Dean's hands. He twitched slightly at the first light touch, gone after a split second, but back again just as quickly, the hint of nail at the edge of the tape holding the bandage on. The removal was slightly painful, the tug of skin as it resisted separation from the tape, the scrape of nail, but after a few second he began to relax into it, the sensation changing from an unpleasant tugging to a soothing tickle, the scrape itching and satisfying all at once. It was, however, short lived, almost as soon as Cas had gotten used to it, Dean grasped the end and tugged hard, pulling off the entire strip in one go.
He still didn't know how he felt about that. But he was pretty damn sure he wasn't going to get through it without Dean.
Tonight. They could do that tonight.
"Really?" She asked incredulously. "After all his big old hissy fit earlier, he's not gonna come bust him boyfriend out?"
Dean’s heart thudded in his chest, his breath coming fast but gradually easing off as he came back down, a smile dancing across his face. He let a long breath exhale from his pursed lips as the world righted itself again. “Fuck.”
"Human's are quaint. They can be arrogant, annoying and self righteous, but they are wonderful... it's almost worth giving it all up for..." She gasped, and slapped her forehead. "Silly me! I forgot why I was actually down here!"
.” She sat up straight, giving him her full attention. “
, that the offer of breakfast was too much to believe after yesterday… But damn. Why did it look so
"The modern version of pasta is very different from the original." He informed Sam, moving onto the second carrot.
"Why would I want to do that?" Cas asked in confusion. He'd never understood the practise.
"Well, I saw myself calling you." Chuck explained.
“Do you know how to play anything?” Dean asked.
Not gonna happen.”
"Cas." He spoke out loud. "Could you come here, please?"
"Me and Sam have taken down a lot bigger than a little girl, Cas. We can handle her."
It was worth it when Cas finally stepped out of the dressing room. Dean leant back, raising his eyebrows in slight surprise. Cas was alternating between looking down at himself, and into the mirror. Finally in a suit that fit him, he looked crisp and neat; the shoulders of the black jacket sat well, showing the actual size of his shoulders, rather than swamping him as before. Buttoned at the front, he no longer seemed to be rectangular, but had the slightest hint of a waist hidden beneath the fabric. The collar was open, showing just a hint of a collar bone, pale skin exposed, and the slacks, no longer too big, accentuated his legs.
“Or about…. Cas?” Sam winced as he asked, hearing the silence at the other end of the line. He remembered a friend back at Stanford, Paul, and the conversations they used to have about gender theory, queer politics. It was a long time ago, 2004, but he remembered one night where Paul had been talking about the, what was it, the performative art of masculinity? And Sam had thought of Dean, had though, heh, that would explain a few things. He’d told Paul about Dean, and Paul had laughed and said
"Well, we appreciate it." Sam smiled.
"Ginger."
"You can try, but they don't know anything." Sam said. "Ask for... what's his name... Timmy? Tommy?"
"Of all the films to pick... Star Trek."
Dean laid down his cards, a queen and a king. It looked like a good hand from Cas’s point of view, but when he laid down his own hand Dean groaned, running his hands across his scalp and leaning back in his chair, exposing the long line of his neck glowing warm in the firelight. “Oh my god, Cas.”
The bar hadn't got any busier. Some had come in and out. No-one really stayed that long, no-one really talked – they were there to be alone, and they respected that of each other.
She placed a tiny palm on his cheek. "You have played your part, and they are unhappy with the outcome. But they are not so unkind; they have let you keep what you have?"
“No.” He said firmly, placing a palm on Cas’s chest. He was there, grounding. “I’m just getting used to this.” He forced out a chuckle. “Don’t give up on me just yet.”
"Cas's gone." Dean told him, spinning on the spot as he looked up and down the spot, goosebumps prickling down his spine.
"What?"
Sam didn't ask him if he was sure. Sam didn't try to whittle him down, try to get an answer. He knew how much it would be killing Dean that it was Sam going out on a hunt while he stayed at home, doing nothing. But they knew that Dean wouldn't leave Cas alone, not yet. And there was no way that he would put their personal issue crap in front of the job. So, this was really the only route, and they knew it.
Killing demons was such an ugly business.
Dean looked expectantly to his brother. No way was he leaving.
Cas hummed, accepting his words but not necessarily believing. He needed to get better at this. If he went on a hunt with Dean, with the Winchesters, and he got them hurt because of his own ineptitude… this wasn’t an option. He needed to be better.
"He told you?" Sam asked, and Dean looked round in annoyed surprise.
When he eventually shut off the water, he looked around, realising just how steamy he had allowed the room to become. A thick fog hung around, and he found that, once he pulled back the curtain, he could barely see the door.
Dean let a smile encroach onto his face. "Garth?" He repeated. "You're going hunting with Garth."
“What? No!”
"Whatever." Sam chuckled, slinging the bag over his shoulder. "See you later. Have fun!" He called, walking away. Dean watched, sulking slightly, a small pout on his face as Cas approached him.
“Oh my god, guys.” Sam’s head jutted out between them from the back. “Can you cool it for like, two minutes? We’re literally going
“Man, I would kill for a photo of that.” Dean laughed too, glancing back at Cas.
“We’ve got each other.” Sam said, and Dean scoffed. Hokey horseshit. Sam shook his head, nothing more to say, because even he knew it wasn’t much, glancing back at Cas. Cas was still frowning, still holding his place, no more stitches completed. “You done?”
"Wow..." Sam thought about this for a moment, suddenly seeing Heaven as a soap opera. "Wish Bobby was around to hear about this."
He finally looked away from the hand back to Cas's face, now completely bathed in the sunlight.
“You could cook a whole thanksgiving dinner in here.” Dean had smiled, leaning against the cool metal counters and wiping a finger through the thick layer of dust. “After we clean.”
After Sam went to sleep, Dean just wandered around for a while. He dropped the whisky, switching to beer, and carried the six pack around the house. He tried watching TV for a while, but he couldn't keep his attention on anything for long enough.
"Sure, sure." He chuckled. "Hold still," he reminded, nudging his friend on the shoulder. He went back to carefully dabbing away the dried ink and blood, a little too pink for his liking. That's what he gets for giving the guy whiskey beforehand, he supposed. "So, what they were saying-" Dean cut off, stopping the sentence. He caught Cas's eye in the mirror, quickly looking back down. He suddenly, stupidly felt uncomfortable.
Dean shook his head. "No, it's... yeah, it's a bit weird, but," He frowned, trying to explain. "It's like holding on to them. If you've still got a piece of them, they're not completely gone."
There was a sigh as she chewed over her words.
"It was hardly a riot, Dean." Cas huffed, watching him in the mirror.
"Wait, Livvie?" Sam repeated, looking at his brother incredulously.
“What are you talking about?” Dean snapped, and Cas finally looked up to glare at him. “There’s nowhere.”
“And ain’t that a shame?” Dean asked, winking at Cas as Sam walked in the room. “Weren’t sure if you were coming back or not, there’s enough for you.”
“Cos you’re asking about sulphur and cold spots?” He heard Dean huff a laugh. “It confuses people, you gotta put them at ease.”
“Who are you?” Dean barked out. She was shrinking away, shielding her face with her arms, a pretty instinctive but useless reaction against a gun. She was unarmed. He lowered the gun a bit, not by much, and she peeked out from behind her hands. Other than the formidable bone structure of her face, she didn’t look like a threat.
"Well, I got your call!"
At some point, Sam sat down with them, scooting Dean along to accommodate his larger frame on the couch. He too seemed to enjoy the film, smiling and joking along with Dean about what was happening.
“Sam!” Cas yelled, lifting the shotgun again, but the blast would be too wide, it would spray Sam with just as much salt as the ghost. He grimaced, lowering the gun and Sam gasped harshly, air not quite reaching his lungs. Sam had enough presence of mind to kick the dropped journal towards Cas who snagged it with his foot, stopping it’s journey. Cas reached to his belt where the Angel Blade was buckled to, and he grabbed it, holding it forward and staring straight at the ghost.
"So, are you boys allergic to calling, or what?" She demanded.
“Doesn’t it feel like a slap in the face?”
"What is she?" Sam asked.
Which left Cas stranded in that body, trying to figure out what was Cas and what was Jimmy. His sleeping schedule was Jimmy’s, so far anyway. And maybe coffee was Jimmy too. He wondered if there was any secrets left to unlock in the poor man’s physiology, his spice tolerance level, a secret smoking habit, any physical tics that Cas might pick up. They’d probably never know what was organic and what was inherited.
"Hello, Sam." Was the low response from Cas, who smiled ever so slightly.
He kept his eyes fixed on Crowley. “This is about reputation. So you sully mine.”
With instructions to text if they thought of anything else they wanted, Dean left before Sam and Cas had even finished their eggs. He figured coped with that pretty well, to be honest, and Sam hadn’t clocked anything off, which was generally a good sign - that kid’s radar was generally pretty on point.
He propped himself up on his elbows and tried to assess the situation. General mood-wise, he was a cocktail of emotion. A shot of anger, a splash of hurt, a dash of weird happiness, and a quart of son of a BITCH, that really hurts!
Dean ran a fingertip along the interior, feeling the cold plastic and its mottled texture. It was a piece of shit, nothing worth anything. He missed the Impala, a lot… she was still in that old lot that he’d left her in to keep them safe from Leviathan’s. Maybe it would be safe now, since Charlie wiped them, but it was still pretty distinctive, they’d probably remember her anyway, if they had any taste.
Cas turned round at that, an eyebrow raised in what Dean perceived as incredulity, and to his surprise, slight sarcasm. "A tramp stamp." Cas stated. "Sam warned me that you might suggest that."
“Hurry up.” Sam snapped, chucking aside the box he was looking through and prying open the next. The bottle of perfume leaked a little onto the photos Cas was moving, but that wasn’t a problem. Bigger fish to fry.
"Watch who you're calling child," She snapped. "Or have you not noticed the fact that you're wearing a little girl?"
"I am so sick of hearing you say that, you know?" Dean snapped, turning away.
And she walked away.
The fury from yesterday wasn’t entirely gone, still so frustrated in Dean for treating his own needs so callously, but it was simmering now at frustration, a slow seething boil that was refusing to fix in any one flavour of feeling.
“I didn’t know what to do! But you know, everyone deserves to get laid.” He laughed around the tight feeling in his chest.
"Yes." He said with distaste.
Cas lifted his thumb away. The scar remained. “When I raised you from hell I wiped every scar from your body.”
“You think you still got it? You got the moves?” Dean taunted, twitching an eyebrow provocatively.
He hung up with a low groan, doubling over for a second out of sheer embarrassment. Fuck, he hated those books. Sam and Cas wandered closer, and Sam laughed at him.
Cas opened his eyes, surveying his reflection again. "I don't know."
He looked away, knowing, of course, what he meant. He didn’t realise Cas had known, that the angels had known, everything he’d done when money and food were short, what he had to do to get food for Sammy when Dad had left them for too long. About the men who had taken what they wanted, and left him holding crumpled notes, enough to last them a few more days.
“Men don’t care about fashion.” Dean told him simply, heading straight for the shirts.
"Oh yeah?" Sam squinted down at him.
“Which is the reason I suggested it.” Cas reminded him. “I don’t care about the rumours he’ll spread about me. It’s politics, and my days of questing for power are behind me.” He sighed, shaking his head as glimpses of the past year flashed before him. “What it brought out in me was abhorrent in so many ways. If this is my penance, to be human, my reputation destroyed, so be it. There’s only one person’s opinion I care about, and he’s in this room. He knows the truth.”
She leaned forward some more, resting on the bar. "Shoot." She smiled.
But for some reason, right now, Sam was the one who was there for him. Sam was his friend, and Sam would, if not understand, would at least be the right person to listen.
He paused, trying to understand what she’s getting at.
“I see.”
He had taken it for granted that he saw Dean inside and out, that he saw the outer shell and the inner soul enmeshed and entwined as one. He’d spent more and more time appreciating the shell, the outer body and the way Dean presented himself to the world, seeing when it was a facade and when it was real. Now Cas only saw Dean’s shell, and he missed the sight he had lost. But, somehow each day he saw the beauty in Dean’s physical form more and more every day, entranced.
"I don't believe so, but neither you nor Dean wear them."
"Cas-" He choked out, unsure what to say. His fingers twitched, reaching closer, trying to close the distance.
“Better than your junk food, anyway.” He kicked him under the table.
"No, it's okay." He told her, wiping his eyes of sleep. "How's he looking?"
He sighed, brushing the grass a little. “We’ve grown up a lot in the last few years, since Dad’s been gone. A lot’s happened. But…. Dean’s changing, I can see it.” He glanced back around, and could see Dean and Cas huddled close to one another. “He’s found someone, someone really important. Someone who’s good for him. And I think they could last, if , you know, both of them survive.” He chuckled, half joking, but sobered up when he realised just how much Mom would hate that joke.
"I'm going out."
Dean nodded, gritting his jaw. “You never used it.”
“Oh, and which sense is that?” Dean jibed, rolling over to look at him.
"Fine." He snapped, peeling the damp fabric away from himself again. "I'm gonna take a shower."He muttered, and Sam chuckled, eyes narrowed.
“I know. I’m not going anywhere.” Cas told him, stroking a soft palm down between Dean’s shoulderblades, and he all but melted in.
"And I bet you put that in the nicest possible manner."
She turned her head, looking straight at the window where Dean was.
"It's nothing."
“Dean, this isn’t what I-”
“You tell me - fresh start, you said.” He looked at her, waiting, before she broke into a grin.
He hefted his weight up, swinging his feet off the side of the bed and heading towards the bathroom. Man, he needed to piss, the alcohol from last night still settling in his belly. He needed water too, but he’d catch that when he went for breakfast. Would Sam and Cas be back yet?
“Gun.” Cas barked out, and on instinct they all ducked, a second before a crack rang out and a fracture splintered across the windscreen. Another, and the third one shattered, the crack widening. Three holes had appeared and the back window was completely gone, the laminate only holding out in front. Dean reached the passing point and drifted the car, swerving, narrowly missing a tree before righting the course, speeding forwards. Sam had got a gun and was aiming it back with his left hand, but the two shots flew wide.
Instead he picked up the angel blade, brandishing it towards the pair.
And Cas kept going until Dean was twitching, over-sensitive, grasping at his hair, his shoulders, tugging him back up to him, kissing him and tasting himself, salty and human. He reached down between them, taking Cas in hand and pumping him once, twice, three times, and then held him through his orgasm, watching his face to see this fragment of him that he’d never seen before, listening to the choked gasps that he missed the first time. Cas never let go of his shoulder, not until they were both spent.
He had been so brave. Cas had been so brave, in a way Dean had never been. The sort of bravery that John would’ve destroyed him for. So he’d tried it too. And he got shot down, instantly.
Sam’s voice barked through, interrupting his thoughts. He realised Sam had been saying something, had been repeating himself, and Dean looked up, seeing his brother shake his head at him. Sam grabbed Dean’s phone, which had been buzzing on the table for a half a minute. Sam frowned at the phone, reading the name. “Detective Ballard?” Sam asked, and Dean shrugged, trying to remember. They met so many people over the years, it was impossible to remember all of them.
“I’m more worried about what we’re eating today.” Sam groaned, gesturing to small pile of food on the table; a box of oats, a packet of bacon, two bananas, an avocado and some beef jerky. Dean pulled a face. Ah. “I didn’t manage to grab much, clothes were light and all but I couldn’t carry all the food across the woods.
, a roiling mass of substance, claws and teeth and spinning interlocking rings, eyes on each of them, trained straight onto him. They tilted to the side, watching him with curiosity.
“What do we think?” Dean asked, looking between Sam and Cas.
“You set us up good.” Dean told her, eyes soft as he smiled down at her. Cas thought he might be able to see it now, how Dean looked at her. There was no heat there; there was affection and love, but anything romantic seemed far-fetched. Dean had even said she was like a little sister to him. “You gonna be okay?”
Sam frowned. “See, Dean pretty much hits on all the women he meets-”
“He got a drink spilled down him, he was grouchy.” Dean bluffed, and Sam scoffed, clearly not buying it.
“Yeah.” Dean continued the story. “Anyway, this ghost was warning all these people, then it started warning Ballard too, she was next on the hit list. We convinced her it was a ghost, except her partner was gonna kill me, had me at gunpoint.”
“How do you know this is my first
Reluctantly, he looked away and turned the key, starting the car and driving away, angel still fuming in the passenger seat. Dean turned on the stereo, music blasting out to mask the silence.
“So, your first ever date,” Dean said, breaking the companionable silence. “How was it?”
"You tell me." Sam stayed on the floor, waiting.
The thought sunk in Dean’s chest like a stone.
, as little as he knew how, to make Dean
“Yes, they did.” He stroked Dean’s hair, feeling the short wisps between his fingertips, the fronds against his hand. It wasn’t one of the pleasant memories, Dean standing in front of him, hurt, let down. That was a memory worse than the actual reprogramming. Each time he’d hurt Dean was.
"I must know nothing!" Dean stubbornly contradicted. "You didn't just leave when you left! You left way before that; you left when you went to Crowley. You left when you lied to us and when you spied on us! Elvis has left the building!"
His thoughts were suddenly interrupted by a voice, jolting him back to the situation at hand.
“That was the deal.” He sighted. “It was worth it. He’s probably thrilled with whatever he’s telling.”
"I found him." Cas's quiet voice interrupted them both, and they turned to look at the hunched figure of the girl.
"Anything you wanna tell me?" Dean slurred, alcohol still blurring his words.
"Exorcizamus te, omnis immundus spiritus," Dean yelled out, as fast as he could muster. "Omnis satanica potestas, omnis incursio ."
"I don't think so." Sam said. "She doesn't seem to want to fight us."
If Cas was wearing the ring, stashed away secret in Dean’s room, would he be able to see it from over here? Depends on which hand it was on, really, one hand hidden in the pocket of the blue suede winter jacket he was wearing today, which frankly really suited him. But that was his right hand, so if he wore it on his left Dean could probably make it out from here. Did his eyesight used to be better? Maybe one day he’d wear glasses.
"You slept with her, didn't you?" Sam asked, sighing. "You stupid-"
“More often than not. Sometimes just sick humans, those ones are worse.”
Cas felt no small sense of trepidation on returning to the bunker. The last he and Dean had spoken was on the phone the other night and it had devolved into Cas snapping at him and hanging up. Dean had probably spent the whole time since having a wonderful time with Charlie, likely falling in love, or at least copulating frequently.
“I saw a recipe for stuffed zucchini, I want to try it out.”
Sighing, he climbed the final step, treading into the room. He winced, the first foot falling a little heavy on the floorboards, a thump echoing round the room. Cas didn't stir.
“You got anything to say about that?”
“So, we good?” She asked, and Dean nodded.
"Which would you prefer?"
"No!"
“Whaddya say we ditch Sam and book a room, save ourselves a couple hours driving?” Dean suggested, and Cas hummed in thought, breaking away to glance over Dean’s shoulder to Sam, still at the grave.
"Man... cool hut." The smaller man grinned. "Mind if I took a look around?"
.” He told them firmly. “To
Cas’s eyes darkened, and Dean felt a shiver run down his spine. “But the noises you’re making are too addictive.” He said stepping back in and reaching his hand back down, and Dean gulped as it curved around him again, still over the fabric but warm, delicious, the pressure causing him to thrust his hips forward involuntarily, chasing the friction. “Last time we did this I didn’t get to
Sam huffed. "Well. Then, think of it this way; he's probably going to be pretty damn useful."
“Fuck.” He swore.
Sam supported the angel, a hand around her waist as they walked into the diner, following Dean, who had walked in first. They sat at a table by the window, in clear view of their car, and a waitress quickly gave them menus. Sam noticed her trying to flirt with Dean, but he also noticed Dean completely ignoring her. He sighed, but opened the menu.
And annoyance sparked in Cas. Not new, he’d felt it often as an Angel, despite it being such a human emotion; anger was for angels, but annoyance… human. But here it was again, that same annoyance, with the same target as it so often was at, at Dean, at himself. He was
Sam spoke again.
Sam laughed.
“Are you ready to order?”
The hunter walked out of the front door, leaving the confused old man behind. Cas hesitated, and turned to him.
"So, uh." He began, before feeling self conscious of Sam's eyes still trained on him. He stepped into the bathroom, closing the door behind him. "What you doing?"
"Why are you not also angry at me?" Castiel asked. "You suffered just as much as Dean has, because of me."
"Of course." She smiled, grabbing a bottle from a fridge and removed the cap before handing it to him.
“What?” Cas asked.
to be the truth. He couldn’t be what Cas wanted. Cas deserved better, so much better. He deserved someone kind, someone whole. “This wasn’t about me, this was what you needed.”
"Really?" Dean asked. "I'm sorry, I didn't know."
"So then what the hell do you think we should do?"
“You deserve better, I shouldn’t’a done that.”
"DEAN!" Sam yelled at his brother, who was looking a little bit too comfortable in that armchair.
Castiel carefully approached them both and, after a brief hesitation, placed a fingertip on each of the brothers' foreheads. It lingered for a fragment of a second longer than usual, the warm pressure against their brows, almost infinitesimal, just enough time for Dean to scowl at the delay. With no more warning than that they found themselves back in civilisation on a main road, on the edge of a driveway of another motel.
He dashed to the toilet and heaved up the copious amounts of alcohol that was still in his stomach. Usually a sign of a good night, but it didn't feel like it.
"My wings." He finally spoke, and Dean raised his eyebrows in surprise.
“What about you? How are you feeling today?” Cas asked cautiously, watching him. Dean plastered a smile on his face, chewing around the mouthful. He felt the veneer and bluster of himself come up, and he blinked again, swallowing down the stodge. That was it, wasn’t it, the way he could slam up the walls any time he felt even slightly vulnerable. It had served him really well over the years, had helped him smother down the shit he’d gone through, helped him keep people, Cas, at arms length. Right now he wasn’t sure what he was trying to hold back, the unbidden glimpses of hell overnight, or the question.
