It was late, but sleep was the furthest thing from his mind, the details of the day still buzzing behind his eyes as he let himself through the be-columned front door and padded across the impossibly plush carpet to the apartment door. He’d already mapped out how the case would be added to his evidence wall; the strings that could be connected, the pins to stick in the right places.
“That you’re not.” John closes his eyes against the pacing again, behind his eyelids it’s as if he can still see the dark undulating against the pale.
John snorts, doesn’t bother to correct him. “Yes, probably. You think he’ll be sore we didn’t meet him after his shift?”
It was only the clumsy nature of the note that still bothered Sherlock. For it to arrive just hours after he had found the calling card made a taunting kind of sense, however that it should quote the exact address where he had found the card seemed unnecessary and grandiose. He’d added the postscript to draw attention to this.
For the most part he’d kept himself busy, allowing himself to be washed away by the tide of the work: the rounds, the paperwork, the slide show of faces: doctors, patients, nurses. But now his shift was over and instead of changing, instead of collecting his things and wishing his colleagues goodbye as he limped his quiet way from the building, instead he was sitting very still in the corner of the staff break room, concentrating hard on a dark smudge on the opposite wall and willing the memories not to come.
The jumble of emotions that flood him as their mouths first find each other. The alien familiarity of Sherlock’s lips: warm and smooth and soft. The heady scent of his skin. Just him, just you.
Behind him the street was crowded with uniformed police officers, tape strung around the front of the generic looking 80’s apartment block in the eerie blue glow of the police lights. It was like a scene from a bad detective show. Sherlock loved it already.
The search for the MRI department had been harder than John had anticipated and once he’d managed to locate it, his leg had been killing him.
John answers them all as well as he can. Being honest, giving specifics where he knows he would need them if he were the one asking. They’re all about his current state, but John is expecting the last question when it finally comes:
The chatter and the laughter and the noise; the scraping of chairs and the hum of conversation. It’s no longer there.
“Somewhere where you can be your own boss, if you wish. Somewhere where that won’t mean too much work.”
“Don’t tell me you already worked it out.” Lestrade huffed, “You need to share these things, I could arrest you for wasting police time.”
Sherlock can only look back at him with a half-smile and not for the first time John gets the impression that they are all just playing along with a farce created entirely in Angelo’s imagination.
Turning instinctively in a familiar bed to reassure himself. A cloud of dark curls rests on the pillow beside him.
In his distraction he barely notices as someone leaps from the seat before him, his long coat billowing around him.
“Which is it – Afghanistan or Iraq?” The stranger says again, those eyes boring into John with a singular purpose.
“Sherlock!” She cries as she sees him, and John has to admit that everything he’s heard about him up until this point seems to make a little bit more sense.
For a second Lestrade oscillated between the two, torn between staying and assuaging the confusion of the witness or following Sherlock to find out what he knew. The latter won out.
Baker Street was hushed and expectant when he arrived, the summertime darkness sitting across it like a too-heavy blanket.
“You haven’t seen or heard from Ms Stephens since Sunday evening?” Sherlock asked the man sitting across from him.
“And if she had help…” Lestrade started. Sherlock opened his mouth to jump in, but Lestrade knew what he was going to say. “’If! Sherlock,” Lestrade glared.
“Funny how things work out,” John replied, without finding it particularly funny. He took his drink back and took another swig.
“And just how long did you spend outside watching whether or not I switched on a light?” John’s tone is teasing.
John wasn’t quite what Sherlock had imagined; shorter than his peers and broad shouldered, his blonde hair a contrast with his dark uniform. Sherlock gravitated closer, near enough to hear what they were saying.
If he’d been asleep he could never heard the noise in the hallway downstairs. Could never have stood from his chair and collected the plates from their positions beneath the coffee table. Could never have dropped them dramatically on the appearance of a man who may never really have been standing there.
They continued together, winding through smaller and smaller streets which were, in turns, bustling with locals and tourists, or dim, unknown, empty passageways. Each one revealed another small detail; the old sign for a long-demolished church, or the bloody history of a public house, or a blue plaque denoting a famous historical occupant. On each occasion Sherlock knew some additional detail that made the person or place more interesting.
“Of course!” Angelo waved John forward and motioned to the table in the window. “When my good friend Sherlock makes a reservation two years in advance, it’s a date you remember.”
“When he arrived he was perfectly calm,” The trauma nurse calls back in response from her position just a little too close to the patients flailing left arm, “We have no idea what set him off,”
The room they are about to enter used to be a classroom. He can still remember the way the desks were set out around the blackboard and recall the type of diagrams that were likely to have been drawn upon it: anatomy chalked in a shaky hand. Instead of all this however, when Mike leads him through the door it’s to be faced with banks of blank computers, set out in rows. It’s empty, apart from a single dark figure.
“No.” John laughs, looking up at him. “I love you, you great genius. I said it first. I’ll say it last.”
John,” He’s still smiling, “In the time we’ve been arguing we could have already been out the door,”
“No.” Sherlock replied assuredly, putting an end to the line of questioning. “The cards, it’s the cards that are the important thing: three murders, three cards.”
“What is it?” Sherlock asked, he was sitting at his kitchen table, cataloguing ash samples and contemplating writing to tell John about it.
From his pocket he produced a crumpled piece of receipt paper, holding it aloft so Moriarty could see. Moriarty looked at it in confusion.
Instead John rushed out into the centre of the empty street, waving desperately at a passing taxi and jumping into the backseat almost before it’d pulled to a complete stop.
Please let me know what you think: if you liked it, or hated it or feel you must shout at me for anything I've included or not included. Would anyone be interested in me continuing? If so, what would you like to see?
“Shaky start,” Lestrade continued with a smile, “But that might be the nicest I’ve ever seen you be to someone new.”
“It’s…?” John starts, eyes darting back and forth as he processes these words. “I don’t understand. Are you saying…?” He pauses, “Do you mean I made you come up here?”
He cracks an eye to find Sherlock in a near-identical pose as himself, head tipped back against the wall. Eyes closed. John closes his own eyes against the temptation to study his profile, thinking instead of the image they must project from the doorway. Side by side. Long and short. Cold and warm. Firm and soft. The black and the white. Identically positioned, like Yin and Yang: a part of each in each. Woven together.
“I’ve never…” Sherlock pauses, feeling his way “Never shared my life like this before. I thought that said enough. I didn’t think words were necessary.”
“Yes,” Lestrade made a decisive gesture and flicked back through his notebook, then lifted his gaze back to Sherlock’s, “We got something from the ex,” Lestrade repeated deadpan.
Before Mrs Hudson lets out a small whimper, leaning back against the doorframe behind her, her hand at her mouth as if to catch it.
Sherlock turned. Behind him, scrawled in garish yellow spray paint, seven feet high, was a single letter: ‘M’.
“Yeah,” Sherlock said, the word and tone so out of character that Lestrade looked over at him properly. Sherlock was acting.
The room on the other side was brighter and busier than he had ever seen it. Doctors and nurses moved to and fro, their green gowns and masks obscuring their faces and blurring their outlines against the dull green walls.
But John doesn’t have any chance to process anything further; his attention is brought suddenly back into the room by a heart-stoppingly familiar metallic click above him. John raises his eyes again slowly, he’d only dropped them for a second but Moran has used this momentary lapse of concentration to draw the gun that now ghosts close to John’s temple.
John finds himself momentarily lost without the attention of this peculiar stranger and turns to watch the suburbs of London flash past the window, seeping into the ragged edges of the countryside.
As he watches a man brushes past him, pushing his way through the revolving doors behind her and striding confidently up to the escalators himself. He’s wearing a long dark coat.
“I guess you were even there when you were dead, not that I knew that. It must have been…” John falters, starts again: “It must have taken a lot. To do that.”
“I,” John starts, but his throat closes up. Every single moment that seems to have led up to this one rushes behind his eyes like a montage: them, side by side. Two halves of the same.
“Lived here all my life.” Sherlock said, not quite answering the question, then, wanting to provide some confessions of his own: “Except for that short spell in rehab.”
“I wanted this.” John says in response to it, squeezing their clasped fingers minutely. “I dreamt we were… more. Than we are.”
Sherlock has sunk into the background while the doctor has been checking John over, trying, rather uncharacteristically, to become as small and unobtrusive as possible. John wonders whether this is some sort of behavioural conditioning created over time, it smacks of previous occasions when his disruptive nature has got him chastised or even removed.  John then wonders how many other times there had been.
“You’ve spoken to the lodger?” Sherlock asked instead, ignoring the pleasantries and leaping to the correct conclusion regarding her introduction into the conversation.
“Not really.” Sherlock considered not clarifying but realised that if he didn’t the conversation would be over. “Friend of a friend.”
“How did you know? That I’ve let people…” John asks, swallowing. “Something in the way I hold my tea?”
On principle, Sherlock did not enjoy Christmas. It was probably something to do with it being the time of goodwill and jolly Christmas lights, and the fact that all serial killers seemed to take the opportunity to have a festive break.
“Well,” John starts eventually, “You seem to know,” He pauses, “Everything, about me. And I don’t know a thing about you.”
Despite the cane John is stalking forward, toward a conveniently located shrubbery at the edge of the path. Behind it he completely expects he’ll find a crouching man looking up at him: glasses and a ruddy face and a suit that’s a little too tight for him.
Moriarty didn’t respond, just turned to place his cup and saucer very carefully on the surface beside him.
“You had time to see the engraving?” John asks, remembering those moments before as he handed over the phone.
“What are you talking about?” John asks in a groan. Fingers finding every patch of his skin he can reach, touching, grabbing, the memories.
Instead John sits alone beneath the searchlight of a stare, looking upward at a stranger with a strange sense of vertigo.
“John,” Sherlock repeats, as if testing it out, staring down at John with eyes so sharp and full of power that John partly wishes he would turn around again.
“And another.” Sherlock continued, his voice barely above a whisper, “Until you write the one that brings me here…”
“No,” The man confirmed. He was a stocky figure, shoulders so broad he looked uncomfortable even in the wide armchair he was sitting in.
“I,” John stretches out his legs, looks down at his hands. “I guess that vodka was stronger than I thought.” He tries lightly instead and hears a quiet laugh from behind him, the gravel of a breathy giggle.
“So far, no word on the time of death.” Lestrade said down the phone. It was 24 hours later, the crime scene had been processed and Sherlock had been summarily dismissed while the body was transported for medical examination.
“You’ll stand wherever I sodding well tell you!” Anger. There it is. It draws him up. Off the seat. Back onto his feet.
“I love you.” Sherlock says slowly. “Back then that is more than I ever would have thought possible.” Sherlock’s thumb brushes John’s cheek, “And the work is done.” He continues, “I have more than that to live for now.”
John doesn’t know what to do. Laugh? Cry? Fall to the floor and rend his clothes? Move forward and touch him? Hit him? Move away and pretend this hasn’t upset his entire world? Make him tea? Stand and stare in total silence for a length of time that should have made the other man uncomfortable, but hasn’t, because this is Sherlock Holmes, who if he hasn’t made half a dozen people uncomfortable before lunch it’s been a good day?
“It’s Doctor actually, but…” John is so lost in the conversation that it doesn’t seem fitting to begin to unravel it.
“I had my time in the sun,” She said as they turned together to start walking back the way she had come. “Seems like you’ve got it all under control up here now, no need for me.”
Away from his familiar surroundings Sherlock threw himself obsessively into the case. Scattering the details seemingly randomly across the four walls of his bedroom and linking them with pins and thread in a manner designed to find order in the chaos.
Instead he’d found himself a small studio in the strange no-man’s land between the West End and the City; a tiny blank room in a tiny blank block of flats which was both much more cane-friendly and more convenient for his new job at St Bart’s Hospital.
John goes back to staring down the abysmal coffee in front of him. The stranger’s attention on the street outside.
“John,” Sherlock’s voice, “You need to rest.” He’s laid his hand over John’s on the bed. His cool touch sears into John’s skin.
“The guys have always felt like family, you know?” John said as if justifying himself. He gestured vaguely back to the party, “We were in med school together.”
“What are you up to out here?” Mrs Hudson’s voice called from inside her flat, bringing him back to himself.
“And I’d hear you, sometimes,” John says in reply to it, “You’d be asking me to come back, to open my eyes. Sometimes it was the you in my dream, sometimes I think it was the real you, breaking through.”
“It’s my wife,” John finds himself answering, more to himself than in reply to the question. “Mary,”
“I don’t know.” John starts, his voice filled with wonderment, “I walked.” He offers, a suggestion rather than a fact.
“Morning.” John tries to say lightly, but his voice cracks. Anything that could have been an attempt at a joke lost in a croak.
The letters in one hand, the book in the other, John cast his eyes in another long sweep around the room. Remembering. Then he lowered himself slowly, to sit on the floorboards.
“Yes...” Sherlock cut him off, his gaze fixed on the wall above Lestrade head’s without really seeing it. His mind was elsewhere.
So that's it. I hope you don't hate me too much for chapters 6 & 7, or 8 for that matter, but they were questions I really enjoyed creating.
On the top of the pile was today’s newspaper, half the headline visible on the front page. He pushed a finger at it to unfold it properly:
“Partly.” Sherlock replies unhurriedly, “My mother and I have a… frosty relationship. My father died when I was small.”
“At the moment Sir the best thing for you to do is allow us to gather as much information as possible.” Lestrade placates, in much a similar tone as the uniformed officer had used before him. He offers her a nod as he speaks, dismissing her from the sofa and back to the blank press of uniforms currently stationed in John’s hallway.
Mike Stamford’s house was, on the surface, a rather unassuming brick terrace in a suburb of south west London. That was until you realised that in this suburb of south west London unassuming brick terraces sold for more than most could expect to earn in a lifetime.
“What are you going to do to them?” A pause, “My friends?” He clarified, pushing the words out tightly.
“I’m sorry to hear that,” Sherlock immediately mimics the same sentiment that John had offered previously, as if parroting emotion he isn’t familiar with.
“Then…” Sherlock cut in, but was interrupted in turn by Lestrade, who moved forward to stand beside him.
“Trade’s been a bit slow recently.” The owner tells the man, busying himself with finding the keys behind him, “But thank God for the demon hound!”
Of course. The man on the roof, the man on the pavement. It had been Sherlock. It explained why he hadn’t shown at Angelo’s, the reason that Molly and Greg no longer spoke.
John swallows. Aware the voice at the other end of the line is still talking but unable to hear a word.
John was pacing the corridor of 221, up and down. His footfalls were heavy and desperate, his chest rising and falling as if he’d just climbed eight flights of stairs.
“I want this.” John tells him, his voice breaking slightly as he continues: “I want this and it’s not happening.”
needed him? The work had seemingly been just fine before John had found some magical wormhole into the past and started sending letters through it.
Three years. Three years it had taken for the yarders to clear Sherlock’s name, and for the country to remember it. Now it was all John can do to manage to walk a street without seeing it. The media are on to him day and night for “his side of the story”, he’s had to unplug his phone.
“Back to London, or back to…” He wants to say ‘me’ but the internal censors are having none of that “…here?”
“Oh no, nothing interesting, I’m sure,” John found himself saying without really understanding why, tucking the sheet quickly into his jacket pocket. “Best be going,” He continued briskly.
So John dances, not too far gone to notice that of the people dancing by his side the vast majority are men: tall and short and big and small and blonde and brunette and muscled and slim and completely clothed and… not, but patently male, shockingly male. It’s not a surprise. This isn’t the first time he’s been to such a place, probably won’t be the last and though it’s not something John will shout from the hilltops when he’s dressed in full fatigues it’s not something he’ll be ashamed of.
“No need, I think we have all the information you can give us. And Sherlock seems to have…” As he speaks Lestrade looks about him. “Say, where is Sherlock?”
“What’s new about this one?” Sherlock continues, “You wouldn’t have called if there wasn’t something different.”
“Yes,” John agrees, thinking back, wondering when it was he had assumed it was a book. “Well, I might have to look it up sometime.”
“Yes,” John agrees “Though if there’s cake she can stay as long as she likes. I assume we have nothing to eat in the house?”
Sherlock stood statue still in front of the writing desk in the hallway of 221, staring hard at the pigeonhole. It was empty.
“You can’t just stand there being dead Sherlock. Come in.” John finds himself gesturing wildly at the doorway. “Come in out of the hallway. Dead men should always insult you from inside the house don’t you think?”
As if someone had hit the reset button John’s mind came suddenly back online and facts slowly started to realign themselves: building ideas, ideas that made sense..
“Why are you all the way over there?” John asks slowly. Remembered words. As he speaks he lifts his hand slowly, fingers outstretched toward a memory.
“You’re welcome,” She replied in a tone that showed she had no idea of the significance of the moment, “I’ll see you Monday,”
“…quite honestly Gerrard you really must stop confirming my suspicions that the lot of you are just as incompetent as I always suspected…”
“You’ll be quite safe,” he said, his cheek resting against the top of her head, “I would never let anything happen to you.” His voice was a low rumble. Her hands behind his back pressed him close.
Sherlock breaks the quiet, pulling his arm from between them to slip it around John, pulling him close.
“Mrs Hudson!” Sherlock bellowed from amid the mess of a dozen half-emptied boxes as he tossed the contents about desperately, “Mrs Hudson!” He called again.
John folded the reply, standing from the now familiar step in the hallway of 221 Baker Street to take his leave. He’d been sitting there so long his leg was stiff; a strange echo of an injury he’d never quite had.
The mugs are heavy in his hands as he carries them through into the sitting room. Through to the books and the papers and the notes of the sitting room. The chaos and the mess.
Instead he retreated to the staff canteen, quiet at this time of the evening, his hands shaking a little as he opened the first letter, dated two years and two months previous:
“Sherlock Holmes!” Angelo all but cries, “He’s sitting just over there.” He motions to a man sitting alone at a table, his pale skin and dark curls highlighted by the glow of Northumberland Street outside the window.
“What?” Sherlock asked, “Oh. No. That’s not what I meant. I meant stay for the party. Not for the…” He waved his hands, “The changing.”
“You took in my appearance and the value of my clothing, as well as the fact that I am keen to remain unnoticed when travelling with strangers and deduced I held some kind of commercial fame. An actor perhaps?”
“You always seem to know just when I’ve taken a cake out of the oven,” She joked as she ushered him inside.
“So two hours means…” And even as John starts the sentence he is interrupted by the same toneless female voice over the train loudspeaker, announcing their imminent arrival at Leeds.
“You do?” John pulled back, running his hand across his face to chase away the tracks of his tears, as Sherlock slipped a hand into his own inside jacket pocket, pulling free a very flimsy piece of receipt paper.
“Mary Morstan,” Her smile broadened as she decided to trust him, “Any friend of theirs is a friend of mine. This way,”
“They can stay outside,” She called after him as he neared the door, and Sherlock felt that smile tick the side of his mouth again.
“It’s good to see you.” He replies, his voice feeling less rough than before, “How long have I been asleep?”
John keeps the stranger’s eyes as he’s bundled past. A familiar stranger. Someone who is and isn’t someone that John knows. Someone who’s dead. Someone who has been dead for three years and spoke to him through a phone while his image still stood before him. But this man isn’t him. John knows that. The same way he knows that this is happening. That this has happened.
“We let her go,” Lestrade had an uncanny ability to grow calmer the more irate Sherlock became. Perhaps that was the secret of their working so well together. “She wasn’t charged with anything. It was never a case.” He shrugged.
John decided, as he watched Mike head back inside for the next round, that he was very pleased that he had come.
“Yes, though frankly the whole thing was a bit more complicated than I would have given him credit for. No DNA evidence, no fingerprints, place had been wiped clean.”
“Can you tell me how you’re feeling?” The doctor has paused by John’s chart, looking something over. John notices his name badge: Doctor Osborne.
“Obvious,” The word was high and drawn out, before he abruptly switched back to a normal tone: “I thought I owed you a visit.”
John searches through the pockets on his coat to retrieve his oyster card, looking up apologetically to meet the driver’s eye as he fails to locate it.
“No,” He looked away from them, back at his hands, “No, we weren’t ‘out’ in the papers yet. I wanted to be,” He added quickly, “But her people said it would be better if everyone thought she was single. She was more ‘available’ that way,”
Sherlock doesn’t respond from beside him and John doesn’t have the nerve to check his reaction. Instead he presses on.
“Victim is female,” Lestrade said as Sherlock approached, “Sylvia Jones, thirty-eight, self-employed, lived alone...” Lestrade turned to lead him through the building,
“Yes,” She continued brightly, unaware of his struggle, “He’d been in a few times, I’d seen him, around the hospital,”
“I was just popping out for a few things for Sherlock,” She tells him pleasantly as they walk side by side some minutes later, John bearing the brunt of the carrying duties and feeling faintly relieved that she hadn’t attempted to carry everything on her own.
Moving through to the kitchen he scanned the empty cupboards, then circled back to the hall and put his head through into the bedroom.
“You were there.” He almost yells back at him, as if to explain. “A patient. It was here. I woke up, you asked me if I could hear you. Who are you!? What’s happening!?” John seems to have crested the peak of his panic now.
A few seconds pass and Sherlock appears around the doorway, pausing on the threshold and leaning himself against the frame. He’s left his coat in the kitchen, probably draped across the back of one of the chairs, and now wears just his dark suit and deep purple shirt.
“She was never in any danger,” Sherlock assured him, smiling slightly, “There were more officers here that morning than there were left at New Scotland Yard. I made sure of it.”
John laughed, watching her retreating figure and allowing his hand to steal into the pocket of his white coat, the corner of the letter crinkling under his searching fingers.
“Yes.” John tips his head back against the pillows with a sigh. While beside him Sherlock leans forward, his hand reaching onto the bed to cover John’s in a movement that seems practised. So practised that it takes a moment for Sherlock to realise he’s done it. He moves to draw his hand away but John catches it.
“They had help.” Sherlock announced to him quickly, finally meeting his eye again. “A consultant. A consulting criminal.”
“You did,” John laughed, his face carefree, either from the company or the beer, Sherlock couldn’t be sure, “You also said I’d be showing it off outside.”
Sherlock can’t help but look impressed at himself “Spot on then. I didn’t expect to be right about everything.”
John casts around the room. Looking much as it did the day before. Where are Sherlock’s things? He had arrived last night seemingly with just the clothes on his back. No bag. No evidence to say he was moving back in. Perhaps he has gone to fetch them.
“Yes,” Lestrade interjects, glaring at Sherlock, “I’m sorry, we realise that. Sherlock thinks that her disappearance may be one in a line of similar events.”
“Yes, although it’s not him you’re currently leaving London to visit.” The strangers continues, as if what he is saying is as easy as informing John of the quickest way to the nearest post office, “You wouldn’t go to him because you don’t approve of him – possibly because he’s an alcoholic; more likely because he recently walked out on his wife.”
“He could be dead in four hours,” John said plainly, holding her gaze for as long as it took her to shrug a response.
“That she did.” John is still looking pointedly at the sheet of paper in front of him without reading a word. He’s using it to hide his smile.
“You think Moriarty has something to do with this just because of some heavy-handed alliteration in a headline?”
“Yes.” John lifts the hand that isn’t holding Sherlock’s to bring it to that face, “It’s probably time I stopped.”
It was thirty minutes later; all the details had been taken down and an officer called to read Mr Osborne his rights. They’d taken their leave as the officer entered, moving into the corridor.
Mrs Hudson was silent, aware that this was likely more significant than it might sound on the surface. They both contemplated the ticking of the kitchen clock.
Mrs Hudson doesn’t mention it of course, full of eagerness and enthusiasm she escorts them with joy back through a familiar front door, finally disappearing again back into 221a with the assurances that she will be up presently to provide them with the cake that currently cloys the air with sweetness.
“Fine thank you” Sherlock looks at him with an air of impatience. “Worry will only be counterproductive to extracting any useful information from the man.”
Weeks slipped by before John could bring himself to go back to 221 to leave Sherlock the reply to his last note.
“Well, if you’re sure.” She’s letting herself into her flat. “You just go back and make yourself some tea now, wake yourself up, you look still lost in a dream”
“You’re attending the staff Christmas party?” He asked a figure moving towards him in the hallway. Judging by the confident way she was navigating the baffling topography of the building she clearly worked there, but her attire was not that of a medical professional. Instead it could only be, what could be described as, festive.
“I must apologise if I’ve given you the wrong impression.” Sherlock continues, this other Sherlock, not the one of a few minutes previous.
The letter continued, pointing out a lesser-known music hall, famous for its acoustics and classical concerts, which spoke more to the interests of the writer than it informed the reader. Then a hidden garden on top of an electricity substation, it’s green foliage and pretty benches accessible only by a vertigo-inducingly steep staircase. Then the previous address of a soviet spy. All the while he walked John never felt alone, as if Sherlock lingered close beside him or somewhere up ahead; just out of sight.
“What should I be expecting of this evening then?” He asked as he grew uncomfortable with the eye contact.
“No,” There’s fear creeping into Sherlock’s calm tone too, not obviously, but John can tell. He knows that voice almost as well as his own.
“That I love you.” Sherlock succeeds in taking that step forward. One foot. Books, papers, notes, wood floor and three little words.
“When we spoke to you previously Mr Osborne you claimed you knew nothing about the business card we found with your things,” Lestrade said to the man sitting opposite them over the interview room table.
Sherlock concluded as John reached the end of the letter, the ghost of his hand brushing against the back of John’s as they walked.
But this time the evidence seems so damning that he doesn’t race to confirm it. John could not have failed to notice the scattered pieces of broken china across the carpet of the sitting room when he stood there previously.
In short order John found himself standing again on the peripheries of the St Bart’s Christmas party, tinsel strung around his neck as the holiday colours blurred into a swirl of movement around him. Between long pulls on his warming beer he was watching his girlfriend and best friend chatting easily across the room, their blonde and brunette heads bent close together.
Finding what he was looking for John immediately caught the arm of a harried looking blonde nurse walking by.
But something isn’t quite right with those eyes. Irises so pale they blur into the whites, pupils wide pits of desire. Too wide.
Glancing behind him to make sure John’s retinue were far enough away Sherlock moved forward toward the bench they’d all been crowded beside. On it was a battered old paperback, forgotten.
Sherlock took an aborted step toward him, unable to tramp down the swell of anger in his stomach. It must have flashed on his face.
“Right, well I should…” John said, gesturing to the train with one hand and wrapping the palm of the other around the back of his neck in a bashful gesture that looked like something he might do often.
“And in the event that you won’t tell me this.” Moran continues, ignoring him, “I would like you to provide the means for my finding him on my own.”
The stranger turns to look at him properly for the first time, John has to limp forward to him to hand it over.
“He does that.” Lestrade supplied, after he’d deemed enough time had passed and Sherlock was unlikely to offer anything in response. “What about her image?”
“Are you going to tell me what’s going on, Sherlock?” She asked, watching him, surprisingly level-headed. “I don’t see you for months and then you just…”
they have... We work best alone, you and I.” Moriarty paused expectantly, but received only a cool stare in response. “We have no use for them, but they… They
“Right.” He pulled a notebook out of his jacket pocket and jotted something down. “Can I ask why you’re back?”
John sat down hard on the second step, his gaze shooting between the letter in his hands and the old writing desk before him.
The facts would continually spiral through Sherlock’s over-active brain at all hours of the day and night, making rest impossible. He’d regularly pace the room way into the early hours, running over the options time and again, until the walls would blur together in a confusing cacophony of newsprint and red marker and he’d curse his inadequate brain, or his inadequate resources, to finish what he’d started.
“Are you here?” John calls, pushing the door of 221B closed behind him with his foot, juggling his keys in one hand and stack of paperwork in the other.
“Thank you,” He repeated softly, “For being my nurse. And for telling me.” He was aware that things were rising up that he couldn’t handle, he coughed to cover it. “Can I get you a drink?”
“What the hell?!” John’s voice is a little too loud as he moves forward into the room, arms reaching out to the patient’s shoulders in an attempt to press him back against the bed.
The moment Mike said it he stopped, awkwardly. It seemed to have become some unwritten rule with them that they didn’t mention the army, or anything that had come with it. Mike had just broken that rule.
That was what he had wanted to see. He had even asked for it once. Right out loud. Standing beside a gravestone.
“So you think Mary has disappeared because I’m, good-looking?” Half an hour ago John would have been willing to wager good money that his evening could not get any stranger, it seems he has just lost that bet.
“I was right?” There is an edge of panic in his voice as John speaks, his hand burning as if branded. “Right about what?”
“Wouldn’t say no,” The big man beside John replies quickly in a faint cockney accent. For some reason John can’t quite remember his name. He looks around to the rest of the group instead, their muttered repetitions of assent causing him to turn finally and push himself through the crush toward the bar.
Despite his eagerness however, London did not comply that morning. Traffic meant his cab arrived at the station with only a few minutes to spare, and he was forced to push roughly through the crowds of commuters and tourists to search the board for the right departure.
“Yes, you…” Sherlock paused. Noticing something. “I’ve got post?” He asked, spying the writing desk, probably for the first time.
“John,” Sherlock seems to have found his voice, he speaks with a resolve that matches the heavy look in his astonishing eyes.
A murmur of laughter followed by words exchanged too low for Sherlock to hear. Much back slapping and brief, manly hugging ensued before John jumped up into the train and his three companions turned to walk away.
John can watch the understanding of his own words pass across Sherlock’s pale eyes, a visible representation of the effects of alcohol. Sherlock breaks eye contact. Starts to pace again.
There’s a pause as they contemplate each other before John shifts, pushing himself to his feet carefully and reaching out to help Sherlock up.
“Every fairy tale needs a good old-fashioned villain,” Moriarty stared up into Sherlock’s unreactive face, “I’m a specialist, you see…” He paused, eyes widening in mock realisation, “Like you!”
“No problem dear, I’m sorry if I woke you.” She’s referring to his pyjamas; John has the strength of mind to look down bashfully at himself.
They all laughed. Sherlock, assuming the woman they referred to must be Mike’s wife, silently agreed.
“Height, weight, experience, time, concentration, strength…” Sherlock continues, still a noticeable slur on the final word.
“Just because that brain of yours is bigger than the average person’s,” John addresses the ceiling, “Doesn’t mean it won’t react exactly the same way with enough beer.”
“Just do as I ask,” The man turns back from his shoulder and looks out again into the emptiness, adding: “Please.”
“I can’t even…” John looks back down at the photograph, feeling useless. Above him Sherlock and Lestrade have started talking furiously, their words barely more than angry mutterings. Something in the photograph, John wonders, but there’s nothing there. A woman in a green dress. A lot of people looking cheerful.
Suddenly everything about Moriarty’s demeanour changed: a smile brightening his face as he leant back to cross one leg over the other.
He was standing alone on a corner of a Soho street, the guide that had walked with him thus far having abruptly turned and left as if with the dramatic swing of a coat. Deflated, John turned a final time, back toward the tube station that would take him home.
“In publishing. Fleet Street. Look I’m sure I’ve told you this…” He’s getting agitated again, tired of playing the game.
“No.” Mr Osborne jumped in quickly. “You only asked me about the card. Before. I didn’t know anything about a card.”
John watched them idly. Wondering at what he learnt about his friend and considering what she could have lost. Inevitably, with thoughts of loss, his thoughts turned to Sherlock.
“No,” Again John won’t let him, he likes the feeling of that hand in his, it seems familiar in a way that nothing else does at the moment. “Well yes, but…” He opens his eyes to look at Sherlock again. “The doctor said you’d been here all this time?” John asks him
John opens his eyes, rolling his head along the wall to face Sherlock beside him. Somehow he’s not surprised to find a pair of gunmetal eyes staring back him. Expressionless. Lost.
“John!” She repeats. That motherly concern at a desperate pitch “John, I heard shouting! Are you? Are you alright?”
John stops, turning to see a man rise from the bench he’s just hobbled past. It seems to take a long time; his long dark frame extenuated by a longer darker coat. Above it a thick black head of hair and a pale face, wide eyes looking down at him expectantly.
The next day found him standing in front of that old familiar front door of 221 Baker Street. He’d not been able to think of anyone he could tell everything to, but what Molly had said about having someone that looked after him, that part rang true.
“It’s… It’s. How.” John looks at him desperately. Where to start. “If it was, as you say, necessary. Then.” A blockage, in John’s throat. “ Suicide Sherlock. Suicide is never right”
“Just returned from a business trip to India, very successful by the looks of things. Coffee lover. Recent break up with his long-term boyfriend. Interest in ornithology. Keen gardener but hasn’t had enough time to enjoy it recently with all the bad weather we’ve been having. Left handed.” Sherlock rattled off,
Another pause, they both watch as the ticket inspector lumbers up the carriage, punching tickets and chatting as he goes, until finally, he disappears out of sight.
In a blur Mary had left again, crossing the room to greet a nurse coming towards her as if they were long lost relatives.
“Are you behaving, Dad?” A female voice chimes brightly from behind John, rescuing him. He turns in time to see a woman breeze past him, three boys under the age of ten trailing at her heels.
As one the two men turn to look at him and John finds he can only really think to smile in response, a little bashful of his complete redundancy up until this point.
John had had many things on the tip of his tongue to say about “Just being in the area,” and just “Calling by to see how you were doing.” But none of them were necessary. Instead he allowed himself to be herded inside, barely speaking a word as he followed her through to that cosy front room, the comfort blanket of her chatter immediately soothing away the dark thoughts of the days before.
“Yes.” John finally strangles out. Wanted it to be true: No. Understood it: No. Believed his own two eyes: Yes.
“Would it help if I kissed you now?” Sherlock has to know the effect that pitch of voice has on him.
“Detective Sergeant Donovan, Sherlock Holmes,” Lestrade introduced her as she got within nodding distance.
“I’ve not asked…” She said finally in a very quiet voice and John tensed, “I don’t know where you’ve been, or why you walk with that cane…” John took a breath in, “And I won’t,” She continued, and he breathed it back out. “But I just wanted you to know,” She paused again, assessing. Assessing whether or not he wanted to hear what she wanted to say. She seemed to decide. “I wanted you to know that I’m here. If you wanted to tell me any of that. Any time. And, I guess, to say. I hope there is someone. Someone out there that you can tell these things to. Someone that looks after you.”
“Yes.” John pauses “It doesn’t matter what you think your actions said up until that point. That pretty much negated everything that went before it.”
“Dear God,” Sherlock’s deep voice rolls, “What is it like in your funny like brains? It must be so boring.”
“Mrs Hudson is out of her mind with worry,” Sherlock continues, his tone softening a little but his eyes never losing their intensity, “I can barely deal with her. You need to come back, John. You need to come back and deal with her.”
He also knew that it was likely that there was a letter waiting for him but had told himself that it was incidental and not the main reason he’d gotten himself out of bed early on his only day off.
“Just,” Sherlock’s voice softens marginally, “Just describe it to me. What happened before this conversation?”
Once they’d made it to her kitchen she stood in the centre of it in confusion, Sherlock whirling about the room, checking everything he could think of. The officers took up posts in the hall and doorway.
“That’s what I tell people, though I fear I struggle in the art of actually producing prose that others both understand and enjoy.”
He was running the words of his letter over and over in his mind, already memorised, repeating them to himself like a mantra.
Sherlock was holding John’s hand now to stop himself reaching for his face, to stop him smoothing John’s too-long hair across his temple or tracing those worry lines across his forehead.
“Look, she’s left us a lot of sh… stuff to sort out,” The receptionist said lifting his eyes back to them and not answering his question, “I’m swamped.”
“Just a few bits,” Mrs Hudson she clarified, when she saw the expectant look in his eyes. He dropped quickly down the stairs and plucked them from the pigeonhole.
The stranger offers them nothing but vague disinterest, sitting himself down again with his back turned toward them.
“No, no, no, no this is too easy!” He cried, to the space beyond the edge of the roof, before turning back at Sherlock, his face manic: “Three bullets; three gunmen; three victims, there’s no stopping them now!” His voice raised to a shout.
The card was the same as the other times they’d seen it, but the message, scrawled in thick black letters across the front, was new:
“Yes.” Sherlock responds. Their conversation conducted without any real words having been spoken at all.
“But what if your mind were particularly susceptible? To see those things it imagined.” The tempo of Sherlock’s words seems to be speeding up.
His words are confident, spoken with weight and an air of the dramatic. They cause John’s world to pause for a second, tilting gently in his mind at a familiar name spoken by familiar lips. Something tugs at his subconscious. This is wrong.
“Oh no, I did that on my own.” Sherlock said, with his familiar self-assuredness, John smiled again, “But he underestimated their import. He knew nothing of you, how could he? He didn’t know I’d changed, he relied on me trying to face him alone.”
“Not the tabloids,” John answers honestly, having reached his own conclusions about where this character would most likely have been catalogued.
Then John had risked a glance at the man beside him and answered his own question. Sherlock was undeniably gorgeous: marble skin and dark hair and eyes that seemed endless. John had been unable to keep his thoughts from what he would look like beneath that heavy coat and deep purple shirt.
“The woman in the green dress. She’s not happy.” John repeats, looking up and finding their collective gaze fixed on him, “Everyone else is smiling, except her.”
“Of course not! My goodness, the day he turned up on my doorstep. He was half out of his mind already, full of worry and impossible stories about hit men and kidnappings. I thought I was imagining things, he seemed to have forgotten that I thought he was dead!” She laughs a little, “He thought that being back in the flat would help him. Of course once I got over my surprise I let him in, managed to get the story out of him in fits and starts, lots of cups of tea. Couldn’t tempt him to eat though, or sleep. He’d just pace up and down in the flat. But he was so worried, we all were.”
Sherlock paused before replying, studying John’s face with that singular focus, before stepping a single pace forward.
“You were a good distraction. For a while.” A sigh. “But now I don’t even have you. Because I’ve beaten you.”
“Sherlock?” It was Mycroft’s voice that drew Sherlock out of his mind palace sometime later. “What are you doing in my chair?”
John sits alone in the centre of a row of empty chairs, trying to distract himself from his surroundings by studying the ancient magazines arranged on the table beside him. He’s nervous. They always say that doctors make the worst patients.
“And all of the husbands were of a certain…” Sherlock falters for the first time. “Appearance.” He finishes finally.
Sherlock turned to leave suddenly, stepping back away from the bed. He was disappointed to have to cut the visit short but knowing he wouldn’t be able to keep explaining himself for long,
A pause, punctuated with a crackling announcement for the next station. They have to wait until it’s finished to continue.
ask. I wouldn’t have, before I met you. But if I had. If I had known to ask for help; even if I’d done everything as I did. Moriarty was clever. He still managed to lure me into a place where I thought that jumping was my only option. And I might have done it. If it hadn’t been for that last letter.”
“Reminiscing,” Mary replied coyly. She took the beer from his hands and took a long drink, turning to look back at the room rather than at him, “We’ve worked together for ages, but never really gotten to know each other.”
John is hurrying to an appointment when he rounds a bend and walks full pelt into a stranger. A stranger carrying coffee.
“And for how much longer am I to have the pleasure of your sunshine in the morning?” Mycroft asked, his back to him,
“Moriarty liked to find the uncomplicated in the complicated.” Sherlock begins. “Enough money in the right person’s pocket, enough leverage, he could get anything he wanted.”
“No,” John decided he couldn’t tell him he didn’t have his number. Why hadn’t he asked for his number?
As she elaborates John has the bizarrely pleasant sensation of being present only as her obedient sounding board.
The note that Sherlock was holding flapped nauseatingly in the wind and he grasped it tighter, moving it back to his trouser pocket as Moriarty abruptly lurched toward him.
“It’s what people do, don’t they – leave a note?” Out of nowhere Sherlock has started to cry. His strong face caving in.
When they reach the top of the staircase they don’t break contact, both pretending not to notice as Sherlock leads them through the door and into the flat.
Obviously he’d complained. Loudly. Then asked if they knew who he was, or even who his brother was. Finally, he’d asked them to locate Lestrade, and stood back to wait. That was when his hand had brushed the envelope in his pocket, and to smooth his nerves he’d pulled out the letter. Only for the world to stop.
The stranger lowers his gaze from John’s for a moment before twitching the side of his mouth in a half smirk. He raises his eyes again as he speaks:
Then abruptly the tranquil effigy before him leaps to life; turning to snatch his shirt and coat from the puddles they have made on the floor before disappearing through the door they had so recently entered through. From his position still rumpled on a strange sofa, John can hear as Sherlock dashes back downstairs. The front door slamming behind him with an ominous clatter of finality.
“Yes, god you were annoying on the rooftop. You knew what was going on. You tried to explain my own subconscious to me.”
“No sign of trauma,” She said, opening a door, “Bloodwork normal.” With a surprising amount of strength she pulled the drawer inside toward them, revealing the body of a man. “I couldn’t find any cause of death at all until...” She turned over the left arm of the victim and showed them a tiny mark.
“I’ll be here when you wake up.” Sherlock replies, not needing to hear the end of the sentence to understand.
“The last piece of the puzzle.” Sherlock replies, “Since I left I’ve been tracking the people that worked with Moriarty. Moran was, for all intents and purposes, Moriarty’s right hand man.”
“I suppose not.” There’s a half smile on Sherlock’s face as he responds, acquainted by now with the strange nuances of John’s dreaming.
“This is my mistake!” Angelo has stepped back a little. He turns to Sherlock “It seems you are too late,” He offers, shaking his head.
At some point while the stranger has been casting a spell of words across the table he has leaned closer to John, covering the back of his hand with his own amid the stripes on the formica. His cool touch sears into John’s skin.
“I trusted you to handle it.” Sherlock sat forward in his seat toward him. “What, exactly, did he say?”
“Oh,” The inspector looks a little put out, “Guess that makes sense. They say Sherlock Holmes is a genius, can’t see him getting on the wrong train,”
He held it firmly by the back of the head, staring into the blank pits of eye sockets. He’d not realised it was still with his things, assumed it had been discarded when those thugs had boxed up his belongings all those months ago.
“Tell me about the case,” She asked. They were sitting across from each other at her small kitchen table, the hot cross buns warm and buttered on a plate between them.
“He folded pretty quickly on the confession front though.” Lestrade continued, ignoring Sherlock’s snark “Sounds like our vic’ was trying his best to push his brother out of the business.”
He found him in the front sitting room. John was standing in the window, surrounded again by a small gaggle of men. It was obviously the same group as on the platform, but this time John wasn’t dressed in fatigues, instead he wore a plain t-shirt and jeans, a beer held up in front of him like a shield.
The other passengers around them are standing now, retrieving bags and coats, fussing with children and belongings. John can feel the motion of the train slow, watching out the window as the platform reaches up in welcome along it’s side.
“Really?” The man replies, John can only watch, “I thought it was a big improvement. Mouth’s too small now.”
John looks up in time to watch two men dash past along the river side, knocking into tourists and pedestrians carelessly as they go. The man in pursuit wears a long coat that flaps dramatically behind him like a comic book hero.
“Oh,” John offers in understanding, remembering the name above the door. He turns to the man politely, “Nice place you have here,”
“So,” John offers in greeting as he rounds the flimsy wall of curtain in a treatment room. “Good afternoon, Mr…?”
John had been in Sainsbury’s when he met her: the fragile looking older lady with a floral blouse and a sparkle in her eye. She’d stalked past him with her three heavy shopping bags and almost made it out the door before one carrier had split, littering the floor with an array of recently purchased foodstuffs.
As usual, if you're interested in keeping up to date with other bits and pieces I'll be uploading, including a possible new idea I have at the drawing board stage, I keep everything updated on my tumblr blog, find me under Qalets.
Flick off the kettle. The automatic shut off had broken, some time ago, he should get that fixed. Without manual intervention it would continue to boil in perpetuity, steam rising from the spout and pooling upward against the underside of the cupboard above.
“They’re down there?” John asks, wondering faintly whether it is indeed a good idea to keep bringing this stranger’s attention back to the gulf before him, but, well, John would be surprised if he hadn’t already noticed it by now.
“No!” John’s anger feels like a physical being in the room. Standing between them. A yawning space: six feet and books and papers and notes and Mrs Hudson’s nice wood floor and rage.
His eyes fall closed again at the realisation and he takes a moment to do a mental assessment of the aches and niggles in his body. Ribs broken, he notes through the pain in his breathing, head sore, throat dry but all limbs seemingly present and correct.  He tenses his fingers and toes to make sure, noticing his right hand seems weighted down; he has to crack his eyes again to look down at it.
“That would be me.” Lestrade said, sitting back in his chair and crossing his arms in defiance of Sherlock’s ire.
“If you had to explain 2010 to someone, how would you do it?” John asked, a little out of the blue. Molly looked at him.
John closes his eyes and tips his head back against the tile, Sherlock’s image replaced by sound. Shoes on the linoleum.
John finds himself throwing a disbelieving glance at Mike, before turning to address the back of the retreating figure.
Later the party came together in the kitchen to sing a spectacularly painful rendition of Happy Birthday to the man of the hour. Cake was cut. Mike thanked John for being there in the embarrassing speech that followed, showing his not insignificant amount of pride at his friend.
Despite their parted lips his head still retains that woozy feeling, heightened by the fact that Sherlock hasn’t let him retreat far, his face pressed forward against John’s, foreheads rested together. John wonders idly how uncomfortable it must be for Sherlock leaning over the bed like that, then wonders why he’s worried about Sherlock when he is the one in hospital, then why he can’t seem to concentrate on one thing for more than a second. Then what drugs they must have him on.
Despite the fact that he must have known that it was coming, a significant amount of the colour drained from the man’s face as the name was spoken.
“So when was the last time you saw your wife Sir?” She asks, sitting beside him, her voice full of professional concern.
“So you’re saying that this note from John is actually from M… the one you think is behind all this?”
“You do realise that my bedroom is infinitely closer John?” His tone is low, but obvious. Always obvious.
London geek alert: Shout out to my guidebook collection for most of the detail of Sherlock's tour of London. Everything is completely true and it is a feasible route, that I might have spent a little too long mapping, created as a combination of three of three different guided walks. If anyone is interested in further details I'd be more than happy to talk (at length) to them about it! Let me know in the comments, or on my tumblr: Qalets.
Letting himself in through the familiar front door, he passed silently along the hallway. He knew now which floorboards squeaked, where to put his feet on the deepest parts of the rug to avoid the click of his soles. He paused at the writing desk as he passed, slipping his hand into the empty pigeonhole and resting it there, as if in absolution.
John nods, resigned. He had been pretty sure that that would be the kind of answer he’d get. He tries a different tack:
There’s a pause. John tilts his face to look over at him, studies his dark profile against the murk of the room.
“You did?” He asked, feigning interest but knowing it was exactly the kind of inconsequential detail that he would have deleted immediately
“Yes.” Sherlock says with a sigh. He tips his face forward slowly to John, resting their foreheads together, John has to drop his hand from his cheek, “I’m tired of people not understanding your worth.” He starts slowly, his breath against John’s face. “I’m tired of idiot receptionists. I’m tired of Doctor Osborne,”
“My name,” The man replies, his deep voice imbibing the words with an authority that matches the confidence of his posture: “Is Sebastian Moran.” It’s spoken like a threat.
“You missed one.” John means to say it under his breath, but his words coincide with a pause in Sherlock’s.
She looked up at him, offering an unconvincing smile and reaching up to pat his hand on her shoulder.
It was late and the lights in the room were turned low, an allowance made presumably to allow the patient to rest, though it was negated by the noise the monitors made in their constant vigil.
“Yes. I can’t speak for that other Sherlock, the one in your time, but my instinct is that he wouldn’t have asked for help, he wouldn’t have had anyone
“Not my idea of fun,” Lestrade offers, he’s taken the photograph from John and is studying the background in much the same way the other two men had done before him.
“Indirectly,” Lestrade continues, “If Mary has indeed been taken by the same person or people that were involved in the other disappearances…” He looks up to Sherlock as if for confirmation, none is provided, “Then, possibly,” Another pause, “Yes.”
Sherlock glares at the man in response as he turns away to check the tickets of the passengers behind them. John can barely suppress his laughter:
“Yes,” Sherlock passed the desk again, right to left. “No one else seemed to think it was important.”
He steps forward a little further, skirting the edge of a ventilation duct and looking around at the rest of the space. Then sees him: a tall figure looming vividly against the pale London sky, some distance away and far too close to the edge. The man’s height is exaggerated by the fact that he stands balanced on the concrete lip running around the edge of the roof – a thick raised foot of stone between them and the sudden drop to the pavement.
“Sorry?” John asks, moving from his face to take in the stranger’s smart suit and thick coat. The pub is warm, John’s sweating in his shirtsleeves, he has no idea how this man can stand it.
His name is unspoken on John’s lips as he dashes across the landing and onto the staircase. Looking down.
“Don’t…” He cautions. Sherlock freezes in the headlights of John’s gaze, one step further into the room, “Just…” John continues, “…don’t.”
John fidgeted with his cufflinks, a little embarrassed by the effort he’d made. He must have tried almost everything in his wardrobe before he’d settled on what to wear. He regretted the shirt.
Their fingers tighten together where they still lie on the sheets, John couldn’t say which one of them had moved to do it first.
Disappointed, John looks away from her. Back at the faded grey blue of the hospital blanket draped over his legs.
“Yes.” Sherlock agrees, “Or rather they were permitted to make the information public. It was the first step.”
“Well,” She breezes, “This really has knocked him sideways. Not like him to go about expressing his feelings.”
“Look,” John jumps in toward Lestrade, aware now that this is the man in charge and clearly the one he should be speaking to, “This is ridiculous,” John repeats, “Surely there are other things I can be doing than being questioned about my wife’s tube habits?”
“It’s your favourite,” She said as if it explained everything. She moved forward to slip it from the peg and drape it across the top of the bag he was holding.
“Well then. Why’s that? Nice young man like you. Caring. A doctor! I’d have thought you have them lined up down the street. But you’re seeing someone?”
“Oh,” Sherlock seems to realise something “John, um,” And starts to struggle conversationally as much as John had previously, “While I’m flattered…”
John pays him little attention, pulling out his mobile and contemplating the idea of calling Mary, until noticing the time and realising she’ll be busy.
“I’ve seen a lot of people die,” John breaks the silence. Four feet and books and papers and notes and Mrs Hudson’s nice wood floor and experience.
John is drowning in the feeling of holding him. He pulls him down with him, desperate and clinging, so that they both end up on the floor, on their knees amid the mess. John can feel the warmth of that marble face. The blood rushing beneath the surface. Can hold Sherlock’s thoughts in his hands and the taste the shape of the words he has said.
He considered the morning’s exchange now as he moved around in his little kitchen, putting the kettle on for tea and sniffing experimentally at the milk. He smiled to himself at the tone of the letters, shaking his head in disbelief not at the fact that this person seemed to be writing from some time in the past, but that he could know enough from John’s short lines to ask about Afghanistan.
Lestrade, already off the radio, nodded his assent and the surrounding figures scattered to their vehicles. Lestrade went one way, Sherlock another, something Lestrade only realised as they both had one foot in different cars.
He stirs slowly, allowing the conscious reality of that light to sink in. He hadn’t drawn the curtains last night. He had been distracted.
“I see your insomnia doesn’t improve your manners,” His brother acknowledged, moving past him to his space-age coffee machine and placing the few things he’d been carrying on the countertop between them.
John, mug to lips, feels suddenly rooted to the spot. “I meant about Molly,” He forces himself to sip.
“I guess we have to fight off the hordes of well-wishers next,” John tells him, “I spoke to Harry, she said she’d drop round. And Molly for that matter.”
This time there is a grin on John’s face as he closes the gap between them, mouths fitting together with tenderness and familiarity. That remembered passion bubbling just under the surface.
Sherlock contemplated the words for a few moments. Look after his home? He wondered, looking back up the stairs toward his flat. Moving boxes were still visible at the top.
“John, what’s wrong?” From two paces away John watches the light come back on in Sherlock’s eyes, concern growing in their deep blue pools as they watch the obvious fear in John’s face.
“So is mine,”” Sherlock is frustratingly calm. “It was necessary that I died, it was necessary that you watched me,”
“Can I ask who the woman is in the photograph is Dr Watson?” It’s Sherlock’s voice that brings John back into the room, he’s moved closer, his tall figure looming imposingly,
He’d spied it on his way in but hadn’t had any opportunity to collect it, instead he’d hoped to take it on his way out, as had become his routine. Instead he had been granted all the time in the world to peruse it alone.
“Erm, yes,” And the room is fuller still for the figure of Sherlock, who has left John in the doorway to move in front of him, whirling this way and that: “I’ve not… Been here... A great deal,” He says as he busies himself: cane handed back to John, union jack pillow rehomed from floor to chair, haphazard pile of books retrieved from the carpet, five empty tea mugs rescued from their mysterious hiding places around the room. John watches him carry them through to the kitchen.
“It’s just,” John starts again, a rabbit hole he’d had no intention of falling down, “Now I’m wondering.” John continues haltingly, “I’m getting married. And you don’t know.” A pause. “I guess that’s because I’ve never said. It’s probably the beer talking, but I guess there’s something. I should say. I mean, I’ve meant to say it. Well, always. And then never have.”
John’s good mood lasted a few days, a feeling not dissimilar to the glow generated by a great date. But the workload at the hospital continued to be as challenging as ever and it was only Tuesday when he found his smile beginning to wear down. It didn’t help that the date coming up was a familiar one.
They’re soft. Their press firm and gloriously responsive. This time there is no awkward stillness as Sherlock controls his surprise. This time from the moment their mouths connect they are on fire. They both want this, they’ve both, in different ways, been waiting for it.
“Your face is tanned but no tan above the wrists. You’ve been abroad, but not sunbathing. The fading of the tan lines and the relative lack of upkeep on the haircut however say you’ve been out of the military some while, six months perhaps, definitely not yet a year. Wounded in action I’d wager from the cane you have hidden down the side of the seat and the fact that you’ve been making do on just a military pension since your return.”
“It’s staged for me...” Sherlock continued, paying Lestrade as much attention as he usually did at these times, which was to say: very little.
“Yeah, I…” John glances back to where his friends are still standing chatting, they’re barely aware that he is gone. “I can just take these over for them and come back, if you like?”
John has that feeling again of viewing the scene as if circling around it. The entwined figures of their bodies in the centre of the room, surrounded by ghosts. The books and the papers and the notes and the secrets. Touching and grabbing and holding and hurting.
“Yes.” John’s word is slightly strangled. Trust Sherlock to correct this mistake. “Yes, jumps.”  John sighs, “He’s going to look a certain way when that jump is over.”
Of course he does. It’s what one does in such a situation. A mime. A mimicry. An external physical representation of an internally incapacitating emotion. Or just the complete ignorance that the world continues to move on around you, expecting you to carry out your small purpose within it. Like holding crockery. Or breathing.
Sherlock shifted from one foot to the other and Moriarty snapped his head back up. He rose to his feet, tweaking at his tailored trousers and taking a single step forward toward Sherlock.
“What you’ve been doing with yourself, where you’ve been, whether or not you managed to remember to eat anything in the last three years? The usual suspects.”
John watches Sherlock’s face as he says this, that familiar set of features, something held back behind the eyes.
“You got yourself all worked up and thought the only way you could convince me would be some big emotional speech…”
The dark head of hair and narrow shoulders of the man sitting in the row ahead of John obscures most of his view. He’s always had the worst luck with seats.
“Well yeah,” The boyfriend sighed. “It wasn’t at first, at first it was pretty ideal. No commitment, all the benefits. But then, I don’t know, I kinda wanted more… You know?”
For a moment John is taken aback. He finds himself assessing the person in front of him. Whippet-thin and long limbed, clad in probably one of the more expensive suits John has had the opportunity to sit beside and swaddled in an equally expensive looking long coat and blue scarf. His hair is a mess of dark curls, framing a pale angular face.
They did not talk about those weeks he’d lain in a hospital bed in her care and the reasons for him being there.
“Well now, I told you it wasn’t far,” She continues, “This is me, just up ahead.” They’ve turned onto Baker Street and a line of straight-backed terraces rises up beside them. She stops at 221: a plain looking door beside a café.
“Does it have to be someone else?” She followed up thoughtfully, “I mean, am I explaining 2010 to someone else? Or could it be to myself?”
“That’s what you’ve told the papers.” The man says in response, “But we both know that’s not the truth.”
Really, if he thinks about it, he has no idea what time they finally made it up to this room. Rousing themselves from the sofa in a jumble of limbs and attempting the long stumble upstairs; full of words and kisses and yawns.
“Perhaps longer,” Sherlock qualifies, taking his time over the words, “Twenty years, thirty. It has always been something I considered for our future.” Sherlock’s eyes have become grave; he sits forward a little to shorten the space between them. “Before you I had thought that all I could ever live for was the work. What it made me and what I became when I was doing it. You changed that. You taught me what it was to be more than that.”
Sherlock has stilled, completely. No more pacing. Instead he’s found the arm of the sofa. Perched there.
She took a seat beside him, spreading her hands very carefully on the surface of the table in front of her before she spoke.
Then someone pushed through the door beside them, the noise of the party heightening for a second and bringing them out of it.
John stood alone in the hall for a full minute once she’d gone, not quite believing his stroke of luck.
He took a moment to carefully press his lips together, recognising the import of the moment. Then continued:
“The answer to your ridiculously worded question: Yes. Yes I know the likely effects of a pavement on a body thrown at it from a distance of approximately thirty feet.”
He lies still for a moment, listening to the noises of Baker Street below him: the traffic washing by, footsteps, the floating sound of voices stirring up from the café below. He smiles. The world is still going on untouched outside. People are still laughing and drinking and talking and working. Despite the fact that Sherlock fell, and that he returned.
But they had spoken. All those words. That voice saying more than just John’s name, saying all the things they never had.
“Don’t give up on them.” Mrs Hudson said plainly, reaching over and giving the back of his hand a pat where it rested on the table.
The whole thing was ridiculous. The last note had found him tumbling down a hole of google searches, the answers he’d found making him look around his small room with new eyes.
“Told you you’d get a tan, didn’t I Johnny?” One of John’s companions said, Sherlock caught only the faintest sound of it over the din of the other party goers.
“Well, when you decide you want to talk to me I’ll be out there.” John moves away, unconcerned. “Got some pages from my publisher to go over,” He continues, “Apparently they’re not ‘emotive’ enough. Her word. Can you believe that? Sometimes I think you’re rubbing off on me…”
John retreats. Back to his tea on the countertop. Back to the broken shards of a mug across the floor. He realises that Sherlock didn’t mention this. As if shouts and breakages and thoughts of Mrs Hudson are always linked.
“You’re avoiding the question,” Sherlock says once the toneless female voice has finished warning passengers to mind the gap between the train and the platform.
“Do you know where you are?” He asks softly and John finally has chance to consider his surroundings: the same hospital room, no light through the distant window this time, just the sterile tungsten glow of the overhead bulb.
There were a few seconds of silence as Mike looked between Sherlock, practically a stranger, and John, motionless on the bed.
“So ‘M’…?” Lestrade tried a different approach, looking down at the card now sitting on the desk in front of him, finally wrapped in a clear evidence bag. “Could be a company? A brand name? Looks like a business card…”
As they approached the body on the shore the officers around it stepped back to let them through. Sherlock crouched to get a closer look. There was a pause as he took in the details, his eyes were the only thing that moved.
“Yes, it’s here somewhere.” John casts around, before noticing the way the patient is holding himself. “Are you cold?”
“This is a doctor’s surgery, not a place for an interview.” John doesn’t back down, this man may be six inches taller but John has the authority here.
Inside, the house was crowded. They were led through into a large back room, which served as both dining room and kitchen, though the furniture had been pushed back to allow more room for standing. Once drinks had been offered Lestrade and Molly fell immediately into easy conversation with Mike and an attractive, age compatible woman that Sherlock assumed must be his wife. Sherlock took the opportunity to slip away.
But the position John has pulled them into can’t be comfortable for Sherlock. He shifts beneath John’s touch, that marble moving, limbs finding a more natural position on the floor.
And now it was all over. It never had been going to last forever. His mysterious absent host was returning, and his services were no longer required.
Sherlock closed his eyes at the words, focussing on the inside of his eyelids as he pressed his hands hard against his trouser pockets. Gathering his thoughts.
Sherlock peered at the displayed information through the gathering evening gloom and stilled in the silence to wait for an answer. He got one in the form of a noise: a growl of his stomach.
Ignoring him, Sherlock held up his find, the single ornate letter on the front of the card glinting as he tilted it toward the light. The letter ‘M’.
Sherlock had been right, Angelo’s was still there, a shining beacon of warm light on the cold Soho street. As much as he wouldn’t admit it John’s hands were trembling when he pulled open the door the next evening.
“Have you two done arguing semantics?” Lestrade’s voice breaks in to their discussion. They both turn to look at him.
“Making friends?” Molly sidled up to him the moment he finally made it to the staff room, he looked at her in surprise, then back to the retreating figure of Mary, then back at Molly; she’d put on lipstick.
“Like last time you mean?.” John accused, “Just try and keep it clean,” He glared and they laughed, “Beers when I’m back?” He asked, turning to retrieve his pack from the bench behind him.
“Suspicions confirmed.” Lestrade said from behind him, his tone implying the crossing of arms. “Just do your thing.”
“Yeah, it’s…” He started to say ‘strange’, but realised the descriptor, however true, would only generate more questions, “It’s early.”
John looks back to him suddenly, “How about your best friend who just wants you to relax a bit for a change?!”
“Of course I have,” Mycroft corrected, “I helped support you in your previous crisis of accommodation, didn’t I?”
“It’s entirely my fault, Mrs Hudson.” He tried to level his voice, moving forward toward her and placing his hands very carefully on the outside of each of her shoulders. “I can offer you my genuine assurances that you will have the full resources of the Metropolitan police to protect you...”
“We knew each other for years, he was…” John casts around, then looks up into the stranger’s eyes. “Shorter. Less…” John gestures around his head with the hand not holding on to his cane. “…hair!” He finishes.
For a long stilling moment he contemplates the inside of his eyelids. A deep breath. Another. Perhaps when he opens his eyes the doorway will be empty again. Perhaps this is a dream. He will have fallen asleep,
There’s a long pause. One in which John gets the curious sensation of watching the scene from outside himself. Circling around them. Serving and volleying and questioning and explaining and separating and accusing. His head is singing with it.
“You’re up early,” A brisk voice behind him and Sherlock turned in surprise, a piece of toast gripped between his teeth. Mycroft was standing on the threshold.
Sherlock glared in response, something that Lestrade didn’t appreciate until he looked back up at him.
“You always use a lot of syllables when you’re worried...” She said in a thick voice, smiling faintly. He regarded her properly for a few moments, he’d not seen her for too long. The corner of his mouth ticked up.
“I believe he may have been more expansive about the nature of our relationship than is necessarily the truth.”
“Should I recognise you?” John asks once his assessment of the stranger is complete. Model, he thinks idly. Possibly actor.
“I’m not a witness.” He says dejectedly. They both turn together to look back him. “I didn’t witness anything.”
“Most?” John is aware of how strangled his voice sounds and has to close his eyes for a moment. When he opens them it’s to see Sherlock peering minutely at the background of the photograph he is holding, the frame so close to his face that his nose must be pressed against the glass.
“So,” John pauses, waiting for further information. “Whereabouts?” He asks when nothing is forthcoming.
“You really want to?” Lestrade asked, a bit surprised. Sherlock had never asked something like this of him before.
“Can you hear me?” Sherlock continues, too loud, the words are coming from somewhere else in the room.
“And I know that’s why you’re out here.” Sherlock said gently. “And not in there.” He motioned back to the party without breaking eye contact.
“The un-mistakable sound of a child’s foot connecting with the shin of a medical professional,” The man smiles,
“So the brother then.” Lestrade summarises, writing something in a small notebook he’s produced from his pocket. “Can you tell us his name?” He asks John.
Although it would once have been a rather stately antique, its beauty had faded with time; the dark mahogany paling and smoothed with years of use. Trivially, it now served as a place where post accumulated; the small pigeonholes set into the back holding not the ornate correspondence of yesteryear, but takeaway menus, leaflets for house clearance services and letters addressed to tenants long since forgotten.
Finally, with calm steps, they reached the turn in the stairs and came fully into view. John stared upwards from the hallway in mute incomprehension.
“You could have just picked up the phone.” John says, a slight slant of a smile as he recalls the time he had said that to Sherlock before.
“You must be doing something right,” She smiled, standing to collect the plates and carry them over to the sink. “Though I must say,” She said back over her shoulder, “I’m not sure how you’ve found time to meet someone around all those hours you’re working.”
“I’d just finished my shift.” John says to him slowly, placating. “The nurse.” He stops again. “The nurse told me there was a jumper on the roof.”
“We should go to bed.” John suggests, the thought of stretching this beautiful figure out in a more comfortable location suddenly appealing to him.
“Sher…” John started again but was overcome. He was drowning in so much emotion it felt like it was spilling over. Was he crying?
“Why are you all the way over there?” John says slowly in response, putting his beer down on the table in front of him so he can hold out his hand.
“And you don’t get on with your parents?” John attempts to apply this theory of deduction a little further.
Mrs Hudson, prevented politely from actually accompanying them from the hospital, meets them on the pavement in front as Sherlock helps John from the taxi. Much to John’s chagrin he’s having to use a cane again, leaning heavily on the other leg than before. It’s a sensation that is both alien and familiar in equal measure.
A pause. This time filled with knowledge. John continues this contemplation of the floor, head hanging between his hands. When the weight of the words they’re not saying gets too much he pushes himself back with a wordless grunt, turning without meeting Sherlock’s eyes to sit on the floor in front of the bench. As close as he dares.
Water on teabag. The mug on the left. Stir. The teaspoon is basically clean, retrieved from the drawer, a shadow of hard London water not rubbed completely from the bowl.
“Yes.” Sherlock swallows, “I tried. I wanted to get to you but there wasn’t enough time. I was miles away, tracking him. By the time I realised Moran’s intentions it was too late. You wouldn’t answer your phone.”
Sherlock turned to glare at him briefly, confirming that yes, his arms were crossed. Then he turned back to the body.
Three separate men come forward to seize John and he offers no resistance as they grab at their different parts of him, the futility of putting up a fight against this abundance of force immediately obvious. His wrists are manhandled down behind his back and handcuffed firmly in place, instructions still being shouted at him as he’s pushed forward, toward the door.
“Yes, this way is easier. If I were my own boss it would mean more responsibility, more time. This way I can just, call in sick or something when you need me on a case.”
A distant rattle and warm surge of air denotes the imminent arrival of the next train. John lumbers forward with his cane. To the edge. Finds himself eyeing the track experimentally.
“Tell me you’re with the police or something,” John says hopefully, looking up and finding the stranger’s gaze fixed firmly on the world outside the window.
“But it didn’t matter either way.” Sherlock takes three seconds to rescind it. John blinks in surprise. “If I’d told you. All this. It would still have had to happen.”
The cab took an age to take Sherlock from his brother’s Westminster flat to zone three. He spent the entire journey drumming his fingers hard onto his leg, staring out vacantly at the buildings passing his window while his mind worked furiously behind his eyes.
“Yes,” He stopped. “A lot better. Just recently, I think,” He paused, unsure if he wanted to continue, “I think, well…” He started again, stopped, then: “I’ve met someone.”
“Not this time.” Sherlock had stopped still and was standing in the centre of the room, watching him. Each time Sherlock looked at him at was as if he was looking for the first time, drinking in the sight.
“Oh god, thank you,” He stopped, laughing, once they were in the corridor. She offered him a bright smile in response.
“What was his name?” John asked, very quietly. Molly looked back up at him, holding his gaze as she spoke, her mouth forming the words very carefully.
“Yep,” Said Sherlock, popping the ‘p’ and whirling around frantically ahead of John to tidy the objects left in various places around him. “Some time ago now,”
“Yes,” He finds himself saying however. Covering for his total lack of understanding with a polite lie, even if the tone he delivers it in is one of complete disbelief. He takes the offered hand. “Hello, hi,”
Over the passing months it had begun to fill up with words of his own, each sheet added beside the last, but now: gone.
Sherlock stepped through the door with not a small sense of foreboding and found himself lingering on the threshold, uncertain. Up until this point he’d known only that he had to come, not what would happen once he was here.
“You told me to open my eyes.” John is talking at him. “You told me to come back. I can’t remember you but I remember that. I don’t know you. You were there. You were at Angelo’s. My date. She introduced us…” John’s eyes widen. He rounds back at the doctor. “That was you. It was you.” He’s looking desperately between them now.
“Knowing that you were out there, it gave me faith, in people, probably for the first time. I let them in. I made… friends.” He got stuck a little on the word.
Then a tinny rendition of “Stayin’ Alive” by the Bee Gees starts playing from the other side of the room.
“Mrs Hudson!” He called again, as the police officers caught up to him and started flicking glances at each other behind his back that they thought he couldn’t see.
“Is he…?” She starts to Sherlock ineloquently then seems to realise John can hear her, turning back to him instead “Are you…?”
He nodded once, with more outward assurance than he felt, suddenly aware of the people around them, staring at him.
Sherlock blinked at it, aware that there was something about what she had said that was pulling at his subconscious.
Mike shot him a meaningful look, holding his gaze for longer than was strictly necessary, then retreated.
“Which means, Dr Watson.” The man says languidly, reaching into the pocket of his oversized coat, “That I think it’s about time that we left.”
There was indeed a note waiting for him as he took his leave from Mrs Hudson, he picked it up on the way out the door and for the very first time made it all the way back to his flat before he opened it.
“Sometimes,” She replied as she stopped them in front of a door about halfway down the corridor, “But generally he’s under pretty heavy sedation. It helps with the healing process,”
As it rolls to a halt around them they stand at last. John realises as he follows Sherlock from the carriage that this is the first time he has seen the other man on his feet; somehow his height doesn’t surprise him.
Lestrade stared at him, blinked, decided it wasn’t worth it and continued. “You think this M is a person?
“And I’ll see you there Dr Watson?” The nurse, who was still standing with them, asked with a smile,
“I hear you got a flat?” Lestrade asked, when the silence got the better of him. “And apparently I’m the last one to know?”
John can’t help grinning like a big kid as he wanders aimlessly amongst it all, watching the punters at the stalls, the kids eating doughnuts, a couple strolling toward him: a pretty brunette and her boyfriend, holding hands.
“Afraid of M. I would be, if I were him. Someone like that. They know their stuff. And they’ve killed before,”
“Go home,” Lestrade told him. Sherlock looked back at him, mouth agape. “Go home, you’re too close to this, though god knows why.” Lestrade continued. “I’ll speak to her. And I’ll call you when I know something.”
Now in the soft light of the restaurant John can’t help but feel pretty smug. She’s pretty. Not the kind of pretty that could cause traffic accidents, but definitely the kind that can create a warm flush of joy in the pit of John’s stomach. She’s in her early thirties, her face soft and delicate, blond hair pulled back and tied in a loose knot behind her head. She’s dressed simply but flatteringly in a well cut dress in a deep purple, the colour setting off her green eyes in a way that threatens to make a pretty girl beautiful.
“Can you make it up to them?” She asked and Sherlock’s eyes lifted from the plate of baked goods to look at her properly. She knew very well that the question sounded much more like one you’d ask of a lover’s quarrel than of a colleague. She also knew enough to keep it gender neutral. Sometimes, he decided, he didn’t give her enough credit.
“Bingo,” Moriarty confirmed in a stage whisper, using the purse of his lips to take a sip from his drink. His eyes were wide.
Still studying their surroundings John is vaguely aware that Mike is searching through his pockets, he produces only a notebook: “Sorry,” He says, “Other coat.”
“Sherlock Holmes, friend of Dr Hooper.” He almost held out a hand, then at the last moment decided against it. “And Dr Stamford.” He added, to help matters.
John turned quickly, feeling caught out and guiltier than he would have admitted, she took this all in with a glance.
“How do you know Mike?” John asked instead after a few seconds of silence, as if he’d realised he was part of a conversation and might as well settle into it.
“It’s not doctor ‘business’.” He cuts in, Sherlock may be succeeding in tugging at his good mood. “We’ve been through this before. I am a doctor.”
“It’s an age-old story:” Lestrade continued, sliding a copy of a written statement across the desk, “TV personality, dropped by her publicist, losing her public image, in a bad place with the secret boyfriend. Just add a few paps with some rather unflattering pictures, a spot of blackmail and…”
“Fill this out for me please and wait over there,” She said neutrally, nodding at the huddle of plastic chairs behind him. Her tone was such that he’d half put out a hand to take the proffered clipboard before he caught himself.
“What do you mean?” John’s words are slow. He’s running through options in his mind and beginning to put together the pieces. Fear blooms faintly in the pit of his stomach, laced with something else; that bitter grip of adrenaline. He wets his lips.
“But that doesn’t mean anything?” John says as a question, rising to his feet again, “Does it?” He’s grown tired of having the conversation conducted over his head.
But now he had proof; he’d not told Sherlock what it was that he had left behind on that platform all those years ago. He’d told him nothing of the battered old book and how much the stories inside had kept his spirits up, kept him sane, as he’d passed that strange time between deployments.
“Me either,” Sherlock agreed, with a pleasant shrug, as if he were quite happy with the idea of not knowing things.
Come to think of it, it is a little strange that he’s not heard anything from him up to now. No elaborate morning wakeup call in the form of breaking glass in the kitchen or a request for tea when the kettle was switched on. Or even his coat and strange scarf across the sofa where John can remember him leaving them last night.
A pause. Lestrade looked at Sherlock, waiting for the next question, but when none was forthcoming he jumped in instead:
“Sherlock?” It had taken Lestrade a few seconds to realise that Sherlock was no longer walking beside him. He’d had to turn back to call out to him.
They sit in silence, two figures neither alone nor together, as far apart as is possible while still seated at the same surface.
“John!” Mrs Hudson had thrown open the door almost the moment that he had rung the bell, the question on her face turning quickly to delight as she recognised her caller. “How wonderful to see you!” She beamed her beam of a smile. “You must come in! Come on in and tell me all about that new job of yours. Let me put the kettle on.”
John was sitting, head in his hands on the second step in the hallway of 221 Baker Street. His stomach was in knots, his mind falling over itself to run through every possible scenario where he was too late, where it had all been in vain, where everything that had happened to him, to them, had been for nothing.
“You’re still in your scrubs,” Sherlock said very quietly, they were so close there was no need to speak any louder.
“Thank you,” Lestrade replied automatically, his eyes moving between the pair. He was as unwilling as Sherlock to leave the scene playing out between them, but seemingly had no choice. He turned the way he’d been directed, collecting Sherlock and shooting him a glance.
Sherlock continued to descend the stairs, the expression on his face visible now: calm and resolute, his eyes bright, the curl of a smile on the corner of his mouth.
It was only as he was crossing back across the room to his chair, his tea in one hand and some triumphantly located biscuits in the other, that he realised what he’d done that morning when he’d finally left 221.
“It’s for me, but it’s not all about me…” Sherlock said, half to himself, his eyes flicking around at each item in turn.
“You’re glad to be home?” Sherlock asked when the silence stretched longer than even he was comfortable with.
“I’m sorry?” Sherlock asked in confusion, ahead of him John was sitting on the edge of the decking, looking out at the garden. He’d not turned as Sherlock approached.
“It wasn’t my body John” Sherlock looks up at him, continues as if he hasn’t spoken. “It was a dummy, a decoy, the likely effect to your witnessesed cause.”
Sherlock’s voice.  He didn’t stand forever, perched himself instead on the sofa. The sofa. John’s eyes are open again, roaming the cushions in the ridiculous hope of any tell-tale sign that the world’s only consulting detective had sat upon it.
“I was kidding Sherlock. No, it’s not what best friends generally do. I apologise. I shouldn’t have.”
He dropped his sandwich and, clutching at his cane, rushed forward as quickly as his damned leg would allow. On leaving the little garden, he was immediately surrounded by a crowd of people, all of them staring upward.
“No closer to being unpacked then Sherlock?” Mrs Hudson’s voice from the doorway made him look up some time later, while he was poking haphazardly through the contents of yet another box.
“What you’re saying?” John clarifies, that dreadful knowledge pooling acidly in the bottom of his stomach. “It’s not happening.” This time it’s not a question.
“You’re awake,” It’s a deep voice in the doorway that breaks the silence. John looks up to watch Sherlock saunter in. Face calmer, a different shirt.
“Really John, if they insist upon you using it there must be a reason.” Sherlock’s voice is infuriatingly calm.
“Excuse me,” A deep voice above him cuts into his thoughts and John looks up, lost for a moment in a smooth face and equally startling eyes. “Can you direct me to the morgue?” The man asks.
“Bart’s?” Sherlock had been losing interest in the conversation but suddenly perked up. “Do I know them? The colleague?”
“Good afternoon Mr…?” John starts, shuffling his work aside and looking down at the appointment schedule on his desk to find a name. Then he looks again, there’s nothing written on his 6pm.
“I thought you were asking a nurse?” Sherlock says after a moment, referring to the blanket, offering no thanks.
Sherlock continues to watch him with concern, eyes cool and steady before his gaze shifts quickly to something just out of John’s line of sight. John becomes aware of movement around them. Of voices and action.
There was no letter waiting for Sherlock when he returned home. He found pen and paper and wrote anyway.
There was a letter waiting for him. Collecting it he decided to make the most of the sunny morning and take it with him to the park. He found a vacant bench close to the water before he unfolded the page.
And she laughs cheerily as if it were all just some silly prank. John can only smile in the face of her positivity.
“They don’t really encourage personal visits,” John doesn’t qualify that they don’t encourage personal visits from Sherlock, not since the time he took it upon himself to diagnose the waiting room while John was busy with a patient.
“Mike of course, and oh, a friend of yours,” She spoke as if she couldn’t quite put a finger on the memory, “Someone Mike knew too…”.
“Though one disadvantage is that I’m no longer sure whether we can refer to it as a bedroom, whether mine, downstairs or otherwise.”
John had quite deliberately not asked about it, he didn’t want that last connection to that brief old life of his severed completely. But she was more observant than he often gave her credit for, and she must have noticed how his eyes cut up the stairs as he approached them.
“Consulting detective.” It is Sherlock’s voice that corrects him. John whirls around in time to see him walk back in through John’s front door as if he were the one who owned it.
Another silence. John curses himself for ruining what was remarkably becoming an interesting conversation. He turns his attention away again to the view outside the window. Greyer now than it had been in London and stretched out thinly across miles of flat fields extending in every direction.
“Doctor Price.” Sherlock supplies, John savours the name for a second. “You remember her?” Sherlock asks.
“It’s not quite that simple,” Lestrade’s intervention this time seems to be on the part of Sherlock rather than John.
“Yes, warned me.” She crossed her arms, clearly she was trying to look more intimidating than her stature allowed, “You’re bored?”
The moment John realised it, he also realised the reason that this impossible thing had happened to him. He had always been meant to save that man on the pavement. Not by conventional means, not as a doctor, but as a person.
“Tomorrow’s your day off?” She asked and he nodded slowly, once, “Perhaps it’s a good time to… If there is someone? To go see them?” She caught his eye, “For me. I’d like to know that you’ll do that. That you’ll go.”
Finally, the last button free, Sherlock opens the shirt and pushes it from his back. The rolling motion of his shoulder blades like watching invisible wings unfurling behind him. The white column of his chest burns in the half light. John looks up at him. The world slowing. Contracting down to one man. A beautiful creature full of contradictions and complications. And John had met him in a bar. How mundane.
He’s desperate and he’s gripping, stilling the words on Sherlock’s lips. Clutching at that coat and those cheekbones and this collar. Pulling Sherlock’s face close to his: a silent desperate portrayal of everything he feels and thinks and thought he knew and wished he didn’t and wonders if he must.
Sherlock scanned his mind palace quickly, recalling vaguely a phone call a few weeks previous. He’d been preoccupied, with the case.
The man sat calmly in Mycroft’s favourite leather wing-backed chair by the fireplace, his legs crossed at the knee. His figure was slight and his suit non-descript, but his eyes shone bright with intelligence.
He looks pale; paler than John last saw him, the shadows beneath curve of his cheekbones are more pronounced and there are lines around those extraordinary eyes. John is captivated by them. With effort he pulls his left arm across his body and presses his palm against that cheek, thumb lying along the sharp peak of the cheekbone and brushing up to trace against the underside of the creases.
Despite the crowd the man seems to have found a stool and seated himself at the end of the busy bar, an almost empty glass of a clear liquid sitting before him. John takes a moment to assess him: pale face and gunmetal eyes, a kind of ethereal beauty that seems to separate him from the throng.
Bright lights under a dark sky, the twinkle of Christmas decorations and the gentle sound of carols bathed in the sweet scent of mulled wine.
“But make them tight,” He calls, as the porters and nurses go to work to pin down the patient’s limbs. “And for god’s sake find the brother.” John turns to leave.
The coffee is brought and placed amid the stripes: a large mug and a jug of milk. The stranger seems to tut a little at this, pushing the milk away as if offended before casting around for the sugar.
“He is a terrible liar.” Sherlock said as they left the interview room. They were barely out of the suspect’s earshot and Lestrade glared at him.
“Too bad.” John took a swig from his beer, prompting Sherlock to look down at his own as if remembering he was still holding it. “I was going to bum one.” John continued.
“Yes, of course…” He started and then got stuck, aware that although her face was familiar, he had no idea of her name.
“Definitely,” The stocky one said again. “You said twelve weeks? That’ll be around my birthday, barbecue at mine?”
He sighs as he sits, not really expecting anything from the kitchen. Then, miraculously, the sound of the kettle being filled, then the button being pushed.
John doesn’t know whether he wants to tell him the rest. He’s lost in the feelings of the dream, remembers the words he’d called out in desperation as terrible realisation had dawned:
“He moved out,” She said and at the same time Sherlock’s phone pinged loudly in his pocket with an incoming text. “I did tell you…”
Evidently frustrated with what he saw there, he abruptly whirled to one side, his hands in his hair.
She blushed, rather endearingly, and Lestrade smiled to see that he’d done that to her. Before turning to Sherlock.
“I’m working, Sherlock,” She turned her gaze away from him, back to the inside of the corpse’s skull. She repeated her instruction to the assisting nurse, who finally turned to comply.
Sherlock found, therefore, that he had all the time in the world to comply with John’s written request to be at Victoria station on Friday morning. He even managed to convince himself that filling his sudden abundance of free time was the only reason he wanted to go.
“You too John,” She called after him, before pausing and adding quickly: “And tell her hello from me!”
The room is quiet now, almost unrecognisable as the one he’d walked into earlier that day. The patient’s restraints have been removed and he lies huddled on his side on the bed, the absence of his dramatic coat making him appear pale and fragile in what John recognises with surprise as a rather expensive suit.
Sherlock looks around: “A pick-pocket,” He starts, “A secret cross dresser, two, no three, serial adulterers and a man currently labouring under charges for seven separate incidents of fraud. All of which he’s guilty of, by the way.”
“He’s been dead. For three years. He did that for you. And when he thought that it had caused you harm, you should have seen how he was. There was no consoling him.”
“One second, Mr Osborne,” She cut in. Despite the unwavering smile on her face she gave him a look that meant that even his anger seemed to pause. “She’s free now Detective Inspector.” She said to Lestrade, enunciating his title firmly so Mr Osborne would hear, “You can go through, just on the right, her name is on the door.”
“John,” The figure on the table suddenly turns to look at him, voice softer, the motion of his lips matching the word.
“You did nothing at all. You got your goons to pack up all my things from the flat in Montague Street and put them into storage.”
Somewhere along the way Sherlock seemed to have gotten himself confused between John and his mysterious ‘M’, now seemingly identified as Moriarty. As if somehow solving the case would be Sherlock’s key to understanding the reason for their being able to write to each other.
“Ok Sir,” She says calmingly, forgetting his earlier instruction “But, you see,” She pauses, “Where I’m confused is that Fleet Street isn’t on the Bakerloo line?”
“What are you working on?” John asks directly instead, moving over and pressing his hand against the back of Sherlock’s neck gently. Sherlock tenses, but doesn’t respond.
“You weren’t here!” John is feeling too much again, his words are choked, breath panting. Desperation and panic and relief and fear, fear he was losing a grip on that thin fibre of reality: “No note. Your
“Molly, hi!” The man that opened the front door hadn’t changed much since the last time Sherlock had seen him, a few more pounds around the middle perhaps. “And you brought friends.” Mike continued, in a slightly less bright tone.
As he hears his name the man looks over to them languidly, causing Angelo to make a beckoning motion in his direction.
The lift ascends slowly, the tall figure in the centre of them all bouncing lightly on the balls of his feet impatiently. Finally the bell rings as the doors begin to retract.
Silence again. John has consciously stopped looking at him but it still aware of the movement of those hands before them, fingers selecting a squashed pink packet from the bowl and shaking it idly before tearing it open.
“Mike,” The figure in the room address’s John’s friend without looking up from whatever it is he is doing on the computer, “Can I borrow your phone? No signal on mine.”
“He’s watching now isn’t he?!” John’s words are heavy with anger, “He’s waiting in the bushes somewhere. To jump up out and yell: ‘
“What do you mean?” She took a bite from her sandwich before laying it back on her plate. Thankfully not resting on an examination table, but on the edge of her desk, set in a corner of the mortuary, the room around them empty.
“God, I’m sorry,” But despite being covered unexpectedly in a caffeinated beverage, John feels he should be the one to apologise.
“You scared us all.” Another smile, she takes off her glasses in a practised move. “It’s nice to see you back. I knew you’d manage it.”
“Of course, that’s what has been so off about these last two cases. It wasn’t that they were boring, it was that they were too boring! These people couldn’t have pulled off these murders! Not in a way that meant they flummoxed the professionals at Scotland Yard…”
“It wasn’t something I wanted our brand being associated with. I let her go. She wasn’t selling any papers anymore, there was no reason to keep her on.”
“Coffee. Black, two sugars please.” The man’s voice is deep and sonorous, strangely at odds with his skinny frame and pale skin. John studies him out the corner of his vision, wondering idly how strong the wind would have to be to knock this slip of a creature from his chair. A light breeze, he concludes, watching the stranger contemplate the view outside the window. Perhaps when he’s blown away that strong voice will be the only thing left.
It was over a week before John summoned the courage to go back to Baker Street. He timed it for when he knew Mrs Hudson would be home, dropping in for their usual cake and chat. It also meant he knew there would be no pressure to pick up the letter he was sure would be waiting for him.
“John’s in the army,” She offers, as if feeling she should make up for ignoring him up to now by showing him off. Or perhaps, John thinks, she feels needs to boast of his achievements in comparison to Sherlock’s.
The uncomfortable exchange of glances as four people take up positions in a tiny room, standing mutely to watch the doors as they begin to close behind them. John notices the pretty woman standing to his left and she catches him looking, flashing her bright green eyes.
It had taken him a little while to adjust his thinking, the reference in the first letter being such an obvious link between this correspondent and the case he was investigating. But John had failed every test, taken every word of Sherlock’s at face value, and even offered evidence of his own: the skull, the snow. As much as it pained him to have been wrong, once you eliminated the impossible then the only thing that remained…
They’re interrupted again, this time by the ticket inspector; a bear of a man who seems to struggle to fit himself down the aisle of the train.
“We’re trying, two new pairs of hands and the fallout from all this…” John started, but she cut him off.
“She was…?” Lestrade started to ask, but tailed off when he realised he was unsure about how to go on.
The evening passed by pleasantly. She told him about where she had grown up and her reasons for becoming a nurse. They fell easily into gossip about colleagues, stories from the hospital: that time so-and-so played a prank on whatshisname and how drunk thingamabob had been at that thing they went to. They laughed their way through his retelling of a story from med school and she discussed her reasons for favouring Thai food over Vietnamese.
Smoothly she dipped into the handbag held at her elbow and produced a small bundle of letters, holding them out to him.
Then he does something he hasn’t felt brave enough to do in a rather long time. He reaches out and covers Sherlock’s hand with his own.
“No one complains,” She pointed out and John laughed, watching her smile spread as she realised she’d amused him.
“Look, put that down would you?” John demands, stalking over to him and snatching it from his grasp. The action seems to have reawakened his anger, “What the hell do you mean ‘most’?” He rounds back on Lestrade.
Only one small group remained waiting there, halfway along the concourse beside the idling train. One figure stood out as Sherlock moved toward them, standing in the centre of the three other men, wearing army fatigues and a bashful smile.
“How are you feeling today?” John asked the patient as he arrived at his bedside, not giving him time to reply as he picked up his chart and starting leafing through it. It had been a long day.
“You’re going through my things.” Abruptly Sherlock changes the subject, looking away from John and instead surveying the room; the books, the papers, the notes. Practically obscuring Mrs Hudson’s nice wood floor.
“That I’m back!” Mrs Hudson states, that bright melodic voice. “Back already, I know! So soon!” She’s looking away from him to fuss with her bags, “It seems I just can’t keep away from the place. Baker Street! Who would have thought? What was it Sherlock said? ‘
“Perhaps we could start again?” John asks. Sherlock looks dubious, so John holds out his hand: “Hi, I’m John.”
“Ahead of you again. Only one known distributor in southern England. Guess who runs it?” Lestrade said with evident glee,
“What’s this for?” He asks, leaning back into the warmth of the embrace without turning his head to see the man behind him.
“Not at all,” Sherlock peered over the banister beside him, down towards the dim hallway beneath him, then started to make his way down the stairs,
“How long…” He asks her immediately, she’s sitting in the chair he already thinks of as Sherlock’s, bright sunlight highlighting her hair as she leans over the book open on her lap. At the sound of his voice she looks up at him, reading glasses still perched at the end of her nose, a wide smile forming.
“I think we have a few things to be going on with.” Lestrade continues, “We’ll obviously keep you informed.”
“Cab,” Sherlock corrected, but Lestrade, having started his morning insulted, was having none of it.
A thousand possibilities sprang up behind his eyes simultaneously and for once he couldn’t deduce an answer.
Sherlock carefully placed his response back into the pigeonhole marked with a single letter B before turning and curling himself back onto the second step to wait, determinedly not looking.
“The card,” Sherlock demanded, once he’d taken it all in. Lestrade handed him the evidence bag he already had in his hand; he’d known this would be the first request.
John is on his way home, cane in hand, cursing every other step as his bad leg jolts against the pathway.
“Yes. Touted himself as a general ‘fixer’. He was the one that suggested the fake death. Any publicity is good publicity and all that.”
Rounding a corner John’s attention is drawn by the skaters, lit up on their own lake of calm in the darkness: circling figures, bright colours and winter hats, skittering and flailing and gliding across the ice. He stops to watch them, resting his elbows on the barrier.
They fall back onto the sofa, Sherlock above him and around him and beneath him. Sherlock’s clever fingers on his body. His mouth at his ear.
“Yes,” John says, closing his eyes. Feeling sleep curl up around them. “Against the rest of the world.”
“So now I wonder,” John says, a slow burn of a smile, “If I wasn’t so far off the mark the first time.”
“What?!” John’s anger is still palpable, not yet drowned in the sea of his confusion “I… Nothing. She. She said I was dreaming.”
“So, you and Mary?” Molly asked, sandwich in hand, sunshine overhead, a beautiful London spring day.
“And that’s…?” She asked with the air of someone that already knows the answer but isn’t sure she wants it confirmed.
The rest of John’s shift passed in a welcome, but uncharacteristic, haze of quiet. He caught up with the paperwork he’d neglected, making up his absence to his colleagues and checking in with his patients. Through it all however the heavy weight of the letters in his pocket was like an anchor, calling him home.
“I’m not sure I’d choose 2005 John though, maybe 2008.” He started, as if he'd just plucked the year out of the air, “I was deployed then,” He added, justifying himself.
“Of course you are.” John’s words come out in rasp. “God,” John blinks three times, as if he doesn’t expect Sherlock to still be there when he’s done. “God, if you…”
He is no longer the one sitting beside a figure lying on a bed. Instead that same figure is sitting sentry above him while he is the one lying beneath the blankets.
The final step in the whole affair had been to leave the response exactly where he had received the first: tucked into the post pigeonhole of the old writing desk in the hallway of 221. Then he had retreated back to the safety, and conversely, the chaos of his flat upstairs.
The weekend rolled around again, and John realised through the haze of adjusting back to day shifts after a week on nights, that he hadn’t been to see Mrs Hudson in weeks.
The urgency in John’s limbs meant that his step down from the cab onto the pavement outside 221 Baker Street was a shaky one.
what you were doing.  You knew what you were doing when you sent me to Mrs Hudson. You knew I’d go. You knew what you were doing when you kissed me. You knew what you were doing when you asked me to watch as you threw yourself off a building in some… in some… necessity.”
“I agree,” Sherlock said, he was scanning the page in front of him, already summarised by Lestrade, “How did she find this Moriarty?”
“Oh, inconsequential.” Moriarty waved a hand, “I’m disappointed in you Sherlock, the old you wouldn’t have worried about that.”
“Why?” John repeats. “Why did I ask you to stop being dead? Which is, by the way, the first and only time you’ve actually done what I said when I asked you to ‘stop it’?”
Sherlock has made no attempt to follow him. Recognised John’s enforced time out. He still stands by the doorway, a little further into the room. Coat and cheekbones and collar. Hands in pockets. A red scarf.
“You didn’t…” Her eyes flash up to Sherlock across the room; he’s risen from his chair as she entered.
He’s disappointed to find Sherlock absent from within it. He’d expected to find him pouring over John’s laptop, or dramatically stretched out on the sofa. Already bored.
John has stopped to watch a street performer, his magic act mainly hijacked by the antics of his chosen volunteers: three boys under the age of ten, their mother standing laughing on the side-lines along with the rest of the audience.
Sherlock breaks their kiss long enough for his hands to find the hem of John’s jumper, pulling it up and over John’s head in one smooth motion. Now just in rumpled shirt John finds himself pushed back onto the sofa behind him.
“Molly then,” Lestrade acquiesced, “She’s nice. Asked if I wanted to go with her to this thing, a birthday I think. Some colleague of hers from Bart’s”
“Another shot in the dark. Good one though. Power connection: tiny little scuff marks around the edge of it. Every night he does to plug it in to charge but his hands are shaking. You never see those marks on a sober man’s phone; never see a drunk’s without them.”
“So do you do that for a living?” John falls back into polite conversation in the face of a piercing blue stare.
“You don’t need…” John started, wanting to leap in and assure him he was under no obligation to say it back, but at the same moment Sherlock spoke himself:
Mortified John can barely look at him as he takes the offered place, only looking up to offer thanks in time to watch the train doors close on the stranger’s retreating back.
The waiting may have seemed interminable to John, but it had only been minutes. To Sherlock, it would have been years. Would he? Could he, have waited?
He hasn’t spoken it out loud in what feels like a lifetime. Hasn’t needed to. It’s always there. Balanced on the tip of his proverbial tongue. To others it is always “him” or “he”. When he’s alone: “you”. When he speaks to you. When his memories speak to him and he feels he should reply.
So now John is standing alone on a roof, somehow completely at the centre of the incident without meaning to be at all. Or perhaps he had. He can’t quite remember.
“My tiny brain will call you,” Lestrade continued in the huffy silence, “If it finds anything,” He rang off.
“Tell me,” The man’s full lips ask, John is fixated on them, lost somewhere in a deep growl of baritone. “Where is Sherlock?”
and well, she was there. And she’s so good for me. What I needed. But then she was there and I never said. And, I guess, this isn’t exactly the best time, but when is? Since it’s not likely I’ll ever get a chance like this again I might as well say it now.”
“Yes.” There’s something like a pleased smile on his face. “But don’t worry, she will have forgotten.”
And he concludes this bizarrely enthusiastic speech by grasping her firmly by the shoulders and kissing her noisily on the cheek.
“Okay, shut up,” He cuts in. “The first time we met… the first time we met, you knew all about my sister, right?”
Look to the ceiling. Shouldn’t this be joyous? How often has he thought of this? He even asked for it once. Right out loud. Standing next to his gravestone, your gravestone.
Sherlock took a moment to survey it all. The room was large, the furniture sparse; just an old sofa against one wall and the desk; sitting beneath the two large windows facing out to Baker Street. He decided he approved of the wallpaper.
“What exactly are you saying?” John asks, sensing that this isn’t going to be the same as all the other times they’ve started this conversation.
Of course there wouldn’t be snow. The statistical likelihood of the London climate being mild enough for snow in March was infinitesimal. Only this morning he had considered the necessity of his heavy winter coat.
John found he was only able to stare back at them, astonished. Each was blue, neatly folded, his name carefully looped on the front of the topmost sheet. His stomach dropped suddenly through the floor.
Sherlock continued to take cases through the Met, to play his violin by the window at Baker Street. He updated his blog and started to get requests for his services directly, mainly via e-mail, most of them so easy they could be solved via e-mail too.
“Much as you did earlier, though I doubt you realised you were doing it. You observed my apparent fame in my clothes and concern at being recognised, while I read your military career in your face and your leg and your brother’s drinking habits in your mobile phone.”
“There wasn’t…” He starts, “By any chance, a woman, on the ward? One with kids?” John asks hesitantly.
“Ah, coffee,” The stranger addresses the beverage rather than the bearer, reaching out one hand behind him to return John‘s phone, “Thank you, Molly. What happened to the lipstick?”
Moriarty himself was currently sat calmly on the raised lip around the edge of the roof, deliberately not watching Sherlock’s approach and instead playing on his phone.
“You are a wounded ex-army doctor on route to visit his sick mother; you do not fit the profile of a serial axe murderer.”
John could ask what had happened, what he’s doing there. Why his ribs hurt and his head pounds and the monitor at his left elbow is tracking each leap and bump of his heart rate.
“You finished them all, dear,” Mrs Hudson didn’t look up from her magazine as he casually wandered into her living room.
“Of course I won’t be needing two bedrooms.” He answered, moving back past her, his attention caught, not by her but by the doorway behind her.
“I believe that your wife may be part of a pattern.” Sherlock replies, somehow picking up on a conversation he wasn’t present for the beginning of.
He handed it carefully to John, who studied it, confirming that it was indeed the note he’d written only minutes ago, but aged, as if it were years old. It was years old.
“Thank you for the hospitality as ever Mrs Hudson,” He said, moving to go past her, but at the last second gave in to the urge to lean down and give her a quick kiss on the cheek. He’d not done that before, and his embarrassment in realising that meant he couldn’t quite meet her eye as he continued to the door, “I’ll see myself out.” He continued brusquely, “Look after yourself,”
Two figures blink up at her from the floor. Surrounded by books and papers and notes: the debris of untold weeks of hermit living and the scattered chaos of a night locked in dissections and explanations and confusions and connections.
“Well good for you,” She replies, executing a spectacular one-eighty. “No need to tie yourself down too soon. You’re a young man.”
It takes a long time for Sherlock to pull his stare back to John’s, his eyes cold and full of steely resolve, defences raised. It takes a longer time for them to realise they have nothing to defend against and begin to soften, the surrounding skin un-tensing.
From the doorway he’d appeared to be sleeping, but as John moves forward he can see that the patient’s eyes are open. They’re striking. So pale that they make the dark circles beneath them stand out like bruises.
“Thursday.” Lestrade answered from somewhere in the back of the room, aware of Sherlock’s fondness of the dramatic,
“So how is… everything?” She obliges with concern and John is cut neatly back out of the conversation.
“And well, I guess I am, a little,” John muddles on, “Angry, I mean, deep down.” John’s eyes are back on Sherlock’s, “You died. You threw yourself off a building, in front of me. And it hasn’t exactly been easy. Without you…”
But he can’t move forward quickly enough, the air around him thick and viscous. He can only watch in horror as the familiar figure of a stranger spreads his arms wide.
“I know you like a challenge.” Lestrade started patiently, Sherlock continued to stare. “And the case was just too easy for you…” Sherlock huffed out in annoyance, dismissing Lestrade’s words with a wave of his hand and resuming pacing. Lestrade continued, “You’re clutching at straws looking for something bigger…”
“Hello again,” A female voice said behind him. He turned. A blonde woman in nurses scrubs stood behind him, arms folded, “Fancy bumping into you.”
“No,” John cuts in, “Not just that. I told you that I see it. Blood and pavement and…” John’s voice chokes off slightly.
“It,” Sherlock starts, then pauses, John wonders if he expects to be cut off again, “It hasn’t exactly been easy. Without you.” He says slowly, a mimicry of John’s previous statement, the emphasis shifted slightly in a manner that buoys John up:
“Thank you,” He rasped out with effort, when he finally held them in his hand. There must have been dozens.
Unfortunately this isn’t something that is easy to hide when you’re hooked up to a heart monitor. The conversation above him silences.
Sherlock looks back at John with a kind of open wonder that makes affection rise like a flush across John’s chest.
“I…” John started abortively, aware of his mouth moving. Sherlock stepped down the final three stairs and stood before him, eyes raking John’s face as if drinking him in.
The ghost of Sherlock, so close already, seemed to enter the room with them. A living, breathing figure: vacillating on the threshold.
While John has been distracted with clothing Sherlock has dropped his mouth to John’s neck. He’s teasing there. All tongue and teeth.  The nips make John growl slightly, giving up on undressing to press against him.
“But you go,” John insisted, “It might take me a few minutes to find what I’m looking for and I wouldn’t want to keep you…”
“Oh not like that.” She says in response, “You know how he is. He was everywhere, this bundle of energy. I’m just glad you’d got that gun out of the house, who’d have known what he would have done to my walls! There was nothing I could say to talk him down. Then again, there never was, you were the only one who could do that.”
“No one…?” Sherlock started to ask, then stopped, causing John to look back at him questioningly “…else?” Sherlock finished lamely, surprised at his own question.
Sherlock has turned to look in his direction, properly for the first time, the full force of a cold stare turned solely on him.
“This is your making.” Sherlock says confidently, ignoring the question. He’s still standing at the edge, but somehow the threat of that plunge is being forgotten.
John swallows, fear rising as the strangeness of Sherlock’s voice only confirms what he already knows.
“It didn’t need to, you idiot.” John laughs and bridges the gap between them again. The practised meeting of lips. After all this time Sherlock still tastes like something beautiful.
“It was this morning.” John answers her question, “We had breakfast, as usual, said goodbye, as usual. She went off to her job, I went off to mine.”
Mr Osborne shifted a little in his seat, glancing between Sherlock and Lestrade and opting to say nothing.
“I’m sorry,” John continues, as if reading from a script: “You’re aware that this is a doctor’s surgery?”
John stops for a beat before replying, the normality settling across his shoulders like a warm blanket.
“What?” John asks, the tone of Sherlock’s words have an air of finality to them that has upped the rate of John’s heart suddenly.
There’s one figure he’s noticed in particular. Dancing alone amid the crowd, long body lithe and pale beneath a deep purple shirt open at least two buttons too many. Though the space surrounding them is full of touching hands, of stroking and rubbing and grinding, no one seems to feel it fitting to touch this figure, encased as he is in an aura of unattainability. Even his dancing has elegance, long limbs keeping time in a manner that should be clumsy but somehow isn’t. John is entranced, finds himself staring, before realising that a pair of pale steel eyes have turned to stare back at him.
“Sherlock has been with you since you came in Dr Watson,” The doctor offers, as if you reassure. It doesn’t work,
John closes his eyes to rest his mind against the information he’s received. What is real and what isn’t. What happened and what didn’t.
As he watched she called a quick request to the nurse beside her, putting out a gloved hand. It was only when the desired instrument was not handed over that she looked up from her work, first at the nurse and then in the direction the nurse was looking: right at Sherlock.
His phone pinged in his pocket and he pulled it free, the text conversation he’d started in the cab still open on the screen. His message had been read, sent to the number provided on the card:
“Four days and I’m pretty sure he never slept. I was there when he managed to get that awful man on the phone; you should have heard him, so clever, just a few innocent questions. He knew where you were in minutes, something about the acoustics... You know how I never understand how he does it…”
John finds himself opening the door and stepping out between concrete sky and concrete floor with little idea of how he came to be there.
“Well,” He says, limping forward to his chair and settling back into it. “As you’re in there you can put the kettle on.”
“It’s the painkillers.” Sherlock says slowly, with a movement that could only really be termed as a ‘nuzzle’ if it weren’t being performed by Sherlock Holmes.
“Sorry Mrs Hudson,” The man tells her, striding past them and onto the pavement. “I’ll skip the tea. Off out”
“What are you doing out there?” Mrs Hudson’s voice called from inside her flat, followed almost immediately by her door opening.
The words come out more angrily than John intended, alcohol still flaring in his bloodstream. Sherlock blinks at him from the middle of the room, his face almost as pale as the wall behind him, backlit with a shadow of dark curls.
“Yes.” Sherlock answered simply. “Clean now.” He raised his beer bottle back to his mouth and they both looked at it. “It wasn’t booze.” Sherlock clarified,
This detail in particular seemed designed to drive Sherlock to distraction: John in his flat, touching his things, sitting on his chair, sleeping in his bed. Sherlock swallowed, staring at the details on the walls without really seeing them.
It was something Sherlock had never asked in his letters. Somehow it had always felt, well, silly. Sherlock took another drink.
In retrospect it’s strange that the sound of her steps on the floorboards is much heavier than her usual gait. Stronger. Slower. Firm. These steps are certainly not executed in heels.
“Which is it – Afghanistan or Iraq?” The stranger doesn’t raise his eyes from the screen as he returns to the original topic.
“Yes?” John asked the intruder with a small ‘What can you do?’ look at the consultant, “Is everything ok?” He followed up quickly, hoping the answer was no, even if that meant potential loss of life.
“You know I don’t mind having you to stay.” Mycroft said quietly, his tone warmer than before, “Family and all that,”
“It was his case.” She told Sherlock with a shrug, turning to leave, “We knew you wouldn’t be far behind.”
“I’m the one who almost got into a fight over ash,” Sherlock reminds him unselfishly, and John smiles at the way Sherlock can still surprise him. “I meant,” Sherlock turns, his deep voice a warm rush against the back of john’s ear. “I meant, just the two of us.”
“Baker Street,” Was all he said to the driver, who looked at him with interest in the rear-view mirror. John realised he was still wearing his scrubs, couldn’t hurt, he thought to himself. “As quickly as you can, please.”
Not a lot had changed in the two years he’d been away: the same four walls, still the shade of dull mint green that seemed ubiquitous with public buildings, the same rack of monitors, the same bed.
“I’m sorry, that was very rude of me. Can I call you John? Or would you prefer Mr Watson? You can’t still be using Captain?”
John realised on hearing it that he really had no business dwelling on the past as he was doing. Not when she was there, trying so hard to snap him out of it.
Sherlock looks away. Out the window.  Darkness has fallen. John can see it on his face. That bright London darkness, a tungsten glow across his features.
There had been no awkward “your place or mine?” conversation as they had left the bar. Sherlock had simply sauntered out onto the pavement and flagged down a passing taxi with practised efficiency, throwing an address at the cabby through the divider without discussion.
John takes a moment to contemplate this, a mental catalogue of every emotion that has flit across his subconscious in the last twelve hours.
“An interesting possibility,” Sherlock said thoughtfully, seemingly impressed that John had raised something he’d not thought of. “But probably unlikely…” He concluded.
“Because London is awful.” John answered with a not inconsiderable amount of venom. For a second Sherlock was truly surprised. “It’s busy and it’s dirty and no one cares about anyone else. Plus you can only really get medical jobs if you already know someone working there…”
“Will you be alright from here?” John asks, putting the bags down at his feet and wondering idly whether this particular fit of chivalry will result in him putting away shopping and drinking tea all afternoon in a stranger’s kitchen. There could be worse ways to spend the day, John thinks.
“You don’t remember?” She asked and sat down with a flourish, gesturing around them to the empty flowerbeds and bare trees.
This time it is Sherlock that lifts his hand to John’s face. John wonders whether he can remember a time when Sherlock has been this expressive to him; he’s stilled in the face of it, unable and unwilling to offer anything in response.
John feels sofa cushions beneath his tired limbs. He hears the noises of Baker Street below him: the traffic washing by, footsteps, the floating sound of voices. And he sees the ghost of memories, crowding into the room around him:
John peers back at the photograph, forcing himself to ignore the figure in the white dress and focusing instead upon the green. He has to bring the photograph up to his face to study it, distant as she is.
Then it had got awkward. Having run out of small talk they had sat side by side in the back of the cab, both staring mutely out their respective windows. John had been busy running every possible version of what would happen next through his head. Wondering idly when it was he’d last done this. Or if he’d ever done this. Or who this man actually was. Or whether he had really just agreed to go to the house of a stranger who had so recently admitted that he owned a gun?
John let the words hang for a moment, repeating them internally to make sure he’d heard it right. Then he decided he had and asked:
“Sherlock,” Angelo continues as he reaches them. “This,” He says for emphasis “This is the lady I’ve been telling you about!”
As he opened the door of the flat however, the noise in his mind palace was immediately silenced. He froze in the doorway.
“Yes,” A simple reply in the face of everything it means. “It makes it hard to remember what really happened,”
“Yes.” John sighs “You should clear them up.” He barely registers what he’s saying, too lost in the glow. The feel of a lithe body still stretched out beneath him: the touch and the smell and the taste.
It had become a habit. Cupboard. Mugs. Two of them. Pull them from the shelf and set them on the side, his hands steady.
“You’re sure?” Mrs Hudson said, she was standing on the landing, facing him over his assembled bags,
In the shadow of where that chair no longer rests he’s moved the coffee table, left front leg a bit dodgy from years of misuse, so he can rest his tea there. Amongst the papers and his laptop: glowing faintly against the growing shadows of the evening.
“Mr Osborne!” The receptionist’s eyes widened, her awkwardness obvious at the fact that the conversation was being overheard by Sherlock and Lestrade.
“Molly has it under control,” Sherlock informed him, marching toward the door and expecting him to follow.
Unsure whether the man had meant the MRI department or just generally, John decided that his answer would be the same either way: “Yes,” John asserted, “Absolutely.”
“Actually,” He started as she pulled the door of 221A closed behind them, hoping he was a better actor than she, “I think I left a few things behind when I moved out, would it be ok if I…” He gestured to the stairs.
“Speak to the ex.” Sherlock told him, continuing around him, “And ask him about the card this time…”
“My thoughts exactly.” Sherlock pauses, “However people seem to demand a certain level of sensationalism…”
John read the letter again as he finished his coffee. He was due to take over on the night-shift in an hour but had arrived early, his mind more on the letter than it was on his future patients.
Sherlock’s face is a blank page, bright wide eyes and smooth forehead. John can read wonder there, a contradictory mix of confusion and understanding, so open and frank that John has to supress the urge to laugh. Instead he follows his hand across that void, leaning in and gently capturing an uncomprehending mouth against his own.
“Don’t tell me,” She waved a hand at him to halt whatever he was about to say, “You’d tell past John all about this great new friend you’ve made that likes to hang out with dead people,”
“What the hell is this?” Sherlock demanded, less than an hour later when he marched through the doors of Lestrade’s office. He threw the newspaper down on the desk between them as Lestrade raised his eyes, half in surprise, half in exasperation.
The only thing that stood in the way of Sherlock attending the party was the fact that he had no idea where the staff room was. He was forced to seek help.
“And you…” He starts, but pauses. “You were ok, with that? With them, thinking that?” Not the most eloquent of questions.
“You want to talk about Sherlock?” John confirms instead, the name still catches a little in his throat.
“What are you drinking?” John asks him, taking the seat and attempting to catch the barmaid’s eye again.
“Sorry,” John says, cursing his innate Britishness that he feels he must start a sentence with an apology. As much as he is trying not to care about the question however, he has to admit that the stranger has intrigued him, “How did you know…?”
“Because if you asked me to explain 2010 to, say, 2005 Molly. I guess I’d tell her about my work,” She took a bite of her sandwich and thought as she chewed, “and London,” She added once she’d finished her mouthful, “And this new doctor that turned up one day with a mysterious limp.” She grinned at him, “But I think, mainly, I’d tell her that she was doing ok, you know? That she’d get there. Believe it or not I was pretty shy back then,”
“Coffee.” The man says without polite preamble, aiming his words at the pretty female attendant poised above them wearing a pale but enthusiastic smile. “Black, two sugars,” A pause, “Please.”
“So you live in London?” John asks as he realises they’ve not spoken in some minutes, falling back to a default position of small talk.
“Why are we going through all this again?” John asks him finally, emerging from his study of the memories he finds etched into familiar features.
And he learnt more about John. Most of the details John told him directly, but sometimes, through the words he used or the references he made, Sherlock was able to deduce them. When Sherlock told John of these deductions, he almost always confirmed them with surprise and a pleasing amount of delight. He took joy in Sherlock’s mind, more so than most he’d ever come across. But then, John did like detective stories.
This was Lestrade’s job, Sherlock had long ago decided, he was the one that handled the situations where politeness would achieve greater results than intelligence.
“There’s nothing you can do now, Sherlock. You can do anything you like with me…” He spread his arms, inviting Sherlock forward, taunting him, “But nothing is going to prevent them from pulling the trigger. Your only three friends in the world will die.”
Where, from the doorway, they had appeared empty, from this angle he could see that a single book remained. He moved forward, thankful of the silent boards beneath his feet.
“So,” John starts, glad he’s managed to raise that smile. “How exactly did my idiot receptionist manage to throw you out? Tougher souls than her have tried and failed.”
“Dr Watson,” She addresses him, still smiling. She has a pleasant, pretty kind of smile that sits nicely with her delicate face and startlingly green eyes.
He’d tried moving away. At first. Right after it happened. This place was too painful for him then. The memories suffocating: an empty chair, an un-stepped-on coffee table, the wonky yellow face with the gaps in his smile.
“Global warming,” John agreed, turning to smile at her. Much to John’s surprise they’d become tentative friends since that first day. Her gentle smile was one that never failed to lift his mood; helping to iron out the jagged edges of his bad days and soften the memories when they threatened. She was also refreshingly forthright when it came to asking to spend time with him, which it turned out he needed.
“It’s been hard.” John continues. Doesn’t expect an answer, Sherlock is in the “away” portion of his pace. “All of it. Watching you fall. Carrying on. Hearing what people said.”
Something like relief trickles back into John’s limbs. He can think of only one shock - she's going to tell him it hasn’t all been some kind of bizarre tea-fuelled dream.
“So?” Sherlock asks, his warm living weight pressed all along John’s side. They’re both looking upward, studying the grey distance of John’s ceiling.
Mr Osborne was not wearing his pink trousers today. Instead it was his shirt that was pink, currently exactly the same hue as his face.
“Dr Watson, your 6pm is here.” The bored voice of the receptionist says through the speakerphone on John’s desk. John looks up from the paperwork he’s been working on to stare back at the device, unsure of how it works in order for him to reply.
He turns his head to study more of it, finding, to his surprise, that he isn’t alone. A stranger lolls in a plastic chair at the edge of the room, seemingly asleep, his dark curls falling limply across a drawn face and long limbs positioned at odd angles as if his strings have been cut. The pose gives the impression that he had been overwhelmed by sleep without warning, simply tipping into it at an impossible angle.
“May I?” It’s a deep voice that pulls John from his thoughts. He looks up from his coffee cup uninterested, surveying a tall figure looming above him.
“I knew him.” She said again, her good mood gone, her face pale against the blue of her scarf. “The man who jumped. The one you couldn’t save. I knew him.”
John stares back at the stranger, watching him. His head swims. Why can’t he remember what Sherlock looked like?
It was over twelve hours later that Sherlock stepped from the cab onto the pavement outside his brother’s apartment.
After the excitement of the connection things had gone no further. Mr Osborne did indeed have an alibi for Sheila Lay’s time of death. He was also clueless, or a better actor than Steve Redcar, about where the calling card had come from.
Sherlock had already started his retort when the second half of the sentence derailed him,  causing him to stare back at Lestrade with his mouth hanging half open.
“Who cares about decent!?” The man exclaims, stepping firmly toward the road and flagging down the taxi that has miraculously materialised there, “The game, Mrs Hudson, is on!” He concludes dramatically, slamming the car door behind him.
John is watching him from atop the single sleeping bench. His back against the wall, knees bent up in front of him, hands hanging down between them. The featureless cell around them provides the perfect canvas to Sherlock’s dark outline, pacing back and forth before him.
John had been waiting for the question. He sighed and made a show of taking a bite of his sandwich, chewing thoughtfully.
They are all shouting: at John, at each other, barking orders, creating confusion and noise. John complies with the roared instruction to put his hands on his head, doing his best to ignore the chaos they’re creating to stare back at the figure standing calmly in the midst of it all.
John has to look up to catch the angle of her gaze before he realises that it’s not him that’s being chastised but the child. He watches as the mother stalks over to drag the child-John away, a vague recollection appearing unbidden in his mind of a tired smile and untouched milkshakes.
“No…” Sherlock started uncertainly, but was saved by the sudden appearance of Mike, who pushed his head through the opened door.
“No, I’m…” He replied, flustered, “I’m Dr Watson,” There was no recognition in her eyes. “I was told to report here?”
John had been visiting a friend. They’d been for lunch around the corner and John had offered to walk her back to the office. She’s pretty; beautiful green eyes.
John wets his lips, contemplating Sherlock from a distance; mind so full of false memories and imposing feelings that he doesn’t know where to begin. Then he realises he does:
“I wondered whether you’d be wanting to come back…” She was continuing, but he had tuned her out, pulling out his mobile and opening the text. It was Lestrade.
There was a tense pause then, broken suddenly by Sherlock’s mobile on the table between them. He snatched it up on the second ring.
Since that day he’d been too busy at the hospital to do much further research and he’d not tried too hard to find the time, mainly because, as he realised now, he’d not quite believed the claim in the first place.
“Look is this a joke?” He asks, exasperated. “Did Mike put you up to this? Some elaborate ruse to humiliate the cripple?!”
It had been a week since his last call from Lestrade, and a lot longer than that since it had been regarding anything interesting.
“We had a fight.” The man admitted. “She told me she couldn’t stand the sight of me, said she needed to get away for a bit.” The man looked nervously between Lestrade and Sherlock.
His hand moves out to the phone and, uncertain, he has to look down to press the right button to answer.
This was a date. And, unlike that farce from a month previous, this was real. His date was pretty, she was nice, she was exactly his type and, most importantly, she was here. This could work, this was going to work. This was what he needed.
“I’m not talking literally.” There’s ghost of a smile. “I’m saying the part of my mind that wanted me to come back looked like you.”
“Yes,” Sherlock replied, he was standing in the middle of the room wearing his coat, aware suddenly that he was probably staring into space. “Excellent deduction.” He continued, without malice.
“I know you’re not Stamford. You look nothing like him.” John’s run out of patience for whatever game this stranger is playing with him.
John stops, studying the man in front of him, a smile on his lips. He’s imagining the times to come, the life that stretches out ahead of them: of stillness and Sussex and summer afternoons. Days at the side of this incredible, confusing, thrilling figure of a man, the wonders that have become his life these last thirty years.
“Sorry?” John’s voice hasn’t been used in some time and he’s aware the word comes out rougher than he’d expected.
He’d rounded the corner of the ward to see the face of a soldier he’d once treated, rather than a kid who’d broken his ankle in a skateboarding accident. He’d barked an order at the nurse rather than asking for assistance. He’d ducked at the sound of a car grinding gears on his laboured walk back to his tiny flat.
“We all did,” A smile on her face. “I can’t imagine it really.” She says in a different tone, “All that time away, he tells me he was tracking people, people that wanted to do us harm.”
“While you were dead?” It’s not often that such a sentence can be spoken, never mind with the lightness that John applies to it.
Remembers lying a tangled heap on the sofa, sated. Sherlock suddenly beginning to writhe, attempting to contort his naked body half trapped beneath John and peer at the sole of his own foot.
“Let me guess,” Sherlock replied, he was still holding the most recent letter, “Vanessa Stephens.” He didn’t even frame it as a question
John’s hands are on the other man’s clothes now. Fingers tearing at a dark shirt, clinging at the smooth skin it reveals as he wrings it from his body. Sherlock is no less idle, attempting to pull the hem of John’s t-shirt over his head without breaking their bruising kiss. Their breath is short, hands roaming, cotton and denim and fingers and tongues. Of lost moments and longing and frustration and pain.
! And the café, downstairs, no message. The phone. And Mrs Hudson came home, and she said. She said… And the plates,”
But somehow that previous evening, in the gloom of gathering dusk, it had all seemed a bit less beyond the realms of possibility. As if it could be true. It was that thought that had made him search out that letter from Harry, the one sent to him from that now years-old snowstorm. He’d read it a tent in Afghanistan, feeling more than thousands of miles away from the prospect of snow, unseasonal or otherwise.
“So what is it exactly that you do?” John asks, almost accusatory, turning his full attention back to the man and discarding his phone on the table. “Other than stalk people from coffee shops?”
“Sherlock, you’re not wearing…” Lestrade started as he watched him reach forward, but it was too late. “…gloves.”  He trailed off.
It was only when he found what he was looking for, and had studied it for a few moments, that he pulled the blank piece of paper waiting at his elbow toward him, his pen poised.
“Told you…” Lestrade replied once they’d closed the door behind them. “Sticks to his guns though, no matter how hard I push he won’t admit to knowing anything about the card.”
“Look, I know…” She started finally with a sigh, but stopped, as if unable to articulate the rest. “Believe me I know.” She breathed out.
“Yes.” It’s a testament to the lethargy in John’s body that he is unable to summon enough enthusiasm to question Sherlock’s train of thought.
Slowly, gradually, John finds the strength to step sideways and ease himself back into the chair he vacated a lifetime of eleven minutes ago. In that time before. The time when Sherlock was dead.
“Ah,” John nods, reading the sentiment beneath the logic as if it were the only thing Sherlock had said.
The man hasn’t turned. John can only stand alone in the middle of a roof and talk to the man’s back, but at least that’s something.
Lucy Shields lived in a modest flat above a florist in Angel. They arrived just as officers were stringing police tape across the front door.
John snorts a little in dark amusement, leaning down to inspect the chart. A series of data. No name.
“Eighteen twenty,” A female voice behind John brings him back from the place he seems to have got lost in.
John gathers his belongings from the security scanner with casual ease, turning with a smile to take the hand of his girlfriend who is already waiting with her bags.
Sherlock steps forward slightly. Long legs fitting between John’s knees and John sits forward to him, tentatively reaching up to run the flats of his palms against a pale stomach, his rough hands commonplace against the elegance. For some reason he’d expected his skin to be cold. It’s not. It’s like fire.
He scrawled the note quickly and tore it from the book, standing to stuff it unceremoniously into the pigeonhole. Then he stared at it. Nothing happened.
“Yes,” Sherlock’s voice is cool and deep, somehow perfectly befitting the rather theatrical bearing of his features. “It’s good to meet you,” He says as Angelo presents John’s date to him.
“Your choice or his?” Again, Sherlock jumped in as she’d barely completed her final syllable. Again, she didn’t answer.
“I’m glad you called,” She said with a smile as they took a seat at a quiet table in the corner of the pub. It was different to the place he usually frequented with Mike, more upmarket, a bit further from the hospital. He tried to tell himself that he’d chosen it because he was trying to impress her, but in reality he’d knew it was because he was unlikely to run into anyone he knew.
“No problem.” Lestrade said, with a tense smile, “Give me her address and we’ll be out of your hair.”
John released the breath he was holding, his legs feeling like they’d turned to water beneath the table.
Sherlock’s mouth moves, whether testing out responses or the effect that the punch has had on his face John can’t tell, doesn’t care, continues at a shout:
As he stepped out into the blank expanse of cement on the deserted roof of St Bart’s hospital Sherlock’s sense of calm wavered at the edges. Everything was in place. But Moriarty’s unpredictability seemed to be the only predictable thing about him.
“Well anyway, yeah,” Mike recovered, “I was thinking of having another party. No barbecue this time. Just some friends, at mine. Be great if you could come. Molly’ll be there.”
Sherlock’s eyes dip away from John’s, his mouth slanting in a smile. John is glad to have raised it. He watches as Sherlock finally takes the seat by the bedside, feeling a little like the world has realigned itself in a very fundamental way.
“Is this a job interview?” John answers the question with a question of his own, softening it with a smile.
They contemplated each other in the quiet of the hallway for a few moments, their eyes locked. John didn’t know what to say.
“The name’s Sherlock Holmes,” He offers finally, his gaze level, “And the address is two two one B Baker Street.” He winks. “Afternoon,”
“Oh yes,” Sherlock said bluntly, and John’s ideas were dashed. “Of course, I can only surmise at who that person was before, that other me, the one you saw jump from that rooftop...”
The door had barely closed behind them before Sherlock had surged forward, any uncertainty dissolving, catching John’s face between large hands and pushing him back, fitting their mouths together confidently.
“I don’t know,” John starts, having difficulty finding the words he wants to say, “You seem…” John’s words peter out vaguely.
“No consequences, no,” Lestrade quipped, “He didn’t know she’d been dropped by the publicist. Or he’s a very good liar.”
Having followed Sherlock to the right place John looked up at the sign carved into the stonework above a window, marvelling at how well kept it was, tucked away in this hidden place.
At the sound of the door opening John turns to assess the figure that has just entered: a bear of a man who seems to struggle to fit himself in the doorway. The man moves forward confidently, pulling his stethoscope from around his neck:
Sherlock still stands by his bedside, suit but no coat, face still pale, eyes still blue. He’s dropped his touch from John’s hand and stands awkwardly immobile: not his normal resting state.
“Mike might have mentioned me,” She breezed, moving past him, he turned to follow, “Sorry about that,” She waved the clipboard, “This isn’t my usual job, I’m not all that used to dealing with people that are, well…”
Of course Sherlock doesn’t understand the importance of the morning after. The morning after the resurrection. The reassurances and words the touches: the confirmation that Sherlock is in fact no longer past tense, but present. That it wasn’t all some strange stirring of John’s insane imagination. It wasn’t.
“Oh,” John says in the face of more information than we was expecting. “I’m assuming you don’t mean shooting the walls literally?”
“You’re not Lestrade,” He told her in response, ignoring the question. He was at least decent; this was his second best dressing gown.
Of course he could summon those words. Spoken in a voice he’s heard in a dream he won’t admit to having.
They move together now, John’s hands coming up to the man’s waist, gripping and circling, moving their bodies together with the music. Glancing and swaying and touching. The rise and ebb of the music matched with the tide of their dancing bodies. The stranger’s hands move slowly to John; long fingers running across his bare chest, tracing collarbones as if examining them before one hooks beneath the chain of the army dog-tags that still lie around John’s neck.
“Why can’t I remember you?! You were there…” But now John’s thoughts are fading, words slowing. “I don’t remember you...” He says with effort. “…you fell.”
“Just got here.” She acknowledged with a smile, pausing to take in his face. He had no idea what she was reading there and she didn’t comment on it. “So which is it?” She asked instead.
“I thought,” John can’t quite believe his voice can be uttering these things. To a dead man. “I thought, you… I mean, I…”
But that’s hopeless. He tells himself. They would have undone any mark Sherlock had made on it later in the evening. When they had fallen there: an amorous heap of desperate touches. Sherlock’s hands on him, his mouth, his tongue. What had he touched? He had touched John.
When he returns Sherlock seems to have conjured up a second bar stool, possibly from under that voluminous coat.
“Yes,” Sherlock replies coolly, moving forward toward them. Mrs Hudson rises from the chair as he does so, as if offering him his rightful place.
“Sore.” John answers immediately, not missing the look Sherlock gives his brother over his shoulder: he may as well have said ‘I told you so’ out loud.
“Hospital.” Sherlock answers softly. He’s made no move to retreat from John’s touch. In fact his cheek feels heavier in John’s palm, as if he’s dipped toward it.
An exhalation. John’s hands over his own face now, as if to rub away the memory. The taste of Sherlock’s lips on his own. The hot embarrassment.
“Right,” Her gentle smile suggested she was quite pleased with that answer. “So is there anyone…?” She started to ask.
“You were just going to turn up on the doorstep?” There’s no doubt in John’s mind that when Sherlock says home he means Baker Street.
“Yeah.” He turned, scanning a small group of officers in the doorway. “Donovan!” He called, when he spotted the right figure in the crowd.
John walked the length of the hallway and let himself out into the street, the jolly Christmas lights strung beneath the lampposts casting red pools on the pavement as he walked.
In all the time he’d spent in this building since he’d moved out, he’d not once climbed these stairs. He’d always wondered about those rooms at the top, his thoughts inevitably straying to the way they had been: the wallpaper, the way the daylight sliced through the front windows, the feel of the cushion on his chair at the small of his back. But he’d never actually had the nerve to navigate the creaking floorboards of the stairs themselves.
In the silence that follows her departure John eyes the seventeen steps to the first floor with trepidation. However in stark relief to the first time John attempted the stairs with only one fully functioning leg Sherlock doesn’t immediately disappear up them, instead he takes the cane carefully from John’s hand and offers him his arm instead. There is a momentary catch of eyes before John moves forward to take it, the fact that he doesn’t argue the necessity of Sherlock’s assistance saying more than he could in words.
He was firmly not looking at the writing desk, desperate for it to be empty, willing the note to be gone, but unable to check in case it wouldn’t be found. It had to be found, had to be taken, to be read.
“Perhaps one day he’ll settle down,” She continues, John can’t remember if he’s actually contributed a word. “Difficult when you’re always dashing about, but you never know. If he met the right person. Someone who’ll put up with his silliness. Someone to look out for him. A nice girl is what he needs, or maybe a nice man, I suppose.” Her eyes seem to drift over to John as if remembering he is there “You wouldn’t be…?”
He looked back up at Lestrade in question, who said nothing in response, just raised his eyes to the wall behind Sherlock.
To John’s delight the dark stranger does the same, pressing forward as much as the throng will allow. They stalk each other. Finally coming close enough for John to appreciate the details of that smooth face curled down above him, dark damp curls clinging a little to the edges of his forehead, spectral eyes drawing him in. Their lips ghost so close they can taste each other’s breath.
The cab pulled up to the curb. Sherlock was up and out the moment it stopped, pausing only to hand far too much cash to the waiting cabbie and rushing through the doors into the confusing web of hospital hallways.
John was taken aback by the words but realised, quite suddenly, that they were true. The last few weeks at work had been no easier, the hours no less long. But something had shifted with him. The memories had quieted, the black hours in the middle of the night shortening, not gone completely, but manageable.
The attendant smiles at him, a pleasant, pretty kind of smile that sits nicely with her delicate face and startlingly green eyes, before pushing her trolley away from them.
“Why would I do that?” John asks. He can’t help but feel the conversation is falling down a tangent.
“Y-yes.” Her voice wavered, then she turned and led them into the morgue. Walking ahead of them she seemed to gain in confidence as she approached the silver doors in the back of the room.
They’d been strange, half-formed dreams full of danger and uncertainty; Sherlock, standing alone against unknown threats and John, unable to help him.
“So, are you going to tell me what this is about?” John asked with a laugh as he followed Molly from the building. They were both bundled up against the winter cold, clutching their sandwiches.
Today seemed to be a day for remembering. He’d been a long time pouring over the letters, finally rising and making his way back toward ITU when the words started to blur on the page.
“Not just that note. Every note. I’m a different person because I know you, John.” A careful smile, Sherlock looked as though he wanted to move forward, to touch him again.
Rescue teabag from the mug on the right. Cowering against the bottom, untouched. Still dry. Drop the bag back into the box. Lift the mug from the side and slide it back against its mates in the cupboard. Until next time.
“No,” John replies, “It wasn’t then. It was…” John gets stuck, “We were… We were older. You were talking about retiring.”
“Happy Valentine’s, John.” She was still smiling, “I figured since I’m sure you have some exciting and elaborate things planned with Mary for dinner,” She continued to chat away sweetly, “Then I’d get to take up your time at lunch…”
“I’ve given you a glimpse, Sherlock,” Moriarty started, “Just a teensy glimpse of what I’ve got going on out there in the big bad world...”
They reached the tape. Sherlock glowered at the uniformed officer behind it, who ignored him and looked to Lestrade. Lestrade nodded solemnly, and the tape was lifted.
“How can they not be linked? You kissed me. You got into bed with me. More than once. We, we…” John comes to a halt in front of his own lack of words.
It was on his friend Mike Stamford’s suggestion that John came to be here, in this draughty flat, living amongst the assorted possessions of a stranger and struggling with more stairs than his current capabilities really allowed.  It had been something to do with an acquaintance who needed someone to look after his place while he was away, though the details had been vague.
“Close” Sherlock answers cryptically. “Most of the time at least. At first, I was away. Germany. For a month or two. But that didn’t take long. I came back as soon as I was able.”
John was tanned, Sherlock thought, but no tan above the wrists. Sherlock paused mentally to analyse the thought: deduction or defence mechanism? He wasn’t sure.
“What’s ridiculous is you standing there telling me I’m being ridiculous! You’re dead! I’m being insulted by a dead man,”
Then he turned to the next: an account of the case, telling him about Vanessa Stephens. It was dated after the first but before the second and John realised that they weren’t in any kind of order. He opened each for the date and reassembled them, reading through more methodically.
At exactly the same moment there’s a noise downstairs. Key in the lock, front door swinging open. Feet on the hallway floor. Quick. Taking the steps two at a time.
Abruptly John wants to see more. Touch more. Running his fingers downward he pops the button on Sherlock’s trousers.
“Is what?” John feels like he’s clawing at the edges of sleep, lulled by the rhythmic tap of Sherlock’s shoes.
“Not a lot.” She stopped them in front of a room that looked exactly like every other that they’d passed. “Wanted to speak to him.” The officer nodded in Sherlock’s direction.
“I must say, you’re looking very well John,” Mrs Hudson said sitting back in her chair to look at him properly.
Sherlock had left his mouth open with the interruption, he closed it again with a snap. All eyes turned to the boyfriend.
John turns to look at the stranger out of the corner of his eye. Skinny, high cheekbones, height extenuated by a long coat.
“That you just came back?! Hopped up off the pavement and came back and told me all those things? After I’d imagined it? After I’d wanted it to happen? That you just let yourself back into the flat and we… And we… And then you just… went out?!” John’s voice is still a yell.
