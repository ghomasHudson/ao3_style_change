“In case it doesn't kill you before you can even take a peak”, Mary said, sitting in the front seat.
The Floral Hall, Stoney Street Borough Market.
“John!”, I heard Sherlock shouting from above, “John, is she alright?”
Mary: That noise was a text alert noise.
“You don't know what he's done”, Sherlock said after he had swallowed, “I haven't told you yet and I'm afraid I better shouldn't, but I have to, John... He will get us. And we can't escape.”
"We have to work together for this, John. We need both our best sides. We need to make a smart plan and be brave fighters."
John sensed that by the way Sherlock was speaking, it was not a topic best to talk about at that time, and resigned himself back to quietness. He made a mental note to discuss it with Sherlock after this whole thing had blown over, if it was ever going to. One thing John was certain that he wanted to do, was find out about Sherlock's past. He'd only glazed over his past drug problem before, and that was the only glimpse of Sherlock's younger years John had ever got. Was there something there that made him feel unable to reminisce? John became worried, and intrigued about his boyfriend. Mysteriousness loses it's novelty after a while, and in Sherlock's case, it had been lost for years.
"Everything. John, you're everything to me", Sherlock said, hoping he'd understand how far this word reached.
John felt the hot liquid strike his chest and he slowed down his pace, to avoid Sherlock becoming oversensitive. He still moved, to ensure Sherlock got the most of this experience, and leant down to kiss Sherlock's stomach tenderly.
I had none of that. I had to keep myself together now, think about the case. I was married to my work. Sentiment was a chemical defect found in the losing side. I would use the good feelings John gave me to motivate myself, I would keep him save, but not more than that. He was useful for me. He told me how to act when it came to social situations I didn't know until then. That was useful. He taught me how I could get to people easier.
“I need to think”, Sherlock said, “Think about all of this. I'm sorry, John, but I need a quite place.”
“Well done!”, Moriarty smiled as he slowly vanished, “See how a little pressure can help? Now don't disappoint me again, I don't want to meet you among the dead.”
They stayed there, in each other's presence and hold, until they were interrupted by the clinking sound of wine bottle on plaster, and the unmistakable clear voice that followed. "I'm sorry to break up this little "moment"," she capitalised the "moment" with air quotation marks, "But dearest mother wants to talk to you, you know, after not seeing you for, what, 8 years now? Hopefully, your little bitch here," She spat, glaring at Sherlock, " Will not misbehave." John fought the urge to enclose her neck with his hands at the derogatory term she had thrown at Sherlock. It seemed that Sherlock sensed this struggle, and tightened his grip around John's arms. John nodded stiffly to Harry, who waltzed away. "God if I was in a room alone with her..." He growled to Sherlock.
“That?”, Sherlock replied, “Nothing at all. Just trying to figure out what she was up to. You said she was interested in women once, so no need to be jealous, John.”
He loved being close to John and as he didn't think about it anymore, he just placed his hand on John's arm, holding him in a way that they were together, but he didn't capture him. He could feel John's warmth and the way his body moved when he breathed. It was wonderful.
"How do you thi-" He swallowed down the thought with a sigh, and resorted to acting as a support for Sherlock. Now was not the time to be having a domestic, not when Sherlock was obviously fragile. It was the wrong way around, shouldn't John be the one shaking, after all, it is his blood Moriarty is out for? John sighed, and stood up from his seat before walking over to Sherlock's side. He guided him up from his seat, like a parent with a wobbly toddler. Beneath his touch, he felt Sherlock shake violently, like he was having a fit. He fell into John's arms, and clamped himself around the doctor. "As for me having a life.." he chuckled sadly, "You are my life, think about it, before you, I had PTSD, a psychosomatic limp and lived by myself, with a bloody gun in my desk drawer, whether it was for protection, or for relief, I don't know. That's no life, not really. Sherlock, your my oxygen, like I'm your drug. Without oxygen, we can't live, you have the same effect. But, if the truth of the matter has you to the point of shaking, I truly am sorry, but please don't act like a robot, you are a human being, just like me. Emotions are a part of that, as well as a functioning relationship, I tell you my feelings, you tell me yours. Sherlock, don't shut me out, please don't."
Then, just as he had started to open the buttons of my shirt, there was a clapping sound. John jumped aside and turned around, I looked straight forward, and there he was again, giving slow applause.
After about half an hour, John moved his head upwards away from the warmth of Sherlock's chest. His head pounded. "I need some water..." he mumbled, moving to get up.
John: Who is it?
John's kiss helped Sherlock to relax incredibly. He enjoyed it and breathed heavily anew, and wrapped his arm around his... whatever it was that they were now, around him, and reached out for the soldier's hair again. But this time he caressed it carefully, gently. He placed the other hand on John's arm and ran his fingertips over it slowly and lovingly.
"Oh, brilliant plan! Because it worked so well the last time, didn't it?!", it came out more harshly than Sherlock had intended. But it had only been because he didn't want John to go through more than he already was.
Lestrade looked at the two of them in shock but couldn't say a word. He stood a while in thought before he entered the restroom.
He was pacing about a table, nervous, aggressive, scared. It was terrible to see him like this, and terrible to have the others see him like this, too.
Then John turned around. Sherlock didn't expect for him to wake up so soon, and already thought that he had woken him up. He wanted to say something but couldn't, John's perfection paralyzed him. His eyes were the most... fascinating. They had the most extraordinary colour, yes, there were many people whose eyes were blue, but John's were... different. They were worth observing, seeing the depth in them, the soul that they were the door to.
He was surprised at first when John started to lead his hands, but then he realized that it was good, that it was what he wanted and did as he was commanded. A silent “Yes, sir” escaped his lips.
The threat though. There was somebody out there threatening my family. I was a soldier and I would protect those I loved.
"Makes sense", Sherlock mumbled and stood next to the bed, unsure if John would want him to get in as well. He was confused. At first John had wanted to be held by him as close as possible and now he was pushing him away. Sherlock didn't know what to do.
John smiled affectionately, and rubbed his thumb against Sherlock's smooth hand.
John was just looking for the word, 'boyfriend', but in fact he received an answer that was bigger than that. It kind of ruined his strategy. Nevertheless, he soldiered on with his endeavour.
“Go away from him!“, I shouted at him.
John smirked against the skin on Sherlock's neck as he heard him moan. John hummed happily and gently placed a kiss on the deeply coloured bruise before pulling back slowly, allowing Sherlock to unbutton his shirt "We wont go much further than this Sherlock... we will take everything slowly since well... you are very very new to this" he muttered quietly, pupils largely dilated, a sign of pure love for the male in front of him. John studied him carefully and gave him a small smile, shifting in close again before kissing Along Sherlock's neck again, noting that the detective clearly liked it "And don't think I haven't noticed that you like being commanded by such a... strong soldier" he purred before moving in close to his ear "A captain... perhaps I should try on my uniform" he chuckled, kissing his cheek before reaching out with his hands, slowly undoing Sherlock's Suit Jacket and allowing it to drop down onto the floor, wanting to feel the detectives upper body, only his upper body... for now. John groaned as he slowly began to undo his shirt buttons, the sight instantly heating his member
—creatures of nature?” John grinned a little idiotically. His fingers exploring the texture difference between the fine hair on top and the supple skin on the underside as they traveled up. Sherlock shivered, the tail end of it coming out as a small noise along John’s neck.
“There’s something…beautiful about compounds.” Mahir had remarked thoughtfully at the winding down of their dinner, swirling the last remnants of wine in his glass before downing it. “Especially when it comes to human chemistry.”
The clatter of porcelain jittering against porcelain shot through John like a small electric shock.
He suddenly remembered what Mrs. Hudson said. How she and her Bridge mates would talk about them.
Couldn’t
right. 24 hours after an injury causing bruising should be tended to with on and off heat treatments. The first 24 were for cold applications to reduce swelling. The heat meanwhile helped with blood circulation to promote faster healing.
“Hallo?” Came a male voice: young, monotone, and so informal John had an abrupt fear he’d just rung someone at their home.
Sherlock shrugged, both of them—John quite unabashedly—watching as he dipped his middle finger into the small clear puddle and stirred it round. “It’s one of several stashes.” He glanced over to John, flaunting a catty smirk. “Strategically placed of course. I’d tell you the other locations but that would take all the fun out of it.”
What would it have been even, ten minutes of silence?
It wasn’t until the last week in April that John received another anonymous phone call.
Before the silence around him became too weighty, John got to straightening up. He binned the take-away containers and brought the empty beer bottles outside for recycling, finding himself moving at a relaxed pace. He felt a refreshing sense of ease about him.
As far as John was concerned it made sleeping in his bedroom a stifling and sticky nightmare even with a window open. For the better part of a week now he’d taken up residence in the sitting room, benefiting from the cross draft created by having the room’s two large windows and the one in the kitchen wide open at all times.

“Oh you know what I
At the awareness of hands jamming into his armpits, Sherlock snorted awake and made a clumsy grab for John’s biceps as he felt himself being hauled up. He scrambled for purchase; long legs buckling under him like that of a new born calf, almost taking them both down as John tried to regain his balance.
Wouldn’t that be brilliant? Wouldn’t that be the most brilliant thing of all from a person who had the stuff practically pumping through their veins?
“Huh.” Lestrade huffed, the hint of guardedness still in his voice. “Anything I remember?” He inquired, making to remove his coat.
“Well, I couldn’t let you face the horrors of London’s finest in vile knitwear alone, could I?”
“Widower.” John took another nip and set his glass aside, feeling a pleasant level of tipsiness. He’d have to lay off his sleeping meds tonight, but falling asleep on his own shouldn’t be an issue.
By the time evening rolled round he had his fill of local shops and touring.
Before an egg goes anywhere near our soup though, you want to
Ten thousand years later a new chapter! It’s a long one, so hopefully that makes up for the drought in updating.
Sherlock tisked sharply. “Then take a
“Which happened to be in Lestrade’s bedroom I take it?” John asked. Though the pieces were already falling into place. If only he could have been a fly on the wall in the room when Lucy walked in to find a defeated Philip.
“I do so enjoy watching your brain work John. Slow and steady, building up speed like a steam engine.”
” after they had yet another spectacular row it usually meant he was coming here.
This must have been what regular people were like to Sherlock. Like everyone around him was drunk.
“A thief with a foot fetish I’d imagine.” John supplied.
Rising from his chair, Sherlock left the paper in it and slung his messenger bag over his shoulder. He’d have a little over two hours to go over the intel he’d received that morning from one of Mycroft’s cronies. A list of the biggest fish in the pond of his next destination.
. He laughed gently, more of a motion then anything that John could here. Sherlock’s dark lashes drooped and the corner of his mouth curled in an almost private smile.
That following Monday, Sherlock had arrived early at the track like he typically did. He would view that day’s lineups, observe the horses as they were saddled up in the paddock and their riders as the mulled around the locker rooms all before his target appeared.

John shifted his hands behind his back, resisting the urge to bury himself in the floor as she turned her attention to the page, running her finger downwards.
John’s forehead went soft and his jaw tightened.
the space between them, conducting heat and energy like it were some palpable thing.
John nodded against her shoulder. He would try at least. He pulled away quickly with a sharp clearing of his throat, fearing anymore of this and he’d be set off again. One emotional exorcizing was enough for one day.
’ that showed up out of nowhere and freed them.
He supposed that was better.
As anticipated the phone next to him began ringing, line no. 4 lighting as he picked up the receiver.
Turning as discretely as he could, John peered over to see a young auburn-haired woman with thick-rimmed glasses standing to one side of the open entryway into Lestrade’s modest kitchen. Well,
“It’s fine, really I’m fine.” The doctor urged, taking the tutting landlady by the shoulder and attempting to usher her back towards the door. They were nearly across the threshold when Lestrade spoke up.
Sherlock calculated the odds of blowing his entire mission verses his mounting desire to have her hauled away by security. Perhaps by
“For what?!” John spat back, whatever he’d been restraining coming loose, air whistling through his flared nostrils as the words poured from him. “Didn’t intend
“Just thinking about how much fun I had tonight too. And that…I wanted to thank you for coming out with me.” He said quietly.
The detective scoffed.
It worked up until John spotted a black blob creep into his peripheral as he made his way to the clinic one morning, the weather mild for mid July, the promise of rain thick in the air. He heard the purr of the car easing to a crawl to match his stride, tires crunching against loose gravel.
Sherlock only blinked once slowly and closed his mouth, casting his eyes away from the doctor’s burning gaze to somewhere lower along his features.
“Yep. Claimed he was full of nitrogen or some tosh. I’ve got’em in the hold until I can figure out what the hell to do with him. It’s been like this all bloody day! I swear, as soon as the temperature starts raising everything goes tits up.”
Right then. If Sherlock had a narrative in his head, one where he shagged John silly on their sitting room floor in a pair of novelty reindeer horns, then by god that was going to happen!

Lowering the binoculars, Mahir gazed at him with quiet regard as the detective went on. “Insomnia, restlessness, clinging to objects of sentimental value—”
The detective hummed with a sort of agreeing revulsion. “Though I’m thankfully alone at the moment.”

It had taken a very long time and a lot of soul searching for him to be a more open man, but there were still some things he couldn’t quite verbalize yet. Maybe never would.

(As you can probably tell already I barely measure with this recipe.)
“I always thought you didn’t like eggnog.” John pondered into his stout as he took a swig.
for him—
When John peered over his shoulder, Sherlock had his eyes cast downward at some undefined spot on the rug beneath the coffee table. He had marked peacefulness about him and as if sensing John was watching him, glanced up from the corners of his eyes. As their gaze met, the corners of Sherlock’s mouth twitched faintly and John smiled lopsidedly in return.
“That’s alright, Anderson here was just leaving.” Greg replied, folding his arms across his chest and casting a hard look up at the former forensic pathologist. The last bit sounded far more like an order then an announcement.
But what about Lestrade? The Met must have been on its knees without him there to help. London was probably in ruins by now.
But to deny him access to an entire country and with it the chance to eliminate another filament in Moriarty’s web just because of his past…
phone call came three weeks later, nearly round the same time in the evening while John was still dissecting his cooling chicken lo mien and watching the colors and images flicker on the telly without really taking them in. He seemed to have two modes these days, live wire and completely shut down. Right now he was off, which out of the two, was considerably better.
The remainder of the cab ride was spent in pleasant quiet, John scooching over and wriggling lower in his seat so he could rest his head on Sherlock’s shoulder. Sherlock had tipped slightly toward him to make the angle more comfortable on his neck, unfurling his arms to rest a hand on John’s thigh. He must have missed when Sherlock plucked off his gloves because his hands were bare. The weight and warmth of Sherlock’s palm seeped in through the fabric of his trousers, the sluggish drag of fingertips along the material as they stretched outwards before relaxing, felt to John like an understated promise of things to come.
self-righteous to see it.
John bumped the man’s arm softly with his own. “That means relax, you know.”
was in response to exactly. His last statement? All his statements? Some other unsaid thing Sherlock had picked up on? It didn’t really matter, not with Sherlock’s focus going hazy and altogether lovely as he finally regarded him.
As the feeling passed, John shifted his attention back to the notepad, to his
…I mean
—had a nice tabloid feel to it.
John’s mind processed one thing immediately when he sluggishly roused from sleep: the skin of his cheek felt puffy, almost like it had grown fatter. At least, the one not squashed against his pillow did. There was also a notably dull ache in the ear of the same exposed side, growing sharper when he involuntarily flexed it. Surfacing further, he noted a distinct lack of sound in the bedroom. Specifically the soft droning of air coming out of the baseboard vent several feet away from where he lay.
He thought a lot. Couldn’t help it really. Even after two days John still felt like he was reeling. So many questions raised only to birth more questions. All without viable answers. And despite how furious he was with Sherlock, there was an emergent twang of regret at turning the detective away.
It would be nearly a thirty minute drive to the convention center tomorrow, but John honestly didn’t mind. The remoteness was a welcome change in atmosphere.
A random thought crossed John just then, almost causing the doctor to pause as he and Lestrade still ambled along, cheeks pinked from the chilly morning air.
He regarded it for a second before returning his attention back to his laptop, fingers poised to begin hen-pecking his narrative. John glanced over his notes trying to find his place when his mobile started going off again.
Any prolonged, intentional exposure were the times they—(
At that moment John became very aware just how loudly he was breathing through his nostrils. He sucked in as deeply as he could until his lungs burned, centering on releasing it slowly and silently as he held out for a response. When one wasn’t forthcoming after several seconds of terse silence, he found himself whispering Sherlock’s name into the mobile.
He clicked through the site’s photo gallery, absently admiring the rich furnishings of the main areas of the hotel and various suites, wondering why anyone who could afford to stay
John let out a gush of a laugh, bitter and simmering. “That’s always been your favorite part, hasn’t it?” The doctor lifted his head, glaring at him beyond the wall of his balled fists, fighting the urge to hit Sherlock again.
As expected, the man scoffed again, jerking his head towards the door to the bar. “Sod off short stuff, mind your own business.”
John hummed a no, swallowing as he began to talk “
“Well you thought wrong.” John replied with a taut smile and a nod, implying as much
There were scarce instances in his life thus far; little enough Sherlock only needed one hand to count them, that he would admit regret in not listening to his brother.
If John Watson was going to have baked ziti dumped on his head, it would be on his own terms now.
John had woken up several times during the night, tossing, turning, readjusting pillows and blankets. Each new position felt comfortable at first but soon soured and he would try another.
John gave a huff and checked the time, momentarily blinded as the mobile’s screen flared to life. His disappointment deepened to find it was only a little after eight o’clock. Quickly shutting off the display, he tucked the phone to his chest, the chilled plastic warming beneath his palm as he devised.
“Son of a…” Lestrade quickly rose to his feet, cupping his hands on either side of his mouth and hooted.
Sherlock pressed on with a heavy sigh, markedly choosing to ignore John’s rebuke. “There were certain
The two of them whiling away the minutes, often
Bargaining endeavored to make an appearance, a valiant effort truly, but at that point anger left no room for it. It was all consuming and John let it gnash at him until there was nothing left but overworked sinew and raw nerves.
Sherlock elected to fake his death to beat Moriarty—
Cursing under his breath, John swept round the kitchen bench and sharply flicked off the radio. The sudden lack of competing sound made the ringing all the more prevalent. All the more real.
Mrs. Hudson turned her attention to the sofa and glared, making Lestrade balk mid-sip of his beer.
It was two days later as Sherlock waited in the Charles de Gaulle airport for his plane to begin boarding that he saw the newsflash on one of the large wall-mounted televisions. The volume was too low for him to hear the anchor speaking but the headline beneath her was plenty to go by:
Upon connection, the line on the other end crackled softly.
.” He tried again, squeezing Sherlock’s hand with a gentle firmness and sweeping his thumb over it in what John hoped was a soothing manner. He wasn’t sure if anyone had become aware of them arriving or that they were still loitering by the front door, but at the moment John couldn’t give a toss. “We don’t have to stay you know. Honest. I’ll make up something to tell Greg and we’ll go.”
The thought of contacting the hotel crossed his mind but was soon ruled out. Firstly, if John’s German was bad, his French was abysmal. Secondly, there was no way they’d give him personal information about a guest just because someone “called” him, regardless of the circumstance.
John’s expression softened, jotting that down. “Well don’t beat yourself up about it too much. Happens all the time.” He remarked coyly with a little shrug.
“Really, you should have let me do this back in Durham when there was ample ti—”
Sherlock’s airy snort billowed from his nostrils. “I suppose I was suddenly filled with the spirit of
John’s arousal was escalating alarmingly fast, making him suddenly lightheaded with need. That was until he made a clumsy grab at the back of a thigh—a well-established Sherlockian erogenous zone. With a throaty grunt, Sherlock all but yanked his hips away, towing out from John’s hold. His eyes were squeezed shut, his breath coming in harsh gusts from his nostrils and John felt a jarring pang of worry he’d gone and arsed it all up.
He supposed at the very least, he could go on a date without the fear of being interrupted. An unhindered opportunity to have a nice romantic evening out. A little dinner, some wine and maybe, if things went swimmingly, something more afterwards. No calls or texts or worse—
"I'm sorry for asking...", Sherlock said and looked away as he made his deductions, "It was not my place..."
I turned around, sat up and looked at him. He had taken his hand off my shoulder where he had placed it before and returned the favor. John looked, as other people would describe it, attractive, and I wondered how the poor lighting managed that.
“John, you know you can't... I mean, it's Moriarty, he'll find us sooner or later! You have no idea what he's able to do... what he has already done.”
John was beginning to lose the feeling of being in the moment, it had passed for him, but that didn't mean he would stop, Sherlock still seemed to be in the moment. He continued to kiss Sherlock, and he ran his fingertips down Sherlock's arms
"Thank you" John mumbled.
John nodded again and swallowed.
He turned around again and wanted to go somewhere else. He didn't even care. How could he be like this? Just because I had got used to him acting like this it didn't mean I approved it. I wouldn't let him get away. Not this time.
"Wait, drugs? Where did that come from?" John asked, frowning and wiping his face, "Why did I think that?"
Now there was just one thing that he needed to know.
He was sitting in front of a table and used his laptop. He wore his dressing gown and didn't even look up when he heard me enter.
"Hey, look at me. John, Look at me. It was a dream. I'm here. I'm alive."
"I love you." He repeated into Sherlock's mouth, throwing his arms over the detective's back and tightening his grip.
"Yeah, yeah, but that was a while back, those drugs would've left my system by now..."
John slowly peeled back, panting softly as he looked up at the detective, a massive grin growing on his lips and he felt a warmth begin to flood through him "W-Wow Sherlock" he whispered, reaching out to Gently cup his cheek before pecking his lips one last time. John let out a small laugh and pulled the other male in close, holding onto him tightly. "Mine.. I dont want to stop kissing you" he chuckled softly, slowly running a hand along his back before looking into his eyes slowly "So... this will be our special place and room... I want you to sleep here tonight" he muttered, studying the detectives eyes carefully before giving him a gentle smile
"When I was shot... when Magnussen shot me while we were chasing after him... I would have died. But I fought myself back because I knew you were in danger."
“I want you to be the way that is the best for you. I mean headaches do get better from sleeping, so maybe rest is exactly what you need?“
Yes, yes, yes! Those kisses... damn! They were so good. When their lips met again Sherlock could finally show his affection in a way, too again and answered the kiss. He kissed John wilder and more passionately than ever before, feeling that this was a way to let out all the energy that filled his body now. He still breathed fast, breaths accompanied by sound. He had to get ahold of himself!
As they arrived Sherlock hadn't know where John had brought them, but as he saw the woman it was pretty clear. Her blonde hair and her whole face had such a resemblance to his doctor that there was no doubt that this was his sister Harriet. It was quite interesting to finally meet her, as she didn't randomly show up at 221B.
He was still hesitating. It was something new. Usually he couldn't wait to tell everybody what he had figured, but this time... there was no fun to it at all.
This time Sherlock did let out a slight moaning sound, John had moved stronger. Oh god yes. Please, John.
John clenched his fists as he waited for the taxi to drive up towards the cafe, able to feel the tension in the air. He couldn't believe he had almost slipped up and told Sherlock that he loved him. He could feel his chest begin to ache as he thought over what would of happened if he had said. Would Sherlock have ignored his feelings? Or did Sherlock feel the same way? John sighed, rubbing his eyes quickly as he felt the start of some tears begin to swell up. The male smiled as they finally parked up, the male glancing across to talk to Sherlock but the detective had already ran off towards the cafe. John let out a disappointed sigh, slipping out of the car himself and walking towards the cafe but he made no attempt to catch up with him. He scratched the back of his neck as he made his way inside, following Sherlock towards a table and sitting down in front of him, a weak smile on his lips "Do you want a drink Sherlock?"
The detective got up slowly behind him with a slight groan, and they walked downstairs, fully aware of the hospitality they were going to receive from Harriet.
Sherlock looked at John in surprise. He'd go this far for him? Break the law with him? It was something really special and Sherlock kind of looked forward to see John going all badass mode again. So he thought about what it was for a moment, then he gave it to John. He was up to something, but Sherlock trusted him completely.
Sherlock: Thank you John, that's pretty kind of you.
So we went upstairs, without meeting Mrs. Hudson and her irritating comments, which was conspicious enough already. She usually only needed to hear the front door opening and she knew we were here. Maybe she was busy. But with what should she be busy?
He closed his eyes and didn't even want to think about it... the thought of John's death dragged him right back to the state he had been in before. He started to tremble.
"From memories." John said, nodding in understanding.
The screaming of the kettle sliced through their moment, and signalled the start of strategising their attack, or defence, against Moriarty. John slowly poured out the boiling water into the two cups, stirred around the tea bags, and threw them next to their forgotten kin that had been sitting there since last night. He put Sherlock's on the table immediately after quickly throwing in two teaspoons of sugar.
[...]
John gave Sherlock an uneasy look before nodding his head. The kettle behind Sherlock screamed, and John silenced it by screeching out of his seat and pouring out the boiling liquid into the two cups he had placed next to the oven. The teabags that he had found weren't the best, they were Tesco's own brand, but it wasn't really the tea he needed. What he needed, was to feel normal again, and the best way to do that, was to do the most British thing he could do; drink tea. He threw the used teabags into the sink, and told himself he'd deal with it later. As he made his way back to his seat, he put down Sherlock's cup with a small thunk. He settled down into the seat, although his position was tense and rigid, and placed his hands, weaves together, in front of him.
The case. It was all new, happened during the night and his alert had woken him up. A corpse had been found in the River Thames, female, but she didn't drown as there wasn't any water in her lungs. Both her thumbs were cut off, just like her hair. But the most exciting thing was the sand. She was carrying a bag with all kinds of sand filled up in jars. Some of them were emptied, some of them contained only half of what used to be in them. This bag had lain on the ground of the river with her for at least a week. Still other murders had been commited, and at each crime scene some sand from foreign lands had been found. And although it seemed impossible, Sherlock was sure that there was a connection between the dead woman from the Thames and these other murders.
John was lifted up slightly by Sherlock's pulling of the jumper he was wearing, and he straightened up to aid him. The piece of clothing came off relatively easy, and below was a simple button-up shirt that would be easy to undo. It was at this point that John realised that he was still wearing his boxers around his waist and he shuffled underneath Sherlock to reach them in order to rid himself of them.
Sherlock was really frightened by the way John was reacting. It hurt him too to see him like that. "Yes John. I will always be there. No matter what we go through. I won't let you down. I will defeat death for you." He then thought it could be right to tell him something else. "Actually... I already have."
“Good deduction, yes. Took you a while, didn't it?”, he managed to reply. He had almost feared that he wouldn't find anything fitting to answer. Firstly because he wasn't used to flirting, secondly because John made him really really nervous. He couldn't focus or think about the important things anymore.
Sherlock paused for a second when John told him they wouldn't go much further, as he thought he had probably made a mistake, that it would have been wrong to open his shirt. But when he heard that it was for him, that it was because John was being considerate, he was really glad that he had found somebody this understanding. Somebody who loved him this dearly.
Chapter 2
Sherlock's eyes got big when he heard John say the word “bedroom”... He was very well aware of what people were doing in their... bedrooms. And he didn't have any experiences in that area, unlike John. His blood pressure raised immediately and he had no idea what to reply, or if he would even be able to reply. Sure, he had wanted this since... like forever, but now that it was real it was quite different and Sherlock started to be afraid.
Sherlock's sudden change of attitude slightly confused John, but he wasn't exactly complaining. When he straddled his legs, John felt once again the resistance of his pants against his member and he moaned ever so slightly through the open crack of his lips. What should he do with them....? He was sure that if Sherlock felt comfortable enough that he would either do it himself, or give John a sign. John liked the sensation of Sherlock's slender fingers running over his skin, he was playing him, like his violin back at Baker Street... He must miss it... Sherlock's kisses on his neck drew him from his thoughts whilst making his breathing hitched, and once again, his hairs stood on end. As he trailed his lips further down to John's chest, the shivers increased in potency, so much so that they made the world muted except for the sound of his body reacting to the brush of Sherlock's lips temporarily against his skin in his ear canal.
John frowned slightly. He was worried about Sherlock, which, in a way, was ironic, seeing as though it should be the other way around. He let out a small sigh, and looked into Sherlock's eyes, his gaze flickering from left to right. It wouldn't reveal much of his feelings, but it never hurt to try with Sherlock. But, as normal, nothing helped John figure out what his boyfriend was concerned about, although he could take a good guess and say it was him. Sherlock's eyes remained calm, but John knew better. He swallowed.
"I've been waiting for this for far too long."
"I think I can walk by myself now, my legs sure as hell don't feel as weak." John replied, moving his legs around in the footwell.
"I don't want you to get hurt", Sherlock almost whispered as he couldn't stand even the thought of John getting injured, "There is no guarantee that they won't harm you, may I be there or not..." Sherlock looked at John and felt once more how he made him weak. He had never cared about his own life, endangering it was part of the game, but John? This was different from before. With John at his side it wasn't a game anymore, this was a threat, it was war. "Although I see the point of your plan. Remember, I had one close to that before." He saw that it was the possibility that made sense the most, still it had weak spots, just like Sherlock had now, and if he could he would have eliminated them.
"What has he done?" John whispered calmly, though his mind was racing with grim and gory possibilities.
"I could, but I guess that this is the best option...", Sherlock said and looked at John intensely. He tried to convince himself that they were strong enough. Dammit, they had gone through so much already, they had escaped death, both of them, John in war and Sherlock during his past, they had survived, they were strong. They had been. But were they still? It didn't seem like it. Love really made people weak. The whole way they were talking now, taking care of their opponent. It was like they had lost their edge, they lost their bite.
"I don't want to go back to sleep." John said quietly after a while, when he began to feel the slight start of drowsiness.
He didn't understand why he suddenly stopped... it had been nice... Sherlock hat just wanted to know what exactly John had been doing, burying his face into his chest... and his hands around his waist... it had been.. surprising.
“Correct, correct, and correct, but... wrong! Oh Sherlock, people need to know who I am. I am greater than our little Jim could ever have been! And you are going to help me with that, aren't you?”
So Sherlock got up and went to John's room.
He thought he had control of it, that he had his head above the water, but it seemed that Sherlock's attempt to soothe John had finally pushed it under, but in a good way. The detective was his lighthouse, warding away any rocks lurking in the deep sea, threatening to sink him.
"Well, do you want any tea then?"
No doubt they would be leaving tomorrow, and leaving mum here with Harry. They could put her in John's old room... No, no, it's much too dangerous, and she had always been a countryside woman anyway, she wouldn't settle in any city, much less London.
"Do you want to go down and ask her?" John grumbled, fumbling his hand in thought, and frowning.
“Doubt that”, I replied now, this was strange enough, and I didn't want to play along no more, “And if you want people to know you, just show yourself. Why hiding behind this mask if you could present yourself the most extraordinary way?”
Sherlock blushed as he saw the way John looked at him and ran his hand through his hair. Nobody had ever looked at him with such eyes. He walked back to the bed and sat on it, looking down on John. "We should sleep then..."
“And is that...?”, she pointed at the detective now and he knew that she must have watched the news or at least read the newspaper. He rolled his eyes and left the explanation to John. There were  much more interesting things to be observed here. Yes, yes, they were hiding, but there surely were lots of secrets to be figured out here, and probably he could even learn more about John.
John blew out his breath.
Sherlock could tell that John was devastated, but he had no idea how to comfort him or what to say. So he just held him close.
John shuddered and gasped out as the male kissed along his neck, the doctor tilting his head to the side to allow the detective more room. "fuck Sherlock... Hitting all my sensitive spots" he hissed as Sherlock ran his fingers through his hair roughly, letting out a soft moan at the feeling. John reached out to pull the detective in closer, running his hands slowly down Sherlock's sides and pulling at his shirt to untuck it. The doctor let out a whimper of need when Sherlock suggested taking off his shirt, nodding in agreement before shifting into his touch, resting his head back against the wall and panting heavily "Oh god Sherlock" he whispered, feeling his shirt open fully and John quickly wiggled it off his shoulders, standing half naked in front of Sherlock "Teas-" John paused, breath catching in his throat when he heard the bathroom door open, a young male walking in to use the urinals
“Shall we?”, Sherlock smiled in an adventurous way and I just couldn't help but say “Yes”. The case. Moriarty. That was all that mattered now. Not dying. Keeping Sherlock safe. I checked the gun in the bag of my jacket. I would have done everything that it took for that man.
I looked out of the window again. Those words. Just words. Not interesting. The kind of writing... I was sure that I had seen it somewhere already, but that I didn't remember where made the thing extrememly conspicious. And no matter how hard I tried to concentrate, I couldn't remember. The colour, I had to focus on the colour, forget about the past. For some reason I might have deleted the handwriting. So: The colour.
I closed my eyes and took a deep breath. Now he just laid there, peacefully, as if nothing had happened. Only a bit of light came through the door, but it bathed the room in some orange atmosphere, it felt warm, although I was so cold.
"She's cold, uninterested in others but herself. She doesn't even try to hide her disapproval of the others, and I hate her. How is it any other from what I do?", Sherlock said, looking to the floor, wondering why he suddenly cared about this. It was like a weakness that he had long pushed away was returning to the surface.
"Defence isn't always procrastination, but I guess it isn't always the most effective way of winning the battle. How would we go about, trying to find him without Moriarty realising our plan?"
~John's point of view~
"To plot in silence? Hmm... You won't be getting much of that here with Harry, but you can stay. I do need to know, however, the details of this 'danger', mainly to understand what my son's gotten himself into, but also to add a little thrill to my life." She said, clutching her bedsheets and staring up at John with desperation.
"What did it feel like?"
Sherlock nodded: “I need to focus. Okay, shall we go?“
No. He needed to stay awake. Where were they going to go? He was almost certain Sherlock didn't know how to drive, and with John being unfit to drive, how were they going to get anywhere? At least, he thought Sherlock couldn't drive... Perhaps he might be wrong.
While placing those kisses, Sherlock went deeper and deeper, until he kissed around the edge of John's underwear and ran his hands over his thighs. He could continue now, he could, but from this point on he was helpless. Kissing John's upper body had been what his impulses had told him to do, it was like John had said earlier, but now there could be so many mistakes... So Sherlock let go of John, sat on his knees and looked at his lover. He enjoyed this very much. Both of them did. And Sherlock wanted more. He wanted to be as close to John as he could. He knew that both of them were wanting this. "Please, John, continue", he said, as he wanted for John to go back in charge. This was the best way to deal with it.
John frowned deeply as he watched the detective Shift and move in his sleep, the doctor tilting his head to the side in slight confusion. "Sherlock...?" He asked slowly, carefully removing his hand from underneath Sherlock's shirt. John reached up and placed his hand on the sleeping detectives cheek "Oi, Sherlock, you are having a nightmare" he frowned deeply, taking a hold of the males shoulders and lightly shaking them to wake up the detective before the nightmare got too Serious "Sherlock!" He snapped at him, deciding his Gentle approach wasn't working so he decided that being a little louder would allow him to remove Sherlock quickly from his nightmare.
Sherlock came walking through urgently, and John brightened at the sight of him.
“So I assume you two are a couple now? That's really sweet, but this bathroom is not too romantic, is it? Couldn't you wait anymore or are you unable to afford anything more romantic?”, Jim grinned with a mischievous smile on his face. He just stood there and turned around when he had heard Sherlock and John step out of their hideout. No weapons, just him in his suit, black as the night and his face pale as death.
When he went inside he saw John laying on the couch, a pillow in front of his face. What was he doing? Trying to kill himself?!
"Harry..."
While Sherlock had rushed downstairs again to examine the crime scene, I had called an ambulance for Mrs. Hudson, the police had received several calls by anxious neighbours who had heard the explosion.
“Goodnight John”, he whispered before he fell asleep, “Thank you for making me feel safe.”
On the walls of the building on the other side of the road flaunted big red letters, that dissolved in direction of the floor and seemed to be written in blood:
John found himself back in his home,, in the kitchen. It seemed that he was the only one and a thick cloak of silence hung in the air like a cloud, pendulous and heavy. It was so quiet that John could hear his blood thrumming in his veins and the slick sound of his eyelids opening and closing. What was going on? He turned around on the spot to try and get a sense of understanding. A unsettling fear swarmed in his chest. Suddenly, Harry was in front of him, in a slim red dress and a bottle of rosé in her hand. It was what she was wearing when.... when he had first left home. She narrowed her eyes. "Brother." She said, voice cold. She was there, and then she wasn't, John turned around in a state of confusion, until she re appeared behind him. "You abandoned us." She transported again to the far side of the kitchen. He found a gun to be clutched firmly in his grip, with no recollection of ever having one in his jeans. "Betrayed us." She began to speed up, only staying in one place for several seconds, faster and faster until she was a blur. Then, she stopped stone still. Only, it wasn't her. But a man. In a Westwood suit. With dead brown eyes. And a manic smile. "Johnny boy!" Moriarty sang, "I'm back!" John's breathing turned into ragged panting as he desperately tried to keep his eye on Moriarty, who shot from one place to the next with the same speed 'Harry' had. He whipped round and round, the world nothing but a blur. Something clattered behind him near the sink and he whipped around, the fear manifesting into pure, unadulterated terror. Before he could register what was happening, his finger squeezed the trigger, sending a bullet ripping through the air, and into the chest of Moriarty. But it wasn't the Irishman. Staring at him with shock, blue eyes wide and full of hurt, was Sherlock. "No..." John breathed, watching as Sherlock toppled to the ground, a crimson stain spreading across his shirt. "No no no no no!" What had he done? WHAT HAD HE DONE? John tossed away the gun and threw himself next to Sherlock, desperately trying to assess the wound, definitely through the heart. Tears welled up in his eyes as he shakily grabbed a limp wrist, searching for a pulse. Nothing. "Sherlock, Sherlock please, please!" He repeated hoarsely. There was no reply, and the eyes full of shock were now glassy, and stared up at nothing. Sobs began to rack John's body, and shake his ribs. He stared at Sherlock's body, cold and lifeless. Something was... moving? On Sherlock's chest. The plains of material were being manipulated by something underneath. The bubbling grew quicker, more chaotic. It rose from Sherlock's chest until the shirt couldn't take it anymore, and a thousand black hands burst from the seams, grabbing and clawing at John. He tried to pull away, but they pulled harder, dragging him into Sherlock's chest, or the massive hole that it now was. He didn't want to die! John didn't want to die! No! The hands were stronger than his feeble attempts to break free of their grip, and he was rapidly being dragged into the hole. He gave out one final scream as he was finally yanked into the black abyss. John awoke with a start, panting heavily and eyes darting around the room.
“All I know is it shut off sometime during the night and then never came back on. I rung the company who fixed it last time it went and they said they’ll send someone but, you know how it is this time of year.” She finished somberly.
It was then John’s brain caught up with what had been actually

. It ended up with a beautifully prepared plate of baked ziti dumped on his head (a first) and Sherlock blinking away a slapped cheek (not a first) before plucking a bit of cheesy pasta from John’s shoulder and eating it.
To his relief, Sherlock gave a husky laugh seconds later, licking over flushed lips.
Believe it or not, Sherlock Holmes was even be a little boring on occasions…though John would ever outwardly admit to that.
—oh that’s just
He bolted upright in his chair with a gust of an inhale, hands coming to the armrests as if he were about to spring out at a moment’s notice.
Sherlock might have prided himself on acting like a sociopath. On using it as a shield, or as an excuse to cut corners or because that’s what people expected of him, or any combination of reasons John had theorized over the course of their relationship. But Sherlock was still a human being. Still
He didn’t have long to wait for perhaps a half second later there was another sound. Like an inaudible voice. The words were quick and garbled but the tone was unmistakably irritated.
Truth be told he was here tonight after getting into an argument. This time with Sarah over his hours.
Just then the front door thudded closed below and up twittered a
He convinced himself it was probably best to head back anyway, considering the day he had waiting for him tomorrow. Though during his ride to the inn, John couldn’t shake the sense of alarm. It coiled slowly and uncomfortably in his gut, the crawling sensation under his skin returning with a vengeance.
With a sigh John leaned forward, bracing his elbows on the edge of the table before burying his face in his hands, trying to summon the energy to get up and make himself some tea. All this “investigating” had taken him well past lunch into the early edge of dusk and he was beginning to feel the pang of an ignored stomach.
John let the door slip through his fingers as they entered the drafty entryway, careful as it came to rest that the door didn’t dislodge the wood. The low hum of Christmas music—something poppy and synthesized—funneled down from a long, narrow flight of stairs that banked off to the right.
To begin with the pub three blocks from Baker Street was a bit of a dive.

An additional half an hour failed to produce Dufort, or Gage for that matter. It did however succeed in Sherlock appreciating why some employees went on homicidal rampages.
Instead he’d merely gave John a hum in return and turned back to his research, leaving the other man frozen in the sitting room until the doctor cleared his throat, picked up his bag, and headed up stairs. By the time John descended from his room Sherlock had just finished slipping on his coat, mentioning he was to stepping out for a bit and nodded over his shoulder to a mug of tea seeping on the kitchen table.
There were probably a dozen health code violations in any given centimeter. It was stuffy and dark and reeked of old beer. Though smoking had been banned long ago, one could still smell the scent of deeply infused cigarette smoke in the furnishings. The vinyl upholstery of John’s barstool stuck to the back of his trousers, a rather sharp crack in it poking him in the cheek whenever he moved.
There was a weary exhale followed by a dour. “I can’t say…exactly.”
Sherlock eyed the armrest a little shrewdly before gingerly taking a seat, shifting around till he found a comfortably position which consequently had his hip pressed up against John’s arm.
“Apparently conversing with
Greg stood in the sitting room of 221B later that night with a quiet bewilderment, his gaze slowly sweeping across the surroundings he’d been in countless times. It was so…
John felt his temper rise and his head beginning to throb, the lack of eating anything substantial besides toast that morning was finally taking its toll.
John processed with awe and a shocking flare of arousal. He stifled a gasp as Sherlock gave a lick at the underside of his earlobe.
Then again Mycroft had struggled keeping him afloat in the same room hadn’t he? Sherlock blinked, dispelling the thought and pressed on. “
The seconds were still ticking away.
“Not if you keep this up.”
. Still, John doubted what he had to say would have changed anything. Sherlock was a hard man to connect to most times. But at least he would have known what John thought of him. What he meant to him.
John started with Lestrade—the divorce, him being put on probation for a solid two months with NSY while his higher-ups investigated his involvement with Sherlock. Then onto Anderson’s resignation and subsequent plunge into bearded obsession.
He gave faint nod, finding it nearly impossible to reply any other way. Deep down John wanted to believe her. He wanted to so desperately it

The man with the phone scoffed, then mumbled something under his breath before knocking back a waiting shot.
“Sherlock?” John asked muzzily against the man’s clavicle where his cheek was squashed. Sherlock merely hummed back, equally drowsy sounding into his hair. “What
The doctor stopped short, easing back a step where he could just peer in through the first large pane of glass without standing entirely in front of it. There was one other man in the office besides Lestrade, who was sitting at his desk and partially blocked from view. The other man stood at the opposite side of the desk, his curled back to John, leaning over as he addressed the DI.

.” John squared himself, seeming to grow several sizes bigger out of nowhere as he got to his feet. Summoning something that made his spine feel electric, fists clenching at his sides as he tried to discharge the currents, daring the other man with his eyes to take a swing at him so John could make him eat lightning.
John was quick to relieve him. “
“I’d like a list of all incoming international calls to that number. Send them to me when you have them.”

Suddenly his thumb stopped and Mycroft’s ears perked up as his jaw tightened.
“Sometimes.” Sherlock replied vaguely, like it was a subject he preferred to dodge.
It created a strange sense of remoteness considering they were in the middle of London with their landlady only a floor below.
Sherlock let the cuff go, his eyes shifting to somewhere behind John. “He’ll accept the rearrangement of course. He’d be an idiot not to.”
Next he tucked a wireless microphone into a vase stuffed with silk flowers on the coffee table in the lounge—the likeliest place he believed the two men would choose to converse.
“I tried to talk some sense into him but the nutter went and started himself a group! The Empty Hearse—that’s what they call themselves. There’s a sodding website and everything. They’re convinced Sherlock’s roaming the globe

But a selfish part of him didn’t want to share those moments with anyone else either. They were private.
“I just had it this afternoon!” She bustled (
“High.” Lestrade replied, seeing there was no need to elaborate by John’s sudden frown. The DI sipped at his coffee and gasped from the heat, words wafting out in a thick cloud. “But I wouldn’t go making this a habit.” He added sternly then nodded towards their left.

Sherlock would have seen right through any story John had tried to string together like that. He was apparently a terrible liar according to the detective. Very obvious tells.

Ten bloody minutes. Too short to try and fall back asleep before the alarm sounded.
Sherlock sat up again; this time slipping his hand underneath the bottom cushion of the red armchair. He rummaged a moment, his expression brightening as he pulled out what appeared to be a compact bottle of lubricant.
Sarah had caught wise to his dramatically increased work ethic however. Which subsequently lead to her cutting his hours, which subsequently caused them to fight behind the closed door of her office at the end of his shift.

The only point in Sherlock’s favor was the manager was a timid man (

“I called you a machine and I
“Do they?” Sherlock asked quietly, sounding rather contemplative about it. “I imagined it’s been quite nice not having me skulking about. You can all be moronic in peace.”
“I nearly binned the microwave with it.” He chuckled, bracing the mobile between his cheek and his shoulder as he got up and poured another shot of scotch. “Had a bit more in the fridge, so wasn’t a total loss.” John added, setting the bottle down and looking the phone’s screen—Christ he’d been chatting to nothing for a little over an hour and a half now.
Frankly, after losing Sherlock, he’d been so overcome with grief and anger that the idea of bringing someone else into his life had been the farthest one from his mind. Romantically or otherwise. He’d been a husk of a person, barely managing to go through the motions. It wouldn’t have been fair to subject a person to that for the sake of trying to bring a sense of normalcy back to his life. To fill a void that quite honestly only one person could really fill…

time.”
If he were hard pressed to offer a reason why he hadn’t just lugged it up to the loft with the rest of the detective’s things when John performed his mass exorcism of the flat a year ago, he would have said he hadn’t the strength to do it. Not for a lack of physical strength, though the doctor probably would have struggled relocating it on his own, but emotional strength.
John balked a little at the question. Clearing his throat, he took a sip of his coffee to buy himself a second or two to respond. It wasn’t like they’d never spent time together outside the NSY. Usually drinks at a place near the station. It was just they hadn’t done so since…it had been awhile.
, don’t be like that…How else was I supposed to get him in the proper position and mindset?” He tutted at John’s visibly condemning look. “Anderson needed to get over his infatuation with Claudia before he’d be receptive to other prospects. I merely expedited the process.”
For a fleeting second, John assumed that he must still be dreaming as something cold and sharp tore up him. Because the man he saw restrained beneath him, grimacing as well against the sudden brightness shouldn’t be there.
Roman chuckled, apparently unfazed by the detective’s aloofness.
Sure the doctor eventually saw it for the diversion it was, but the fact remained he never should have left Sherlock alone in the first place. Not after everything that was going on.
“I s’pose I should wish you a happy New Year.” He huffed another laugh, but there was little humor to it. “Not too sure—mmm—how happy s’going to be.”
“How can you possibly know all these people’s

but lay here and fester.
It took John longer then it probably should have to construe what he was implying, but when he did, the doctor gave a laughing groan. “You’re serious?”
That wasn’t the sort of guilt one could just slog off. Sorry Ella.
“Hasn’t anyone told you how
Sherlock arched a brow, already reaching for his door’s release latch. “What? Win you forty pounds?” He said as he stepped out, bending down briefly so that his face was back in the doorway. “I could have got you more.”

In a stroke of pure brilliance and the desperation born of hunger, John had stopped him after the eighth or so rejection and inquired if he could send a text. He then proceeded to snap a photo of the shelves and sent it off to the number Sherlock was calling from.

A ten minute cab ride from the station in Durham found John dropped off at a quaint B&B on the outskirts of town and in walking distance of several shops. The inn itself was two floors with a pub and restaurant attached on the lower level with a separate entrance. John slipped through the thick wooden archway of a doorframe in front of him and glanced about.
John smoothed a hand down his side, like one would a riled animal. “You didn’t have to. We both know you wouldn’t give a toss if she was staring at yours. Or Greg’s or anyone else’s for that matter.
implied in that statement was not missed by John. Not with the look of lustful resolve Sherlock possessed as he got to his feet—which John only noticed just then were already bare. With a twist of his fingers, Sherlock popped the button above his fly. Wanting a better view, John rose up on his elbows while Sherlock eased the zipper down and in one push, shed both pants and slacks, letting them sink to pool about his ankles.
Well, he supposed he could at least try and find the source. Which meant going up into the loft.
Still, even though circumstances
Now I will mention this isn’t the restaurant style of egg drop soup you might be used to, it's much thinner for starters, but it’s pretty damn good nonetheless. And again, it’s about the only thing I can get Sherlock to eat besides tea when he’s sick and that’s good enough for me.
Sitting in his library at his home, Mycroft looked up as a folded newspaper was produced from under the arm of an assistant and handed to him. He took it with a tight smile and a short thank you, leaning back in his chair and glancing over the front page.

Sherlock hugged his knees tighter under his coat as he felt his body begin to tremble, turtling himself as deeply as he could inside.

) and a pair of dark well-worn jeans. Though despite the doctor’s relaxed appearance, even down to his sock-clad feet, John leveled Sherlock with a heavy expression. Somewhere between apprehension and disappointment.
I’ve made this about as stone simple as I could, and again if you’re anything like me, simple is good. It’s bloody fantastic when your otherwise preoccupied with a temperamental, feverish, hacking, man-lump who teeters between demanding he’s fine to complaining that his nose is both running
He drew away then, spotting the large damp splotches he’d made on Mrs. H’s shoulder, letting out a remorseful and equally embarrassed. “
And then
John’s eyes squeezed tighter. “Sherlock…”
John had half a mind to ignore it, to let that sedan follow him all the way to the tube. What the hell did Mycroft want with him? He hadn't received any unknown calls since May and they weren’t on speaking terms last time John checked and that certainly extended to stalking him in a bloody towncar. He wondered then if this was just some attempt to scare him, to test his resolve about keeping Sherlock’s status a secret. John felt his hackles rising with every step.
And how a six foot man, not counting the five or so inches of faux-fur horns, in a dress suit could elude his sight amongst two dozen people in atrocious sweaters, John hadn’t the foggiest. Though the first and last answer that came to the doctor’s mind was:
“Oh for god sakes John—” Sherlock tisked a little witheringly after a moment or two, stepping in to assist him when John was wracked with an outbreak of giggles, making any further attempts to extract himself impossible. It took a firm steady pull and a lot of squirming for the fibers to stretch enough, allowing the blasted thing to finally spring off like a rubber band.

He copied the entire list and pasted it into the ‘To:’ section, filling the ‘From:’ with Nicolas Dufort’s public address—more likely to be whitelisted from any spam filters.
John swallowed audibly, working at his mouth as the obvious answer hung in the air. “I won’t…mmm. I’m not having anyone else live here.” He cleared his throat, adding stiffly. “With me.”
There was a disillusioned sigh above him. Sherlock turned his head, addressing the ceiling as he spoke. “I’ve always found them tedious and expectant at best. Act a certain way. Speak a certain way.
There's a few triggering things in here, mostly mentions of drug use and overdosing. We'll chat later but I wanted to give you guys a heads up in case that bothers anyone.

He turned his face to the right a little more, seeing the bruising spread along his chin before fading into a still puffy cheek. Thankfully most of the worst swelling had gone down, though even as he cooled from the shower, the skin on the left side of his face radiated heat. He was way overdue for some ice. But, better late than never.
Grunting against the detective’s near dead weight, John wrapped an arm around his waist and ducked under Sherlock’s arm, baring it on his shoulders as he manhandled him towards the bed. “
“Up to.” Sherlock finished vaguely, peering back up at John through dark lashes. He had a sudden reluctance about him, seeming to want to say more. But much to John’s growing frustration he turned his gaze away again, regarding the room beyond the bed.
John argued.
Roman considered him for a moment, something thoughtful passing over him that made Sherlock pause. It was gone a second later behind a broad grin as he reached forward and took the two items. “Thank you uh…

He looked over the carefully separated groupings Sherlock had made consisting of potato crisps, several baby carrots, thin slices of celery, a glob of some sort of oniony smelling dip, and what looked like four tiny spinach quiches. One of which Sherlock immediately plucked off the plate and popped into his mouth whole.

One of the lifts off to the far right
Mary’s blue eyes widened. “Oh—no.
…” Sherlock pondered, mostly to himself.
As the other end of the line went silent, John truly regretted doing this over a sodding phone. He felt adrift not being able to see Sherlock’s face, the myriad of his expressions. Though most of them consisted of a stare, a smirk, a scowl, or something complicated with his eyebrows.
John’s sleep hadn’t improved. But that was nothing new. He was nonetheless seriously considering getting a prescription for a sleep aid. Something he could ween the dosage down from when he’d gotten more regulated.
It ran like a mantra but it had the opposite effect on him, instead of soothing, John felt his pulse thundering in his ears.
Mary shot him a mischievous little shrug, her arms tightening around her files as she walked off.

John had looked decidedly bewildered from the mug to the detective before fumbling through a thank you. Sherlock had waved it away as he looped his scarf round his neck, remarking that it was his Boxing Day gift to him. John had smiled at that, his mood lightening as they parted ways, even making a wisecrack about not getting Sherlock anything half as nice.

). “Quite. We’ve had our eye on him for some time now. Lots of rumors, mostly ties to several prominent Turkish mafias, but nothing that sticks. Every inspection of the company’s laboratory and factory has come up clean. The theory is he has a private facility stashed away somewhere in Istanbul.”
’ to crackpot theories like Sherlock was masquerading as an Elvis impersonator in Las Vegas.
He had it wrong.
He rose up on one elbow, taking in his surroundings with scratchy eyes to see it equally as empty. Quiet but for the muffled din of traffic and people passing outside, filtering in through the closed window.
Next to him, Sherlock had taken a sudden interest in those mingling, his posture stiff and on guard. He’d inched closer to John at some point, enough that they were brushing from shoulder to elbow.
He was there now, enjoying a much needed breeze as it wafted through the balmy flat, bringing with it the scent of rain-soaked pavement. There’d been a brief but hefty thunder storm an hour or so before and with it a blessed cut in the humidity. Not by much, but enough to dissuade him stripping from his boxers and the thinnest cotton t-shirt he could find. The temptation to strut around starkers however had John seriously contemplating taking the chance that Mrs. Hudson wouldn’t randomly need him at 10 o’clock at night.

“Excuse me.” He nodded, twisting on his heels and strutting towards a door off to the left, plain looking save for the small rectangular plaque stating: ‘
The man grunted, sounding just about finished with the conversation. He sighed heavily then asked John something equally unclear.
As he passed the bedside table on the way to the bath, John grabbed his phone to check if he had any notifications. But as the doctor unlocked his screen he found the internet browser was opened and navigated to the Durham train website, specifically the schedule for the Virgin East Coast line back to London. The next train appeared to be leaving at noon.
Mrs. Hudson waved it off and scrunched her nose. She took a seat on the sofa and proceeded to unwrap and re-plate the sandwiches, setting each out next to a cup of tea. When everything was in place to her liking she patted the space next to her.
Sorry this took FOREVERRRRRRRRR. S4 did an excellent job of killing my mojo and along with a few other personal goings on I just lost touch with this story. BUT...as promised, smut has arrived. And way more of it then I originally intended to boot!
.” He sat back with a frank huff, arms crossing in front of him.  “There’d be too much of a risk in Lucy asking Philip about it. Things had to progress organically. At least in appearance.”
. Thank you for calling the Maison Athénée my name is Jérôme, how can I help you?” Sherlock answered, raising his pitch by a few octaves. Not surprised in the least to hear the shrill voice on the other end.
The center table was completely clear; the counters were organized; if Lestrade were to look in said fridge, it was reasonable to assume he’d find no bits of people.
Sherlock watched as Tiryaki slowly placed his glass back down onto the table and looked back up at him, an unspoken question hanging in the ether between them, gathering static so rapidly it bit at Sherlock’s skin.
Granted, after the hour or so he spent huddled in the bathroom, John had exited so mentally and emotionally exhausted he’d switched to autopilot. His only goal then was to go to sleep and he very well could have closed the window without knowing it.
It was a gamble in itself. By all accounts Sherlock should have opened with more personal observations to prove his abilities, even with how poorly that could have ended up going. But if he was right to assume Mahir favored risk, well, what was more risky then taking the advice of a complete stranger?
Leave it to Mycroft to be so insipid. As if just being in the proximity of drugs meant Sherlock would instantly relapse. Though it wouldn’t be the first time his brother assumed the worst of him without any
And though their food arrived in an astonishing amount of time and with no bill attached, John wouldn’t let the delivery boy leave without a significant tip.
John furrowed his brow, stealing a quick glance over to where Philip remained haunting Claudia by the drinks table, the poor woman inching away whenever Anderson hovered farther into her personal space.
—big surprise there. Of course
John took a swig from the fresh glass placed in front of him, gasping as the chilled liquid ached its way down into his stomach.
Much like his brother, John was dressed for warmer conditions, sporting his thin blue jumper with the tiny alternating stripes (
Suddenly they’re both falling the short distance to the floor, landing with a hard thump that makes the side table next to the bed shutter. Upon impact the body below him lets out a wheeze as the air is knocked from their lungs.
Speaking of which…John was sure Sherlock had a world map tucked away here somewhere. The challenge laid in trying to make sense of the man’s cryptic organization. Or lack thereof. John had always suspected Sherlock didn’t know half the time where he put anyth—
John often wondered if putting those things into his blog—the one that was already deemed “

He had just finished unpacking his bag, dragging the husk of a duffel and tucking it away in the dark maw under the boxspring. As John stood, he eyed the perfectly made, seemingly endless expanse of bed-surface, a terrible urge overtaking him.  It
John frowned thoughtfully. “You mean unforgettable?”
“What?” Sherlock began tentatively. “Was that—was that not good?”
John had stared down into his cup, watching the black liquid steam as he tried to craft an answer.
And then there was an arm about his shoulders, drawing him in and god help him…John slumped into it, rotating his frame and resting his forehead on a soft shoulder. Martha’s floral perfume was light under his nose. Lavender and rose and something about it—something about the familiarity of it and the embrace and the warmth drove the tightness from John’s chest in a great gasp.
John supposed it was normal for this to feel abnormal. Could almost hear Ella telling him the same thing. It was his first time away on his own when returning meant still
The aroma of onions beginning to fry in perhaps just a smattering too much butter made John’s mouth water. Always had. He’d just dumped the
He hadn’t planned to take Sherlock up on his offer to use his bed. In fact, John really hadn’t given it a second thought until randomly one evening mid-October as he was going through his nightly routine before bed—his own bed incidentally.
“Mmmm no. No. Too dry.”
He waited. He didn’t really know what he was waiting for but John did it anyway, just a few seconds more before pulling the mobile from where it’s been plastered hot and tacky to his face and tapped the red phone icon. He let it slide from his fingers and fall onto his stomach.
sometimes needed to lock himself away in his own head during cases. Quite frankly depending on the gravity of the case and therefore Sherlock’s attitude, sometimes John savored those stretches when the detective would check out for a few hours.
“I think you might have the wrong number yeah?” He reasoned curtly with seemingly no one. “Can you hear me?”
?’ would suddenly lose their luster.
But the world, as it does, went on.
Mary looked a second away from inquiring about his choice of phrasing when John dismissed it with a shake of his head. Luckily she seemed to take the hint and sighed. “I hope so. Took bloody ages to get them to see me. You wouldn’t believe what it’s like out here. Everything local is either at capacity or you have to be someone’s sodding mate to even get a second look. It’s all…
Sherlock laughed softly but genuinely, turning his head to address him. His mirth iced over upon spotting the “wreath” mounted on John’s left shoulder. Not only was it misshapen like every other object on the sweater, it wasn’t even the customary green, but instead red flecked with white and adorned with more little pompoms.
John had been making it a point to max out his time at the clinic. If someone was on leave, out sick, he’d offer to take their shifts too. It kept him occupied, kept him out of the flat and doing
Right now he needed to regroup.
He even overheard John throw it around once or twice with the gravity of an old salt warning about monsters at sea.
“Eloquent as ever…but something along that line, yes.” John heard a brief swishing of movement. Maybe it was a bit whimsical, but he could easily picture Sherlock frowning petulantly in some darkened room or tucked away in some shadowy nook of an alley. All arms crossed and steely looks.
That garnered a response from Sherlock and John felt a flare of relief as the detective looked down at him with a laxer gaze and the makings of a smile.
Sherlock cocked his head, the antlers gently shifting as he regarded John with a touch of haughty amusement. “You’re either very brave or very foolish to come out here tonight. Mainly in
“All kidding aside, you really did wonderfully.” Mary spoke up, breaking the bubble. “I’ve seen my fair share of sutures but yours were pristine.”
God he was rusty. Not that he should be flirting with a girl half his age but still.
The switch flipped and the wires went live.
Greg opened his mouth and then exhaled, cutting himself off before he even began. He pursed his lips, looking off into the office for a moment then flicking his eyes over to John. Seemingly having his own internal debate.
Chancing another peek, it took John a few seconds to spot Lucy’s eyes where they were partially obscured by the glare on her lenses and the shadow cast from the dense, angular swath of her fringe. Instead of shifting about, Lucy’s gaze was instead fixed on a certain point. Attempting to follow her line of sight, John was taken aback to discover it aimed at none other than—
The torment didn’t stop there. Oh no. Four days of answering the same inane questions ad nauseum. Pretending to be pleased to see people he’d never met before and would never encounter again. The incessant playing of “popular” songs disguised as classical music overhead. The requirement to wear a tie. And perhaps the vilest part of all…the smiling.
John was still chuckling as he exited the cab after paying the fair with a bit of his winnings. Sherlock waited for him on the pavement, his hands buried deep in the pockets of his greatcoat. The rain had thankfully stopped but the air was biting enough to not linger outside.
“No I—I get that. I do.” John admitted hastily. “And I’m not talking about that, specifically. It’s just…
.” Lestrade waved the lip veggie indignantly and John nearly choked on his own spit.
“Good.” The detective stated flatly then rolled over, putting his back to him.
When he turned back, he noticed the grim expression Sherlock wore, still swaddled up tightly in his coat and eyeing the way up to Lestrade’s flat with trepidation.
John snaked a hand from under the covers, careful not to let too much cold air in as he searched blindly for his phone. His fingers slapped around the bedside table, trailing up the side, along the edge, and finally over the surface of it, locating the edge of the mobile just as his fingertips began to tingle. The device was frigid when he brought it under and only when John got a proper look at it in the small amount of light diffusing through the bedlinens did he realize he’d grabbed
Not the lot one would peg to be secret agents or spies. John huffed a quiet chuckle and without further ado, tapped the link.
Now he watched as it cycled through the ringer and he
Moving farther inward, John crept along, shining his light here and there. He honestly hadn’t been up here since he moved most of Sherlock’s things into storage. God he hoped nothing was being leaked on. He had tried to pick the best looking spot, nearby the Christmas decorations where the wood looked undamaged. But that didn’t mean that in the time since something hadn’t decided to corrode and start dripping.
John took down the map of plotted points, cleared the call log on his mobile, and did the most clear-cut thing he could…put Sherlock Holmes in the furthest corner of his mind. Tucked away like boxes in a loft.
.” He grumbled, adding to his list with a sharp underline.
“Uh—good question…” John backpedaled, crossing his arms over his chest in thought. “Great question…” He stalled.
Also if you’re a West Bromwich Albion fan, I apologize for my obvious inference that your team is not so good. I just based it off the stats of total losses vs Arsenal.
“I assure you…I’m not like those other bucks.” Sherlock countered, regarding him through lowered lashes as he lifted John’s wrist towards his mouth. Hindered as he was by the unyielding cuff of John’s
“Must be dead boring this time of night.” Roman mused, leaning an elbow on the counter. Sherlock glanced up long enough to hand the cards back, catching the man sporting a rather beguiling grin surrounded by a weeks’ worth of amber stubble on a chiseled jaw.
“Right.” He nodded to himself, settling in. “Fine. That’s good. I’ll just talk to you then.”
Though John didn’t have any particular fondness for raccoons, he had to admit the little things were undeniably cute. Even Sherlock, after the adrenaline and disappointment had worn off, seemed oddly taken with the sight of them. He’d crouched down, small torch in hand while John rung animal control and watched as the kits squirmed and rolled over one another, their eyes still shut tight.
With a sniff and a tiny huff, Martha found her voice again and rebounded into the latest gossip that made up her realm and John strove as best he could to keep up. Doing so reminded him however of trying to revise for an exam an hour beforehand:
There was a phenomenon John found himself undergoing again.
Why, John Watson was a

Gone were the strewn papers littering nearly every surface, the stacks of random books, the boxes filled with files, the odd bric-a-brac stashed about in the sort of organization only a loon or a lazy arse would utilize. The kitchen—as John pulled two bottles of stout Greg had brought over for them from fridge, undone caps pinging on the countertop—looked like an actual
John nearly sobbed with relief when Sherlock removed his fingers and made a hasty grab for the deserted lubricant, the bottle shaking faintly in his grasp as he squirted a messy pool into his palm. He pondered briefly if Sherlock had touched himself at all while priming him or if this was the first time from the low, almost anguished noise he made as he slicked his cock. Rigid and dusky rouge.
Taking another gulp of tea, John placed his mug down and dragged the paper into his lap, digging out a pencil from under a magazine on the side table next to him.

The entirety of the Lestrade’s sweater was knitted in a gaudy lime green and dotted here and there with delicate white snowflakes. Sitting at the bottom right, near his hip, was the giant disembodied head of a gleefully grinning elf complete with pointy hat and nose. While the garment was obviously store bought rather than handmade (
John looked to Sherlock with a baffled grin to see him openly watching the two beneath the mistletoe. Though his expression didn’t give much away, John swore there was a quiet respect there. Curling his lips round two fingers, John made a shrill whistle before joining in on the applause.
Sherlock however, was far more interested in the goings on of room 802 high above him.
He lay there for some time in the dark, shrill violin notes rising above the hiss of a weak station frequency.
He found the predictable sorts upheaval. There was the long standing feud between the Turkish state and the PPK, a Kurdish militant group. There were the Grey Wolves, political separatists striving for the ideal nation. Honor killings. Human trafficking and prostitution. Extortion. The insurgence of gangs and the ever emergent Turkish mafia, both whose primary business was the manufacturing and selling of narcotics.
The relationship between the DI and his wife had been strained over the past year, if the lack of wedding band on Greg’s finger back when they had the Baskerville case was any indication. Not to mention Sherlock’s not so subtle hints at their ongoing troubles. Lestrade ended up moving out of their house shortly after. That at least John knew about.

self-explanatory. “…so he
Abandoning the option of a lie-in in favor of a cuppa and a pain-reliever, John threw off his covers and slipped on his robe against the early morning chill, however plodding barefoot downstairs into the quiet main of the flat.
Although at the moment he considered John with an amused skepticism, his bushy but neatly trimmed mustache crooked up at one side, Collins seemed pleasant enough.
“I’ll probably have to move out eventually anyway.” He continued. “I can’t keep up with the bills on my own and I won’t ask Mrs. Hudson to lower the rent. I’m only paying one half as it is.”
John’s face fell. “
Work was about the only place he could set aside himself and concentrate on something else. Where John could quiet that hankering to tear himself and anyone else apart.

“Sherlock, while that’s kind of you and all I—” The doctor tried again.

?” The detective snapped, the antlers jerking sharply. His gaze flicked down towards John’s lips and the doctor realized he’d been licking them over none too innocently, before shooting back up to his eyes. Whatever they were currently doing made Sherlock’s scowl mollify as he gave a husky, “Oh.”
Lestrade chuckled airily, the sound whistling over the rim of his bottle as he took another drink. “I was gonna say riot zone, but yeah.”
“Die that is.” Greg supplemented, devouring the other half of his pickle and going for another, determined to drown his nerves in brine. All the while John listened; he somehow succeeded in keeping a passive face. The idea of Philip Anderson of
Mary gave a breathy laugh, bowing her head for a moment before she glanced at him under the soft curve of brown lashes. “We’ll see.” John caught himself staring again, the café falling to the wayside of his attention even as the door whooshed loudly open as another patron entered. How he missed the sound when Mary arrived, he chalked up to being so focused on his reading.
with a D, it’s inconsequential.” He appended critically as if John was the one pestering him for the proper name.
“I believe it.” Mary replied. There was something wistful in her tone and as John glanced up he caught a minute look of sadness on the woman’s features. It passed a second later as she adopted a pleasant smile. “I should probably get going. I have an interview ungodly early tomorrow over at Saint Thomas’ in Westminster.”
“If you’d mind raising your window.” Mycroft nodded, gesturing to put it up with a flick of his wrist.
right. Everything a maneuver on a board to get the two of us in place to make his final move.”
“I told them if you saw a single seed I had the right to affray.” John assured him as he pulled out his own sandwich—a smoked roast chicken, thinly sliced on a crusty sourdough with spinach, mozzarella, and a generous smear of pesto.  And if the heavenly smell coming off it was any indication, the owners put as much loving care into making their pesto as they did their sauerkraut.
Sherlock’s gamble at the track that day with Mahir had paid off for them both. Though in distinctly different ways. Tiryaki had continued to humor him, inquiring which horses he
“Or within the next half-hour…”
So I had intended to dabble a little with Sherlock's time away and just show a bit of what he was up to. I had a few next destinations for him going along with John's phone calls, Turkey being one of them. After doing research I found out one of the major crime problems over there is heroin production and selling. And that just seemed too perfect to not have Sherlock deal with. And thus, Sherlock went to Turkey and here we are lol.
“Hold up.” John lowered his voice again, halting in front of the packages of various chicken parts wrapped in plastic and carefully organized. He made a partial show of sorting through the boneless skinless chicken breasts, dipping his head to mutter. “You’re on a stake-out and you
It was
Before he knew it however, a new year was being ushered in all over the globe and John wasn’t quite ready to let the old one go
Something about it sent a heady excitement through him and John had to shut his eyes, his fingers curling tighter around his cock as it throbbed low at the base. He held his breath for a beat, letting the arousal diffuse from his head to the tips of his toes.

to write the whole rest of the thing out and then publish on a regular schedule. But apparently without the WIP motivation of needing to get the next chapter up mixed with my own personal hangups, no writing gets done.

“Erm—No, I—suppose not. Say, do you think I might be able to nab a shower at the Turners?” John tried, desperate for a subject change. His ploy seemed to pay off as he looked back up just in time to see her expression brighten.
It would do.
brightly, causing the hairs on the back of Sherlock’s neck to rise. Keen eyes watched intently as the down indicator above it lit up. As the metal doors spread, two women exited, laughing to one another as they headed towards the bar.
“Your body’s craving more…want me to give it to you?”
while the victims were sleeping in the very same room.
“Too much?” John released himself, letting one hand fall to his stomach and the other to the side, knuckles lightly brushing against the soft skin above Sherlock’s knee. After a moment of getting his bearings, Sherlock gave a faint nod.
) got his hopes up.
friend or whatever the hell people always assumed about them—in that instant he couldn’t bring himself to make an argument against the insinuation.
He’d looked around a bit, taking in Sherlock’s large wardrobe, the chair beside it, the shelves he could just barely make out from where he stood, noting the shapes of objects but not their exact identification. Finally his gaze fell to the sizeable—and as Sherlock himself had put it ‘

at the base of the fireplace. Whoever crafted this fine piece of apparel had intended to depict Santa having arrived after traveling down the chimney, but with the way the figure was placed and rotated it appeared more like his lifeless body had been propped up against a wall. Presumably after delivering the pile of dreadfully textured presents located around John’s navel.

“You’re not the only one with medical knowledge dear.” She said with a calm decisiveness and pushed it into his hand before navigating around the coffee table towards the couch.
“Yeah, we
“Indeed.” Sherlock concurred, with the hint of a smile in his voice.
“Have you been listening to me?” Greg stopped them some twelve meters away, staring tensely.

“I can feel you taking me in. Opening for me.” Sherlock panted, an unmistakable tremor in his voice and John realized that he was idly grinding himself against his thigh. Though for how long now he had no clue. John’s concept of time and awareness had boiled down to nothing but the finger inside him and the deep voice purring over his chest.
hours late. Not too sure.”
“Honestly John, I don’t mind. Do use it.” And before he could get in another word otherwise, Sherlock dropped the subject and launched into a new one. “Let’s see…what else can I tell you.” John stared out into the middle distance of the sitting room for a beat, flabbergasted and strangely, a bit chuffed.  He ended up shrugging off the exchange and rolling lazily for his sweating drink, switch the mobile from one hand to the other again.
“Think John, you’ve seen it before. It’s unmistakable. The prolong looks, the melancholy expression, the self-distancing.”
“The back door leading into the kitchen of the Andrew’s home was rammed open by a heavy object. Specifically something that could make a row of three puncture marks and was composed of bronze. Our would be burglar found such an item located in Mrs. Andrew’s back garden in the form of a sixty centimeter tall bronze statue of a Poseidon holding a trident. But that’s not the important part…”
as he could without outright saying it.
“Don’t confuse my delay for disinterest.” He continued, managing to rein himself in with a poise John had seen utilized countless times when Sherlock deemed it necessary to playact. As instantaneous as a flick of a switch. “As I already said, I conduct things differently…”
of liquid pouring.
of Sherlock. Mostly the permeated traces of cigarette smoke, but there was also a hint of his expensive cologne and a combination of other scents too subtle for the doctor to decipher.
Chuckling into his tea cup, John downed the last drop. It was only after the cup hitting the saucer was a little too resonating in the room that the doctor noted Martha had gone quiet.
Pulling the box containing the files off the top of the stack, John set it on the ground, kneeling beside it. He dug his fingers into the seams of the cardboard flaps and pried them apart, instantly greeted by the smell of paper and just the faint hint of cigarette smoke.
“Lift your hips,” Sherlock ordered softly and John complied, one pillow positioned comfortably between his bum and the small of his back. The other, slipped carefully beneath his head.
Then again, sometimes even the best laid defenses can be upheaved by the naivest of things…
John missed whatever words went with the movement, but he could certainly hear the growing desperation and excitement in the man’s muffled tone and see it coil up in his shoulders. Which was more than enough to put John on the defensive.
He could practically hear Sherlock saying something to the effect of:
When Sherlock then lowered his hand between John’s thighs, the doctor braced himself for the touch of the cool, wet finger. A sharp inhale escaped him, the back of his head tipping into the pillow as Sherlock made contact, rubbing his fingertip over hot puckered skin. Stopping periodically to gather another swipe of fluid warming in his palm and applying it to John’s entrance.
Greg gave a cynical puff, washing down his mouthful with a chug of soda. He curled a fist to his lips to stifle what turned out to be a robust burp. “Cor…s’cuse me.” The DI pardoned himself, his black leather chair squeaking as he reclined. “Nothing particularly
Stepping off the stoop of 221B and onto the pavement later that evening, belly stuffed full of the best home cooking he had in ages, Greg rifled through his pockets for his cigarettes and a lighter. He’d just skimmed his fingers over the rectangular shape of the pack when from another pocket, his phone began bleeping loudly.
Despite the gravity of the conversation, how drained he was with it—with this entire seemingly endless night, Sherlock couldn’t stop a bemused little smile from spreading. “Can’t have that.” He murmured to himself, the taut grip at his scalp easing. Slowly he smoothed his hand down to rest on the back of his neck, relishing the transference of heat between the two plains of skin.

Out of all them—nine in total, only two appeared to be landlines, the rest were mobile numbers according his query results.
Lestrade gave an appreciative but muffled
Drawing his eyes away from the newspaper he swiped over the screen, an eyebrow raising as he quickly read over the new text message in his inbox. With a sniff he picked the phone up and navigated to the number pad, tapping three numbers and activating his speed dial.
Outside, Baker Street had gone still. Only the occasional car passed, tires hissing along the damp tarmac or the soft grind of shoes along the pavement as someone ventured out into the muggy evening.

John gave her a stiff but pleasant smile before the doctor put some distance between them by heading towards the mushrooms.
Also, have you noticed those random looking separators between story sections each chapter?
What Dr. Thompson didn’t realize though, was that while beating the innards out of a sack of sand might help him blow off some pent up uneasiness, it would do nothing to alleviate the shear fury John held for himself.

This time however he simply enjoyed the tale.
You want to get your broth up to a nice bubble, maybe turn the heat up to medium high. And let the stuff in there meld a bit. About
John would have invited Mrs. H up for a bite, but by the time he’d finished his shift and made it back home, the landlady had turned in for the evening. At least John assumed so going by the lack of the telly blaring from her flat. He decided to bring her some leftovers tomorrow morning—a humble deposit against the mountain of meal-debt he’d accrued over his residency. Not that he amassed it
unbelievably sexy.” He murmured, glancing up. The corners of Sherlock’s mouth had quietly curled and there was an unmistakable darling splash of pink spreading over his cheeks.
Despite Sherlock’s stony vestige, John was reminded of a young boy quietly brooding on the sidelines, aching to be anywhere else but there. He’d never pegged Sherlock to be anything resembling a wallflower and he expected the only reason he could see it at all was because of how intimately John knew him by now. But there it was. Right below the surface and to John, more than a little heartbreaking.
“I mean untraceable.” Mycroft volleyed back, looking positively affronted. “Trust me when I say I have zero interest in listening in on whatever it is you two gab about.” He spat with enough distain that John actually believed him.
Sherlock’s gaze traveled downward, following one of the taunt tendons of John’s throat, lingering around his collarbone where it peeked from the collar of his rumpled t-shirt before sweeping out somewhere beyond his shoulder. He remained mute, a familiar stony defiance that told John he’d have better luck growing a second head then getting a response out of him.
John had come to a dead halt on the pavement, people pushing past him with annoyed glares but he no longer registered them and instead snarled into his phone.
While the last of his words crackled in the air, Sherlock fixed her with a reproachful smirk. A silent invitation for rebuttal. He suspected however by the aghast look on Mme. B-Something’s blanched face, her lower lip trembling as it gaped, rumpled tissue still hovering by her owlish eyes; that none would be coming.
He glanced up again and gave Greg a half smile before knocking back the last of his now room-temperature soda. Well that was about as bumpy as John imagined. Even worse as Greg seemed to accept it with a frightfully sympathetic nod.
“Tomorrow morning then.” The detective huffed in setback, enclosing John in his arms. Sherlock nuzzled his face against his brow until he found a comfortably position, his breath warming the skin along John’s scalp just under his nostrils.
uninvited, the fact that Sherlock recognized as much was encouraging. John’s chin sunk downward, taking in the blue, grey, and white plaid pattern of his boxers. He was still at a loss for a reply when Sherlock was suddenly talking again, the detective’s voice tight and a little frustrated.
But that evening, the doctor had crossed the short distance and reached for the knob, hinges whining as he eased the door open slowly, just enough to pop his head round it. The light from the bathroom spilled in, cutting the blackness like a knife of murky white.

They began a slow stroll down the pavement. John couldn’t fathom why in the world Mycroft Holmes would slip him a get out of jail free card. Guilt? Was it possible for that man to even feel guilty?
“What happened to ‘
The suspect, one Lloyd Burberry, had approached John soon thereafter, asking if he needed help. Donning an admittedly dreadful Russian accent, John had bombarded Burberry with questions about landmarks. The man in turn had directed him patiently, never breaking his kind demeanor even as he pulled a rather impressive switchblade from his pocket and quietly requested John to follow him. At least, that had been Lloyd’s intent until he was tackled backwards into the fountain by a dark blur of shabby, sour-smelling clothes.
Ah, that made a bit more sense. Upon trying to reply, John’s vocal cords felt coated in fresh tarmac. “
He had lost track of Gage following the Dufort fiasco and judging by the state of decomposition, Thomas must have died relatively soon after.
At the very least it gave the doctor some small insight into what was going on in that vast and intricate brain of—
wrong with that…”
“Shall we?” Sherlock dropped the keys gently into the doctor’s palm as he raised it, the corners of his mouth lifting faintly while the rest of his expression remained unreadable.
No idea if this was purposely done to be awful or someone made this in earnest. But it is brilliant.
“Yeah I want transparency! I want
. And maybe he was just a bona fide sidekick at the time, but solving crimes had become something as much a part of him as being a doctor and a soldier.
The detective’s right lower eyelid gave a faint twitch, his hands balling into fists by his sides.
Admittedly, it was a damn fancier device in comparison. Newer, silkier, didn’t bog up if you used the internet browser too much—or,
“I can’t imagine being with anyone else like I want to with you.” He was delighted to feel a sudden quickening of Sherlock’s pulse under his palm, a silent indicator that he was indeed on the right track. John felt it too after all. What he was saying was frightfully intimate. Ironic since both of them were currently
Desperate for a spot, the doctor’s gaze halted on the wall above the couch and narrowed.
The headband completely vanished in the Sherlock’s hair—a little untamed as the man hadn’t planned on leaving the flat that evening. It gave the illusion that the chocolate brown, velvety antlers were actually sprouting from his skull while only the very tips of the wee light brown ears popped out from his curls.
He bent over, snaking a long arm into the dark recess between the desk and the wall, feeling for the sleek laptop he had tucked away there earlier. He drew it out, careful not to jostle the power cord and have the computer revert to standby while still recording the stream from Gage’s room. He set it down on the desk and grabbed a nearby rolling chair, swirling round to face the laptop.
—and that was a big if—Anderson’s website was legitimate, maybe there was some clue, some connection to be found.
John had subsequently turned off the comments on his blog and was seriously contemplating shutting off his phone for the foreseeable future. Not that mattered; they were calling the landline too.
John had never hated a month as much as he hated June.
There’s something immensely rage inducing about waking up before one’s alarm. Seriously murderous. Like someone stolen something unremarkable to them but valuable to you. Even more frustrating when the thief was your own damn brain.
“I’m making a roast tonight if you’re interested?” Mrs. Hudson inquired with a smile and then immediately followed with. I’ll bring some up later.” Scrunching her nose and patting John on the cheek like he’d just agreed.
Or Molly, bearing the burden of knowledge she did for him. Though Sherlock supposed not having him around to pester her for body parts and access to corpses was a bit of a relief nonetheless.
I don’t mind you know. I mean about you being a bit possessive of me, not someone checking out my arse…though I can’t say I really mind that either…” He muttered teasingly, and felt the subtle dip of Sherlock’s waist twitch beneath his palm.
“Less like a calamity?” John offered, taking a pull himself, the thick richness of the stout going down blissfully smooth. Greg had damn good taste in beer. John couldn’t fathom just then why they never made a pub crawl together.
“He’s not
With a huff he climbed up, stopping half way when he could see most of the loft from his eye-level. Moving the torch around, John shined it on the beams, looking for any signs of soaked wood or wetness. Wherever this leak was it must have been deeper than he could see from here because the rafters looked bone dry.
“For the last time—
“Because it’s not on to use your deceased mate’s clout like some members card, that’s why.” John rebutted as unobtrusively as possible, giving the people passing by him a furtive glance. “Look, you can help me pick out a bottle, yeah?” Surprisingly, he received no further argument on the subject.
Leaning towards him like were some secret meeting, the manager kept his voice even and low as he spoke. “Madame Bélanger here has raised some
“Third shelf from the top, fifth from the right.” Sherlock had declared so quickly after the message was sent, that John would have sworn he’d simply rattled off a bottle at random if there hadn’t actually been a third shelf.
Though the idea of a quick nod off and full night’s sleep was exceedingly tempting, the chance he’d be a zombie tomorrow morning wasn’t. So, choosing responsibility over need, John recapped the bottle and put it away into his kit. Vowing to start the medication as soon as he got back.
“Trust me, I’ve been there.” He said, looking out to the middle of the café over Ms. Morstan’s shoulder. “Rent’s due, the money’s running out…” It was no small miracle John ran into Mike Stamford that day in the park. And he knew firsthand how the intervention of a stranger could turn your life around. Turned it right on its head granted. But he’d be amiss if John didn’t recognize Sherlock had saved his life the very moment they’d met at Barts.
No, what had John baffled currently was the

eating. Maybe not as much as he use to—his appetite lately was flighty but, it wasn’t like he was starving.
It was such a trivial question to get thrown by, but John found he didn’t have an answer right away. What was a good color for behaving like a crazy person? Sherlock always used—
He slowly drew the mobile away and stared at it, realizing he was gaping when John licked over his lips and felt how dry the skin was. In fact his whole mouth seemed like it was lined with cotton.
Both men remained there quietly: Sherlock licking over his bottom lip, no doubt tasting the blooming tang of copper well before the sharp sting where his tongue met split flesh; John letting out another labored breath as his head fell backwards against the corner of the mattress, hands landing limply in his lap, having his own revelation. Shades of his nightmare seeping in.
Navigating back to the forum, the doctor found the date of the first post and noted it was created back in the middle of June. Just about a few days before Sherlock had revealed himself to him.
Crossing the room, the doctor opened the left door to find a more than adequate closet where he hung up his coat. He then tried the other door and carefully turned the knob, peaking through the crack to find darkness on the other side. Opening it fully he discovered a small broom closet with another similar door at the other end. Resting against one wall was an ironing board with an iron hanging next to it; several shelves lined either side containing extra pillows, blankets, and sheets. John wondered briefly if he had a neighbor. If there was one, he couldn’t hear them from where he was standing.

“I could bloody well kill you myself for the shite you pulled but I don’t—
John’s eyes trailed down to the device. He hesitated, something rebelling in him. Something seething, angry. Like Stage 2 had left the band and was striking up a solo career now that John had no reason to grieve.
Therefore, whoever this was either didn’t know him or…was trying to conceal their identity.
“And who are we if not—
Greg simply nodded, listened, and John was inexpressibly thankful for it. He wasn’t looking for a solution and being able to state his thoughts out loud, to just talk, felt more beneficial than any advice or pity he usually received.
Sherlock gave a distasteful scoff.

The last time he experienced this odd flux was when he’d just come back from being discharged. The first two weeks blended together as he got his affairs in order—met with military personnel in London in regards to his pension, contacted his folks, managed to meet up with his sister, put a deposit down on that coffin of a bedsit.
Sherlock trembled and could barely move. But John's voice kept him going. He wished that he was here with him now already. This was all too much.
Johns face hardened when he listened to him speak, turning his head to look at him and he met Sherlocks eyes with fire in his own. "Sentiment is for the losing side?" He growled before clenching his fists "No Sherlock, you are wrong. Its sentiment, love and caring that keeps you fighting till the end, which helps you win." He said "And you have no right to talk about sentiment when you have my tatty union jack pillow which you keep refusing to get rid of Sherlock." He said firmly, glancing away briefly before sighing, shaking his head before looking away from him "You can be so bloody cold... I clearly must be on the losing side then since I care about you massively and I also Lov-" the male stopped what he was saying, shaking his head as he knew he couldnt continue that sentance, wouldn't tell Sherlock of his feelings
“John, I...”
“John, listen, I...”, Sherlock started, still out of words. This situation was overwhelming him. He should let go of John, he should let him go to his room, where he could be alone, where he could cry and think, just like Sherlock had done it when he had been younger, when he had been hurt. He had never understood why people wanted physical contact when they were sad as he had never gotten any in these moments, he himself preferred to be just left alone, but John was an ordinary human being. And as much as he used this as an insult when he talked about Anderson, it was a compliment in this case and something he actually wished he could be too.
"We need to make him come out, make him want to play. What if, we just continue to live in Baker Street as we normally do, make him think we aren't affected by his mind tricks? Yes, I know Sherlock," John said, looking at the fear on Sherlock's face, "I know it will be dangerous, very dangerous, but if we are together constantly in the apartment then there is no way of him getting me without you witnessing it or being able to stop it. If you did see it, you could follow them or at least deduce what you can, because we both know it sure as hell won't be Moriarty doing the dirty work."
John frowned, squeezing his eyes shut and groaning. "But I need a shower...." He tried to pull himself off of the bed slightly, but it seemed to pull him even harder back, like it had its own gravitational force, keeping John firmly on the mattress. The duvet was still beneath him, so even if he wanted to get under it, he couldn't. His boy literally felt like stone.
“Sherlock, you can't just go there! You passed out yesterday!”
“Do you really think there would be anybody who I would rather spend time with than with you?”, he asked, looking down on his broken John, who wanted to answer but Sherlock didn't let him, “Do you think so? Because I can tell you it's not true. And you know that. You're being hurt, that's all. That's why you're mad at me. But listen, John, I had no other choice. I had to do this, Moriarty's out there somewhere and he will definitely come after you if he sees that I care about you. I can't risk that.”
"Mm? Oh, yeah, sure." He mumbled before returning his attention to Sherlock, this time focusing on the sharp slopes of his face.
"Okay, be careful", Sherlock replied and still held his hands out just in case he'd have to catch John. He didn't know how long it'd take to recover, but he wouldn't risk anything.
“What?”
"I'm sorry."
“Have you forgotten who we're dealing with? It's Moriarty, he's a criminal mastermind, but most of all, like me. And as you have so politely mentioned once, John: I am a drama queen, and so is Moriarty. He won't kill me at once, otherwise he would have already. Why would he have put his face like an advertisement on every screen in the UK? He wanted attention. He could have killed me easily, if he had wanted to, blow up the plane for instance, but he didn't. No, something bigger is coming up to us and I bet it's all made for me, all to make me suffer. For what reason ever.”
John saw the confusion on Sherlock's face through the muddy darkness, and gently eased himself beside Sherlock, just so they were touching, and if Sherlock felt comfortable, he could put his arm around him or spoon him. It didn't matter if he did or not, John wanted him to feel relaxed and not forced into anything he didn't want to do. "It's ok, my little tin soldier..." John murmured, watching the world through heavy eyelids.
"Apart from alcohol poisoning from Harry, I can't think of any way else." John said dryly.
Veronika
John realised at that moment just how worn out he was. His eyes were heavy and his entire body felt sluggish, whether they were a side affect of whatever hell had gone on inside his head, he still felt that sleep was the best bet. In fact, he could... Just go to s..leep right.. Here...
A bomb. Somewhere was a bomb. I ran out of the kitchen. He'd tell me where it was. That's why he wanted me upstairs. A riddle, a case. Something like that, something to solve. That was Moriarty. He wouldn't let me die that easily. Right?
I fought the darkness that wanted to swallow me, that I wanted to give in to and sleep. I stayed with John.
John felt a stab of shock hit him, he wasn't mad! He was just... Embarrassed by his obvious need to feel close to Sherlock. "No... I... I'm not mad Sherlock." He said quietly, "I know you're new to this, I forgot, I'm sorry, I'm sorry Sherlock, I'll tell you next time." John said soothingly, not wanting Sherlock to think he was angry at something he couldn't help.
Sherlock: *sips tea, acts confused* Hm? What was what?
“Come here, now!”
“I love you..”
"Exactly."
John shut his eyes briefly before looking back at Sherlock with tired amusement shining in his eyes.
“M. watching. Secret location, remember?
He blocked that memory from his mind, now was not the time for a relapse of that sort. To his side, he clenched his fists with determination. One leg rose, and he planted it on the brown carpet below. No problems there, balance was good. He tried the other leg, and it followed in succession. Yes! John felt relief flood him and he let out a silent cheer.
Sherlock looked back at John in surprise. Hearing these words, although he had heard them before, made him incredible happy, despite the context that he had, again, made a mistake. "Then this was correct..."
John let out a breathless laugh as he listened to the flustered male speak, his own cheeks turning a deep shade of red and he slowly ran his tongue along his bottom lip when he noticed Sherlock was staring at them "Well... if he has already got cameras set up... its a little late to show him that you 'dont care' about me" he breathed, studying Sherlocks eyes briefly before carefully leaning in. John pulled the taller male down closer to him and he let out a hum, a smile on his lips "Cant we just he this moment..?" He muttered before pressing his lips against Sherlock, a jolt of excitement rushing through the doctors veins.
"I know." John whispered through ragged breaths. And with that, he became engulfed in the tranquil sea of sleep.
“Neither do I”, replied Sherlock to John saying that he didn't want for this to stop. And the detective spoke with a warmth in his voice that he had forgotten that it was capable of.
He wasn't ready to admit that he had been overwhelmed by his feelings, neither to John nor to himself.
John's eyebrows flicked up.
He took the shirt John had passed him and put it on. It felt strange, he usually didn't wear these kinds of shirts, but it wasn't bad. It was “comfy”, just as John had explained.
"John!", Sherlock got up and followed him, but looked away as he saw that John had already undressed himself.
“You were distracted by your emotions that's just human”, he said and looked around, wondering if somebody had followed them, and also he couldn't stand John's burning look, “It's not your fault that you're...”, he could stop himself there just in time before he would probably hurt John's feelings again.
John: Sherlock. No. What are you doing-
John could feel everything now that the barrier had slipped into his knees. It was all he could do from freezing in place from the heightened sensitivity he had down there, but he continued to kiss Sherlock, taking precaution not to brush against anything that might sent a shock through him.
Sherlock was surprised by the intensity John went with, although he had expected it. Still it... turned him on too and once he was being pushed against a wall he couldn't hold himself back and kissed John passionately while running his fingers through his hair again.
“Then I'm looking forward to tomorrow”, Sherlock replied mirroring John's grin.
He loved to feel John inside of him, dear lord yes he did! There definitely were nerves that he stimulated, but he was getting really hard and he needed to be released.
Meet me at Roast.
John blinked at Sherlocks sudden enthusiasm to spending some time with him, a smile of happiness and surprise washing over his face and he nodded "Yes! Lets get out of here and grab some food.. im starving!" He groaned and a sly smirk grew onto his lips when Sherlock took a hold of his arm briefly, John gently placing his hand over Sherlocks arm before turning to look at Molly, Giving her a smug smile "See you later Molly!" He giggled, knowing he was making her jealous as the male walked out of the room with the detective. John hummed as he followed alongside him, his leg no longer giving him any troubles as all the thoughts of the nightmares before had been removed from his brain. However there was one thing confusing him, Sherlocks enthusiasm and Giggle. John smirked and shook his head, grabbing his arm and cautiously linking their arms together "Mmm What are you up to? No good im guessing" he smirked up at Sherlock, sticking his tongue out briefly
John leant back on his chair and took a sip of his tea.
John was pulled from his trance by Sherlock's deep voice.
Sherlock had laid down on the bed again. How could he possibly be so stupid? Why couldn't he just think? He hurt John badly, he knew that. And although he said it would be fine it probably wouldn't be.
John braced himself by taking in a deep breath, and looked at Sherlock, silently begging for him to take over and explain it, the detective stared back, but made no inclination that he was going to speak. Ok then. "W-Well..." John started, averting his gaze to the floor. He wiped his hand with his mouth, what the hell should he say? Well, we're here because a manic psychopath, who I shot and killed, has decided to stalk us and whilst he's at it, kill me, because Sherlock and I are fucking each other in secret and this man, whose Irish by the way, will do anything to make Sherlock's life a living hell, so we, I specifically, decided to come here because I haven't come here in years, so he won't know where we are. Would that cover it? Her eyebrows rose with expectation. "Well...?" She asked, wanting John to continue his unfinished sentence. That woman could strike John with pure fear at times, even when she didn't mean to.
Sherlock looked into John's eyes, moving from one to the other. What was this question to be answered with one word? There was so much that John was. He was his salvation, he was the one who made his heart beat faster, who made him smile without a reason, who could always brighten up his days and brought him happiness. John was the one who was different from anybody else, whose behaviour was highly interesting and whose features were worth observing, he was both protective and to be worried about. He was the one. But how to describe that in one word?
Sherlock shook his head slightly “I'm not really able to eat now“. He wasn't even really able to think. Which was really bad for him. He just closed his eyes; his mind was empty now. He didn't think. He just heard the noises the car made, John's breath, his voice and other sudden sounds that appeared out of nowhere. It was an emptiness that surely wasn't healthy, but it helped him calm down, it made everything seem far away. Sherlock's reflexes would have been really bad if they had been asked to act, it was... peaceful.
"Are you alright? You look so tired..."
"The restaurant?" John asked, gently lowering himself next to Sherlock on the bed.
John gave him a gentle smile and slowly nodded, leaning up and kissing the other males nose gently "Okay, lets get ready for bed and then I will show you the best places to lie" he nodded firmly before slowly slipping off the bed so he could get undressed, the Doctor slowly stripping off his shirt before pausing "Erm... I hope it isnt a problem, but I usually just sleep in my boxers, but if you want me to wear pjs, just say" he mumbled, cheeks turning a soft red before he slowly unzipped his jeans, allowing them to be pushed off and crumple down on the floor. John looked over to the detective who was still dressed and he chuckled softly, shaking his head "Im not cuddling you while im half naked and you are clothed, take them off, you can borrow some PJ's if you are uncomfortable... I just.. like the feeling and heat of Skin on Skin" he muttered before shifting across to the bed, slowly sitting down on it and smiling at Sherlock.
John chuckled happily before pausing as he listened to the male say they should go to the bathroom. John felt his mouth go dry before he glanced away from him "Erm... Are you... Are you Serious?" He asked, cheeks turning a deep shade of red as he thought of the things they could do, able to feel arousal run through him and into his crotch. John growled and took a hold of his hand, a smirk on his lips "Follow me" he smirked at him before tugging him towards the bathroom, eyes hardening as he pulled him along and inside. Once inside, he pushed Sherlock into one of the stalls and instantly locked lips with a hum
"If you fully trust me, Sherlock, then you would have told me to look for signs of poison!"
He had been observing the room before, but it was too dark to really see anything, the lamp that was burning must have been old and it didn't work that well anymore. Still Sherlock could already sense that this room was comfortable. It had belonged to John. How couldn't it be?
"I'll tell you when we get to our room, soldier..."
John grumbled quietly as he slowly began to come around after the deepest sleep he'd had in years. The male hummed and he slowly peeled himself off the warm patch of Skin his cheek was stuck to, sweat wetting his hair. John groaned softly and reached up, running his fingers through his wet hair carefully before blinking his eyes open, looking up at the body beneath him. John smirked as he saw the detective still in a soft sleep. The doctor hummed and gently kissed along Sherlock's jawline before letting out a groan as he felt his crotch brush against the mattress. John internally swore as he glanced down, finally realizing why his heart was pounding so much and why his hair was damp with sweat "Fucking Morning Wood" he panted softly in annoyance before resting his head down against Sherlock's shoulder. John wrapped an arm around Sherlock and slowly played with the bottom of his shirt "It's all your fault.." he muttered quietly, chewing on his bottom lip as he cautiously allowed his hand to slip underneath Sherlock's shirt, his hand resting on the males stomach. John was able to feel heat increase in his crotch and he groaned, cheeks darkening in colour as he slowly danced his fingers along Sherlock's stomach, finding himself getting more aroused as his mind began to fantasize about the sleeping detective.
He looked at him when he entered the living room and a slight blush scurried over his cheeks when their eyes met. He nodded towards John as a thank you and went to the kitchen to get the tea, then he sat down.
“Oh Sherlock, shouldn't you be holding back your pet a bit? He seems to be slightly misbehaving. Interrupting our quick-witted repartee”, he turned to the detective now and approached him, self confident and unpredictable as always.
“What is it?”, I asked, but Sherlock didn't reply. He just stood in front of the window, staring outside, the curtains blowing in the wind. I slowly attended him, looked at him, came to stand next to him. His view was frozen, he didn't even move. I knew that state of his, but not like this. It wasn't just detached as usual, I was able to detect fright in his eyes, but also a sense of excitement.
"No, if you are you're pushing me by all those feelings you give to me", Sherlock said, still out of breath and slightly trembling from excitement, "But it's a good thing. I want this now. I want you to release me."
I didn't comment on what Anderson said this time, I didn't even really listen. Anderson: Boring. The case: VERY exciting! So many questions I couldn't answer yet, so many clues yet to find, so many riddles to solve.
John would've touched Sherlock, but he couldn't simultaneously keep up his rhythm and stroke. The detective spiked have to do it himself, there was no other way. A buildup of pleasure had began to grow in John's member, and signified the approach to ejacaculation. He started to pant.
Sherlock was happy that he could do John some good. After their kiss he took a break from it and just stared at John. He looked at his face, bright and clear in front of his own, his eyes, his lips, his nose. Sweet perfection.
“I hear that more often than I should, M'am”, he replied and slightly laughed. He didn't want to mention John being short in this case. Who knew if she was sensitive about that?
Johns smile dropped from his face when he listened to that usual monotone response. The male let out a groan and tilted his head up, staring up at the ceiling briefly "God give me strength" he scoffed before shaking his head, Sipping his tea before sitting down in his usual chair. The doctor watched the sociopath carefully, Allowing his thumb to run along his bottom lip as he studied the curls. A chuckle escaped his lips as he allowed himself to become lost in Sherlocks image for a few moments before blinking when he realised he was staring at him. John coughed nervously into his hand and he shifted in his seat, looking down at the paper carefully but he found that he wasnt able to pay attention to the blur of words and pictures in front of him. John closed the paper in obvious anger, slowly tapping his fingers on his knee as he waited for the detective to show any sign of him actually registering his presence. "Sherlock, I made you tea." He said firmly, glancing to the cup of tea he had placed next to the detective which was still untouched. The male slowly stood back up, scratching at his stomach which caused his shirt to rise slightly "I suppose you want me to get dressed then? Since we are heading out?" He presumed, hoping that for once, Sherlock would not rush out on his own.
“Moriarty died as a Martyr, John. Just like Emilia Ricoletti he was part of a group that would continue his work after his death. He would always exist as an idea of perfect crime and danger in our heads, and that's also what's coming up to us. I thought I had killed every single person that stood behind him, but it seems I have overlooked a few people. And what they plan to do is pretty simple.”
"John, listen, he can't have survived...", Sherlock said carefully as he didn't want his companion to drown in illusions and wrong hopes, "I don't know what happened to the blood, not yet, but that doesn't mean that he... he wasn't killed."
“I will look for it”, John said and started to search the floor. But there was no time... I prepared myself to burst the door open. So I started to run, but...
John laughed quietly also, and shook his head slightly, smiling. He was used to this, his mother wasn't known to be the quiet woman, but rather one who spoke her mind, and cracked jokes like they were eggs.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
but you know, she's...
John shrugged his shoulders, they might as well pay for it, they hadn't had a proper meal in a while, a good full English sounded like a godsend to John. He turned to look at "Kelly" and nodded.
"At least I don't have to buy her anything for Christmas anymore." John said numbly, trying to lighten the situation halfheartedly.
At first he feared that he'd be too heavy for John, as he was much taller than him, but he was wrong because his soldier was strong. And he did like that.
“For that he had to be quite thin, a person with too much weight would have needed more time, a professional, probably from a climbing club, going to a centre often, practicing, so he has a membership. There are 23 climbing gyms in london, 3 exclusive ones, which he can afford going by the price he must have paid for the paint. Going by the kind of climbing that was necessary, it must have been “Wallwards climbing”.”
John accepted, and failed to suppress the look of sheer glee at the shock on Harry's face. He felt her wide eyes follow them as they walked up the stairs together towards John's mum's room. The door they arrived at was normal like all the other doors, except for the slight crack in its otherwise smooth surface. John lightly rapped on the wood, and a small weak voice asked them to come in. It was at this point that John stopped holding Sherlock's hand, his mum was frail, and it was better to tell her gradually that John was no longer straight, or thought that he was.
John held his breath and covered his face in embarrassment, trying to stay as quiet as he could except it was very very difficult considering Sherlock still had his hands on him and his bulge was pressed into Sherlock's thigh. "S-Sherlock" he whispered when he could hear the man urinating "P-Please stop touching me" he whined, moving into the touch instead of out of It, praying that the detective wouldn't trigger one of his sensitive spots and make the Doctor moan. John breathed slowly in and out through his nose, reaching down to press his hand against his bulge, rubbing it slightly as he tried to get some friction, knowing things could have been far worse if they were undressed or actually... Having sex.
"John, you are and have always been my priority. If this is too much for you.. damn, it's all my fault."
“Why would that cause us to leave?”, he asked and as he didn't want to sound like a child he added, “I bet there are a lot of things you could do with it.”
Sherlock looked at John in desperate worry as his voice revealed how broken he really was. He wanted to help him. But what could he do?
~Sherlock's point of view~
"Then who else could have done it? Because it was only us four in the house."
“I mean that you can't protect me. Don't look at me like that, it's not about you, I know you're a fantastic fighter and great soldier, I am very aware of that. But what can the strongest soldier do when he's being shot at by a superpower? We can run, but we can't hide. This is only a delay, John. It was a mistake to take you along, it was a mistake to come here. He wants me, and not am I only endangering you now, but your entire family!”
John gave Sherlock a gentle kiss on the neck and buried himself closer to him.
"...the tea..."
Sherlock narrowed his eyes as he looked down at the slightly shorter male "Excellent deductions Moriarty" he mocked, stepping slightly closer to John, feeling protective of his solider. He clicked his tongue and rolled his eyes "Childish... you know very well we can afford better, but even people like me have urges which cannot... Wait to be solved" he spoke while the doctor next to him began to have redder and redder cheeks. John shifted slightly and shoved his hands into his pockets, studying the criminal carefully for a moment before pulling out his gun "Id advise you to step back Moriarty, for your own safety" he growled, "Hear me?" He asked, cocking his head to the side as he watched him with caution.
Sherlock sighed: "Yes, because I freed myself and Mycroft from a threat but that's not important now..."
John's lips were met with Sherlock's crashing into them, a force that took him back slightly, but also rivalled his competitive side. He pressed harder against Sherlock's face and closed his eyes to enjoy the sensation. Once again, he ran his fingers into Sherlock's hair, they separated at the Palm to allow room for Sherlock's ear. John loved this, feeling Sherlock's hair with the addition of his fleshy earlobe in between his fingers.
Sherlock couldn't move, not even his face. He was frozen and simply stood there, he didn't know for how long. John, he had... he... had kissed him on the cheek... and it was good! The feeling that had it's centre where his heart was, exciting and warm, started to conquer the rest of his body. He placed the hand where John's lips had been and wondered how such a small gesture could cause him happiness. He slowly looked where John had gone and for one moment he thought about asking for more.
Sherlock was looking forward to this, although he did feel kind of stupid doing this. But maybe that's what love was, just being stupid. It didn't make sense anyway. He didn't want to think now, so he sneaked towards John and when he was next to him, he wrapped his arms around him from behind. "Don't worry, it's just me", he whispered to his ear, before he turned John around and kissed him. Oh how he had needed this. Feeling John's lips on his own, it was fantastic and erased each and every thought except for those naughty ones from his mind. So he lifted John up, pushed him against the wall and kissed him more passionately. Damn, this was good!
"I didn't know back then what you had to look out for!"
“Uh, the.. the plan, yes. Yes of course”, he stuttered, trying to focus and blushing under John's obviously amused looks. How did he manage to knock him out of his stride?
Sherlock watched John getting up and didn't understand why he suddenly did so. Didn't they just have... a moment? Surely he must have misinterpreted that. He sat up on the bed and watched what John was doing.
John sighed. "Here's the thing Sherlock, I'm not the only one that needs protecting. It works both ways. I want to protect you too, but it's not one sided." John said, his words softer now that he had heard the tremble in Sherlock's voice, "I'm not completely helpless, as aren't you, but don't make me feel like I am." John said gently, "Please."
“Doctor Watson... look after him... please?”
"Why did I say it was the drugs? We never thought about the possibility that I was drugged."
"What?" John asked quietly.
"John!", Sherlock shouted as he heard him scream and wince. What was happening? He tried to figure what it was but couldn't, tried to talk to John to know what. it. was. John held his head, an apoplexy? No, he hadn't shown any sign for that before. This... no. No! Then John fell of his chair. "JOHN!", Sherlock could only scream and fell down to his knees next to him, "John, what's going on?! For god's sake, John! Tell me! Talk to me! John!" He was very well aware that John couldn't talk now, but he was helpless. Sherlock wasn't a doctor, he didn't know what to do! He made attempts to help John, to touch him, but he knew that nothing he'd do could work. "HELP!", he screamt through the house, unable to leave John's side.
John chuckled internally, as Sherlock no doubt was sighing in his mind palace. Nonetheless, he kept up appearances for his mum.
Sherlock's chest began to show as the fabric fell away from his skin, and soon his entire front was on show. For a man who never excercised, Sherlock was certainly a far cry from out of shape. His lithe body and long limbs gave him a graceful, almost unearthly look to him, and John couldn't stop himself from lying back and taking him in, from the pointed lips to the slight ripple of muscle at his stomach. He was like a piece of art sculpted by Michelangelo, and he was all his. He forgot about his own shirt, after all, he was too immersed in the pure beauty of Sherlock's physique.
Sherlock didn't know what to do in situations like this... about a loved person that was ill... “Lay down...“, he figured and pulled the blanket back so that John could get into the bed in a better way, “Is there anything I can do? Anything you need?“
She scoffed and rolled her eyes, pulling her lips back into a hiss.
Then Lestrade and his colleagues arrived; they entered through the front door. Sherlock didn't pay attention to who else had joined him.
The kisses came harder now, more passionate and wet. John couldn't do anything but lie back and allow Sherlock to kiss him. He loved this man, beyond words. It frustrated him, the fact that he couldn't put his affection into words, but it relieved him to know that Sherlock felt the same way, he had told him several times before.
Sherlock could feel John's touch and he never wanted him to stop. Him being possessive like this, but protective still, demanding and gentle at the same time. When John ran his hands down on Sherlock sides he could feel himself tremble all over. He blushed and he couldn't remember that he had ever done that before.
“Oh Sherlock!”, I heard a way too familiar voice from upstairs, “You don't really want to open that door, do you?”
John let out a careful breath, cheeks reddening when he thought about what Sherlock had said, a warmth washing through his heart as he kept thinking about it. The male sighed, slowly opening his mouth to speak to the detective with bright eyes, however the detective was already rushing out of the taxi towards the crime scene. The male let out a groan, resting back into the chair briefly before slipping out of the taxi. He passed the money to the driver, nodded his thanks before following Sherlock towards the scene "Hey Sherlock! Please wait for me" he panted slightly, his limp giving him some problems due to how serious his nightmares had been the night before. John soon caught up to him and he reached out, grabbing Sherlocks arm to support himself after rushing towards him. John panted slightly and glanced up at Sherlock, the doctor still holding onto his arm tightly before he realised what he was doing "Ah sorry... best not to do that.... people will talk" he smiled sheepishly at him, meeting eyes with Sherlocks before moving away from him, walking besides him slowly as he followed him to the building.
"I... ", he wanted to say something about his comment, that it wouldn't just go away like that, but he didn't, "I wanted to apologize."
"Someone's eager..." John chuckled, feeling the slight bulge pressing against the inside of his thigh.
"Wait," He said weakly, pointing down to his shoes guiltily, "My shoes...."
"I don't know.. I... I guess I'm thinking that I was drugged again at some point?"
"But, she can't have.... I thought... wh...." John stumbled over his words, eyes looking down in thought.
"C..can I?", he asked, and pulled slightly on John's shirt.
Sherlock pushed him against the wall and he felt his stomach drop with excitement. This was what he wanted. Needed. Thirsted for. Craved. The strong grip of Sherlock's hands fuelled his fire. Their lips locked together again. John ran his hands through his hair, pulling and teasing on Sherlock's dark curls. The detective's hands roamed up his sides towards his neck. John pulled away ever so slightly to pant,
“Can we please go somewhere safe?”, Sherlock asked, barely with any tone in his voice, “I... need you to hold me now.”
That was the clearest thought he could make. Actions were necessary now. So he got up, but walking was still hard to manage.
"No, nno.." John mumbled, raising his hand feebly to wipe away some of the blood from Sherlock's face. He placed his face on the detective's thigh, "No hospitals... Just you and bed..."
“It was poison John... somebody had put some kind of poison into our food and...”
“I'm wide awake”, Sherlock replied, irritated about the contact of his arm and John's hand, but he liked it. He wanted to touch him too in a way, but he had no idea what he should do. He looked at John and tried to think of something, but couldn't figure it out... why were these things so difficult? This situation caught him in a way that he could think of nothing else.
“Okay then. Let's look at this like at a case“, Sherlock said and lifted his hands to take mental notes, “Give me all the facts we have.“
Amelia
After another kiss he said: “But we have to wait with it. Right now we're still fighting, remember? I pushed you away after you kissed me. So, neither of us will return to Baker Street tonight because we fear to meet the other one there. He won't wonder why we're not there and we can stay in the hotel without anybody wondering where we could have gone. Then tomorrow I will return and wait for you in the living room, and we will have our reconciliation. We admit our feelings for each other and... well, stage a little show for Moriarty.”
John took in a slow breath in an attempt to calm himself down, trying to think of somewhere the pair could go that Moriarty would never find them. John scratched at his chin, humming a soft song to himself as he tried to think before blinking, a slightly naughty location popping into his mind. The male hummed and slowly slipped off the bed, making his way towards his bedroom door and pulling it open "Sherlock! Can you come here a second please?!" He called down to him, tapping his foot impatiently against the carpet
John could see Sherlock was thinking about something, hesitating about something maybe? Was it his hand on his arm? What was it? He wanted to ask him, but he was afraid of something like what happened yesterday occurring again. So, he pretended not to see. "Ok... I'm going to get up now." John replied. He rolled over with a small grunt before getting out of the bed in one fluid move. Because they hadn't brought any other clothes, he had gone to sleep in his shirt and trousers, which resulted in him looking rather bedraggled, but there was nothing he could do about that.
But that would never happen. John was with Mary now. And even if he wasn't... he'd never decide for me. He was straight. He had insisted on that so often. And I didn't even know about myself, I only knew that I didn't want to share him with anybody else. I wanted him to be only there for me. If he met other people... he'd probably decide for them and leave me. And the impulses... no.
“See what I can do? I'm still out there, Sherlock!”, now it was only his voice speaking to me, it came from like everywhere, “I know everything about you. I am watching. I've always been watching you. So you better find me, or I'll take away all the things you love. East wind is coming. You should have appreciated the boredom!”
"That's no maybe", Sherlock grinned, looking away though because he tried to act serious, "Your cheeks are really really red. Are we having indecent thoughts?"
“Well, that's true, I suppose...“, Sherlock replied, just to reply at all. This situation was very difficult for him because for once he had to choose his words carefully. He didn't want to hurt John any further.
Yes, yes it was gone. But still Sherlock felt dirty in a way. Not that he minded dirt, he had gone threw way worse sceneries when he had been an addict but... well, this was different. It was human dirt. Still he couldn't help but smile. The way John tried to make him feel better, make him feel safe and comfortable was adorable.
John: *laughs* Why not? You bloody... moron...
“N... nothing“, he lied, being too much into the action to come up with a good alternative and started to kiss John's neck in the hope that he'd forget about it.
He had a knife in his hand. No! Not John!
This was exactly what he had needed. Sherlock didn't think anymore, he just felt. And what he felt was his love for John and the excitement he caused in him. And it was fantastic! The only bad thing was that he had to keep his voice down because of possible other guests of the motel, and because it was kind of embarrassing, showing how much John could really get to him. Sherlock was very sensitive and every new touch was like a firework.
Sherlock was incredibly surprised by the tone John suddenly started to use and watched him for a second, then he did as he was told. It was a really great surprise.
“Just this morning I was called in to arrest some bloke after his neighbor complained he was watering the flowerbeds in her garden.”
The remainder of June thankfully came and went without incident. John returned to work that following Tuesday and made short work of Sarah’s friendly interrogation about the weekend when she cornered him in the clinic’s tiny brake room by the coffee machine.
Perhaps it was his divided attention; allowing a primal reaction to movement, a kneejerk processing of key features that saw ashen blonde hair and a confident stride that made Sherlock’s brain tell him it was John coming towards him when it clearly
The doctor tamped down a sudden bloom in his gut at the thought of encountering Sherlock like that. Like they had been pretending to. Him coursing with barely contained lust. And Sherlock showing up with his prowess and beguiling nature. All cheekbones and mystery. Unlike anyone he’d ever known or would know again for that matter, John was sure of it.
Well I hope you guys enjoyed this as much as I enjoyed writing it. I know it took ages and ended up being longer then I planned but, let's just say I was about as smitten as John was with the idea.
John bursts from sleep like he’s breaching the surface of some fathomless body of water, gasping and attempting to flail but finds his limbs are ensnared. There’s a great weight on him, all over him, holding him down and he rallies against it. Fights it as he tries to process what he’s seeing beyond the strobing of his vision. Black upon churning black.
Beyond the facial trauma, the skin under John’s lower eyelids was shadowed, discolored and sunken from lack of a proper night’s sleep. Overall he looked gaunt. Had he lost weight?
Despite being around so many people, residents and tourists alike, John couldn’t help but feel a lingering loneliness. He
“I’ve never seen such a fat raccoon move so fast.” John snorted, waiting for the mushrooms and shallots to cook down a little more along with some fresh minced garlic. “Then again, you charging at it like a lunatic with a woman’s shoe probably had something to do with it.”
He wasn’t too sure what he was going to do with that just yet.
night. When I first came to see him he was sitting in the lounge staring at map on the wall.”
“Map?” Mycroft asked coolly. Lestrade could almost picture the smallest quirk of a brow.
of the man.
. Planned? Perhaps. Stupid luck? Perhaps. Not in a awesome tin sadly but, author's license.
Just ahead, John spotted a little café at the end of the block and made his way towards it. With the afternoon rush gone, the shop was nearly empty but for a few stragglers. John noted only three patrons as he entered, immediately welcomed by a blast of cold air from the ac unit just above his head. It was enough to send a small shiver through him as he made his way to the counter where two lone baristas cleaned, preparing for after-work crowd to descend in a few hours.
“There’s a lad.” Mrs. Hudson sighed contentedly and shooed him off.
phone sitting right beside it. John’s lungs tightened at the sight.
Getting into Mahir’s good graces had been a bit trickier.
John blinked slowly, trying to parse what the hell that meant. “What happens in—” The doctor had just begun to ask when there was an outburst of cheers.
“I hope it was all worth it Sherlock. I really do.”
Sherlock swallowed thickly and when he spoke again, his previous bravado had receded. “A mutual acquaintance of ours. She—she was integral in forging my coronary report and preparing the stand-in body for mine…”
perfectly well. Sherlock could whip up a psychological profile as easy as penning a grocery list, but it didn’t take a genius to see this was the most anti-Holmes place one could go.

Mahir must have sensed that when he gave it to him. The knowing smile of one addict to another as he slipped a white envelop into Sherlock’s hand along with a business card.
“Harriet?”, he asked into the room when he arrived downstairs, “Harriet, you forgot to tell us which room we can use.”
"It's ok, you idiot." He said lovingly as he started to move forward again.
John sighed, allowing himself to hang back as Sherlock entered the building. John studied the males back and nodded, a smile growing on his lips "I suppose they do..." he muttered, allowing his eyes to close for a moment to allow his racing heart to calm down before he rushed forwards, making his way into the building after him. John hummed happily as he made his way through the hospital, thinking over the relationship he actually has with Sherlock. They were definitely friends, they had there... slight intimate moments and intense minutes but he knew that they would never be more. He knew he didnt exactly help himself by saying constantly that he wasnt gay. But he wasnt sure as to whether Sherlock had realised that he was infact bi sexual... he had never brought a man home, but he'd had 2 male lovers since joining homes with Sherlock, mostly to try and get over his feelings for the tall detective.
, serial killer raccoons.” John answered as gravely as he could manage.
No matter what strange or plausible thread the doctor perused, they all had one thing in common. Sherlock was out there doing what he always did. He was helping people.
Most packages of any size—unless verbally cleared by him—were thoroughly scanned before they even came within radius of him, let alone the same room. And none save for mail from his immediate family was ever sent to
Four pushpins and a lot of smoothing later, John had the map spread over the black and grey floral wallpaper, admiring it for a second or two before scavenging for several more pins from a drawer in the kitchen.
John wandered the starkly lit Tesco, drifting from isle to isle, passing row upon row of neatly arranged boxes, cans, and bags in the hope of inspiring some ideas for tonight’s dinner. Though at the moment, the only items in the doctor’s basket were a loaf of bread and a box of his favorite custard cream biscuits. And regardless of social acceptances, toast and biscuits did
After a glance at his watch, he pulled up one window containing video feeds from the lobby’s security cameras, three in all: one trained on the main entrance, another at the archway to the bar, and the third overviewing the front desk. That one in particular revealed an agitated Mme. B-Something fuming by her mound of luggage and a hand cradled up by her ear.

“Sherlock.” Greg welcomed him. “Nice rack.” He added good-humoredly, nodding towards the antlers adorning the detective’s head as he presented his hand.
“No…that one’s far too sweet. The flavor will be all wrong.”

Sherlock seemed to consider the question before smirking over his shoulder. “
’, though it was hard to tell with the competition of his pulse coursing in his ears. However a second or two later Sherlock lay down to the right of him, one leg crossing and stretching out alongside his own, leaving the hand between John’s thighs to move freely. Putting the most delicious pressure against the tight swell of his sac, now pinned beneath Sherlock’s wrist.
.” He pulled easily from John’s grip. “It’s what you came here to do after all.” And with that he slipped into the fray of guests, antlers jutting majestically from his curls.
John looked around the confines of the car, discovering they were essentially now alone. It hadn’t struck him until just then what a rare occurrence this really was. Any time previously that John was summoned into Mycroft’s presence, it had been through one of his PAs. Mainly Anthea—or whatever her actual name was. Really the only other times he’d seen the man travel personally was to pay a visit to Sherlock.
The doctor’s face went slack and John quickly looked to his watch and not only saw the date but the time as well. He screwed it up with a tisk, cursing softly. When he looked back up to Lestrade it was with remorse. “I’m sorry mate, I…I forgot.”
Well…
“No you won’t.”
“John…thank you.”
Sherlock gave a troubled hum. “Serious then. You’ve met him?”
it. He’d liked the quiet part of Sherlock who puttered for hours in the kitchen running experiments on things—though maybe not John’s things. And maybe not the experiments that resulted in them having to evacuate the flat and call the fire department
It wasn’t until late that afternoon that an opportunity presented itself in a very displeased Mahir.
?” Sherlock supplemented making him snort lightly.
Lucy meanwhile was absolutely radiant as she began talking with one of her coworkers, smiling a little bashfully. John caught more than one shared glance between the two and their proximity never ventured farther than a few inches.
(See the end of the chapter for
are we talking about?”
Before John knew it he was dropping his keys on the kitchen table, not quite recalling having passed the darkened front windows of Speedy’s nor apparently springing up the stairs to the flat.
Sherlock gave a soft huff. “Afraid not. But, considering I have—
much of a challenge.” The doctor added thoughtfully. “She looked about ready to crawl out of her own skin if she had half the chance.”
Lugging his suitcase to the desk John was greeted by a very pleasant young woman and a very disinterested young man leaning up against a door marked ‘Employees Only’, puttering on his mobile phone.
Placing the phone gingerly atop his mystery anthology, John summoned the energy to get up and switch the lamp off. Suddenly blanketed in darkness, John cautiously made his way back towards the sofa, weary to not nail a shin on the coffee table. As he rounded the side of it, the doctor found himself pausing and looking over to stare into the kitchen and as far down the hallway beyond as he could. He couldn't see the door to Sherlock's room at all from here, even as his eyes began to adjust.
John cleared his throat and slouched further down until his neck met the cool softness of his pillow and the back of his head rested on the armrest. He switched the mobile from his left hand to his right so he could prop his elbow on the crook where the arm met the back of the couch. He thought back on those first endless feeling weeks, living alone in that tomb of a bedsit.
