He quickly sent the message to Nat not to worry. He got him. It will be fine.
There was a slight pause on the other side before Steve´s heart missed a beat.
“What about my face and my lips?”
“Well, you kinda was,” Steve said apologetically, taking one of Tony´s wrists in his hand inspecting the bruises forming there. “I should have been more gentle.”
“Isn’t it a bit odd that Mr. Stark approached everyone from his friends tonight, and to most of them he said the words that had been left unspoken between them? What did he say to you? Didn’t it sound like he was giving you a goodbye? Because to me it sounded pretty much like that.”
“No, it was a week ago. You remember Hulk falling into the river and me trying to pull him back to the shore?”
“So let´s say he didn´t mean to, but he was scared and all… Don´t tell Bruce, okay?”
So like that they started to bump into each other on and off the streets of New York. Usually when Iron man stroke it wasn´t in the states and therefore they were always late. But sometimes they met also in the city, especially when there was a big threat and big fight, where he could come, help and go into hiding again as fast as possible. And despite Fury´s protests Steve found a way how to make him cooperate, how to even work with him side by side, how to make him listen to the orders at least to some point.
“Please, just tonight. You remember that story? A Thousand and One Nights? I told you about it once.”
“Hey, ughm, sorry, I… will be on my way out…” At first Steve didn´t recognize the voice. He only knew that someone had to open the door they hadn´t locked and maybe that person didn´t even recognize them, but then a sudden sharp inhale interrupted all of Steve´s thoughts and he let go of Tony´s lips to glance at the intruder.
“I see it.”
“Where did he go?”
“He wants us to catch you, but he never told us to kill you. He still wants you to join, right?”
“Fury has your number?” Steve asked, but didn´t receive a reply as Tony picked up the phone in the same time.
“Yes, sir,” was AI´s answer to the order and in a next second Steve was free to move. Still he stayed in the same position for a moment, just to be sure that Tony really left the room. He didn´t want to spoil it – it, whatever was going on between them. After that he put away the cloth from his eyes, blinking and adjusting around the room.
And maybe there were some dead threats uttered between that reply until Tony cancelled the call, but neither Steve nor Tony commented on it.
“That’s bullshit.”
“Tony, what are you seeing there?” Steve asked, turning back and forth, making sure there really is nothing creeping on them.
Someone, probably Natasha sucked the air through her lips, it almost sounded like a wince, but Steve didn´t look away. He just shifted uncomfortably on the couch where he and his team were seated.
Their first meeting after the kidnapping incident was once more not under the pleasant circumstances, but this time Steve felt prepared for that option or at least he thought so.
Tony was hesitating for a long time, but then he offered the weapon and Steve cheered inside. Something in Tony trusted him deeply even when the man himself wasn´t in the right state of mind.
“Tony, you’re okay?” he asked, worried.
“Who?” he decided to play dumb, finding out what director knew and what he could hide.
Steve started pacing around the room, listening for any signs that Tony was in trouble and needed to have him on his feet immediately.
“Captain, let me introduce to you Anthony Stark, the CEO of Stark Industries and currently also SHIELD´s new weapon´s specialist for your team,” Fury stated flatly, but with something funny in his voice. There was a hint of a joke between the lines, but Steve didn´t really pay attention to that. Not when he finally heard the name he yearned to know for such a long time and his eyes fell on Tony´s lips pronouncing Steve´s name in response. Steve had literally no idea how Tony managed it to sound so dirty.
Steve´s brows went up when the word “we” was uttered, but it probably remained unnoticed. He liked that word a lot, more so when it came from the guy.
He returned back to present, shaking his head. “Steve,” he said. It was impossible not to return the smile now.
“Sorry, I didn´t mean to aim it into your eyes.” The other man chuckled. Steve was confused.
Few hours which felt like 10 years.
“Yes. I´m fine, cap.”
Steve laughed, but stayed hesitantly quiet afterwards. There was something on his mind, but he didn´t know how to say it. He hated the fact he needed to talk about it at all.
As he hanged up, Tony looked up at him. “A night,” Steve said, “you need to stay the night.”
They didn´t agreed on the terms of next meeting, but Steve didn´t doubt there will be one and soon.
“And then the prince began his journey. He had to fight a lot of monsters in order to get to his princess. But his bold stallion Jarvis helped him. He never left him in trouble and together they saved the princess out of the tower.”
“And you would like to know why he doesn´t send some ninjas to kick my ass in the shower when I put the suit in the closest.”
“Why?”
Thank you very much for any reviews you might leave here! They make me really happy and encourage me to write more. :)
The breath got stuck within Steve´s lungs, but he still tried to shake the panic off as fast as he could.
“It was a terrible night,” he admitted, pressing the heels of his palms into his tired eyes. He started remembering and chills creeped back on his back.
A hope seized Steve´s heart.
By that time Steve was full of scratches and few good hits landed on various parts of his body, but what was more important, Tony was bleeding again. It was priority to fix that problem first and while doing so, Steve politely declined an apology coming from the man.
Quickly Steve stripped of the shirt and sweatpants he wore to retrieve the forgotten kit. He stepped into the warm steam that spilled through the entrance, chasing away the chill and honing in his mind. The marks were worse upon closer inspection, some breaking skin and leaving dried blood behind. There were fingerprint bruises along Tony’s hips that were still developing from a sickly yellow shade. If Tony wanted rough, then Steve was going to give it to him.
Metal crashed to the wooden floor as Tony stood to free his burning length from the confinements of wet cotton. The hole isn’t at a perfect height, Tony has to bend his knees a bit to guide his cock through.
They’ve been talking about slowing down for a while now, maybe buying some land far away from it all. Starting a family has always been Steve’s dream and with him Toni has started to dream of it too. So after a few months of failed pregnancy attempts, the idea was hatched to have a long weekend dedicated to making their dreams come true. Toni called it a sexcation and Steve wrinkled his nose at that. Tomato, potato.
The doctor sets the tablet down then faces Steve, “That all sounds good, Steve. Since this is your first visit to an omega specialist, we’ll do a standard exam where I check your chest, male genitalia, and canal. As long as everything looks normal then we’ll get your IUD inserted. Sound good?” Steve nods a quick approval. “Alright, lay back for me.”
Maria kissed him on the cheek and gave Father Rogers one last hug before filing out. They fell into their usual routine after Mass, cleaning the church and chatting about their weeks. Steve asked how Tony felt about moving to California to start at his father’s company and Tony countered with questions about the Dodgers season just to see Steve get worked up.
Steve’s instructed to wiggle down the table until he’s sure he will fall ass first into the floor, but Tony is there guiding calf-like limbs into the metal arms. The sheet is repositioned to provide him with some form of modesty while being virtually exposed to the room.
“Oh wow! Look at this place.” Steve looked at the house in awe as they got out of the car. The getaway had been his idea, they hadn’t taken a trip together since their honeymoon. This weekend was an opportunity to focus on the future. Their future.
“Yes.” It’s barely over a whisper, but Tony hears nonetheless.
Tony was distracted, he was singing and wouldn’t be paying attention to what was behind him. The walk in shower was to the right of the doorway and the vanity dead ahead. Tony wouldn’t be able to see him through the tiled wall that separated the shower from the rest of the bathroom and if Tony did finish, then Steve would hear the water turn off and have 5 seconds to get out. All he had to do was walk a straight line in and then out. Master tactician.
A couple of fingers found the tingling nub at the top of her cunt, rubbing in circles as Steve’s hips continued to spasm through his orgasm. The motion kept her walls tightening, milking the cock inside for all it’s seed and bringing her closer to coming again.
Tony begins, “I have lust in my heart, I’ve been fantasizing of this person for months now. I’ve been thinking about them constantly and being close to them has caused me to find oulets to let out this feeling, to fuck other people.”
If the moans spilling from Tony’s mouth were anything to go by, then he was loving this. When Tony turned his head, looking for a kiss, Steve guided him face first into the tiles facing the other way. “Yes, fuck baby, just like that.” Tony whimpered.
The fingers return, but this time at the edge of his chest. They swiftly dance down to his rib then start again slightly inward and make their way down. Steve’s blush intensifies as Dr. Stark makes his way closer to his nipple. But the digits skip over it and continue down his chest. “Just checking for any lumps or hard spots. You should perform this assessment on yourself every month in case anything new pops up. Steve, you okay?”
It had been a week since his last trim and the new growth was driving Steve crazy. It was itchy, constantly tickling under his nose, and it was so hot underneath that it caused him to sweat profusely during daily workout sessions. He had tried to drag himself to a barber shop, but the thought of having a stranger with a blade to his throat spiked Steve’s anxiety. This was nuts, why was he living like a cave man when he could just walk up stairs and get his kit?
How had enough time passed for Howard to get married, have a kid, and he still looked older than Steve? The peppering of a few silver strands and laugh lines gave him this air of authority, of experience, that sent jolts of electricity through Steve’s body. He may know what this feeling is, lust, but he has no idea what to do with it in this strange, modern world. Maybe that’s why Steve pulls Tony’s pigtails, just to see him get riled up.
“Steve? Steve is that y-what the fuck do you think you’re doing? Get off of me, you fucker. You fucking bastard.”
“That was the point. Guess it didn’t work, huh,” Dr. Stark chuckles. “Also, call me Tony. Sir makes me feel old,” he says as those delicious fingers repeat the process on his other breast. Steve is proud that this time he doesn’t react when Tony touches the tender peak. That doesn’t stop his cock from leaking a bit of precum at the sensation.
The results were in: Father Rogers wanted him. He lusted after Tony.
“You’re going to ravish me? Are we in a Victorian novel? Should I put on a white nightgown and start calling for you in the moors?”
Steve stares at it, plagued by thought of walking the three steps inside. That sounds about as appealing as filing taxes or traveling cross country on a unicycle, but he’s already stood here long enough for the elevator to come and go twice. Any longer and he’ll miss the appointment, but would that be a blessing instead? He steps into the lift and hits the button for the 9th floor.
The next moment Steve has his arms around Toni and is lifting her out of the chair. It’s a primitive display of strength, but the act sends sparks of hot arousal through her groin spreading wetness.
Steve takes a few deep breaths through his nose before answering, “I’m fine. I can do this all day.”
The heaviness of the conversation was starting to weigh on both of them, what was supposed to be a happy weekend had taken a drastic somber turn. This weekend was about dreams coming true, not focusing on lives not lived. “Well, I’d suggest let’s go get started on that dream, but some one insisted that we eat first. What’s taking so long? Did you go kill the chicken yourself?”
They heard him and the one with dark long hair nodded. He recognized her as the one who´d urged her colleague to start crawling away earlier. Together they hurried to the window. By the time they got there, Iron man was already floating in front of the opening.
His hands stopped working for a moment and Steve had a feeling that the man was surprised by his question.
Steve wanted to see him so badly. Not only his body without the armor. But also his face, his eyes, his lips especially when he could hear him snickering. And for a second he thought about asking him, but then he stopped himself. If he knew and wouldn´t tell Fury that would be a direct break of order. Still…
“You said you loved me.”
“Tony?” he tried again, this time louder, forcefully drawing his thoughts back to the present. He looked around the room pulling the blanket away and crawling out of the warm bed. The bathroom door was closed and looked like there was no one inside, so Steve walked past it into the kitchen.
“I kissed that face so many times that I would know.”
It was quite simple. After he´d heard the man speak to him and felt his lips on his, everything had to become too real for him.
“Don´t look at me. I wasn´t following you. We have a deal, don´t we?” There was a doubt and a question in her eyes.
Nothing has changed on the man´s face, only more emotions settled in his stare. “I´m quite irresistible,” he joked, but then he became serious again. “Me too, Steve. Actually, I’ve been in love with you for some time. That´s why I´m trying to get my life together, to have a future, where you wouldn´t have to fight me.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“You didn´t think it through, right?”
“Oh,” Tony sounded seriously surprised, “and here I thought she liked me.”
“Captain, report, Steve!” there was a voice, which he heard now, which had to be there all the time, but suppressed under the fire.
“Good night, Morgan,” Tony whispered while both of them moved toward the doors.
Steve just tried to find the right words, any words.
“Maybe, Steve. But honestly… I’m so tired.”
Morgan nodded again, her eyelids closing the first thing the light was switched off.
Steve started to shake his head.
Tony and Steve departed to their own bedroom where they shed their clothes off and cuddled together under the warm blanket. Tony purred when Steve snuggled to him and put a hand over his hips.
Talking to cameras. Watching his every move and word in front of all those lurking reporters, who were officially allowed to show on the gala, and therefore, make his life miserable. At least for few more hours until he could vanish and have a long, long shower and even longer sleep in the clean sheets.
And that was not fair. Because he had a whole team of people relying on his leadership. He tried to remind himself that Iron man survived without him for years and that he knew what he was doing, at least the half of the time. But the other half of their missions it was Tony flying into every possible danger Steve could think about. And that was not really helping with Steve´s multitasking.
“Captain,” Strange replied, clearing his throat like there was something bothering him.
Our heroes keep on meeting and getting to know each other, but it´s only a matter of time until their pink bubble burst.
Steve’s fingers automatically sank deeper into Tony’s suit and Cloak also tightened its embrace.
There was a short pause. “Not much. I´m on my way. Get to that window.”
“Okay,” Tony answered breathlessly and suddenly they were both up their feet, drawing each other inside. Steve lost the majority of his clothes on the way to the bed, letting Tony throwing them away like they offended him in some way. By this time they were pretty much used to move around very low light or none at all, so there was no need to split even for a second.
Something in Tony’s eyes made his heart crack. The engineer placed his cold hand on Steve’s.
My first story I´ve managed to finish! :P Thank you all for being here, supporting me, giving me the energy to continue and motivation to get better. I hope you are satisfied with the ending. I will be very, very happy for any response from you. :) Would you like another story with secret identities? Let me know!
“Wow, better no one heard that, Legolas, taxpayers would be devasted by your pyrotechnic suggestion.”
“Fury knows,” he stated simply and Tony made an agreeing noise.
A knife, probably from the kitchen.
“It powers the suit, but you had to figure this already,” Tony ignored Steve´s offer. “I didn´t want you to see because… well, first of all it looks awful.”
“Is he with you?”
They fell asleep in each other’s arms both of them remembering all the memories Tony had shared with Steve until now. The life they had here was even more magic than the one Tony had lived through.
Tony got several more hallucinations and each time his reaction was more violent than before. He screamed and trashed and fought Steve with everything he had. Despite the fact that it was breaking Steve´s heart, he was holding him down against his will until it stopped completely and his eyes cleared once again.
“And you have full lips, sweet and soft and soooo skillful,” he added, now sending Tony into series of amused chuckled noises.
“Jarvis, is there anyone who can take care of Iron man here? Any paramedic? Doctor?”
“But the princess wasn’t really nice. The prince found out that they didn’t really match. Saddened and with a broken heart he decided to return to his own kingdom when suddenly…”
“May I speak with you in private?”
Steve threw himself on the chair watching Tony´s hands placing the glasses on the table and pouring the red liquid in both of them. Involuntary he recalled where those hands were just few minutes ago and prayed to god, he won´t start blushing. He expected them to be hard as he knew Iron man was designing and building the suits on his own, but what surprised him was how many scares and burns lingered upon the skin. Then he caught a glimpse of the red and gold metal and the smile disappeared from his face.
“I figured out like three seconds ago, cap.” He detected a humor in the response despite the machine-sound modification successfully hiding a lot of emotions from the words.
“Okay, Daddy.”
“Doctor,” he greeted the man and took a sip from his beer.
“Yes, Steve, for as long as I needed you to.”
Steve looked at Tony alarmed.
“You know I love you too, honeybear, just watch your heartrate. No. And no. I don´t think that´s the best idea. I heard you talking about being an aggressive prick or just aggressive, so I´m going home. JARVIS can handle me.”
“I would prefer a meeting without Fury knowing.”
“That´s not funny, Tony,” Steve reminded him, “Natasha is loyal to me, but she is also a SHIELD´s agent. I can´t ask her to lie for me forever.” But what was the other option? Stop meeting? No, that wasn´t an option, or was it?
Steve was taking five stairs at the time, stopping only when he hit the door on Tony’s floor. They didn’t open for him just as Friday had said. He braced himself and started to punch the glass. It was thick and strong, ready to stop supersoldiers, maybe even gods, but not combined power of said supersoldier and a very old magic artefact. Steve would swear that Cloak gave him a snort when he glanced at it admirably.
“Let me at least tie it for you.”
Tony offered his hand without blinking and he looked nervous for few seconds probably because he couldn´t be sure of the reason for Steve´s stunned reaction.
“No,” Steve almost yelled.
Tony and Steve exchanged a look.
“I have a place for three, cap,” the voice replied promptly.
“Do you want me to call you? Because you know… I´ve never asked you. I´ve just given you a phone and expected this will be enough for a while, but I know it´s not.”
Iron man let his hands slide down Steve´s neck and that made him slightly shiver.
Once more Avengers had become a sensation. The re-united group of superheroes who had put aside the grudge held against each other and saved the world from Thanos – that still seemed not to be enough for the headlines of some newspapers. People wanted stories and insight, but they received neither when Tony Stark, Iron Man, had decided not to share what happened – and what only he knew about - with anyone.
“Steve…” Tony called out again and he could see the lines of the man´s hand trying to find him. He caught the cold fingers and stilled when he felt something warm and sticky covering them.
Steve froze and looked at Tony for help. He didn´t give him an answer.
“She likes you,” Steve corrected his statement, “she just thinks we are going to get burned on this.”
“Don’t expect me to jump in front of you. I wouldn’t do that to you.”
“I´m not letting him die.”
He was now hyper-aware that those were actual fingers and not gloves. For a moment Steve imagined how it would feel if he could reach out and find Iron man´s face, hair and shoulders instead of the cold metal. Because all of those had to be right in front of him.
From many inappropriate responses and ideas Steve picked the least craziest.
There was a brief second of recognition in man´s eyes and in a next moment a set of bullets were fired in Steve´s way, all of them ending in his shield forcing him to take cover.
There was certain amount of angry shouting during which Tony had to put the cell phone away from his ear and Steve chuckled.
Steve smiled. “You have nice cheekbones, not very prominent, and strong jaw, and mustache, it always tickles me.”
It seemed like it was forever since Iron man had taken off and somehow he knew he won´t make it in time.
The whole scene was very disturbing, but Steve didn´t dare to move an inch, at least not until Tony came back to him almost fifteen minutes later and asked him with wide, confused eyes why they were on the floor. After that question, Steve only smiled and said he had a hallucination of a sort and that it was alright. They went back to bed. Only few minutes later a true hell began.
“Tony,” he couldn´t fight the harsh tone in his own voice. If he was in a danger, there was no time for this.
“So you´re saying I´ve just walked into the trap? Hell, I forgot the suit…”
Steve could see it now.
“Just jump. I can see him. He´s coming for you.”
Steve tried to keep check of Iron man´s position in the room. He had the feeling that he was walking towards the door.
When it finally happened, Steve almost passed the opportunity only staring on the ringing device in disbelief. His hand trembled when he picked up.
“Tony, please, tell me what´s wrong.”
“Hey, my favorite one-eyed director, how is the life going?”
“Okay, cap, the guy is kinda hot, but you have a fucking boyfriend, so please just go with me right now or you will regret this in the morning.”
Don´t forget to like, dislike, subscribe, comment. Make my soul shudder with happiness. Please, subscribe here as well, so you get updates. :)
Steve didn´t even dare to breath. “What´s wrong? Tony?”
“Jarvis…” Steve tried to remember, “is it the one Jarvis you are talking to during the missions? Is it your…”
Steve lapped at the slit as five long ropes shot off into his mouth. They stayed like that, with Steve heavy panting and Tony gentle encouragement, until he let loose a long, deep moan and Tony knew he had came.
First thing he notices is that lights are softer in the office than the hard fluorescent lights throughout the rest of the hospital. Vases of fake flowers decorate the end tables next to plushy chairs in an immaculate waiting area. It’s a shocking contrast to the hard, wooden chairs and empty surfaces that litter the ER waiting room.
This was her last chance and it didn’t work. Dr. Cho kept saying to try IVF next, but they both knew it wouldn’t work with her fucked up uterus. Even if she could get pregnant, the chances of her carrying to term were slim to none. Also, Steve would have to know for IVF and that couldn’t happen.
Steve’s mouth left wet, sloppy kisses along her neck, biting, teasing her clavicle. A throaty moan slipped out as she pulled at the blond strands, trying to navigate the hot mouth lower towards a tender breast. The stupid shirt is blocking the path of his mouth, so she yanked at the sleeves until it was on the floor.
Tony was gone before Steve could even stand up to stop him.
Toni chuckled as she wrapped her arms around Steve’s neck, “I think it’s going to be a while before the baby can play on a swing set. First there has to be a baby, so why don’t we make our way back upstairs and get started on that.” She started trailing kisses along his jaw up to his ear, licking at the sensitive spot behind it.
Steve debated sending Tony a quick text, asking if it was ok before just walking into Tony’s space. But they had left everything on good terms, Tony even said that if Steve ever needed anything to not hesitate. Beside it was almost noon now, Tony was probably at SI or in the workshop and would be none the wiser to Steve’s quick trip. He’d be in and out before even JARVIS would know.
This weekend, their weekend, has been planned for months. They told no one where they were going to not be distrubed and told the team only to call if Thanos himself showed up. Other than that, there was to be no interference of any sort. Just her and Steve and a beautiful cabin in the woods.
The pained noise sounded like it was ripped from Tony’s chest absentmindedly. “That’s all you have to say? I just confessed that I’m basically addicted to you and that’s your reaction. Nevermind, it doesn’t matter.” Tony stood and marched to the door, “This was the last time, we’re done here. Pepper’s starting to get suspicious and I can’t lose her or Morgan. I can’t lose the best thing that’s ever happened to me, especially not because of you.”
Steve rolled his eyes, “Well, that doesn’t sound very productive given that I’m right here. Come help me cut up the broccoli.”
Fuck.
“Ty, baby, come join me. Last night was amazing, how about an encore?” Tony called over his shoulder.
Steve slowly sits up on the table, using the tattered remains of the gown to maintain some shred of decency in this humiliating situation. Dr. Stark must do this with all his nervous patients. How stupid is Steve for thinking this was unique? He must have made Dr. Stark uncomfortable when he came calling his name.
Steve ached to reach down and give his neglected cock some needed attention, even to squeeze the base to starve off the growing urge to come. But Tony told him not to move and he would never be allowed his orgasm if he moved from where he was placed. Just the thought of a hand on his cock was enough to ratchet his need higher.
After that it was an experiment of how far he could push Steve before he would pull back, like some game of gay chicken. It started with more tight pants, loosening extra buttons after services on his shirts, discussing sexual encounters during confessionals to see Steve blush afterwards with the grand finale of this experiment occuring today.
Steve let out the breath he had been holding since he entered, “I’d say you are using the weather as a distraction instead of talking about the five hundred things we could be talking about.”
Not Jesus, but Father Rogers.
“Get on all fours. Show me how much you want my cock, baby.” he commanded. After a few labored breaths, Toni pushed over on shaking elbows and clambered onto her knees, ass up head down. Over her shoulder she could see the broad expanse of a tone, chiseled chest and one large hand stroking at his long, thick dick waiting to breach her waiting body.
Just hearing that word out of Tony’s mouth sent spikes of heat through Steve’s groin. When they were together originally, they found out pretty early on that Steve loved giving up control to Tony. They figured out what worked for them and it was Steve calling Tony ‘Sir’ and Tony giving Steve easy commands. But one night, after hours of being kept on edge, the first ‘Daddy’ slipped out. Tony loved it, played into it, but Steve was mortified and couldn’t look Tony in the eye after. So in typical Steve fashion, he took on a week long mission the next day to avoid acknowledging what had happened.
Dr. Stark looks up from the tablet, “And how have your heats been since coming off the implant? Anything unusual that you didn’t experience before?”
Tony has reached inside him and is pulling the orgasm out of him. Tears prickle at the edges of his vision, the desire to find release evading him. He is so close to tumbling over the edge, but it still feels out of his reach. The fire is so close to over taking him, but he keeps running.
Steve held her narrow waist, pulling her body back to meet him until they bottomed out. God, Toni was full, it felt like length went all the way into her stomach. All attempts at grinding her ass against Steve were halted when he pulled back, leaving only the head inside.
Tony and Steve had called it quits after three years of dating and two living in the penthouse together. They had tried to make it work, they really did, but individually they had too many issues that prevented them from truly being together. The split was amicable, both knowing that someday they might find their way back together once they had healed their broken pieces. They left it as friends.
Tony dropped to his knees coming face to face with a debounced picture. Steve was sitting back on his heels with his pants open and spent cock between his thighs. His mouth looked ruined, all red and bruised, and it was no secret what he had been up to. He looked like sin personified.
Tony Stark is not a patient man. Some would say genius, the most gifted mind of the generation, or handsome, possessing looks that would make Helen of Troy weep.  Even kind had been utter on a rare occasion when he was able to demonstrate good will towards mankind. Patient was not on that list, if it knocked on the door of the list it would be shot down. But here he was kneeling at the altar in a quaint Catholic church gazing up at the most beautiful man he had ever seen.
He looked up from the sketch he was working on, a hummingbird drinking from a feeder, his pupils blown wide, “Yeah, you want me to put a baby in you?”
The notification is for the results of her latest lab work, an update on the treatment. When they had struggled conceiving quickly, Dr. Cho recommended that they both went through screenings for health factors and to pinpoint the issue. Steve cried when his results came back with a clean bill of reproductive health. Toni checked to make sure that Steve was still downstairs before opening the email.
They make lunch together, sauteing and chopping in relative silence. Once Tony has finished helping, let’s be honest she can only do so much in the kitchen before she burns something, she takes a seat at the bar to watch Steve. “Tell me about your mother again.”
After service, Father Rogers would discard the robe and turn into “just Steve”. He’d tell Tony stories about his life and travels while they cleaned and in return Tony would ramble about his latest creations and the woses of university life. That’s how it continued until Tony caught Steve staring at his ass in some sinfully tight pants one afternoon.
“Maybe we should start the trip with a skinny dip in the lake.” Toni suggested, seductively.
He couldn’t resist leaning forward hoping Steve caught on and met him through the opening. Lips met in slow tandium, tongues exploring every cavity, Tony chasing the taste of his come in Steve mouth.
Tony peered through the grate separating them, a small square about six inches wide that comes to his chest when he sits in the short chair. Steve was bent over, head in his hands, the internal battle shown by tension in his shoulders.
Lips joined the tongue in pursuit of more slick until they found her opening. Together the muscles sucked and licked in harmony until all the juice was gone from the opening, then fingers made an entrance. Fingers could coax out more ambrosia by teasing the spot inside. Lips sought out the external joy spot, a red hot button of sensation that would provide the ultimate treat.
The thin digit starts to retreat after a few inches before filling him up once again, a gentle rhythm of in and out until Steve is relaxed enough to loosen. Soon a second finger joins the first and Steve sees fireworks behind his eyes. This is the most pleasure he has ever had from his body, nothing with a partner has amounted to this much gratification.
Just a few more pumps of his hips and Steve is spilling his come deep in Tony’s bowels, filling him full of hot, thick semen. He did it, he showed Tony what he was made of, that he was the man that Tony never thought he could be.
The long strokes felt like adding wood to a fire, only achieving a larger, longer burn. It would continue until they both were consumed with the heat, warm inside and out. Toni whimpered as Steve found his pace, tiring of the too little friction.
Tony took a deep breath, he’d been planning this for months, “Forgive me Father for I have sinned.” Here goes nothing.
He let out a breath he didn’t know he was holding, the fear bleeding out of him. Steve wants him, it was just his hormone rattled brain making things up. This gorgeous, smart man desires him. “Good, that’s great Steve. Let me show you what you do to me.”
“Ty, you still here baby? I thought you would have left by now.”
“Steve Rogers.”
Eventually the church doors opened and footsteps tracked the movement of the intruder. “Tony?” Jarvis called out. Their time was up. California awaited, family and responsibilities lied just outside of those doors. Steve was right, you can always find beauty even in tragic endings.
“You saw me take it out of the fridge, that makes no sense.” It might have not been logical, but it brought a silly smile to Steve’s face so it made sense to her. She’d do anything to put a smile on Steve’s face. “It’s almost done. God, you’re impatient.”
Tony finally met his eye, “After everything you did, I still come back to you. You broke my heart, physically and emotionally, and I keep crawling back. Did you really believe it was just about sex for me, Steve? If I wanted to be called Daddy in bed, then I could have asked my wife. No I’m here, because even after everything you did, I still love you.” He took a deep breath before continuing, “I shouldn’t love you, you don’t deserve my affection, but I can’t let you go. So here I am.”
“Steve, I see you and I want you too. God, do you know what you do to me? I’ve been driving myself wild thinking about your eyes on me, I’ve came dozens of times with your name on my lips to the thought that you want me. Do you Steve? Do you want me?” Tony is careful to leave all talk of religion and faith out of this, not wanting to spook him with a reminder of where they were or how messed up it all was.
After that, he dove head first into making the world safe where he could and gave up every dream of going home. There was no home left anyway. Everything was a blur from the moment, even the battle was just a fuzzy memory. The only thing that was crystal clear was seeing Tony stumble down the ramp of a ramshackled spaceship, looking destroyed, but still so handsome in his agony. Pepper raced past him and Tony fell into the arms of his loving fiance.
Sarah Rogers instilled a health appreciation of the medical field from the time Steve was born. When he wasn’t there for a doctor’s visit, he was drawing in the breakroom and playing with his friends on the children’s ward.
The pace quickened.
As his orgasm approached, Steve fell forward until he was curved against Toni’s back. This new angle did find her g-spot, the heavy cock brushing it on every stroke. He kissed the length of her neck, twisting until their lips met in a messy clash of teeth over her shoulder. Sweat dropped from his forehead, the liquid sliding down the pale expanse of back.
Today was a good day.
He lets out a small chuckle, “Sorry, having sex with other people. But I think this other person wants me too.”
Which leads to Tony gazing up at Father Rogers during his homily with pink, bitten lips and a slack jaw, looking the picture of innocence. Tony usually spent most of the service kneeling at the front like any good “altar boy”. Sometimes Steve would get so involved with his sermon that he would move from behind the pulpit, getting closer to his congregation, and to Tony. If he was lucky, their eyes would meet for a moment and he would get one of those all American, apple pie smiles.
He set the kit down on the counter, he’d grab it on his way out, then made his way over to the entrance of the walk in shower. Honestly, he missed this shower, it had always been the best relief after a long day and sore muscles. But the modest glass shower in his suite was more than generous by his standards.
The fingers speed up, “Are you baby? Are you going to come on my cock? Just like that, keep squeezing that pussy. Fuck!”
“Back then you’d know if you were going steady with someone. There would have been a conversation and...and,” Steve hesitated for a moment. “And there would be kissing.”
Without missing a beat, “Your boobs.”
Steve softly pushed the door until it was wide enough to slip through silently, all the SHIELD training leading to this moment. His soft steps were drowned out by the water blasting against tiles. The drawer softly clicked open and Steve held his breath, thinking Tony heard that, but nonetheless he was still safe and the kit sat in the same place it always had.
By the time she finished exploring the house, Steve was coming down from the upstairs, “Isn’t this place incredible? I can just imagine us coming back here with the kids. We could spend the day playing in the lake teaching them to swim or hiking the trails. I think I saw a play set out back.”
Toni closed her eyes, hoping to catch a quick nap after that workout, when the tablet on the side table pipes up. Steve must have gotten out when he carried the bags up, he knew she’d be lazy to get it out after settling in for bed.
The speculum widens his opening and discomfort starts to seep in. He feels exposed more now than he ever did in the army. In the army there weren't attractive, kind alphas that had an all exclusive show to Steve descent into a sexual awakening. Tony readys a few tools from the tray, arranging them inside of Steve for insertion. Then Tony looks at him with darkening eyes and begins to fervently tug at his hardened cock.
“Are we dating? Clint mentioned that what we do classifies as dating nowadays. The dinners and the art museum and all the time we spend together.”
No, Steve could never know. He would never find out.
Steve made an affirmative noise through the wall. “Perfect, baby. Can you touch yourself for me?” Another positive noise, Steve must be too shy over this to use his voice. “Okay. Suck the tip and keep touching yourself ‘til you come.”
A deep breath then, “I’m sure.”
Steve knew it was over, as if he didn’t already, but he knew for sure the day he saw Tony propose to Pepper during a televised press conference. The team was hiding in Australia when they saw the footage and despite the warm weather, a chill crept into Steve’s bones that he could never warm away.
The order is easy, so Steve lets the simple command wash over him as he closes the few steps between them. His hands are unsteady as he pulls at the button and zipper of Tony’s pants until the soft cock is freed. Steve loves to feel as the length grows against his tongue, how gentle sucks and flicks turn clay into stone. He’s halfway there when the vibration from Tony’s pocket interrupts.
“I will miss my assistant though. Who will laugh at my jokes now, Tony?” Steve beamed that thousand watt smile, slinging an arm around Tony’s shoulders.
He crawled until he was covering her lithe body with his massive frame and lapping at her tender breast. Tongue and teeth work in tandem to racket up the anticipation and the wetness between her legs.
Steve followed his gaze to the confessional booth, “Of course, Tony.” Steve, the gentleman, held open Tony’s door since the solid oak was rather heavy. This set Tony’s plot into motion, he pulled the screwdriver from his pocket.
She loved Steve, every single thing about this extraordinary man made her falling in love again every day. He was always so considerate of those around him, putting himself last with no second thought. Even now waiting until Toni had her pleasure before seeking his own, but now it was his turn to be selfish, his moment to take his pleasure from her body. This was Toni’s favorite part.
Moans spout from Steve throat, impossible to hold back when his burning length finally gets attention. These animalistic noises don’t belong to him anymore, he isn’t the man, the omega he was when he walked in here. How could he hold back? After the last hour of being on edge, of denying this desire deep in his stomach, it feels like being drenched in gasoline. A blaze spreads throughout his body, his skin is on fire with this yearning like never before.
“She worked extra shifts and late nights just to make ends meet, but I was sick a lot. I remember she would sit up with me at night and just talk, talk til she was hoarse, because the vibrations would break up the stuff in my chest and I could breath. She would tell me stories, mostly from her past. She would talk about her parents, Ireland, my Pa, everything. But my favorites were when she would dream up my future.
“We’re definitely not going in the lake now.” Toni laughed at that.
“Says the one being carried.”
Tony corrected his stance by widening his legs and putting his hands higher, “I’m putting your hands here, so they don’t move unless I say so. Understand?” Steve was silent.
It takes a few deep breaths and picturing his third grade teacher naked to guarantee he doesn’t come right there, “N-no Tony.”
In this position, Steve feels like he is on display. An art piece to be inspected, estimated, and presented for viewing. Does Tony like art? Would he pay top dollar to bring home this sculpture of a horny omega? Would he look at Steve everyday like a priceless Rembrandt? Who needs gallery lights when Tony’s smile brightens the whole room.
It had started with the tight pants some months past, Tony rushed through packing and had packed ass hugging, black clubbing trousers rather than the typical straight cut, business style he wore to services. Maria and Jarvis both gave him looks on his choice of attire, but neither commented on the seductive nature of his pants. What did it matter anyway when for the duration of Mass he wore a heavy bed sheet?
His cock strains from the dual sensation of his balls being tugged apart and massaged. Just knowing that Tony couldn’t have missed the twitch sends shame coursing through his veins. Tony can see how much his touch is affecting Steve, how out of control this omega is. But Tony does nothing but flash Steve a reassuring grin over the paper sheet between them.
She nodded, “Yes. I’ll elaborate when my brain comes back online.”
Tony, being any good scientist, had to run experiments to come to a reasonable conclusion. This time he purposefully dropped a book, methodically timed in front of a reflective window so that he could watch Father Rogers. Fuck, yeah that was a look, that was a hungry stare if Tony had ever seen one and, trust him, he had been on the receiving end of enough of those to be intimate aware of when he was being oogled.
Air filled Steve starving lungs as Tony slid home a final time and unleashed a copious amount of semen into Steve’s bowels. He was still hard and it took all his focus to not move his hands, it would be so easy to get off, it wouldn’t take much. But this wasn’t about him or his needs, this was about what Tony wants and Tony wanted him to stay right here.
Steve leans back on the table, but as he lays his shoulders down he hears the gown start to rip slightly. Crap. He rolls his shoulders back to keep it from ripping it down the back, but it looks like he is presenting his chest to Dr. Stark, like some lust driven harlot. Any sense of calm that he gain has been lost.
“I’m going to start by palpating around your penis. Just feeling for you blatter and symphysis pubis,” Tony informs him once they’ve both settled.
“Can we at least wait til it is dark before we go scaring the fishes?”
Toni wiped away the stray tears, Steve would wonder why she was crying. He couldn’t know, it would kill him to know that his dream of a family would never happen. Sarah Rogers wanted 10 kids, but Steve wanted just one. If she couldn’t give him that, would he stay? Would he find someone that could give him the thing he always dreamed for?
The steady, easy pace felt like sitting beside a bonfire, the heat crawling across his skin to chase away the phantom chill. But the cold was never far away, right behind you waiting for the fire to die. The only solution was to build a bigger flame.
“Steve, fuck. Baby, your mouth.”
Once he gets signed in he chooses a seat far away from other omegas. Some are rocking blanket swaddled babies and others are flipping through Omega health magazines with disinterest. At least this part feels normal, the waiting. The forms are general information about his medical history, family history, and allergies, all things he’s recounted to doctors hundreds of times.
“I’d better get back, your father will be waiting. Tony, are you coming now or should I send Jarvis later?”
Steve caught his eye through the thin metal, his pupils blow wide and mouth gaped. A small, minute nod later and Tony is working the screws of the grate. A few weeks ago he loosened them, to make this part easier. A few turns and the cage is being set free.
Slowly, Steve started to move, small jolts of muscle that barely soothed the need to seek completion until he was moving in deep pumps. They were too lost in each other to pay attention to the telltale signs of an approaching orgasm, consumed with kissing, touching, and sweet nothings. Steve came deep inside of her while whispering how much he loved her, she cherished those words more than the prospect of life the come gave.
Fingers snaked into the waiting hole, it stretched to accommodate the new girth. All digits worked together now, lips sucked at the tender cunt, tongue flicked the sensitive clit, and fingers rubbed at the coin size patch inside the pussy. Until.
The parish was primarily made up of an older crowd, most attending this very church since they were in Sunday school. Due to the lack of young families most roles in the service were left vacant, so on the Sundays that Tony attended he was made to play altar boy. In the beginning, he dreaded the humiliation that came from doing tasks typically filled by 8 year olds. If they functioned fine every other Sunday, why did he have to be subjected to the song and dance?
“What is wrong with you, stop!”
Tony shook his head, “Have J swing by in an hour or so. Got a few things left to finish here. If that’s good with you, Steve?” It was never an issue, but he wanted to make sure they’d have some time alone.
Maybe it was the connotation that came from having the device that scared him. There is this stigma around omegas that get it, that they are faking being beta and throwing away their evolutionary right to conceive. Society doesn’t talk about the omegas that can’t handle pregnancy or those like Steve battling their heats. Somehow it is seen as socially acceptable to be sex driven and knot hungry for days rather than having a device that halts those urges.
She could imagine sitting right here while Steve cradled their baby in his arms, cooing at the blanket swaddled infant. Or them chasing a just walking toddler around the yard, Steve would have a heart attack everytime it fell.
Is this what omegas go on about? Are these the sensations that Steve has been missing out on? But he’s had partners, relationships of all varieties, and none of them have made him into this blundering mess. The new variable is Tony, an alpha with the medical knowledge to swiftly send a faux beta into a true, wanton omega.
“Mm, come for me, sweetheart.” Steve growled. And she did.
But Steve has never cared, he has always loved her body. Their first time together, Toni tried to turn the lights off and keep on a shirt, but Steve convinced her to reveal the damage. Then he spent an hour that night kissing every scar, mark, and imperfection on her body. That might have been when she fell in love with him.
“Steve, do you want me?”
“I’m right here baby. I’m close, Steve, can you feel how badly I want to come for you? Are you hard, sweetheart?”
He tries to catch Dr. Stark’s eye, but he refuses to look at Steve. What just happened? That wasn’t just a diversion technique, there had to be more there. But Dr. Stark wouldn’t look at him, back to being clinical. Once the speculum is out, he is wiped down with a cloth and his legs are lowered from the stirrups.
Tony cleared his throat and he spoke up more serious this time. “I know that I´m holding us in this situation. But I´m not ready to give up my solo life yet. I still have few things to finish first, blow up something and stuff. But it´s not going to be forever like this.”
Steve felt a hint of guilt spreading inside of his chest. Those listed injuries were his fault. He may be okay tomorrow, but ordinary human body would take weeks to heal, like for example Iron man´s body. Sometimes all of them forgot that there was a man inside that armor.
“Maybe when you’re older, okay?”
Without having anything clever to say, Steve unpacked the first aid and started to work quietly on Tony´s side, fishing for any reaction that he was causing him more pain than he was already in.
And Steve was silent the whole time, surprised, overwhelmed, unable to pretend when all he wanted to do was grab Tony and kiss him senseless.
“What the hell are you doing, Steve?” The accusation was cold like a slap across the cheek. Clint was looking at both of them, taking in what he was seeing and what it meant and Steve had to remind himself that the archer had no idea who Tony was.
“You know I would never. Neither would the team.” Steve couldn´t believe Tony really thought this. “I care about you. Very much. For all I know I´m desperately falling in love with you.” He abruptly stopped, cursing in his head. Hearing his own deep breaths in stunned silence he didn´t expect a soft laughter in return.
There was an irritated sigh on the other side. “Tell him we took a sample of the gas, it´s not poisonous, but it will make him sick in a few hours. Someone should be with him. He can be delirious, see things, he can be aggressive. Be careful.”
PS: I guess I didn't explain it very well in the previous chapter, but what happened with Tony is that when he snapped, instead of bringing everyone back - which was quite a hard task resulting in his death in canon - he used only the time stone to take the team back in time on Titan. There they got another chance to beat Thanos. I guess you figured out that it worked out for them. Unfortunately, they no longer possessed the memories that Tony did.
“So if you may not fight me anymore, I would like to continue where I stopped?”
Steve nodded. “We need to find another way.” Steve gazed into the starry night and jumped a bit when he felt a gentle touch on his hand.
The touching came to a sudden halt and Steve found himself protesting in his head.
Steve walked in the room with a teasing grin and sat on the bed next to Tony. He reached down to caress their daughter’s hair lovingly.
There was again that soft smile on Tony’s lips. “You used to read it to me.”
“No, Steve. It’s okay. Really. You see? I’m good. Do I look like I’m crazy? Or that I need saving? No… I’m fine. Really, I am. I chose this.”
“It’s not your Steve, Tony. It’s me,” Steve opposed. “He and I are the same person. Why do you think it wasn’t real?”
The battle for Tony's life is over.
FINALE is here!
“I didn’t plan it for today. It just happened,” he said to the infinite depth in front of him, “I was too obvious. It won’t happen next time.”
Tony just shrugged again.
“What is it?” Steve asked straightforward, he knew Strange appreciated it that way.
“I asked how it happened.” Like and idiot I was. He´d sensed Tony tensing in his arms and he´d immediately wanted to take it back.
“I have an order not to let you leave. I´m sorry,” he apologized, the corners of his mouth turning up in the smile. “And I can fight you easily right now with that wound.”
Steve told him about Fury finding out about them. He knew they were meeting somehow.
“But I don´t know if you could be interested in this… I mean with me… It´s not like I can read about your preferences on the internet.”
He returned to the bar, ordering a beer and getting a seat further from people. He knew that eventually someone would come and try to talk to him, but it didn’t mean he needed to attract the attention. When Strange from all of the people took the seat next to him few minutes later, it was a small victory.
For a long moment there was no answer, only harsh breathing on the other side and small incoherent sounds of pain and discomfort.
Still, he was disappointed when he woke up alone, but the piece of paper on the nightstand made him smile.
“You can´t eat like that,” Steve hummed irritated.
Steve swallowed down the worry and tried to think clearly. He carefully outstretched his hand where Tony could see it.
“Why don’t you send Agent Stevens here with Rumlow on that special assignment?" Pierce's eyes turned contemplative. "See how he fares with something a little different from what your team usually does?”
Tony rubbed his face but didn’t let his sigh get out. Fuck. He realized that he’d been putting the trip to R&D off because by the time he had manufactured all the parts of his armor assembling line, the purchase orders would have reached Obie’s desk. Hopefully he wouldn’t take an interest, but sometimes he did, and in that case there could even be an interrogation regarding the purpose of the spending. Officially, Tony could do whatever, but he also knew that his social capital with the board would just not hold up against Obadiah Stane's should he choose to freeze him out of his official position. However difficult it had been to fight him after Afghanistan and many successful years as a celebrity CEO, now at twenty-one, convincing the board that he wasn’t just a grief-stricken, unstable and unreliable youth would be an impossibility. Tony would be locked out in no time.
“I need to be on the right missions.” The idea of working for Hydra left a bad taste in his mouth but they needed information, and currently, Steve was doing jackshit to get it. “I’m sure I’m on the right team — Rumlow is, or will be, Hydra soon, but they are not taking me along to the Hydra missions.”
“...can you stop for a minute, Tony? I know you love all those new ideas you have, but we also need to finance all these little hobbies somehow.”
“There. Good boy.”
Comparing, bad. Sex. Here and now.
That’s what being less of a playboy and more of a workaholic got you —  the attention of a powerful megalomaniac.
Why did he always want Andrew to sound different? More assertive? God, Tony was such a fool.
They exchanged several more jabs and hits and then Tony actually landed one.
They got out of the alley without incident. Tony sat up and wondered if Rumlow being behind the wheel meant it was actually some kind of a trap, but then remembered that if anything he’d been giving an air of deep disinterest to his assignment. He kept pushing off his responsibilities on Stevens or Madden whenever he wanted. And for a bodyguard to actually leave his client in a potentially dangerous situation? If it had been a trap, something would’ve definitely happened in that alley. Despite this, Stevens, like a paranoid nutcase, was driving around changing lanes and taking sharp turns without signalling. Other drivers honked at them, but so far, no attacks nor, as far as Tony could see, any pursuers.
Tony grinned. “I like the sound of that.” He did. Either the man wasn't in pain or he was enjoying it. Tony was good with either. “God, you look fine. Feel fine too. Will soon be stretched on me like a glove. Pretty thing, aren’t you?”
“I have a goal.”
‘Good morning’ Tony was supposed to say, but instead, he just grunted and stared at the plate Stevens put on the desk to his right. Tony had planned to ask Stevens if maybe they could, like two reasonable adults, pretend that the sex had never happened, but for some reason, he was now unable to even utter a greeting.
Yeah. Mostly.
If Steve was sincere about doing the right thing, this was his opportunity. He had a chance of not repeating his gravest mistake. Steve swallowed and pushed himself up to his proper height and answered, “Yes.”
And Tony’s desperate scream for Steve to save himself and damn the rest of humanity; the bitter lack of satisfaction as Tony smashed his fist through the creature's spine and dropped him into the water. Everything just a split second too late. Then the pain in his joints as he finished what Steve had started; the tears in Clint's eyes as he was yelling that Tony could let go now, that it was enough, that they'd gotten everybody to safety.
“We can add it to the end of the world tradition.”
“There are too many entryways,” Steve told Tony who’d wanted to go in alone, like always. “If they have a private room with only one door, I can wait behind it.”
“Ah, now you remember.” Tony’s eyes were shining with dark intent.
“You’re a fucking tool, a hollow copy, no sense, no clue, nice and caring, and no idea what you are doing... what that face of yours does. This is what you are useful for, nothing else. Shouldn’t expect more from you, should I?”
Andrew visibly inhaled and bore down as he pushed the finger in with force, straight up to the second knuckle and all the breath left Tony’s lungs. Shit.
“On your knees.”
Tony blinked. The bitter disappointment broke him in half and he folded, almost slipping down the wall he was leaning on. He didn’t look like Steve. He did, but he didn’t. Even if his bearing was pitch-perfect, it couldn’t be Steve.
The memory of determination on Steve’s face as his features disintegrated like a pixelated image from a screen; the glint of that damn alien gun in the Chitauri’s hand just a moment before, and Steve’s eyes widening as he realized what was going to happen. The resolve to not defend himself so that the rest of the team would have time to evacuate as many people as possible before the bridge's collapse into the water; the knowledge and acceptance of a certain death in his gaze while his muscles were still straining under the weight of the crumbling structure.
“I know this isn’t— Probably never were…”
Steve took a sip of his coffee to quell all the pictures flooding his head at the phrase ‘too much.’ The tips of his ears must’ve been bright red, but he answered as casually as possible, “Of course.”
“You’re not sharing? Is that about food insecurity in the 20s or…?”
Office work had never been something Tony revelled in, but he was good at most things he put some effort into, and he’d learned to be patient with tasks he disliked doing as the years went by, too. Nevertheless, the day one had to receive a future (or hell, who knew, maybe even present) Hydra leader was definitely rather stress-inducing.
Now, he only needed to get the stupid thing. It was stored well away in the lowest drawer at the back of his pretentious, much too large closet where he stored the thermal underwear he needed… well, never. He grabbed the box without really looking at it, kicked the drawer closed and went back to the desk.
Steve snatched the package off the delivery bot. He’d been around anyway, relaxing in the rec room after breakfast, and when he heard the telltale whirring of the small guy, bringing their mail in as every morning, he went to check if there was anything for him.
"Good. Show me. There’s lube in the bedside table on your left."
Fuck.
“Yeah, of course.” Maybe Steve was so good at playing the idiot because he secretly was one. “But you never use it.”
“You think disentangling them might bring him back?”
It didn’t matter. Not right now, not yet. Nothing of what was happening now would ever matter to the present Steve in this new, changed timeline. Tony cut that train of thought off.
Anthony’s mouth fell open, the harsh admonishment lost somewhere between his brain and his tongue. Steve closed the door as fast as he could without slamming it.
Seven flights of stairs was not a problem for his young body, not now that he’d been training regularly for a few weeks. If anything, it would’ve been boring, but the adrenaline that was pumping through his body was keeping his mind fresh and his blood boiling. The sound of S— Andrew’s steps falling right behind him was only adding to his energy.
But… the stuff was there anyway, and what was he going to do with it?
He didn’t give the other man a chance to reply, and one knee on the bed for better access, he worked the plug in. Andrew pushed back to receive it but otherwise didn’t react.
Absolutely not.
Sighing, Tony opened another email, read it quickly and replied with only half his mind on it. Paperwork in his actual office at SI was even less inspiring than it used to be. Perhaps because there wasn't actually anything important that he could do. Not yet. One day, when Obie was booted out, SI would be his entirely and he would make changes. He would… take assistants for this routine correspondence and spend his time more meaningfully. He would hire Pepper. In two more years.
Tony kneeled down beside the couch, putting Steve’s own dick into his view. Unceremoniously, Tony tugged off the condom and dropped it into his own come on Steve’s stomach. Steve tried to swallow but there was a lump in his throat, making it impossible. He stared at Tony, unblinking, and could feel his dick twitch, as well as see it from the corner of his eyes. Tony just hummed interestedly. His attention was firmly kept on Steve's face while his gloved hand wrapped around Steve's cock, which was disappointing and thrilling. Steve ached for the intimacy of Tony's skin, the calluses on his fingertips, the warmth of connection. The glove told Steve exactly what this encounter was: a cursory hand job to reward the stranger he'd just used as a sex toy.
Steve heard Tony’s satisfaction but couldn’t see him, belatedly realizing that he had closed his eyes, unable to open them again. Tony was stroking him through his orgasm and this time there was no admonishment for not looking at him. Steve felt like he had jumped out of a plane without a chute and plunged into the ocean unharmed.
He still sounded soft, but Andrew shivered, so Tony hadn't fucked it up. Andrew only stayed a moment more and without saying a word, complied. Mouth dry, hands still on his hips, Tony watched him go. Then sauntering as if he had all the time in the world, Tony followed.
Clint was already there, eating something that obviously contained chicken and some kind of sauce. He said that it didn’t matter what you combined as long as the nutritional values were right. Steve thought it was a lazy excuse for his weird tastes.
"Nah, all's good," Madden replied. "Egg’s not bothered me. No visitors, no phone calls. Been sitting in his bedroom since we arrived two hours ago."
were the one to invite me here?” Peggy sounded amused. “But enough with the pleasantries. We don’t have much time.”
The box was still sealed, which didn’t hinder Steve from prying it open and tipping its contents onto the tabletop. Steve could not avoid looking at that horrible piece of plastic any longer.
"Stevens?" Tony shouted through the closed window.
He said something. As far as he could judge, something appropriate. Thanked the man for taking an interest and promised to think about the missiles, the schematics which he’d secretly already destroyed but which he still could bring to his mind’s eye with perfect clarity for reproduction. And oh so many, many more and better weapons and improvements to them floating in his brain like poison.
SPOILER: spoiler here stop reading now if you don't want to be spoiled spoiler here spoiler here: Tony just can’t resist Stevens for looking like Steve, but he is also taunting, abrasive because he needs to retaliate for Stevens not being Steve. Spoiler end spoiler end spoiler end spoiler end spoiler end.
“Alright.” Tony sighed. “Let's get you into the car and back to the apartment first.”
After spending the whole day at the gym, he felt like a human being again. He showered down there and went directly to the communal kitchen. The day called for an early dinner and bedtime. No more surprises or unplanned incidents.
Steve turned off the shower. “I can’t say who else is or is going to be a part of them, but Rumlow is a certainty.”
“And there is the designated driver,” Lowell said. “If you want to continue your nanny routine maybe drive him around the block a few times to lull him to sleep. I heard it works very well for some toddlers, and I’m pretty sure he hasn’t slept again for forty-eight hours.”
“Can’t you knock?” Garret barked at him.
Tony blinked. The privacy screen? Did they really think he was such a moron? Even if he were actually twenty-one, he would have found it suspicious. It was the second time in under a week, for god’s sake! They were blatantly leaving him alone with Lowell who would try and “distract” him from the “danger.” Too bad, Tony was just not in the mood for molly-coddling or even sex. At his age, even in this mint-fresh body, physical gratification was not everything. Lowell was great, sometimes even fantastic, but playing along with them right now... pretending to have an intimate moment when they both clearly knew what this was… Tony had no intention of doing that. He almost felt sorry for the woman. Looking at her, she didn’t seem to be very keen on the whole idea either.
“Tony,” he said, his tone full of sadness-laced disappointment. “You know that your father would not see it this way, don’t you? You are not just disregarding his wishes and dishonouring his memory with your childishness, you are tearing down everything your father and I built. And what would your mother say to that, Tony? Have you thought about that?”
“Thought of getting lucky tonight, huh?” he asked snidely.
And without heeding Tony’s objections, he left.
“With you goons in tow?” he said, raising his eyebrow. “Obie will hopefully forget about these stupid threats soon enough, and then I'll 'party.’ Don’t you worry your pretty head about it.”
It couldn’t be. It wasn’t. Pressing his palm to the wall, Tony leaned over and took another look at the improbably triangular back, the military crop of light blond hair. It was shorter than he’d ever seen it on Steve. But of course it was. It couldn’t be
And sexy.
He pulled out the leftovers from yesterday’s lunch and placed them in the microwave. Not long to wait, and he would be back behind a closed door in no time.
Without giving Andrew a chance to respond, he forcefully thrusted another finger in and the resulting grunt-sigh was immensely satisfying. He squeezed the beautiful butt cheek in front of him painfully and groaned in envy as Andrew started moving on his fingers. There was no point in dragging this out. Stevens seemed to be thinking he was ready, who was Tony to argue with that? He drew his fingers out and that got him a grunt of dismay.
His rhythm faltered and his cock almost slipped out.
...and slaves. The lines of mindless slaves walking thoughtlessly behind each other into the mine tunnels or weapons factories or even the long kitchen stations where other mindless slaves were boiling some kind of sludge and distributing it to the workforce.
Steve mentally rewound the last sentences he’d heard.
“Alright, open—”
When Rumlow left, Steve breathed easier. Any one of them in the same room with Anthony set Steve’s teeth on the edge, exaggerating all of his warring impulses that he had well stowed away otherwise. Now they were at least out of sight. Frankly, Steve had been desperate to just get Rumlow out of Anthony’s presence and was glad it wasn’t Lowell to replace him. (She’d put her foot down the first time Rumlow tried to lob his shift on to her.)
He could either go out there and do… something. Or– Or–
“Go away!” Tony rasped, trying to stop his spiralling thoughts, but the snowball had been pushed downhill and —
Steve simply sat there for a moment, trying to get the gears in his head turning again. “What about Lowell?” he asked, even though he knew that he should just decline.
Steve. Should he also help Steve? Would defrosting him early help him? Help the world? Would Steve want to be defrosted early to fight Hydra? Or would it be unfair to ask?
Tony, who was sitting on the couch with the business news TV and some scientific journal in his hands, subjected Steve to a glare out of squinting eyes.
The handshake and the pat on the shoulder looked heartfelt, and dutifully, Tony nodded before closing the door. He took a step further and leaned his forehead against the wood. Closed his eyes.
Garret was gruff, but that wasn’t a problem for Steve. They hadn’t found anything connecting him to Hydra, which didn’t mean that he wasn’t part of it; it was equally likely he could simply be a tired SHIELD agent who didn’t know what was going on underneath the surface.
Tony was skipping two steps at a time as he covered the last flight. He felt like a school boy sniggering about giving his teacher the slip, so grinning, he pushed the door to the car park level—
The way Tony kept looking at him had Steve’s blood rush in his ears. The smile was open, adoring, telling him to do whatever as long as he didn’t take his attention away from Tony. Steve laid his fingers on the tiny cock, teasing it with the barest touch possible.
“The Golden Egg wants to go to work.” That was the name Rumlow had decided to give Tony. Anthony. Steve should get the distinction clear in his head.
Stark scowled, and Steve already thought they were through. “Please, don’t tell me you get that excited about a new razor? No? Set of monogrammed handkerchiefs? Bookmarks?”
From the bottom of my heart, THANK YOU to those who are still reading. <3 >3 <3
There was no underwear. Of course, there wasn’t. Hadn’t Stark said that he had almost complete control over the design? Steve pressed his lips into a thin line.
Still, at the same time, Steve had expected Tony to be better, to get the results, have the solutions, to make the stuff happen that no one else could. Why? Because history showed that Tony could just do the impossible, and he made it look easy. But now Steve was starting to understand how much fight had gone into creating and keeping up that image.
Very tenderly, Steve angled the legs into the stockings, careful to not tear or rip the fabric. It slid on smoothly, and he could easily manipulate it so they went the sleek thighs by just gently stroking upwards. When they sat, covering two-thirds of the legs, and there were no pleats left, only the olive skin shining through the white nylon, he pulled the garter over the hips and everything was in place. In the end, Steve decided to forgo the pumps. Barefoot fitted the look much better.
By the time the bodyguards arrived that morning, Tony had first sculpted and then shaved off the beginnings of his goatee. He did it with regret, but it just looked as if he was trying too hard; he didn’t need people at SI snickering behind his back. He was what he was: an old man in a twenty-one-year-old body that looked barely eighteen, so he'd have to work with what he had.
Betas for this one: VTHX and ASchmidts and BuckyAboveEverything - thank you so much, guys!! <3
He tried to get rid of the thought that he had been staring at this thing’s dick, contemplating if the detail of a thick patch of curly dark hair painted around it was really necessary. If it was the actual way Stark looked down there. Steve shook his head.
“Stevens, sir.”
Regardless of his apparent polite patience, Tony expected the CFO to visit him with the thumb screws relatively soon. The crucial bit, at this point, was stalling him until they could launch what Tony needed launching because otherwise, all his efforts would be in vain.
Steve slunk off to his corner, wondering for a moment if he was just making everything worse. The first time, Tony came through everything all by himself. He was self-made in every sense of the word. Maybe there was really no space for Steve in that. Not before, not now, and not in the future, no matter how different it all might look at the moment.
“I hope you make good progress on your projects today,” Steve told Anthony, but the only reaction he got was Lowell’s fake-looking grin.
Tony struggled to stay up and look over the shoulder even as the car was drifting to the right. He thought he saw a large garbage truck standing in the middle of the crossing just where they were supposed to have driven through.
As much as he still could. When Steve fell asleep, the hot streaks of tears on his face had run cold and mostly dried up already.
They arrived at the same time as Stane. Tony, again, walked at the head of their small procession with Steve and Stane behind him, the latter apparently waiting for them to reach their destination before picking up the argument again. The group walked past the conference room Tony usually went to do his paperwork, and to the end of the hall behind a dim receptionist station. It was immediately obvious that someone important worked at the office ahead of them.
None of the distractions — visits from Obie and Pierce — helped while Stevens was actually around. The man was… nurturing. And built. Like a bodybuilder, pardon the repetition, because supersoldiers… weren’t a thing and Tony was not thinking about them. And he definitely wasn’t thinking of the blocks of ice drifting in the Arctic.
“You’re smart enough to know your actions do have consequences. Even if you are Tony Stark.”
“That’s not what I’m doing,” Stevens lied without moving a muscle.
It was annoying that it took time away from advancing his plans, but he did need to survive Obie’s professional knuckle crackers. Thank god they had no idea he was Iron Man who in this timeline would most probably never exist… He couldn’t risk speeding up the process of bringing Earth onto the interstellar map more than it already was. That would be unacceptable, no matter how much Tony wished he could don the armor again.
This time Steve looked his fill of the white stripes bordering painted-on curly black hair and the tiny plastic penis.
and 'Andrew' very obviously enjoys it. Tony imagines doing stuff to him but gets angry that he keeps imagining Steve.
“Wherever your thoughts are, they are not here. Stop it.” One of Tony’s hands was wrapping around Steve’s chin. Steve’s whole body felt like it was on fire but Tony’s touches were like a balm. “Just like so. Open up.”
Tony swallowed and gripped his pencil. The lines and symbols before his eyes had stopped making sense. The only thing he was now aware of was the man kneeling next to him, silent and still, full of anticipation.
A fond smile wanted to break out on Steve’s face, but just like always during the past several years, he didn’t let it.
Time and time again, Steve had caught himself thinking that maybe his and Tony’s relationship could be more. Something Steve would call friends without having to pause before saying it, or adding a ‘but’ after. Could be if only Tony hadn’t projected this… this impenetrable facade. But now he saw that he had never given Tony the chance to act in any other way.
“What do you want it to be, Cap?”
“That hurts, Ty. Pull out and get the lube.”
The elevator stands open like a yawning chasm before him.
Right now Steve had hope and that was a powerful thing, but take that away and everything would crumble down around them. Without the hope for a better tomorrow, why wake up today? Maybe they could stake their hope in that 2 percent.
The stethoscope retreats and Tony stands up again, “All good there. Let me grab a tray then we’ll get you in the stirrups.” Steve lets out a shaky breath and wills, begs, prays that his erection will flag before this doctor puts his hands on it. If not, he might go off like a bottle rocket.
But when Steve took out the bag and tried to close the drawer, the last few loose items rattled. Maybe he didn’t hear that, it wasn’t th-
Today wasn’t a good day.
The pressure is perfect around his throat, he can only take in small, hiccup breaths that make his head spin. “Please Daddy. I need your come, I need you to fill me up. I’m so empty without you, want to feel you paint me with your seed.” Steve used most of this breath to get out his plea, then economized each breath after to keep up a stream of “Please Daddy, I need you. Please...daddy…” This felt like fire, the kind that consumes everything it touches and leaves ruin in its wake but all fires need one thing to grow. Oxygen.
to me, Tony.”
Steve felt like he’d been pushed into a trough of water, relief almost sticking his voice in his throat. “Tony? It’s… it’s me, it’s Steve.”
Then, just as soon as it had appeared, the glow was gone. The change was so abrupt that Steve barely had time to adjust to the darkness of twilight before a dark shape crested from where the swan had disappeared moments before.
His eyebrows arched up. “So, you want to?”
to acknowledge your own foolishness,” he sneered. “Then nothing is stopping me from keeping you here by magical means. If, as you say, there is nothing I could do to you that would change your mind.”
“If there even was anyone,” Stevens half agreed and sat up to allow Tony back onto the seat.
Staying still but it was impossible. When Tony let go, Steve sagged back down with a sob.
“That’s decided then." Pierce clapped Steve on the shoulder. "Good luck on your assignment, Stevens—and Garett, I expect you to pay appropriate attention to this matter and keep me informed. Have a good day.”
“You are very welcome, sir.”
“But I have to protect you,” he muttered.
He was using Anthony just as everyone else was, but for Steve, it was unforgivable. He was supposed to be his friend, and instead he had used the personal information he had on Tony, gained his trust, and then slept with him. Steve had slept with a young man because apparently he’d wanted to do that with his older counterpart, but never even realized it before it was too late. Unforgivable.
It wasn’t even the pause that made Tony's eyebrow quirk. It was something in his tone that sounded... insolent, but at the same time it was so subtle that Tony couldn’t be sure if he was making it up due to the… similarity.
“Nice to meet you, Mr Stark.” She looked professional enough in her neat light bob and pantsuit, but there was something in her smile that Tony didn’t like.
“She isn’t—” Steve started but Tony’s stare was making his mind skip. “She was sent.”
Without looking in his direction, Tony nodded and got into the car.
Tony had been on edge when they left the office building in Manhattan. He’d had a meeting with some important investors, and it could have gone better. They were only halfway back to the apartment when a call on the car phone led them back to a restaurant in Midtown. One of the partners of the firm who had just declined Tony any support wanted to talk to him privately. Steve was on duty and told Lowell to wait in the car. Apparently taking her cue from Rumlow, Lowell just shrugged.
“’M good,” Steve confirmed, but it was as if Tony wasn’t even listening to him.
And it could have been  worse — he could have overshot and landed in his 17-year-old self or even earlier. He grimaced and rubbed at his sternum absently.
"Brilliant."
Lowell, fine. She was clearly experienced and beautiful and coming onto him rather hard. So Tony hadn’t been very nice to her, but she had known what she was getting into; definitely not her first time working a honeypot scheme. Lowell wanted information and was willing to pay for it with her body, despite the risk of not getting anything in return. So Tony had thought it only fair to also hope that she’d let something slip herself.
“I’m sorry,” Steve said. “I just wanted to let you know about the shift change, and that I’m here if you need anything.” The scowl slowly crept back on Anthony’s face and Steve prepared for a strategic withdrawal. “I’ll leave you to your jet engine geometry then.”
“It’s none of your business what is up with my day.”
Stop.
All four of them.
Steve refused to pace while waiting for the need to grab and tear to go down. He stood still in the middle of his room. He could hear his own labored breathing. It was ridiculous.
Tony waited for him to close his shirt and tie his bow tie again. Thankfully most of the drool had hit the floor. And Tony’s shoe. The thought ran electricity through Steve which he tried to calm down. Their appearance would need to hold up to scrutiny for the time Tony needed to make his excuses and leave.
“Have they? Have they really?”
“99 now.”
“It’s not that way,” the other Tony said. He did not volunteer how it was.
Steve had to swallow before rasping out the words, “I… No, of course not.”
There was a polite laugh, and Tony said some closing words. One director wanted to know what he’d meant by changes, and Tony shared his aspirations in communications and the computer industry. Then the chairman closed the meeting.
Trying to even out his breathing, Tony turned back to his work, but his heart was still racing and the urge to follow Andrew into the kitchen was nearly unstoppable. But no. He’d told Andrew to get him a coffee and that was what was going to happen. He would drink coffee and work and Andrew was going to kneel at his feet, perhaps with his head on Tony’s thigh even…
Steve didn’t argue, didn’t hesitate. The shirt came off.
“You guys often do this kind of thing?” Tony asked.
Steve felt like he should have an opinion on what was happening, but his mind was gloriously empty between the pain in his scalp and the pressure on his thighs. His dick was filling rapidly and with a hum, Tony started to grind down against him.
Tony’s other hand trailed over his face, proprietarily. Steve’s jaw went slack, causing Tony to chuckle. “Slut.”
Andrew made a desperate noise.
“How is your urge to punch people at random these days?” Peggy asked. It was always her last question.
Steve’s throat was hurting, and the taste of latex was everywhere; he could hear himself making sputtering sounds, trying to breathe and drooling even more in the process. His blood was rushing in his ears and he got only parts of what else Tony was saying. There was a constant stream of words now as if a dam had broken.
Their intense gazes locked onto each other, Tony executed a couple of more attacks, then deciding to take a chance, leaped back and turned to the ropes. “Get in the shower. We’re leaving.”
Steve rearranged him so he sat down on the table. His skirt bunched up a bit and Steve used his other hand to smooth it down again. He could feel the rise of the tiny plastic genital through the cloth.
In astonishment, he lowered his arms.
He looked at Tony and, in an exasperated way, slid his fingers through his still-there hair.
“Stop that!” Tony snapped, as he grabbed the hand.
That. Was. Hot.
Making his own voice just a small bit higher, he let Doll-Tony answer, “Yes, sir.”
It was good that Steve had that excuse to fall back on. His eyes trailed after... Anthony. As was Steve’s job. He didn’t need to feel weird about it. This room was full of people much more dangerous than Anthony could even guess. If Steve took his task seriously, he would drag him out of here without further hesitation, but he couldn’t. Because he was ineffective, corrupted, hypocritical, a coward—
“Are you
Condoms! Steve felt like his brain was melting.
No. No, he had no intention of telling Obie anything. Yesterday was supposed to be just a temporary reprieve, but Tony was so, so tired of pandering to the old man who thought nothing much of hiring terrorists to solve his problems. On the other hand, Tony had to keep him believing that he still had Tony under his thumb or there would be consequences. Damn it.
not having anything.” Steve made an effort to not clench his teeth. He could eat in his room.
Going jogging wasn’t doing shit for him. But he couldn’t stay in the apartment all the time either; he’d break someone’s face. Rumlow’s or Madden’s, or even Stane’s. Should he show his ugly mug.
Could he? So what if he ended up on death row for it. Aunt Peggy would listen to him. Aunt Peggy would investigate—
Tony grit his teeth and sat down, trying to hide his reaction. “I know,” he said quietly.
“That is all I’m asking.”
Tony looked away and grit his teeth. Maybe he should just fuck someone similar, get it out of his system. It wouldn’t help. It hadn’t when Steve had been alive, it wouldn’t now, and staring at this gorgeous oaf in a tux wouldn’t change anything.
Tony’s hand was reaching for Steve’s chin, but his eyes were already back on Tony's face, and the memory alone of that thumb in his mouth and how it had dug in painfully was enough to send Steve over the edge the moment Tony’s fingers touched his face.
Steve managed seven hours of not thinking about Anthony, but that was because he was thinking about Tony instead. Everything he was learning about Anthony was also true for Tony. That somehow made Steve’s stomach twist and turn painfully. All of this had already happened. Rumlow had been around Tony, and Lowell had tried to get to SI secrets by sleeping with him. Young Tony obviously already had second thoughts about designing weapons, but he would still continue until it would almost cost him his life, all because the person that he trusted would betray him — had already betrayed him.
“James,” the knight greeted his youngest squire, who bowed respectfully.
Actually, Tony was more shocked than anything. “Uh, is it bad if I was more scared when I thought you were just some random creep who broke into my apartment?”
Howard had been quiet, looking at Nia with a skeptical gaze, but then he had nodded. “Well,” he had said, “whatever you choose, people are going to judge you. They’re going to say you don’t deserve what you have, they’re going to accuse you of getting where you are by cheating your way, by doing things you would never do, they’re going to underestimate your intelligence.”
Tony did not bother pretending not to understand. “Why not? Things were under control.”
Her touch dragged it down...and then she saw hair, limbs, the blue of a uniform, a glassy-eyed expressionless stare, and threads of crimson flowing from the hole in the center of the forehead.
Tony stares at him for a moment before quietly asking, “Do you trust me?” Steve nods instantly without a thought, keeping his mouth closed to prevent unrequited feelings from spilling out.
this? Had he asked for these marks on his body, like some common whore? Maybe this was it, this is why Tony broke things off. Apparently he wanted more that Steve wasn’t prepared to give. That’s what Ty was for, to fill in where Steve lacked. How long had this been going on, a few days, a week, while they were still together?
A hand replaced the mouth jacking him off. His jaw must be sore. “Tony,” Steve’s rough voice called for him.
The coolness from the speculum sends out shivers through Steve’s body as it penetrates his canal, his body rapidly warming the device. He feels full now, not an alpha knot kind of full, but a subtle comfort that eases the fuzziness behind his eyes enough to breath. Tony cranks the speculum open a few notches.
Toni was unceremoniously dropped on the king size bed, bouncing across the patchwork quilt. Steve stood at the end of the bed as he pulled off his tee shirt. His eyes raked over her half naked form, cataloging each breath with a sharp stare. He gets this way, not wanting to miss a thing, flexing that eidetic memory. He would just look for hours if she’d let him and she has before, but now is not the time.
Steve was confused. Why do this if it wasn’t to help Steve with his demented desire? Tony was the only one who knew what Steve needed, knew the burden he hid away. “I don’t understand.”
“Oh fuck, Toni! Here it comes” Steve growled as he came, semen shooting deep into her sopping wet cunt. One of his massive hands pushed against her stomach and Toni could swear she felt the come filling her, expanding the caverns inside of her, filling her with Steve’s soul.
“Steve, I need verbal consent or I’m not doing this.”
“I’m serious, let me go, Ty. Get off of me!”
The blunt tip prodded at her tender slit, coating the first inches with the evidence of Toni’s pleasure. Steve hissed through his teeth when the bulbous head sunk into her pussy, walls squeezing the new intrusion. This first time wouldn’t last long, they both knew. They were on edge, teasing each other the last few hours and desperation was starting to set in. There would be time for sweet, slow, and everything in between later.
Eventually Steve was to a full hardness and ready to stake his claim on the loose hole. He rubbed the blunt head against the pucker, catching against the hole each time, “Baby, I’m dry.” Steve pushed. Tony wanted it rough, he was going to get rough. He was loose enough and the water would cut down on the friction, this wouldn’t take long anyway.
“Your chart says that you presented at 16 and at 18 you had the implant put in.”
Mindful hands wandered over Steve’s body, cataloging each muscle, until they came to sensitive nipples and tested Steve’s resolve. The fingers started by circling his chest, the touch was so light it almost tickled and he didn’t know if he wanted to lean into or move away from the sensation. The circles got smaller until the fingers were moving over the stiff peaks causing Steve’s hips to jolt, humping nothing but air.
He kissed her like that again a year later in front of all their friends when they said their vows. It’s been 2 years since then and in that time they’ve saved the Earth twice and fought every other day. Even on the bad days, Steve always stays and that’s a revolutionary idea for her. No one in her life has stayed the way he has, sure Pepper and Rhodey have always been there but even they have their limits.
The elevator sounds then opens on his floor, jerking Steve from his conundrum. It’s too late to back out now, so he follows the signs through the maze of corridors until he reaches the last door of an endless hallway.
He was done for. His seed painted the window as his hips jolted through the aftershocks.
Tony’s pace was beginning to falter, the once long strokes had become short piston-like stabs that were building up to his release. The hand abandoned his chest, one returned to his hip for stability, but the other wound itself around his throat and tightened. “Beg me, Steve. Beg Daddy to fill you with his come.”
“Summit Omega Health Clinic” the gold letters on the frosted glass of the door read.
This endless trek led him to slipping into Tony’s guest room after all the business of the day was done. Steve had counted down the minutes of the customary hour he waited following Tony’s last meeting before seeking him out, he had learned that Tony needed to decompress first to get in the right head space for what was to come.
They ate on the patio overlooking the lake. It was still early enough into the season that bugs weren’t too big of a nuisance and the weather was enjoyable. She was right though, once Steve finished scarfing down his double portion, he ran inside to get his sketchbook. It was peaceful, rocking in the chair and listening to Steve’s pencil scratch against the paper.
“You ok, baby?” Steve asked, kissing the inside of her thigh. She nodded.
Toni moaned as the cock inside repeatedly hit the back wall of her cunt, this was the ultimate feeling of fulfillment. Like this, they were puzzle pieces, fitting perfectly together to make a beautiful scene. Steve’s strokes thankfully avoided the tender spot inside, Toni was still coming down from her peak and every movement caused pinpricks of electricity. She couldn’t decide if she wanted to push into the oncoming fire or pull away for relief, both a dizzying high.
Steve nodded, “Yes Daddy.” Earning the right to come gave him something to work towards, a goal in mind. It almost felt like if he could earn getting fucked, earn an orgasm, he could earn back Tony’s love too.
