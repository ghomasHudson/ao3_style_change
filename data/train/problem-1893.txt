See you around, she sent, and put down the phone.
“No,” Mycroft agreed.
Lestrade levelled his gun, and blinked, as the façade of Sally Donovan dropped away and a rather weird looking creature stood there instead. Puce-coloured, bipedal, it was currently staring in disbelief at the watch on its wrist that was suddenly on the ground.
Lestrade raised an eyebrow. “What do you mean?”
“Obviously, Gregory,” said Mycroft tiredly. Greg raised an eyebrow, but didn’t comment.
There were footsteps, and supportive hands helping him up gently. “Easy, mate,” said another voice, also blessedly English. “Lean on me. That’s it.” John squinted at him. Looks human. Feels real.   He tried to move his feet. It was hard. “It’s not far,” said the man. “Nearly there. You can rest in a minute.”
Greg swore again. Mycroft, however, calmly went to a drawer and located two torches, one of which he gave to Greg. “Are you armed?” Greg nodded. “Go to John. Use the stairs. Lock the door, and don’t let anyone in except Anthea or myself.”
Rory had never been more bored in his life. As he was currently wandering the corridors of the TARDIS, this was saying something. About a day previously, the Doctor had arrived on the doorstep, was not remotely bothered by the fact that Amy was away visiting friends, and dragged Rory out of the door, announcing that they were going to save a man’s life and there wasn’t a moment to lose. He then parked the TARDIS in orbit and said he was scanning. Rory had phoned Amy, had a meal, slept, showered, another meal, read a book, phoned Amy again, and was about to climb the walls. “Rory!” bellowed the Doctor from the control room. Action finally, thought Rory, hurrying in that direction.
“You just did,” muttered Sherlock, receiving a cuff from one of the men across the back of his head.
“I did,” said Mycroft. “And it does not match what we know of Andrew Martin. I was going to have it analysed to see if it had been synthesized to hide it, but what is the point of going to all of that trouble and then giving your name?”
“Seen your picture in the paper,” said Rory. “And the Doctor said it was you we were coming to find.” Rory fished out a stethoscope. “I want to listen to your lungs, okay?”
The console in front of the Doctor beeped. “We’re cleared to board.”
Treschlkt looked at him sullenly. “Him. Trickster.”
The thudding suddenly stopped, and there was silence. A moment later there were footsteps, and a knock at the door. “This is Anthea.”
The Doctor shook his head. “There is no danger to anyone else, I assure you.”
The Doctor opened another door, leading to a bedroom. Sherlock looked at the equipment sitting on a bench in the kitchen. “Is this it?”
“You know, that’s exactly what Mycroft said to me.”
The Doctor considered this for a moment. “Hmm, probably not. The perception will include the injury, whether the Yrani wants it to or not. Where is he injured?”
Martin stepped around the table. “Did you do that on purpose?”
Kate wrinkled her nose. “Please don’t compare me with Mycroft Holmes, the man’s a spider.” She leaned back in her chair. “So, no alien invasion then. What brings you here? I take it it’s not a social call.”
The Doctor watched Sherlock carefully examine the two pieces he held. “So put it back together,” said Sherlock.  Moments later he was holding a single piece of cloth. He examined it again. “Hm. Molecular bonding. How is it done? I think you’ll find I do have the chemistry.”
“That’s why it didn’t work on you, Sherlock,” said Mycroft. “You never do as you’re told.”
“Dear Kate understands lives are at stake, which are more important than petty interdepartmental quarrels, don’t you think?” said the Doctor sarcastically.
“Not happening,” said Greg. “Your cover’s blown, they know you’re in the building. Give up.”
Greg thought that the hapless survivor, probably one of Sherlock’s torturers, was not in for a good time. He watched the medical personnel clean and stitch Sherlock’s wounds. The floor became stained with the blood they washed from him. He thought about all the murder victims he’d seen over the years, and it was all too easy to picture John in a shallow grave somewhere, a mental picture that left him choked with grief. And how would Sherlock survive without him? Greg decided he didn’t care what Mycroft and his men did to that bastard they had in custody.  His focus had to be on helping Sherlock.
Ha, yeah, 24 hour party around here. Anyway, gotta go, I’ll see you around, yeah?
Lestrade shook his head but didn’t answer.
“Molecular bonding,” said the Doctor. He snatched up what looked like a piece of cloth from a polished wooden table that looked strangely out of place in that technological setting, and handed it to Sherlock.
“I’m sure they’ll turn up,” said Mycroft. “Has anyone told Doctor Watson?”
“Inside voices, little brother,” said Mycroft snidely.
“I’m alright,” murmured John.
“Come into my office,” said Mycroft pleasantly.
Amy looked around. “Here?” she asked dubiously. Moments later there was a crash, the distinct sound from the street below of a car accident. Rory got to his feet, but the Doctor put a restraining hand on his arm.
John smirked. “Git.” He looked at the broken little finger. “That wasn’t handcuffs.”
The Doctor nodded. “I need it. Secondly, do you have a file on the Yrani?”
“In 2008, Dr John Hamish Watson, RAMC, was seconded to UNIT for a period of three months while in Afghanistan. What for?”
Anthea nodded, and left the room without further discussion. He indulged in a moment of self-recrimination for grossly underestimating the situation. The problem was that he could see no flaw in his information. Had Sherlock been too cocky, too careless? Or had he missed something? Well, the re-check should uncover any issues.
“John’s going to save the world?” asked Sherlock sceptically.
“About an hour ago, we received word that a CCTV hack had been discoverd. This of course does happen occasionally, but this particular breach was narrowed down to specific locations. Baker Street, St Bartholomew’s Hospital, New Scotland Yard, your street, Dr Hooper’s street.”
“Sorry about that,” said the Doctor cheerily. “Just thought we should … lay our cards on the table, so to speak.” The alien had whirled around as he spoke, and started to raise its gun, only to collapse at Lestrade whacked it over the back of the head with his gun.
The Yrani said nothing, just stared at the table.
“Concern is irrelevant,” said Sherlock testily. “It has no bearing on the outcome.”
Mycroft followed him out. “Won’t this Trickster just find someone else?”
The Doctor shook his head. “It’s actually quite hard for him to manifest in this reality at all. He’s unlikely to try again here. John is safe.” He looked back at the door. “Please don’t kill it.”
Mycroft nodded. “Gregory, will you continue to stay with my brother? I don’t want him to be alone.”
It was about twenty minutes later when John’s breathing changed slightly, and his hand flexed in Sherlock’s. Sherlock watched him open his eyes, aware of an absurdly overwhelming feeling of relief. John blinked a few times dazedly, turned his head slightly, and looked at Sherlock. “Sher …” he whispered, and his eyes suddenly widened in alarm. “What happened to you?” he gasped, and started coughing, setting off an alarm on the machine recording his oxygen saturation level.
“Jesus!” swore Greg as he cut the ropes binding Sherlock’s wrists to the pipe. “Sherlock? Hey, can you hear me?”
One of the men punched him in the stomach. “Mind your manners!” snarled the thug.
Thank you to everyone who liked and commented on this story, I very much appreciate it.
Treschlkt stared at him, then at the Doctor. “Don’t look at me,” said the Doctor. “I’ve got no control over Mycroft.”
Suddenly the door banged, making them both jump. What seemed to John like a dark blur rushed past them, heading for a circular construction that had various switches and lights on the surface. “Time to go!” There was a pounding at the door, making John look back at it in alarm. “Temper!” shouted the blur.
“Spaceship?” exclaimed Sherlock.
“Will have different elements, that can show up when properly scanned,” the Doctor completed. “However, I’ve got some other ideas. Would you like to help me with an experiment?” He held the door wide.
Greg raised his head and watched Mycroft go. “Doesn’t he ever sleep?” he grumbled, getting up. “Hey, sunshine. I heard … alien? Really?” Sherlock groaned in reply. “Mate, I think he was right about pain relief. I’ll get a nurse, alright?”
“I’ll get you a drink,” he offered.
Moments later Sherlock started awake with a gasp. “You’re quite safe, Mr Holmes,” said the nurse calmly. “I’ll bring your breakfast.” She left without further comment.
Once in the lift Mr Sykes asked Greg if he was trained in firearms, and then said he would issue him with a weapon. He explained that they had authorization to use lethal force if required, that the primary objective was to locate the younger Mr Holmes, and the secondary objective to capture or eliminate Andrew Martin. Greg agreed without comment. He was not inclined to feel for the criminals after what he had seen on the recordings, and he had a feeling there had been more since what he had seen that Mycroft had not shown him. He was also aware that this situation fell very much outside his division and in the realms of terrorism and espionage. As far as he was concerned, these people had tortured one of his friends and possibly killed another. He would happily shoot them himself, given half the opportunity.
Lestrade glared. “They’re called phones, Mycroft! They’re used for communication!”
John looked around as he followed Sherlock down a dank alley. He took a deep breath. “Mm, eau de cat piss. I don’t know, Sherlock, you take me to the nicest places."
Mr Sykes approached them. “He’s ready for you, sir.”
“Usual rates and conditions, as you know, so don’t waste my time. Have you got something for me or not?”
“Further dehydration,” said Sherlock.
He stood up and removed the stone sphere from the desk, putting in its place a folder. Mycroft picked it up. “Torchwood?” He raised an eyebrow. “So does dear Kate know you’re giving this to me?”
John chuckled. “Us? It wasn’t me who was arrested for breaking into the chief constable’s house.”
“Yes,” said the Doctor.
“But …”
“Stop that, Thomas,” said Martin mildly. “I am trying to talk to Sherlock.” He smiled. “Now, Sherlock, it would appear that your brother loves his state secrets more than he does you.”
“You’re in pain, you’re covered in bruises, and the nurse mentioned stitches, so don’t give me that crap,” said John.
“Let me know what you find immediately,” Mycroft ordered, and hung up.
“That’s the one!” replied the Doctor cheerfully.
“On it,” said Greg, and ran.
She stared at this message in perplexity, and finally sent a couple of question marks.
“I solved the case, didn’t I?” remarked Sherlock loftily.
“Yes indeed,” said Mycroft.
The Doctor looked surprised. “Didn’t I say?” Amy and Rory exchanged a long-suffering look.
“No,” said Rory cheerfully. “I’m a nurse. So you’ll have to help me out, Doctor Watson.”
“Sorry, Mycroft. The Trickster doesn’t even exist in this reality, so he’s not a threat in the physical sense. He is very fond of messing with time, however. He always works through intermediaries, but the price of a soul is usually a bit more costly than mere money.”
“You’re not concerned by that?” asked the Doctor.
Mycroft inclined his head. “Your point is taken.” He paused. “Can you find him?”
The Doctor stared at him, and then seemed to remember he had not actually explained what was going on. “A Moldovan ship. On board is Doctor John Watson, being held by the crew because they think he has something they want. He doesn’t. However, I have found what they want and we are going to do a swap.” He tapped at some keys. “I’m sending them a request to come on board. They’ll be mulling it over.”
She passed Greg in the doorway. “Who’ll turn up?” asked Greg.
“The hell I don’t,” said John. “I’m not lying around while some alien wants to kill me.” He coughed.
The Doctor smirked. “Who hired you?”
“He’s looking better than the last time I saw him,” commented Rory.
“Andrew Martin was quite human,” Mycroft said. “The alien we are searching was impersonating Andrew Martin.”
“It does to me.”
“At least sit down, will you?”
Sherlock examined it. “Cloth, cotton, low thread count. Cheap dye, probably manufactured in China. Nothing unusual about it.”
“If you are referring to the man who was with you, he was not needed, so I killed him,” said the creature casually. “Shot him in the head, to be exact.”
The first thing he saw was Sherlock, stripped to his underwear and tied to a chair. Bruises covered his face and torso. Two men were flanking him, who Mycroft registered as being members of the group Sherlock was investigating. There was no sign of John. A voice came from off the screen. “This is Andrew Martin.”
Rory reluctantly resumed his seat. Amy was craning her head to look down at the street below. Two cars, one a taxi, were currently wrapped around each other in the intersection they were overlooking. There was a fair bit of shouting and car horns blaring. A small crowd had gathered to stare, with only a few approaching the cars trying to help.
Now you’re just being obvious, thought Sherlock. And you’d been rather clever up until now. “I’m not sure,” he whispered. “I’m so tired …”
John embraced him, and his hands touched the bandages on Sherlock’s back. He traced his hands over the bandages gently. “Whip?” he asked softly. Sherlock nodded. John lowered his head against Sherlock’s chest. “Bloody hell, again?”
Outside the door, Mycroft was saying, “Thank you for your assistance, Doctor. I trust my little brother wasn’t any trouble?”
“Not so fast,” said a second voice, one that sounded …. English. How is that possible? Might be a hallucination, he figured. “You let him go.” There was a pause where nothing happened. “Shame if I dropped this,” said the voice. Moments later he was face down on the deck again. “Rory?” said the English voice.
The Doctor nodded. “Oh yes. By not attacking the scientist, or her parents, but a doctor who saved her and her mother’s life because he was just passing by, you avoid any fixed point tampering issues. The Trickster knows this, of course.”
“This is Mycroft Holmes,” said the Doctor, indicating Mycroft, “and I’m the Doctor.” The Yrani’s gaze flicked up to him. “Yes, that Doctor,” said the Doctor. “What’s your name?"
The enclosure (he didn’t think it deserved to be called a room) was a mere two metres square. The ceiling was barely over his head when he stood up. The atmosphere was hot and humid. The only light was from under the door.
He would die in here, he knew. There was no hope of escape or rescue. If Sherlock was dead, and there was an afterlife, then maybe they would be together again. It was a nice dream.
“A friend?”
Mycroft shook his head. “No reason for you to be. Her connection to Sherlock and John is second hand, and old. The information about her was probably acquired from Doctor Watson’s blog.” He stood up. “We need to …” The lights went out.
“No, no, I promise …” There was a crack as the finger broke, and Sherlock screamed, cradling his hand. “Let me try again,” he begged, his voice shaking.
“I’ll be fine, John,” said Sherlock, trying to be reassuring. “It will heal. We will both heal.”
John nodded, turning to face Sherlock. “I think it’s only fair to warn you,” he said with a shaky smile, “that I may never turn the lights off again.”
Sherlock smirked. “Well you can blame Mycroft for this one.” He wrinkled his nose in distaste. “He’s taking revenge on us for Sheffield.”
Greg was bored. He knew Mycroft was right, and that he’d rather be there than watching telly in a safe house away from the action, but he’d always found checking CCTV footage profoundly tedious, however necessary. When he received a text from Mycroft asking him to come to his office, he jumped up at once. When he entered. he found Mycroft in conversation with Anthea and a man in a suit. “You wanted me?” he asked.
“Not those loonies!” exclaimed Treschlkt. “Him! The one who told me about it.”
He knocked on the door and entered, to find Mycroft glaring at Anthea. She, for her part, was looking entirely unfazed about this. “You left no instructions,” she pointed out.
Mycroft nodded. “Mrs Hudson and Dr Hooper have been taken to a safe house, and are well protected. However I believe you can be of assistance to me, and I assumed you would prefer to be involved." He turned to his computer. “I have been contacted.”
“Maybe the Moldovans were lying.”
“How long is this going to take?” asked Thomas after a few minutes.
“Go away,” said Sherlock, who then noticed John frowning at him. “Please,” he added. She ignored this, walking to the foot of the bed and making a note in John’s chart, and then crossing to Sherlock’s bed and scrawling something in his. Sherlock waited until she was gone before taking John’s hand again. He knew John was looking at him, but he couldn’t seem to raise his eyes from their joined hands. “I thought you were dead,” he told the hands.
Greg grinned. “Chicken.” He remembered why he came in. “I am a bit concerned about something, and I’m probably overreacting, but I thought I should tell you.” He ran through the text message conversation of the previous evening, the fact that Donovan was now absent from work and not responding to him, and that the text conversation had been uncharacteristic. Mycroft stared at Greg’s phone once he was done. “Am I overreacting?” Greg asked.
Sherlock nodded. “Yes. I’ll arrange it.”
“Well,” Dennis began, “I was reading the paper …” he commenced a long rambling story, and Donovan was just about to interrupt him, when she realised her head had unexpectedly hit the table. She only had a moment to be confused about this when darkness fell.
“Understood,” said Anthea. The footsteps receded.
“Very little,” said the Doctor. “There was a transporter trace near the shop where they were taken. I knew he’d been taken aboard a ship.”
Mycroft regarded him. “That was my initial conclusion. However, there is a … consultant assisting me in this, who believes John is still alive. He is very reliable. At this point I would have to say there is insufficient information.”
Infrared showed two warm bodies only in the house. One of the men in the van Greg was in stated that the house had a cellar, and they would not be able to see if anyone was in there. Mr Sikes said Sherlock (whom he was now referring to as ‘the package’, making Greg feel as if he had just strayed into a James Bond film), was likely being held there.
John was contemplating a tray of breakfast in the early morning without much enthusiasm. “I know you don’t feel like eating,” said the nurse. “If you just try a little bit it’ll be a start.” John nodded, and began to pick at the plate of scrambled egg in front of him. It was at that moment there was commotion from the other bed.
“They’re really not,” said Sherlock, and the Doctor looked affronted.
“Something did,” said the Doctor, a slight smile on his face as he studied Mycroft. “Something happened there that wasn’t supposed to happen. So I went there to find out, only to find your people crawling all over it. So what are you looking for?”
“We’re here to see the world changing,” said the Doctor cheerfully.
The puzzled expression dropped. “Please get out of my way. I am not here for you.”
Greg sat at the desk he’d been assigned in Mycroft’s department, frowning at the text messages he’d received the previous night. There was something odd, something he couldn’t put his finger on. He picked up the landline and dialled Sally’s number. The phone rang out. He frowned again. It should have gone to voicemail. Greg then rang another number, and spoke to Donovan’s sergeant, who said Detective Inspector Donovan had called in sick. Greg thanked them and hung up. She hadn’t mentioned being ill the previous evening, but everyone gets ill occasionally. He read through the text messages again. He then sent another text. Are you okay? While he waited for a reply, he reviewed the previous messages, wondering what it was that bothered him. It was odd she’d have such a conversation via text, as she would normally have phoned. Suddenly it hit him. Sherlock. She’d called him Sherlock. Not Freak. She never called him Sherlock. Lestrade had been at her for years to stop calling him Freak but at best she occasionally referred to him as Holmes. He had been mildly surprised she’d even referred to Sherlock on the message. Getting slow, Greg, he told himself, as he got up and went looking for Mycroft.
Lestrade had his gun out, standing between John and the door. The handle shook again, and then there was a thud, as if someone had tried to force the door.
Sherlock shook his head. “Not really.” He paused. “She’s close to Lestrade, though.” He grabbed his phone, just about to send a text when the phone rang. Sherlock frowned at it before answering. “Lestrade?”
“Oh, no!” exclaimed the Doctor. “Nothing like that! At least, I don’t think so,” he amended thoughtfully.
It was surprisingly difficult to suppress the urge to gulp, but John managed, and sipped the water. This brought on another paroxysm of coughing that left him feeling faint. There was another burst of loud groaning from the central console, a clunk, and the column stopped moving. “We’re here,” said the Doctor.
Rory was rummaging around in an ordinary looking medical bag, somewhat out of place in what appeared to be yet another spaceship.  How did they get onto another spaceship? Or maybe it was the same spaceship. He was feeling very confused. Rory took out a thermometer and put that in his ear. It beeped after a few moments and he grimaced at it.
“Then do what do I owe the pleasure?” enquired Mycroft.
“No!” scoffed the Doctor, and grinned cheerfully. “He came through the Cardiff rift. Well, I say he, but it would be a better description, biologically speaking.”
Sherlock replied, “Greg, if you hear Sally’s voice out there, do not open the door.” He paused, his eyes on the corpse. “It won’t be Sally.” He glanced at the Doctor, who nodded and returned to the living area. “We’re on our way.”
In the end it was all over in minutes. Only one of the two men pulled a gun, and he was shot and killed instantly. The other surrendered, begging not to be shot. After checking the rest of the house, Greg and one of the men descended to the cellar, still being careful, but they found it empty except for Sherlock. Andrew Martin was not there.
Lestrade pocketed the phone. “Fuck,” he said. He turned around. “You don’t have to get up.”
They watched, as John could be seen taking charge, ensuring an ambulance had been called, recruiting a couple of the bystanders to help the driver of the second car who seemed to be walking, at least, before crawling into the wrecked taxi.
“So you don’t know,” said John.
“Uh huh,” said the Doctor, grinning, as he followed.
In a cellar somewhere in London, Sherlock was handcuffed to an old pipe sticking out of the cellar wall. Should have gone for the throat, he thought, and shifted his feet slightly, doing his best to ignore the way they throbbed. Transport, he reminded himself. Only transport. He examined the handcuffs. They would have done better sticking to ropes, he thought.
“That the alien may look like Sally.”
After walking through a few alleyways, they stopped at what was obviously a back door to a shop of some sort. Sherlock took out his lock picks, and John kept an eye out. Within half a minute they were inside, and standing in a small store room. The shop, a grocers, was owned by one of the members and the group were known to meet there. Sherlock believed they would find information on the office computer that would give them some idea of group funding and activity. So that was where he headed. John was in the process of following him when he noticed one of the crates piled up in the storage room that seemed an odd shape. He looked around. He could not see a single cardboard box, as would be expected, just crates. John had an uneasy feeling, and looked about for some way to open the crate.
“Right in front of me, sir,” replied the agent.
The door of the materialised police box flew open and a young man in an old-fashioned jacket wearing a bow-tie bounced out. “Mycroft! Long time no see!”
Lestrade was about to answer when they heard footsteps in the hall, and then someone tried the handle. They stared silently at the door. “Hello?” came a voice that was distinctly familiar. “Doctor Watson? It’s Sally Donovan. Will you let me in?”
“Hm,” said the Doctor. “He must know there is information on him, but he doesn’t show his face. He identifies himself, and Sherlock immediately disagrees. During the … torture, Sherlock says only two words, ‘puce’ and ‘fake.’ Did you note this person’s voice?”
John whirled around to retort, then suddenly collapsed. Sherlock barely had time to react before he followed suit.
Lestrade took a deep breath and followed him. He sat down heavily in the chair Mycroft indicated. “You got any news? Because I’ve got nothing.”
He rose as an ambulance pulled up, followed by a fire engine. As they went to leave, Rory looked back to see the firemen and paramedics gathering around the car, no doubt to discuss the best way to extract the injured woman. A police car pulled up soon afterward, and the two officers were soon directing traffic and instructing the remaining rubberneckers to move on.
“No,” said Mycroft. “Out of character behaviour is always a red flag. What are you thinking?”
“Talent,” Sherlock replied promptly.
“They had no motive,” said the Doctor.
“Can we go away for a while? When we get out of here?”
“The man who saved me, Sherlock,” John said, “so be nice.” Mycroft smirked at Sherlock’s expression, as John said, “I didn’t get a chance to thank you.”
The Doctor looked at him curiously. “Why do you pretend you don’t care about people?”
Below they heard a voice rising over the racket. “Let me through, let me through please, I’m a doctor.”
“Him who?” demanded the Doctor.
“You’re overreacting,” Sherlock scoffed.
The corridor opened up into a wider area, and there was a louder sound of engine. Squinting at the light, he could vaguely make out three more aliens in his immediate vicinity, and two other humanoid shapes. Then … he heard English! “Well? Here is the human. Give us the heart!”
He was about to try and go back to work when his phone signalled an incoming text, which seemed to be from Sherlock’s mobile. Mycroft immediately ran another trace on Sherlock’s phone, but could still find no signal. Odd. Nobody in that group, including Andrew Martin, was that technologically adept. Did they hire someone? That could be traceable. He scanned the file for malware, and then opened it, to find a video file measuring 3 minutes. Bracing himself, he started the file.
“Yes,” said Mycroft. “They want classified information.” Suddenly he decided to show the Doctor the video. He hadn't had a chance to consider, but there was something very odd about it.
The Doctor smiled as John poked his head out of the taxi window long enough to gesticulate at a few other bystanders who jumped to do whatever he had asked. “In thirty-six years from now, the woman currently inside her mother’s womb, will receive a Nobel prize for physics, after discovering a method for accessing hyperspace, thus making interstellar travel possible. In forty-eight years from now, the first manned spaceships will leave your solar system. She will be brilliant, ahead of her time. Interstellar travel would still have come, but not quite so soon. What the Trickster thought to achieve by the delay I’m not sure. He may simply have been doing it for fun.”
He stood up and left. Mycroft sipped his brandy. Anthea entered. “UNIT will be sending a team to take possession of the alien,” she told him. “I have contacted Mrs Hudson and Dr Hooper, and they are getting ready to go home. All section heads have been advised to have their final reports in by the end of the day. The TARDIS has gone.” She looked at his glass. “I was going to offer tea.”
Sherlock was dragged into the room and deposited on a stool, unable to stop trembling with cold and pain. Damned transport had stopped listening to him some time ago. His hands were tied behind him, his captors having given up on handcuffs promptly after he broke his thumb and slipped them, following this up by stabbing Martin the neck with a rusty nail (the only sharp object he could find.) Everything else was hurting so much he barely noticed the pain from the break. Martin sat on a chair facing him on the other side of a table, with a bandage on his throat. He hadn’t been strong enough to do much damage this time, though he derived some satisfaction from the fact that the creature had said a little more than ‘ow’ this time. He wondered if such creatures could get tetanus and die that way. Damned transport not cooperating, he thought again. And now I’m repeating myself. Marvellous.
Mycroft was a little surprised that the Doctor would know anything about John. He nodded.
“Should you be walking?” asked the Doctor with interest as Sherlock hauled himself up the stairs.
“Oh,” John whispered. Sherlock raised John’s hand to his lips, and kissed it. John stroked his cheek. “I’m sorry, love,” he said. His eyes drooped.
“Rubbish,” muttered Sherlock, and was punched by one of the men.
Sherlock grimaced. “And you are very sick, and very weak. So what happened to you?”
“Where the hell are you?” hissed Lestrade. “Listen, there was a power cut and they believe someone’s in the building. I’m with John and we have the door locked. I think this tosser has done something to Sally.”
Sherlock pulled himself out of the wheelchair and put his arms around John, who leaned against him. He didn’t know what to say, so he said nothing.
Mycroft, after issuing instructions to Anthea regarding the alien, went in search of Lestrade, and found him in the building’s canteen, staring at a cooling cup of coffee. Mycroft slid into the seat opposite him. “I am sorry about Inspector Donovan, Gregory.”
“No murders,” Sherlock agreed.
Sherlock grimaced. “Amateurs with connections, apparently. And money.” And where is the money coming from? Does Andrew Martin have a backer? Who? “There might be some interest in this case after all,” he announced.
“Possibly.”
“It’s John.”
Greg could hear Mr Sykes on the phone as they made their way up the stairs. “Package recovered, Primary target in the wind, one secondary target eliminated, one apprehended. En route in five.”
“I’m very confused,” John admitted.
The Doctor shrugged. “The Yrani got away.” It wasn’t a question.
“I may die of boredom before this night is over,” Sherlock grumbled, and muttered something about fat gits thinking they’re funny. John was silent, letting him fume.
Too much of the cloak and not enough of the dagger, responded Greg.
A nurse rushed in. “Mr Holmes, what are you doing out of bed?” she scolded, as she went to John’s side. She raised his bed a little more and dialled up his oxygen. “Deep breaths, Doctor Watson. In and out, that’s it.” When John was more relaxed, and the reading back where it should be, the nurse turned back to Sherlock. “You’ll tear your stitches,” she said. “If you haven’t already.”
“Yes, Gregory,” said Mycroft. “We have a lead. Mr Sykes here will be taking a team to an address where one of the suspects has been sighted. I would like you to go with them. It is possible that Sherlock is there, and if so, I would like someone there he will recognize.”
Sherlock shook his head. Martin grabbed his little finger and bent it back. “Are you sure?”
“How does it work?”
“That’s what someone else is trying to do,” the Doctor said. “and if they succeed it will be bad. End of the world bad.”
“I like trouble,” said the Doctor. “We had loads of fun.”
The Doctor nodded. “It could be important, Kate. What was that mission about?”
“What date is it?” asked the Doctor. Mycroft, used to this kind of question, told him.
Donovan raised an eyebrow. Uncharacteristic. Dennis was a stingy sod normally. “That’s very generous of you,” she said suspiciously. “I’ll pass. What have you got for me, Dennis?”
“Late,” said Mycroft, picking up a chair which he placed next to the bed.
“No doubt it will have changed its identity by now,” Mycroft said. “It will make it difficult to find. I have people looking.”
“Yeah, you’re really not,” said Greg.
“The same way every other alien does, I would imagine,” said Mycroft drily.
Kate rolled her eyes and led the way into her office. She settled behind her desk. “So, alien invasion immanent?”
“Go back to bed, Sherlock,” John replied.
The light wasn’t quite so harsh in here, and soon John managed to open his eyes a little more. He saw a man with brown hair and a kind face looking at him. “My name’s Rory Williams. I’m going to check you over, okay?”
Sherlock was fully well aware he was being side-tracked, but he was curious. “Yes.”
“You a doctor?” whispered John.
Mycroft could hear Lestrade’s voice from the corridor before he even entered the room. “Yeah, well maybe MISTER Holmes could try phoning people instead of kidnapping them off the street!”
He joined the Doctor at the door, who was holding the machine. “It can’t change its face again?”
Martin grinned at him. “It’s not like the movies, Thomas. These things take time. We have to be patient.”
“I thought Christmas was a locked room triple homicide,” commented Greg, eliciting a small smile from Mycroft. “Seriously, is he safe with this guy?”
Lestrade appeared. “God, is that John?” he asked in shock.
Rory suddenly remembered something. “You said you needed my expertise. Oh god, have they tortured him?”
“Rory!” said the Doctor happily, looking around.
Understood, she replied. Well, enjoy MI5 headquarters.
“Just like that?” Rory queried, suspicious.
He saw them when he was first brought on board, and knew it had something to do with the crashed ship in Afghanistan. What, he couldn’t imagine. They gave him no food, but water was occasionally pushed through a slot in the door. The water appeared to be drugged, as it was always after this that the voice came through a speaker, asking the same question each time. “Where is the heart of the ancestors?” Each time he informed the voice that he had no idea what it was talking about. Then he would lie on the floor and wait for the dizziness and nausea to stop. He had no choice but to drink the water, however. He would already be dead from dehydration without it. As it was he could tell by the swelling in hands and feet that what they were giving him was nowhere near enough.
“Take it by the ends and hold it out for me.” Sherlock did so, and the Doctor aimed his sonic screwdriver at it. Sherlock found himself holding two pieces of cloth.
Only a small pursing of the lips, as well as the aforementioned glare, betrayed Mycroft’s annoyance. “Sherlock appropriated a wheelchair and was last seen entering the Doctor’s TARDIS. The TARDIS has now gone.” He gave a small sigh. “Sherlock must think it’s Christmas.”
Sherlock rolled his eyes to show his opinion of Mycroft’s people. “Gold from another planet …”
The Doctor shrugged. “I was in the neighbourhood.”
“A cyber-terrorist,” said Mycroft. “Essentially an anarchist, against government in general. His file lists him as being involved in computer hacking, mainly to crash systems and block services by denial-of-service attacks. He has ties to various activist groups who advocate a more hands-on approach than merely protesting.”
“I’m not telling you that,” said the Doctor. “That technology won’t be available on this planet for another two centuries.”
One hour later Detective Inspector Donovan got into her car and picked up her phone. She listened to some messages, and then opened text messaging to her sergeant. She sent a message with a strong complaint about Dennis stringing her along and how she must be getting old for falling for it. She sent the message. A few minutes later she received a response, acknowledging the message.
Lestrade turned around, to see John putting an oxygen mask to his face. He waved away Lestrade’s concern. “I’m okay.”
“Oh, well … you know, this and that,” said Sherlock evasively. “Annoying people, you know how I am.”
“That will be all.”
Rory stared. “John?”
“No.”
Rory pinched the skin on the back of John’s hand. It failed to rebound for a few seconds. He got up and went towards where the man with the bow tie was approaching. “He needs antibiotics, fluids, oxygen … basically he needs hospital.”
Sherlock was opening his mouth to insult Mycroft, when a new voice broke in. “Um, hello?”
Treschlkt went back to staring at the table. The Doctor glanced at Mycroft, shrugging.
“Okay,” said Rory. He supposed that Doctor Watson being held by aliens was not the weirdest thing he’d ever heard.
“Kidnapping, human trafficking, torture, extortion, espionage, murder, and assault,” said Mycroft. “And you are not a citizen of any country. You don’t exist, and therefore, no laws protect you.”
“Well I’ll just be glad when I can climb out of the rabbit hole and go back to catching murderers,” said Greg.
“Well, Sherlock’s quite right,” said the Doctor. “That’s not your Andrew Martin. That’s not even a human being.” He looked a bit puzzled. “That voice is not synthesized, and it definitely did not come from a human throat. And puce? Well, I know of only one race whose skin could be described like that. How would he get here, I wonder?”
Mycroft nodded. “We have checked all nearby dealers, but we cannot find him. He obviously had his own source. There is a watch on the house, but we don’t expect him to return.” He was worried about how hollow Sherlock sounded, and he knew the reason. “There is something you need to know.”
“Hm,” said the Doctor. “forty-fifth century.” He turned to Mycroft. “The Yrani were very militarized for some centuries, due in part to a squabble with a neighbouring planet. Everyone was given some sort of military training.” He looked back at Treschlkt. “You’re obviously not trained in infiltration, because this attempt was ham-fisted at best.” The Yrani scowled at him. The Doctor continued. “May I see your wrists?”
“You can’t guard the whole world, Mycroft,” said Greg. He took a swig of brandy. “She didn’t deserve that.”
John was about to tell her not to touch him, but she seemed to know this, standing just out of reach and calling, “Mr Holmes! Mr Holmes, you’re dreaming, wake up!”
“Of course you did,” Mycroft replied wearily.
He returned to the cellar where the human prisoner had been placed, to find one of his followers outside the door with a mug of coffee. Martin wrinkled his nose. “Must you drink that disgusting stuff?” he demanded.
The door suddenly popped open, the lock making a hissing sound. Sally Donovan stood in the doorway, holding a gun. Greg levelled his gun at her. “Gregory?” she asked with a puzzled expression. “Why are you pointing a gun at me?”
“No,” Mycroft admitted. “This is an escalation for him, and a massive escalation for the others in the group he took over.”
“Sherlock,” said the Doctor. “And … John Watson?”
Anthea poked her head in the door. “Tea, please,” said Mycroft.
“Poor man,” murmured Amy. “So, the woman is important?”
The Doctor chuckled unexpectedly. “Must be the cheapest deal he ever made.”
“Trickster?” enquired Mycroft.
“And … now!” said the Doctor.
Sorry, Sally, that’s not something I’m allowed to discuss, unfortunately. You know how it is.
The alien had been living on Earth for a little over three years, since he had inexplicably found himself there for no reason he could ascertain. At the time of his unexpected departure from his planet he had been carrying a bag containing the various tools of his trade, and luckily he still had this. Otherwise he was not sure he would have survived, and not been killed by the fearful natives. As it was he was able to quickly blend in, and eventually, after some time getting used to the place and the various languages, he began to work again at what he did best. He soon established himself with a solid reputation for resolving problems and supplying goods to those who could pay, both locally and off-planet. He lived very well on the proceeds, but it was only fair, he thought. If he had to be stuck on this backward planet why shouldn’t he live large?
“So is he so mad that he’s sending us after terrorists with no back up?” John asked idly.
The Doctor nodded. “The Moldovans have plenty of gold deposits and are quite rich. They must have paid the Yrani in gold. Mycroft’s people are looking into that.”
“Doctor Watson? The blogger?” asked Rory.
Greg nodded. “Sure, that’s great.”
“And just who are you?” demanded Sherlock haughtily.
“Very good, John, there’s hope for you yet.”
John had been contemplating the unspoken information that the Moldovans would have eventually killed him one way or the other, and almost missed it. “Wait … Andrew Martin is an alien?”
His brother and his partner were missing, and he had not known until Mrs Hudson called Inspector Lestrade that morning saying that they had not come home, and Lestrade had called him. He knew Sherlock had been planning to investigate the store the previous evening, and CCTV footage found them entering the alley to the back entrance, and a van pulling out less than thirty minutes later. Both Sherlock and John’s phones were showing no signal.
The Doctor sat back in his seat. “Ah.”
“I am painfully aware of my responsibility here,” said Mycroft, “but Sherlock, John is not dead.”
Sherlock joined him at the door to the bedroom, saw the body on the bed, and gave a short intake of breath. The Doctor looked surprised for a moment, and then frowned. “You know her,” he said.
"What do they usually say?" John asks the obvious question.
He came back down to see Sherlock still trying to somehow make all his assorted belongings fit into one side of the room and failing miserably. John dropped a pillow sporting the union jack onto the squishier of the two chairs before going to sit in it. If Sherlock was as observant and clever as he seemed to think he was in his website's essays, he'd probably take that as a hint that John wouldn't mind if he took up more than exactly half the space so long as John's fewer possessions had a place and their shared space was still functional. If not, John would just have to say it outright, but first they'd each have to finish sorting out who the other was and which bedroom they'd be taking, among other fine points. No point in needlessly giving up a potential bargaining chip, after all.
him?” said Sherlock, visibly alarmed. “You’d met before you died? What, in Afghanistan?”
“My turn for the personal questions,” said Sherlock, still looking at his tea. He set the cup down on the table. “Are you scared of me?”
“I have no doubt your recollections could prove valuable,” said Sherlock. “For now, until I am able to secure greater access to information, I would ask you simply refrain from calling attention to the fact that you aren’t dead. Don’t call your brother—“
Lestrade had looked over Sherlock’s shoulder to read the note. “What’s that about?” he said. “Sounds like a date invite more than a puzzle. Any ideas?”
plays quietly in the background
For his part, Sherlock felt at rather a loss.
Moriarty couldn’t know. He couldn’t know. He
“Holy shit,” he gasped finally.
“Sherlock—“ tried John again. What could he do? Other than warn Sherlock what Mycroft thought…
Sherlock had no idea what John was talking about.
“Oh for God’s sake.” Sherlock rolled his eyes and pointed at the door. “One of Gruner’s victims has broken in and is quite literally beating the
“If he does start to go after the remaining members of the Black Lotus, Moriarty will use his sniper, in all likelihood,” said Sherlock. “So you’re proposing to help me find the sniper before he finds the Black Lotus.”
“Probably wise,” said Mycroft, his demeanor reverting back to his usual rigidity with the speed of a taut rubber band snapping against skin. He climbed into the back of the car that Sherlock had opened for him.
“Fine,” said Sherlock. “Just fine.”
Sherlock sighed and swung his leg up, fast and hard, in a high kick that made his muscles scream, so that his foot just connected with the man’s abdomen.
“You can’t put personal feelings aside here,” interrupted John. “Personal feelings are the
Lestrade looked skeptically from Sherlock to John, but John jerked his head once in mute support of Sherlock’s assertion, and Lestrade moved on.
Since his Gift prevented Sherlock from safely dragging John down the stairs by the arm, Sherlock was forced to resort to barreling back down the stairs, pausing once or twice to bounce impatiently on the balls of his feet. The two men exited the building—John regretting being barefoot—and Sherlock immediately slammed the door and spun around to point accusingly at the dark paint.
“Hypocrite.”
“Shit,” said John against the hand muffling his voice, as something bit the skin on the side of his neck. He struggled more furiously—or, he thought he did, except his arms were suddenly weighed down with lead and his head was ringing.
So it was that three days, two hours, and twenty-seven minutes after Sherlock Holmes first introduced himself to the DI, Sherlock Holmes entered the crime scene.
The office was as large and pompous as the rest of the building, and looking around it, John got the distinct impression that Mycroft did not bring a lot of people here for a chat. The walls were lined predominantly with bookshelves and fancy looking filing cabinets, leaving room for the occasional soulless painting and a solitary window. A small pot of rather miserable-looking, wilting pansies sulked on the windowsill.
The facts were these:
They were all infuriatingly well trained. And he was still getting over being thrown about and drugged the first time. Not to make excuses, of course. However—
Sherlock visibly stiffened—John, following him, could see the way the line of his shoulders changed—but carried on after Lestrade. John stopped, turning his head to see who’d spoken.
“Ah,” he said, and his voice scratched as if he’d recently cleaned his throat with sandpaper.
“Yeah,” said John. “I’m not a giant prick.”
“And I’m going to guess from your tone that some major, unforeseen upheaval isn’t exactly likely.”
with the dead cabbie.
“Hm? You mean a client?” Mrs. Hudson frowned slightly and shook her head. “No. You know I don’t let people in to your rooms when you’re out, and I have them stay downstairs if they want to wait for you to return. But I’ve been in all morning, and it’s been very quiet. Are you expecting someone?”
There was an instant change in Sherlock’s thoughts. His heart, weighed down with leaden disappointment one second before suddenly leapt into his throat. “Tell me.”
Lestrade’s team continued working in the background, though John saw a man and woman stop and look over at Sherlock the moment he spoke.
Well. The cabbie’s death resolved one of the day’s uncertainties. The remaining list—which included but was not limited to how to keep Lestrade oblivious to all of this, how to get John Watson out of the morgue, and what he would actually do with John once he’d done so—was a little too long for his taste.
“Don’t issue ultimatums,” said Sherlock, although the corner of his mouth twitched upwards in a faint hint of a smile.
Think
Sherlock paused. Perhaps John needed to reassure himself of some details. Such as the date. It couldn’t do much harm so long as proper caution was employed, Sherlock reasoned. He gestured to the table by the window. “It’s on and open. You won’t need a password. Remember—
“Good to know arguing with me requires the same mental fortitude as invading Afghanistan,” Sherlock grumbled.
, I’m going to be really annoyed.”
John frowned. “I’m not loving the sound of this plan.”
war.”
“Talk to me,” John urged. “You haven’t calmed down at all since the pool. Actually, you’re way less calm, and frankly, I didn’t think that was possible. So talk to me. Tell me what I’m missing.”
“Don’t be a smart-arse.”
“Was it worth sacrificing Gruner, just to get a glimpse of how I live?” probed Sherlock, raising an eyebrow. “He made you millions.”
“Of course you didn’t, but I can’t take credit,” said Sherlock. “Then I’d have to make statements and fill out paperwork. And anything that connects me to Jeff Hope here is just another way in which this Moriarty can realize I’m on to them.”
Sherlock hesitated, and then he said, without a modicum of emotion behind it, “I was hired by the British secret service to handle his case outside the official channels, which you obviously hacked into long ago.”
Sherlock ignored him.
Sherlock shrugged, trying to seem nonchalant even though the memory of the panic that had flooded his system made him feel strained all over again. “I only realized it was a real possibility in the last five minutes or so of my being there. And maybe only seriously considered it for the last two minutes and forty seconds.”
Sherlock’s phone buzzed again, and Sherlock snatched it up off the table and hurled it across the room without looking at it.
. He was almost impressed.
“Then at least try to be patient with the rest of us for exhibiting the appropriate amount of caution
“Swank. He was convinced I couldn’t figure it out,” shrugged Sherlock. “Idiot. He was disappointed when I didn’t show up yesterday because he wanted me to not know the answer. Murderers always assume that no one will trace it back to them if they report the disappearance. Classic stupid. Thankfully John is decently observant and I have a good set of lock picks.”
“The problem is that none of this helps us find Moriarty
Watson processed this for a moment, and finally grinned. "Great. Great, well. Thanks, Sherlock." He seemed to hesitate for a moment, and then he stuck out a hand.
John shrugged and said, trying for a smile, “Probably for the best that professionals did it. And it’s fine that Mycroft’s lot didn’t get here in time to see you ripping my clothes off in a darkened swimming pool. People might’ve talked.”
of what
“Worried, then. Concerned. Aware and accordingly cautious,” amended John indifferently.
“That much is obvious. You should make tea,” said Sherlock, heaving an impatient sigh. “You’re undoubtedly going to want it before we begin discussing things. Kettle should still be hot if you would like; I needed it earlier to heat water to disinfect my petri dishes.”
, without thinking, without processing. His Gift, his power, was bringing back the dead, not seeing the future—but, in a way, his
The blur, which had coalesced into a lanky male with stringy brown hair, a big chin, and wearing a mismatched outfit including a bow tie, was racing around the circular device flicking switches. The most appalling noise started, and the column in the middle of the device began moving up and down. “On our way.”
“Sorry, boss,” the man answered, putting the mug aside. “He’s been pretty quiet after the kicking we gave ‘im.” He grinned.
“Have you forgotten John is ill?” said Rory.
Somehow they were through another door and into a very different space, very wide with a high ceiling. “Here we go,” said the man. “Sit down.” It was an armchair, by the feel of it. So comfortable. His feet were raised. Oh, it’s a recliner. I really am dreaming.
Sherlock easily hacked the computer password, and was scrolling through the information. The usual radical rhetoric, he thought in disgust. No Islam influence but Mycroft already knew that. Just home-grown radicals wanting a world free of capitalism, with the obligatory Marxist rhetoric. Very dull. He looked up when John came into the room in a hurry. Sherlock had been unaware until that moment that John had not followed him, but said “just as tedious as I predicted.”
“Gold,” said the Doctor, standing at the door of the TARDIS.
“We will,” said one of the medics. Soon enough they injected him with something, sedative or pain killer he was not sure, and then made ready to move him.
Sherlock began to poke at the keys painfully. His bruised and swollen eyes made visibility limited, and he hunched towards the screen in an effort to see what he was doing.
“Could whoever it was have found a location through the texts?”
“Pot, kettle,” mumbled John, suddenly very exhausted. “Where have you been, you git?”
“There’s a woman trapped in the back of the taxi,” reported Amy.
“It was just here,” Lestrade called out. “It’s impersonating Sally Donovan.”
“Secure him properly!” Martin shouted, heading for the door. “I’m going to put a bandage on this.”
John nodded in agreement. He looked distressed. “I didn’t know what had happened to you. I didn’t think I was ever going to see you again, Sherlock. I didn’t care I was going to die, just that you would never know.”
The 'B' flat was on the first floor of the building. The main area was quite nice, and John said as much. The one-wall eat-in kitchen and spacious, irregularly shaped sitting room were separated by glass-backed shelving that made the place feel bright and open even stuffed as full of odds and ends as it was. The other walls were covered in slightly dated, but rather pleasant, patterned wallpaper with a very attractive fireplace near the entrance from the stairwell. A pair of armchairs, side tables, and a coffee table were nestled in front of the fireplace beneath a layer of boxed papers in various states of disarray. A couch hid around a corner from the entrance with a small TV and writing desk between the two seating areas in the odd shaped room, also covered in a thin layer of odds and ends that would need to be cleared away. The furniture was a mis-matched jumble that spanned several decades of popular style, but similar colors made them work well together. Bohemian, John thought the proper term was, or maybe eclectic; a bit lived-in and that was quite attractive after the sterile matchboxes he'd been living in. It was when Sherlock admitted that the many boxes of stuff crowding up the place and the copious amount of chemistry supplies on the dining table were his own possessions - that he'd moved in already - that finally brought the younger man's odd eagerness to have John move in with him to John's full attention. There was something off about how Sherlock reacted to the possibility of John not wanting to move in due to the clutter. It wasn't Sherlock's hurried attempt to tidy up (particularly given how comically ineffectual it was) as much as the stunned moment just before and the slightly frantic and mechanical way the man went about trying to fix it.
"Brilliant, you called Lestrade?" John asked. Sherlock pushed the handle of the case at John's free hand.
"It's all just transport," Sherlock deflected. "The brain is what counts."
"Yes," John agreed immediately, "I suppose it does." Sherlock steers the shorter man into Angelo's and goes directly for his preferred table. He drops into a chair facing away from the large plate glass window and urges John into the seat across from him.
"You're awake," Sherlock said around a yawn.
"Serial killers – always hard. Have to wait for them to make a mistake." John follows his curly head from above as he spirals down the stairs.
"Wait. You haven't eaten today? For God's sake, you need to eat," John sounds worried. He is a doctor, he would have that reaction to anyone saying such a thing.
"Right then," Sherlock said decisively, then started running through the logic aloud in order to properly refocus his mind on the things that mattered. "You have a point about getting into position before we trigger the killer. There were a few options I had for a stakeout location, but I've narrowed down the parameters considerably. We have no way to know how much she told the killer prior to her death. Best to go closer to the city center, as it won't be credible if we try to lure him out this far. It must seem to come from the victim, you understand, so it can't be far from where she would have been staying. Angelo is quite happy to let me use his place of business for such things on occasion, providing an ideal location."
"What? What is it? What, what, what?" Lestrade excitedly talks over John, leaning over the banister next to him as Sherlock twirls his way down the stairway, stripping off his gloves.
"Mr. Cotton was killed by the mother in an emotional rage after he found out that the meat company was not keeping up their food safety standards and started threatening to go public if the slack wasn't taken up.  The blackmail letters the aunt had sent were discovered while the mother was trying to clean up the mess, and she called her eldest daughter and lied about the motive for the murder to enlist her help. He was skinned by the elder daughter, who was an accomplished amateur chef, in an effort to erase the damning evidence and protect her mother. Any hassle the blackmail letters might cause the aunt wasn't worried about and they assumed that she would be able to provide a strong alibi to go with the lack of any evidence the aunt had ever visited the flat. Three sisters to blame, but none of them was the actual killer."
"Doctor Watson, what do you think?" Sherlock asks just after John has concluded that he can't figure it out.
"He isn't just gonna ring the doorbell, though, is he? He'd need to be mad," John asked as he pulled out his phone charger and tucked his bag under the table.
"It isn't about being ashamed," John clarified. "Just, I found that letting women know I was Bi made them stick me in the 'sassy gay friend' category and, well, when you've only got a three day pass it's practically impossible to get over that wall. Whenever word got around, I might as well have been a pot plant for all the attention I'd get, and not just from potential dates. Hard to strike up a working relationship when your co-workers barely talk to you."
"I'm sorry?" Lestrade asks, clearly taken aback.
"Loss of fine motor skills due to complications from a botched bullet removal," John explained. The abrasive woman really deserved a bit of her own attitude handed back to her. "Want to have a go at my cane, too?"
John was even willing to help with The Work, putting in quite the effort not to be left behind despite a less than stellar showing at the crime scene even granting that it was possibly his first time seeing a dead body outside a hospital or battlefield setting. The praise that spilled so honestly and easily out of the man's mouth was incomprehensible. Sherlock hadn't the faintest idea what to do with it, except that when John suggested that he could stop Sherlock felt an urgent need to ensure the man did no such thing. John's psychosomatic limp ensured the shorter man could not properly assist Sherlock's search for the pink suitcase, but the regular texts exchanged between them so his tail wouldn't get lost were both occasionally amusing and rather helpful in ensuring he took the most efficient path in his search by forcing him to consider not only the swiftest path to each darkened alley he could chart, but also to continually recalculate the path someone on a street needed to take. That shuffled some of the likely hiding places down to possible and some of the possible ones to unlikely. It only took a little more than half an hour to locate the dead woman's suitcase, a feat which was noted by John with immediate praise. Praise that lit up parts of Sherlock's psyche that had been left dark and disused for years and that he had never managed to get to work 'normally' according to a hoard of therapists and rehab specialists. It almost made how distracting the man was worth it all by itself.
"Not in a police car. I'll be right behind," Sherlock agrees, his face painted with the same mild expression he'd had since spotting what must have been a police car with flashing lights out of the window.
"That's fine," John murmured as the distance between them closed properly, "we've got plenty of time."
"If that's what it takes," the detective tells his subordinate with a little shrug.
"Pink... Media..." John mutters to himself, looking back through his notes as the forensics team gets to work looking for trace evidence. The talent for shorthand he'd developed in medical school served him well, he'd hardly been thinking about it as he scribbled out the details with his off hand without sullying his sterile working hand. "Oh, Anderson, you need to change your left glove, if you haven't already."
"Oh, I see," Sherlock says, his words slurred as he watches the man from his sideways perspective. He points a finger towards the cabbie, which wavers drunkenly. "So you're a proper genius too."
"You said you could identify a software designer by his tie and – what was it? – a retired plumber by his left hand," John says incredulously.
All of Sherlock's flats had been similar: places with the cheapest rent he could find. He would not leave London, he barely made enough to feed himself with The Work, and his trust fund had remained heavily restricted despite having properly gotten out of rehab six years ago. The only drug paraphernalia he kept on hand was for use as barter with his contacts, and there was nothing he was inclined to use himself in that box. He was clean, but if he could not provide for himself according to Mycroft's standards, then he'd be forced to attend a Family Dinner. Whatever well-meaning interference in his life such an event would result in was to be avoided at all costs.
"I'm his doctor." Oh, but that is a lovely thought.
"And only a fool argues with his doctor," Sherlock adds without missing a beat.
"Proper tools for the autopsy," he explained when Sherlock gave him a raised eyebrow. The brilliant smile he received warmed John all the way through, though that didn't stop him from going to make a pot of fine loose-leaf tea for them to share. Sherlock put on trousers and a rather worn button-down to perform the autopsy, his sleeves rolled up the way he only did when working at home. He absolutely refused to permanently damage any of the knitting and was careful to cut only the nylon threads holding the pieces together and leave any connected organs as they were. This meant coaxing the stomach contents up through the esophagus or through the gaps between the stitches and ensured that it took much longer than John expected.
"Thank you." The man looks around and finally spots John and Mrs. Hudson. With a polite nod he turns and leaves the room. Biting his lip to hold back a delighted smile, Sherlock waits until the man is properly gone before raising his fists triumphantly and leaping into the air like his favorite team just won the regional and he'd had a sizable bet on the match.
"No, you need to eat. I need to think. The brain's what counts. Everything else is transport," Sherlock dismisses, taking his attention away from the street long enough to make proper eye contact and get his point across. A crease appears between John's eyebrows and his mouth turns down into a disapproving frown. Angelo comes back just then with a taper candle stuck in the neck of a bottle and sets it on the table.
"Where is it?"
"I was right? Right about what?" John asks, winding the conversation back and picking through the details again, feeling a bit slow and not minding it for the first time in months.
"Who are you?"
"Why?" Lestrade asks, still leaning on the banister at the top of the stair.
"You're still closeted? I was under the impression the military was all about equality these days." Flustered from the fumbled joke, Sherlock voiced his thoughts without any filter. The look John shot him was sharp and shrewd, far more alert than he'd seemed even back at the crime scene. It faded quickly into John's usual agreeable expression.
That germinating idea was quickly pushed aside by the landlady, Mrs. Hudson, making assumptions about how many bedrooms they would need. That was certainly an alternate solution to the mystery of why Sherlock seemed so keen on John moving in, but despite having had plenty of success in that area over the years he rather doubted Sherlock found him terribly appealing. He hadn't been dressed to impress when they met at Bart's, a depressed mood colored with embarrassment was the opposite of sexy, and neither of them had done anything that was identifiable as flirting. John had enjoyed a lot of female company in the bedroom, something that was well-known about him among his old buddies in and around London, so if Sherlock had somehow gotten a bit of gossip about his potential flatmate beforehand it wouldn't have led him in that direction. Not that he was bigoted, not at all. It was just that anyone who was a bit (or a lot) bent in the Army tended to keep their mouths shut about it and never mind how tolerant the official stance on such things was. It had been half a decade for John, and anyway he was fairly certain there wasn't anyone currently on this continent that knew how open-minded John was on that front, let alone any telling detail still lingering about his person all these years later. So, that theory was properly out.
Even if he ignored his surgeon's training and managed to get a position as a GP, people didn't like taking health advice from sick doctors. John wasn't about to hang his Army Cross up on the wall as a tacit explanation. Some people would consider it an invitation to talk about it, and John wasn't keen on that at all. Perhaps once Holmes moved on it would be the start of a series of flat-mates for John, but that was a young man's game, wasn't it? He didn't relish the idea of sharing space with a string of university students or managing a sub-lease when an empty bedroom for too long would mean a hasty relocation. A more stable situation would be better, something that would hold for a few years at least so that all John's long-term savings would open up. Stupid investment fees, stupid financial advice having him stuff all his money in long-term accounts, stupid occasionally-thieving drunk sister forcing him to guard his checkbook by keeping the balance on his primary spending account as low as was feasible. Sure, today was a good day, unlike yesterday when he'd been hobbling around at a snail's pace. He could probably do without the cane for a bit if he really tried today. That was the way of mobility issues even when they weren't 'all in your head,' but it was hardly enough of a sure thing to leave the cane behind.
"What the hell is he doing up there?" Lestrade says at the same time Donovan bursts out indignantly.
"I know
"Sherlock!" the loud, boisterous voice of the restaurant's owner interrupts the conversation. Angelo continues in a lower, more conspiratorial tone. "Anything on the menu, whatever you want, free. All on the house, for you and your date."
"Are you all right?"
221 Baker Street turned out to be a well-kept brick building with a little sandwich shop on the street level. Holmes stepped out of a cab just as John was coming down the block from the nearest Tube station, wearing his expensive coat over a very nice suit in stark contrast to John's worn jacket, jumper and jeans. There had been an advert up for the place at some point saying it came fully furnished, but the website had it listed as taken and there was no figure published for the requested rent. An upside-down real estate sign in the window above the sandwich shop told John that the flat wasn't properly on the market at the moment. They exchanged greetings, each awkwardly glad to see the other in the way of perfect strangers who expected to be stood up. Holmes insisted on being called Sherlock as they rung the bell, explaining briefly that he'd secured a discounted rate by ensuring the landlady's husband was convicted of murder. Right then.
"Aneurysm," the cabbie confirms with a smile. He lifts his right hand and taps the side of his head. Sherlock smiles in satisfaction. "Right in 'ere. Any breath could be my last. It's your own 'ope, Mr. 'olmes. Bet on the aneurysm."
"I would think that it would be perfectly obvious that it wasn't a real corpse. I might have the permits to perform small scale experiments..." Sherlock began.
"Do you think so?" he asks despite himself.
"Just a few more minutes, then we can begin. We'll need to be ready to get into position," Sherlock said to refocus their attention on the case, keeping his eyes on the point of light on the tabletop created by the light bending as it passed through his water. He lessened pressure on his arm and took a breath as the initial rush of nicotine in his system started to stabilize. "I am almost certain this will work. There is the slight chance that the phone was also dumped, but then it would have been in the same skip as the suitcase. Perhaps he's taken a trophy. Escalating behavior, possible after getting away with it repeatedly. Greater possibility he didn't see it in his car even after he remembered the suitcase."
"Wouldn't be a game if you knew. You're the one who chooses," the elderly cabbie keeps up the rapid-fire explanation.
"He would say we had a screaming fight in the common room about him coming out as a male, but really he just shouted at me about how bisexuals don't actually exist until I punched the table and left. While informing me he was leaving me for a woman, because he was, and I quote, 'still straight,' to put the cherry on top the shit sundae."
"The article was absurd," John declares.
"I need to think, John," Sherlock insisted. "I need to craft a stimulus I can be certain the killer will respond to predictably that would not cause an innocent man to act in similar fashion. I've been constructing a profile of the killer, but there is now a mistake and new behavior to consider. I'm nearly certain, but there are a few additional possibilities I need to visualize before I can move forward." John nodded in response. After a moment he turned back to the kitchen.
"What?" Anderson said, whirling back toward the landing.
"Oh, we're done waiting! When she was found, she couldn't have been here long, is that right?" Sherlock stops descending and leans into the center of the stairwell to look up at them.
"You'll have to charge it," Sherlock sighed, deeply disappointed. He didn't have a cable for that brand of phone and it would be useless to implement his plan without a reliable and unknown cell phone. "My number is listed on my website, there is always the chance it will be recognized."
"I ran after the cab, called the police, of course, and then I thought, better keep an eye on you," John explains, almost as if he hadn't heard what Sherlock had just said. Sherlock looks at him closely.
"Sherlock explained to me that he'd gotten a corpse for his birthday this morning," Greg said.
"'The Science of Deduction.' Now that is proper thinking. Between you and me, why can't people think?" a hint of real anger comes into the man's placid and patronizing voice, his face scrunching. "Don't it drive you mad? Why can't people just think?"
"Good, that's good," John agreed with a decisive nod. "Care to try it again?"
"That's rich coming from you," Anderson answered with a vague gesture that might or might not be pointing at John's gloved hand holding his ratty notebook or the cane propped next to the railing he was leaning on.
"He was utterly confident he'd always win," Sherlock mused. "That makes the challenge harder to back down from, for a large number of people. He chose his victims partially based on their psychology to ensure the victims wouldn't back down from the challenge, which he was quite skilled at assessing. His power to manipulate people, at least while they were inebriated, meant that he could be quite certain they would act as he wanted them to. In another life, he could have been a skilled mentalist or politician of some sort."
"I was thinking," Sherlock said, reflexively. He'd spent most of the cab ride thinking, though that had been productive as it was focused on the case and not a deluge of rubbish he didn't need cluttering up his mind. He needed a fag.
"It is mostly, I suppose. We do nothing without asking for and receiving permission - verbal permission and with no ambiguity or deductions - and make it clear where the boundaries are, both the hard limits and the more flexible ones. Then we respect those boundaries and talk about it if they change. For example: I'm going to have to give anything penetrative a hard pass, at least for now. I may have sorted out that I was bisexual in theory, but I've never put it into practice and I don't know how much time I might need to adjust," John said as calmly as he could, though he was blushing brightly enough Sherlock could probably feel the heat from his perch on the far end of the couch.
"Her wedding ring – look at it. It's too tight. She was thinner when she first wore it; that says married for a while. Also, there's grime in the gem setting. The rest of her jewelry's recently been cleaned; that tells you everything you need to know about the state of her marriage," Sherlock answers, stabbing an irritated finger toward the woman's left hand. John shakes his head with an admiring smile. The taller man drops back down to his knees and shows off the details. Amid how impressed he is, John almost misses that Sherlock is glancing at him while speaking instead of addressing the detective inspector. "Inside of the ring is shinier than the outside – that means it's regularly removed. The only polishing it gets is when she works it off her finger, but it can't be easy, so she must have a reason. Can't be for work; her nails are too long. Doesn't work with her hands, so what or rather who does she remove her ring for? Clearly not one lover; she'd never sustain the fiction of being single over time, so more likely a string of them. Simple."
"What's that?" John said, suddenly much closer than Sherlock expected him to be.
"My ... my best what?" He leans forward, but misjudges how well he can sit up straight and ends up laying his head down on one hand on the table. It is going to be a bit difficult to spot an opening while inspecting the woodgrain, but it was this or fall forward.
"She's German. 'Rache': it's German for 'revenge.' She could be trying to tell us something..." John turns to see Anderson leaning on the door-frame, one hand posed in pretentious thoughtfulness on his chin with his fingers touching his mouth. John's mind fills with a montage of every textbook, warning sign, lecture, and shouted chastisement from a superior he's ever encountered on how to properly utilize sterile gloves. John wouldn't touch his mouth with the same glove that had touched a dead body out of caution for his own health at the very least.
"Sherlock Holmes."
"More pink than I've ever seen on one person," John mumbles out his initial impression. He checks for the scent of alcohol and looks her over for symptoms as much as he is able, pulling a pen and notepad out without thinking to make note of the visible symptoms out of habit, scratching near illegibly with his right hand on the notepad pressed to his thigh as he has a thousand times before. His specialty is living bodies, but he isn't completely ignorant of what to look for, generally. After a moment he straightens up and gives his assessment as a 'medical man' as Sherlock asked him to. "Yeah ... Asphyxiation, probably. Passed out, choked on her own vomit. Can't smell any alcohol on her. It could have been a seizure; possibly drugs."
"We don't know it isn't," Sherlock responds, and that is the more important point. Angelo puts the glass down in front of Sherlock, about to suggest a meal to go with it. "Thank you," Sherlock says before the chef can start. He picks up the glass, closing his eyes. Then he throws the wine into his own face. A few dabs with the napkin to ensure he isn't visibly dripping or in danger of getting any of the alcohol in his eyes and he looks over at John's befuddled face. "Watch. Don't interfere." Then, to Angelo he says: "Headless nun."
Perhaps it was assumed to be a very temporary arraignment? Something while they were both between things or restarting their professional lives after a bit of upset? Unfortunately, John was a left-handed junior surgeon whose dominant hand failed him regularly due to very real nerve damage and whose misbehaving right leg had days when even the cane was barely enough to keep him standing. The argument over it being psychosomatic or brain damage was moot so long as his body kept failing him. Steady well-paying work was going to be hard to come by and keep up under the circumstances. Never mind trying to squeeze his way into one of the highly competitive positions where he could finish his training as a trauma surgeon and get that fellowship he'd wanted. No nepotism, money, or high-powered connections to grease the way for him, which is why he'd signed up for the armed forces in the first place. Aside from a bit of brown-nosing that could have gotten him more suitable orders and seen him promoted above Captain before now, the RAMC's program was almost completely merit- and training-based. He'd lost all the valuable connections he'd made to ease his way when he was discharged. Ignoring for a moment that his left hand wasn't fit to stitch up a rag-doll, he didn't have any chance of finishing up his training without a long and highly political detour to get his foot in. Of course, he'd originally started accepting the occasional detours his career had taken as a way to please some of the top brass, so in a way the brown-nosing he did do ended up delaying his surgeon's training instead of speeding it along, though the challenging assignments looked great on his record and he had no regrets for his service aside from getting shot. The lack of a pay rise hadn't seemed terribly important as he was able to comfortably stash away a rather large percentage of his pay into long-term investments already. At the time, he'd been enjoying the excitement of the risky posts too much to complain. Now, knowing that if he hadn't been shot the last orders he'd been given would have seen him promoted to Major in less than six weeks made the whole situation that much harder to bear.
"That's odd. That's very odd," Sherlock muttered, starting to move a bit in a way that was more fidgeting than proper pacing. Lestrade was clearly still confused, but the bullet-speed of Sherlock's train of thought was a bit to catch up to.
"You might consider refueling," John is saying before the candle catches his eye and completely distracts him from whatever he was going to follow up with. He sighs and takes another moment to pick out one of the small plates before setting the menu aside and getting back to the task at hand. His food arrives, Sherlock peripherally notices it is meatless just like the shopping list. He also notes that the doctor is capable of decent multi-tasking since he seems to be able to consume his meal without being distracted from watching the street outside the window. The bread sticks are eventually pushed close to Sherlock's elbow and at some point his place setting acquired a fork and bread plate. Wasn't sharing tastes of another person's meal considered an intimate act despite its practicality given the varied menu in many establishments?
series they had all gotten hooked on. It let them all ignore how miserable dysentery was to deal with for a few hours. Escape is healthy in moderation, as long as it wasn't solely found in the bottom of a bottle.
"I'm not his date!" John answers indignantly to Angelo's back.
"The state of the place already," John hears Mrs. Hudson muttering as she came back out of the kitchen, categorizing things as best she can.
Some photographs would reveal a plethora of data about the man's past useful for navigating their cohabitation for as long as he needed assistance with the rent.
"I am."
The rest of the cab ride was quiet, but not the easy quiet that they had previously. At least not on Sherlock's end, as John looked quite relaxed and used his position closer to the curb to exit the vehicle before Sherlock could disengage his anxiously circling thoughts enough to move. After paying the driver -
"Starving." John turns to start walking, reaching out to lift the police tape for Sherlock. A gentleman and a flirt, even after everything. If John acts this way while respecting Sherlock's boundaries it could work out to be a very pleasant co-habitation. John would eventually tire of him, as everyone did, but he could have some indulgent fun in the meantime.
"You're not playin' the numbers, you're playin' me. Did I just give you the good pill or the bad pill?" Sherlock blinks slowly, feeling slow. He hates feeling slow, even with the drug to blame. Downers were never his preference.
"Lestrade should have cleared out, but we might be locked out of the first floor if they are holding the scene until office hours start. In that case, there is only one serviceable bed, though it is a double. I trust that won't be a problem? I'll likely sleep until noon."
Upon receiving an explanation of how Sherlock arrived at the conclusions he had about the man's history, Doctor Watson found what Sherlock did impressive even though it was directed at himself and contained a few bits of dirty laundry. Very few people would tolerate having the obvious truths they displayed pointed out to them, and Sherlock could not pretend he didn't observe and understand all those little things about everyone he encountered for more than a handful of stressful hours.
"Never mind. We need to find her case and Rachael," Sherlock insisted.
"Tea?" Sherlock prompted.
"Then I definitely don't see what you're saying." Sherlock huffs out a sigh at the unfairness of John's imperfect understanding, but refuses defeat. He fixes John with a steady gaze.
"Er, Inspector Lestrade, to my certain knowledge, this man hasn't eaten for several days. Now, if you want him alive for your next case, what he's gonna do right now is have dinner," John explained to the D.I. Sherlock simply stared at the smaller man, preening as discretely as possible at John's protective streak.
Invalid
"Suitcase, yes. She's been married at least ten years, but not happily. She's had a string of lovers but none of them knew she was married," Sherlock continued.
"Seen a lot of injuries, then; violent deaths."
"You're the medical man."
"Very good," John assured, hoping this was going where he thought it was going. Hoping the absurd website wasn't a load of horse shit. Hoping that Sherlock had looked him up as well and could fill in the blanks of what John's military career was actually like. Hoping that someone who could assess and handle people the way John could would be helpful to have around. Hoping more than anything that he could keep the fog out of his head long enough to be useful again.
"How do you make them take the poison?" Sherlock asks, dropping the act completely. Through the window, he can see John watching him in his moment of triumph. It makes him smile.
Is the speedy reply, followed by,
"Not in a while," he answers honestly, a bit confused by the sudden change of topic.
"Thank you so much for your input," Sherlock quips sarcastically, closing the door in Anderson's face, then turns back to John and Lestrade as if the weaselly man never existed. "Yes, obvious. Back of the right leg." Sherlock explains, not that that explains much. Sherlock takes a slow walk around the perimeter of the room, then starts poking at his phone. John looks carefully, but whatever Sherlock noticed wasn't obvious to him. He takes a critical look at the woman's legs, but can't make any conclusions from what he sees other than 'shapely' and 'very well groomed.'
"I just picked a lane, I suppose," John said with a shrug. "Err, you have a girlfriend?"
"Oh, right. Boyfriend, then?" John asked, licking his lips.
"The body in the garden, a birthday gift," Sherlock recited, his baritone voice pitched dangerously low. "That is horrifically unfair, John."
"It's not obvious to me," John mutters.
"I have developed a network of contacts and resources. Otherwise I'd spend all my time waiting on idiots to follow up on leads for me and die of paperwork-induced tedium filling out all the requisition forms." A bark of laughter sounded as John pulled down a canvas weekender bag with tasteful leather accents. A man's bag, it was compact and sturdy in neutral brown. It was more of a metro style than Sherlock would have expected, but not from a pricey brand. Clearly selected for practicality, there was a very nice zippered compartment on one side for organizing bits and bobs which Sherlock got to see put to use as John packed with military efficiency. Until that moment Sherlock was under the impression he was capable of rather speedy packing himself, but John had sorted his bag in half the time it would have taken Sherlock to pack his own leather case in an emergency. In fact, it was done so swiftly that Sherlock wasn't finished being stunned at the implication that John would be staying at Baker street with him tonight. Sherlock got his jacket and coat back on and then they were off again, another forty-five-minute ride ahead of them.
"It's luck." Arguing that actually, willing four coin tosses isn't statistically that impressive depending on context and pointing out the number of coincidences that forensic science has to overcome would probably be a bad idea.
"She could have dropped it somewhere along her way into the building. I was saying to Lestrade, after you left, that if she works in media she'd have something to take down notes or record things in case a story lands in her lap. Well, unless she was going on a serious holiday and cutting herself off from all that I suppose, but there isn't enough in the suitcase for more than one night. Like you said while you unpacked it: One office outfit, a nightgown, and a dress for going out," John thought aloud. Sherlock didn't remember speaking while he unpacked the suitcase, but he did have a tendency to think aloud in certain circumstances. The doctor's point about the purpose of the victim's trip made the lack of obvious means to do her work downright baffling. This was better than talking it through with the scull, as he didn't have to put any effort into formulating the other half of the conversation. He mentally adjusted the detail to be of higher importance. "She could have come to London for a night unplugged from work, but..."
"So, we're both unattached. That's fine." Sherlock frowned, running over their conversation again, and then straightening up in his seat as Mrs. Hudson's intrusive assumption that he and John would share a bedroom and John's subsequent behavior was added into the equation. Realization ripped through him as the implications behind John's words and mannerisms finally registered. Panicking, his mouth began to bleat out a repeat of what he said the last time the issue came up, though the situation was a far cry from the overly thankful and rather unstable client who very nearly disrobed herself. From a hesitant start, his words sped up until they were nearly overlapping in a panicked babble.
the main door of the flat. A second, frosted glass door led to the first floor bedroom from there. The stair did a ninety degree turn every half-story, so it wasn't exactly wide open to the foyer, but the upstairs resident would still be crossing the semi-shared space of the open stairwell to get to it. A quick trip downstairs to assess how much traffic would be in the stairwell showed John the door to 221A, a door into the back garden, and a door in the very back of the foyer labeled 221C. Mrs. Hudson lived in 221A, which she told them on the way up was tucked around the sandwich shop on the ground floor. So, the door to C either lead up to the second floor via an old servant's stair or down to a basement, meaning they wouldn't be sharing the stairwell with the top floor neighbors after all. Still, he'd have to invest in a less worn-out dressing gown or risk occasionally scandalizing the rest of the building. He carried on through the bath into the first floor bedroom which also attached to the oddly shaped sitting room on the main level near the couch. It was done up in plain paint the same pea-green color that accented the bath with decent enough furniture currently buried under another load of semi-unpacked boxes and open garment bags. It was on the smaller side for a primary bedroom even when John considered that the clutter likely made it feel smaller, though it had a generously-sized closet. A closet that already had more clothes hanging in it than John owned. Sherlock was either a clotheshorse or a pack rat, possibly both. All told, the layout of the first floor was essentially an uneven horseshoe with the stairwell in the middle and a few extra nooks and corners in every room as leftovers from the place being carved up and modernized. Not terrible for a London flat.
In the taxi John finally gets a proper explanation for how Sherlock knew so much about him without being told anything. It's not the most straightforward way of thinking, and John is certain that those little details could mean other things.
"But I know about his drinking habits. I even know that he left his wife," Sherlock's answer is petulant, almost whining.
Running feet could be heard, and the alien was soon surrounded by agents and hustled away. The Doctor picked up the watch, as Sherlock hastily wheeled past him and into the room. “John! John, you’re alright? Why are you out of bed?”
“You wouldn’t have succeeded,” said the man in the bow tie, wandering over to John’s bed.
“I think someone else is involved, Sherlock. The Moldovans said they were contacted by the Yrani when they approached Earth. Moldovans use cloaking technology on their ships, and it is very good. It took me hours to find them and I knew what I was looking for. How did the Yrani happen to know the ship was there? Even if he had access to the technology of his time, it would have been improbable. Here and now, impossible.”
“Where …” He broke off as something came into view in front of him. Bipedal, puce coloured skin, not any kind of human being. Sherlock blinked in surprise. “What are you?” he asked.
“Sherlock?” John mumbled as Sherlock turned away.
The Doctor sat at a table that was on the first floor of a café, overlooking a busy road below. He sipped a cup of tea patiently. Rory and Amy sat nearby, Rory tucking into a piece of cake and Amy drinking a coke. “When are you going to tell us why we’re here?” asked Amy.
"...or if he just couldn't deduce possible brain damage without some more obvious clue."
"They won't work with me," Sherlock retorts irritably, which is fair enough given what John's seen. John focuses back on the body, trying and failing to dredge up a bit of something useful. There was one conference on forensics and autopsy a decade back he'd attended with a very cute red-head, but he'd spent most of it studying the red-head. He is certain he hasn't encountered this much bright pink at once in his entire career.
"Angelo, a glass of white wine, quickly," he calls out as he watches the cab carefully in the mirror, sparing a quick glance at John to ensure the other man is paying proper attention to the correct details. "I give you the perfect murder weapon of the modern age, the invisible car: The London Cab." The cab pulls away into a narrow side street and stops just a few yards down the road.
"Course it is, yeah. Found your keys in your jacket. I thought, well, why not? People like to die at 'ome." There is the tinkle of keys dropping onto a table. Thinking that the room has stopped spinning so it might be safe to put all his weight onto his legs, he immediately loses his balance and crashes to the floor face down.
John limped off at a fair clip in the direction he last saw Sherlock.
Having too much cash on hand was supposedly "dangerous for a recovering addict" according to the psychiatrists Mycroft was still paying despite Sherlock having attended exactly none of their appointments after his release. As if trading favors for drugs wasn't just as easily done. Sherlock didn't have a strong belief in god, a spouse, a pet, or any other appropriately sentimental purpose in his life to keep him clean - something that had the doctors certain he'd be back under their care soon enough. Even though Mycroft claimed to understand The Work and what it was to Sherlock he clearly agreed with the so-called experts that Sherlock did not have any real motivation to remain sober. To that end, it had been arraigned through dubiously legal contracts for Sherlock to purchase essentials without actually handling any money as much as possible. Instead, he used accounts at shops that had been set up for him to clothe and groom himself despite the fact that going to the posh little shops Mycroft and Mummy picked out for him to get extravagantly priced clothing at times when he was living in a rat-infested hole was grating. The underlying message that he should get a proper career, preferably working for Mycroft, so he could afford such a lifestyle on his own was clear and unwelcome. However, dressing well both felt nice and generally reassured the few paying clients he had that he was competent. There was no good reason beyond petulance to refuse to use the offered luxuries.
Obvious - so obvious! Hope said he drugged his other victims the same way he'd injected Sherlock before playing the game, and Sherlock hadn't considered the importance. Both pills were the same, and both relatively harmless on their own. The poison was in the reaction between the two drugs. Sherlock has missed the injection site because he'd examined the body in place in her coat and not looked for needle marks on the arms. He hadn't been given permission to see the other bodies or the full autopsy reports, just the preliminary reports he'd snagged off of the D.I.'s desk before he'd been officially allowed on the case. Hope was so confident because it was rigged, completely and from the beginning, so the pills didn't matter. The mind game was just that: a game a murderer played with his victims after he'd already injected them with the substance that would end their lives. John Watson spotted the actual murder weapon when everyone else, including Sherlock, had it wrong. Fascinating.
"Look, we've been sharing a bedroom more and more often, and we just sort of started doing it without actually talking about it, but we do it because it helps with the nightmares and the stress after everything that, well, just after everything,” John said with an all-encompassing gesture. “I get that, and I know you're asexual. You don't have to force yourself into doing something you don't want to do because you think I..."
"Before you were invalided, where were you...?"
"'ello?" Sherlock hears both from his own phone and from the cab window behind him.
"John," Sherlock said, the frustration in his voice twisting it nearly into a whine. "That is not nearly fair. Either tell a complete story with enough context to make proper sense or don't tell it."
"Yes, and generally yes, spontaneous kissing is welcome, though I'm not big on excessive public displays," John confirmed, inching closer to the middle of the couch.
It was that guilt from having his landlady clean up after him that started John on this ridiculous path. Sometime around the Blind Banker case she'd asked for a hand tidying something in her own flat and John had gone down to repay some of his debt without knowing what the specific job was. He then spent the next two hours untangling and re-wrapping yarn for Mrs. Hudson and her friends. The old ladies twittered on about how helpful he was being and explained, at length and amid rather graphic descriptions of their medical conditions, that knitting helped with reclaiming and maintaining dexterity in their hands.
"No."
"There was no suitcase," Lestrade said, slightly smug.
"Right, so it is my turn?" Sherlock asked, but barreled ahead without waiting for an answer, his cheeks just a pink as John's and his eyes fixed on the coffee table. "I may have deleted a lot of the relevant data, but I find unprotected anal sex to be rather unsanitary and I doubt anything will ever distract me from that thought well enough for me to perform it on another person; however, I have used and enjoyed assistive devices that simulate the act being performed on myself." John summoned every ounce of medical professionalism to summarize.
“Give it a rest, Pond!” demanded the Doctor. “Just watch.”
“Quite right,” said the Doctor.
“How much of this is speculation?” asked Mycroft.
“I don’t care about any of that,” snarled the alien. “What’s the future to me? Now is all there is.”
“Well I may have mentioned that they are in violation of about a dozen laws and it would be a shame if the Shadow Proclamation heard about it.” He turned to Rory. “Now, when we leave the TARDIS, let me do the talking. When they produce John, I want you to take him and get him into the TARDIS. Do not wait for me, just go.”
The Doctor shook his head. “Not this time. Sit down.” Rory hesitated. “Trust me,” added the Doctor.
“It’s your fault he’s dead,” said Sherlock dully. “Do you know that?”
The Doctor scoffed. “Of course I can find him! And then,” he patted his pocket where he’d stowed the stone, “I’ll do a trade.” He headed for the door. “You keep looking for Sherlock. Leave John to me.”
Gregory doesn’t need to see this, Mycroft thought, as he sent the file for analysis. He poured another whiskey, and tossed it back. He then went into the small washroom attached to his office, splashed some water on his face, and examined his expression in the mirror. When he was satisfied with his appearance, the Iceman left his office.
The Doctor strolled away. “Bye, Mycroft!”
“None of your business!”
“What else is there?” said the Yrani. “He offered me a way back home but there’s nothing there for me. But money buys me luxury here. “
Is Sherlock with you? she sent. Only I heard he’d dropped off the radar, and I wondered.
Then he gasped, jerking back. A long shard of glass was sticking out from his chest, and Sherlock, unaccountably no longer bound, was sitting up, one hand wrapped around his own ribcage, the other oozing blood from the glass. “Got you!” he hissed.
He ended up slumped against a wall, coughing and thinking about Sherlock. He wondered if they’d killed him. He didn’t want to think about that. He also didn’t want to think about how upset Sherlock would be without him. He tried not to think at all but that didn’t seem to work. Everything had a nightmarish quality, and it seemed that he was never really entirely awake. He might be feverish, he considered. This amused him. How could one possibly tell that, in this heat?
Sherlock kept working, as an hour passed. Thomas brought Martin a cup of tea and had one himself. (He didn’t dare drink coffee in front of Martin as the man had such an aversion to it.)
“No,” said Sherlock, looking down at his broken finger. “That was the only injury the alien did to me itself.”
“Found what?” said Rory.
There was a noise from the room behind him. Greg looked around. “Oi, don’t get out of bed!” He disappeared back into the room. A nurse followed shortly afterward.
Sherlock smirked, and they began to descend the stairs. Sherlock suddenly sobered. “That machine. Does it hurt?”
He had begun to cough quite badly shortly after being in the cell, and his chest was becoming more and more congested. He suspected the humidity of the air and wondered what bacteria was in it. God alone knew what he was breathing in. He knew he was ill. He didn’t even respond the last time he was asked the strange question. What was the point?
“He said Martin killed John.”
Mycroft turned to leave. “You can stop pretending to be asleep now,” he said as he passed Greg’s chair.
The man opened the door, and Martin entered, observing his prisoner who was lying on the floor, still tied, and apparently unconscious. “Hmm,” said Martin, prodding him with his foot. He waved his hand at the guard, who withdrew. “Holmes?” called Martin. “Can you hear me?” Sherlock gave a soft moan. Martin leaned closer. “Holmes?”
“Kill what?” asked Greg, as the medics that had accompanied the group descended the stairs.
“Who?” said the creature, and the thugs sniggered.
“Why?”
“You know what I mean!” replied Amy, irritated.
The Doctor deftly kicked the alien’s gun away as Lestrade jumped on it, handcuffing its arms.
“No murders.” John was almost asleep.
The Doctor stared at the screen, and sighed again. “Where is that now?” He pointed at one of the items, a stone sphere.
“No,” said Mycroft. “The man we have in custody has been very helpful. We have found most of the others, as well as recovering a large quantity of firearms and explosives. They were planning terrorist attacks on two public buildings, in the name of a free Britain.“  His tone of voice clearly indicated what he thought of this concept. “However no one seems to know where Martin is. He left the house to buy drugs, apparently.”
Greg nodded, and Mycroft turned towards the lifts. “Let’s go and have a chat, shall we?”
Anthea reappeared with a tea tray, and Mycroft was silent while she served. The Doctor however, chatted away. “Ooh lovely, and biscuits, wonderful! I can see why Mycroft likes you so much!” Mycroft raised an eyebrow, and Anthea, looking surprisingly flustered, left without a word.
“I think the driver’s dead,” said Rory, noticing the distant figure of John move from the front seat immediately to the passenger in the back.
Mycroft stood up, and said, “I think this situation needs something stronger than bad coffee.” He beckoned to Greg to follow him to his office. He poured out two glasses of brandy. Lestrade took one.
“I’m texting Mycroft,” said John, fiddling with his phone. He looked startled. “Not working. It must have a jammer.”
“Give it up,” Rory advised Sherlock. “You’ll never convince him.”
“I will if you will,” retorted Sherlock. John smiled, and closed his eyes.
“Why aren’t they keeping an eye on this lot?” asked John testily. “Why are there no guards?” He started heading for the door. “We need to leave, and we need to report this to Mycroft.”
“Everyone's leaving, aren’t they?” Rory reminded them.
He soon realized they were retracing the route they’d taken. “Aren’t you taking him to hospital?” he exclaimed.
“It’s not,” said Sherlock, pleased to know something the Doctor didn’t. “This is a safe house. Used for business. No one pays attention in this neighbourhood.”
Mycroft nodded. She turned to go, and he said, “Please have the original intelligence re-checked.”
“You were doing this for money?” the Doctor asked.
Sherlock huffed in irritation. “Why would someone want to hurt John? Even those aliens were less interested in killing him than finding out where their rock was! What is their motive?”
I’m bored, Sally! came the response, followed quickly by, God, I sound like Sherlock.
“Kate!!” exclaimed the Doctor in frustration.
The Doctor looked around sheepishly. “Oops?” he offered, and waved at the soldiers who were running up in response to the alarms.
Sherlock snorted derisively. “Terrorists! They’re a group of amateurs who dream and talk a lot and do nothing. They only turned up on Mycroft’s radar when a known agitator took over the group. HE just wants to know what this Andrew Martin is intending. Dull!”
“Doctor!” demanded Mycroft.
“I came here,” said Treschlkt.
“Good,” said the Doctor. “What date was it at home when you were transported here?”
Mycroft was standing in the foyer of the medical level, having received a message from the Doctor that simply said “ETA eighth floor five minutes, have medical staff ready.” He could only assume the Doctor had been successful in retrieving John, but he had no idea what to expect. Nearby a doctor and two nurses stood with a gurney. His staff were well-trained enough not to react, but he knew they must be puzzled. Well they’d be more puzzled in a minute. The tell-tale groaning filled the air, and the TARDIS appeared. The door opened, and the Doctor appeared. He and another man (Rory Williams, nurse, identified companion of the Doctor, Mycroft’s brain automatically supplied) were supporting John between them. Mycroft frowned. Unlike Sherlock, John had not been physically injured, but he was obviously extremely ill. He was pale, sweating, shivering, coughing, and barely able to walk with the aid of the other two. He had lost weight and was still wearing the clothes he went missing in, though now stiff from grime and sweat. The medical staff converged on him, and were soon loading him onto the gurney, with Rory giving the attending doctor a handover.
“And you did torture my brother,” said Mycroft pleasantly. “This gives me … motivation.”
An hour later, Mycroft’s phone pinged with an incoming message from Sherlock’s phone. It contained the words “Little brother tried to run. He won’t be doing that again in a hurry.” There was a photo, of the soles of Sherlock’s feet, covered in cuts. Mycroft closed the photo, and then made a call. “Anthea, I am sending to you another communication from Sherlock’s phone. Please have it analysed.” He forwarded the message, and then sighed. Please hold on, Sherlock, he thought. I’ll find you.
Amy gasped. “Is this it?” She looked meaningfully at them. “The thing I was left out of?”
John looked away. “It’s a bit hard to explain.” He was starting to gasp, and put the oxygen mask back on. Sherlock frowned, but didn’t say anything, and began to pick at his own meal.
Rory smiled. It had been a bit of a different adventure, but perhaps one of the most rewarding he’d experienced. “What are you smiling about?” asked Amy.
Lestrade didn’t take his eyes off the being in front of him. “John, it doesn’t matter.”
“To use on me.”
The Doctor was not to be distracted. “What happened in the shop, Mycroft?”
“Those people, sure.”
“I…I…” said the man in shock.
“No, sir,” said Anthea.
“Doctor, I have to!” Rory protested.
“What’s your name?” asked the Doctor.
“Nicked it,” John corrected, and they both shared a smile. John looked back out. “I was wondering where we were,” he said, and paused to cough, holding onto the windowsill.
“I’ve called it in,” said Greg. “Dimmock’s taking a team out to the address Sherlock gave me.”
“What’s wrong with changing it?” demanded Sherlock.
“It’s nothing personal,” said the alien. “I’m being paid a lot of money.”
“Photos of the aliens?” asked the Doctor. She turned the screen towards him. “Ah,” said the Doctor. He sighed. “What did they remove from the ship?”
An annoyingly familiar voice floated over the phone. “Mycroft, we need to talk!”
“Has he ever been into kidnapping?”
Mycroft sat at his desk, pretending to work and that he was not waiting for the phone to ring. When it finally rang he answered it quickly and listened. “The entire store is empty, sir,” said a voice at the other end. “Our forensics people are processing.”
“Mycroft,” said Greg, “I want my handcuffs back.”
“Martin!” gasped Sherlock.
“For him,” Rory said. “Been two days for us.”
“Never mind that,” said the Doctor. “I have a story for you.” He parked himself in the chair. Mycroft was faintly relieved that this time he didn’t put his feet on the desk. “Once upon a time,” the Doctor began, “there was an army doctor in Afghanistan, who was seconded to UNIT. During the three months he was with them, they attended a wrecked spacecraft. Doctor Watson attempted to treat a dying alien, the only survivor, but the being, the pilot of the craft, didn’t make it. The UNIT group removed some portable items from the craft before destroying it. However, they didn’t know two things – that the Moldovan race equipped the pilot unit of their ships with a continuously transmitting feed, including visual, that would only stop when the pilot died, and that when they removed this,” he took the stone sphere from a pocket and placed it on the desk,” from the ship, they were removing a Moldovan heartstone, an artifact that this race has been known to die for, and more importantly in this case, to kill for.” He paused, as if waiting for a response, but Mycroft just stared at him, so he gave a little shrug and continued. “The Moldavans live a long way away, so it took a few years for them to get here. You won’t find their ship in orbit as they have very good cloaking technology. As they approached, they were contacted by a helpful resident, who had been living here for a while, who told them he could get anything they needed. They gave him a photo, and a date. Maybe he had to ask for the coordinates. The photo would give him rank and division, the coordinates would narrow down the possible suspects, and a search of records identifies the man. And John Watson is not hard to find due to his blog. “
John stared at him for a moment, before starting to laugh. This led to coughing, and Sherlock fetched him a glass of water. “Thanks,” John croaked. “God this is annoying.” He rubbed his chest, and stood up. “Have to lie down,” he explained. “Think I need to sleep again.” He climbed back into the bed. “Wish I wasn’t so tired.” He looked over at Sherlock. “You must be very bored.”
“Not this one,” said the Doctor. “This race is currently in their stone age. No, you’ve got a time traveller here, which explains a lot.”
The Doctor paused. “He … won’t have been treated well.” The TARDIS started making loud landing noises. “Come on,” said the Doctor.
Sherlock looked down his nose, which he somehow managed to do while returning to the stolen wheelchair. “The inspector has his uses, and I would rather he is not any more emotionally compromised than necessary.” He wheeled the chair towards where they left the TARDIS.
Greg nodded, and just held Sherlock’s hand until they pulled up in the underground carpark of the building they had left. He followed the medics, and sure enough soon found himself on a floor that looked exactly like any one of the many hospitals he’d visited over the years. Sherlock was whisked away into an examination room, and Greg went to where Mycroft was standing, watching silently.
Sherlock nodded. “Don’t tell Lestrade that, even if he asks you.”
He brought up the file, and turned it to Greg, who watched it, swearing several times. When it finished he sat in stunned silence. “Jesus!” he muttered finally.
“On a spaceship,” said Sherlock smugly.
Treschlkt folded its arms, but when one of Mycroft’s men stepped forward, it hastily laid them out on the table, palms up. The Doctor peered at the tattoos marking them. “Interrogator, but … you never finished your training. Why was that?”
John grimaced. “Sounds like Moriarty. How do we get ourselves in these situations?”
“I’m sorry you had to go through that.” John picked up Sherlock’s splinted hand. He stroked lightly over his thumb. “Handcuffs?”
"The police don't consult amateurs," Sherlock brags as he looks out of the side window. After a moment's thought John sees that the real magic is in how Sherlock put the details together. The tan lines likely don't mean anything so specific without John's comment to Mike, his haircut, or his limp. The clues on the phone need the context of John looking for a flatshare in order to inform Sherlock about John's relationship to Harry. Sure, Sherlock gots Harry's gender wrong, but Sherlock has no context for that, no indication of the truth one way or the other so he goes with the most probable assumption. It is all interlocking, and it is the complexity of that interconnected reasoning that blows John away. To have that many little details in focus at the same time, and to put it all together so quickly, is astounding.
Mrs. H knew that John practiced with a scalpel on various cuts of meat, cutting pockets to stuff with herbs or cheese and stitching them shut among other experiments in creative butchery. Sherlock was always quite appreciative of the culinary experiments and examined the hesitation and tool marks for use in any cases involving creative butchery, then repaid John by having excellent pescatarian-friendly dishes delivered from various restaurants while the beef or lamb was in the oven. Sherlock himself avoided pork because of his work with corpses, something John informed the frustrating man that he could have mentioned when John told him about the sale at Tesco’s instead of after John had made four portions of elaborately stuffed loin. D.I. Lestrade had arrived during the row about waste that followed, and Sherlock unloaded the meat onto the older man so quick Lestrade was left standing stunned on the sidewalk outside 221B, bakeware in hand, for several minutes before he hurried home to get it cooking. At the end of that case Lestrade returned the dish and asked John where he bought the kid-friendly meal with its geometric stuffing, but Sherlock started talking loudly about Anderson's latest affair and got them evicted from the scene before any embarrassing admissions were made.
"Anything interesting?" Sherlock asked, shoving his hands into his pockets in what John registers as a pose. What sort of pose eludes him for a moment, though he is used to knowing these things straight off.
"But then... hmmm," Sherlock focused back on the knitting, delight and determination erasing some of the lines his hiatus had carved into his skin. "Go away Lestrade, I'm busy."
"We know the killer drove his victims, but there were no marks of coercion or violence on the bodies. Each one of those five people climbed into a stranger's car voluntarily. The killer was someone they trusted," Sherlock explained, gesturing deliberately with his hands as he spoke to keep them from fidgeting.
"I cleared it a bit," Sherlock clarified.
"I only asked because, well... Flat mates should know what they are going in for," John said. He was lying, or maybe just withholding something relevant, but Sherlock was too flustered to deduce what it was.
Sherlock grunted in frustration as he once again had to combat ancillary thoughts. The solution to the distraction was obvious, but he had no time to sort through that particular backlog of observations to acknowledged and discard them. He had a case on and he needed to focus. This endless derailment of his mental process needed to stop. He tried again and failed to cleanly envision the stakeout. The mental picture of spotting the killer outside Angelo's needlessly included a smiling blue-eyed blond, a bottle of wine, and romantic music.
Using small but telling details to deduce the specifics of people's lives was both an interesting idea, and an incredibly impressive talent to have if Holmes could do it as fast as it seemed he did when he first met John. He'd heard of cold reading before, in the context of fortune-tellers and magicians claiming to be psychic, but never thought of how it could be used for any practical purposes. It also seemed a bit implausible that anyone could take in that many details at once, but he'd have ample time to get the man to explain himself tomorrow. John spent the morning thinking on and off about what sort of career the man had. The text he sent using John's phone, 'If brother had green ladder, arrest brother. - SH,' implied some involvement in law enforcement. Holmes certainly seemed to think that, given whatever he knew about John from his deductions, Stanford's implied recommendation was enough of a reason to rent a flat together. Except that Stanford had led John to Holmes like he was showing off some curiosity to lighten John's mood rather than a solid option, and John was at a severe disadvantage in the matter of knowing who his potential flatmate was.
"Play what? It's a fifty-fifty chance," Sherlock says, leaning forward onto his elbow, not keen on another face-plant no matter how gracefully he managed the second one.
"Don't. Just don't. What did you do with the gun?"
Sherlock's own trust money had to last him until retirement age and there would be no arguing the merits of short-term losses in pursuit of long-term gains. That he had not been caught using drugs in six years and was a fully functional twenty-seven-year-old man running his own business did not matter, Mycroft persisted in treating him like an incapable child. His trust fund was kept just beyond his direct reach, though he did have his own personal and business accounts. Rather than paying for things directly, to use the bit of his trust fund that wasn't locked down he had to use a credit card that had been set up for him with a "reasonable" spending limit. The full balance was automatically paid in full by the trust each month, so any of his allowance that he didn't use could not be rolled into the next month. It was incredibly restrictive, and despite very reasonably pointing out that the setup encouraged spending as much as possible instead of developing responsible habits on several occasions the ridiculous setup remained. The debit card that was directly attached to his trust was nearly useless. His maximum per-month cash limit via that card was disgustingly small, not even enough for the thriftiest grocery bill, so he took it all on the first of each month. Most of that cash went to his network of informants, but he was able to stash a small amount away in case of emergencies. Emergencies like paying a security deposit on a new flat seasonally.
, John thinks as he reads her notes upside-down,
"The fireplace should warm up the parlor quickly," Sherlock said.
"That's, that's fine," John thankfully interrupted the rush of words gently. "It's all fine. Whatever shakes your... boat." A crease deepened between the former soldier's eyes. "I've made it awkward."
"We're after a psychopath," Lestrade explains to the irritated man.
"I think he's brilliant enough. I love the brilliant ones, always so desperate to get caught," Sherlock explained, gesturing excitedly.
"So long as I can get some paracetamol I probably will too," John answered. Sherlock grabbed onto John's hand and they made their wobbly way back to 221B Baker street to sleep through the adrenaline crash.
(adjective) not true because based on erroneous information or unsound reasoning.
"Dead what?!" the older woman shouts.
"Still, bit of a risk, isn't it? Here?" Sherlock says, his voice trembling. His mind is still fuzzy, and he is operating mostly on autopilot.
"I have it!" Sherlock crowed, leaping up from the couch where they had been sitting as he contemplated the diorama of the original crime scene. "The victim, Mr. Cotton, was a handyman dating an heiress to a meat packing company but cheating on her with her much younger disinherited sister. The third sister mentioned in the original note is actually their mother's sister, who discovered the affair and blackmailed him, but the aunt was pleased enough by the free remodeling projects he was doing for her and did not want him dead or found out. That's what made Mr. Cotton a gift - the perceived charity he showed to their spinster aunt. You fabricated an excellent red herring, John, and not entirely irrelevant since there was some tension between the eldest daughter and her aunt." John stood up to take a bow to acknowledge the praise of his layered storytelling and Sherlock continued to announce his final deduction without realizing how close together they were standing.
"Without checking on the lead?" Sherlock asked, raising his arm to hail a taxi as soon as he was relieved of his burden. "I'm not his sniffer dog, John. I do far more than just locate and point out unnoticed evidence." The taller man directed the driver to Baker street and manhandled the pink case into the back with them. He looked John over as the taxi pulled into traffic, his face suddenly pinching with curiosity. "You are cold."
"Is he coming back?" Lestrade asks.
"Good old Doctor Watson. I underestimated him," Sherlock says. In the mirror above the mantel, he catches sight of the wistful smile on his face. That will never do. He turns in his chair and prepares to stand up.
"Then I choose for you, and I force it down your throat. Right now there's nothing you could do to stop me." Sherlock blinks at this, aware that he is probably too weak to fend the man off. With the way he'd moved Sherlock's dead weight around, age hadn't made the cabbie frail. Just then the landline phone begins to ring. "Funnily enough, no one's ever gone for that option. And I don't think you will either." Sherlock looks across to the phone.
"So, the shooter wasn't one of yours, then," he asks casually.
"Not really my area," Sherlock said as calmly as he could.
"Found your website.
"Suitcase?" Lestrade mutters. John looks around and can't find the mentioned item.
"Oh, I don't think so. Not your kind of murder," Sherlock says as he slowly hauls himself to his feet, looking down at the cabbie and smiling.
"So do you if you think about it," Sherlock answers, shaking his head slightly and squinting irritably. "Why don't people just think?"
"Well of course he was confidant! It's just like... oh, fuck what was the movie? Anyway, in that the glass of water he gave the victim was tainted and all the pills were harmless alone," John said with a dismissive wave. "It was all the same in the end: the pills were a sham. This time the poison was in the shot he gave to make his victims easier to handle. Mix some other downer in with a shot strong enough to make a grown man pass out, or any of a host of other things... you said he had an aneurysm? Christ, I could make a list as long as my arm for all the things it could have been in those pills that wouldn't hurt him, even if he didn't do something like pop an activated charcoal tablet while you were out. Could have been his own medications for god's sake. He'd just be taking his usual evening meds." Sherlock stopped to stare at John.
"Okay, gimme." Lestrade makes a show of taking out a notebook and turning to face Sherlock properly. "I'll write it down this time." Sherlock takes a deep breath and starts to lay out the known facts about the shooter, feeling much better being able to sort out one of the complications in today's fiasco than sitting idle mulling over his shortcomings.
"The battery is a bit knackered," John admitted as he pulled it out. He tapped it to check how badly it was drained from chasing Sherlock using his map. "About five percent left, I think. Fou-oh, three now, sorry."
like this before. It had been frustrating him for months, making him feel like a child. There had always been something coming up, always something to do or anticipate either in his regular duties or through one of the favors he did for the brass. Or even just going out with the boys on the hunt for some attractive company. "I'll make you that cuppa. You rest your leg."
"There's been cabs up and down this street all night," John points out.
"It's Anderson," the man replies, stepping into John's field of view. A bit older, graying, and dressed respectably enough. He doesn't even glance John's way.
"I realized what I did and changed them while your pet freak was sniffing around, not that he noticed," Anderson huffed, though John saw him tugging at his glove as he turned away from them and hurried back to his team.
"Of course it was! It was extraordinary! It was quite extraordinary!" The praise clearly startled Sherlock, and he seems to preen under the attention once he is sure it is genuine.
"Yes," John confirmed, standing up and setting the paper aside.
Sherlock wakes slowly. Things are fuzzy, and being warm and fairly comfortable isn't helping him wake up. His skull comes into focus on the mantel above the lit hearth. Back in Baker street, in his own chair. Had John realized things had gone wrong and brought him home? He was keeping that cute doctor, even if he had to...
Kate checked her computer again. “An old Torchwood one, certainly. Apparently artifacts from that planet would wash up through the rift regularly.”
“It was the watch,” Sherlock added. “According to the information we have, they have technology that can make them look like someone else. As long as it wears the watch, it will look like the person whose appearance has been loaded on the watch.”
John closed his eyes. “Don’t overdo it,” he murmured. “You need rest too.”
“I need to talk to the Yrani,” the Doctor added.
… And he was in a cellar, though whether it was in the same house or elsewhere he wasn’t sure. He was still bound hand and foot, and could barely move. His mind was screaming John John John … He knew he was sobbing incoherently but he could not stop, could not even think. He must have passed out again at some point, and when he awoke there was a glimmer of light through a tiny window. This time he was calm, numb. He needed to escape, and then he needed to kill the monster calling itself Andrew Martin. Afterwards … well, there was no afterwards. He would follow John.
“Well, that’s good,” said Greg, and sipped his whiskey. He chewed on his lip, and hesitated a moment before asking, “Is John … dead, do you think?”
The Yrani currently known as Andrew Martin sat at his computer with his bank details open on the screen. The group he’d delivered the short human to had arranged payment promptly, and he was enjoying the increase in his bank balance. He was also contemplating the potential future earnings wrapped up in the tall human. The information he himself could provide plus the information his brother could be coerced into providing was immensely valuable. Once this had been exhausted, the human himself could be sold to one of his many enemies, providing yet another source of income. All in all, the taking of the two humans had been something of a windfall, and Martin was feeling very pleased with himself. Of course, the interrogation and extraction of the information would take a while, and he could see the human was going to be very stubborn, but he was very experienced in this sort of thing and was quite confident of eventual success. The only thing that had confused him was that the tall human seemed to see him as he really was instead of as Andrew Martin. He didn’t think the primitive humans were capable of seeing through the field he was generating. Oh well, it was irrelevant. The stupid humans who followed Andrew Martin were completely convinced of his identity, and blissfully unaware that their fearless leader was dead and buried where he would not be found in a hurry.
He had arrived already, and he was lurking furtively at a table near the back. Donovan rolled her eyes, sitting at a table in the better lit area near the front and beckoning him forward. He shuffled over, mumbling a complaint about not wanting to be seen near a copper. Donovan wondered why on earth he had asked her to meet him at a pub in that case, but she didn’t say it. No point in antagonising the man, just in case he did know something relevant.
Mycroft rolled his eyes, and the Doctor protested, “Bow-ties are cool.”
Sherlock shrugged. “It’s possible, I suppose.”
“We know the Moldovans paid you in gold bullion,” said Mycroft, sounding bored.
“I don’t care,” said the alien. “Lestrade. Move or die.”
The Doctor interrupted again, making Sherlock bristle. “Your brother thinks you are still in danger, that the Yrani may have made promises to others that he can only keep by handing you over.”
Martin had become an expert at picking the humans who loved feeling powerful and enjoyed hurting their fellows, and had quickly singled out the ones in this group that would follow his instructions in this area, making them his inner circle. Obnoxious creatures, but they did the job. “Good.” He grinned back dutifully. “Let’s see how he is.”
John stared. “How on Earth …”
John sighed, sitting down in the chair that had been next to his bed. “You said when I first woke up, that you thought I’d died.”
Sherlock shook his head minutely. “Just find John!” he hissed.
“Ha, good question!” said the Doctor cheerily. “Moldovans are a tetchy kind of race, and very rigid in their religious beliefs. Heart stones are the property of each clan, and they are the repositories of the ancestors’ feelings and memories, their hearts. You’d be surprised how often they do go missing, basically because that lot insist on lugging the things around with them. And then we have blood-feuds and murders and kidnappings and all sorts of fun and games.” He sighed. “As for why they thought you knew, when you attended the crashed ship in Afghanistan, the pilot cabin was still transmitting. The UNIT personnel might have been the ones removing the items from the ship, but your information was all the Moldovans had. So they came here looking for the so-called thief, got in touch with the Yrani alien who was living here, and it eventually impersonated Andrew Martin in order to lure you into a trap, and deliver you to its buyers.” He snorted. “Meanwhile the heart stone was in the UNIT archive labelled ‘unknown artefact, decorative?’ Idiots!”
His phone rang, and he picked it up, seeing it was from the head agent at the store. “Sir, we have a code nine,” said the man.
Mycroft nodded. “Please notify me when you have a result, Mr Sykes.”
Sherlock slept for a while, before going for another stroll in his stolen wheelchair (which nobody had repossessed yet). When he returned, John was awake and standing looking out of the window. John glanced down at him as he came up beside him. “Where did you get that wheelchair?” His voice sounded cracked and breathless. Sherlock didn’t like it.
“No you’re not,” said Sherlock. “Where is John?”
