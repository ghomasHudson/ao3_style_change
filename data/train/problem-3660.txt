She presses into his touch briefly before she heads to the bathroom, doing whatever it is women do to get ready for bed. Castiel walks over to his medicine cabinet, opening it up and scanning the bottles within. He doesn’t have anything hardcore, but anything with something to make him sleep… Ah. NyQuil. He knocks back a shot of the medicine, rinses his mouth, and then shuffles towards his bedroom. He leaves the door open, strips to his boxers, and then climbs into bed. The combination of NyQuil and his own personal exhaustion have him blissfully out within minutes, the city bustling outside of his slightly ajar window.
we are entering the stage where i don't have much written, after this, and we begin the perilous journey of me writing whenever i even have a sliver of wi-fi and posting while scream-crying.
an interesting thing) and the sacrifice of a dear friend. The last thing the Winchesters remember from their original world, right before God died and blasted them into the time warp, was Castiel being stabbed through the heart, his body blasting away in charred feathers and black goo.
“I like dancing,” Kevin confesses with a whisper, then sighs. “But if my mom knew… she’d disown me. It’s all about advanced calculus and cello solos.”
“No, but I wasn’t looking,” he says, grabbing a poppyseed muffin while Charlie goes for the blueberry. “I was a block east of here when it happened.”
Flushing hot with fury, Dean crumples the thick card in his fist. He shoves it into his apron pocket, picking up the rest of the dishes and then spinning on heel to take them to the kitchen.
He can’t remember the last time this room had been used. Perhaps… ten years ago was the last time there had been any positive memories. He remembers Daphne, beautiful and vibrant and hands on her slightly swollen tummy as they discussed paint swatches for the nursery and joked about this room being filled with boxes. The memory hurts, but a little less than usual. This room has been collecting dust and has served no purpose since he put everything in the basement. They hadn't even got around to painting it.
“Our apartment is too small for proper shelving for how many books I wish to own,” he replies. The man in the trunk’s eyes flutter open, looking up at Castiel with a resigned, pitiful tilt.
"I would like that," Michael says, smoothing the lapels of his blazer a bit. He sets his menu down, pausing his thought when the waiter drops off their drinks. Returning his attention to Dean, he offers a small smile. "But tell me about how you've been before we cross that bridge. I don't want you to feel pressured."
The man stops in front of Castiel. Comparatively, the man is slender, not really that physically imposing. But Castiel remembers well the way the shadows had played around him, so he stands guard. The man peers curiously at Castiel’s sunglasses, and then sneers.
,” Michael suddenly bellows, a gust of wind coming from him. His voice shakes the ground. He’s seething when he looks at Castiel. “You were made to serve God! Free will is an
“You really want the last images in your head to be about Brett’s ‘rock hard girth slipping into my slick, sweet folds, our souls entwining as we become one’?” Dean asks.
He turns off the shower. He draws back the curtain and grabs his towel from the rack on the wall, drying off his legs and feet before stepping out of the tub and onto the floor mat. He dries off the rest of his body and scrubs the towel messily over his hair to collect most of the moisture, before gently patting his beard. Wiping away the condensation on the mirror he takes a good look at himself. His beard isn’t awful. It’s a little unkempt, but he sort of likes it. Normally he’s clean-shaven, pristine and tidy, but not having to bother with the maintenance of shaving every day (literally every day, he’s pretty sure he’ll never be able to shave away his five o’clock shadow) has been nice.
All of the holidays he couldn’t have with Daphne and Jimmy, the things he’d convinced himself he missed out on… he hadn’t missed them at all.
Besides, one must be twenty-one to work in the club, but in the daytime one can be eighteen and work in the restaurant.
"Pourin' cats n' dogs!" Dean hoots as he enters the kitchen. He wipes himself down with the towel with a thankful smile, then sits on a stool, drying his hair. "Cocoa?" He asks, hopefully.
Dean Winchester, born to John and Mary Winchester. Mary Winchester died in a house fire. John, Dean, and Dean’s infant brother Sam escaped unharmed. John started traveling all over the country looking for menial jobs to make ends meet; they never held an address for longer than a month, and John worked mostly under the table, effectively dodging paper trails. Not much information is available on Dean’s childhood; teachers recall him being a good kid but clearly troubled, and fiercely protective of his little brother once he was old enough to attend school. Somewhere along the line, around the age of sixteen, Dean dropped out of school for good and went on to get his GED. Sam was still being enrolled in schools even as they moved, and always made excellent grades. Records indicate John fell off the face of the earth when Dean was eighteen, leaving fourteen year old Sam in his care. Dean and Sam put down roots in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, where Dean got a job at a mechanic shop and was declared Sam’s legal guardian. Sam was on the fast track to graduate as valedictorian and score a full ride to Stanford, where he was planning on studying pre-law.
“Oh, baby,” Mary reaches over, awkwardly across the center console to bring Dean as close to her as possible. It’s uncomfortable, but her embrace is never unwanted, so he buries into her as best as he can. “You be yourself. Safely. And don’t feel ashamed, Dean.”
“The person left in our universe,” Sam says. He sucks in a breath through his teeth, then says, “Jack.”
“Shit,” Dean slumps back in his chair. “This is an accelerated timeline. We’ve only been here for four months.”
“I know I’m not Michael. But I can’t help that feel as though any relationship Dean enters will be imbalanced. He’s a good kid, Daph. Smart and kind-”
. The public loves it when pretty people commit crimes. Even Castiel had taken note of the trial, watching the way Dean Winchester would swagger in and out of the courtroom with the air of a model rather than an inmate. He projected himself as cocky, boisterous, and charming. He even has a fanclub, Castiel had learned a few days ago while knee-deep in research. Men and women who profess their undying love for Dean, uncaring of whether he’s guilty or innocent.
Some tension bleeds from Dean’s body as he reaches up to grip the vertical bars with both hands, wrapping his fingers elegantly around the steel. His face still reads nervous, but like he’s done it a million times before, his body starts moving around to the sweet chords of the song. The murmur of the crowd brightens and intensifies with the song and the start of Dean’s dancing, all the noises appreciative and positive.
he doing? Michael’s life is so far removed from Dean’s own. He works at some big wig tech company making six figures a year, lives in a freaking condo, drives a fancy car and probably doesn’t own a pair of jeans. Even if you totally remove the whole “he beat me as a prostitute” situation, Dean’s not really sure if it makes sense to be with him. He’d already asked Michael what was so special about him, and while the answer seemed believable enough, Dean has artfully not thought about it. Knowing each other at their lowest lows is one thing, but what about the highs?
“Fuck,” he groans, flopping back into bed and covering his face with his hands. What kind of idiot is he? He
“I have a furnished storage unit,” Castiel replies easily. Michael falls to the ground with a thud, though how strongly Castiel holds him is… damn. His arms look good. Michael easily weighs one-ninety, and Castiel’s just hauling him around like a fat watermelon.
“I didn’t know it’d be like this for you, though,” Dean continues, his voice gentle. “M’sorry. For what it’s worth, I thought it’d be different this time.” The chains rattle with movement, and there’s suddenly a blinding
And so, he hooks. He sells his body for top dollar- at least what he thinks is reasonable- all while working at the grocery store, the tender age of eighteen. He visits the clinic frequently to make sure everything is in good order even though he does his best to practice safe sex, but it doesn’t take long for him to realize that working overnights at the grocery store is hindering him from getting the most money. All the sleazeballs are out when the rest of the world is asleep.
Shrugging, Castiel pulls his glasses off of his nose and runs a hand through his hair. “Why not? I avoid them at all costs, but I think… getting lost in the mundane and overdramatic problems of others would be a good way to pass the time, not thinking about my own impending doom. The vocabulary and word count of those books isn’t great, so there’s a good chance I would be able to finish it before my demise.”
Heavy metal blares from the speakers of the Impala the closer it gets. Castiel looks over, able to see Dean hanging out of the passenger seat, his butt on the window sill and a grenade launcher perched neatly over his shoulders. Sam has a bazooka propped over his left shoulder in the driver’s seat, the butt of it braced against the backseat behind him, his left hand on the steering wheel and his right hand on the trigger.
Huffing, Dean sits up and quietly gets out from the covers. He sneaks out of the bedroom, keeping all of the lights off as he heads to the kitchen to snag a glass of water.
Dean stares at the ground, not saying anything. Sam looks like he wants to reach out and touch Castiel, offer him comfort in some way, but they all stay on their points in the triangle. Castiel feels the hollow ache in his chest, does his best to not let his knees weaken and collapse. This feeling in his chest is so…
“All of it?” Castiel asks, staring at the mess of papers on his coffee table. “Collectively, perhaps three weeks. Making the connection of his dad’s journey to Dean’s journey started out as a wild hair and then finally caught. My research on Dean started the moment I got off the phone with Pamela.”
That perks Castiel up immediately, the sudden motion jerking one of his elbows so violently he knocks over a pen holder. Scrambling to right the wire basket and stuff all of the pens and pencils back inside, Castiel grabs his notepad and flips it open to a blank page, snatching one of the pens trying to valiantly roll off the ledge of the desk. “Pamela. What can I do for you?”
When Dean walks up to the bar the night is dark and the buildings are lit up, neon and beckoning. There’s a line to get in and he stares at it for a moment, wondering if he should get in line with everyone else. Castiel hadn’t really said how to get into the club, so it would make sense to queue… oh. Any guesswork is taken out of the equation when the bouncer whistles and waves him over. Dean’s wearing nice jeans and a passable t-shirt, his duffel bag slung over his shoulder, the contents not weighing much but the bag heavy as an anvil with anticipation.
Dean moves his head from side to side in contemplation, then smiles, the whites of his teeth visible in the rear view mirror. He’s old. He’s no longer the boyish man Castiel had interviewed in jail. There are crinkles at the corners of his eyes, impressions near his lips. He’s gorgeous. He’s alive. “Y’know what? That’d be kinda nice, actually.”
He’s jolted out of his head when John slams on the brakes as he parks. He’s out of the car first, so Dean is the one to open the back door and shuffle Sammy out, holding his hand, following the hunched figure of their father into the hospital. He knows where to go, brushing past nurses and other patients, navigating the endless maze of corridors.
"One second!" Dean yells in surprise. He pulls off his high heels, kicking them under the bed before dropping to his knees, surrounding the baby pink shoes with week old dirty laundry. He pulls pajama pants over his underwear, scrubs the lipstick off his mouth, then checks his appearance before opening his bedroom door. "Yeah, dad?"
This stalls Dean’s brain for a second. Gears and cogs tick and turn and he can’t quite fully understand English for about a minute because it’s not a question that crossed his mind even once. His brows knit as he stares at Sam, who seems equally dumbfounded by the question.
Dean hadn’t been blind to the ring on Castiel’s finger, but Castiel hadn’t ever mentioned his wife. Now it’s obvious, because under the collage of wedding photos is a eulogy, a beautifully engraved piece of wood marking
But the more he reads the information Sam gives him, both from research as well as personal anecdotes, he starts to feel an odd twist of anxiety in his gut. These dreams about Dean, he starts to realize, aren’t just dreams. Though Sam doesn’t say it out loud, there are subtle insinuations in his text about Castiel and Dean’s relationship.
“Zilch.” Charlie sighs, walking back towards the table to flop down into her chair. “No facial recognition anywhere.”
Dean finds out he’s downright charming at the end of his first shift when he counts out his tips on the bar and nearly feels himself go woozy. It’s about as much as a john would pay him for a night, which in retrospect a hundred customers versus one customer wasn’t a comparison, but the fact that he earned this money without putting his mouth anywhere near anyone’s genitals was incredible.
Trying to backpedal, Castiel clears his throat and picks up his mug. “I had an idea of what I was getting into when I first helped you. Surely you don’t think me shallow enough to change my mind over one mistake.”
Being rejected from a strip club stings in a different way. Not because he got turned away as a customer, but because he got turned away as
“Good.” Benny reaches to gently grip Dean by the elbow, expertly guiding him through all of the bodies to approach the bar.
An image of Dean, five years old and shy at the foot of his parent’s bed, flashes in Castiel’s mind unbidden. Blinking and shaking his head, Castiel nods his head toward the foot of the bed. “Wound up?”
“Basically the real deal,” Dean says, “with the timeline altered here and there. Each time we get thrown in a loop the base story stays the same but some of the details get tweaked. Usually, one of us dies and that signals the end of this world and the beginning of the next.”
“Fuck,” Castiel breathes out, standing up. His whole body is hot, like the clothes on his skin are close to igniting. He's reading the words on the paper but it sounds like they're being broadcasted directly into his brain.
“Mrs. Winchester,” the principal says, more severely now. “His personal life is none of your concern. Your boy will be suspended for three days as well. He might look roughed up, but I’m sure you saw everyone else. He alone caused that damage.”
“I did some research on media folks,” Dean says with a shrug. “Got a lotta time to kill here. All of the people who wanted to interview me were… boring.” He sends Castiel a wolfish smirk. “Not nearly any of ‘em were as good lookin’ as you. Was real disappointed your name wasn’t in the hat, angel.”
up,” Charlie says, reaching for the computer mouse. She clicks around on a few things and then turns the monitor towards Castiel, showing him a strange collage of every time he’s been spotted on any camera. The bank, the grocery store, gas stations, clubs… Her system is thorough. If this man had been anywhere, she would have found him.
Sighing loudly, Dean slumps a little. He pushes around his food with his fork, still starving but unsure if he can eat while talking about the current topic. "I… can't stop thinkin' 'bout it, though. What if… he's really sorry?"
Castiel wakes up every morning at promptly six a.m.; showering takes fifteen minutes, dressing another ten, and depending on what he decides to prepare for breakfast, he’s seated at the small, two-person table in the kitchen by seven-thirty to enjoy his meal. It was important to keep a schedule--not only for his neurotic personality, but also for his new roommate to keep tabs on him.
Leaning forward, Castiel watches her boot up her laptop. Sure enough, multiple tabs are open on dozens of different articles and references. Shifting in his seat, Castiel downs half of his coffee before reading through things. His eyes narrow, and narrow, and narrow further as he reads along, brow furrowing at the absolute lunacy of what he’s reading.
“Mom, I know about the birds and the bees,” Dean says with a near whine. They leave the school building, crossing into the parking lot towards Mary’s car.
Castiel doesn’t even know what he’ll be doing. Will it be a taped confession, a macabre movie left behind for people who want to study him? Is Winchester trying to clear the air before he dies, a last reach for humanity before lights out?
The hysterical laugh that bubbles up from the pit of Dean’s belly is unstoppable. He lifts his hands, covering his mouth, feeling his eyes water in a mixture of anxiety and disbelief. “
Castiel tries to think back to before university, but… his memories fuzz. He can’t remember anything pre-college. Not his family, not his friends or where he lived. Thinking that he probably just needs more (restful) sleep, he shrugs. “I believe I read it before college, but I know I took some classes on religious theory.”
“She fell in the kitchen,” John says. He opens the back door, pushing Sam in. After a second, he apparently decides that’s where he wants Dean, too. He follows his brother in, crowding against him, unconsciously seeking out to shelter him. John gets behind the wheel, knuckles white. “It happened an hour ago.”
Castiel starts picking apart his muffin. “Have I told you what Dean has told me? About his victims?”
Dean pulls his face away from his hands. His eyes are brimming with tears, his makeup slightly smudged from the force of his sweaty palms against his cheeks. He’s devastatingly beautiful. “That was…” he sniffles a bit, then offers a watery, shaky smile. “... incredible.”
He sprints up the stairs to his apartment, knowing his feet will carry him faster than the elevator. Once inside he sees Charlie asleep at the kitchen table, her cheek on an open book, hair in disarray and some drool dribbling out of the corner of her mouth.
Sitting down as well, Castiel makes a soft noise before pulling something out of his pocket. It's the crumpled up business card Michael left a few days ago, the one he'd shoved into his apron and totally forgot to throw away.
He won’t barge in on Dean’s personal affairs like that anymore. Dean’s been very good at coming to him with problems, so Castiel will just have to wait for that to happen. He doesn’t want Dean to get hurt, and he still has an odd inkling about Michael, but he’ll do his best to not butt in.
“All of her degrees and mumbo jumbo are fabricated! Pamela Barnes might not even be her real name. I’m serious, she literally
“Dean,” Castiel’s voice is mildly disapproving, in that fatherly tone that kinda sorta makes Dean’s toes curl. “What if those calls are to tell you when he’s coming home? You don’t want to be surprised by him showing up unannounced.”
The whole thing looks like it’s vibrating, even where it rests in his fingers. He squeezes his eyes shut, not feeling the paper moving at all. He opens his eyes again, watching in a strange fascination as the symbols vibrate and rearrange themselves all over the page. They leap and jump over one another, slotting into places and creating entirely new sentences. Focusing, the ringing in his ears starts to pick up little by little as he starts to absorb the lines.
While Benny took care of John Castiel had gone around to the neighbor’s houses, hoping he’d find someone who’d be able to help the boys. Their neighbor, Donna, had been very solemn when she opened her front door. She explained she could hear John on a rage, and how unusual it was for him to be yelling this early in the morning; her eyes had widened when she saw Benny escorting John to a police car, and then she had thrown on a robe, slipped on some shoes, then barreled past Castiel so she could go into the Winchester home.
“What did we learn?” Castiel asks. It’s the same question he asks himself every time he does an interview.
Dean blinks. "Did you… miss the whole implication that you and I had relations while I was under eighteen, or-?"
And it’s all he has, he knows. The conversations in a white room with Dean chained to a desk while they debated the paranormal or talked about anything other than what could be fashioned into a proper journalist story are the most solid experiences he can draw on from this world. Those entangled with waking and sleeping dreams where he could feel the wind in his hair and the sun on his face and hear the laughs of the people he cared about most… That’s real.
“I don’t wanna pop your bubble, Cas, but your guys’ relationship isn’t the most cut and dry. You’re friends, but you’re more than friends, but you’re also a father figure…” she hums. “Do you think your actual kid would tell you if they were crushing on someone?”
The outburst falls quiet, the walls of the room nearly shrinking in on them when Castiel realizes what he’s said. His eyes widen behind his frames, color draining from his face, and then he fumbles a hand to the panic button under the table, pressing it. No noise blares from anywhere, but some lights flash and then Victor is coming through the heavy door with a thunderous expression. Castiel stands, holding his hands up.
“I mean- yeah,” Charlie lets out a little laugh. “But there are some tangible points to it, too. It’s kind of a gigantic mess, but- what I
“I’m not your enemy,” Castiel says softly. His eyes, big and blue and usually so guarded have a sliver of truth in them in this moment, as they regard Dean. It looks a lot like vulnerability. But it’s gone between one blink and the next, Castiel’s black-and-white mask slotting back into place. “I… care for you, Dean.”
his story. Cameras weren’t allowed inside the courtroom, but they were posted up everywhere outside. Every news channel, even some non-news channels, were reporting on the Winchester case. Dean showed up to every court date in fitted suits, hair gelled, dimples on display and green eyes bright as he pleaded guilty on all counts.
Charlie’s hand is hesitant where it rests on his shoulder. That itching sensation starts up again; he shrugs his shoulders, rolling them, then turns around so he can look at Charlie.
“I see.” Castiel only feels a mild relief that things will turn out alright. The fact that the boys have already gone through so much is what hurts the most.
“A group of American artists studying the Italian greats. Paintings, drawings, sculptures, and many other pieces of art,” Michael explains as their tickets are scanned at the door.
Chastised, Dean stuffs his hands into the pockets of his jeans and waits by the door that leads into the garage. He takes another look around Castiel’s home - warm and comforting - then does his best to push it away. He won’t be back any time soon.
“No-” Castiel idly waves a hand. He sets down his fork, pushing his plate away so he can lace his fingers on the table and level Dean with a firm, but caring gaze. “I meant it when I said your money should be going towards the things that you want.”
“Yeah. But! I did research on those and have ruled out literally everything. So I’m stuck. I’ve e-mailed a few different religious scholars at a few universities posing as a curious student but if any of it gets flagged, we’re in huge trouble.”
“Yeah, thanks dad,” Dean says with an eye roll, passing by Castiel. He grabs the duffel bag, swings it over his shoulder, then disappears into the bathroom.
“Is my wife ok?” He cuts to the chase, the dread spreading through his body making him nauseous. “The baby?”
“I’ll go with you when you send them off,” the boy offers. “We can make faster work and get ‘em outta there before the cops come sniffing around again.”
“No-” Dean stops himself, then looks at the couch with consideration. “Maybe… just lie down on the couch for a bit.”
“Dad, c’mon, let’s just go,” Dean starts to say, reaching out like a little child to tug on his dad’s elbow.
“I’m calling in regards to your wife,” the voice says. “I’m Dr. Pamela Barnes at St. Peter’s Memorial Hospital.”
It occurs to him, as he starts filling up the grave he’d tossed the tarp in, that while he’d put an ad in the papers for a roommate to help with finances (really, he could handle all the bills himself, but he was saving up for a house and therefore had to pinch some pennies in this godforsaken after-boomer market), there could be another…
Rolling his eyes, he rubs his hand over his forehead and flops back onto his pillows. “I’m still unsure as to how I’m contributing to breaking the cycle. I haven’t
He wishes he could see the look on his old man’s face. He’s probably ready to blow a gasket. Sammy’s feet shuffle closer until the kid kneels next to Dean, cradling his head in his lap. Dean allows his eyes to fall closed. The voices start to muffle, the chaos lessening until there’s just soft white fuzz between his ears.
“It’s not fair that Dean is locked up while Sam can go out and lead a normal life.” Castiel leans against the open fridge door, staring morosely at a carton of eggs. He’s starving, but doesn’t have the energy to cook.
Dean casts one last look at his father before guiding Sam out of the room. They sit on the chairs in the hallway, pulling them together as close as they can go so Dean can keep holding his baby brother, whose tears refuse to dry, but whose body starts to tire. An hour later, Sam’s asleep. Two hours later, an odd beeping emanates from Mary’s room, a few doctors and nurses rushing in. There’s noise and commotion, Dean doing his best to block it all out, pressing his nose into Sam’s hair and shutting his eyes tightly.
,” he says firmly. “Because instead of divorcing his wife he instead chose to pay a minor for violent, aggressive sex. And now he’s divorced and wants to date you? Not to mention the age difference-”
"Don't be such a skeptic, Dean. There's an art history exhibit opening up next week at the museum and it looks really interesting. The Cafe by the museum has a delicious lunch menu." Michael's voice is chiding, but soft. A tone Dean has never been able to relate to him.
“Not at first,” Dean says. He lifts his gaze from Castiel's fingers, his expression carefully neutral. “I was with all the other buddy-boys for four months before I got sent in.”
“Mornin’,” Dean says first. He reaches out to the coffee mug, wrapping it in both hands and dragging it forward to put his face directly over it and inhale.
“I didn’t mean to peek,” she confesses, worry knitting her brow. “I want you to know I’m not mad, Dean-”
dates, days that Castiel would honor and celebrate. He goes back to this morning, waking up to an empty house and going about his routine alone. It wasn’t that rare; Castiel went for jogs, he went to the market, he had errands to run for his business. There was no note on the fridge, and he hadn’t thought twice about it. He’s been living with Castiel for nearly four months now- all through summer and into autumn. They existed so well sometimes they didn’t even talk. He tries not to feel guilt for not knowing what day it is, and tells himself that if Castiel had wanted him to know, he would have said something.
Sam’s small, so when he starts to help Dean up, Dean forces himself to get his feet under him. He recognizes Donna’s voice, the nice neighbor lady that’s always cheerfully inviting them over to mow her lawn in exchange for lemonade. Dean’s always known that she knew what John did to them. He’s never been more thankful for her presence in their lives. He’s guided to a car, put in the back seat, a solid, firm weight next to him. He leans on it gratefully, a slight jiggle to his right shoulder every now and again keeping him awake.
The corners of Castiel’s lips quirk. “Too much red tape, as I’m fond of saying. I’ve actually done a lot more good as a journalist than I could as a cop, I believe.”
“People who don’t conform to the norm,” she continues, “and maybe hide things for the sake of themselves or others. It could be their sexuality, it could be any preference, it could be… things they do alone when no one is around.”
Clenching his jaw to prevent himself from grinding his teeth together, Castiel listens as Dean and Michael have their fifth argument of the night. It’s always small and inconsequential, the things they fight about, and it’s more Michael picking on Dean than Dean actually doing anything wrong. The man is brash and loud and jokes about weird things, but he’s sweet at his core, loyal and beautiful. Even Castiel can see that.
“Sounds like you have an intimate knowledge of trashy romance novels yourself, so don’t try to act better than me about it,” Castiel replies, trying his damnedest to not let a smirk curl his lips.
“Holy crap,” Charlie says, after two hours of silence while Castiel relayed to her every bit of information he has uncovered not only on Dean, but John Winchester as well. “Holy Ghostbusters, Batman, this shit is CRAZY. How long have you been sitting on this information?”
“Oh my God,” he puts the ice pack back on his face, hiding the hot tears burning his eyes. What is this feeling? Shame? Guilt? Embarrassment? He’s definitely mortified.
Putting an arm around Dean, Castiel turns them to head inside the house. “Let’s get some breakfast in you.”
Oh, fuck. Performing in front of all the people out there? There’s gotta be over a hundred! And they’ll be looking at him? Or, some of them will? Or- oh fuck.
“It’s hanging up,” Castiel says out loud, remembering The Breakfast Incident very well from just three months ago.
“Y’do fine, Cas,” comes the muttered reply somewhere beyond the collar of the coat. “S’my dumb ass that gets in trouble, anyway.”
And of course it does! Why on earth is Michael interested in Dean now? What’s his angle? Is this a paid exchange?
hold against you. And you know I’m not--and will not--be perfect either, right?” He rests his forearms on the table, leaning towards Dean a bit. “Nothing that happens between us will make me stop caring for you.”
Of course, that doesn’t last long. His mind wanders. He thinks of the almost-mugging in the alley, the man who’d been so angry with him - yet not angry enough to actually harm him. He thinks of the shadows that the camera didn’t capture, and how they arched away from the man’s body, insidious and powerful. The image in his mind’s eye distorts a little; his physical eyes feel hot. He squinches his eyelids a bit to try and get the feeling to go away. It doesn’t really help. This migraine probably won’t be so easy to beat.
“We don’t know what’s fair or not, yet,” Charlie reminds him, though not unkindly. “I know you’ve got a gut feeling about Dean, and your gut feelings are always spot on, but we still gotta be sure before we can jump the gun on anything.”
Dean's eyes bounce over the man's clothes. Either he's a weirdo or he's an off-duty preacher; the suit and trench coat leave a narrow window of professions, none of which have any desire to get tangled up with someone like him. Not wanting to get wrapped up in that mess, Dean starts to edge away. "Thanks buddy, but uh. I got it from here."
The principal sighs, “I am suspending you until your mother can come in and we can discuss expulsion.”
Benny politely doesn’t mention that it’s barely four in the afternoon, and wishes Castiel a good night in return.
It takes Dean a moment to stop eating and give Castiel his attention. It’s a surefire sign that Dean knows exactly what Castiel is going to bring up, and that flares frustration whip-quick. Tamping it down, Castiel takes a drink of water.
? He’s sure his mom won’t buy him a pretty dress. Or tighter jeans. Or shirts that accent his body rather than hide it. Or, God forbid, makeup. It’s not that Dean wants to crossdress, necessarily - yeah he knows what that word means - it’s just… there are some clothes that make him feel better than others. More… delicate. Dad spends so much time drilling masculinity in his head, Dean started rebelling about a year ago, though in the privacy of his own room. He started accumulating… well, items. Soft shirts, frilly… undergarments. Maybe that makes him a crossdresser. Who knows, he’s only fourteen. He just knows what he likes, and he definitely knows what his parents won’t let him wear in public.
Castiel counts backwards from ten. Dean’s boyhood got taken from him the moment his mother died and he was forced to grow up. The rebellious teenage years were something he didn’t get to experience properly because John made it so. Now that Dean is comfortable and able to process some of his trauma, it’s only natural that he regresses slightly. Granted, having a twenty year-old teenager isn’t high on Castiel’s “favorite things” list, but he reminds himself of this in order to regain his patience.
As Castiel hurries out of the room, he does his best to ignore the sickening, pleasant twist in his gut at the nickname.
Sometimes when Castiel comes out of a memory-dream, it feels as though he’s died and come back to life. The sensation of his eyes burning from the inside out, white-hot…
As Kevin explains, he starts putting products on Dean’s face. He uses a combination of his fingers, sponges, and brushes. Dean tries to remember everything he uses and in what order, but Kevin kindly says that Dean can ask him any time for clarification. By the time Kevin is done and Dean looks in the mirror, twenty minutes later, Dean can tell his face is covered… but it doesn’t really look like makeup is on him. He can still see his freckles and his natural flush, but the bruises are gone. He still has a split lip, but that can be explained away. There is still some swelling, but without the discoloration he looks… well, normal.
was gonna wait for this but it's now pride month and what better way to think about pride than to read about these 2 idiots, one of whom owns a GAY BAR. hahahahahah
Sitting on the bed, Dean lets out a little sigh followed by a chuckle. “Yeah. Visiting them always leaves me with a lot of extra energy. You think I’d be tired after all that bullshit.”
“Cas,” Dean leans forward as much as possible. “Did you communicate with Chuck? Or someone who said they were Chuck?”
“It was then I was deemed a threat to those around me. So they tossed me into solitary, and the rest is history.”
The fact that Castiel had spoken up about Michael had been expected. Honestly Dean thinks he handled that conversation pretty well, if he ignored the fact that he was anxious with nausea for like, three hours. Now it’s around five in the morning and Michael is fast asleep next to him, blissfully unaware of Castiel’s inquisition. Well- ok, that’s a little dramatic. He’s… hell, the more he thinks about it, the fact that Castiel was so concerned is… nice. Y’know? Like, warm and fuzzy-ish. Dean’s stupid knee-jerk reactions to just assuming everyone’s on his ass for no reason is something he needs to examine, oh he’s fully aware, but does he really need to do it now?
“He just?” Charlie leans forward, rewinding the footage and playing it again. “Disappears? When the cameras go all fuzzy?”
Castiel accidentally lets the oven door shut too hard, the glass rattling. Wincing, he sighs and wipes his hands on a dish rag. “He’s dating an old john. One he said used to abuse him.”
Dean works on the Impala once he gets more ambulatory and can move without seeing stars. First he gives the interior a good clean; he rents a small shampooer and gets into every nook and cranny he can, by machine and by hand. Then he works on the outside: a wash, a wax, a buff. He carefully paints over any dings and chips in paint that have accrued over the years and by the time she’s done with her, she’s gleaming like a champ.
He stands in the doorway, surveying the room with his arms folded across his chest. The sweat that had accumulated on his body from the night is dry and tacky on his skin from the breeze from the window. He’ll need a shower, but he’ll make sure Dean is taken care of before he takes care of himself.
If Castiel dreamed anything, he doesn’t remember them upon waking. He actually feels a little more rested than normal and considers himself lucky, as he gets out of bed and dresses for the day. When he exits his room he doesn’t see any sign of Charlie and finally checks the clock - it’s just past six a.m., and it figures he’d be wide awake at this God awful hour. Charlie had bought plenty of groceries but Castiel knows she likes the coffee shop down the block, so he pockets his phone, puts on his shoes, and slips out the door. The air is cool against his face, waking him up fully, and he takes a deep lungful as his hands go into his pockets.
Castiel’s good mood immediately dissipates, anxiety ripping through him. “Is she alright? What happened? Did the baby come?”
Video-Castiel gets shoved up against the wall by a man who, going off of looks alone, doesn’t seem strong enough to beat him in an arm wrestling contest. There’s no audio, so Castiel relays the conversation verbatim to Charlie, and then the camera feed gets fuzzy and rolls on itself before it clears and Castiel is alone in the alley.
It takes nearly a whole minute, but Dean finally turns to look at his mom. It feels like his neck is breaking. Like all the blood knocked out of his skull is suddenly pooling in his gut, making him nauseous. His limbs shake. His vision blurs. He’s sitting still but his whole body feels like it’s vibrating, ready to rocket off the planet.
Castiel is violently reminded as to why he doesn’t date. The woman across from him, April, is pretty and smart, but she definitely has an angle. Castiel can’t tell if it’s sex or money. Most people “their age” going out on dates are looking for something serious, but so far Castiel seems to be scraping the bottom of the barrel. Just his luck, he supposes.
Thinking about how many times Dean ended up in the hospital and the police weren’t involved chokes him up. Gritting his teeth, Castiel runs his hand through his hair, then lets out a sigh and steps away from Benny. “Do you know the family that’s coming to get Sam?”
He dreams of being in the back seat of a beast of a car, riding Dean until they’re both spent and exhausted. He dreams of a memory foam mattress and watching Dean sink into it as Castiel pounds into him, shaping the bed into something new, something
! You’ve probably given Sammy PTSD! You’re gonna sit your ass down, shut up, and you’re only gonna talk to either of us
Therefore he makes himself dull for the daytime, so he feels extra pretty at night in the quiet of his own room, exchanging his Metallica tapes for pop music he’d rather die than admit to listening to.
“You got somethin’ you wanna say?” Dean snips, impatient. “If you’re not ready to order I’ll come back.”
The paper catches on fire in Castiel’s hands, incinerating completely, the ashes falling onto his coffee table in a heap. He falls back onto his couch, the pain in his eyes receding and leaving him entirely winded, his chest heaving and fingers shaking. Staring at the ceiling, Castiel processes what he just read. A declaration of some sort? Instructions?
The sound of the grenade launcher and the bazooka going off at the same time is surely deafening. Half a second after the explosions happen, the whistling of the objects flying towards them carrying gently on the breeze. Castiel closes his eyes. Michael’s thrashing intensifies, curses falling from his lips, his nails scrabbling and tearing at Castiel’s suit jacket.
“I’m a whistleblower,” Castiel says. “I look into things that the law is too lazy to follow up on and then hand it over.”
The following morning, Castiel wakes up first. Unsurprising, considering his internal alarm clock is set strictly at six. He  blinks his eyes open, stretches, and then rolls over to look at Dean, who is blissfully passed out, mouth open, snoring slightly. He’s sprawled on his stomach, pillows under his face and chest, legs askew. The blankets had been kicked down to his thighs, and at some point he’d unbuttoned his pajama top to release the heat. His skin is slightly flushed, his breaths are deep, and Castiel’s pretty sure he’s never seen him look so peaceful.
Some shouting on the other side of the track catches their attention. Slowing down a little, Dean sees Sam walking towards them, his backpack slung over his shoulder and Dean’s in his hands. Little fucker knows his locker combination?
In the time spent apart from Dean, Castiel regains his energy. It never peaks, though; it stays as a steady buzz, enough for him to drag himself out of bed and to work every single day, enough to make sure he eats and caffeinates and turns in tasks on time. It’s enough to continue to visit Benny’s bar, though those trips tend to dwindle in length, and it’s enough to keep up the illusion that he’s a normal, functioning human.
. “Most of the guys in here- they ain’t stupid. I mean, some of ‘em ain’t smart, neither, but what can you do but play the cards you’re dealt? So these guys figured out that I was offering this guy cop outs, and that didn’t go over too well. One day at lunch, the biggest one came up to where I was sittin’. Alone, mind you. This big’n comes over and just…” Dean, hands still entwined, makes a sweeping motion with them. The chains attaching his wrists to the table clatter loudly, jolting Castiel minutely. “Knocks my whole tray to the floor.” Tipping his head back, the smile that curls over Dean’s lips is… terrifying. “Can mess with me all you want, man, but
“‘Scuse me sir,” Benny’s drawl washes over Dean like a balm. “Valley PD. I received a concerned phone call and there looks to be a problem here.”
It hurts. He’s upset Dean, and it sits hot and uncomfortable in his chest. He knows he’s not in the wrong, bringing up his concerns, and Dean isn’t in the wrong for defending his own actions and choices. They’re at a stalemate.
“You’re Cas, right?” Donna asks to clarify. He nods. “Then you’re the same Cas that Dean has only said nice things about since he started workin’ for ya. That boy doesn’t give out compliments, ya know. Besides, good friends see each other through their worst and wait to celebrate the best.”
Dean’s eyes narrow slightly; not in threat, but in… assessment. Castiel feels like those eyes are piercing directly through him, flaying open every inch of his being to peer into the depths of his existence. Castiel isn’t sure what Dean is looking for, but Dean seems to find it, or perhaps give up, because he relaxes back in his seat and shrugs.
Castiel!” His grin turns a little manic, overtaking his vessel completely. John Winchester is a stranger. “God is gone. This time, for good. Once again you weasled your way out of the Empty with your incessant talk of “free will” just in time to break the cycle of your human’s fate. For love! Come
. I didn’t say nothin’ or give you a reason to ask and that was stupid of me.  So… I’m- I’m sorry, Cas.”
“Lunch?” Dean hazards. He holds the water bottle by the nozzle with his teeth, frowning down at his phone. They’re all missed texts from dad. “Huh.” They all range from “picking you up after school” to “picking you up early” to “I’m calling the school to release you” and… Dean doesn’t like the feeling in his gut, at all. No voicemails. “Dad never texts me. That’s weird.” Pocketing his phone in his track pants, he finally takes a deep drink of water. He playfully squirts some through his teeth at Sam, who yelps and dodges away.
Dean sits back in his chair. His hands and arms flex like he wants to cross them over his body, but he refrains, and for that Castiel is grateful. The boy has learned a lot over the past few months about how to communicate with others (not just Castiel) properly, and it’s good that even though Dean is likely going to get irritated at the conversation, he’s keeping his body language open.
on the door to the club. His hand in Benny’s, Dean looks like an elegant princess being led to her carriage, the soft smile on his lips suddenly making Castiel regret having Benny lead him to the cage and not himself. From here Castiel can’t tell makeup details, but Dean is absolutely
By the time he slips into bed under the soft, cozy comforter, eyes out the window and on the moon, he feels peace like he’s never felt before. He feels safe and cared for, loved, even.
“You’ve been through a lot, Dean,” Castiel says softly. “You’ve handled everything remarkably well.”
"It may not look like much now," Castiel finally says, gesturing around. "But at night this place turns into a dance club. That wall over there is actually a partition. The restaurant is open to all ages until nine o'clock, and then it becomes a full service night club."
“What is the purpose of this interview?” Castiel can’t help but ask. He’s leaned back in his chair but is stiff, legs crossed, fingers folded in his lap. “My name was not in the pile of applicants who requested one-on-one time with you. I wasn’t even aware you were being held in this facility.” After a pause, he asks, “How do you know who I am?”
“Woah!” she recoils and waves her hand in front of her face, laughing. “I was just coming to make sure you’re still alive.”
Benny. Castiel thinks it’s Benny’s fault that Dean got grabbed. Rolling onto his stomach and burying his face into the pillow, Dean does his best to calm down. He can’t go up to Castiel, guns a blazin’. That ain’t right. Castiel doesn’t deserve that. But he
“‘Kay,” Dean mumbles. Castiel heads into the kitchen and Dean takes off his shoes before lying out on the couch, grabbing the hand-knitted blanket off of the back and wrapping up in it on his side. He stares morosely out of the big picture window at the cheery blue sky outside, feeling miserable, but also feeling surprisingly ok about how miserable he is. He can stop worrying about every damn thing.
Benny hoots a laugh. He lifts his beer, clinking the neck with the water glass Castiel holds up in reply. “Fuck yeah, brother.”
“Well, without sounding pompous, I’m your dad. Well- everyone’s dad, really. I like people to call me Chuck, but you might know me as God-”
Humming a little, Castiel turns his gaze back to the scenery not fifteen feet in front of them. “Quiet. Daphne and I took a walk around the cemetery like usual, and now I’m here, like usual.”
Quiet settles over them. The more time they spend together, the more Castiel learns that for all Dean chatters, he also appreciates the silence that Castiel often gives him. Sometimes words are pointless, or Castiel is just plain awkward, so there are times when he just doesn’t say anything. Dean takes it in stride and never pokes fun at him for it.
. For so long. Or- at least it seemed that way.” The brothers stay quiet. Suddenly the weight of everything infiltrates his senses- his eyes burn hot, frustration grips him, his fingers digging into the sleeves of his battered suit jacket. Finally, he looks at Dean, gaze unwavering. “What I do know, is that I was guided to you for a reason. If what you say is true, that you’ve been bouncing between realities and unable to get close to me or even find me… then we must move quickly.” He looks back down at his book. “All I had in this universe was my job and false memories implanted into my psyche to make me believe that I’d been here all along. Dreaming of you…” his voice softens, his eyes flitting back up to Dean’s. “Being in the same room as you. Whatever… whatever that is, I know it is right.”
That’s it. Tears prickle in Dean’s eyes, hot and unbidden. Sam looks mildly alarmed at the change so Dean rips his gaze up to the ceiling, feeling his brow tremble and his throat start to close. “Cas, that’s-...”
And Castiel, sweet, amazing Castiel, sweeps in like Ironman and says, “You’re welcome to stay with me, Dean.”
Naturally an early riser, Castiel is already in the kitchen by the time Dean shuffles in, looking rumpled and adorable in a threadbare tee and pajama pants that might be a size too big. Castiel’s got breakfast on the stove, likely the reason Dean even got up before eight a.m., and once Dean has a seat Castiel puts a steaming cup of coffee in front of him.
writing this story has been a strange experience because i started writing it with a technique i've never tried before... let me know of any continuity errors and i will fix them.
Castiel works his jaw a few times, shaking his head, massaging his right temple idly. “Tinnitus.” He stands up. “Perhaps I need more sleep. I think I’m developing a migraine.”
“Yeah?” Dean asks, crunching into the fruit and spinning on heel. He has his backpack over his shoulder and his shoes on, ready to head off for the morning. The tone in his dad’s voice puts his hair on edge, but he fights through the spike of anxiety in his gut as he crunches into his apple.
“I’m gonna speak as plainly as I can without anyone else catchin’ on,” Dean says. Castiel’s eyes bounce around the room to the posted cameras, before he shuffles forward and sits in the chair opposite Dean once more, the metal legs scraping on the concrete floor. Dean leans forward and his light is not only bright, but it’s warm now, and Castiel automatically leans into it. “You and Charlie have to break the code.” Castiel opens his mouth to ask how on Earth Dean knows Charlie’s name, but Dean holds up a hand to halt his words. “Break the code and then we all can get out of here in one piece. If she’s here and if Pamela’s here I think things are in our favor.  We can win this, and God can suck a dick.”
From the day he woke up from a nap to a call from Pamela Barnes telling him that Dean Winchester wanted to meet him.
When he hangs up he wipes the tears from his cheeks and puts his phone on the nightstand, curling up and snuggling as deep as possible into the blankets.
Sitting down in the conference room, with its stark white walls, fluorescent lighting, and bolted furniture, Castiel knows that Fridays symbolize two things to him.
He stays in contact with Castiel. The guy said he would “Take care of a few things” while Dean was out and understood that Dean didn’t want to return until his bruises were healed. Though he wouldn’t be dancing anymore, his face is still his moneymaker, and he doesn’t need a shiner advertising his shitty homelife while he’s trying to work for tips. Dean also wonders if Castiel got in trouble with Benny for having someone underage in the bar after-hours, but considering neither of the men make a peep of it, he figures that something had been worked out.
Eventually Dean and Sam come in, skin pink and clothes wet from playing in the snow. They head upstairs to change and dry off, wearing nice jeans and passable button-down shirts. Sam starts setting the table in the dining room while Dean swoops in to kiss Jo and Ellen on their cheeks, before donning an apron and putting on oven mitts to help with the hot food. It’s a family affair to get everything to the table, lots of shouting and smacking and “shut up”s thrown around. Bobby ambles in from the living room when it’s time for everyone to sit, and it’s him who takes the head of the table in front of a beautifully roasted turkey, electric carving knife in hand.
sure about. It’s a code I’ve never seen before.” She clicks around on a few things and then gestures at the screen again. “And I’ve seen, like, every code and cypher that exists on the web, my friend. This isn’t anything I’ve ever come across before.”
Castiel watches as some of the bouncers disperse the crowd away from Dean’s cage. Benny helps Dean collect his money, and then both he and Ash make quick work of escorting Dean back towards the employee area, the crowd generally polite and not bothering them as he’s whisked away. The DJ starts a new song, the crowd gets going again; Castiel hands his towel to Garth, asking him to take care of the bar while he goes to check on Dean.
what fondness is? Clueless and gullible, Dean is exactly who Castiel needs in his life to appear… normal, and to not raise suspicions.
At seven thirty-five his roommate, one Dean Winchester, blows through the kitchen in a whirlwind of “shit shit shit”s, improperly buttoned shirts and untied shoes. Late for class, as usual.
, but nothing comes to mind. He shifts his gaze to where John is staring at her, cheeks sunken in and eyebags puffy, his whole body tense save for where his hand tenderly holds hers. Swallowing, Dean licks his lips, tightening his hold on Sammy.
A pause. And then: “D'you know what solitary confinement is like?” Dean asks. The way he phrases the question allows Castiel to know that he'll tell him, with or without a reply. “Lonely.” Dean snorts.
“I know.” Leaning back in his chair, Dean stares up at the ceiling. “It’s just… things are nice right now, y’know? Just me n’ Sammy. Nothin’ to worry ‘bout but each other.”
Clenching his jaw, Dean wrings the steering wheel idly. It doesn’t seem like John is even going to apologize. Letting out a short breath, Dean says, “Out.”
“When he’s done at the station with John he’ll be coming by for statements,” Castiel says. He moves to sit in the chair next to Dean’s bed, resting his elbows on his knees and lacing his fingers in front of his mouth as he regards Dean. “Will you be pressing charges?”
"With all you've been through, Dean, it's very special that you have him." Their food gets set in front of them, breaking the mood. Michael puts his napkin in his lap, smiling across the table at Dean. God, he's pretty. "If you'll allow it, we can be friends. And, to answer your other questions…" he picks up his fork. "No one really knows
The lights are on in the living room, he can tell as he pulls into the driveway, but dim. The curtains drawn over the windows have strange shadows dancing across them. Frowning, Castiel wonders if Dean has company. Sometimes Charlie and Kevin come over for d-and-d sessions, but they’re usually home by now. When he parks in the garage and gets everything shut off and squared away, he’s surprised to hear loud music when he opens the man door that leads into the house from the garage. Maybe Dean
“I see Dean tomorrow,” Castiel says, cracking his neck to either side. Something settles in the pit of his gut, his eyes starting to burn again. “I think I know the right questions to ask, now.”
"And you're a liability," the greasy little man says, patronizingly patting Dean's cheek. His last tap is a little more firm than it needs to be as he says, "Get lost, kid. You don't belong here."
decoded has huge similarities to Enochian. Not one-hundred percent, because that would be too easy. But enough for us to try and translate. We don't have to believe it, Cas. We just have to read it."
“I don’t know,” Castiel replies. “I thought he’d been waiting in the alley for me, judging on the way he grabbed me and the direction he pulled me in.”
Two months into the school year trouble starts. He doesn’t know what triggers it, but suddenly in the locker room when changing from his gym clothes back into his regular clothes, some stupid kids surround him. Even in his plain underwear he feels vulnerable, but he covers it up with bravado as he looks around at all of the boys with a disgruntled glare.
The waiter leaves. Dean leans back in his chair, feeling more relaxed now that the air is clear between them. He arches a brow, "You don't wanna date me still, do you?"
The man’s gaze bounces over Castiel’s face, and then lands on the food and drinks in his hands. The intensity of the stranger’s expression melts into confusion and he takes a step back, seeming to collect himself. “You’re… not you.”
Castiel loves autumn because Daphne loved autumn. Every change of season was some sort of special to her, but she always said she loved autumn the most.
Castiel shoots vertical, wings flapping and heaving his body higher and higher into the sky. Michael follows, his wings a bit clumsy but his speed unmatched. He’ll catch Castiel any second now. A buzzing ticks in Castiel’s ears, twitching his eyes and jaw and causing his head to reflexively turn to the West where…
Michael’s eyes twinkle in the ambient light emanating from the bulb above the stove. He smiles, but the corners of his mouth seem… off. “What are you asking of me?”
He forces himself to get up and start his morning routine. As much as he would like to lounge in bed until Dean wakes up, something tells him that Dean should probably wake up alone. Grabbing a change of clothes he enters his en suite, taking a quick shower and trimming his stubble. He slips out of the bedroom and heads to the kitchen, starts a fresh pot of coffee, and then picks the newspaper up off of the front porch. He ambles around for a little bit, sipping his coffee and doing some minimal tidying. Sweeping, some dusting, putting away clean dishes. After the better part of an hour he starts fixing breakfast, toasting bagels and making an assembly line of eggs, cheese, bacon, and sausage.
. He’s meticulously organized and seems to have knowledge at his fingertips and is rarely short of an answer. He explains that they’ve all (yes, that’s Sam, Dean, and Castiel) been living in a bunker for a few years that houses the world’s largest collection of lore on things related to supernatural events and beings. Every time their timeline resets Sam has to rely on the knowledge crammed into his head, once remembered, in order to set things straight. Dean also has a plethora of information locked away, but he’s usually the one behind bars or in trouble, Sam explains.
Victor looks suspiciously between them. Dean’s expression hasn’t changed - he’s staring at Castiel with wide eyes, slack-jawed, and Castiel thinks he almost looks… wondrous. He goes without complaint when Victor unhooks his chains, doesn’t say anything as he’s escorted away, and when Castiel is left alone in the room he realizes how hard his heart is pounding. He pulls a handkerchief out of his back pocket and mops his sweaty face, nearly dislodging his glasses, before pressing the fabric over his mouth as his pulse jackrabbits against his throat.
"You have good intuition, Dean." Michael takes in a slightly unsteady breath, then holds Dean's gaze. "When I saw you- it was like a switch flipped. I had spent so much time convincing myself that I was meant to be married, start a family, and live a white picket fence life. But when I saw you all my repressed thoughts and urges…" he lets out a short breath. "You're beautiful, Dean. And I was captivated. And I handled it so damn poorly-" he cuts himself off, running a hand over his features. "I can't tell you how angry I am with
Castiel adjusts the reading glasses on the bridge of his nose idly. “The type of investigations I do aren’t built strictly upon interviews. I spend most of my time doing research and digging for information that isn’t easily accessible. Sometimes that leads me to talk to people, but I keep it to the bare necessities.”
He looks up to see Kevin rushing towards him, throwing his backpack on the floor and kneeling. Cool hands tip Dean’s hot head up, the other boy looking over Dean’s face worriedly. “What happened? Oh my- you need to get to the nurse.”
“Right-” Sam panics a little. “Ok. I’ll tell you everything, Cas, but you gotta put the gun away. And… you gotta trust me, ok? If Chuck called you that means the God squad is close to finding you, and we have to see if we can break the timeline before they do.”
, sweetheart, please tell me you got at least a sliver of faith in me. ‘Cause I ain’t leavin’ this timeline without you.”
In the hallway outside of the principal’s office, Dean and a few of the other boy’s sit while a few other boys get interviewed. His head is tipped back, an ice pack on his nose and tissue stuffed up both nostrils. All in all he came out of that scrap only a little dinged up. One boy has a makeshift sling, another has his leg propped. Smirking to himself, Dean thinks they’ll leave him alone for a while now.
He supposes that’s probably all he can do and, though it pains him that Dean won’t confide in him, promises himself to do just that.
Castiel replaces images of Dean in an orange jumpsuit with Dean in orange board shorts, freckles tanning his skin, soul so radiant the sun of the equator itself won’t shine as bright.
Desperately wishing to bring Dean into a hug, Castiel stands to refill his coffee mug instead. “There’s no rush. The beauty about having all of your needs taken care of, is to have the time to think about what you want without a hurry.”
,” Dean turns a grin towards Castiel, “if all the antimatter ever made by humans, living people, were annihilated at once… shit, you wouldn’t have enough energy to shock yourself on a doorknob.”
Resisting the urge to tense and curl in on himself, Castiel clears his throat softly. There’s no reason for him to be nervous about the invitation. In fact, as much as he knows about the Singer-Harvelle’s from his limited interactions with them in the restaurant, it’s not surprising that they’d extend a warm welcome to him for a family gathering. He’d been expecting it, honestly. He’s surprised Bobby Singer himself hasn’t rained down upon him with fists of fury and shouted inquisitions about “what exactly” the nature of his relationship with Dean is, though. He’s done his best to keep things strictly professional whenever he sees them in the restaurant but who knows what Dean tells them?
“Ready?” Michael asks. He hands Dean a ticket and, blessedly, doesn’t make a move to hold his hand or escort him physically.
unreliable when it comes to information on this language. It might even be considered a hoax language because some dude and, like, a psychic who claimed he could talk to angels wrote a book about it. It’s hugely popular in the occult world, though. Those professors I e-mailed will probably tell me I’m an idiot and turn me away, but it’s worth a shot. Because even if these dudes created it… what if there’s some truth to it?”
“You look nice. What’s the occasion?” Castiel’s curiosity is burning. Dean has been going out in the evenings, probably on dates, and either returning late or early the next morning. As much as he wants to be nosy and pry, he follows Charlie’s advice. Dean’s already had one father bring him down. Castiel won’t be the next.
“Even if I knew, I probably wouldn’t pay it any mind,” Sam says casually. “Death isn’t permanent. It’s just a date.”
“That you’re straight,” Dean gestures towards Castiel’s left hand, where the gold band on his ring finger shines in the early morning light. “I mean- kissing you like that was wrong for a lotta reasons but I just- I’m sorry. It wasn’t cool all around.”
Castiel blinks at the empty couch his best friend had just been occupying, and then follows her at a more sedate pace. “What about Pamela?”
"Friday morning." He almost says Sunday, but suddenly decides that he doesn't want Castiel knowing he's giving Michael a chance. He's a big boy, and doesn't need Castiel's permission for shit.
They eat in silence for a few moments, before Castiel decides to talk about what neither of them have been wanting to. “We haven’t necessarily discussed in detail the living arrangements.”
When Dean’s eyes meet his again, a chill races down Castiel’s spine, the hairs on the back of his neck standing up straight, eliciting another shiver when it stands against the starched collar of his shirt. Dean’s smile softens, sweetens around the corners, and he looks like any typical all-American boy next door.
He’s brought back to the present when a brush clatters against its container. Dean has tastefully applied a bit of blush, subtle highlight, and just enough mascara to darken his beautiful, long lashes. He’s lovely, radiant even, as he looks at his reflection. The silk blouse has a deep neckline, showing off his collarbones and the dip of his sternum, the sleeves loose and the wrists tight for an elegant, billowing effect. The hem of it is ribboned around his trim waist, slimming his figure, and with the combination of the men’s slacks, his body takes on an entirely different shape.
. He’s wearing a pastel rose lingerie set with lace detail, the strapless corset top stopping above his belly button and cinched to oxygen-depleting levels. The panties are clearly specially made with a support in the front so he doesn’t have wardrobe malfunctions, the backs of them showing so much cheek (and… bubbly cheeks, at that) Castiel briefly wonders if he should have
“Alright.” Dean’s voice brings him out of his thoughts. “M’ gonna shower then head off.” As he passes by Castiel, he reaches up and gently squeezes his arm while giving him a soft smile. “Get some rest.”
Heaving a sigh, Castiel buries his face in his hands. His shoulders are heavy from where Sam’s palms squeezed him, comforted him. His eyes are sore from… crying? No. From
Something flashes briefly in Dean’s gaze, before he nods and settles again. “You prefer to fly solo.”
The door shuts behind him, echoing nearly cavernously throughout the house. Castiel sighs softly, looking down at his bagel.
Castiel strips the bed. Dust flies into his nose, causing him to have a sneezing fit. He powers through it, stripping the pillows and pulling the curtains off the rod. He opens the window, closes the blinds, then carries the bundle of linen out of the bedroom and directly across the hall to the laundry room. He throws the bedding on the floor, deciding he’ll get to it tomorrow, then opens up his cupboards to pull down fresh bedding. It takes him another ten minutes to redress the bed and air out the room, refilling the little scent sprayer and putting it in a discreet corner.
He dreams of fine lines around his eyes, flecks of gold in the irises, softness on his lower tummy. That’s new.
Oh, fuck. Putting a palm over his eyes, Dean shifts to get out of the flow of pedestrian traffic so he can try and register the conversation. "I don't know what you want from me, Michael."
“You have bipolar two,” Castiel recites from memory. “You have severe, manic depressive episodes, you tend to have problems with aggression and alcohol, but other than that you don’t suffer from any sort of psychosis.”
Daphne’s voice makes him open his eyes. She’s sitting across from him in Dean’s vacated chair, looking beautifully soft in pajamas and a robe. He’s not startled; sometimes, when he’s very stressed, his brain conjures her up as a sort of coping mechanism, according to his old therapist.
Castiel chuckles as the scent of ozone starts to permeate the air. “The day I buried Daphne and Jimmy, it was raining.”
The only question is why these things spiked when Dean struck out on his own, leaving Sam with their ‘uncle’ Bobby Singer.
Huffing, blowing air through his pouty lips, Dean rolls his eyes. “If I didn’t I wouldn’ta said nothin’. Quit bein’ so insecure.”
Quiet settles over them for a few moments. Castiel regards Dean without shame or hindrance, taking in the slope of his nose, the fan of his lashes, the way his body seems almost slumped with exhaustion and relaxation. When Dean doesn’t say anything further, Castiel shifts his entire body. He moves pillows, fluffs blankets, and then settles on the left side of the bed, patting the right.
“You look good today, Cas,” Dean comments, his gaze roving over Castiel’s features - across his face, down his neck, to the decidedly casual outfit of a v-neck and well-fitting jeans. His eyes linger on Castiel’s biceps. “Casual Friday?”
“You wouldn’t consider your,” Castiel flips back a few pages in his small notepad, flimsy paper fluttering the stifling quiet of the room, “three hundred and eighty-seven victims ‘enemies’?”
Falling quiet, Castiel settles back. Then, a thought crosses his mind. "Did I ever check your I.D.?"
“Not quite,” Michael chuckles. “More like taking inspiration from famous Renaissance artists and creating their own original works.”
Nodding slowly, Dean licks his lips and leans back again. He seems to contemplate Castiel for a few moments, before saying, “Whaddya want outta this?”
“No, but you look like you could use a hot one anyway,” Charlie says with a grin. She gets out of the chair, twists her back to crack it, and then pats Castiel on his furry cheek. “Maybe get rid of this thing too, huh?”
Feeling that warmth blossom in his chest and spread through his limbs, replacing the anxiety and dread, Dean scrubs a hand over his mouth and smiles. “Y’know what, Cas? That actually sounds real nice.”
Everyone laughs, while a few other customers send them odd looks. Dean ruffles Sam’s hair lovingly, then pats his head a few times. “You can take me. I’ll even get a pretty new dress.”
Dean’s text hadn’t surprised him. The young man is intuitive and sensitive like no one Castiel has ever met before. As he settles on a bench he had carved out of a fallen tree many years ago, he waits peacefully for Dean to find the ping he’d sent him. The past few months have been mostly smooth sailing, hardly a thing rocking their boat.
It doesn’t look like John Winchester is bringing trouble with him, it looks like he’s following trouble and… getting rid of it.
Castiel startles awake at his desk, a hand slapping up to his face to automatically wipe away any drool that may or may not have accumulated on his cheek. This isn’t the first time he’s fallen asleep at his desk, and it isn’t likely to be the last, but he still manages to feel a curl of shame as he checks the clock and realizes he’s been out for the better part of the morning. Lifting his gaze to peek past his monitor he’s unsurprised to see his boss, Crowley, standing in front of his desk with an amused smirk curling his features.
Sam sighs. “This world would be perfect. Us, you, her as president. If Michael wasn’t trying to kill us, it’d be a great reality to live in.”
“He’s always happy when I have a fixed job,” Castiel says with a slight roll of his eyes, taking a deep drink of his whiskey and saying, “He says it keeps me out of trouble.”
Castiel is a little taken aback by the, admittedly, intelligent conversation Dean is initiating. He doesn’t think Dean is stupid- of course, that would be very dangerous. But the glint in Dean’s eye is… curious. Amused. Hungry.
“First place,” Benny says plainly. Castiel sends him an exasperated look. Shrugging, he cuts into his steak. “Dean’s done nothin’ but trust you. He’s been an angel since y’all started livin’ together. I think he’d listen to what you have to say.”
So he quits his job. There’s a scary two weeks where he’s sure he’s not going to be able to pay the bills and keep up with things, but once he gets into the swing of hooking, the money doesn’t stop. He tells John and Sam he’s still working at the grocery store, so he can be excused for being out from sundown til’ sun up, but when customers get rough, it’s a little hard to explain away a black eye or a split lip.
Yanking himself back at the tone of Castiel’s voice, Dean blinks at him. Realization dawns on his features and quickly turns to mortification, a flush spreading from his hairline all the way down to where the large jacket covers up the lingerie he’s wearing.
Licking his fingers clean, Dean suddenly can’t meet Castiel’s gaze. “Uh- well. Yeah, I guess.” Castiel pushes a napkin over to him, satisfied when Dean picks it up automatically. “A lot’s been goin’ on, and the whole Michael thing, and then spendin’ all day with the fam, y’know…”
“Is it pre-biblical or just a language that was around for a short amount of time and then died out?” Castiel considers out loud. The percolator clicks. He pulls down two mugs. He notes that it’s almost eight in the morning- they’ve slept in today, by their manic standards. Filling both their cups and bringing them to the table, Charlie doesn’t even complain as she drinks hers black. “Lots of languages in the world existed for a blip on the timeline before dying out, either because they’d been merged with other cultures or just because the people didn’t last long. Lots of undocumented languages exist in the world, as well.”
“Great,” Dean says flatly. He puts his notepad and pen back in his apron pocket. “Charlie will be your waiter from now on.” When he turns to leave, he’s stopped by Michael’s ironclad grip on his wrist. Dean whips around, bending to get into the man’s face so he can hiss under his breath, “Don’t fucking touch me.”
“Fuck,” Dean says with feeling, now fully awake. He sets his coffee aside and starts dishing a plate, piling a lot of everything on a bagel. He pauses, then looks at Castiel, “Did you eat?”
Free of the man’s iron grip, Castiel shakes out his shoulders a bit. “I am Castiel.” His gaze stays narrowed, jaw tense. “Do I know you?”
Blue eyes flick over Dean’s features for a few moments, studying, before Castiel finally lets out a carefully measured, “Thank you, Dean.”
Clean, but for the evidence of his dream crusting on his skin, Castiel falls back against his pillows, pressing the heels of his palms roughly into his eyes.
He’s wearing a flannel pajama set, one that matches Castiel’s exactly and had been a gift from Ellen. He pads into the room, looking a little sheepish. “I can’t sleep.”
Shaking his head, Castiel lets out a slightly strangled laugh. “No. But I won’t let you spend tonight alone.”
Making his way over to the table, Dean reaches out and smacks Sam upside the back of the head, ruffling his long hair and delighting in the yelp he got in return. “Show some respect, worm, this is my place of employment.”
“No longer a lady of the night?” The man asks, settling back in the booth. His words are casual, his tone a mimicry of it. His eyes are sharp as a hawk’s.
The buzzer sounds, causing Castiel to nearly jump out of his seat. Gathering his notepad, pen, and recorder, Castiel holds the items to his chest as his glasses slip down the bridge of his nose. Dean watches him quietly, and Castiel swallows past the lump of nerves in his throat as he tries to level his voice.
Standing up on shaky legs, Castiel clenches his fists at his sides before an eerie sense of calm filters through his entire system.
Dean doesn’t argue. He could sleep for nine years. Together they walk up the driveway and enter Castiel’s house, the warmth and homely feeling immediately suffusing gentle calm into Dean’s body. It smells like dinner--a savory one--some sort of scented candle, and just… Castiel. He’s gonna get drunk on it if he keeps inhaling like an idiot.
Something odd twists in Dean’s gut. He hadn’t known that today is the anniversary. Well--some part of his brain knew, the part that looks at the memorial on the wall, at the dates and the pictures, the information seeping into his brain through absorption rather than observation. But it didn’t occur to him that those dates were
“Right,” Benny flashes a sly grin. His attention is grabbed by another patron, for whom he pops open a beer and slides the bottle down the bar towards him. He looks back at Castiel. “Instead, you like bein’ the vigilante reporter that tips the cops off and helps them solve cases. What did you say about ‘em?” Benny scratches the scruff on his jaw as he tries to recollect, and then snaps his fingers with a bark of laughter. “‘They’re always caught up in the red tape.’”
He grips the handle with one hand, the blade in the other, looking at both the brothers. Sam starts reciting the incantation, the Latin falling from his lips like a native tongue. As he speaks Castiel cuts his palm, the blade so sharp he barely feels it. The blood starts trickling, Castiel’s wrist rotating to aim it towards the bowl. Crimson stains herbs, seeds and bones, his heartbeat quickening in his chest faster and faster and faster until it stops altogether. Breathing suspends in his lungs. His hunger and thirst disappear.
“Thank you for the invitation,” Castiel holds out the pie to her, which she takes with an appreciating noise. “Tripleberry with peaches.”
John’s hands tangle in the front of Dean’s shirt, pulling him up off the floor and shaking him until his vision clears. “
“Because I don’t,” Castiel says plainly. “I think you’re a good person that got mixed up into some bad things and that, last night, you needed support and had no one to give it to you.”
itself. Protection. Family. I won’t be ‘the guy that hired a prostitute’. If I’m anything, I’ll be ‘the guy that gave a man down on his luck a second chance’. But in all likelihood, Dean, in the bigger picture… we are a blip on the radar. No one cares about your past. No one really cares about us much at all other than if we can serve them a drink or show them a good time.”
“Dean.” Touched, Castiel shifts to lean in his seat, reaching out. His fingers gently brush over Dean’s warm forehead, his thumb dropping to trace the line of his orbital bone. Dean leans into the touch like a content kitten, lashes fluttering. Castiel feels something warm fizzle through his core, lighting him up from the inside. Pulling his fingers back with great effort, he meets Dean’s smile when the boy opens his eyes. “Thank you.”
Castiel nods, then regrets it when his neck cracks. “Michael said the Earth has been purged. I don’t know… how many are gone.” He exhales shakily. “I’ve escaped the Empty again.”
“You mentioned something about Charlie and Pamela being here, and that that’s important somehow,” Castiel recalls. “Are they… stuck in the loop as well?”
“I don’t-” he gasps for breath. “I don’t fuck him, dad. Wanna…” he coughs. “Wanna know what I do?” He can’t see John, unable to fully open his eyes. “I dance." A winded giggle. "On stage. An’ I wear… pretty lingerie…”
“You don’t know me,” Castiel’s hackles raise. Dean is speaking familiarly of him. Like they’ve known each other before this. “For all you know that’s my favorite parlor trick.”
Snapping his gaze up, Dean feels his cheeks flush. He could argue, but he knows his reaction would blow over any excuses he could make up. But Kevin doesn’t judge; he just smiles softly, sifting through the bottles and tubes and containers. He doesn’t say anything more. He just starts naming what he has in his hand, explaining its function and how to use it. Dean pays close attention, suddenly thankful that this shitty thing happened so Kevin can save him.
“Ok, but when you think about undocumented languages, you think of like… rural tribes and nations, right? Or even old people speaking a dying dialect?” She takes a deep drink of coffee. “I did a lot of digging before I passed out and I’m pretty sure in my dreams I bartered for two goats and a carrot from a Peruvian farmer. I don’t even speak Chamicuro. Which is a nearly extinct language, by the way.”
Dean nods. His freckles are bleached pale under the harsh fluorescent lighting of the room. Castiel wonders what they look like when the sun is kissing them.
“The cops were hassling me about some people seeking shelter.” He can’t hide the disapproval in his voice. “It’s going to get below freezing tonight and it’s supposed to snow.”
Funny how that’s what he latches onto. “I really like ballet. I’m not that great at it, and I’m still practicing flexibility, but I think it’s really pretty.”
“Dean and…” he chews the inside of his lip, unsure as to how much he should tell Charlie. But… she’s all he’s got, and if he doesn’t tell someone, he’ll go crazy. “It’s odd. Most of the dreams feel like memories that don’t belong to me, associated with flashes of moments and intense emotions.”
“Yeah, whoring out your boy pussy for cash!” John kicks at Dean’s side, winding him. “You think I don’t notice when things come into this house? Sam’s shiny new Playstation and your damn Whole Foods groceries?”
Castiel testingly lets go of Dean and, clearly satisfied that the boy doesn’t fall over, sends him a small smile. “I’ll finish dinner.”
Whipping around in surprise, Dean blinks owlishly before he laughs sheepishly. He grabs his phone from the pushed aside coffee table, cutting the music as Castiel sets his satchel on the kitchen table. “Hey. Sorry- I lost track of time.” His eyes drift to the clock on the wall, before he arches a brow. “Kinda late.”
Sandy hair, big blue eyes, dimples, the sweetest smile. A woman more precious than pearls, hands on her stomach, a ringing voice caught in his ears. Hugs, tears, pride and sadness-
“They seem a lot like caffeine,” Castiel says. “Even after you’re done drinking with it, the effects last.”
They leave quietly. As soon as the back door to the club shuts the noise is cancelled, all the music and cheers and laughter. The alley behind the bar isn’t particularly dreadful, but on cold, damp nights like tonight, it looks foreboding. Dean trails along next to Castiel. He doesn’t peep a word as they get into Castiel’s car, doesn’t say anything on the fifteen minute drive home. Castiel pulls his car into the garage and Dean follows his lead, the wretched
It’s the wrong response, because Dean’s walls immediately raise. “I ain’t easy, Cas. I wasn’t always a prostitute.”
Perfunctory and awkwardly formal. Rubbing the back of his neck idly, Dean decides to fix himself a bowl of stew and savor it while sitting at the kitchen table, gathering his bearings.
“Hey, buddy,” Dean greets his brother. “This ain’t the first time I been here. You don’t gotta be such a girl every time.”
“Good morning,” Castiel returns. He erases last night’s message off the whiteboard when he passes. “How did you sleep?”
That makes Castiel’s blood stutter in his veins. Outwardly he does his best to stay unaffected, tilting his head a bit and observing Dean’s charisma. “Your sexual orientation hasn’t been disclosed to the public.” Castiel notes. Related, semi-related, probably massively, totally, completely unrelated. “You’ve killed men and women, with no regard for gender or their own sexual and gender identities. It is widely believed that you killed at random, and could never decide on a ‘type’.”
Though he’s in hardly any pain, Castiel still walks slowly to the fridge. He pulls out a water bottle and uncaps it, chugging nearly the whole thing in a few swallows. He lets out a satisfied gasp when he pulls the bottle away, wiping his wet lips and chin with the back of his hand before looking towards where the brothers sit. Sam’s nose-deep in research, but he catches Dean looking- which has Dean whipping his head back towards his texts, ears burning.
Dean does his best to take everything in. He sees a stage at the far end of the building, a guy manning the DJ booth and allowing a select few people up on the stage to dance, but what really catches Dean’s eye are the people-cages scattered about. There’s a lone dancer occupying one, her body moving around gracefully with plenty of room, scantily clad and wearing so much glitter Dean’s blinded from fifty feet away. His attention is brought back to the present when they stop walking and Castiel’s voice rings in his ears, deep and throaty and shockingly pleasant.
his throat, the flesh mottling a morbid purple, teeth marks indenting the skin around the suck point. Dean’s fucking lost, anyway.
“Then drive us to the nearest beach,” Castiel says, relaxing against the downy, soft bed of feathers. He’s surrounded by ozone, dirt, gunpowder, and he’s fairly certain a bottle of Dean’s aftershave is stuck under the backseat.
“But-” the boy licks his lips, tilting his head back and groaning. “I don’t wanna just be some punk kid at an art gallery opening.”
He dreams of his own death, he dreams of wings burning, he dreams of catapulting through time and space and black goo. That’s new.
A sharp pain cracks through Castiel’s jaw. He grimaces and moves a hand to brace under his chin, forcing himself to continue reading. This is completely different than the stupid language he’d been studying. Some of the symbols are similar, yes, but the way they ebb and flow is completely different from how some sixteenth century scholars tried to pin it down.
“How do you normally do this?” Dean asks, pretty casually for a guy shackled and bound to both a table and a chair.
His smile melts into something a bit more genuine as he gently pets her red hair back from her forehead, meeting her gaze. “Go sleep.”
When pulled, Castiel knows the rope will draw a bridge. And with that bridge he will reach the other side of… whatever “this” is.
It’s… sad, really, Castiel thinks. Even if he weren’t intertwined in the Winchester’s lives, being taken out of one dimension and plopped into another to start over until your brain suddenly remembers that this isn’t reality must be difficult. They go through the humdrum of whatever life they’ve been given until a dream or a memory resurfaces and kicks off exactly what they’re going through right now. Sam says that so far they haven’t been able to break the loop. They start remembering things from their real life, Michael interferes, and they get zapped to a different alternate universe.
“Hello?” Castiel has the phone between his shoulder and ear as he drops the paint cans in the corner of the garage, along with the other necessities for painting. Drop cloths, plastic, painter’s tape, ladders, paint pans, rollers and brushes; all of it is neatly organized on the shelves, waiting to be brought into Jimmy’s room for the final makeover.
“Good, that was next on my list,” Castiel says with a nod. After a moment of silence, he chews his lip before starting, “Are you-”
Arching a brow, Dean uses the butt of his pen to tap idly against his nametag feathers slightly ruffled. “According to this, yeah.”
Wiping a hand over his mouth, stubble having grown into a short beard, Castiel stares at his computer monitor. For a few moments he does nothing. He stares at Dean Winchester’s mugshot from the first time he was officially arrested at the age of seventeen, caught too many times for juvie to want to deal with him anymore, and tries to see into his head. In the mugshot Dean is smirking, corner of his lip pulled up and brow relaxed as he stares into the camera.
Dean tries to shrug, but his gait makes him look more like he’s having a brief aneurysm. “Dunno. I mean- it’d be in our best interest. But I think Moondoor is far from Charlie’s mind when she meets with the Fairy Queen.”
“Right-o, my man,” the man smiles huge, ignoring the prissy woman in line trying to get his attention. “Name’s Ash. Go on in and find Benny- big ol’ guy, scruffy, biceps too big for his shirt. He’ll take you to Cas at the bar.”
“He only pretends he doesn’t like talking to the chief of police on a weekly basis,” Benny says with a laugh, waving his hand. “He n’ Singer got some interestin’ chemistry.”
Snorting, Dean takes a deep drink of his cocoa, coming up for air with a frothy chocolate mustache. "Does that make you feel better?"
When John heads up the stairs Dean lets out a breath, slumping against his door and running a hand through his hair. Talk about a close call. Shaking out his limbs Dean takes one last look at himself in the mirror, stealing a smile. Even despite almost being caught, he feels good. He’d rather his dad think he’s whacking off instead of… well… whatever it is he’s grown so fond of doing lately. Those thrifted heels really help him nail his routines with just a little bit more accuracy and flair. He’s happy there’s carpet in his room to muffle the sound of them, but he longs to hear them clap against a hard surface. Plus, sometimes the heel gets caught up in the carpet and he fumbles his turns- he’s landed on his ass so many times it doesn’t even hurt anymore.
are you doing!?” John tosses Dean to the living room floor, his voice roaring through the house. “You screwin’ an old man?”
He puts his face in his hands, resisting a groan as things click together in his brain. “I can’t have romantic feelings toward Dean.”
?” Dean whistles. The chains rattle as he moves. “I know it sounds crazy Cas, but your subconscious is tryna tell you everything you need to know. Dreams and hallucinations and all sorts of shit you’d write off as crazy. I was tryna get you to remember without outright sayin’ anything ‘cause Michael is listening, man. I ain’t playin’ games anymore, ok? Sam
“Mm,” Dean sits up, tired but awake. His eyes zone in on the bag in Castiel’s hands, reaching out to take it as he stands.
That catches his attention. Dean looks over at Kevin, grabbing some paper towels to dab his skin dry. “You do?”
Castiel nods. One question burbles through the anxious mess in his gut. “How many times have you been hospitalized, Dean?”
staying in a motel. I am not going to take advantage of you, Dean. I am offering you a safe, clean place to spend the night, and you will accept.”
Nothing perfect lasts forever. Dean’s experienced it firsthand, perhaps in the most extreme of cases. He’s gotten exceedingly cautious over the past few years about flutterings of happiness in his chest. He doesn’t think he’s jaded, not yet, but whenever he feels that nice, floaty sensation, he’s almost always waiting for the other shoe to drop. Working at
Shrugging, Castiel pours his coffee and moves to join Dean at the table. It’s quiet in the house, soft and suffused with… presence, even though it’s just the two of them there. “It was not an obligation, Dean. I asked you here because I wanted you here.”
Without thinking, Castiel grabs Michael by the shoulders on instinct, flipping him over onto his back to expose his wings and the flesh from Castiel’s forearms melted into the material of his coat. It’s quick and precise, the amputation of the huge wings, the angel blade not quite cutting through them clean, a sawing motion causing Michael to continue to cry out in anguish.
Pouring himself a coffee, he wonders where Castiel is. Who makes coffee and then doesn’t stick around to drink it? Ambling from the open kitchen to the equally open living room, Dean starts snooping around. Is it snooping if it’s all displayed? There are pictures on the fireplace mantle: Castiel and his weird brother he’s always complaining about, Castiel and a few friends.
Yes, Castiel is scared. He knows better than to let his guard down around Dean, knows what the man is capable of, what he’s been arrested and sentenced to death for.
John tosses him so forcefully back onto the floor his head cracks and his vision spins. His foot connects with Dean's stomach, searing pain ripping through his body. Delirious and figuring it can’t get any worse than this, a hazy smile filters over Dean’s lips.
“I clean when I can’t sleep and need to focus on something,” Castiel says distractedly. From behind Charlie’s chair he leans over, peering at the monitors. “What have you got?”
, which doesn’t exist in any of the realities Michael has made for us. So if we can get a lock on that and who’s inside, we should also be able to cross timelines and realities to make it home.”
Honestly, if Castiel had run into Dean on the streets, he wouldn’t have thought twice about him. Dean’s manners are occasionally awful but he has a good heart, is pure at his core, and Castiel can see that about him. Castiel doesn’t hurt nice people.
The boys lose interest when he sags to the floor, his shoulder against a locker as he groans and presses his palm to his sore stomach. He slumps over, using his other hand to brace himself on the floor so he doesn’t collapse onto it. He can hear the boys congratulating each other, high-fiving as they leave the locker room, taking all of the noise with them. Unsure of how long he stays on the floor, he hears the bell ring and knows he’s gonna miss English. Whatever. He can get notes from Charlie.
“Cas,” the chains rattle, “not that I don’t appreciate your efforts, but this is typically how it goes. Winchesters get themselves outta messes, y’know? You don’t gotta worry about me. It’ll all work out in the end.”
He doesn’t want to call anyone. Not yet. He shakes his head, a jerky motion that cranks his neck nearly the wrong way. Finally, he gets his mouth to work. “A quieter room would be preferred.”
until she showed up at the jail and said she’d be representing Dean.” Charlie looks prim. “And then the day after she picked him up, she put out the whole ‘put your name in a hat’ bid. The most she’s ever said in a court of law is ‘my client pleads no contest’. Which is neither an admission of guilt
"I don't have all the answers, Dean," Castiel admits. He rests his cheek atop Dean's head. "And I don't want to give you empty platitudes. Only the cliché that… time heals wounds. And now that you're living your life on your terms… I think it will come easier for you."
Letting out a sigh, Castiel drains his coffee. “Let me show you my work. Then, you can make your own decisions about what you believe.”
Fuck. Great! Castiel’s beautiful wife died and to carry on her passion he opened up a gay bar. He still wears her wedding ring. Garth says he’s never dated in all the time he’s worked there, which was basically since the day it opened. Oh fuck. Dean kissed the owner of the bar he works in, kissed a
before i knew what to do with it. i wrote this entire story out of order for quite some time, writing scenes as they came to me and trying to figure out how to tie them all together. this is why i've been warning for continuity errors ^^;;
Dean doesn't remember this. Often when Michael would go on his tirades Dean would just… go to his happy place, or whatever. Remove himself mentally from the situation and just wait it out. Michael's cheeks are flushed with shame, his grip on the fancy menu white-knuckled.
Sitting across from him now, Castiel still thinks he’s greatly unprepared; but, he’s always been able to roll with the punches.
John exits the car and doesn’t look back as he trudges to the front door, letting himself inside and shutting it softly behind him. Still filled with tension and adrenaline Dean backs out of the driveway and makes the cross-city drive to Castiel’s house, parking the car on the street at the curb and taking a moment to try and just
Dean's hair soaks and flattens to his head. He's wearing his nicest jeans and a black v-neck, doing his best to look presentable. He figured he'd hit the club first and see if he would have any luck, and then head out for his nightly rounds. Seeing as how the club was a bust and his mood sucks, he's considering taking the night off. Go home, spend some time playing Mortal Kombat with Sammy.
“What?” Some egg flies out of Dean’s mouth and skitters across the table to land directly in Castiel’s coffee.
“Because that’s not how you treat people, man,” Dean tries uselessly. As soon as the words are out, they feel like a lie. They feel like words spoken by someone else, physical on the wind--Dean can see them, read them, but they look like a foreign language, like something he can’t wrap his head around.
Suddenly unsure, Dean mentally retracts his demand for Michael to kiss him. It had been right there, right on the tip of his tongue, but something about the change in Michael’s demeanor has him second-guessing himself. He tries to gloss over what Michael surely knew he was going to ask by saying, “I just want to make sure that… we’re a good idea.”
Castiel hides his smile behind the rim of his whiskey glass as he takes another swallow. “It’s true.”
The door slams, the Impala roars to life, and Castiel is left alone in the kitchen, staring at the space Dean just occupied.
“But you’re not old enough to dance there,” Sam says obstinately, in the way only an annoying little brother can.
Castiel takes him past the stars and shoots through the solar system. His grip on his cock is too tight, he bites Dean’s neck hard enough to break the skin all so he can lick it back up. Dean returns everything tenfold, brimming with experience but impatient with the must-have. And oh, he knew he’d had a crush on his stupid asshole roommate and really, this should really fucking concern him, but honestly he’s just too fucking turned on to care. Bring on the dead bodies. Let Castiel drag him into an alibi. Let all the rude bitches in the fucking world burn to the Goddamn ground if it means Dean can peek past the mask to get at the real Castiel Novak beneath. He’s so fucking strong and hot and weird but then, what does this all say about Dean?
Fuck, how does he sound so… normal? Kind? When Dean knows what his knuckles look like swollen and bloody, when he knows how those hands feel wrapped around his throat. And yet… Michael didn't treat him bad all of the time. Some nights they didn't even fuck- Michael would just rant about his wife, then pay Dean to not say a word so they could spoon quietly for an hour or so. No guy who buys a hooker instead of a therapist is in his right state of mind.
Nearly dropping the gun, Castiel turns to sink into the couch, his expression slack as he stares through Sam rather than at him. Sam quickly kneels, taking the gun from Castiel’s loose grip and putting it on the coffee table, settling between Castiel’s legs and reaching up to grip his shoulders tightly.
The Singer-Harvelle house is two storeys and loved. What it’s lacking in interior design it makes up for with presence and comfort. Bobby is sitting in a recliner, legs up and beer in hand as the game plays on TV. He gives a grunt of acknowledgement when Castiel walks by, which he counts as a win. The entire house is suffused with that distinctive home-cooked meal smell, and in the kitchen it’s amplified. Ellen puts the pie in the fridge, and Jo sends Castiel a reserved smile from where she’s dutifully mashing potatoes.
A man like Dean Winchester won’t give up his secrets. It was just another cat and mouse game for him to play, another way to get his rocks off before he gets sent off to the burning hellfire waiting for him down below.
“You’re the worst med student ever,” Dean grumbles, feeling hysteria transform into twisted amusement.
Sam’s bright hazel eyes meet Dean’s. They’re wet enough for the both of them. His nose is red, his cheeks flushed, his lips bitten raw. Dean wonders what he himself looks like. Helping Sam off of the chair, Dean wraps his arms around his shoulders and tucks him close into his side. They enter the room, John still not looking away from Mary’s face. They stand on the opposite side of the bed as close as they can without being crowded by any of the equipment, Sam trembling next to him. Or is Dean trembling?
"I'm not the one offering a stranger shelter," Dean defends, suddenly feeling slightly self-conscious.
“S’fine,” Dean says, shrugging his bag off of his shoulder and setting it down. “Uh. I…” his cheeks heat, his ears reddening as he gestures towards his bag. “I brought an outfit.”
Lifting his gaze to Dean’s, Castiel is surprised, and nearly appalled, that he can’t think of anything. There’s a white fuzz, incessant in the back of his head. Silence hangs between them, and then with his voice just as soft as Dean’s, Castiel asks, “What is your proudest achievement, to date?”
The arguing ceases suddenly, a crack resounding. Castiel doesn’t flinch as he stands up immediately, throwing the door to his bedroom open so he can stand in the doorway and stare Michael down like a wolf to a rabbit. Dean has his hand up on his reddening cheek, green eyes bright, lips parted in surprise.
Finishing off his water, Dean smiles so huge Castiel can’t help but mirror it. “Awesome. I’ll clean up the living room and head to bed. Did you eat?”
If necessary, for any reason whatsoever, Dean would be able to corroborate anything Castiel may need to tell anyone at any given time.
Settling in, he regulates his breathing. His body relaxes from his shoulders, to his biceps, his ribs and hands, waist, thighs, knees and ankles. A wave of relaxation washes over him for the first time in what feels like forever. Surrounded by the hot, aromatic water, he allows his mind to go blissfully blank.
He spends the rest of the night folding and hanging clothes. There’s a table by the window that has a vanity mirror on it and a stool tucked under, which wasn’t there last time Dean stayed over. It’s definitely a new addition, and definitely something just for Dean. His heart swells. Shyly, like his dad will burst in at any second, Dean carefully lays out his cosmetic products on the table. The more he puts out, the more time passes, and the more reassured he gets that no one is going to barge in and tell him he’s wrong. He starts thinking about containers and organizers, about maybe even getting one of those mirrors that lights up (though being in front of the window here is amazing light).
Castiel glances over at him; takes in his freckled skin, a stray water drop stuck in the dip of his collarbone, the easy smile on his lips. "Sure." He rips his gaze away to focus on whisking the cocoa.
Castiel doesn’t dare to dissect the occasional simmer of attraction he feels for Dean. Not when he’s focused on helping Dean grow to be healthy and happy. Not when he, himself, is starting to truly find closure and peace.
“Who got rough?” Mary asks, whisking into the kitchen with a laundry basket on her hip. She catches sight of Dean, looking at him quizzically. “Baby, are you wearing makeup?”
“Tell ya what,” Dean says, plastering on his best brave big brother smile. “I’ll go in first, ok?” He doesn’t want to. “And if everything is alright,” please let it be, “I’ll come get you, ok?”
Blinking, Michael tilts his head. "I think I'm beyond anger, Dean. It's been a long time since I've been truly angry." He drops his gaze to his own menu. "The last time we were together- that's when I realized I was headed down a dark path."
The walk back to the apartment is much quicker than when he left. He shoulders open the door and is relieved to see Charlie sitting at the kitchen table with her face in her hands, sleepy and disgruntled. She perks up when he enters, then basically glows when he hands her coffee, setting everything else on the table.
“I’ll say,” Dean chuckles. He squirms. “And a little anxious. This past year… I guess- last night it all kinda hit me. So much has happened. I barely even thought about mom n’ dad yesterday, I was havin’ so much fun with everyone.”
Donna’s kindness and optimism grips him. He offers her a small, thankful smile, patting her hand. The nurse comes around to tell them that Dean’s awake; Sam immediately jumps up and runs past her, stuffing his phone and earbuds into the pocket of his hoodie. Castiel follows at a more sedate pace, unsure if Dean will want him to be here. Donna stays seated, sending him a reassuring smile.
, the material covered in clotted blood. He looks down at himself, taking stock of his injuries. He unbuttons his white shirt, surprised to not see a single bruise. He lifts a hand to his features, finding that he’s not swollen there, either.
All in all, they scrape by. It’s not the life that any of them deserve, but that life had been flushed down the toilet the second mom died. Dean’s hard earned money goes towards the house, Sam, and things like car maintenance and yard work so the neighbors don’t think they’ve gone to ruin. Not that it matters. The only neighbor that seems to give a hoot is a nice lady named Donna, who waves hello or even gets Dean to chat with her sometimes in the mornings when he comes home.
This is his last chance to say anything to his mom. She’s not awake to hear him, hell, it probably wouldn’t make a difference. He feels compelled to say
proof.” Putting his elbows on the table, Dean runs his hands through his hair, seemingly gathering his thoughts. “Now, antimatter. A gram of antimatter could produce an explosion the size of a nuclear bomb, right? Shit’s powerful stuff. It’s raw
Thirty seconds later the door opens again with an atrocious buzz, Castiel glancing up to see the same guard guiding Dean Winchester, serial killer, by the elbow towards the table. His feet are cuffed together at the ankles, his hands bound in front of him, the blue prison jumpsuit doing nothing to hide the breadth of his shoulders and the firmness of his chest. Castiel clenches his jaw to keep his gaze clinical as Dean settles in across from him. The guard attaches the chain of the ankle shackles to the legs of the chair and then fastens the chain of his wrists to the D-ring on the table, Dean sending the man a charming smile.
Shaking his head, Castiel leans back against his chair. He puts an elbow on the table so he can put his palm over his eyes, slouching down. “I don’t know.”
“Good evening,” the man says. He’s wearing snow boots instead of loafers, the height of them preventing the snow from soaking through his pants. He picks his way through the part of the driveway that hasn’t been shoveled yet, then chuckles as he approaches Castiel. “You have your work cut out for you.”
Shaking his head, Dean weakly reaches up to grab the front of Kevin’s shirt. He’s a nerdy kid, a real whiz with a super kind heart, and Charlie’s other best friend. “No. No, Kev. Just… help me up? Gotta wash off.”
John’s voice echoes through the neighborhood. Dean’s blood runs cold. Castiel is frozen behind the wheel. Pressing his forehead against the door of the car, Dean closes his eyes tight.
Nodding, Castiel squeezes Charlie’s shoulder. “Thank you. I’ll do that, and if I don’t feel better, I think I’ll take a nap.”
The silence is heavy. Very carefully, the brothers shift until Dean is supporting Castiel’s weight, starting to shuffle them towards the car. The sound of Sam gathering the wings with their bloody stumps gets lost in the breeze rustling through the tall grass. Once they’re in the car, Castiel on a bed of feathers and hollow bones in the backseat, Dean behind the wheel and Sam passenger, they all let out a collective breath.
“‘Good as it’ll ever be’ is the best we’ve got on a good day,” Dean says, trying to inject some humor into his voice. “Who are we if we don’t fake it til’ we make it?”
Dean is already seated at the table, chained. He looks up when Castiel enters, a saucy grin on his features, his freckles brighter than ever. It doesn’t hurt to look at him, but Castiel’s eyes do sting a little, a sensation he can blink away.
