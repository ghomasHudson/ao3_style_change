“Auch! Green isn't good in Rogers either” Rhodey voice made him spin and launch himself to his best friend who was now accustomed to the hugs and openly public displays of love from him that didn't bat and eye to his clinging tendencies, after all it has been three months since he has seen him
Morning came and they still were in the mission camp, it was taking too long, and they were already behind schedule, he sighed when he saw Stark talking with the older nun, sister Grace.
“Natasha, its fine, come on; can you walk?” he asked, she nodded and Tony and him pulled her up “stay here” he said to Tony who nodded and lower down, he moved ahead
“On sight” Nat said over the com, he gave the signal and Zippo guy fell with a bullet on his forehead, the others fell too, leaving the woman stunned and the man to run towards her and embrace her, they moved in unit, Buck at his back moved swiftly ready to strike long range, Bruce stayed at his left, gun up and focused anger in his eyes.
They managed to advance just a few miles shy of the border, they were so close but they stopped at Nat’s order to hold, the sky was cloudy making them take a respite from the blazing heat, the smell of rain filled his senses and the crunch of footsteps made him turn to the source of the noise, Tony was at his side eyes wide in concern and lower lip between his teeth, the wild staccato of his hearth wasn't related to Nat’s hold signal, he prayed for everyone who was listening that the proximity of Tony's body to his never faded, that he could be by his side for the rest of his life; the man beside him has clearly stolen his hearth and sanity with it; the small intake of breath that his mouth did when brown eyes landed on his made him choke, he hold it for the sake of silence and not his embarrassment if Tony noticed he didn't pointed out, he gulped nervous when Tony got closer to him, chest pressing on his shoulder the heat and the thumb thumb of Tony's hearth making him lose himself in the warmth and just forget everything around him, for just those blissful seconds they were alone, just Tony and him, his mind conjured images of how he wanted that pressure, that heat and intimacy.
“It can only take 12 people, old, young anybody who can slow us down, we meet again in Kenya” he said to the two males but eyes fixed on Stark, he nodded
“she likes it, it’s a done deal, now I need to communicate it to the wife” Clint stated for Stark’s benefit, Stark stopped and gave the toddler to Clint, who held her confused, then Stark opened his bag and pulled the latest model of SI phone, then traded the phone for the toddler with a smile, Clint looked at the phone, then at Stark and then at him, mouth open and eyes wide in shock.
“Is that right?” Sam asked the glint in his dark eyes indicated trouble, he smiled in thanks when he handed him a beer
“Captain” Stark said tone carefully neutral, he looked at him on guard of what came next “we need to stop” Stark requested, but he kept helping people along “captain” Stark tone changed to impatient
“Get those weapons out of my operating room, you’re frightening my staff, I’ll be with you when I’m done, now please, wait outside” Stark said, his whiskey colored eyes bright and flaming with controlled anger, the mask didn’t let him see the lower half of his face, but if he was honest his eyes told him everything he needed which left him out of sorts, Stark wasn’t leaping to leave this place at the mere mention of it.
“Hey, so where is the birthday girl?” He asked when they pulled apart, Peter and Kamala had already went to the food and the other kids, even if Peter was 14 now he wasn't going to say no to free pizza and ice cream, he sighed.
“It's good to see you my friend Anthony” Thor voice boomed in the room, he smiled and waved at the gentle giant, Jane waved and smiled too.
“Give me the phone!” Came Tony's yell a few yards ahead of him, he sighed and felt like a heavy weight was lifted, Tony was ok, Sam ran towards him and gave him the phone, Stark began to ran and fiddle with it, he ran behind them; he noticed Natasha and Thor not far from them, Scott and Bruce a few yards ahead but Clint and Buck no where to be seen.
“The man was thanking you Steve, the answer to that is your welcome, not the bullshit you spit at his face” Buck reproached him
He was nervous, the Langs had invited him to Cassie’s birthday party and he had bought her a Barbie set with a house and a convertible, the lady in the store said it was what every 7 year old would want, Kamala was smiling at him from Peter’s arms, the toddler was infatuated with her big brother, the Parkers were more than happy to let Peter babysit and stay with him for the summer break, he smiled and knocked in the door, a few seconds later the door open revealing Clint with a baby boy in his arms, the smile was blinding and made him lose some nerves.
“you’ll be fine, Kamala, go with Shuri, I'll see you there ok, baby” he said with a watery smile, he fought the impulse to go and comfort the man
“welcome back” Fury said cutting the voice of the reporter, his team had been helping evacuate the embassies in Wakanda and they were just finishiing eating after their last mission, Bucky and Sam had power on the TV, the world only spoke of what was happening in Wakanda, the fight for control over the supposedly mines of vibranium in the country was on the roof, he was so damn tired of this civil war and evacuating insolent people “gentlemen, Romanoff; we do appreciate you’ve been hopping out there, but we’re going to put you back in, priority tasking, we need to extract a critical personality ASAP, so finish your chow, refit for 3 day LRRP, se you in debrief room”  they all nodded
“You know very well, they won’t” Stark snapped, making him clench his fist and swallow the anger that wanted to come out
“I got you!” Thor said, voice loud, he turn quickly to see, Thor holding Stark to his chest hands on his back and hip, the child firmly in Starks arms, they separated quickly and Stark smiled embarrassed a tint of pink on his cheeks.
“You know, if you had Stark’s trust this will be easier right?” Buck said next to him, he glared at his best friend
“Thank you” she said in accented english, making Stark and Bucky smile, Buck nodded and they kept walking.
They continued the walk to the pick up zone he calculated than by mid day they will be there or at least close enough, he sighed and enjoyed the soft breeze the early morning brought, because as soon the sun rises the heat will be overwhelming, so they tried to advance as fast as they could, by mid day they were quite close, but the heat was suffocating, so they stopped to rest in the shade for a bit.
“yes, sir” was the answer he received, T’Challa let M’Baku on the ground and began to stand up, but was quick to hunch again when shots began to rain on them, the startled yelp Tony let out made him turn in fear, but Bucky was the one to force Tony down, that was what made him yelp
“You know what I’m talking about” Buck said, walking beside him, he glared at his friend “you know as well as I do that when we left that mission, those people were dead, then we take 28 men, women and children and we hump for a day” he continued, he looked away from his silver blue eyes and looked ahead, Tony was the first thing his eyes caught up on, he was talking to the man that embraced him when they returned, eyes bright and smile soft, there was a flare of something inside him, something akin to rage but not quite “we took them to the pickup zone and we leaved them behind to die like the others” Buck voice made him turn to look at him, there wasn’t anything akin to reproach of anger, it was more detached, bland up facts about what they did earlier in the morning yet it stung and made him recoil
“Fuck I didn’t saw it coming you know, I didn’t felt it at first and then…” Scott trailed, he nodded
“Widow take us to Kenya at first light, we still have a tail” he ignored Bruce’s teasing comment and talked to Nat on his com.
“Hurry up, doc” he said and followed the younger man, Stark waited for him outside, his clothes were well worn but clean, the boots were sturdy, military approved, his hair was a bit on the long side curling on his nape and forehead, the styled goatee gave him a flare of elegance and glamour, but he didn’t look like the rich kid in the magazines, he looked like a man, a hard working one at that, his sharp eyes found his and he felt like he could read everything about him just with that gaze
“I was promised no harm will come to her” she said crying, he put his hand on her wound and pressed, making her scream in pain, he could see Tony in the corner of his eye
“Tony, we are going to rest for 30 minutes” Scott said when Stark passed him, he nodded and turn to look at him eyes wide and confusion evident in them but nodded in gratefulness, the people sat and tried to stay quiet, Stark didn't stop to sit and recharge like he expected instead he fret over everyone else even his team offering water, food or medical care, Kamala on his arms, when Stark was sure everybody was settled he walked away and sat with Kamala, two males and a teenager girl approached him and sat next to him, Stark handed Kamala at request of the younger male, Stark rummaged his bag and pulled a syringe a wad of cotton and the little bottle with medicine for Kamala, he watched him intently, how his movements were precise, controlled, he cleaned the area of the injection and then he pricked the toddler, instantly the child began to cry, the younger male holding the child stared at Tony with familiarity and with a small smile, he frowned and then the girl held Stark wrist and smiled, the small contact vanished when the older male bumped his knee with the younger one, they didn't look up but soon Stark stood and held Kamala in his arms to settle her, but she kept crying, Buck was soon next to him and his eyes searched for his, there was something akin to reproach and surprise in the steel blues when they locked on his, he arched an eyebrow at his second in command, which Buck ignored and looked at the scene he was previously watching.
“Sweetheart, come on!” He yelled and pulled him towards him, his finger found a pulse, making him sigh in relief “come on, T’Challa get ready to run, come on help get him up come on” he yelled T’Challa nodded and helped him get Tony up for him to carry the unconscious man over his shoulder, Sam was next to T’Challa.
“it’s ok, they’re gone” he said, Stark nodded and stood and soon everyone else, he stepped out of the leaves that were hiding them, Kamala in his arms and soundly asleep now, Stark smiled at the toddler and rearrange the child in his arms for her to be more comfortable, he turned away from the scene to look ahead to their path.
“Do you know if anybody knew about us or could be following our trail?” he asked anger on the surface
“The people of Wakanda are strong, they won't give up and will continue forward there is no doubt about it” the young handsome male that was next to M’Baku affirmed, his dark eyes flared with ferocity and determination at his spoken words his shoulders pulled back and chin up high, regal and intimidating the man looked.
“Thank you for taking care of my arm” he whispered inches away from his lips, his eyes focused on pink lips, the pull was so strong, God how he wanted to just lean closer and take those lips in his
“The president just signed the rights of this mission to Colonel Rhodes and Agent Phil Coulson, you are out of this mission and that chair, so I advice you to vacate the position and premises, this fine gentleman will escort you to your quarters where you'll stay until the Security Council revise your case and decide what to do with you” Pepper said with rapid efficiency and fire behind that pleased smile, god Tony better buy her the damn moon if that was what it took to truly please her, he shivered at the thought of Pepper truly pissed at someone, they had been receiving hourly updates of Tony’s position and convoy but there has been a delay of 6 hours now and he was getting worried and by the small tremble of Peppers delicate hands she was too, Jarvis was quick to determinate the advance of the convoy but that was just wild conjectures; not that he doubts Jarvis for a second but 6 hours and HYDRA’s army on their heels was to much for him to be comfortable, Fury stood and left the control room, two armed navy seals followed him, he sighed and looked at Pepper.
“you knew about this?” he asked “you knew all the time and you didn’t tell me” he accused him, Tony let out a whimper and looked at the ground “you knew and put my team in danger because of this, you didn’t care did you? Those choppers you demanded were just for his safety aren’t they?” he asked more agitated by the second, there was no answer from Stark “did you even care that Hydra may kill us all? That American soldiers are helping the rightful king of this forsaken country! Do you have any idea of what politic disaster this may cause?” he yelled pushing Tony with every question, he let him, Tony let him push him around, there was no fight in his body and when he lifted his eyes to look at his blues, there was only pain and sorrow.
“They’ll be fine; keep moving” he ordered Stark turned to see behind him, he didn’t have that luxury “come on, hurry up! You’ve got to move faster!”
The chat was idle and light, he looked at the men and women that waved themselves in his life, Bruce and Betty who shared his excitement in medicine and engineering, Clint and Laura who were grateful to him for some reason he couldn't understand and their kids who were so cute and definitely took after Laura, of Wilson and Barnes who were like the big brothers he wished he never met now and longed to have as a kid, of Thor and Jane with their wit and perfect manners; of Nat and Valkyrie and their scary ways but who he loved non the less; of his platypus and Carol who loved each other so fiercely and loved him too, of Happy and Pepper and the Langs who made him part of their families; and Steve who smiled at him with a flicker of hunger and mischief; looked at him with those blazing blue eyes filled with love and happiness, he took his hand and smiled at the people gathered there, his friends, his family; mismatched, funky looking but loving and in that instant he knew he wouldn't let go for anything in the world.
So I mean terribly sorry I couldn't post yesterday, it was a bit chaotic but her is the new one so enjoy!!
“Tony, Tony! They have a huge bouncy castle can I take Kam, promise I will take care of her” Pete said with a wide grin, Kamala firmly in his embrace, he nodded “oh hi Steve! Mr. Lang this party is awesome!” The teen said, the quick smile and retreat made him sigh this kid was high on sugar and it hadn't even been 15 minutes since they arrived
“… under hostile enemy attack! Request immediate air support! Location one klick south of Tadjile Pass, come back” he caught Sam’s report, he looked at Clint, who had the grenade launcher
“Steve, what’s wrong?” Tony asked confused and concerned making him snap to the man who was still holding
“Because my orders are very clear, evacuate the priest, you and the two nuns, now please, get packed and get ready to move” he said tone filled with annoyance
“ok, Buck, plant the explosives, we’ll try to move as quick as we can” he said the others nodded and began the speed walk to the border to Kenya; there were keeping close to the stream, to their already planed route it had passed about an hour since the last explosion Buck shouldn't be far away from them now.
“watch her hands” Buck said to Bruce when he got closer, Sam was quick to search for arms “Fuck, what the hell is that?” Buck asked when Sam pulled a small looking radio
“Yeah, you can let her know she can call you on it, if the baby comes while were here” Stark said with a smile and began to walk away from the still stunned Clint, who now was looking at him, he nodded and followed Stark, Laura will appreciate the call and know his husband was ok
“come on Tony, we need to go” he said offering his hand to help him up, Tony took it hesitantly, that small waver made him feel even less that trash, but by the life of him he couldn't let go; he turn to look at the others who were busy following his orders.
“Non posso crederci, sto parlando a un cazzo di muro, mi succede per non ascoltare Rhodey e mandare Fury a fotterlo 1” Stark half yelled half growled storming away from him letting him stunned for a few seconds, the roll of the words made him stir something in his core and goosebumps flared in all his body “you’re right Captain” the change in Stark tone made him turn and look at him, his head held high and his shoulders thrown back, eyes gleaming with rage and confidence, it made him want to take a step back “is not your problem, it is my responsibility, and I will not leave without my people!” he stated voice cold, terse it made him recoil internally by the strength behind those words.
“intel tells me you are been chased by Hydra and moving with one prince T’Challa Udaku son of the late king T’Chaka” he said voice eerily calm and collected, he frowned at it, he knew, Fury knew! Since the fucking beginning and Tony though he had told them, which is why he denied to the evac since the fucking beginning for fucks sake he was going to kill the man!, Coulson had called worried about them being followed he hadn't known either what the fuck is Fury playing? “the company is excess cargo, your judgement has put the lives of your men and Stark at risk, I strongly advise you to complete the evacuation as planned” Fury stated tone detached almost to bland, he growled in frustration.
“Go hold position, now” he ordered and glared at the two men, they sighed and walked away, they rest for an hour more and began to walk to the pickup zone, Kamala was yet again in Stark’s arms, the child still asleep, while Stark talked in rapid Wakandan with the two males from before and the girl, who smiled and talked back…
“I am one of many that give him information” she said, he turned to see Tony now holding for dear life to Buck’s arms, Bucky hold him to his body, giving comfort and support, then he noticed the blood on Tony's hands.
“ok, Widow, hold we’ll rest for the night” he said, making Tony smile and squeeze his hand in thanks, he nodded “go on, go rest” he said to the doctor, who kept smiling at him
“please, please; there’s no need for this” he said but he didn’t lower the gun and when the barrel of the gun was still pointed at the man, Tony moved the man away and put himself just in front of the gun, the barrel firmly on his forehead, he looked at Tony in pure shock, his whiskey eyes held his, the walls were completely down
“He is sure” he growled in frustration, Stark glared at him but relented and let Bruce help stitch the man up, he walked towards him and towards the exit removing the clinic robe, the latex gloves and the mask, he was shorter and lean, olive skin and if he let himself look a beautiful ass
“that’s right, 60 seconds, I suggest you use that time to find the priest” he said, he stared at him and his whiskey colored eyes held his blues searching for something, then he nodded and ran to the church.
“What is it, is he not there?” the concern was clearly there unmasked and unapologetic, he frowned at the emotions, why Fury was so personally invested in this?
“roger” he pulled the grenade and throw it at the location Clint instructed and as soon the boom echoed in the rain forest chaos erupted, they advanced shooting whatever that moved and Hydra did too, the explosion behind them making it clear they had heavy fire with them, his team remained impassive and headed on, then the fire stopped, he sighed but waited for movement
“Celebrating so soon? So American of you” The voice of a man above them assault rifle pointed at them, made them all still; they were out of amo, they were sitting ducks right now, they all turned to look at the man, he was tall and jacked; black hair and half his face scarred, no it was burned, Rumlow he must be, the rage he felt in that instant was incomprehensible, for what he could see he must be over 40 almost 50, so when he tried to rape Tony he must have been 30 something 40 maybe, damn he was going to kill this guy.
“I can’t do that; I’d risk the safety of all these people here” he said, Stark eyes widen and then narrowed in anger, he looked away from his accusing eyes “Besides, they may bypass the mission” he said nonchalantly refusing eye contact
“Cap” Sam said, he turn to look at him and just saw Buck run towards them a smirk clear on his face.
“Stay here” he said and moved to Nat’s position just to see rebels destroying a small village “Ant-man, bring me Stark” he said in the com, and moved away from the view, he grabbed Stark hand who looked at him with concern “we’re going to rest here, stay down in these trees, listen to my men, ok?” he asked the man, Stark nodded and looked at him with determination “go” he said letting go of the warm hand, he looked at Scott and nodded “Winter, Falcon, with me” he said in the com and moved again to Nat’s and Thor position, Buck and Sam were quick to catch up “What you got?” he asked when he was between Natasha and Thor.
“Like it? Nah she is going to go bananas for it, Hope it’s gonna flip” Scott said, groaning when Tony put the tape on the gauze to held it there
“Drop the gun Rumlow” Phil said, looking that he was clearly outnumbered he let the gun drop, Sharon was quick to hold him down and take any guns he had stashed.
“Go on, now Winter” he ordered, making eye contact, he held it for a few seconds, steel blue eyes studied his in an eerie empty stare and then followed the order, walking away from them and hurry Stark, he held the sigh and stilled himself
“Stand down Tony, I’ll cover fire for winter, on my mark!” he yelled to Tony who was inches away from Bucky, Bucky nodded and got ready to run, he turned and situated his gun ready to fire “now!” he yelled, Buck was ready, he ran and they shot what ever it moved, Buck planted the bomb and ran back Thor handed the other to him
“everybody up, now!” he growled, the anger was boiling in him, he could understand the why in following Tony, he’s rich, SI will pay a hefty ransom for the man, hell he bets his next check that SHIELD and the US government would too, but this Black Panther, he must be connected to the Panther tribe, someone powerful enough to receive this kind of attention, he looked at the people and focused on the two males that Tony pointed.
“he does now” Pepper said halting his movements, Fury glared, Coulson sighed in relief he smirked and Hill smiled at Pepper.
“Fuck!” he growled, he squatted next to the woman and gave Buck the transmitter, Buck moved a few steps from the scene and gave them his back, he turned the now incapacitated woman making her groan in pain
The noise of something close made him snap awake, confusion and grogginess making him slow to notice Scott a few steps away from him, he stilled and made his brain reboot and focus, his hand unclenched from the knife on his thigh and his eyes found Scott's.
“Tony, come on, wake up, please wake up” the sound of groans and pain filled screams meant shit to him at that moment he wanted to see those brown eyes again, he wanted to look at them and stare for as long as he lived “come on Tony please, wake up, Tony please!” he begged desperately, then a frown appeared in his slack face, he grinned Tony was waking up, he was going to be ok; the gasp of pain Tony let loose made his hearth flutter in concern and relief at the same time, he was alive he’ll live were his thoughts; the barely there flutter of eyelashes made him grin, Tony’s trembling hand moved to touch his own head, when fingertips touched what it appeared to be a bump he winced and blood run down his nose, he moved his hand to wipe it off and then Tony opened his eyes fully, glazed and un focused but alive.
“Pickup zone, send coordinates” Fury snapped and hang up, he sighed and looked at the man that was still talking on the phone, Tony smiled at him brightly.
“Copy, let it rain Colonel, danger close” he said holding on to Sam, the others pulled close and took cover
“If you hold him on even more tightly the good doctor will be crushed” Bucky said behind them, Steve went to let go in embarrassment but he held tightly to his boyfriend frame
“Dr Stark, I’m Captain Steve Rogers with SHIELD, we’re here to take you and your people out of here” he said making Stark turn and look at him
“god damn it, I got hit, sniper” Nat hiss made him sag in relief, Thor and Scott moved to retrieve her, while Sam and Bucky took care of the sniper, Tony moved with him and so did Bruce, they got to Nat’s position her hand held her right shoulder, Tony was quicker than Bruce at looking and tending Nat’s injury he pulled a pristine white bandage and a bottle of antiseptic, he poured the liquid on the wound making Nat choke a scream of pain, then Tony bandaged her shoulder
“Copy” he said and moved, two men were carrying another to throw it at the pile, he threw the shield the edge landing in one man and then bouncing to hit the other, Buck shot them and just like that the team was moving, precise movements and secured aim, the soldier began to drop like flies, he focused on the soldiers, there were 2 rebels gaming upon a teenager, he shot at one and the other drop too Bruce gun smoking slightly, they walked behind a house, one soldier holding down a woman, while the other two stabbed a man, Bruce shot one, and he threw the shield to the other two, Buck finished them for him, they kept going methodically towards the village, the other teams going at it too; they rounded up a small cottage, screams filled his ears, Bruce tapped his left shoulder and continued, stopping by the entrance, his jaw clenched and the his eyes darkened, two fingers and the signal to go, he shot the standing soldier and Buck pulled away his gun and picked up the man raping a young woman, she was no more than 16, arm circling the neck and knife going to the groin, the man let out a grunt of surprise, Buck kept the knife firmly on the man’s groin and with a swift movement of the wrist cut it, hand firmly clamped over his mouth muffled the scream of pain, then with just a movement of the shoulder the man’s neck snapped; she cried and held her torn clothes to her body, blood on her tights and the ground, she crawled away from them, terror and anguish on her eyes.
“I can’t leave them, this people deserve being in a safe place and be reunited with their families, the ones we took to safety” Thor noted, he nodded
“If we go any slower, we're going to start going backwards in time” he said with a sigh “winter what you got back there?” He asked by com
“Is this impatience has anything to do with SI contract over SHIELD’s?” he asked making Tony stop and look at him in surprise, the silence that followed was answer enough “we’re taking these people to the Bravo pickup zone, need 3 helicopters to take them out” he demanded his captain voice leaving no room for arguments.
“Captain, his father was more than just the king of Wakanda, he was the tribe chief, that makes him the heir to the Panther Nation, it makes him the Black Panther, it’s a bloodline they must cut, the north border tribe will comb heaven and earth to find him, if he lives the government of N’Jadaka is nothing more than a rouse, he wont have the support of the other tribes if someone of the Panther tribe is alive” he said, he took a deep breath and turn to look at Tony, who was looking at him in fear.
“The doctor wouldn’t leave without his people, sir” he explained calm and innocently, which made Sam and now Buck deny with tiny smirks on their lips.
“Tony, and nope, but I have a godson Peter, who I spoil rotten dose that count?” he asked with a smile, Clint smirked but denied “you have kids?” Stark asked
“His father Howard Stark was the co-founder of SHIELD along with Agent Carter who is his godmother, Stark Industries is one of our major contributors, Stark’s signature is in your paychecks, there for we are his private extract team” Fury explained, there was no more to say to that does it? Clearly Stark was important and the mission was a must; the scoff of Clint and Scott was loud in the room making the others smirk.
“who knows what this is?” he said showing the transmitter “I took this off Kalá’s dead body, Doctor Stark good friend” he snapped and looked at Tony, he recoiled away from his words but held his stare eyes still glazed with tears then he saw his arms, peeled skin, on forearms and elbows, blood and dirt on them; he did that didn't he? when he pushed him; but he barreled on
“Why’d you turn that bird aroun’, the mission was clearly accomplished and over?” he asked making him frown because wasn’t he there listening to what Stark had said or felt, how Fury just blindsided them, lied to them even and they just let him. They follow orders right? complete the mission at the end of the day that was what they were mindless soldiers following orders without a single question asked; his hands were in tight fists anger boiling in his veins “was it because of what Stark said or what Fury didn’t?” he asked making him stop, the anger vanished making him shiver in cold “talk with me, Stevie, I’m with you either way, til’ the end of the line, you know that” Buck assured him, making him sag in relief and let loose the breath he didn't knew he was holding, looking at the steel blue eyes of his best friend he nodded in thanks; he knew his team wouldn't go against him, that they trusted him yet it was good to hear it once in a while.
“Doctor Stark, come with me” he said pulling the man to his chest, his whiskey eyes widen when he found himself so close to him “there's danger on the trail” Starks eyes narrowed and started to look around them “listen!” He snapped, making Stark to look at him in shock “I need you to do whatever you can to make that baby quiet, do you understand me, whatever it takes” he half whispered half growled, Stark held his eyes “Stark, now” he snapped, he nodded and held Kamala closer, his hand going to her mouth silencing her, he kneeled and held her close, they made the others move from the trail and keep quiet, his team already moving to protect them, the tension while they waited the rebels to pass them was tick and filled with energy, he could see Kamala fussing in Stark’s arms, but he held her securely and didn't let a sound pass through his hand
The party was a success, the kids were asleep or verily holding on awake, Scott and Clint were looking after them when they came to the yard when we were, cold beers on their hands and knowing smiles
“Two hours and a half off the rendezvous with the bird, they can only bring what they can carry on their backs” he said turning to look at the people forming a line ready to go
“Tony!” He yelled the sting of a bullet on his shoulder made him tumble over Tony's body, T’Challa crawled towards him.
“We’re already engaged” he said, she nodded “hand me the binoculars” he asked Thor, he complied “Hawkeye, you got zippo?” he asked
They arrived to the pickup zone in the morning, sun verily up and heat blasting, but they were going home finally
“Keep the packages safe and take them to Kenya” he confirmed making the others smile and comply with the new mission, he sighed and looked at Stark who was talking with the others, it took 10 minutes to put 7 children, 2 wounded and elderly and a very reluctant teenager on the helicopter, in her arms Kamala was crying and stretching her arms for Stark
“Star one, this is Iron Patriot, star one respond” he said in the com and waited for a response, there was non “star one, this iron patriot, please respond” he asked again silence his gut churned “come on, comes on; star one this iron patriot please respond” he said to be met with silence, he was getting closer to the last point he could see smoke “come on god damn it, star one this is iron patriot, respond”
“for all the years that we’ve been told to stand down and stand by, to just follow orders and the plan of someone above us; we’re doing the right thing, Stevie”
“They are so much more than Fury or even us though about them don't you agree?” Thor asked, he nodded “their grief and sorrows won't deteriorate their spirit, instead it’ll bring forward their courage and kindness, they are true warriors” Thor said awe and reverence in his tone.
“stop, stop!” Tony yelled fighting Bucky’s hold on him, but then Bucky showed him the small transmitter making Tony still he pressed harder on the woman shoulder
; I will not leave without the indigenous personal” the anger in Stark voice made him stop completely and look at the man in front of him, truly look at him, the presence he exuded was equal if not even more dangerous than Fury, and it wasn’t false bravado either it came from true strength and hardship, what this pretty kid know about hardships, of hard work, of saving lives of responsibility?, he’s just a clueless rich kid playing with daddy’s money he clenched his fist and growled his next words in the kids face.
“Yeah, already requested that week” Scott said with a big smile “she likes ugly plush toys, I already bought her this truly ugly bunny I found and my wife is throwing her a big party” Stark nodded with an amused smile
“He is so damn cute Barton, he must take after the ms Barton, no?” He joked making the marksman show his tongue, he smiled at the man, then strong arms surrounded his shoulders in a back hug, the clean smell of forest and sea salt made him smile and relax in the embrace
Pepper’s call made his temper flare at the stupidity of Fury, denied evac and air support, what the fuck was he thinking? Apparently according to Pepper Tony was ok, still with the avengers team, and walking to the Kenyan border, but by the last call they got from the team, they had been followed by Hydra soldiers lead by Rumlow no less, death was to quick for that fucker, he needs to suffer slowly agonizing and begging for his demise.
“Doesn’t matter, is a mission, so hurry and lets go, the sooner we go the sooner will be back” he said standing up and going to get prepared for the debrief he heard some groans in his way out but he paid no mind, at the end they were going to follow orders if it was important for them to go, they’ll go. He and his team has being waiting in the debrief room for at least 10 minutes when Fury finally arrived with Hill and Coulson.
“Tony, tell your people to pack their things, we’re leaving” Buck said to Tony who nodded and kept his eyes to the ground, the people moved and they returned their arms, he saw how T’Challa held Tony’s hand just for Tony to pull away.
“Zippo first, red team right flank, this way, edge of the clearing, wait for my go; silent and quick” he signaled Nat, Thor nodded at the command ready for what was coming next “gold team on me” he ordered Buck and Bruce nodded “Blue team left side” Sam and Scott nodded and moved “Hawkeye, eyes on the package” he said and moved to his position
“it's to dangerous to send air support!” Fury snapped, he was not impressed with the man, now he got why Tony send the man to fuck off, he glared.
“what?” Busk snapped cutting him up his eyes glowing; for a moment he had to still his body from taking a step back and cower at the clear anger his best friend was showing.
“I'll call, be in contact with Phil, I'm sure we can help even more T’Challa” Tony said with a smile, he nodded, Tony got up on the helicopter with Kamala on his arms still, Tony sat next to him while Phil and Buck sat in front of them; he smiled at the little girl clinging to Tony, the girl smiled at him too.
“God had already leaved this lands” Thor said, making Buck and him nod, they walked away and he kept close to Stark, the bag the man carried was medium size a bit boxy and by the red marks he had on his neck and shoulder heavy, Wakanda was heavy on rain and heat making them sweat a lot and stay dry was a miracle on its own, but there was no complain from the doctor, he didn’t groaned or made faces as they kept walking, he noticed that Bruce and him talked, Stark with rushed words and quick gestures of his hands while Bruce smiled, nodded and replied in kind, he frown Bruce was hard to befriend he was quiet, reserved and claimed he wasn’t a people person, but apparently Stark was the exception to that rule, the others noted too; a woman holding a small girl no more than 5 years old and with a big bag on her other arm was struggling to continue, Stark noticed too, he changed his bag to his back and held the sleeping toddler in one arm and with his free hand helped the woman carry the bag, she smiled softly and kept walking, he followed them in silence, Stark talked in wakandan fluidly and sang with the kids, fretting over the wounded and sick while they walked, his team saw how invested Stark was with this people, he cared for them and in return they cared for him, at every smile and kind touch Stark shared  with this people was returned in favor, the knot in his stomach tighten even more, but a mission was a mission and he was hell vent in accomplish it
“Get down came the yell from Scott, he was to slow to comply, a bullet logged in his leg and made him fall, Tony fell first back painfully landing on the ground, he landed next to him, there was a wheeze a grunt and then a deep breath, Tony was awake, blood ran from his nose and ears, the gash on his temple caked with blood and dirt, his chest bloody from the shards, the adrenaline didn't let him feel the pain on his leg but he knew that he needed to do something about it he was quick to turn and cut a strip of cloth to form a tourniquet around his tight T’Challa, was quick to help him too, he heard Tony throwing up next to him, but then his hands were on him and pulling the knot of the tourniquet
“We were in a hospital, I was helping a woman give birth when Hydra came in, Nakia and Limbani” he began but stopped dressing his wound, eyes watery and his voice wavered “they, uhm; there were too many Hydra soldiers and the rebels began to shot everything that moved, they tried to stop them to protect me and the woman I was helping but they couldn’t, Hydra killed them, they were dear friends of mine”
“And there will be helicopters for them too?” Stark asked because of course he would, because he needed the reassurance of it; he needs his word on it, he gulped the vile that wanted to get out of his mouth
“let me see, come on Lang let me see” Tony said pulling away Scott hands, Bruce was soon next to him, helping move the gear out of his stomach, blood was quick to cover both of his hands
“Motherfucker!” Sam growled anger flaring on his dark eyes, the muffled sound of a baby made Buck move to the left “look at your work, you piece of shit” Sam moved the man and made him stare at the trembling girl, then with a practiced move he stabbed the man in the stomach, Sam stabbed the man again and left him to die on the ground.
“stop it!” Tony yelled making him still but he didn’t dare turn to look at the man, Buck stopped him
“You know I…” Stark began but stopped and sighed, he turn to look at the man and Stark look up at him, the vulnerability he wanted to see before was there now, his eyes pools of sentiments laid bare for him to see, he stilled at the knowledge that Stark was beginning to open up to him, his gut clench with guilt “thank you, for saving my life” he said tone warm and open, he denied
“Star one, to command, star one to command” Sam voice made him take a deep breath and finally turn to see his second in command Buck arched an eyebrow at him but said nothing, he turn to Sam and he gave them the satellite phone
“oku akusiyo inzuzo yinto ekukubonayo kamva2” Stark said making the girl nod again, he brushed his fingertips to her cheek and then Kamala “Wakanda ngonaphakade3” Stark finished making the girl hold herself differently, elegance, power and intelligence behind her dark eyes.
“Cap, straggler, straggler danger close” Nat’s voice made him turn to see Stark that looked up just to stop dead when the soldier spot him, the rebel pointed the gun at Stark, Stark moved to protect Kamala, his eyes firmly on the man, but he moved quickly and swiftly behind the soldier, hand on his mouth and the other quick to cut his throat, Stark’s eyes on his blues, and it was like time suddenly stopped and for a brief second he saw what he believed was the true Anthony Stark, there was fear and concern but it wasn’t for his own life it was for the others, for the child in his arms and for the people he was responsible off, and his team, Stark was conscious enough of him putting them in danger because he didn’t want to leave his people; he flinched away from the clear vulnerability reflected on those whiskey pools, how can Stark put so much blame and guilt on to his own person, how can he inflict himself with all that?; he put the rebel on the ground cutting the eye contact, but he still could feel his eyes on him, he stood and cleaned the knife on his pant leg, Stark still looking at him, he looked up to make eye contact once again but the moment was gone, Stark held his gaze but it was different this time, it was guarded, hid behind a layer of self confidence and poise, and he just hated it, he wished to see those eyes unguarded showing joy and happiness instead.
“You lied to me!” he yelled pushing him the words were blades on his skin the desperation and hurt on his eyes salt on the wounds “you lied to me!” he screamed anguish and terror in his voice, eyes tearing up, his fist connected to his jaw making him stumble a few steps, he growled “you fucker!” Stark screamed in anger “I won’t go without them!” he yelled trying to run pass him, he caught him and manhandle him, he pick him up, while Stark kept yelling bloody murder at him, the screams for dr. Tony filled his ears and the wrecked yell that Stark let out broke something in him “They are going to die!” Stark yelled, he put him in the chopper
“your report was incorrect, they were not executed, they murdered my mother along with my aunt and two baby cousins; out of greed, my father fight for democracy, for his people, my people” he said tears fallen freely “when my father died, and when it first appeared there might be trouble, my mother sent me away with my sister Shuri and this man” he said turning to point to M’Baku “Col. M’Baku” he said
“Captain, you want to tell me why the hell that bird was full of unwanted and unauthorized cargo and not your critical?” Fury’s voice exploded over the phone, he turn to look at Sam and mouthed Fury’s pissed, Sam shrugged and rolled his eyes, he smirked.
“strip those packs down to rolling gear only” he said, have the refugees drop anything that don’t go boom, lets move” he ordered, they nodded and began to move, Tony waited for him
“Give me a break Rogers, I send you to this mission because I knew you wouldn’t screw it up and now you’re telling me is difficult to understand?” The I send you because you are good soldier who follows orders was heavily implied making him clench his jaw and repress the growl that wanted to come out at Fury’s words.
“Valkire and Danvers, get ready we leave in 10” he said to the two fierce women, they nodded and ran to their post, their teams at their heels, he speed walked to his own team and began the prep, they were in the air in minutes, three helos behind them.
“He was on the bird, it’s —difficult to explain” he snapped annoyed, making Tony turn around and frown at him, he excused himself from M’Baku and the male and walked towards him, concern in his whiskey eyes.
“Valkyrie, Marvel, ready to engage, white smoke hostile 20 yards” the order came through the phone, then he heard the planes and saw them.
They had to run, to the border there was no way they could hold them off, they were outnumbered, outgunned and they had to loose way more than the other side; they still had no answer from base and it was making him anxious, he has lost sight of Tony and that is making him distracted the graze of a bullet on his shoulder is proof of it, his team often reported of their status, the people they had been protecting was diminishing quickly but they kept retreating to the border, gun fire heavy on their backs, Bucky and Clint hadn't responded to their coms.
“черт возьми 1, it was only a panther, I swear if I stop for another one I’m going to kill it, sacred or not” came Nat’s rant on the com, he sighed “I’m gonna cross over” Nat informed them, but the loud sound of a gun been shot made him flinch, then Nat went down, the stillness of Tony by his side made him froze as well.
“Lets go” he demanded to Stark, his eyes held surprise “let’s go Doctor” Stark walked away from him disappointment evident in his eyes
“Watch your step Tony” Bruce said when we crossed a stream, she slippery rocks and uneven ground made it difficult to find balance, he turn to look at the advance they have and frowned.
They moved toward the man holding his shoulder Sam quick to hold and incapacitate, but what he saw made him sick, the young girl no more than 20, was naked and covered in blood, her breast cut off, her thighs covered in blood too, Sam growled in anger and manhandled the piece of shit that called himself a man.
“They are not my responsibility, you are my responsibility Dr. Stark” he explained annoyance and anger in his tone
“let her bleed out” he snapped, Buck returned him the transmitter and he walked away, Tony walked shakily to her, Buck stayed with him and he stopped to listen
They found a resting place when the sun went down making way to the stars and the moon, the heat diminished but it was till hot and humid, his tack gear felt like a heavy skin and he longed for a shower and a cold beer, but he put that aside and focused on the people they were protecting; tiredness in their frames but resolution in their eyes, warriors.
There was still the lingering felling of hurt and betrayal in his being, but the team was right he screwed it big time, he sighed again and cursed his temper.
“Rumlow and Tony have history, the later kidnapped Tony for weapons, Tony refused of course, after weeks of torture and rape treats he escaped with a flamethrower, Rumlow was lucky to get there out alive, his face was half burned, so of course Rumlow wants revenge and weapons now that they might have vibranium” he explained Coulson was ready to murder someone and Hill was trying no to show it; Jarvis wasn't that far off from his calculations and now with the new report of the team they had a set location; he looked at Hill and then at Coulson.
“that will be me” the man Tony pulled away said next to Tony “my name is T’Challa Udaku son of T’Chaka, heir of the throne of Wakanda” he said, he looked at Tony who held his eyes, but there was pain and regret in those whiskey eyes “please don’t blame him, please” T’Challa pleaded, he couldn’t stop staring at Tony, tears glazed whiskey eyes that still held his cold blue, he felt betrayed, used “I’m sorry to have misled you, but there are enemies looking for me everywhere, and that is why you’re being pursued” T’Challa explained, he looked at T’Challa he no longer wanted to see Stark.
“You should have some rest, Steve” Tony said and pulled his hand away but he grabbed it and pulled him in, whiskey eyes glowed with something he couldn't pinpoint but quickly demeaned at his next words
“Cover!” He yelled over the gun fire and the explosions came soon after, the loud noise made his ears ring, dirt and smoke made him hard to breathe, the heat from the explosions making his skin get goosebumps what felt like hours to him were just seconds then the drumming of the helicopters made him turn to look up, he couldn't stop the smile that graced his lips, Clint let out a bark of laughter and Scott a woop of joy.
Natasha and Thor firing from an upper position Bruce and Scott from the sides and Buck and Clint firing from the back, as plans go it was a good one but their amo was getting lower by the second, they needed back up right about now, he ran with Tony on his shoulder and Sam trying to get through the call for back up.
“Can’t you sleep, captain?” Stark asked with a little smile, squatting next to him, he didn’t spare him a glance.
“in my opinion, we cut our losses, this isn’t a fucking war, as far as me be in or out, you know the answer to that, besides Laura would have my balls if I failed this” Clint said, he nodded
“listen to me! God damn it listen to me!” he yelled, clasping his hand on the man shoulder, making T’Challa to flinch away but look at his eyes, dark teary eyes focused on his “this man is dead. If you don’t want his death to be meaningless, it’s time for you to become a fucking man and get your people to Kenya. Now stand up and be the man I know you are meant to be, come on T’Challa!” he yelled at the crying man, there were a few seconds when T’Challa didn’t move he just stood there, then the change was evident, there was another kind of resolution in the man eyes “do you understand me?” he asked tone harsh
“I came here with my mother when I was a child, she helped build a hospital in Ruanda, the royal family of Wakanda invited us to stay with them for a few days, I loved this country the moment I set foot on it, T’Chaka used to tell me stories about their ancestors and tribe; I used to play tag with the prince and princess; do math with their scientists, see the training of the Dora Milaje. SI began trading with them when my mother spoke with dad about Wakanda, I came as often as I could as I grew up; Ramonda, T’Chaka’s wife told me about the mission and what they were trying to achieve, a bigger school and an orphanage a well stocked hospital, I was immediately on board, Pepper agreed that me coming was a good idea, good press, but I didn’t do it for it you know, I just wanted to help, medics are far and between this far away from the city so I over stayed, the royal family was happy to have me, then T’Chaka died, I was already boarding my plane when it happened, but I stayed a few more days for the funeral and the prince coronation, then Fury pulled out the SHIELD team that was with me and the coup happened few days later, I fled as quickly as I could when Hydra soldiers advanced in the city, I couldn’t get to the airport it was overtaken; I tried to go to the embassy but it had been already evacuated so I managed to fled to the mission, I thought that if I was farther away from any mayor tribes and raids I would be safe” he said eyes fixed on his arm, he nodded.
“no, we would have tranq him and kidnapped him” Buck replied to Thor’s question before he could voice his thoughts on the matter, making Sam nod and sigh, he deflated and the anger he had vanish leaving him cold and shivering, the words he used and spat at Tony made him churn in shame and anger at himself.
“okay, Doctor Stark, turn two” he said walking to Tony who was kneeling giving water to a woman “Stark, get up” he said grabbing his arm and pulling him up “I need you to point out everybody that came to the mission in the last week, right now” he ordered there was no room for objection in his tone, Tony frowned concern but nodded, his eyes pools of understanding, he turn to look at the people that was being searched and put on a line.
“Yes, come with me, please” he said advancing towards the church “we have a 12 klick hike to run to get to the helicopter, put your things together and pack light” he said to Stark who listened at him with avid attention “Ant man keep your perimeter up, Hawkeye hold your position, Widow eyes on doc” he ordered to the team and so they mobilized “we saw rebels outside Yolhgo in our way in, must assume they will be here by nightfall if not sooner” he informed him
“That’s us” Sam affirmed, he turn to look at Buck who was behind him next to Stark, who had his eyes on him, the knot in his gut tighten at was going to follow next, he sighed and turn to look at the helicopters
“Ok, let’s begin” Fury said, the lights went down and the large screen lit up, showing a map of Wakanda “now, intel estimates that Hydra has at least 5 thousand soldiers divided in the southwest sector of Wakanda, they taken to government armories and unfortunately they have been supplied far too well over the years, in addition the rebels are killing whoever that are not supporting the change in government” Fury said looking at every single one of them “all right, your prime objective is to find and extract Dr. Anthony Edward Stark with Stark Industries, Dr, Stark is the son of the late Howard and Maria Stark; he was there helping to construct a new orphanage and school in the area with the Maria Stark foundation, the second objective is two nuns and a priest who run the safe camp where this construction was taking place near the border if they so choose to leave, they are in St. Michael Mission Camp, here” the map zoomed in showing the small camp, just in the middle of the rain forest and the zone swimming in soldiers “you will halo over Kenya and float into your drop zone, near the edge of the Horr rain forest, when you get your package, you will proceed to your extract point” Fury explained the drop zone a few miles away from  the camp and the pick up a few clicks from the border  “our presence on the ground will be consider hostile, questions?” Fury asked.
His team moved and came to the last cottage a woman was screaming with pain, Sam was at the other side, and Buck in front of him, three men where kneeling and holding the woman still, while another was doing something to her, Sam shot one, Buck the other, one of them ran towards the back exit, where Nat’s gun went off, the man that was in front of the woman went to stand but Sam shot him on the shoulder.
“Does a rich kid even know how to use a shovel?” Clint asked making them laugh harder, they got ready and went in the plane, it had its complications but surely Stark was dying to leave the forest and go to back to air conditioning and a comfortable bed, hell he was sure he wanted to go back home and sleep at least 48 hours…
“Yeah, and Cassie gonna like it?” Tony asked pouring more of the antiseptic on the now sutured wound, Scott groaned in pain but let out a bark of laugher
“yeah, but were helping his people right?” Scott asked the affirmatives made his stomach clench; guilt was taking a toll on him.
“ok, here’s the deal” he began when the team was there next to him, he saw Tony and T’Challa sitting not far from them, he sighed and kept them on his line of vision “it’s been strongly suggested that we turn over T’Challa and abandon these refugees out here in the bush, I’ll tell you right now; I’m not going to do that, I cant do that” he said, Tony looked at him, his eyes searched his blues, he smiled “I broke my own rule” he said locking eyes with murky brown eyes “I started to give a fuck, started to care; it always the mission first and nothing else, now… now I care about someone else first” he confessed, the murky brown held his blue, he couldn’t hold the stare any longer so he looked at his team “and I brought you guys along with me, we’re about to walk into some serious shit, before we do, I’d just like to… I’d like to hear what you guys have to say about it, that’s all, speak freely” he said
“No” he cut him off making him look at his eyes “it’s not your fault, it won't be; I’m the one who should apologize, what I said to you earlier was not true, it was stupid, arrogant; I’m truly sorry Tony” he said softly, cleaning away the tears from his cheeks and making the murky brown waver but the clear honeyed whiskey didn't returned, he noticed that the walls were not there anymore, not for him; after he turned that chopper around the walls didn't pulled up for him and still he broke that trust, he hurt this amazing man for his hurt ego and pride “you were in the right at not trusting me, I would have done the same in your situation Tony, I’ll will get your people to Kenya, you have my word” he promised making Tony nod, but he saw clearly that his word meant anything to Tony, after all he had given his word before.
It wasn't easy be with the ex marine, not after getting back from Wakanda, he was getting updated with what he had missed in SI, Kamala adopting papers and the fallout of SHIELD and how they wanted Steve to be in the chair, and still go for missions but Steve had decline altogether and was in plans of opening his own diner along with Buck and Sam; so getting time to go on a proper date was a challenge but Steve had asked and he had say yes and they were happy now, still balancing their times and schedules; but he was happier than ever.
“M’Baku! No, please wake up, M’Baku!” T’Challa desperate voice made him turn to look at the man, he was cradling M’Baku lifeless body to his chest, tears freely falling
“Hurry please” he managed to say tone clipped and voice raspy, Stark nodded and went to the others “Hawkeye, go with the package” he yelled over the sound of the helicopters, Clint nodded and followed Stark
“Doc, you need to come now” Buck voice carried by the com, he kneeled and put the very still baby that was on his arms next to the trembling woman, he caressed her face and wiped away the splattered blood, tears falling freely from his clear eyes, he had to look away from the scene, Sam was quick to exit the cottage, Bruce came running and saw the woman on the ground, he kneeled at the other side of the woman and covered her with a blanket, through the window he could see Stark and the others, his eyes found his and went to him, concern clear in his whiskey eyes, he arrived and spared a glance at him and then at the scene just steps away from him, he kneeled beside Bucky, and held his hand, the choked sob he left out made him clench his fists.
“All right” he said, moving to take out his guns and tactic gear, Tony helped him remove every layer with quick movements and in silence, Tony’s face was so close to his, that he could count his eyelashes and notice the freckles on his tan skin, if he just lean a few inches they would kiss, he stilled himself and prayed that the darkness covered his flaming skin, the way Tony removed his layers felt intimate, familiar, just right, as every piece that was left on the ground he felt freer, looser, he sighed when Tony touched his skin, his hands were warm and tender on his skin, every caress made him feel alive, his eyes never left Tony’s, the whiskey dark and gleaming with something, his blues were captivated by them, then Tony lowered his eyes and began to open the medical kit by his feet and began to work, he couldn’t stop staring it was entrancing the way he moved, the way he touched him, he wished , he knew more, to have more of this man.
“Star one” Sam said making him turn to look at Sam, he mouthed Coulson, he nodded and Sam handed him the phone
“I don’t know” he replied honestly, there was no motive for them to be followed, they haven’t cross path with the village they raided yet, so why? “but we’re going to find out” he said looking at Tony talk with the two males from before, smile wide and eyes bright, the two males looked at him fondly, his jealousy flaring in his gut yet again “good job, keep an eye on them” he said, standing up
“Star one, has made contact, they are under heavy fire, and request immediate air support” she explained in rushed words
Tony loved Kamala since her sick mother set foot on the mission, he took care of her on his free time, that is why Kamala is so keen to him.
“Tony is fine, you can move now, go” Scott said making Stark to move along with the others, he followed the man with his eyes and turn to look at Sam and Buck that were now in front of him
"How dare you!” he yelled making the whole room freeze, the silence was deafening, he was ready to laid it to that damn incompetent asshole.
