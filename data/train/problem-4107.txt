He nods to himself, giving Dean a moment to take in those words. Not that they are anything new, per se. But for some reason, Dean thinks – as much as Castiel, apparently – that they are worth repeating. Which is good, because it does remind Dean of just who exactly he is with, what their boundaries are and where their foundation lies. Castiel’s words are grounding, reassuring. Which makes Dean nod as well, showing Castiel that he has understood.
Cas is laughing. It’s a happy laugh and he enjoys himself. It’s truly a sight to see. It’s rare to see Cas so relaxed and Dean feels more than privileged to witness this much less be the cause of it. Dean swirls Cas on the spot and as the swirl ends, Cas stumbles forward against Dean’s chest. Dean holds him tight and it’s a good feeling.
...oh. There was so much he should say, so many things he should explain. He didn’t know where to start. Should he talk about Kelly first? About how they met? Did that really matter after all these years anyway? Should he talk about the documents that he still had somewhere, hidden away, only for the sake of his mind? Should he talk about all the problems Kelly had faced during her pregnancy? Should he talk about how they knew she wouldn’t survive the birth but still insisted of carrying the child to term?
“Shh,” he replies and kisses him again.
“Oh, Dean, you better.”
Castiel barely spared a glance at the magic dude.
“Then I would’ve found you somewhere else. You were lost, and so I found you.”
Castiel paints mostly with his fingers and the faces of the people are wonky at best but still, they stare right into Dean’s heart.
“Truthfully, it might be,” Castiel says with a rueful, kind smile. “Unless anything else has happened this week that could be the cause of this and that I simply don’t know about, then I think there’s reason to believe that you might be dropping.”
It’s perfect like this, for now.
. A bit. Cas is sporting more of a chubby than anything, really, but it’s undeniable that his cock is not soft and easily swaying, but that there is a stiffness to it that makes it defy the water just so. That makes it look even better, even bigger, and it almost feels like it might have grown just a bit ever since Dean has started looking his fill.
something that Dean has known all along about, but is still too scared to name. In the cowardly depths of his heart, he hopes that maybe Cas will do so for him.
he breathes out and puts his hands on Castiel’s cock at first, then against his shoulders, pressing against them, asking for something his mind is too tired to put into words.
At this point, Dean knows he must have sullied the couch cover. He doesn’t need to be allowed to move his head to know little drops of come must have smeared all over the sofa, making it just as filthy as everything about this act is. Because there might be spit among the sticky pearls too, whatever might have dripped from Dean’s rim or balls, right onto the cushion.
“And because of that, you’ll never know how much we
The first few days of the next week feel nothing if not surreal. In the best of ways.
“I know and I appreciate that, but it’s just… you really don’t have to do that. I understand that, should this happen time and time again and I even tell you about it, you might want to consider to just drop me as a sub. I get it. Having to deal with me feeling bad about our plays would be something you haven’t signed up for to bother about, and I–”
It’s a moment of hesitation, for Dean at least. Of considering whether he should step back, shove Cas off, even though he really,
Dean whines and writhes pathetically beneath Castiel’s hands. Because he wants to be spanked and touched by Castiel, wants to be close to him and help him take pleasure from his body and their activities, be the one to be responsible for Castiel’s orgasm. And yet, even if the alternative doesn’t sound as appealing as any of this, Dean has to admit that watching Castiel masturbate and having him watch him do the same does carry an appeal of its own.
“Excellent,” Castiel says as he shuffles the papers of their list, checking through what is ticked off.
The arms around Dean tighten, drag him closer towards Castiel, so close that their upper bodies are connected without any trace of space between them, so close that Castiel’s face is easily nestled against Dean’s throat, so close that Dean doesn’t have any damn chance but to allow him that, to keep his neck bared and his body in his embrace, in this possessive, desperate hold.
And Castiel laughs even as he kisses, presses into Dean’s warmth and promises, despite himself and whatever else he was taught, “Whatever you want, Dean,” into his mouth and to his brows and all over his skin.
The hand on Dean’s shoulder tightens, as naturally as it was put there in the first place, and the gesture makes Dean ache. For something he never had, something he had laughed about when there was just one more father encouraging his son on TV or another mother on the court cheering up her kid with hugs and kisses and proud smiles.
“Not too soon, though.”
Dean wants to keep feeling wanted, dreads what will come once it wears off. Especially since this might happen faster than he thought. Because Castiel is already pushing him off of him – he may keep his arms connected to Dean’s body and may try to set him aside as gently as possible, but there is no mistaking that what Dean wants is not on the table right now.
already promise Castiel that he would.
“Yeah?” Dean tries to tease, but it comes out less sexy than dmbly smiley. “Like when? When you are in meetings with that douche Adler? Or when you have to meet up with your brothers that also work at Sandover? Or when you feel a bit hot and bothered and–” He bites his lip, to keep quiet and to stave off the embarrassment and words alike. This is not his forte, trying to dirty talk or whatever, and even though he tries to become more comfortable with it and more skilled at it, he already feels out of his depth.
“Sure you don’t.” Dean snorts out a drunk little laughter. “Tell you what, though, Cas. I’ll give you all the ugly sweaters and gardens you want,” Dean whispers, nuzzling his nose against Castiel’s ear and pressing a horribly alluring kiss to its shell, “‘s long as you keep touching me.”
Dean can feel his cock let out a drip of precome at that, and even though he can’t see it, he knows it must fall down onto Castiel’s pants, sullying them up with his essence.
“It’s only kisses,” Dean murmurs in reply, but Castiel doesn’t say anything to that.
Castiel made it Sam’s and his by bringing him into his household, by accepting them as their charges and giving them free reign of whatever he has. The Bed, the fridge, the TV, the bathing tub big enough to easily hold two people – whatever Dean could want for, it doesn’t matter. Because it’s already theirs to use as they please.
“No,” Dean hears himself saying to the child care lady. “We wanna stay with Officer Novak.”
“I want to touch you,” Dean lets out in a swoop of air.
Yeah, he doesn’t have to impress John by pretending that he likes coffee that much – that he wouldn’t like a hot cocoa, sweet and topped with cream, just like his mom used to make it for him, that much better. The same kind he always wanted to make for Sammy, even though he never did, not exactly like his mom did, because for some reason, he just couldn’t. A reason that he strongly suspects to be his childish selfishness, sadly. But what else is new.
“Yes, sir.”
Dean vaguely remembers what has led Castiel to this question; that sadness that started to grow with each day of the week, that loneliness that Castiel was so hung up on, that fear of having to face all of this by himself, over the course of this weekend and beyond. Thinking that this will be his past experiences all over again.
Relentlessly, he works over Dean’s tummy, scolding Dean when he sucks it in so hard that it becomes obvious that he does. He coaxes Dean to just let it go and let it expand naturally, and once Dean listens to him and just breathes normally, not trying to hide the roundness of his belly, he also relaxes more. Weird, how he can feel the air expanding his lungs more throughout all of his body, the effect instantenous in how even how the kisses he receives feel less constricted and more pleasurable.
The fifth time it happens, Dean seems to be anticipating it. Or, rather, provoking it.
“I suppose we can stay for five more minutes,” Castiel easily offers as a compromise, “but no more than that. Both of us seem tired enough that we shouldn’t take the risk of falling asleep in here.”
Dean huffs out a pained laugh. “Just look at me.”
instead.”
Dean swallows as he lifts the paper to his eyes, to take a proper look at it, to read the scrawl of a message.
It has been years since anyone has touched him without harm in mind.
“I apologize. You feel asleep and started trembling and I wanted to make sure that you don’t become sick or that your body goes into shock after what we did. I turned up the heater, fetched a sheet and put it over you, but you kept shaking. It is probably too thin, yet a blanket might have been too rough on your skin. So I considered that the warmth of another human body might help you stave off the cold, and you did stop trembling.” He pauses for long enough to suck in a small breath. He probably realizes he has been babbling. “I hope the sheet is not too much for your skin and I am sorry if this makes you uncomfortable, Dean. I promise I didn’t touch you in any inappropriate way while you were asleep.”
“You sound lovely,” Castiel smiles into Dean’s skin, then licks a broad stripe over Dean’s pink nub, catching it with first his lips, then the grazing of his teeth, and
you, see you enjoy yourself, and I wanna kiss you then. Kiss you until you feel good, kiss you with me inside you, kiss you while we– oh,
“That he made
“If you have any other plans on this Friday evening, I would understand, naturally. Please, don’t feel obligated to cancel any dates because of a whim of mine. We can simply meet another time, if you would like, Dean.” ‘Another time’ being the code for ‘never’, of course, seeing as Novak is giving him an out and a polite way of saying ‘fuck off and leave me poor bastard alone’. It’s a good sign, Dean knows, a negotiation already, and Dean wants more, wants their negotiations to include other borders and wants, wants them to run deeper, as deep as they can.
Dean corrects his former assessment, twitching and panting all the more, because
a deep voice cuts in, sharp and admonishing. Dean swallows and fidgets when he the other creature finally reaches him.
“That’s good.” Castiel rewards him with a kiss to his forehead, and even though this simple gesture seems to be lacking in any sexual intention, it makes Dean feel all warm inside. “And how did you feel before? Can you maybe try to put it into words for me now?”
“I do hope your smile is the result of a sight that you are satisfied to see instead of one that has you feel like laughing,” Castiel teases and brushes his smile against Dean’s – one Dean wasn’t even aware of until just now pointed out.
“Yeah, I know,” Dean replies. And just as he honestly means this offer -- because he trusts Castiel to see where to draw the line by himself --, he is also glad that Castiel won’t just allow it. That he will always ask.
“Cas,” Dean sighs back, nosing into the fabric of Castiel’s shirt, without any sign of shame.
Dean lets out a little choked-off moan, and Castiel sees is for the go-ahead that it is.
for the last hour or so, and beyond that, he finds he has a hard time remembering anything else.
“I thought about you,” Dean says, “and about the hickeys you are giving me. I was wondering for how long they’ll stay – for how long you’ll bother to renew them. And that if you do, will you do it in the same way as now? Whisk me away into your office and mark me up here? Maybe even–” Shame and arousal are warring inside of him, making the words fall from his lips in a heated hush, “maybe even take me here while you do? Over your desk or on this couch, holding me down and f-fucking me hard, only letting me up once you’re through with me and I am all marked up as yours again?”
But nothing’s lost, Dean decides. They haven’t even seen each other naked, as both of them have decided that they want to take it slow and concentrate on getting to know each other better first, so Dean still has plenty of time to trick Cas into thinking his boyfriend (and the word alone make Dean giggle) is a fit guy and to actually bulk up in the meantime.
It’s stinging and hot and Dean considers it a good thing that Castiel’s fingers do nothing but dance at the edges of his butt cheeks because Dean isn’t sure he could handle them being touched right now.
It was sweet and thrilling and left Dean constantly blushing and on the good kind of edge. It actually increased his output and the quality of it, simply because he knew that if he excelled, there would be good things waiting on him. Because that’s what those touches and that praise were – just genuinely
“I forgive you,” Castiel reassures him as he kisses his way back up, bypassing Dean’s cock and the wet mess he has made of it, instead opting to press some kisses to his hip bones that are noticeable just so and to his tummy. “But I want to remind you of what we actually wanted to do. You wanted to show me how good and obedient you can be for me when you are lying over my lap and offering up your beautiful behind for me.” He squeezes that one handful of ass he still has, while his other hand is drawing broad strokes over Dean’s nipples and throat. “Do you still think you can do this for me?”
It takes a moment for Castiel to register the words, apparently, because he just looks at Dean with still the same confusion and then his face brightens and he huffs out a laugh that may or may not sound fond. “I was thinking, yes, but not
Then, Castiel breathes out deeply. With a cautious sound, he puts the pen down on the table and lets go of the sheets of paper. Instead of staying seated on his armchair, he heaves himself up, only to plop on the couch instead. Close enough to touch Dean if he reaches out to him, but not close enough to press himself against him in any way.
Dean makes a soft noise that is neither agreement nor disagreement and shrugs with his shoulders. It came out of the blue when speaking in terms of timing during the conversation, not generally because of–
“Meg is scheduled to come tomorrow and change the sheets in any case, so you don’t need to worry about that. What is of more importance now is what you would prefer.”
Dean laughs a bit at that, a bit of the remaining tension leaving his body. “Yeah, of course.” Because the Roadhouse is one of his favourite places to eat, and he knows that despite his serious frown and the harsh tone he can adapt, Novak enjoys nothing more than a good hearty burger. Both know not only the food there, but also the people, the whole atmosphere. It’s immediately a nice thing to look forward to, no matter how strange Novak’s request is. Because surely, he can’t ask him out to talk about –
“Good,” Castiel soothingly rolls out over his smiling lips, and that’s so not fair. “Does that mean you would still want to continue as suggested?”
His chest is heaving and Dean can hear in his ears how his breath picks up, sounding like he is running a marathon, although he is doing nothing but lie there, in his Dom’s lap.
than everything else they are doing. A surer sign of how softer and more vulnerable he has become, of how much farther he has strayed from the path that his father had laid out before him so long ago, of how completely he is gone on Cas.
“Alright, princess, but only if you tell me what’s wrong.”
It’s how earnest Castiel looks and sounds that renders Dean speechless for a moment. Where their preferences
“I wonder.”
“Don’t forget to count out loud for me, my gorgeous boy,” Castiel reminds him in a low voice, into the tense air between them. And in the very next moment, the tension as well as the swelling quietness breaks, is smashed apart as Castiel’s hand comes down hard and with a loud and resounding slap on Dean’s ass, on his sensitive skin.
“What’s right in front of me, huh?” Castiel reiterated thoughtfully, one of his thumbs tracing the line of Dean’s jaw and his lips.
lush behind, glorious and soft, and it is somewhere around this realization that all of his reason leaves him to make room for something else entirely, the urge to squeeze this beautiful piece of creation.
“Oh, Dean,” Castiel sighs and puts a kiss to Dean’s forehead, so tenderly that Dean knows he isn’t pissed or anything that Dean so easily gives him blanket permission. “How are you feeling?” Castiel asks, changing the topic while fingers skirt cautiously at the top of Dean’s thigh, going no further. “Are you hurting very much?”
“I’m sorry, sir,” Dean presses out between the teeth he has sunken into his lip, “it just feels so good.”
Dean breathes out heavily and closes his eyes for a bit, letting the words and kisses wash over him and sink inside.
Cas strokes over one of Dean’s butt cheeks, with the intention to soothe him maybe, but the tenderness and casualness of it, as if it were a lover stroking his lover’s cheek – on his face – only makes Dean feel hotter, has him lose himself that bit more.
“Then why don’t you?” Dean whines, half-mad to silence Castiel and to keep him talking, and he earns a slap that is so hard that he can
A sudden cold sensation takes hold of Dean, much colder than the leather of the sofa or the leather of any belt he has ever been struck by, the fear of being left alone again, discarded for a second time in a mere week.
“May I?” Castiel asks, his voice barely above a whisper, as he keeps his hands in suspense above Dean’s belt.
It’s easy like this for Castiel to put kisses to the side of Dean’s face, all while his arms are strong and soothing around him. Yet, Castiel doesn’t waste too much time on kissing a warm line up and down Dean’s cheek. Rather, he kisses him for a few moments, unhurried presses of lips against a cheek and temple that are still somewhat sullied by tear tracks, and strokes affectionately over that part of Dean’s chest that he holds him by, passing over his peaked buds and heaving chest.
As is common knowledge.
Dean nods hesitatingly. “I’m fine.”
He crowds closer and allows Cas to feed the last bites of the pie with his fingers.
It takes him a second to realize that a scream is just a scream and that he has a job to do and blows to count, so he quickly calls out, “One!” and pushes his ass up and against to where he knows the next bout of sweet pain will come from.
– from your ‘clients’ and from whoever fails to protect you at home, from whoever is responsible for you being in this kind of situation in the first place. You think I want to screw you over and that I enjoy picking you off the streets and threatening you with jail, but the truth is, I’m doing this for you, I’m doing this because of kids like you, I’m doing this because you deserve to be
Because Castiel had left it up to Dean to decide at whose place they want to spend the weekend. Dean knows Castiel doesn’t want to pressure him into coming to his own place a second time or as much as he doesn’t want Dean to believe that he thinks his apartment is better anyhow, which is why he let him choose. So he did. Which Castiel accepted with a smile.
“You’re drunk, Dean,” Castiel pants out, but more than strict does he probably sound aroused. “We must not go too far, not while neither of us can consent.”
Dean would want to offer to help or for Castiel to make use of any other part of his body to seek his relief, so that he can give back even more of how good he has made Dean feel. But Castiel surely seems to be enjoying himself more than enough, if his heavy panting and little sighs of Dean’s name right against Dean’s neck and cheeks, where he doesn’t stop showering him in kisses, are anything to go by.
It feels nice, stoking. And some primal part of Dean longs to finally see all of Castiel this time; he was in too much of a haze to get a proper look at him when both of them were naked and bathing, and all Dean can remember is a nest of wild, dark hair and not much else. But Dean wants to know and see and
I’m a guy and all that.”
has on him.
One night, both Novak and him happen to have to stay late in the office, feverishly working through the accounts of a deal that is crucial for all of Sandover, but that a few guys from another department thoroughly
Without quite meaning to, he circles his hips in an attempt to rub his dick against Castiel’s pants a bit better now, but already after the second circle of his hips, there’s the sharp sting of a hand coming down onto the jiggly flesh of his ass.
Dean guessed that was also the reason for his dramatic position, and his withdrawal from all of them once they had finished the hunt. Down in the dirt with them all, it must have sucked to have had such close calls, whereas before, he could have smote them with so much as a glance.
“I see,” Dean says, a blush of his own creeping up into his cheeks, and if he couldn’t feel how limp and useless his dick is still lying against Castiel’s hip bones, he would almost expect it to react to this newfound knowledge. “Better safe than sorry, huh?”
“Your voice always sounds so pleasant. No, more than that. Absurdly enticing, if I’m honest.” Castiel nods and hums just so, and Dean thinks that if his voice already is enticing, then Castiel’s must be nothing but a siren’s song. “But even more so like this, without confines, with no one else around to listen to it but me,” he strokes over Dean’s bare and wetted chest, “and while having the opportunity to not just hear, but also feel you speaking.” The hand not resting on Dean’s crotch hand works its way up higher, past Dean’s nipples and up to where his throat lies open, exposed to the flat palm stroking over it. Not pressing, just exploring, as gently and non-threatening and nonetheless proving his point as everything else Castiel’s done.
Despite his desperation, though, Dean can feel when Castiel suddenly nods, the movement of which has the head of his cock slipping out of Castiel’s throat for a moment and then right back in again as Castiel digs his fingers into the supple skin of Dean’s hips and swallows him down to the root with a deep growl that has Dean trembling. It’s a possessive sound that is just further permission, an appeal for his boy to spill himself just like he is now allowed to, a sign of how even though Castiel is the one with a dick down his throat,
The sound of Castiel’s honest-to-god bee-slippers is the only thing to interrupt this silence after a few beats, and then their sound gets taken over by Castiel’s voice that’s now much closer than before, right in front of Dean. Dean still won’t look up and at him.
-- about it.
Preferably forever.
remain,” he presses his last three words out between his teeth, his eyes suddenly looking angry, dangerous. For a moment there, Dean is scared that this anger is directed at him, that Castiel could be disgusted with the idea of other men having left their traces on him, as he has experienced before.
He still wants more, allows himself to beg for it because he knows he won’t be called names for it, won’t have to lick Castiel’s shoes or be beaten for being a slut and then left by himself with no reprise to speak of. Since Castiel is not out for that – he wants to do things that he doesn’t have to and that are filthy, just because they feel good to Dean, and he only punishes Dean when he won’t let him make him feel good. When he goes against what they have discussed and then agreed upon, both before and during the scene. So, he might be ashamed for himself, but not afraid. And shame won’t hold him back when what he might receive in return feels so goddamn
There’s already an abundance of what Dean would need to make a home.
“Better,” Dean replies without having to even think about it. Because even though he couldn’t quite put his finger on it before, the very least he knew was that he wasn’t feeling
“Just because you initiated it doesn’t mean I am necessarily still allowed to touch you.”
. He just told Dean that he’d like to be touched by him,
Dean sighs deeply as his flaming skin slowly starts to cool. The lotion takes away the sting and the need to roughly press his hands against his butt to scratch or fight against the pain in any way, while at the same time, he had rather not let anything touch it at all. But it’s okay like this, with Castiel taking the greatest care, working his magic and humming lowly as he does, no song and no rhythm but a pleasant sound nonetheless.
Castiel lets out a soft, breathy sound that has an amused ring to it and presses his lips against the top of Dean’s head. He doesn’t chastise Dean for his lack of a proper answer.
– a sure sign of just how thoroughly he enjoys himself – as he rolls his hips back onto the cock that is hard just for him,
Which Castiel immediately takes as his cue to step in. He gets up from his seat on the couch and walks over to Dean in confident strides. Without hesitation, he puts a hand on Dean’s shoulder blades and rubs it up and down, in a soothing motion.
“It’s
But he doesn’t think about that, not right now. All Dean can think about is that he is glad that he has chosen as he did, because not only seems Castiel happy that this is what they will do now, wash and bathe and cuddle each other, but he himself can’t help but be genuinely
Dean lifts his hand when Castiel is fully unclothed, his sleep gowns resting by his side, in a silent request to pause, to not put on his clothes for the night. for like this, Dean’s eyes are free to take in all of Castiel’s body, green gaze licking over it like flames, not like ablaze but a beacon, and when he finally catches Castiel’s eyes, his own are dark and hungry, as though deserving of a real feast now
His cock is also hard and slippery as it thrusts against Dean’s thigh, and it becomes even more slippery when Castiel tightens his grip on Dean’s scalp and thigh to keep him fixed in place as he ruts up against in more fervor and in a series of increasingly desperate, panting strokes. One of his moans breaks on a grunt and he presses his mouth and all of his face tightly into the crook of Dean’s neck as he spills himself on him, Dean’s name choked out and breathless, sullying Dean’s skin in the most delicious of ways.
“Why not?” Dean demands hotly.
Already on the defense again, as much as he doesn’t really feel like going through with it, Dean thinks he should protest against the amount of honey in the mug that he suspects to be his. Sure, he himself thinks the more honey, the better, but Castiel doesn’t know that. Castiel shouldn’t just assume to treat him like a kid and put in as much honey as he likes. It’s annoying. Especiallyso  when Dean’s assumption about which mug is whose is confirmed by Castiel pouring milk into the sunny mug, but not his the blue one.
Which is why, any other time, a week or two ago, he might have kept silent about the mesmerizing orange sweater that he only spies by lucky coincidence, when Sam leads all of them to an electronics store next to a small and hidden clothing store.
“Oh, you know,” Dean speaks around the lump in his throat, and he doesn’t even know whether his thoughts are ridiculous anymore or whether they are simply true. “Wouldn’t wanna actually
Dean wants to hide; wants to flee. “Then surely you understand.”
The demon’s answering laugh is humorless, bordering on cruel, as it usually is. The same way his behavior is, as in this instance as well. Because instead of giving any proper thought to Castiel’s request, he turns it into a crooned proposition: “Oh baby, you know you’re always allowed to ‘take care of me’.”
Dean cannot help but moan at Castiel’s words and the feeling of him sinking so deeply into him, so
Jo just grins at him. “It’s part of my charm; the men actually tip better if I’m rude to them. Maybe some strange fetish or something, who knows.” She winks, and Dean wonders if she knows, if
And just like that, the most vulnerable parts of Dean are bared; this neck and his chest and his belly and his half-hard dick. It’s only that thick stripe where his robe is open that he is naked, but going by how sensitive the already displayed parts are, he might as well be fully in the nude.
But, it’s not enough. Dean – greedy and selfish as he is – can’t help but wish for Castiel’s hand, resting against the sheets, to pet his hair and hold his waist and for Castiel to kiss him again and hold him and call him a good boy once more.
calls for.
Then comes Cas. Dean can’t look him in the eye while he tells him; not because he’s ashamed of it – not that much, at least, not anymore – but because he feels it would reveal too much, not just about his sexuality, but about what it means in relation to Cas, about Dean’s feelings for him. Cas is as calm and non-judgemental as Dean knew he would be. Just like Charlie, he’s been out for some time now, and thanks Dean for telling him in a warm voice. When Dean finally musters up the courage to at least glance at him, he finds a small smile on Cas’ lips and shining blue eyes.
that his balls press against Dean’s butt cheeks, silken skin against soft globes, but still, Castiel tries to reach even deeper.
“Would it be possible for Dean and Sam to stay with me for the time being, and that I could apply for guardianship for them in the meantime? I realize that, being a bachelor and working in a rather dangerous field, I may not be the most suitable applicant, but,” Officer Novak’s voice drifts off there for a moment, and Dean doesn’t need to be able to see to feel two pairs of eyes on him, “I believe it would be best for everyone if I were allowed to watch over the boys and take them up as my legal charges.”
are always looking for a fight, right? Angry, angry teenagers who just don’t know any better and are always out for shit.
So “I’m free. Absolutely no plans,” Dean says with a smile that must look far more confident than he feels, and seems to suffice in convincing Novak. Of that Dean wants to meet him tonight, that he is not cowed and not accepting with resentment.
As weird as it sounds, it’s also appealing. Yet, “Aftercare?”
No kiss even, no proposition for them to go to Castiel’s place or his own and have their first test run as play partners, just that simple gentle touch that has left Dean abuzz.
They move carefully to sit down on the bed again, trying not to spill the coffee or the milk in the bowls, and deposit themselves on either side of the bed. Some random side, neither ‘Dean’s’ or ‘Castiel’s’, as the night before, there was also no such thing. Neither when they went to bed – because Castiel carried and placed a still deeply relaxed and bathed Dean onto the same side of the mattress that he himself took – nor when they slept – because they were entangled with each other, in the middle of the bed, never straying far enough to have either of them claim any side as theirs. They were a pile of limbs that came to look like a couple of spoons eventually, but unintentionally.
Dean turns his face away and lets the silence speak for him. He knows it’s stupid, by now, that the Doms were in the wrong not to treat him like Castiel does this very moment, but there’s a difference between knowing something logically and feeling it in his heart. He’s ashamed for how he has let himself be treated. Ashamed for some of the things he’s done, too. Yes, he was young and reckless and didn’t know that he had a say in this as well, that a sub’s voice is just as important as the Dom’s, but that doesn’t change much when he looks back on it. Because the feelings are still real and impossible to shake off; maturity and knowledge can’t just so easily override deep-seated shame and humiliation. Can’t undo that he was felt those things and still does; that they are a part of who he is and of what he has done.
And with it, Dean realizes that there
I will give you what you deserve”.
When Dean darts out his tongue to lick over his lips, he finds them dry. “Or do you not want to?”
Dean thinks he might not be breathing, but he doesn’t know. He just doesn’t know. How could something like breathing be relevant when there’s a determined former Angel of the Lord blanketing his body with his own, all strong lines and set intent and the warmth Dean was already missing after getting to enjoy it only once.
That’s why he needs a Dom he can trust, he knows. A good Dom won’t take advantage of his subspace, will let him slide into it and take him through it and gently coax him back out. A good Dom won’t use his absolute surrender of control and need to please against him, but in his favour. A
Instead, Castiel starts running his hands up and down, as softly as feathers tickling his skin.
So, Dean takes the patiently offered coffee, not yet with a smile but a steady hand, catches Castiel’s crinkled eyes and puts the rim of his mug to his already parted lips.
Dean feels like sobbing at how tender and good it feels. How intimate it is. He doesn’t, though, only keeps his eyes fixated on the man above him, all strength and care and all Dean’s. For now, at least. But oh, as if that already wasn’t more than enough.
Castiel sends him a sloppy message that evening that makes Dean believe that he might be drunk or otherwise occupied. He doesn’t mind, though, because Castiel signs off with an emoticon blowing a kiss, and the memory of how it felt to have Castiel truly press him down and kiss him passionately has Dean busy for the following quarter-hour. Once he’s done and needs to clean himself up, with nobody there to take care of it for him, he finds himself feeling somewhat hollow.
“Is this about Adler? That ‘error’, I mean?” Castiel sounds like he thinks that error be be about as much bullshit as Dean did, but even then, there’s nothing Dean could’ve done about it. Not without Castiel, at the very least. He probably could have vetoed Adler’s nitpicking and told him to shove it, had he been around or had Dean asked him to. But Dean knows that if Castiel truly wants to become CEO one day, he shouldn’t have to deal with such petty issues or make an enemy out of Zachariah, who has big influence in his own rights. So, Dean will have to work a bit longer on a Friday night – big fucking deal.
But even that dark and probably true line of thought is quickly left behind, discarded for the moment, when Castiel speaks again.
“Oh, you will have one as well. As soon as we are done, I will copy it for you. Don’t worry.”
Castiel sees Dean’s amusement in the shake of his shoulders and the shuddering breath against his neck, but it’s the quickening rhythm beneath his palm that garners most of his attention, as it tells him that any further conversation will now be delayed, even if it is far from over.
accompanied by soft little moans that must be either Castiel’s or his own slipping into Castiel’s mouth, or both, just both of them giving voice to their pleasure, to their
Castiel doesn’t even tug at it. All that he does is keep looking like the cat that caught the canary and keeping the tip of his finger on Dean’s incessantly bobbing Adam’s apple, something that might make Dean feel vulnerable and uncomfortable any other day, but only leaves him raw and yet full of trust and pleasant anticipation right now. Because as vulnerable as he might be right now, he feels nothing but invincible.
but Dean can feel Castiel smile at his own lame joke right where he is, breathing hotly and almost casually against Dean’s hole, and Dean wants to shy away from it because no one has ever done this for him, has licked or kissed him at a place so filthy, and that’s also why he wants this even more. Because
Castiel nods, his smile returning. “Good.” He then lifts his hands and reaches for Dean’s robe-covered thighs, stroking them up and down at his own leisurely pace and with a pleased expression, then he pulls them closer to himself, guiding Dean to stand in his warmth, in the V of his legs.
He breathes out the last word. “You must believe me that I didn’t intentionally– try to instigate this, far from it. There can be no proper power exchange if the power is already unbalanced beforehand, considering our positions, making this a matter of whether it could possibly be consensual, let alone sane. Yet, I couldn’t help but be drawn to you, to the way you hold yourself, your strength and ingenuity and relentlessness, to your beauty, to how you actually allow me to see past that and how you surrender all of this with a word of praise or a single touch.”
him for. “I vow to you that you will not come to regret to take me as a mate, that I will never bring you any harm, but only pleasure, my beloved Dean.”
Castiel seems none too impressed by this and shakes his head. Dean can feel his stubble rub up against his tummy with the motion, and for a moment, he thinks of himself as a cat who does nothing but exactly that all day.
“that was very imprudent,” Castiel protests belatedly once Dean is fully dressed again and already pulling back the covers of the haphazard sleeping place in the middle of the tent
Castiel just looks at him, in the same way he has looked at him whenever he exposed some part of that past that, for some reason, won’t quit feeling shameful to Dean. That is too difficult to properly think about, to put into words, to even acknowledge to himself. It’s annoying – almost as annoying as that, despite Castiel’s attempts to appear neutral, there’s still some lingering traces of pity in his eyes whenever it comes to this. Yes, beneath the heat that always arises and the hard edge of caring, there’s
“Thank you,” Officer Novak says, sincerely. Dean doesn’t echo the sentiment out loud, but in his head, he, too, thanks her.
Because it’s a heady promise. One that almost has Dean squirming again, although he doesn’t, knows better now. He remains stock-still, obedient in his lack of motion as Castiel looks down at him with a pleased expression. Because that’s not what he wants to be for Castiel – not some bratty sub that constantly disregards his Dom’s commands and challenges his authority and has him put him over his lap and spank him all the time. That is – yes, not
“No, wait!” Dean hastily intervenes. “Make that a No for the weight gain as well. If it’s meant for me. No more pounds for me.” In a moment of mental absence, he hasn’t really thought about how he he couldn’t afford to gain weight and just went with. Just thinking about how nice it might be to be a bit softer for Castiel and to have Castiel like that bit more meat and to have him feed him some more to reward him for it. Whereas actually, Dean is one of the last people who should think about putting on some weight. Not only would it mean he would have to buy a new assortment of suits, he would also simply look disastrous. What with his soft belly and his meaty thighs and butt and that little pudge beneath his chin that just won’t budge, he’s in no position to gain
“Did you do that on purpose? Keeping me from my duties with sex?” Dean asks suspiciously, to which Castiel just snorts. His snort falls somewhere between playful and caught.
admission of, “I never could have done this without you, Dean.”
him to do this. Be for Dean what Dean needs him to be, because in return, Dean will be
Dean’s glare grows and grows, and he can only hope it makes him look more mature, more threatening. “My family is none of your business,” he says, trying to put an end to their little game. He doesn’t want that bleeding heart cop working to pry facts and secrets and names about his family from him, would have much preferred for him to fuck him in his undercover car and dump him by the roadside instead.
“Yeah, well,” Dean says, and he sounds as if he is still rather irritated. “He can shove his concerns up his ass.”
It’s a strange reminder of last night, because then, Castiel’s hands were there to keep Dean still, too. To keep him fixed until Castiel had given him all he wanted to give, and taken so little in return. But there’s no play and punishment sparking in Castiel’s eyes when he gazes up at Dean now, his breath already heavy.
Such as now, when Dean steps inside and dutifully closes the door behind himself.
something, Dean,” Castiel murmurs, and Dean wonders if he is ignoring what he just said or if maybe he didn’t even really listen. “If anything like this happens ever again. If you ever feel low or in any way negatively affected after a scene, I need you to tell me. No, even more than that. Just in general, if you don’t feel well, know you don’t need to hold it in. Know that I want to listen if you want to tell me. I wish for you to do tell me if you feel bad. Because I want you to know that you are not alone. That there’s no need for you to feel
Maybe he’s just not man enough.
Maybe it didn’t. Maybe the mother I saved changed something. Maybe the old man saying good-bye gave closure to someone. Maybe the child I let go grew up to influence someone they were never meant to meet. Who can tell?
“Oh? You want to be tied to your bedposts, completely at my mercy?”
Dean nods.
“Hello, Dean,” the man says and Dean breathes easier.
Lisa shifts behind him before she starts to talk.
Dean just gapes at the man; and now, for the first time, properly takes him in: the guy has dark brown hair, a solid tan; he’s got stubble on his face and the bluest eyes Dean’s ever seen. Also there’s a flower in his hair but instead of it being weird, it makes a strange sort of sense somehow.
“Cas, he’s... he’s gone.”
The flower wasn’t very big, but it looked nice.
Upon realising that he couldn’t go back to Dean, he cried harder.
He sat up with a start and slapped the plate out of Castiel’s hand. He didn’t want food. And he didn’t want to look at his friend’s face.
That realisation hurt. But maybe Dean did. After all, Dean
Castiel grabbed his hand and dragged him off – Dean had barely enough time to lock the car. It seemed like he made a good choice. If he was able to make Castiel that excited with relatively little effort... Dean smiled. It made him think that maybe people didn’t take Castiel on dates, and that would just be a crime.
Castiel. Oh Lord Feathers, Castiel came.
to see. Oh god, he looked so perfect. Castiel looked so perfect kneeling between his legs, with Dean’s hand in his hair, sucking on his dick.
“So good for me.”
He looked at the flower Cas gave him, he put it in a vase and placed it in front of his window. Since this was his flower to do with as he pleased, he tried a few experiments on it. Despite what Rowena had said, Sam just couldn’t believe there was no magic involved. Maybe it was so little that one couldn’t pick it up?
“That’s great, Sammy,” he says, “as long as I get a key?”
You think about the world in your hands. You think about warmth, and soft hands and hugs.
They were still beautiful. He’d put them here over a week ago and sort of forgot about them; and they’re still beautiful. Dean grabbed his umbrella tighter and bent down to take a closer look. Sure, they didn’t look as pristine as they did when he bought them, but considering the circumstances they could still win a beauty-contest. Did flowers have beauty-contests? He thought about that for awhile. Were there tiny flower bikinis? Dean snorted and looked at the gravestone.
“Edgar peanut?”
He was sweating. He kept rubbing his hands on his pant-legs in a desperate attempt to dry them; not that it worked in the slightest. He put on a considerable amount of cologne, just to mask the smell of his own nervous odour. He wouldn’t want Cas to think anything bad of him. Dean’s been sitting in his car for a bit too long but he couldn’t muster up the courage to leave quite yet. He must look pathetic: he was sitting in his nice, sleek car in front of a flower shop and was sweating tears and blood just because he had a date with a cute guy.
Dean was paralyzed. He knew these thoughts. But Cas was supposed to be stronger than this. Nothing was supposed to touch him. Castiel raised his other hand and put it on Dean’ cheek. That, too, was nice. They should’ve done that more often.
It’s quiet in the town.
He can’t stop. He doesn’t even try.
So why did he choose to live like he did?
It groaned a little as It sat a bit straighter. It wasn’t really permitted to leave its chair, but nobody really complained if It did. The room was empty. There were some machines at one wall but they didn’t have any screens so It didn’t know what they did. There was also some sort of window on one of the other walls. It couldn’t see through it and It didn’t know what was behind The Window. It figured that the others must be behind the wall – sometimes It was given tasks and as soon as It finished, people would come in. Other than that – and of course, its chair – there was nothing in the room. It looked up. The light came from up there but It couldn’t see anything. They must be lamps, It thought. They were hard to see and only if It really squinted its eyes.
Now you wait for Dean to tell you to go away.
Dean insisted that they “dress nice” because they had a reason to celebrate. So that’s why both of them are dressed in their best clothes which consisted in somewhat presentable jeans and a relatively nice shirt.
This was everything he was now. No true face anymore, no true voice. It was just this now. The human face he saw in the mirror, the voice he heard in his ears. There was nothing more than that now. On one side it was scary. He felt so alone inside of himself all of a sudden. On the other side, he might now be able to understand humanity in a way he never had before.
I just want you.
Dean didn’t make it to the flower shop until way after five. He’d been constantly half-hard in his pants and he couldn’t wait to see Cas again. He barged into the door just to see that Castiel was catering to about five people. Fuck. Edgar cawed at him, so Dean went over there.
. And even if it was possible, I don’t have enough time. You know that. Dean, please. Please. I don’t want this. I don’t want this to become a reality, Dean,
“And he – Jack, he wants to see you. He didn’t get to say good-bye, y’know? He really misses you and, Jack, he’s – he’s sick or something. We found him covered in some black goo – you know, it kinda looked the Empty Goo thing, but I don’t – the goo is gone now, but he’s weak and he was coughing that stuff up earlier today and – I just... Jack, please come here. Fix him? He deserves it, yeah? So... just please, when you have a moment off from being God, could you... just pop in?”
Maybe he could see them again.
Jack had seemed so genuine. But then, Jack is just a child. You don’t know how old he is exactly. But you are somewhat sure that he should start school. And once he did, then he wouldn’t need you anymore. And just how would you be sending him to school? You have no money. You don’t even have a home.
? This good thing was
Sam didn’t even look up. Did they shift when Rowena came in? He could almost swear that they did, but they
His cheeks were hollow.
The guy looks at him and Dean’s not sure what he sees in these eyes. Could it be recognition?
He should’ve been better for Lisa. If he could’ve just kept her, then –
“Then maybe you should suffer for your precious human.”
Dean reaches out.
“Dean,” Sam says sternly and Dean can barely lift his head. He doesn’t remember the last time he’s eaten something. He hopes he didn’t neglect Miracle too much.
It was stupid. Of course it was fucking stupid! Castiel wouldn’t do that.
When we met, you told me that good things do happen.
“Cas, what is this?” Dean asked while eyeing the crown. Sam, however, simply chuckled and put the crown on. “Dean, come on,” he said to his brother, “we’re celebrating, remember?”
He flapped his wings and cawed.
Castiel had sat down next to him – really close – and nodded. “I haven’t! I rarely find the time, and going by myself is little fun, so I usually spend time with Edgar. It’s too bad he can’t hold a bowling ball. I make him play soccer sometimes.”
“Dean,” Lisa says and she doesn’t break the silence. Dean has been expecting this talk.
He takes Castiel’s hand.
“Are there people inside?” Sam asked Subject what’s-his-face and the boy just cocked his head. “Just the people that give me tasks. But I haven’t seen them in a few days.” The boy furrowed his brows. “I haven’t looked for them. Do you think they’re fine?”
Dean starts to drive. There is the open road in front of them; and at the end, Eileen will be waiting.
Damn, he was so embarrassed. Ellen said today would be on her and well, that was nice. But the bar-wide cheer was
...” He was begging and he knew it. He just
Dean nodded, at a loss for words and Cas slid over to the passenger side. He took a few steadying breaths and started the car.
Yes, you know. The only question is how long it stays that way.
“Everybody can have the stars,” he says and holds your hand again.
How could he deny that wish?
Sam huffed. “Dad isn’t exactly the easiest person to be around, Cas.”
He sits there for a moment longer, indecisive. Then he gets up and gets ready to leave.
Sam hangs up and Dean grins.
A week later, another scouting party was send forth to find out what happened to them. They found only ashes. They collected all they could, declared them all dead and honoured them with a soldier’s death.
“It wasn’t Cas,” he says and Sam nods.
“Yeah I’m gonna,” he replied once he was free again. Strangely enough he actually felt like this sentence was true. Whatever Castiel did last night, it felt like all his doubts have burned away. “But don’t you have to go to work now?”
“He’s always just needed my powers but now that I’ve got none of them left, I lost my usefulness to him. It’s okay. He saved me from April. That means something, right? It means he cares just a little bit. Maybe – maybe if I’m really good and prove myself, then he’ll take me back. I’ll just become a very good human being and then Dean will see that I’m worth it. He’ll say that it was just a test to see how I’d do and then I’ll have passed and he’ll hug me and we can eat burritos together.
As they stood, they picked up an Asphodel from the ground and put it into their hair.
You are forgiven, Castiel. You were always forgiven.
Dean was here. Dean had come. Dean had come to save him.
Cas cries at night sometimes and Dean pretends not to hear.
You are glad that they found you in the alley, if only for Jack’s sake. You feel Sam sitting down next to you. What is he going to say? You’re afraid. You fist your blanket. It’s very thin. You wish it was thicker. You wish you could wrap yourself in it. You wish you hadn’t woken up. You wish Jack wouldn’t have gotten a wheelchair.
“I can’t die,” he opened his speech with.
He didn’t remember the last time someone was proud of him.
He’s happy for her.
“You burned to ash and came back to life?”
Sam nods.
Castiel was in love with Dean Winchester.
“Had I known I’d meet such a beautiful lady here, I’d have brought her the flowers she deserves.”
do those things. Maybe it was just his head getting in the way. He wanted to prove how good he was and in so doing, he ruined everything. If he could only stop trying to prove himself to others... but that likely wasn’t going to happen.
Dean looked up with a start. “Edgar?!”
Dean wonders.
the guy that he saw. I need to be the guy that he fell in love with. I can be. I know I can. So let’s go find your girl.”
He just has to carry on.
“Dean,” Sam says and Dean looks up. Sam and Eileen have stopped crying and that’s good. He waves at Eileen who smiles at him.
Castiel wondered what he could do to make it right.
“So you are Mary,” Castiel said in a low tone. “I hope the flowers I picked out did you justice.” He petted the petals a bit and Dean thought that they would need to be replaced soon. “I’m sorry we never got to meet. But don’t worry – I’ll take good care of Dean. I’ll look after Sam, too, so there’s no need to worry.”
. I can only ever hope to be as strong as you, Cas.
He was a fraud.
On the way home, Dean murmurs to Cas constantly and he wants to believe that the angel can understand him. And even if he can’t – he just wants to talk to Cas. He can’t even count the days since he’s last been so happy.
You’re not good enough for him.
couldn’t tell Cas but whatever. “Yeah – I know. I wanted to ask you: we’re gonna celebrate tonight down at the Roadhouse. Do you want to come?”
“Let’s go,” Dean said.
But it was Castiel’s flower.
“...Cas?”
It’s a nice good-bye you think.
Dean was grumbling a bit. They were all packed into his Baby, him and Sam in the front seat and Cas and Rowena in the back. Castiel had insisted on bringing that godforsaken bird with him. “I can’t just leave him alone for days, Dean!”
Castiel completely, utterly,
“I know you put other people’s happiness above your own, Dean, every time. No matter what it means for you, you want to make others happy. And, Dean, that’s wonderful. But I’d wish, that sometimes, you’d put your own happiness as a priority.
It feels heavy in your hand.
Jack opens a portal and Dean and Sam step through it, into eternal darkness.
“How’s my favourite tornado?”
“What do you want?”
“Good,” she replies, “the doctor says it’s two.”
“I haven’t gone bowling in forever! Come on!”
“How did it happen?”
, y’know but it’s not – it’s not enough, y’know?
“I know, Dean, but – Cas is gone. Don’t you think he’d want you to be happy?”
“Don’t ever do this again!”
Dean looked up from his thoughts. Wait, Sam just looked that building up? He looked at the spot on the map Edgar was pointing out. It was a lone building that seemingly owned a lot of space. Technically speaking, it made sense. But how the hell would Edgar have known that? And
Part 3! Fair warning: there is brief death in this chapter. I haven't marked it, because it's important, and also because it's the only logical conclusion. But as I said: it is BRIEF.
Sam and Rowena both threw him a
“No. Come on my fingers. Do it now, for me.”
Castiel took his hand and led him into the back office. Dean’s never been there, and it looked like you’d expect. A dim light, a desk with a computer on it, shelves with paper on them and a dingy chair. It didn’t even roll.
What’s Heaven without its best angel?
“I’ll go, too,” Sam says.
Dean looks over to his brother, smiling. There is no story left for them, not ever again. Now, they make sure the book gets a good end. They deserve a soft end, don’t they?
Dean watches them walk away and gets his phone out. He knows that there is a photographer here that films things but he wants that piece for himself. And he has to go up there anyway, so he might just go now anyway.
And now that he thought about that, he wasn’t feeling so funky anymore. What if Cas only agreed to go out with him to make it the worst experience possible, so that Dean would never return and he could finally go back to his normal life before Dean just crashed in and demanded all the attention he wanted?
He’s not alone and he can rely on all these people. They
Dean left his room for the first time in days.
Dean doesn’t really understand but he thinks there’s some truth in that. He can’t be sure however.
You’re afraid to stop your tale, but eventually you must. Your lips are dry and your throat is hollow.
He looked up at her. “I gave Sam and Dean flower crowns to wear. Sam’s was lying on the table when he disappeared. It was missing a flower.”
He looked at the flower. It was purple. From what the site said, purple meant – it meant admiration, respect, dignity and royalty. Dean wasn’t sure if Cas meant royalty, but the others, he smiled. Fuck. He felt mushy now. Not a bad flower, then. He held it into his nose and could barely wait to see Cas later. Hopefully, Cas wouldn’t be wearing a total disaster of an outfit again and even if he did, that – that would only fit him and he’d look perfect anyway.
Castiel nodded, and he even blushed a bit. Dean wanted to hug him and shield him from the world.
The... Edgar... tilted its head. “Name weird. Edgar no care. Edgar here to save Castiel! You help.”
“You’re weird,” Dean says and he knows he should get up and leave.
The boy’s heart wasn’t working. Castiel placed a hand on the kid’s chest and he felt a steady heartbeat. He looked over to Sam. He could see the bullet wound that killed him. And yet he knew if he were to touch that spot he’d find nothing but unblemished skin.
“You tried all you could,” Jack says and Dean thinks he’s a crappy liar.
Cas sighs. “No. I figure being in Heaven would help me. I might be able to get rid of it if I was able to tap into Heaven’s energy reserves, but I don’t want to go there now. The soul Jack made for me is going to suffice until it inevitability runs out.”
“This,” Castiel continued, “is a good sign. They aren’t draining his magic so they most likely want him alive. I wonder what they intend to do with him, though. Maybe they want to whittle him down so that he’ll help them with something?”
Doesn’t he care about them anymore?
Castiel nodded. “These days, I usually just use a bicycle. If I can, I walk. Don’t get me wrong, I
Castiel is quiet for a while. “You don’t like men being with other men?”
Castiel hugged him tight and pressed a kiss on his cheeks. Castiel’s lips felt a bit rough, but fuck, did it feel good. It really didn’t help solve his little
Dean looked at the stack that indeed looked very delicious but Dean still didn’t feel like eating. He looked back at Cas and shook his head. Castiel’s face dropped as he scratched at his cast. “But you really need the food Dean, it’s been days.”
“I hated you, because you ran away.”
But you –
Dean sighed. As much as he loathed the bird, he wasn’t wrong. Rowena and Sam could probably find Cas and Dean
Someone had brought you here. Someone had found you behind that dumpster. You remember seeing stars approaching you.
? First of all, that name sounded absurd. Why not name it something cooler? Now people thought you’d be making letters of all things. How would you be able to afford a building that big in this day and age by producing
“Hey, kid,” a voice woke him early the next day. Castiel blinked the sleep out of his eyes and looked up. An elderly man stood above him, tilting his head to the side. “Why are you sleeping outside?”
“Please come back to me,” Dean whimpers, “I want you with me.”
“It’s okay, buddy. But maybe we should get take-out, hm? I’ll pay.”
Amidst the stars, Castiel smiles.
“I can move on my own now, isn’t that cool?!”
“Let the wish come true, then.”
You think about the light in someone’s eyes and about proving yourself worthy of the stars.
“Jack,” he says and tries to look around.
Dreams were a wonderful thing but it seemed that for angels, dreams were something terrible.
Because he came in later he decided to take his break a little later than usual. He called Sam real quick, just because he felt bad leaving him alone for so long, but then again – Sam wasn’t a kid anymore. Sam was an adult and he could even cook. In reality, he shouldn’t worry or fuss about his brother as much anymore but really, that’d never happen. After that, he called Cas.
Dean sighed. He and Sam raised themselves on TV, so it was hard to imagine not owning one. At least Cas looked like he missed it. He looked over at the bird that had started cleaning itself. “What do you
, Dean?”
“Baby,” Cas says and Eileen smiles at him.
Dean wasn’t quite sure what to do. Hug the man? Kiss him? Drop to his knees, what was he supposed to
Sam laughs and shoves at him. It feels good. Life has to go on. He’s going to be okay. He looks to Eileen who’s making a small
He’d google what an orchid meant and damn the consequences. He’d still have a date with Cas, even if Cas didn’t want him. He opened his phone and took a deep breath. He tapped on the search bar and typed in
...oh. Oh! That had been easy. It took his head a second to
Dean couldn’t move. He could barely breathe and his head was too full and yet absolutely empty.
Dean is sure of it. There is a happy end waiting. What’s a little more work? What’s a little more searching? Sam will get what he deserves. Sam will get the girl and Dean... well, Dean has Miracle. But that’s not important right now. Right now, Sam’s hand is important. If he can provide just a little support to his brother, then he’ll do that.
At least that pest was contained in a cage. Cas had not wanted to put Edgar in a cage, but Dean had insisted. The bird kept staring at Dean from Cas’ lap and cawed at him, specifically. Dean sighed and looked back onto the road.
I’d let a child go. I’d give an old man a few more minutes to say good-bye. I’d save the mother giving birth. I’d do these things and I got punished for them and I’d falter. What if I did something wrong? What if I altered the big plan? What if the ending would never come as it had been planned? And maybe –
“Uncle Dean!”
“What are you worried about?”
“Sammy,” he hisses but Sam is already in position. Dean stays close to Goo who’s heaving a little. Dean doesn’t understand why he wants to protect Goo but he finds he simply has to.
“Maria doesn’t want to walk, she’s embarrassed. Do you think you can help her out?”
“I’m sorry,” he told them just before he left. “I’ll come back, I promise. Wait for me.”
But he can’t.
“He’s still in the back, sweetheart. Be nice to him today, okay? It’s not a good day. But I know he’ll be happy to see you, so why don’t you go say hello?”
That didn’t help. Edgar squeaked quietly and let his head hang. “Took Castiel. The flowers are all lonely now. Who looks after them? Me gone. Castiel gone. Who? Who?”
Castiel sighed and looked around. It smelled horridly but there was little he could do about it. Nora said it was embedded into the walls at this point. Apparently that was just how gas station bathrooms smelled. He didn’t like it. He hated urinating, but he couldn’t get around it.
Somebody made a mess in the bathroom. He knew who it was. There had been a group of girls here. There was vomit all over the floor. He found a positive pregnancy test that he had sold them. The girls had all been around 17 years old. He hoped the pregnant girl was going to be alright.
So he nods.
“Hey,” he says a little softer. “We’re going to get that stuff off of you and then we can talk, like civilised people, yeah?”
“We're all like flowers. We bloom and we wilt, but for as long as we live, we'll bring joy to those around us. And when we are gone, we will be remembered fondly. So don't fret what's been lost, and relish the memory. Flowers will bloom again, and if you come back, I'll be here.”
. The Empty followed you outside and you
, please, please...”
After returning home Sam had put his sunflower next to his Sweet Briar. They were an odd mix, but he liked having them next to his window. He imagined he understood Dean a bit better now. There was still no magic in these flowers but they did seem magical.
George looked at him panicked. He kept switching between his hand and Castiel’s stare and it was evident that he didn’t know what to do. He could end him right now, commit a crime and keep up appearances, or he could walk away. Dean wondered if Cas was
Dean steps away from the window and he can only stare. Jack is here. Why is Jack here
I love you.
Dean isn’t expecting Jack to instantly appear in the room, but – he somehow is. He sighs and turns around to Castiel fully. He’s sleeping peacefully and Dean smiles. He takes Cas’ hand and softly strokes the skin.
There were no more thoughts after this.
Dean chuckles and pulls Cas flush against him. It’s been a while since they were this close together without one of them on literal death’s door. Cas is alive and warm under his hands and Dean starts swaying. He’s never danced a real dance, much less so with another man. But it’s not like Cas could dance at all, so it’s okay. And besides – it’s not about the skill, it’s about the experience. And Cas –
“Really? You really think it’s okay? And – and don’t worry, you can use my penis to pleasure yourself. I won’t mind.”
It felt like all air left his lungs. He looked at the metallic plug and thought about the times it might’ve been inside of Cas’ ass. Fuck. He reached for it. “O – Okay,” he said.
Sam watched him fly away into the back. Somehow, the conversation felt weird. He wasn’t quite sure why, but that bird was smarter than it had any reason to be.
Castiel smiles.
At the end, Jack didn’t show. The party had ended a while ago, but Dean and Castiel are still sitting on a bench outside. It’s a nice night, and Dean doesn’t want to drive home yet. There are no clouds in the sky and the stars are shining bright. Dean reckons that that’s Jack’s doing. He still wishes he would’ve shown his face.
“Don’t fall asleep here, the flowers aren’t blooming here.”
You’re worth everything. You matter so much, Cas – to me, to Sam, to the world. I’m sorry that all of us have fallen short. I’ll make it up to you. I’ll make it up to you for all eternity, because I love you. If you’ll have me for whatever reason, then I’m yours. And I’m never going to let go. If I lose you, I will stop at nothing to find you again.
, faggot.”
The person had reached the fence and looked at them. It was a boy, and he didn’t even seem that old. “Edgar told me I had to press the right button. I’m going to make a hole in the fence now to let you in,” he said in an even tone. Dean instinctively stepped back.
And hey, maybe he could become a godparent to Garth’s Cas. Yes. That is a nice thought.
You tilt your head. You don’t understand.
“Hey,” Dean replies.
“I love you,” Dean says and Cas presses his forehead against Dean’s neck.
Castiel let go of Dean’s hand and maybe it was a trick of the light or something, but Dean could swear that the flowers just piqued up a little at Cas’ presence. The man bent down onto his knees and courteously nodded at the gravestone. Dean didn’t know why this was important to him. He’s never brought anybody here but with Cas it felt – it felt weirdly right.
Dean helped Sam up but then – he helped Castiel down the stairs. Castiel could not stop smiling. Dean was here. Dean cared. Dean had come for him. All these emotions ran through him in rapid fire and he wanted to laugh and cry at the same time. He wanted to hug Dean and touch him and never let him go and life has never been better.
“Of course I like you, Dean. It’s just – look. I don’t like – I don’t like it. What you were trying to do. I don’t like it.”
“Ah, yes, how unfortunate that is.”
One last time.
Castiel smiled and squeezed Dean’s hand. “Thank you, Dean. You saying that means a lot to me. I – I have to go feed Edgar now, before he munches on Marian. They don’t like each other very much. I – call me later?”
Dad was gone. So was Cas. And Edgar was an asshole, but Dean hadn’t known him to be a liar. “Where is the magic house?”
“I can never make it up to you,” Dean says and blinks away the tears. Castiel is silent.
His hands were shaking.
He couldn’t think about the possibility of Sam being dead. The thought alone brought him to his knees. What would he do? Maybe it was good that he brought the gun, after all.
He looked up to her and saw her frown. He didn’t care. They both knew he wouldn’t be able to concentrate until he figured this out one way or another. Rowena sighed and went over to the flowers, picking one up to inspect it. Sam wanted to believe that the flower turned away from her, but again, that was probably just his imagination.
Dean looks up at the sky and extends his hand towards it. “I can see them so clearly, but I’ll never be able to reach them. They’re always going to be a far-away dream that I’ll never get to hold.”
Castiel’s eyes were big and blue and there was the angel he’d always known. The one that’d been with him for so long; that has died for him. He could never be afraid of this Castiel.
Over the line, Sam laughs. “Yes, we’ll bring the dog. We’ll be there in about half an hour. Prepare to hold a crying baby, Dean.”
He couldn’t see a customer in the shop, but he also couldn’t see Castiel anywhere. He pushed the door open and was greeted by the bird again. Edgar was the name of it, wasn’t it? “Hello, Edgar,” he tried and it cawed at him.
Maybe you are good enough, after all.
Dean cut him loose and then touched his body again. It felt so nice. It had never felt so nice before.
Castiel didn’t respond.
“What did you say?”
that praise, but getting it here at work, over the phone, seemed counter-productive.
Sam looks to Dean in utter disbelief and Dean can just smile. “Show us the baby, yeah?”
“My name is Sam.”
“Breathe, Cas.”
“I overheard,” Cas says as he’s rolling out of the back in his wheelchair. On his lap, there are Maria and a big load of balloons.
I love you.
She giggles and hugs him tight.
Cas stops next to the pew where Claire and Kaia are sitting and basically tells Maria to throw flowers on them. Claire laughs and playfully shoves Cas away from them. Jody and Donna are also getting petals thrown in their face. Everybody is smiling and Dean’s happy that he’s filming this.
It’s a nice and warm summer day.
His heart was beating fast and he didn’t even know why. He was a grown-ass adult and he wasn’t a child that needed his brother to approve of his new boyfriend or anything. Dean picked at his shirt and awaited Castiel’s answer. It was important to him that Sam and Cas got along because if they didn’t, then – then what would he do? He really lo-
“Interesting,” he heard Rowena mutter next to him and he didn’t find this interesting at all. Once done, the boy looked up at them and smiled. “Done,” he exclaimed and Dean could only stare.
“Dean! You needed to rest. And you’ll need energy if we’re going to rescue Sam. Do you really want to collapse onto yourself when we get there? So please, eat something, okay?”
“Cas,” Dean sobs and Cas turns around. But he doesn’t look at Dean. Dean wants to go to him and hold him and apologise for himself.
Dean buys a corner lot. It’s very expensive. But he has a dream. He doesn’t want to work construction forever. He deserves to be happy. And Cas is here. Cas is here, and Sam is here, and Eileen is here – and everyone is here.
“Edgar here,” the voice said and It turned only its head this time. There was something sitting on its shoulder. What was that? It wasn’t a person. “Who are you?” It asked and It didn’t know what It should do. It begged The Voice to help It.
Sam punched the candle and it fell to the floor. Stupid thing. He’d done this shit all his life, it wasn’t supposed to be a hard thing!
“Your friend doesn’t have long.”
Sam looked over at him. “You think that maybe he’s got some hair stuck in his hairbrush?”
He wished he wasn’t so much of a fool.
“No. But it’s getting harder to resist.” Castiel turned his head. “It’s also getting harder to resist killing you.”
But he had nothing to offer.
“I’m sure Uncle Dean’s got some inside, sweetheart.”
Sometimes he dreamed that Dean and Sam came by. They smiled at him and called him their friend, their brother. They talked about how they missed him. Castiel was happy but then they left. They just left him here and they drove off.
“I had sex in a car once. It was very uncomfortable. I got kicked in the teeth.”
He looked over at the vase he had in his room. He’s – of course – kept every flower Castiel has given him. There weren’t many yet, since the orchid he got last was only number three, but they were important to him. Of course he didn’t remember what they were called. They were flowers. He got them, was way more focused on the giver than the actual gift and promptly forgot all the words Castiel had spoken about them. It was a shame. He knew flowers had their own language, and that they all meant something, but did he really want to look it up, at least for the orchid? What if they meant “annoyance” or something? He bit his lip.
He puts something in your hand.
“But Cas, seriously, what so we do? We’re just gonna leave it standing?”
“You said something about flowers,” Dean continues.
“Why didn’t you come sooner?” His voice is hoarse and Dean’s glad he didn’t yell. His voice would’ve given out.
Rowena left them then, making her way around the building looking for a back entrance. Dean and Castiel decided to wait until they at least couldn’t see her anymore before they made their way in. Dean’s hand found Castiel’s. “I’m scared,” he whispered and Castiel squeezed his hand reassuringly. “Everything will be fine. Tonight, all of us will be home.”
Dean holds Castiel tight and thankfully, Castiel doesn’t speak.
So naturally, Dean looked up its meaning.
“Attack me. Do it now. What are you waiting for? I will break your friend’s hand.”
Sam looked up. He didn’t know what to respond. He just said, didn’t he? He was worried about failing. He was worried about what Dean and Rowena would say. What would he see in their eyes? He wouldn’t want their pity. He wouldn’t be able to take it if they turned away from him in disgust.
He didn’t understand.
Stupid Dean. Edgar cawed at him irately. At least Castiel was holding his cage tightly.
for a fact that that wasn’t the case. He reached out a finger and gently touched the petals. It almost felt like they preened at the contact. He couldn’t
“But,” Jack then continues and Dean looks up.
“Why me?”
“Dean, you brought me to a bowling alley!”
Cas taking charge like that. And, admittedly, he liked that thought. He could imagine that Cas shoved him onto his bed and was standing over him, looking him over. Dean hoped he’d like what he’d see.
Dean swallowed, but he held Castiel’s stare. “I – I thought of you kneeling between my – between my legs. A – And I thought of you towering over me, telling me what to do.”
Why did he ever turn his back on his brother?
The bird didn’t wait. It flapped its wings and took off over the fence, heading directly towards the building. Dean wasn’t sure about this. But there was little they could do.
Ah. The peasants. He turned his head and looked at them. Pathetic as they were, he remembered them through these eyes. No. One was new. One was different. He wanted to look closer. He wanted to investigate. The fire wanted to devour, but this flame he subdued himself. The new one would have nothing he didn’t already have. Watching would be way more satisfying.
“You seem awfully knowledgeable on this, dear.”
“The flowers are waiting,” the bird said.
Sam was lying on the ground, now.
“Until forever ends,” they said in unison.
The bees are still on Dean’s mind. He doesn’t need a repeat of that.
Their lone journey is over.
But the point is: I went against my orders and every time, I got punished for it. And then I met you, and you went against your orders and I couldn’t see you getting punished. And I thought, maybe you had the right path. Maybe wrong decisions get punished and right decisions do not. So I decided to follow you. I decided to follow the path you were carving.
“Who’s there?” he asks but Dean’s fading away.
He still couldn’t fully grasp it.
“Dean.”
Dean wonders, and watches the leaves.
How could he say that? But Dean knows. Dean knows that this is what he’s been like. And Cas, good, pure Cas, just took it all. How could he do that? How could he treat Cas this way? Why did Cas ever come back? Why –
Something’s changed. It could feel the shift in the air. The feeling in its head was strong. The pull was almost stronger. It looked from The Door to The Window. There were no new tasks, nothing new to do. They haven’t forgotten about It, they never did. But being ignored for that long was odd. It wondered if that had anything to do with the feeling in its head.
body. It had still been Jimmy’s. But now it was just him. Now he was trapped inside this body forever where before he would have always been able to simply leave the vessel behind and move on. He didn’t want to say he felt trapped, but maybe that was what it was?
“Edgar no want to go.”
He saw Lisa a few days ago. He’s seen her holding hands with some fellow he’s never seen before. So in conclusion, she
“Yeah, yeah, you stupid bird. Let the grown-ups think,” Dean replied and didn’t pay the bird any further mind. They could probably find out if Dad had been employed someplace this past year. Cas would be fine until they found him, right?
Castiel blushed a bit. “It’s just fascinating, is all. Anyway, thank you for inviting me over.”
Yes... he’d be fine now, after killing all these people. It didn’t matter if they deserved this. It mattered that there was no remorse in Castiel’s heart after the act. Castiel left the room and Dean, having his head hung low, followed him. There was nothing else to do.
The man drove off in a small car with no backseat.
He turned around and looked at Cas who was sitting at the kitchen table. He was armed with Edgar on his shoulder for whatever reason. The bird didn’t look too happy either. His feathers were all puffed up and he looked as prissy as a bird could look like. It reminded Dean of his morning self if coffee was unavailable. Edgar’s eyes zoomed in on Dean’s coffee. A second, nothing happened. And then the attack started.
He went back to the bathroom. He kept mopping. He’d never get the room clean but he was determined to try. Nora was always relieved when somebody cleaned the bathroom. If he got it as clean as humanly possible, she might even be proud of him.
Edgar wanted to flap his wings, to tell him
Dean stretches and looks around. The park is definitely more filled up now, but it doesn’t seem like anyone is paying him much attention. But also – the guy isn’t here. Somehow, Dean is disappointed.
(also, Prince Dean is supposed to be a real minx who not only sleeps around with any man or woman who so much as looks at him, but he also has used his elusive beauty to kill many an opponent of his father’s and to drive anyone who dares not to agree right away to insanity)
Dean notices how two of his fellow temple servants glance towards him, their mouths curved upwards into mocking smiles and their fingers doing downwards motions on their cheeks, indicating the tears that Dean only now feels rolling down his face; they must think that he cries in fear of the mountain quaking. Even though Dean thought he had lost the ability for it long ago, he is newly vulnerable now and feels a sharp spike of shame in his chest, making him wish that the mountain would break in two and swallow him whole, finally end his miserable existence.
“Dean,” Castiel admonishes him. He is well-aware of the inner distress Dean has carried with him for more than a week now, as much as he is of the societal concept of masculinity according to which Dean denies himself certain red and pink hues and bright colours and various other things. But both of these issues are Dean’s issues; they are not to burden or hurt Castiel with. Which Dean must know, too, because as soon as Castiel admonishes him, he sheepishly blinks away and moves his mouth as if to mumble out something, maybe an embarrassed apology, but nothing comes out.
“I apologize,” Castiel sighs, and Dean can hear his resignation. He still doesn’t shove Dean off or runs harsh hands over Dean’s butt to punish him for his insolence. Instead, he presses his lips to Dean’s throat, to where the marks are, and asks quietly, “Is this still alright?”
He looks like he usually does, albeit maybe a bit more kempt than when Dean saw him a couple of hours before. Even though they had been seeing each other occasionally throughout the day and even had a small meeting where they talked shop about another upcoming deal that Novak wants to do with Dean, they didn’t finish work at the same time. As both knew already, Novak had a short day today, and Dean, as a proper personal assistant, had to stay longer and still organize whatever there was to organize before the weekend. So, he came straight from Sandover to the Roadhouse, only having had the chance to freshen himself up a little in the company’s bathroom. Novak, though, looks like he’s come straight out of a shower or beauty parlor or fashion magazine.
His breath shudders against Dean’s mouth and cheek and Dean presses his eyes closed for just a second. “If you enjoyed it as much as you seemed to, I would adore being granted the honor of doing this again eventually. I wish to touch and see you like this again. If you do not wish the same, then I can assure you that even the mere memory of this will be enough to last me a lifetime.”
That’s the difference Dean has clung to, deeply believed in despite it all. Hoping that Castiel will return to him, regardless of how he was never truly gone. Knowing that he would come to fix it. And he did – Dean’s faith in him was not for nothing. His lack of presence was not a lack of care, after all.
Dean can’t help but moan again, louder this time, and he almost moves, disobeys the order he has been given. But he doesn’t, which Castiel must have noticed, because he keeps looking at him all pleased and keeps his hand over Dean’s cock, then puts a little more pressure on it, rubs it tormentingly sweetly.
“I understand. Would you like anything to eat as well?”
It’s a good thing that Castiel’s hand are so steady on him, holding his hips and the rest of his body in place. Because without a doubt, Dean would otherwise be tempted to squirm and writhe and thrust his hips up towards where it’s so warm and tight for him, where his Dominant takes care of him with glazed and attentive blue eyes.
In the end, Dean just nods, his hair brushing against Castiel’s cheek. Because yes, he might not be deserving of all this, but despite being aware of it, he is
you. Every night and every day, bringing you right towards the edge and letting you take that last step across it, Until you have mastered to do this by yourself. Until you have learned, with tears in your eyes and an aching cock, that it is only
“Do what?” Castiel asks elaborately, too taken in by this beautiful creature on top of him to listen too closely, or at all.
Dean wants to curl up and cry or scratch all around his neck or kick Roche in the shin, but most of all, he wants to go home.
“I want you like this,” Dean whispers, sweeping Castiel with relief, “I want you here.”
The clock in the kitchen ticks on for a handful of seconds, Dean’s shame growing with each of them. He thinks of how Castiel wanted to give him space and still slept with him when he asked him to, and how this is the immediate reward Castiel gets for it. A brat wearing his clothes, rummaging through his kitchen, eating his toast, and sassing him because he’s too proud to accept his coffee on top of all that.
“So you made an exception for
“And if it happens too often, what then? Will you just blow the whole thing off?”
Castiel, picking up on Dean’s trembling and his struggling, complacently clenches around him.
Maybe there’s no comfort to be found in the act of bathing itself; but it’s to be found in Castiel.
Castiel’s gaze seems like he wants to share in on Dean’s humour, but can’t quite bring himself to do so yet, not before he has said whatever he thinks needs saying.
“Dean,” Castiel moans, apparently satisfied with the view and the offer, and he thrusts his still trapped erection up against Dean’s belly and pubic bone, making him moan even more.
who came before him.
Dean doesn’t even make the conscious decision to move when his lips are already smashed against Castiel’s and his hands are clinging to his dress shirt, pulling him closer, into his body, over it. So that the whole of Castiel’s is pressing into him as they struggle and rut and try to find a position that works.
“I hope so. But you know that if you don’t feel entirely well – physically as well as mentally – I trust you to tell me.”
Not that Dean particularly cares right now. He feels to good to think too much on anything, just snuggles into the couch and yawns out of sheer comfort. Then thinks about the food again and then his thoughts drift to how kind Castiel is and how nice it to just be here and be taken care of and relax and yeah. It’s just really nice. Really, really nice.
and nothing has happened. Nothing bad, that is. All that occurred was that Dean was warm and comfy between his brother and his protector, and that he got a good night’s sleep. One of which he didn’t have many lately. Maybe not in years, even. Maybe ever since he didn’t have anyone to watch over him while he slept – but instead had someone he has had to watch over.
Dean could see Castiel turning his face towards him, the light from the hallway briefly catching in his eyes.
How is it that Dean seems to forget the feeling of this time and time again? That that overwhelming happiness appears to be a mere dream once it’s ebbed away, and when it returns, it’s all the more powerful for it?
to accept it, so unnatural for him. And yet, at the same time, there’s too many kind words anyway that he would have to object to -- it would be exhausting to think about why each and every one couldn’t possibly be right, in the same way that it would be impossible to find reasons for why Castiel shouldn’t rightfully keep doing what he’s doing then. All those arguments for why Dean doesn’t deserve this.
“I could feel you enjoying your fantasy, Dean.” He presses down with his hips, making his point by elicit a noticeable twitch out of Dean’s erection. “And it does make me wonder what it might have been about. Maybe about something that I am not doing that you would want me to do? Something that I would be happy to give to you if you only ask?”
Dean rubs his hand over the warm skin of his neck. “Both of them were good, but… with you, that’s also good. Better.” He clears his throat.
No, you should just leave now, while he is gone.
“The magic house!”
she wouldn’t care about that information on a sub-human level.
Edgar... a name. That was a name. “I... my name is Subject 1805.”
“The flower you gave me,” he says, “it’s wilting.”
Dean, please save me.
He did understand how uncomfortable urinating was and yes, he’d much prefer it if it didn’t need to happen, but it couldn’t be so difficult to hit the bowl at least, right? After all, they all had a lifetime of training and if
kind of weird but should he really make that step?
happy, and that’s why they stayed alive. Sam couldn’t really believe it. He sighed, and then he heard the door unlock. He checked the time real quick, but it was too early to be Dean. He told Rowena she didn’t need to come today, since they’d be having a guest later – and he could really use a break. Maybe Dean was early. He got up and left his room, just to see Rowena standing in the living room.
“Jack said that you told him all about the stars,” Dean says and you nod.
Castiel looked at the ground. Some of the tiles were cracked. He’d never really seen the bathrooms in the bunker. He hadn’t looked at the tiles. He wondered what colour they would be. If he just knew how to fix them, he would do it. Nora would be grateful for that, wouldn’t she?
Damn, now Dean’s blushing.
Dean closed his eyes, took a deep breath – something he had to do a lot lately – and left the safety of his car. He went over to the door and looked for the name “Novak” to ring the bell. He stuffed his hands in his pockets and hoped the sweat on them would just disappear.
He knows what she wants.
“I can open a portal to the Empty and protect you while you’re in it. But you have to find Cas; and you have to convince him to leave. He has to
it says.
He didn’t know why. He dragged himself over his brother’s body and looked down at him. Sam.
If you had been there to call the nurses, would he still be alive?
“Did I allow you to touch?”
“Do I get a good-night kiss?”
There’s a gentle hand on your shoulder and you jump a little. You turn your head and there is Sam, looking at you. He looks concerned. Why? What have you done wrong? Sam’s opening his mouth. He’s going to tell you that you’re not worth talking to. He’s going to tell you that they regret saving you.
The Father opened the door to his cage and grabbed Edgar in his hand. Edgar screeched. Only Castiel was allowed to hold him like that! What did this man think?! He tried to wiggle out of the grasp but in the end he was just a bird. He tried biting the hand but it had no effect. So he screeched again. Castiel would come. Castiel always came.
The thing’s head droops a little and Dean finds it very endearing. It looks almost like a head tilt. “Okay, so,” he starts but then there are noises outside. Dean realises instantly that more monsters have come.
Dean doesn’t want to hunt anymore. He doesn’t want to go chasing after the monsters anymore.
After two hours at work, he took his phone and secretly took a photo – not of his dick, but of his hips, just to prove to Castiel that he had followed the order. It made him weirdly excited, like he was doing something forbidden.
Castiel tears his eyes open and he’s gasping for air, heaving dryly. Dean chokes down a sob, but Castiel grabs his own chest as if he’s struggling to breathe and his blue eyes fly to Jack. The kid just shakes his head and takes Castiel’s hand in his own.
She’d never asked where he came from. He was glad for it because he wouldn’t have known how to answer her. A place far, far away. A place that no longer belonged to him. He wondered if the angels were still hunting him. He wondered what they would do when they found him. Would they kill him on the spot? Would they torture him first? What would they do when they realised he had no answers for them? Would they believe him when he’d tell them that Metatron tricked him as well?
“So to locate Castiel, we first need a piece of Castiel.”
“How close are you?”
“Sam?”
You want Jack to look at you like he always does.
Maria yells as soon as she spots her uncle and throws herself at his middle from across the room. Dean laughs and catches her. He lifts her up and holds her on his hip.
Their hunting days are finally over.
Cas, please. Come back to me.
“Follow your heart,” Sam says and Dean isn’t sure if he can do that. Cas. He wants Cas. Cas always comes back to him. He can do it this once. He can find Cas, just this once when it matters.
Later, at the party, Dean holds an embarrassing speech about Sam and after, Sam dunks his head into a pie. This is fair, because Dean definitely deserves that. It’s all good, though. Cas laughs and wipes Dean’s face clean and Maria – still in Cas’ lap – giggles like it’s Christmas.
“Dean,” came a voice from the door.
Maybe you deserve them.
“You’re broken beyond repair, Castiel. I don’t even know what’s still holding you together.”
, the stars whispered to me,
He blinked awake and at first it was hard to see. The lights were all off. The owner of the voice turned on a little kitchen light and Edgar saw that it was The Father. What was he doing here; in the middle of the night? Edgar cawed at him, demanding answers.
He thought about the baby.
, to be honest.
“No. Babies don’t use words like we do; it’s more of a... sense. A feeling if you will. They can’t think in complete sentences yet. It’s along the lines of
“I’ve met Bell and Leah and they’ve told me what you did for them.”
“Cas, fuck.”
He heard the chair being moved and then Castiel sat in front of him.
of them. So many emotions in his head, all flinging themselves around, yearning for attention and he got overwhelmed.  He just didn’t know what to do with them.
Castiel’s flowers were all so pretty. He didn’t know their names from left to right and he really wasn’t into flowers at all but – they were hella pretty. He heard a squeak coming from the side and he looked up.
It was looming over him. He even had nightmares about that stupid exam. And he really wanted to ace it – if he did, he wouldn’t have to worry again. He really wanted to become a lawyer for those with magic. They were so easy to blame, and so many times without cause – they’ve just had the misfortune to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. They’d get prosecuted, and everybody would be happy about it and nobody would care about the truth. He wanted to help. He wanted to bring the truth out – magic shouldn’t demonise you. But if he failed that exam –
Castiel had to look after them.
Dean drops his head forward slowly until he comes to rest on the man’s shoulder. He doesn’t know why he’s allowed to do this. But it’s nice, it’s so nice.
Miracle whines and tries to cheer him up. Dean laughs a little.
“Know anything about that monster-killer?”
Sam wandered into Dean’s room after he was gone. He usually did so to collect dirty laundry from the floor or the chair because once it’s on the chair; it’s dirty laundry. Dean insisted you could wear one pair of underwear four times, but Sam didn’t really agree with that – it was really gross. They had a washing machine, so why shouldn’t they use it?
to meet this Castiel, no arguments.”
“Dean, you’re doing great. What you’re going through – what you both are going through – is extremely stressful. I can’t even imagine. I can’t imagine all the hurdles you had to go through to get here. How scary it has to be to wake at night and see Cas being sick again. I’m proud of you, Dean. I really am. You’re holding it together so well and if – if you ever have to break, I’m here for you. We’re all here for you. You’re not alone. You’re never alone, Dean.”
He didn’t want to say goodbye. He was fidgeting with the steering wheel. He wished Castiel could have stayed over, but with Sam there it might not have been the best idea. “I,“ he started when Castiel slid onto his lap.
He can even hear the birds, he thinks.
Fuck. Fuck, he wanted to come, but he wasn’t allowed to. Dean rolled over and shifted uncomfortably. But he could do it. It wouldn’t be the first time he went to sleep with a raging boner.
“Will you tell me where we’re going?”
“Let’s leave this place. Jack, I – I will explain everything to you. Come.”
something about you,” Rowena said and Castiel glanced at her rather briefly. He nodded. “I suspect you have questions. Alas, it might be best if we do not discuss them here.” Rowena nodded in agreement.
“Good day, Mr. Winchester,” they greeted him and pointed at a chair he could sit in. He sat down and nodded at them. Sam took a deep breath and after introductions, they were ready to start.
They crept closer and they paid close attention to what they were stepping on. Well, Castiel did at least because Dean couldn’t tear his gaze from his brother. There was a hole in the roof right above him. It engulfed him in light and Dean was too worried to think that they might’ve been set up.
Sam just nodded his head, but he didn’t know what to do with this information. The candle kept drawing his interest and he just couldn’t help himself. The flame was perfect and unexplainable, Sam was upset. It wasn’t Castiel’s fault, but he kind of wanted it to be.
His hands are shaking.
“What is it?”
“Edgar has feeling in his chest. Cas here. Edgar knows.”
rode that dick like a damn cowboy? He could wear his Stetson and cowboy boots. Fuck. Fuck fuck fuck.
But that’s not it, you know? There’s nobody else.
“Cas is alive,” Dean says because he thinks that maybe Sam didn’t hear him properly the first time.
Dean whipped his head around. There Castiel sat, with his big blue eyes, all innocent as if he hadn’t just thrown out such a whammy.
Some stars tell me of the end; and others tell me of the start. Maybe some tell me of the middle. And maybe some tell me of all, and all I get is the light in the void at the start.
As he left the flowers extended themselves as much as they could just so to see him walk away a little longer.
“For him, I’ll do anything.”
Sam nodded and Castiel almost jumped him. “Wonderful! Let’s go, let’s go now! Oh – I don’t have a car. Let’s take the train. Assuming that we’re going anywhere other than your house. Are we going somewhere?”
“Dean, you
Dean didn’t want to speak ill of his dad. It was
Dean just nodded, and Sam huffed out a laugh. It seemed the “long and short” was really just a short and simple story.
Slowly he dragged himself forwards. He couldn’t feel the ground beneath his hand. The pain in his leg was gone, the stain on his jeans just a distant memory.
“Cas,” Dean cries and Sam’s hands on his shoulder don’t help at all.
“Cas, what about the bird?”
He and Rowena left and started to make their way to “Love Flowers.” It wasn’t that long of a walk, even if Rowena wanted to be dramatic and walked as slowly as humanly possible. Sam threw her a bitch-face which she pretended not to see.
“Jack.”
“It’s okay,” he says. He wonders if Cas had felt just as hollow whenever he had to tell himself that it was okay. He can’t ever make it up to Cas. Dean’s had the most pure being just within arm’s reach and he’s fucked up.
He pets Castiel’s hair and whispers sweet nothings into his ear. Cas never responds and Dean cries in his damp hair. What’s he supposed to do? He can barely eat food himself. The only thing keeping him from breaking down completely is Miracle because she’ll remind him of feeding her and walking her and honestly, Dean is glad for the temporary distraction she provides.
It had made you feel like you deserved to live.
But then Dean blinks and Cas is gone.
Truth be told, Dean shuffled more than he walked. He wasn’t sure what was happening. Part of him wanted to grab Cas and keep kissing him, and another part yelled at him that he was going too fast. And the worst part was he understood both sides.
Sam nods.
For Edgar’s sake and their own, he hoped that there be a nice big red button. And that this button was located right next to Edgar’s entry-point.
Dean sits up and looks around.
“The soul,” Jack starts, “will help. But Dean, you have to understand that when Castiel made it out of the Empty, he took death with him. It’s not going to let him go. The – the sheer might it must’ve taken him to survive as long as he did, I...”
to meet him.
Dean thinks he can see the light that Castiel spoke about.
“He needs
“You know, I haven’t gotten a flower from you in a while.”
It’s the most comforting silence and Dean cherishes it.
feel better. So he moved into the kitchen. He probably wouldn’t make something big but a sandwich would be good too, right?
His angel will always catch him.
Most likely, it would die.
Sam bit said lips. His glass was also still full; he knew his lie was weak. “It’s about tomorrow.”
“You’re being so good for me.”
told Jack hospitals were for sick people. But still, how did you actually manage to get here? Did Jack crawl up to the street and got someone to help him? That must be it, you think. So you should really thank him the next time you wake up. Right now, you don’t want to wake him. The way you know Jack, he’s been awake as long as he could possibly manage just to watch over you. He shouldn’t do that, you think. He’s a child; he needs to sleep. You sigh and look back up to the roof. You try to avoid looking at the door. You glance to the other side – some part of you expected to see Mr. Edgar being there, guarding the window. But there is no one there – so technically, the window belongs to you. It feels wrong to have it. Still, you stare in its direction. You idly wonder about Mr. Edgar. He went home, of course. You wonder if he sleeps next to the window at home. What did he think about you? He probably thought you were a moron. A moron in love, that is. You remember him being worried about you. It is good he got to go home. You just wished he’d have said good-bye. It was very sudden, losing him like that. But, he’s got to be happy now, being back together with his son. Jack shifts against your arm and drools on you, and you think Mr. Edgar felt the same. You’re happy. Jack is here. Jack loves you. You love Jack. You turn your head back to him and close your eyes. As long as he gets to stay with you, you can be happy. And if they want to take him away – you’re just going to take him and run far, far away.
“Listen here you little shit...”
“Dean,” and fuck his voice was too deep to think. “I have a proposition. You come now, and it’ll be over. Or,” Dean’s breath hitched, “you don’t. You don’t wear underwear tomorrow, you go to work, and then you visit me at my shop. What do you say?”
Castiel beamed at him and then swished his coat a bit, clearly to show it off. “Thank you!” he laughed. “I really like this coat!” He seemed to remember something then, and reached into his pocket.
Sam could only stare. Rowena had said kind of the same thing to him, that he was the master of his magic, but it felt different, now. He looked down. It was a good, clean fire. It didn’t even scorch the places around it.
He was pointing at Sam.
They waited. He said he’d come back.
“You will not. But shall you lose it regardless, don’t fret. It’ll come back here, and I’ll come back to you.”
Dean would probably know so many things.
In the rear-view mirror, he saw Rowena shake her head.
What if he’s still lost even now? Dean’s breathing becomes erratic. He hasn’t talked to Sam in a while, so what – what if Sam just doesn’t remember him at all? What if Sam is happy that Dean’s lost in the forest? What if they’re having a family gathering right now, while he’s here and they don’t even think about him –?
So mote it be.
He had simply wanted to talk about Jack.
“Hmmm. Well then, Dean. What shall I do with you? Perhaps you’d like to hear about the time I had sex in a car?”
Cas has nightmares sometimes and Dean sleeps on the couch.
“Cas,” he moaned and Castiel pressed his hand over his mouth. Fuck. Fuck. He started licking the hand presented to him which just earned him another slap and fuck, he was so
So even when I’m gone, remember that, please.
I’m here now. And once I’m – once I’m better, I’ll be on my way. I’ll find something to do. I’ll find a place where I can be useful but until I’m strong enough for that – maybe it’s okay if I stay a little bit longer?”
Dean bows his head.
“Can I stay tonight?”
So he says: “I don’t want you to go.”
There’s hope for a future in his heart and for the first time, he’s not afraid of it. Things will get better and they’ll start getting better now.
He will be.
Cas’ hair is brushing against Dean’s chin and he feels calm. He gently puts one hand on Castiel’s cheek and Cas nuzzles into it. Castiel’s hand is loosely laying on Dean’s chest and the volume of the TV playing in the background is already fading away.
Cas made it to the couch when Sam and Eileen arrive. As per Sam’s promise, Maria is crying her heart out and Dean feels sorry for Sam. Eileen, God bless her, probably doesn’t hear the crying too much. Dean guesses it’s Sam who gets up in the middle of the night, judging by his face. Dean grins and bends down to greet Miracle. Man, he’s missed her.
“I love you,” Castiel says and Dean laughs with a broken cry.
“Dean,
Dean pressed his legs together, in a desperate attempt to withhold his arousal. Did he want Cas to fuck him? A small part recoiled at the mere thought, but a bigger part said yes.
“Flowers bloom and flowers wilt,” the man says, “but as long as you remember them, they’re never going to be gone.”
Eileen walks right over and plops herself and her baby next to him. “Your niece,” she says and Cas smiles at the baby who stopped crying when she spotted Cas.
It took everything Dean had in him to not start running towards him but he managed.
“Wha – What’s that?”
“Dean,” is all that Cas says afterwards but Dean quietly hushes him.
“I’m not his friend,” Cas says and Dean’s breath hitches hard.
I can do this!”
He can’t.
Dean couldn’t. He wanted to take a hammer and bash the wall in. He needed to find a way into the Empty, find Cas. But he couldn’t. Cas was gone. How was Dean supposed to march on? How was he supposed to fight God if there’d be no reward at the end? If there was no Cas, then what was the point?
It takes ten hours, but then Dean officially becomes an uncle. Castiel had been asleep for a good amount of time, but at least he hasn’t coughed again. Of course, Dean is a bit worried about the sleeping but he’ll figure that out. All that matters is that he’s got Cas by his side and that he’s now got a little baby girl to spoil.
But the Sweet Briar reacted to nothing Sam did. By all accounts, it was just a flower. A pretty flower, for sure, but in the end, just a flower. He petted the petals, he had a feeling the flower liked that.
The boy turns and smiles at him. “Hello. I’m Subject 1805. You’re Castiel, right? These people and Edgar were really looking for you!”
You’re my father, Cas. Sam and Dean are so, so important to me, but – I’d pick you, every time. Now and forever, I will always pick you.”
Fred was wiggling in his grasp, but Castiel didn’t let go. His voice was so different than before.
He was home.
They left and Castiel watched as they drove away. Chances were he’d never see them again.
“I’ll have to thank her as well, then.”
You look down in your lap. What is the point thinking about it? Mr. Edgar is not here anymore. You feel sorry for his son.
But, ah well, it might be best to cross that bridge when they’d get there.
The Voice was calm and soothing. It blinked and took a deep breath. It was okay. It could push open The Door and leave. The Voice was somewhere behind The Door and It was going to find its owner now. It steadied its shoulders and forced The Door open.
“We’ll see,” Dean replies and they both know that nothing will come of it.
“You can’t go now?”
Quietly, someone whispered with the wind.
A long time ago, he believed that all monsters were evil. But he’d been wrong. They were also just trying to survive. If they were good, they got to live. And if they were bad, they got dead. If one would look at it from this angle, it wouldn’t be that complicated at all.
Dean let Rowena go and exhaled deep. “Yeah... yeah, you’re right. Sorry,” he said to nobody in particular.  He turned back to the table and sat in front of Castiel’s pancakes. “But we’re leaving right after I eat, capische?”
“Goodbye, Dean.”
He tried to see a world after there was fire in the water.
Behind the angel, there is a massive tree.
“I wanted it to be over.
“Why isn’t it safe without them?”
There was a beating in its chest and It was afraid. It clenched its eyes shut. Someone please come and help It. It didn’t know what It was afraid of in the first place.
“I think about tearing your arms off, to hear you scream. I think about ripping your legs off and tie them together.”
Dean took his other hand and Castiel knew he didn’t deserve that either.
“And I’m not supposed to feel,” Castiel says and Dean is getting closer.
“Then sleep well now. I’ll see you tomorrow.” And then he hung up.
“Did you feel anything,” he asked Rowena in a low tone and she shook her head.
At nine am, he opened the store.
And yet  – it wasn’t dead.
Sam was gone and it was his fault.
is officially opening today.
Dean gripped the steering wheel tight. He didn’t know what he was supposed to think about that.
“It was nice today,” Castiel said and smiled. Dean just nodded. “And, you know, if you change your mind, regarding sex, then – I’d understand. I wouldn’t ask you to give up that intimacy just because I’m weird.”
Dean pulled up his pants and put his belt back into place. He hoped he didn’t look too ruffled even though it didn’t really matter. Cas was smoking hot and Sam was old enough to understand that sort of stuff.
It’s a quiet kiss, one that doesn’t require anything.
Sam couldn’t say anything – it was the man from the flower shop. The same man that had given him the Sweet Briar stood there, loosely holding Dean’s hand and smiling at him.
love to win. I can’t get it. But you can. So we’ll find Eileen. And we won’t stop until we’ve found her. And then you’ll tell her that you love her and love
“Edgar see Dean kiss Castiel.”
“Freedom,” Sam says. “What do we do with it?”
But then the man began to cough and stand back up.
“What, Sam? We fix this, this is what we gotta do!
“I love you,” he whispers again and again and maybe, just maybe, Cas moves his head every time he says it.
“We barely made it to his car before he ripped my clothes off and shoved me into the backseat. He wanted to be on top, of course, but I didn’t let him.”
He turns around.
? What... what was that black goo?”
Castiel nodded. “Then step away, Dean.”
It was the last time he’d hear these words and it
Let the fire consume so the flame can be fed.
It was a nightmare.
“Do it.”
“Everything.”
“I’m fine,” Cas says every time and Dean wants to believe him.
“What if – what if I got lost? What if they never looked for me? What if they were better off without me?”
“Sam,” Castiel said and Sam sat back a bit to see into his friend’s face. The man was smiling. “Look,” he said and there was a small flame in his hand. How did it get there? Did he give Castiel magic without remembering it? It had a weird feel to it. It flickered in the pale light coming from the kitchen counter.
The two men cackled even more, until Castiel grabbed one of their wrists and yanked the man forward, hard.
You look towards the door.
, that was too much. It didn’t help that he saw himself standing in the train car, his sex toy fucking him into oblivion, and Castiel’s dark eyes watching him. He didn’t need to hear his deep voice saying “now” and Dean having a fucking orgasm in a full car of people like a wanton whore.
“I hated you, you know,” he says and you clench your jaw. You want to withdraw your hand and curl up on yourself but Dean doesn’t let go. You know you deserve it. You deserve to be hated by Dean. It’s what Dream-Dean kept telling you. You deserve to be hated. But maybe – if Dean is able to let it all out now, then maybe he can move on with his life. He can move on, forget you ever existed and marry his girlfriend and have children with her.
And yet, the candle remained unlit.
. And that was not somewhere he wanted to be.
“Give me your number,” Dean demanded because he
“You’re fucking stupid, you know that? So, you don’t like sex. Alright. And yeah, it’s weird to me ‘cause I like it. But just ‘cause I like something, doesn’t mean you have to like it as well. You should’ve told me, Cas. The – what you did to me. That was okay for you, wasn’t it?” Castiel nodded, silent.
And yet, Dean knows that Cas wonders.
or some shit, Dean would personally put that animal into a blender.
Even without permission, Dean took initiative. He wrapped his arms around Castiel, and manoeuvred them out of the car. He didn’t even remember if he locked Baby up because he was way too occupied with the man in his arms. Castiel’s legs were slung around his hips and there was kissing and somehow, Dean got the house keys in his hands as they stumbled up the stairs. Was the bird somewhere? Probably, but Dean couldn’t find it in himself to care.
Castiel caressed his face and Sam felt tired all of a sudden. “I...” he tried to say but he didn’t even know what he had wanted to say at all. His eyelids were heavy.
He wanted to be with Dean.
“Let’s go, then,” he said instead. He hadn’t been ready to believe the bird a minute ago, but somehow that had changed. He didn’t know why. But if Edgar said that Cas was in this
“Flip over,” Castiel commanded and Dean followed. He raised his hips in anticipation and was rewarded with Castiel patting his behind. He unbuckled Dean’s belt and used it to tie Dean’s wrists. They both knew Dean could get out of the makeshift restraint, but it was about the symbolism. Dean was extremely eager already and nothing’s even happened. Castiel opened Dean’s pants and pulled them down to his knees, alongside his underwear.
In his first night as a human, he had cried. He had wept tears because he had been so overwhelmed. How was he supposed to cope with this? How did Dean do it? How did Dean live with all these emotions inside his head? Was it just practice? It had been so easy as an angel. Any emotion he’s had, he could just sort of repress and put somewhere else and – they’ve been so much weaker. Maybe his grace had helped with dealing with these emotions.
“Sorry about that, Dean. I told him to not say that anymore.”
Edgar just chirped quietly. Dean looked at the undisturbed bed again. It’s true that Dad and Cas hadn’t really talked and Cas
For some reason he hoped it wasn’t.
Dean would’ve probably found a better job than this.
The crystal hums in Dean’s hand. It’s a familiar tune.
And he sent the fire forth.
They hung up. His heart still beat a rapid rhythm in his ears and he took a few deep breaths to calm himself down. He hadn’t been that nervous asking someone to go to prom with him and he hoped that that meant something good. He’d talk to Sam after he came home. They could get take-out, some Chinese maybe. He just hoped that Rowena wouldn’t stick around for it – she had in the past and she always
He’s human. He can be with Dean. He could feel all these emotions now, just like Dean. He was a man now, not an angel. There wouldn’t be this barrier between them anymore.
“Unless we find Sammy, I’m not in the mood for eating.”
“Sorry pal, but I don’t even know you.”
It’s a nice day to be alive.
“Sam!”
“Yeah! Who’s to say you’re not just gonna run off with my things?!”
“Hold the fuck on who the hell are you?”
“We don’t know if they have weapons,” Castiel said and Rowena nodded. “I have a gun,” Dean replied as if that would count as a counterargument.
I know you never had faith in me, but I had faith in you and – I never really stopped. People getting to choose their own lives, their own destinies, their own ends – it just had never been in the cards. Everything had always served a bigger plan; always aiming to getting closer to the one true end when there was so much more.
They snuggled on the bed, munching away at the rest of their pizza. Edgar had tried to beg for some – even going so far as to attack the crust – but ultimately, Castiel had managed to shoo the bird back into his cage.
“Help me,” It whispered to no one.
Castiel shakes his head. “Not... not anymore. I. I fix. I. Take. I...,” he closes his eyes in strain. “It’s gone now. They. Would. They would not have. Noticed. It’s small. But I. I took it.” His voice sounds like it pains him greatly. He slumps in his chair a bit but holds Maria tight.
Eileen will wait. She’ll wait forever for Sam.
“It will help Cas to battle the goo inside of him. The Empty has no dominion over souls, you know?”
Castiel looked at Edgar. He didn’t know. Did this man really trust him to take care of something, even if he had no magic and therefore would forever be a useless member of society? He looked at the flowers again. He took a step closer and bent down to the first one in the row: “Do you trust me to take care of you?”
At night, Dean lies next to Goo. He’s holding Goo’s hand as much as he can and he sleeps. He’s never got to sleep in the same bed as Cas before. He wishes that they would’ve had more opportunities before but it was too late now.
Castiel was quiet for a while, then he said: “Have you ever been fucked, Dean?”
The man didn’t wait, and simply presented Sam with one.
“Very well done, Mr. Winchester. Now, one more test and then we’re done.” Mr. Menning placed a glass of water on the table. “We want you to create fire at the bottom of the glass.”
“They didn’t really talk,” Castiel said, “it’s more of a telepathic link. Sam was giving rough information. Imagine it as if you were looking through someone’s eyes. It’s relatively hard to uphold as it requires both parties to be completely focused. Also we believe that Sam was handcuffed and cut off from his magic source.”
His chest hurt.
He closed the store at five am. He’d open it again at nine am. It was roughly four hours of sleep and Nora had called him insane. He had insisted on taking these shifts. He couldn’t let anyone find his sleeping bag. What would they say?
Castiel smiled and made room for Dean, who returned with more drinks than he should be able to carry. He bumped against Castiel a bit too heavily if Sam was any judge of it. His brother was starting to lose the flower crown on his head and he was probably drunkest of the three of them. It looked like they’d be walking home or taking a cab.
And so mote it be.
And together they left the building.
First, nothing happens and Dean wants to panic. He looks at Jack who’s frowning.
. Castiel couldn’t believe it. He couldn’t really breathe so he just shook his head. Dean was so...
“Sam got me a wheelchair, isn’t that awesome?”
The man tilted his head and blinked. “Oh. Hm. I don’t know. I’ve had customers return here, simply to tell me the flowers they bought six months ago were still as beautiful as ever. So... a long time, I think?”
They give Cas an infusion. Sam asks if Dean can get one too but he refuses. He’s fine. He doesn’t need any help. He just wants to sit here, next to Cas and be with him until the very end. Just like last time. Dean reaches for Cas’ hand and holds it loosely in his own.
“Don’t worry, Dean. I’ll watch over you.”
I know you’re going to blame yourself for that. I know that you’re going to tell people that you must’ve done something wrong and that that’s why I left. And in the back of your head – you’ll wonder if maybe you weren’t good enough. That maybe I’ve found someone better than you, someone who’s worth my time.
know. Cas here. I can feel it. Dean, help. I will not lose him again. Help.”
. Not just his soul, but his face, and everything and his hands felt so nice and Castiel would give everything he had if Dean would just never stop touching him.
“Dean,” Cas says one day just after his bad days ended.
Right?
He said no and the man huffed.
And with that, Dean left for work.
He closed the cash register.
Dean was barely able to drive the car. He was very much inclined to just floor the gas and turn Baby into a low-flying plane just to get to Sam faster. But Castiel next to him kept reminding him that they’d be no help to Sam if they ended up as road kill. So he restrained himself, but it wasn’t easy. He could only imagine the pain Sam must be in right now. If they hurt his baby brother, he would kill them. Hell, he’d kill them anyway.
Something irked Castiel about this
You can almost hear Mr. Edgar behind you.
. And now?
He’s gone to the park a few times since then, but the man never appeared again. Some part of him tries to tell him that this guy hasn’t been real at all. That the flower and the crystal are just something that Dean picked up somewhere.
Dean got out some bread and peanut butter. Making the sandwich calmed him down. “Huh,” Sam said and Dean turned to look at him. Sam was holding a crumpled flower in his hand. “I wondered if I still had it.”
him to be happy. He can do this. For the first time in his life, he can do something solely for himself.
Castiel smiles at Dean. “Because balloons make everything better. We should’ve gotten glitter, too, you know? We’ll help, Dean.”
Dean blinked at him. Did Rowena tell him all that?
Besides, Dean got by fine with four hours of sleep. So he could do it too. It didn’t matter that he hated his life. It didn’t matter that he barely slept at all. It didn’t matter that he had nightmares and didn’t know how to make them stop.
“He saved me,” he says and Sam is blinking at him.
Castiel’s hands started kneading his ass cheeks and his pants were hanging off his kneecaps now and his dick was
“You will,” she said with a convincing tone. She wasn’t being nice to him – that wasn’t her style. She truly believed he could pass, and that gave Sam some hope. He could do this. He’d pass that test – no, he’d ace it and Dean would celebrate with him and then – then he could finally be a real member of society.
A little more time, and then all of them could sit a table together, enjoying a family dinner.
Oh. There was a dark tone. Castiel was angry. Edgar didn’t like it when Castiel got angry. It made his chest hurt. He wanted the flower boy. The one the flowers kept chatting about. Not this one. He cawed quietly, hoping to get Castiel to stop. He didn’t know why his chest hurt.
Dean gets up from the ground.
Sam stands behind him and it’s a comforting presence. He’s not alone. He’s never been alone. He’s not alone in this trial and Sam will support him.
Dean untangles Jack from your arms and picks you up. You don’t understand. What is he doing? Maybe he’s throwing you out. Yes, that must be it. It hurts, but at least it’s Dean. At least you’ll get to see Dean until the end.
You can’t possibly face Dean. What would he say? You don’t want to look at him and see the disgust in his eyes. The last time you’ve really seen him was the last time he’s ever visited you. This was so long ago.
Dean pulled him up by the arm and Castiel stumbled, right into Dean’s chest. He hadn’t planned that, but oh, it was so nice. He stayed there longer than he probably should. Dean just put his hand on Castiel’s back and didn’t push him away.
Sam sighed and looked back down onto the table. They had a map lying there. From what Cas had told them, it seemed to be an at least moderately sized building. Only problem was that those were in abundant supply. Edgar chirped quietly next to Dean’s ear. It was the first time he’s ever seen the bird so depressed. It hadn’t even dived for his coffee.
The needles were always empty and when he sniffed them, he could smell nothing. He wondered if he would find out more in the library. Dean would know what junkies were but Castiel couldn’t ask him.
The guy blinks again.
? But that didn’t make any sense, now did it? Castiel stood up again in one fluid motion, smiling at Dean. “I do believe I’ve got her blessing. Don’t you, Dean? So, tell me, what’s in the bag?”
“Let there be fire.”
Dean looked at his mug and pulled a face. He wasn’t sure if he wanted the bird-coffee now. “It’s... let him have it. I’m good.”
,” he says then, “but y’all are helping me with that. I ain’t the only one blowing these things up.”
“Rowena, do you think your tracking spell would work? It’s how you found me, so shouldn’t we give it a try?”
Castiel shook his head and something akin to a broken sob escaped him.
Dumbfounded, Dean just stared for a solid second before nodding. “I... eh, yeah. I hope that’s okay?”
He wondered what Dean thought of red cars.
First Cas hadn’t been what he had pretended to be; and now Edgar was the same?
Rowena got dragged out of what Dean assumed must be a backroom or something. The man dragging her had a hand wound tightly around her arm. He had a gun pointed at her general stomach area and Dean wanted to get up but his leg wouldn’t cooperate.
He could be with Dean.
, Cas had once said. And maybe Dean has to do just that. What else does he have left?
“Yes, Sam. Forgive me.”
Dean dances with Eileen and Sam dances with Cas and Maria. Charlie’s taking pictures and Dean loves it. Cas can’t dance for very long and he leans heavily onto Sam but he tries his best for Sam and Maria both.
“Might I have this dance, milady?”
“I think about it a lot. I could take your hand like this and just... break every finger on it. Bend them backwards, just to hear you scream.”
I want to have a porch with a nice garden and I want an old recliner I can sit in when I watch my shows. We could’ve watched so many shows together; like stupid sitcoms, y’know? You would’ve laughed at all the dumb jokes, man; you really should’ve laughed more.
“I had just hoped that – that maybe now he and I could be... that we could be...” Castiel’s voice breaks away.
to him, and you will do it
A man afraid of flying and an angel afraid of falling.
Castiel looked around. “Why ever did you stop?”
You’re pretty, the man in the suit said. He was buying condoms.
But now he doesn’t need you anymore.
Castiel put his face as close as he could without touching it to the car window. He stared at the building outside and Dean hoped he liked what he saw. He drove into the parking lot and parked his car there, before shutting the engine off. He turned to Cas, but Cas had already left the car. Well, alright then. Dean took a deep breath, closed his eyes, and – and nearly suffered a heart attack, because the door on his side got ripped open and someone dragged him outside.
They stood there in silence, watching the fire feed quietly.
seemed reserved about him, but – Dean had just assumed that Cas was shy or something. Why hadn’t he said something to Dean?
Sam doesn’t understand. Dean’s afraid that they will understand that Cas isn’t human and take him away. They’ll take him away and Dean will never get to see him again and they’re going to conduct experiments on him and Cas won’t understand and he’ll be in pain and Dean wouldn’t be able to save him because he can’t overthrow the government and Cas will think that Dean gave him to these people and he’ll resent Dean and wish him the worst and wish he’d never pull Dean out of hell –
“Long after its death, a star will remain in the sky.”
Sam looked over and saw Castiel stumbling over himself in his haste to come over and greet them. Rowena chuckled behind him. He was guessing she was going to wander off to bug the poor bird.
“It’s too bad. You’d look so good with a flower crown, you know? I should make one. You’d wear it, right? It’d be all nice flowers for you.”
It looked simply like an abandoned farmhouse. Parts of the roof were missing and in Dean’s opinion, it looked ready to be ploughed. That was very likely the reason these people decided this to be a good hiding spot. They had parked the car quite a ways away and Dean was more than ready to storm into the barn head on.
