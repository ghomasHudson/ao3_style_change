“I'm calling the team, we'll be there as soon as possible,” Tony could already hear the Avengers' alarm going off. “Did he see you?”
“We're all a little broken, Tony. That doesn't define us. You're perfect despite being broken and it's that that makes you the man that you are. Lesser people would have crumbled long ago but you still stand and fight. You care about what happens to this stupid planet even when it hurts you over and over again.”
“Tony! Please!” there was something in Steve's voice Tony couldn't decipher and wasn't sure he wanted to.
Despite countless possibilities in which their visit could have gone wrong (most of which were sure to be Tony's fault, at least according to everyone who wasn't Tony) things went uncharacteristically smoothly.
Steve grabbed Tony's waist to bring their bodies even closer and Tony put his hands on his shoulders, fingers going through his hair. There was no more hesitancy in his movements, like Tony finally gave up on holding himself back.
The man was surprisingly hard to track, always moving, never alone. For someone who was supposed to be an easy target, he made Steve and his team incredibly frustrated. But when they found out he would be at the gala, the opportunity was too good to miss out on.
Steve looked mad for a second, but Tony got the feeling it wasn’t directed at him. “Look, Tony… I know myself. I know what I feel. There’s no question about it. I’ve felt that way for some time now,” he looked Tony directly in the eyes. “I love you.”
Steve laughed in disbelief. He wasn’t even that surprised that Tony somehow managed to get his number, since this seemed to be his life now.
Tony narrowed his eyes, as if he wasn’t expecting Steve to be nice to him. Then shrugged, as if it didn’t matter to him whether they were sitting down or standing up.
Steve was pretty sure he stopped breathing. He looked at Tony, whose face was blank, processing. But he wasn’t called a genius for nothing. He figured it out right away. He was trying to find evidence that it wasn’t true, that Steve wasn’t who this guy said he was.
Tony's face was a mask, blank and cold, and for the first time since they started dating, Steve couldn't read a single emotion on his face.
They both had their pasts. Steve couldn’t exactly fault Tony for keeping some things to himself, when he had his secrets as well. He just hoped that one day they could both open up completely and be honest with each other. He hoped Tony would understand what being the Captain meant to Steve, that he would accept it.
Steve smiled at this man, so bright and full of life. He couldn’t wait for Tony to put the armor on and to fly with him, because even though they’ve only done it twice so far, it was fast becoming Steve’s new favorite thing in the world. And then they were going to go to Tony’s penthouse which Steve would not leave until he showed Tony just how much he loved him.
“So, you’re an artist?” Stark prompted. He didn’t really seem bothered by Steve’s lack of words, as if used to people being left speechless in his wake.
New York City, the Stark Tower at its center. It was simplistic but Steve liked drawing what he could see, and the Tower was hard to miss from where he was sitting.
Tony laughed and judging by the way Steve flinched, it sounded as bitter to him as it did to Tony's own ears. “Good to know I'm only valuable to you in a suit.” He stood up and went to leave but Steve intercepted him. “Get out of my way, Rogers.”
Apparently, some of the more dangerous Japanese terrorist groups were strongly against any deals being made with SHIELD which prompted the Japanese government to take extra measures in securing their guests’ safety (Tony should have told them in advance not to bother, wherever they go, trouble somehow always found them regardless).
But drawing was always calming for him, so he liked to do it when something was bothering him, simply to get his mind off of it for a few hours.
They kept searching the rooms. They ran into more guards looking for them, but they dispatched them quickly enough. They were running out of time.
And then they were off, talking about everything and nothing, from favorite movies to Tony’s atrocious taste in music. Steve couldn’t remember the last time he laughed so hard. Tony was funny, witty and unbearably attractive, and the champagne they were drinking made everything feel light and easy.
The blur became more than a speck of red. Its movements in the sky were elegant, arresting. The Iron Man armor somehow seemed to be dust free despite being in battle not more than half a day ago. The red was striking, the brightest color Steve had seen since the battle, all around him grey, grey. He was missing the red, he realized. This red. He was looking for it everywhere.
But Tony knew inside that Steve couldn’t. He was honest and kind, and he probably wanted to let Tony down gently despite everything.
(and Tony knew they couldn't give him anything, even at the risk of one of their most important foreign visitors dying. He knew it would cost them much, not just their almost formed deal with SHIELD but all the relations they have with America in general and they couldn't afford to lose that. They were still helpless, Tony knew, so he felt bad even though he was the one with a gun pressed to his head).
Regretfully, he started to pull his hand out of Steve’s but Steve’s hold suddenly tightened, and the man straightened in his chair, opened his eyes and looked around the room, as if expecting threats to come at them from the shadows. When he saw nobody was attacking them, he relaxed and looked back at Tony only to widen his eyes at seeing the genius awake.
Tony’s smile was more subdued. “Well, I was selling weapons to the military, so meeting soldiers was kind of in the job description.”
The statement was met with silence. Everyone knew who Obadiah Stane was. Tony’s closest relative after his parents died, the guy who helped him run the company from the beginning. On one hand, if anyone would be able to get away with selling the weapons right under Tony’s nose, it would be him. On the other hand, he was dead and would be the perfect person to blame if Tony had something to hide.
“I think,” Steve began softly, wanting to remove the haunted look from Tony’s face. “That as long as we’re together we can do anything.”
And, as they kissed, in the bright light of the lab, Tony thought, ‘Maybe this is what happiness feels like.’
Besides Steve's slightly concerned looks for a few days following the incident, he managed to do just that.
The effect was immediate. He started shaking, his breath was shallow and he was pretty sure his skin started to pale drastically. He heard shouts, probably from Steve but he couldn't concentrate on that now. He brought the reactor to the bomb, removed the casing and connected the wires to the bomb. 10 seconds. 9 seconds.
"You didn't have to, someone wrote a wrong code in a classified SHIELD program and nobody could figure out why it wasn't working." Tony's helmet retracted and he leaned his back on the railing, closing his eyes.
Steve's chest tightened. "So what are you saying? You were just pretending that whole time to be an asshole?"
They sat like that, in silence, for a couple more minutes until Steve was strong enough to ask. “So what do I do now?”
Tony was charmed by his apartment. It was honestly not a reaction Steve was expecting. But it was endearing, watching Tony walk around his apartment, stare at the various paintings on the walls, ask questions and listen to stories about all the knick-knacks Steve had lying around.
When she noticed Steve all but dragging him back to the side of the building their rooms were in, she gave him another smile, this one more sympathetic, as if she knew the chewing out Tony will be submitted to. He shrugged in her direction in a what-can-you-do manner (as if overbearing super-soldiers were a regular appearance in his life... which, okay, maybe it was). Steve himself refused to get checked out and unlike Natasha, he could get away with it given that he was a super-soldier and was perfectly fine (which Tony of course had to translate to the nice but annoyingly hovering Japanese doctors).
He could have watched Steve forever, but he was getting thirsty and there was a glass of water on his bedside table, just out of reach.
Tony suppressed a flinch. Steve must have noticed it anyway because he frowned. “You don’t believe me?”
“I think…” Tony started slowly, “that you’re confused. You’re… I don’t know. Replacing attraction with love.  I thought… Well,” Tony shrugged, “I thought that you just needed to get me out of your system.”
Steve rolled his eyes. “It’s your annoying presence that’s the problem, maybe you should do something about it.”
Going from room to room, avoiding the occasional guards, Steve stalked through the base, trying to find incriminating evidence. He wasn’t sure what exactly he was looking for, but he knew he would know it when he sees it.
"What about Pepper?" Steve couldn't help but ask. He knew she was always there for Tony, and that they loved each other in their own special way.
And while she has been a great help to them, there was one important piece of information that made it very dangerous saying that name to Tony Stark. And it was that Janet Van Dyne didn’t know their secret identities. She didn’t know who the Captain was. So saying her name as Steve Rogers was not a smart idea. He could only hope that Tony didn’t know her well enough.
Steve was still looking at him, as if thinking what to do with him now (and how to get him away from the fight probably) when his eyes widened again in panic and he screamed “Watch out!” as Tony felt the cold end of a gun being pressed against his temple. Tony's breath caught and he was still looking at Steve's panicked eyes. The guy holding him at gunpoint was screaming something to the agents or officers or whoever the guys who their back-up were, but Tony couldn't really process the words. He probably couldn't have processed them even if they were in English.
so really, this whole saving thing is totally selfish,” Tony said, but there was no heat behind it, no true feeling. As if he was fighting this for the sake of it, or because that was the only thing he knew how to do, as if he had to tell himself he was a bad person until he didn't know how not to say it.
Steve clenched his jaw. He knew it was only a matter of time before they went after Tony, considering the amount of damage he could do on their computers. But he hoped they would be dumb enough to try and get rid of him first.
“Oh? And who is your friend?” Tony asked. He didn’t look like he doubted the story at all, which was good.
Tony’s expression was conflicted, almost as if he didn’t want to know the answer. “Maybe,” Steve said. “Maybe not. Maybe no matter what we would have done differently, Thanos would have always won. Maybe what we do now matters more than what we could have done then.”
“Tony's right,” said Steve. “He needs to be protected from possible attacks.” Tony tried not to show his surprise at Steve agreeing with him. The tension between them since the fight with the stupidbots (yes, Tony was still calling them that,
The leader shook his head, not buying Steve's sad attempts at keeping his attention. He nodded at the guys on his left and gestured toward Tony.
“Oh we’re going to have so much fun,” Tony said. Then paused and looked at Steve. “Some other time though. I’m busy today.”
“Yes, well you're not the only one who speaks it and you're definitely not the only one who knows how to negotiate,” Fury was looking at him like he was daring him to disagree.
“Yeah, I guess… We do still sell weapons, but it’s way less nowadays.” He bit his lip, debating whether to continue. Then said, “I’m thinking about shutting down the whole division actually. Well, not just thinking about it. We’re doing it. It’s just taking us a while.”
He stood up, eager for movement. His muscles protested, but he ignored the pain, wanting suddenly to be outside. The balcony was empty and the cold wind soothed him. The stars and the moon were a faraway light-bringers, making everything look subtle and monochrome. Steve stood there, waiting for something.
Iron Man took his wrist in his armored hand and distanced the phone away from his face so that he could see it better. As soon as he did, he chuckled, “Come on, it’s just a joke.”
Tony was in the same position as he has been the whole morning, sitting in a chair, his legs tucked beneath him. He felt small, incompetent, like a child in front of their parent, after they screwed up some important task.
The face tattoo guy was pushing him back, punches fast and unforgiving. Steve felt off balance, and he didn't know how to regain it back.
When you go into these things, you plan for every variable, you account for every possible scenario. You think about the worst possible outcomes.
Steve narrows his eyes too. “So is that what we are, now? ” and he reaches forward to caress Tony’s cheek.
OH, AND BY THE WAY, there is a funny point in this chapter. Tell me if you spot it, the first person with the correct answer ... will be forced to suffer reading through more words from me :)) aka a small fic based on a prompt of your choice :)
“You were wet before you walked in, right? That’s how much you want this,” Steve pushes the third finger in and shuffles a little to help Tony pull Steve’s pants down.“I bet you were already wet in the briefing room.” Tony’s breath hitches as soon as he touches Steve’s cock, taking Steve’s breath away too, giving Tony the perfect moment to bite down on Steve’s collarbone hard enough that it would definitely leave a mark.
“Thank you, Lieutenant.” Steve nods and lays his head back on the pillow. Getting assigned to command
seems to be the turning point; a perfect queue for what needs to come next. It’s Steve’s alarm clock going off and he needs to wake up from this fairy tale any minute now. It’s not like he doesn’t want to wake up and face the reality, he does, he absolutely does. It’s just that he can’t work out the logistics. He can’t strategize. He just doesn’t know how to.
So he runs back home when he’s finally finished, takes a quick shower, and wears the shirt Tony has said complements Steve’s chest, once, and takes a taxi back to the city because the event will be over if he takes public transport.
The thing about wearing a mask more often than not is that you get used to it. You get used to hiding your face, your expressions, your identity. You become less important each day and the mask, as much as you get used to hiding behind it, does not become more important, even a single little bit. You get used to not having a choice, not being yourself, not being the mask. The thing is, you get used to hiding, altogether.
He turns to Captain Rogers, who’s watching Mr. Murdock with wide eyes, one hand frozen in the air with his half-eaten, god-knows-how-manyth granola bar. “So you’re telling me that his best option is not going to court?”
Steve smirks and shakes his head as he taps on his phone to spin the stripping wheel. “You certainly have a type.”
Ty is always gentle when he takes Tony’s clothes off and helps him get into the shower. He is extra careful not to touch any sore spots as he dries Tony and kisses all the red and purple spots he finds along the way as he dresses him. He puts Tony in bed and covers him with the fucking gray duvet and cuddles him to sleep. He says how sorry he is, how much he wishes he did not have to do this and how much he loves Tony. And it’s not like that Tony doesn’t try because he absolutely does. He might be
“A…” Steve begins, as he shakes his head again when Dr. Stark presses a circle around his navel and looks at Steve. “A plug,” he manages this time, keeping his eyes on Dr. Stark, having learned from recent experience that they are the only kind concept in this disastrous day. He doesn’t expect giggles and condescending looks anymore, and it’s amazing how weightless the truth makes him feel. It’s nice, Steve realizes with astonishment, as he tries and fails to stop staring at Dr. Stark. He desperately needed to tell someone about this, even though he had no idea himself.
“Let me finish Tony,” Steve said exasperated. “I mean… it’s like you said. When we were in Japan. How you will always do the right thing no matter what. Even if there’s no one there to save you,” Tony nodded, wondering where Steve was going with it. “Well, you were right.”
“He’s a dangerous man to know my secrets,” Steve said. “And smart enough to figure them out before I’m ready to tell him.”
As if summoned, the machines at the end of the room started moving, and Steve realized they were big robotic hands.
In any case, Tony believed him, so Steve was free for the night to focus on being the Captain. It was weird, being in that role again. Technically, he was the Captain almost every day at the base, but it was a different feeling all together when it came to the outside missions. Especially one as dangerous as this one. Steve couldn’t help but enjoy the feeling. He loved being the Captain. And though he loved spending time with Tony as well, he didn’t know if he would have been able to give it up for him. He hoped he would never have to choose.
The guy walked up to Steve, slowly. It was like he considered himself a predator and Steve the helpless prey. Maybe in that moment, he wasn’t so off the mark.
They walked like that, hand in hand, through Central Park. It was nice, being able to just walk in silence and enjoy each other’s company, without it being awkward.
Steve clenched his fists in annoyance. Despite not wearing the suit, it was getting harder not to see Iron Man in everything Tony did.
"Not exactly," Steve said. His hands gripped the rails a bit too hard. His fingers were chilled. "I just like the red."
“It’s beautiful,” he said, staring at the city below. He could also see the two of them, each with a glass in hand, reflected in the glass. It would make for a beautiful painting.
And all the tension Steve carried from the day before just evaporated. Here was Tony, smiling and disheveled, wearing a shirt with grease stains on it. It was so far removed from the cold, calculating Tony and yet there was still that undercurrent of power and knowledge in the way he held himself.
They all slowly stood up. Tony picked up his briefcase, slipped on his sunglasses and gave them a cherry wave as he walked back out the door.
Yet he couldn’t say no when Tony called. He couldn’t feel anything other than relief. His head had given him a whiplash with the amount of time it went from trepidation to giddiness in the days between the call and the date.
He created Iron Man? Stane, government, Hammer, Vanko... And that's without mentioning how it all started. The cave. Ten Rings. Yinsen.
Tony inhaled sharply. He looked away from Steve, and laughed, quiet and disbelieving. “And is that a good thing?”
“Tony! Are you alright?” that's weird. Steve never used their names in a fight even though everyone already knew their identities. Something about professionalism? There was also something distinctly
Tony didn't answer, didn't even open his eyes as he listened to Steve's soft footsteps leaving the room, closing the door.
Tony came to stand beside him, close but not touching. The urge to hold him and forget about everything else was still there, but there was also something in Steve that just wanted to move away. Leave Tony behind and never look back. But it was too late for walking away. His heart would not be safe either way.
While most of the bad guys managed to get away, they did capture enough of them to ensure someone would have necessary information, even if extracting it wouldn’t be fun. Steve was always grateful to Natasha for stepping in when the prisoners started to get difficult.
“We thought about it,” Tony said. “Actually, I was supposed to just give a press conference and then set everything in motion. But… Some things happened. Stane died,” he said that quietly, staring darkly into his plate.
Tony must have heard the pain in his voice, because his gaze softened. “We were idiots, weren’t we?”
When the team finally arrived with Tony's armor in tow, Tony was ready to kick some Asgardian ass. With his teammates. Not alone.
"Pepper and Rhodey were an exception, if only because they were already in my life. And they wouldn't let me put distance between us, no matter how much I tried."
Steve was at a loss. Stark was someone who always seemed so larger than life, distant and unobtainable. Yet here he was, standing in front of Steve, looking at him with his intense, brown eyes. Steve didn’t really know what to say to him. Certainly nothing nice. Besides, he was a lousy flirt, even with the people he liked. “I… I just wanted to say how nice it is of you to be here and support the charity,” it was the lamest thing that could have come out of his mouth, but it was the only genuine thing as well.
He was a genius child born into a wealthy family? His father was constantly disappointed in him and his mother went on expensive trips to Europe in lieu of taking care of him.
“And did it ever occur to you that I was doing that to protect your identities? So that you would have the time to put on a cowl or a mask before I just barged in?”
Stark raised an eyebrow. “I live close by,” he said, pointedly. Steve flushed. Of course that it was normal for Stark to go to the café that was across the street from his Tower. “Mind if I sit?” Stark asked when it was obvious that Steve’s brain would still need a few seconds to reboot.
Truth was, Peggy was more than just a friend to him. They tried dating, way back when, and he thought she would be the one for him.
“It’s weird to see them get along,” said Clint. “Does anyone else find that weird? It can’t just be me.”
Tony couldn't breathe. He knew what was coming. JARVIS called them panic attacks. Tony called them a weakness.
Steve had Tony in his arms, and he knew going forward that Tony would always be his friend. After spending years without him, this was enough. It might not be all he wanted, but it was enough.
Once everything was said and done and the remaining (not destroyed) statues were put back in their rightful places, the Avengers stayed behind for clean up. Because publicity, that's why. Or, if you asked Steve, because it was their duty. Or something. Tony was tired and he wanted to go back to the Tower. Some scotch would be nice right about now. But as he was playing a huge, weaponized, mechanical butler for Central Park, Steve came up to him. He seemed nervous, his hands playing with the head of... Was that Alexander Hamilton? Who knew at this point. Tony was really going to have to talk to Pepper about replacing those.
“Steve Rogers,” Steve said before he could stop himself, before he could realize that he wasn’t supposed to be Steve Rogers at this gala.
Tony took the unfinished Iron Man gauntlet that was sitting on the desk. He tinkered with it a couple of days ago, trying to put more power in the laser beams, but he never finished it.
Tony smiled. “I’m an engineer, Rogers. And that armor is, like, every engineer’s wet dream. State-of-the-art, highly advanced, gorgeous color scheme if I might add,” another smile at Steve’s laugh. “Of course I’m a fan.”
“Because it's cheesy,” said Tony while shooting repulsors at ‘robots’ who came a little too close to the civilians hiding behind the perimeter the police set up.
“I am, yes,” Steve said. Steve Rogers was officially just a small-time artist living in Brooklyn. He wasn’t well known but the pieces he managed to sell were enough to keep him afloat. It was a cover he was happy with, since he didn’t like to lie too much to people (his night job made him do that enough as it was) so setting up a real, small business and selling some of his paintings wasn’t really a hardship in the end. It wasn’t even that hard keeping up with it since he wasn’t that well-known.
Again, she ignored him, but this time she turned toward Clint who responded, “Apparently Stark likes kids or whatever.”
Tony wasn't sure what happened next. One moment he was standing, trying to convince Cap that he was okay and the next, he was on his knees, head on Steve's chest, hands clutching desperately at the front of his costume. Steve's hands were around him, as if he was trying to shield Tony from the world. It made him feel safe somehow when it would usually make him feel weak.
Tony eyed the shield at his back. The shield Howard made for Steve, the shield that saved his life. Tony had been mad that Steve got to bring it with him on a mission when he couldn't bring his suit but he had never been more grateful he wasn't listened to (Fury told him it didn't count because the shield wasn't a weapon, which was bullshit because if Steve used it in any way, it was as a weapon.
“Relax Steve, no one knows you’re the Captain. And Widow sent this to Iron Man, because that’s who I said was captured with you at the base.”
Tony’s coffee machine, like everything else in the Tower, was modern and elegant. Unfortunately, that didn’t really help Steve with figuring out how to turn the contraption on. It took him solid five minutes to figure it out and just as he was pouring freshly brewed coffee into a mug, Tony walked in.
Steve looked down. The drawing, which until that point seemed elegant and beautiful, now seemed small and undeserving. “This is really nothing,” Steve said, grimacing at his sketchbook.
So much could go wrong. This will be by far the riskiest endeavor they ever attempted. But if they managed to succeed? It would mean everything. It was worth the risk.
“No! Come on, you know how Iron Man’s like. Shoot first, ask questions later. You maybe don’t believe me, but I know that Tony is innocent here, and you have to let me prove that before Iron Man finds out.”
He was proud of it, he could admit it. Despite his disagreements with the man inside, that armor was a piece of art, and Steve had always been fascinated with it.
Natasha was blaming herself. “I should have known. I should have asked how they got the information.”
“Yeah, you and me both.” Steve was excited to finally introduce Tony to his friends. He planned to bring them all together to a bar, keep everything casual and fun. He didn’t know what he was going to do now. His friends will have this as their first impression of Tony, and Tony won’t even know he met them.
But then he turned his back and started walking toward the door, his two minions behind him. And Steve felt relief for a second, a hope that he would be able to explain everything to Tony himself.
Steve gave a startled laugh, as if he couldn’t believe Tony would think about him in a situation like this. “You have no idea,” he said at last. “I thought about it a lot you know?”
“You okay?” she asked, not exactly a whisper, but quiet enough not to disturb the stillness in the Quinjet.
“I swear to God, I thought she was gonna throw her shoes at me. I’m sure that the only reason she didn’t was because they cost more than her rent,” Tony babbled, smiling fondly.
Ever since Iron Man hit the scene, there had been many run in’s with him and Steve’s crew. Since they both seemed to target the same corrupt businessmen, it was only the matter of time, really.
For future references, Tony will blame the tears in his eyes on the chest pain. “Thanks, Steve. It means a lot.” Tony wondered for a brief second what Howard would have thought, Captain America being proud of Tony, when he was the one who always said Tony was nowhere near as good or as worthwhile as the super soldier.
. It made sense that Steve would be there. For Tony. Even if Tony couldn't even begin to fathom the reasons as to why.
“This is really not the time,” said Cap, spoiling the fun again and Tony really missed the time when he was annoyed at that and not fondly exasperated.
When Steve woke up, he felt sore and tired. His shoulder and his knee throbbed with pain but it wasn’t unbearable.
Putting the uniform on, cowl over his head, always felt like stepping back into himself. It was freeing in a way. He had a clear path as the Captain, while as Steve he sort of drifted off, unsure.
“Why not, Tony?” Steve asked. He knew he was treading on dangerous ground but he couldn't help it. “Why don't you think you're good enough,”
Steve swallowed. “Two days,” his voice was soft, worried. “They said that you’ll be fine, that you’ll wake up, even Bruce said it. But I just… all I kept seeing is you on that cold floor with a gap in your chest and your breath rapidly fading and…”
Peggy was silent for a long moment. She was the one who had encouraged Steve to pursue this relationship the most, and while everyone had been worried, she was nothing but supportive and happy for him. She wanted to believe Tony was innocent. For Steve’s sake.
The long walk through the hallway felt like forever. He was ready to get to work. Hopefully Iron Man brought them some news so that they could finally continue with their plans.
So when JARVIS spoke up after hours of silence, Tony was startled, “Sir? Mr. Rogers is looking for you.”
Steve hesitated. Then took a deep breath and started speaking. “I think we should invite Tony here.” Before anyone could start protesting, he added, “Natasha’s right, he is our only lead right now. And he’s the only one who could give us the information we need.”
No, what made Steve's fists clench and his chest constrict, was when some gal or guy found the way to get Tony's attention. Or when they spent the night in the Tower.
“A couple of times,” Stark said and Steve knew that if anyone else in this room said it, they would sound like they deserved a medal for taking the time out of their precious schedules to do a good deed, but Stark, the busiest man in New York, said it like it was the most natural thing in the world. “I’m working on some prototypes for prosthesis that would make their lives a whole lot easier, hopefully.”
Steve frowned but said nothing. Tony cleared his throat. “Right. You didn't have to stay with me you know. You could've gone to talk to Fury, find out exactly what happened. Really, I would have been fine.”
Stark looked at him, unimpressed. “Of course I can. But I can’t do the entire work for them. I’m a very busy man, you know.”
Steve hesitated before going inside. But the elevator took him right to Tony’s penthouse. When he stepped into the room, it was quiet. He was just about to call to Tony, when the man himself came from the other side, beaming.
But it was a nice thought, that not every rich businessman was a horrible person, only caring about money and their own influence.
“Listen,” Steve said. “Things didn’t match and we wanted to make sure. The last thing we want is to accuse someone of something they didn’t do. Especially you. You know what it would meant, accusing you of this.”
Tony stared at him for a long time. Steve let him, trying to convey everything he just said in his eyes.
And Steve was confused and frustrated and worried, but Tony was kissing him so nothing else mattered.
Steve wondered how he was supped to get out of this conversation. He didn’t want to stop talking to Stark, but he also didn’t want Natasha and Clint to wait for him.
He was everything Tony wanted. So Tony was going to give him a chance. He was going to give himself a chance.
Natasha looked at him disapprovingly for a second, before turning back to Iron Man. “Don’t do anything stupid,” she said.
Tony smiled. “It's okay. We'll be okay.” It felt like a lie but Tony had to say it. He took one last look at Steve, memorizing his face, his baby-blue eyes, his strong jaw, his blond hair Tony liked to pull when they were kissing or just go through it with his fingers when Steve was laying in his arms. His stubborn yet gentle expression which betrayed no fear, just sadness. They had only been together for a few weeks, few precious weeks, and Tony had never been happier in his life. He didn't want to lose that. He didn't want to lose Steve.
“Tony, what are you talking about?” Steve asked. Tony looked around. Everyone was staring at him (except for the Hulk who was still trashing some of the doombots even though they were already dead).
Steve is standing at the door, and well, he is blushing. Tony’s heart melts a little at the sight and he wonders if it’s appropriate to run to him with open arms, to hold him tight, and to kiss him all over that perfect red face.
Like always we're discussing the COVID-19 pandemic without mentioning the name so if it's something you don't want to be exposed to, please take care of yourself and don't read this on.
“Don’t you dare, Ty. Don’t doll me now. Just. Please. Don’t.” Tony’s lips are trembling as he raises his hand to clutch Ty’s jacket. He really wants to shake Ty and he hates it so much but he also wants to hold on to him somehow, because his head is spinning and he is not sure if he is sitting or falling.
“Handling it? He was digging his fingers on the patch of skin right above your ass, how were you exactly handling it?”
“I know that it’s something you’re into… so... I really want to give it a go. See if I can make you feel… make you…” And he trails off ducking his head, making Tony’s heart flutter a little.
“Golly, where on earth was he all this time? Did the private investigator finally find a trace of him in Sydney?” Steve asked, before unfolding the telegram after a few tries. His fingers must be cold, Tony thought and pressed his nails into his palms so as not to reach over and wrap his hands around them.
Tony leans in for a kiss, as he clasps his gauntlets behind Steve’s back, his lips burning through Steve’s mask all the way down to his heart and the sensation of having Tony and Iron Man wrapped around him makes Steve’s heart swoon and do a flip in his chest.
and extremely emotional at that point but he has been through this mill enough times to know that this is part of the same play anyway. It’s excruciatingly hard though; for Tony not to lean into his touch, not to breathe in his remorse and not to wipe his tears away. Tony needs this to stay sane. He just so desperately needs to believe him.
as Steve corrects him every time, without the slightest hint of warning in his tone. It’s a little funny, Tony thinks, how Steve shows up in Tony’s space and makes physical contact as soon as the conversation shifts, how he kisses Tony’s forehead or his cheeks when they seem to be done, every single time. It’s heartbreaking, just too much, the way he never forgets to tell Tony that he’s proud, that Tony’s done an amazing job of telling the truth, and being open as if ticking some stupid list is that big of a deal.
Thank you so much, to all of you people who are reading this, I appreciate your support and I really hope this brings a bit of joy to your heart in the difficult time we are all going through.
This is not the end. A cold liquid feeling flows inside his veins and the drops push the darkness away inch by inch. Voices sharpen, scents detangle and light creeps through the darkness. Tony breathes and blinks and the first thing he sees is a blurry image of a red-haired omega who looks back at him and smiles with her whole face.
Tony looks at Steve with wide eyes and bursts into laughter. “And you saved my neck, literally, despite everything,” he finally says, the ring of laughter carrying on to his voice. “You didn’t have to care. You definitely did not have to drag me to your place, even if it’s only three floors above the tattoo shop.”
Tony nods and caresses the back of Steve’s palm that’s trembling in Tony’s hands. “I love your brain and all of your toy— gadgets, and robots. I love it all, even when you spit things in my face that makes my ears burn from rage… I just love you so so much.”
Captain America kisses Iron Man’s chest plate and runs his fingers on the arc reactor making Iron Man lose his grip on Cap’s shoulders and tumble over Captain America, shakily, and he starts to moan and whimper too as Captain America holds him tight and arches his hips to press their cocks further together.
“Look at me,” Tony says and Steve opens his eyes, not having realized that he had closed them in the first place. “I wanna see your beautiful eyes, sweetheart.” He presses forward the slightest bit, tightening his grip on one of Steve’s thighs. “Are you ready?”
Tony holds him down as he comes back to himself, his mouth still around Steve’s cock and it takes so long until Steve stops gasping for air and loosens his hold on Tony’s hair. He doesn’t want it to end though. He wants to stay like that a little longer; with his body under Tony’s hands, his fingers messing up Tony’s hair and his feet rubbing Tony’s back. He wants to stay in Tony’s hold, he wants to stay connected.
, he repeats to himself, as he takes his suit and shield out from the back of the closet, smiling at the way his hands had shaken when he hid them there, the first day. He puts the suit on and takes a minute to look at his reflection in the mirror, before putting on the helmet.
Dr. Stark understands though. “Perfect. I’m putting the speculum in now. Just relax. It will be okay, done before you know it.”
“I am not really surprised. What did you eat yesterday?” Steve asks as he reaches for strawberry jam, which Tony picks up and hands to him.
was the exact thing that Tony had tried painfully to prevent for so long; what he had vowed never to do. The other part, however, was past losing another second to his doubts.
The armor means hope. It means resilience. Loyalty. Selflessness. It means rising above the literal situation and being there for the most vulnerable. It’s breathtaking. It’s phenomenal.
“Okay then,” Steve whispers as he smiles against Tony’s hair. “Just this once.” He pulls the covers over them, making sure Tony’s tucked in and warm, and presses Tony to his chest, gentle but firm. Tony closes his eyes, listening to Steve breathe in and out, and falls into a dreamless, deep sleep.
It's just so hard to write this fic and honestly if it wasn't for the asks and comments and all the enthusiasm I got from you lovely people I would have given up on this long long ago.
The room lightens up again and a shiver runs through Tony’s spine. A radio? A band playing a slow song? Ice coming closer and-- who on earth is Peggy? Steve’s words sound surreal, and the way he gets more incoherent by the second does not make any sense. There is something buried in between the scattered pictures he’s putting in Tony’s mind that Tony can’t seem to grasp, as much as he tries.
The fingers brush over Tony’s chin and rest on his throat. Tony tilts his head back, just a little, hoping to show that he
stay in Tony’s bed for as long as he wants, he fathoms, as Tony’s finger pulls out slowly, the realization tingling the inside of his chest like tiny bubbles.
“What is the problem? You said you aren’t allergic to any medication,” Bruce asks with a frown and he sounds a lot like Jarvis calling Tony out for making up bullshit reasons for not having done his homework.
Tony can technically let the argument go now. He can order breakfast, through the already-in-place arrangement with the hotel to provide food for the penthouse in a safe manner and get back to his list that’s now officially late arriving in Pepper’s inbox, but he can’t bring himself to do any of that.
Steve tries hard to go along and keep the bubbling laughter within. He turns over his shoulder, raises his hand and sways it slightly from side to side. “Rubber gloves?”
Tony watches him chew and swallow, and it’s right in that second when he finally decides it’s appropriate to lick the small bit of strawberry jam off Steve’s chin, that a familiar monotone voice echoes in the room and, well, nothing can be more of a turn off than the sound of the drawled words of the leader of the free world. Tony rolls his eyes one more time as he turns to the TV. “Why are we watching this again?”
Steve shakes his head and narrows his eyes. “No! No, no, no skipping, no. I can do this, it’s fine,” and well, Tony can’t say no to Steve’s pouting determination anyway.
“Don’t worry, I am not gonna steal your stuff and run away. I was just really hungry,” and he tries to grin wider, hoping he doesn’t look creepy from trying too much.
Steve gets lost in the short gap between past and present for a second, forgetting himself in the taste and the images and the feelings. He almost tells Tony about the actual origin of the dish being the abundance of egg and bacon in Rome after the US troops took over in 1945, but he catches himself just in time, settling for comparing what Tony has made to what he has had in Rome at an undeclared point in time.
Steve asks for the same things they’ve had for breakfast yesterday, as some of it should be what Tony would want to eat. He can ask Tony for tomorrow maybe, and he can order the night before, so he doesn’t have to leave the bed before Tony wakes up.
guy, is also Captain America, who died, and is now back carrying a 75-year-long nightmare, and 18 months of hell on top of it, where he couldn’t even sleep and yet, he’s the strongest, most level-headed person Tony has ever met, ready to fight, ready to run in the dark, open and giving beyond measure and reason.
“And I’m damaged goods too. You’re broken? Maybe, okay,” he says, as he brushes his fingers down the sides of Steve’s face, his voice low but confident. “But if you will have me,” he smiles as his own tears finally fall, and Steve’s hands snake around his waist, pressing into his sides pulling him in. “I wanna be broken with you.”
Butterflies flutter in Steve’s tummy and his head spins a little. It’s the light press on Steve’s lips and the fact that Tony knows that Steve’s soul is too large for his body, and that he just used the L-word when Steve’s been dying to tell him the very same thing for so long since... he can’t even remember when. It’s either and all; it’s this amazing human being, pressed firmly to Steve’s side that’s making him dizzy, making him fly.
Steve waits three whole days before he calls Tony. Two days, twenty hours and four minutes to be precise, and he almost pulls off being cool and casual and having called to just
“Breathe,” Tony says and Steve does his best, but it’s too hard to do anything - even breathe - with the finger teasing his hole, tracing the rim over and over again. It’s just impossible to focus on pushing the air out or pulling it in, with the want that’s burning through his body, the firm and slow pressure of Tony’s finger that’s pushing in, gentle but insistent, the way Steve’s hole gives to let Tony’s finger slide all the way in, pressing against something deep inside causing sparks to run all over Steve’s skin.
Steve wakes up to the thickness in the air. The scent is so heavy that Steve can feel the sweetness on his tongue. For a second between sleep and awareness, he wonders if he’s sleeping with his nose pressed to Tony’s scent gland, but Steve’s all by himself in the pilot seat, and other than the crackling fire that is starting to light somewhere deep down Steve’s bones, everything is as it was when he fell asleep.
“I do,” Steve says, a bit shakier than he thought he would sound, as he reaches for Tony’s fingers and wraps his hand around them. ‘
“Thank you, Captain, I’m glad that they’ve lived up to expectations.” He takes a step back and narrows his eyes. “Did you wanna take a look at the engine room? We did a full tour with Captain Wilson but never got a chance to show you around.”
Tony kisses Steve’s neck and nibbles on the perfect patch of pale skin under his ear. He tastes like honey for some reason, and it’s just not fair, because no one is supposed to taste this good even right after a shower. Steve’s humming turns into low moans, as Tony moves to lick his throat, and he closes his eyes and bites his bottom lip.
Tony leans back against  his chair and considers Steve for a second, and Steve’s hand feels suddenly cold now that Tony’s fingers are not covering it. Tony then stands up and walks around the table. He stands next to Steve, wraps both arms around his shoulders and kisses the top of his head. For a short second, everything stills and goes quiet. The touch of Tony’s lips to Steve’s hair runs through his core like a bolt of lightning and sets his whole body on fire. Tony says something, and the world has to unfreeze and start spinning again, before Steve can process Tony’s words.
“So you’ve never bonded, Steve? You live alone?” Ty’s question is a sign. Tony should not be surprised by any of Ty’s signs, hints and games after being through so many of them over the years but he still is, every fucking time.
He gives up, and lets go; because he doesn’t have to hold back, he doesn’t have to keep it together, he doesn't have to pretend.
Steve kneels between Tony’s legs, bends and kisses Tony’s lips. His mouth slides down Tony’s throat leaving a wet and warm line over his neck, on his Adam's apple and rests on his chest, right where the arc reactor scars are and Tony’s thoughts, almost all of them, drain out of his brain. It’s an ‘I’, he works out with too much effort, as Steve’s mouth moves in a half-circle from the center of Tony’s chest, licking his left nipple, making him hiss and moan, and curves down to reach his navel before moving back up mirroring the same curve on the other side, and the half-circle, over his right nipple back to the center of the scars.
No, it is the opposite of hurt, Steve thinks as he shakes his head and watches Dr. Stark focus back on pressing his fingers into Steve’s stomach. It’s pleasant, despite all odds, to have this nice smelling person so close, touching Steve’s body, caring and gentle, even if the context is all wrong. Steve can’t help but breathe it in, because no one should smell this good, and that wavy dark hair would probably feel soft if Steve ran his hands through it.
Steve wants to cry. He is trembling all over and everything is suddenly too overwhelming. The dinner, the game, the way Tony is moving him to the core and keeping him steady, it’s soft and it’s fierce. It’s a fiery blaze and a deluge of water that burns and heals; heaven and hell at the same time, too much and not nearly enough.
He walks in carefully, trying his best not to step on, well, every single household item he can think of, all mixed up, scattered on every available surface, and breathes through the panic of what Tony might look like if the way his apartment is one big mess is any indication.
We are still discussing the pandemic of the COVID-19 (although I have not mentioned the name so far) so please take care of yourself and don't read this fic if you don't want to be exposed to it.
He can keep his heart open, and hope for the best, despite the solid scientific evidence that proves him to be wrong to even try. The science can bend just this once, Tony thinks as he pulls the covers over them. He presses Steve to his chest, and thinks about the fact that no one can be wrong to at least try, before he falls into a dreamless, deep sleep.
“Good,” Tony whispers against Steve’s forehead, before he eases his hold and pulls back. He takes another sip of his coffee and considers Steve, eyes shining with a familiar spark that stirs something low in Steve’s gut. “Now, put this mug away because I see no reason to endure this painful wait any longer.”
This particular customer though is not difficult or loud, and he’s not crying in Steve’s arms while getting a ‘love yourself’ tattoo after a blind date gone horribly wrong.
“I’m Dr. Tony Stark, and I will be your doctor today,” the doctor says, finally looking up from his tablet. Steve hopes that he’s making this up, but it’s too obvious, how the doctor pauses, and his eyes stumble down to Steve’s crotch, where a bulge is sticking out from under the too short medical gown that Steve just changed into.
“Shooting Santa Maria could be quite catastrophic,” Dr. Banner raises his head from his PADD and takes his glasses off. “Without the perfect angle and precise force, it could blow up the whole spaceship.”
The light gets less intense and Tony can swear that he hears a muffled cry, as if it is coming from a covered mouth. He brings his hand down, finally able to see the full moon and a few stars in the night sky. He wants to sit up, get out and run away but he can’t even move to his side. He probably looks pathetic and the idea of being found like
He sits up finally and leans forward to kiss Tony’s hair. He then grabs the coffee mug from the bedside table to hand it to Tony and wonders if the way his eyes light up with the sight of coffee would ever stop being amusing.
And it’s not that hard anyway. He just needs to slide onto the bed, ignoring the way the gown stops covering him altogether as soon as he lies down, and just give up the last bit of his dignity. Simple. Easy.
“Okay. Let’s come clean shall we?” Tony huffs with a lopsided smile, “Vic and Anthony were very surprised when they received the order to prepare 2000 meals for the Houston Food Bank. Their food’s a bit expensive for charity, usually, but they’re closed right now and it’s not like they have anything better to do, so they agreed to throw in a discount. The meal is made especially for us, as a thank you from the 15 staff who will be cooking the meals for as long as the restaurant is closed to the public.” And his lips twitch a little to do that heartwarming cheeky smile that he does when he is happy with himself.
“So, what are his options?” Captain Rogers sits back on the chair at the head of the kitchen table, pushes Tony’s plate toward him, and smiles. No questions. No spoken commands.
Tony smiles and something goes loose in Steve’s chest, as he leans forward and his palm covers Steve’s fingers.
Steve put his free hand on Bucky’s shoulder and massaged it gently. Tony’s head started to spin with the picture they were making right now, so close, touching each other like that.
Tony is trying to stay focused on the conversation. Ty has one arm wrapped around Tony’s shoulders, squeezing from time to time. Tony’s hand is on Ty’s knee, tapping his fingers in a silent rhythm; trying to stay
, as a random person who seems to be all Tony’s got right this moment, has asked for his help. This flawless alpha who’s sitting too close, smelling like a bakery, who has called and discussed the situation with the best lawyer out there, ‘
Her soft hands are gentle on Tony’s body, and she smells like a meadow. She doesn’t seem to care about getting water all over her white dress and if Tony’s a smelly mess, she doesn’t seem to flinch or scrunch up her nose.
“Ah, she is lovely. Sorta. If you go past the stone-cold exterior and the fact that she will cut your dick off if she catches you in the wrong. That’s actually a good thing though, so yeah she is my lifesaver. I would have been dead or bankrupt or both if it wasn’t for her.” Tony says with a fond smile, and he reaches for the coffee pot which Steve grabs first and pours Tony another cup.
Tony wrapped his legs around Steve and listened to the rhythm of Steve’s breathing, waiting for it to become even. He was in love with Steve, with his whole heart, and yet his heart was aching for someone else.
Steve doesn’t hear the rest of that sentence. Watching Tony hunch over himself as if he’s being punched over and over again, he does his best to recite the reasons why he should use his words before his fists, but it’s too late; his brain has stopped functioning already, and his body is burning in rage.
“Not to navigate an asteroid field, but yeah, Avenger can safely stay still for the duration of a rescue mission.”
Thank you to fiftyshadesofstony, and JehBeeEh for beta, guys I am so grateful for your help,  <3<3<3
“You know, after the Great War, many alphas went MIA and left their omegas in absolute limbo.” He tilts his head to the side. “The omegas were not eligible for government help because they were not technically widowed, and they had no legal guardians to live with. A lot of them ended up in the streets, you know, in horrible situations”
He squints and stares at Steve. "Why am I still with the jerk? Because he’s a manipulative asshole. Like, right now, I can see it, certain and clear as I can see how blue your eyes are, that he only agreed to me getting a tattoo because he figured out a way to make it about himself and resorted to the most dickish moves to get what he had planned.” He then looks down at his plate, shakes his head and starts stabbing the stack of pancakes with his fork, frowning again.
“But, just so you know, and not that I’d be ashamed if I had picked up a hooker down at that bar, but no, it is not true,” and he shakes his head again, and something serene about his lopsided smile eases the pain in Steve’s clenched fists. He opens his hands and wiggles his fingers, as he lets out a breath he’s been holding, deep but quiet.
Tony narrows his eyes for a second and takes a step back. “You’re asking me? You’re the one so uncomfortable with being in my proximity that you’ve gone through extreme measures to avoid any contact with me, and
brushes his lips over Steve’s chest and bites his left nipple. They kiss with Steve’s t-shirt stuck above his head and Tony can’t help but press their naked skin together when Steve’s finally shirtless too.
Nat helps with putting on the white Army shirt that is suspiciously small but still too large for Tony that the neckline hangs off one of his shoulders. She also pulls and ties the string of the charcoal sweatpants as tightly as possible but Tony has to hold on to keep them on anyway.
Mostly to keep his head on his shoulders, as per usual, but this time specifically, to keep from disrupting Steve’s sleep. He has left his door open to hear Steve, in case he has a nightmare or something, hoping to catch it earlier this time, so he needs to stay calm; even more than he usually does.
Then Captain Rogers shows up at the door, still blushing, as he ducks his head and hands a pile of neatly folded clothes to Nat without so much as looking at Tony and suddenly the concept of wearing
Tony is sighing and rubbing his forehead when Steve shows up at his door, awake and not shaking. He has changed into clothes Tony has not seen before, so his things must have arrived sometime during Tony’s all day shouting festival.
“Oh I’ve read the theory in your Engineering Journal article from two years ago. Genius, Commander Stark, it’s genius.”
“I know about the NDA too. It’s fine, I'll sign as many as your legal department wants me to. You can bring them up whenever you get them. It’s okay. I understand.”
was holding up 18 months after Afghanistan? Wallowing in the misery of being betrayed by someone I thought loved me like a father, unable to hold a meaningful conversation with people closest to me? Do you know how many times I woke up screaming Yinsen’s name, and wished that I had died instead of him? You think you’re a mess? I almost died and I almost did nothing about it. I know how it feels to be eaten up by a secret, with the weight of the world on your shoulders and no one to share it with.”
It would've been easier if Tony was a horrible person. Or just average for that matter with some characteristics that Steve could come to hate. It would have really helped if he wasn’t just amazing.
Tony huffs and moans, intermittently, and digs his fingers into Steve’s back. “I know you’re easy Rogers, ah-” he bites Steve’s collarbone, right in the same spot again “-I can just whistle to you and you’ll be hard and panting for me in here.”
,” said someone else, before they laughed, buzzing and loud and Tony’s heart dropped to his feet like a stone.
He takes one more step toward Steve, but he doesn’t look that tall or big anymore. He’s a pathetic bully with some illegal shit in his pockets whom Steve doesn’t need to punch right this second. The big blond alpha who supposedly has a black karate belt stares at Steve for a while, hisses, and looks more like a wet ginger cat as he runs for the door.
He looks up at Tony, standing with his back against the window and the image of naked gorgeousness distracts him for a bit.
An old pain squeezes Tony’s throat, and he can’t feel the butterflies that were flying in his chest anymore. He clutches at Steve’s hand with both of his, unsure if he’s finally succeeding at the encouragement act or if he’s fighting to stay grounded, holding onto Steve like a lifeline. He contemplates crawling over the table to be closer to Steve but the whole diner is already looking at him, or that’s at least what his brain is so unhelpfully providing. “You
"Where do you live, Captain Rogers? Manhattan?" Now that’s something safe to ask. Harmless, not showing off but still not boring.
hint of judgment in his eyes though, which Ty probably can't see. Or maybe he can but he doesn’t care and that makes a lot of sense because Ty doesn’t really care about a lot of things he knows.
“I dare you to tolerate my tongue-writing while figuring out the message. Now, lay back, lover.” He pushes lightly, and Tony goes with ease, still confused about the daring aspect of the deal, as if either of those could be the slightest hardship.
What if they had gotten a chance to be together before the war? What if they had been allowed to turn that mind-blowing, heartbreaking connection Tony had been witnessing for months, into something that was called love these days? Would Steve hold Bucky down just as he was holding Tony right now, blowing him away with every slide of his body? What would Tony do if he had met Steve and Bucky after they had gotten together?
It’s a lightning round of ‘Would You Rather’ questions. Tony reads the first question that is blinking on his phone and looks back at Steve who has his ‘I can do this’ look on again but is fiddling with his fingers still, so Tony reaches over and holds Steve’s hands in his.
Steve bends awkwardly so he can rest his head on Tony’s chest. “It’s okay, I heal really quickly.” But he doesn’t sound okay, really. “It’s just that because of that, I end up in situations that I get hurt a lot. And although I mostly recover without a scratch, it still fucking hurts,” he sighs, and Tony pulls him in too slowly as if Steve’s physically hurt right now. “And I can’t take pain killers, nothing really works, and for a short period after every mission, it’s just hell.”
Tony breathes thickly, and his fingers tremble against Steve’s as he intertwines them together. He brings their hands up to his face, and the brush of his lips on Steve’s fingers send shudders through Steve’s spine. “I’ve got you, Steve,” he whispers into the back of Steve’s hand, “I can’t wait one more second to have you.”
“A proper date ha? Like burgers and movies?” He asks, and his heart fills with something extremely gooey as he imagines walking out of Tom’s Restaurant holding Tony’s hand, and throwing popcorn at him to get his attention when he seems to be enjoying the movie too much.
Tony looks up from the coffee Steve has just left on the desk, along with the blueberry pancakes he must have ordered last night. Steve’s holding his mug in the hand he is leaning on against the door, and is rubbing the back of his neck with the other. Spending the past 7 days with him, Tony already can tell that this is Steve’s
That he got beaten up in every alleyway in Brooklyn because he hated bullies?” He runs his fingers on Steve’s scalp, and a shudder runs down Steve’s spine. “Have you seen him when he was skinny and pretty? I have his enlisting photo somewhere in my confidential data storage because I can’t really keep stolen data on my phone, and let me tell you, he has the fieriest eyes I have ever seen in my life.”
Dr. Stark is leaning against the wall right before Steve’s eyes, tapping on his tablet, and, well, he’s still absolutely beautiful. He has a nice smile, adorable curious eyes, a lively vibe, a buzzing upbeat feeling about him, and perfect lips that Steve still wants to kiss so much. He is probably writing Mr. Steven Grant’s report, and that’s a horrible fake name, but Steve had come up with it when a quarter of his brain was operational at best, and he could always do worse, like writing his actual full name on the admission papers.
Steve’s mind goes blank for a second. He wonders if pretty has other meanings too, as the idea of Tony hiding a photo of
Tony does not feel lucky. His shadow of a plan to survive the hour of bumping along the road to Brooklyn, sneaking out of the trunk and finding a phone to call Rhodey, as foolish as it seems right now, did not include this. Any of this.
We are still discussing the pandemic of the COVID-19 (although I have not mentioned the name so far) so please take care of yourself and don't read this fic if you don't want to be exposed to it.
Tony is brilliant. He makes people laugh during the meetings and always credits his team more than himself. He volunteers to help teams bring projects to life and seems to know a personal detail about everyone he comes in contact with.
It’s too much, like touching an exposed wire with your ass, and it’s not even funny because assholes are so fucking sensitive. He squirms, whines, and shoves himself back, lifting his feet off the stirrups and crossing his legs.
He punches the imaginary sandbag to clear his mind and sweat a little, but he pretends the chain is broken already after ten minutes or so. He takes a shower for the second time and debates whether or not he should do the third pass when shaving his face. He combs his hair to the left, then to the right, then to the left again, and runs his fingers through it in the end, still hating the way he looks. He buttons his shirt and tucks it into the waist of his slacks, while he chants quietly that there will be a next date. A private show at Opéra Royal maybe, when the times are not too tough for self-indulgence, so he can wear his new army uniform, finally sorted out and delivered a couple of months ago. It’s ironic, he thinks as he takes one final look at his reflection, that he despised the damn thing so much when he hung it at the back of his closet, how even touching it felt so painful, reminding him of every single thing he left behind in the past. Now, all he can think about is having another dance date with Tony, wearing the uniform, and watching Tony’s face as his gaze runs up and down Steve’s body, to feel the heat in his cheeks and the flutter in his heart, to have his insides go warm with desire.
Captain Rogers keeps his gaze on Ty for a long second, and Tony wonders if pressing to Ty's side might help to push the shiver away, before Captain Rogers turns to Tony and holds out his hand. “Steve. Nice to meet you, Tony.”
Steve’s hurting, obviously, and Tony knows that he needs to say something, reassuring or comforting,
“You prepared the food? All of it?” Captain Rogers seems genuinely amazed as he looks at Tony and then at Ty. “The lamb? The cheesecake? Wow, it’s really impressive.” Tony nods with a little smile. His burning cheeks could probably pass as blushing but he can’t help the sheer disappointment in his glare before he ducks his head. Captain Rogers might be clueless about the intent behind Ty’s words but that does not change the fact that he has followed Ty’s lead and repeated those words. Charming accents and minimum levels of care for the human race could be quite misleading. Captain Steve Rogers is probably --
Steve nods, the way he does when he is all listening and thinking hard, and Tony’s heart does its usual flip flop, which he can’t really tell the reason for at this stage. Talking to Steve, or eating with him, touching his hand or his ass, is a sure deal to have the same effect to some extent; to make Tony’s heart swoon and a warm electricity-like wave to shudder through his gut.
Steve’s heart starts to beat fast and the anger starts to flame up from somewhere in his chest. “No. But I’m gonna call the police. What you’re doing here fits the criteria for endangering an omega, and I’m obligated to report it.”
Tony ran his hand through his hair and rubbed his eyes. This was… new. Being in a committed relationship, the happiest of them all, and having this kind of desire for someone else had never happened to him before.
“We’ll file an urgent application and considering the extent of the abuse, we should be able to get a temporary bond removal order with no issues,” Mr. Murdock says matter-of-factly, and types something down. “We don’t have to go through months of expensive hearings like many other states, thanks to The Nebula’s Act.”
“We can install one of the main engines on a rescue shuttle.” Tony’s voice breaks the silence in the room. “It will give the shuttle Warp 11 speed and we might be able to get to them in time before they get sucked in.”
Tony takes another deep breath and rubs his chest. It’s getting harder to breathe and the few tears on Steve’s cheeks, that Tony is dying to wipe away, are not helping at all. Steve stuck in a plane that’s sinking into a frozen ocean is too terrible to think about even once, and yet, the image is replaying in Tony’s mind, over and over and over again.
It’s been so long since Steve has had someone to listen to while sketching, even if that person’s constantly shouting and swearing; this time about how stupid it is for some small workshop in Malibu requiring a million dollars to get equipped to make medical supplies. Steve looks out of the window and tries to doodle the Houston skyline for the twentieth time, but what ends up on the paper are the fragments of Tony’s body that are visible from the open door of the bedroom.
The thing about wearing a mask more often than not is that you forget to take it off. You forget the explicit fact that you can make a decision; to be yourself, at least for once, after so many decades. That hiding is a choice, as much as being exposed and vulnerable; as much as trust. That a mask, even the reinforced, superhero special-made ones, are meant to come off someday.
Tony watches him the first few rounds as he shows up in the window and disappears. He then closes his eyes, listens to the wind in the empty road and wonders about what’s coming next.
Tony stares at Steve, eyes narrowed and mouth twisted. He then smiles as he raises an eyebrow, his eyes getting darker in a way Steve has learned to read perfectly, and a swirl of heat starts to coil low in Steve's body. "I think I just happen to know a way to test that.”
Something stings around Tony’s forearm and starts beeping, so he turns, slowly, and looks at a beta with too-serious eyes behind round glasses, tapping on the source of the pressure. He sighs with relief as the beeping stops, smiles at Tony and his eyes don’t look so serious anymore.
This is all very normal, Tony thinks, it must be, although he has no baseline for comparison. It’s fine, it totally is, even if it’s not what Tony had expected; not that he has a clear vision of what he exactly expected anyway.
There are lists to check through and surveys to fill. There are face-to-face sessions at pre-set times which are different from all the other times that they do ‘unofficial’ chats, and Steve even makes Tony write a 2000 words essay about non-sexual submission. It’s weird and gets more and more absurd every time a notification blinks on Tony’s phone, every time JARVIS lets Tony know that Captain Rogers needs to speak to him urgently about something super specific that Tony has to do his best to elaborate on ‘as honestly as he possibly can’.
“He saved my life, Bucky. Mr. Murdock, his lawyer who’s in charge of all legal deals for his company, stayed here for two weeks and did not leave until he finalized the bonding deed and got my release form from the Department. I would have never seen you again if he had not proposed bonding with me to keep me in Australia.”
Mr. Murdock takes his dark glasses off and sits back in his chair. “No.” He rubs his eyes, and runs his hands over his face. “If Mr. Stone files a missing omega report, before we file for the temporary relief, things get… complicated. If the police get involved, we might need to turn him in, losing any kind of leverage we have now, since his alpha has not filed a report yet, for whatever reason.”
“Get your ass off the fucking door, Rogers,” comes Tony’s voice from the other side of the door and a knot in Steve’s chest goes loose.
Tony smiles with the warmth that the idea of doing things with Steve brings him. It’s a sweet dream to have, that they will still do things together after they are out of here, and Tony doesn’t have to be rational about it right at this moment. He can pretend to be dreaming maybe, it’s still early and he is still sleepy enough so he can close his eyes and dream about a life with Steve outside of the walls of Four Season’s most expensive suite, which they are donating the money for - dollar for dollar matched by Four Seasons - thanks to Steve.
Tony lays Steve’s head on his thin chest. He runs his fingers through Steve’s hair, kisses the back of his neck, and wipes Steve’s tears away, so many times, as Steve apologizes, and apologizes again, and again and again.
“Well. What's there not to miss? You're brave and quick and go out of your way to do what's right. Thinking back on our away mission all I remember is gentle, calm... and hot. I remember everything, including the fact that you were a perfect gentleman.” Tony runs his fingertip over the back of Steve's hand. “I’m the only omega in a million light years around and you are rehomed from Old Earth, taking on this mission at the very last minute, and happen to be an alpha? Might it be that the universe is sending us a subtle sign here, don’t you think?”
“You know what’s the last thing I remember from before everything went blank?” Steve runs a hand over his face and rubs his neck. “I was tryinna' think about a band playing a slow song just for us, because I didn’t know how to dance back then too, you know?” He looks up at Tony with glassy eyes. “I remember how Peggy’s voice broke off, the radio silence in the last seconds, the ice coming closer and closer. My head was empty, no thoughts, no regrets, no last-minute change-of-heart.” He looks back down, dropping his hands and he clutches his knees so hard that his knuckles go white. “It was just fear as I closed my eyes. Dark. Cold. Blinding.”
“There are 328 people on board.” Commander Barton taps at the hologram and Santa Maria’s schematics show up. “We can take them on board temporarily until we get to the space station if we get close enough, but...”
There are no directions this time. No counting to left and right, no specific steps. Just holding on and staying close, as Tony says quietly before the music starts, body to body, heart to heart and swaying slowly to the music, as Steve buries his face in Tony’s neck breathing in the scent of his skin.
A warm fuzzy feeling bubbles in Steve’s chest and he bends over the bed to stroke Tony’s hair away from his forehead. He brushes his finger over the line of Tony’s nose, touches his magnificent lips, and he doesn’t want to be that guy but he just can’t resist the urge as he leans in and kisses the scars. Slowly at first, tracing his lips on the lilnes inch by inch before he loses himself in the fantastic patterns that mean the world to him, now more than ever, and he kisses Tony’s chest all over, wet and open-mouthed, warmth turning into heat and the bubbles run like a current through his veins.
Steve closes his eyes and wonders if he’s relaxing or tensing up as he presses his feet onto the stirrups and balls his fists, hoping to not have ripped any holes into the plastic of the examination table. There is a clicking sound, a deep breath, followed by a hum, and the plug starts to move. It actually starts to move, it's coming out, as Dr. Stark announces cheerfully, and it’s too much, the friction, the fullness, the sparks that are flickering in Steve’s brain, Dr. Stark’s tight grip on Steve’s thigh holding him in place. The pressure that’s been building since the morning, after Dr. Stark stuck a finger inside, all the humiliation and arousal and the fucking overstimulation, finally break through as Dr. Stark pulls the plug out, and the flood bursts through the dam and takes the very last of Steve’s self-restraint along with it.
“100 milion dollar deal with the Army, huh? I worked days and nights, skipping sleep so we could make the
Thank you to everyone reading this so far. I would love to know how you feel about the fic, and I truly appreciate each and every comment. Your nice words make my day and they are truly my fuel to go on writing this daily. I love you all and I hope everyone stays safe and happy during this hard time.
Captain Rogers is listening and his enthusiasm is a little suspicious for a professional artist and high profile art curator.
Tony turned over to lie on his stomach and pressed his aching body into the mattress, hopeful that the pillow would silence his sobs and swallow his tears. He closed his eyes and allowed himself to think about the only time he'd had Steve close. Not enough, but almost, dizzy with the sweetest scent in the world, Steve’s hair caressing the side of his face, the soft pale skin coloring under Tony’s lips. How Tony had completely lost himself, quite shamelessly despite the circumstances, and forgotten about the presence of the immigration officer in the room, or Mr. Murdock for that matter; how all that existed in the world was Steve and the soft low moan that took Tony’s breath away and made him sink his teeth in the delicate flesh of Steve’s neck so intensely that the mark had not faded the slightest bit after 143 days.
, his mind dutifully provided, as he walked along the beach to get back to the fort, wondering if he would be able to focus on the calculations of the base designs that he had to finalize by the end of the day. He let his tears drop as the wind picked up and when he looked back, in hopes of seeing Steve’s figure in the distance, all he could see was miles of empty beach, dotted by their footprints going in opposite directions.
Standing in front of the closet mirror, he puts on the white tie Ty has left out for him and smiles at the fact that he does not hate this cream suit. Well he does, but not as much as the fucking beige one he had to wear at the Art Production Fund Gala two weeks ago. He puts his cufflinks on, shoves the pocket square in his front pocket, and thinks about the navy blue suit hung in the closet in the master bedroom of Malibu house. He thinks about the way he would look wearing the suit, the blue shirt that got ruined in that incident
Thank you for giving this a try, I hope you enjoyed it. Sorry it is really sad right now but I promise it gets better
Steve then swallows him down in one smooth move, and Tony’s hands shoot forward to run through Steve’s hair, too rough perhaps, but it’s not like Tony has any command.
Tony smiles and frowns at the same time, with the card that comes up and he looks at Steve, wondering if they should stop playing altogether. Steve’s already walking around the coffee table though, and it’s amazing how he looks all happy and bright again, how he is moving effortless and easy, and how focused he is as if nothing matters more than him having to
enlisting photo and calls it pretty?” Steve shakes his head. “Feels like an exceptionally cruel and crazy joke to me, Tony. Feels like dangling heaven in front of my nose, only to have it taken away, like a story where the moral is ‘if it’s too good to be true, then it probably is’. There is no way that the universe would be
He waits to be yelled at then, as if he’s been a naughty boy, having done something horrible, and no, he is not gonna cry over this, no matter what, but for the first time in forever, he feels like covering his face and crying until the damn thing is over.
It’s fire. It’s rain. It’s an earthquake rattling Steve’s body, a volcano erupting and spilling all over. Tony groans and pauses for a second, and Steve’s grateful and disappointed at the same time. He needs a second - or an eternity - to get used to the storm beating in his chest and roaring in his ears, but he wants more, much more; he wants it all and he wants it right now. He whimpers, cries and screams as Tony starts to move, his words slipping over Steve’s skin, meaningless but comforting. Tony pulls all the way out, until he’s only barely inside, and Steve’s mind goes blank, with the burn and stretch that melt into a pool of pleasure as Tony pushes right back in.
. I’m a huge fan of your designs and I swear by StarkLit 17 magazine system. I’d make all semi-automatics the same if I could. Or I’d make SL17 mandatory on the field."
Captain Rogers shakes his head, his eyes fixed on Tony, and reaches out so Tony can grab his hand. “Tony’s with me. I’ve got him.”
Steve stretches his feet tentatively and sits up. He covers his lap with the blanket and pulls it further up to his chest. He waits for the plug to move and stab somewhere deep inside, but he can’t feel anything down there, except for the shadow of Dr. Stark’s fingers that Steve doesn’t want to think about right now.
Things untangle with every stroke of color on the paper. Thinking about Iron Man puts things in perspective as always and Steve starts to see the bigger picture here. ‘Sometimes you gotta run before you can walk’ he remembers from the anonymous interview he's just read and he repeats it to himself as he finishes the very last drawing. It’s Iron Man - not the armor, just the man - and the sketch of the guy Steve has never seen before has ended up looking exactly like someone Steve can fully recognize now, for a reason his heart knows but his brain can’t yet process .
“Then I found YouTube, God bless, and the thousands of Iron Man channels,” Steve says and smiles, small and easy to miss, but it’s there and Tony lets his breath out and does his best to smile back.
He walks the path between his bedroom and Tony’s, and knocks on the open door. His heart beats fast, faster than it ever has maybe, and he forgets to breathe in the few seconds it takes for Tony to get off the phone and turn to Steve.
“You would look perfect, you know, wearing an apron,” he whispers in Steve’s ear, the blow of his warm breath making the hair stand on the back of Steve’s neck. “Just the apron, with a tiny little knot at the back. God, I can’t believe I missed out on that sight.” He takes a deep breath as if he is imagining Steve’s naked body from behind and the idea burns a blend of shame and thrill through Steve’s neck all the way to the pit of his belly. He takes a deep breath, holding on to the edge of the sink to keep steady, as Tony runs his hands on his chest and has to bite his lip as Tony’s fingers brush over his nipples.
“What if I tell you that you have no idea who I am? That I was in a plane crash, but 75 years ago, that every inch of my body hurts all the time, that I’m so broken I might come apart any second now? That I am not supposed to be alive in the first place?” Steve rasps between broken sobs, “what if I’m not strong or brave and I have no idea how to save
It’s not busy, per se, because Saturday night is better spent on many other things, including going on dates and kissing people you love, but the few people who do come in are usually harder to deal with, because, well... many different reasons.
“At least we’re far enough from the black hole.” Steve waves his hand and the hologram disappears. “Rescue is a couple of days away and as neither of us eats that much, we can manage with the remaining power and water.”
Steve melts into the touch and closes his eyes, the faint scent of coconut body wash on Tony’s forearm easing his nerves a little. “I freaked out and started weeping like a giant baby. I was a total mess. I
“Mr. Grant?” He gestures to a vague space behind Steve, without looking at him as he steps in, tapping on his tablet rather frantically. “Did you want to sit down?”
“Of course,” Steve says, fully aware that he's staring at Tony and he might look somewhat creepy with the smile plastered on his face, making his cheeks hurt a little. “It’s amazing,” he adds, doing his best to tear his eyes off Tony’s face, and failing miserably. “You’re— your work is just amazing.” He coughs, feeling really hot suddenly, as Tony steps forward and places a hand on his shoulder.
Steve holds on to the wall and leans on Clint. “What did the doctors say? Is he gonna make it? Was what I heard when he was thrown out of the window the sound of all of his bones being crushed?”
any second, but Steve’s expression is a different kind of flustered, and Tony does his best to go with a different cool and casual response. “Help
Steve is still thinking about nibbling at Tony’s throat when he feels the blood start to leave his head. He freezes up for a second and his breath seems to get quick and short. He can’t see the press, as they can’t see him standing behind the camera and the screen that came in one of Tony’s boxes, either, but he can imagine the guy’s pathetic face, sweating in his oversized suit. Steve is now fully accustomed to the video-conferencing technology, but his body still wants to punch the guy through the screen. He clenches his fists and takes a deep breath, thankful that he has put his water glass down on the coffee table, so he doesn’t have to clean up a sea of shattered and bloody glass pieces after.
He remembers waking up in the middle of the night after one of those nightmares his subconscious can craft perfectly to maximum hurt level. The shady images that run through his brain, the absolute terror of waking up in the dark, confused and lost, the ache of seeing Bucky’s face in the white background, screaming and getting away from him.
He was tired, hungry, and decaffeinated like hell, wondering if coffee would help with the blinding headache of listening to board members yell at one another the whole fucking day. Taking off his jacket, Tony sighed and looked around, rolling his eyes at the idea of Steve not being around right at this moment. He threw his briefcase on top of his jacket and tie, kicked his shoes off, and was about to get FRIDAY to call Steve when he heard vague noises from the other side of the living room.
He wants to stay in this little piece of heaven. As crazy as it sounds, even in his own head, the only thing he knows he wants to do with the rest of his life is cling to Tony. To breathe in his scent, and bask in his ecstatic calm, to feel his constant vibrating and listen to his never-ending chatter, to just try and make sense of the way his brain works. To be amazed for the rest of his life with how a person could be so selfless, so giving and so fucking wonderful.
He lets Pepper know that he will call her back sometime in the foreseeable future. He leaves the ‘foreseeable future’ clause out of his statement, though, just in case.
He thinks about the new improvements for the face recognition feature of his project X and how he needs to write some hints down before he forgets the specifics, smiling at the fact that he calls it project X in his own mind as if he is terrified of someone listening within his own fucking brain.
any of that. What he does know is that being homeless is quite low on his list of options and it’s hopefully not what Captain Rogers has dragged him here to bring to his attention.
Commander Tony Stark spends so much time in the engineering room that it’s almost impossible to run into him anywhere else. He shows up to the cafeteria from time to time very late at night, his eyes fixated on his PADD, and attends the gym, well, never. Under normal circumstances, it’s crucial to ensure that the crew get balanced hours and do social activities to prevent burn-out and keep morale high. But these are not normal circumstances, not at all, which makes it justified for Steve to turn a blind eye.
Nat turns to Steve with a half-knowing smile. “I’m sure Steve’s not gonna do anything like that right?”
He thrusts in and out, losing all senses of rhythm as he comes, his body sliding so easily against Tony’s, his slick covered skin rubbing against Tony’s spent cock, and God, he wants to be gentle, to say nice sweet words, but he’s forgotten all his manners, hell, he’s forgotten how to speak.
The initial surprise and the few rounds of negotiations are over almost before they're started. Tony’s going down quickly, too quickly, according to their collective limited knowledge on how heats progress under normal circumstances, and he’s already shaking by the time Steve wraps his arms around him.
Captain Rogers leaves a plate with a couple of sandwiches on the nightstand and sits down on the couch. He rolls up his sleeves and Tony’s eyes wander on the golden hair shining on the pale skin before he moves on to look at the tiny bloodstains on the white shirt and he wonders if it’s too late to soak the shirt and he would need to spray hydrogen peroxide on them.
Steve can tell the music's over because Tony is not counting any steps. He is pressed to Tony’s chest, distracted by the warm breath hovering over his neck and a little lightheaded, with the power of a dream coming true. Dreams, old and new, of happiness and safety, and feeling warm after shivering for so long, coming home finally and being on time, not stuck in the deep dark ocean, not late. Not a rain check; not today. “Just needed the right partner.”
“Okay,” Steve says as he lifts his head to look into Tony’s eyes. “Spank it is then.” And he smiles, a little pained still, but there is a sparkle in his eyes that was not there a minute ago and the way Tony’s heart pounds in his chest, is just yesterday news.
His life has turned upside down a few times since he last took the mask off. Someone in the next room cares about the man under the mask, who now knows Steve inside and out, or is at least willing to give it a try, because he thinks Steve was pretty before the serum and what’s special about him does not come from a bottle. The world is still burning and Steve’s shoulders, as enhanced as the serum has made them, are too weak for the weight of it all, but he’s not alone in carrying it anymore. Life throws good things at people too, sometimes, and there is someone out there, who’s Tony Stark
“I was actually asking my client, sir, he’s the one getting the phrase-” Steve reads from the design sheet “-
His cock twitches and leaks in anticipation of what’s coming next and something prickles the base of his spine as Tony’s hands smooth the insides of his thighs. Heat builds up under his skin, bit by bit, as Tony’s fingers inch closer to the crease of his ass. The jolt of want that explodes all over his body knocks the breath out of him as Tony’s slicked fingers press gently on his hole.
“Captain Rogers,” he says as he stands up and walks toward Steve, patting a couple of engineers on the shoulders on his way across the room and draws a hand out. “Pleasure to finally meet you.”
Also if you were really wondering what I was doing in the past month, I was writing and posting my RBB fic, ABO arranged marriage in space with some ID porn :)) and here is the
Tony takes a deep breath. Why on earth can’t he take pain killers? The idea of having a mystery job that requires being beaten up all the time and not being able to take pain killers doesn’t sit well together, and Tony does not like the picture one bit. He sighs again and kisses Steve’s hair. “I am sorry, sweetheart, I am so sorry. It must be awful to be the toughest guy in the room when no one can seem to understand how hard it is to hold it together.” Tony runs his fingers on Steve’s back, drawing soothing circles, as he plans a chat with Bruce and emailing Dr. Cho in hopes of finding something that might help Steve, at least a little bit.
The oyster is ready to be shocked. The Steak is marinated and the pork belly is spiced. Tony sets the oven temperature and gets Helen to take the last platter of appetizers to the living room. He has set the table earlier, with the blue Limoges china Ty has asked for. He has folded the napkins into elegant blue and white swans as Helen wiped the dust off the swarovski crystal glassware. There will be only 3 people at the table, and Tony doesn’t hate swans as much as the fucking stupid bunnies he had to make 14 of during  a miserable hour of trying 38 times.
It’s too late. Tony’s not anywhere. Not at the bar, not talking to his besties from IT. He’s said goodbye to Nat and Bruce after grabbing his backpack from under their feet and has left.
Tony steps forward and tries to smile even if his face feels numb at the moment. “There is a Mark LI too, but yes, Steve, yes and yes. It was all me. It
“I will need to draw some cavernosal blood from your penis to see if the blood in the penis is oxygen deprived or not. We’ll use a standard butterfly needle—”  Steve is not sure if he’s heard correctly for a second because he’s been busy admiring the way Dr. Stark’s mussed hair looks even better than neatly combed back. “—so if you lie down on the table I’ll get the supplies—”  Wait, did he say ‘needle’? “—if the blood’s visually bright red, we will start with— ” No. no, no, no. No needles in Steve’s dick, thank you very much, that’s just… no.
“It’s been done before. A couple of times, but successfully. Matt’s onboard, he must be at the court now,” Captain Rogers adds, his body turned toward Tony, his cheeks cherry red, and his eyes shining. “I just need you to...”
Tony panics for a second at the possibility of Steve being part of the considerably large ‘I hate Tony Stark’ clan.
There is a heavy breath, and a low groan, Tony whispering something that Steve can’t quite understand, and Steve is not quite sure but he can feel Tony’s hand trembling against his stomach.
He will just have to breathe though, and swallow around the growing lump in his throat. Because he is not going to cry. He can’t let go now; he just can’t start to crumble.
Tell me what you think please, your comments, even the shortest ones give me the motivation to keep writing. Ideas and headcanons also welcome, because we have half a fic to go and there are only so many sexy things I can come up with for one single fic on my own :)))
“I love you,” Steve murmured against Tony’s hair, soft and sleepy, and shifted a little. Maybe he was not taking Bucky’s place. Maybe he didn’t have to lose Steve, to give him what he wanted.They had to figure this out, somehow. There would always be a way.
“Oh wow, me too! From New York I mean. And here on business.” He locks his phone, throws it on the couch and stands up.
“We don’t have to do it now.” Tony whispers, kind and reassuring in Steve’s ear, “we can do it tomorrow, or next week,” and he kisses Steve’s cheek, as the final gesture, the last message, “it’s okay if you don’t want to do it at all. Just tell me. I’ll do as you say.”
“No, God no, I just have to--” And this is it. This is the second. The perfect time. He can do it. “I need to tell you something too.”
Steve’s eyes pop out for a second before he shakes his head with a bit of fake judgment. “Let’s go with the new for now?”
It’s too soon. He's not ready. And even if he was, why would this wonderful, funny, resilient, breathtaking omega want to do such a thing with an alpha like Steve? It’s not like he’s given up on going out with someone in his own league, now that one handsome mighty alpha has turned out to be an absolute dick.
“Please, don’t get me wrong, but I don’t think anyone should spend this much money on luxurious items. There are people out there right now in this same situation as us who probably can’t afford any sort of accommodation. Or food for that matter.”
Steve goes off script, his brain blank and his body on fire, and begs to kiss Iron Man’s lips. And it’s amazing how the faceplate disappears, Tony’s eyes smiling at him and Captain America closes his eyes, as soft warm fingers remove the mask gently.
“It’s okay, Steve, completely normal to be a little sensitive in your situation,” he reassures gently, and Steve breathes out and tries to smile back.
Steve changes his mind about the restaurant a million times. He raises the budget over and over and over again because who needs an emergency fund if what you get in exchange is Tony Stark smacking the back of your neck for choosing such a wildly pricy restaurant.
“Why not?” Steve seems confused for a second. He takes a moment to think before he practically pouts. “I mean if you don’t want me to do it, it’s okay, I under-- ” and fuck Tony’s life, Steve looks hurt.
Tony kisses Steve’s toes. He kisses Steve’s shin and caresses the inside of his thigh. Steve’s body rattles from the sensation, as Tony lines up against him, kneeling on the bed, his cock slick and solid, hovering over Steve’s hole.
For all the lovely people who figured out that Steve said he won't wear a button-down just to end up having Tony unbutton his shirt as he was washing the dishes, well I love you all, I am so happy you let me know and it was so much fun <3 I owe every one of you a short fic, send me an ask and I'll write them, slowly but surely :)
Tony tells Steve about his mom, and how they always made Carbonara together, how it was Tony’s job to mix the egg and cheese and that’s why he can make this perfection of creamy richness with no milk added. Steve smiles and teases Tony about narcissism, but admits that the pasta is absolutely perfect. Tony smiles and Steve wishes he could just reach over the table and kiss Tony’s perfect laugh lines.
“It’s silicone. I did research. It wasn’t supposed to be breakable.” Steve says, finally looking down, and his voice is small, so small he almost hates himself for it.
Steve tries to say something too. He tries to reach over and touch Tony because he really absolutely wants to, but the connection between his brain and his body seems to be malfunctioning. He knows what he needs to do, at least in theory. He has thought about this so many times, and although he will never admit to
the way Steve’s still unable to open his eyes and look at Dr. Stark, the way his ass is throbbing and his dick is about to break the Guinness record for being hard. Lucky. Extremely lucky.
Sorry, this chapter took so long, but hey it's 3.5 k, so maybe consider it one and a half chapter? :)
“Dare?” Steve smiles casually, but he is rubbing his hands on the sides of his thighs, and there is nothing casual about that spelled in the universal language of nervousness.
Steve takes a deep breath. “Very,” he breathes out and he kisses Tony’s chest again, and then some more.
“God, no, it’s nothing like that,” Steve almost yells, as if taking the modern age impotence treatment is something way more horrible compared to his current situation.
Having stopped behind a red light, for the seven hundredth time, Captain Rogers turns the volume of the radio down before turning it off. The radio is vintage, original 1968, and dreaming about disassembling it must be the only tolerable thing about sitting in the front seat. In the back seat, if it wasn’t dusty and blood stained, he could’ve at least laid his head against the window and let the car movements lull him asleep. He could’ve let things take their course without being compelled to have a say; without pretending that his opinion really matters.
“So please don’t take this the wrong way, but I’ll be damned if I don’t ask and I will kick myself to oblivion if I do anything without being sure, so, here we go… is this your first time with a guy?”
“Tony,” he says and he stretches his hand out. Steve manages to grab the hand and shake it, and mumble something which, thank God, sounds very much like his own name. The guy, Tony, brings his other hand forward, holds on to Steve’s hand with both of his own, and smiles again. “Nice to meet you, Steve,” and Steve’s heart starts to race in his chest.
“I want to be your alpha,” Steve whispers against Tony’s lips, “you know, so I at least get to play the jealousy card if I had the urge to break someone’s neck.”
Steve’s hand snaked around Tony’s waist. “Tell him how the elbow fix has been for your shoulder, Buck.”
He is not ready yet. He just can’t, here, to these people, as nice as they seem and as worried as they are. He would choose a slow, painful death over saying the words for the first time and making it real in this situation if he could. But he can’t. As with every other fucking thing in his fucking stupid life, he doesn’t get to choose. Whatever the half-baked plan did or did not include does not really matter. All that matters is this invisible force that is driving him away from the hell he knows like the back of his hand into this new reality, foreign and unknown.
The weight of Ty’s hand as he wraps it around Tony, brings him back to reality. He suddenly becomes aware of his stupid enthusiasm and his sheepish grin so he shuts his mouth, ducks his head and holds his cup with both hands. He is not really worried about the way Ty’s fingers are now digging into his arm, pressure slowly building up and traversing through his body. Captain Rogers witnessing him being
“Mortified,” Steve says without thinking. “I’m thinking of ways I can disappear from the face of the earth. Or delete my brain, and yours, or something.”
Later in the evening, back at the compound, Steve chairs debrief meetings— pointless arguments between the broken superheroes who fight each other instead of an enemy whose whereabouts they have no clue of. He makes sure that everyone has something to eat, some hours of sleep, and a shower every once in a while. He cleans up the bathrooms. He cleans up the kitchen. He clears out the mess of take-out food boxes and ice cream tubs. He then walks up and down the long hallway listening to muffled sounds from behind closed bedroom doors until everything goes quiet and he can’t feel his feet anymore.
Things stop moving and sudden silence wakes Tony up. Pain and weakness come rushing back as he comes out of the sleepy haze and he feels his heart sinking as his half-ass plan seems to have gone out of the window.
“Oh my God! You’re really something, huh? He’s twice your size and really enjoys beating alphas up.”
Steve’s asleep in Tony’s arms. Tony is still kissing his hair, long after, and he’s thinking about the number that had passed his mind back in the shower. A thousand sounds like it’s so many touches but come to think of it, it might not be that many. If Tony manages to get his hands on Steve one way or another 2.7 times a day, it would only take a year to reach the one thousand mark. All it takes is a morning sleepy cuddle, a goodbye kiss before he leaves for work and a ‘honey, I'm home’ kiss maybe when he comes back. He doesn’t even need to count all the snuggling in front of the TV and watching whatever nonsense that would be on. Steve seems like someone who would watch fighting movies, but Tony bets he is into rom-coms as well, and who cares really, as long as Tony can wrap his arms around Steve and lay his head on his chest.
Steve’s neck-deep in the report he has to present in the meeting with Admiral Fury tomorrow. His dinner’s gone cold hours ago on the small table by the door and he’s going through his fifth round of data when a familiar voice breaks the silence of the Captain’s Ready Room.
Steve knows that for a fact. He wants, more than anything he has ever wanted, to give his heart and soul and whatever else is left of him to Tony. He wants to be Tony’s in every possible way and it’s not even the slightest bit crazy, because Steve knows, with every fiber of his being, that being held in Tony’s arms is the closest his life will ever get to ‘la vie en rose’.
Once outside the room, Steve leaned on the wall and closed his eyes. This whole thing was becoming very tiring. It was too late now, but maybe tomorrow he would go outside and just spend the day however he wanted to, not worrying about bad guys or insufferable men in high tech suits of armor.
). The weight of the car unbalanced him since he took it in a haste and didn't have time to calculate the best way to do it. While he righted and looked for a spot to dispose of the car his sensors picked up on something.
Steve shrugged his shoulders. He didn’t need to explain himself to them. But that apparently only made him more suspicious, as Clint and Natasha exchanged meaningful glances and even Bruce and Sam looked intrigued.
talk all night, but decided to keep that comment to himself. Instead, he said, a little bashfully, “I like listening to you talk.”
Watching the people cope, in those past five years, showed Steve one thing. Thanos was wrong. He left a world where the resources could thrive, perhaps, but that world was broken now. You can’t create a better world when the people suffer. Sure, they will try to move on. It’s in our bones, that need to keep going, to survive. But it’s not the same. People are not the same. The scars left run too deep.
Before she could respond, Clint joined them. “You know, man, I thought I was going to meet your boyfriend for the first time under different circumstances.”
But Steve had already seen him at his worst. So maybe he could tell Steve. Just Steve. He trusted Steve. But... “Maybe later? I'm tired now.” It's funny how much a panic attack can exhaust you.
It never came. Instead, the familiar sound came from behind Steve, the one he usually heard from above during the fights.
To make the matters even worse, ever since the gala, he couldn’t stop thinking about his conversation with Tony Stark.
“He had some project he had to work on, that’s why Janet took me in the first place,” Steve said. He hoped he wasn’t too off the mark.
Natasha smiled, any vulnerability she might have shown earlier long gone. “Like I said before... talk to him.”
When they went to bed that evening, they only cuddled up close to each other, too tired for anything else.
“No way, Steve,” Tony said, still looking at his boyfriend (sort of, kind of. They still haven't even had time to discuss it, dammit) with wide eyes.
Speaking of, a soft, “Come in,” made him open the door and smile at the obviously overworked, but still looking composed as ever, Peggy Carter.
Bruce stayed in the van to oversee the coms, while the rest of them got out and with a quick nod spread out. They designed the entrance plans by looking at the grainy images of the satellite maps. Steve would take the back entrance, Clint the first floor window and Natasha the side entrance. Sam and Thor stayed outside, as a backup.
Tony saw Steve coming toward him, to check on him or other such nonsense (nonsense considering Tony missed almost half of the fight) but he couldn't deal with that right now. He was pissed at Steve. Tony knew rationally that he couldn't have fought the stupidbots without his armor. But that didn't mean he was useless. He could've checked on the civilians, made sure everyone was safe. Maybe help the police hold the perimeter. Show them how to use a gun against the stupidbots (because even if it might not have killed them, the bullets would have at least damaged the robots so that it would be easier for the Avengers to then finish them off) or something. Anything really.
“What happened?” Tony asked. His voice was weak and shallow but Tony tried not to let it bother him. Bother him that Steve was hearing it.
“I... I can't, I'm sorry,” Tony said and he was avoiding Steve's gaze and he looked like he wanted to run, run from Steve, run from his feelings. “Please, just...”
Steve wanted to ask questions. He wanted to know what Tony was about to do. But he didn’t. Because he trusted him. So he nodded again, not saying anything.
Steve looked back at the menu. The prices weren’t written, and the names of the dishes didn’t make any sense. Steve was so out of his element, and after five minutes of staring at the menu in total silence, he still didn’t know what to order.
Steve was livid, and Tony didn't even try to make a joke about him following him to his bedroom (bad time for inappropriate jokes, really Tony). The man paced a little and Tony sat down on the edge of his bed waiting for the inevitable pep-talk (but he had a feeling it was going to be so much worse. He wasn't wrong).
The worst of all was that everyone else liked Iron Man just fine. And Iron Man seemed to get along with everyone splendidly. It was only Steve he had a problem with. Only Steve he picked fights with.
He couldn’t stop thinking about the look on Tony’s face. The realization, the disbelief. And then the coldness, disgust. He’ll look at Steve like he looked at the Captain that day at the base. And this time Steve won’t be able to come to him later, hold him close and look at his easy smile. It will all be gone.
Before Steve could prod for more Natasha interrupted, “So we were thinking about sending him to Hell’s Kitchen, have him look around and send us data.”
“Yes,” Steve said, still suspicious. It was one of the things that annoyed him the most, the casual showcase of Iron Man’s ability to hack their private servers. It always seemed like a breach of trust.
"Maybe you could chill out, and follow my lead, since I'm the only one here who actually has a plan," Tony's voice was hard, unyielding, and it sounded so much like Iron Man's even without the voice modulator.
Tony was hesitant but didn't deny Steve access when Steve's tongue swiped over his bottom lip. That was all Steve really needed before he was kissing Tony even more desperately, tongue exploring, teeth clashing. It was everything Steve thought it would be and more.
He was just trying to have a normal, casual stroll through the park, he really was. With everything going on lately, he needed some time to clear his head. Steve was still mad at him and Tony didn't particularly look forward to smoothing that out.
This was one of those moments. Where you have to make a decision, and then you have to live with that decision. But at the end of the day, it was not a hard decision to make.
He had woken up, unsure. Tony was on the other side of the bed, curled around a pillow, his back to Steve. The sheet was barely covering his hips and Steve couldn’t help but stare. Tony had insisted on keeping on the shirt the night before, and while Steve had frowned, he didn’t protest, not wanting to make him uncomfortable. But now the shirt had ridden up a little bit, leaving his lower back exposed.
The van pulled up to a stop. The plan was simple. Go in unnoticed. Scout the area. Get out with the data. If seen, get out. If captured, call for help.
Steve stopped breathing. He was terrified of saying something and breaking the moment. But Tony was still looking at him intently, daring him to disagree.
The tattoo guy frowned. “No, no. That wouldn’t do. I can’t even see your face properly. That’s just bad manners.”
"I don't know," Tony said. "Maybe I'm just that much of an egoist." Before Steve could interrupt, "or maybe Iron Man was finally something I wanted to be noticed for. Known for. My legacy."
Tony took a deep breath, then started to fumble with his hands behind his back. Steve couldn’t see what he was doing but it looked like he was trying to reach for something. He wondered if Tony had a knife hidden in his sleeve and how the guards didn’t find it.
“I admit I am curious,” then he looked around, more closely this time. “I’m also curious on where you guys get your funding. You’re more advanced than I would have given you credit for.”
They fought for a while, neither letting the other gain much leverage at least until Doom seemed to be annoyed enough to finish the fight. He didn’t say much (he wasn't one of those chatty, monologuing villains) just that Tony was
Before he managed to get out of the room though, Steve grabbed his forearm, halting him mid step. “You know the reason,” he said softly, and Tony knew he was the only one meant to hear the words.
So, it was only natural that the idea of Iron Man working so closely with his team did not make him happy.
Before he got a chance to reply, a voice interrupted them. “Why are you two bickering again?” Natasha asked, walking into the room.
Still, he raised his fists in a familiar position and let his mind clear. There was nothing that could sharpen his focus quite like a good fight could.
“You would have to hold on very tightly,” Tony said. There was that teasing tone in his voice that Steve missed. “And you would have to trust me,” his voice grew somber. This wasn’t just about the flight. It was about so much more. Tony was opening up to him, and it was up to Steve if he wanted to hear more. And there was always going to be only one answer to that question.
It was always a bit nerve wracking to be at the SHIELD headquarters, him being who he was. It didn’t matter that the chance of someone figuring out his identity was as likely as an alien invasion.
And today was one of those days. They could do nothing but wait for Iron Man’s return and Steve was already getting impatient.
Still, impulsive decision or not, Tony was still not an idiot (in fact, some would even say the opposite) so instead of jumping in the fight he knew he couldn't win (as was evidenced last time when he was knocked on the head) he decided he needed a different tactic. Before his brain started working on multiple ways in which he could create little explosions (none of which seemed possible with no resources at hand), Tony spotted a guard, passed out from the gas, but clearly armed.
"You're welcome," he said, when Steve kept on staring. It was a snarky response, something Iron Man would have said. But also Tony, now that Steve thought about it, though with Tony, Steve would have found it more endearing.
She did. He didn’t interrupt her again, and his expression grew more somber as she continued speaking. As she was explaining, she showed him pictures they took that day, of his weapons and the base.
Steve stared at them for a long time. He always found the armor to be a beautiful work of art, even when the man inside it drove him mad.
“What, now?” Steve's eyes winded. He glanced over again at where Tony still didn't move from his position being wrapped up in the other guy's embrace (and Steve was really starting to hate that guy).
“It’s quite a long story. And not exactly…” he hesitated, looking around, “something you would tell in public.”
“I couldn’t have possibly,” she said. “Bloody hell, Steve, how did you even manage to meet Tony Stark?” then she seemed to realize something. “Was it for a job? Are you targeting him?”
“We had one short conversation. He just doesn’t seem as bad as some of the other high-class businessmen we’re usually dealing with. Like Hammer. So can we go back to talking about him and what you found out from Johnson?” he knew they meant well, but he didn’t want to talk to them about it. He didn’t know how he felt about the whole thing, and he didn’t want to make a big deal out of it.
Tony was professional and aloof and calculating. Everything you would expect him to be in front of strangers with unknown agendas. And all Steve wanted was to see Tony’s real smile and soft eyes.
Tony broke his stare and glanced around. Some people were staring at them openly, some less so, but nobody was close enough to hear what they were saying. Tony swallowed. “Steve.” And his voice sounded so small, so vulnerable. “Steve.” He repeated, like that was the only word he knew how to say.
Tony winced and vowed to pay for all the statues that were destroyed as he blew William Shakespeare's head off with a repulsor blast.
Now all Steve had to do was wait. He trusted Natasha’s ability to extract information but he was still anxious. He preferred the real fight, out in the open, not sneaking around and waiting, playing the part of someone he hated.
“Nobody said anything about protection Stark. They're going to babysit you and make sure everything goes according to plan.”
And while the words before hurt, the past not quite yet healed, these ones broke his heart. He felt numb, his whole body frozen. He knew Tony was talking about the team. The Captain, the organization. But it was Steve Rogers who heard those words, coming out of Tony Stark's mouth.
“Crap,” he murmured then removed the casing so he could look inside. “Oh my god,” Tony couldn't believe what he was seeing. It was impossible. “Guys... if this thing blows... it will wipe out more than half the city. And I'm not just talking Manhattan,” he turned toward his teammates, “I'm talking about entire New York.”
This was one of those times apparently and soon Steve was lost in the drawing, in the lines and the curves, in the light and dark shades his pencil left on the paper.
They waited in the hangar, where they usually met with Iron Man. They didn’t have a lot of outside guests, but the ones they did have knew that they had to keep the location of it a secret. It’s the reason his team was skeptical about inviting Tony here, but Steve knew that Tony would keep it a secret as well.
“Becomes serious,” he repeated, dully. “God, I don’t even know if he likes me. Or if he’s not only after a one night stand. I’m getting ahead of myself, Peggy. But I can’t stop thinking about him. He’s like a mystery I want to unravel, a case I want to solve. I can’t remember the last time I felt like that.”
But there was no time for questions. Later. They would talk about it later. They just had to get out of there first.
“I didn’t think you’d turn down a cause for celebration,” Bruce teased. Clint stuck his tongue out at him. “Very mature,” Bruce rolled his eyes.
Tony tried to hold on to his glare but the proximity seemed to be affecting him. “No,” he whispered, so quietly, that if they weren't standing so close Steve would have surely missed it.
Steve turned back to look. And dammit, but Iron Man was right. This never would have happened if Steve wasn’t so distracted by the other man. Now he’s never going to let him live this down.
Now that Steve could take a closer look at him, Stark didn’t look as put together as Steve had originally thought. He looked tired, that bone deep exhaustion that only came with no sleep for extended periods of time paired with constant work. Steve didn’t know how a man with no working hours could not find the time to sleep, but maybe he underestimated what it took to own a billion dollar company. If you judged it by looking at Stark, it didn’t really seem like an easy job.
She raised her eyebrows, which for a normal person wouldn’t be a strong reaction, but coming from her it showed exactly how surprised she was. “So it’s Tony now, huh?” she asked. When he didn’t answer she prompted, “Where?”
Steve hummed his agreement, sipping at the champagne. He wasn’t quite sure where to go from here, but Tony didn’t seem to have the same problem, steering them toward the couch and sitting down, close but not yet touching.
“We need to be subtle, Barton. That rules out you, Thor and Banner. So Rogers and Romanoff, as the two most professional members of the team, will go. And you will not complain.” Fury glared, as if daring them to disagree.
Tony felt a little bit guilty. Cap did have to change his so called 'battle plan' to come and protect Tony from being molested by the bad guys. And he was grateful, he really was. Sadly, in the true Tony Stark fashion, gratitude was not what came out of his mouth. “You didn't need to save me, I'm not some damsel in distress,” he hissed and knew he wasn't helping his case when Steve seemed to become even angrier.
Maybe he can have this one thing. Even when… Even if Steve changed his mind, Tony would still have this. He would have the memories and the knowledge that Steve Rogers wanted to be with him.
Tony continued. “And by the way, I still don’t understand why you assumed I was innocent. I’ll be the first one to admit that finding my weapons like that seems very suspicious.”
It was overwhelming suddenly, this thing in his chest that seemed to beat in time with Tony’s breath.
“You were right, Tony,” Steve repeated, amused. Then his expression turned serious again. “It’s just… You saved the whole city. And you did it without your suit. And no, I still don’t like you putting yourself in danger,” he added before Tony could get any ideas in his head. “But… you’re a hero. With or without Iron Man. And I’m proud of you.”
Steve was surprised at how disappointed he felt. Even when the conversation was a mind field to him, he still enjoyed it, just being in the presence of this man, who seemed more and more like a walking contradiction every time Steve talked to him. It was so refreshing after the people Steve had to usually deal with, that he didn’t want to ever stop talking to him.
So, Steve would give him the benefit of the doubt. Even if it risked everything they worked for so far.
“So, who did?” Clint asked then, too curious to stay away from the conversation any longer. “Do you know?”
But Steve wasn’t sure he wanted to. He liked having a purpose, having something to fight for, something to protect.
It was more frantic then Steve would've wanted, but he let Tony take control, direct the pace. Tony was beautiful like this, in his element, like when he was in the middle of a breakthrough and nothing short of apocalypse could've broken him out of the haze. He was all energy, sharp movements, quiet gasps against Steve's lips.
Stark’s eyes widened in surprise, but only for a second. “I must admit, it’s not what people usually approach me for, but thank you. It’s good to know there’s someone else here who came because of the kids.” Stark was looking at him as if seeing him for the first time, a note of interest in his eyes.
It was fascinating, watching them interact. Steve always thought that they would get along great if they met under normal circumstances. But these were not normal circumstances.
The words were a blow more than the others were. Tony seemed to realize it as soon as he said it, remembered the story of Bucky, and why this situation was so much more painful for Steve than it should have been. Tony's eyes were wide and regretful, and Steve felt a spark of pleasure at making him show emotion.
No one asked Natasha how she got him to talk. She wouldn’t have said anyway. And Steve personally didn’t want to know. There were parts of this job that weren’t pretty, but were sometimes necessary. This was one of those cases.
Iron Man was arrogant, flashy. His bright red and gold suit was the polar opposite from Steve’s subtle blacks and blues.
But Clint was still turned toward Sam. “This means that not only will we have to give a shovel talk to Tony Stark but Iron Man as well.”
Suddenly there was a hand on his shoulder. Tony flinched. The hand relaxed but didn't move, as if the person hesitated but didn't want to let go.
Tony smiled. “We were at each other’s throats so much back then. Couldn’t go through a conversation without disagreeing about something.”
Steve turned and there he was, Tony Stark himself, in ripped jeans and a band T-shirt, looking nothing like an unapproachable billionaire the media set him up to be.
“Let’s go home, then,” Tony whispered. He put the helmet on his face and wrapped his hands around Steve’s waist, holding him tightly. And Steve was left staring at that emotionless, cold mask again. But he knew who was in it now. And instead of the usual frustration, he felt only hope looking at the golden surface. He smiled, and he knew, with certainty, that the man inside smiled back.
Steve was pulled to too many different sides. His shoulder and knee were bleeding. He had a broken nose.
“So, what now? Your plan was to get here, do you have a plan on how to get out?” Steve asked, after a while.
And as he reached to pull Steve’s cowl of his face, Steve felt fear for the first time. Losing his secret identity meant he will lose his life as Steve Rogers. He will lose everything.
“Guys, come on, give him a break,” said Bruce. He always was the calm one in any situation. Steve was grateful for it.
Tony followed him, but Steve could hear hesitation in his steps. He didn't know how they managed to screw everything up so quickly. But even now, being confused and mad and hurt, everything he wanted to do was turn around and hold Tony, and not care about anything else.
“Sure,” Steve said, even though he knew he wouldn’t be able to concentrate on it. But he was next to Tony, and that was enough for him.
Steve shook his head. “You know I can't do that. He knows how I feel and if he's doing this in front of me, that just proves that he doesn't care,” he sneaked another glance at Tony and was surprised to find him already looking at Steve, while the other guy had his hand on Tony's chest and was still whispering in his ear, Tony's own hand still sitting low on the man's hip. Their eyes held for a couple of seconds, seconds where the world around them seemed to freeze and Steve couldn't breathe and... And then Tony looked away, looked at the man still clinging to him and said something that made the other guy laugh and Steve couldn't help but think it was a fake laugh, just like everything else about the man seemed to be fake, in that artificial way people seemed to be these days.
And Steve saw in that moment, more clearly than ever, how Tony was the same person as Iron Man. This was the person who could get under his skin with just a few words. Who could make him mad and frustrated and annoyed with a one liner. But it was also the person who could make him laugh more than anyone, who could make him feel happier than he’s been in a very long time.
The battlefield was grey. Dust settled over everything, covered even the brightest and shiniest of cars. Even Natasha's hair looked more brown than red, more dull than bright. Steve's eyes roamed over his teammates, worried. They all came back to him, all in one piece. All except for one.
Steve was about to start speaking when Natasha interrupted. “We could have Bruce make a virus. You’d slip it into Stark’s computer and download everything on it.”
Tony didn’t respond, seemingly lost in the screens, but Steve could tell he was worried in the tense lines of his shoulders.
He walked down the stairs separating the platform he was on from the rest of the room in a daze. He thought he should have probably waited another time because Tony was still taking to that other guy and Steve felt awkward. But before he could back off, Tony lifted his head and looked straight at him, raising a questioning eyebrow. 'No backing away now, he already noticed me' was Steve's last thought before he was standing in front of Tony and the guy.
Steve would have recognized Tony even if he didn’t know he was coming. Even with the bag over his head.
A face in question was resting on the man's other hand and appeared to be deep in sleep but even so, there were frown lines crinkling his face and for a moment Tony wondered
Steve’s stomach turned. No, of course Tony didn’t know about him. And now he was going to find out. He was going to find out in the worst possible way, and Steve won’t even be there to explain.
right. “Yes, but this just seems… so impossible, you know? Like I’m making it something that it isn’t, in my head.”
“Right,” Steve said, “I was just surprised you knew that. Many of the people I talked to today didn’t seem to have a clue.” Neither did Steve for that matter, but he was here for a job not the charity so he thought he was excused.
They moved toward each other, almost in a trance. It was like the world ceased to exist, this moment frozen in time. But their lips touched for barely a fracture of a second before Tony put his hand on Steve’s chest, halting him.
Steve had to breathe deeply to calm himself. This was not the worst breach of privacy Iron Man has ever done, and it was common enough that mostly everyone got used to it, but Steve got angry every time it happened.
Steve paused. He tried to think if any businessman ever, big or small, had ever asked him to call them by their first name. He didn’t have to have a perfect memory to know that the answer was
Tony closed his eyes. “What do you want from me, Steve?” the words were sharp, but in a way that showed vulnerability behind it.
“Yeah, well, it just pushed the whole thing back a little. Pepper told me we should do it slowly. Keep the damage to a minimum,” Tony said.
They moved on to safer topics, then. Tony was still very much interested in Steve’s life, so Steve started talking about his friends. There was no way that Tony would connect them to the organization, and he would have to meet them at some point in time if this thing between them continues.
“No problem,” Tony smiled, and Steve was so relived he didn’t lose it, this warm and affectionate Tony with his soft smiles and his warm eyes. “Now, I’m sending a message back to Widow that I’m bringing you back to the base in an hour. Is that okay? I thought we could talk some more before confronting your friends.”
“Fri, put something on, please,” Tony said, and a moment later the TV turned on. Steve didn’t recognize the movie but the action sequences were enough to keep his attention. Or they would have been, if Steve wasn’t so painfully aware of Tony beside him, his every shift and turn. His eyes were bright from the TV light, and he seemed focused on the screen, though Steve knew he wasn’t paying much attention to it either.
