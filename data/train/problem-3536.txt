“Yeah.” Dean said, still feeling a little dazed. Jimmy bent over him.
If Gabriel was in his right mind, he might actually be scared with how easily Sam can distract him.
“Are you sure that’s the best idea, Dean? I mean, what if he could help us get rid of her? The best way to beat a witch is with another one, you know that. And Casmiria herself has told us that he’s a very powerful one. Maybe he can help us.” Sam said. Dean paused to think about it. On one hand, it was a good idea. Rid the world of the plague of that witch(bitch). On the other hand, if they went wrong, Cas would get turned back into a baby. Along with some other dire consequences, he was sure.
Castiel rolled over with a grunt, grabbing for the book on his bedside table.  He turned on his lamp, and propped himself up with some pillows. He'd might as well read, since there wasn't anything else for him to do. No one was up this time of night, not that he could talk about what was bothering him with anyone anyway. Admitting to the affair in his head was one thing, but saying it out loud was an entire other. He didn't want to admit that he was a home wrecker.
Castiel had no illusions about what was going to happen. If Castiel was lucky, it would explode violently, with harsh words and accusations, and Castiel could nurse a bit of hate in his heart to hide the hurt. But more likely, it would just...be over. No more phone calls, no more late night meet-ups, no more seedy motels that take cash in exchange for silence. It would all just be...over. After all, that was the way the world ended. Not with a bang, but with a whimper.
Sam, Bobby and Jo were all sitting on the couch, watching one of the old Claymation Christmas movies on the ancient television set. When the door shut, they all turned and looked at them. Dean felt Castiel freeze and put a reassuring hand on the small of his back.
“Yes.” Gabriel said, smirking and taking a step closer to Sam.
Dean settled between Castiel’s legs, kissing his lips once again, his hand cradling Castiel’s face. Again, this was very unlike Dean, but the difference was pleasant so he didn’t mind very much. Dean gradually moved his kisses, working his way down Castiel’s jaw to his neck, sucking lightly on his pulse point before moving down to kiss and nip at his bare chest.
“It’s a different sensation to fly as a human. Be prepared.” Gabriel nodded. Cas reached out and suddenly they were surrounded by strollers. Sam looked at Gabriel.
Gabriel spread his hands out with an ever bigger smile. “In the flesh. Although, it didn’t exactly happen like that…”
“I guess that’s my cue.” He stood up and made his way to the door. He nodded at Dean, then at Cas, and disappeared out the door, muttering something about brain bleach. Dean looked at Cas and started to laugh again. Cas stared down at the floor.
“It’s okay.” Sam replied, picking the chair up off the floor and setting it right.
The ride from KU to Sioux Falls, South Dakota was somewhere around six hours, depending on how many stops Dean had to make. Luckily, Castiel was an excellent road trip companion. He didn’t complain about cramping up or how long it was taking, and handed Dean drinks and snacks without a single compliant, though he did draw the line at holding a bottle for Dean to pee in. (It had been a joke anyway, but Castiel’s reaction had made Dean smile.
look at his hipbones. Dean’s gaze wondered down to his muscular thighs and then back up to his chest. Jesus, Dean had never seen someone so hot so close to him. Maybe it was the alcohol, but he suddenly wanted nothing else but to have this guy in his lap.
“So when are we going to the mysterious cabin?” he asked, taking the bottle of water and aspirin that Sam offered him. Dean raised his eyebrow but decided not to poke the sleeping bear.
Like the upcoming conversation with their sort of friend that Dean had to, not only apologize for being an ass but also convince that same friend to help them even though Dean was a colossal dick bag to him.
Read the note at the end, please :)
Also, there is the lingering problem of the witch that has taken and is still taking people and may or may not be hell-bent on revenge on them.
None of the rest of the guys were anything spectacular, really. The one who called himself Aaron was cute, but Dean found himself anxiously anticipating whatever Jimmy was going to do to him. (He also wondered what was with all these strippers having such
“He said that he would give me my powers back. All I had to do was bring him Sam and Dean Winchester.” She laughed. “The Black Cord Binding Ritual is a powerful spell.” she said, looking at Andrew. “Of course, that little bit of magic is nothing compared to the power of my new consort.”
“Of course it’d be
It’s not like he couldn’t catch up.
Where the clothes he had had on went, Dean didn’t know. He only knew that Cas was cuddling up to Dean. Naked. Dean looked around and didn’t see Sam or Gabriel. Gently, he began to pry Cas’ fingers from his shirt. The angel stirred slightly but didn’t wake up. Dean thanked God that Sam and Gabriel hadn’t witnessed that scene. They would never let him live that down.

So here's Chapter Nine, guys! Thank you for all the comments, I promise I'll get around to answering them all. Until then, enjoy!
to look. I mean, maybe it was just because he had been a baby but to Dean, Cas was absolutely beautiful. Maybe it had taken Cas being an infant to make Dean see it, but hell, he was hot. Dean shook his head.
Chapter 22: The plan? What plan?
“Ho-how did he…?” he blabbered, pointing at Gabriel. “Bu-but these are…and then he…but now he’s…what?” The poor man looked so confused that Gabriel laughed at him as he handed him the clothes.
Sam spoke up. “But it’ll be during the day. Doesn’t that matter?” Andrew shook his head.
“Gabe?” Sam called out, warily stepping down the aisle. His eyes swept up and down the shelves, and a part of his brain noted that they were back where they had begun, in the aisle with the strollers.
The only thing Gabriel can think about right now is how
“That was kind of formal, don’t you think, Sammy?” Gabriel asked, grinning and nudging Sam. Sam bitch-faced Gabriel as well and turned away from both of them. Dean was still laughing in the background.
“Why did it have to be kids?” He asked no one in particular. Cas hummed and kissed Dean’s hair.
“I don’t care. I’m ready.  Please, Daddy. Fuck me.” Cas said, sitting up and grabbing Dean’s shoulders. Dean swallowed and gave up, sliding his fingers out and grabbing the bottle of lube again and squirting some more onto his hand and he slicked himself up. Cas whined at the loss, but Dean was quick with lining himself up with Cas’ puckered hole. He took a deep breath and pushed in slowly. Cas moaned and wrapped his legs around Dean, urging him to go faster,  but Dean resisted. He was big, and he didn’t want to hurt Cas. Castiel wasn’t having any of it, and leaned up, wrapping his arms around Dean and pulling him hard against him. Dean moaned as he bottomed out, much faster than he had anticipated. He huffed and pushed Cas back down.
Last Chapter for today!
“It wouldn’t be the first time!” Dean yelled back, still trying to throw Cas’ hand off. He might as well have tried to throw off a brick wall. “Hell, Sam we’ve done more dangerous things than that when we were teenagers! Why in the hell are you choosing now to go all ‘safe’ and ‘conservative’!?” Sam stood up straight, seeming taller than normal as he looked down at Dean.
"Or we could share." Castiel suggested, stepping into the room just as Dean turned the light on. Dean almost swallowed his tongue.
“He looks…okay. I mean smaller, obviously. But okay.” Sam said, looking at Dean for confirmation.
“Of course, Dean. My apologies.”
“Are you hungry?” Cas nodded. Dean walked into the kitchen and began to prepare a bottle. When it was finished he transferred Cas from his shoulder and cradled him. Cas accepted the bottle without complaint this time. Dean started to walk around the kitchen as he was feeding him.
“Then we’ll force her. Either way, she’s not getting away with this crap again.” Dean knew he sounded confident, even if everyone knew that it was all a bunch of crap. Sam gave him a half-hearted smile, saying without words that he appreciated Dean’s effort.
“What time is it?” he asked, frowning. Sam consulted his watch.
“Yes. I found it…illuminating. Girl world is a complex place.” Castiel stared off in the distance for a moment before turning his attention back to Dean with what could best be described as an incredibly impatient expression. Dean sighed again, finally admitting defeat.
“This is what, the first time you’ve ever done it? How can you say that you don’t like it?” Gabriel glared at him.
“You boys think I’m that foolish?” Casmiria said, turning to them from her vigil at the window. She looked at Castiel. “How are you still powered up? My warding…”
He decided that a shower was just what he needed to feel better this morning.
He knows that he’s family, that the Winchester’s would go through hell to get him back or help him if he needed it. He knows that he’s more than just a useful tool for the Winchester’s to use. He knows that the only reason Mick used those words was because Dean had used them just moments before.
“Sam.” Dean started, “This is, uh, Amanda Wilson.” Sam looked confused for another second before recognition flashed across his face.
to reverse it?” Sam said. “I mean, it would be easier than looking through
“So…then talk to me.” Cas said, using his thumb to rub soothing circles in the back of his hand. Dean swallowed nervously.
“Look, we are going to go along with your plan to bind Casmiria’s powers. But listen here, asshat, you do everything I say, capiche? No matter if you agree or not, you follow our lead, you understand me?” Dean growled. Andrew nodded.
"Maybe." Castiel said. "I'm sure you'll keep trying in the meantime."
“Do I need to leave again…?” Dean asked raising an eyebrow.
Cas woke up to the sound of the television. He stretched, and closed his eyes again, intent on getting more sleep. At least until he realized that he was alone. He hadn’t noticed it at first because of Dean’s jacket. It smelled like the man. Cas started to squirm, worried that something had happened to the hunter. He struggled to push the jacket off of him but it was too heavy. He started to cry out of frustration.
From: Castiel
Once Dean was finished inspecting the room, Cas walked up behind him and wrapped his arms around the man. Dean made a noise of contentment in the back of his throat and tilted his head back. Cas placed a gentle kiss on his cheek and then pulled away.
“All you have to do is.” he snapped his fingers. “And you’re dressed. Not fair.” Castiel rolled his eyes fondly.
“Shuddup. At least I’m not a moose.” He hit Sam’s arm again. “Put me down. I think I can walk.” Sam complied and gingerly sat Gabriel down, holding his arms until he took a few steps. Sam let go and Gabriel looked up at him, took a step and then he took off his little legs carrying him surprisingly fast towards the bathroom.
Chapter 9: Cabins and Altars
Next Chapter!
To: Castiel
something? HA!” he said. “If anything
me?” she yelled, raising her hand and tossing Sam to the side. He didn’t get as lucky as Dean, crashing into her china cabinet. He fell to the ground and stayed there. Castiel raised his shotgun and shot the witch directly in the back. She whirled, absolutely unfazed by the fatal bullet wound in her heart.
“So, you find anything?” he asked, his mouth full. Sam gave him patented bitchface No. 3.
The ride back was mostly silent, as both of them were eating. It wasn't as akward as it had been once upon a time. They had lunch together almost every day, after all. It was one of the only times that they could be together without anyone asking questions. Most people at the office knew that they were friends, so it wasn't a strange thing.
“It’s okay, Dean. Come on, let go for me.” the angel whispered. Dean couldn’t hold it back anymore; he threw his head back as he came with a wordless cry, coloring both of their stomachs with come. Castiel kept stroking him, swiveling his hips and working Dean through the rest of his orgasm. Just as Dean was coming down from his high, the angel on top of him stiffened, and Dean felt the angel’s warm come paint his insides. It was a strange feeling, for sure, but not unpleasant. It was actually kind of nice, knowing that Castiel was marking him, both inside and out.
“We need to…” Sam started, but Dean cut him off.
Castiel’s brows furrowed. “Even without my powers, I do not cease to be an angel.”
“Okay.” The three others chimed in together. Dean rolled his eyes and turned away, settling on the bed that wasn’t occupied. He could already tell this was going to be a long night.
That was probably the most disturbing thing that had happened yet.
“I dunno. He said something about not being able to stand the sexual tension…”
“Kind of.” Andrew said. “I scattered the ashes, so that it would be even more difficult, but…yeah, essentially. They saw past my cloaking spell I put on them, too.”
“Hello! You seem a bit lost, can I help you?” Dean instantly felt jealously flare up in his chest at the way she said it.
“She’s probably looking to kill me anyway. And all of you, too.” He scowled for a minute and then sighed. “And probably some other people who breathed at her the wrong way.” Andrew stood up then, and stretched. “I’m tired of talking. I’m going to go find some alcohol and get drunk. You all are welcome to join me if you want.” He ran his hand through his hair and turned towards the door.
(See the end of the chapter for
How were they going to make her change him back? Sam had been right – they didn’t have anything that Casmiria wanted. Well, with the exception of their heads on a stake. But that was something that Dean just wasn’t willing to give her. They may be able to offer not to kill her if she changed Gabriel back, but that would only work if they got her in that position. Not to mention the fact that they wouldn’t even be sure if an age-reversal spell was the one she would be casting.
When they pulled into the hotel parking lot moments later, Dean cut the car off and stepped out without saying a word. Cas followed him quietly as he went to the motel room and opened the door, leaving it ajar so Cas could come through as well.
“Gabriel, what…who is that!?” Sam said, looking back and forth between the angel and the baby.
Unexpected, yes. In fact, it was the last person either of them had ever expected to see again.
“It’s worked so far.” Castiel shrugged. He turned towards Dean. “I hope Sam will be okay.”
“Looks can be deceiving.” He said as he climbed out of the vehicle. Sam quickly followed leaving Dean alone in the car. Dean sighed and got out, opening the back door so he could get Cas out. The little angel was silent as he gazed out at the building.
“Let me have control, tonight, Dean?” He pulled away and kissed his neck. “I want to make love to you.” he whispered. Dean’s heart was in his throat. They didn’t do slow, not normally. It was usually fast and rough, each of them desperate to get to the other’s bodies. Dean nodded and relaxed into the bed, giving Cas all semblance of control.
“It was my mothers. My family is originally from England.” She gestured for them to sit down, more telling than asking, but that seemed to be her usual way. Dean sat in a chair as far away from the couch as possible, so she couldn’t sit by him or more importantly, Cas. Sam and Gabriel sat on the couch and Casmiria sat in the chair on the other side of it. She poured the tea into the teacups and passed them around. They all accepted, but nobody took a drink. She didn’t seem surprised.
“Be. Patient.” he growled, causing Cas mewl in frustration. It was already taking all of his self-control to not pound his boyfriend into the mattress. Dean sped up slowly, biting his lip as Castiel contracted around him. The fucker was doing that shit on purpose. When Cas clenched tight once more, Dean’s self-control snapped. He started to thrust harder, faster, holding his boyfriend against the mattress as he pounded into him.
“What’s wrong, Cas?” Dean said, standing up immediately and going to the angel, putting his hands on his elbows. Castiel took a deep breath and looked down, biting his lip. It worried Dean, because he’d never seen the angel so nervous before. “Whatever it is, you can tell me, Cas.”
“I know, I know. I gotta go find Andrew and apologize to him for being a colossal douche.” Dean grimaced and looked at Sam. “Do you know where he is?” Sam nodded.
“Cas, c’mon, man, ‘m ready.” he said, his hips coming up to meet each thrust of Castiel’s fingers. The angel must have decided that Dean had had enough because he pulled his fingers out and found the lube bottle again. Dean had to remind himself how to breathe as he heard Castiel slicking himself up.
Dean reacts just as Castiel knew he would, his hand sliding up into the angel’s hair and holding him, his tongue licking at the seam of Castiel’s lips until they part for him, granting Dean’s tongue the access it was asking for.
“I was barely gone for 6 hours, Cas.” The man nuzzled his neck.
He wasn’t disappointed. Gabriel only got in a handful of strokes before Sam was pulling away and digging through the bedside drawer for lube. He grinned to himself. He knew exactly how to work Sam into giving him what he wanted without having to ask for it. Sam stripped them both of their underwear and lubed up his fingers in record time. Gabriel felt a cold, lube coated finger against his entrance and he opened his legs a little wider. He smiled at the look on Sam’s face.
“Would she even recognize him, though? Do you think she saw him as a baby?” Gabriel asked, twirling his sucker. Sam shrugged again.
“I’m...dammit.” Dean looked at the ground again. “I was wrong, okay? I was angry and I wanted to fight and I took it out on you. I’m sorry.” Dean glared determinedly at the ground.
“Do you remember when it used to be
“Do you want me to put it together?” he asked, looking up at them. “I mean, I am the only actual witch in attendance.” he pointed. Sam looked at Dean, who shrugged.
“No, just…put some clothes on.”
“We found him on a park bench cuddled with a bottle of Jack, Dean. I have no idea where he would have gone.” Dean sighed and rolled his eyes.
Dean had no idea, but he'd seen the two of them together before. At one of the office parties that Castiel never attended. Dean didn't know that he was there, but he'd seen her. She was beautiful, too. Tall and dark-haired, with big brown eyes and a figure most men would die for. Seeing her, with her arm slung through Dean's, showing Castiel everything that he would never be able to have with me man he was then only beginning to love.
Dean busted out laughing. “That was hilarious.” he said. Castiel tilted his head in confusion but obviously, he decided not to dwell on it. Taking a deep breath, he said
“Hey.” Gabriel complained, making Sam stop. “I’m not going to be the only shirtless one. This is an equal opportunity relationship. Off with it, Gigantor.” Sam rolled his eyes but complied, shrugging his shirt off and throwing it in Gabriel’s face. The archangel grabbed it threw it on the floor.
” Gabriel rolled his eyes. “But it wouldn’t be right. We have a chance to rid the world of something evil. Isn’t that your whole spiel? ” He asked, glancing between Sam and Dean. Dean had to do a double take.
“Not even worth talking about. We didn’t get anything useful from any of them.”
"I certainly hope so." Castiel teased. He didn't want to bring up the time, because they were almost late. He didn't want his time to with Dean to end. One day, maybe. One day maybe they wouldn't have to sneak blowjobs on their lunch breaks.
“I knew she was trying to learn it, but I didn’t know she succeeded.” he said.
“What for?” he asked and Dean shook his head.
“The only thing we’re gonna need your help with is that damn tree tomorrow. That’s why I keep you young’uns around so my old bones don’t have to do that anymore.” He clapped him on the shoulder and then sat back down. Now that the introductions were over, Dean walked up to Castiel. “Come on, I’ll show you my room.” He said, nudging Castiel towards the stairs. “We’ve been on the road for a while, we’ll probably just go to bed. Goodnight, everyone.” There was a chorus of ‘goodnights!’ thrown back at the two of them as they climbed the stairs.
But ever since Castiel had told him that he’d never had a real Christmas, Dean had been trying to convince him to come to home with him for Christmas. Bobby and Ellen wouldn’t care, and Sam had heard enough about him that he was dying to meet him two. And this year he had finally succeeded in convincing him.
Dean stood in the shower a few minutes later. He could hear Cas moving around in the next room. He had dropped a hint that Cas should join him in the shower, but the comment had apparently went right over the angel’s head. He should have known better than to try and be subtle about it. Cas needed to be hit in the face with something before he noticed it. He sighed internally. Oh well.
“Was it a witch?” Dean asked. Another nod. Dean was getting really excited now. Sam and Gabriel both stood back and watched him, trying not to laugh.
“I hate it when kids are involved. It makes everything so much harder.”
“I love you.” Castiel whispered against his lips.
“Go away!” he called, seeking out Castiel’s warmth, which wasn’t far away.
“Lie back.” the angel said, and Dean obeyed, laying back on the bed and staring up at Cas. The angel gave Dean a wicked smile that sent a thrill of anticipation straight to his dick. Castiel started to rub his hands up Dean’s legs. The hunter wanted nothing more than to thrust up into his lover’s hand but he knew better. If he does Castiel will stop, and right now that was the last thing the wanted.
He wants Sam inside of him, right now.
He deserved it, if he had.
“I think…was a man here? Dean?” he asked. The memory was fuzzy, but he could have sworn.
“I wished to see if I could still use my ‘angel mojo’. Also, he will be more compliant this way.” Dean laughed. Sam came to stand beside the two of them.
to lead to heartbreak.
“Dean? Cas? I need you to open the door, and make sure you are decent when you do. We’ve got some….unexpected company.” Dean and Cas exchanged a look and suddenly they were both dressed, thanks to Cas’ angelic abilities. Dean moved to open the door to see Sam standing beside Gabe. Cas could make out a figure behind them but he wasn’t sure who it was until Sam reached back and pulled him into the light. Dean did a double take and reached out for Cas, who stared at the man in complete awe.
Dean looked at the envious looks he was getting from the crowd as he stood up shakily. Two guys dressed in black had placed a chair in front of the main pole, which was where Dean was directed as soon as he climbed onto the stage. Hopefully, they couldn’t see him shaking. “Hello, there, Ken doll.” Gabriel said, climbing into his lap. “I bet you didn’t expect this when you came in here this evening.” Dean managed to shake his head. “So what brings you here on this fine evening? If you don’t mind me saying, you are way too hot to be single.” The crowd cheered, obviously agreeing with Gabriel. Damn, if that wasn’t an ego boost.
“Like a potty chair?” Cas said. He had migrated over to Sam’s laptop and was now looking up toddler-care items. “It says here that they will be helpful in potty training, since most toddlers aren’t able to reach a toilet.” Sam could feel Dean’s grin before he even looked at him.
“Nah, just he’s still sleeping and I was bored and I figured we hadn’t got to spend much time together lately, you know, and just talk. So…how are things?” Dean was still suspicious.
“So, which of you are staying here first?” Dean asked, breaking the silence as he finished forcing baby Cas into a onesie.  Gabriel cleared his throat.
“We don’t know how to kill her, Dean.” Sam said. Dean snorted and started towards the cabin.
He stood up quickly.
Amanda looked stunned. “So…w-when he said Gabriel…” she gestured at Andrew. “he meant…the Gabriel? With Mary and the horn and all of that?”
To: Castiel
(See the end of the chapter for
“But…how? I mean, I don’t know where I am but I’m pretty sure…” he started, and was cut off by Dean.
The pills were in his hand before he could make the decision. Without Dean, there wasn’t any reason for him not to. He closed the medicine cabinet, pills in hand, and walked to his bedroom. It would be so easy. And no one would miss him. Would anyone even find him? How long would he lay there?
“Food run.” Sam answered his unspoken question. “Amanda said she needed to get out of the room and everyone else decided to go with her.” He smiled. “I think Andrew’s developing a thing for her.” he said, eyes glinting with the mischief Gabriel loved so much.
“Why don’t you do it?” Sam said after a moment. Dean shrugged.
“What do you mean, as long as the knots stay tied?” he asked.
He isn’t disappointed. There were cigarette burns in the carpet and comforter was torn in three different places, and had been clumsily repaired. There were also hard water stains in the sink and toilet. When he pulls the comforter back on the bed, at least the white sheets are still white, and he determined –after a thorough search – that no stains were visible. Cas had watched him the entire time with a smirk on his face. He was used to Dean by now.
“It’s when a witch’s power is the strongest, especially one like Casmiria. Or at least, how she was when I knew her.”
“Baby!” he yelled, jumping into the air and running towards his the Impala. Gabriel smiled and nudged Sam. Dean had hurriedly unlocked the car and quickly gotten into the driver’s seat. By the time Sam and Gabriel got to the car, Dean was petting the steering wheel and promising never to leave her again. Gabriel and Sam just looked at each other and then away, shaking their heads. Cas was sitting on his leg, having been deposited there when Dean got into the car. It took Dean 5 minutes to notice the addition to the backseat of his car.
“Wish I could say, Deano. But chances are we aren’t going to like it very much.” Suddenly, Casmiria swept through the room again, the hem of her dress flying cape-like out behind her. She walked to the old desk in the corner of the room and withdrew a folded piece of paper and a long quill out from her dress. A quill? Dean thought. He knew that she was eccentric (to say the least) but a quill? That was taking ‘eccentric’ to the edge and diving off with it. She opened a bottle of ink and dipped the quill into it before hastily scratching something onto the piece of paper. The three men just watched, occasionally giving one another questioning looks. After what seemed like a lifetime she finally turned around.
Hello! Sorry it's been so long, but I have another couple of Chapters for you today! Enjoy!
Jimmy moved closer, but Dean couldn’t tear his eyes away from the trail of hair that disappeared into the bright red G-string barely holding anything back. Dean’s mouth was dry as he tilted his head up, trying to get a look at his face now that he was closer.
“Can I have my arm back, Cas?” Cas paused mid-yawn and looked down at their hands. He let go quickly.
shirt to clean up.” he grumbled, grabbing Sam and pulling him up so he could kiss him. He let his hands start to wonder over Sam’s shoulders, feeling the tight muscles coiled beneath the skin. He sighed happily, pulling Sam against him as he lay on his back once again. Sam kissed his lips for a minute before he moved to continue kissing down his body. Gabriel gave up trying to talk and just watched as Sam craved a path of nips and licks down to his pants. Sam made quick work of the button on Gabe’s pants and pulled them off, leaving his underwear on. Sam rose up onto his knees and unbuttoned his jeans, letting them slide down as he moved to up to capture Gabe’s mouth. The archangel kissed him deeply, gently probing at Sam’s lips with his tongue to encourage him to open his mouth. Sam slid his tongue out to tangle with Gabriel’s as he adjusted their position and started to move their hips together. Gabriel almost grasped. The feeling of Sam moving against him, even being separated by clothes, always surprised Gabriel. He loved the intensity of the motion, the strangled little moans Sam would make, everything. Gabriel swallowed every moan that his lover made, kissing him until he had to break away to breathe. He wrapped his arm and legs around Sam and pushed his hips up to meet every thrust, until he couldn’t handle the clothed touches anymore. He needed more, dammit. He reached between their bodies and gripped Sam through his underwear, squeezing and massaging gently. Sam’s thrusts sped up and he started pressing wet, feverish kisses into Gabriel’s neck.
“Have you taken anything?” he asked, causing Dean to roll his eyes.
Dean was awoken rather suddenly the next morning by someone banging on the door. Dean groaned and rolled back, burying his head into the pillow.
Don't hate me for Dean, okay? I'll fix it, I promise.
“It’s not of import, I was just under the impression that…
“Yeah, we’re fine. Got a lead, though. Katie’s mom saw a woman a couple of days before she disappeared.”
“But then, he came to me.” The dreamy quality of her voice caused Dean to look back at her.
need to know about my brother’s sex life. Seeing Cas naked was bad enough.” Sam said, grimacing at the memory. Gabriel chuckled, knowing all about the way Cas had come out of the bathroom naked when Sam was talking to Dean. Sam’s face fell slightly and he sighed again. Gabriel hugged him, his head barely coming up to the middle of his chest.
Castiel had given Dean permission to touch them, and it hadn’t been until his fingers had come into contact with the ink that he realized there were upraised lines crisscrossing all over his back. Most of them lined up with the feathers, probably on purpose, and unless someone knew about them, they wouldn’t be able to tell until they touched. Most people probably assumed they were scars where Castiel’s body had reacted badly to the ink and didn’t ask.
That was Dean’s problem. He didn’t trust Andrew.
To: Castiel
“Much better. Sexier, too.” he said into Cas’ chest. “Go to sleep, Cas.” He felt more than heard Castiel’s soft chuckle.
“I’m about to be.” he said, cheekiness evident in his tone. Gabriel decided he wasn’t going to grace that statement with an answer. He felt a second lube-coated finger at his entrance and bucked down, trying to get it in. Sam slid the second finger in, working it with the other to scissor Gabriel open. The archangel couldn’t help but throw his head back. He was glad once again (as he often was during sex) that he was an angel and therefore was prepped much quicker than any normal person. (That may also have something to do with the frequency in which they had sex, but he’s not thinking about that now.) In no time Sam is pushing a third finger in, stretching and opening Gabe up so sex wouldn’t hurt that much.
“What?” he asked, confused.
Dean smiled and went back to work. 20 minutes later, it became very apparent that Dean wasn’t going to get anymore work done, now that he knew Castiel was at home alone, waiting for him in the bathtub. He cursed as he started to pack things up. This had probably been Cas’ angle the entire time. He walked out of the back room he used as an office and walked into the main part of the garage. He saw Charlie sitting at the desk and walked up to her.
“It figures.” Dean said, making Cas raise his eyebrow in confusion. “I try to tell you how much you mean to me with some big romantic speech and you come back with one that just blows mine out of the water.” he said, and Cas smiled.
They did have a foolproof way of killing Casmiria this time, though, so that’s something.
There was a brief scuffling noise and a voice yelled “One minute!” Dean rolled his eyes. If he and Cas could refrain from jumping each other the moment they were alone those two should have definitely been able to. He leaned back against the wall outside and crossed his arms, looking at Cas.
“Did I miss something?” he asked.
“You are an infuriating man, Dean Winchester.” Cas said, stepping closer. “It seems the closer I get to you, the further you push me away.” Cas reached out, grabbed Dean’s arm and tugged the man closer to him. “You are ruthless, and reckless to the point that you don’t seem to care whether you live or die.” Cas looked down and entwined their fingers. “In a way, that is one of the reasons I love you. You would do anything to help someone else, and that is beautiful.” Cas looked back up into Dean’s face. Dean opened his mouth to apologize again but Cas shook his head. “Let me finish. Sacrificing yourself for someone else is a noble cause. But you are worth more than to foolishly throw your life away. I know Sam agrees with me.” Cas let go of Dean’s hands and placed his hands on Dean’s waist instead. Dean felt his heart race as Cas leaned forward and put his head on Dean’s chest, directly over his heart. “If you won’t stay alive for yourself, Dean, then do it for us.” Cas said, the words muffled against his chest. He slid his arms around Dean’s waist and he squeezed. “Do it for me.” Dean had to swallow past a lump in his throat. He didn’t deserve this. He didn’t deserve Cas’ forgiveness him. And he always did. No matter how bad Dean had messed up, no matter what he said, Cas has always forgiven him. Dean wrapped his arms around Cas and kissed the top of his head.
“Dean?” Sam asked, coming around the couch. He saw the altar and cursed. “So it is a witch.” he said. Dean nodded.
“There’s been another disappearance.”
"Hey, baby." Dean's voiced answered him, like a warm wave crashing over his body.
It’s always been ridiculously easy to distract Dean with sex. Ever since they had admitted that this thing was real, that the casual touches and longing glances weren’t as platonic as they both had convinced themselves that they were, Dean had always, as he would say, ‘been down’ for sex.
Gabriel sighed and rested his head on Sam’s massive chest. He focused on the steady rise and fall of the hunter’s chest, allowing it to lull him into a restful sleep.
So, yeah, bigger fish than Gabriel being his general douche-baggy self.
“So, are you ready to hunt some witches?”
“Umm, Dean?” Sam grabbed Dean’s shoulder and pointed towards the house the man had come from. The curtain was open and a woman in a bathrobe and curlers was on the phone, babbling and pointing at them. Dean cleared his throat.
“Castiel?” he called, making a b-line for the bedroom. Ah, there he was. Asleep. Dean crept quietly into the room.
They’d drank way too much that night and ended up falling asleep together on the couch. Dean had woken up with his head pillowed on Castiel’s thigh and Castiel’s head on his stomach, one arm thrown haphazardly around his waist.
“My apologies.” He said. It wasn’t that Dean minded all to terribly that Cas was so close-in fact, he loved it. Sharing the same breaths as the Angel always made him light headed and weak in the knees. Which was exactly why it couldn’t happen. If Cas stayed
“Winchesters.” He agreed, sounding exasperated. Gabriel heaved a sigh and then got up from the bed, walking over to Cas and clapping his hand on his shoulder.
Dean looked up through his lashes, just because he wanted to see the look on Castiel's face. The other man's head was thrown back, his mouth wide open, whispering praises that Dean wished he could hear. Castiel was always very free with his praise. It was one of Dean's favorite things about fucking him. That, and how beautiful Castiel looked when he was lost in pleasure.
So that’s what he did. They changed clothes and fell into the bed, curling around each other so that they lost track of whose limbs were whose. Cas sighed and mumbled something that sounded suspiciously like ‘I love you’ before kissing Dean lightly and going to sleep. Dean was up for a while longer.
The first thing Dean noticed was that it was too quiet. He saw Sam shake his head as he made his way around the house. So, there was nothing. He climbed the porch slowly, being mindful of the fact it could collapse at any time. It creaked under the weight of the five of them as Dean pushed open the front door.
“Yours.” Cas agreed. “Only yours. No one else’s.” Dean nodded and started to thrust faster, harder into Cas. The angel moved to Dean’s back, and Dean idly thought Cas wouldn’t be the only one to have wings come morning. Dean felt Cas spasm beneath him and knew the angel was close.
“Like how?” Dean asked.
Research was dull. Most of the missing people had lead boring, simple lives and went to work every day and came home to dinner and talked to their kids about school. Dean was finding it incredibly difficult to not just stare at Cas the entire time. The angel looked so adorable when he was concentrating as hard as he was. At least until he found the one outstanding exception in the victim list.
“Yeah, I guess so. Treat him like any other baby.” Dean said, looking down and rocking the little angel gently. Cas wasn’t so sure he liked this yet, but Dean was much gentler than Gabriel had been. Then Cas noticed something, something that caused both Sam and Dean to wrinkle their noses.
“Makes sense.” he said. Andrew smiled and pulled up a chair, getting to work immediately.  Dean smiled and moved away from them, ignoring Sam’s look of disbelief, because he didn’t really have an answer to Sam’s unspoken question.
So that’s where they were. Castiel was lying on one side of the bed in borrowed pajamas (Dean’s, of course) and Dean on the other. Gabriel was sitting on the couch with Sam’s legs thrown over him. (He had refused to move so Sam had just gone with it.) Dean resisted the urge to turn over and spoon his angel. He could hear Sam snoring,  and Gabriel was focused on the television. He didn’t know whether or not Cas was asleep but he figured he could get away with cuddling the angel in his sleep. He closed his eyes and rolled over, scooting slightly closer to Castiel. He scooted slowly over until he could comfortably get an arm over Cas. He sighed contentedly and snuggled into the warm body of his angel.
From: Castiel
“I’m sorry, Lisa.” Castiel said, the truth ringing in his words. He didn’t know what else to say. “We didn’t want to hurt you.”
Cas started to suck little places onto Dean’s thighs, moving steadily, albeit slowly, towards his aching cock. He nuzzled at the crease in Dean’s thigh, causing the stubble on his face to slide alongside his dick. Dean gasped at the unexpected friction and his hands twisted in the sheets. Cas started to kiss along Dean’s dick, first up to his head where he flattened his tongue over the slit, then down to his balls. He paid special attention to the sensitive skin there, sucking each of them into his mouth and rolling his tongue around them and then letting them go and licking a stripe from the base to the tip.
“We know, Dean-o. Saw him this morning. Didn’t want to wake you.” Sam busted out laughing and Dean blushed.
“Despite my best efforts, I have seen Sam naked before.” Dean rolled his shoulders. “And I haven’t been scarred yet.”
“Look, Sam, we’ve been at this for hours. And we’ve got nothing. I’m not saying we should stop…but we need to form a plan and try to get to Casmiria. Without Gabriel, I’m positive it’ll be more difficult, but we can do it. I mean, we haven’t always had angels on our side.” He glances over at Cas. “Who knows, maybe she’ll change him back out of the goodness of her heart.” Sam snorted.
“I’ll stay.” Andrew volunteered. “I’m not tired at all. I can keep researching.”
“Because Cassie isn’t going to let you. Trust me. I was the one he clung to when he was an actual baby.” Gabriel said, smiling a little. Dean grumbled, and started to put Cas into clean clothes, as the little suit and trench coat he was wearing didn’t look entirely comfortable.
"You left your jacket?" Castiel asked, sitting straight up.
"It would appear so. Are you planning on getting to the point anytime soon? I'd like to get back to sleep at some point, you know." Castiel teased.
Dean climbed off the bed and stretched before walking towards the fridge. “It there anything to eat?” he asks. Gabriel points to the table.
“Something tells me this is going to be bad.” He said, which caused Sam to roll his eyes.
Amanda nodded. “And I’m guessing that you aren’t a three-year-old.”
“But we burned the rope so she couldn’t do that.” Dean said.
“Cas, it’s not even been five hours.”  Dean said, even though he echoed his sentiment. Cas gave Dean an unapologetic look and tugged him closer.
“Do you have a ring?” he questioned, and Dean nodded.
Dean shook his head. “I don’t wanna.” he muttered, throwing his arms around Castiel’s waist and burying his face in his thigh.
“Did you really drag us in here to see your boyfriend sleeping?” Dean scoffed. He didn’t notice how Cas had gone stiff beside him. With a frustrated sigh, Sam flipped on the light and Gabriel silhouette was thrown into full view. Only it wasn’t Gabriel. It looked a lot like Gabriel, it was true. If Gabriel been a toddler.
Once he was out of the parking deck and onto the road, Castiel's mind began to wonder. Maybe Dean would be able to come over tonight, though he rarely did that two days in a row. He didn't want his wife to get suspicous, and being gone too many nights was an obvious sign. Castiel had been sleeping with Dean for almost eight months now and he'd never even laid eyes on the woman who was supposed to be Dean's one and only. Well. He'd never spoken to her anyway.
“It’s because I’m the big brother, and I still think of Sam as a kid, I guess.” Cas pursed his lips but didn’t comment further. Dean drove into the center of the small town and followed the signs to the library.
“I can’t believe it…” Lisa said, looking down at the pie in his hand. “He’s not going out with Benny tonight, is he?” She asked, fresh tears welling in her eyes. “No, of course not. He’s been home the past few nights. It’s time, isn’t it?” Her eyes turned mad. “Do you guys shack up at your apartment or are you classy enough to get a motel?” She asked, venom in her tone. Castiel flinched, but he couldn’t do anything. He deserved this and so much more for messing with a married man. He should have known how it would end.
Dean woke up to the sun streaming through the curtains that someone had left open. He yawned and stretched and something pulled at his shirt, causing him to look down to see that Cas was still fast asleep and still cuddled up to Dean, complete with his hand still gripping Dean’s shirt.
“Because we always do.” Cas answered Dean’s unspoken question.  As much as Dean didn’t want to admit it, just hearing Cas say that made him feel better. Dean rolled his head back to look up at Cas.
“I’m gonna kill him.” Dean muttered. Sam couldn’t help but grin. He could see how it was a little funny now. Sam heard a high-pitched laugh and he whipped his head around and saw Gabriel disappearing down the aisle again.
“Amanda. You were flirting with her and she was eating it up. For Christ’s sake, she gave you her number!” Dean still had his back turned to Cas, who promptly looked down and the seven numbers written on his hand.
“C’mon, Cas. We got a witch to kill.”
Dean had laughed about it and pulled over so that he could pee on the side of the road. Castiel took the time to do the same, and Dean couldn’t help but grin the for the next hour, finding it endlessly amusing. Castiel decided to withhold the beef jerky in retaliation for Dean’s laughter, but Dean thought it was worth it.
But then Dean reaches out, touching his elbow to gain his attention. He looked up, right into those green eyes, and knew that he couldn’t lie, nor could he evade, the question. And honestly, he didn’t want to.
All in all it was a good ride, and they got in around eight pm, and by that time they were both exhausted with having been up since early this morning. Castiel was nervous, but the only reason that Dean could tell was because he knew him so well. Once he parked the Impala, he reached over and squeezed Castiel’s knee.
angel
“Vengeance is sweet.” She said. “When you left me, alone and powerless, I almost ended it.” She said dramatically. “I didn’t see a reason to live anymore.” Dean caught Sam’s eye and his brother answered his question with a imperceptible nod. Dean’s distraction had worked. She hadn’t tightened the bounds as tight as they should have been.
"Okay. I apologize." Castiel said immediately, not wanting to upset Dean. His heart ached at the thought.
The four guys all exchanged glances. This was
Dean was awoken by the sound of suppressed laughter. He groaned and looked over towards the source of the noise, which turned out to be Sam and Gabriel.
“Quiet, angel. We don’t want to wake up everyone.” Dean curved his fingers and pressed against Cas’ spot. Cas gripped the sheets and bit his lip in an effort to keep quiet. Dean was unrelenting, pressing against the spot again and again until Cas was a convulsing mess under him.
“And why is that?” he asked, his lips curving up slightly despite his best efforts.
“Yes, Dean. Please.” Castiel said, throwing his head back as Dean started to move his finger in and out. He added another after a few moments, causing Cas to cry out and dig his fingernails into Dean’s back.
“Got anything better to do?” he asked, shouldering his shotgun as he made his way to the front door. Sam shrugged and the others followed his lead, all filing out the door. Once outside, they split up and hid in the woods surrounding the cabin.
“Dean.” Slowly, Dean raised his head slowly and met the blue eyes of his angel.
and he was on his back on the floor, moaning weakly, with Gabriel still wrapped around his neck.
The angel that had rebelled against heaven for him, the angel that would always show up when Dean needed him, the angel who had gripped him tight all those years ago and raised him from perdition.
“Yeah, well…” He was interrupted by Gabriel’s return. Sam turned towards the archangel, grabbed his face and kissed him swiftly. Gabriel responded immediately, wrapping his arms around Sam and stretching up on his toes. Dean looked at Cas, who was watching the pair with fascination.
“I know what we need to do, Sam. But come on, look at yourself. You’re running on fumes, man. Why don’t we just…call it quits for tonight? Get some sleep and start fresh and early tomorrow?”
And there was no way he was unwrapping his legs from Dean.
“Let me finish, please. When Lisa told me what happened I freaked out. You weren’t answering my calls and I…I just had this feeling that something awful was going to happen. I couldn’t…I couldn’t stand the thought of losing you, Cas.” Castiel narrowed his eyes, scarcely believing what he was hearing.
.” Sam replied. Dean nodded.
It’s a good thing he isn’t.
“I didn’t know archangels made such cute sounds.” he teased kissing him again. Gabriel laughed.
Dean moaned the moment Castiel’s overheated flesh made contact with his own. His head dropped back on the pillow and he unthinkingly started to push his hips up as well, into the pre-come slick channel of his hand. Sliding alongside Castiel definitely made it into the top 5 of his ‘Favorite Things To Do’ list.
“Yeah, just…give me a sec.” he said, breathing though his nose. Castiel nodded and rested his head on Dean’s shoulder. Dean could feel the angel shaking with the effort of not moving. Finally, after what seemed like hours, the pain eased and Dean moved his hips slightly, making Castiel gasp. “You can move now, Cas.” Dean said, and the angel nodded, pulling out slightly and then pushing back in. Dean tilted his hips, encouraging Castiel to go in deeper.
“Okay.” Castiel stepped back into his room and came back with a duffle and his laptop bag slung over his shoulders. “I’m ready.” He smiled at Dean.
feel the bare skin of Cas’ chest on his. Dean kissed Castiel heatedly, and the angel responded rather fervently. Dean wrapped his arms around his lover’s torso and held the two of them together.
“I did not wish to share my feelings with any of the others. Gabriel would scoff and Sam would…Sam would agree with me. It just…it seems unwise to give something so powerful to a toddler.” Castiel said.
“Dean.” he gasped out as Dean sped his hand up. “Daddy,
“No, I’m still cuddling with you. You can give it to me later.” It was Dean’s turn to chuckle.
“Does that mean I am your favorite?” he asked shyly, barely looking at Dean. Dean bit his lip.
“Cas, I…” he started, but he was interrupted by the insistent press of lips against his mouth. Dean kissed him back, startled, but if Cas was kissing him then it couldn’t be that bad.
“Save it for the lap dance.” The stripper said with a smirk.
The constant knocking was annoying though.
“Cas, there’s no one to impress. You’ll be fine.” Dean assured him, squeezing his arm around him and then letting him go. “Let’s get on the road.”
“It’s Sam. Get up, we have a problem.” Dean grumbled and climbed out of bed, slipping on a pair of sweats as he opened the door. Sam was fully dressed, and looked unhappy.
“It’s probably just Sam, I’ll get rid of him and then we can move to the bed.” Cas allowed Dean to untangle their limbs and rolled over, finding his own boxers on the floor and pulling them on as Dean did the same. Cas stood to move to the bed when he heard Sam’s voice through the door.
“Well, now that that’s all settled, what’s to say we go grab a beer, huh?” he said, smiling and grabbing Castiel’s hand, leading them all out the door.
“I’ve already got my angel. Now it’s time for you to call
Castiel woke up quite suddenly the next morning. One moment he had been dreaming about Dean and the next he was blinking awake. Dean was still oblivious to the world, his head cushioned on Castiel’s chest and both arms wrapped around his waist, with their legs tangled together. Castiel smiled to himself for a moment and then frowned, searching for some reason for him to be awake.
“Fine. But if we get killed, I’m haunting your asses.”
Somehow, when Gabriel was normal-sized, all his jokes and teasing were funny. Adorable, even. Now that he was a toddler, it all just seemed so…childish. And yes, Sam was able to appreciate the irony.
“Sam. Please.” Gabriel said. He hated begging, but he was desperate. Sam shook his head, the smile still on his face as he withdrew his fingers. Sam rolled a condom on and slicked his dick up before positioning himself at Gabriel’s entrance. Gabriel was just thinking that he was
“Hell, no, you can’t. Who knows what you are actually going to do to him?” he spat. Casmiria smiled.
A burst of power pushes him back again, and this time he stumbles over what used to be Gabriel’s chair. He hit the floor hard enough the breath is knocked out of him, and suddenly the witch is towering over him.
“It’s an expression, Cas.” Cas hummed and kissed Dean until the hunter pulled away. He laughed when the angel tried to follow. “Let’s go see what our brothers have been up to all day.” he said, grabbing the bag of food they had brought for Sam before climbing out of the car, Cas following close behind him.
“About what, Gabriel?” Dean walked over and put his arm around Cas, steering him away from his brother.
Sam really didn’t mind shopping. There was something peaceful about pushing a cart around a store. It was a mindless, rather numbing task – and something that Sam didn’t really mind doing. As long as the other shoppers minded their own business, you were free to do what you had to do and get out of there.
Dean wasn’t really nervous- after all of the shit he had done, he didn’t really get
Dean nodded. Of course Cas would be worried. It wasn’t like most fights they’d been in, Cas wouldn’t have his angel mojo at all, not until they broke the warding. So it made sense that Castiel would be worried about dying. Dean moved and wrapped his arms around the angel.
“You are going to come with us, if I have to hog tie you and pull you out of here with a rope.” Dean growled. Dean was so focused on Andrew that he didn’t notice Cas walk up behind him. When Andrew opened his mouth to say something else but Cas touched his forehead and he collapsed. Dean watched him crumple to the ground without even trying to catch him. He turned to Cas.
By the time Castiel got out of his car and was walking up to his apartment, his body had almost stopped shaking. His mind was almost made up, and unlocking the door to his apartment was a lot easier than unlocking his car door. His empty apartment greeted him with silence like it always did. No one was here waiting on him. No one cared about him, not besides Dean. And he’d just lost Dean.
sleep.”
There were many outcomes to this action that Cas expected. A laugh, a hug, maybe a self-depreciating joke. What he wasn’t prepared for was the eagerness with which Dean returned the kiss.
“Dean? Who is it?” Castiel called from the bathroom. Dean smiled at the surprised look on the man’s face.
“I could show you around.” She said immediately. “I know practically everyone. I could probably help you get a job, too.” She smiled shyly. “You know, since you don’t know anyone else.”
It became apparent around midnight that their
“Okay, so after we bound Casmiria and Gabriel dropped me off at home – which is still
“No, actually. Just here to escort you to see an old friend.” Andrew rolled his eyes and dropped his hands.
“Amanda, how wonderful. Katie sure has missed you.” the witch said, as if she hadn’t been the one to kidnap the little girl in the first place. Castiel looked around the room. There was one other person in there. A young woman with dark brown hair and deep chocolate eyes was standing next to a young girl who cried when Amanda entered the room.
Afterword’s, right before Cas fell asleep Dean swore he heard him mumble ‘I know you do’ again. In the few seconds before he fell asleep himself, Dean thought that maybe Cas was right. Maybe he did deserve this.
“Cas?” he called again, louder this time. Still no answer. The trench coat was draped over the back of a chair, so he knew he was here.
“Small.” he answered. “A little stiff. Toddlers don’t seem to have as much muscle control as adults.” He frowned at his hand. “And I think I have to pee.” Dean almost laughed. Sure, as an angel, he probably wouldn’t be familiar with the sensation of having to pee. Still, the little pinch of his eyebrows in confusion was kind of hilarious. Dean gestured to Sam.
"Yes, Dean, share." Castiel said, his blue eyes dancing with amusement. "Surely you're familiar with the concept? I know you made it past first grade."
“Come on. Let’s get this over with.” Dean said, brushing past Cas and leaving the angel looking confused behind him.
(See the end of the chapter for
“What if he pissed off a witch?” Dean looked at Sam. He had almost forgotten about him being there.
“Yeah, I guess.” he said, grabbing Cas’ hand as they walked out the door. Sam was loading his duffle into the Impala, Gabriel hanging around him with a red lollipop in his mouth.
Second (and probably last) Chapter of today! Thanks for all the support!
"Goodnight, Dean." Castiel replied, losing the fight as a tear rolled down his cheek. He heard a click and surrended, dropping his phone. He heard it bounce on the floor, but it wasn't in him to care. He wiped his eyes, cursing himself for the weakness. He so pathetic, it wasn't a suprise that Dean didn't want him beyond sex. When they fucked, it wasn't like Dean had to pay attention to the mess that was inside of Castiel.
“I know they can’t.” Castiel said, and sucked him down. Dean let out a strangled moan and fell back against the wall, his hand going to the back of Castiel’s head. The angel moaned in encouragement,  grabbing Dean’s hips and forcing him to rock into his mouth. Dean threaded both hands through his hair and started to thrust into Cas’ mouth, moaning as he felt Cas work his tongue over his cock. He felt Castiel swallow around him and he threw his head back, moaning.
Dean nodded. “Uh, yeah. I mean, he’s already your brother, and seeing him as a child must be…I dunno, making you have some sort of paternal instincts? It happens.” Dean said with a shrug.
“That’s all fine and dandy but we have more pressing matters.” Dean ignored the glare from Sam.  “Right now, we need to find out what we’re up against. For instance, how did she get her powers back?” Andrew looked up.
admit this out loud, it actually made him feel really good that he was the one that Cas chose to cling to. It didn’t really make sense, he had known Gabriel longer, but for some reason the little angel had decided that he wanted to attach himself to Dean. It gave Dean a sense of….pride, almost, with the fact that Cas trusted him enough to let the hunter be his almost sole caretaker. Dean yawned and decided he should probably get to bed, that nap earlier had hardly done anything. Dean changed Cas before laying him down on the bed and placing Cas beside him. The tiny angel snuggled right up against him and was asleep almost instantly. Dean wasn’t far behind.
“I guess we’d better get back. Thanks for listening, Cas.” Dean looked down at the angel, smiling slightly. “Let’s add this to the things we don’t talk about when you are back to normal, huh?” Cas nodded. He was glad that the hunter was in a better mood. Dean stood up and made his way out of the park, walking back down the street towards the hotel. Cas watched Dean. He was silent as they walked back. Even though he had just woken up, he felt sleepy again. This tiny human body required so much rest! Quite frankly, it was annoying. Cas yawned as they walked through the front doors of the hotel and was asleep by the time they got to the elevator.
“Now, how can I help you?” She asked, sipping her coffee. Dean cleared his throat.
“Hi.” she purred, leaning over as she held out her hand. He dress was low enough that it left nothing to the imagination as she leaned forward. “I’m Natalie.” she said. Dean shook her hand.
Dean lost it. He let go of the chair, his hands shooting out to grip the sinful hips in front of him and his own coming up, chasing the pleasure of Jimmy’s ass. In the next moment, Jimmy was gone, out of his lap and standing in front of him, still rocking to the song. The wink the stripper sent his way told him everything.
The moment Gabriel shut the door, Dean is off. He wants to get this shit done. He’s never liked apologizing (even if he is wrong), and he’d like to get it over with.
“Don’t – don’t you think we should let him sleep? You know, while he still can?” he asked, his fear evident on his face. It was clear he wasn’t ready to have Gabriel be awake yet.
“Hey, baby.” he said, as he gestured for his boyfriend to scoot to one side of the bath so he could get in. Cas complied and Dean climbed into the tub and sat across from his boyfriend. He leaned forward and captured Castiel’s lips in a long, sweet kiss. Cas hummed and put his arms around Dean’s neck to keep him there. Dean couldn’t help but smile. His boyfriend pulled away after a minute.
“Yes, fuck.” Dean moaned, driving his hips up towards the wonderful pressure of Cas hands.  Cas used his other hand to keep Dean’s hips against the bed, stroking them both with a loose, controlled fist. Dean groaned and tried to thrust up once more, but Cas held him fast. Damn angelic strength. Dean whined impatiently. “Cas, please.”
“Let’s get this show on the road.” Dean muttered, and suddenly floored the Impala, heading back down to the road towards the motel.
The archangel turned over onto his back so Sam could lay over him. He started to kiss his jaw and lower, trailing kisses lazily over his neck and chest. Gabriel hummed, happy his distraction was working. It was hard to find a better distraction with sex after all. Sam started to tug on his shirt and Gabriel rose up a little to let Sam pull it off of him. Sam turned his attention to Gabe’s chest, nipping and licking his way down.
“Don’t worry about it. You’ll be full angel again before we know it.” Cas looked at Dean and Dean gave him a small smile. They looked at each other until Sam cleared his throat. Dean blushed slightly.
“Today’s the day, baby.” he muttered, starting her. As she roared to life, Dean felt a knot ease in his chest. Castiel climbed into the passenger seat and immediately reached to take Dean’s hand. Dean didn’t argue.
“No.” Dean said, sitting up to stop Cas’ hands, causing the angel looked at him in surprise.
. And we haven’t found
Dean stepped out of the elevator and made his way across lobby. The amount of emotions running through him at the moment was astonishing. Not only was he mad enough to set hell on fire, he was also sad and for some fucking reason he was also anxious. Everything Gabriel had said had brought all of his repressed emotions to the surface. Did Gabriel really think that he didn’t regret Ash or Pam or any of the rest of the people he had gotten killed? Did he really think that if Dean had a choice that he would take the place of every single one of them? Dean felt tears start to well up in his eyes and he took a deep breath, trying to hold them back. For fuck’s sake he didn’t want to cry walking down some random street in Wisconsin with an angel of the lord-turned human baby in his arms.
“Goodnight, Gabe.”
“I love you.” he said, and Castiel smiled.
“Like shit. Woke up with a headache.” He refused to call it a hangover. Cas smiled and leaned in to kiss him.
Not that Castiel knew about the whiskey he had been thinning the beer with. Or maybe he did, he just didn’t mention it because he didn’t want to make Dean feel worse about himself. Probably the latter.
Dean knew he should probably go ahead and wake Sam up and apologize to him and Andrew, but the pounding in his head and the little frown on Castiel’s face when he had woken up alone made him want to just crawl back into the bed and sleep. Castiel groaned and collapsed back onto the bed, wrapping an arm around a pillow and burrowing his face into it. That made up Dean’s mind.
“Dean.” Cas sighed. “You just picked a fight with Sam for no reason.”
“Probably a good thing.” Dean said. “If she ever found out, she’d most likely kill you.” Andrew looked up, unfazed.
“She might not let them go anyway.” he mumbled, but he knew Sam had a point. It had to be Friday. Dean huffed and threw up his hands. “So what do we do, then? Sit on our thumbs and wait?”
“But they don’t seem to mind what we do.” Dean heaved a sigh.
wasn’t going to be waking up anytime soon. This meant that they had one bed between the three of them. (Dean was all for throwing Andrew on the floor, but Sam
Once the plan had been hammered out, the four men went back and crowded around Andrew. Dean glared at the man.
“Exactly. We’ll show you how the Winchester’s do Christmas.” Dean slung an arm around his shoulders. “You ready to go?”
“We really should be getting up.” Castiel said, but nevertheless he relaxed into Dean’s embrace.
“No, nothing at all.” Gabriel said, rolling his eyes in Sam’s direction and then going to cut on the television. Dean caught Sam’s eye and raised an eyebrow. Sammy shook his head and went to stretch out on the other bed. Dean kept eating but his mind was racing, wondering what in the hell could be going on between his brother and Gabriel. Eventually he decided to forget it. Sam was a big boy. He could handle whatever it was.
“Rest, Dean. We have a lot to do tomorrow.” Dean nodded, and rested against Cas’ chest.
“How did you find him yesterday?” Dean asked. Sam jerked his head towards Gabriel, who was sitting in the backseat ginning like the Cheshire Cat. Dean resisted the urge to roll his eyes once again. The pint-sized archangel was really getting on his nerves today, and the last thing he wanted to do was ask him for a favor.
“Look, Natalie…” he started, but she just pushed up against him again.
This is very smuffy, to make up for Dean being a dickhead last chapter.
“Aww did you miss me, Dean-o?” Gabriel teased. Dean rolled his eyes again and shook his head. Dean heard movement in the general direction of the beds. Sam was finally awake. As soon as Cas was happily sucking on the bottle Dean turned around.
“I know.” Cas nuzzled Dean’s neck. “But it’ll be alright, Dean. We’ll find the girl and stop whatever is taking people.” Cas reassured Dean, kissing him on the corner of his mouth.
a plan. And really, since when did they have a great track record with plans anyway? Something was probably going to go wrong. It always did.
Castiel smiled. “If you don’t want to sleep…then perhaps we could…find another way to entertain ourselves.”
“Nothing that I can think of.” She answered. “It was just…a normal week.”
Castiel nodded. “I suppose that does make sense.” He looked up at Dean. “I do worry about you. But I know you are too stubborn to listen to me and stay away.”
“Are you ready?” the angel asked breathlessly, and Dean nodded. Castiel took his dick in one hand and gently guided it into Dean.
Chapter 12: Pranks & Stuff
“I love you.” Dean whispered into the angel’s chest. Castiel’s hands stilled on Dean’s back and he looked down at the hunter, who determinedly stared straight ahead, purposefully not meeting the angel’s eyes. Dean felt a hand move from his back to his chin, forcing him to look up. The hunter did so rather hesitantly, worried about what he is going to see in Castiel’s eyes.
Castiel found that he could manipulate the candle holder on the wall. If he focused enough energy on it, he could move it. The best thing about this was that it was stationed directly over a major piece of the angel warding. He concentrated on making it rock back and forth, trying to scratch away a piece of the warding, but he had to go slowly so as not to attract attention. He knew that Sam had managed to untie himself, but he still wanted these wards
“No, of course not! How can you even think that?” Cas took a deep breath, trying to calm himself. “Gabriel is more than capable of getting them out of there, Dean. I had to get you out before you ran in there on a suicide mission!”
“What is it?” Castiel asked, suddenly concerned. Dean made an effort to control himself and looked up at the angel.
“What?” he asked sleepily, not opening his eyes. Castiel chuckled.
“You’re not fair.” he pouted. Sam grinned and turned his attention to Dean.
Yes, it was pretty safe to say that Dean was turning into an old sap because Cas just couldn’t help but to carry his perfection over to when he slept. There was no way on earth Dean could ever deserve someone so good, he was just too fucked up and had enough Daddy Issues to fill up a subscription of magazines. Cas grumbled, curling impossibly closer to Dean as if he could sense the hunter’s self-hating thoughts. Dean sighed and wrapped his arm around Cas, tucking the angel under his chin before drifting off into an uneasy sleep.
Dean broke away from Cas and let out a choked sound. He hadn’t expected Cas to already be hard, too. Cas kissed Dean as he moved his hands and unbuttoned Dean’s jeans. Dean grasped and pushed his hips into Cas’ hand before the angel even had a chance to get it inside of his pants. Cas smiled against his lips and maneuvered his hand to grip Dean’s dick. The hunter moaned and thrust up again as Cas started stroking him lightly, running his thumb over the tip to collect the pre-come gathered there. Dean let go of the sheets and grabbed Cas by the back of his head, pulling him down for a dirty, passionate kiss. Cas let go of Dean and withdrew his hand, moving back from Dean so he could pull the other man’s pants down and off. He sat back and looked at Dean, all spread out in front of him.
So he doesn’t. Instead, he leans over and kisses Dean, not caring that he was trying to distract him. Not caring that Dean knew that.
“Yes, but it’s way too faint. What can I do?”
angel of the
“Lots.” Dean managed. He was quickly losing his ability to form coherent thoughts as Cas continued to work his mouth over the sensitive skin of Dean’s neck. The hunter let out a breathy moan when teeth grazed his earlobe. Castiel slowly made his way back up to Dean’s mouth and kissed him hard, tangling his hands in the hunter’s short blondish hair and securing their mouths together. Dean’s head was so full of Cas’ smell and the hot slide of the angel’s tongue against his own that his mind was slowly losing control over his body. So it wasn’t entirely his fault when he ran his hands down the angel’s back to grip his ass and pull him closer, bringing their hips together. Cas let out a surprised moan as Dean’s clothed erection brushed against his own. Castiel chuckled and slid one hand out of Dean’s hair and down between them to grip Dean through his jeans.
Gabriel was finding it difficult to sleep. Sure, he was used to sleeping with someone who was much bigger than he was, but that was before he had gotten toddler-ified and now it was almost comical how much bigger Sam was than him.  Seriously, Gabriel wasn’t even the length of his boyfriend’s torso anymore. (So what, he had measured, he was curious, okay?) Sam was snoring softly, one of his gigantor hands wrapped gently around Gabriel’s back and holding him close. It would’ve been cute if it wasn’t so frustrating.
“Almost nine.” Dean answered. He cleared his throat as Andrew stood. “Look, man…” Dean took a deep breath. “What I said yesterday…” Andrew shook his head, a soft smile playing on his lips.
Witches.
“Figures.” She mumbled and started to walk away. Castiel glared at her until she disappeared into the crowd. Then the angel looked at him, and Dean swallowed.
” Dean bit his lip. Cas begging like this was driving him absolutely crazy.
“Don’t you two do that enough already?” he asked in an exasperated tone. “Wait, never mind don’t answer that. Fine. One hour, or I’m taking the car.” he threatened. Dean rolled his eyes.
“What do you mean?” Sam asked, looking questioningly at Castiel.
“Heya, Cas.” Dean’s voice washed over him. He opened his eyes and looked at Dean.
“Move.” Dean grunted, rolling his hips and causing Castiel to moan again. The angel pulled out slowly and pushed back in, allowing Dean to get used to the feeling before he set a bruising pace, his fingers digging into Dean’s hipbones as he searched for the hunter’s prostate. Dean arched his back and almost yelled when Castiel found it.
Sam nodded. “Our old mentor found it for us. We’ve used it before.” He handed Andrew the written copy of the spell. The other man read over it quickly.
“Fine, but if she asks, you stole her number out of my phone.” Dean said, as he scrolled through his contacts and found Jo. He held it up and Charlie quickly put the number in her phone.
“I know you do, Dean.” Cas said, his eyes alight with fire. “I know you do.” And then Cas threw his head back and moaned, clenching as he came all over his hand. The sudden tightening of Cas around him was too much for his oversensitive cock. He came hard, filling Cas up and crying out wordlessly. Cas didn’t stop, rocking until Dean had fully ridden out his orgasm. With a wince, Cas slid off of Dean and stretched out beside him. With a sleepy mumble, Cas waved his hand and they were clean. For the third time tonight, Dean felt a surge of appreciation for angel mojo. He was too blissed out to want to move as Cas curled around him.
“…Really?” he asked, sounding incredulous. “I thought…” he trailed off. “Never mind.” Castiel leaned in and was kissing Dean and hell, yeah, that was good. Dean moved backwards slowly, gripping the angel’s shirt and pulling him so that they were laying on the bed with Castiel stretched over him.
“Daddy, I need you.” he whispered as he started to move his hand up and down, jerking Dean off with light, careful motions. Dean decided that he couldn’t wait much longer, either.  He nodded and moved over Cas to reach into the bedside drawer and grab the small bottle of lube he kept there. He popped the lid and squirted some into his hand. As he rubbed the lube to warm it he kissed Cas’ flat stomach. He took one lube-slicked finger and started to rub it around Cas’ entrance causing Cas to gasp and try to push himself down onto Dean’s finger. Dean gently pushed his finger in up to the first knuckle and was rewarded with a mewling cry from Cas. Dean pushed his finger the rest of the way in and started to slide it in and out. He loved the build up to the sex because he could listen to all the pretty noises Cas made as he fingered him. They drove him crazy.
So everyone keeps saying. CN
“Yeah, we could. But we won’t. Because we’re all gonna be there, and we’ve all got each other’s backs, okay? No one is gonna get hurt – other than Casmiria. Okay?” Castiel nodded. “Don’t worry, Cas. I have complete faith in you.” Dean said. Castiel smiled, and it was so perfect that Dean never wanted to see Castiel without that smile again.
“Wouldn’t you want to know?” Dean asked, and Sam wilted slightly. “Besides, it’s not like angels actually
the satisfaction of knowing that it had gotten to him. So instead of begging, Dean stared at her, his eyes portraying no emotion other than hatred. He would NOT beg.
But this wasn’t once upon a time. He had told Cas that he would try to be…well, less reckless. And everyone else be damned, he was gonna do right by the angel this time. Dean blinked out of his revere and moved around the bed to put an arm around Castiel and pulled the angel flush against him, feeling the sudden need to be close to him. Cas made a humming noise in the back of his throat and let his head fall back against Dean’s shoulder.
“Aww, look Sammy. He’s awake.” Dean rolled his eyes.
"Just what? It's not like we've never done it before." Castiel reminded him. "How else would I know that you become an octopus if there's another person within three feet of you while you're asleep?" Dean blushed and rolled his eyes.
“We should do this more often.” Castiel said. Dean kissed the hollow beneath his boyfriend’s ear.
I'm not going to beg for comments or kudos, but I just may have to ask pretty please?
“You just showered.” Came the muffled reply, seeing as Cas hadn’t felt the need to move his face from Dean’s neck. Dean frowned in confusion.
“Dean, you may want to consider Sam’s idea.” Cas said.  While I personally do not wish to become an infant again, I am certain that ridding the earth of the witch would be a good thing.” Dean shot Cas a look.
No one said a word. Gabriel was clinging to Sam like a lifeline, though he was trying to play it cool. Before anyone could knock, however the door swung open.
“Just hold tight. What’s your address?” Dean rattled off the address from memory, his fingers fixed over the vein in Castiel’s neck. He needed the reassurance that he was still alive.
Chapter 1: God’s Always In My Life
After the initial shock, Cas decided he liked the water. It was warm and pliable to his touch. He slapped at it, fascinated by the ripples that were created. Dean gently splashed water onto the baby before squeezing some baby shampoo into his hand and starting to wash Cas’ head. Cas stopped playing and hummed quietly. It felt nice to have the hunter washing his hair, he found, and the knowledge surprised him. Maybe that’s why humans like to touch so much.
“Dean, now. Please.” Castiel said, whimpering again. Dean scissored his fingers, trying to hurry up the slow process of prepping his boyfriend. Castiel groans and pushes himself down on the fingers.
“You are sleeping with a man. God is against homosexuality.”
Okay, so this wasn’t the first time Dean had ever had fingers up his ass. He can experimented before, of course, and Cas had done it a few times while he was blowing Dean, but if felt different this time. Maybe it was because he knew he was getting prepped for something way bigger than a couple of fingers. Cas leaned over and took Dean back into his mouth as he worked his finger in and out. When Cas pushed a second finger in, Dean let out a gasp of surprise.  It didn’t hurt, not really, but there was a definite burn. He wasn’t sure whether he liked it or not. He could feel Cas moving his fingers inside of him, stretching and searching, until Dean felt a rush of heat go up his spine.
“I should, also. Dean is probably wondering where I am already.” Gabriel rolled his eyes again.
Gabriel hated being a toddler. He could feel himself wanting to overreact to everything exactly like a child. He was aware of his actions, though, so most of the time he could stop himself from acting like a brat.
“You know…” Cas said against his neck, “Orgasms have been known to help get rid of headaches.” Dean felt lips trace the side of his neck and begin to lazily suck on the spot just below his ear.
“Jesus, Cas, stop!” Dean ran over and plucked up the baby, careful not to any of the carrot mush on himself. “I’m going to have to give you a bath, aren’t I?” Cas looked up, confused. He tilted his head and you could almost hear him asking ‘What’s a bath?’ Dean laughed at the expression. It reminded him of so much of the bigger Cas’ that he couldn’t help it. It was good to know that it really was still his angel. Just a little smaller. And more fragile. Sam spoke up suddenly from behind the computer.
“I’m not sure we should expose Cas like that. I mean, if the witch sees him it could force a reaction. I’m not sure what she’d do with a group of people around.”
"Maybe not." Castiel said, bending down. "But there's plenty of time for me to fuck your mouth." Dean groaned at the thought, wanting nothing more than that right now. He pushed at Castiel, trying to get him off so he could get to his dick. Castiel chuckled, sliding off Dean's lap and into the seat beside him. (Dean absently remembered the food as Castiel pushed it off the seat but there are much better things right in front of him that he was able put his mouth on right now)
“And a car seat. He shouldn’t need diapers or bottles or anything.” Sam said. Dean and Cas decided to go hunt down a shopping cart leaving Sam and Gabriel alone.
Not tonight.
Oh, Dean wanted to. He wanted it more than anything. “I do.” He said, perhaps a little more desperately than he meant to. Jimmy chuckled.
he was going to have to take care of himself. He had left Cas a message a few hours earlier telling the angel that he was alone at the bunker, and had invited him to drop by. Castiel’s base of operations wasn’t that far away from the bunker. Dean had hoped that being in close proximity to the angel would bring said angel to him. Apparently, he had been wrong.
"Because you wouldn't have risked waking me up for that." Castiel said. "Not when you know how I am without proper rest."
“No?” Dean challenged. “I’m going to go and kill this bitch if it is the last thing I do, and I’m sorry, but you aren’t gonna stop me.” Dean turned around and suddenly he was in the motel room, Cas by his side. He whirled on the angel and pushed him.
to, he doesn’t
“Sam! Get in here!” Sam ran into the room, shirtless, looking at Gabriel for an explanation. His hair was still wet.
Dean’s heart was pounding in his ears. He hadn’t heard from Castiel in over an hour, despite several calls and messages that had gone straight to voicemail. Lisa had found out. Lisa had found out, found Castiel, and yelled at him in front of the entirety of a small bakery. Where he’d been picking out pie for Dean. Lisa had told him the entire story.
“And you know the worst part? I knew. The whole time. Dean never really wanted to marry me. He did it because I was pregnant. Even though it wasn’t his kid and he knew it, he stayed with me.” Lisa sniffed. “I guess this is my punishment, right? For cheating on him when we were younger.” By then, the entire restaurant was staring at him. Oh, god, they all knew that he was an awful person. They knew just how bad he was.
Ellen laughed. “You’ll fit in just fine, Cas.” She said. “Now ya’ll come on inside, it’s too cold to be standing out her shooting the shit.” Dean hefted his bag once more and gestured for Castiel to go first, and they followed Ellen into the house.
Chapter 21: Best Laid Plans
“That was for abandoning me.” She said, before turning towards the house. “Please come in, everyone.” She stood back to allow them access to the open doorway. Dean glanced around at his group before he led the way inside. Casmiria watched the door as they all filed past her into the house before she shut the door with a snap. Wordlessly, she led them into the living room, gesturing for them all to sit before walking into what Dean assumed was the kitchen. Sam sat Andrew as close as he could to Casmiria’s altar. There was a picture of her sitting on the mantle above said altar. Andrew looked scared, but determined. He caught Dean’s eye and nodded. He was ready. Dean prepared himself and the moment Casmiria entered the room, Dean tackled her.
Dean’s train of thought was interrupted by a firm, sweet kiss. Dean kissed him back, clinging to the angel slightly because he wasn’t ready for this to end, Jesus, he didn’t think he would be able to live if Castiel left.
“You just pissed off our best chance at finding out who did this.” Sam growled.  Dean stood up, and Cas moved his hand down to Dean’s elbow and squeezed. Dean knew it was a warning, but he couldn’t stop himself.
“You’ve thought about this, haven’t you, Dean?” The angel asked suddenly as his hands stilled on Dean’s thighs. The hunter looked down at Cas in surprise. “Thought about how long it’s been since I’ve taken you. How it’s going to feel when I do it again. Haven’t you?” Dean doesn’t know what to say. Of course he’s been
“Gabe found something.” Sam said, “We were going to let you sleep until Cas woke up and wanted you.” Dean grumbled and yawned. Cas started to play with the zipper on Dean’s jacket. He wasn’t listening to the conversation, really. At least not until Dean spoke.
When Dean opened the door to the bathroom all he could see was the back of his boyfriend’s head and the top of his shoulders. He swallowed and started to take off his clothes, leaving them in a haphazard pile next to Cas’ neat, folded pile. He found his boyfriend’s bright blue eyes as they watched him undress in the mirror. Dean walked up and kissed his boyfriend’s head.
Castiel indulged him for a moment, bringing his lips back to Dean’s and kissing him lightly, slowly rolling his hips to give Dean (and himself) a little friction. Dean groaned at the contact.
“She wouldn’t be kidnapping and killing people if she had any goodness in her heart.” he sighed. “We should probably call Andrew. He may have an idea.”
Dean knocked on the door, waited a minute, then knocked again. No answer. He knew Castiel was home. He’d seen the monstrosity he called a car in the parking deck. He knocked again, no answer.
“She said she was there for a moment and then disappeared. Long, dark hair, tall. Wearing a long-sleeved purple shirt with a corset and a long black skirt.”
“Speaking of normal babies….” Sam trailed off, grinning. Dean groaned and held Cas away from him.
asking. And the angel fucking
Dean sucked in a deep breath and let it out slowly before answered.
Dean nodded frantically. If Castiel didn’t stop, this was going to be over before it could even start. He didn’t know why, but a possessive Castiel was acting was a serious turn-on.
“I love you, too.” Castiel said. He smiled and kissed the hunter again. Dean sighed and responded, pressing against the angel as happiness radiated through his entire body. Dean grinned and pulled away.
“Dean?” he asked, glancing at his hunter.
“Consort?” Oh, gross. That meant that the witch was
“Good evening, Gentlemen.” Casmiria said, stepping back to allow them to enter. Castiel shivered slightly as he crossed the threshold, feeling the uncomfortable dampening of his powers. Luckily, the warding wasn’t as strong as he originally thought, meaning he had some measure of control. Either the witch must have been in a hurry or she had been given the incorrect symbols. He wouldn’t be able to fly them out of here, and he wouldn’t be able to smite anyone, but he was still capable of fighting like an angel.
“I’ll kill him if you come any closer.” She threatened, holding a long and lethal-looking dagger to the base of his throat. Poor Gabriel looked terrified, his fear making his eyes round. It would be adorable if his life wasn’t in the balance.
Chapter 7: Andrew
“Did he just say…” Cas concentrated on saying a different word, this time, Sam.
“Thanks.” Dean said, reaching out to take a cup. She nodded and settled down onto the couch.
The angle was too perfect, Dean making Cas see stars with thrust that grazed his prostate, effectively turning the angel into a whimpering, needy mess. Dean dug his nails into Cas, letting the angel know that his orgasm was close. Cas came quite suddenly, taking both of them by surprise but then Dean was coming right after, and
“Not yet, baby. Wanna do something first.” Cas tilted his head in confusion, but stopped trying to pull him up. Dean wrapped one hand around Cas’ cock and started to stroke it in lazy motions, using the precome leaking out of the tip to ease the passing. Cas let out a surprised ‘oh.’ and closed his eyes. The other man’s head fell back and he leaned against the sink. Dean smiled to himself and gently wrapped his head around the leaking head of Cas’ cock. The man’s eyes flew opened and he moaned in surprise.
“It seems he has an….appreciation for park benches.” Dean smiled wider at the apprehension in Cas’ voice. “He’s at the park by the grocery store. I don’t think it has a name.” Dean reached over and squeezed Cas’ hand once. Cas caught his eye and smiled.
Comments and Kudos are loved and appreciated. I promise I will respond to all comments, it may take a little while.
“If we get you what you need…you could bring him back?” Sam asked, and Andrew smiled at the question.
“Not really. They were about the most boring people you can imagine. They were all normal, apple-pie-life-having people. Except for the most recent one to go missing. Lindsey Donovan? She didn’t fit the profile. No family or friends, worked at the diner in town, lived alone, no boyfriend. She has a record too, but it was sealed so I figured you could hack into the database and break it open.” Sam nodded.
The second update for today! I hope you like it :) You get Cas' point of view in this chapter.
“Gabe isn’t awake yet. For someone who doesn’t need to sleep, he sure does a lot.” Sam smiled and shook his head fondly. “I was awake and listening to the police scanner when I heard the call come in. Figured I should let you know.” Cas climbed onto the bed behind Dean put his arms around him. Dean leaned back against Cas.
“We go to Wisconsin, find the bitch that did this to Cas, and we make her reverse it. Simple as that.” Sam shook his head.
Sam smiled and then tackled Gabe to the bed. The archangel squealed a little as Sam pinned him down. Sam laughed.
“What, are you fluent in baby now?” The hunter didn’t even flinch anymore. He was getting used to him randomly popping up. Gabriel shook his head.
He made his selection (cherry) and walked over to the counter, taking his place in line behind an elderly lady who was ordering a cake for her granddaughters birthday. He wasn't paying strict attention, letting his mind wander as the lady specified what she wanted. He wasn't in a hurry, anyway.
“Sam? Can I…umm…get your help?” Sam smiled and went to help him. Dean glanced at Cas again.
Cas wasn’t sure he liked this entire ‘being human’ thing. Dean’s clothes felt nice against his skin, but it was almost too much sensation. He could
“Will…will he be able to talk?” he asked, looking at Cas as if he held all the answers. The angel simply shrugged.
Dean wasn't worried at all when Castiel didn't show up on time. He definitely didn't watch his cubicle until the man arrived, looking ragged and tired, a cup of coffee clenched in his hand. It confirmed the inkling that Dean had. Castiel had lied last night. There was no way that he'd been asleep when Dean had called him last night. Castiel didn't look in his direction, just sat down and went straight to work like he always did.
“Yeah, Cas, we can do that now.”
“I’ve done it, but I never let anyone else. You’re the first.” he said. Tilting his head to capture the angel’s mouth.
Castiel pulled Dean away from the wall and then they were crashing down onto the bed, the angel attacking his lips hungrily. Castiel pulled away and Dean took a second to think about the  situation. His shirt was lose and open, his pants pulled down around his knees and his dick was poking out of the slit in his boxers.
From: Castiel
It shouldn’t have hurt. Dean didn’t mean anything by that comment, and Castiel knew it. So why did he suddenly want to run from the room? It took him a moment to pinpoint the exact emotion he was feeling. Embarrassment. Because Dean had told Gabriel that the archangel was his favorite. All of the sudden he wanted to hide. He was pulled out of his spiraling circle by a movement on the bed opposite of him.
“Dean. Dean, it’s the middle of the day.” Cas said, squirming and pushing back against Dean. He thanked God that no one was around at the moment.
“You don’t?” Castiel asked, as he nosed into Dean’s thigh. Dean took a shaky breath.
Well, at least that was something.
“Here, I’ll give you my number and you can just call.” Before Dean could say anything she took Cas’ hand and wrote it down. The action gave Dean the irrational urge to pull Cas away from the woman and claim him. She smiled hesitantly at Cas as she let go of his hand. Dean opened the door and let Cas pass him before nodding to Amanda.
“Gabriel, you are my favorite.” Gabriel laughs. No one seems to notice the hurt look on Cas’ face.
“It’s about time.” Gabriel groaned dramatically. “I thought
“I know. I’ve heard a lot about you. You’re all this numbskull talks about.” Ellen teased,  releasing him.
“Cas…I wanna…” Dean stuttered as Cas brushed his prostate again. The hunter licked his lips and tried again. “Let me ride you.” he managed, rising up on his elbows to get closer to his lover. The angel paused, considering, then pulled out slowly and lay down beside Dean.
When Castiel's alarm went off, he hit the snooze button automatically. He shouldn't have fallen asleep when he did last night. Pulling all-nighters was something he was used to, but only getting two hours of sleep wasn't. It had only made him groggy and more tired, but once he'd gotten Dean's jacket (and scent) under him, he hadn't been able to help himself. Sleep had come almost immediately. He closed his eyes, willing it to not be morning yet, but his alarm went off once again. Resigning himself to the fact, he clicked it off and stood up, yawning as he made his way into the kitchen. Maybe coffee would help him out a little.
“How’re you feeling, Gabe?” Dean asked. The archangel rolled his eyes.
“Yeah, I’m good. Just sore.” he chuckled. “Gonna be walking funny all day.” he said. Castiel reached out and put two fingers against Dean’s forehead, healing him of the slight ache.
“Take off your clothes.” he commanded, folding his arms over his chest. Dean hurried to comply, pulling his shirt off and tossing it aside. He laid back and unbuttoned his jeans, lifting his hips off of the bed so he could pull them down. It would have been easier to stand up but he knew that Castiel didn’t want him to. The angel liked to have him undress sitting down. As soon as he had managed to get his pants past his thighs he felt Castiel place his hands over Dean’s and helped him pull them the rest of the way off. He smiled at his angel, feeling a little high that Castiel was unable to wait for him to finish undressing himself.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Exquisite.” he murmured. Dean felt Castiel grab the hem of his t-shirt and hike it up, exposing his stomach. Dean squirmed and tried to pull it back down. He was more than a little self-conscious about the softness around his belly that he couldn’t seem to get rid of. Castiel gripped his hand and pulled it away from his shirt.
After Dean pulled into a parking space that was a little further away, he leaned over and kissed Castiel again, putting one hand on his face to hold him there for a little longer. They were almost late, and didn't really have time for it, but Castiel savored the sweet, tender kiss.
Dean and Cas were following along behind him. Sam could hear them talking quietly amongst themselves. They seemed content with letting Sam take the lead on this one and Sam was grateful. Besides, it was
To: Castiel
Dean didn’t know what to say. He wanted to come, he wanted it badly and he was
“Fine. But only because I love Cas. And I want Jo’s number.” Dean raised his eyebrow.
Dean’s answering smile is so brilliant that Castiel can’t help but stretch up and kiss him. It’s soft, and sweet, and exactly what Castiel never knew that he needed.
“Yeah, we want to get this back and start on it immediately, start trying to find her. If we wait any longer, she might leave the area, if she hasn’t already.” Amanda nodded and stood up.
“Of course not.” he said, his hands tightening on Cas’ waist. The angel was moving down, nipping and kissing his way down Dean’s torso. Dean blinked as Cas got down onto his knees. “Oh, fuck.” he moaned, as Cas leaned in and undid his button with his teeth.
“Yes, Cas, I’m fucking ready. Please, fuck me.” he said. Cas nodded and pulled his fingers out. Dean whined at the loss, but he could already hear the Cas opening the lube. He propped his head up and watched as Cas slicked himself up. He smiled at Dean as he positioned himself. Before he could even ask, Dean nodded and spread his legs. Cas took a deep breath and started to push in.
Finally, Castiel worked his way to Dean’s lips. He smiled at the hunter before kissing him hungrily, showing Dean that the angel was just as desperate as he was. Castiel moved so that he was now straddling Dean. The hunter took advantage of the new position and quickly moved to finish taking Castiel’s shirt off. The angel chuckled slightly but allowed it, sitting up to give Dean more room. Dean removed the shirt and pulled the angel against him and he could
Also, bottom!Dean, if that's not your thing.
And just when they were starting to put the spell together, they heard a noise come from the general direction of the bed.
"How do you know I just didn't want to hear your voice?" Dean asked, amusement in his tone.
Dean groaned and felt a rush of heat go straight to his groin. Cas
“I’ll be right back.” He whispered. Dean went to his suitcase, grabbed a pair of pajama bottoms, and went to put them on in the bathroom. Satisfied, he left the bathroom, took his jacket off and laid down beside Cas. The little angel scooted right up to him and closed his eyes, one hand fisting into Dean’s shirt. Dean smiled and put an arm around the angel.
“You are. I’m Hannah. Do you remember how you got here?” She asked.
“I did, but I wasn’t human. With my grace bound, it was unable to maintain my vessel in the way that it should have.”
"You know it was." Castiel took another second, than he sat up and tucked himself back in his pants. At least Dean didn't mind swallowing. It made clean up a lot easier. He looked up when he was finished, and beckoned Dean closer. "I think it's your turn, handsome." he said, sliding across the seat. Dean sat back, spreading his legs as Castiel unbuttoned his pants.
“I’m ready.” She declared. She turned to Dean and held her hands out for Cas. “May I?” Dean turned so Cas was facing away from her.
“Okay, sir, does he have a pulse?”
You don't normally drive? DW
Four hours and 28 minutes later there was....nothing. Nada. Zip. Zero. The only thing that Dean knew for sure was that sitting in against this tree was starting to get uncomfortable. Painful, even. It wasn’t his longest stakeout, not by any means, but he usually had baby with him and her seats were a hell of a lot more comfortable than the trunk of this tree.
“Don’t be naked, Sam! Our brothers don’t need to be scarred by your manliness!” Dean rolled his eyes.
That's all :) Enjoy!
“I’d like that.” he said. Dean walked up and clapped him on the shoulder.
“Here’s an idea.” Dean growled. “How about you and Sam stay here, and I’ll go and find the bitch.” Dean passed the baby to Sam, but as soon as he was out of Dean’s arms, Cas started to bawl. Gabriel chuckled as Sam passed Cas right back.
But it couldn’t hurt to lay here for another few minutes, could it? After all, Cas was very warm. Comfortable. He’d just lay here for a few more minutes.
“Of course Cassie’s up for a ride with you, Dean.” he said, hopping off of the bed and going to stand by Sam, putting his arm on his shoulder. “I’m willing to ride, too.” he said, squeezing the larger man’s shoulder. Sam turned a deep shade of crimson and Dean couldn’t help but to laugh at the obvious discomfort his brother was in.
Dean inhaled sharply as Castiel’s thumbs ran gently over his nipples teasing them until they hardened underneath his touch. Castiel’s eyes turned darker and the leaned over, sucking the peaked bud into his mouth. Dean gasped and his arms twitched, but he kept them where they were.
It that was the case, then fine. Dean could take that. But much more horrible scenarios were running through his head, and he had to know. He would leave once he knew Castiel was okay.

“Good going, Dean.” Sam said, looking up.
“I’ll keep that in mind. It’s good to meet you, Jo.” She winked and then turned back to T.V., elbowing Sam out of the way so that she could reclaim her seat.
Today they were going to face Casmiria. On her terms. At her house. And Castiel was going to be completely powerless. Castiel instinctively tightened his arms around the sleeping hunter.
“Where is your husband?” Dean asked. Mrs. Wilson scoffed slightly.
He pushed that thought away, shoving it down with all the rest of the things he didn't want to think about. He didn't linger in the shower, choosing to hurry so he could be sure to make it to work on time. Traffic in the city was awful in the morning. Normally, Castiel took the bus, but since he had to take Dean's jacket back to him, he'd have to drive today. At least he wouldn't have to worry about screaming babies or handsy old ladies.
“Cas, I…” he choked out and was soothed instantly with a kiss.
Dean personally thought they should have killed her, but the rest of them had talked him out of it. Disgracing her and turning her human had been enough, and there was no way she could ever get her powers back, anyway, so what was the point?
“Oh, Cas. Yes.” Dean said, pushing himself up and down on Cas’ cock. The angel moved with him, taking one hand off of Dean’s hips and placing it around the hunter’s length, stroking in time with each the hunter’s bounces. Dean moved his hands to the angel’s chest so that he had better leverage. Castiel tightened his grip and started pump Dean faster. Dean bit his lip as he felt the heat begin to pool in his stomach.
He hated this place, almost more than he'd ever hated anything in his life. It's wall were painted an off-white, neutral color that he hated. All of his furniture was second-hand, something he had picked up when he first moved to town, when he'd still been young and full of dreams. He could afford to replace it now, he could afford to replace the entire place, actually, but he couldn't find it in himself to care. It provided all his needs for right now.
“No.”
“Ready to roll?” Dean asked, as he threw his and Cas’ bags in the trunk. Sam scoffed a little.
“It-It’s Gabriel, Dean.” Sam said, his voice scared. “I don’t think there’s a doubt it’s Casmiria this time.” Dean was about to point out that they had seen the witch earlier today so of course it was her when Sam continued “And I think it’s safe to assume she’s after us.”
“Too long.” he said, causing Dean to smile.
“Sit, please.” She said. Dean itched to attack her but something about the way Casmiria was looking at him kept him from doing it. He sat down and allowed her to tie him to the chair. She repeated this process with each of the others (separating Sam and Gabriel, which neither of them were very happy with). As she was securing Sam, Dean spoke up.
“Oh, no, Dean, I’m going to make you come tonight.” Castiel said, smiling sweetly. He bent down and licked a strip up his lover’s cock, pausing to give careful attention to Dean’s head. Dean fought the urge to thrust into the sinful, teasing mouth. Castiel continued to push his fingers in and out of Dean while he was licking away the pre-come that was beading at the tip of Dean’s member. Dean was panting and moaning and finally he couldn’t take it anymore.
“So…” Sam said. “can we fly him out of here or are we carrying him for three miles?” Cas bent over and hoisted the man onto his shoulder.
“Let’s see we have: bottles, pacifiers, formula, baby food, diapers, baby wipes, baby powder, and a teddy bear.” She said, digging through the items in the cart. “Well, boys, it seems the only thing you are missing is clothes. They are on isles one and two. I trust you will be able to find them okay.” She smiled and walked off. Dean immediately made for the isles, ready to be out of this place. Sam and Gabriel followed a few paces behind him.
“Cas?” Dean asked softly, not wanting to wake him if he was asleep. Bright blue eyes opened immediately, fixing them on his own.
“Are you really trying to give me the ‘last night on earth’ speech?” Dean said, still a little breathless with laughter. Castiel’s blush was enough of an answer for Dean. “Oh, God, you are. Cas, man. Don’t ever change.” he said, patting the angel on the back. “I’m a sure thing, Cas. You don’t gotta do pick-up lines with me.” Castiel smiled, and leaned in to kiss Dean.
“How formal is your Christmas dinner? I have a suit I could bring. It needs to be pressed but – “
“First, you turn my brother into a child because you can’t handle the fact that he didn’t want you, and then you tried to use his own grace to kill him?!” Gabriel yelled. Dean stood back, astonished. He had never seen the archangel like this. Usually, the he preferred to sit on the sidelines and let the others do the dirty work, but Casmiria had pissed him off, and therefore she now had to contend with the full power of an archangel. Gabriel advanced towards her.
“Cas?” he called, trying the doorknob. It came open under his hand, which tied Dean’s stomach in knots. Castiel never left his door unlocked.
Dean was in the kitchen, cleaning up after dinner when he heard a rush of wings and Gabriel appeared. Before Dean could ask any questions, the archangel spoke in a rushed voice.
No, there was too many ways that particular plan could go wrong. And too many things that would have to go exactly right for it to work. Ironically enough, it was the exact kind of plan he would have gone ahead with once upon a time. Running in, guns blazing, and attempting to force whatever it was he wanted out of whoever he wanted it out of. That used to be his kind of plan. Reckless. Foolhardy. High probability of dying.
"I just woke back up." Castiel lied. He'd been awake since Dean had walked out the door. "And I couldn't fall back to sleep."
Dean sighed. Of course it was Cas. His boyfriend had a habit of texting him at work. He quickly typed a response out.
“It’s about time, kid! We thought you weren’t ever going to make it.” She said, throwing her arms around his neck.
She was the youngest of the victims, only 24, and the last one to go missing. She went missing just last week, from her one bedroom apartment where she lived alone. The rest of the missing people had families, dogs, mortgages. As far as he could tell, Lindsey was alone. That wasn’t the only thing different either.
In fact, Dean has just about decided on that course of action when Gabriel opens the door and climbs in.
“Okay.” Dean said, and caught sight of Castiel’s surprised expression.
The workday went by as normal, but Dean found himself anticipating lunch. He wanted to be with Castiel, to hold his hand and kiss him. They wouldn't be able to do much more than that in the hour and a half they had for lunch. But Dean didn't mind. He didn't think Castiel would either. When lunch time rolled around, Castiel was no where to be found, so Dean texted him.
“No, I guess not.” Dean said, grudgingly. He adjusted Cas.
Castiel, on the other hand was totally dressed, albeit without the trenchcoat. Dean reached up and tried to grab at Castiel’s clothes.
“I may have scarred your brother. It isn’t alright.” Dean started to laugh again.
Kudos and Comments are almost as lovely as you people who are taking the time to read this :)
Dean smiled. “There he is. I wondered what happened to him.”
"DON'T LIE TO ME!" Lisa interrupted. “I’m so sick of the lies! ‘Oh, I was working late tonight, sorry, baby. I’ll make it up to you.’” She quoted bitterly. “I’ve called the office, you know? To see when he’d be home. But he wasn’t there.” Much to Castiel’s horror, he could see tears in her eyes.
“Shh, baby, I got you.” he ducked his head and kissed his boyfriend. “Come for me, baby.” Cas cried out and he came, painting Dean’s hand and their stomachs white. Dean felt Cas spasm around him and couldn’t hold it back anymore. He came with a shout that sounded suspiciously like Cas’ name. He kept thrusting, riding out both his and Cas’ orgasm both until they were both thoroughly fucked out. Dean rested his forehead against Cas’, still breathing hard. He ducked his head to kiss Cas, and his boyfriend responded with such passion it surprised Dean. They broke apart and Dean raised an eyebrow at Cas.
“Naughty, naughty.” He said, and Dean could hear the smile. “You know you aren’t allowed to touch.” Dean felt Jimmy’s hand make his way from the back of his neck onto his chest. “I, on the other hand, can touch you wherever I want.” Dean let out a whine as Jimmy’s hand stopped just short of his cock. “Be good, and I’ll even let you come.” Jimmy said, before resuming his grinding against Dean’s cock.
“Yeah, but we don’t know if it’s her. Could just be some kids playing around, thinking ‘oh, cool, let’s play witches!’” He scowled.
“If we stay, we are likely to catch someone coming back here.” he said. “But also, we must remember that they are a witch, and they may very well already know that we are here. Perhaps they are staying away on purpose.” The angel scowled. “There’s no way to know for sure.” Dean nodded.
“And the last.” Castiel added, pulling a bottle of lube from somewhere or another. Dean nodded again.
It was late and Dean was tired. He was ready to get away from everyone else and just be with Cas. Really, there are only so many times you can go over a plan before it just gets repetitive.
“This one’s all yours, Sammy. I’ve done my baby time.” Dean teased, glancing at Cas. Sam wrinkled his nose but nodded. He stood up, bent over the bed and gathered the archangel into his arms. He stood up and transferred Gabriel to his hip.
“Come on, Cas.” he said as he pulled the car to a stop in front of the small building. “Let’s go do something productive for once.”
“What else is new?” he grumbled as he opened the back door and climbed in. Gabriel went around to the other side and got in. Dean pecked Cas on the lips and went around to the driver’s side door to get behind the wheel of his baby. Cas climbed in right after him and finally, they were all loaded into the car. Dean started the car and then reached over to crank up the radio before squealing the tires as they peeled out of the parking lot.
