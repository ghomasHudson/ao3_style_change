“Same as before,” Mycroft responds, nodding at John who nods back, “We’ll wait till Mary gives birth to plot out our best course of action… Except that now, she's ten times more dangerous with Magnussen dead. But until then, John will have to keep close tabs on her and try to maintain their relationship.”
“You want that don’t you? To consume me? Well… then do it John.”
He’s letting his emotions getting the better of himself but he just can’t…
Sherlock groans in response, tangling his tongue with John’s, his hands jerking fitfully in John’s grip as he makes soft, wet whimpers that send shivers down John’s spine.
Sherlock shudders in response, his eyes closing as he presses one more kiss to John’s lips before the man rolls out of his grip, sliding up and off the bed.
He towels himself off, stepping into the bedroom as John walks past him, shutting the bathroom door gently.
Will John be angry at him for not telling him about this earlier?
Of course he’d leave Sherlock to do it for him.
“It’s okay Sherlock, I understand,” John cuts him off, the other arm that’s curled around his neck shifting so that a hand rests in his hair, “You must have been quite tired after-”
Oh god.
He manages to catch John in time, thankfully, his arms reaching out to grab the man as he draws him down onto his side.
He can’t have any contact with his brother, otherwise, Mary might go back on her word, given the delicate situation she’s currently in.
His eyes are wide, sparkling in the dim light, his body flushed cherry red and wanting and-
“What do you want,” he pouts, but there’s little venom to it. John takes one look at his face and bursts into laughter again so Sherlock puts on a sour face and moves to crawl back up the bed.
John obliges, timing the thrusts of his index finger with that of Sherlock’s, each round sinking his finger deeper and deeper into Sherlock’s arse.
Sherlock lets out a choked laugh.
So when the time comes, he’ll just have to grit his teeth and help Mary and John through whatever circumstance that comes.
“So…” he hums, “How was that?”
“However, his company ran into debt due to the economic crisis so Mr Trevor had to shift back to Sydney to sort things out and eventually... so did his whole family.”
John can’t see Sherlock but he’s certain that if he had been here with him, the man would’ve flinched.
Sherlock grunts in response, lifting his hands up towards John in invitation so John sighs, chucking the soiled flannel onto the floor as he falls into Sherlock’s arms, wrapping his arms around Sherlock’s neck.
John doesn’t. like. men. God, why does he always have to make things hard for himself.
Sherlock lets out a loud sigh, collapsing into the chair opposite John’s as John’s eyes suddenly light up in realisation.
“To my knowledge, the connection should be much more easy to establish if there’s a stronger psychic connection between the two people. Hence, when you started to remember, I managed to reconnect with you. So try to remember more John, that might make things easier for our next meeting,” Sherlock finishes.
Just type whatever feels right, sweetheart.
“It was the morning before she died,” Cameron answers. “We had coffee at Starbucks and talked about a few things.”
He turns towards John, flashing him a self-assured smile as he takes in John’s shocked expression with relish.
So much for that plan.
“He appears to have hardly a care in the world now, quite an improvement from the boy I saw ages ago who believed that his future had been stolen from him due to a loss of finances.”
“Please just leave me alone.”
Sherlock pulls away reluctantly, pulling the plug up and off the drain as he turns to John, holding a hand out to the man as they both move to stand.
Irene feels like she’s going to spontaneously combust.
And presses down hard.
“You’re beautiful,” he’d murmured, his eyes fixed on Sherlock’s, his gaze licking its way across Sherlock’s flushed cheeks.
"He shot himself, making it impossible for us to make him retract that command, meaning that everybody in his network knew that you were to die if I did not make the jump. Which is why we had to make some modifications to the plan. I jumped so that you could verify my death, your word would have been the best proof for my apparent death that went unseen by anyone else other than the few that were in on the plan. We also refrained from telling you later for your own safety, something that I had initially planned on doing, lest someone come after you to finish the job or even worse, interrogate you over my whereabouts if they’d found out I was alive and we’d made contact. I could not let that happen John, I could not.”
Everyone knows that.
That eases another giggle out of Sherlock.
“What kind of question?” Sherlock responds in deep baritone, arching his neck to look up at John.
But enough of that- Sherlock remembers his childhood in fragments of happy and particularly bad moments but there was always one memory that had always been one of his favourites. He remembers watching his parents as a child, half-drunk and giddy with delight one Christmas evening as they swayed to slow music, swirling circles around each other. His father sure-footed and graceful and his mother fumbling precariously every now and then as they waltzed around the room.
WELLLLLL... school is a bitch (so is my brain that has forced me to write other stuff that is not this fic)
“Sherlock, come on work with me here,” John persists, turning on his side to face Sherlock, watching as the man’s eyes dart away from his, affixing their gaze firmly on the ceiling. “We have to talk about this.”
The only way is forward and hopefully, he’ll be able to fix this, fix all of this and have his and John’s lives back in one piece. However, righting his wrongs seems like an impossible venture right now and Sherlock isn’t sure if he’ll ever be able to completely reverse the effects of his actions.
“I’m clean,” Sherlock mutters, his eyes hooded, “Had to do a test when I got admitted to the hospital. You did too, before you married Mary and you haven’t had a separate sexual partner since.”
“That’s not the only thing worth noting about your appearance by the way-” John raises his eyebrows, a smug look plastered on his face as he untangles his hand from Sherlock’s curls, sliding his knuckles down to the man’s cheek, “-We’ve got such a long way to go…”
It’s 5 o’clock already. There’s not much time left.
“For you and me?” Moriarty intones.
He smoothes calloused palms over blush-streaked skin as he shifts his lips just so, his lips parting slightly as an inquisitive tongue makes its way over to Sherlock’s bottom lip, swirling circles over soft skin and Sherlock absolutely melts, surrendering himself to John.
They’ve never been safe, either of them and they never will be.
He’ll deal with that later.
Is this really what you want Sherlock? Is it?
another starts,
Sherlock trembles in answer.
However, she pauses mid step, the steps creaking as she turns around to face the doorway once again.
That should work? Shouldn’t it? It’s not like Moriarty truly wanted to die anyway.
John chuckles in response.
The plan now is to finish up "Until You're Gone" and then move onto a new fic that I've already written 3 chapters of LOL (pssst it's a little mermaid crossover). Subscribe to my account if you want updates on my fics I suppose haha.
Sherlock sighs, turning over to face the wall, curling up into himself, deep in thought.
There’s definitely someone else here.
Sherlock’s slumps back into his seat, his body shaking.
“Yes,” Watson says, looking accusingly up at him.
Oh fuck.
They’re silent for a moment, each one of them staring resolutely at the ground refusing to make eye contact.
Sherlock’s eyes travel down his compact frame, southwards towards the bulge in his pants and upwards towards the muscles on his chest. Sherlock’s gaze lingers on his jeans for a moment before he gulps, his pupils expanding as he fixes John with a pleading look.
John draws his fingers away from Sherlock’s face, Sherlock feeling like his skin has just been sizzled by a red-hot branding iron as John smiles warmly up at him.
But also about the parentage of her child.
John wakes up, washes up and goes outside to entertain himself as per his whims and fancies. He builds beaches, constructs meadows… he even bothered to create a waterfall one afternoon.
If he hadn’t been careful, John would have come right then and there.
“Sherlock, I know you’re still awake,” he murmurs.
“Since this is likely to be the last conversation I’ll have with John Watson...” he begins, turning to Mycroft. John inhales sharply at his words, expelling a painful sigh before Sherlock continues. “... would you mind if we took a moment?”
Sherlock looks on almost lovingly, watching John as he piles bacon onto both their plates.
It’s then that John’s gaze turns almost predatory, his gaze zeroing in on Sherlock, causing him to falter for a moment.
“As to what Moriarty will be doing, that’s easy,” Sherlock continues, growing uneasy, “His parting shot to me when we first met was ‘I’ll burn the heart out of you’ and yet, that still hasn’t come to fruition. It’s likely his first move will be an attempt to destroy me in some way or another, because only then can he reclaim the authenticity of his operation. Only then will he be able to rebuild his network and regain power over the splinter groups he lost through my involvement.”
“He,” Sherlock blurts out before slamming his mouth shut. His natural instinct to correct others is not working to his advantage right now.
I love you too, Sherlock.
“M’fine,” John mutters, forcing a smile which Sherlock seems to see through immediately, the man’s brow furrowing, “Just go on without me, it’ll be okay.”
There’s nothing much out of the ordinary to be honest. Just a small jar of sleeping pills (which seems to have gone unopened for a long period of time), a fine-toothed comb and brush (probably obtained from a hotel somewhere) and oh… there’s a picture.
He rises up off the ground, stumbling to his feet. He turns away from the source of the noise, walking towards the waterfall instead.
Where is he?
"You love me anyway," John responds and Sherlock has to bite back a grin.
I’ll thrust forward slowly, pushing merely the head in until your cries become too much and I push all the way in, holding onto you as I slap my hips up against yours, fucking you like an animal till you come.
“Oh gosh, I had planned to have you killed as soon as you woke up from that sleep of yours but my, my… I think a change of plans is in order? Don’t you think?”
And here he thought that he was about to be spending the day alone. A boring, lonely day just like any other day that he’s experienced after John moved out. Oh he does enjoy being proved wrong sometimes.
“...Emelia Ricoletti,” Mary says, staring down at her phone, jerking Sherlock out of his thoughts, “Unsolved... Like he says.”
He pulls the trigger.
“I’m not going to stop,” John growls, watching Sherlock’s pupils widen in response, “Not until you believe me wholeheartedly. Not until you can tell me with that pretty little mouth of yours how gorgeous you are. Is that clear?”
He dashes off to his bedroom immediately, tears threatening to form at the corners of his eyes as he strips off his clothing, hurriedly pulling on a T-shirt as he burrows under the covers.
Yawning loudly, he makes his way into the kitchen, filling the kettle with water.
John's chest has always been compact, solid and hard with a hint of pudginess. Massaging the pectorals there, Sherlock feels hard muscle beneath the thin layer of fat. Clearly, the man has been working out... maybe he did so to spend time away from Mary?
John freezes, his breaths stuttering before he sighs happily, nuzzling into Sherlock’s neck.
Sherlock turns around, feeling utterly lost and terrified. He knows that this conversation will hurt him, that John’s next few words will be sharp enough to strike him down. But, if it makes John happy, or gives him closure, then Sherlock will oblige him.
”Is it such a curious question?” Watson interrogates, his voice taking on a deliberately innocent tone.
This day simply couldn’t get any worse.
“Well if the bleach was placed there after death, then how did it get into their systems?” Lestrade questions.
At this, he motions to Cameron who scowls unhappily. He drags his feet towards the open door, sneering at Sherlock who promptly shuts the door behind them.
It hurts a little.
Sherlock heaves a soft sigh of relief before texting back.
“Oh, you think you’re so big and strong, Sherlock!” Moriarty yells as Sherlock breathes heavily, his hand still smarting from the pain, “Not with me!”
Sherlock takes a deep breath. So this is how it’s going to play out, isn’t it?
John pushes up onto his knees, making a quick grab for the bottle of lube on the side table as he aligns his body with Sherlock’s once again, stretching up to give the man a kiss. Their lips meet with great desperation, John’s soaring upwards to trap Sherlock bottom lip in between them, sucking the fold of skin in between his own.
“Oh please, please, I’ve been trying for so long to find you. God, please don’t ignore me now. JOHN!”
Yep, that’s because we’re taking her home.
He picks up the bottle of pills and cocaine from the bed, bringing them over to the squatting toilet in a corner of the room.
He scowls, stalking off towards his bedroom to change… and probably shower.
John stares back at him dumbfounded, his face a mix of confusion and suppressed rage.
“During the time that you’ve been sleeping?” John says, extending a hand. Sherlock reaches for it, holding it tightly as John hauls him to his feet. “Not much… I don’t think.”
“Thanks,” John replies, giving her a thumbs up with his face still plastered to the table, “I appreciate it.”
He can’t go back on that, he can’t.
“Sherlock, remember that time I told you I was going to Harry’s house…” he starts, looking a bit sheepish now, “I had actually initiated a meeting with Mycroft.”
"John please," he moans.
“But you can’t do that,” another set of voices in his head cry, “John loves you, he loves you so much. Can you imagine how horrible he’ll feel? How wrecked he’ll be if you tell him the truth? You don’t want that. You don’t want to go off to Eastern Europe knowing that you’ve ruined the best man that you’ve ever had the pleasure of meeting.”
“... Go ahead John,” he finishes, dragging John’s hand over to rest on the band of his briefs.
He smiles at John again who bursts into another round of giggles, sending Sherlock chortling along with him. He wishes that they could stay like this forever, in this bubble of warmth and happiness, where there’s only the two of them and the rest of the world is just background noise.
It’s him.
“Nah,” John responds, turning to face Sherlock now, “I’ve just been really sleepy as of late. Nothing to be worried about.”
The taxi lurches forward, forcing Sherlock to grab the bag of eggs hurriedly before it tumbles to the floor. He scowls, clutching the bag tightly as the taxi begins its trek towards Baker Street, swerving wildly around corners at a, probably, illegal speed.
Contact me on
“Nice,” John replies sarcastically, trying to keep a straight face.
It’s then that he feels his phone vibrate one more time. His chest constricts with dread, his fingers trembling as he scrolls down swiftly to read the text below.
, he whispers to himself, hoping to hell that it’ll work.
The voice on the other end is silent once again.
John mumbles incoherently at this, still refusing to raise his head.
“But what if I don’t,” John ventures, his chest filling with panic once again, “What if we don’t meet again because I screw up.”
It takes Sherlock all of three seconds before he cracks.
And then Sherlock starts giggling, laughing at the absurdity of it all because how did they end up here really? Why are they even dancing too geez this is ridiculous.
He raises his arm, extending it towards John, resting a hand on his shoulder. John lifts his face to Sherlock’s, who gives him a reassuring nod. John sighs, burying his face in his palms.
He’s got one more trick up his sleeve.
Hit me up on
“John,” he breathes, his cock hardening further in response, as does John’s.
“Did you really love Irene Adler that much?” he blurts out, still refusing to look Sherlock in the eye.
Sherlock lets loose an ugly sob.
“Don’t worry it ended up being pretty superficial,” he says, clearly having noticed the discomfort on John’s face, though misconstruing it for something else. “It just hurt like hell.”
He shuts the door loudly behind him, slumping against it to catch his breath.
“I didn’t mean that, fuck I didn’t mean that Sherlock I’m so sorry,” he babbles, breaking out in a cold sweat.
John smirks in answer, rolling his eyes as he drags Sherlock into the idling car by the kerb.
He might be about to die, but at least he’s going to die having the upper hand.
If he has to fight him this time, he is well prepared to do so.
“John, god please touch me-” Sherlock whimpers, reaching for John’s hips. But John shifts out of the way, deftly avoiding Sherlock’s grip as the man whines, thrusting up into thin air.
Sherlock, Mary’s water has just broken. I’m taking her to the hospital now.
“John,” Sherlock whispers, breaking John out of his thoughts.
“Your go,” is all he says as he slumps back onto the sofa, defeated.
“No it won’t,” John shudders, shaking his head as he burrows further into Sherlock’s arm, “Sherlock she had images of us, on that fucking day. I thought that this was over the moment that demon lady left our house. Well, apparently it wasn’t.”
Anyways, the situation would resolve itself when John came back from work so why should he be so hung up about something that was imminent anyway?
He extricates the petri dish from the spidery mesh, transferring it to the sink before proceeding to clear out the fungus, grabbing it in fistfuls and dumping them immediately into the bin.
“I missed you too John,” Sherlock breathes, “Missed you so much.”
At this, John’s hands reach southwards once again, his fingers tugging on the waistband of Sherlock’s boxers as if asking for permission.
Or possibly still in shock.
The bullet races towards the “him” on the floor, John yelling with all of his might at “him” to get out of the way as the bullet makes contact with his shoulder-
Sherlock sighs, shaking his head.
Sherlock’s brow furrows in confusion, his eyes narrowing as he does a full sweep of Mycroft’s face, trying to figure out whether the man is joking or not.
Which is strange, since everything in his world has been created by him.
He’s so beautiful, Sherlock thinks to himself, watching as John’s hair glows in the fading light, flecks of gold shining bright against a canvas of silky grey. How is he so beautiful?
“Yes,” Sherlock replies, smiling. He then turns to face John, John whose face is bathed in warm light, his blue eyes bright and sparkling. Sherlock looks away now, cheeks slightly red.
They’re most definitely emanating from his phone. Not John’s, John’s messaging tone sounds different.
“Please,” he moans, the words sounding foreign to him as John continues to gaze at him, enraptured, “Please just move.”
This has been his routine for the past 6 years or so.
“Fuck,” Sherlock exhales, his chest heaving as he props himself up on his arms to get a better view and John can’t help but smirk in response.
Sherlock exhales, leaning into John’s shoulder.
Without thinking, John makes a lunge for him, his eyes wild as Sherlock yelps, his lips meeting John’s in a firm press.
“What do you mean?” he breathes.
Also the inspiration for Sherlock dancing around with his violin came from Lindsey Stirling, she's amazing really.
He flicks his eyes downwards, away from John’s despairing gaze, struggling to reign in his tears.
Holds him like he should’ve years ago.
They eventually reach Baker Street, soft street lights aglow as they stroll up to the front step, still chortling and giggling.
“No,” Sherlock replies firmly, “No, it’s ok. You can-”
Oh god.
He’s resting on top of Sherlock now, one hand snaking its way into his hair as the other reaches out to cup his cheek, pulling Sherlock’s face close.
He’s wearing a pirate hat in the picture, a present from his aunt from an earlier birthday. He has no idea where it is now.
He sighs, turning to watch Sherlock again, the man gleefully shoving more chips down his throat as he plugs his phone into the socket in the wall.
There should only be one long-ish chapter after this one followed by a long-ish epilogue. The chapter might be posted in between S4 episodes idk tbh HAHA. The epilogue I will try to get up by this fic's first birthday. YES I KNOW RIGHT IT'S BEEN A YEAR SINCE I STARTED THIS MONSTER I SCREAM.
“I’ll love you… Always.”
His hands dart lower eventually, taking their time as they swirl circles into Sherlock’s abdomen and Sherlock tries his hardest not to make any embarrassing noises.
In this lighting he looks a lot more worn than usual, the dips and creases in his face emphasised… Or maybe it’s not the lighting and something’s happened in the time that Sherlock’s been sleeping to give him more cause for worry than normal.
Anything to make it stop-
So in light of the evidence, it wouldn’t make much sense for John to be standing right outside their door right now... but the man clearly IS standing outside their door right now, which means that there is a factor that Sherlock has neglected to consider... which makes him very worried indeed. Judging by the tone of his voice, John doesn’t seem to be angry at him so an argument is probably not what John came here for. In fact, Sherlock would even go so far to suggest that John sounded a little… scared.
He takes the head into his mouth and sucks, licking across the flaps of foreskin and Sherlock’s hips buck off the bed.
“I’m a storyteller,” Watson says simply, “I know when I’m in one.”
“I’m not entirely sure myself,” he answers. John giggles in response as his eyes flutter open, hauling his body up the bed to plant a soft kiss on Sherlock’s lips.
“I’m FINE,” Sherlock berates, his curls sweat soaked and sticking to his forehead, “Just FUCK ME ALREADY- OHMYGOD.”
It’s not rushed, or filled with passion, as all their earlier kisses have been. This time, it’s more solemn, more certain and Sherlock sighs as he kisses back, his lips undulating under John’s.
“Don’t mess it up. Don’t ruin all that you’ve done for him.”
But it eventually tapers off, their lips slowing as the two of them begin to tire, John from the stress of the day and Sherlock from the shock of the revelation of Sholto.
He caresses John’s face gently, playing with the short strands that stray over his forehead, rubbing soothing circles into his cheekbones.
Anyways, it’s been about a week since Sherlock’s been discharged from hospital and the only sort of conversations he’s managed to have with John in this tumultuous period of check-ups and routine visits to the hospital have been perfunctory texts like…
“John,” Sherlock murmurs when they part for air, gasping as he grips onto John’s shoulders, digging his nails into the skin there to get the point across, “John, please just-”
(See the end of the chapter for
“John’s worth it,” he spits, a bit of saliva landing on Mary’s face, which she wipes off with a scowl.
John’s face goes red in response and Sherlock smiles. He hadn't intended that innuendo.
He’s dressed in a blue jacket and checkered shirt, his hair neatly combed and face cleanly shaved. Which means that he’d woken up a lot earlier today. Sherlock glances at the clock. It’s 8 in the morning, so he’d probably woken up around 7? Maybe earlier?
That is all he has left, six months.
“Hope you got some sort of compensation for that.”
She grins sinisterly at him, Sherlock jutting out his chin in defiance as Mary reaches for the gag, the cloth unspooling in her hand as it falls from his lips. He coughs, once, twice as Mary continues to cackle.
John nods his head in understanding, following Sherlock’s lead, covering the tiles he hasn’t managed to check. None of them seem to be loose enough to lift.
And that is where he is going to lose.
“What came before this, what we used to be, maybe what even you used to be. Did you know that you were a captain in the army John?”
It’s Sherlock and John. And that is how it is supposed to be, how it is meant to be.
“John,” Mike huffs in exasperation, “John I know that he’s your best friend, but isn’t this a bit… much?”
“Alright,” John says, settling into the driver’s seat, flashing Sherlock a worried yet pleased smile.
Sherlock can date whoever he wants to date, even if that person isn’t John Watson.
“You’re beautiful, your voice, god, it's so deep,” John groans, burying his face in Sherlock’s collarbone as he continues to roll his hips, thrusting up into Sherlock’s body, the man clearly wrecked beyond the point of return, “You’re gorgeous… MINE.”
“Maybe he just likes rugby,” John posits.
”That’s the whole of it,” Sherlock continues, a warmth in his chest blossoming as he gazes down at the smile on John’s face. “If you’re looking for baby names.”
It’d been like a vortex, pulling him in with the man himself at the centre.
There’s a lady dressed all in white, her clothing slightly tattered and torn. Her body is glowing, incandescent in the twilight as she turns to face them.
It’s filled with everything, everything that John can’t say and Sherlock can feel the weight of words unsaid with every press and give of John’s lips, with every caress of his cheek, with every stroke of his tongue. John has never been good with words, only able to express his emotions through his actions and in some ways, that is better, better for Sherlock who suffers from the same affliction.
He remembers warm sunlight streaming through the windows as he basked naked in the light of their warmth.
Sherlock gives his head a violent shake, forcing away thoughts of John as he turns back to the groceries, proceeding to unpack more of the foodstuff.
“Sherlock, when it comes to you? Honestly, anything goes,” John beams, “As long as you’re you.”
And that’s becoming just as evil as the assassin herself.
He’s interrupted by the steady trill of John’s handphone instead, the vibration startling him as John makes a dive for the mobile device.
And how could Sherlock have been so stupid, how could he have not realised that he’d walked face first into a trap. If he hadn’t come here, none of this would have happened…
“But, I’ll probably have to go in and have a talk with him, confirm my theory,” Sherlock mumbles, gesturing towards Lestrade, “Lestrade if you would?”
John gives a prolonged sigh, raising his head to the sky, blinking several times before turning to face Sherlock.
His fingers brush past Sherlock’s abdomen as his lips come to rest up against Sherlock’s belly button. John licks the dip of skin there for good measure, eliciting a groan from above as he turns his attention to Sherlock’s hips.
“You only ever go to bed at half past twelve.”
He flashes an accusatory gaze at Watson, hoping that the man will finally take a hint and stop pressing him with ridiculous questions.
Sherlock huffs in answer, dropping a kiss to John’s forehead.
What the hell!
She’s silent as John’s gaze continues to flick between Sherlock and her, John’s eyes dark and dangerous, as if waiting for Mary to make her move.
He grunts, rubbing his eyes gently as he stirs, burrowing deeper into the mattress- and into someone’s arm.
“John if there’s something you really want to ask, go ahead,” he says softly, turning himself around to face John directly.
And to make matters worse, he’s gagged.
“My phone is dead,” Sherlock huffs, “Victor, in a fit of excitement, decided to introduce me to some new mobile game that apparently everyone’s been raving about.”
“- How could you possibly think that I’m beautiful? It’s not…”
He uncaps the bottle with the pills, withdrawing a large piece of paper half-hidden by the cap.
, he thinks as he shuts off his bunsen burner, striding over to the dining table to pick his phone up.
“Sherlock, this is baby puke we’re talking about here,” John is now smiling that lopsided smile of his. The one he wears before he’s about to burst into a fit a giggles.
He knows what’s going to happen when John growls, the sound reverberating through Sherlock’s torso as John’s fingers dig deeper into Sherlock’s skin, hard enough to leave crescent-shaped imprints and yet not hard enough to bruise.
Which is strange because Sherlock knows that he definitely locked the door before leaving. He pushes it open with his shoulder, hearing the hinges give a little creak before the door shuts quickly behind him.
“JOHN PLEASE, JOHN I’M READY, PLEASE-” the man wails, clearly tired out from the long drawn out foreplay and seeking some form of release.
Ok I think there'll be at least one more chapter of angst after this? Possibly two? We'll see. God writing Redbeard's backstory really did a number on me. I'm gonna go cry in a corner now. :,(
He sheds his dressing gown as he steps through the threshold, walking up to the mirror and  preparing himself for a shave-
Because John now has a family, a family that he has to cherish and take care of and Sherlock is coming in between them, coming in between John and his happiness.
“That’s because he didn’t want to get separated from us Irene! It was a huge crowd!”
He’d forced himself not to think about the driver in the past month. It was John’s to keep, the information John’s to read and Sherlock would truly be a horrible person if he were to look through it.
a voice at the back of his head whispers, planting a niggling doubt in Sherlock’s head.
John frowns for a moment, his brow scrunching up in confusion.
If Mary had made it up here, it should probably be safe enough for him.
“You’ll have to be patient love. However… there might be something I can do...”
“More than fine I guess,” Sherlock replies, “His father managed to get their family business up and running again so... he’s basically drowning in cash.”
His head comes to rest under John's chin, his forehead pressed against John's Adam's apple. John smells the same as he always does. He smells of his body soap and the salonpas he uses to keep his shoulder from aching, a scent that's uniquely his.
“Thank you, John,” Sherlock says, beaming at Watson who fixes him with a puzzled look.
“Er… Sherlock,” John starts. He feels a little on edge and slightly out of his depth. He doesn’t want to seem too curious because Sherlock would get suspicious, so he settles for a more subtle approach.
“So how long will you be-” Mrs Hudson carries on. Sherlock can see that John is tensing up, his left hand is clenching and unclenching again. He has to do something… oh.
“You’re safe now.”
He can hear Mrs Hudson tut-tutting about manners through the door. She eventually leaves, slippered feet stomping down the stairs to show Sherlock exactly what she thinks of his behaviour.
“John!” a voice in deep baritone calls to him.
It’s absolute madness.
He doesn’t need to think twice.
John had been shaking like a leaf all the way back to Baker Street, his eyes set and steely even as his body betrayed him, telling a completely different story. It had worried Sherlock to no end, John bottling up his emotions was never a good sign.
John tries to help him, reaching for Sherlock’s hand but Sherlock pushes him away, tugging his arm out of range as he rights himself.
“Mmmm… John?”
YQ: You like to prolong people's agony haha
“Well… He said that they were friends from secondary school,  that Victor was insanely intelligent and horrendously rich and… and to top it off he had a dog! That Sherlock LIKED!”
Mycroft shifts in his seat, getting up from the sofa to take a seat in John’s chair opposite Sherlock.
“Don’t look so surprised, of course we all knew you weren’t dead,” Mary rolls her eyes, waving her hand as if shooing the thought away, “I was, however, the one tasked with following up on you. I mean… I was supposed to succeed James if that’s what you’re wondering.”
When he’s satisfied, he uncaps the shower gel, working his way down the man’s neck and shoulders, massaging the tensed muscles he finds there.
John sighs.
He decides on the latter
Because Sherlock asking himself that question was one thing, but John asking him the exact same question? It was a different thing altogether.
Sherlock waits for John’s door to close before setting his hands on either rim of the sink, John is back, he’s really back. It’s not a dream or a drug-induced hallucination and Sherlock is absolutely thrilled. And he’s not just back for the night, he’s here to stay, here to stay for an indefinite period of time and Sherlock feels like he’s being wracked with joy. Everything could go back to normal, everything could go back to the way it was…
“I’ve never been able to reassociate that name with anything else,” he continues, Sherlock nodding sympathetically as he struggles to process this new information, “It’s like a black mark on my birth certificate that just won’t go away. I considered changing it to remove it but… I felt it was too much trouble and just never bothered.”
Sherlock rushes over to examine the object. John’s holding up a bottle, a vodka bottle in fact. It’s empty but there’s still a trace of liquid at the base of the bottle. And the liquid is colourless, as expected of vodka. Sherlock digs back into the recycling bin, pulling out a sheet of newspaper.
“John Watson,” he rumbles, shifting off John’s lips in favour of burying his lips against John’s ear.
Mary’s making me go out to buy croissants. Her cravings are really starting to annoy me.
“I brought my medical kit when I came over so... I can stitch your wound back up if it’s taken any damage.”
“Together?” he asks, his question a promise and an answer at once.
“You don’t have to,” Sherlock answers, “All you have to do is trust me.”
That’s good Sherlock, that’s good.
When will the next update be? Who knows? Not me. sigh... I don't have much time now with school. But I promise you this, that I'll definitely try to get the whole fic up by the time S4 airs. Confirm. I will try my best. And if I don't make it, it'll probably only be the epilogue chapter. Wow, when I started writing this thing I really didn't expect for it to turn into such a monster.
Mike waits with bated breath as John unlocks his phone, hoping that he hadn’t been right about Sherlock being in trouble.
Having come to a proper decision after the tumultuous day before (god, had John only just come back yesterday?), Sherlock feels immensely proud of himself. He finally has a game plan, a parameter to work within and he knows exactly what to do next.
“Oh come on Sherlock, I’m never going to be able to-”
John’s voice has started to wobble so Sherlock renews his grip on the man’s hand, tugging at his fingers gently to tether John back to reality.
He hears an audible sigh emanating from the bedroom (the walls were never really that thick) and the rustling of fabric as John shifts about on the bed, probably preparing to attack the scones.
“James Moriarty isn’t back in the form of a man, but rather someone or a few others have taken over the title, operating as if they’re Moriarty.”
“Sherlock I understand that this might be a sensitive topic for you,” John begins tentatively, his fingers still encircling Sherlock’s wrists, “And if it really is that sensitive, I won’t press it. But truly, I’d prefer it if there weren’t any secrets between us. Remember what happened the last time either of us tried to hide something from each other.”
He has absolutely nothing to do now that John is gone.
“Miss me?” he says sheepishly, smiling at John who happens to be leaning over his seat, peering down at him with great concern.
He thinks panickedly.
Sherlock’s eyes shoot wide open in response, his breaths picking up as John gulps, turning his eyes away from Sherlock’s.
“I think in would be a great idea,” John replies, grinning, turning to exit the room.
“Well, you technically already know half of the story,” Sherlock answers, struggling to keep his composure.
Sherlock thinks as he blinks back angry tears.
“JOHN!”
“You too Sherlock, you too,” he replies, and Sherlock can hear the answering smile in his voice.
The car ride back is almost unbearable.
The man is practically radiating happiness and satisfaction, his eyes gleaming in the lamplight as John’s eyes rove across his chest, admiring the bruises that are starting to form along his hips and the dark purple one that looks like it has been inked into his collarbone.
He’d yawned, assessing the situation before him.
He wallows in self-pity for a moment, his eyes downturned as he gazes forlornly out the window, watching the houses pass by-
John shrugs, nodding his head.
“Oh,” Sherlock breathes. He certainly hadn’t expected that. “Oh, of course,” he manages. He breathes an internal sigh of relief. So John doesn’t actually intend to leave him after all, or at least he doesn’t wish to have that conversation right now.
He remembers having a book of constellations that an aunt had given him for a birthday present, a book that he had cherished deeply. He remembers pulling out a torch in the darkness, pointing it at the book as he compared the constellations on the glossy pages to those that marked the night sky.
“It's what?” John replies, a little bit of surprise evident in his voice. His brow furrows, as if trying to puzzle out why his chair is in Sherlock’s room in all places, which means that he has to act fast to make sure that John doesn't find out the tru-
(See the end of the chapter for
“Not at all.”
The moment they make eye contact, the world seems to fall away, the space in between them suddenly feeling far too large and Sherlock cannot help but race forward, skidding on the carpet and into John’s open arms.
He cringes at the thought, turning his attention back to the photograph.
“That’s nice,” John replies, smiling up at Sherlock even as something dark and vicious starts to settle in his belly.
Sherlock listens carefully for John’s footfalls, waiting till the soft padding fades to the muffled crackling of bedsheets before letting out a deep breath he didn’t realise he’d been holding.
“Hmmm?” Sherlock hums, waiting for a response.
“Hmmm… didn’t know you were sensitive here,” John murmurs, kissing the arches of both of Sherlock’s ankles as the man in question moans, “I’ll have to keep that in mind for future reference.”
Sherlock gulps, unsure of how to proceed.
“Kind of shit isn’t it?” John laughs bitterly, “Knowing that your own wife didn’t really plan on marrying you for love but rather as a strategic advantage?”
Hah, he thinks to himself, Victor might have the upperhand in this battle, but he clearly forgot to feed Sherlock, not really boyfriend-ly of him huh? Maybe John does have a shot after all.
"I mean… do you think things would have turned out better for us if we’d made different choices earlier on?”
The bathtub is big enough for one person to lie in, possibly two if called for. And thankfully, this hotel provides bath salts. That’s always a plus.
John’s eyes dart downwards to the thatch of hair just below Sherlock’s navel, skimming across the dark hair and zeroing in on the engorged cock currently resting up against Sherlock’s belly, already red and twitching.
Sherlock knows that John loves omelette. It was one of the foods that Mrs Hudson used to cook for the two of them when he was still living at 221B and it would have been obvious to anyone at the time that John enjoyed it immensely. He hopes that after the emotionally draining night before that the omelette will succeed in cheering John up a little bit.
Sherlock mulls over this as John continues to press chaste, quick kisses to his lips, angling his head so that their noses don’t accidentally bump into each other, whispering breathy adorations every time he shifts away for air.
His head seems to clear as the bathroom begins to fill with steam, transparent water vapour condensing on cool air particles as the bathroom begins to get hotter and hotter.
“John, I promise you that before you came around, Sherlock had never once been to a rugby game, let alone stepped near the goddamn field,” Irene says, shaking her head, “Alright, if you don’t believe me on that account, then how do you explain why Sherlock chooses to sit near the bleachers to study every time you guys have practice.”
All the memories he has are of this new universe that he has made for himself.
“You have nothing to be sorry about,” John spits, cutting him off.
“Every time you FAIL...”
John blinks in confusion before slowly remembering the desert, the man bleeding before him.
Sherlock stiffens at the question, his fingers clenching rhythmically as he waits for John to finish.
“Sherlock,” John raises his voice a little. The man on the other end sounds like he’s treating this like a game, as if the only thing he’s interested in is understanding John’s predicament rather than fixing it. “Sherlock, I’m genuinely scared. Are you saying there’s a large part of my memory missing?”
“That’s not how the NHS works Sherlock.”
Sleep or sex? He’d be fine with either honestly, just so long as John is there with him.
“You don’t understand!” Cameron yelps, descending once again into tears
John takes in one more breath, steeling himself before closing his eyes, imagining the arid sands of the desert he’d last seen himself in, the street that he’d last seen his past self walk through.
“I- I’m sorry about just now,” John continues.
He feels a phantom pressure of fingers on his back before sleep claims him.
“It’s the only way to protect Mary,” he says matter-of-factly, “You know that.”
“Is this real?” he murmurs all of a sudden, remembering something… similar... from another place and time. Although, right now he’s not exactly sure what that is.
He relaxes at the touch of John’s hands as John rubs the shampoo into his skin, cupping his palms every now and then to draw water out from the bath, pouring it gently over his head. Sherlock closes his eyes, savouring the sweet, alternating pressure on his scalp and the feeling of warm water cascading down his cheeks as he inclines his head towards John’s, smiling softly at him.
“God do you know what your hair does to me?” John breathes, staring down reverently at Sherlock, the man’s eyes screwed tightly shut as he nostrils flare, “Those noises that you’re making.”
Are you touching yourself now?
“So… David… We're here today because of… Mary.”
“Don’t worry. Wiggins is an excellent chemist,” Sherlock responds calmly, the term “pregnant wife” stinging a little as he moves to Mycroft side, lowering a hand to his brother’s nose.
Sherlock groans inwardly. Oh god is this conversation going to be more insipid than he'd projected?
“Sherlock? Sherlock did I do something wrong? Have I been reading you wrong- I. Please just tell me...” John comes again, almost pleading.
John looks like murder, his face clouding over as he grips Sherlock tighter.
Sherlock’s cheeks redden with each declaration, his skin catching fire as John continues to spoil him with bold proclamations of tender affection, stroking his fingers over Sherlock’s burning cheeks.
John shifts his thigh all of a sudden, moving his body upwards to gain more leverage on him, his groin brushing against Sherlock’s navel and that’s when Sherlock realises that John is rock hard, the bulge in his pants pressing firmly down onto his stomach.
“No I didn’t! I really didn’t know… I mean I suspected but-”
Sherlock can only smile.
And gradually, their kisses start to become far more desperate, teeth clacking together as John once again tangles a hand in Sherlock’s hair, pulling him roughly upwards as Sherlock does the same, raking fingers harshly up and down John’s cheeks, dragging him down to meet him for bruising kiss after bruising kiss.
No, no, John thinks to himself, trying to shut the more primal side of his brain up, We’re just friends, it’s nothing more than that-
Wrapping his arms around John in answer, Sherlock begins to stroke the man’s back slowly, trying his best to soothe the man.
John takes a deep breath, shifting his hand to cradle Sherlock’s neck.
“It helps me think,” he says calmly, at least he hopes it came out sounding calm because calm is the direct opposite of how he is feeling right now.
Or maybe that’s not what Mycroft meant…
The wind picks up as Sherlock stills beside the private jet, the breeze tousling his hair gently as he turns back to face the dirt track they’d just come down.
At this, John yawns, burrowing under the covers. Sherlock follows suit, drawing the duvet up to his chin.
When he opens them again, the room has changed vastly. Instead of concrete walls, there are now clear glass panes, giving view to the dense nothingness surrounding him, a barren, flat sheet of white land.
Well… Whatever happens, John will probably still have Sherlock’s friendship to hold on to at the end of the day, and that’s still more than anybody could ever ask for.
Sherlock knows that he’s shaking. He can feel himself trembling with rage and it’s taking every ounce of his will to not strangle the murderer sitting right in front of him.
He watches as David stiffens, his hand freezing in mid air as he reaches for the tissue box in front of him. He seems to hang there for a moment, his body trapped in some cruel limbo… And then in the blink of an eye, he breaks, his facade crumbling as his eyes begin to well with tears.
“Not at all,” he answers, watching with unabashed glee as Watson steps forward, raising a booted foot. He aims a swift kick at Moriarty’s back, his boot colliding with the man’s body with such a force that Moriarty stumbles and flails and finally… topples over the edge of the precipice, down into the pool below.
Sherlock moans in answer, his cock twitching as his fingers tighten their hold on John’s back.
“It seems fine,” John announces, jerking Sherlock out of his internal moral crisis. John’s left arm coming up to swipe away the sweat from his forehead, “It seems like the doctor who treated you used dissolvable stitches… so we don’t have to bother with removing them. That aside, your wound does seem to be healing quite well, you should be-”
“Nah, the school security was really thick. I’ll bet up till now they still haven’t figured out who did it,” John grins as he pulls out the key to their front door.
He should probably give the man a chance, rather than pass judgment on a person that he’s never met before.
“I mean, I shouldn’t have done that- er, gotten that close to you especially since there’s that guy that you like. Sorry if I made you uncomfortable… in any way,” John breathes, looking extremely upset. His bottom lip quivering slightly.
However, John had blinked and the fearful look had dissolved. Schooling his face into something more plain, Sherlock had used John’s arms as leverage to right himself, fixing John with a neutral gaze before escaping like a frightened doe away into the bathroom.
“Err…” Sherlock mumbles, mind wading through the thick, syrupy vestiges of sleep, “Did you- Were you- Was it… ok?”
He feels a thump against his back as John presumably settles himself down in front of the door.
“To: John,” it reads in neat cursive.
5. If you follow me on tumblr you would know that I said this chapter would be over 10k but no it's not. That's because I decided to divide the plot up a little bit more which means you guys are getting the next chapter sooner than normal! Yay! Hopefully by next week if nothing goes wrong uwu
Sherlock cringes a little at the pet name, his heart sinking like a stone as John smiles at Mary, giving her a quick peck on the cheek. He nods at her one last time before traipsing back towards the car, leaving her alone on the sidewalk.
Sherlock chuckles, clutching the man tighter. John seems absolutely exhilarated.
John smirks up at him, a playful grin alighting on his face.
“What’s going on?” he questions, frowning as the lady in question turns to face him, fixing him with a disgustingly insincere smile.
“Just- read it again,” John mutters, burying his face in his hands.
Wait.
John stirs, his eyes fluttering open and fixing themselves on Sherlock’s face. He grins sleepily, instinctively reaching tired hands to Sherlock’s face, rubbing his cheekbones gently.
“We can't let the chef miss out on his own cooking can we?” he chuckles as he transfers half of the omelette to the spare plate. “You can have your cake and eat it too you know.”
He flips the photo frame downwards, setting it down before he bursts into giggles.
“Tickets?” Sherlock’s eyes spring open, suddenly feeling very much awake. “Wait what tickets?”
She’s always dressed to kill, donning sleek, shimmery dresses (and occasionally high heels) for classes and lectures.
They lie there for a moment, simply enjoying the warmth of each other's bodies, their fingers tracing paths down each other's backs, John’s following the dips and creases of Sherlock’s scars while Sherlock pays special attention to John’s bullet wound.
There’s a rustle in the corner of the room.
“This okay?” he breathes as he slips the final finger in, watching as Sherlock nods furiously.
He’s been stoically ignoring her though and had even fallen asleep soon after she’d knocked on the door for the third time.
“Sorry?” Mike apologises, even though he’s not particularly sure what he’s apologising for, “but I think I’m missing something.”
God, Mary will be so insufferable.
John gulps.
We made it.
I loved you so much but I only realised after I jumped from Barts, I'm sorry.
Mummy Holmes crosses her arms, staring angrily up at the stairs.
“NOTHING!” John cries, throwing his hands up into the air. “Nothing at all geez!”
Shit, was he not supposed to have done that?
“What’s Earth?”
And it hurts.
He clears his throat, taking a deep breath, glancing up at Sherlock in undisguised frustration.
“Sherlock,” John repeats, his voice sure and steady, readying himself for any answer that Sherlock is about to give.
It could be anyone honestly, knowing Mary. But there is one likely candidate...
He doesn’t want to go down and face his furious mother just yet though, the idea of remaining upstairs far out of her clutches sounding more appealing than anything else.
As expected.
He’s never going to take it off.
The air in the room seems to thicken, a dense, syrupy ocean that washes over the two of their bodies, settling deep in their bones.
He pauses for a moment, wondering if Mycroft will finish this deduction for him. However, Mycroft remains silent so Sherlock continues.
He can’t believe it.
“You know,” Watson says again, shifting awkwardly and pointing at Sherlock.
It's not going to be some insipid conversation.
“I mean, you love to dance. And you dance really well, I mean you’re gorgeous really when you’re dancing-”
But it's too much pressure, too many thoughts jumbled in an incoherent mess inside his head and Sherlock has no idea what to do, no idea what to say.
John had turned to him just before they’d walked through the threshold, smiling as he pulled the door open, waving Sherlock in. Their eyes had met for a moment, a brief moment, but Sherlock remembers it all too well. When their eyes had connected, it had felt like a zing of electricity had passed from John’s body to his, sparking a warmth in Sherlock’s chest that he hadn’t felt in a long time.
The room is deathly quiet.
He waits for a while, listening carefully for a response… but none comes.
But then again, is that what John had really wanted?
He pulls the trigger.
“You know,” he begins, “It’s rare for us to sit together like this.”
He smiles at the memory, his grin mimicking the one adorning the young Sherlock’s face in the old photograph.
He forces himself out of bed, mind still groggy as he slips his bedroom slippers on and-
John's eyes have reverted to that glazed over look from before, his thumb continuing its path across Sherlock’s cheek, rubbing lightly over the outline of his cheekbones.
“Yeah… You’re right,” John groans, tugging at his fringe fitfully, “I’m… just… Yeah, ignore the dog bit please.”
What?
“I’ll take that as a good sign,” John chuckles before licking a long stripe up Sherlock’s shaft, Sherlock’s body twisting sharply in response as John sucks him down once again.
“No, those are my words, not yours!” Watson exclaims, sounding almost angry, “That is the version of you that I present to the public: the brain without a heart; the calculating machine. I write all of that, Holmes, and the readers lap it up, but I do not believe it.”
5.53 p.m. the electronic surface glares at him.
The moment John hears the sound of rustling fabric, his eyes shoot wide open, his gaze taking on a hungry quality as Sherlock blushes, tugging his shirt and pants off.
John grins in answer, his blue eyes lightening for a moment before he turns away to face the window, Sherlock doing so in turn.
“Sherlock,” John says, struggling not to laugh, “If Mycroft couldn’t keep a secret, they wouldn’t have put him in charge of the British government.”
He can feel John’s heart beating through the thin fabric of his clothing, his body singing as John tangles his tongue with his, both of them simultaneously sighing into each other's mouths at the contact.
They might end up having sex after all.
He’s glad he’s taken the drugs.
John grins at the sight, turning away onto his back.
“... don’t you?” Moriarty finishes as the room continues to shake. “It’s tearing your world apart not knowing.”
He turns around, walking sullenly off in the direction of the dorm. At least he can get some sort of respite there whilst Sherlock gets to enjoy a night out with his new boyfriend.
, he thinks to himself again.
John should be here any moment…
He has to.
Sherlock gifts him with an answering smile.
“She told me not to,” David is sobbing now, his head shaking as he rocks back and forth on his heels, “Said bad things would happen to me if I did… I didn’t know what to do. I’m sorry.”
“How… How?”
Conversation with my friend:
He shakes his head viciously, his palms coming to cup his ears.
“Well,” John mutters, stepping back into Sherlock’s personal space, leaning in deliberately, “What are you going to do about it?”
“NO!” Sherlock all but yells, startling John for a moment. “I... I’m free. I’m definitely free to go for the… the… thing.”
And worse.
The man’s chest eventually stops shuddering, his sobs reduced to wheezes, his previously tear-soaked eyes now red-rimmed as his face falls onto Sherlock’s chest, tired and defeated.
“We'll change and meet you downstairs,” Sherlock continues, nodding in John’s direction. John nods back. He smiles, getting up from his seat and making for the stairs. To be honest, Sherlock is absolutely ecstatic about John’s enthusiasm. It truly feels like the old times again. He remembers one of the rules he had made for himself earlier, that he has the responsibility of ensuring that John is comfortable and happy and this does fit the criteria. And yes, he will endeavour to enjoy every moment of it, he thinks to himself as he rushes off towards his bedroom as well.
he thinks into the space between them before shutting the bedroom door with a soft ‘click’.
They kiss for a bit longer, their lips coming together in a slow, elaborate tango as they meet each over and over again eagerly.
John looks up, meeting Sherlock’s confused gaze.
He remembers now.
And John can’t take it anymore. Thoughts of Sherlock and Victor swirl round and round wildly in his head, thundering down in a great cascade of jealousy. Because Victor is perfect, Victor is amazing and Sherlock loves Victor and... and… fuck is this is the most unfortunate thing to happen to John Watson because he’d thought… from the start that-
“Fact is, we’ve all made mistakes, some worse than others,” John carries on, once again lifting his eyes to Sherlock’s, “I asked you back then what you think would have happened if we'd made different choices back then… And well, now I think I finally have my answer.”
It’s old, ancient really. It’d been taken when Sherlock had been about 12 years of age.
“The setting is a shade melodramatic,” Sherlock quips, ignoring Moriarty as he gesticulates at the waterfall, “Don’t you think?”
Well, then again, back then wouldn’t have been any better…
He peels the sheet of paper off the photo frame slowly before flipping it around.
“Who?” Sherlock replies, determined to play as little a part in this conversation as possible.
“Like what?” Sherlock whispers back, feeling his body slackening as it melts into John’s.
(See the end of the chapter for
And right before his eyes, grass had begun to sprout from the ground, their green stalks twisting and turning their way out of the earth as one particularly large one rose higher and higher, its bark thickening as its branches stretched out towards the heavens.
“I’M HERE MURRAY. I’M COMING!”
“That’s fine.”
It’s just at this moment that his phone goes off too.
He opens the file explorer application, mousing over the USB drive icon before clicking on it.
The query startles Sherlock for a moment, his eyes widening in shock before he follows John’s gaze, tilting his head up to face the ceiling.
“Okay,” he responds, rubbing his eyes. Propping himself up on one arm, he watches as John grabs a towel, making his way to the washroom.
“JOHN IT’S ME. OH GOD JOHN. ARE YOU THERE?”
John and Lestrade are looking absolutely gobsmacked as usual. John’s jaw hangs loose before he recovers himself, beaming at Sherlock.
“Sure!” John replies, chuckling even as a little bit of disappointment begins to settle in his stomach. “It’s perfectly alright. Are you free the day after?”
“I’m touched. I’m honoured,” he says, still smiling rather creepily at him as Sherlock steps forward once again.
The corner of the shelf is coated in spidery white fungus, a petri dish barely visible through the stringy mess of dust and mould. He scrambles off to his bedroom to grab a handkerchief, tying it tightly around his neck before proceeding to clear out the detritus and dirt from an experiment long forgotten.
, the first message reads.
(See the end of the chapter for
And there's the punchline.
John pauses for a moment, stopping in his tracks, as if considering Sherlock's proposition. He raises tired eyelids, giving Sherlock a once over before closing the space in between them, planting a quick kiss on Sherlock’s lips.
“But… People used to make fun of them…” he whispers, trembling a little, “Are you sur-”
“After all, you do owe me a Dragonite,” Sherlock chuckles and John shakes his head.
“Thank you so much for all that you’ve done for John and I. It has truly been a pleasure to have counted you as one of my closest friends and I am humbled by how much you’ve done for me in the past few days…”
Well… There had been the incident with the desert that had been completely out of his control…
Sherlock fights the urge to roll his eyes.
“Sherlock, I can’t shake the feeling that this is somehow my fault or other and it’d be great if I got some FUCKING CLOSUR-”
Hopefully, if Sherlock plays this right, Mycroft might not call any attention to it.
That moment is short-lived though because all of a sudden Moriarty hisses, baring his teeth as he raises his arm, jabbing his fingers harshly into the crease of Sherlock’s throat, taking him by surprise.
“You have no idea-” John mumbles when he breaks away for air, his breaths ghosting across Sherlock’s lips as the man shudders, clutching John’s shoulders tightly, “- how beautiful you are, god.”
“Sherlock please don’t do this to me!”
Sherlock smiles as he finishes the last of his tom yam soup, watching as John grabs his own bowl, slurping the soup up contentedly before placing the bowl back on the table with a loud rattle, as if still hungry for more.
(Read 9:20 a.m.)
Curious.
“You can’t possibly be serious,” Sherlock all but yells, his face livid as he glares at John, searching the man’s eyes for an answer.
Sherlock hasn’t seen it since that fateful night. That night when he’d forcefully revealed Mary’s true identity to John and told John that everything that had happened up till then had been entirely his fault. And to top it off, he’d nearly suffered a stroke.
“Oh… oh…” he breathes, gazing at Sherlock besottedly, his eyes soft and open.
John would never have been prepared for the sight that greets him.
He frowns, flashing a confused look at Mycroft and Mary as their concerned faces swim into view.
Sherlock had thought about it as he had wondered at the possibility of a lifetime with John, considered the likelihood of them being together, not just platonically but romantically, for the rest of their lives, that maybe things would have turned out better if he hadn't done the things that he had.
When’s the last time you had a scan?
“There’s always two of us,” Watson answers, his voice crisp and clear, loud and confident. “Don’t you read The Strand?”
“However… You can be as possessive as you want when… we’re alone. I find it quite… appealing,” Sherlock blushes as he says this, burrowing his head deeper into his shirt and John has never wanted to kiss him more.
His fingers are bloodied, his brow sweat-soaked and his cheeks caked in a thick layer of dirt.
But this is for John’s good.
Sherlock screams.
“John’s unprecedented move back to Baker Street has set in motion a series of events, each inevitable in their own right,” Mycroft starts, voice grave, eyes boring into Sherlock’s, “However, John’s exceptionally timely return has accelerated their progress.”
Cold air hits his face the moment he steps out onto the street, the icy breeze a sharp contrast from the warm, comfortable temperature of 221B. He sets off for the nearest Waitrose (the food’s always better there than the stuff at Tesco’s anyway), pulling his coat collar up to shield his cheeks from the chilly air.
And yet… it’d been the right thing to do.
“You’re amazing.”
John seems to have come to a similar conclusion. His hands are trembling, shaking as he turns the package over.
Sighing deeply, Sherlock sits up, listening to the click of the shower and the sound of rushing water as he reaches for his dressing gown, slipping it onto his naked body.
“Alright,” John replies, beaming brightly, “alright.”
But this is what John needs right now, he needs to feel.
“Oh,” Mike breathes.
“The landlady was the one who found them," Lestrade answers, too tired to even respond to Sherlock's impoliteness with a retort. "She lived on the floor above her tenants and had been renting the flat out to one of the deceased women for quite some time."
Sherlock obliges, taking a seat.
“I love you too-”
And whoever said that Sherlock Holmes had to date John Watson anyway.
“John… John? Whadya mean?” he murmurs, wiping his eyes once more as John chuckles softly, almost sadly, pressing a chaste kiss to his lips.
“No,” Sherlock answers firmly, pressing the condom packet further into John’s palm, “I want this.”
but Sherlock is impatient and is most definitely not in the mood for that right now.
“Sherlock, it was the best I could do under the circumstances,” his brother had said, “I do believe that you’ll make it through and I promise you that I will do all I can to ensure this mission’s success…”
“And one last thing Sherlock,” Mycroft says, whipping around just as he’s nearly out the door.
“David… do you clean often?” Sherlock butts in, “This is extremely important.”
He stares till his eyes begin to adjust to the bright white letters on the screen, his vision seeming to mould around the words as he waits for Mycroft to send another text promising the safety of Lily.
“Mary was the last person to be here,” David answers, “Before she came… I mean… She was also the last person to be here.”
John could’ve died, he could’ve very well died. The fact that they’re both alive right now is nothing short of a miracle and Sherlock is determined to treasure it.
But he can’t.
He clearly doesn’t believe a whit of what he’s just said.
Also I haven't managed to do a full readthrough of this chapter yet so if there are mistakes I'll come back and fix them later
There’s a short pause as Watson mulls over his words before continuing.
“You’re being awfully dense now John, I really hope you know that-”
He panics a little, wondering if John will realise that he’s using borrowed words, mistaking a simple joke for a statement that he’s still not ready to give. Oh god, even his subconscious is trying to wrestle him into a confession.
“Sherlock, can I ask you a question?” he says.
John suddenly stops mid-sentence, his face taking on a ghostly pale colour as he fixes his eyes on Sherlock’s shoulder. Sherlock frowns in confusion, turning to stare at the spot that John is looking at and oh, oh no.
John allows him to carry on for a bit, patiently waiting as Sherlock continues to lavish attention over his chapped lips, his tongue sliding over the dips and creases in the skin as he soothes John’s skin before nipping at it again, biting down gently on soft flesh.
There are soft fingers tangled in his curls, fingertips tracing circles gently onto his scalp.
“John thinks that Sherlock’s got his eyes on Victor Trevor,” Mike replies, “you know, Sherlock’s secondary school friend whom he hasn’t met in years.”
“What was that you said?” John questions, his brow furrowing as he turns his head to face him.
He hears voices yelling in the foggy darkness.
He really isn’t.
“As said before, I’m clean, you’re clean. We’re both clean. And adding to that pile of information, I cleaned myself in the shower just now in case of this eventuality so no we don’t need condoms.”
“John,” he murmurs, hanging up his coat as John does the same, “What say you have a bath?”
“Yeah... yeah of course,” Sherlock finishes, slightly dazed as he flicks his eyes towards John’s.
“On your knees, Professor,” Watson orders, staring Moriarty down who flashes him a dumbfounded, annoyed look. However, the man does comply, falling to his knees.
Just another boring morning...
“-which I rather fear you are,” he continues, swallowing deeply.
“That in your case, solitary confinement is locking you up with your worst enemy.”
“And you weren’t lying,” he smiles, brushing the back of his hand down Sherlock’s neck, reaching for the chain hanging limply there, “You’re the most unique, most… intriguing person I’ve ever met. And I could never ever love someone more than I do you.”
A conductor of light - that’s what he is, that’s what he always will be. Sherlock turns to John now, watching as the park lights shine bright onto John’s grey-blonde hair, casting a halo over his short, stocky form. He smiles softly as he watches John plod steadily on, footsteps in time with his own. Yes, John will always be a marvel to him.
I’ll be there (Received 2:50 p.m.)
“If this is some half-hearted attempt to spy on me, I-”
“Yeah,” John responds, shifting closer to the dog tags to hear Sherlock better. The dog tags seem to be pulsating with a weaker glow now.
“Have you dusted the bleach bottle for fingerprints?” Sherlock asks.
He drops his violin for a short moment, breathing heavily before raising his bow to the strings once again.
He knows that John hadn’t told Mary about his departure. She certainly wouldn’t have allowed it, with her being pregnant and all, so of course it was only a matter of time before she called him. What he hadn’t known was the catalyst for John’s seemingly hasty decision to disappear. Apparently something had happened at work, most likely an argument that had soured quickly. Sherlock sighs as he takes a seat on his chair, steepling his fingers, preparing to come up with a way to go about comforting John.
Thankfully, before his thoughts begin to spiral any further, John becomes aware of the heavy weight of the dog tags against his chest, the two tags clinking together as he heaves another breath.
Watson pauses at this, seemingly gathering his wits before continuing.
“It’s not the fall. It’s never the fall.”
“I never said I had any issue with you leaving,” Sherlock retorts, reaching for a knife which he plunges almost immediately into the stack of pillowy discs, slicing his pancakes in half.
“Positive.”
John moves to sit up, tugging himself out of Sherlock’s grasp as he shifts towards the edge of the bed.
John reels back the moment Sherlock mentions the word “Mary”, the disgust in his posture clear as he visibly retreats inside himself, struggling to come up with a response to Sherlock’s declaration.
“It’s fine,” Sherlock mumbles, John can feel a warm patch on his shoulder where SHerlock’s tears have fallen, “I didn’t expect you to remember. After all, that hadn’t exactly been the best of days for you. Leaving your wife-”
“Please don’t.”
He hears the dogs before he sees them.
“What are you?” he asks, his voice trembling slightly.
Sherlock sighs.
“Now as a matter of fact,” he says, just as the car slows to a smooth stop.
The man smiles weakly at him in answer, gingerly picking up his spoon before proceeding to toy with his food, rearranging the rice before scooping a sample into his mouth.
John instinctively starts to panic, his breathing increasing slightly at the thought of being plunged into loneliness again. Thankfully, Sherlock seems to sense his fear.
John swallows, blinking shyly before raising his head, looking Sherlock directly in the eye.
“John, what was in that bathroom… It could possibly have been bits and pieces of broadcast equipment,” Sherlock explains, “The wires… She would have needed to hide the more incriminating equipment somewhere.”
It had been a connection that he had been loath to sever.
If John hadn’t known that he was screwed before, he sure does now.
No good will come of him just sitting around and doing nothing.
“No one can hurt you now,” John breathes again before kissing Sherlock’s forehead once more, chapped lips brushing against alabaster skin but Sherlock doesn’t believe it.
It feels absolutely heavenly.
He’s nestled comfortably in John’s arms, tanned skin meeting pale white as John’s arms stretch around his torso, holding him close.
It seems like she’ll have to settle for humour again.
I’m sorry.
It doesn't work, Sherlock’s starting to succumb to his mounting hysteria, his whole body shaking violently now.
The door to David’s house appears to have received a fresh coat of paint quite recently, the surface smooth and glossy. He’s lived here for a while, definitely… so when was it painted? It seems to have been an act for appearance's sake so maybe before Mary came over? Who knows.
“You truly are unbelievable,” John smiles, his eyes sparkling as he reaches out, patting Sherlock softly on the shoulder.
Sherlock feels like his heart is going to explode out of his chest.
He sighs as he digs through his old chest of drawers, pulling up the well-worn gilded telescope that he’d adored so long ago, the one that he used to take with him to the treehouse in the backyard when he was young and he had Redbeard.
He’s just about to say something when John pipes up.
He pads over to the windows, shoving the panes open before peering outside.
“I'll tell Mycroft when we get home,” he says, “End this, end all of this. I believe that the safe house is in Sussex somewhere. It'll be nice.”
Ah well, it doesn’t seem like he can do much under the circumstances anyway.
“Mine,” John whispers as he speeds up, listening as Sherlock groans, digging his heels deeper into the curve of his back. “Mine… Mine… Mine.”
“Here, let’s share,” he says, handing the pair of chopsticks to Sherlock as he shifts the packaging towards Sherlock’s side of the table.
Sherlock sighs, reviewing the information several times over before giving it up as a completely hopeless endeavour. Hopefully, Mycroft’s security will be able to protect them for the time being while his brother struggles to extract information from any relevant parties.
He could do anything, anything that he wanted.
“I’m gorgeous,” he murmurs this time, his voice a little louder and this time, John rewards him with two thrusts in succession, stealing the air away from Sherlock’s lungs as the man gasps, his hips rolling downwards to meet John’s cock.
“Why did Mycroft tell you this?” he breathes, his voice crumbling, “Why did he tell you-”
“Fine… Fine…” he says calmly as he takes a seat opposite John, Sherlock moving to stand by him. “I've been uh… good.”
All he knows is that it probably isn’t going to be soon.
“John,” Sherlock replies gently, squeezing John’s hand before continuing, “You know perfectly well why I couldn’t do that.”
John nods in response, his eyelashes fluttering against Sherlock’s cheek, sending Sherlock’s heart pounding.
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock nearly steps forward, making his way into Watson's arms before someone groans in disgust, uttering a loud “Ugh.”
There are lights on him now, shining brightly into his eyes from overhead as he fumbles through the undergrowth.
“Nearby, I suspect,” John answers, “It’s probably down the block. If we walk fast enough, we should be able to catch it before it disappears.”
"The warmth of John’s fingers, however, are a stark contrast to the cool of his skin. So when John begins to draw patterns once again onto the scars, the dips and creases of mangled tissue on his back, Sherlock feels them all the more strongly, as if John’s fingers have left fiery trails across his body."
The first thing he notices is that he's surrounded by a sea of honeyed beige.
“I’m a possessive bastard Sherlock,” he mumbles, trying desperately not to think about the bulge in Sherlock’s briefs that has just aligned with his thigh, “This night is supposed to be about you, not me. I don’t want to make this bad for you-”
“Ok that’s enough,” John chuckles. “I didn’t manage to memorise all of that the last time and I probably won’t be able to this time. We mere mortals don’t have sufficient mental capacities for mind palaces, remember?” John smiles and says as he saunters into the kitchen, taking a seat at his usual spot… or at least that used to be his usual spot.
"Here, though the world explode, these two survive,
Think positively, he says to himself, his hands cut and bruised, his face throbbing with pain. Even though Moriarty has the upper hand… he can still beat him.
“Sherlock… Sherlock you’re gonna have to take off your shirt for this to work,” John mutters, sitting down on the edge of the bed next to Sherlock, eyes fixed resolutely on his medical box.
He needs to see John, needs to be in his presence again, needs to touch him and hold him and know that he is real-
John knocks his head against his study table with a resounding ‘thud’, squeezing his eyes tightly shut as he scrambles to concentrate on the medical text in front of him.
John sighs as he bends forward to inspect the dog tags further.
“I’m not going anywhere.”
But he can't, not now.
Those are the only real memories he has to hold onto.
He thinks as he steps into the room, the steel door slamming ominously shut behind him.
John loves Mary, not him....
He looks happier than he has in ages, definitely much happier than when he had been married to Mary. So much has changed since the day that Mary was finally out of their lives forever. David had taken in baby Lily, caring for her as a single father (Mycroft had helped make some financial arrangements for him to ensure that Lily was well looked after) and John had moved back into Baker Street… permanently. And this time, he had moved all his stuff into Sherlock’s room.
“You will look after him for me, won’t you?” he says as Mary reaches out to him, wrapping him in an embrace.
John smiles at him, cocking his head sideways cheekily before pressing his lips back to Sherlock’s, kissing him languidly as the hand not covered in lube begins to stroke Sherlock’s inner thigh, sending a shockwave of sensations up his body.
“That’s because I do up my hair and wear fancy clothing, John,” Sherlock spits, “That much is obvious.”
“John”, Sherlock intervenes, resting a firm hand on the man’s arm, “Take a seat, let me talk to him. It’ll be fine-”
Because Mary is toxic. She’s single-handedly poisoned the well between her and John, basing their whole relationship on a lie and rolling with it without any ounce of shame.
Might not be able to hold her off forever though.
John grins widely at this, his face positively radiant and Sherlock can feel his own face mimicking John’s.
Sherlock had turned back to his textbook, murmuring to himself even as his cheeks turned a bright shade of pink and John had grabbed his stuff and made his exit right then and there.
It has always been something that has irked Sherlock to no end, that despite his vast intellect, he'd met his match in a simple, middle-aged londoner who has a penchant for sweaters and scented baths.
He groans further as John slips a finger in between his cheeks, stroking the furled skin there, gently.
“For the sake of Mrs Hudson’s wallpaper,” Sherlock starts, ignoring his subconscious, schooling his face into a cool expression, “I must remind you that one false move with your finger and you will be dead.”
Mary growls, drawing a gun from the pocket of her jacket. She thrusts the barrel up against Sherlock’s heart, cold metal up against Sherlock’s convulsing chest as his heart rate speeds up.
However, John seems to pause for a moment, as if the food were foreign to his tongue, causing Sherlock to panic a little. But the man eventually begins to chew, swallowing slowly before spooning another lump of rice into his mouth.
He’s a little surprised that he’s actually smiling in the picture, a rare occurrence in any of the early photos his mother had taken. It’s a radiant toothy grin, filled with joy and exuberance.
But something stops him in his tracks, his arm stilling as he freezes where he’s squatting, his body locked in a grotesque limbo.
John’s being extremely careful with Sherlock’s fingers, handling them so gently that one would think that they were made of glass. Normally, Sherlock would be annoyed by the gesture but for now...
This is it, he thinks to himself.
Sherlock blushes in answer, his cheeks reddening as John giggles, pressing a soft kiss to the skin there.
He nips experimentally at John’s lower lip, his endorphin-addled mind somehow thinking that that is a good idea.
“The shoe didn’t fit it’s owner. Hence, the usage of rocks to ensure the owner wasn’t swimming in it. It could have been a man with small feet or a young boy, balance of probability says young boy.”
And it’s only a matter of time before one of them gets hurt again.
“Yes, indeed you are,” he replies, with an air of gravity.
Sherlock’s cheeks redden as he gets himself out of his clothes, tugging off his shirt and toeing off his pants sluggishly before turning to John shyly.
How’s the wound healing? Sorry I can’t come over to check up on you personally, I’m a bit busy at the moment. I hope to find time soon.
“Sherlock, do quit moping and come down and help!”
“They’re here,” Mycroft says, his eyes steely as he turns to Sherlock who quickly contorts his face into a blank mask of impassivity, resting his hands behind his back.
Back then he’d written it off as friendly affection, amplified by alcohol and the excitement and enthusiasm that John had for his upcoming marriage.
“I had all the details perfect,” he says, trying to ignore the dark look that Mycroft currently has adorning his face as the man takes a seat next to his, glaring down at the ground as if it has personally offended him. “I was there, all of it, everything! I was immersed.”
“Er, Sherlock,” John starts.
His friendship with John is all that he has now.
It’s 5a.m. in the morning and Sherlock is wide awake. He'd woken up at around 4 in the morning, shivering violently and immediately regretting sleeping without the covers on. He’d burrowed under the cotton duvet instantly, but the damage had been done. There was no way he was going to get back to sleep at that rate.
He wouldn’t have said that unless Sherlock was supposed to know who it was. People like him are careful like that… which means-
“Good morning to you too you git,” he smiles, unwinding himself from Sherlock reluctantly, “I wouldn’t have woken up so late if you hadn’t tampered with my alarm clock.”
He sighs, shaking his head as he turns towards the cashier, the space behind the register empty.
He’d noticed the clock the next day.
John draws a harsh breath at this, his pupils expanding as Sherlock lifts a hand to John’s side, stroking the curve of his torso gently.
He hadn't been there to soothe John through the loss of his best friend, hadn't been there to love him, to care for him.
He’s the king of deductions and yet he didn’t manage to figure out this one important thing that was staring at him right in the face.
“That would never have happened Sherlock,” John is shaking his head vehemently, his eyes now a solid cerulean as he gazes back at Sherlock.
“I kept you alive,” she says simply, staring him down, “Those months when Sherlock was away. Who fed you when you were too depressed to feed yourself? Who gave you shelter in her home when you couldn’t bear being alon-”
In truth, there are many things that Sherlock would like to tell him, but all avenues of conversation that he can think of are heavily emotionally charged and will probably result in him revealing more than he wishes John to know...
There’s nothing, absolutely nothing of interest.
Sherlock barely stops for breath as he makes his way up the stairs, keeping up a constant stream of deductions as John follows from behind, nodding every now and then even though he knows that Sherlock isn’t looking.
“Sherlock, I-”
It’s all his fault really, he shouldn’t have come back from the dead, shouldn’t have made his presence known to John, shouldn’t have insinuated his way back into John’s life.
“However, no matter how protective you’ve ever been over your friends or even me, never have you ever infringed on our privacy or personal space and I know for a fact that you’d never willingly do so-”
And even though it may not be much, or even what Sherlock wanted...
A lady (who for some reason looks like Lady Carmichael?) walks down the aisle, probably the captain. She flashes a broad grin at him, uttering a  “I trust you had a pleasant flight, sir” before nodding at him and walking away.
Sherlock now remembers why he hasn’t done grocery shopping in years.
Janine who he’d managed (somehow) to maintain a false pretence of lovers with. He’d always felt extremely uneasy whenever she’d pressed her lips to his, feeling the need to reciprocate to maintain their facade (at least until he could use her to get into Magnussen’s office), but simultaneously feeling like energy was sapped out of him, bit by bit, every time his lips had touched hers. It’d felt terrifying and distressing but he’d done it anyway.
“We don’t have to do that, you know,” John says when he’s finally regained his ability to speak, “We can do all the stuff we’ve done before.”
“I know you said that me going back to Mary was what you wanted-”
Sherlock can’t possibly be saying what John thinks he’s saying? Right?
Where the hell is he?
“I’m so-so-sorry,” Sherlock stutters, tears streaming liberally down his face as he arches his neck upwards, his forehead bumping against John’s gently, “I’m so-sorry-”
He remembers his lovely telescope, the one that had had his name embellished on it in gold. He’d bring it out and pretend that he and Redbeard were sailing the high seas, that they were pirates on a special voyage to somewhere Far Far Away.
At this, John flicks his gaze abruptly upwards, meeting Sherlock’s eyes and it’s as if all the light has been sucked out of those blue eyes. John stares solemnly at Sherlock with mouth slightly agape. His lips are quivering.
“You might want to hold onto something,” John grins, flashing Sherlock a downright filthy smile before taking the head of his cock into his mouth.
The door to the warehouse opens with a rattle and creak, the rusted hinges squealing in protest as Sherlock steps onto the dusty wooden floor, his eyes roaming around the building before coming to rest on a door, ajar, on the second floor.
“For godsakes, stop doing that and get on with it or I will-”
It’s dark now, probably a little past six. The light from the doorway illuminates John’s figure, casting the man’s face into shadow. He’s seated in the chair next to his bed, a hand gently resting on Sherlock’s shoulder.
But wait… Does he really need John’s help. The man might be somewhere in the next room but isn’t it better if he deals with Moriarty on his own?
Interestingly though, the man seems to have a genuine liking for plants, inferred from the row of cacti and succulents on the shoe rack (completely devoid of shoes) outside his front step.
It’s a strange and weird feeling. He’s done this with a few of his other boyfriends before but this? This feels… different somehow, probably because it’s Sherlock.
Sherlock rolls his eyes.
“Sherlock!” John almost yells, almost panicky now.
“Long story short, Redbeard saved me but he was bitten,” he continues, willing his voice to remain calm. “The police department went down to shoot the rabid dog and Redbeard was sent to the vet. There was nothing we could do for him,”
“Ah yes, my voracious appetite,” John chuckles, slipping a hand down to cup Sherlock’s hip as he presses a kiss to the man’s cheek.
The room is now back to normal, back to dirty concrete walls and drab upholstery, even the en suite toilet is back.
It takes about an hours worth of driving and one wrong turn before they arrive at the crime scene. In the interim, Lestrade had been showing John and Sherlock the case reports and the photos of the evidence they had collected.
“Yes?” he calls out tentatively, voice feeling slightly hoarse, “It’s me. John.”
He stops counting, his brain going temporarily offline. One of John’s hands is clutching the torchlight and moving dexterously over the surface of his skin but the other hand, The Other Hand, is currently resting, palm-down, on Sherlock’s chest - right over Sherlock’s heart.
Will John have eaten by then? He should probably get some food ready too. That thai place that they’d eaten from the first night John had come back does takeaway. He’ll give them a ring too.
“Are you one hundred percent certain that John and I are in danger?” Sherlock prods, watching Mycroft carefully.
Sherlock shakes his head, slightly bewildered.
I hope you guys enjoyed reading this chapter as much as I enjoyed writing it. Ok tbh I cried a little at every reread... but it was enjoyable... somewhat HAHA
He shoves the thumb drive into his pocket, making his way up the stairs.
By doing this, he at least has a shot at reclaiming those pictures. He knows Mary might just end up releasing them anyway once he reaches and attempt to kill him but… how could he just sit there and do nothing?
“More to the point,” John interrupts, deliberately changing the subject of the conversation, “What have you been doing?”
And yet.
Sherlock scrambles out of bed in an instant, dashing towards the door.
“Mike! He always shows up for our study sessions, he always does! What if something's happened to him?” John mutters through gritted teeth, anxiously clutching the edges of his textbook.
And John does a spectacular twist with his thumb on the crown of Sherlock’s cock and Sherlock is coming, come spurting in between their bodies as Sherlock cries out in relief, his body convulsing and dragging John under.
It’s John who draws the moment to a close in the end.
Oohoooo ;) I guess we all know what's coming next chapter HAHA. Tune in in... one or two weeks? We'll see how this goes.
Sherlock tries to collect his wits but John flashes him a goofy smile, wrenching another giggle out of him - which in turn causes John to giggle.
Well, he’ll probably be fine with whatever happens if John is safe and happy.
Oh god, John- no Watson’s not going to bring this up again is he?
He groans in annoyance, burying his face in his pillow.
It was a plain, simple digital clock, hanging on the wall opposite.
And before long, they’re asleep, their limbs tangled with John’s arms wrapped around Sherlock’s torso and Sherlock’s legs entwined with John’s, the happiest either has been in the past six weeks.
It’s starting to wear on him.
There's nothing on the thumb drive. Absolutely nothing whatsoever.
He dumps the petri dishes into the basin in the sink, filling it with water as he begins to scrub the bases clean.
“You said you wanted me to be yours didn’t you?” he starts off tentatively, “Wanted me to belong to you.”
Sherlock cocks his head to one side, scrutinising Mycroft’s face. His brother isn’t usually this accommodating and he certainly wouldn't ask him for his opinion on things such as this. He should have spelt it out for Sherlock already… Something's up.
His shoulder hurts though. Oh god does it hurt.
How could she?
John had really meant it when he had said that they’d have to do a lot of walking. The collection is expansive with exhibits flooding the rooms, spilling over from one floor to another. By the time Sherlock finishes one final comb-through of the initial exhibition hall, it’s three o’clock in the afternoon.
"There’s a warm patch on his shoulder where John’s lips have been and it’s like little threads of liquid gold are radiating from that very spot, threading through his arteries and veins and it feels like his heart is melting."
So John had never told Sherlock about his sexuality, after all Sherlock had barely ever discussed his since that fateful encounter with Irene, making it harder for John to segue it naturally into a conversation.
“And then what?” John says, pressuring him for a more detailed answer.
It has a full page advertisement for a weight loss programme printed onto it, with a smiling woman in the centre. Sherlock upends the bottle, allowing some of the liquid to drip onto the sheet of newspaper. They watch as the lady’s smile starts to swiftly disappear, leaving the spot where the liquid had fallen a dirty white.
he thinks to himself, staring sadly after John’s lone figure,
Smirking gleefully, Sherlock flashes John a wide grin before grabbing the pillow, proceeding to bring it down right over John's head.
“Another story for another day,” Sherlock smiles, raising a hand to stroke a long line down John’s back. “For now…”
John plugs the drain and sets the taps running. He puts the toilet seat down, gesturing for Sherlock to sit on top of it, which he does, taking John’s offer gratefully.
Sherlock shudders, leaning into the touch.
He props himself up, turning over so that he’s now facing John, their faces inches from each other.
Sherlock grimaces at his voice, keeping his eyes firmly shut.
And that seems to be enough for John.
“David this is extremely important,” he begins, intoning the words calmly as David lifts his head out of his palms.
John chuckles again, raising his eyes to Sherlock’s. Sherlock offers him a small smirk, staring back at him wistfully.
He’d never thought her to be so cruel.
“Yes John, it is,” he can practically hear the smile in Sherlock’s voice, “My mother used to make it for me when I was little. It’s an old recipe.”
Sherlock nearly chokes, John’s sudden proclamation hurtling him back to reality.
He’ll not be able to hide it anymore.
Sherlock doesn’t think it’s possible for John’s fist to clench any tighter than before but apparently it is.
John smirks in response, his eyes sparkling as he locks gazes with Sherlock.
“It would have been you, not me and fuck Sherlock I can’t have you stolen from me again,” John rasps as he wraps his arms around him, hot tears coating his cheeks as he begins to tremble, “I will not lose you.”
Finally, something that he can answer.
He peels off the pillow and sits up, a frown plastered onto his face, finding himself staring at a John Watson whose eyes are sparkling and full of mirth. He's trying to reign in his chuckles but is failing miserably.
He stumbles away in horror, picking himself up off the ground as he begins to run, his heart thumping violently in his chest as the voices begin to get louder.
Because either way, John is going to suffer. He might end up being proven guilty or incarcerated and done in for abetment if Sherlock is proven guilty. Both outcomes aren’t exactly pretty and Sherlock wants to avoid them both as best as he can.
Oh, fuck.
John's voice is breathy and hoarse, serrating the words till they're rough and raw, the sound cutting through Sherlock like a knife.
And that’s when it happens again.
, Sherlock thinks to himself as his cheeks once again flare with heat.
“I swear to god-”
“Then I’m doomed,” John mumbles, his voice just barely audible over the thick fabric of his jumper.
Sherlock had never asked John about Sholto, come to think of it. He barely knew anything about the man, aside from the research he’d done on him before the wedding. John had never mentioned Sholto to him, in fact, he’d never really talked about his army days at all. But Sherlock is certain that if Sholto had really meant that much to John, that he would have at least mentioned him once? Because they had definitely been close, the way they’d danced around each other at the wedding had convinced Sherlock that they had to at least be ex best friends.
He has no memories from BEFORE, assuming there was even a BEFORE.
It's John who closes the final distance between them... which is not much of a surprise really. In all of Sherlock’s fantasies, John had always been the first one to make a move.
Sherlock's lips curve into a soft smile.
How did he get in?
After all, this isn’t the first time he’s had this nightmare.
“Yes love?” John responds cheekily, pulling off with a soft “pop”, “How do you feel?”
“And what were these ‘few things’?” Sherlock prods.
And that only serves to infuriate Mary further.
The desert, John immediately thinks. He flinches instinctively, fighting the wave of nausea that starts to build as he remembers the man (Murray was it?) lying half-dead on the ground.
It’s easier to start work on blank canvases after all.
“Well, thank god for that because without that time difference, I wouldn’t have been able to have gotten everything sorted out,” his brother answers self-assuredly.
Sherlock’s already fast asleep, his chest rising and falling in a slow, fluid motion even as the beginning snuffles of a snore begin to permeate the surrounding air.
“Hey John!” one of his drunken rugby mates calls, “Why didn’t you introduce us to this guy sooner. He’s a hoot!”
He watches as Magnussen turns to him with a self-assured smile, his grin stoking the blazing fury within him as he glares back at Magnussen.
“But we both know that grown adults make mistakes sometimes,” Mary continues calmly, “and that sometimes they need a budge in the right direction to help them along the way.”
“He probably wished to fit in with his newfound friends, his gang, probably even tried to dress the part. Hence, the shoes. He clearly wasn’t rich, this wasn’t a supplementary pastime, as indicative of the fact that if he’d really wanted the shoes so badly he could have just had them tailor-made.”
“No, it’s not that,” John says, still trying to cover for him, “He goes into a sort of trance. I’ve seen him do it.”
He finishes in about 10 minutes, under the hawk-like gaze of his flatmate who seems to have made it his personal duty to ensure that Sherlock finishes every last morsel on his plate. They get up from their seats and John fishes around his trouser pocket for a while before withdrawing his old leather wallet, pulling some cash out to pay for dinner.
He watches as John steps out of the lift, his fingers clenching before unclenching again swiftly as he follows in his wake.
Sherlock’s skin is cool where the alcohol swab has been, a far cry from the warmth of John's skin, an unpleasant coolness that makes him feel bare and bereft. He suddenly feels a growing desire, a burgeoning hunger for more of John’s naked flesh against his. He wants John’s hands back on him… desperately. But HE SHOULDN'T BE THINKING ABOUT THIS BECAUSE JOHN IS MARRIED AND NOT TO HIM.
There is absolutely nothing to do, absolutely nothing at all… but OH.
He’d grown up in a household that hadn’t exactly been supportive of that kind of thing so he’d kept himself closeted. And even though he was now technically free from the punishing constraints of his family, he’d still been loath to come out.
, John thinks to himself as he dips Sherlock at the end, like they’d done so before when Mary had still been around. Except that this time, when John lifts Sherlock back into his arms, Sherlock kisses him - without fear, without hesitation, without restraint.
He'll just brush it off and go home, mention it to Mary and laugh at him with her, laugh at his flatmate’s stupidity at thinking he could ever have a shot with him.
Mary’s face seems to do a little flip, her eyes open and surprised for a moment before she clams back up, the light in her eyes fading once again. It’s as if she’d instinctively thought that John was referring to her when he used the word “partner” but quickly realised otherwise.
This little remark gives Sherlock swooping butterflies in his stomach. John has just implied that there will be a
But Sherlock we can sort all of that out later! Focus on this first instead.
“What?” Mycroft questions, a concerned look on his face.
John flashes Sherlock an apologetic look, seemingly upset with himself and that is simply
Sherlock’s been here before, he’d taken up a semi-permanent residence here when he’d gone through rehabilitation. Mycroft had refused to check him into a centre and had instead brought a team of doctors and psychologists on site to deal with him.
Oh god, something's definitely wrong because John rarely breaks down like this, rarely shows himself to be vulnerable and breakable unless he truly is upset.
The proclamation startles Sherlock, shocking him so much that it nearly shakes the very foundations of his reality.
He groans miserably, drawing the blanket to rest further up his chin as he screws his eyes tightly shut.
