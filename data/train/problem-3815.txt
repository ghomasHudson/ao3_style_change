“You would make a kick-ass physics professor,” Val says, because the way he’s sticking himself in one box is too much for her. “Liven up the usual boring dross.”
“We should go,” Dean says, before Cas can answer. “If you’ve lost it anyway, we might as well get out of here, right?”
“The other day, I wouldn’t have said so. But now? Now, I think you’ve got crap to work on, like you say, but I’ve seen you support him and reach out to him, and I’ve seen the way you two look at each other. Don’t get me wrong. Love isn’t enough. It doesn’t wipe away everything else, and if you tear at each other, it doesn’t matter how much love there is. But maybe, if you keep working on it, you can be good for him. Besides, aren’t angels all about devotion? The look on his face when he sees you, it’s pretty clear who he’s devoted to.”
That’s weird. Normally, when she wakes from a nap to find she’s not pulled a blanket over herself, she’s chilly. Instead, she’s cozy and comfortable. Protected.
“Maybe we should give it a rest for now,” Sam says, before Castiel has to say anything. “I could go for some food and if we have no leads we might as well get some sleep tonight.”
“I hate to say it,” Riva says, “but she does have a point. The amount he must have taken, the state he was in when I got here, let alone the way you say he was earlier, he’s going to be wanting more. I didn’t find any on him. Did you?”
“As far as I can make out, he’s no worse than before. I have no idea what to make of any of this. It’s not like I have a load of training in how to treat angels.”
He can’t cope with the thought of properly hearing either one of them. Not right now. Maybe, once he’s rested, he’ll be able to listen.
“Please, Dean. As though you’re better than me. You’ve been a demon. A baby-Knight, even. And you killed Death himself, so anything I’ve ever done is automatically less awful than what you’ve managed. Though I suppose I should thank you for that last one.”
“Okay. Okay, if I really speak at Cas like I’m attacking him, if it could have added to him being messed up, then yeah.” He meets Sam’s eyes. “But I’m not the only one doing this. No. You say I shielded you from Dad, but you still grew up in motel rooms and still had a gun instead of a girlfriend. You said that, more than once. Don’t tell me it hasn’t left you screwed up, too.”
“Don’t offer a solution?” Dean asks, like he isn’t sure he’s heard right. He shakes his head and huffs in a way that screams he’s not in his wheelhouse. “Sounds like the kind of thing that should happen over beer.”
Dean does pause, though, until Castiel closes his mouth again. The regret flashes again as Dean goes on.
“Not like this,” he goes for. That’s true enough. The time Cas was out cold for ages, it was when he’d just taken on Sam’s pain, and as far as Sam knows that hasn’t happened here. Besides, there was no fit that time and he didn’t pass out right away. Sam remembers the blank eyed look all too well.
‘Today is important, Sam,’ Castiel finds himself saying, because this, too, is something he’s trying out, this teasing between family and friends. He isn’t very good at it, but he made Claire laugh the last time he saw her, and that’s more than enough incentive to keep going. ‘You should treat it with the respect it deserves.’
He isn’t sure why the realization causes a pang. He wants to leave, he has to. He needs to find his blade.
He doesn’t say he’ll try and get Cas to come back with him. There’s no sense inflating Dean’s hopes.
“It was more than that,” Castiel says, but he can’t quite force the feeling into human language. It wasn’t just loneliness. It was something with which Castiel is even more familiar: it was disconnection.
The seeping light had petered out, until only a few dim filaments leached from Cas’ body into the air. Cas was nearly dark.
The floor isn’t stable. It gives under his feet, the tip of one wing sinking into the boards. He can’t feel the drag of it, but he sees it.
He doesn’t understand. It’s a feeling he’s grown far too used to over the last few years. He would truly like the chance to become unfamiliar with it, to find it strange.
“It’s not like it’s the craziest thing any of us has ever done, Dean,” Sam said. “If it’s this or watch Cas die, I say we risk it.”
He turns back to the living room and leaves the powder where it is. The twinge in his wings is something he can ignore. After all, he’s been doing it for years, to some extent or another.
“He didn’t like you acting like he was weak,” Beth says, and looks exasperated at Dean’s expression. “I didn’t need to ask him. I know what that feels like.”
She thinks she might be guarding Cas, but she isn’t so sure any more what from. Dean, still. The way he shouted at Val, the way he stalked toward her… Beth pulls her cardigan more tightly about herself, and tries to forget the way she froze up.
If he stays in bed, he’ll insult Beth’s generosity. Dean and Sam let him stay in his room, but this isn’t his room, not even as much as the room in the bunker was. Getting to his feet is painful, and his hand twitches as he thinks of tipping white powder out, of taking it into him and pushing so much of the pain out. At least for a little while. But he hasn’t got any powder with him, and his supply is very low. He will have to make do.
It does. Of course it does. But it has hurt just to stand, or sit, or lie down, for so long that it’s become meaningless. He doesn’t think saying that will stop Riva and Beth from looking concerned. He chooses silence.
With the background noise of the needles, he feels his mind drifting. It’s been almost a day since he last took the powder, and every particle of him aches. Seeing Dean has knocked something loose in his mind, and all of the thoughts he’s been working to keep settled in the lower reaches of his mind are rising, winding around each other and brushing against him.
Sam holds her gaze, but he doesn’t push it any more. He just needs Beth and her friends to loosen their hold on Cas, so there’s at least a chance to talk to him. He’s not going to make Cas come with him, or even make him see Dean. But Cas should know how much Dean misses him, at least. He should know they both want him home. And to be able to have that conversation, he needs to persuade these women to leave him alone with Cas once Cas is awake.
Dean isn’t sure he wants to know what the usual caveats are. In any case, Cas pushes right on and asks about Ereshkigal. Inanna’s face sets.
“I didn’t protect you well enough to keep you out of it all,” Dean says. “And it’s not like Dad knocked me about. Sometimes I just needed telling.”
Val refuses to leave Cas’ side once Riva passes on the fact that Sam’s on his way. She seems to think Riva should have been able to stop an FBI agent from arriving in a public building.
Val doesn’t dare move too much. Something about the way he’s spoken, his gaze fixed somewhere in the middle distance, makes her think this is a rare thing for Dean, and that this is some middle-of-the-night spell. If she draws his attention to how he’s sharing, he might stop.
It takes effort to haul himself upright and off the bed, and his feet sink into the carpet in a way that seems odd. Wrong. Too physical and real and now.
Cas nods, but his expression shifts into the one he uses when he’s telling Dean something that seems obvious to Cas and that isn’t obvious at all to Dean until it’s pointed out. He’s told himself he’s going to do better at listening at those times, so he pauses.
“Okay,” Sam says, cutting a look at Dean and Cas, even though Dean is pretty sure Cas has stopped paying much attention. “You come in, you stay behind us. First hint of anything, you get out. Okay?”
“Yeah. Yeah, no, I get you. I do. I just… Cas hears a dismissal, Sam, I’m sure of it, when we just think we’re not tying him down.”
“I’m fine,” he manages. He has to clamp his mouth shut, jaw tense, to avoid the chattering noise inside him from flooding into the room.
“When did you use me?” Castiel asks, because he isn’t sure what Sam is counting and he finds he needs to know.
“I live to drive,” Dean said, the light dancing in his eyes all the more disturbing for the fact his eyes could flicker to black without warning. “But the sooner we get this done, the sooner we can scrape the black from my eyes and get back to showing Cas around the bedroom.”
He knows this is only a glimpse. After all, these women who have taken him under some sort of care see him as a victim. He knows that much. Months of watching TV have made him familiar enough with what they’re suggesting. They think he’s a victim of some kind of abuse, and a drug addict, and injured past the point of being able to be of real use in their world.
Beth feels for him. Even the day before, she doubts she would have done, but now? Now it’s different, like Dean said.
“But we’d be there if Dean needs us. Or if he needs bringing back from…from being that thing,” Sam said, taking a few steps towards Hannah. He still had a tight grip on his own hand. “We could help. Better than being stuck here.”
Anything else Riva says washes away unheard. He dropped his blade. He dropped it and it isn’t there. An angel doesn’t leave his blade, not if it has any choice. He’s already dropped so much else, and now he’s dropped his blade.
Cas’ door is closed, and Dean frowns. He told Cas to keep that open. Not like the guy sleeps or gets up to anything kinky. At least, if he does, Dean hasn’t caught him at it yet. And it’s all too easy to flash back to Sam, barely concealed panic in every line of his body, carrying Cas’ sword out of the bathroom. Sam hadn’t wanted to tell Dean how he’d found the angel, and Dean can’t blame him. He almost wishes he didn’t know. He does wish he hid the thing better. Cas got it back all too quickly and refuses to tell Dean where he keeps it.
Realisation sets in, cold and chilly and not caring at all that she only has a few scant facts to work with. She could be about to say something monumentally stupid, but her instinct is good when it comes to protecting the people she cares about, and it’s screaming at her now.
“You want to know how I found you?” Hannah asked. “I heard Castiel’s prayer. I followed that to the building. And then I followed your prayer to the room.”
He took hold of Cas’ hand again and hauled the guy up, part of him worried that Cas still didn’t have the strength to manage it himself. Cas let him do it, a fond look in his eyes. Had that been there all the time? Or was Dean just noticing it now he’d kissed Cas?
“Seem to be. I only just got here a bit back, and they were all eating breakfast. No-one was at risk of being shouted at, far as I could see.”
“Don’t worry,” she says. “I couldn’t remember it right after looking at it, and this time we just saw heat haze.”
“Well, go on, then,” Val says, catching Dean still staring at the joined hands. “Tell us about you and Cas.”
He wants to ask her if it’s him that’s the problem, whether she’s worried he’ll leave, or if it’s something else entirely, but he feels trembling running through her body. She’s crying. He tightens his arms, splaying one hand out across her back and cradling the back of her head with the other.
“He’s still beat up,” Val says. “Says he hurts. He seems…I don’t know. Happier? I think. He’s been telling us about his halo, but he wants to see one of you now. Not you.”
“There’s a lot that’s not right,” he says. “And a lot we’ve been through that I’m not getting into here. You said Cas needed insurance. Why? Where is he? And where are the forms?”
“I seriously did not sign up for this,” she says. And feels awful for thinking, even for a moment, that it would be easier if Cas had never turned up. “Cas, you have to come back to us. Whatever the story here, you have to come back. Val is scarily invested in you, and maybe you don’t get it, because as far as I can make out you don’t always seem to get what’s normal, but she only lets herself care about a few people. It’ll hurt her, really hurt her, if you up and die on us. And Beth?”
She had Heaven to help heal, a job Castiel couldn’t help with, not after being so directly involved in so much of the damage, but she didn’t want to explain it all to Sam now, to explain how the other angels Bela had managed to lead back to life were waiting for her. She didn’t want to explain how they’d met Gabriel and Anna and others, how they’d shown her how to create herself a body. Create one for Bela.
He mimes throwing a Ghostbusters trap across the room, but no-one’s looking. They’re all looking at Cas.
She’s so matter-of-fact as she says it that Dean finds himself checking to see how the others are taking it, just in case she isn’t really so calmly talking about being a force for chaos or whatever. Sam’s eyebrows are raised high enough they might be in danger of wandering right off his head, and Gertrude looks awestruck. And thrilled. The women who have taken in Cas are all some version of straight-faced and focused.
He’s not saying he’s free and clear. Hell, he knows he hasn’t always done right by Cas, any more than Cas has always been squeaky clean with them, but he needs these people to stop looking at him like he’s some abuser.
Shortly after, Dean hangs up, after telling Cas there’s no need to do any research. Dean’s sure there’s no real case for them. Castiel flicks on the light in the room and sets his phone down on the top of a dresser. Dean’s room. Dean’s clothing is closer in size to what Jimmy used to buy, to what Castiel found would stay on him when he was Steve.
He can see doubt on Dean’s face and has to grit his teeth. Dean’s seen Castiel fight in all manner of situations, and he believed Castiel would be okay out on his own even as a newly fallen angel, Graceless and ill-prepared, so Castiel can never understand why sometimes Dean acts as though Castiel is incapable of anything.
Somehow, Sam ended up driving with Bela and Hannah in their huge vehicle, leaving Cas and Dean to ride in the Impala.
The fingers tighten, but Dean makes no attempt to move Castiel. Instead, he presses closer, until his body’s almost against Castiel’s, and dips his head so he’s speaking right into Castiel’s ear. Castiel shivers as Dean passes into the space occupied by his wings.
“Yes,” Cas says, and doesn’t sound especially happy to be admitting it. He goes on in that earnest tone of voice that makes Dean want to grab him and shake him and press into him how much he matters, when Cas so often fails to factor in his own wellbeing for any decision. “But I’m much better than I was, and I think, perhaps, this creature is part of why I was so ill.”
She takes a moment to clamp down on a rush of memories, of all the times she soothed over a fight Greg started or anticipated how to channel his mood somewhere more positive. It got so even when there was no shouting, no snide remarks, and no hint of violence, she still spent her time tense and on alert.
Occupied with his own situation, it takes him a minute or so to notice that Beth hasn’t spoken, and that she’s got her back turned more towards Val than normal. There’s something hunched about her, and he finds it tugs at him.
Then again, Castiel looked to be one step from panic. Bela knew enough, from her painstaking research, to know that Dean had essentially trapped Castiel on that stone seat. She didn’t think Dean would leave the angel there for good, some living statue celebrating Dean’s power, but in theory it was something he could do. And if Dean Winchester, breaker of bonds and denier of destiny, was willing to lock his own lover in place like that, there was no telling what else he’d do. Maybe, in his demonic state, he would place sigils to demand Castiel’s obedience.
Castiel would rather that Castiel stopped. He’s having one of those phases where he wants to cease, wants to stop existing. Sam asked him once if Castiel felt suicidal, with Dean looking on from the doorway with shadowed eyes. He said no. No, that was over. Dean smiled when he said that, but it was pained. Castiel isn’t sure if Dean believed him, but it wasn’t a lie. Not exactly. He doesn’t want to be dead. He just doesn’t want to be. He reasons it’s not the same thing.
He sees Dean blink, and move, and a moment later he’s pulled down into a kiss. Dean is free with his affection, now he’s started showing it this way. Castiel lets himself sink, his body pressing onto Dean’s, and feels the ripples in his Grace that are nothing to do with pain.
Behind Dean, the demons clustered in a group, expressions rapt. As Castiel’s vision flickered between frequencies, he saw the smoke of them curl and coil in what had to be a mix of fear and excitement. Then again, if they had really been looking to change Dean back into a Knight, a full one this time, they already had to be desperate for a leader. Whichever brother won here, they’d be able to claim one. If not a Knight, if not Cain’s Heir, then a Boy King.
She heaved Cas up over her shoulders, apparently not caring that his blood soaked into her shirt. Dean and Bela followed her, far more slowly than Dean would have liked, and he spent the entire trip out of there watching Cas, watching for any sign of life. Whatever Hannah said, Cas didn’t look any more alive than he had a few minutes back. At least now his eyes were closed. Hannah must have done that.
“Maybe,” Dean says. He closes his eyes for a moment, and when he opens them he seems under control. “But I didn’t know how bad it was, and I didn’t take enough time to ask. So go through it again, and this time tell me when it got worse. Tell me what might have made your eyes go dark. Tell me anything I might need to know so we can work this out.”
Beth forces herself to pay attention. If something important is said, she should know about it. She is the one who met Cas first. In a way, she brought him into their lives. She has a hazy idea that makes her responsible for him.
These sheets are cool against his human skin, and they burn. He lies flat on his back, because that is how Riva left him, the material she slid over his shins adding an unfamiliar pressure. His knee is just bruised, but she thinks he’s splintered his shins. He hasn’t told her it’s almost nothing against the fractures already running through his real body.
Sam went deep with the demon blood, and he’s hosted two angels, been possessed by demons, been without his soul. He’s never changed species. Not like Dean has, becoming a demon, and certainly not like Cas has, becoming human.
Another sob swallows the end of his words. In the absence of further information, Castiel gathers himself and pulls his body closer to upright. He presses his right palm to the earth to brace himself, and winces. Bright pain spears him. Panting, he turns his head, taking in the outline of someone slumped against the base of a tree. His angelic eyes see nothing but fuzz.
Hannah’s look stopped him, just as he reached the point where one more inch would snap him free. Holding Castiel’s gaze just for a moment, she shook her head and mouthed a word in Enochian. Wait.
“So impatient,” Inanna says, and she doesn’t sound anywhere near serious enough for Dean’s tastes. “Are you this impatient in everything?”
Surprisingly, Val’s the first one to leave, tugging Beth with her, and Riva heads out just before Sam. Sam drops a hand to Dean’s shoulder, hoping that’s enough to show his support, and his hope that Dean really has heard what’s been said to him the last few days, that he’s really working on it.
“It can be difficult, being needed elsewhere, and not being able to be home,” he says, and this time he shares a look with Hannah.
And damn it. She isn’t ready. She only got Tanya down for her nap as early as she did so she’d have time to clean some of the mess, and there are still plates needing washing and a small army of toys hiding all over the place, not to mention that laundry she hasn’t finished with. Back when Steve visited her home regularly, Tanya wasn’t old enough to cause this chaos. Still, Steve being early can’t be altered now. He’s just going to have to put up with the mess.
“I… I’m an idiot, all right? And I should have been a better role-model. Hell, I should just be glad you aren’t drinking your pain, right?”
Right. Dean might be looking up pages and pages on what it means to be a kid and not to be treated like one, but he’s still got his barriers up. Baby steps.
He wonders if Sam picked up on what Val and Beth were implying. Probably not. Sam doesn’t seem to have noticed Dean slinking off to meet and greet in bathrooms and in alleys and sometimes in motel rooms, not when it’s been the male kind of company Dean’s been with.
The demon lurched forward as it was released, falling onto its hands and knees at Dean’s feet. A blade hit the ground by its right hand and it gasped, scrabbling for the thing and missing twice.
“You’ve been saying it every time you’ve looked for him,” Sam says, and he doesn’t even care that it sounds like the sort of line Dean might scoff at in a romance he’s pretending not to watch. “Listen, you don’t have to say it if you really feel you can’t. I’m just letting you know that I know. All right? And whatever the reason you find it so hard to say, don’t let worrying about my reaction be one of them. Because I already know. And I’m good with it.”
“You know, I like that. You knowing your place.” Dean pointed at Castiel and it was all too clear he’d like to be pointing with a knife. The wrist movement, the way he held his fingers, made one almost visible. “We’ll have to see how else you can show me you know it.”
She thinks she’s sitting opposite Cas’ abuser’s brother, and to her Sam’s a huge FBI agent, ex-military, who’s either ignored or missed Cas’ pain. And he’s in between her and the door.
He nods. His back’s straighter than normal and Val’s reminded of movies where a soldier’s being debriefed. They’ve still never talked about it, but Sam did mention serving.
“Means he’s being shifty. Mean he can’t give me the answer I want,” Dean says, as though he’s reading from a set of instructions.
If Sam thought hanging around a ruined building in the night was going to help at all, he’d have backed Dean and refused to leave. Cas is his brother, after all. Dean isn’t the only one with a claim there. But he’s thinking that, if Cas doesn’t come back, they might need Inanna on side. She might have refused to go herself so far, but Dean can be persuasive. They just need to keep her happy and then they’ve got her as back up.
“You know what I mean,” Dean says. And now he sounds as uncomfortable as Castiel. “I mean when I hit you, when I…when I almost fucking killed you. That has to be part of it.”
“And you think she’ll be up for something like this?” he asks, not quite sure if he means the knowledge of the supernatural or being asked to wade through several heavy books at short notice.
If he doesn’t take much more of the powder, if he spaces it out. He’s faced pain before. He should be able to do that.
He glances up to see Sam’s got hold of the man, and Dean’s sure he should care more when his brother frowns and speaks.
Sam’s never worked out how aware Dean is of his own feelings. Not on this one. God, even Bobby knew, Sam’s sure of it, but it’s like someone slapped a gag on the whole thing. They never speak of it, not really.
“I wasn’t sidelining him,” Dean says, a sullen edge sneaking in. “I thought I was supposed to be more…more caring. More concerned.”
The diamond pattern catches the light as she sets the glass down and even though she told her mom that cut crystal isn’t something she’d be likely to use much, she’s glad she has something a little bit more formal. This is a goddess, for crying out loud.
Val looks like she wants to laugh, but when when the Cas just stares levelly at her she blinks and turns to Dean.
In the living room, Beth looks around and finds no Cas. The striped blanket he’s taken to wearing almost like a cloak is draped over the back of the couch, but Cas himself isn’t there.
She wasted no time once she was back at the Bunker, pulling the ingredients together and readying the bronze bowl in which she’d assemble them. Sam practically vibrated with urgency and she had to tune him out.
“Not exactly,” Cas says, as though he thinks Dean’s being serious and isn’t the least bit bothered by it. He’s looking out over the park and Dean has no idea what he’s seeing. “I do need to get as close as possible to where I encountered the being. I just…I can’t remember where that was.”
Sam’s breath is heaving, his chest inflating and deflating enough he can feel it move, and he hasn’t wanted to hit out at something so much in months. Maybe years. He’s worked on his anger, but it’s always bubbling away underneath, less obvious than Dean’s but more deadly.
Still, his room has been echoing of late, the images in the waves refusing to stay steady, and he finds it impossible to say no.
Running a hand over her face, Nora sighs. She’s tired. It’s always there, of course, what with having a full time management role and with raising her daughter by herself, and her friends can be great, but it’s not the same as having someone to share the load. She thought getting this one job done would be more of a way to reach out to a friend she hasn’t seen in a while, and instead here she is faced with the knowledge that one of her few calm spots in life is rotten.
He sees Dean grimace, sees him pull back to sit on his heels like he’s thinking of pulling away entirely and leaving them all there. He sees the moment Dean gives in.
Still, he spent months thinking it was his lack of powers, his lack of usefulness, which left him unworthy of support in Dean’s eyes, and it turns out that such thoughts are hard to root out entirely.
There’s another ripple in the air and Cas staggers. Dean fires a shot before he can process anything more than Cas is in danger, and the soft, encompassing explosion of pressure that follows knocks Dean back.
Beth’s guests are work-friends, people who spend their lives thinking and writing and teaching. Castiel is jolted to hear Enochian slip from the lips of a woman at the far end of the table, but latching onto what she says tells him her accent is terrible. A little more listening suggests she specializes in areas of religion or history, in something which means having researched Enochian is a part of her experience.
Cas slides the nearest notepads over and goes right back to discussing the pages of the book with Gertrude.
“But you want to be,” she says. She doesn’t need to turn her human head to look at him. Her angelic eyes look in all directions, but enough of them are latched onto him. Not so many eyes as he used to have, of course, but Hannah is not much damaged by war and every one of her eyes still works. “You want to be a part of home.”
“My Grace used to keep my forms in lock. Enough to prevent overlap from being…from being destructive. Waves crashing together.”
“Yeah, no,” Dean says. “I think you do. You’re spaced out. I know that look. I’ve had that look. Anyone mind if I take Cas up to bed?”
“I’m sorry,” Dean says after a while. It sounds strained. “I didn’t mean to snap. I just… Fuck, this is hard.”
“Since always,” Sam says. He looks back at Dean, his eyes hard hazel, and leans over the table, bracing himself with his palms flat to the wood. “But right now I can’t let it get in the way of finding Cas. When it’s just yourself you’re drowning, I don’t like it, but I know you have your…you have reasons. All right?”
Dean’s starting to wonder if he’s lived the life he thinks he has. He’s also starting to really need to speak to Cas.
When dawn comes, Sam double checks the spell ingredients and runs through the order with Gertrude again. She seems almost giddy, with spots of color in her cheeks. Sam pats her on the back and leaves her adjusting the placement of a sprig of rosemary, heading upstairs to fetch Dean and Cas. And stops in the doorway.
“To be clear,” Val says, and for some reason there’s a challenge in it, “the window was several stories up.”
He feels keyed up, like he wants very much to hit something, and it’s taking everything in him to be calm and quiet and supportive the way Cas needs.
She chatters about many things on the way to Beth’s house, none of them heavy, none of them dangerous. She doesn’t mention his wounds again.
There’s warmth on his shoulders, the solid press of hands. It takes a moment to see Sam in front of him, and that should worry Castiel more than it does. But it doesn’t feel real. Nothing around him feels real. Another long moment passes before he realizes the ragged breathing is his.
“You didn’t get enough action already?” she tries next, and knows she’s prodding him, and that maybe it isn’t fair.
He can’t make himself go any further. What difference does his pain make? He broke so long ago he isn’t even sure when it happened and he long ago gave up on the idea of being whole again. Of being fixed. He’ll never again be what he was, and he’s spent enough time telling himself he’s okay with that, telling himself it doesn’t matter.
“Right,” Riva says. “Well, look, visiting hours are almost over. And I think Cas has had enough excitement for one day.”
His pain is more and more obvious when he visits, and she thinks he might be avoiding taking any drugs when he knows he’ll be visiting. She also thinks it keeps him twitchy and hurting, and there are times when he manages to get one of them to drive him back to his place earlier than planned. Val hates it. If he’s here then they can keep an eye on him. More and more, she doesn’t like taking him back to that run-down room to sit on his own and fester.
“Well, then I guess I’ll say it to you. Get the ball rolling, so to speak. Sam had better be right about this.”
“Who cares?” Bela shot back. “You got out. And don’t start with the self-pity over everything else. You fought off everything that came your way, no matter who it cost. We heard the rumors, even down in the dark reaches I was stuck in. A Knight of Hell. Crowley’s favourite. What I wouldn’t have given for that sort of connection.”
“A bunch of stuff,” Beth says. “Look, I’m sorry. I know you’re a grown man, and you’ve been in war for fuck’s sake, but I wanted…I needed to know…”
Ashley nods, apparently picking up on Sam’s feeling that Cas doesn’t need bothering by a stranger right now.
Hope people are okay with a short chapter to keep things going. I'm not doing so well at the motivation and focus right now.
“In any case, something about what I saw is making me think angel, and this feels connected.” Cas frowns. “It’s worth pursuing.”
Hammering on the door jars the lines of his sight, setting everything to wavering. That didn’t used to happen. He doesn’t think it did.
It takes Sam longer than it should do to work out he’s in Ashley’s way and he shuffles aside to let the kid past, trying to look as non-threatening as possible. There’s still something hunched and folded about the boy that makes Sam think this one won’t be going the Hunter route. He looks more like he’ll go with trying to forget he ever came up against the supernatural.
“Doesn’t matter,” Val says. “If you don’t want to talk to him, someone else can. But whatever I thought when you first turned up, I can see how it is with you two. Knowing you’re trying to get it might help more than someone he’s not known as long trying.”
At Cas’ nod, Dean pulled the laces undone and urged Cas to lift his foot. Maybe he should have had Cas sit down first, but when Cas rested a hand lightly on Dean’s head, maybe for balance, Dean found it hard to regret doing it this way. Especially when Cas stroked across Dean’s hair, causing a ripple of tinging sensation over Dean’s scalp.
“I want to read those books,” Castiel says. He thinks there’s some of the powder, possibly, under the mattress. Not a good hiding place, but there’s a decent chance Beth hasn’t gone looking since Castiel last stayed here. He needs Sam and Beth out of the room before he can take it, though, and then he’ll be able to focus. “Just, help me up.”
“About letting you know you’re cared for,” Dean says. He clears his throat. “That…you’re loved. Sam says it’ll help to remind you. In case you didn’t know. Sounds kinda mushy to me, but Sam’s been doing this reading, and… Yeah. Anyway. So, there’s that.”
“It’s over,” Sam says, reassuring and solid as he sits on the settee in the small house. “You’re safe.”
But damn it, this is Cas. She knows herself well enough to get once she takes someone under her wing she gets a bit guard-dog about them, and knowing Cas is a celestial being doesn’t change the way she feels she should stab anyone in the face who even looks like the might be threatening him.
He’s sitting out in the dark and he isn’t sure why, or why he hurts. Trailing sticky fingers down his chest, he feels his wings curl around him, his brow furrow. There was something…some shape. No. He can’t hold onto the thought.
What’s a little longer, if it keeps everyone feeling so much happier than they have been? This is something Castiel can do for them. It is.
Sam’s staring at her, his lips pressed together and his jaw clenched. He gives every indicated he’d like to lift her out of the way and just walk in to that room.
Dean and Val say his name as the same time, but it’s the hitch in Beth’s breathing that catches him, and he’s out of his seat and next to her before he’s processed he can’t do much with coffee in his hands.
Dean snaps the pencil he’s holding in half without even realizing and leaves both pieces on the floor when he leaves.
“So, you got any idea what you’re trying to pull up from storage?” Dean asks as he sets about making more coffee. “Ballpark?”
Dean takes the pastry from Sam and stuffs in right into his mouth, chewing in a way that tells Sam Cas must truly love his brother, because no-one with less that total dedication would be up for a partner with those eating habits.
The wounds are healing more slowly than they should be, and Riva’s more or less begged him to go into the hospital, to at least make an appointment to see someone. Aidan always redirects the conversation. Val’s almost certain he thinks they haven’t noticed.
“How trapped are you?” she asked, once she’d swept the room, checking as well as she could for anything beyond the obvious level of observation.
Sam stops when he sees Dean leaning on the bed. He throws his arm out when he sees Dean’s hand in Cas’.
Sam calls Dean from outside the hospital, braced for anger. For something. He gets a dull, leaden voice, flattened and distant, and feels his hackles rise.
“But you thought, what, his math teacher would know more? Because of that deep and abiding bond we lecturers have with…hundreds of students at once? I don’t sit around braiding their hair, Agent.”
“Really? Because I heard he defied Heaven on your say so. I heard he took on the souls of Purgatory so you could stay with your girlfriend and play at being suburban. I heard he gave up an army, that he almost let borrowed Grace burn him through, that he helped to remove the Mark, even when it meant having a spell almost tear him apart, all for you. Is any of that untrue?”
“Please,” he said. “Please, if anyone is listening, anyone at all, you’ve gotta come help Cas. He’s your brother, damn it. And he’s fucked up, but only because your whole species is fucked up. Come on. He’s saved you. More than once. Don’t let him die like this just because you’re pissed he chose us over you. He shouldn’t have had to chose, and you know it. And…and just…please. Please help him.”
Castiel frowns at the bowl. His thoughts are sluggish, and piecing together a set of words to send into the world is harder than it should be. Still, he manages it.
Dean nods, and he sees Sam move to the edge of his seat, body language screaming that he’s thinking of intervening.
So Sam doesn’t worry and Sam doesn’t mourn. Sam plans. Because there’s no way his brothers are going to lose each other, not when he’s finally seen them start to get their shit together.
She has to tamp down on a slithering feeling in her gut. She almost wants to tell Riva to shut up, to stow whatever ideas she has and just leave it, but she doesn’t. Hiding from things doesn’t help.
It’s a mass of void space, branching and splitting and shifting. It doesn’t writhe, exactly. It more…flows. As Castiel latches onto it’s shape, he sees one limb that looks very much like an angelic tentacle merge with something that looks almost like a wing, the two limbs melting into each other and becoming an arc scattered with pinpricks of dark-light. Castiel feels his own limbs twitch.
Beth sees the car pull up, but only after she hears it. Dean’s got to be laying down rubber driving like that. She sees the head of dark hair leaning against the window of the back seat.
“Awesome,” she says. “Because the last thing we need is them thinking they should take you on as a charity case. So, what do you think about tomato soup? Or are you more or a potato and leak kind of guy?”
He sees Sam smile, too, and considers telling him what he can do with that expression, but playing this off as no big deal is probably the better idea.
Next to him, Cas made an unhappy noise, and Dean resisted the impulse to reach out and soothe the angel. He’d done as much soothing as he could overnight, showing Cas exactly how good Dean’s mouth could be just in case something went wrong and that was the last chance he got.
“It should be just across the street,” she said. “Does anyone need a rest break before we get to it? You can’t decide you want to go later.”
Whether Dean noticed that or he was just making one of those leaps of intuition that neither Sam nor Castiel could manage, there was certainty in his next words.
The fight slips out of Sam, leaving him looking exhausted enough to fall over. He runs a hand over his face, huffing out a breath that sounds painful.
“He did survive that jump,” Riva says, as though Val’s question is serious. “That’s not something he should have been able to do. And you know it. And it’s not like it’s the only weird thing.”
“Apart from it being pleasant to read my own language again, there’s nothing here to help us with the current situation,” Castiel says, sitting back and rubbing a hand over his face. He lifts one shoulder and lets it drop, ignoring the slice of pain that sends down his neck and back. “There are some comments on keeping their Grace and true form aligned in the vessel I could maybe look into, but I’m in here on my own. It’s different.”
“And how do we get him to let us help?” Dean asks. “I mean really help. Because Cas has this habit of going off on his own with crazy schemes to fix everything that pretty much always end up breaking him more.”
“Who’s is that?” Dean asked, because Cas had told him he wouldn’t take another angel’s Grace again, not even when Dean had tried to get out the words to say how much it would hurt him if Cas refused out of some morals and died for it.
Okay, it’s alluring. Just because Dean’s with Cas now, and just because he isn’t stupid enough to get it on with something like Inanna anyway, doesn’t mean he’s lost the ability to appreciate beauty when he sees it.
Dean and Val stay watching from the table, tense and poised to step in, Castiel is sure, as Beth sobs in his arms. He doubts she can feel the ruin of his wings about her, but he can’t bring himself to uncurl them. Two pairs surround her, the other pair flared up so he can keep up a watch on the room.
“Only what you want to, Cas,” Dean said, sauntering closer and leaning forward, a hand on either one of Castiel’s wrists. “You’ve tried your hand at leading minions. What do you think I should do to dig out the dissenters? Go on. You’ve got to have some ideas.”
“Are you all right?” he asks, because whoever it is, they’re hurting. He’s hurting, too, more injuries added to the tally already carved into his body, but he’s a soldier and his wounds are hardly the first.
She’d expected to find Dean beside her when she lifted the lid on the crate, but Castiel appeared instead, placing one surprisingly graceful hand on the edge of the box and leaning in. He was focused, intent. She could well believe he’d commanded battalions, that he’d more than once commanded large portions of the Host. She had a little more trouble believing he’d commanded Hannah.
The shape of what she’s telling him sinks further, descending after its shadow, and he forces his wings to still, his back stiffening as he feels their weight. He must be calm. Through the fog in his mind and the heavy smoke in his limbs, he must be calm. This isn’t important. It’s just…just soup, and sitting on a chair across from a woman who doesn’t trust him. It really isn’t so very much to give up.
“I held his hand and my headache went away.” Riva says it in a near-mumble, mouth still partly full, looking down at her bowl.
Riva pushes out the chair next to her and pats it, waiting until Cas is settled with the book in front of him to lean into his space and point.
His eyes drift back to the other lights, the shifting lights on the TV screen. They form stories, lives that Castiel can sink into. Thousands of them. They almost swallow him, and he welcomes it.
“You want to talk about it?” Beth asks, because sometimes Val needs prompting to get to the talking rather than the ranting.
But that’s not right. He shut it down. He shut it all down. He lost the colors, and he shut out the light, the noise, the voices.
She lets him help her up, her eyes darting from him to the spaces around him and back. He doesn’t comment on it. He can feel his wings flared out around him, still battle-ready, and feels regret that he can’t see as well as he would like. The outlines behind him show the attacker hasn’t made it far. He’s huddled behind a dumpster further up the street.
This time, Dean doesn’t try to take the laptop from Sam when he fetches it and clicks back to one of the pages on neglect.
Dean claimed the bedroom at the back of the house, throwing his bag down and rifling through it for a change of clothes. Bela had refused to stay in a motel, insisting it would be bad for her skin. Hannah had nodded as though that made sense, and Sam had laughed. Cas had been busy throwing worried looks at the bags Bela had brought from the lock-up.
He doesn’t quite follow how he ends up in the spare room, Dean by his side. Val’s there, too, which seems…wrong and right. Such contradictions follow his life since he met Dean. It’s probably not worth worrying about. And it is so pleasant to see the greens and golds of the pair of them. He could watch them for hours.
In the end, it turns out Jake is just back from his latest trip, and he arrives thirty minutes later with his hair spiked less carefully than usual and his eyes looking tired. He takes one look at Steve and claps him on the shoulder, grinning.
“It’s not a case of fixing,” she says at last. “That idea of needing fixing? That was something he used to throw at me, back when he’d get tired of me flinching, like he wasn’t most of why I did. And that was one of the hardest things, learning that I wasn’t broken. Not like a vase is when you drop it, or a machine is when it stops working. I’m not a thing and healing isn’t always something that ends.”
“I put the last of the books on the end of the table,” Sam says from behind Dean, just as Dean reaches for the coffee. Sam doesn’t show any sign that he notices Dean jump, spilling some of the liquid over the nearest book. “Don’t know they’ll be any good, but I can go through any you had trouble translating. You just need to tell me which ones they are.”
“Figure you could do with the energy,” Riva says, straight-faced. “Don’t get the feeling you slept much.”
“And what’s Cas saying to him?” Beth asks. When Val shoots a look at her, a puzzled expression on her face, Beth waves her hand. “You’ve got to have noticed he’s trying, Val. Dean, I mean. And maybe Cas can share things with him he can’t say to us. No. Don’t look at me like that. They’ve known each other for years.”
Sam arrives with a box of pastries and another stack of books, and Riva liberates both when he’s still in the hallway.
He’s only had the one morning after experience before, and he isn’t sure if kissing and falling asleep on someone counts as his second. Besides, the situation with April hasn’t exactly left him with a good map for these things.
Sam’s phone buzzes as he reaches for another book. The Bunker records they have on his tablet are far from complete, but he has found mention of a few things he can follow and he pulled every book on angels he could find weeks ago, hauling them around in the Impala on hunts. Just in case.
The flannel shirts are warm. Warmer than he needs when he’ll be pulling the blanket back over himself soon enough.
It was mostly to keep Rit Zien away, in any case, and with his wings back and with Dean and Sam around, they can deal with one, if needs be.
He moved, pulling the dagger back and throwing his arms out, spinning in a slow circle as the demons around him nodded and agreed. It wouldn’t take too long to destroy them all, but Hell was huge and Dean needed to know he’d got rid of the ones who’d really opposed him.
“You have faith,” Dean says, voice flat. He part turns and pulls a face at Sam. It’s one Castiel has seen more than once when Dean is displeased with something he’s said. “Well, ain’t that nice, Sammy? She has ‘faith’. Because when has that ever screwed us over?”
“Dean, just don’t. Please,” Sam says, but he stays on the bed. He doesn’t want Dean to feel crowded. “Leave the beer alone and come talk to me.”
It takes a minute for Val’s figure to waver into being behind the glass, and Beth looks a question at her once the door’s open.
He stands, stares critically at his work for a moment, and speaks one final word. It crackles in the air. The heat-tingle that flashes through the room is like lightning, but without the blaze, and the sucking silence that follows is something Dean’s felt in thunderstorms when he’s been out somewhere with a wide plain.
He looks bashful as he answers, as though talking about his angelic nature is akin to walking about naked, and he keeps glancing between them.
“I’ll go,” he says, and makes no move to do so. One of his wings sags against the cushions, the telescopic eye pressing against the thick grain of a yellowed thread.
“How’d you miss it?” Dean asks, because Sam can absorb his words, can shout back. Can tell Dean it’s his fault for not taking good enough care of Cas.
“Not as far as I can tell,” Beth says. “I can’t find any mention of him anywhere in academic circles, either, but… Well.”
Sam thought about mentioning the problems they had, the demons, and Bela turning up, and Hannah returning from the dead. Not to mention that comment about Bela leading others back from wherever Hannah had been. But the sky was full of stars, and all three of them were safe and healthy, and Dean looked happier than he had in years.
“Yeah, he was feeding from people’s souls. Keeping them tied down and taking a bit at a time. Kinda creepy.”
“I don’t know why,” Castiel tells them, tells Dean, “but I didn’t get that sense from it. And looking back, I’m not sure I felt it the first time. The first time I remember, anyway. It was more…it was…”
“Don’t worry,” Dean says. “I’ve met Gods. They’re never as impressive as you think. But if it makes you feel better, Sammy here will run out for some flowers and fruit or something. Maybe a gift basket.”
“Right. Right,” Dean says. Be supportive. He told himself he was going to be supportive. “So, er, it’s in there now or what?”
He tried not to let it bother him that neither Dean nor Sam had argued Castiel would be unsuited to the role, if Dean allowed it.
He sounds nervous as he says it, like he expects Dean to do something awful to him at any threat of exposure, but Dean just nods and pats Ashley again.
But Sam knew someone’s best didn’t always mean squat, not when the stakes were high. Hell, sometimes even when it was meant to be a cake-walk. There was every chance not everyone would make it back. Not alive.
“You should just stay away from it,” he says. “Soon as I feel up to it, I’m gonna ring my mom. Get her to come pick me up. And I ain’t ever coming back near this place. Not ever.”
Which is how Beth and Val end up out in the garden as the evening falls, and Dean goes up to have yet another go at talking to Cas. Maybe, Sam thinks, this will be the time there’ll be a lasting breakthrough. It’s a lot easier to hunt monsters than to hunt emotional issues. Monsters, once stabbed, tend to stay dead. The emotional stuff just keeps coming back. He sits with Riva and Gertrude, sipping coffee and making small-talk, and tries really hard to believe two of the most stubborn, battered, loving people he knows can actually break through some of their mental blocks and come out of this together.
He follows Dean and Sam and his own breath up the road and off onto a meandering trail. Branches arch overhead, casting crooked bars across the pale sky, and he tells himself he’s not caged in. They aren’t bars. And he can’t use his ragged wings for flying in any case. Still, they shift and flex at his back, opening as far and as high as they can. It isn’t far enough. Even this much brings fresh bursts of pain to the breaks and tears. His view of the area increases as his wing-eyes gain height, letting him see over the horizon as his human eyes see it.
Hearing her say it shouldn’t hurt, not like it did. It wasn’t as though Dean was stupid. He still wanted to spit in her face.
It’s empty, somehow, in the room. Cas is still there, Riva doing something to check on him that Val isn’t paying attention to. The bed’s still there, obviously, and the other furniture, and the other patients behind the curtains, but they’ve been distant to Val this whole time. Whoever they are, they’re asleep or ignoring what’s going on in Cas’ little bubble of the ward. Cas’ bed is the one near the door, anyway, and it’s easy to pretend he’s in a room by himself. Still, it’s like a packed room is suddenly echoing.
“Do you really think Sam’s telling the truth?” Val asks, after a stretch of silence filled only with the scrape of forks against bowls.
The effect was more immediate this time. Dean’s skin flooded with marks, sigils inking themselves into being in an instant. Dean drew to a juddering halt, his eyes wide and his lips parted.
“You got any more details?” Dean asks, and glances round the table. No-one is looking at him like he went too far, or was too snappy with that. “Er, like, so we know which God?”
Cas’ new friend has insisted on meeting somewhere public, with noise and people and security cameras. Dean hates that she feels he’s such a threat, but it’s not like it’s the first time someone’s seen him that way. Hurts more that it’s someone Cas knows.
What does he need? He needs his wings back, properly. He needs his sword. He needs to find a way to calm the pieces of himself and stitch what he can back together. But she can’t help with any of that. She’s human. Even Dean and Sam can’t help him with this.
Beth leans forward, scanning from Cas’ hand up to his face, where his eyes are moving. She can see it even though they’re closed, and she wants to reach out and calm him, somehow, but she doesn’t know what she should do. She doesn’t want knowing what he is to change the way she treats him, but it does.
“We found this,” Sam says, apparently deciding they aren’t going to get Cas alone easily. “At the park. Figured this might be what you’d lost.”
“The truth,” Sam says. “Dean, at this point I think the only one who doesn’t know how you feel about Cas is Cas.”
When he reaches it, he stands and studies it, taking in the smooth lines, the green paint. He wishes it were any color other than green.
The shape and texture of the voice, the warm honey-gold and green of it, can’t be mistaken. It takes a moment to find the thread of the words.
No. Her voice doesn’t bring pain. The pain is inside him, outside him. It is him. It’s the wavelengths which should let him connect with the Host.
“How do we get it to go back?” Sam asks, speaking for the first time. He sounds more respectful than Dean, but there’s a sense he’s speaking more to a colleague than to a god.
He needs to know what Cas has said to her to get this kind of response. He needs to know how he’s screwed up this time.
“The last time I felt this much pain and stayed in one place, a Rit Zien found me and tried to put me to a merciful death,” Castiel tells him, because he can never be sure whether Dean will have told Sam details about a case which only concern Castiel. “On the way, it killed others. Humans.”
As Dean starts, his eyes widening and his jaw clenching, and Sam shifts in a way that shows he’s none too happy to hear that statement, Castiel frowns.
The notepads are covered, but there doesn’t look to be any particular thread being followed. Still in random research mode. Right.
“Anything you can tell us might help,” Cas says. He glances at Beth and shifts on his feet. “Would…would you care for some refreshment while we talk?”
“Right,” he says. “Well. Let us know if we can help. I, er, there might be a couple more which looked similar. Similar age and writing.”
All right, so she’s said that second part, but in some ways it’s what lets her believe the first bit. Something smaller, less bizarre, is easier to believe.
Because that had been about the only time he’d felt warm, when Sam had hugged him, when Dean had hugged him, after they’d found him in April’s apartment, once the Reaper who’d claimed her had burned out. Once Dean had tricked her into healing Castiel. And again, a greater shock by far, when Dean had pulled him into a hug the morning after the incident at Nora’s. Just before Dean had left, and Castiel had felt the chill sink right back into his bones. Such things mattered, when you were human.
People cross in between the car and Dean, blocking his view of the man’s face, but that hair, that build, that godawful sense of style, and the red car…
“I don’t know what’s wrong with me,” Cas says. “I don’t know if I can do what Dean wants. Maybe I’m too broken. But I don’t think I can go with you. I’m sorry. I know Dean wants me to go back, but I can’t be any use to you now.”
“You’re all cut up and you look miserable. So. No more vanishing act, all right? And don’t worry about the bill. We’ll figure something out.”
Frustration, maybe anger, flashes across Sam’s face, and Riva has to make herself stand her ground. She’s still between Cas’ room and this giant of a man, and she intends to stay there.
“Yeah, well, I’ve met one of those,” Dean says. “Wasn’t exactly fixing people up. More blowing them up.”
“Not always. Sometimes, they keep secrets from each other. The…cases, they can make things difficult.”
Castiel wakes slowly. Sleep is still strange to him, even after being, essentially, human for those months. He was still an angel, under it all, and angels don’t sleep. The idea of becoming void, of ceasing to have purpose and drive and deliberation, was alien to him, no matter how much his borrowed body needed it.
“How’s Cas?” Riva asks next, apparently deciding it isn’t all that important that her sister is now laughing with the man they all thought was the enemy not all that long ago.
“Right. Okay.” She wonders how he’s been getting food. There are no signs of takeaway containers. “Well, I brought food. Are you hungry?”
She’s just come back from wading through a pile of paperwork, meaning to check on Cas before she suggests she takes her own turn to go home and grab a change of clothes, and she sees a little girl walk right out of Cas’ room.
Almost as quickly, he slips from Castiel’s mind. He’s sitting in an open space, under a tree. He knows that. He knows, too, that he hurts. Perhaps he’s imagined a creature attacking. It wouldn’t be the first time he’s thought he’s seen something and been left wondering. Just the day before, he could have sworn he saw Dean, but that is a foolish thought. Dean would not be in the alley outside Castiel’s room. Dean is not even in this State.
It’s a theory, at least. He’s let Val check his injuries, but she doesn’t have Riva’s knowledge-base and he point blank refuses to go to the hospital, even though it’s clear he needs some help. To be honest, Val’s biggest fear the last couple of nights has been she’ll wake up to find he’s died. She’s left her bed to stick her head into his room and check. A few times.
The low, simmering heat in his voice was part warning, part invitation, and Castiel wondered if that, too, was a kind of weapon.
He floats. His vessel is…elsewhere. Disconnected. All that exists are the waves and the other waves, the ones which are him. Even his wings are gone, their heavy drag lifted. He missed them, back when he was Steve, and then when he had Theo’s Grace, and Adina’s. Not his. His never used to hurt.
It’s not like he’s got very far with her. She’s still spitting out threats she can have no way of carrying out, glowering at Sam like he’s…well, like he’s still being worn by the Devil, and has her hackles up so far over Dean that Sam can’t, just can’t, let her see his brother folded over at Cas’ bedside like this.
“You doing okay?” he asks Cas, more than once, and each time Cas nods, say’s he’s fine. Each time, Dean pretends to believe him. He manages not to snap or scold.
With no real sense she’s directing her own body, Beth trails after him, up the path and up the steps and into the house, where Dean’s laid Val on the settee and Riva’s leaning over her.
As thought he’d been suffering from a cold or a hang-over, and hadn’t almost been dead. Then again, given what Dean had learned about Heaven and it’s methods over the years, maybe this didn’t seem so much worse than a dressing down.
On the other side of the door a man stands with his fist raised, ready to knock again. Castiel watches him, watches the outlines of amber and blue, and considers ignoring him. But no. The man will only knock again, and if he is a threat there is even less chance he will go away.
He pulls his wings in and walks with his head down, setting his jaw against the jarring of each step. He isn’t sure how long splintered shins take to heal. He isn’t used to needing time to heal.
The door creaks as he presses down on the handle, creaks and doesn’t move. Ah. Of course. He’s still leaning his forehead against it. He needs to shift, to move his weight back and support himself entirely on his human legs. If he doesn’t, he can’t leave his room to find a way to be less human. He thinks there’s some irony in that, or some message, but he can’t work out what, or if there’s no meaning at all.
“Is it…could it be a reaction to Sam visiting?” And she asks that slowly. “I know I had some weird reactions to seeing Greg.”
Beth catches Val’s eye, and they must thinking something similar. There’s a softness in Dean’s voice that Beth certainly hadn’t expected.
The bag is still under the bed, still packed. After that first night, when Dean fell asleep leaning against Castiel, he pushed the bag deep under the bed and left it there. He didn’t give any thought to why it stayed packed.
That had to be a come-on. Yeah, the first clue was really more the kiss, and one of Cas’ hands had trailed its way down to Dean’s ass, but somehow the comment at the end there was still a surprise.
Aidan opens the door for her, but she isn’t entirely sure he sees her. His eyes are restless, and he peers into the corridor behind her as though checking for enemies. She isn’t sure why he checks above her as well.
“What?” Dean asks, leaning in. He still can’t make out any words. “Is it Cas? What’s happened? What’s wrong with Cas?”
He thinks. This answer feels like it should be important, like it should matter. He finds, after some thought, that it doesn’t.
Dean jolts, shooting a startled look his way, his mouth turned down. Val responds only a split-second later, frowning as she turns to him. Beth stops moving.
A man in a suit stands in the doorway, a part-smile on his face. He’s tall. That’s the first thing that strikes her. And he’s fucking gorgeous. That’s the second thing. She dislikes him on sight.
“And what happened when you got here?” Riva asks, putting that aside for now. One mystery at a time. Perhaps she’ll find one she can deal with.
“Over you, Dean,” Sam says. “Cas watched over you. Not us. Sure, he’s saved me, too. Hell, he took Lucifer out of my mind. But that whole watching over thing? That was between the two of you.”
It takes Dean a second to catch on, the weird burger he’s eating halfway to his mouth as his brow crinkles.
There’s something in the air he can’t make out, some tension, and then Beth makes a sound that could mean anything and makes her way past him.
“Yeah. We’re really here for the case. But you better believe I mean it about being here sooner if we knew.” His gaze goes back to Val’s friend like it’s being drawn. “Cas-”
Dean glances at the sandwich and visibly gives up on it, throwing it back on the plate and crossing his arms. He doesn’t say anything for a few moments, and thankfully no-one asks what a Rit Zien is. Finally, Dean nods.
Castiel frowned, his eyes narrowing. It was startling. Bela actually wanted to take a step back. She didn’t.
“You saying you were in pain and didn’t tell us, Cas?” Dean asks, tone half-way between disapproval and worry.
Val sends Riva and Beth on that beer run, asks Gertrude to go pick up some ingredients she’s missing, and sets Sam to chopping vegetables while she multi-tasks getting out the spices she needs and worrying about what’s about to happen in the dining room.
Dean lets Cas move to stand next to Inanna. His hand twitches to reach out and grab the guy, to stop him and remind him to be careful at least, but he stills himself. He catches Sam’s look and pretends he doesn’t.
Dean’s usual answer queues up on his tongue. He doesn’t do love. But she already thinks Dean’s been involved with Cas, and somehow he hasn’t corrected her. No sense in throwing off Cas’ whole story, if these people are at least feeding and housing him for now. Not until Dean knows more about what’s going on.
“You get there are long term effects when you take ketamine?” Riva says, sounding more like Val than she normally does with that frustration in her voice.
Castiel must nod, or else Dean only asked out of formality, which seems very unlike Dean, because the door creaks all the way open and Dean is right there, crouching in front of Castiel, peering up at him as he sways on the edge of the bed.
“This isn’t helping,” Riva says, slipping into the tone she has to use with difficult patients. “If you two want to fight it out, do it someplace else.”
He doesn’t answer. He doesn’t have an answer. How could he know? Time slipped strangely when Sam and Dean were away, but that might not be what Sam means. There were times, before this, when he found stepping down from a fight to be a struggle, when he couldn’t be sure how long a battle had taken. He can’t think of another time when this exact situation has arisen, however.
If Cas notices the note of hesitation in Dean’s voice, he likely thinks it’s because Dean still doesn’t trust Val and the others. Sam’s pretty sure it’s Dean steeling himself for Cas to decide Sam and Dean aren’t needed now, that he’s going to stay here in a new life. A life without Dean.
“Oh, come on. It won’t be that bad,” Val says. Her energy is rising, her body almost vibrating. Even with his human eyes, Castiel sees the waves of apple green and amber leaking from her skin. “Tell you what, we’ll not tell her, all right? Let her think what she wants. She’ll freak. It’ll teach her to call me-”
She feels the tension in Val and she feels the moment her sister slumps, guilt flashing across her face.
It occurs to him that Dean has never seen his wings. Not really. Neither of them have. Sam could have done, perhaps, when he was host to Gadreel, but Castiel didn’t have his wings for much of that time and Gadreel was shutting down Sam’s knowledge. And Dean, when he was a demon, may have seen them. He’s never said. And Castiel has never dared to ask.
A fleeting impression of horns and limbs, of something huge and slinking and inhuman, smudges across her mind, but she can’t bring it into focus.
Sam mentions looking for the red car or for reports that might be Cas a few times, and Dean finds the piles of books on the library table moved around, but he doesn’t get into a heavy conversation with Dean about it. Dean does his own research, returning to some books over and over in the hopes they’ll make sense, tracking down other books that might help him translate what he needs to. He can’t find whatever will act as a Rosetta stone for him with some of them.
Dean’s hesitation leaves a space for Castiel to fill in. If Sam thinks indulging in the trimmings of this one version of a winter festival will heal Castiel, then he is perhaps growing frustrated with how slow Casitel is to be fixed.
Sam doesn’t mourn the loss of that lightness he saw in his brother. He doesn’t. He walks next to Cas all the way back to the park, and through it to the car, and he watches Dean’s expression as Cas says he’ll ride with Beth on the way back. Dean and Sam get Val in the back of the Impala instead, as though there’s some rule about how many people have to be in each car.
Nora gets Tanya into the dress and boots and agrees they can have a drink in a minute before turning back to her conversation with Hannah. Winchester. It’s strange to have a last name to fit with the man she met. For all this time, he’s just been ‘Dean’.
Sam has some inkling, but he’s also got no intention of being in the middle of a Dean and Cas therapy session for life. He’ll talk about it if Dean needs him to, but this feels more like something Dean should talk about with Cas. Still, a pointer might not hurt.
“You better,” Dean says, at last, his voice a rasp. “I didn’t pull my head out of my ass so you could get yours trapped in another Purgatory.”
And this is something that makes a kind of sense. A report. Dean is asking for a status report. Castiel feels his spine straighten, just a bit, and his focus sharpens. He can’t present his wings correctly, but Dean isn’t a Seraph and wouldn’t be able to see that anyway. It still grates.
And the goddess smiles, warmer this time, and nods, and reaches out. This time, Castiel extends his wings before the power sparks, and he dives into the current with every eye turned toward his destination.
“I want us to work,” Dean says, his words thick and heavy. “I don’t wanna screw this up. To screw you up. Worse, I mean. I don’t know how to fix what I already did.”
Riva spreads the books out across the table and stares at them. Cas is as taken care of as he can be for the moment, Ashley’s still asleep in the tiny spare room, and Dean’s pacing in the living room. He didn’t take long picking up the books, but it was long enough to wonder whether she was up to this. And to decide she had to be. She would be.
Dean’s quiet again. Sam starts to think he’s pushed it too far, or from the wrong angle, but his brother finally nods.
Steve’s been out here before, but she can’t quite get straight in her head how much of a guest he is now. He stayed in her house, more than once, and they were at the point she was going to ask him if he wanted to rent her spare room, but now it’s months and months since she’s seen him, or heard from him. And Hannah hasn’t ever been here.
Dean tries not to mind that Cas walks out with Sam and Beth on either side of him, and tells himself Cas will come round. Dean was being supportive, making sure that thing didn’t attack Cas again. And Cas will see that. He will.
“Hey, Dean,” Sam said. “Why don’t you take Cas off to get some clean clothes. We’ll straighten up in here.”
“You…” Sam isn’t sure how to finish the sentence. “Wait here. I’ll go play Fed for those women, see if Cas does know anything about the case. And I’ll talk to him.”
If Dean thought force would get him better answers, he’d have that guy across the desk already. Instead, he folds his fingers into fists, an origami which brings no peace, and waits for Sam to move through every question he can try and get the key to the room Cas stayed in.
“Cas stays with me,” Dean said. “We can’t come up with another plan, we can go with me suiting up and taking them out, but Hell is not becoming our family business.”
“What are you hoping for, Sammy?” Dean asks, almost hiding how forced his levity is. “You want to go searching in the forest for elves?”
But Castiel had been letting himself think about a future where Dean might ask him to stay in the Bunker. He’d let himself wonder what it would be like to build a life together properly. Throwing that away to rule in Hell, a place he’d spent more than enough time already, wasn’t something he could think about with ease.
“Yeah, but with fewer black holes,” Val says, and her lips are definitely twitching into something like a smile.
Another sound, even closer. She flinches, pulling in on herself, still pressing her right hand into her left arm as she tries to dig into the concrete beneath her with her toes, to push herself further back against the bit of wall behind her. If it finds her, she has no chance.
And that’s said slowly, a searching out of something he hasn’t previously realised. Whatever his life was like before, it must have contained a lot of urgency and drive. At the very least, it’s left him struggling with a basic concept like pacing himself.
Cas scrunches his nose, looking up and slightly to the side, and Sam knows that look. It’s the one that means Cas is trying to work out how to explain something to them. The hurt in Sam’s chest pulses and warms, easing into something altogether better.
The sunlight streaming through the window hits Beth’s hair just right, making it glow, and Val’s distracted by thinking how that hair looked feathered over the pillow this morning. She kept herself tucked safely over on her own side of the bed, but admiring a friend’s hair has to be all right.
She doesn’t mention a lack of worshiping, and maybe she has some idea Castiel could be a powerful follower for her. Just his faith in her would be a boon to a goddess who can’t have the same level of devotion as she used to have. He doesn’t think that’s it, though. Ereshkigal is far from usual, for a god. There’s power, but not the same sense she’s looking for an edge. She really does seem to be giving him a choice.
“I didn’t mean that to sound weird. It’s just, you’ve got no contact information. Well, no information at all.” She pauses again, worry flowing round her, marring the green with its sickly undertone. “We’ve got you down as a John Doe.”
And it’s not like there’s anything between Cas and him, anyway. Cas doesn’t even think about that stuff, not unless someone leads him that way.
She’s through the doorway before the thought hits her, that she’s tearing without a plan or back-up into an abandoned space, following a man who’s been missing and who’s acting weird.
“That is not the only way I get you off,” she said. “And I’m not sure how even my fingers can remove this iron. That’s a sigil I’m amazed these grunt-demons even managed to etch, let alone keep under control.”
“You said you locked his Grace in?” he asked. “So, he’s sleeping or something? Like, a medically induced coma?”
It will take some thought, but with Dean asleep next to him, and with both of the Winchesters having declared their affection for him, he finds he can let his wings settle at last. The feeling that he must watch out for danger recedes, enough that he can cope without losing himself in the lives of TV people.
“What do you want me to say, Sammy?” Dean asks, but he’s staring out of the window at the back as he says it.
“Maybe not. But you did involve him in your plans. You did rely on him for certain things, at certain times. And Bela has a reason to help. She has Hannah.”
They’ve photographed that, too, but it’s mostly washed away, leaving a few marks most people wouldn’t look twice at. This is where Cas was found. They got that much from the police report, along with a few choice phrases from one of the detectives on what should be done to people who stalk and attack their exes.
Hannah nodded, not looking overly concerned about that. Some bit of tension he’d been denying he felt went out of Dean.
“We have to assume they will,” Riva says, “and we have to think about how we’re going to handle it. I mean, come on. Angel. How do I treat him? Do you think he knows he’s an angel? Is this some sort of falling from Heaven and forgetting thing?”
They both fall silent. Castiel is finding it harder to keep an eye on them. His wing aches. Still, it’s wiser to know what they’re saying, to know where they are. He isn’t safe in his room here, and there’s no TV in this room, nothing to distract him. In theory, he could latch onto the correct waves with no screen to stare at, but the trick seems beyond him with nothing to tell his human eyes to look at. It must be some part of his vessel’s brain, some reluctance to stare at nothing and see everything. Humans rarely see the infinity coiled in every spec of their surroundings. It’s frustrating to know what’s out there and still not to be able to access it.
“No! You are not dying. Not today.” That got no reaction. “Fuck you, Cas! You die and me and I’ll ram that blade of yours so far-”
Dean had Cas pulled close, had his arms wrapped around the guy, by the time Cas ended the kiss, pulling back just far enough to speak.
Dean really wanted to believe Cas knew how that sounded. Hell, maybe he did. The guy couldn’t be that naive, not with everything he’d seen and with what Metatron had dumped in his head. Either way, Dean gave in to the impulse to follow that thread.
Castiel reaches out and takes one of her hands, almost drawing back when she jolts. A moment later, she tightens her grip, and draws both of their hands onto her lap.
He takes the red mug with the pattern that looks like knitted snowflakes for Cas. It looks comforting. He’s got no idea if that helps, but it can’t hurt, right?
He thinks fleetingly of the small room with its blank TV showing him endless loops of illusionary light, of the bed with its nest of blankets. Of the dwindling pile of cash.
Dean twisted his body, feeling the pull in his stomach muscles and down through his thighs. No dice. He couldn’t get enough leverage.
“That’s him,” Gertrude says, her smile lighting up. “I was hoping to hear he’s joining our general group. And that he might want to meet for a drink sometime.” She must catch something in Val’s face, because she rushes on. “Oh, not like that. Beth said something that hinted he was taking a break from anything like that. No. It was just such fun to speak Enochian with someone, and his accent is really unique. I want to know more about where he studied. I think he might know more about it than I do, and I have these tablets-”
Two blocks away from his room he finds himself standing against the wall of a building, his back to the brick, the busy swirl of Charlottesville pushing at him. There are so many people. Where he lived before, when he worked for Nora and worked to hide that he was sleeping in the store-room, there weren’t so many people. The energy drains him, makes him hazy. There is too much, too much of everything, and not enough of him. He doesn’t want to be a fixed point, but he doesn’t want to be buffeted by the myriad presences of others.
Beth sees something of herself in Cas, Riva can see that. A survivor. Someone who needs help working his way through the aftermath. And Riva has seen, has heard, how Dean talks to Cas, and, yeah, it’s not good. She does know that Cas hasn’t told her outright about some of the things Beth and Val are assuming have happened, and she’s worried for the both of them if it turns out they’ve got it wrong.
“And he can still be those things, if he wants to be, once he’s worked through everything,” Beth says, as though Cas can just choose what species to be.
“We’ll each take a turn,” Castiel tells her, leaning in again so only Hannah can hear him. And Tanya, who reaches out to pat Castiel’s cheek from her place on Hannah’s hip. “Children need watching over.”
He had no idea what expression he had on his face, not really, but he could feel the curl to his upper lip. His demonic self wound in spirals within him. Whatever he looked like, the creature before him rose unsteadily, its smoke agitated.
Sam’s voice throws him. It shouldn’t. He can see as well now as he’s been able to for a few years, some of his damaged eyes working again when they hadn’t before he left the Bunker, but he finds himself gripping the banister and swallowing, trying to work out how Sam got so close without being noticed.
“You hear me?” he asked. “Used to think you could always hear me, but then there was that whole being human thing, and I’ve not been sure about how well prayers work for you since. Don’t suppose it matters. Not like you always listen to me, anyway. And I don’t blame you, Cas. I’m not mad at you. Maybe I’ve been too hard on you for not doing things the way I want you to, but I’ve been trying to do better.”
“Hey, Cas,” Sam says. Smiles. It isn’t much better than Dean’s attempt. “You going to help me get these lights untangled?”
Inanna smiles at him, casting a sidelong look his way that could mean all sorts of things, and she steps forward with no sign of hesitation. From what Dean knows of her, it shouldn’t be surprising she’s fine with pushing her way into somewhere without fear.
Each wing flapped, four of them, then two, then six, like Castiel couldn’t decide how many he should have.
“Friendship isn’t about being useful,” she tries at last, feeling bile at the near-afternoon special nature of it. She feels like a Hallmark card. “I mean, you saved Beth and it’ll be good to have some company, but that’s not why I want to know you’re safe. I like you, Aidan, and I don’t want you out on the streets. I don’t want anyone out on the streets, but I’m not a good enough person to go and save them all. I know you. I want to give you somewhere safe and warm to sleep. Okay? You don’t have to be useful to deserve people caring about you.”
“Not on the cosmic scale,” Cas says, but he mutters it, as though not wanting to contradict them all on something so obvious as to be embarrassing. His head is tilted down, and he looks sidelong at Beth as he goes on. “Before I took a vessel, I wasn’t used to being so…limited in time or space, but that’s not the same as being formless.”
She doesn’t answer for a while, but she sighs and rests her forearms on her knees, her hands dangling between them. She turns away from him and appears to be looking across the front garden. When she speaks, it’s gentle and slow, a world of difference to Val, even when Val is being kind.
“Well maybe you shouldn’t be. Maybe Cas’ new friends are right. You know what she asked me? If I’d ever hit him. And I had to say yes. And she asked if I ever put him down, told him he’s got to be useful. And I had to say yes to that, too. So you tell me, Sam. Is that how Cas should be treated?”
“Because you belong here now?” she asks, and that is an edge of bitterness he hears. Possibly. In some ways Hannah is easier to read than almost anyone Castiel has known, but in others she’s as distant as the stars. “You belong here, with them?”
His own throat closes over the rest of the sentence, drowning it, and Dean brings his other hand up to Castiel’s face. In the absence of Dean’s hand in his, Castiel finds himself reaching out and taking hold of Dean’s jacket. The material bunches in the cage of Castiel’s fingers. Dean doesn’t seem to notice.
“Thank you,” he says, because he has no idea how he’s meant to respond. “And…I love you, too,” he adds, because it’s true. If strange to say out loud. He never thought he’d be allowed to say that to either Winchester without a negative reaction. It does soothe some of the itch in his body.
He isn’t quite looking at Sam, and he sees Beth smile out of the corner of his eye, sees her eyes light up in an entirely human way.
“No-one said anything about atoning,” Dean said. “Hannah and Bela, they’re just thinking who might be up to the job. And you’ve got form for leading, no question. But I’m not naming you my Regent or whatever. I’m not even sure I’m gonna use the damn lamp. We can come up with another way.”
He stops by the kitchen and adds some chocolate, some energy bars and a few bottles of water. He must remember that his Grace is weak and insubstantial. He isn’t sure how long it will last, or if it’s fading at all. He takes the water from the front of the shelf and leaves a noticeable space. Dean worries about him drinking enough.
“Cas isn’t even awake so we can ask him,” Val says. “We can’t go deciding we’re wrong about everything without even asking him!”
He doesn’t know if he gets out any more words, but Sam has him out of the house and back in the car before he’s clear, pushing him into the passenger seat and slamming the door.
Bela frowned up at the chains, her body stretched in an attempt to reach them. Even balanced on one of the sturdier boxes, it was a push.
“An angel?” she asks, the mug they’ve given her held partway to her lips. It’s been there for at least a minute. “An angel?”
“Money. Money’s just what I used to keep myself safe once they were gone. It certainly didn’t keep me safe when they were alive. When my father was alive.”
Steve sits on the floor with Tanya as they eat the sandwiches the boys have brought back, answering her questions and speaking to her with the same attention he always gave to Nora. It takes a few minutes for Tanya to warm up to him, but well before the sandwich is gone she’s yelling ‘Seve’ at him and pulling on his arm to make him move the car he’s been given to use.
“Just tell me what you need for the case,” Cas cuts in. Some of his old determination sharpens his words.
She looks back in time to see Dean’s eyes latch onto Cas again, and he’s good at looking worried, at looking caring. Shit, if she saw that look on his face with no context, she’d be begging Aidan to take him back. Cas. God, she needs a shot of something.
Sam runs a hand through his hair, the tense line of his back telling Dean his brother is feeling it, too, even though he’s doing a better job of hiding it.
It’s the same waitress as the last time they were here, a woman with moss coloured eyes and hair that curls around the nape of her neck. The last time, she was tense and unhappy, concerned for a child who needed an operation. She’s much more relaxed today.
Sam’s so engrossed in his reading that he misses the sound of the shower cutting off. He misses the door to the bathroom clicking open.
Cas refuses to get back in the car, even though Dean can see how tired he’s getting. They’ve hardly been out of the house and Cas is clearly exhausted, but he insists he has to walk the trail, and the way he says it gives no room for maneuver.
“That’s how you speak about him? And you’re surprised he left you?” Beth asks, not letting him finish his sentence.
Nora sees Hannah watching her brother. The woman looks deep in thought. Steve appears not to notice.
“Something to do with the case?” Dean asks, turning pointedly away from Riva. He catches Sam’s smile as he does so, but screw him. “Or something else?”
“Yes,” Steve says, and if they both want to pretend they’re believable, then Nora will go with it. “My sister. Hannah.”
She hasn’t seen Hannah for a while, but she’s fairly sure the woman is keeping a close eye on Tanya. Hannah was mortified when she took her attention from Tanya long enough that Tanya tried to make her own deck by banging one of her trucks against the coffee table. For some reason, Steve’s sister seems to think she has to make this up to Nora, even though that table has taken plenty of damage in the past.
“No,” Sam says. “No, we’re looking for some guy called Aidan. He got attacked in the park the same night this Ashely kid came home with marks on him.”
She bites her lip as she glances round the empty room. Val and Beth might both kick off, knowing he’s on his own, but it’s not like visiting hours are all day. And Riva can’t, just can’t, sit in here and do nothing but wait for Cas to wake up.
He should care about the rest of it, no doubt, but all Dean can hear is that last word. As soon as he hears Cas’ name, his focus narrows down, shuts out the rest.
Dean hasn’t told Castiel to leave, not at any point in the weeks since Sam cut open Castiel’s wounds and laid them bare. He’s told Castiel to stay. Still, the jittery, ground-bone feeling of dread caught hold in those first days and has lifted only for short stretches of time since. Dean is human. He is impatient. He will eventually tire of waiting for Castiel to glue the pieces of himself back together.
“Wouldn’t be the first time,” Dean says. He says it like he’s laying down a card, deliberate and challenging.
“Tactical emotional advice?” Dean asks, sounding skeptical. He sighs. “Fine. Got to be worth a try. Lay it on me.”
“Yeah,” Dean says. “Come and help me hang the tinsel. Sam’s got a thing for it. I’m not risking leaving him to do it all. It’ll look like an elf puked all over the bunker.”
“You’re thinking of bolting. Aren’t you? I can see you thinking it. Fuck’s sake, Aidan. We’re friends, you dick. You think you get to go wandering off in the middle of the night, injured, when you can just stay here and let us keep an eye on you?”
“He packed a bag, the day we gave him this room. Put a load of stuff in it, like he was planning on going. I caught him before he went. Shoved it under the bed.”
“Why?” Bela asked, from far closer than Dean had realised she was. “Do you want to hear him say your name from much closer? Maybe from under you?”
Sam shakes his head, not sure how he’s on this side of the argument, what with all the times he’s wanted to tell Dean to tone it down, that it isn’t okay to just lash out with whatever comes into his head. But Dean’s hurting right now and Sam can’t get anywhere until Dean’s calmer.
At Val’s nod, Sam finally stands and crosses the room. He considers brushing a hand against her shoulder, some sort of comforting touch that will say he’s safe, he’s part of their team, but it’s too soon. She needs to stop looking so prickly first. She’s already less defensive than she was, but there’s still work to do.
“No!” Val says, Beth and Riva joining in at the same time. Val goes on. “If Cas wasn’t having an issue with controlled substances, then maybe, but I don’t think it’s the right mix here.”
“You can’t work Dean out in one conversation,” he says, and she swears it’s with some degree of pride. “I’ve been trying for years, and he can still confuse me. Sometimes, I’ve thought I’ve worked him out, and…”
Bela gestured for them to sit, and they ended up seated around the table. It was nothing like any other preparation for battle Castiel had experienced. Then again, he normally didn’t have Dean’s thigh pressed right up against his, either. Change could be a good thing.
When Dean pulls back, only a few seconds later, Castiel still feels the press and texture as a ghost memory. His fingers twitch and he has to stop himself from reaching out and pulling Dean back in.
Finally, Ereshkigal draws back, turning to look at Castiel with more warmth in her eyes. It’s the warmth of a still winter’s day, but it’s there.
The name broke against the silence, and Dean couldn’t fool himself that there was even a hint of movement. But he’d know. Wouldn’t he? He’d know if Cas died. He’d-
Hannah turned as Sam did, keeping him in sight, and that wasn’t at all weird. Sam had got used to Cas and his staring, but it was occurring to him that Cas rarely fixed on Sam the way he did on Dean. That made sense. As far as Sam knew, Cas had never wanted to jump Sam’s bones the way he clearly had Dean’s. Turned out, angelic focus was…a lot.
Almost as soon as they’re outside, they form a barrier between Riva and the room, directing their energy at her. Castiel could listen to what they say. Of course he could. Just as easily as he listened back at Beth’s house. Still, he’s tired and the walls are undulating and he doesn’t like that man’s colors. He isn’t sure he wants to know what he’ll say. And Riva is a comforting presence, for all he’s only met her twice, bringing healing with her at each encounter.
“Look, Dean, we will,” Sam says. Dean hears the sound of Sam’s footstep as he comes closer. “We know he ditched the Thunderbird, right? Picked up a red car? That’s a lead. I’m still searching for reports of a missing car, of any sales-”
Castiel smiles a little each time Jake or Nora make a joke, sharing the occasional look with Hannah, who looks more and more considering, and he helps to rebuild a part of Nora’s home.
There are a bunch of tabs already up, and Sam’s moving to shut them down when the first one catches his eye.
He hears Sam start to say something, but he doesn’t want to hear about how he should watch himself, about how he should be careful not to intimidate or come across as an abusive whatever. There are plenty of times he hasn’t been there for Cas, that he hasn’t saved Cas. This is not one of them.
“You really think he performed a miracle? Holy light, singing, all that?” She shifts on the settee, grimacing and waving Riva away when she moves to help her. “It sounds… I mean, I know what I saw. I think I know what I saw, but even with that it’s fucking impossible to think the guy who saved Beth, who I took out for soup because he didn’t have enough money to feed himself, who I’ve had move into my spare room, is a fucking angel.”
“Um. I suppose so. Yes.” He pauses as it occurs to him he should ask questions in return. That seems to be what people do. “Do you?”
