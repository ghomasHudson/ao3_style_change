She whipped around to glare daggers at
“Yeah. Yeah, let’s go looking for the horny witch and shoot her already.” Dean pushed himself off the wall, not meeting Cas’s eyes as he stared at him. Pleading at him for more but Dean only grabbed Cas’s hand to pull him along with him. “She’s still in her damn house, isn’t she?”
“I’ll do my best.”
Dean swallowed hard before he honestly answered. “Tired.”
playing in the background. He shouldn’t have one hand behind Cas’s neck to deepen the kiss, and his toes shouldn’t curl up when he feels Cas’s heavy sigh inside his mouth. He shouldn’t become so quickly addicted to Cas’s hands reaching under Dean’s shirt to press firmly at his back, feeling the familiar slight burn become a damn forest fire in him.
“Let go of him, and maybe I won’t shoot that dick you still have hanging out.”
Cas just shrugged, a teasing smile on his lips, while Dean rolled his eyes with a sigh.
She didn’t have time to argue because
And with that Cas fell asleep for the first time as Castiel James Winchester. He really liked the sound of that.
“Que miran. Just tell me what’s wrong.”
“Dean?”
"Dean." Cas sounded more annoyed this time. "I'm fine. I was just overpowered-"
That wasn’t anywhere near to what he thought Cas was gonna say.
He fought his instincts to push the hands away while he found reassurance knowing there was a blade that lived in the duffle bag at his feet. It wouldn’t be the first time he would need to take it out to defend himself, but he always used it as a last resort for a human, even for a human whose soul was as blackened as a demon’s eyes.
“If you want me to. I’ll understand.” Cas’s voice was lower, almost hurt. Not in the same pained grumble, he has been using the last two days but still, it hurt to hear him like that.
“Where do I play in?” Dean watches her drink the whole thing in one swing. It probably does nothing for her, but she always did like to look intimidating. Even with the light pink silk pantsuit she was wearing. She looked down at the empty glass before she coldly looked back at him.
“I’ll explain in the car.” Cas threw a packed duffle at Dean and noticed the bandages were still around his fingers. “But we gotta go now.”
Dean noticed other families surrounded them, normal-looking families with a mom, dad, and 2.5 kids, while their little family felt a little out of place. Dean tried not to let it get to him. Favoring to ignore those around them so he could instead enjoy the company of those he loved.
they come back down to Earth.
"Good job best man." Dean patted Sam's shoulder as he walked past him and down to the kitchen. "You want some breakfast."
He pressed on the only name on his contact as he jumped out of the dumpster, but he only ended up falling on his ass. His whole body felt like it was asleep while his head spun.
"I guess we are going to have a lot of time to get to know each other on the honeymoon." Dean starts and he notices Castiel had kind of froze up. Was he regretting his decision already? Was he going to run and leave Dean already? "You know if you want to run I won't-"
Dean blinked a couple of times, trying to find the right words that they googled last night and form them into a sentence. But luckily, Dean was saved by Sam walking into the room, his huge frame looking like a mess, meaning he probably drove nonstop from Garth’s to get here. Eileen came in a few seconds after, but by then, Sam was already diving in to bring Jack into a hug.
“He looks so peaceful.” Cas lifted the folded blanket at Jack’s feet and covered him with it. A soft fond smile playing on his lips while Dean stopped reading to catch the interaction. Watched as Cas’s fingers brush Jack’s hair back while he seemed to visibly relax before he looked up to meet Dean’s gaze. “Why are you still reading to him if he’s asleep?”
“Then talk, Dean. Why have you been avoiding me and then suddenly inviting me out for dinner?”
kid is not…not part of it. The fucked up cycle of deadbeat dads.”
“A list? But how would Jack know who to choose? He hasn’t met many of our siblings.”
“Merry Christmas to you too, hun.” Ellen said patting his back and kissing his cheek.
So Sam is still in his life, but it’s different now. Everything was different now.
“You know how to make that yourself.”
Dean’s panic from before melted away while he nervously waved at Cas. He saw Cas’s eyes widen with a slow-growing grin before he practically ran over to Dean.
"Bitch." Dean calls out as he walked back inside.
“I should have warned you all to look away. Though that wouldn’t have saved you either way.” Amara’s eyes finally went back to normal. She sat down on top of one of the library’s tables and looked down at her hands. “Don’t worry. I fixed everything around us.”
would usually occupy the seat. “Ow.”
Cas laughed as Dean accidentally spit all over the mirror and he handed Dean a tissue from the small box on the counter. The camera was passed to Dean next as it was Cas turn to brush his teeth and Dean asked the same question. Kind of.
Now though, Cas is singing to Fool in the Rain, his favorite track apparently, while Dean gave him a haircut.
“You just knocked out a few hours ago. What are you doing awake? Want me to make you…I don’t know. Some warm milk or tea or whatever?”
“So dinner?” Eileen found him in his room and walked over, arms ready to wrap around his middle. “I was thinking Chinese? We can share a plate of green beans, and you can get that tofu you like.”
Apparently, not saying anything was just as offensive as saying something because then he felt a ring-covered knuckle strike his mouth and send his head back to hit a metal knob. He wished he could have just slept until he was gone, not wanting to deal with pain, but this will do too. As long as the job was done, then he didn’t care how he went anymore.
“Okay, I’ll stop.” Dean turned towards the map again but then turns back to look at Cas. “Has Sam seen you?”
As soon as Ralph said son of a bitch Cas was somehow already shoulder to shoulder with Dean. He laughed, his shoulders shaking, before turning to look at Dean with that big smile again. Dean never thought anybody could look as beautiful as Cas did when he grinned at him like that.
They did easily manage to kill the witch thanks to one of Rowena’s spells that held her in place. They were gone for less than an hour but Dean was on edge the whole time. Wanting to be there when Cas woke up but at the same time scared of what would happen when he did.
Cas sighed but relaxed back into Dean. “I just didn’t like him calling you that. You aren’t stupid, Dean.” Dean chuckled, and Cas turned to look at him, glaring. “I don’t see how this is funny.”
“You? Me? Us? I don’t really know.”
Sam was sitting on the bed laughing his head off while he enjoyed the show. Teasing Dean constantly by saying. “Cas, Dean needs a break. How about you come over here?”
“Yeah,” Dean sighed, pushing away from Cas so he can walk over to sit on the edge of the kitchen table. His hand scrubbed down his face as he looked down at his slippers. “But whatever I gotta do to make sure that
Dean only nodded once before Cas fell back into him. Their lips smashing together into a grinning kiss, teeth smacking together, as Dean wrapped his arms around Cas’s waist to pull him closer. Then he pulled away just enough to kiss Cas again, slowly as he took everything in. Cas’s weight on his lap. Cas’s fingers on his face while he held the back of his neck. The soft noises Cas kept making at the back of his throat as they moved against each other that was making Dean crazy.
He opened the coffee shop door and while he heard the familiar, “Dean! Hey, what are you - Dude, you look like you saw a ghost.”
“Were you mad at
“No.” Dean dryly chuckled as he put his hand over Cas’s own. “But it’s a step towards breaking — fuck what did Doc call it?” Dean thought about it for a second before he snapped his fingers when he got it. “Oh, a vicious cycle of child abuse. That’s the fun phrase we learned last week!”
“Wow. Add anger issues to your therapy session.”
“More than okay.”
Dean nods once before getting to work on a raspado de vainilla for Cas. He works in silence for a minute, just the sound of the ice scraping between them before Dean looks back at Cas.
goddamn peaceful memory I had in my whole fucking life too much to fucking have?”
“Dean?” Charlie walked over to him, her eyebrows pinching together in worry. “You okay?”
“Dean? Dean!” Dean felt someone slap the top of his head. He looked up to see Jo standing behind him. “Are you going to wish us a Merry Christmas or sit there with a mouth full of bacon?”
He flinched again, and when he opened his eyes, the room filled with coughing and gasping breaths.
“Dean was just suggesting we go fishing later. On an actual boat! Would you wanna do that?” Cas smiled at him before they pressed their foreheads together, both of them grinning at each other.
She looked at him with round eyes, shaking her head as if not wanting to believe it.
“Dude,” Dean cleared his throat as he looked down at his food. He could feel his face heat up, not understanding how Cas can be looking at him like he hanged the damn moon. “You’ve been looking at me like that all afternoon. Did cupid shoot you in the ass or something?”
“That one was my favorite.” Cas grinned as he looked back at Dean, his thumb gently reaching to brush on Dean’s bottom lip. “I’m still not sure if you’re real, but I am very happy right now.”
“Kiss.” Cas moaned once again and Sam didn’t hide his laughter while Dean didn’t bother to hide his reddening ears or pleasant sigh after Cas pulled away.
Dean and Jack’s relationship still wasn’t the best. Whenever Dean tried to do anything alone with him, Jack always found an excuse not to do it or invite Cas along. He has tried to apologize and talk about it a few times, but Jack always held his hand up to stop him. To tell him it was okay and he understood, but Dean just couldn’t believe him when Jack can’t look him in the eyes.
Dean quickly wiped his face with his sleeves before turning to look at Jack. “I’m sorry, Jack. I should have taken better care of him. I should have known he was-”
When Rowena did end up coming Cas was in the middle of following Dean around the room whining about another kiss. Dean had his phone to his ear while trying to push Cas off of him. “Dude, back off I’m on a call.”
Cas looked down at it before he slowly grazed it with his fingertips. Then he looked up at Dean with watery eyes and a soft smile. “Please. I forgot, please.”
Dean gently shoved his kid forward with a kick. “Let’s just get the damn food already.”
“I know but the sooner you forgot the faster you will feel better and live happily with us.”
"You? Scared?"
Dean raised his hand to punch his brother, but Sam dodged it by quickly stopping and hiding behind Jack, who looked between them with wide eyes before he softly smiled.
"Dean gave them to me!" Sam pointed at Dean who whistled.
“You do.” He challenged back. Glaring back at Dean as he tries to take the shopping bags back but Dean keeps holding them back. “You have every right to be mad and I-”
When Sam asked if everyone was ready, Cas reached to squeeze Dean’s hand once he let go. Then the witches started to get down to work, the electricity started to go haywire, and the bunker went into a full lockdown mode, but nobody worried about that. Right now, everyone’s focus was on their kid.
“Cas, Jack is fine.” Dean grabbed Cas by the shoulder to look him in the eyes. “He’s still asleep on our bed with Miracle watching his every move. He’s safe.”
“Gross.” She pushed him away this time, tucking her hair behind her ear before smiling at him. It reminded him of Jack’s little shy smile. “But I-I think you’re right. Maybe I’m done wasting time.”
may be it! That
Dean hasn’t said bye to Cas; they always sucked at that, so he wasn’t sure what to do. Should he go in for a hug? A usual safe pat on the shoulder?
Dean moved to stand in front of Cas now, shaking his hair as he went, to double-check his length and make sure it looked good.
The nachos were moved to the table in front of them, where Dean had his feet propped up.
“Calm down, Rocky,” Dean had a hand on
She finally turned to look at him. “But he did. He hurt me! He left me!”
“Do you want me just to stand here? I mean, as an angel, I wouldn’t have gotten tired, but as a human, I think I would find this very uncomfortable.”
. Please make them all go away.”
Cas meet Dean's eyes again and he wanted to read Dean's expression for the right answer but he couldn't find it. "I would like to...sleep?"
“I don’t appreciate the whatever but yes.”
“What?” Cas looks back up at him with eyebrows squished together.
Jack climbs off of Dean and runs out of the room, Dean listening to the quick little squeaks fading away before he lets his face fall into his hands. Once again, he wondered if he was that small when John gave him so much responsibility.
She only visited him once, but that was when
“It’s what he wanted.” Amara continued. “What he needed, really. It’s a gift he was never going to ask for because, just like my little nephew,” Her eyes traveled to Cas before looking back at Dean. “that you’re so…
Dean took the advice and gripped Cas hand before he closed his eyes and rested his head on the back of the seat.
“Doc.” He held his hand out to stop her. “I’m done.”
Cas gave him a sad smile again as his hands slid up to press Dean’s cheeks together. “I love you so much.” Dean sucked in a hiss of a breath at the words said so suddenly. “So please take care of yourself so that I can love you for a long time.”
Both Dean and Cas held their breath’s as they watched Jack stir just a little, and Dean slowly continued to read from the book until Jack relaxed again.
3 a. m. and Dean was sitting in the hospital waiting room waiting for his brother to get there while Jack sat stiffly by his side.
“I know. I know, thank you.”
“Please! It hurts…just one kiss.”
“I’m going to meet up with Cassie.” Technically true.
“Yeah, Cas. Why you don’t like it?”
Cas squeezed it back.
Cas nods while a forced smile tugged at the corner of his lips. “I know. I just hate seeing
“Did you just bring me here to mock me?”
(See the end of the chapter for
shoulder to stop him. “I just wanted to stop you from making it worse.”
Cas shook his head.
“Like I said,’’ Dean kept his other hand on Cas’s cheek, letting his fingertips play with the scruffy beard, and he turned his head, taking a deep, shaky breath before he leaned forward to press his lips on Cas’s throat. Leaving a lingering kiss before he pulled back to hide his face on Cas’s shoulder again. “I missed you.”
Yes, I keep adding unnecessary chapters to this story but I'm already excited for you guys to read the next chapter! Which I will post tomorrow.
“But-”
Dean decided that driving wasn’t the best idea as the last time they stopped at a red light Cas pulled Dean’s head back to kiss him until he was dizzy. The honking was ignored but Sam made the right call to do the driving from now on.
“Merry...Christmas.” Dean stood in the stairway confused as he sees Claire leave and it wasn’t until he heard her door close that he slowly walked back upstairs and to the room he was in. Maybe he can enjoy this dream?
"Night rituals and all." He said and Cas could read annoyance on his face before he sighed with defeat.
“Oh. Dean isn’t-” Cas frowned over at Dean, but Dean just shook his head, letting him know that it was okay. Cas squinted at him before he gave a small smile, not understanding but accepting. “You order for me?”
Dean stopped at the end of the block and turned towards the guy sitting beside him. Cas was already looking at him with puppy dog eyes and a beautiful, hopeful smile. His breath catches in his throat as his mind gets overwhelmed with wanting to reach out and touch Cas. Just to make sure the beautiful boy in his passenger seat was real and make sure que su corazon isn’t just playing games with him.
“I get that pero why do you have to go to their side of town?”
“I know.”
“Ugh…kiss.” Cas whined as he moved just enough to press a soft lingering kiss on Dean. A sigh of relief washed over him before he went back to hiding behind Dean’s back.
Finally, it was time and apparently Dean would be the one that would be walking down the aisle.
On the drive back, Cas and Dean fell asleep in the back seat, bodies slumped together, Dean resting his head on Cas’s shoulder, while Jack fell asleep in the passenger side with his head against the window. Sam drove, smiling as he took his family back home.
Ivy smiled and made a heart with her hands, letting Dean know he was forgiven for being late, especially since he brought her their favorite food.
“Kind of, Sam doesn't always get why she hides out in the apartment, and Clover doesn't get why he wants to live in a shitty apartment near the college,” Dean replied, picking up his beer and taking a swig. “And they locked me up for starting a fire at school. It ended up burning down the science wing.” Taking a swig of his own, now warm beer, Cas nodded in understanding. He looked out across the yard as the quiet of the forest settled over them. It was a beautiful sight, the trees blowing softly in the wind.
Wren nodded in agreement before heading into their bathroom to change. Once they were both ready, Dean grabbed the keys to his beloved ‘67 Chevy Impala. He worked odd jobs around the Orphanage, saving up money to buy it from one of the neighbors. After he and his sister took the bus the first time, it did not fare well for them. They could not hide their skeletal side when someone was about to die. Their true form appeared right before a car plowed into the bottom of the bus, scaring the twins into not wanting to take the bus after. The staff took turns, driving them to work until Dean bought the car and got his license.
Gordon nodded and walked away he didn't know what to say thinking it was better not to say anything at all.
“Awesome, I have to work tomorrow but I'm free saturday night,” Dean said trying to act like he wasn't too excited.
“I got her to laugh earlier,” Cas said, knowing that was something Dean would want to know.
When Jimmy finished changing and fixing her dress, he carried Stella down the stairs and into the living room.
“I know; why do you keep saying it?” Dean asked. It was like the fourth time she had told him that she and Jimmy were just friends.
The messy-haired man opened the crate, Stella scooted back behind Dean, the man smiled softly at her waving his hand for them to come out. Dean took Stella by the hand and crawled out, standing they barely came up to the man's chest.
“Ya, that's me, but I didn't...” Dean trailed off as the guy handed him a pen telling him again to sign.
“I'm leaving for the night, Ivy’s still in the same spot, everyone else is good and in bed,” Meg said.
“Stella, don’t know how,” Dean said, moving to take his sister's hand so they could go play.
“Are you insane? We are not summoning that thing,” Harper whispered, unfolding her arms and leaning forward.
Cas nodded he thought the same thing why would someone do that where they trying to keep Ivy in the facility? What didn't they want anyone to know? Meg handed the file back to Cas, she left going to check on the patients. Cas made his way back into his office pulling out the brown bag he had brought with him. Taking a few moments to eat before attempting to finishe up the notes for his sessions in the morning. Cas was deep in writing letters in a case file when Dean lightly knocked on the door frame announcing himself.
The trio headed up to Sam's room. Looking around, this place was sketchy. The hallway was lined with purple wallpaper. Harper and Dean looked at each other. Karen pointed to the door at the end of the hall. It was the room the manager at the desk gave them when Dean knocked on the door. When the door opened, a short brunette woman was standing there looking just as confused as the trio did.
“That's fine I'll check on her,” Cas said walking away to his office he dropped off his briefcase and headed down the hall he ran into Ash.
“Ash, go to your own table,” Cas said, he could tell that Ivy was getting agitated she was bouncing her leg up and down glaring at the man.
“I'm going check on Ivy” Dean announced after a few more minutes of silence.
She walked in and sat down she motioned for a pen and paper, Cas misled and reached for the pen and note pad she had returned to him earlier.
Dean hurried to help her, but Sam got there first, helping their sister lower herself into her seat, kneeling down and taking off her shoe. In doing so, she cried out in pain as Sam began poking around at it.
Cain nodded, telling Dean where Cas’ and his room was; Dean grabbed the bags making his way up the old wooden steps a picture of little Cas running down the steps filled Dean's mind as he ascended, reaching the top, he turned right and headed down the hall, he knocked lightly on the door there was no answer. Dean sighed and nodded again, this time a little louder, still nothing; he turned the knob seeing the door was unlocked, he made his way inside. He wasn't surprised by what he saw a queen size bed pushed against the wall; on the other side, rows of bookshelves lined with books a beehive suncatcher hung in the window. Cas didn't move as Dean walked in, dropping the bags on the floor.
“Wait. What? Why? We didn't do anything to you,” Dean replied they were new they hadn’t been there for more than an hour.
“No one, only you,” Ivy said. A tear fell from her eye, and she wiped it away with her sweater.
Anna nodded and said if they needed her, she would be at the desk. After dinner was usually quiet, and no one caused too much of a disturbance. She glared at Dean as she walked out.
“Ivy you gotta calm down,” Dean said holding his hands up to his sister show her he wasn't a threat.
Jimmy sighed and laid down on the floor, looking under the table while Cas talked to Dean.
“Before we go back in, how old are they? Willow seems small,” Cas asked. It wasn't uncommon for female hybrids to be smaller than their male counterparts.
“Dean,” Ivy said in the same unused rough voice spotting her brother standing odd to the side.
“It's not the first time, but for some reason, I can't stay dead!” Harper screamed at him, “I came back. You didn't; how was I supposed to deal with that Dean?”
They both said yeah and would show them where. The twins were hosted up more gently this time and walked into the house. They looked around in aw that had never been inside a home. The closest they came was the office outside the barn where they lived.
Dean choked on his juice, spilling it all over the table in the process. “No-Cas. That's not- look, I didn't know I was getting a sexbot. I need to adjust to the idea,” he said as he cleaned up the mess with the napkins that were on the table.
He laughed when Cas popped up, grabbing him pulling him back into the bed placing light kisses on Dean's face. Dean adjusted himself into a more comfortable and accessible potion for Cas, enjoying the feeling f the other fairies' lips on his skin. The tenderness was euphoric; Dean had never had anyone kiss him the way Cas does. He was always the one who was tender and caring in the relationship. It was nice to have it reciprocated.
“Damn it, I swear she's worse when Dom is around,” the fairy complained.
“Karen,” Pamela shouted, hugging her like they hadn't seen each other in years.
“Cassie, open the door, talk to me,” Gabriel called out again.
Dean shrugged and looked at his shoes; he didn't think they would care no one else did when he told them about Stella and how he thought something was wrong.
Sam said it was nothing personal he just wanted to do it alone. He needed to take care of it himself.
Grabbing a towel off the rack, he tossed it over the mess on the floor, not caring about it at the moment. He wanted to feel clean, warm. Hoping a hot shower would help break the fever. Gingerly removing his pants as he shifted his weight, his knee buckled from the pain he swore, catching himself on the counter. Finally, he managed to get the rest of his clothes off, testing the water before getting it. Make sure it wasn't too cold or too hot. He decided to lean against the wall, figuring out that he would not have his leg give out on him again.
Dean shuffled, saying these next few hands were practice so everyone would get their chips back when the hand was finished. Cas furrowed his brow, trying to understand the rules and how the hands work. Texas hold ‘em was the game; Dean and his friends were patient with him while he figured it out. As Dean affectionately called him, Salem was standing behind Benny, shaking her head, mouthing he was bluffing, so Cas called and won the pot.
“Yeah, who else? It's like since he showed up all pretty with his sad blue eyes. I'm invisible,” Ash said, leaning forward in his chair.
”Dean, do you have a rash too?” Cas asked he knew the answer, but he had to ask.
"I'm not saying that, and she doesn't want you to touch her right now," Dean replied, shaking his head there was no way he was getting in trouble.
“Wanna play the game?” Ivy asked. She didn't really want to play the game, but Dean enjoyed them, so she thought she would ask.
“How long has she been asleep?’ Dean asked in a hushed voice.
Jimmy looked for the cream to put on Stella. He could count her ribs; he sighed, feeling terrible that they weren't taken care of properly. He was going to have to be patient with her; she was just a baby.
”Dean, remember what I said, Stella can pick out what she wants to play with, ” Cas said with a stern look.
Dean turned around to face the counter, taking a deep breath to calm his nerves. The way the robot had stared at him made him uncomfortable like the thing was looking into his soul. He only wanted to have an online date, jerk off a few times, and be done with it. What was he going to do with a sex robot in his apartment all day?
”Thanks, Dad, give papa love for us, ” Jimmy said, hanging up the phone relation the message about the doctor.
Everyone watched as Jimmy carried Stella back into the dining room. Mitch shook his head at Jimmy. He knew him, and the maid had a fling, but he had Jimmy put an end to it, there was no way Jimmy could mate a Beta.
“You must be Dr. Novak. I am Meg Masters head nurse,” the brunette woman said, holding out her hand for Cas to shake.
“Found ‘em,” Ash mumbled.
Dean couldn't believe this was happening someone had raped his sister and he didn't even know. How did this happen? He was supposed to protect her, keep her from harm and shit like this. It must have been when they were in separate group homes which he blamed himself for they sent him to a farm and Ivy to a house not to far apart the could still see each other but there were days that Ivy was withdrawn Dean just thought she was sad because they weren't together,
“Jimmy's trying to give me drugs,” Ash said, holding up the baggy.
He was wearing an oversized sweater and thigh highs. His green-eyes wide with amusement, “Professor?” Dean asked in a teasing voice, getting up off the bed and walking over to the Alpha.
Karen smiled and introduced Sam and the twins; that was the reason they were there in the first place.
Dean pushed the door open, choosing to lead the way deeper into the house, toward the living room. Wren hung back as Dean made his way over to the couch, where everyone had begun moving out of his way.
TRIGGER WARNING VIOLENCE
“Yes, I feel all kinds of things,” Castiel replied, looking over at Dean.
”But I, I made sure,” Dean said as a tear slid down his cheek.
Over a month and I still haven’t heard from Sam, the Asshole.
The doctor came in a short round man with no hair, and a red face smiled softly at Stella, who hid behind Jimmy. He laughed and waved, turning his attention to Cas.
Cas groaned under his breath; this whole thing was stupid! Why couldn't Michael marry the guy? He grabbed his drink and food when his name was called, mumbling into the phone that he was on his way to the house and to stall for him. Jimmy agreed reluctantly but told Cas to hurry, their guests would be at the house soon, and he could only stall for so long. He called a Lyft and waited; naturally, it was going to take forever for one to get to him, but whatever. Cas didn't want to be a part of this arranged marriage. His parents were only doing it to make more money and thinking it would tame Castiel and Jimmy to keep them from staying out at all hours of the night and ruining the Novak name. The ride finally showed up a few minutes later; he jumped inside and sat back so that he could finish his morning drink, thinking about the night before, grateful he got it in before he was married off. He thanked the driver as they pulled up to the house, a ‘modest-looking mansion’ as his mother called it. It was large enough for the whole family to live in without it being over the top. Cas carefully opened the door attempting to sneak in.
“Yeah, Sis. I feel it. I just don't know what it means. Maybe after work, we can talk to Rowena when we get home,” Dean replied, turning the car off and opening the door.
Some Cas and Dean love
The man took a breath, telling her to wait that he could prove it was him; he was who he said he was; Harper shook her head not wanting to believe the lies it would get her killed, “What Harp, please,” he told the pleading in his voice made her second guess shooting him.
Ivy stared out of the window for most of the day just thinking about things. What could Dr. Novak know about what happened to her? She didn't tell anyone she did try to tell ended up getting hurt and she was not going to have that happen to Cas. What if he found out that Dr. Novak knew he would hurt her? Would he hurt Dr. Novak?
“Of course, that's what I was built for.,” Castiel replied automatically.
“I don't know, Dean-o, the other patients got jealous last time,” Meg said. She hated that the other patients took the things that Dean brought for Ivy, but they did the best they could.
“No, she has the day off, I'm Jo,” the girl replied, holding out her hand to Cas.
Dean went to Ivy’s room she was curled up on the bed asleep he didn't want to wake her so he went to Cas’s office door was closed so he sat outside it wasn't too long before the door opened and Ruby walked out.
Harper sighed, looking down, spotting the woman holding a flashlight illuminating the ladder just a bit; she squinted, trying to see who was climbing up.  The shape was too small to be Sam but too big to be a woman; she stood up armed with a whiskey bottle and her gun.
“Jimmy?’ Cas asked; he sounded a bit annoyed.
Cas nodded like it was no big deal, giving Dean a wink. Dean shook his head, his dad was known, but he didn't have that much pull with Naomi. In fact, Dean felt like the woman didn't like him. He made a mental note to ask his dad about it. Maybe he knew why. Dean enjoyed looking at all the flat land he had never strayed too far from the city as he was excited to see a farm.
“Grab what you want. There is plenty,” Salem said, pulling Cas from his thoughts, shoving a plate into his hands.
The crate lifted onto the back of truck straps thrown across the top to tie it down, making sure the twin's stayed put in the end.
Harper knocked on Karen's door, she was surprised to see her standing there giving a concerned look before talking, “What are you doing?” Karen asked for backing up when Harper made a move to walk into the room.
Cas sighed, shaking his head, watching Stella and Dean teach the simple puppy commands.
Naomi looked at Cas like he had three heads, Gabriel was covering his mouth, trying not to laugh, and Michael looked shocked, his mouth hanging open. Cas sighed turned to the cart, pouring another drink. The feeling he got the night of the full moon was strong. The need to hunt was starting to wash over him.
”I'll check out the boy first, ” the doctor said, he set his bag down on the table next to Dean and pulled out a stethoscope. He listens to Dean's heart and lungs the doctor said Dean was great he needed to get undressed so he could check out the rest of him.
“I would like to ask if you knew why the group home isn't in your sister's file?” Cas asked after a few moments of silence between them. He was fine with the quiet but he wanted ot know what else was missing from Ivy’s file.
Ivy slumped in her seat and pouted, Dean nudged her with his arm his cheeks poking out with food as he talked to her. “Ivy eat a little and then we will play a board game you can pick” Dean encouraged pointing at her tray with his fork.
“Hey Cas,” Dean whispered seeing his sister asleep in the chair.
Sam and Harper laughed; Pamela looked them both up and down.
Dean couldn't help but wonder what it would be like to be inside Cas, would it be like the other men or different because it was a bot? Would it react the same way or not? These were all questions Dean wanted to ask, but he was self-conscious about asking, so he let it go.
“You shouldn’t have done that,” Meg said raising an eyebrow at Cas.
“Oh nothing, also-fucking-lately nothing,” Gabe replied, slamming the bead down on the table, making the flour puff up in a cloud.
“She ok?” Benny asked as he wrote down what Dean was saying.
Wren watched in slight awe at the display, nodding to herself and said she would let the nurses know. Then she was going to check on the other patients. Dean didn't reply, but she knew he heard her as she headed out of the room and down the hall to the nurse's desk to tell them that Jack had passed away. Eventually, Dean joined her as they talked to other patients and did whatever the nurses wanted them to do.
“Don't you wanna know what is going on?” Dean asked, grabbing a can of paint.
Elle was heading out as they were heading in, giving them the rundown of everything and that she would be back late.
“Go away,” Cas called out.
Ivy nodded and started to write again, “Sorry!” she wrote holding it up showing Dean and Cas.
“I will talk to her. Will that make you feel better?” Cas asked.
“What do I get?’ Dean asked smiled she made a face and kissed him on the cheek he handed her the bag, she pulled out the leather-bound journal and pens, she brushed her hand down it
“Ruby and she is perfect,” Sam answered dreamily. “I met her at the coffee shop on campus. She smiled at me and tucked her hair behind her ear,” he smiled as he continued to tell them all about the new girl in his life. Clover grinned at his brother’s smitten look, asking more questions about her and who the guy the picture was holding her hand. Sam frowned, saying it was her boyfriend, but he was a jerk to her. Always treating her like dirt.
Cas gently laid Dean down on the bed, laying himself on top, breaking the kiss for a second to make sure he was okay with what was going to happen.
“No leave it,” Dean said, trying to grab the box out of Ivy’s hands.
Dean laughed, watching the two get in line, looking at the food available for the day, “She likes him,” he commented.
“Money is not a problem for me,” Crowley said, looking around before his eyes settled on Dean.
Ivy shook her head; her eyes glistened with tears as she pulled her oversized sweater tighter around herself. Still shaking her head as she pulled her legs up to her chest. Ivy looked up at him. Her eyes pleaded not to ask her again to write anything down.
“Happy?” Cas asked, kissing Dean's shoulder.
He turned to look when his reflection caught his attention. His face was different; it was half skeletal, which was normal when someone was about to die. The other half, this was new, it was rotten. His eyeball hanging out, the skin peeling from his cranium, exposing the muscle and sinew underneath. He was horrified as he turned towards his sister. She looked the same as him, part of her face half falling off, hair thinned and barely there. This had never happened before, Wren stood abruptly and rushed to her brother, reaching for him to cling to his shirt. They both felt a life, but it felt much deeper, more connected to them as it was snuffed out instantly. Dean grabbed his chest as the pain shot through his heart. Wren could feel the pain as she wrapped her arms around her brother to comfort him.
“That was amazing, I didn't think she would be able to talk about all these years of silence,” Cas responded still in shock that Ivy said not one but two names.
“You tell her I was coming?” Benny asked looking at Ivy as well.
“Promise?” Ivy asked in a small voice.
They drove until they came upon an old abandoned farm grabbing everything they had in the truck and bags before heading in; Harper looked at Dean and sighed. “Are you sure this is a good idea?” Harper asked as they pulled out cans of spray paint forwarding.
Sam nodded, pulling it out of his jacket pocket to present to her. Clover smiled and reached for it, huffing in frustration when he pulled it away before she could get it. She made a face at her little brother.
She nodded and then shook her head, Cas looked at her there was something she wanted to say but couldn’t.
“Everyone is ok, Ivy wouldn't get out of bed so we thought we would wait for you to get here. See if you can coax her out of bed, she gets like this on the days Dean doesn't come for breakfast.
Dean rubbed his face walking towards his sister. When she didn't move, he pulled her into a tight hug, whispering how sorry he was, and he loved her kissing the top of her head as the built-up pain and anger came pouring out. Karen said that if they wanted to go to Pontiac, they should get a move on.
“Karen!” Harper yelled, rushing to her side.
“Ivy is having a hard night; she's missing Dean tonight,” Anna said, looking at Ivy. she had worked there long enough to know the differences in the girl's moods between the times she had a nightmare and now when she just missed her brother.
Stella spotted something shiny across the street from the park, following the reflection she was about to step into the street when Jimmy grabbed her.
“I know, go on I wanna talk to Dean and show that to Marv, ok?’ Cas asked, moving to sit down in his seat making notes in Ivy's chart.
Out of breath, Cas positioned them more comfortable as they waited for the knot to go down. Dean snuggled back closer to Cas, grabbing his arm and wrapping it around him.
“Breathe, there is nothing to worry about,” Cas said, handing their boarding passes to the flight attendant.
Ivy took it and looked at it no one sent her stuff she took the box with caution wondering if could be from her dad, but why would he start sending her stuff now? There was an envelope taped to the top with her name on it in fancy script, she smiled and glided her fingers over the pretty lettering. The tape along the box came off when she pulled the letter off.
”Be gentle, they are babies,” the messy hair man said with a rough voice, he looked down at the twins and gave a soft smile.
Dean didn't stop saying goodbye to anyone. He needed time to process what was going on as he made his way to his second job. He bartended the lunch hour and into the evening at the local gay bar/strip club in town. Dean wasn't a huge fan of working there but it was a job and it helped cover what they insurance didn't to keep Ivy close to him. He pulled in on autopilot getting out of the car the manager greeted him.
Stella clapped and patted her puppy in praise for going potty outside, Jimmy smiled.
His heart skipped a beat when he felt Dean calloused hand slip into his, the rough and soft at the same time he longed for this the closeness the feeling of the fur brushing inside his skin settled the need to be near Dean was fulfilled, he was content and happy at that moment. Dean leads him out of the kitchen, passed everyone in the dining room and down the small hall.
"I'm so fucking pissed! how could he do that?"
“Hey brotha I thought you were seeing Ivy this mornin’,’” Benny greeted as his friend took a seat.
“Thank you, Marv; I will make a note of it and then talk to Ivy,” Cas said.
“Yes, go on,” Cas said, “I'll talk to you later.”
Cas headed back to his office to read over the files again seeing what he missed he didn’t remember reading anything about Ivy being in a group home maybe something happened there.
Ivy made a face and ate a little bit of food, Benny teased her and she laughed a bit smile a little more as she took small bites to please Dean. When they were done Benny cleared the trays and Dean told Ivy to go pick out a game. At the same time, he talked to Cas for a moment, Benny was almost to the table and followed Ivy to help her grab a game from the top shelf if that was something she wanted.
Jimmy dint know what to say but he watched Stella play with her new puppy as he sat down on the couch.
“He hasn't been in a while, that will make Ivy’s day,” Meg said happy to hear someone else was coming to visit besides Dean.
“Marv, it's not nice to leave Ivy alone,” Meg said, leaving the man and making her way over to Ivy to let her know that Dean was going to be late.
“In Ivy’s room, they broke some of her stuff she got upset it was mess,” Cas said rubbing his face.
”Sorry, she didn't mean it, ” Dean said quickly.
“Not use to nice touch,” Ivy said, looking at him with big green eyes.
Cas looked at Jimmy; their profiles said they knew how to speak, eat, and drink on their own it was all lies.
“I just want you to find..” Naomi was cut off by Cas groaning loudly.
The radio and TV turned on, static blarring louder as Pamela demanded the thing show itself.
“I don't know control would be my best guest” Cas suggested with a shrug in truth he didn't know but it was his best guess.
Dean and Stella grew up on an Omega ranch. They never knew their parents, taken away after they were born, the only living pair of twins on the farm. They were kept away from the others for their protection on having a few scheduled pay dates with others to build social skills. The twins, as unique as they were, were not taken care of very well; they were tiny, underweight, but perfect for the Alphas, who liked their Omegas to be like babies.
”Um, I need to be changed, ” Dean said in a small voice, hoping he wouldn't get in trouble. Dean always got in trouble when he told their care person he needed to be changed.
“It's ok, I believe you,” Dean said, pulling Sam into a hug and letting go.
Stella didn't want to play with the blocks she got up and wandered away. At the same time, Benny was putting the blocks away. She found the stuffed animals she sat down, taking her pacifier out of her mouth, setting it on the ground next to her teddy bear, and started babbling to the animals.
“I hate it,” Ash said, walking into Cas’s office.
"Nothing, you wanna see Stella's new present?" Cas asked.
“You wanna come up?” Benny asked as he opened the car door.
“Making sure you know,” Ivy shrugged.
"I know," Jimmy said, shutting his door.
“Ivy, he has room too,” Dean smiled. She was always worried about everyone else.
”Chere, you ok?” Benny asked, sitting next to her.
“Go away,” Harper yelled back, wiping a tear that started to roll down her cheek.
"Still mad?" Cas asked.
“Come on Doc you can eat with us,” Benny said clapping Cas on the shoulder before leaving the room and heading down the hall to find Ivy.
“This came for you,” Jo said handing the box over to Ivy she was ginning ear to ear, wondering who could have sent Ivy a package and what was inside.
“Dean!” Wren screeched out of nowhere, which startled the hell out of Dean in the process.
“You got blood on your pants,” Dean said, noticing the spot on the leg.
She smiled last time Dean bought her dessert. Ash took it and ate it. Ivy was so upset she would get out of bed after all Dean bought it for her, not him.
“I’m sorry,” Cas replied, his voice thick with tears. He looked up at Dean, his blue eyes sad and full of what looked like guilt.
Ivy heard the lock click and she looked up and smiled when she saw Dean getting off the bed to hug him.
Harper laughed a bit at Karen’s comeback; she loved that she didn't take any shit from any of them. The roll of thunder wasn't subtle; the lighting stuck with a crack above the barn roof as the wind picked up, rattling the roof the stench of burning Vanilla and rotten Jasmine filling the air, making them gag. The board holding the door shut began to splinter. Harper looked between Dean and Karen having her shotgun at the ready. When the doors opened, a figure stepped through, the guns going off with a bang. The man never stopped walking towards them as the light bulbs burst. He looked around and stopped in front of Dean.
The mansion was huge, stone steps leading to mahogany doors, two stories a balcony on top the wrapped around, white with grey trim, two men stood at the bottom level. Dark hair, blue eyes, one with messy hair, the other looked combed. Different styles, the one with messy hair, wore a suit, while the other had on jeans and a t-shirt.
*************************************
“Your grandfather has taken you sister and the boy; he wants us there for dinner. I need you to go to the bakery and help your mom for a while until the replacements show up,” John said,,,, walking out of Dean's room leaving the door open.
"You have Stella and judging by her reaction…"
Stella nodded he had been kind to her so far; she stood there waiting for the water to fill up, Jimmy pulled her dress off and smiled, touching her face softly, he pulled her shoes off and then her diaper causing her to whimper.
Pretend you are in school, and you are reading over the rules or the lessons for the day.
Stella made a face and signed again, pointing at Jimmy. Dean looked at him for help.
Cas woke up the next morning and went for a run, thinking about Ivy, hoping there was some way to get her to start talking again. He showered, made breakfast, and then headed out to the facility; he parked at the spot with his name on it; that was fast he was hired last week. Cas ran to the front door. Showed his pass to the guard; the door buzzed. He asked where he was supposed to go and headed to the elevators; he stopped at the nurse's desk.
“Ivy? It's me, Meg I'm gonna undo the straps ok” Meg said gently undoing the restraints.
Dean ignored Cas as he put the groceries away; he still wasn't sure what to say. He too felt the bond and a pull when it came to Cas, but now that Clover tried to kill him... well, that may put a wrench in things for the two of them. Dean decided after that that he won't bring up what actually happened to his last few relationships, even though the bastards had it coming.
“It’s not you; I want her close, that’s all I think half a day should be good to start, ” Jimmy replied, smiling.
Cas’s phone chimed, letting him know he received an email. He used his cellphone for private emails, and he smiled when he saw one from his favorite Cam boy.
He groaned as he grabbed the bottle of slick, drizzling some over himself, and lubed his hand. The Alpha started slowly working himself, thinking for some reason he should film himself jerking off to the Omega. Grabbing the phone that was next to the laptop and opening up the camera.
They both moaned as Cas slipped his tongue into Dean's mouth, the taste of peppermint toothpaste exploded in his mouth. He moved his hands down the Omegas back, cupping his butt, encouraging him to jump up and wrap his legs around his waist. It was everything he hoped for. The Omega was light in his arms as they moved towards the bed.
“What did you get her?’ Cas asked spotting the bag in Dean's hand.
She raised an eyebrow and nodded, “He is pretty. Wait till you see Ivy up close. She's just as pretty,” Meg said, laughing as she moved away from the desk.
After they finished and Jimmy helping Stella learn to pick up the food to feed herself, Cas took Dean for a bath while Jimmy played with Stella.
“All by yourself? Who do you think you are? Your mom?” Karen asked, giving Sam a pointed look.
“I'm sorry, Dean. I have seen this in patients who have been forced into certain fetishes. I'm assuming your sister was restained. When that happens she retreats to a happier place in her mind,” Cas tried to answer Dean's question the best he could without help from Ivy.
“So, wet already,” Cas groaned out, rubbing the pad of his finger around the hole, teasing Dean relentlessly.
Dean looked up at him with lust blown eyes, licking his pink, plump lips, and opening his mouth while leaning forward. Cas smiled, grabbing the base of his cock and slowly feeding it into the waiting mouth.
Stella looked up and made an angry face at Jimmy. She wasn't going to forgive him so fast.
Cas stiffened a bit, Dean's breath hot on the back of his next to the way he said he wanted to photograph him, turned him on more than he ever thought. Images of him naked on the bed while Dean took pictures made him smile a bit.
“Uh, sorry, brotha,” Benny said, rubbing the back of his neck, “You playing?”
“No more restraining her this is, this I….. I have seen this in abuse victims” Cas said shaking his head placing the pen and paper on the desk. The thought that someone abused Ivy this bad made his stomach turn he wondered how many times she attempted to tell people what happened and no listened. The file only stated she tried to slit her wrist but not why she did it in the first place.
“I met your brother; he seems very nice,” Cas said, watching as the girl's face lit up at the mention of her brother.
"What a cute puppy, what is her name?" the nurse asked.
“Good point, Ash. Where did you get the drugs?” Cas asked, looking at the other man.
“Cas,” Dean said, gently walking over to him.
“Thank you, Sir,” Dean replied, a smile in his voice.
“It's fine; it was a tense morning and evening, I get it,” Cas replied. He really did understand where Dean was coming from, and it was true he didn't understand what was going on with his new boyfriend's family. Still, he was going to stay and support Dean and Blue.
It was normal for the kids to move out of the Orphanage when they turned eighteen. The Orphanage set them up with jobs and an apartment, even going as far as to open bank accounts when they are old enough to start work to start saving for bills.
“We are going to grab a beer,” Dean held his hand up as Karen and Harper were about to protest.
Dean didn't say anything at first, he waited until he knew neither Benny or Ivy could hear him. He turned his attention to Cas who picked at some tape on the table that must have been left over from a craft day.
Harper looked at Karen, “Then how the hell are we here?” she asked, moving to take up Dean's spot hugging Sam. even tho she was mad at both of her brothers, she still missed him.
“I fell, and I think I hurt my ankle,” Clover complained, limping her way over to the table.
”Stella can't talk, ” Dean said softly, not wanting to get in trouble, but they needed to know.
Dean walked over to Ivy she was staring out the window a tear slid down her cheek. Ivy got a bit of special treatment Dean could visit when he wanted to, he didn't have to wait for visiting day. One of the doctors tried to stop him from coming as he please. That didn't last long after Ivy stopped eating, getting out of bed and showering. The doctor looked at Dean visiting as a reward for Ivy instead something important to her mental health. The whole pln backfired in the doctors face he was fired soon after the following doctor was the one who lifted restrictions on Dean visiting his sister.
Jimmy nodded. Ivy laid down. Jimmy cuddled up behind her; it felt nice to cuddle with someone that wasn't expecting sex or anything from him other than just being held. However, Jimmy was thinking about nice Ivy smelled and her warmth pressed against him breathing softly as she slept. Jimmy always made sure he touched her gently after seeing what happened in the stairwell. He figured the only gentle touch she got was when Dean hugged her; he could feel himself getting hard, which was not what he wasn't right now. With her ass pressed up against him holding his hand next to her cheek, he brushed his thumb across her cheek. Jeez, her skin was so soft Jimmy wanted to feel more of Ivy. He wanted to show her that not everyone was so rough. Ivy shifted to get more comfortable rubbed up against him; he pressed closer and kissed her shoulder.
Most of the children looked like humans. The demon children had black, red, or white eyes, depending on their parents' type of lineage. Angels are rare, but one or two have shown up every so often. Fluffy wings and halos, those things were easy enough to hide from the world.
Stella sighed and looked at Jimmy, putting the puppy down and sighing.
It was the talk of the town; everyone knew that people would drop their unwanted children outside of the fence, but what the city didn't know was what kind of children resided inside the building. After all, monsters, Demons, and everything in between needed a place for their orphans and unwanted children.
She always was kind to the twins. As a powerful witch, she had spells in her arsenal that could ward against Death. So an accidental brush of the twins’ skeleton parts was nothing to her.
”Ok, I am going to take your temperature, ” he said, holding up the thermometer that goes in the ear.
“That's good,” Cas replied. He wanted for Dean to say something else.
Gabriel watched as the siblings played and talked amongst themselves.
“Mom?” Cas asked.
He had never felt this way with anyone but Cas, the bliss the deep subspace he could feel himself falling into as Cas rubbed his cheeks; Dean was hard, trying not to find the friction he so desperately wanted. He felt Cas shift under him, knowing that Cas was getting a bit turned on. He hoped that Cas wouldn't end it just yet. He wanted to feel his cock inside of him, splitting him in half in the most delicious way possible.
"She's your puppy," Dean said and signed back to Stella.
Stella turned away she was angry, first the waitress and now the maid, why weren't they good enough?
Chapter One
Ivy nodded, “I just miss Dean,” she wrote making a sad face.
“So, Castiel is it,” Johns voiced out, pulling Cas from his thoughts as the man turned his attention to the other end of the table.
“No. What do you wish for me to do? I could perform oral sex on you if you wish,” Cas replied, “I have no gag reflex per your request, or I could-”
"She smelled you and could hear the sound of your voice. It's deep, so it's easier for her to hear, and the house was quiet," Dean said.
“Harper Lee, girl, if you don't get down from that water tower!” Karen's voice carried through the silence pulling Harper from her thoughts.
Cas sighed. They had talked about it, but he didn't know Jimmy bought the dog. Dean rubbed his eyes, looking around.
“What is it with you and heights?” the gruff-voiced asked when the figure reached the top.
Dean was super excited to see all the cars and learn about them so more. On the website, they list the things the "babies" like, so their Mommies and Daddies have an idea of what to buy before their babies got to their new homes.
“Your house is beautiful,” Cas commented, taking his seat next to Dean.
“Should I masturbate while you eat?” Cas asked, watching Dean intently, awaiting the order.
”That's alright I was waiting long, I need to renew my ads, ” Zachariah said, smiling at Stella she moved next to Jimmy sitting on the floor next to him.
Cas chasing after them yell to be careful, he would help them, they didn't listen climbing onto the swings themselves and laughing. Jimmy smiled, watching Stella. He was kicking himself for not ending things with Anna long before he found Stella and for what happened the night before he figured a few gifts should set things right between them.
“What are you so happy about?’ Meg asked watching the doctor smile as he flipped through the messages.
”No, she doesn't know how,” Dean said while picking up the cup to look at it, he was confused. They never used these kinds of containers; they only drank from bottles.
”You shouldn't have left him, not yours anymore, ” Bela said, snatching the bear back, holding it out of Stella’s reach.
"Ok, Daddy, I love you," Dean said, running off to tell Benny and Charlie all about the new puppy.
Stella jumped when she felt a hand on her shoulder; it was Elle.
”Sweetheart, Stella is going to sleep with Jimmy, and you are going to sleep with me, ” Cas explained.
“Do you like him? Is he nice when I'm not around? Dean asked, he was always worried about how the doctors treated her. Some were ok and others well, they should never be allowed near anyone. Ivy nodded and smiled, this time the smile reached her eyes.
Stella ignored Jimmy as he got her redressed and picked her up.
“I'm the one who gripped you tight and lowered you from perdition,” the man replied as if Dean should have known who he was; there was static in the air, the thunder booming loudly over the barn the lighting created inside made a silhouette of wings protruding from the man's back as well as large horns curling up and over the top of his head.
Dom sighed, shaking his head, “Blue should be respected; if she lived with us, no one, and I mean no one, would lay a hand on her,” he bit out, looking at the bruises covering his friend.
“Told ya,” Meg said going to Marv and leading him away from all of the commotion to get him cleaned up.
“Don't thank me yet” Cas said poking at his food and making a face.
The twins woke up about twenty minutes before the doctor was supposed to get there. Jimmy explained as much as he could while he changed Stella that the doctor was going to touch her, and he would stay the whole time.
"This is why we buy two of everything," Cas said, going to comfort Dean.
Ivy made her way to the window seat avoiding everyone she didn't want their pity or comfort. She hated that she got stuck in her head when they restrained her but she couldn't help it. She was trained that way. Ivy jumped a bit when she felt a hand on her should she smiled when she saw that it was just Marv.
Cas tilted his head to the side like he was trying to figure out what Dean was talking about, “I don't understand,” he said after a few moments of thinking.
Ivy perked up and nodded.
“I know I just I think I know what happened when she was younger and I don't know how to bring it up to Dean,” Cas said rubbing his face and looking over at the nurse.
“You're nice.”
“I love you too," Dean said with a smile, looking over at the doctor, “Sorry Cas, did you want some?’ he asked, nodding to the pastry.
“Maybe hold on to the pen sometimes when she comes back she tries to hurt herself,” Meg said a she tucked Ivy in making sure she was wrapped snug how she liked.
He was more than happy with his new car, grinning from ear to ear as they headed to a cafe for lunch.
“I would like that, and it's not against anything as far as I know,” Cas said shuffling the papers on his desk making it look like it was no big deal he was going to hang out with Dean.
“We are going to summon this thing,” Dean replied, closing his phone and looking out the window.
”that's ok, we will figure out a way for her to call Jimmy, ” Castiel said.
“Stelly, are you sad about the bear?” Dean asked he thought that might be it.
“Where’s Jimmy?” Cas asked as he sat down on the couch.
Dean got off the elevator, walking out of the building he headed to his car looking up at the window he spotted his sister looking down at him, he waved she didn't wave back. Dean sighed as he got into the car shutting the door he put the key in the ignition. Deciding to head to the cafe Dean sometimes worked at when people called in sick. His childhood best friend happened to own when his stomach growled, also needing someone to talk to knowing that Benny would be there as he was most days. Dean smiled when he walked into the restaurant spotting the man, he gave a wave and made his way to the counter taking a seat.
“Why don't you go put your underwear back on?” Dean suggested looking at Cas from the corner of his eye.
“Yeah or a combination, like Blue, she's a mischief fairy, but she likes to bake, so she has a bit of kitchen fairy in her,” Dean replied, looking around when he heard his sisters giggle. He spotted her running down the hall. Gabe chasing her, she waved as she ran by.
Jimmy was happy they had bought booster seats for the twins seeing as how small they were; Cas agreed, strapping Dean in kissing him on his forehead. Stella looked at Jimmy wanted a kiss too, he smiled and kissed her forehead she smiled and rubbed her eyes.
Castiel looked like he was trying to process the answer, “I was built for you according to your specifications. Why would I say, no? You are attractive,” He said bluntly, the confusion clear on the robot’s face.
“That obvious?” Cas asked; he rubbed his face and looked over at Meg.
“I don't know if I'm going to check on her, why do you ask?” Cas said intrigued at how the other patients were concerned when something was a bit off with Ivy. he figured they spent too much time together they would notice.
Jimmy sighed. There were a lot of things she didn't like because people were mean to her, but he was going to show her just how much love he had to give, and not every Alpha is mean.
“I do, too,” Dean realized, getting up off the bed to start getting ready.
“What?’ Dean yelled, the ringing in his ears, making it hard to hear what his sister was trying to say to him.
“I know, but I’m not sending her back to that place; she will come to work with me. There is a daycare for the Omegas, and I will have the teacher assess her,” Jimmy said, cleaning up the plates.
“Ivy,” Dean said getting his sister attention, she looked at him tears streaming down her face. “Are you sorry?” He aked, Ivy nodded yes and wiped her eyes with her sleeve and sniffed looking away from both men.
“I'm sure he didn't mean it. The way John treats them, I'm sure he is just trying not to get hurt,” Jimmy replied, “I'm just asking you to try harder, Willow,” he smiled.
"A little, I didn't know she did," Elle said, pointing over her shoulder.
“No way, I watched him die, I remember…. I-I,” Harper shook her head, not wanting to relive the memories she had every night, “No, there's… just no!” she pulled away from Karen. Walking off in the direction she left her bike.
***************
Dean took a deep breath through his nose and blew it out through his mouth, repeating the process until he felt better; he smiled at Cas. He loved that there was no judgment when he had his panic attacks, and his Dom was there to help him through it. Dean told Cas he was fine, ready to go and meet his family.
Stella squeezed Jimmy's hand he reassured her it wasn’t going to hurt, she looked like she didn’t believe him but stayed still.
“Fuck it,” the Alpha finally said, cupping the back of Dean's neck and pulling him into a kiss.
Ivy nodded and took her seat by the window and waited for Dean to come back like she always did. It was past dinner. By the time Dean got to the facility, he rushed through the double doors only to be greeted by the red-headed night nurse with a bad attitude towards him.
Dean didn't reply; he knew the truth of the situation; they hated Blue but would never admit it. Cas called out, asking where something was as he headed into the back to help Cas. It was too long before the staff from the castle showed up, telling Dean and Cas they could leave, and there was leftover breakfast waiting for them. The walk was quiet. Cas didn't say much he thought his family was messed up; he also was surprised to find out that Dean was technically a prince.
“So you locked her in her room?” Dean asked annoyance clear in his voice.
Ivy didn't move when the straps where undone she was fixated on the ceiling eyes un blinking.
"Stella, your puppy needs to go out," Cas said.
”Stelly and I always sleep together, ” Dean said as Jimmy picked her up.
"Stella," Dean said a bit louder.
“Hey, Meg,” the handsome man said, placing a hand on the nurse's shoulder.
”They are adorable Cassie look at her, ” the other man said, walking over to Stella.
“I need you here on time. What did your sister need? Boyfriend problems?’ Gordon asked a teasing tone in his voice.
“I find this strange, Ivy starts opening up. She's writing things down saying your name and then this?” Cas said holding up the box, he rubbed the back of his neck as he set the box down on his desk, “Someone is watching and I think it's the person who hurt her.”
“Why? We will be there,” Dean stated, looking at his boyfriend, raising an eyebrow.
‘You are late,” Gordon said as Dean walked in.
The Alpha let go of Dean's hands, grabbing the hem of the sweater, pushing it up over his head. Dean sat up, pulling it the rest of the way off before laying back down, but Cas had other plans. He pulled the Omega up and off the bed before pushing him down to kneel as he unbuckled his pants, letting them and his boxers fall to pool around his ankles.
Chuck looked around confused, “What are you talking about?” he asked, looking very confused as to why Cas was upset now.
His wing twitching with his annoyance as he turned and faced Cas. “Exactly! It's the dirty little secrete, but now it's out, and I wanna make sure my sister is safe and the baby,” Dean bit out at Cas. he wasn't mad at Cas. He didn't know, and no one prepared the brothers for what could possibly happen. They walked the rest of the way to the bakery in silence; Dean didn't say anything, and Cas didn't ask. He figured it was best to let the topic go.
“No, I don't,” Dean said; he was getting annoyed.
"Stella, got a dog to help her when she is out, so we don't lose her again if she wanders off," Jimmy said, smiling.
“Are you ok?” Marv asked, making a sad face.
“Nope, she won't say or sign anything. Just clams up more. I don't know what to do for her if she won't tell us,” Meg replied; Cas nodded. She was right. If Ivy didn't tell them, there was nothing anyone could do to help.
”Stella, what's wrong? You don't like the doctor?” Jimmy asked, sitting next to her.
Meg check on Ivy one more time before she left, she was still staring at the ceiling. Meg felt horrible she made so much progress today this was going to set her back. She stopped at the nurses station to make sure all the adjustments were made in Ivy’s file. She was allowed the pen as long as she didn't hurt herself and no more restraints. She checked in on Cas before finally clocking out for the night.
John nodded, not saying anything further, turning his attention back to Chuck and the wedding plans. Jimmy walked into the room Willow behind him with her head down, cradling her arm. She peeked up when she heard Jimmy greet Cas, giving him a small smile before joining her brother on the opposite couch. Cas patted Jimmy on the leg nodding for him to follow. He had questions, and asking anyone else would cause problems. Also, he was avoiding Dean. The hybrid was too pretty, and it was making Cas uncomfortable. They left the room telling their mom they would be back. Heading to the backyard, Cas pulled a joint of catnip out of his pocket, sticking it in his mouth and lighting it, taking a drag before handing it to his brother.
Harper and Dean scoffed, “Sam, we have one knife and no other way to kill an Angel,” Harper replied.
Dean was excited to spend the day with Cas alone. They were going to the museum but not the annoying kind of museum, a car museum and Dean loved cars.
Cas followed everyone inside. It was strange how no one said anything at the affectionate eh twins showed each other; he wondered if it was just a thing they did leave over from childhood or if he and his siblings were so dysfunctional that he just thought it was weird.
Stella laid down and looked around while Jimmy peeled the diaper off, ”oh my goodness! Cassie, look at this! She's got a horrible rash. It looks infected, ” Jimmy said, tapping Stella so she would lift her hips.
“Oh,” Ivy said, looking down and sticking her lip out.
"You are up early," Cas said, lift Dean into his seat.
“In my car?” Dean asked.
Dr. Castiel Novak was a big-time psychologist in New York who had his own practice. A loving boyfriend, a truly wonderful Norman Rockwell life, all that came crashing down when he found out that the man he was going to marry was cheating on him with his best friend. Heartbroken and all alone, Castiel moved back to the small town of Lebanon, Kansas, to work at the Lebanon Psychiatric facility; most were in for some kind of psychosis. Cas was extremely interested in the case of Ivy Winchester. She had been there most of her life; she had a twin brother who would visit her daily; she never talked to anyone. Cas was hoping he could change that. He flipped through her file before heading to bed. When they were four, their mother died in a house fire; father couldn't cope dragged the kids around alcoholic would smack the kids around a bit, tell them it was their fault their mother died. At fourteen, Ivy couldn’t take it anymore and slit her wrists. Her brother found her got her help. She stopped talking after. Still, her brother was convinced something else happened to Ivy; she was committed to the facility.
“Is that why you don't like people touching you?” Jimmy asked.
As they entered the elevator, they sighed, hoping it was nothing serious, and their babies were ok.
”Don't worry about your sister, Jimmy will take care of her, and when they finish they will meet us up there,” Cas said, unbuckling Dean from his seat after wiping his hands.
“That’s the one?” Jimmy asked with a big smile. He knew she was going to need a lot of help.
“You'll have to ask him,” Cas said looking at her, he folded his arms across his chest.
“Sounds good, we can work out the details before you leave,” Cas said with a smile.
At least I know where the fuck you are. Samuel, however, I don’t know. His phone is off, and I don’t even know where to start looking for him.
”No, it's not, ” Bela said, holding the bear tight as Dean tried to pull it away.
“Brat! Wait,” Dean yelled.
She had Karen, who was doing her best, but nothing had been the same since the twins had gone to Heaven. Harper stood up, looking up at the water tower before climbing the ladder that was probably a better choice to jump than shooting herself if Sam somehow found her she didn't want that to be the last thing he sees, not that being torn to shreds by a heaven hound wasn't traumatic for him.
“Don't worry, grumpy you are invited too,” Pamela said, winking at Sam while walking away.
"Yes, I wanna mate with you, but we gotta wait," Jimmy said, stepping closer.
“Even if I'm boring?” Cas questioned; it was something he said every time the subject of him not having gifts came up.
“What is going on with you?” Gabriel asked, folding his arms across his chest, waiting for Cas to answer.
He headed back into the bathroom, checking the water before getting in. The warm water felt amazing as the dirt and grime from the night before were spiraled down the drain... Washed up and rinsing off, he didn't want to take too long. Not in the mood to listen to his father complain about taking his sweet time. He turned the water off, grabbed a towel, and brushed his teeth before heading into his room to get dressed. Cas looked in the mirror and smirked before heading back down the stairs.
“I have one too,” Harper said to show her twin her wrist.
“Why did you save my brother?” Harper asked; she wanted to know what was going on.
They both hear the front door open and then hear Cas, "Dean, I asked for the rest of the day off so we can go over to the next town to eat!"
“But you won’t do it.” Gabriel sighed, already knowing Cas’s answer before he verbalized it. “Yeah, I figured I’ll ask anyway. Still, healing your arms is okay?”
Dean watched Cas walk away, scratching the back of his head when he saw him walk back into the grocery store. He was going to go after him but decided to do what he was told and just start the car. Maybe they needed a quick getaway.
room, Cas.”
“I don’t wanna talk about that!”
Nobody can argue with Ellen.
When they broke apart Cas kicked Dean out so he can relieve himself and Dean left telling him to hurry so they can explore the place.
"Me neither." Dean agreed as they pulled away.
Dean shrugged and patted Sam's shoulder when he was done. "I'm excited. A bit...scared."
"What do you want to do, Cas?" Dean asked and Cas didn't expect to be asked as he stood there not knowing what to answer. He knew what people did on their honeymoon but he didn't know Dean well enough to do so, he doesn't trust him enough. Does Dean expect sex?
“No.” Dean turned to catch Cas looking at him still and knew they were both feeling the same excited electricity that clouded the car just by the giddiness in his voice. “Where are you taking me on our, oh um…Oh!
“You’re not bothering anybody, Miracle,” Cas said in his usual voice because, of course, he doesn’t change his tone to talk to animals like a regular person, making Dean embarrassed whenever he catches himself baby talking to her. Cas starts scratching her head as she wags her tail.
It wasn’t even the usual little Cas smile that Dean is used to; it was the soft new one. One where his eyes soften along with crinkles around his eyes. Shit, he only needs to have his chin resting in his hand while sighing to be the epitome of a teenage girl in love in those dumb romcoms they watch so much.
arms on the couch. Dean quickly walked over to pick him up, pressing a kiss to his head while trying not to let guilt eat at him. “Is Dad okay?”
“We’ll get him back, and then you guys can go back to watching trashy tv together.”
The kid was huge, but Dean luckily made it without dropping him. Or his bear.
“Dean.” He looked up towards his kid, who reached for him from
Cas breathed out a laugh.
“Dean,” Cas stops in front of him as they walk on the sidewalk now. “Stop for a second. You’re angry and I'd rather not get in a car with you if you’re just gonna glare at the road the whole time.”
(See the end of the chapter for
El Chacal con la trompeta while everyone chants FUERA! at Dean
“I’m not here to fix you, Dean.” Dean looked up at her, ready to question her because then why the hell was he here for? She smiled at him while she leaned forward as if to tell him a secret. “I’m just here to listen.”
“No, Dean, I couldn’t.”
"Why does it matter?" Cas' eyes finally softening up as he puts his hands on Dean's wrist to pull him away. "As you said, Dean, you can live without me."
“Fuck.” He let his head fall into his arms as his shoulders slumped down, trying to hide his own quiet cries.
Dean walked towards Cas and he looked guilty now. "Sorry, Cas, I wanted to get you some privacy but it doesn't seem to be working. If you want I can kick his ass until he leaves."
They got out of the car as they made their way back to the room. Cas walked behind Dean, his chin resting on Dean’s shoulder as if the closeness was enough to calm him down. A small whine escaped him every few seconds but Dean just let him be. Let him wrap his arms around Dean’s waist and hide his face between Dean’s shoulder blades.
it would be to touch you. Just being around you was enough before, but now all I want is a simple brush of the skin.”
Things were still not okay between all of them - his own relationship with Jack was definitely fucking rocky, to put it nicely - but they were working on it. He…
(See the end of the chapter for
Cas and Sam were much better at this parenting stuff.
Amara put her cup down on the table as she jumped off gracefully to walk over to Jack, bending down to run her hands through his hair and smile down at him.
“Oh, that’s Jack’s. I got him a cookie.”
"I'm coming! I'm coming!" Dean said as he turned off the water and wrapped a towel around his waist. "Keep your panties on."
When John let go, giving a gentle pat on Dean's back and sat beside Jess and Sam out front, Dean just stared at the beautiful blue-eyed man before him. Holy crap he's nervous and usually, he's very smooth but attractive guys always make him much more nervous.
Dean has been pacing their bedroom floor for almost an hour now since they got back. It took a while for Jack to fall asleep as he explained his worries to them, and Dean’s brain has been short-circuiting ever since.
“Yes.” She answered. Looking down at Dean’s grip before taking a step to the side to take Dean’s untouched glass. “But no. Mostly because he wants to be like his Mother. She seems nice. Also, because of Castiel. He’s human now too, and Jack is very much attached to him.”
When he finally found the familiar fabric, he unzipped it and felt around until his hand landed on something small and cold.
They drove back with the music luckily a little lower but Dean just watched Claire drive with a growing smile on his face. He’s gonna have to admit that
“That he can film us any other time that we are not in our room and I will film us,” Dean got out a small camera and held it out to Cas with a big grin. “While we are in our room. It’s more like vlogs. Not like creepy filming.”
cares way too much about the damn world, but he’s also someone who would give up the whole world if it meant keeping you safe.”
The camera guy who has shown up a few hours ago nods and Cas still doesn't feel reassured. He had to sneak out of his home early just in case Michael would have tried to stop him and hide out in the hotel for a while until Alfie has shown up with his tux and coffee. He was getting jumpy the more he waits for when they tell him it’s time but he doesn't know if he wants that time to go faster, slow down, or just stop altogether. He wants to get it over with already and see who they have picked out for him but at the same time, he was nervous. Cas still doesn't understand how he was picked, nobody has ever picked him for anything, but when he got the call he was so excited because they said they may have found someone perfect for him and how can he resist.
He should be the one consoling his boyfriend, but instead, here they were, Cas carefully comforting Dean even though he had no idea what set him off because Dean never got the words out. He was afraid he would never be able to tell Cas how lost he was without him. How scared he was to lose him again because this time, after having him the way he has only dreamt, it’ll be near impossible to come back from.
Sam chuckled. “Can’t promise for Dean.”
Dean woke up to the sound of rain coming from the new noise machine that sat at Cas’s bedside table. His breathing was a little off from the nightmare that was staring, but luckily he woke himself up before it became a big deal. Before he got dragged back into hell. Before he saw his reflection.
She hummed, “‘bout what?”
"The cameras stopped shooting a few months ago. Anything you guys want to add?" The host said and Dean fought the urge to sigh with annoyance and instead sat there looking at the host as he shook his head.
“Has Jack forgiven you?”
“Cas, my head. Someone is calling-”
The sun was setting already, and Dean was sitting on the blanket with Cas, who was grinning from ear to ear because Miracle kept climbing onto his lap whenever Dean would lean over to kiss his boyfriend. His lips landing on her fur instead, and then he’ll have to be quick to block her kisses.
“I don’t know. I’m uncomfortable. I feel too
Cas continued to make little comments as the movie went on.
Dean swallowed hard as his hands nervously squeezed into fists before looking up at Mia. “Yeah. Yeah. I heard I was just…thinking.”
“Dude,” Dean stops and looks at Cas, eyebrows furrowed together while he ignored the heat rising on his face. “Do you just…? Nevermind.”
“Have you tried being nicer to Ivy?” Cas asked. He was sure that it wouldn't matter Ivy was smitten with Jimmy, and it wasn't just because he was nice to her. It wouldn't hurt Ash to stop taking her food and be a little bit nicer to her.
Ivy looked around for the paper and wrote quickly holding it up for Dean to read, “It leaves fewer marks than other rope.”
“And we aren't any closer to knowing what's going on,” Sam said, sighing.
Gabe didn't answer, just grumbled about not wanting his heartbroken again when he found out Dom was more to Blue than just a friend. Dean looked at Cas and shook his head, “Blue and Dom have been best friends for decades trust me when I say my sister does not feel that way about him,” he informed Gabe.
“Ivy was in a group home for a while and that's not in here and a few other things are missing about her history,” Cas informed Meg.
”That was very nice of you to help your sister. Being so little yourself, ” Cas replied. He was trying to figure out how much Dean knew and what age they were at mentally and developmentally.
“I know that look. Sammy has a crush,” Clover stated in a sing-song voice.
“Mr. Crowley,” Dean said walking past the man around the counter to the computer bring up the menu to clock in.
She crawled out as Jimmy stood up, she looked down, Jimmy lifted her chin, so she was looking at him.
They were jerked awake as the create was removed from the truck; Dean pulled his sister close as she looked around wide-eyed, scared of what was to come. Dean soothes her as she tucked her head under his chin.
*******************************************
Dean looked at the man in surprise, “Thanks for that,” he said, slamming the Angel killing knife through the man's heart.
“It will be ok; Jimmy's not gonna run off with our TV’s. I think Ivy is good for him,” Dean smiled, pulling Cas into a hug.
”Daddy, is Stelly sick?” Dean asked as Cas got him redressed.
“What is that?” Harper asked, leaning forward from the back seat.
The screen went black, prompting those who wanted to stick around and see more of the show to enter their credit information. He sighed and hit enter, making sure he added in a tip.
“I think that's my dad,” Dean groaned from the back seat. He hand hoped that he would have a day to prepare for John's arrival maybe hide all the booze in the house, but it didn't look like that was going to happen.
The man nodded and turned his attention to Cas, “Dean Winchester,” he said, holding out his hand. Castiel stared at him for a few seconds until Meg nudged him, making him jump.
Stella looked around at the room; there was a poster of the inner ear and a bunch of doctors stuff.
“Really?” Dean asked, looking to his Dom.
“What? Why are you asking that?” Dean replied, coughing a bit after choking on his coffee.
Ivy took a deep breath looking at his hands, she didn't try to move them up or touch her she looked up at his blue eyes caring and encouraging. She opened her mouth to try and say something but nothing came out, Ivy shook her head frustrated that she couldn't tell them what she wanted.
Stella shook her head and sucked hard in her pacifier. What if her dad got mad, and she got a spanking for the bear, and he never let her have another one?
“I don't really know. She just giggled; that was the end of it,” Cas replied with a small laugh.
Dean explains that they all play together to get social skills, and that boy smelled similar to Stella, so Dean knew he was their little brother.
“Not long, about half hour,” Cas replied looking down at the girl.
“Did you text Sammy? Is he coming?” Clover asked, sniffing, then wiping her nose on the sleeve of her sweater.
Sam was walking out of the bathroom; his hair wet from the shower, when he stopped and spotted Dean and Harper; they smiled, saying hey as they walked into the room.
“That’s ok. We can always figure things out,” Becky said, “if you wanna say bye, I’ll be over here when you finish.”
Cas called for them to come in, it was Jo she peeked her head in, “Ivy is awake,” she said standing back so Ivy could walk in she ran to Dean throwing her arms around his neck.
Sam sighed, looking at his older sister, her violet eyes blazing bright for a split second before returning to normal; it was something that happened when she was annoyed. He didn't know what to say. It hurt to see that she had been looking for him, and she couldn't reach him, “H, I had no clue you were back. If I had known, I swear I would have found you, Sam told her.
“Don't mention it,” Sam said with a smirk.
“Um, tonight my buddy Benny is gonna come by with me to see Ivy,” Dean informed Cas stepping further into the office.
”It's going to be ok, ” Jimmy said as Stella tried to get out of her seat but stopped, she saw food.
”I don't think so, ” Jimmy said, looking, Stella. She laid her head on Dean’s shoulder, looking miserable.
Harper's violet eyes flashed a bright purple for a second, “I'm frustrated I wanted to see if you got anything,” she replied; she brushed her silver hair out of her face and looked at Karen, waiting for an answer.
“Touched by Death,” Castiel mused and let go of Harper's hand.
“Not never?” Jimmy asked; he was surprised she had never had someone be gentle with her.
“I'm pissed! Something could have happened to you! You can't keep sneaking off like that!” Charlie scolded while folding her arms across her chest. Yup, she was clearly mad.
“Ok you’ll learn we can get you into speech therapy, We will get you stuff to help so you can tell us what you need,” Jimmy said. Happy, they figure out what was bothering her.
******************
“This is too much. I can't eat all of this,” Cas said, looking down at the amount of food Dean was giving him.
Ivy told Cas that she would take a nap; looking at Jimmy, she asked if he wanted to cuddle with her. Jimmy was surprised, turning to his brother for answers. Cas shrugged and said it was fine with him. Ivy smiled, leading Jimmy out of the room and down the hall.
Ivy nodded Dean grabbed her hand and squeezed.They watched Ivy leave the room shoulder slumped she did feel bad she never hit anyone just to beat them but Marv struck a nerve.
Marv nodded and headed back down the hall mumbeling about how he was right.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Come on just a little,” Ash said in an attempt to get Jimmy to use it.
They walked past the living room and into the kitchen it was huge, a short brunette woman was walking around the kitchen.
“I know, I haven't had Jimmy in my house since he stole my TV,” Cas told Dean.
“He didn’t hear you. Again,” Dean commanded, looking down at his sister with a pointed look. He had a good foot on her, but she was feisty.
The man sighed, ”that's not what the website said, ” he replied.
“Cas!” he whispered, taking the boy’s hand in his own.
”Stella is a good girl I promise; I teach her all kinds of stuff, ” Dean said he was proud of what he did for his sister trying to teach her all the things he had to learn on his own.
“What the hell?” Harper asked, annoyed that Dean was lying to Sam. it wasn't the first time and wouldn't be the last, but still she felt like Sam should be a part of whatever it was that Dean had planned
“I invited Tony; you remember him, the one I told you about Castiel,” Naomi said as she got a drink from the cart.
“If it isn't the candy maker,” Cas snapped back. His brother made his millions coming up with new candy flavors.
“No, Cas, um-go find something to do. I'll be out soon,” Dean yelled back before sticking his face under the water.
“Come on,” Jimmy said, picking Stella up, he grabbed her bag and jacket from the cubby.
”How would anyone let her get this bad?” The doctor asked, shaking his head, knowing where they came from he had seen another Omega with similar signs of neglect he would check with Cas and Jimmy to make sure.
“It's not our fault. She was the one that kept going,” Harper said, folding her arms across her chest while leaning back in her chair.
“It's an iPod jack,” Sam replied, looking at his siblings.
“Daddy, why can’t we stay with you?” Dean asked, looking at the floor. He was scared that the person running the daycare was going to be mean like the caregiver they had before.
Salem was close by, saying whatever he didn't eat, he could take home unless he was planning on drinking, then he was staying. Cas looked at her like she was crazy. There was no way he would stay the night where he would sleep; he couldn't be around Dean too much. The pull to be close was too strong at times; it was terrifying.
“I know, I'm sorry, I'm just scared.” Ivy wrote down tears in her eyes as she looked at her brother.
Cas shook his head and started laughing. There was no way. Alfie nodded, showing Cas the date on his phone; taking the phone, he attempted to remember what happened. Alfie asked again if Cas was alright; the man nodded, heading over to the couch to sit down, handing Alfie back his phone as he passed him. “You don't have to stay; I'm feeling much better now,” Cas said robotically, not looking at Alfie. He was shocked at the loss of two days.
“You are a fucking cheater Benjamine Layfette,” Salem shouted, pointing to the man sitting across from her.
“What's in Pontiac?” Harper asked, pulling away from her brother.
“Cas, you can take my spot; I'm going to get the food out of the oven,” Salem said, getting up from her seat.
“This is Castiel, Jimmy's twin. This is John,” his father introduced, stepping to the side to show a figure that was standing behind him who was dressed to the nines, a typical businessman.
Goodbye.
“Hey um.. I just want to tell you I'd be back,” Dean said, stepping just over the threshold.
A new message popped up, stating that the creator wanted to know if he was interested in joining a private room.
“Have you heard anything from Dad?” Ivy had been wanting to ask about him but she wasn't sure how Dean would take it.
“Dean and Harper Winchester, out of the fire and back into the frying pan,” Pamela remarked, stepping back and telling them to come on in so they would get things ready.
Since I got back, I have been writing to you every day, telling you what I have been up to since you've been gone. Ha! Gone? Like We didn't sell your soul. You left me all alone, Asshole! Not that I expected to come back alone.
Jimmy carried her to the bathroom; she looked at him, wide-eyed in terror, squirming in his arms.
“I met him this morning and his sister, ” Cas informed Charlie.
“If it isn't the dog catcher,” Gabriel teased, taking a sip of his drink.
”Stelly doesn't talk how is she going to call for anyone to help her? ” Dean said, frowning he didn't want her to get into trouble for not following the rules; he protected her.
“Ok, thanks,” Ash said scratching his head as he was walking away.
“Ivy, you can't hit people” Dean said she looked up at him, she let air out through her nose in frustration.
The silence in the room was deafening as Dean sipped his coffee. He glanced up at the robot who stood unmoving and unblinking. It made his skin crawl and made the blood rush south, confusing the hell out of him.
“Ok, ok, stop!” Dean said, waving a hand-cut the bot off mid-sentence, “I wanna go back to sleep. I'm going to bed, it's my day off.” he added grumpily as he walked back down the hall to the master bedroom.
“Love too,” Ivy said, waiting for him to leave.
*************************************
“What happened?” Cas asked, worried something had upset her.
"Daddy, how come Stelly and Daddy Jimmy didn't come with us?" Dean asked from the backseat as they pulled out of the driveway.
“She was what?” Dean yelled into to the phone. There was no wy Cas was telling him this. There was some kind of mistake.
Dean knelt in front of the man and looked up, “I wanna know why you didn't tell me? I told you about my mom,” he said softly.
“Dean? Do you require my assistance? I am waterproof,” Cas voice informed through the door.
“What?” Jimmy whispered back, annoyed.
Ivy giggled. The whole room stopped talking and looked over at their table, Ivy hid her face in Benny’s arm. She didn't like being the center of attention.
“Hi!” Dean said with a small wave.
************
“I won't be here next week, and I was hoping that I could get the assignments,” Dean asked, shifting his weight from side to side.
“Mr. Novak, I am sorry this happened. I was I on the phone with a client,” Becky said, hoping he wasn’t pulling her.
They both looked at him like they had no idea what he was talking about; Dean reminded them that they had a name, Castiel.
Cas looked John up and down before setting the bag down and shaking his hand; from what Dean had told him; John was an ok parent after his mother died a functioning alcoholic, he didn't like him withhold affection from a Sub even one's own child was deplorable in Cas’ eyes.
Cas sat there staring at the door. Well, at least he didn't have to worry about the feelings not being mutual.
”Thank you for telling me, I’ll change you when we get inside, ” Cas said, turning the car off and opening his door.
“Go work, see later,” Ivy dismissed him with a wave of her hand.
“Ok, come on, we gotta put the cream on,” Jimmy said, picking her up.
The nurse left, saying the doctor would be in shortly. It didn't take long for the doctor to come in, he did his exam ran his tests and finally came back telling Jimmy that Stella had damage to the auditory nerve and hearing aids may help, and it was a good start on getting her the dog in case the aids aren't helpful.
“Oh,” Cas says looking between him and Charlie.
“He’s right,” Dean said too quickly. He cleared his throat and started driving. “I just think you should change it up every once in a while.”
Sam reached down to kiss her forehead before kissing her lips. “Yeah, that sounds great. We could eat it at
“Dean? Have you seen Jack? He’s not in his-.” Cas walked into the room with a doggy bag in his grip while he stopped short when Dean shushed him.
“Our kid is crying cause he’s stuck in the wrong body. How the hell are we supposed to help him, Cas?” Cas was sitting at the edge of the bed, only watching Dean with defeated shoulders. Yeah, Dean knew Cas had no answers but talking out loud was helping him vent. “That’s his body! It’s not a damn vessel like — it’s not a vessel, right?”
“I’m scared.” He told himself, not being able to admit that fear out loud.
“I wanna grow a beard!”
Cas looked at him with soft, warm eyes, a small smile tugging on the side of his lip. “I’m fine. How are you?”
“Cas?” He answered Dean with a soft hum. “Me estas gustando mas cada segundo.”
“I’m keeping them asleep.” She easily answered and made a glass of scotch appear in her hand. “I wanna talk. Alone.”
“Do that.” Dean quickly answered as they stopped in front of the store’s doors. Dean looked down at their hands. “Just keep holding it.”
He didn’t want to pressure her to talk—she would probably lie if he did—but still, he wanted to ease the tension between
“I don’t know who that is.” Jack picked up the cup with the hand Cas wasn’t crushing and put the cup to his mouth as he looked at Dean with a confused look.
Dean blinked a couple more times to focus on Cas and noticed how he was fully dressed—wearing some sweatpants and a plain white shirt under one of Dean’s plaid shirts. Dean wiped his eyes with the back of his hand after he tucked the gun back in his waistband.
Dean didn’t know how to use his words as well as Cas, but he instead reached to pull Cas into a tight hug. Falling into him as his eyes closed when he was flooded with warmth and comfort because Cas was right. Touching was starting to feel different between them, and it was scary, but it wasn’t stopping them. Not anymore, at least. Before he pulled away, he left another peck at Cas’s temple.
Jack was left on rescue duties so he just escorted the hostages out of the nest while Sam drove the group away in a van to the nearest hospital. Jack went along to poof Sam back home before they were questioned.
They were both stiff at first but eventually, Cas relaxed against him, his head resting softly against Dean’s shoulder while Dean continued to read about the magical journey that Cas has watched the movie for but never read before.
"Sorry." He mumbles and pins his arms to his side so he wouldn't move them but then he looked up to see the smiling faces of the family who was sitting across from his own. A lot of the seats were filled and Cas was jealous. "Hello."
As soon as the tracking started back up on Jack, Dean raced off to go get him. Go get them.
They both sat up when Cas pulled out a small shiny gift bag with a Christmas tree right out front. Dean wondered when Cas even had time to get this or sneak it in as he sat crisscross back on the couch while Cas copied him. Handing over the present with a wry smile.
Dean quickly pulled Cas into a tight hug knowing his boyfriend responded more with physical touch than words. It took a couple of seconds before Cas relaxed into the embrace, his hands slowly trailing up Dean’s back until they rested to grip on his shirt.
Bobby came over; just when Dean was getting in the shower, with Ellen and Jo right behind him arguing about leaving Ash in charge for the day and if it’s a good or bad idea. Dean stayed in the shower longer than he expected, mostly because he just stood there arguing to himself to just run away screaming but his curiosity on how his fiancé may look or how they may think of him won.
“Dean.”
“It’s strange.” Cas teased before he took the cart and started pushing it forward again.
“But you had Sam. Jack.”
Dean took a peek at Jack with the mirror and then watched as
“She was only trying to protect her own kid.” Cas sighed, always so understanding. Dean hated it. He was too mad, worried, to be understanding. “Jack doesn’t look like the four-year-old he is. Seeing a grown man in a playground playing with children doesn’t look so good.”
Dean cleared his throat before opening his car door. “Um, okay, I’ll just-”
Dean flipped his brother off as Cas kept him pressed against the wall kissing him with a whine and need for more. If death wasn’t looming over them then Dean would have let Cas do whatever he wanted but right now Dean had to be the one to push away. To stop whatever was happening and he hated himself each and every time but Cas’s bloodshot eyes reminded him that this was not Cas. Well, not Cas’s action at least. He didn’t want this and Dean had to draw a line somewhere or he’ll make himself believe that he could have this even after Cas was all better.
“Why did you kiss me then? If it’s not a goodbye kiss.” Cas’s alien but adorable slight tilt of the head made a welcoming appearance that made him smile. “Was it a mistake?”
Dean continued to trim Cas’s beard, not bothering to show Cas how to do it himself because he wanted to always do it for him. Have this nice peaceful moment for the rest of his life.
Jack looked back at him with brows pulled together and a slight frown. “That’s who you
“Taste better when you do it.” Just as Dean walked down the kitchen steps, Cas reached to take his hand, pulling him back. “Can I also ask for a hug?”
walked out of the front door—his trust in him really was lacking—and Claire decided that dealing with Dean was much easier than having to talk to
Dean watched as Cas fidgeted with the necklace. He looked down on the ground and shook his head, “I don’t want to hear it.”
are. Ready to move on with life. Ready to put someone else in front of each other.
“Yeah! Dude, guess what Kevin did today?”
“Seven is…perfecto.” Cas flinched at his Spanish, but Dean couldn’t help but chuckle.
“Yeah. Yeah. So if I bought you clothes you would just wear them?”
“Thanks for waiting, kid. Where we going?” Dean buckled up just in time for Claire to slam the breaks. Unfortunately, he hit his head on the front dash because the damn seat was scooted forward, his knees were practically pressed against his chest, which made sense knowing a tiny
Claire drove with loud rocker girl music vibrating the windows and didn’t stop until she finally parked outside some ice cream shop.
Dean took it, pressing the phone between his ear and shoulder before holding his arms out so Jack can jump into them.
“It’s okay.” She waved her hand up to stop him. “I-I get it. I mean, it’s not, but whatever.”
Dean makes it back to Cas, who automatically reaches for the drinks to help, and motions for him to walk back to the car.
“All of that for a damn tongue on a pole?” Cas sounded so annoyed that Dean spits out his beer laughing.
was trying very hard to keep his tone even, which only made Claire angrier.
“You deserve an explanation I know, Dean.”
“Yup.” Was all Dean said as he handed Cas a beer and pressed play.
“You okay, Cas?”
Failing Cas once again.
“Cas?” They hear Jack call for him, and the only reason Cas even looked up was that Amara has been calling him by his full name. “Dad, I’m fine.”
“What? No! No, Cas you’re fine. Better than fine actually.”
So Jack went to help settle things back down in the big empty and hopefully, fuck, please dear god please, will come back with Cas by his side. Jack had been complaining that the Empty makes him not only powerless in there but also tiers him out. So they would have to go look for them if - no,
“Cas.” Dean practically beams at him even though he was trying to stay cool. Smooth. “Mi Angelito.” Dean winks, and he doesn’t miss Cas’s eyes widened and ears blushing at the nickname. “How you been?”
When they walked into the motel room they found Cas in the same spot where they left him. Dean had tucked him into one of the beds and there he slept, something an angel really shouldn’t be doing, while Dean let the worry eat at him.
John patted Dean's shoulder and that made Dean look up at him. John gave him a small smile. "I wouldn't miss my son getting married. I want to remember your special day. No matter how...strange this may be."
“I know that, but I want to. Talk, I mean. If that’s okay with you.” Cas looks at Dean with soft, warm eyes, a drastic difference from the red-rimmed eyes from the last time they saw each other. “After you’re done with work, of course.”
This question is thrown at him in replacement of a greeting so often now that Castiel knew it would haunt him in the future. Simple words were spoken so easily by others, and yet it leaves Cas flinching while a cold dread runs through his body.
(See the end of the chapter for
And yeah. That was it. That was all it took.
Having a kid running around the bunker is something they all have to get used to.
Dean lifted his arm up and Cas quickly tucked himself underneath it. Reaching to cling on to him as he took deep shaky breaths.
“You know me.” Dean shrugged while he tried to give his best smile. “I’m always-”
Dean stuffed his hand in his jacket pocket. He’s fine. Not like he was ever the touchy-feeling or public display of affection kinda person anyway. Like Cas said before, they were more comfortable in private.
They both called out to her until they looked to where she ran or who she ran to.
“So, it’s just you that hasn’t forgiven yourself.”
Dean never thought he would be here in this situation with a guy, but he has never wanted anything more in his life. Feeling strong hands run through his hair as a strong and firm body pressed against him. He loved the intoxicating smell of Cas’s woodsy shampoo that he would have never smelled on a girl. The stubble of beard rubbed against his chin as Cas turned his head until finally, fucking finally, he had those pink lips on his.
“You ready to go, Angelito?” Dean looked Cas over; he’s dressed in dark jeans and a grey long sleeve. He has never seen Cas in anything but that rumpled old suit. He never minded the suit, but now he wished he could burn it because all that suit did was hide Cas’s muscled body. Dean couldn’t stop the whistle that escaped his lips as he said, “Mira! You look good, Cas.”
Dean watched him walk away, unable to figure out words to stop or comfort the kid when he was so close to falling apart himself. He knew they were both feeling guilty for being so unaware of Cas’s pain. Realizing that what they saw before didn’t even scratch the surface of the old mind of this multidimensional creature turned man.
“Alright fine!” Dean grabbed Cas’s tie and pulled his lips towards his own instead. He smashed their lips together into a hard kiss. Lips tight against the other that it almost felt uncomfortable but just when Dean was about to pull away, Cas chased after him.
Cas rolled his eyes and sighs, “Most likely.”
“Dean!” The little voice grabbed his attention and then focused on the little face that pouted at him. Dean sucked in a breath as he took his son’s — holy shit, this is his son now — face in his hands and squished his little cheeks together. His light brown hair curled around his face, and blue eyes still so wide, still filled with so much curiosity and knowledge, started back at him with a knowing glance.
“You don’t understand. I’m happy, Gabriel. Even right now, while trapped in this human hospital and stuck in this weak body, I don’t think I have ever been happier.”
As soon as he was inside Ellen pushed him out. "Nope! Get in your car and heat her up. As soon as your damn father finds the tie I bought him we are leaving!"
. I may not have my strength, but I will-”
“Don’t kiss him,” Dean whispers to Cas who nodded once before he went to lay down on the bed. He curled in on himself as he closed his eyes, clearly still in pain.
He repeated it over and over again like broken sobs.
“I’m...I’m sorry, Charlie.” Dean covered his face in his hands as he let out a huff. “I thought I saw an old friend come in here.”
Tell me what you thought of the last chapter! Please! If you hated it that's dope too just let me know!
"Cookies and milk? Really Dean?"
Cas looked up at him and his baby blues widened. “Dean?”
“Dude, I said no.”
“You’re…you’re done? You can’t be done!”
“I missed you too, Cas.”
“Yeah.”
Dean was left speechless for a moment too long. By the time he forced himself to move again the car was already disappearing around the corner. He had no chance to catch it.
"Nice to meet you guys." Dean said shaking their hands but not letting go of Cas own. "Thanks for being here."
Cas doesn’t come out to see him the next day or the day after that, and now he has to wait until next week to see him. If Cas still wanted to see him.
Ivy continued to rock back and forth, she ignored him. “Ok we can wait, I'm gonna go. I'll come and check back on you in a little bit,” he said getting up off the floor. Sometimes it was best to just let people come to you and not force anything. Cas went to his office to call Dean he hated to interrupt his work day but this was important.
“Hey, I'm happy you came,” Salem smiled, shuffling the cards.
“No, fair,” Salem pouted before she nipped Dean on the face.
Cas took a bite of the steak in front of him, the sweet and savory flavors bursting to life on his tongue. He sighed as he closed his eyes, taking another bit; this was not regular steak from a cow. It was different, more game-like in flavor. He opened his eyes, looking around the table. Everyone was engrossed with eating, not saying much. He felt someone watching him; looking to the right, Salem gave him a soft smile.
“I need to touch something it touched,” Pamela said, reaching under the table.
It looked like he would be carrying both of them back to the car.
“Um, can I ask why Ivy laughed at you?” Dean questioned, remembering he wanted to ask that before he hung up.
“Yeah, I ask for her pudding. She says no now, but still, I wanted to sit with them watch TV; Ivy got up and left,” Ash said, throwing his hand up in the air.
“I guess I should go; I'll see ya tomorrow,” Dean said, licking the fork one last time before tossing it in the wastebasket next to Cas’s desk; leaving Cas office, he left the door open.
“What can I do for you?’ Cas asked, noticing the concerned look on the man's face.
Cas nodded, “Thank you’ Cas said pulling out her file and making a note.
“I will do it right now,” Dean responded by pulling out his phone and shooting a text to their younger brother.
“Is this about Dom? I thought you and Blue made up?” Dean asked, sitting down at the table with three cups setting one in front of each of them.
Stella was lying with her head in Jimmy's lap dozing off; Jimmy said he was going to take her to bed.
She looked at him; no one had called her smart before she likes it.
”It's ok, I know she didn't mean it, you want me to help? I'm Benny, ” he said.
***********************
Harper moved to the side as Sam attacked Dean Karen grabbed him, “It's them, it's them,” Karen said, doing her best to keep the giant man restrained.
Dean nodded, bring Cas’s hand up and kissing it.
“Wren, dear girl, what do you have now?” Rowena asked her Scottish accent thick as she watched the trio enter the room.
“So Dean, we’re getting married,” Cas said casually.
“Nah man she's in a psychiatric facility, she tried to kill herself when we were kids,” Dean said grabbing the towel and started wiping down the counter. He didn't look at Gordon it wasn't often he told people about his personal problems but he also didn't want people to think badly of his sister.
Benny shut the car door and headed in. Dean waited to make sure he got in alright and headed home himself.He was tired when he walked into his apartment but also so happy that Ivy made a lot of progress today; she just needed someone she was comfortable with. Hopefully, Cas saw that and continued to help her out. Not trying to force her like all the others, Dean's phone pulled him from his thoughts he was surprised to see the hospital's name scroll across his screen.
Cas smiled and nodded, “I have some notes to write so I wonder be able to entertain you,” he said chuckling a bit at his bad joke.
“We feel your pain,” Dean said, holding up a bra he spotted peeking out of the couch cushion.
Cas just smiled, he was going to make Dean wait, as much as he would love to take the boy right then and there. He moved his hand, trailing a finger up his taint to the tiny cock between the Omegas legs, wrapping his hand around it. Moving it painfully slow as Dean squirmed for more friction.
"No! No, it's not that at all Dean." Cas reassured him as he blinked and came back to life somehow. "I just can't believe I- we got married. It's so bizarre."
Cas turned back to look at Dean, eyes soft and a warm half-smile. “Can I… Can I ask for a kiss?” Cas cleared his throat before he looked back down at the ground. “I’ve seen Eileen and Sam give each other goodbye kisses, and I was just wondering if I could - if we could also, maybe, try that sometime?”
Dean swallowed before he nodded, grabbing the duffle from Cas’s grasp so he could carry them both. “I’m right behind you.”
Cas woke up that morning looking like he took a walk in the rain and grasping at his neck before he quickly got out of bed at 3 a.m. to take a hot shower. When he didn’t come back to bed, Dean went looking for him and found him passed out in the tub, head thrown back uncomfortably, and the smell of lavender faintly in the air.
Jack has been gone for only a few hours but Cas, fuck, he’s been gone for 11 days now. They have been trying to get him back using spells, Jack’s new God mojo, and even once Dean considered ending it hoping the new reaper will follow through with Billie’s promise to dump him into the Empty. At least Cas would not have been alone in there. But it wasn’t a guaranteed plan and his kid needed him alive more than ever, with the big promotion and all that world-saving mess that tingles through him.
Nothing like father and son bonding over lack of sleep.
“Are we gonna play a game?”
“With his powers, nobody can really hurt him. Not anymore.”
Dean saw Cas try to reach for him with his bandaged hands but winced as pain probably shot through him. Dean carefully laid his hand softly on top of his. They are working on a spell to heal him hopefully, but Rowena was busy running Hell to answer her phone. Still, Sam says he could probably get it done in a few days. They have to hunt down some ingredients.
“Stay with us, Daddy.” He hears Claire say and Dean shakes his head because that’s not his daughter. He doesn’t have a daughter. Claire is just learning to accept Cas. Claire is with...Jody.
He took a quick picture, sending it to Eileen to inform her that he was free for dinner, and closed the door while he thought about his girlfriend. He wanted to stay here because Cas and Jack have been dealing with a lot, and he didn’t want Dean to deal with that alone, but maybe…maybe it’s time for him to start his own life too.
Dean and Cas finally use their words. And sometimes it's too late. Sometimes it's just the relief of just knowing that makes someone truly happy.
“Only kisses. Until we can get rid of this spell and then you…you can tell me what you really want.”
Cas is healing up in the hospital but him and Dean still need to heal emotionally. Special Appearance from favorite brother. The Hurt and Comfort they needed.
Still, he had to do it once.
“Ditto, kid.”
“Yes.”
Dean thought about it for a second. “No. I mean, I was at first. That asshole got himself killed over and over again. Leaving me alone.”
“Es mucho?” Dean lifted his arm to smell himself. “It’s fine!”
"Shall we get started?" Dean turned towards the minister that he didn't even notice was even there and nodded as he pulled his hand away from Cas. "You can run out now."
"I didn't think you were going to be so-"
“Yes. He just fears you.”
The fishing trip was longer than he thought, but it was a nice distraction from his Mia session. He can only talk about his fear of becoming his Dad or even becoming his Mom, for so long.
“No.”
Dean wasn’t telling Cas until it was a sure-fire plan, but he didn’t want Cas to remember this painful time. He already has enough to deal with without visible scars to remind him.
Cas smiled as his hands loosed around Dean’s shoulders before they fell to his side. “Okay.”
tw self harm. Dean finds Castiel in the kitchen in distress and panic. Dean realizes again that he doesn’t know what Cas is really going through as a new human.
“I don’t know what I expected. I’m just glad you came, Dean.”
“I did, but google translate did most of the work.”
“Then that settles that! Let’s go to the store.” Dean reached for his jacket but Cas grabbed his shirt to pull him back.
When they did stop kissing Dean got up and left the bed, stretching as he went to talk to the camera guy. Cas laid there watching them, well watching his husband’s great back muscles, and the next thing he knew the camera guy left. Cas sat up confused as he watched Dean go through his carryon bag and take out that small bathroom bag he had.
“Dean,” Cas reached over to gently touch his arm as if knowing that Dean’s mind had wandered off. He looked hesitant, as if not sure if he was allowed to. “Do you want to go eat? We can if you want.”
“Yeah.” Dean was standing by the oven while looking over his shoulder. Keeping his hands busy by making breakfast, and soon Sam will be here so they can figure this all out. “You didn’t look like a newborn either.”
When the last vamp head rolled on the ground Dean groaned as he stretched his hand out for a high five from Cas. Cas quickly high five him as he was always quick to humor Dean with small things because Cas knew it was the small things that meant a lot to Dean.
Wow. Wow. Wow.
Dean hears his name, expecting it but still feeling relief from hearing it. He looks ahead, his fingers stopped ringing the bells that have become background noise to him by now, and sees his favorite customer running out of the big white house Dean can only ever dream of renting. He wouldn’t ever dream of owning; he can’t have dreams so impossible.
“Merry Christmas, Cas.” Dean said when they pulled apart to breathe, their foreheads touching.
“We have this arrangement now.”
“Did you just...You said you loved me and then you left.” Dean couldn’t stop the shakiness in his voice. “That’s a really fucked up way to mess with someone, Cas.”
Now he had to add Cas to the list of what if's. He doesn't think Cas ate enough in the plane even though he said he wasn't hungry. He was already worrying about the guy who he hasn't known for a day. But he was his husband so it made sense.
The compliment was shocking to them both, for Dean especially. He awkwardly cleared his throat while trying to think of an excuse. Maybe even use the whole English as a second language excuse, but Cas quietly responded with a, “Thanks, Dean. You look pretty good yourself.”
Rowena left a few minutes later and Sam got ready for bed while Dean decided he’ll sleep on the small couch, mostly because he knew he wasn’t going to get a wink of sleep. Afraid Cas would wake up and just leave without a goodbye again. Disappear for days on end without Dean knowing what the hell is going to happen between them. If they are going to remain friends then Dean had to know now before he let his damn heart hope for more.
“I know!” Dean puts his drink down and holds tight to the vial as he glares back at her. “I fucking know what I fucking did, and I have no damn excuse! Okay? I was a shit wannabe Dad, and I deserve the fact that the kid hates me!”
He fell back against his bed again and hoped for more sleep but his hope vanished when he heard loud knocks at his bedroom door. "Dean! Dean! Wake up! Are you still sleeping?!"
“Hello, Mr. and Mr. Novak, who do we have here?” The blonde girl asked with a lot of enthusiasm.
“Ignore Dean; he’s just mad,” Willow stated, taking a sip of her drink to hide her smirk.
“I guess... but no more talking like that. Mama and Daddy were talking like that when we were little. They ended up taking Dean away for some time. So we don't talk like that anymore,” Clover stated, playing with the end of her hair as she talked to Cas.
John shook his head to shake off what had just happened and went back to talking to Chuck, who sat beside him. This whole arrangement was a good investment in John’s mind; he didn't have to worry about the bloodlines since the Novaks “were of good breeding,” as he put it. Cas looked to his brother, who shrugged while eating his food. He wasn't sure what to think. It was weird for everyone involved.
“Grampa, you in here?” Dean called out as he pushed open the heavy wooden door.
Dean and Harper looked at each other. They weren't sure what to say. Their whole lives, Demons were the good guys, the ones who guided humans, Angels were the assholes possessing people tricking them into doing their dirty work.
Dean nodded, following Cas taking a deep breath, knowing his father would be there the following day, hoping that he didn't do anything to embarrass him.
“I'm hungry,” Ivy wrote down holding up the paper.
Charlie is amazing as always
“I know I'm your friend, but I…” Ivy covered Jimmy's mouth with her hand cutting off what he was going to say.
Harper sat down, her legs dangling from the ledge, remembering one of the many times their mother had dropped them off at Karen's while she went on a hunt, the three siblings would head out on adventures pretending to kill the things their mother told them about having no clue exactly how playing would turn into fruition. She and Sam would race to the top while Dean stayed at the bottom, yelling that they would get themselves killed if they didn't get down. She smiled, thinking about how easy it was when their mom wasn't around; they knew what to take care of Sam. It was simple, but now Harper didn't know where she fit, was she a hunter, was she a good sister unable to help either one of her brothers Dean stuck in Heaven being tortured, Sam off doing God knows what. She took another swig as the sky turned dark blue and the stars began to twinkle; Harper smiled, thinking about when she was a child looking up at the stars thinking the Demons who lived up in the sky watched over them at they were protected, she stopped believing the day she brought a dead animal back to life just by touching it. Her mother got angry, yelling that she was a weirdo and never did anything like that again. If Harper could help it, all she did was touch it.
“I got the biggest room, but other than that, no,” Cas replied, looking out the window.
“Ivy?” Jimmy asked as they walked into her room.
"You have to name her," Jimmy said, smiling.
“Might be your gain,” Pamela smirked.
He made sure he had everything he needed by his bed so he wouldn't miss anything. Fake slick, a towel, and a bottle of water for afterward, he always seemed to be parched after. He made himself more comfortable as the black screen showed the nest the Omega used to start his show. The camera was always angled not to show his face. He longed to know who was making him hard, but he had a pretty thing in his English class he could use to replace the faceless person on the screen.
“If you’re asking if I got fired with no evidence... then the answer is yes. And I feel horrible about it,” Cas answered, finishing his beer.
“What are you humming?” Cas asked curiously.
A huge smile spread across Dean's face. This was the first time Cas had said they were boyfriends; he shook Gabriel's hand, saying it was nice to meet him, and he was excited to meet the rest of the family. Gabriel nodded, saying they were excited to meet Dean too. He was the first Sub to take Cas completely off the market, Gabriel said, looking over his shoulder at Dean as they walked to the parking garage.
Jimmy hand found some pacifiers they had bought but never used; he gave one to Stella, thinking he would get some custom made for her and the other to Dean. In case Dean needed something to suck on when he was tired or stressed beside his thumb.
Cas looked at Jimmy, ”she was kind, ” Jimmy said, holding the door open as Cas pushed the stroller in. Jimmy walked up to the counter handing over the prescription explain he had only had her for half a day and asking if there was anything else he could do for her.
Harper took a deep breath as she looked over the field as the sunset-colored the sky a beautiful shade of orange and purple. She had been back for a month. She didn't know why or how she could not find her younger brother every time she got a lock on him, he would leave town. It was like something was keeping them apart. Harper looked at the bottle of whiskey in one hand and the pistol in the other, unsure of what she would do without her family.
”Cas, I'm so sorry. That’s where your brother got his Omega, and he is exceptional. Healthy, talks, everything, ” He replied, ”are you sure she can't talk, and she's not playing the part?”
"Dean, you don't have to shout at Stella all the time," Cas said, looking at the two of them.
“Oh yeah, best friends those two,” Dean replied stepping just shy of Cas’ desk not knowing what else to say but not wanting to leave just yet.
“Come Iv, you gotta give us something,” Dean said
Ivy shook her head squeezing herself tighter into a ball, there was no way he knew, and if he did he would be like all the others. She didn't want to hear what he had to say about what he thought he knew.
“Oh fuck,” the boy's voice rang out over the speakers as he turned to show the camera he was cumming.
He made his way into the front room, greeting his mother quietly while John and Chuck talked about the best date for them to set the wedding; he looked around, noticing Jimmy and Willow were missing. Dean was sitting on the couch with his head down, ignoring everyone.
"Her name is Belle. How do you two talk when I'm not here?" Dean asked as Cas strapped him into his high chair.
Benny was tall and muscular with light brown hair and blue eyes wearing overalls and a pair of velcro shoes.
Cas told Dean to climb in with his sister but don't wake her and take a little rest; Dean did as he climbed in without protest, Stella stirred, scooting closer to Dean.
Cas made his way into the front room, Jimmy calling after him; he did not have it; it was bad enough that they didn't have a choice, but Dean was barely legal. How long have they been eighteen? Did they wait until they turned eighteen to inform Cas and Jimmy they were getting married? He had a ton of questions, he stormed up to Chuck.
They were finally called back, Stella patted her leg, and Belle followed next to Stella stopping when she did.
After thanking his driver, he took a deep breath blowing it out, knowing they would set a date for the upcoming nuptials. This was not where Cas wanted to be; he wanted to be in his apartment getting ready with Jimmy to go for the night. He made his way into the house, listening to find out where everyone was, the living room.
“I said No,” Jimmy said, turning away from Ash.
“I told you to take care of her, not douche her up,” Dean snapped back crankily.
“Master, how may I serve you,” the robot greeted Dean in a husky voice.
Ivy nodded and gave him a soft smile to let him know that she would be.
Dean scoffed at the audacity, saying he would rather die than eat that tofu crap he was always trying to get the twins to eat. Clover walked in at that moment as Sam was about to reply. Instead, he turned to greet his sister.
“It's a small town; my dad owns a farm,” Cas replied, turning his attention back to his book.
Cas sat back, letting them work it out; he wasn't going to say anything unless it escalated, but even then, it wasn't that bad.
“I didn't realize how much Blue does,” Mary sighed as Dean helped behind the counter filling orders.
She shook her head, "we share everything, why not the puppy, you have to help me train her, and give her a name," Stella said, smiling.
She nodded “promise,” Ivy wrote smiling. She was going to work on telling Cas what happened ot her but she was terrified they would do something to Dean.
AGAIN TRIGGER WARNING, TURN BACK NOW, YOU CAN SKIP THE LAST HALF OF THE CHAPTER.
“Yes, of course, I'll go with you. I was just about to go check on Ivy,” Cas said getting up from behind his desk making sure he had the keys.
“That is for you to write down all those thought you got going on in that head of yours. If you want to,” Dean said ruffling her hair.
“I'm just asking,” Dean said with a laugh.
“I just came by to say hey. I will be late tonight,” Dean addressed Cas.
”Well, keeping her dry will help; was she potty trained at any point?” the pharmacist asked.
Dean, who was born, first learned almost everything from watching the man assigned to take care of them. Dean learned to speak, how to read a little bit. Stella never spoke. Dean always answered for her, and no one corrected it, she did grunt and point to communicate, Stella was able to make small letter sounds like “D” for Dean. She mostly babbled like a baby.
They made an appointment to come back and get Stella fitted for the aids, and hopefully, it would help her a bit.
On the way home, Cas stopped at a fast-food place for them to eat, remembering that Elle had the night off to visit her son.
Dean agreed but only if Ivy kept up her end of the deal otherwise he would say no, Ivy nodded and wrote down that she would do the best she could. After dinner, Dean hung around Cas went back to his office to complete some work he needed to finish. Dean played a game of cards with Ivy. She kept making kissy faces at him the whole time. ,
“Thank you for my new stuff,” Ivy wrote down.
"Daddy, she's beautiful," Dean said in awe, looking at the black in front of him.
Cas nodded as he tried not to breathe in too deep and make the Omega uncomfortable. At the same time, he grabbed the assignment sheet and handed it over to Dean.
“I didn't do anything; I tried no Angel would deal. You both were stuck in Heaven for months, months, and there was nothing I could do,” Sam yelled back on the verge of tears.
“I missed you too,” Dean said, looking down at his sister when she didn't let go.
”She is adorable, Jimmy, but this is pure neglect, she should at the very least be able to feed herself,” Elle said not in a mean way but a concerned way.
Jimmy nodded and pulled his file.
“Who's Jesse?” Dean asked, spotting Pamela's tattoo.
"For what?" she signed back.
Cas smiled and knelt down closer to her level. She was so small... He wondered how old they were. He could ask Jimmy later; he gently tilted her head up by hooking a finger under her chin, “It's a lot to take in, as I'm sure you know, but I'm not upset with Dean, ok?” he replied honestly, giving a small smile assurance.
Stella took Elles hand and wiped her eyes with the other hand getting up on the table, the door opened, and Jimmy walked in.
“Why?” Cas asked, he was confused about why telling Marv that he would talk to Ivy would cause any problems.
“Your Daddy can fix it. I’m sure he can,” Benny said, rubbing her back.
sometimes my autocorrect changes then to than and I miss it when editing
They carried the twins up to the nursery; Jimmy said he was going to give Stella a quick bath since she needed a change in the first place.
“No, I don't think so, I think he just, I don't know man. His different his whole approach with her is just different,” Dean said as Benny handed him a plate of pancakes and bacon
Dean turned and looked at his sister; Karen shook her head from behind Harper, telling him to let it go. There was no point in fighting with her about this.
“Ok, Friday, you'll go home with Cas and Jimmy, but I'll be home when I get off work,” Dean reminded Ivy.
“Your family have a thing for wolves?” Cas asked, pointing to the window.
‘Come sit,” Cas said pointing to the chairs when Ivy let go of Dean and looked at him, “Tell me who sent this. Do you know?”
Cas pulled down the gravel driveway in awe of the large amount of property they had. The lawn was perfectly manicured; the house was a one-level ranch style. He wondered if all the siblings lived there or if it was only Dean and Salem. He parked behind the other cars, turning off the engine he took a steadying breath, grabbing the bottle, getting out of the car he could hear laughing coming from the back of the house as he walked up, wondering if he should head back there or go through the house, he sent a text to Dean who popped his head from around the corned waving Cas to come to the back of the house.
“What the fuck?” Gabe questioned, “Is this a joke?”
“We can ask them maybe they like it, and something happened, Benny is in there, and his always nice to the others,” Jimmy replied, hoping for the best.
”Not yet, we don't know the rules, ” Dean replied, she nodded and put her head down.
“No, no way,” Jimmy said. He went to reach for her hand, she allowed it was lacing their fingers together, “How old?” he asked looking at their fingers interlocked, he looked at Ivy when she didn't answer right away.
She shook her head and pointed to what she wrote, “Ok” he said letting her leave with her stuff and the paper and pen.
“It wants me to back off, reveal yourself,” Pamela said.
Dean was surprised at how cheap it was to sign up, and even better, he got to custom pick his date. He was always attracted to men and women, so he opted for a man as his virtual date. It seemed simple enough, building the person, Dean took a deep breath as the options for hair color popped up. He scrolled through, choosing ebony without thinking and moving on to the eye color. Dean wasn't sure about what would be the right color in the list of premade ones. Luckily he saw the custom icon and clicked on it. When the man was finally satisfied with the shade of blue Dean wanted, he moved on to all the other things he wanted. He did find it strange why a virtual date would need self-lubrication and a vibrating option, but Dean thought what the hell couldn't hurt.
“Are you sure?” Dean asked, not wanting Cas to committee so something that he wasn't sure about.
“Ok, you can come and sit with me if you get too sad,” Marv replied as he walked away.
“Then you’re human. I will still love you, and so will Wren,” Dean answered firmly, sitting up so he could turn to lay on his side and admire his boyfriend.
Ivy was writing something down and showed it to Dean, he slumped his shoulders and shook his head, “You know you can't until you get better,” he said a tone of sadness in his voice.
“Holy…” Cas said, looking around as he followed Dean to find the king.
Dean nodded and took Cas's hand as they walked to the gift shop. Dean spotted and model of the Impala asking Cas if he could get it, Cas said if he was sure, that's what Dean wanted, then Dean could get it or anything he wanted.
"I think that ship sailed a long time ago."
“I mean, only if you want to-”
"Dean!" Sam yelled as he knocked at the bathroom door. "Dean! Hurry up will you! We have to get there before noon!"
“Ugh, Dean. Dean, kiss me.” Cas groaned from the back seat of the Impala while they were parked outside the motel. Sam was on the phone in the passenger seat with Rowena, who Dean could hear laughing while Sam fought back a smile.
“Dean?” Dean turned to look back at Cas, humming in response. Cas looked at him for a solid three seconds before shaking his head and looking away. “Never mind. Have a safe trip.”
Dean walked into the hospital room carrying two duffles, mostly filled with clothes and stuff Cas may like and some hex bags for protection. Lucky for him his little brother is dabbling more into witchcraft and can successfully make them a charm too.
“I do miss him. And Scooby, of course.”
Dean watched as her face twisted into confusion, understanding, and then settling into anger.
His hands hovered over Dean’s face, and it wasn’t until he tried to answer Cas back that he realized he couldn’t. His chest tightened up, and the lump in his throat was making itself known. He was crying.
Soon it was time for pictures and luckily Cas was just as uncomfortable as Dean was. They started with family pictures and separate picture but then it came down to just the two of them.
Cas was surprised by the gesture and simply nodded. Dean took the next extra steps before he took Cas waist and pulled him for a kiss. Cas was surprised by the tug but as soon as Dean's lips touched his own he melted into them. It was a short and sweet kiss. Cas was unsure of what to do with his hands but then Dean pulled away, with a small wink, before Cas decided. Dean’s fingers laced with his own as he then leads the way out of the ceremony area and back into the hall while there family's clapped beside them.
"May I present to you Mr. And Mr. Winchester! You may now kiss your husband." The minister said and Cas froze up for a second. How could he forget that he was supposed to kiss this stranger? Well he already married him so...
“You said it back.”
Then he has to go face Cas the next day.
Dean pulls away from Cas and stands up looking around for whoever was calling him but there was nobody. His head was starting to hurt as if pressure was building up inside it.
“As long as it’s not so spicy, I don’t mind anything.”
That was the only response he knew he was going to get from his angel - oh wow! Not his. Not even a damn angel anymore.
“Oh,” Dean sat up not remembering when he finished breakfast but his plate was empty. He pulled Jo in for a hug. “Merry Christmas brat.”
"Goodnight Dean."
He still wasn’t sure if he was going to apply. Not yet anyway. Not with two new humans in his family with fucked up heads and sleep schedules.
Dean laughed, more like an awkward chuckle, as he nodded. "Yeah. I know."
This time his voice was filled with more relief as he quickly covered Dean’s hand with one of his own. Dean can only nod at him, not trusting his voice, before taking his free hand to run down the side of Cas’s face.
Jack usually had nightmares at night, and while sometimes he stared out into space with wide, knowing eyes, he was usually fine. Mia even said that Jack was opening up more in his last few sessions. She never went into detail, of course, but this did reassure them that he was doing better, but right now, he looked like he had a nightmare while being wide awake.
Felt inspired to finish this yesterday so here you go!

The whole gang went for the vamp nest, while it was easier with Jack and Cas being there they still got a little beat up. Cas got blood on his new shirt and he looked annoyed more about that than when a vamp jumped on his back.
“Why not? You told me it would be great for me to do this! Why can’t you seek the same help?”
“Cas!” Dean took Cas’s arms and turned him away from the steaming hot water. Just touching it for a brief second stung his skin. Dean looked down to see Cas still holding the steel wool sponge tightly in his fist. “Drop it, Cas! Let it go!”
“Rejection? If you would have given me some damn time to process then you would have known that I loved you too!”
Dean se esta enamorando and Cas is all cute.
“Glad our bathroom is so big.” Dean sighed as he continued working on Cas while Jack walked to stand close beside Dean to watch what he was doing.
Thanks for reading.
“So we went out to buy him a new car. Plus all our arguments were stupid and easily fixed.”
Cas’s fingers stopped just over Dean’s lips, and he carefully reached to kiss them, wishing that for once in his life, he could heal instead of harm.
“Dean?” Cas sounded concerned as he sat up, pushing himself closer to Dean until he was sitting at the edge of the bed, his legs already touching the ground, ready to stand up. “What’s wrong?”
Cas nodded, his hand reaching over to gently cup Dean’s face at first before his hand traveled to the back of Dean’s neck. Before Dean’s head can catch up to what Cas was doing, Cas stretched his neck to bring their mouths together. Falling back into their bed kissing until they both passed out curled around each other.
Dean took a step forward towards Cas and gave him a small reassuring smile. "May I?"
Dean finally broke away from the staring contest as he cleared his throat to get off his bike. “Todavia quieres-Do you still want your raspado?”
happening, he could feel the room start to close in.
Dean rolled his eyes, his tongue poking at his cheek because he knew what Cas would say. He has memorized those words already and, still, he isn’t sure if he deserved to hear them. When Dean didn’t look at him, he felt Cas’s hand reach to cup his cheek gently, and Dean sighed, letting his hand fall into the rough hand, before covering it with one of his own.
“Oh? I was just in your room, Dean.”
"But I always kept setting you up with people. Cas must think I hate him!"
They both chuckled before finally pulling away when Sam called out for Cas.
“Give him his grace back.” Dean shoves the vial at her while feeling bile rise his throat.
“All that matters is that it was good for you,” Cas tells them as he stands to pick up his clothes from the motel floor. When he’s fully dressed again, he holds his hand out for the rest of the payment, already planning the bus route to the motel across town where they had a bathtub.
“Jack, hug your Dad before he spirals.” Cas took Jack from Dean with a glare but no heat behind it. How can you be mad or annoyed when the cutest four-year-old was hugging you with all his little strength and showering you with tiny kisses.
Dean sighed and sat up again. "I'm up you freak!" He got up and opened his bedroom door to see Sam grinning at him. Dean couldn't help to smile back.
Before Dean could really let panic set into his chest, he heard Sam call out to him. Dean was running, pushing the corn stalks out of the way, in the direction of Sam’s voice. When he finally pushed the last plant out of his view, he almost fell from the flattened stalk that circled around two unconscious bodies sitting on either side of the crop circle. Sam was already kneeling beside Jack who was laying on his stomach and groaning in pain. He’s alive!
. And now I-I don’t,” She looked around the room. It was quiet as everyone watched the interaction before her eyes landed on a little Jack in
“They will come around but I rather enjoy Dean’s family even more. They were very kind and welcoming.” Cas looked down as he answered and Dean moved closer before he let go of Cas hand and wrapped it around his shoulders to pull him in closer. Cas smiled but leaned in closer to Dean. “Plus, I very much enjoyed this man.”
Cas pulled back just enough for Dean to really look at him. “I love you.”
Jack shook his head, ready to turn and leave again. “It’s fine. I’ll just wait for Cas to come home.”
“What?”
“She sent a list of stuff she wants you to cook her instead.” Sam laughed, and Dean was about to open his mouth to complain, but he heard some muffled laughter from the back seat.
Dean’s side gigs included selling his homemade food Friday through Sunday—he can almost call himself a caterer—while on Thursday, he preps during the day and works as a janitor in a big law office at night. Today was Thursday, so Dean had to wake up early to go to the big marketplace downtown. They sold the chicharrones de harina in bulk for cheap, and they had all the ingredients he’ll need to make the syrups for the raspados himself.
“No...No, I think I’m awake now.” Dean said before leaning closer to capture Cas lips with his own. Cas tasted like peppermint and his lips were soft but chapped. Dean has been dreaming of kissing Cas for so long and now he’s married to him and can kiss him whenever he wanted. This wasn’t a dream. This was real. He could feel Cas heat and his fingers running under his sweater giving Dean chills. This was real.
“I mean I think so but-”
Cas looked at him confused and Dean is starting to like that eye squint look before he nodded and followed Dean's lead out of the airport. When they were outside they pretty much were told what car to take. A few crew members were already there and one traded off with another and they had a different man ride in the taxi ride over to the hotel. Dean and Cas sat in the back with the camera on them but they both ignored it and looked out the window.
“Vampire nest, Dean.”
“Jack’s human now.”
"I'm leaving now! Call me if you need me to pick up dinner after work." Cas says as he waves and closes the door behind him. Dean waves back before getting up to grab a beer and grab the snacks Cas though were perfectly hidden but Dean always replaced them.
“Dean, we can't,” Cas said, grabbing the Omegas hand and holding on.
“Sometimes the other patients like to go to Ivy cuz she doesn't talk, it's peaceful but Ash he kept bugging her about the box. Well Marv got up set and attacked Ash,” Jo answered Dean's question.
Cas looked at him with so much anger and regretted that it silenced them both. Dean slept in the deancave that night. Well, sleeping was putting it nicely. He spent the whole night staring at the television’s black screen and just playing back what just happened—remembering those cold eyes as they yelled at him to get out.
“Then try listening to me!”
"I wouldn't mind taking your name, Dean." Cas tells him and Dean grins grows bigger and his eyes have small crinkles on the side of them that Cas wanted to reach out to smooth them out but restrained himself.
“Dean?”
“Victor.” Victor raised an eyebrow at him but reached over to shake Cas’s hand in response. “What can I get you and the pendejo around you?”
“The last real Christmas I had - I was three, Cas.” Dean opened the trunk of the Impala to start stuffing the bags. “Plus, I’m pretty sure that I imagine all those happy memories I had with my Mom and Dad.”
"I have this friend who-" Sam started but Dean was already shaking his head.
He turns towards the door as he calls out, “It’s open!” Knowing it couldn’t be Cas or Eileen who went out early this morning for something Eileen wouldn’t say. Sam knocks usually aren’t so soft, so that left Jack.
It started off slow, sweet, and that was enough to jump-start his heart. When Cas started to pull away Dean chased his lips again. Softly biting down on Cas’s lower lip to hear that soft gasp and finally be able to taste Cas. It wasn’t just a dream anymore. Cas was in his arms and he was pressed hard against him while his tongue was exploring Dean’s mouth.
“Yeah,” Dean pulled back and looked down at her. “Well, you had Jody.
Sam and Jack were looking at the grocery list, walking ahead of them a few steps, and when they were far enough away, Dean leaned into Cas’s space. More than he already was.
Leaving Dean alone.
“Sorry, I shouldn’t have said anything. It’s just gonna make it awkward.” Dean stops in front of his car not wanting to turn to look at Cas. “You can fly home. I’ll meet you there in a few.”
As soon as Cas opened the door, Dean felt so sure that there was nothing more right than having Cas sitting in his passenger side.
spent the rest of the night watching his kids getting along, looking the happiest Dean had seen him in a really long time.
I have also been asking questions and help for this fic so join the discussion when you can.
"Dean I can carry my own bags." Cas said as he walked beside Dean. Cas was only dragging along his wheeled luggage bag, bright pink and easy to spot, while Dean carried both of Cas carryon bags while trying to balance his own.
“I am. I’m jealous.”
An old conversation kept echoing in his head, and he kept hearing Cas’s voice repeat the words,
“I’m sure some were real, Dean.” Cas placed the last of the bags in the trunk as he looked at him with a small smile. Pity smile. “You’re Mother loved you so I’m sure she would have done her best to give you-”
“If you say fine, Dean, I will strangle you.”
“What? What?” Dean rolled off the couch with his fingers already reaching for his gun, even if he was half asleep. “What’s wrong?”
Dean hummed in response as he sat up straighter, reaching for his coffee to have his hands do something. “We can do that.”
Cas rolled his eyes as he smiled. "Discussion then."
“Dean!” Sam quickly passes him in a huff of embarrassment while Dean laughed, following Sam back to the car to get more groceries.
Now, tell me what do you think of Mick? :D
“Then it should’ve been you! You should’ve died! Not him!” Dean flinched at the words that have been echoing in his head since that night. “It’s not fair!”
