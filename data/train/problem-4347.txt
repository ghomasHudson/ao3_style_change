Charlie took this moment to put her bag by her feet as she sat next to the Persona. She rubbed her hand on his back in an attempt to bring some comfort. Castiel added, “Dean does a better job at hiding it.”
And this wassn’t to say he hadn’t experienced loss and disasters before. Any personification had at one point or another. But there were factors to how acute the pain would manifest in said Persona. If at all, he’s not entirely sure how his kind works. Well, no one was completely sure but that’s a story for another day.
Charlie quickly returned her gaze to the screen to type out a message before she got up immediately from her chair. She was already in full alert mode. Sure she would’ve liked to have more time to play Overwatch, but the long-term mission had always been her priority. And she was grateful that her online friends understood that. They all wanted King Sam, or Hellboy as she liked to call him, taken down at all costs. Her video games would sadly have to wait.
Which meant Castiel wasn’t sure what to expect. And it was all the more compounded by the fact that this Earth wasn’t set up to have Personifications. Or at least that was what they gathered. Thus, all he could do was make an educated guess. Oh, what they would give for a book or a manual on how Personas work, at least then they would have something to base their theories on.
She only spoke up when it didn’t look like Castiel was going to follow up on the unspoken but. Castiel however beat her to it, “...but ever since we got here, me and Dean haven’t been feeling well.” As if his body decided to take that as a cue to emphasize the point, he let out a pained groan.
It was unprecedented to say the least.
In that situation, a State or a Municipality, or whatever subsection they were called, would also feel discomfort but to a lesser degree. And City Personas like him even less so. And even then it’s all depending on the situation. It's not black and white, nothing ever is. Something big and newsworthy can happen in Illinois and he can go on about his day without any sort of discomfort. But if a disaster was felt globally, even those lowest on the personification Totem pole would feel it.
There were a few rapid knocks on her door and Charlie jumped out of her skin before she quickly let out an apology into her headset. She had been engrossed in the middle of a session playing Overwatch. She took it off and put it on the table just as Castiel opened the door with a sense of urgency.
Anyways, it really all came down to how large a land they represented. They wouldn’t start to feel anything until it was happening within their own border. Their own section of the population that they represent against the big world. It was a trickle down deal to make sure there wasn’t any overlap. A Nation would feel the effects of any disaster more acutely due to a much larger section of humanity in their house to speak. Their citizens would be spread across many cities and subsections big and small within.
It wasn’t much, just a small simple two-story house that was settled nicely in between other cookie cutter homes. But it was enough to set up their homebase for the time being. Until they have to move again, and given how fucked everything is with this world, that might as well be the next day. You would think the neighborhood here would be more full of life, so to speak, families having dinner, kids playing and whatever people do to be deemed normal.
“What, why? What happened?!” Charlie questioned as she ran over to grab her bag, her voice tense. Sam and Dean had gone out on a food and supply run. That had been about almost three hours ago.
Oh, how it would make things easier if he was an angel like his counterpart. Or just fully human instead of the paradox that he was. Correction, the paradox he and Dean’s kind were. In fact, when you got down to it, they were happy Sam wasn’t a Persona. For one thing, Sam has more freedom in what he wants to do, he can be more relatively independent and doesn't have to answer to a boss.
Castiel continued, even amidst an unexpected momentary surge of pain, “Or at least me since there’s nobody in Pontiac to represent. Logically that means I shouldn’t feel anything…” Castiel trailed off for a second as he kept his attention on Charlie. She had just slung the duffel bag over her shoulder when she turned around to face him, a curious look settled on her face.
“He said he’ll explain once he gets here.” Castiel explained as he pushed himself off and shuffled over to the edge of the bed and sat down. He wanted to catch his breath, his legs began to feel like jelly, all wobbly and close to collapse at any moment. Or at least that’s what it felt like. He wanted some relief, that's all, and while he was thankful that it wasn’t getting any worse, he knew getting better was a whole new level of complexity compared to someone like Charlie, or even Crowley.
However, there was a key factor in all of this. The human population was never whittled down to just a few camps around the world. However, many of the towns, villages and whatnot in this world were either abandoned or taken over by monsters. It was a vastly different story.
“I’m not entirely sure given the circumstances. Theoretically, me and Dean should’ve returned back to being fully human,” Castiel began as Charlie double checked to make sure she hadn’t forgotten anything important. Wouldn’t be good in this world to leave any weapon behind.
No matter how much she wants to geek out about it, overthrowing the Boy King was more important than ‘holy fucking shit there’s a world where actual personifications of different countries exists’. The world needs saving before she can properly do that. Unlike the Becky Rosens of the internet - and real life - she had her priorities dead straight and knew when to not overstep any boundaries.
And then he feels it.
“With Aretha.” Wait - what? Bobby mumbles, “Thought she’d have better taste.”
Several people have retired for the day and the sun is beginning to shine through the window above the booth that he, Cas, and Bobby are sharing, reflecting the shadows of hours well spent through the empty beer bottles on the table. Ellen has dropped off a final round for the day, some cold El Sols, dad’s favorite. The three click the bottles together and take a drink.
“Rufus lives about 5 miles that way.” Bobby points into the distance. Dean looks and thinks he might see smoke from a chimney in the distance. “With Aretha.” Wait - what?
“And your mom and dad?”
Dean’s pretty sure his question is clear in his eyes and she smiles, knowingly. She nods her head toward the door to the backroom.
Images immediately flash through his mind - no.
Dean realizes.
“before he went...wherever...made some changes here.”
than that.
Dean smiles back - all bitterness having melted away. “Thanks Jack.” he says in a voice no human would be able to hear from the distance they are between them. “I’m proud of you kid.”
Of course Jack was here and of course he made changes. Jack would have hated the walls in heaven - it’s too lonely. Not enough family. Not enough room for love. That sounds plausible. Maybe this really was Bobby.
“Yep.” a gruff, familiar voice says.
Dean is suddenly on guard again. “Yeah it is,” Great. Turns out he’s in some new version of hell - or the angels really did hate him enough to torture him even in heaven. Those dicks were probably looking on and laughing at him now. “Cuz last I heard you -” or not you really, but the Bobby that whatever this thing was was emulating “- you were in heaven’s lockup.”
Inside, the Roadhouse is filled with life and laughter. Dean can’t believe what he’s seeing and scans the room to take it all in, a smile rising on his face. Bobby gives Dean’s neck one last squeeze and goes to sit at a table with his wife Karen who is enjoying a conversation with Missouri Moseley. Behind the bar, Ellen and Jo are serving drinks alongside Pamela Barnes. Pamela looks up and notices Dean enter and winks, through healthy, non-burnt eyes.
“No.” Dean huffs a laugh that Bobby echoes. “It’s crap.” Dean smiles, “But it was fantastic.”
He turns around to find the source. On a hilltop overlooking the Roadhouse he sees them.
“Busted my ass out. And then he… well… he set some things right.” Bobby nods. “Tore down all the walls up here.”
Dean looks out the window for a moment and Bobby and Cas return to conversation. He sees the trees and the hills, sees friends stumbling back home for the night, and he knows that this is good. And then he sees her in the parking lot - his Baby, long black lines stark against the golden sky.
And then Garth squeezes the daylight out of Dean and he’s gathered into the welcoming arms of his family.
Inside, the Roadhouse is filled with life and laughter. Dean can’t believe what he’s seeing and scans the room to take it all in, a smile rising on his face. Bobby gives Dean’s neck one last squeeze and goes to sit at a table with his wife Karen who is enjoying a conversation with Missouri Moseley.
Dean huffs out a disbelieving laugh. “I love you, Cas.”
He notices Kevin and his mother engaged in a serious conversation with Dean’s brother Adam. All three have become hardened versions of who they were when they’d first met, but in this bar they also appear quite at ease and content. Dean thinks the three might have a lot to gain in friendship with each other.
“Amara?”
At the corner of the bar, Ash flips his mullet, now reaching down past his waist and cracks some quip funny enough that Garth throws his whole body back to laugh, jostling his wife who has her arm around his shoulders. Their kids are running and giggling around the room, which clearly irritates the table where Ketch, Toni, and Mick are all looking much too civilized for the space they occupied. Bela Talbot makes her way over the table with a round of pints for the group.
In a corner of the room he sees Hannah and Anael engaged in quiet conversation and has a bit of a panicked moment. Hannah is the first to see Dean and she immediately looks anywhere but where he is. Ana looks up to see what has caused this much awkwardness in her friend when she also sees Dean. She smiles and gives Dean a small wave. He nods shortly and gives a brisk smile, the discomfort of old flames meeting one another hanging heavy in the air. But soon, what he’s seeing finally catches up with him.
At one of the long tables in the room sits a horde of Ghostfacers, all excitedly arguing about if pink Himalayan salt was a better protection against specters than iodized table salt. An amused looking Jesse and Cesar Cuevas sit at their table, a horse-riding helmet hanging off the back of Cesar’s chair.
Bobby stands and moves to the door to the roadhouse, beckoning for Dean to stand too. When he does Bobby slaps a hand on Dean’s back and uses his other hand to open the screen door and reach for the door knob. Dean realizes he can hear the muted bars of a classic rock song - is that Zeppelin? Of course it is.
But soon, what he’s seeing finally catches up with him.
He knows. He hopes it's soon but also he doesn’t. Sam deserves to live a long happy life. It’s what Dean’s always wanted for him.
“When Jack...He pulled me out of the Empty before the walls came down - I had to… I had to leave my grace behind Dean.” Cas looks at Dean expectantly, begging him to understand.
Dean looks away for a moment and then back to Cas, nodding slightly. He knows. He hopes it's soon but also he doesn’t. Sam deserves to live a long happy life. It’s what Dean’s always wanted for him.
Dean turns to look at him - it sounded too good to be true really. Which never ends well for Dean. But Chuck is gone. That could have changed heaven in some way. Maybe Bobby being in lockup had been Chuck’s story.
So I also finished writing this chapter really late and realized I wrote in the new Destiel scenes into a copy of an earlier draft so there’s some mistakes in here for the moment. I’ll be back to edit them ASAP, but be patient with this one for now.
And Dean was always more a man of action than words anyway.
Dean smiles back - all bitterness having melted away. “Thanks Jack.” he says in a voice no human would be able to hear considering the distance they have between them. “I’m proud of you kid.”
Bobby catches his eye and waits as Dean processes this information. When Dean finally meets his eye, he sees Bobby’s smile. “It ain’t just heaven Dean. It’s the heaven you deserve.”
Jack.
He drives until he comes to a bridge in the forest. For some reason, he knows he should stop here. He shuts off the engine, and steps out of the car.
Cas understands, “Dean. He’ll be along.”
In a moment of pure indulgence, Dean’s eyes rest on the back seat, imagining. His eyes flit back to the roadhouse for a second, before he reconsiders. Another time.
It’s as if she’s broken some kind of seal, and the entire roadhouse erupts with noise. Dean feels a tug at his arm, and he breaks his gaze with Cas to look out across the room and their family. In the split second before he is completely torn away to a parade of hugs and slaps on the back, Dean’s eyes flicker back to meet Becky’s. Her laptop has been closed and she is packing it away. A grin splits across her face and Dean laughs freely. Thank you - he realizes he means. And then Garth pulls Dean into a hug and he’s gathered into the arms of his family.
Dean’s thrown. This was not the answer he expected.
Cas’ eyes squint harder and Dean returns a pointed look. Cas’ eyes dart around the room, finally resting on Benny and Aaron and Ash, even Crowley, none of whom seem surprised by what they just witnessed. His gaze returns to Dean, who raises his eyebrows and lets his face speak for him.
Dean is already half-way across the room, sliding by tables and pushing around empty chairs, when Castiel turns around, a plate of apple pie in hand. He only notices Dean when he’s 6 feet in front of him.
Anyway, I had a blast with this one. Clear Destiel in this one friends.
Dean looks around at the bar, at the family that remains around the room, at the people around the table with him, and he nods his agreement. Cas has a quizzical look on his face, but Dean slaps his back reassuringly and lets his hand rest on Cas’s neck.
Dean slides himself out of the booth.
Dean hmm’d, and decided he might as well listen and see what happens. What are they gonna do, kill him again? He grabs a chair as Bobby continues to tell him about Jack.
Dean’s heart stops. He thinks of his family - his friends - all separated far too soon. Everyone together, Bobby had said. And the walls? His hope starts to piece together in his chest against his wishes. Surely, he couldn’t mean - blue and tan flit across his minds’ eye. But the black goo that engulfs it dashes any hope he had growing within him.
Dean knows the second it dawns on Cas.
Dean opens the car door, waves a hand in Jack’s direction, and slides into the driver’s seat. He takes a minute just to feel the feeling of being in his car before he turns on the tape deck. The opening bars of Kansas float through the air.
Bobby stands and moves to the door to the roadhouse, beckoning for Dean to stand too. Dean stands and Bobby slaps a hand on Dean’s back. Bobby opens the screen door and puts his hand on the door knob. Dean realizes he can hear the muted bars of a classic rock song - is that Zeppelin? Of course it is.
“Dean. I’m not a,” Cas exhales a large breath, “being of celestial intent. Not anymore. You don’t have to...”
And there is peace.
Well Dean can’t argue there.
Ok, so this one is more of a best case scenario, wishful thinking sort of thing. Think of it as like, the finale if Bobo got to write it instead.
“Everyone happy.” Bobby continues and Dean fights a smile. He never got to have what made him happy on earth. Maybe now he might... - no, he can’t let himself hope. Not to have it ripped away from right in front of him. Not again. Not like this. Dean knows what to expect when it comes to good things.
Bobby continues, “That kid of yours,”
The surprise fades from Cas’ face and it melts and leaves only joy in its wake. “Hello, Dean.”
Dean’s brow furrowed with suspicion - he didn’t expect to see Bobby. He knew Bobby was a better father than his real father to him and Sam, but it didn’t feel right that Bobby would be his soulmate. He must be a memory.
coming back to you," are unspoken but loud.
In a corner of the room he sees Hannah and Anael engaged in quiet conversation and has a bit of a panicked moment. Hannah is the first to see Dean and she immediately looks anywhere but where he is. Ana looks up to see what has caused this much awkwardness in her friend when she also sees Dean. She smiles and gives Dean a small wave. He nods shortly and gives a brisk smile, the discomfort of seeing old flames meeting each other hanging heavy in the air.
The three share a look. “Just like this.” Bobby says.
He takes a moment just to feel the feeling of being behind the wheel before he turns on the tape deck. The opening bars of Kansas float through the air.
Angels who died. Here. In heaven. When Bobby said Jack tore down the walls, he couldn’t have meant - did Jack tear down
“We’ve been waiting for ya.” Bobby says, and he pushes the door open.
Dean feels everything slide into place. He’s lighter than he’s ever felt - what Cas said back in the bunker's dungeon was true and here it was laid out in front of him so he can't ignore it. He won't ignore it. Good things
“This is high quality beer?” Cas asks.
His curiosity begins to grow and he looks closer at the rest of the people in the crowd. He sees Meg and Gabriel in a corner booth, sitting on either side of a very terrified, very flustered looking Samandriel. Meg and Gabriel glare at each other and the mildly threatening flirtatious energy from the table radiates across the bar. Dean does not envy Samandriel in the slightest and is a bit concerned for all their safety, really.
Dean has to acknowledge how crazy his family really is when he sees Hell’s royalty has come to visit in this new heaven, sitting together at a table sharing a cup of tea. He’s glad to see that Crowley and Rowena have found some kind of common ground and managed to work something out long enough for a conversation. Though he’s a bit surprised to see Crowley here really. Didn't ever think he'd be the heaven kind of guy.
The surprise fades from Cas’ face and it melts and leaves only joy in its wake. “Hello, Dean.”
Cas’ eyes widen and his face opens brightly. “Dean - ”
He drives until he comes to a bridge in the forest. And for some reason, he feels he should stop here.
He notices Kevin and his mother engaged in a serious conversation with Dean’s brother Adam. All three have become hardened versions of who they were when they’d first met, but in this bar they also appear quite at ease and content. Dean thinks the three might have a lot to gain in friendship with each other.
He shuts off the engine, and steps out of the car.
“Everyone happy.” Bobby continues and Dean fights a smile that begins to form. He never got to have what made him happy on earth. Maybe now he might... - no, he can’t let himself hope. Not to have it ripped away from right in front of him. Not again. Not like this. Dean knows what to expect when it comes to good things.
Dean moves his hand up to cup the side of Cas’ face. Cas is surprised by the gesture, squinting his eyes slightly as he works out what it is Dean is saying. “Cas, since when have I only liked women?”
“And your mom and dad?” Dean stops - Mom and Dad were here? Together? I mean, he should have known, he knows, everyone together would obviously mean them too, but - no, that’s too good to be true. He’s speechless. He’s wanted this for more years than he can remember. His parents, actually together, no countdown to midnight in sight. And he can just go visit them whenever he wants.
Jack lowers his hand and smiles wide.
Dean’s heart freezes for a moment when he sees the people at the neighboring table are Lisa Braeden & Ben. Ben looks up at Dean, noticing he’s entered the bar. He squints, as if he is trying to place where he might know Dean from, before he goes back to enjoying one of Ellen’s home-cooked meals together. He asks for the ketchup from the blonde across the table. She turns her head to look for the bottle, and it knocks the wind out of Dean when he recognizes her as Jess.
Bullshit. He wanted to have this.
“Dean freaking Winchester!” someone calls out from the bar.
“Oh.” Cas says. He’s still processing but a hopeful smile begins to grow on his face.
Figures, he had just started to believe that wasn’t true back on earth. To believe he might actually deserve something more than a lifetime on his own. He’s not exactly surprised - but it still hurts to come face to face with the universe confirming his worst thoughts.
Dean opens the car door, waves a hand in Jack’s direction, and slides into the driver’s seat.
“What memory is this?” Dean asks.
But Dean’s hand on Cas’ shoulder stops whatever Cas intended to say. Dean meets his eyes and grins, his voice coming out with a whisper, “Hey, Cas.”
Dean realizes.
Angels who died. Here. In heaven.
It’s in this quiet moment that he feels a weird pulling sensation inside of him - one he’s felt before.
the walls? Dean's eyes flicker frantically around the room, searching. Who he finds is not who he’s looking for.
“What memory is this?” Dean asks.
She finds Cas at the table and slides into Dean’s empty seat. Cas smiles when he sees her, and introduces her to Bobby.
He pats Cas on the back one more time, and nods at Bobby when Bobby lifts his beer to him.
He smiles to himself - the last piece to this perfect new world sliding into place.
And there is peace.
“- Dean.” Cas’ face has fallen and he steps out of Dean’s space, “Dean, I’m not an angel anymore.”
“Hi Dean.” she signs back and smiles. “Bring him home.”
His life’s training moves him to find a better place for a defensive position, looking out among the trees to spot any threats waiting for the right opportunity - when they decide to attack, he’ll be ready. He’s looking for any kind of makeshift weapon when maybe!Bobby says, “Was. Now I’m not.”
“You’ve always had me, you know that Cas?” Because man of action or not, Cas was right. It needs to be said, “You can have me.” He feels his tear ducts sting and looks to see Cas’ eyes watering too, but he looks broken.
“Hi Dean.” she signs back and smiles. “Bring him home.”
Dean’s brow furrowed with suspicion - he didn’t expect to see Bobby. He knew Bobby was a better father than his real father to him and Sam, but it didn’t feel right that Bobby would be his soulmate. He must be a memory.
“Everyone together.” Bobby looks back over to him.
happen. Dean deserves to be loved. He's been given a heaven he deserves and in that heaven is love.
They pull away, Cas’ hand where his handprint used to be, and Dean with his hand tangled in Cas’ hair. Their eyes meet and years of things unsaid between them are shared in one look.
Cas relaxes into a smile - “Of course, Dean. I’m not going anywhere.”
He’s on his way out the door when it opens of its own accord. He grins when he sees her, knowing what it means.
Of course he’ll stay. Dean’s heart fills, a truth he hadn’t known he’d needed to hear until now. He squeezes Cas’s shoulder one more time, and nods at Bobby when Bobby lifts his beer to him.
At one of the long tables in the room sits a horde of Ghostfacers, all excitedly arguing about if the pink himalayan salt was a better protection against specters than iodized table salt. An amused looking Jesse and Cesar Cuevas sit at their table, a horse-riding helmet hanging off the back of Cesar’s chair.
family created - this new place that he gets to truly do whatever he wants. Be whoever he wants. Feel whatever he wants. With whoever he wants. There’s no plan, no story to be told, no fight to fight, just him and whatever he chooses to do. It’s relief - freedom - that washes over him.
Dean’s heart stops. He thinks of his family - his friends - all separated far too soon. Everyone together, Bobby had said. And the walls? His hope starts to piece together in his chest against his wishes. Surely, he couldn’t mean - blue and tan flit across his minds’ eye. But the black goo that engulfs it dashes any hope he had growing within him.
“Busted my ass out. And then he… well… he set some things right.” Bobby nods. “Tore down all the walls up here.”
But more than that, how is Benny here and not in Purgatory?
he realizes he means.
...made some changes here.”
Dean still doesn’t understand. That’s great, but what does that have to do with -
It’s beautiful here and Dean allows himself to let his guard down. The mountains go on for miles around him - he’d always liked the mountains. They didn’t have any views like this in Lawrence. It reminded him how huge the world was outside his little life in the bunker, and really, with so many beings - humans, angels, monsters, gods - trying to force the weight of the world onto his shoulders, it was nice to feel insignificant sometimes.
Dean’s smile stills. It sure is pretty damn close to his perfect heaven isn’t it? He’s grateful, he really is. He’ll get to spend eternity with his family and all the friends he’s made along the way. But he knows there’s one person who didn’t get to die and go to heaven, whose fate was much emptier than that.
Cas’ eyes widen and his face opens brightly. “Dean - ”
“Amara?” He wonders aloud.
“Wow.” Dean says, “This tastes like the first beer I ever shared with my dad.”
Jack lowers his hand and smiles wide.
Except Bobo would have done it better in a way that ripped your heart out more than I can ever hope to succeed at.
His life’s training moves him to find a better place for a defensive position, looking out among the trees to spot any threats waiting for the right opportunity - when they decide to attack, he’ll be ready.
Nothing prepared him for the surprise of seeing Benny Lafitte sitting with Aaron Bass, Aaron’s golem fitting extremely uncomfortably into the small corner booth seat the three share. Benny notices Dean and tips his hat, an easy smirk on his lips, before slinging an arm over the back of the seat behind Aaron’s back. When the golem doesn’t immediately rip him into a bunch of tiny vampire pieces, Dean huffs a disbelieving laugh. Huh. He definitely wouldn’t have called that one.
Of course.
It’s in this quiet moment that he feels a weird pulling sensation inside of him - one he’s felt before.
“Everyone together.” Bobby looks back over to him.
“Dean freaking Winchester! It’s about time!” Charlie calls out from her table.
“I love this song.” He starts the engine and he drives.
He smiles to himself - the last piece to this perfect new world sliding into place.
Bobby mumbles, “Thought she’d have better taste.” Well Dean can’t argue there.
Figures, he had just started to believe that wasn’t true back on earth. To believe he might actually deserve something more than a lifetime on his own. He’s not exactly surprised - but it still hurts to come face to face with the universe confirming his worst thoughts.
Images immediately flash through his mind - no.
Dean looks around at the bar, at the family that remains around the room, at the people around the table with him and he nods his agreement. Cas has a quizzical look on his face, but Dean lets the hand that had been resting on the back Cas’s neck rub reassuring circles into the baby hairs there.
He turns around to find the source. On a hilltop overlooking the Roadhouse, he sees them.
“Heaven ain’t just living your golden oldies anymore. It’s what it always should have been.” Bobby says as he looks out at the trees.
“No.” Dean huffs a laugh that Bobby echoes. “It’s crap.” Dean smiles, “But it was fantastic.”
Dean feels his heart skip and he looks around to see confirmation that what Bobby says is true - to see these torn down walls. He doesn’t see anything - he should have expected that really - but he needs to know. Like, all the walls within heaven? Or - no, he couldn’t mean…
Dean feels everything slide into place. He’s lighter than he’s ever felt - what Cas said was true and here it was laid out in front of him so he couldn’t ignore it. He wouldn’t ignore it. Good things could happen. Dean deserved to be loved. He had been given a heaven he deserved and in that heaven is love.
“Dean - I could go w-” Cas starts.
Dean considers this. He looks out the window for a moment and Bobby and Cas return to conversation. He sees the trees and the hills, sees friends stumbling back home for the night, and he knows that this is good. And then he sees her in the parking lot - his Baby, long black lines stark against the golden sky.
The three share a smile. “Just like this.” Bobby says.
His curiosity begins to grow and he looks closer at the rest of the people in the crowd. He sees Meg and Gabriel in a corner booth, sitting on either side of a very terrified, very flustered looking Samandriel. Meg and Gabriel glare at each other and the mildly threatening, but maybe flirtatious, energy from the table radiates across the bar. Dean does not envy Samandriel in the slightest and is a bit concerned for the safety of everyone in the room, really.
He hears laughter at a table nearby and sees Donna sitting with her family of Wayward girls. Alex and Patience are laughing loudly at some joke that Wendy Hanscum has just made. Dean smiles to himself when he notices Kaia and Claire are only half-paying attention, their feet wrestling together under the table. Nearby, Jody has stopped to talk to Krissy Chambers, who was sharing a plate of french fries with Josephine and Aiden.
Jack, Lucifer’s child, a nephilim, his boy Jack, really came up here and made him a heaven his family always dreamed of. He gave Mary her perfect heaven - a heaven with John, where Dean and Bobby and Rufus and his whole family could see her anytime. A heaven where she was happy. He thinks of his parents at that dinner table in the bunker. The smiles and how light they both were. They have that now. Thanks to Jack.
And then he feels it.
Behind the bar, Ellen and Jo are serving drinks alongside Pamela Barnes. Pamela looks up and notices Dean enter and winks, through healthy, non-burnt out eyes.
In the split second before he is completely torn away to a parade of hugs and slaps on the back, Dean’s eyes flicker back to meet Becky’s. Her laptop has been closed and she is packing it away. A grin splits across her face and Dean laughs freely.
“My ex wife. She wants custody of my son. I can’t afford a lawyer.” Dean though for a moment.
“Both of my parents are dead.”
“Dean, I need to get up to make pancakes. Believe it or not, I can’t
It was a wedding invitation. Quite possibly the last thing Dean had expected it to be. It was in a fairly small venue not too far away from where Dean lived, and it was next week. He supposed he would soon be going to a wedding.
“You got me,” Dean said. “Guilty as charged.” Cas moved to get up, but Dean
“I think you honestly thought I was going to hit Kevin. I may be many things Dean Winchester, but I am not a bad father. I am trying my hardest.”
Gabriel and Sam got dragged off by some other guests, leaving Dean and Cas standing together awkwardly. Neither really wanted to go anywhere else, but the tension between them was enough to keep other guests away from them.
“Well, it doesn’t matter. I can adopt him anyway, and then you can be friends for ever and ever and it won’t even matter if you don’t have parents.” Dean smiled.
The little girl from the night before was gone, and Dean was back soon. Even though the trip hadn’t taken very long, the kid was asleep by the time Dean got back. He wordlessly handed Cas his cup of coffee and stood back a ways. Eventually Cas stood to face him. There was a wordless question on Dean’s face, but he wasn’t going to ask if Cas didn’t want to talk.
“Yeah?”
The place of origin or earliest known history of something
Dean dropped his keys and the newspaper on the table. He sighed. It had been a week or two since he had moved into town, and he still didn’t have a job. If he didn’t find one soon, he wasn’t going to be able to pay rent this month. He picked up the paper and opened it to the job section. It hadn’t held anything worthwhile before but who knows. Maybe today would be different.
“I said go.” Cas’s voice left no room for argument. The kid nodded and left. Dean stood down.
“Ok. Thank you Dean. Please hurry.” He hung up. Dean stepped on the gas, going what was probably above the speed limit but it didn’t matter. Nobody was going to be out at this hour of, Dean checked the time, 12:47 AM.
“Mommy’s still at work,” she said. “She works here. Daddy’s away for right now.” Dean nodded and went to get his and Cas’s coffee.
, Dean figured,
“What was that?” Cas asked. Dean didn’t reply.
“Go ahead Cas.”
“Dean,” Cas began. “Why are you sleeping on the couch with me?” He looked so adorably confused and this was the first time he had spoken in the past four days and Dean didn’t even bother coming up with a lie. Not that there was any lie that could easily explain this while still holding onto some sense of realism.
“Are we going to talk about this?” Dean asked one morning.
“I said no.” Cas’s voice was firm and a little aggravated. Dean moved without thinking, stepping between the two of them, body spread automatically to protect the kid. Cas looked surprised. Dean flinched when he moved. Cas stilled.
“That’s good to hear.” Dean almost jumped again as Bobby spoke from behind him. “You admitting to harassment I mean. It means gettin a restraining order will be a lot easier.” Meatron looked panicked, but only for a moment.
“Dean? The hell are you doin’ here?”
“I always sleep well when I sleep with you,” Dean answered. It was stupid and cheesy but it was the truth.
I’m back, and you didn’t even have to wait a whole summer this time!
“I was not aware I had made you feel that way. I apologize. I am afraid I have gotten quite used to defending my son from others. I assure you, I do not “hate your guts’.” Dean went back to work, feeling monumentally better knowing that he hadn’t screwed things up with his coworker before they had even really met.
Today was indeed different. Singer Auto. A mechanic’s job. While Dean had never actually had any formal training, he was pretty good at fixing cars. He decided to stop there tomorrow. The worst that could happen was that he could get turned down. Again. He really hoped that didn’t happen.
When he got to the hospital Kevin was asleep. Cas thanked him and he left. Everything was tense, but it was going to be ok. Cas said it was just a flair up, and he and Kevin would be home probably by the end of the week.
“Dean.”
Dean was panicking. He couldn’t think. All he could see was Sam’s blood and all he could hear were Sam’s screams. There were tears on his face, blurring his vision. He couldn’t think. Cas. Cas was safe. Cas wouldn’t hurt him or Sammy. Cas would never hit a kid. Cas was on the couch. Cas could help him.
“I will keep that in mind,” Cas responded.
Might just go ahead and post the rest of the chapters tonight, since I can’t seem to stick to any sort of upload schedule.
“Now, I suggest you leave my employee alone, before you dig a deeper hole for yourself.”
“Ok ok,” Gabriel said. “Keep your secrets. But I will find out what’s going on brother. I always do.”
“Come on Cassie!” he called. “You’re supposed to catch it!”
Dean decided to cut that line of thoughts off.
“I had a nightmare,” Dean explained. “I couldn’t think and well, you felt safe.” He immediately regretted saying that, looking anywhere but Cas’s face.
“What’s there to talk about?” Cas asked.
Life was pretty ordinary for Dean. He got to know Garth more. Garth was perhaps a little too passionate about things sometimes, but he was pretty fun. Dean fixed some cars at work, and waited for Cas to get back.
“Alright Cas I’m in the car. I’ll be there as soon as possible.”
There was a voice gently calling to Dean and a comforting weight on his shoulder. He didn’t want to wake up. Why was there someone talking to him in his own house anyway? He lived alone. He slowly opened his eyes and blinked a few times. He was in a chair in the waiting room. Right. The waiting room. The hospital. Kevin. Cas. It came back to Dean slowly. The nurse noticed he was awake.
Dean looked up when he heard the door between the garage and the office open. A man came out. He had black hair and the bluest eyes Dean had ever seen. He grabbed a tan trench coat,
“Yep.”
There was a problem. A problem named Metatron. Apparently he was a frequent customer. No one at the shop seemed very happy when the fuzzy-haired man had walked in. It didn't take Dean long to figure out why. Metatron was an ass.
“This is my shop boy.”
Things were a lot easier after Dean and Cas had apologized to each other. Dean hadn’t realized it at first, but he had missed Cas. He had missed having a friend, someone he could laugh with. And he felt that he and Cas were growing closer. Maybe they were even entering best friends territory? Dean didn’t remember ever having a best friend besides Sammy.
“Bobby?”
Dean got a text from Cas after work that day, asking him to pick up a change of clothes from Cas’s house and maybe a few things for Kevin.
“How do you not trust me to not hit my own son Dean? I really thought you knew me better than that. Any parent who does that is not and never has been a real parent.”
At first Dean didn’t realize what woke him up. There was a noise somewhere, but it was too early, right? It had to be, it was still dark, so what was that ringing...
“Dean. I was wondering...” He trailed off.
magically make breakfast from here.”

“Can you pick me up? My car won’t start and it’s an emergency.”
Before long they received the news they had been waiting for. Kevin was going to be ok. He would be able to go home the next day. He would have to spend a while resting, but he was going to be ok.
“Hey, do you hate my guts or something?” Castiel looked confused.
“Nice to meet you,” he said, holding out his hand.
Dean was having an average time at the reception. The ceremony had been beautiful, and Dean had expected nothing less. He was thrilled for his little brother, but now he was just generally avoiding people and trying not to look grumpy. He felt he might be failing though, from the way people were avoiding him.
“Yeah, I know you’re new here. I’ve seen everyone here but you. Listen boy, I can do anything I want. Anything at all, and you can’t do a single thing about it. You know why? Because you’ll be fired. You have no power here.” He turned back to Jo.
“Oh yeah? Where’s your proof? The town is more likely to believe me than you. You have no evidence.” Bobby just pointed to the camera mounted in the corner.
“Cas.” Sam looked confused.
“Oh,” Dean said. “Ok, well, good for him. And you. Good for both of you.” He trailed off, realized he was rambling, and shut up. Sam let out a laugh, and some of the oppressive tension eased up.
“Hey man, lighten up.” Dean jumped as Sam’s voice came from behind him.
“Pancakes?” Cas laughed.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Why do your pants have sparkly pandas all over them?”
“Kevin, I’m sorry. But you know why we don’t.”
“Hey! My brother’s in law school. I can ask him if he can do anything for you, if you want.” Cas offered something that was not quite a smile, but was certainly a valiant effort at one.
“Thanks Dean. I’ll call you back with the info later.” Sam hung up.
“Truce?” he asked, extending his hand. Cas gave Dean that little half smile.
“Oh. My apologies, Dean. What was it you were asking?”
“We need to get to the hospital. Now.” Dean nodded and set off again. He glanced in the rearview mirror to see that both Cas and Kevin were in the car, and Kevin didn’t look great. Dean turned his eyes back to the road.
“Sounds good, Cas.”
“His name’s Gabriel.” Sam was starting very intently at Dean, like he was trying to gauge his reaction by staring into his soul.
“I haven’t even given you my car yet. I just walked here to say hi to miss Harvelle here. You must have someone else in mind.”
“Yeah. Yeah! I’m perfect.” Sam raised an eyebrow.
“Yeah that’s what my dad said too, right before he beat me and my brother. How do I know you’re any different?” It came out angrier than Dean had meant it. Cas looked horrified and a little angry.
“I have to get to work. I’ll tell Bobby where you are. Call me if you need anything.” Cas nodded, and Dean left.
, Dean thought, and started to the door.
He was out of gas. Of course he was. Of course, today would be the day that he ran out of gas. He would have to walk.  How far could it be?
“He’s going to be here for a few days at least. I’m going to stay here with him. You can go though.” Dean checked the time and nodded.
“Cas?” Cas blinked.
Cas was a little out of it today. This was the third time he had almost impaled Dean , and his hands were covered in various easily avoided scratches. Dean had had enough, and finally decided to ask Cas about it. His distraction was going to get him killed in some sort of freak accident.
“You know you’ll never escape this, Dean,” John said. “You’ll never escape me. I’ll find you. I’ll find you and your brother. You’re not safe. Not anywhere.”
“And I should have known I’d be lookin’ after you again.”
He greeted Sam when he arrived. As he walked up to the taller man, he felt as though he was literally radiating tension. He could feel it pouring off of himself in waves, and was sure that his brother could feel it too.
“Oh?”
“And what if I don’t? What are you going to do, hit me? And risk losing your brand new job?” Dean blinked.
Dean watched them with a soft smile. His own father would have never allowed something like this to happen. The look of absolute joy on the faces of both parties was something that Dean had never experienced. If he or Sam had ever tried something like that, well, they wouldn’t be laughing as their father chased them around.
“I’m one of your only,” Castiel muttered. Dean stifled a laugh.
“That wasn’t exactly a question, but yeah. We moved around a lot as kids, and sometimes my dad would have my brother and I stay with Bobby while he was off doing... something he never told us about.” Castiel nodded, and went to talk to another customer.
(See the end of the chapter for
“What’s wrong Cas? You’ve been distracted lately. It’s going to get one of us hurt before too long.” Cas took a moment before responding.
Several days passed with no change. Kevin woke up sometimes, but spent most of his time unconscious. He wasn’t getting better, but he didn’t seem to be getting any worse either. Dean had been staying there with Cas. Cas wasn’t going to leave Kevin, and Dean wasn’t going to leave him.
He was a kid again, and his dad was angry. He went after Sammy, just like he usually did. And just like usual, Dean distracted him. Stood in front of Sammy. Taunted John. Got John to hit him instead of Sam. He was scared and hurt, but usually John took most of it out on him, and then Sam would be ok. Except that’s not how it happened this time. John hit Dean until he couldn’t move. But he could still see. And then he hit Sam, and it was the worst thing Dean had ever seen. Sammy screamed and cried. Dean could hear bones crunch. He couldn’t move. He tried to call out, to distract John, but he found that he couldn’t speak. He could only watch helplessly as John hit and Sam screamed. John gave a particularly powerful kick, and Sammy’s screams stopped. He fell next to Dean, his eyes open and unseeing. Dean found that he could now scream, and he cried out for Sammy. For it not to be true. It couldn’t be true. He awoke with a gasp, Sam’s screams still ringing in his ears.
“Really? Because it just seems like you don’t trust me with my own child.” Dean looked confused.
“This is my coworker,” Dean said. Sam raised an eyebrow.
It was the middle of the night again. Dean woke up to his phone ringing. Remembering what had happened the last time, he picked up right away. Cas’s voice was afraid again.
wrapped his arms around him more tightly.
“Be careful Dean. I might think you’re just in this for my cooking skills.”
“Yeah. She found out my parents were dead so she said she’d adopt me when she grew up. She offered to adopt you too.”
“You first,” Dean said.
“Like the phone call coworker?”
“Dean,” Cas said again, “did you really think I would hurt my own son?” All Dean could do was shrug helplessly. Cas looked sad.
“Hey,” he said. “Leave her alone, would you? It’s obvious she’s not interested, so just stop.” Metatron turned to him with an incredulous look. Dean guessed that not many people stood up to him.
“Dean.” It was Cas’s voice, tinged with panic. Dean was instantly awake.
“You should call him sometime.”
“Dean, why don’t you trust me?” Dean turned around and gave Cas a questioning glance, even though he knew very well what this was all about. Cas knew he knew as well, and told him so.
“So uh,” Dean began, “Who’s the lucky lady?” Sam looked kinda uncomfortable at that.
I’m not dead!  Sorry for the long wait, there was one scene transition in here that I just couldn’t figure out for the longest time.  Hope you’re all doing well!
“You know,” Dean started quietly, “there was a girl down there who offered to adopt me.”
“I understand,” Cas said. “My father never did what yours did, but he wasn’t really around much either. I know you didn’t mean to imply that I would ever do something like that. It’s just, I already have people talking about me like that. I already have people who think I am an unfit father for one reason or another. People who want to take my son from me. It’s kind of a habit for me too I guess.” Dean nodded.
“Dean.” The brothers shook hands.
“I’m not sure that’s a great idea Kevin.” Kevin pouted, and it reminded Dean of an expression he had seen on a younger face so long ago, asking a similar question. Automatically he moved so he could easily place himself between Cas and his kid if he needed to. Neither one seemed to notice.
“Sure Cas, ask away.”
“I don’t know.”
“Seriously Dean, call your brother.” Dean nodded, but was spared from having to promise anything by the end of their lunch break.
“We should tell Gabriel. He’d be so pleased with himself. I think he probably noticed it before we did.”
And suddenly Cas was there. Cas was pulling him close. Cas was speaking to him. He couldn’t understand what was being said, but it was comforting. Cas was breathing steadily. Slowley, Dean’s breathing began to slow to match Cas’s. Cas was tracing shapes along Dean’s back and Cas was telling him it would be ok and Cas was there. Dean just hugged Cas tight and cried until he fell asleep.
“So you trick him into confessing. Smart.” “Thank you.” There was a beat of silence.
“I don’t know,” Cas said. “They won’t tell me. All I know is I don’t want to be alone right now.” Dean nodded and sat down. Cas sat beside him. They sat in a tense silence, neither of them knowing what to say. Eventually a nurse came out to see them.
Quietly, Dean padded out to the living room and headed for the couch. Cas was there. Cas was safe. Slowley, he laid down beside Cas. If he had been able to think at all, he never would have done it. But he couldn’t think and Cas was there and Cas would make everything better. Breathing deeply, Dean relaxed. Cas smelled like honey and cinnamon and something sharp that Dean couldn’t identify. He was warm. He was safe. Dean fell back to sleep quickly.
So he watched Cas. He watched as his eyes moved under closed lids. He observed how much more peaceful Cas looked in sleep. How much younger. He watched as Cas awoke slowly, peacefully. His eyes opened slowly and Dean realized he was in love. Cas smiled sleepily at him and Dean’s heart practically melted.
“Sam.”
“We’re whatever you want us to be. We’re going to do whatever we do. This is going to go as far as you want it to go. I love you, Dean Winchester. I think I’ve loved you since I first saw you in the shop.”
Cas rolls his eyes, “Dean, I’m just a man now.” Cas looks at him pointedly, “A man. And I know you only like - ” His eyes slide over to where Anael has been watching them from the side of the room.
“Rufus lives about 5 miles that way.” Bobby points into the distance.
, Cas. It’s okay.” Dean squeezes his shoulder, reassuring. “You’ll be here when I get back?” The “please” and the "I
He’s looking for any kind of makeshift weapon when maybe!Bobby says, “Was. Now I’m not.”
Dean’s smile stills. It sure is pretty damn close to his perfect heaven isn’t it? He’s grateful, he really is. He’ll get to spend eternity with his family and all the friends he’s made along the way. But he knows there’s one person who didn’t get to die and go to heaven, whose fate was much
He looks out over this world his family created - this new place that he gets to really truly do whatever he wants. Be whoever he wants. Feel whatever he wants. With whoever he wants. There’s no plan, no story to be told, no fight to fight, just him and whatever he chooses to do. It’s relief - freedom -
“Yep.” a gruff, familiar voice says.
Outside, Dean admires the beauty of his car. He slides his hand from the trunk and along the side until he reaches the driver side door. He leans in to see the clean lines of her interior - they look more beautiful than ever. “Hey Baby.” he says.
In the quiet, Dean nods, acclimating to this new reality he finds himself in. “Well at least I made it to heaven.”
He breathes in forgiveness and exhales something he hadn’t realized had been tightened around his chest since he was 6 years old.
Jack.
When Bobby said Jack tore down the walls, he couldn’t have meant - did Jack really tear down
as the demon rolled their tongue into Castiel again and again, two pairs of lips stroked together messy and rough. He was pushed down by that kiss, down onto the bed and onto his back and onto his pillow, and he couldn’t breathe but it didn’t matter because the overwhelming sensation of hot lapping tongue and hard sucking lips was everything he ever wanted to feel. His mouth was swollen already, the taste of the boy’s mouth inside his and all over his lips, and he’d never cared for sloppy sex but that had blown past every other kiss he could remember.
. Thrice and seven and thrice again, because Bobby raised him right and he knows how to do ritual magic when he has to.
Right now is Dean stumbling across the room, is hot tears on his cheeks as he falls against his angel, hands gripping that damn trenchcoat tight because feeling it means Cas is
bed, but Ellen keeps decent mattresses in her temporary rooms and he wakes comfortably, though no mattress is comfortable enough to make morning a bearable or humane time of day. Castiel blindly gestures at the coffeepot on the small desk, his eyes still squinted shut against the intrusion of
“Can you teach me that?” Cas requests, watching Gilda’s strong hands expertly rub at his partner’s feet. She smiles up at him and beckons; Cas rises from his pedicure chair and goes over to crouch down next to where she is sitting.
“Just drive. I’ll tell you where to turn.”
Defeat God, save the world, get back the friends and family who should never have been lost in the first place.
,” Dean growled against Castiel’s ear, hot breath on the pale skin, teeth finding the edge and pulling at it. “
He shouldn’t kiss him, chained to the bed and furious and hurt, but Dean’s whole life lately had been doing things he shouldn’t, and he’d gotten freedom from shit like internalized homophobia and responsibility in the bargain. So when Cas pursed his lips and looked away, Dean leaned in and melded their mouths together. One short, rough kiss, a hard wet press and pulling off before Cas could bite at him.
Roadhouse Mark II. He likes it.
for me to live.”
of this realm, settles onto his shoulders in an invisible mantle. It adds and expands to his abilities as a Knight, the deep bases of power he’s barely begun to dip his toe into; what was a lake is now a sea, throbbing with something not unlike life.
“Thanks, Cas,” gets breathed out against his temple, and it’s damn cold in Wichita but Dean is a line of welcome heat all up the front of his body. Possibly even better than the physical connection is the psychic one, where Dean is pulsing out gratitude and happiness along their familiar bond.
of Heaven via a backdoor that is increasingly unstable with the angel-tablet broken, and then make his way in a car that last held himself and his fallen brother to where the bunker is.
“Don’t argue.” He pointed the Blade at Cas and glared as he sat on the side of the bed, half-expecting a kick that didn’t come. He should have bound Cas’s ankles, too, but Dean… didn’t want to. Didn’t want to think about it either. “Now. You were able to eat some nice Grace before, get yourself all angel-fied and fixed up. So why don’t you go ahead and tell me what to do to get the shiny stuff out of him and into you.”
(They are both quick-witted, funny assholes who share a juvenile sense of humor. This is not difficult to understand; he simply refuses to acknowledge it. Undesirable behavior is best countered with a lack of attention, after all.)
The wave of grief slams into him sideways, bowing Dean's back as he braces his palms on the counter. Being familiar doesn't make the agony hurt any less; it's gotten stronger each time, because every time he's lost Cas he's lost
It’s… nice, to see Dean switching between forms so easily. To see him
. Fuck if he knew this priest from Adam, but at the same time – those blue eyes were familiar. He’d have sworn he’d heard that wrecked voice crying out
“Truce,” he said, reaching out to take Dean’s hand. Before he could however, something hit him in the side of the head. Dean burst out laughing, dissolving whatever tension was left between the two men. Upon inspection, it was a bouquet. Cas and Dean both looked in the direction it came from. Unsurprisingly, there stood Gabriel.
With that he walked past Dean and out the door, leaving Dean alone with his thoughts.
Used google translate for the chapter title, so I hope it’s not super off
Over the next few days Cas was distant. Dean found he missed him. Things became more tense over time, until one day everything just exploded. They had just finished for the day, and Dean was leaving when Cas spoke up.
Of course, that’s where everything went horribly wrong.
“Please dad? We never get to do stuff like this.”
Kevin looked even worse than the last time Dean had seen him. He looked even paler and his breathing was uneven. There was a sheen of sweat over his face. Cas sat down beside him. It was obvious he had no intention of leaving until this whole thing was over. Dean sat beside him. He wasn’t going to leave Cas alone this time.
“Singer auto. I should have known it’d be you.”
“Sammy. Hey. I honestly didn’t expect you to call me back.” There was a soft chuckle from the other side of the line.
There was a little girl in the cafeteria when he went in. She giggled, which turned into full blown laughter when Dean raised an eyebrow. He glanced down and realized the reason. Not only was his hair a complete mess, but he was also wearing pants with glittery hearts and pandas all over them. Dean glanced around for the girl’s parents, but saw nobody.
“I think,” Dean continued, “That I’ll take this as far as you want it. From here on out, I’m all in. I love you, Castiel Novak. I think I always have.” Cas pressed a soft kiss to the corner of Dean’s mouth.
“Yep,” Sam replied. “This is Dean.”
“Thanks. And Sammy?”
“Hey Cas. What’s going on buddy?” Cas looked up, but it seemed as though he was staring through Dean instead of looking at him.
“So Dean,” Cas started at the same time as Dean said
(See the end of the chapter for
“I’m not mad at you for leaving. You did what was right for you. I’m sorry for arguing with you about it.” There was a moment of silence before,
(See the end of the chapter for
“Say that again Sammy. It’s hard to understand you when you try to put all your words into one word.”
“Dean. Please come to the hospital. Something happened. I don’t know what to do.”
“Wait, you two know each other?”
“But dad-”
At lunch, Dean met his other coworkers. There was a young woman maybe a few years younger than Dean who looked familiar somehow named Jo, and Bobby. It was a very small operation.
“Well consider me adopted,” Cas said. It had obviously meant to be light, but it had come out strained. There were no more words shared between the two that night.
Well that took way too long to get done.  Still not sure I’m happy with it (again), but you know what?  I’m gonna post it anyway, otherwise I probably never will
“Yeah yeah but I figured you might know some things that could help him. You know, since you did decide to pay to learn this stuff.”
Voicemail. It had gone straight to voicemail. Maybe Sam was in class. Or maybe he just didn’t want to talk to Dean. Dean left a message anyway explaining Cas’s situation and tossed the phone down on the table. At least he could tell Cas that he tried.
. Dean wasn’t sure where it came from, but it was gone in the blink of an eye.
“He has a disease,” Cas began. “He was diagnosed two years ago. There currently isn’t a cure, and it’s typically fatal before age twelve.” Dean nodded.
Over the next few weeks, Dean and Cas got closer. Not necessarily best friends mind you, but close enough that they could probably hang out together outside of work. Not that they ever did, but they were at a level of friendship where they could.
“He was right.” Dean offered her a half smile before turning to go.
Dean woke up blearily as his alarm went off. He slapped it off and rolled onto his back. Why did he have an alarm set again?
“Dick.”
“I wish you wouldn’t project your memories of him onto me.”
“But dad, I’m good. I’ll be fine, I promise.”
Then Kevin took an upturn. He was still pale, but not as much as he had been before. His breathing, though still shallow, was falling into a more regular pattern. He was spending more and more of his time in the waking world. The doctors were calling it a miracle. Dean had always had rotten luck when it came to miracles, but who knows. Maybe this one was for real. The relief of Cas’s face was enough to make the days spent at the hospital worth it.
Bobby was sympathetic, and told Dean that he would assign him a temporary partner for the next few days. An intern named Garth. He worked well, and was pretty friendly. Dean liked him. But he wasn’t Cas.
The kid was sitting up in a hospital bed. He was attached to too many machines and there were too many tubes going into his body, and he was too pale. But he was alive. That childlike spark of life was still there. Cas’s face showed nothing but relief as he went to sit by his son. Dean felt that he was intruding on something. Softly, he asked Cas if he wanted any coffee. Cas nodded, and Dean left to get it.
“I’m just asking because you glared at me yesterday and you won’t talk to me today and I was wondering if I might have done something to piss you off.” Castiel turned to Dean.
“Does Sam know about your dad?” Dean was about to answer when he stopped and thought about it. Did Sam know? Dean had always assumed he did, but Dean had never actually told him... Bobby rolled his eyes at Dean’s expression.
Dean never slept alone again.
He sat up. Right. He had a job now. He couldn’t afford to sleep in. He got out of bed and stumbled to his small kitchen to make coffee.
“I look forward to it. But now I have to get this,” he raised one of the cups, “to my friend back in the waiting room.” “Are his parents dead too?”
All he had to do was call his brother. Right. Easier said than done, Dean thought as he paced his small kitchen. It shouldn’t be this difficult. Except that he and his brother hadn’t spoken since Sam had left for college. They had had a fight, and Sam had left angry. Dean hadn’t heard from him since.
Dean woke with a gasp. There were tears streaming down his face. He couldn’t breath, He couldn’t think. He couldn’t move. John was coming for him. John was going to kill him.
“Yes, my parents were very religious. My father might as well have been god himself, never there but expecting us to listen to everything he said anyway. You can call me Cas, if you like.” Dean nodded.
“I’ll be right there.”
The ride to Dean’s house was silent. Dean offered Cas the bed, but he declined. He took the couch, and barely said a word to Dean. Dean called Bobby and explained the situation. Bobby said that he and Garth could take over their shift, and that it was alright. Dean relayed the news to Cas, who nodded, but didn’t say a word. Dean offered him some leftovers for dinner, which he declined. He just showered and went to sleep. Dean couldn’t say he blamed him. He just wished there was something he could do.
Jo had decided to quit and go work at her mom’s bar for a while. She hoped the presence of her mom would help in keeping Metatron away. Dean thought she was right. He had met her mom when he was younger, and she was tough as nails.
“Kevin, go wait in the car. I’ll be out in a moment.”
“Now, where were we?” Jo looked about ready to punch him, and Dean was certain he was going to if she didn’t.
Cas had been staying with Dean for three days. In that time he hadn’t said a single word and had barely eaten anything. Dean knew he was grieving, and that he needed time and space. It was hard for him to not hug Cas. To wrap him in a blanket and make sure he knew that he was going to be ok. But he didn’t, because that wasn't what Cas needed right now. Right now he just needed to feel whatever he was feeling, without anyone telling him it was going to be ok. Right now he just needed time.
Dean woke up slowly. He was pleasantly warm. He felt safe. Beside him, Cas shifted.
That’s all folks!
“We don’t know.” Cas nodded and followed the nurse back, Dean trailing behind.
“Cas? What is it?” Cas sounded scared, which made Dean scared.
“I thought you knew me better than that.” Dean opened his mouth to speak, but closed it again when he couldn’t find the words. Cas looked more sad, and Dean felt awful. Neither of them said another word as Cas walked out the door.
The phone rang when Dean was cooking dinner. Well, microwaving leftovers, but that counted as cooking, didn’t it? He answered it without checking the caller ID.
“Alright,” Dean agreed. “Well, um, I wanted to say I’m sorry for what happened in the garage. As you can probably tell from that, I didn’t exactly have the best childhood. And those habits, they become part of you. I don’t think you’re an unfit father. I promise I don’t think you would ever do something like that. It’s just, habit, y’know? It’s something I have to do because what if. You know? What if I was wrong and someone gets hurt because of me?” Dean stops, realizing he’s going to cry if he keeps talking.
“He has been coming here for a while. Someone had to do something. He’s a fairly popular local writer though, so we couldn’t make any claims without evidence.”
When they got there, Kevin was whisked away in a bustle of quickly-moving nurses and doctors. The whole thing left Dean and Cas out in the waiting room together. Dean considered asking Cas what was going on, but he decided that Cas looked worried enough. He didn’t look like he was planning on talking to anyone soon, as he was pacing with such an intense look on his face that Dean was half afraid to even be seen by Cas. So instead of asking he just sat in a chair in the corner and watched Cas pace back and forth.
“Why do you look so angry dude? There are a bunch of college girls here. I thought that’d be right up your ally.” Dean rolled his eyes. Normally it would be, but he just couldn’t get his argument with Cas out of his head. Unfortunately for him, Sam knew him too well.
“We’ve been waiting for ya.” Bobby says, and he pushes the door open.
Bobby huffs out a laugh, “It ain’t, you idjit.”
“I think I’m gonna go for a drive.” He says, still looking outside. He looks back at the table to see Bobby smiling already knowing, Cas, worry written across his face.
Dean crashes into Cas, pulling at that damned lopsided blue tie, and capturing Cas’ lips with his own. The apple pie crashes to the ground but Dean barely hears it. Cas stands frozen, disbelieving, but when Dean’s hand makes its way to Cas’ neck, Cas moves into action, sucking in a breath, and bringing a hand up Dean’s side to rest on his arm.
Cas understands, “Dean.” he plants a hand on Dean’s knee and squeezes. “He’ll be along.” Dean looks away for a moment and then back to Cas, nodding slightly.
Cas’ smile widens and softens and this time, it’s Cas that pulls Dean back in. Dean grins into the kiss. He can’t believe he gets to have this. That he’s here.
At the corner of the bar, Ash flips his mullet, now reaching down past his waist and cracks some quip funny enough that Garth throws his whole body back to laugh, jostling his wife who has her arm around his shoulders. Their kids are running and giggling around the room, which clearly irritates the table where Ketch, Toni, and Mick are all looking much too civilized for the space they occupy. Bela Talbot makes her way over the table with a round of pints for the group.
“Heaven ain’t just living your golden oldies anymore. It’s what it always should have been.” Bobby says as he looks out at the trees.
Bobby catches his eye and waits as Dean processes this information.
Bobby huffs out a laugh, “It ain’t, you idjit.”
He double takes as he sees two Charlies at a large table - for a moment, he’s concerned Charlie's split herself again. But he calms when he sees at one Charlie’s side sits Dorothy, and at the other Charlie’s side sits the hunter Stevie. They’re joined by a group of other hunters Dean recognizes from Apocalypse World, and Dean notices the pages of paper and colorful sets of dice spread out across the table as Dorothy’s Charlie animatedly spins some story for the group.
As Cas always has, since the moment they met, Cas sees right through him, “Time up here… it works different.” he reassures. Dean considers this.

“Wow.” Dean says, “This tastes like the first beer I ever shared with my dad.”
He breathes in forgiveness and exhales something he hadn’t realized had been tightened around his chest since he was 6 years old.
“Cas, you and Jack gave me everything I could ever need. Everything I could ever want, or dream. It’s…” Dean trails off, “It’s almost perfect.” Dean says. His smile is authentic and it is happy, but there’s also the mourning grief of separation behind it.
“This is a high quality beer?” Cas asks.
Cas relaxes into a smile, “Of course, Dean. I’m not going anywhere.” Of course he’ll stay. Dean’s heart fills, a truth he hadn’t known he’d needed to hear until now.
“I love this song.” He starts the engine and he drives.
But wait, how is Benny here and not in Purgatory?
Outside, Dean admires the beauty of his car. He slides his hand from the trunk and along the sides of the doors until he reaches the driver side door. He leans in to see the clean lines of her interior - they look more beautiful than ever. “Hey Baby.” he says.
Dean 'hmm’d', and decided he might as well listen and see what happens. What are they gonna do, kill him again? He grabs a chair as Bobby continues to tell him about Jack.
Dean looks and thinks he might see smoke from a chimney.
He hears laughter at a table nearby and sees Donna sitting with her family of Wayward girls. Alex and Patience are laughing loudly at some joke that Wendy Hanscum has just made. Dean smiles to himself when he notices Kaia and Claire are only half-paying attention, their feet wrestling together under the table. Nearby, Jody has stopped to talk to Krissy Chambers, who was sharing a plate of french fries with Josephine and Aiden.
