a baby.”
“Safe. And ours. After the birth. We’re to be–”
“What, those serums? She wanted a weapon, or something?”
Sherlock shrugged, but a blush crept up his pale cheeks. “I made an extensive study of messenger fowl in my youth.”
He frowned.
sweetie! Molly, babe, do you have a hair tie in your bag?”
“Course you need to thank him,” snaps John. “He nearly single-handedly saved these two young men from a vicious hate crime.”

“I was casting my net very narrowly, John. My mind does need
The Watsons were a long line of functional, perfectly Godly mages:
“Stop that,” John said tersely.
“Good morning,” Sherlock purrs, his voice deep with sleep.
“Think, damn you, just sod it and
The warm sensation in his fingertips faded and his hands fell leaden into his lap. His newly-bloomed joiner magic was only good for short stretches.
“Oh.” John raises his eyebrows. “In case…”
“Sorry for the delay,” John calls over his shoulder into the sitting room. “Got a bit preoccupied making the kitchen fit for human consumption.”
“Well, I am. And despite what you say, the only way to replenish your energy is sleep and nourishment. We should try to find a farm or something where we can nick some food. Can’t risk showing up in a town and being seen. Can you walk?”
John falters, suddenly turning crimson.
“Just trust me. Now, what was I saying? Oh, yes. My haven was passed into my keeping by a Faerie we call
Brushing his lips lightly along Sherlock’s cheek, John hums close to his ear,“Well, love
The scene speeds back up: Mary is suddenly very close, pinching a spot on his neck, and with a flash of pain, John stumbles to the floor, his limbs prickling and numb. Kicking his gun aside, she stands over them. John tries to lash out to knock her off balance, but none of his limbs respond. He spits his rage.
“Couldn’t find you,” Sherlock rumbles against his ear. John can feel his big hands clench on his back. His voice is muffled and strained, “I’m sorry, I’m so sorry it took me so long, John. Please forgive me.” Sherlock sucks in a few long, shuddering breaths, but then a wave of shivering hits them both. “Let’s get out of here.”
Sherlock scoops up the limp five-year-old with a muttered ‘ooph’ – she somehow weighs five times more when she’s asleep. Her wispy blond hair tickles his face as he gently settles her back onto the mattress, not bothering with the blanket – she’ll just kick it off. In Rosie’s room, blankets are only for cave forts, or nests for the furry animals, but John still covers her up at bedtime each night. Sprawled on the galaxy-patterned sheet, her eyelids squeeze and teeth grind as she fights some nocturnal foe. The jut of her jaw makes her look just like John.
“Ah, so you’ve felt it appropriate to engage a minor in your illicit activities? How very big brotherly of you, Sherrinford.” He leans against the doorframe of his bedroom, immaculate in white shirt, dress pants and polished shoes.
“Sherrin? You okay?”
“Of course I did.” Relief washes over John at this incredible information, stirring his mind into wakefulness. “But it’s been a while since I’ve picked a lock in the dark, underwater, upside down.”
“Brother mine,” Mycroft croaks around a mouthful of smoke. Exhaling with force, his voice returns to its usual nonchalant tenor. “You know something about this.”
“You’re monsters,” he whispers, shaking, the emotion crowding out of the catacombs and threatening to overwhelm him. “Making these drugs, doing this to him, just to get to me.”
Subject: Morpheus
“I wonder,” Sherlock muses, chewing his pen. “What should the child call us? It will be confusing if we’re both Daddies. I don’t want to be
“Sherlock, this is your
in the air around them, occupying the same space as the forest.
“It’s just a cough.”
Nodding approvingly, John turns his attention back to the young couple. “There, I don’t think there’s anything worse than the bloody nose and some bruising to your face. You’re both very lucky, but I’m horribly sorry this happened to you. The police will be here in a moment and will need a full report. We’ll stay with you.”
“It’s a long story. Just suffice it to say that something
Sherlock finally gets a cab’s attention. John does the same. He leans toward the cabbie, pointing ahead.
“What are you wearing?”
His eyes drifted out over the shabby courtyard, the once-handsome ivy-covered Agency buildings now dusty and neglected as more of their resources were channeled to the Netter Laboratory. But Lestrade was not really seeing the grounds. His focus had gone soft, his sight turning inward as a quick ripple of warmth spread from his fingertips to the crown of his head. As the sensation faded, he exhaled and examined the flotsam of information his wave of Clairvoyance had washed up on his mind’s shore.
“Can’t a bloke come ‘round to say hullo to his family without raising suspicions?” He grins through the retort as they amble over the broad, neatly trimmed lawn toward the manor.
Bloody hell, the memory you have.”
John couldn’t help but nettle. “Look, I don’t know what you’re after, but when
but most were only after a regular meal while sporting the sharp red uniform.
“But influenza? How did you see that? It’s not even the season for it.”
Kinsey’s eyes snapped to his, suddenly wide and frightened. “I–I think I’m turning in for the day, Doc.”
Sherlock, for his part, tries to contain his astonishment. The new serum is completely different from the version he’d used on Sherrin so many years ago, following a line of research he’d read about last summer at the Cottage, kindling his curiosity and, bit by bit, pulling him out of his stubborn fear.
Spluttering, John twists around and gropes through the dark water. A tight metal cuff is sealed around his ankle with a heavy padlock, connected to an arm's length of rusty chain bolted to the floor.
“They’re perfect,” he announces with a hint of surprise. “Never had any that felt this good the first time wearing them.”
Sherlock finds his violin on the top of her bookshelf and begins to play Brahms. After only a few measures, Rosie sighs the shuddering breath of dream’s end and settles into a deeper, quieter sleep-state. He continues, but the playing become softer, slower, until the last note drifts off into silence. He places the violin and bow back onto her bookshelf and bends over his sleeping daughter’s face, lightly kissing her sweaty brow. She wrinkles her nose in her sleep.
“Well, half troll, if I’m honest.” It gave another deep sniff over their bodies and nodded. “Aye, halfblooded as the likes of you two.”
John hurried after, his mind swimming with her tale.
separately from it.”
Some loose end you’d overlooked, hm?”
“Am I? Couldn’t breathe. Or move.”
Toria keeps her stolen halfbloods close. Had you gone to her Lab for Netter assimilation, her surgeons would have detected your wild magic. And like every poor, blasted halfblood captured during her reign, she would have drained you of your wild essence and
Sherrinford scowls at him.
“Indeed. ‘Greg’ is your name, isn’t it?”
“John,” Sherlock said urgently, “
“Our…
“Bollocks,” John says quietly. “You’re punishing yourself.”
“You’ll be fine, Greg. I have somewhat updated my position on retirement. I admit this evening is far more pleasant than I anticipated. I will offer my consultation assistance, as a friend, but only at the flat. If you get truly stuck, come by for a meal and talk it through. Talking only. Photos if you have them. No locations. It’s time we trained your eye and sharpened your line of inquisition.”
It was a fool’s wish, he knew. No human mage could fly of his own will. Unless he was a halfblood, the heathen child of human-Faerie parentage.
What does he mean?”
Sherlock gives his head a little shake as if to clear it.
Sherlock had barely been free for a day, only to be dragged back to a fate worse than his servitude in the circus. John boiled with rage.
“Now, Lissa-Bee, you must understand that it is most inappropriate behavior to keep your Papa up for hours on end like this.” The baby gives a tremendous belch and Sherlock settles her on his lap, propping her up against his knees.
The happiest still may be the last;
“Am I…”
“We’re going… dancing?” John only waggles his eyebrows and tugs him further down the pavement where a bass pulse is emanating from an industrial-style club set beneath a railway arch. “At the

“I’m afraid I don’t follow…” John breathed.
something. He begins a rapid-fire correspondence with Meredith.
Sherlock relaxed, turning to John with a look of puzzled appreciation.
“She fled the country in such a hurry after her unplanned attack on us that they are likely still there, too tricky to travel with. She’ll be back to retrieve them imminently, as well as the evidence she plans to use against me—” His eyes snap to John and he frowns. “Did you just say your
“John - I’m sorry - you - a nightmare-” he stammers.
“Mycroft is livid. But he’ll do what I say. He’s lost too many people already and it’s costing a fortune moving teams around so quickly.”
“What do you think, John?" Sherlock asks lightly. "Fair fight?”
John dumped his load of sticks, his breath coming fast, and placed his hands on the damp, mossy stones. He felt an electric pulse, a thrum, a hum coming through his skin like the harmonic resonance of a bass and baritone choir. John shivered as the vibration shook him like a struck gong.
The dam holds, but enough seeps through that by the time the moon is beginning to disappear behind the opposite edge of the well, the water is over his head when he stands, at his chin when he treads. The heavy chain tugs him down and his limbs feel leaden.

Pulling it close to his face to inspect it in the gloom, his eyes confirm what his hands knew – a bone, a femur, small enough to be a child’s, and it’s been here for ages. His hands dive back into the murky water searching along the floor until he comes across three more bones, then five, ribs and legs, a clavicle, and then the smooth dome of a small cranium. Pulling it from the water, he stares at the slick little skull in his shaking hands, then lunges to his feet, staggering in the rising water.
Mrs. Hudson exclaims, squeezing him and hopping on her toes. “I’m to be a
After several awkward beats, Tallack rolled his eye. “Such as?”
“Good. Broke my leg in the fall, going to take me a minute.”
“Let me guess,” John smirked. “Flying out your window? Pissing off the locals by announcing their innermost thoughts?”
Sherlock was quiet for several steps. “The circus didn’t perform here,” he said flatly.
“Testing… what?” John frowns at him, puzzled.
the cat at home and his recovering sprained knee. He can just glimpse the Tshirt he’s wearing under his scrubs and feels a pang as he recognizes the wild black hair and pale face of a character from a comic Victor had been obsessed with last summer.
“Not today. Too hazy.”
. None had made John perceptibly uncomfortable. He decides it’s at least appropriate for him to proceed with light touch.
“Chen.”
“Go on,” he says roughly.
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock’s muffled voice drifts from under the bedclothes. “
“Oh – she’s outside then? Ah, the doorknob – right, sorry –”
“There, best have you both out of the way of all that. No need to fuss, I have nappies down here. I’ll go up for her milk later. I doubt you’ll be able to sleep, but stretch out on the sofa, there’s a love.” She squints at John. “Let me get something to clean your cut with, dear.”
“Perhaps I underestimated. Your overall experience has been, on the whole, more severe than my own.” He hesitates a moment, then places his hands onto John’s bowed head and begins to massage the scalp, fingertips making firm, circular strokes down his neck and across his shoulders. John groans and leans into his hands. After several minutes, he wobbles reflexively and Sherlock flinches to catch him, realizing he’s just drifted off. John pops up, soft-eyed and bleary.
Pulse quickening, John hesitated for only a moment. The diaries did not seem personal – surely if they were stored in the flat, Mrs. Hudson wouldn’t mind him looking? His curiosity won. Fascinated, he settled into an armchair by the fire and began pouring through the book.
His throat is too tight, he can’t speak.
“No problem. Class? What subject?”
Sherlock waggles his eyebrows and pours the egg mixture into the hot, buttered pan. It spits and sizzles.
sleep, but now there’s so much to do. He paces John’s room, his mind spinning out his plan, itemizing and organizing.
“You can’t properly heal yourself.”
Standing more carefully this time, John rubs his hands onto his sodden jacket, eyes adjusting to the gloom. Rough fieldstone walls curve around him, mossy and slick with moisture. His eyes follow the walls up, up into darkness.
of lives, no hyperbole. His death changes nothing. He was a genius. He could see all ends and weave his web in ways we could not calculate. His loyalists outnumber us, largely because they have been brilliantly blackmailed. It is staggering to imagine the number of traps waiting to kill the children of dignitaries, to erase the life’s work of brilliant scientists. He hoped you were like him, and would continue his chaos.” Mycroft finally turns to look Sherlock in the eye. “Where he failed was in assuming you had no heart.”
Sherlock jolts out of his train of thought, blinking as he reenters the world around him, realizing he’s been pacing in front of the A&E. The candy bar is gripped in his fist and getting mushy in its wrapper.
“The screening process for a potential Moriarty is typically highly unorthodox in nature, but Brook’s decline in mental stability brought this to new heights. Sherlock, you have been being tested from the day you and John appeared on the unfortunate murder scene of The Pink Lady, or whatever ridiculous title he gave to it in his blog.”
“John,” Sherlock calls, sitting up straight and trying not to look weak. John pauses at the door and turns. “Thank you. Truly.”
“Half-elven
“It would seem the current formula degrades within a month of being administered.” Sherlock is talking fast, which is either a good sign, or a very bad one. “I had anticipated some instability, did say as much. Under your very aggressive timeline, there was no evidence of recall. With some adjustment, it could be avoided. However, I rather think you’re out of coin to make such a request. Especially as you have rather spectacularly betrayed me. Tell me, were you even going to go through with the attack, or was it simply a ruse,
“Very good, little brother. Aneurism. Inoperable.”
“What is it?” Sherlock asks, tense.
“Sure, do that,” John leans against his legs and closes his eyes, the first smile he’s seen in days playing on his lips.
“Still warm,” Sherlock muses. “Where on earth do they get chips around a maximum-security hospital?”
John reluctantly pushes away from his warmth. “Go fast, I’m okay for a bit, I think.”

Coalescents join: a wound, a wall, the wool of sheep;
“Don’t feel responsible, Geoffrey. It worked out in the end. No one thought she was a legitimate threat anymore.” He squeezes John and murmurs softly, “Almost no one.”
Take good care!
“Ah, there you are, husband. Back like a beaten dog.”
John,
It’s the worst deduction he’s ever made. Sherlock pinches his eyes shut.
“What are you–” but Sherlock’s already pulled off and threaded his shirt under John’s arms and around his back, knotting the sleeves tightly to the rope. John feels tenderly bemused as understanding dawns on him. Should he lose consciousness, his head won’t slip underwater. Sherlock tugs on the knots.
“Not a clue.” To

“Don’t worry about Sherlock, I’m sure he’s just been lost in his research. What with the new job at the apiary, he’s up all hours again. It’s a bit of a comfort, I admit, seeing him so immersed in something.” He glances upstairs. “Actually, I’m glad you caught me alone. I’ve been wanting to talk to you about something. Please keep it quiet.”

“John, no human could design a method to keep someone alive after such trauma.”
Sherrinford beams and ruffles his hair.
The first nurse pulls down his face mask and grins at them.
“Because you needed it. You’ve been tense and worn out for days. You told me, once, how you used to come here as a boy, and I deduced that it would be good for you.”
Turning, John caught his breath – the forest was completely dark with no sign of their little, glowing shelter. He couldn’t even smell the woodsmoke. John nodded appreciatively, making careful note of a big S-curved yew tree just to the left of where he imagined the dome to be.
The lion-headed General shot him a withering look with his one human eye, his sneer revealing a sharp, elongated canine.
They lapse into quiet. Sherlock’s mind is bursting and he grins foolishly, John’s declaration filling him with effervescence.
“—meant destroying my life. To make me become what he wanted.” Sherlock feels as if he is being pulled by an undertow, unable to stop the insidious drag taking him away from his life. He can trace every thread back, can see how he danced and twitched perfectly according to plan.
“Sorry, Sir, but it’s a Repeater, not a letter-carrier. At the aviary.”
They were safe enough with a bridge troll, however they had gotten here. As a boy, he’d had a secret acquaintance with the River Derwent’s ancient bridge troll, Omri. He’d made a point of stopping to see the clever old creature when his escapades brought him to that corner of the woods. They had enjoyed trading riddles.

“Christ.”
“Hush, be still now,” boomed a huge, deep voice. It seemed to come from all around them in the fog.
He jammed his hands into his suit coat pockets. “I hardly know anymore.”
PS In this chapter, John refers to a recently-posted retcon scene (Sherlock's observations at the aviary). If you missed that addition, it's in Chapter 9/Jump and starts with, “Let’s just rest here a moment,” John tried to say casually...
Sherlock is staring at him, blinking and blinking, lips moving as if to speak.
“Yeah?”
John nods, then peers at the page and grins. “You’ve got your own tree in there, as well.”
“Melissa Sheron Watson-Holmes,” Sherlock rumbles quietly.
, Mycroft, she can’t
“Til then,” he nods and begins to lug the boxes up the stairs.
Sherlock thunders down the stairs. The front door opens and slams. John breathlessly counts to 15, then silently emerges, a little thrill burning bright in his chest as he follows his quarry down the street, keeping a fair distance between them. Sherlock strides along, looking out for cabs. He never once looks back. If he did, well, John is feeling more capable of confronting
“Just hang onto the rope, John. Keep breathing.” Sherlock stops abruptly, eyeing him critically, and seems to come to a quick conclusion. Holding onto the rope, he uses his free hand to rapidly unbutton his own sodden shirt. John squints at him with confusion, feeling his face warm.
“An interview.”
Two chapters in, the words begin to blur and he recalls that he never did sleep last night. He lets the book drop to the blanket, head falling back against the propped-up pillows with an extravagant sigh. He watches John for a long while. He should go back to the experiment, he thinks. He should text Molly to bring over spirulina powder. Maybe he should play again, Bach this time.
“Yea, maybe,” John scowls, “I don’t remember much at all, I was so panicked.” John rubs absently at his shoulder. “I tipped over, I think – yea, maybe I just got careless and lost my footing.” He swallows hard. “Jesus… I couldn’t stop the slide. Then you were hauling me up, and I think I blacked out for a moment.”
“John…” He gasps in pain, eyes squeezed shut. “Don’t tell.”

Mrs. Hudson’s eyes looked thunderous. “We’ve heard whispers that Toria is working on something new, something big. And nothing she creates bodes well for halfbloods.”
In the huge silence of the flat, John dearly missed the easy banter he and Sherlock had developed within one another’s minds. He wished that he could talk with Sherlock about all of these new marvels, plan their next steps.
The tricky equation in his mind shifted and he reconsidered John’s behavior in the light of his own revelation. He blinked rapidly, feeling as buoyant as if he’d eaten ten bowls of Mrs. Hudson’s remarkable soup.
“Ah. Yes, that sounds… accurate. I’m better. Now.”
“Got him!”

Bubbles gush from his mouth as his fingers suddenly bump into a short pipe that’s indeed set into the wall just above the floor. He can feel the force of the water surging out of it. Pushing back to the surface, he feels a small triumph: it’s narrow enough to block. When he stands, the water is up to his ribs.
John scrutinized the bland clerk, but saw no hint of the shaggy curls or piercing eyes. “You as well. That’s a relief, anyway. Wonder how long we’ve got.” He glanced down to where his watch would have been, but found only the bare skin of his glamor. “Damn, my timepiece is obscured.”

A chill, damp day weighs heavily outside the flat. Inside, the fire crackles in the hearth and John is half-dozing on Sherlock’s lap, both stretched out on the sofa beneath the tartan blanket. Hot toddies sit half-drunk on the table and Sherlock’s deep voice rumbles as he reads aloud from a worn paperback:

You’ve been exposed too long and are likely going into shock judging by your exhaustion and mumbled speech. We need to get you out and warm as quickly as possible. We must unlock this chain now.”

John lets him retreat into his notes, considering him.
Sherlock’s mind spun with the seemingly incongruous details of the halfblood murders as he followed John, Mrs. Hudson, and Lune through her flat. But all thought ceased as they stepped across the magical threshold at her kitchen door. John’s shared memories had not fully prepared him.
Sherlock reaches over and grips John’s hand. “Beginning of another, that’s how it generally goes.”
Not like in the dream. The awful, brilliant dream he’d had every night since the fire had sent the Watsons clear across the country and his whole world had turned grey.

of Faerie.”
Sherlock slouches miserably through the uniform rows of lobby chairs. A familiar figure is leaning into the vending machine, punching at the buttons. The standard barbs automatically spring to mind, but they’re drowned in an uncomfortable surge of sympathy for Mycroft who always seeks out sweets when he’s nervous.
“Tested in laboratory scenarios. And on a range of willing subjects.” John thinks he can detect more tension in Sherlock’s voice. What the bloody hell is Redbeard? “The homeless will do a great deal for compensation. Besides, Rosamund, the risks to my interests would be far too great were I to attempt any kind of subterfuge.”
“In part, yes. Rosamund Moran, for that is her real name, had been a close ally of Jim’s. Assisted in many of his plans for me. She even developed the code name for my special project.
“A mad lark?” John laughs nervously.
Lots more to come, dear readers, though the timing of the next chapter depends on how well middle-of-the-night writing works out this week. This one begged to happen today. Thank you so much for your comments and kudos. You keep me right.
Sherlock felt a dangerous thrill as the troll’s announcement brought a few hazy details of his premonition into sharper focus.

Sherlock lightly circles a fingertip around the tiny speckle of blood on John’s trousers. John fixes him with a soft, bemused smile.

A young elephant barreled through a nearby tent, collapsing it in a heap of canvas and splintered wood. Sherlock pushed John roughly out of the way, pressing him against a stall wall, their faces close, breath coming in gasps.

Sherlock retrieves the soft, spectrum-toned blanket and tucks it around the tiny sleeping baby in John’s arms.
His body felt leaden. Sherlock pushed the voice aside and slid back into slumber.
Sherlock watches the car drive off, his chest very tight, and turns to find John watching him. He swallows hard. “Hungry?”
“I’m going to climb out now and pull you up. I’ll just be right outside the well.”
John felt a tangled warmth that constricted his throat, making it hard to reply with a defensive retort. He wasn’t accustomed to having someone fuss over him.
He marvels at himself, the detective who metamorphosed from solution-junkie to complacent cat. He is not married to The Work. He is married to John, and has more than his starved younger self could have fathomed.

“Sorry,” John finally gasps through his laughter, “I’m so, so sorry–” but he’s stuck in uncontrollable giggle-wheezing. Sherlock watches his hysterics with fond amusement, shakes his head and kisses his temple.
“I did what they said. I finished it. And you woke up from the coma. Like they promised. They sent you here to recover. But your memory – you lost the whole

He could scarcely believe it. This was
Eight days later, he has stabilized the formula to 73% success of localized memory-loss six hours after application. None of the rats have had recall for four straight days. That seems long enough. He uses the new scanner to send his revised formula to the email address on the slip of paper given to him by the young assassin. Seething with nerves, he waits.

John’s tightly-coiled panic would propel him out of the well if his numb hands could only grip the rope. Shaking like a poplar leaf, the cold in his body is a dull throb.
“But who is to say the milk has to come from the
You’re worn through. And making me nervous.” Reluctantly Sherlock returns to his perch on the edge of the bed, a careful space between them. “Thank you. Now. Explain.”
He blinked up at John, his mind taking several beats to return to the present.
“Sherlock, can I ask you something?”
In a series of efficient moves reminiscent of their ambush months ago, the body is removed from the flat, bagged on a stretcher. A team is cleaning the glass and gore from the bedroom. Another repairs the window. Their captain is pacing around the kitchen giving orders into his phone, clearly organizing a wide search in the neighborhood and along her suspected escape route through the countryside, looking for suspicious activity that might indicate a network. The prison is abuzz with the scandal of their first escapee in a dozen years. She’s had inside help, he overhears, as the captain learns of witnesses confessing to Rosamund’s deadly coercion.
“So how…’
“Sorry. Nasty cut. Not too deep, fortunately, but you’ve lost a fair bit of blood. Mostly clotted, now. How long did you wait to call?”
“That sounded

, the freak.
Sherlock feels like he’s missed the last step on a flight of stairs. He goggles at Sherrinford through the experiment running between them.
“Sherlock, don’t bang on the glass like that, you’ll distract the driver,” John scolds.
“It is
In the perfect, quiet safety of his mind palace, Sherlock briefly rests his forehead against the edge of the chest, letting a bitter relief flood through him. He’s been holding it back for days. It wasn’t right to feel it when he should have been using is brain to save John.
John, still wearing the nimble new boots, pauses for a moment on the landing before bounding down the stairs. Sherlock, grinning into the rucksack he’s loading, can practically hear the excitement crackling off of him.
Doesn’t much matter. Once he understands everything, he won’t be staying.
It’s dusk when they arrive in the small, stony town of Beddgelert

“I usually prefer not to.”
She leads him down the sidewalk as if they were two Victorian bosom chums out for a stroll. The scent of her perfume is too strong. He doesn’t know which one it is, has never made a study of perfumes, and notes somewhere in the back of his anxious mind that he must remedy that if he survives this encounter.
“Yes, doctor.”
there has been a
It was dim and uncomfortably warm inside the medium’s tent. The noise of the crowd was muted the moment the flap fell behind him. John groped his way to a little table where a hunched, hooded figure sat eerily still by a single candle. He eased onto a wooden stool and pressed a penny onto the worn, sateen tablecloth.
Glancing at the screen, John sees that it isn’t a text, but a preset alarm demanding to be noticed. His breath hitches as he reads the customized alarm title: 5:30.
giving it to him that gave it so much strength.”
“Well, even if not by blood, they will still be a Holmes.”
“I didn’t mean that home.”
Sherlock hears his own voice as if from far off.
John pats his back. “It’s been… horrific, Greg. I don’t even really know how to put it into words yet. But. We’re all still here, safe and relatively sound. An we’ve got her. She can’t hurt anyone anymore.”
If you're curious, I often write while listening to Zoe Keating's Into the Trees, which you can sample on youtube and download from Bandcamp. She is an epic cellist who tells such vivid stories with her music. To me, it is the perfect soundtrack to this story. <3
Sherlock nods, smiling at his soft, innocent request, like a child home sick from school. He helps him stand and hovers nearby, holding a shoulder firmly. He watches him go through the mundane absolutions of washing his hands, brushing his teeth, smiling fondly when he splashes water on his head, scrubbing at his face and making his hair stick up at uneven angles. These simple acts, but they are different now, precious. How could it be that only this morning, John was unconscious in his bed, lost to him? And now he is, somehow impossibly,

John is quiet. Sherlock obediently watches his footing and thinks fretfully over his words. Perhaps he’s overstepped his bounds. He’s gotten along surprisingly well with Rosie  – taken on much of her care while John’s been working. He had seemed grateful, if nervous to be putting Sherlock out, no matter how Sherlock reassured him that he
“Yes, I am. Of course I am. You couldn’t possibly get rid of me. I don’t care how many heads you dissect on the kitchen table, you’re absolutely stuck with me.”
Mary, certainly. But he frowns. He’s pictured her in her wedding dress, but the image blurs and she’s decked out in tight black leather like a villain from a Bond movie brandishing a gun. With the strange image comes a surge of fierce anger he cannot identify. He shakes his head, bewildered. Thinking of Mary makes him realize—
“You must be dedicated – such a demanding art form. I can see it’s taking a toll.”
“But you pulled me up – you were on
With a huff, Sherlock drops to his haunches and leans against the brick wall, poking at damp cigarette stubs on the ground, trying to guess their brand from the filters. His mind is racing.
John sighs. “Well, there’s
“John, it is imperative that I understand how your memories began to come back to you.”
“But that’s incredible – how on earth can you see so clearly from across the bloody courtyard?”
The pads of John's fingers grope in slow, concentric circles for anything he could use to loosen the bolts. The water is over his chin when a surprised little “Oh” bursts from him with a bubble of hope as his hand bumps into something on its slow path across the ground.
And Sherlock sees it. He understands.
John scowls at the card. “Hang on, Sherlock, did you tell him we were considering Melissa as her name?”
, John. But they have long, long lives.”
The nightmares begin.
Sherlock pondered John’s horrific, incredible information. It felt like finding a geode crystal inside an unassuming stone.
At Sherlock’s insistence, John is given the first feeding. With the floppy little thing cradled against his own bare chest, John nudges the bottle nipple into the babe’s mouth until she begins to suckle. John and Sherlock crow and praise her. Sherlock pulls out his mobile and starts snapping ‘first feeding’ photos. Seeing a thin bar of reception, he immediately sends one to Mrs. Hudson, Molly and her new girlfriend Edith, Harry, his parents, and Lestrade.
John scoops up the boxes with a grunt and heads up the stairs. “Of course he’ll know, but it’ll be touching for him to think that I’m

“Ah. Ta.”
Sherlock sits at the center of concentric rings of paper arranged on the carpet, barefoot in soft pajamas and the indigo-blue dressing gown John gave him three birthdays ago. Eyes skipping between the pages, fingers tented before his lips, a pattern begins to form in his mind’s eye, a half-notion –
“Won’t matter,” she’d said with a wise smirk. “It’ll still feel like home to him.”
“I’m glad you did. I love dancing with you.”
“What? No – she didn’t get

John’s smirk fades. He bites his lip.

“Cheers, yea…” he says, bemused.

“Brilliant.”
Tallack raised an eyebrow at him and grunted doubtfully.
They turned to follow Sparks down a side street, the bright chirps of the messenger birds fading behind them as they worked up to a faster walk. John considered Sherlock sadly, realizing anew how isolated his childhood must have been.
“So this – all this,” John waved his hand vaguely in the air around his head, “is
Sherlock brushed his fingertips over the bare skin of his neck. Though still weak, he could feel his powers singing freely in his veins, no longer a whisper muted by iron.
then, if you’re so keen to drag us into it,” John chuckles. “I like Leander. And that one, from the wood elves…”
He peers at Sherrin through the glass tubes and beakers, his prickly layer of protective condescension slipping.
The food distracts them for a while. John’s feet casually pull his toward him and stay entwined for the rest of the meal. With an effort, Sherlock shifts his attention away from the twenty or so places on John’s body he’d like to bite, to the words he is actually saying.
Sherlock’s hand impulsively moved to John’s face, patting the stiff, brushy mustache appreciatively. “It’s brilliant – it’s as if you’ve always had it.”
John chuckled. “You forgot,
“Hush. It’s lovely.”
John woke first, the smell of old cedar and someone else’s laundry soap sharp and strange in his nose, the smooth sheets patterned with ivy tangled all around Sherlock, facing away from him and breathing deeply with sleep.
“Course you could. I consider it an investment in the arts.” He claps the notes into Chen’s hand and folds his fingers over them. “Can’t be easy to afford so many classes and your share of the rent on your present income. Juggling two jobs at the moment, aren’t you? Zappa’s Pizza? Lunch rush?”
“Jesus, Sherlock, to think I invited her to the hospital, after what she’d done… that she
how utterly different you appear,” Sherlock rumbled, the deep voice at odds with the new body. It was bewildering to be looking at this bland stranger, but
“And what if I wanted to be resuscitated, hm?”
“No one sent me. I’ve been trying to talk to you for weeks.” Mycroft approaches him cautiously, taking a scone out of his pocket and pushing it into Sherlock’s hand, then taking off his own jacket to swing over his shivering brother’s shoulders.
He feels his hand tugging Sherlock to him, watches his face struggling between confusion and relief and curiosity.
John storms out of the flat. He lets his feet take him, paying little attention to the turns and crossings as he talks himself through an anger-reframing exercise that’s failing miserably.
“Good thinking, that.” He plunges his stiff hands to the well floor, the slime of algae making him shudder. In this position, the water reaches his throat. He strains to keep his face above it.
His bluster dies out and his voice becomes quiet. “But... it was my contact who made my involvement possible. She shared a great deal of intelligence with me before she, too, was neutralized.” He looks away, undisguised pain flashing across his face. Sherlock thinks back, suddenly, to Sherrin’s joke about Mycroft needing a good shag and has the bizarre vision of him trading secrets between the sheets. He clearly wasn’t the only one having an interesting holiday that ended in shambles.

“You deal with them.” With a disgusted shake of her head, Tobi stalked off.

Sherlock feels his face redden and his stomach do that strange thing, again. He ducks his chin to hide a foolish little grin.
“But the

He takes John’s temperature, checks his blood pressure and pulse, studies his fluttering eyelids –
“Nor I,”
He’d nearly forgotten Kinsey, but now the young private’s shock and hasty retreat made sense. John had literally shoved the ‘crackshot halfblood-finder’ right in front of Sherlock.
. But this is not an access point.”
At the sound of his voice, Sherrin’s head snaps up. He runs to Sherlock. Bracing himself for fists and a roar of rage, he gives a choked cry when he’s seized into a hug.
Sherlock’s work on the serum, now as senior researcher with a considerable team at his beck and call, had been at a fever pitch that spring. It had been John who sat him down and firmly announced that for the sake of all their health, their marriage and their daughter, they head to Sussex. Immediately. Sherlock, fixated on his goal of the first round of human trails, had protested, but John would have none of it.
Following more slowly, John and Sherlock snaked their arms around one another. John gave him a squeeze.
With a huff, John dutifully scraped the pungent paste from his mortar into the simmering soup and marveled as it snapped with white sparks.
He sucks in his breath. “You didn’t know me.”
changes.”
The nurse comes in to change John’s IV. Sherlock deduced her yesterday and found her trustworthy. He’s oddly comforted by her quiet black eyes, her arms strong from a decade of healthcare work and raising five children on two continents. He also finds it endearing that she enjoys needlepoint and horsemanship, the clues evident on her fingertips and eyelids and in the musculature of her shoulders and legs. Giving him a little nod, the nurse goes about her work. Sherlock studies her intently, carefully recording everything she does. When he speaks in her native Farsi, she jumps.
“I wanted to.”
“And it will still be. But John… you bear a wound we cannot easily see. I do not believe you are going to heal well here with the memories so present.”
“I’d heard you shout. I woke terrified.”
“So what
Sherlock parks their rented car behind the Inn and they tramp stiffly into the lobby. While Sherlock checks in, he notes John casting an eye at the quiet lounge. The fireplace, crackling against the chilly mountain evening, sparkles on the well-stocked bar. Sherlock raises his eyebrows at him, wondering if John will fancy a pint, but he shakes his head and heads off down the corridor to their room. It’s for the best ­– Sherlock feels grimy with the day’s sweat and dust and wants desperately to shower.
“Let me be blunt. There is a group, powerful and ancient, who has been monitoring you since you were young. Since
In the cab, John receives a text from Mycroft. He blinks at the phone, nonplussed.
John’s eyebrows peak into his forehead.
that explains the limp.”
“You should see the other guy.”
I was lucky enough to hike Crib Goch back in 2007. I was also young and/or stupid enough to have only a fuzzy idea of what I was in for (I was a recent Appalachian Trail thru-hiker and thought myself invincible). Luckily, despite being A Bit Not Good with heights, I managed to get through it with only happy, exhilarating memories. I did what I called, The Gollum Crawl, which is basically scrabbling along on all fours.
Sherlock was burrowed into his pile of leaves, watching the fire thoughtfully. “We should find you more song-spells. I’ve heard of a hidden library in London. We should go.”
, he’d need to make a show of using magic to receive clairvoyant predictions. John reluctantly pressed his palm against the medium’s. His own palm was clammy and hot, the medium’s smooth and cool.
Sherlock waves him away, eyes already locked on his laptop and the string of messages they’d received from Meredith. “I’m fine. You had the worst of it. I can sleep on the train home once the case is done. Take the first shower.”
“Seems a bit much, really.”
The damp, dim little basement flat is gloomy, but he hardly notices as he fills up with the thrill of a chase, all those hours they’d spent lurking behind bins in an alley or bantering in disguise in plain sight, Sherlock playing up his role just to see if he could make John break character, their eyes catching and flashing. This stakeout is foolish, he knows that. Sherlock will likely be livid. But right now, he doesn’t care. He’s feeling reckless and damn but it feels brilliant.
“Buried alive, eh?” He turns the fear into more yelling.
John’s stomach flips.
The well feels like it’s shrinking in around him, the sensation of being buried alive making his breath rapid and shallow. He tries not to think of how much deeper the water might be if the child’s bones had not helped him hold back the flow.
John looked from one vividly green eye to the next for several heartbeats, his stomach writhing with nerves. “Sherlock, I may be mad, but I’ve never felt more sure of anything in my life.”
John stares out the window of their bedroom, eyes unfocused on the brightening day, a torrent of possible moments,
“Yes. Not on a case at the moment.”
“What–”
Sherlock bolts across the parking garage toward the suspiciously idling black car. Wrenching open the car door, he is surprised to find Mycroft inside.
When the gale of breath had passed, John squirmed in salt-stiff clothes that were completely dry and smelled almost sweet. Though he still felt bone-weary, his head was a little clearer.
John’s eyes sparkle in the lamplight as they watch each other.
“No, your thoughts are quite silent.”

. A yell bubbles out of him as he submerges again, sputters to the surface. The ache inside him is raw and horrible as John imagines leaving him behind, leaving him just a grave to talk to.
Sherlock sighed with irritation. “You’re a
John shrugged, warmed by his bluntness. “Well. So. This mural, it shows the Five Skills each doing their part to bring in a harvest on a farm. After the epidemic. You know about the Five Skills, of course?”
“So how much money do you need this time?”
“Yep. There was a
Something warm, wet and sand-paper rough rasped insistently against Sherlock’s cheek, pulling him out of the pool of deep, dreamless sleep.
“Then neither do I.”
Sherlock thought to him a little archly.
Sherlock looked away. “Not as such.”
“What did you bring?” Sherlock asks breathily between snogs.
Many thanks to my incredibly helpful beta shirleycarlton
“I thought you said this bastard headache would go away after twenty minutes.”
As their eyes met, John cleared his throat and limped over to the teapot. Puzzled, Sherlock pulled his attention back to their host, having quite lost the thread of her tale. He scowled, realizing she was
“Captain, not lieutenant.”

Thanks to everyone for your kudos and comments!
at these kinds of exchanges, the mating rituals and proper banter. I panicked when it seemed you might be interested in me.”
Sherlock lets the tears fall, lets his chest shake with sobs.
Sherrin slams his hand into the steering wheel, biting back a curse, but he shakes his head quickly.
John shrugged. “I’ll get out what I can.”
The nurses come and go. John loses track which is which as they monitor the baby’s temperature, administer a vaccine, bring papers to be signed, and ply the new fathers with water and vending machine food.
Without hesitation, John breaks into a dash beside him.
He pursed his lips in thought. Could be useful, considering his new predicament. He gave a decisive nod, strode to the tent, and lifted the flap.
“Nice of you to notice. Been some trouble, that. I blocked the pipe. Slowed it down.”
“What do you mean?”
He takes in Sherlock’s wrecked state, the makeshift lab, the room incongruously well-equipped with nursing supplies.
He watches, terribly enthralled as the camera slams into the ground, grass and stones sliding past, the mountains spinning upside down. Scree and grass obscure the view, but not John’s cursing, high-pitched and terrified.
“Good to be home.” John sighs. “What a–”
“We’re watching a

Sherlock gives him a small, contrite smile. “Into battle, then.”
“Then
They are silent for several heartbeats.
Sherlock says quietly. “Welcome back. Human trial, #1.”
John goggles at him.
His eyelids drooped heavily as he watched the layers of aspen leaves quaking overhead. The longer he watched, the more it seemed like they were dancing a sort of
He passes him a fork, balances the dish on their legs, and they dig in. After a few bites, John squeezes his eyes shut.
Standing in the center of the room, which was kitchen, bedroom, and workshop, William could reach just about everything, though it would have taken Sherlock a quick jog to reach either side.
“Breakfast?” Sherlock quips, suddenly vaulting naked from the bed, draining John’s mug and picking up his own as he walks toward the kitchen.
Using the smoke, she drew a spiraling pattern above Sherlock’s body, then turned and, to John’s surprise, wafted the smoke around him as well.
Sherlock’s cheeks redden, his scowl falling away. He blinks rapidly.
John steps out of the elevator into a spacious multi-level suite that is both spartan and pompous, all ebony angles and stainless steel. Janine bounds over and squeezes him into a hug he half-heartedly returns.
Sherlock begins to pace through the leaves.

, trying to mash the ache deep out of range, deep in the catacombs with his rage for his employer. It’s safer for Victor to be far, far away from him, better for the organization to think he isn’t a pressure point.
John’s words are abruptly cut off as Sherlock swoops in, snogging him hard, Melissa trilling delightedly on his hip.
“You were deeply asleep, John, no need to apologize. You weren’t aware of your actions.”
like that,” Chen says with wide-eyed awe as he holds a wad of cotton to his nose.
“In the morning. The ridge will be shut down for just the one day, so we’ll have the trail to ourselves.” He suddenly launches off the bunk, palms off the overhead light, and settles back onto his own, typing furiously on his laptop again. “Get some rest, John, we need to start as soon as we arrive.”
In the quiet of their bedroom, the too-loud sound of Mrs. Hudson’s telly drifts up from below.
Scratching his scalp sleepily, Sherrin suddenly snaps awake.
Sherlock’s stomach drops. He breathes an extravagant sigh.

Mrs. Hudson gave him a tired, knowing smile, but before she could answer, Sherlock began to shake with another coughing fit.
The bird hopped nearer, so close that Johnny could see the iridescent green shimmer in its feathers. Johnny wondered if it were a transformed Faerie, trying to tell him some secret. His mum would have crossed her arms over her apron and stoutly told him to
Sherlock joins them, placing Lestrade’s drink by his plate.
Clearly John’s shield hadn’t gone up soon enough. He sighed. “Don’t be sorry, you got us away. We’ll figure it out. Let’s just get through the night, yea? I’ll keep watch.”
Sherlock ducks behind the paper to hide his flushed grin.
John grins sleepily at his logistical ramble, obviously a cover for a strong emotion.
“Sure,” Sherrin continues affably. “Bet you get picked on mercilessly at school, kids are right wankers about that sort of thing. But it’s the ‘90s for chrissakes.” He gesticulates widely with his pipette. “People’ve been gay for as long as there’s been two dicks to rub together. Be proud of it.”
Sherlock is quiet a moment, his pen suspended over the page. “Nor I. We’ll figure it out. Lineage doesn’t tell the specific story. The child can hear of its mother’s Welsh great-great grand-mother and not know its own mother was an assassin.”
He sighs, running his hands up John’s back. A kiss pressed against Sherlock's chest slides over his nipple. He inhales sharply and clutches at John’s hair as he climbs very smoothly between his legs.
I can’t believe they used that ridiculous drawing from my circus playbill.”
“You’re
He dropped his hand and flew on in silence.
Sherlock responded quickly, his fingertips buzzing lightly on John's temple.
After several long moments, John eases up from the floor, pulling away from Sherlock’s massage. He slides up next to him on the sofa, wrapping him in a tight hug that Sherlock had not expected. Face buried against his chest, Sherlock eases them down until they’re both laying on the couch. Sherlock pulls the blanket over them, his own internal spring releasing with the weight of John on his chest, their breathing gradually synchronizing.
John nods. “Thank you.”
John was about to protest, then realized it was unlikely that an ex-circus slave had his own money. He sighed and dug into his inner pocket, amazed that their contents had not sunk into the Thames or been altered during his transformation.
“No key, looked,” John murmurs against his shoulder. Now that he has something to rest on, the weariness has flooded him and he lets his eyes slide closed. “Don’t s’pose you brought your lock pick.” He is surprised to feel Sherlock’s chuckle deep in his chest, rumbling against his own.
Outside the bedroom door, he finds a tray on the floor holding a cold pot of tea and a covered dish that smells of curried chicken. He gives it a small smile. Though his stomach growls traitorously, he steps past it, returning minutes later from the bathroom with a basin of soapy warm water, a soft sponge, a clean towel, and a change of absorbent pants for John. He settles his nursing gear by the bed and considers John for several moments, fingers nervously tapping his thighs.
Tossing the photo onto the table, Sherlock digs into the rubble of their bags and clothes in the corner. He roots around impatiently for his magnifying lens, finding it tangled in the side pocket of yesterday’s shorts. He also grabs John’s shirt and closely inspects the tightly woven cloth, the strong scent of sweat and sunblock and
“I want to do this… it’s just… suddenly a lot. Being around so many people. After everything.”
“Yes, well,” the Mary-not-Mary voice responds. “I thought it best to receive the final delivery in person. It was most peculiar that John did not come home tonight.”
he recalls.
When the sleek black car slides up their drive, Sherlock pours Gran another cup of tea, though his hand is shaking as he does it. When the men in dark suits emerge to talk to his mother, he listens with all of his might while Gran monologues about her time as a spy gathering intelligence aboard a British torpedo boat, but the men’s voices don’t carry. Mum’s body language does – her hands fly to her face.
“And they believed
“Not a spark. My wild strengths have proven to be quite selective.”
Suddenly he pushes back from the microscope and slams his fists on the table, the glass apparatus clinking in protest. Dressing gown swirling, he spins out of the chair, knocking it over with a clatter, and strides to the door. Just as he’s about to storm out, he notices John from the corner of his eye, lying ever-motionless in his bed. He freezes, hands pulling at his hair, and stares at him, trying to bring his breathing under control.
he stammers.
who, while perhaps getting an occasional weekend case with John, will only see Rosie for a bit of babysitting when John and the new, already-loathed Mrs. Watson want a bit of a sex holiday or a night off. Sherlock feels weighted down with the sadness of this future.

Sherlock squirms to cast a scandalized look over his shoulder. "I most certainly will not. John, I'm
Lune lowered his head to the rug with a long sigh.
John shot Sherlock a confused look. “Who are the Amethyst Deceivers?”
“I thought,” Sherlock says shyly, “if we cannot be within any kind of proximity to the fetus as it develops in utero, we can keep a kind of awareness of it by tracking its current size with the ridiculous fruit chart from the books.”
“Wait, Sherlock – no!”
“Going to have a beauty of a bruise tomorrow,” he growls.
A patrol car pulls up, lights flashing over the subdued attackers and the young couple huddled by the wall. Before it's even fully parked, the passenger door has flung open, a shrill jeer cutting through the air.
Sherlock’s stomach dropped.
in 1897, as a result of his belief that homosexuals would not be accepted openly in society and must therefore have a means of underground communication.
John’s reverie suddenly snapped. He blinked quickly, coming back to himself with a sharp breath. There were voices in the distance. John froze, realizing with a shock that he’d walked very far from Sherlock.
The only rat exposed to both serums. The only rat that sickened and died.
Lestrade goggles at him.
“Yes. It was… peaceful.”
Sherlock saves himself several fruitless hours of arguing with the doctors by texting the summary of his plan to Mycroft. His response is an immediate
Congratulations on your leap – I have absolutely no idea what that means. Amazing about Gran. Sad, too.
John huffed incredulously. “That was

“Yep,” John whispers, “love you. That’s it. Going to sleep a bit, I think. Be here when I wake up, yea?”

Sherlock grins.
him to come near. He’d never felt that at any patrol or raid during all his years among the Queen’s Men.
Gran’s okay. She tells me these bawdy stories at tea sometimes, it’s terrifically embarrassing because she thinks she’s twenty and I’m just some bloke she’s never met before. But it’s fascinating, too, hearing what her life was like when she was young and crazy and rebellious. She was sad the other day. Hadn’t talked for a while, was really confused. I played my violin for her, I didn’t know what else to do and I had to practice. She started humming along and waltzing around the room, her whole face lit up. When I was done, she looked at me and said, “Oh Sherlock, that was just beautiful.” Later she forgot me again.
“Avery.”
John slides off the edge of his seat, a Cheshire-cat grin on his lips, catching himself on Sherlock’s right thigh just as he had when they’d been drunkenly playing party games, sloppy contented grins on their faces. Where John grabs, little bolts of electricity zap through Sherlock’s skin.
John walks along the sidewalk of his old suburban neighborhood at dusk, carrying two plastic bags of shopping. Inside are the ingredients for that thing with the mushrooms that made Mary’s nausea a little more bearable.
“And thanks to Sherlock, we stayed alive all those years he was dead.” John suddenly glances over Lestrade’s shoulder and scowls. “Sherlock, what are you doing?”
John dove into the cold, foul-smelling water, hands groping vainly for any sign of his companion.
“Look, you need to overstimulate the anterior pituitary gland, get a flood of corticotropin to overwhelm the adrenals and cortex, then generate a wave of cortisol to illicit a fear response from the amygdala. Add some psilocybin to the mix to enhance the content of the nightmares.”
“Well done, Captain Watson,” she says in a steady, military-trained voice.
“No,” Sherlock said bluntly. “I prefer your normal appearance. You’re very well hidden.”
The lift pauses to admit an elderly woman in a blue cardigan. They budge over to give her space and smile politely as she coos at the baby, then studies the two fathers with a too-curious look they are becoming very familiar with.
There is a blur of motion by the bedside table.
, linked with permission from the artist.
“The trace John, oh, don’t you see?” He’s suddenly flushed with excitement. “She’s like a caged predator testing the bars for weakness. She knows we can follow her moves, so she makes erratic jumps. When we’re there to intercept her, she knows we’re still tracking her. By now she’ll have determined that her trace was ingested, will probably have isolated it to the tea and knows it’s only a matter of time before she makes a move and we can’t follow her.”
It was Grandmere who taught him the trick of it, of taking information, an emotion, an experience, and building a place for it in your mind that you could go back to anytime you like.
They had gotten off at Charing Cross. John had missed them immediately. The pieces rattling in his mind had settled.
Mrs. Hudson scowled, then moved to touch Sherlock’s face. John tensed, his hand involuntarily darting to stop her.
And if he couldn’t get the words out, at least he’d bring him along on a case. John had been  rather self-consciously aware of the gun tucked out of sight. He’d taken to carrying it out with him, just in case… in case Sherlock texted, needed him to come urgently.
While they never discussed the content of the nightmares, John was quite proud of the phenomenon, telling his therapist how his flatmate had found the tried and true cure. Since moving back to Baker Street, Sherlock had heard him have a nightmare only once, on the second night. For John’s sake, as well as for Rosie sleeping fitfully in her crib, Sherlock had played. John had been soothed. In the four months that followed, he had not heard another. He had begun to hope that John felt safe at the flat.
No, the Wall does a very effective job of keeping us
Sherlock returns the grin. “What do most people say?”
Several minutes later, he stills. The echoes reverberate into silence. The water has risen almost to his knees.
John pretends irritation. “I’ve read it out five times already. Read it yourself if it makes you all weak-kneed and daft.”
with John. This morning’s little domestic can be easily escalated. Anger issues in a father-to-be, well… it is a mother’s prerogative to put the needs of her child first. I imagine that, legal proceedings aside, he would be returned to you and relatively unscathed by the experience within a month. That would give me ample time to initiate the next phase with John under my watch as collateral, should the serum not perform as expected.”
She knelt with a small groan, pressing her face close to the panther’s, nodding and humming, then stood, a hand on her hip as if it ached. She looked at them skeptically. “Lune says you’re to be trusted.”
“What,” John smirks, seeing the imposing car. “No private jet?”
John startled and began reinforcing his mental brickwork. “Did you have no friends?”
The cries of dismay behind him made it clear that the blast hadn’t been the Agents’ doing. Had Sherlock heard him? Flown nearby, unleashed yet another surprising magical ability? But he was so weak!
“Why today?”
Feeling the strength of her emotions receding like a wave, Sherlock finished doing up his waistcoat buttons. He took the levitating bowl, eating where he stood while studying her bookshelf.
“Piss off.”
“You think so?”
“Oh, don’t be like that,” Sherlock waves dismissively. “Practically everybody is.”
like this–” he grins, sliding his fingers into John’s pants and wrapping him in his long fingers. John squeezes his eyes shut and arches into his hand.
It’s a big day. For her 5th birthday, Sherlock had promised to let her run the rats through their new maze. He’d been up very late making adjustments to the serum they’ll be testing. He doesn’t want to hope too much, but as his eyes flick to the framed photo of he and Sherrin, laughing into the camera, his stomach grips with nerves. He’d given the rats their dosage early this morning. He tells himself not to be hopeful, to exhibit detached, even-tempered scientific behavior for Lissa’s sake. And his own.

John reels back slightly in his chair, eyes widening.
“Then you’ll want your

“No, mid-day, but I couldn’t get you to wake up earlier. So, brunch?” He tries to keep his voice light.
“Alright, Sherlock, I know you’re awake,” John scolds warmly. “Come out of that cocoon, or do I need to join you?”
They pushed onward, the fire cat luring them through the dark, quiet neighborhoods. Was it his imagination, or were they
for me.” John ducks his head. “Because. What I said. It’s the same. For you.”
“Idiot,” he mumbles. “Well, let’s see what you do.” Sherlock quickly attaches the electrodes to Sherrinford’s temples and watches the readout on his computer screen, the dull green line suddenly jumping into life as his REM state begins. Sherrinford whimpers in his sleep. Sherlock puts a soothing hand on his shoulder.
John leaned close. “We’re having
“She keeps saying that,” John stage-whispered to Sherlock with a nervous chuckle.
“Thank you for letting us in – I’m John Watson, and this is Sherlock Holmes.” He quailed under her fierce, silent gaze. “Um, my companion is very ill. We need some help, quite desperately–”
. John gave the rope near his face a pinch, just to be certain it wasn’t spun iron. It was sodden jute fiber, sturdy and well-maintained, which meant the exhaustion in his limbs was all his own. Perhaps it was a mundane fisherman up there? But who would eat anything that swam in the Thames?
John’s hands slide from Sherlock’s back to hold either side of his face, precious. His eyes try to swallow him, the way he is now, rumpled, damp from the well, creased with weariness and worry, but bright-eyed, glowing. John’s chest aches with a painful joy.
It was always difficult to tell with Netters, but Lestrade liked to imagine that the grimace and silence indicated Tallack’s embarrassed surprise. The Netters had become so reliant on their mechanical sensors and halfblood-tracking gadgets that they often overlooked vital, humble evidence
Sherlock flings open the door and rushes into the hall to greet her. While he vaguely listens to Sherlock’s dressing-down about not returning her dishes, John sits very still in the rumpled bed and makes himself take long, steady breaths.
“What?” John asks breathlessly.
, I’m probably older than
Molly’s finally gone off somewhere to sleep, demanding Sherlock do the same. He promised he would, just to make her go. Now, though, he sits by John and lists all of his missteps that brought them here, each painful choice he’s made the last three years to keep John safe. And here they are, finally together. He laughs bitterly.
William pursed his lips and whistled a swirl of notes that reminded Sherlock of a meadowlark. A spark from the lantern wick darted up into the air, zipped around the room, then obediently settled on William’s fingertip. The troll smiled warmly at it as he cupped his huge hands around the ember and whispered something Sherlock couldn’t make out.
“Meredith has everything she needs to prove the brother’s innocence.”
Sherlock grins roguishly as he works.
Lestrade was surprised to see General Tallack, one of the highest-ranking Netters in the Queen’s Men, watching the investigation with haughty silence. The headpiece obscuring his skull’s clockwork had been fashioned like the mane and snout of a ram-horned lion. Restless white energy occasionally sparked from the intricate mechanisms connecting dials, knobs and tubing to his chest.
That makes him pause. “She sent you?”
(See the end of the chapter for
John soon had a small fire crackling. He held his hands close to the flames. His left arm, stiff with old traces of spell-petrification, ached in the damp chill as it always did. The warmth of the flames was a blessed relief. He wondered if Sherlock had known.
Sherlock is frozen to the street, the wadded bloody tissue flung aside.
The haven-keeper gave him a stern, searching look, then pulled a sealed letter from her dressing gown pocket. “Alright, then, clever-boots. Without opening it, tell me when I received this.”
,” Sherlock gasps, awed and gaping at the ceiling, “I can’t believe I didn’t see it until now – she’s
“What? When?”
“You see?”
After packing a small bag of his belongings, all scrutinized by an operative, they are released from the house.
Sherlock flinched as he absorbed the violent stream of information. With a cry and crash of leaves, he jolted out of the pile and grabbed John around the middle. John glimpsed the animal panic in his eyes.
“Don’t forget–”
What he has never seen is Sherlock, completely at peace in his sleep, dreaming, naked beneath the sheets, and
They were silver-haired, both handsome in their 60s. He’d felt a little like Sherlock as he’d watched them surreptitiously, reading into the tilt of their bodies (close), proximity of their limbs (thighs touching), their clear history (matching rings, overheard conversation about a nephew’s recent wedding and a much-chuckled-over anecdote about his bed-wetting years). He felt a fierce pang of jealousy for these husbands, for their easy bickering over the Sudoku book, for their gentle and obvious affection for one another.
“I um, hope it won’t spoil the moment, but I have a tremendous need for the loo and... I’m not sure I can stand up just yet. I’d rather not have to use this oversized nappy I just realized I’m wearing.” Sherlock cracks an unexpected bark of laughter, his thundercloud of melancholy receding.
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock exchanged a worried look with John.
Mycroft studies their dad for a moment before slowly bringing the half-smoked cigarette out of hiding. He passes over the silver case and lighter.
Sherlock nodded, wide-eyed, and grinned. “Yes, Doctor. Won’t happen again.”
“Would you?” John croaks, speaking over him in a rush. “Would you really… raise a
“Yea. Victor. Earlier this summer.”
The medium looked puzzled. His hand trembled, then pressed against John’s more firmly.
“Actually, it suited their purposes,” he answers, warily. “John, you must realize that if I had made contact with you, Brook had arranged for no fewer than
“Ah. Well done, Bee.”
“Can’t,” he swallows hard. “Evidence.”
“She’s… close.”
Spluttering, John twists around and gropes through the dark water. A tight metal cuff is sealed around his ankle with a heavy padlock, connected to an arm's length of rusty chain bolted to the floor.
“It’s okay. Take it slowly. You had very little time to process the memories last time before, well, before Mary drugged us.”
“Come on out,” the woman called with swagger in her voice. “We’ve got you, freak!”
John would not meet his eyes, staring instead at a spoon on the table the size of Sherlock’s forearm. “If… if I hadn’t let myself get spell-struck by the bloody Wall, we’d likely have never been found and you wouldn’t have needed saving from drowning
“We’ve been idiots,” John whispers, swallowing hard. “It’s always been between us.
“Bollocks. You’re the fun one. I’m all nap enforcement and vaccine schedules.”
John gives him a wry half-grin, a parting shot of warmth. “I’ll text you in the morning, Sherlock.”
I wasn’t supposed to die.
John shakes the dark thoughts from his mind, finishes up, and emerges to find Sherlock still gently pacing the room, Melissa’s puckered little face just visible in the crook of his elbow behind the pastel-tinted rainbow blanket. His heart clenches fiercely at the sight of Sherlock holding their child, absorbed in her.
“No, actually you’re not,
Lestrade takes a polite bite, then puts down his fork, shaking his head.
“Well done, love, that wasn’t easy. But it was very kind.” He bent down to kiss her damp hair. “Study her a bit, see if you can find something about her you’ll recognize next time.” Lissa squinted at her wriggling frog, turning on her considerable six-year-old powers of observation.
Lestrade frowned. “But how did you get an image of the flyer?”
“Yea…” Sherrin sighs. “Bit more complicated than that, unfortunately.”

“My marriage? Because... oh.”
“So you knew it would be dangerous, but you went anyway?”
Sherlock cracked a smile. “My Grandmother never taught me
“Had you known?”
“So you suspect the crew?”
He eyed the quivering bubble of shield. Could he go through? Would he tear it? The wind certainly blew through it well enough, and the smoke of their fire passed through to the sky. He hesitantly poked it with a finger and found his hand could stretch the delicate membrane and emerge on the other side as if it were a thin layer of water. Feeling bolder, John stepped through. A cool film pulled over his face and snapped off.
“Sure,” John said warily. “But if you’re dreaming, what’s that say about me? I guess
he breaths, the words barely a whisper. John isn’t even sure he’s heard right.
Sherlock takes his time, sipping his lemonade, enjoying this part. He’s saved Sherrinford a dozen times, though it’s always been for some dull lab practical or a term paper.
John smirks wickedly, watching Sherlock’s deductions run and run as he tries to make sense of the shining stainless steel workbench, the shelves of his apiary books neatly arranged in his preferred order, his microscope perched proudly on the bench in front of a comfortable lab stool. All of Sherlock’s chemistry paraphernalia – and several pieces John had Molly help him purchase new so he’d stop nicking them from Bart’s – are neatly organized in rows and on shelves.
What happens if you’ve got
“Very good,” he says quietly. The emotion is quickly suffused and Mycroft returns to his clipped composure. “John, we will require access to your home until the serums are found. At that time, you may return and do as you see fit.”
bendy bits and only nine knobblies.” After several minutes of Sherlock’s continued silence from his desk, John gives up the project and tiptoes behind him to peer over his shoulder.
Sherlock looked stricken.
“No, don’t,” Sherlock whispers into his hair. “John, I– I’ve wanted to be here for you, for this, for such a long time.” His voice is tight with emotion. “It’s… thank you. For trusting me.”
Sherlock stands on the curb holding a bloody tissue to his nose. Blood has spattered his white dress shirt.
He’s at tea with Gran, half listening to her U-boat spy story, half immersed in his mind palace combing the data for errors, when his mum walks in suddenly, her face glowing with relief. Gran looks up, annoyed at the intrusion. Before she can become irate, Sherlock leaps to his feet, begs an apologetic exit, and pushes his mum back through the balcony door.
blocking. But strong emotions push past it. There was such a wave of sadness from you just now. I couldn’t avoid it.”
“What are you–” but Sherlock’s already pulled off and threaded his shirt under John’s arms and around his back, knotting the sleeves tightly to the rope. John feels tenderly bemused as understanding dawns on him. Should he lose consciousness, his head won’t slip underwater. Sherlock tugs on the knots.
Perhaps John will be asleep before it’s even an issue – he’d dozed off on the drive down from Pen y Pass. But it’s too risky. If John realizes, it will crumble the already-shaky foundation they’ve rebuilt since Sherlock’s return.
It’s as if some vital part inside of him, something that was loose and rattling, has settled into its place. It’s the most peaceful he’s felt in, well, in years. His eyelids droop closed, craving a simpler, natural sleep. His mind drifts.
We will leave this Watson-Holmes family, for now. I really, really love this AU. There are so many scenes and stories still untold. Perhaps in time I'll add extra ficlets to the Watson-Holmes scrapbook.

If you’re up for it.” He stands for a too-long moment thinking hard, the effort visible on his face. “Look, I’ll be back in a dash.” John pads off toward the loo, his steps unsteady, then quickly returns, pointing a finger at Sherlock. “Naked. You, now.” He disappears down the hall again
“You say
“We’re late.” They ride in tense silence for many minutes. “So, John was present. Most unfortunate. You did try to keep him away–?”

“Going to have a beauty of a bruise tomorrow,” he growls.
John scowled. “If they don’t much fancy
“’Course you did,” John says, abashed.
“I saw the possibility of the outcome as a favorable one.” Sherlock grins like a cat with a mouthful of canary. “She’s rather spoiled her plan to frame

my pillow. No sleep for me, I’m on a case.” Outside the window, a small river chatters past beneath a lovely old arched stone bridge. Sherlock hopes the sound of the water won’t make him tired. He’s more worn out than he wants to admit.
“A friend’s. A
“John,” Sherlock scowls at him. “I don’t understand. Why aren’t you upset? At all?”
With a lurch of vertigo, John peels open eyes that are sticky and resistant, then squeezes them shut against blinding brightness. Though his body feels as heavy as granite, his heart is racing. Where is the forest? The mad sister?
Sherrin stares ahead, horrified.

“Go fast, I’m okay for a bit, I think.”
“To my credit, that is not
John catches his breath.
Back along the misty street, he could see Sherlock sagging against the wall. John moved quickly to his side, ducking to get Sherlock’s arm around his own shoulders, then staggered to his feet. Black curls were beginning to sprout from the glamor’s dishwater-brown bowl cut. Sherlock leaned heavily into him, the last of his energy seeming to have drained away completely.
“It should be me, who confronts her tonight,” John bursts in without preamble. Sherlock looks up from his phone, brows knit in a frown. “Not you, Sherlock. She’ll kill you on sight. But me… I feel strongly that I may be the only chance we have of catching her off guard, however briefly.”
His throat constricts. The burning is behind his eyes, sudden and insistent. Sherlock curls into himself, buries his head in his knees, and shakes with sudden, wracking sobs.
Sherlock relented, eager to move past the awkwardness.
“Merfolk?” John breathed.
“It’s Lestrade. Did you text him we were coming home?
“Don’t want to get dizzy out here, John. And it’s hardly a case. This is a
“Husbands.”
At least ten more operatives are swarming through the house, looking through cabinets and under furniture, behind framed photos and under the insoles of trainers.
He feels an uneasy twinge—what has Sherlock gotten himself into?
Without warning, the magnetic tug between them stuttered out. John instinctively clung to Sherlock and saw in a sickening instant that something was very wrong with him – his face had gone slack, eyes rolling, arms loose by his sides. The wind roared in John's ears as they plummeted.
Sherlock nods, filing the data away on a mental chart.
“See? Lock that one up in your mind palace.”
“Oh. Um. Right. Good.” Relief floods through him.
John feels like he’s woken from a fevered sleep with the flu. Sherlock scoops him up from under his arms and props him against the pillows—
“Snowdonia!” Sherlock erupts, unable keep it in a moment longer. “Murder case.
“What on earth would we do without you?” John hums sleepily.
Sherlock grinned a challenge at him. “Don’t pretend you didn’t immediately feel the same thing. You’re rubbish at hiding your feelings.”
Two doors down the hall, Rosamund is laboring. He tries very hard not to imagine what must be going through her mind as she strains to bring forth a child she will never know. Then he thinks about all the horrors she has put them through. The pang of sympathy wanes.
“You were standing in the center of the ridge,” Sherlock says, focused on his work. “I saw you looking through the camera. You must have backed up too far when you were taking that panorama shot. It would have been easy to lose your footing going backwards if you weren’t expecting the slope.”
. It sits raw and new and fragile in their trembling hands. He can’t shake the feeling he would get as a child when he’d catch some small, brilliant wild thing and know he had to let go for its own good.
He nudges next to John in the doorway, dropping their shared suitcase with a huff.
“Amazing, really,” John muses around a yawn, scratching his scalp sleepily, “how a little music works so well to ease her nightmares, and mine. Maybe she’ll sleep the night through, now.”
He stands gratefully in the spray of hot water, breathing in steam. Though his muscles ache, he’s too tired for a bath. The thought of

“Billy,” Sherrin whispers against his ear, “listen… I know they’re doing this to me. I know they’re
“What…”
Thank you all so much for your kind comments and enthusiasm for these new chapters. It's so exciting to finally share this larger story with you.
, enough dawdling!” Sherlock’s eyes sparkled with feverish mischief as he suddenly tugged John onto the street with the eagerness of a puppy.
She ignores him, her eyes on the monitor as the baby’s cries become hiccupy. Melissa has never gone this long before without one of them coming to her aid. It twists John’s heart.
Silence stretched on. He peered into the dim light cast by a shuttered lantern the size of a dustbin. Through his fear, he noted that the cover was punctured in a delicate pattern of stars.
John’s stomach twisted. “I didn’t know they could do that,” he muttered.
Sherlock, it’s unbecoming. I’ve been handling half of your obligations from the sidelines while you’ve been scuttling around the globe chasing demons. Your single-minded obsession with overseeing the destruction of John’s assassins has me in mind to compare you to your predecessor.”
John grimaces and hisses through his teeth. Sherlock’s face plummets into worry. “What is it what do you need? Oh -oh right yes hang on -” and he reaches gingerly over his chest avoiding tubes and pushes the little box into John’s groping hand.
Sherlock had reasoned. John has not articulated it, but he knows they both fear the baby being anywhere near Rosamund without them.
“But I’ve never heard it through you. Your Gollum voice positively gives me chills.”
. I put a hand on your shoulder, tried to wake you, called your name, but you were lost.”
“Sit,” he orders gently, ensuring John obeys by easing the dozing Melissa into his arms. Sherlock squeezes next to him, holding him tightly, as much of his body touching John’s as possible.
PSSS Yes, Mrs. H baked butter biscuits the day before, which John found before his first visit to the haven forest, so the cinnamon biscuits are not the *first* thing she's baked since they arrived. (These are the things that occur to me while I'm driving...) So when she says she hasn't had an excuse to bake in a while, it refers to her behavior since they arrived. And picture this: the morning before, after getting to know John and helping with Sherlock's Expunge, she goes down to her flat (thoroughly knackered), *and magically whisks together a batch of butter biscuits for the two bedraggled new lodgers upstairs.* <3 <3 <3
It takes more than Netters to send me scuttling. Believe me, gentlemen, they won’t track
Sherlock looked John in the eye, his words suddenly coming in a breathless tumble. “Dr. Watson, I’ve been waiting for a chance to escape for five years – and
to me?”
“I’m so sorry I worried you. I’ve been in such a fog. She’s been crying for hours at a time, tiny fitful naps in between  – finally crashed after a feed. She missed you.”
Sherlock frowns, but doesn’t object. He’s grateful for the warmth and his stomach gives an uncomfortable lurch of hunger. He takes an enormous bite.
John had certainly protected him valiantly, but Sherlock wasn’t certain the feeling was mutual.
His stomach clenches. He takes another step back, but she swoops close, threading her arm though his. He goes rigid at her touch.
“I am under the impression that she is working entirely independently, pursuing her own vendetta against me. The Magpies dissolved after her father’s death.”
“So, til next time.”
The lean head bobbed its bowl-cut in approval.
A minute nod.
Well, you must be on the mend. This is an honor.”                        And though he’s given Sherlock hell before about the damn tea, he can’t stand that she’s mocking him. He bristles, but catches himself. God, he’s been so tightly wound lately. He watches her sipping the tea, his

is where your mind wanders?”
Sherlock waved his words away. “My family hid me. The Faerie reject me. The first halfblood I met enslaved me. If he hadn’t, I’d have been caught by the Netters, who would have done much worse.” He looked steadily at John. “Decent people are hard to come by.”
Sherlock bends down to pluck a blade of grass and chews it thoughtfully
John sinks into silence, pressing his face into Melissa’s soft, sparse hair, letting Sherlock answer their questions. Once their information is provided, they are left alone.
“Have you ever been to London?” Sherlock asked quietly.
Sherlock sets the carton of mango sticky rice onto the table with a decisive slap. John, sucking noodles off of his soup spoon, looks up with wary expectation. Now that it’s here, really here, his mouth goes dry. Sherlock looks down into his lap. John groans with exasperation.
John immediately dumps Sherlock’s delivery and his messenger bag on the floor of the entryway and rushes into the flat.
“Of course, of
“John, Rosamund was by far the greatest threat to your life. I was on a plane that night and in London the next day. I had to find you in the safety of a public place – I had no idea what she was capable of.”
“Sherlock!” John snaps.
could trust?
Sherlock blinked. “Really?”
John’s eyes snap up to meet Sherlock’s, stricken, pieces clicking into place.
He could hear the quick footfalls of the three older boys behind him. Johnny peered at the grey sky ahead, but it was empty.
John wound his way back to medium’s striped tent, the clamor of the circus jarring his nerves. He pressed his ear to the canvas, but the crowd was too loud to make anything out. He gave it up, turning to see a young hawker in a bell-covered tunic jingling by. She wore a portable tray bearing a copper pot, paper cones, and several jars.
He leans against Sherlock and feels him lean back, which sends an effervescent ripple through his stomach. It steadies him. He is safe.
Let’s just go to sleep.”
What else would you do when your sons have nearly escaped murder and kidnapping?
“It’s taking too long.”
“Didn’t you see the papers yesterday morning?”
This 600-year-old arrangement had been part of the Secret Seas Peace Agreement of 1201, penned by Queen Eleanor of Aquitaine after her new armada had mysteriously sunk without storm or enemy to blame. Before the Agreement, halfbloods had imprisoned, executed, and often hunted for sport.
“Indeed.” He gazes softly at John who goes about cleaning up the mess, his eyes flicking up to him every few moments. Each glance feels like sparks.
“Why.”
“I’ll be more careful,” he mutters, abashed. “I’ve been worried about you as well.”
“Oo, we’re a bit outnumbered, love.”
“Yes. They were systematically sinking the Queen’s fancy new armada, out of revenge, you see. She had no choice but to comply.” Mrs. Hudson’s eyes sparkled.
Mary gives John a quick peck on the cheek as he tidies up the last of the home-rental medical equipment. She watches him for a moment, then drifts into the kitchen to greet Sherlock. John can hear them chatting amiably, Mary asking after his treatments, how he’s feeling, is the pain very bad these days?
growled the Netter. “He’s a bloody Queen’s Man!”
Pulling up to the curb, they swiftly change gears from the long, meditative drive into the flurry of unpacking the car. John is sure to give Sherlock the task of handling Melissa as he grapples with a heavy suitcase. Sherlock had cut his thumb rather badly pruning the raspberry canes before they’d left, and John is enjoying babying him a bit.
. My sister thought I was crazy. But
To Sherlock’s surprise, Mrs. Hudson reached out and gently grasped his hand. “Welcome home, halfblood,” she said with somber warmth. “Starting today, you learn to survive, and I’ll fatten you up while we’re at it.” She squeezed his hand. “There’s plenty of time to learn glamors. Breakfast, first.”
John wakes to the insistent insect buzzing of Sherlock’s mobile on the bedside table. It’s early dawn, pale light just beginning to turn the shadows of the bedroom into soft greys and purples.
“Boyfriends, blokes I’ve shagged,” Sherrinford shrugs. “Not all of them serious, but all of them
“We are speaking of the same man? The one who liked to strap C4 to grannies?”
John’s mind spun. “Just before I fled, I learned she’ll be making it mandatory that the entire Wall Guard become assimilated into Netters. Could it have anything to do with that?”
put her in there she screams bloody murder!”
John blinked awake and flinched away from him, sitting up abruptly. Sherlock’s heartbeat pounded in his ears.
“Yes.”
Sherlock whispers.
John chuckles. “We were. Made a good start of it that weekend, though. I remember we’d planned to sleep on the train home the next night,” John says with a twinkle as he sits up. He wipes his face and their bellies dry on Sherlock’s discarded T-shirt, then settles back against his chest. “But instead we found out you’re quite the insatiable top.”
John’s rhythm with the pestle faltered. “Hold on, did you dream of our flight, as well?

Scowling at the screen, John shouts, “Since when do you eat on a case?”
He can feel it now, for a moment. Yes, things are still dire, it’s been fucking terrifying for months – years, really – he was so rarely in control. But now, at least, Mary is no longer the cuckoo in the nest with her fingers around John’s throat, playing Sherlock like a puppet. The cuckoo flown is something to chase, to trap. And he will find her. He has absolutely no doubt.
“John, it was,” Sherlock says quickly. “When you came here that day, I admit, I wanted to drive you away. For your safety.” John frowns at him. “But then I saw the opportunity. I took a chance. I hoped you would follow and witness the exchange, but not by my invitation. If Mary found out…”
“I remember
John shook his head, marveling. “When I was a boy, my schoolmate Jonas was taken. His whole family, actually.” He shook his head, hardly daring to hope. “Are you saying that all this time, he’s been on the run behind the

the very instrument of his magic, made him feel ill. But ten years hiding in plain sight among Faerie-hunters had given him flawless camouflage. He smiled affably. “Cheers, Private, but it’s more of a young man’s pursuit. Bit past my prime for scaling up buildings.” He steered Kinsey by his shoulders toward the medium’s tent. “You, on the other hand, have a brilliant future ahead of you. Why don't you go in and get a glimpse?”
Kinsey’s eyes were riveted to the performers. “Wouldn’t mind it so much if they looked like that.”
John dutifully slumped his shoulders and cast his eyes down, hoping he gave off the weary air of a steam-

“I wish I’d known you when you were fifteen.”
“John,” Sherlock says hesitantly. “When we return, will you join me in the bedroom downstairs?”
me, how long was I out? And —” His eyes grow wide as they take in Sherlock. “Ohh no, no-no-no, what did those bastards make you do?
Sherlock grimaces. “Nearly. I named Mycroft my regent when I left to find you last year. He has been acting in my stead. They welcomed him. He could easily become the next Moriarty, after a tedious day’s paperwork.”
John blinks rapidly as he digests this information.
When the doorbell rings, he leaps up and thunders down the stairs before Mrs. Hudson can answer. He opens the door to find…

“Let’s just rest here a moment,” John tried to say casually, though his mind filled with a fresh swarm of worries. “Just sit, get your breath back.”
“Oh bloody hell,” John groans, holding his chin where Sherlock’s jaw has cracked it.
Johnny had never seen a Faerie or the Wall. In all its thousand years, the Wall had

Wow and thank you! It's perfect!
John shrugs, smile fading. “Nothing, actually, never told anyone. Not even my therapist. Not many to tell, honestly.”
John blinks, turning sharply toward Sherlock and scowling.
Sherlock grins at him, his pirate chemist brother, but there is sadness behind his mask.
“Yes,” he grins at his feet. “Quite so. We have a lot to tell you about. Will you stay for a bit? I’ll help you gather up what you need – it must be all over the flat…”
“Nah, I’m knackered. Let’s just go home.” Sherlock nuzzles the top of his head quietly.
“Oh. Right. But, you never traveled here as a child?”
“Am I allowed to work, doctor?” Sherlock crooks an eyebrow at him.
He looks wonderingly at Sherlock.
