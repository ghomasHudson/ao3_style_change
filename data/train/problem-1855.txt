, back into safety.
When the brunet gave him a questioning look, he merely got a wink in reply.
“I’m…yes, of course I am. I just…”
There was something there. Even if it wasn’t much, it was more than nothing. Yes, he’d been more than happy to have the keen and the shudder subside but at the same time, this eerie quiet was just as worrying.
All of those counted as strong points that if Sherlock was given a chance, then he could do all that he needed to so that John didn’t need to fear for his safety or for his personhood.
“Sherlock, you were a snarling, possessive beast at the time, even if you no longer had wings and a tail. It’s not exactly – “
Clenching everything he had for the briefest of moments, Sherlock firmly, almost harshly, reminded himself that he couldn’t afford these kinds of doubts right now. He didn’t doubt John and he wasn’t going to believe Moriarty, even if he did have a few facts.
He swallowed hard, with determination, and managed to get the lodged rock down, at least enough so that he could speak again.
Footsteps to indicate that he was on the move. “Are you listening to me, Holmes?” The idiot still tried to be intimidating and gain the upper hand. It was almost sweet.
Apparently not enough for him to wok out this was what Sherlock had been planning, though, thankfully. Then again, to call it coming from left field for the younger Holmes was an understatement, to say the least, much as he didn’t like to admit it.
“Your instincts were still a factor in reacting, though.”
“Of course, I want you to!” Sherlock snapped. “Don’t start being obtuse out of some misplaced notion of chivalry or whatever it is you think you’re doing. What exactly about all of this gives you the impression that I wouldn’t want you to? That I wouldn’t want to spend all the time I could possibly snatch to have your fingers all over me? Inside of me? My tongue all over you, learning all about the texture of your skin, the smell and taste of it? Whether there’s a difference between my human tongue and my dragon one? Whether I could wrap the dragon version all the way around your penis?”
No, because he didn’t expect anything to come of it. He didn’t want anything from John because he knew that what he’d wish for would never happen, he couldn’t expect it nor should he, and he was more than happy with what they did have.
As he made sense of the thing in front of him, which for one thing was a person rather than an object, things started to come back to him, not quite in a flood but nothing like in a gentle stream, either.
He squashed the thought like someone would their cigarette stub in an argument then tried to remember what came next. Not the argument about it or the feelings associated with it, those were in context irrelevant. Had he taken it or had Sherlock pocketed it again? Both were possible, but…
There was no hesitation in the answer. “I did.”
, he finished in his thoughts.
Sherlock looked at him, eyes slightly narrowed as he did so. No doubt deducing him.
Oh, what had he ever done to deserve John Watson? Well, short answer, he didn’t deserve him but he could damn well do his best to try to make himself worthy. Starting with…not so much banishing the dragon, not this time.
“Have…have I done that often?”
It was kind, sweet, really, of Mycroft to ask him, not once but twice, whether this was something he in fact wanted. Not what Sherlock wanted or needed or what was expected of him but what John would want from this. You could argue that it only brought home that he didn’t actually have a choice in the matter and that was true enough, really, but all that said, he was considered as his own person rather than something connected to Sherlock.
The smile turned more towards something genuine again.
“I am just a doctor.”
Fear and anxiety, he could spot buried deep beneath those, as well as the hope and excitement. He could even tell there was a part of the man who was doing the math of the soldier in his head as they walked, trying to find where there might be advantageous spots for them and for the enemy and other such things.
“John?” Sherlock asked a while later.
John wrote again just a few minutes later, ‘We still on for Monday?’ he asked.
In a way, insofar as it was powering the rest of its body, but for what he needed to achieve he didn’t need the heart. Not that the hearts of dragons were exactly the centre of their beings, in a metaphorical sense. If it had been, it would have rotted away from neglect long ago. Both the heart and the dragon.
Perhaps – no. To invite the high in and let it shut out and push away the rest of the clamour might seem to be a good idea but the risk that he wouldn’t be able to shirk it when he reached the exit was too great a one to take, and he was not bringing it with him. Not for anything would he allow that.
As soon as he let go of it, he stepped back to wrap John up completely, without even bothering to see where it landed; as long as it landed in the water, or indeed, so long as it was off and away from John, he didn’t care.
He didn’t go so far as to hold her out as though she was some sort of doll that they’d promised they’d share equally, and it was more than John’s turn. In a sense, there was some truth there, but that was the end of it, and should be, too.
If you could achieve that, then it would be much easier to keep them, if and when they managed to get a child secured, from talking to anyone about how they had managed to have a child.
“Well?” John asked. “What is it?”
Would it be too soon for John? After all, they had only been together for a year.
It was more that…yes, that was a benefit but to extract that, to harness it somehow, what would be the sacrifice that would take? When did that sacrifice become justified other than never truly? Also, what side effects would occur? How could they make certain that said healing factor didn’t come with a side order of the less…helpful dragon traits? And that was thinking only of if it worked, which was quite a major ‘if’, not to mention getting a dragon to cooperate or subdued enough that they could take by force, of course.
Sherlock’s eyes widened a few fractions all on their own at that.
“Come on, now,” he said, and he wasn’t aware that his voice was a whisper. “We’ve got it out. You’re safe, love, it’s okay.” Nor did he notice his term of endearment.
But surely, that couldn’t be it? Why would that have any significant impact on him, on them? Granted, it wasn’t as though his knowledge was great on the subject, to say the least, but even so, it didn’t seem like it would matter that much.
John understood perfectly fine why he didn’t disclose the whole story; it wasn’t exactly the type of tale you relayed over the afternoon tea, not with harems being now illegal in the country, and the treatment by the general public of their ‘members’, whether current or past, tending towards scorn, moral superiority and contempt. Bringing it up wouldn’t be doing either of them any favours.
Which was a completely ludicrous, fanciful thought. Madman though he may be, Moriarty wasn’t exactly a fairy tale monster. They didn’t exist, after all.
Sherlock shook his head, though not too much. “That’s not it.” He paused to consider. “Actually, it is, but not for the reasons you might think.”
Looking at Sherlock then, though he didn’t otherwise show it, his eyes gave his emotions away, even for only a moment.
“That is rather the point of all this.”
“I do,” Mycroft interrupted, voice soft and warm. He stepped close to Sherlock, who allowed it, and said something to him, so quietly that John had no chance of hearing, even not being very far away.
“You are making sure that no more can get in there than already is. What has already been absorbed, we will deal with afterwards.”
“Sort of.”
He realised he’d zoned out a bit when he blinked again and Sherlock’s worried face came back into focus, distractingly close.
One came from the laptop while the other came from Sherlock’s phone.
It was certainly better than some of the options that had been chosen by their fellow students. Not that Sherlock knew the names, but then he didn’t need to.
“I’ll start when you do.”
John’s voice softened further. “This is your brother. Your baby brother, whom you’ve helped, protected and loved throughout your entire lives, even if neither of you will bloody well admit it to anyone else. I saw and heard you earlier when you got here, remember?” He didn’t quote him because he knew he remembered. “He needs these, now. Please?”
He let go of the other’s hand, quickly so he couldn’t change his mind, and turned around, ready, or as ready as he’d ever be, to walk away. He’d prefer being able to go straight to the roof for some time alone, to get his head and heart back in order, but he knew he’d be expected to go and talk to his parents and endure the comments from Mycroft.
As he gradually got nearer – a quick jab at it would run the risk of alerting it far more than a slow approach, the movement sensed where his presence might not, due to him being it and vice versa – the energy coming off it felt progressively stronger and more oppressive. It was as though it was trying to browbeat him into submission while at the same time, also trying to seep in and convince him that he was better off with the dragon in charge. That he’d let it lie dormant, suppressed and muzzled, for far too long, and just look where it had gotten him.
John blinked. Then he huffed, which turned into a smile. “Of course, it is, you idiot. As often as you want to.”
“Yes, of course. Has my brother claimed you yet?”
This hadn’t been a good idea to begin with. Yes, so he’d been angry at Sherlock for his comment, for his whole demeanour regarding the case and other people in particular. He still was, in the back of his mind as other emotions had taken the driver’s seat, but the anger hadn’t been born purely there, had it? Nor was it the first time he’d reacted with anger at it or had stormed out.
“Suppose not. Can’t have the cake and eat it, too, as it were, and if you don’t eat it, it’ll just rot. What does he collect, then?”
“Stay here,” he said, his voice quiet but earnest and slightly pleading. “Please. I won’t be long. Just stay here and rest.”
Out of the corner of his eye, the doctor saw the lanky, half-dressed body lunge towards him, eyes wild and face contorted, and he tried to speed up his movement, to will his limbs to go faster, faster.
All his parents would say about the subject when he’d asked was that the shift was magical in nature and thus physical barriers wasn’t such an issue.
“I guess the whole ‘needing to collect things’ rather than doing it out of interest has to be a something of a drawback, too.”
However, Sherlock was willing to partially excuse that as the man having genuine difficulty recalling, his mind not quite ready to deal with it, which in turn was easier to accept. Not because of the tears, quiet or wailing, but because of the scent he gave off.
“When?”
“Pardon?” The ginger’s voice sounded a little far-off itself. Had he not noticed John had…well, if he hadn’t, there was no need to tell him.
“John…” It seemed that his vocabulary had deserted him, hopefully merely for the moment.
He looked at the thing, almost unable to believe that it was there. Or perhaps more accurately, that it was still in one piece and that he still felt about it as he did. Not only in terms of the dragon and its instincts, either.
If he could just get to Moriarty, then –
“Yeah, ta for that.” The slight tightness in the voice was one that he couldn’t quite quash, however.
No, there had to be something he could do.
“Yes. I saw.”
John blinked at the outburst, then frowned, puzzled and just a little bit wary. Which, while not something Sherlock could blame him for, wasn’t something that he liked to see, either. Even less so when it was something he was to blame for and that he’d even predicted himself.
Sherlock’s face scrunched up in surprised confusion. “What do you mean, ‘wrong’? It’s the only possible solution with the criteria you’ve laid out.” John only continued to smile. “You can’t go changing who the culprit is in the middle of the game, John.”
To add insult to injury, his parents and his brother had decided to come early and watch most of the performances, too.
It was evident that the blond still didn’t believe him, which perhaps wasn’t surprising. Even so, Sherlock wasn’t best pleased with it, and not because it meant that he had a more difficult time of it when he thought about it compared to when it didn’t.
“No,” Sherlock conceded. “It’s not.” He noticed with some hope and relief that John still hadn’t removed his hand. Taking a quick, deep breath himself, he reached out in turn to touch John’s cheek, gently, almost hesitantly. The doctor allowed it, even if he didn’t turn to look at Sherlock.
Sherlock waited, just slightly impatiently, for that experiment to be over with. It took an unreasonable twenty minutes.
Hah. Innate connection. It was all biology, nothing more.
No, wait. That wasn’t right. It’d fit if it’d been Mycroft who’d chosen the clinic for them – never mind that Sherlock hardly would’ve have accepted his brother being high-handed in a situation like that – but for Sherlock, that wouldn’t be something of interest to him.
about those days and while no, John didn’t expect Sherlock to suddenly remember each and every birthday or other day of note, he had hoped that he would at least acknowledge their milestone.
That was what big brothers were for, wasn’t it?
Only, not quite. It was hairline fine but it was still present and gave the quiet indication of something breaking along the line.
As they rode in the cab back to Baker Street, Sherlock could tell his bond mate was still uncomfortable, not only with the money spent, regardless of what they’d talked about earlier, but the whole experience with what some would call the ‘normal’ world, and he couldn’t help wondering whether he ought to have handled it better.

Tessa.
“But you, you just bulldozed right over me. “
“Well, yes, technically, I suppose.” John paused, then decided to take advantage of Sherlock’s momentary distraction and nudged him again.
“What do you mean?” Sherlock asked.
John frowned. “I don’t. Yes, okay, so I flirt. There’s no harm in that. Some flirting can double as banter, too, or banter can look like flirting. That’s not the same as saying I want to get in the pants of every woman I meet.”
“Thank you,” he said. He was quiet for a moment while his expression, still soft and warm with that something Sherlock couldn’t identify, slowly gained a hopeful nervousness as he moved closer still until his face became disjointed features.
‘The idiocy of public school struck again with lights out and one of the prefects is a petty, power-hungry rat with mummy-issues that will only grow when she leaves his father for her two lovers, and he doesn’t like being told that. So, he’ll use any excuse to try and assert dominance, which is laughable. – SH’
Did he even want a cake to cut?
“I’d – I’d never – I thought you wanted shot of me!” Sherlock finally manged to blurt out. This was turning upside down and all wrong, despite his efforts to do things right.
Her foster parents. Adoptive parents? Whichever.
He thought he felt Sherlock stiffen at his slip-up.
“Sherlock, are you sure that you know what you’re doing?” Mycroft asked and the concern was to be found in his voice as well, which was even more disconcerting and not entirely welcome.
He felt himself shrinking, fading slowly away as the dragon grew more solid, seemed to stretch itself larger all across the areas it occupied. If this carried on, he would, in fact, end up –
He was prepared.
That said, the blond could empathise. He certainly could do without knowing any details about Harry’s sexual exploits, much less the result of it, regardless of what secondary gender she’d presented as. It wasn’t gender issues, it was simply the fact that they were siblings and there were some things you’d rather not know. Or imagine.
It let out what could only be described as a screech as it continued to pull and now also rip at the continuously expanding threads. They weren’t moving quite as quickly as at first but there were still threads spreading despite the best efforts of the dragon.
“But it does happen, and quite often, at that.” He saw the other nod, without caveats. “Good. I didn’t do that this time, that is true, but my brain…it was more than ready to start right back up where it’d left off, dragon or not. That I’m remotely calm and rational like this, that is your doing. Your presence, your approach.”
“Well, yeah,” John agreed. “But context makes a huge difference, doesn’t it?”
The doubts, fears and utter panic over what to do and how it’d be received hadn’t disappeared either, and he didn’t think they would. Not even if he didn’t go through with it at any point, ever, unfortunately.
Sherlock blinked at him, thrown a little by the unexpected accuracy of the otherwise trite cliché. Then he nodded.
“I – “
He wanted to live, dear god did he, but if there were no more possibility for that, then he’d die as much as himself as he could.
“Precisely.”
Whatever had been good from that life had in any case been allowed to follow him into this new and better life. The one that had John in it. Their family in it.
Remembering he’d been asked a question, he nodded. “Yes. It’s part of my…but it doesn’t…I don’t want to take it back immediately. Don’t want to, to take it back at all.”
Foregoing a meal for the moment, John sat down next to him.
“I don’t know,” he said, answering the question that hadn’t quite been addressed to him. “I certainly didn’t win the pools or something. If it’s a scam, which is at least a possibility, why pick my account? Why go for that amount? It’s too large to be a viable test amount but too small to have any kind of real value if whoever’s responsible is going for it, either as a scam or a laundering scheme. But that leaves very little else that is feasible.”
Even if he couldn’t fly, couldn’t use aerial surveillance to locate him, there was not only the surveillance that Mycroft could provide, if he felt inclined to help his baby brother rather than an ex-RAMC officer and the odds of that were not in the doctor’s favour. There was also just the simple fact that this was Sherlock Holmes he was dealing with. Even if that wasn’t the case, if the person had given way to the instincts completely, there was likely other ways available to dragons.
Much as he couldn’t lose John…he could, and he shouldn’t be a weight around his neck. An albatross, some useless part of his brain informed him.
His dry comments, his quiet grumblings their own little tune in the quietness of the flat. Turning things around endlessly just to get Sherlock to eat or sleep. Stealing the brunet’s shampoo when he thought he hadn’t noticed because he’d run out of his own, but he’d never hear the end of it if he admitted that he had. As if Sherlock couldn’t smell it, without needing to use his dragon senses.
“Surely, that’s confirmation, then.”
The former, they were the oldest, from a time before it was necessary to blend in amongst the cattle to survive for any significant length of time, relatively speaking, and where your hoard was significantly more likely to be the target for opportunistic little louts who thought of…well, who had the same idea as the dragons, really, if we’re being entirely honest. It was merely that they were doing it on a much smaller scale, as it were, the limitations of their size and the time they were allotted on earth, which back in those days were pitifully short.
The last sentence was hissed and was delivered straight into John’s ear. He instinctively tried to pull away, which was helped by the hands still enveloping his face assisting him but halted when he remembered that he was still very much covered in explosives.
For all that he might be hesitant or stumbling at times, especially at times where emotions or other unknown or poorly explored territories and quantities were concerned, he never seemed as though he wasn’t aware of what he was saying.
“It has nothing to do with the hoarding,” he said, needing to clarify. “I just…I like touching you. For you. Because it’s you.”
‘Yeah, thanks, thought of that. There isn’t anything else that fits the criteria. That was what he took without my consent, that I know of, and it’s what fits in the timeline of all this, too. If it’s any object at all, it’s the watch, and so I need to find it.’
Had it been anyone other than you benefitting from it, eh?
“Tell me to appreciate the bond mate I have, apparently, because he’s a good Alpha. As though I need to be told that.”
Another instinct overrode the first, brutally so, and propelled him, after the briefest of glares at his flatmate that was hopefully understood, forward towards the Irishman before he had a chance to think too much about it.
They were towards the end of the program. Not the very last act of the evening, thankfully, he didn’t think he could stomach siting through the
“Sherlock, it really has nothing to do with you being a dragon or me being uncomfortable being near a naked man or whatever else you think it has to do with.”
“You’re far more coherent now than you’ve been since…well, since you went comatose on me. Surely that’s an argument that you’re no longer dangerous to me. Your…your appendages have disappeared, too, so whatever was preventing that is gone, as well. That’s another tick, right?”
He didn’t do it in words, though, not immediately. Instead, he dug into the pocket of the leather bomber jacket he was wearing. In fact, he dug into both pockets, though only pulling out something from one.
He got another squeeze of his hand for that from Sherlock, though he suspected that was more to do with scoring a point, somehow, than anything actually constructive. It’d fit, after all.
Not knowing sent a chill down his spine.
What he had done, despite all the limitations and obstacles he’d faced, had saved her, and the rest of the harem residents, in the short-term and hopefully in the long-term as well, and the fact that it might not be enough did not make it his failure.
‘Oh, god, I think my neo-mammalian complex is about to stage an escape attempt due to sheer lack of stimulation. – SH’
The dragon seemed to have cottoned onto that fact, too; it had tried to move its feet to move itself closer, around the foundations, presumably for another try, only to discover that something had covered one of its feet. Reptilian eyes snapped back down to look at what was the issue, the lips pulling back further when it discovered the source.
The calmness was authentic enough, as was the kind of tension that was, at least in part, fuelling it and preparing the muscles for if something were to happen. Not enough to attract attention from anyone but enough that Sherlock could sense it.
The whole world, or even the entirety of Londoners, might not be that good overall but the mere fact that there were instances and people like this, somewhere towards the high-end, a segment that tended to be steeped in what they’d term ‘tradition’, that brought some hope and warmth back into him.
Plug all potential leaks, as it were. He had to, whatever it would take, sort this out.
“Yeah, sorry,” he said quietly, wanting to scrub a hand over his face but not having the hands free to do so. “Sorry, Mycroft, I just…thought you were someone else.”
What struck him as more peculiar – interesting wasn’t the right word, as that would imply it was something positive – was the fact that John refused to as much as mention his own family. Almost demonstratively so, he’d say.
“One would’ve thought Sherlock had put more effort into the training of his little pet but then again,” he continued, then his voice suddenly dropped to a hissing growl, “he never did take very good care of his possessions, did he?”
Sherlock wouldn’t leave him out of this if he found out John was actually burdened by his cargo, rather than just moaning about it because everyone does that. The doctor knew that he wouldn’t. But at the same time, there was no need to worry the consulting detective unduly, not on top of everything else.
I am trying, that's all I can defend myself with...
Which put John in even more of a conundrum over what he ought to believe. Was Sherlock really that tired or was there something else at play?
Sherlock’s head shot up and whipped around at that. Not that he hadn’t thought of that, too, of course he had. He always took such things into account but to hear it out of John’s mouth like that, almost…not quite nonchalant but detached in a way he wouldn’t have expected, at all…
For now, things were…just as he’d hoped for.
“Oh, yeah? You could’ve fooled me.” Despite his words, his felt the anger drain and become a bone-deep weariness with just a smidgeon of loathing, though that wasn’t directed entirely at his flatmate. “Just…go away. Please? You’ve done enough today, and if you say you don’t know what or even anything at all, possibly, I’m not sure what my reaction’s going to be, but it won’t be pleasant. So…just go away.”
“You cannot possibly know that.”
Something seemed to click for him at that because his head whipped back around. “That’s what you collect, too, though, isn’t it?”
He almost wished they’d had.
“John?”
It certainly did hurt that John would have even thought that he would do something like that. But then when he thought about it, he had to admit he also knew that John hadn’t thought that far.
“Suppose physical backstabbing went out of fashion in the House of Lords.”
The glimpse might even be entirely on purpose, to lure John in and make him do something stupid, one way or the other. It wasn’t unreasonable to assume that John would, after all, much as he didn’t like to admit it.
“But you don’t necessarily – one might even say automatically – ascribe the elephant motives without much proof purely because it’s entered your mind or, indeed, your living room.”
If John wasn’t tense before, he certainly was now. “Who? The Alpha from before? He must’ve moved fast, then – “
(See the end of the chapter for
They watched the dragon stare at the rope that didn’t snap and the foot which didn’t budge. It tried to pull again, much harder this time – Sherlock could feel it jerk and strain the rope and not just through his hand – to no avail. In fact, despite its best efforts, the gossamer strands spread and thickened across what passed for the ankle. Despite its apparent lightness, the ankle and forelimb sagged, as though weight was being applied to it.
If he could show John some more joyous things such as this, it might also help.
“Thank you,” he said, quietly but without the slightest hint of vibrato.
John pulled back so he could look the other in the eye, his face fighting a battle between caring incredulity and utter joy.
He looked up from staring, eyes narrowed, at the curve of his belly to his love’s face, which was not only right next to him, but he was evidently concerned though he didn’t want to worry his mate. Didn’t want to crowd him but didn’t want to seem uncaring, either.
The Alpha’s expression went from indignant to a dawning horror. “I wouldn’t do that to something you would use!”
At the same time, it didn’t feel quite as wrong as it ought to. It ought to feel violating. But it didn’t. Wrong, yes, but not that strongly so, which probably ought to be worrying in itself.
That thought stopped him cold for a moment.
So many people were worried about whether being in a relationship or, more usually, being bonded would change them, and he could only be grateful that his change had been for the better.
Then it slid further back still and two fingers glided gently over the furled tightness that was his hole. Not pushing inside, just applying the softest of pressures to the nerves there.
Whatever it was, if it helped, that was all that mattered.
the Omega thought, his teeth having pulled back a little in the semblance of a challenging snarl as he scanned the street, looking for the spot and time where the other was bound to emerge.
“Later,” Sherlock said softly. “I promise.”
Once he was upright, violin somehow still in hand, John let go of his hand. But before he could feel bereaved, he felt the hand on his hip as the other teen wrapped his arm around his waist, pulling him slightly to him.
“Of course. I wouldn’t expect otherwise.” The frown deepened.
At least, not before he’d gotten hold of John and the dragon sought to keep others away from its treasure. He’d seen how the bric-a-brac that’d been brought home had been handled, after all, and he guessed it would be the same fate for him. Even Billy wasn’t ever manhandled.
The man’s wife stayed home to look after her while he got some work done from home. Why he couldn’t have been the one to take a day off, then, wasn’t elaborated on, either, and though it wasn’t important – Sherlock knew as it wasn’t difficult to know why – there was something about the slipping and sliding to avoid it that didn’t just grate but sent alarm bells ringing.
Tessa, for her part, curtsied. At least, she tried to curtsy. She was just four, though, and had probably only seen it done by her mum or in movies without fully understanding, which meant that it was more of a jump where her feet didn’t leave the ground than anything and she lifted the dress more up than out.
That thought came unbidden, surprising him, and not in a pleasant way.
By now, he was getting to a point where the feel of Sherlock’s lips had some familiarity to them. That did in no way mean that he wasn’t enjoying this as much the first…well, first proper one. The devouring of their technically first kiss he didn’t count.
What he was doing was playing a board game of some sort with a little girl, for all the world looking like a patient father or uncle who was evidently doing this for the sake of the child but was engrossed in it as well, in order to spend some time with her and make her happy.
Sherlock wasn’t perturbed by the snappish accusation in his partner’s voice. Not when he knew where it came from. “You very obviously needed it, which you know as well as I do, if you stop to think about it without stubbornness and contrariness blocking your path.”
That was probably assigning too much consideration to the thug.
That realisation brought others along with it; right behind it came the thought that if everything was him, then it was easy.
“Something like that, yeah.” Turning a little, ostensibly to change the grip on his bag and tug his jacket down, he looked up and down the street, of course not seeing anyone. “Look, if we’re not going to do anything about him, can we go in?”
It was getting to be late, as in past midnight late, and it was only Thursday, which meant that someone as dutiful as John wouldn’t stay up long past what was deemed acceptable by parents and other grown-ups to still be capable of getting up and going to school the next day.
What he was struggling with was something else, though; the thought that though he hadn’t had any intentions of taking a potential gun, either to use or to experiment on, he’d had a hunting knife in the miscellaneous drawer of the kitchen, one of them, which he hadn’t even thought about until now. Not even for a moment.
Granted, he was probably more prepared than John ever would’ve been, but even so, this wasn’t within anyone’s frame of reference. Or maybe it was, and it was just John who wasn’t used to dealing with a kidnap situation that involved an actual sodding dragon. Maybe that was what they got up to every other Wednesday in Whitehall.
John didn’t need to be told twice. To be honest, he didn’t even need to be told the once; he’d seen his opportunity the moment Mycroft had, and he took it, drawing his legs up to get them free as he rolled to the side and off the bed, the glass box somehow still clasped tight in his hand, unheeded but still clung onto.
John got the point. “Ah. Right. Should’ve figured.” He took a deep breath, possibly in deliberation.
“Mycroft and I,” John said, confirming the other’s assumption. “I…well, maybe you heard and maybe you didn’t, couldn’t actually tell whether you were only pretending to sleep then or not, but I called your brother for advice on how to get on with this.”
With that, he walked out, the tap of the umbrella against the floorboards making an almost pointed audial reassurance that he was leaving.
However, he was, possibly stupidly belatedly, realising that it was only if he were to continue to ignore them or incubate them on his own rather than talk about them with John that it became a problem. A problem which could then still be solved with some proper communication.
“At some point while you were dozing – you snored slightly in case you were wondering how I knew.”
“You never need to ask,” Sherlock interrupted. “If you need something, just take it. This is your home as much as mine, now.”
Once again, Sherlock ruthlessly pushed the instincts down. This time, however, they fought back, arguing, if such it could be called, that he needed them. If he was going up against another Alpha in defence of his Omega, then he –
believe that.
The dragon’s eyes had widened, insofar as that was possible for a reptilian creature, even as the pupils had retracted to the merest line. Sherlock could feel the energy pouring off it as it slowly shifted its head further and shifted its body a little, too.
He didn’t get a verbal response. That didn’t matter so much this time, however, as he did get a physical one; the wing wrapped as much around his body as it could and the tail stirred, too. Not a lot but still some, which was far more than he would’ve expected, even if honestly, he had expected nothing or next to nothing.
As the appendage disappeared behind the sharp teeth again, the expression in the dragon’s eyes turned a little thoughtful, if not outright puzzled, which was odd.
Nor could Sherlock, Alpha or not, nor could anyone else. The best they could do was try not to be in the path of the bullet.
Nevertheless, the Alpha made a conscious effort to gentle his tone on the next sentence. He wasn’t going to get his point across any better by getting angry, however justified he might feel in that anger.
The only point that could really be made was that when the wolf got out of hand, it had to go one by one while a dragon could be expedient in its destruction, as it were.
Sherlock’s own eyes flashed at that, not amber but an equally disconcerting yet fascinating green-tinted white, like that of an iceberg. More immediately important, however, was the rumbling snarl that issued from his lips and the way that the grip on the other’s hand tightened until John would estimate there ought to be bones audibly crushing.
I'm sorry. I know I've left it two months, to the day, and that wasn't intentional. I hope I can be forgiven by you kind, lovely people still reading. At least it's a long chapter...or possibly unfortunately.
That particular scent rang out its notes sweetly, too, and those notes, at least a good portion of them, he would recognise anywhere.
And it wasn’t as though he didn’t have reason to be so, was it? No matter what Mycroft said, the fact of the matter was that Sherlock had hurt John, both physically and mentally, despite all of his attempts to protect him. He’d hurt his brother, too, but that was a different issue, both of them being dragons.
He scoffed and made a show of rolling his eyes but then went on before the dragon could get a word in edgeways. Not right now. Not only had he still a point to make, but he wanted the dragon to drive itself further into the corner of pride and fear if he possibly could.
Hours.
So, for now, he would be there, silently, offering the support, the rock that John had need of to lean against in that moment. The rest would wait.
There was not even a cry of ‘brilliant’, which seemed most unfair, since if anything was brilliant, then surely, this more than qualified?
“You did just then, didn’t you?”
He would not bow to it. It would bow to him.
This time, he felt properly rested, as well, rather than just barely over the threshold of functioning while awake. Not that he was wide awake or instantly on guard or anything like that. Just thoroughly rested and actually capable of comprehending what was around him.
His mind failed him, so he instead tried to smile back. It came easier than he would’ve thought and turned into a toothy one without his say so. But since that made John’s smile widen in turn, he wasn’t about to complain.
Sherlock blinked again, then closed his eyes tight. That was only for a moment, though, thankfully, and he then opened them wide. The doctor was also incredibly relieved to no longer hear even a trace of a keen.
In his mental absence – however quick his mind was capable of working, there had been a small one – John had moved them both out into the living room where he was surveying what had been laid out that they were going to need.
I am so sorry that it's taken this long, and that it's not a longer chapter. Apologies, too, if you can tell I've had troubles, things have been...well, it's here, and that's something. So's the fact that we've finally arrived somewhere, story-wise. Bring out the bubblies. Or not.
with him? This was all speculation. Mainly speculation, anyway. He had no concrete, definite clues or deductions. Yes, there were the things he’d thought about previous but that was it. The rest of it was up in the air, and –
“John…” he whispered, staring at the doctor, at a loss as to what to say and even whether he could say anything to that.
Not as well, he came to realise almost the moment he thought it. They would be expecting it, after all.
“Bugger off, I have eyes.”
“John, what do I…I don’t think I understand why you are holding your own watch out instead of just wearing it now that you’ve found it,” he said, although with a few pauses and with a slightly confused tone to it. More than that, though, there was frustration with himself over not understanding. Of needing to ask like this.
All through it, neither Moriarty nor Moran said anything or moved, apart from the latter’s physical warning to the woman.
John didn’t have the kind of money for that. Hell, he’d be lucky if he still had access to what little money he did have.
“Let me finish, would you?” After taking another breath of calming scent, he sat himself up so he could look the other in the eye. “Just because I use endearments to you doesn’t mean you’re obligated to do so, too. You do know that, right?”
But Sherlock shook his head, his whole face tightened into stone. “Not him. Not Moriarty, either, before you think to ask.” He snorted slightly. “Would’ve been easier if it had been Moriarty.”
I know this is a relatively short chapter and you've had to wait for it but firstly, I've tried to juggle quite a few stories at once and getting everything out, and secondly...quite frankly, this bit was a bit full, for me, emotionally. I know that's only going to be me but I needed to break it off here, just to cope. Still, I feel bad.
Furthermore, said ID clearly stated that he was an unbonded Omega and the bond bite was halfway visible, even over the collar of his shirt and jumper, and there was no evidence that John Watson had been bonded.
Not that he believed John needed to be shut away or protected or anything like that. His doctor was strong, physically and mentally. It was just…
Only a month this time, that's something. I think, and a decent length chapter, too. Here's hoping it was worth waiting for...
“He’s not concerned for me, John, don’t make the mistake of entertaining that thought for even a moment. He just can’t bear that there’s something that he doesn’t know or can’t influence, and he most certainly can’t influence this.”
Or it might just be another attempt at calming him down.
The elder Holmes stopped at the doctor’s silent request, hovering just out of range with an indiscernible expression that John was still willing to bet meant concern for his brother.
, how could he refuse? More than that, how could he but feel like a complete idiot for not taking Sherlock’s own instincts, not to mention his wishes, into consideration, and an utter cock-waffle to boot? Of course, he’d want to provide as far as he was able to, regardless of John’s financial situation.
Then he could make him the political intrigue as a sort of…Christmas present.
A potentially more volatile reaction, too, if he weren’t careful.
Eventually, they pulled away. John was the first to do so but Sherlock followed his lead, looking at the other. The expression on his face from before hadn’t entirely dissipated but it had certainly become a backseat one. In front was a worried but patient expression, together with the earlier caring.
So he was planning to…propose to me before I was kidnapped by Moriarty?”
Perhaps he hadn’t succeeded after all.
How could something so gentle, so lovingly said and so very earnest punch John in the gut more effectively than almost any physical injury he’d ever sustained?
‘Thank you’ wasn’t really an expression that passed with any sort of frequency between the two brothers, if at all, and Sherlock wasn’t about to change that.
Again, the vehemence was surprising as was the sincerity. Why did it matter whether Sherlock was ever touched? Whether he wanted it or not, it was never offered, not outside common courtesy occurrences, and that had been the case for so many years that it didn’t even bother him anymore. It was just how it was, end of discussion, at least for him, which probably just made it seem more pathetic to others.
“No, it wasn’t. You can’t deduce what kind of frown I’m wearing or what that entails.”
“So why is it that you’ve never done or attempted to do any of this before?” Sherlock asked. He held the hand that had held the egg, which he’d deliberately tried to keep out of the dragon’s focus, up for the other to see.
Whatever Sherlock’s reaction was, John was going to see it and deal with it.
Only a month this time, which is back to normal upload pace for this monster. Yay? But it's here and we're progressing, so...
John felt a strange pang of…not exactly pity – the day he pitied one of the most dangerous and influential men in Britain if not the entire world, never mind his draconian attributes, was the day he signed his own death warrant, he was sure, and even he wasn’t quite
So, like it or not, he was stuck with this.
“You could just not have sold me any,” Sherlock pointed out. “I’m not old enough.”
Sherlock complied without a further word, though a bit of tension left him a moment after the arm went around his waist. They watched in unison as the claw turned back into a normal human finger, albeit a rather long one, just as slowly as it had become a claw.
So long as he could somehow wiggle out of Mycroft being best man, or worse, at the event. But that was a concern for later.
Shifting himself into a better position, he took the hand he was still holding and brought it up between them, in full view of them both.
She had known where to aim, then, and with precision, too.
“Obviously, you aren’t, or you wouldn’t have – “
“Okay, fair enough. If it’s a back-and-forth, though, doesn’t that make us more susceptible to mood swings and…other such instances?” Sherlock didn’t need to hear it to know what was being alluded to. “Especially with the pregnancy, it’s almost inevitable that there’ll be some. That’s not saying that I don’t think you can control yourself or your instincts will rule you, or me. Not at all, because I fully believe you can, and they won’t. But – “
I had no idea how to title this chapter.
There was no real arguing with that but even so, John would, because there were modifiers. “Not deliberately.”
“You’ll do no such thing.”
He wasn’t going to add ‘please’. It went without saying.
He stared for a split-second, unable to believe that what he saw was in fact real and relevant to their lives. Anger? When had he been angry with John? If it was anyone who was angry with the other, it was John who –
He’d divested himself of shirt and trousers and climbed into bed where he’d folded himself around the stockier body, enjoying the feel of it against him and the knowledge that he was there. Of course, the familiar residual scent of himself embedded in the linen starting slowly to combine with John’s hadn’t detracted, either.
Of course.
In the end, they brought a few sets of clothes home with them immediately, just so that John would have something to wear, and asked for the rest to be sent.
So, what he’d done instead was try and show his bond mate, through actions rather than words to not put anybody’s hackles up, that he was happy with how things were, and being equal didn’t mean John was going to find out he’d made a mistake.
Its spread wings mirrored the spread arms of the human, the membranes a milky colour.
Looking out, he saw that he’d have to squeeze out between the window and the ornate railings more than he thought he would have but on the other hand, he could use the railing to pull himself out instead and swing other onto the other side, climbing down it enough that he’d be able to touch the canopied awning on Speedy’s with his feet. It wouldn’t break his fall, of course, but it’d help him make sure he didn’t land on the spiked railings at the front door of 223. Small mercies and all.
He looked at Mycroft, who nodded in acknowledgement. So, he’d seen it, too. An unexpected small surge of relief shot through John at that, to know that even if it was a trick, it was convincing them both.
That it was a fluke hurt to think of, for some reason. Part of him, a logical part and admittedly quite a large part, knew it for the reality that it was. That sometimes the concatenation of events did fall out strangely enough that to look at it afterwards, you struggled to believe that it wasn’t designed that way, and that even the most important events in your life could be down to such a concatenation.
“It’d be tempting, I’m not going to deny that, but no. More trying to get my head around it as I formulate it, I suppose. Which is stupid, it’s not like I haven’t had time to think about it before you woke up. Had a whole plan of how I was going to tackle it and everything and…”
Given that, it was no real wonder that his control was slipping, even at such a thing as this, and the shape of his dragon form was visible, even if John still had bugger all idea of how it actually happened. Magic, obviously, but
Well, it was hardly shiny, was it?
Not so much because he’d expected to be saddened by the state of his rooms – nothing in there wasn’t repairable after all – but because he could still smell Mycroft and had an idea of what had gone on here from deductions, even if he had no actual recollection of what had occurred.
Was it an odd sort of relief that his eloquence and not just the ability to string sentences together had at least returned to him? Possibly but not that much, all things considered, nor was the fact that he pulled out truthful deductions.
“Yes, they would,” he snapped again, “and I don’t see why I shouldn’t employ whatever means I have at my disposal, regardless of your disdain for them, if it means keeping something treasured safe.”
It was frustrating, it was worrying, and, honestly, it was more than a little bit fascinating.
Then again, given what the argument had been about when Sherlock had fallen unconscious or comatose or whatever, it was not an unreasonable question to ask nor was it odd that he was that insistent. To be honest, Sherlock was just pleased that he wasn’t angry about it anymore. Or at least, he didn’t seem to be.
But Sherlock had gotten stuck at another point of what he’d said.
“I know I’m not exactly impartial and that that colours what I see, but…” He trailed off, looking out over the clutter one more time, something wistful and complicated on his face.
He wished he could’ve gone to physically see her before they’d left rather than having to do so through a video call and was only comforted a little by the fact that she looked a bit better than the last time he’d seen her.
(See the end of the chapter for
John caught on immediately. “At least the entire way home, probably longer. Should I – “
Telling himself he’d deal with it when, and if, it ever occurred, only helped somewhat. It certainly didn’t entirely dispel the lump in the pit of his stomach nor shut up the worries.
Neither of them spoke, even though they’d be able to.
As the first one, he chose a wound that was close to the shoulder, one of the deeper ones which was relatively easy to get to and get a fair assessment on. Taking a deep breath, he tapped on the box carefully with a finger until one lump was at the edge of the box, close to tipping over. Quickly, he brought it as close to the skin as he reasonably could without touching it and tapped again, very carefully.
“Slip of the tongue.”
For whatever reason, it was still expected of teachers and students alike to address each other by their last name at the public school, but Mr. Duffy had never really gotten the hang of that, his previous two engagements having been comprehensives.
This wasn’t like with the clothes; this would be for the benefit of them both, for their children. Therefore, it wasn’t unreasonable to expect Sherlock to provide.
Mycroft ignored the comment. He stood up, the same frown he’d worn throughout creasing his forehead.
Right now wasn’t the time to bristle over the total disregard of normal rules. That didn’t mean he wasn’t aware he was taking advantage of something that he would’ve bristled at like a veritable hedgehog at any other time.
Sherlock heart gave an almighty thud at that, and he vowed to himself that whatever it would take to achieve, John was going with him on cases. Not that he hadn’t wanted that before, mind, but…this rather cemented it, not as a possibility or a wish but as a definite certainty.
They were given a general introduction by the heads of both the public and state school, who’d seized upon this as an opportunity to promote the idea that the only difference between the two schools was school colours, dontchaknow.
And yet…that stand became a great deal harder to take, never mind maintain, when amber-coloured reptilian eyes stared
More time passed. He didn’t speak as he sat there, just waited. Once or twice he thought he saw a quivering of a wing or felt the twitch of the tail, which hadn’t otherwise moved since it had first draped itself across his lower leg, lending credence to the thought that it had been mere accident. When that happened, he leaned closer for a better examination but each time, nothing came of it.
“But I guess that’s the right of the bright young things, isn’t it? Bye now. Take care. Enjoy the coffee or whatever it’s supposed to be.” The smile he flashed was warm, slightly insincere and more dangerous than he would’ve ever guessed it to be if he was asked about it.
It probably would’ve been easier for him to just move around to the other side of the bed, but he didn’t, and John found himself grateful for that, as the lithe body behind him was a significant calming factor.
For now, though, he had more immediately pressing things. Well, how she was going to react based on those potential memories were of course important but a factor that was too variable for him to calculate.
Before he could get more than a step or two, though, he was stopped. Not by a hand on his shoulder or his arm, as he might have expected. Instead, it was a hand on his hip, with enough grip and strength behind it to stop him, despite it being only the one hand.
Precisely
Not even that, honestly. Alone could prove dangerous on its own, too, couldn’t it? More than dangerous, honestly. Merely because he hadn’t been keen on acknowledging it, to others or to himself, did not make it any less true. Only less palatable and therefore less inclined to be believed.
Though the man didn’t seem to outright relax, which really was fair enough given the circumstances, the tension did leave him a little bit at that. Enough so, at least, that he was willing to explain what had occurred.
He wished he could wholeheartedly and immediately dismiss that thought as untrue. As he couldn’t entirely manage that, he settled for telling his mind to shut up, again, hoping that it would.
It didn’t even matter that Tessa might have a biological connection to Moriarty. In a legal sense, it might, although that was possibly up for debate as well.
John glared at him but nevertheless took a look at what had landed in his lap. No, it wasn’t dangerous, that was true. But that wasn’t to say it was comforting in the slightest, either
If only there hadn’t been this many who’d decided to sign up and be part of it, then it would’ve been over a whole lot faster, and he could get out of there.
There was some, admittedly small, part of him that listened for someone to make a comment along the lines of ‘you ought to have thought of that before all of this was set in motion’. It didn’t have to be Mycroft, but it’d probably be more likely to be.
“Something? You mean you don’t know?”
With his free hand, John grabbed hold of one of Sherlock’s bonier, broader ones and brought it up between them.
his brain piped up.
They might have a literal deadline hanging over their heads in Moriarty’s desire for another plaything but that didn’t excuse much, if anything.
It was a vote of confidence, but it was also an assurance. That even if this particular operation didn’t pan out the way they hoped, the way they wanted, then there were other avenues to explore. Other ways to make this happen.
Of course, he had worth in himself, not just in what he was to John, but it said such a lot about him, didn’t it? It spoke of a good reason to love him if you needed one.
“Jim Moriarty. Hiii!”
“We’d better be quiet,” John said, the words coming out as puffs of restrained laughter. “He’s not that far away and…well, he probably knows I’m not French, at least. But laughter is hardly, hardly appropriate.”
He was no longer a soldier. The bullet wound had seen to that, in conjunction with the Heat that had been triggered as a self-dense mechanism when he’d been spotted by an Alpha while wounded. Technically, he was still a doctor, but he could no longer be a surgeon. Not just because of the tremor or the limp at the time but because he was seen as a liability for hospitals; who know what they really had on their hands when he didn’t have any scent? It was unnatural, was the general consensus.
I - I would say I don't know what happened but I think I do. I probably shouldn't have written this at this time when I haven't been in the but I didn't want to make you all wait longer than you had already. So I'm sorry for this rollercoaster and mess of a chapter. I probably should've waited.
After putting the bag on and taking a relatively heavy backpack as well as a small handheld bag, John found his free hand automatically went to the top of the furry head, stroking it gently. He really shouldn’t be doing that, though, should he? Not because his hands were dirty or anything but it still…he didn’t want the bear to be in a worse condition by the time they finally got there.
or perhaps even something that went beyond hunger. Far beyond, the almost black of the eyes reflecting that as they reflected almost nothing else.
“Right. Well, let’s see about that, shall we?”
Concentrating and pushing aside all the other things for just a moment, he focused on the dragon’s eye and the rest of what he could feel emanating from it, both –
‘What, can’t you work that out from a look on my left thumb or whatever?’ came the answer.
Even so, he felt certain that if the unthinkable should happen, Sherlock would dive after him and would pick him up before he came near the ground.
Well, carnage was probably too dramatic a word for it, as was destruction. Mess didn’t convey the severity. Possibly wreckage was the appropriate term for what his bedroom had become.
Then the gaze slipped sideways, and the moment it alighted on John, Sherlock felt his hackles rise back up with a force that nearly propelled him forward. Right into the other’s throat.
He was not an object, he wasn’t an also-ran, he wasn’t a lamp ray clinging onto someone else for validation or sense of identity…well, mostly not the last one, and he hadn’t kept doing it. He was aware of it and so he could work on fixing it…
It really was an important distinction, not least for his own headspace. If he were going to make headway with forming a new identity, he needed a much clearer idea of what was in the past and would stay there and what might be brought with him going forward.
Something relaxed inside of him.
Which hadn’t made the discharge from the army easier, of course, with no family to turn to and no friends who were close enough.
It wasn’t that the bed was carefully and properly made, even though that was a bit of a surprise on its own, but that on top of the covers and the bedspread, there was…
“I can hold onto you if you’re here, protect you with my body.”
‘No, of course not. Nor do they expect me to pick it as a career. – SH’
Because John didn’t just smile at him, he let him buy the cigarettes that he wasn’t supposed to get. More than that, he made sure that there was always at least one packet of Sherlock’s brand available for him to buy. And if he knew his name, he must’ve heard more about Sherlock, too, positive and negative, and yet he hadn’t backed away. He’d been the one who’d sought the younger Holmes out for this assignment.
“Right.”
In short, it was a moronic attempt at dominance, one he would’ve thought Mycroft above employing.
By the time they landed, John had that feeling you get when you’ve taken a nap you really shouldn’t have taken; he was warm, his head felt heavy and achy, his eyes itched, and his limbs felt leaden.
Well, he wasn’t about to let the other have all the other upper hand. If he did without any kind of contest, Moriarty would smell a rat.
It was a realisation he’d come to a few days after he’d thought he’d made the final, conclusive decision to abandon it all. He’d resolutely been abstaining from fiddling with the ring in his pocket up until that point – for fear of John discovering it, he’d kept it on him at all times, even after he’d come to the decision not to – but had given in while sitting up at night, unable to sleep.
John did not look worried, so he had to have been told or had worked it out himself. So, Sherlock decided to press on.
As the search for Moriarty and Tessa begins, John gets to...think about Moriarty. And Tessa.
It ought to have sounded boring, with its relatively simple melody. Yet there was something interesting, almost compelling about it, possibly aided by that very simplicity.
“Are they…?” Sherlock seemed somewhat hesitant, but he managed to press on. “Are they…on schedule?”
His feelings must’ve showed on his face despite his efforts because John’s own face fell a little and he walked quickly over to him, wrapping his arms around him, despite the fact that there were bags in the way, and holding on tight.
There was no response. No twitch of muscle, no sound – the keening was gone but had left an odd sort of vacuum in its wake, as a persistent and invasive noise can when it’s killed suddenly. No flutter of eyelids. Even the breathing was soft enough that he could only just about feel the warmth of it on his hand. He erroneously wondered if the unexpected heat of it would be in any way related to his dragon heritage.
John shot him a glance. Well, more of a Look, really. “I think I’ve about earned the right to call him whatever the fuck I want, eloquent or not.”
“Does it really matter, when the bullet hits, why the gunman fired?”
“No.” They hadn’t.
Still, she did try, her head bent and the tip of her tongue sticking out again as she concentrated.
“Of course.”
“Well, if that’s what you’d prefer,” he said, keeping his voice calm somehow, almost to the point of detachment. Pointedly so, in fact. He also shifted a bit, so that he was no longer exactly sitting in the other’s lap.
If nothing else, this was a long chapter and I think, think, they are getting better at all this. I hope so - and it wasn't to be a 'ooh, mystery' sod that we didn't see Sherlock's visitor, btw. Or, let me put it another way, it wasn't intentional.
There were quite a few other things that needed asking around about and sorting first.
It was utterly asinine, not to mention degrading to both Alpha and Omega, but it seemed to appeal to the masses or at least, that was what the people making it continued to believe.
“From you, you mean? But I am distant from you. More than you. Much more.”
It wouldn’t even have been with a thought to, if the person in question was the victim, how it would help them as well. Justifying it that way, even though it couldn’t really do that, in any case, not if you put any kind of proper thought into it.
Yes. He did. Completely, once he pushed past the Alpha thoughts clogging his mind.
“Shouldn’t we start as we mean to go on?” he countered.
Then his lips pursed for a moment before they spread in a smile that was both as sweet and as fabricated as a stick of rock.
Lestrade because he couldn’t get hold of Sherlock? No, he’d go back to trying Sherlock’s phone, which was…somewhere. Who else?
It was a performance, of course it was, that was the point. But it was a performance to show Sherlock what he could do, that he could hold up his end of the assignment, as it were, not because he wanted to score cheap points.
He almost slowed down, uncertain of what would await him when he actually made it back.
The fact that he’d been exposed as a dragon, that he’d hurt John and attempted to make him into another object, that played a part, too. Of course, it did. It would be worrying if it didn’t, quite frankly.
Sherlock undressing, with what was meant to follow after that, might bring that into sharper contrast and in turn, might make him question whether it was really a good decision to become the partner of a dragon.
“Had he talked to you before that?”
Come to think of it, he had been extraordinarily patient with John throughout this, even though it had been his brother in the balance. The blond, too, of course, but mostly his brother.
“Please don’t ever feel you need to say thank you for me returning, love. It isn’t something that’s going to be an issue, I promise you, and I’m sorry that you feel that way. That’s not to say I blame you,” he hastened to add, needing to make sure that got through, “but I…fuck it, you shouldn’t even have had the thought. I’m sorry, Sherlock.”
It was only when they were well outside the house, down the street and away from prying eyes that might actually care about what they did, if only because it would make for something to tell, that John halted, disentangling their hands.
“Thank you,” he said, quietly, pressing their forehead further together. Not for anchoring, though, but purely for the lovely gesture. Well, that, and reinforcing the thank you, too, of course.
Things have happened and, more importantly, progressed. Feels like finally, I know. I hope I've delivered somewhat, though. I liked writing them all in this but I hope John doesn't come across as weak or anything like that. Sigh...me and my worries.
But though there were many things he still didn’t know about his scent-bonded, he knew, and though there were pockets and seams of uncertainty, self-doubt and the rest lurking about in his mind, John also knew that that wasn’t the case at all. That it was quite the opposite.
One reassuring part, if you could call it that, was that he could recognise, just about, the general emotions at a glance and therefore could go through them relatively quickly, which’d only further help the situation.
John sighed. “No, and I’m not saying I condone it. But you did stop, you have seemed to realise that it’s wrong,” he got an emphatic nod, “and like I said, if you ever try to continue after I’ve said stop or otherwise haven’t expressed consent, then I am not afraid to punch you.”
“I’m not even going to dignify that with an answer. You’re getting something to eat, no arguments and you’ll clean the plate. Then you’re going straight back to bed and then you’ll get some sleep. Proper sleep, even if it takes twice as long as it ought to, and I’ll come in on the regular to check.”
Of course, he’d seen it before. They lived together and with his lack of boundaries, Sherlock had more than once walked in on his flatmate while he was showering or soaking in the tub. But apart from that, John wasn’t exactly an exhibitionist and what was exposed, when it happened, tended to be the upper half, at most. On top of that, there was quite the difference between that situation and this.
“No,” he said, and it came out quiet and earnest, surprising him further. “I’m not.”
There didn’t even need to be any ulterior motive to it or any need for it to move beyond that, as the case may be. Just the cuddling was more than enough to have Sherlock content for a surprisingly long time.
That he knew where they were also meant that he knew how safe he was or wasn’t, in relation to where the dragon’s abode were.
He watched as John tensed at that and hurried on, “Its own partner, that is, not its possession. Irreversibly, too, which I know is something you don’t want to hear, either, but – “
So an early night, but that was alright.
Sherlock’s grip on him was firm and immovable, which was just as well. What had on the ground felt secure but slightly suffocating in its all-encompassing grip now felt reassuring and comforting, even with the claws still present, the certainty of the knowledge that he wasn’t going to slip out of the grasp and plummet to his death.
“That is not true.” He dared to pull at the hand he still held in his up, so its knuckles pressed against his chest. The left side of his chest, where his heart, large even in human body, resided and could easily be felt.
He tried to pitch it in a tone of voice that was imploring without being secretly demanding, hoping to show the other that he was genuinely interested but that he shouldn’t feel under any pressure to divulge if he didn’t want to.
Only for you, John.” There went the first tear trickling down his cheek like someone making a run for it. He didn’t chase it. “Only ever for you.”
What they were not were brown, and while that was hardly incontestable proof – after all, the recessive blue might still be present in a parent with brown eyes – it did still assuage his worries a tiny bit.
“Thinking, hold on.” Well, at least he got an answer, eh?
That particular barb, unintended though it just possibly was, plunged deeper than Sherlock expected it to and hurt more as a result, too. Though it also hurt because it managed to hit a bit of a raw nerve. More than a bit, really.
They had had all the opportunity in the world, it seemed, and yet they had managed to squander it.
Yeah, alright, I get it. More to this than that, though. Don’t need anyone making coos or sniggers or dumb remarks.” He leaned close again. “Just need you here and the knowledge that you did all this for me.”
“Is what you’ve fought for no longer worth fighting for?” He didn’t believe that, wasn’t affected by the comment, but he hoped that it might provoke something in Sherlock.
“I don’t mangle the furniture.”
The doctor gave him a sidelong look as he kept up. “You know, I think you actually managed to state something obvious for once. You sure you’re feeling okay?”
Someone who seemingly took no notice of her apparently unconscious form but was instead entirely focused on the other Alpha and, somewhat, on the Beta, too.
This is a day late compared to my normal upload date, I know. I was out celebrating that night, though, so...at least you don't have to wait another week. :)
“Come to make one last comment about not screwing things up, more like,” Sherlock corrected as he popped open the boot and hauled out the bags.
To want something badly does not mean that you are any good at what you want, after all. Enthusiasm or wishes cannot grant you any skill or affinity for the thing that you do not already possess, not on their own – and that wasn’t even mentioning the fact that the reality might be something entirely different than the wish. The dream.
“Go away, Sherlock!” he shouted. The footsteps paused but only for a moment. They didn’t get fainter when they resumed, either, so he wasn’t moving away.
Though the words weren’t said they hung in the air between them, nevertheless. Astonishingly, they didn’t sour the mood or otherwise change it even the slightest.
If Sarah rang to scream at him for not coming into work, if Lestrade and his team burst into the flat for another drugs bust, staged or not, he wouldn’t have noticed. Even if Moriarty had come to kidnap him from under Sherlock’s nose and the younger Holmes had made an uproar that made his clash with Mycroft look like a toddler flapping its hands, John was afterwards not at all sure he would’ve woken. Perhaps not even if Sherlock had made him into a part of his hoard while he had been asleep or…done other things. It had been that deep a sleep and it had been long overdue.
Regardless, he did need to deal with it.
It was his turn to squeeze the hand in his in a way that told the younger Holmes it was an anchoring effort. Something which he could understand only too well. He squeezed back and got a grateful flash of a smile in return.
His voice wouldn’t work and he didn’t think it a good idea to call out in any case. It would only give away that he was…too many things all mixed together, quite honestly, and none of them good at all.
He then went to grab the bottom edge of the coat, bringing it up into the doctor’s at present limited reach while at the same time stretching it out so that it might be easier to cut.
“I don’t – I won’t do that, John,” was what he ended up saying after all, but it was without dismissal or even bravura. Just quiet earnestness. “I promise you I won’t. I’ll be sensible about it and won’t overdo it in any way. I promise.”
To find out whether the courtship was intentional, he would need to ask at least John.
No, of course not. Not that specific, at least. But something that perhaps, at least, would narrow it down a little more.
John didn’t immediately focus on what had been thrown at him and had landed on the floor, registering only that it was clothing in a bag as he kept his eyes on the door, wanting to make sure that the bastard didn’t think again and return.
“What happened to it?”
He trailed off, his jaw tightening as the realisation slowly dawned on him, though he didn’t stop walking.
That felt more like something out of a novel or a song, to call childless people, alone or as pairs, bonded or not, the ‘lonely’ people. As though you needed children in order not to be lonely or to be happy.
“Then it’ll be the same story whether I’m here or there while you’re fast asleep.”
In an odd sort of way, it made a great deal of sense that it would be that, of all the base desires and vices that had managed to get free and was now coming towards him from all around, that had managed to latch onto him first and done so as effectively as it had.
What he was grateful for was both the concentrated contemplation that she didn’t mar with extra, unnecessary platitudes – showing, to his mind, that she had the right focus – and the fact that she kept her focus on the man beside him.
“Like a fractured mirror?” John asked.
“You took something of mine and I’m retrieving it. End of story. If I never have to see your face again, I’d still feel tainted to the last of my days.”
He didn’t get a response. That was to say, he didn’t get a verbal one.
‘You did that? – SH’
Moriarty merely grinned, like a kid watching a new toy, as he came to a stop a few steps from them.
“No.” Sherlock shook his head, but gently, so as not to dislodge the hand still on his cheek. “It’s you.”
“No. Yes. I don’t – maybe I do. I don’t know. It’s – it’s swinging back and forth in my head. John, why is it…it should be easy, so why isn’t it? The dragon is easy. Too easy, that’s the problem. Not the whole problem, but part of the problem. I don’t – “
But now that he was no longer that, either, what was he? John H. Watson, of course, but who was he? Apart from a mother and a bond mate, who was he? He wasn’t a student, a soldier, a surgeon or a harem keeper anymore. Doctor he still was, yes, but he couldn’t take over a practice or even join a pre-existing one – before he’d ended up in the harem, he’d tried and been told that with no scent, no patients would trust him to be their doctor.
Silence reigned for a moment or two. Three possibly, as John felt himself start to slip off into something approaching sleep, although admittedly, that didn’t have to take long.
What mattered was that he’d be
“And yet you came all this way to see me, breaking in and everything. I’m not sure I believe you, Johnnie. Doesn’t seem very…convincing, gotta say. I think you’re lying, in fact.”
Christmas Day was, after all, the day that marked his and John’s anniversary as a couple.
Whether what he meant was the kiss against the temple, shows of affections in general or the declaration of trust and support, so open and unequivocal, wasn’t clear. It might have been all three, and it would’ve been just as valid whatever constellation it would be.
Sherlock didn’t get back up, just turned his head so that the side of his face was still touching the curve of the stomach while he spoke.
Tessa, though…it wasn’t what he’d have expected, but at the same time, it made sense as the sort of name John would pick. Short, sweet, easy to call, not too singular or posh-sounding, yet not quite run-of-the-mill, either.
Their gate was, quite understandably, not a main one at all. This wasn’t Heathrow, of course, not even close, but even so, they couldn’t be blocking a gate that was normally widely used.
“I can do it, John. I know I haven’t shown that very well up until now, but I can do it, I know I can. I – I didn’t feel any hint of the dragon when I woke up or even when you mentioned…when I got jealous about Mycroft, that was without even a trace of – “He cut himself off at that, sharply, feeling a .
Rather, it was just that there was so much attached to these feelings, to John and by extension Sherlock himself that it could hardly help but be fraught and precarious. Not helped, of course, by what lurked in the depths.
John thought he might be what? Asexual? Not in so many words but in his own clumsy way of describing it, perhaps. Not that Sherlock had read much on the topic, so he wouldn’t know and didn’t want to hypothesise.
That was also why Sherlock getting his wires mixed on what was friendship and what was courtship seemed the only possible explanation if there was more, or something else, to it than pure possessive behaviour.
What you claim. How very…
“– But I’m not sure I was ready to admit it, to myself or to you, not before. I never wanted to lose you.”
“It’s okay either way, John,” he said, earnestly. “It’s your decision, not mine. If I could’ve spared you meeting my brother – “
It didn’t seem to, as Sherlock spoke the moment they made eye contact.
That said, it was also just the tiniest bit kind and perhaps even sweet. There was no way he was going to admit to that and especially not out loud.
Sorting out the terms of a relationship can be interesting enough. Throw a traumatic experience and a dragon heritage into the mix, not to mention needing to factor in a criminal madman...dragon, and there's an awful lot to sort.
He was stubborn like anything and could be just as pig-headed as Sherlock – there, he could admit that he was pig-headed, too – about what he could and couldn’t do when he felt like it. It was just that John tended to express it differently from Sherlock and often for other reasons, as well, even though one was perfectly capable of driving the other to pig-headed stubbornness they hadn’t planned on.
There was no point in dwelling on that now, though. Done was done and he’d have to deal with the outcome.
“He might see it differently.”
That he didn’t have to sacrifice anything, let alone his life or his mind, in order for them to have a life together or John to become a living, breathing doll bereft of mind and soul.
Had someone been and picked it up when – but when should that have been? He had been with Sherlock almost the entire time they’d been back and when he hadn’t, the younger Holmes had been…occupied, to say the least.
Why did this have to become more bleeding complicated while it was being explained? It wasn’t as though he was asking for the entire history and biology of dragons, was it? Just the parts pertaining to what was going on in front of him right then and there.
“By retrieving her?” It was Mycroft asking.
as far as it’s possible to know, that would be a cure, and even then, you went the extra mile to be even more sure. Are you going to let all of that go to waste?”
It didn’t exactly help him that he was an Alpha, either. While the norm was that the Alpha led and was obeyed, that they were in charge and knew best – which, of course, you could scoff at as much as you wanted and try to work against, but that didn’t change how people regarded you – they were not the ones that people were prone to trust in when it came to stressful and otherwise emotional situations.
“John…” Sherlock breathed, incredulity and joy, disbelief and relief, hope and worry all rolled into that one single syllable, somehow.
He’d make a fine doctor one day. His bedside manner was excellent, for one.
“The end result would be the same, however we arrive at it.”
He waved a hand and Mycroft seemed to get the point; he helped to spread one wing enough that John, with some precarious balancing over the prone body, could just about reach and, with more saliva just to be sure when he couldn’t quite see, brushed it out.
“That’s just projection!” John almost shouted.
‘How lovely to hear from you, dear brother. Known what? – MH’
“You’re tense.”
It was more or less just spilling from him at that point, with little control over what came out, thoughts given voice without much filter. It felt cathartic even as it felt string-cutting.
Trying not to close it immediately, to not show that it irked him that much. Or perhaps not irked, as that implied annoyance which wasn’t the case at all. It was more true to say that it worried him, and that mainly because of the current situation.
Even if it meant rushing John to the hospital once again, though he would – even the thought of that last time was enough to send his heart to stopping altogether.
A louder bang than before, which was accompanied by a clearly audible shriek, jolted him out of his thoughts.
He found that his fingers were smoothing over the glass of the dial and the leather of the strap. That was, until he thought of giving it back, by which time they tightened on the accessory, quite instinctively.
For a long while, there was no response, and John thought that he might’ve gotten his hopes up for nothing once again.
“But you won’t, will you?” he continued. “Because that’s not
He walked back up close to John and placed a finger, which still felt tipped with an absurdly sharp claw, gently on the underside of the blond’s chin.
Sherlock tries to find a way to bring an end to the stalemate they find themselves in. One that hopefully won't end with any of them dead.
John would’ve cried out, or at the very least cursed as pain shot through him at that, but he wasn’t allowed much chance before he was grabbed and dragged further underneath the lanky body, which pressed down onto him, pinning him in place. It ought to have been impossible, with John both being heavier and stronger than Sherlock but as he’d experienced earlier, the brunet’s body harboured a strength that belied the skinny appearance, and right now, he was using it to prevent John from moving as he curled further around him.
Sherlock didn’t answer that, just grimaced.
Granted, he hadn’t been flying partially shifted like this for a very long time, as far as he still retained memories thereof, but given his relative inexperience flying in this form, his injuries and the added aspect of his passenger, he had, if he’d thought about it, expected something a little more erratic and certainly more cumbersome.
The eyes flashed again at that, stronger and clearer than before.
“I could’ve just needed to wait until you were inside my territory.”
“No, you’re not making me question you. Not over that, anyway. You’re not off the hook for some chewing out on a few things but that can wait. Now come on, get down on that bed…and that sounded far more suggestive than I meant it to. Not because –”
John snorted. “Other than that, yes. You two plotting something?”
Sherlock almost spun towards him, though it seemed more out of surprise that he was there than any outburst of hostility or territoriality.
That wasn’t an end of it, of course. Mycroft so loved to poke his nose in and now that he thought he was genuinely helping he would only get worse.
An odd image surged up in his mind of minds at that, of a little boy, or it might have been a tree, who ate and ate and grew and grew, forever wanting more. Pleading its parents for more, even when it had consumed both its parents in its insatiable greed for more.
“I’m sorry I wasted – “
Just as important, that rope had an end. An end which Sherlock held in his hand, wound tight around it. Making sure that it wasn’t escaping his grasp.
He was surprised and delighted to learn that they shared some of the same interests, for example in biology, even though they approached it from two different angles, as it were, one being personal and compassionate and the other purely scientific.
Had he made it too elaborate? Too obscure? Perhaps too simple or too obvious? Was it too early to do it now? It was, after all, just about pushing midnight, so it was barely Christmas Day and therefore their anniversary.
Which for so many Omegas were indeed how they were treated by the Alphas they bonded with, and many people considered that progressive.
“Obviously.”
No, actually, what made it the most egregious one was because, whether deliberate or not, he failed to understand the problem or have the appropriate response, even when called out.
“Why did you bother looking at me in the first place, then?” It wasn’t a good idea to ask such a thing, he knew that, but Moriarty wasn’t the one he was worried about angering right now.
“I am,” he admitted. “Mostly worried but yes, also scared. There are so many things that are up in the air, so many variables and unknowns that is impossible to calculate and counter yet can turn out to have devastating effects on not just me but the people I care about. I know that’s a factor in all life, but regardless, this – “
This was hardly a case of that, though. However long, or short, they’d known each other, there was no real denying that they fitted together as though they’d known each other for years. It wasn’t a case of love at first sight, not really, but neither was it a case of the scent bond choosing for them.
He turned on the spot, slowly, trying to take it all in. Sherlock took his cue.
The trip through the airport was wonderfully uneventful. Well, apart from the bit through security where someone thought it a good idea to try and pull apart the teddy  he’d just got from Mycroft because ‘it could contain drugs or unlicensed Heat-medication’, which, really, the latter part
A squeeze of his hand brought him back to the here and now. He looked up at John and squeezed back.
Perhaps what he needed was something more solid and concrete, something he could latch onto and work from.
Focus. Just a little bit further.
“You won’t, John, I promise.” Still urgent and pleading. “I promise. I’m sorry. Don’t leave. I’m sorry.”
“Some might. Especially,” and Sherlock straightened up so he could give the surrounding area a seemingly innocuous onceover, though John knew it to be anything but, “given that the harem had its of operations in this area for some time.”
That moment proved to be a moment he didn’t have.
Much to his dismay, Sherlock had been somewhat forced to eat more regularly in the last year. Like it or not, to grow and develop, which included his brain, needed fuel and plenty of it. Furthermore, he’d learned to his cost what happened if he ignored it entirely; he collapsed and was out for the count for some considerable time afterwards.
He continued in his mind.
The sheer reality of it didn’t help, either, in terms of keeping a clear head.
The more chance they all stood.
With that knowledge, he couldn’t be angry at his bond mate for wanting to tug at this new piece until it unspooled. It wasn’t purely for the thrill of the chase, as it were, it was to guarantee the safety of his family.
“I’m dead certain that was how I was taught to play it.” It was only the vaguest of memories, but they were genuine memories. At least as far as he could recall he hadn’t altered or fabricated them. He deleted useless stuff if anything.
Out of the corner of his eye – for more than one reason, he hadn’t much wish to turn his head while he was moving to look at it – he saw it and recognised it for what it was; greed.
John frowned. “How the hell…?” He’d never mentioned Harry to Sherlock, not one word, so why would he mention a her, when they’d just been talking about siblings?
Up this close, he could scent her, too. Not quite as strongly as if he’d nosed at where the prepubescent version of her scent gland was, of course, and in general, her scent would be mild compared to what it’d be once she’d hit puberty, but it was still there, clear like a small bell.
Again, there was a lot he needed to learn about Sherlock, still, some it probably rather central and crucial, but as far as he’d been able to work out so far, the brunet wasn’t…no, that wasn’t quite right. But he was quite capable of being contrary and at least appearing unconcerned if the mood struck him, John knew that much.
John didn’t spot Sherlock stiffen where he stood or the flickering of his own dragon shape behind him, pale eyes fixed on where his brother was touching the blond.
for Moriarty to bother with, even as a money maker, then they would only know when and into which account they put the money.
That significantly lowered the likelihood it was a note telling him Sherlock was out on a case. As he said, he preferred to text and it would be so much easier and quicker if he was about to bolt out of the flat after some case or other. To take the time to write something was a grander apology than a text, of course, but still…it seemed unlikely that Sherlock would.
Honestly, that was more than he could’ve hoped for, let alone expected to see.
Apologies if the summary makes little sense, I am very tired.
Was something that he was immensely glad that Tessa was turned away from. Something that he vowed she shouldn’t see for anything in the world.
Sherlock has to navigate them home safely over densely populated London, with a doctor in his arms who is neither content nor quiet. He has questions to answer then and even more when they make it home. That is not all they have to contend with, though...
“Well, then?” he asked.
Sherlock had a brief but clear mental image of John with the guitar under his chin, bowstring at the ready and couldn’t suppress the snicker.
At the same time, he watched Tessa reach out her hand, slowly, uncertainly, still looking between the two men as if she knew this was a much more important decision than just going for ice cream and games or whatever else it was that Moriarty had promised her. Which seemed simultaneously ludicrous and very plausible.
“Love you,” he said when he pulled back.
Guilt over so many things, really, mixed together in a horrible stew, all of them stupid and yet at the same time, entirely valid. One that weighed most heavily, though, was the one that he had failed to give that same support to Sherlock at any point.
The demeanour changed again, as abruptly and completely as the cut of a scene.
He let the tip of his tongue trace the outer rim of the ear, noticing the small intake of breath.
When it came time to concrete deal with an issue, though, he seemed to ‘pull himself together’ just fine, without much, if any problem. Sherlock had seen that happening more than once, after all, no matter what state he was otherwise in, and he considered it one of John’s admirable and defining attributes, the ability to roll with whatever was thrown his way and find himself a way out of it.
The first thing he saw was…
Closing his eyes, he felt his thoughts return to him. Not fast but fast enough that he could string together a sentence in his mind. He didn’t need to think about much, however; his own instincts had been awakened, though why they hadn’t weighed in earlier he couldn’t say, and they quickly assessed the situation.
In other circumstances, John would’ve been ecstatic to be kissed by Sherlock. To be honest, if it had happened during normal circumstances, he probably would’ve been surprised and a little suspicious, first of all, depending on what had gone before. But on the condition that it was consensual and honest on both parts, he would’ve been over the moon.
Getting a hand free, the one hand that he had full movement of, wasn’t easy but he managed it, somehow, and reached out to take the small box, which wasn’t, as he’d thought, made of plastic but glass. Again, something pure.
Mycroft leaned back in his chair. He’d just received a text which said nothing more than ‘I was right’.
It wasn’t easy to say the last part, not easy to admit that he was afraid, but he needed to.
For once, he would like a bit of simple.
‘John’ remained unperturbed. “Well, neither can you,” he pointed out.
His knees were bracketing slim hips and the top of long thighs while his hands were planted on the mattress just above the shoulders, which gave him a relatively good grounding.
Whether it was actually her wasn’t a concern he had or at least, not a major one. It probably would have been, had it been anyone but Mycroft who’d done the research work. Not on his own, of course, but he had been the driving force in relation his employees and the keyholder in relation to John and Sherlock.
care. My heart is fluttering so hard it might actually start to warm up.”
I promise I'll do my best to get to at least some of the answers, the smut and the wrap-up, though.
“I am not risking your life for you to prove a sodding point!”
No, not never mind. Sherlock needed to know. Pressing the issue, though, might not be a good idea, even he sensed that.
I said it would be soon after, didn't I?
It clicked in John’s head and he suddenly felt foolish for it not coming to him immediately.
An awful lot of talking and explaining. Hopefully it's cleared up a few things or at least been an interesting read. It was certainly interesting to write, especially trying to balance exposition with character.
“You are, don’t even try it, and so am I. But the important point right now is that he needs us to be there for him. Call help, if you need it, but as it is, he’s mostly human and he is in no fit state to be moved.”
“Sherlock, stop. Please.”
Even John would be likely to tire of that sooner rather than later and again, there would be more than one way to lose him and they didn’t need to have anything to do with his dragon nature.
By love.
Before he could open his mouth, though, either to spit vitriol or flame, he wasn’t sure, Moriarty spoke again.
The burning steel that was the core of John Watson flared up and pushed the clouds out of his head by sheer force of will. Human he might be, with no mythical powers or inhuman strength to assist him, but on the other hand, he was a human being. The indomitable species.
That wasn’t the reason he’d failed to return it in the time since he’d stolen it over a week earlier, though it was the reason he told himself the times he’d felt a stab of…of something at the thought.
This, however? There was not swaddling them in cotton and wool and then there was pushing them into the horror.
But Sherlock wasn’t listening. “What did he say? John, tell me, what did he say?”
He fervently wished he hadn’t been rooted to the spot when John had kissed him. If he hadn’t, he might’ve had the courage to be more confident, to have kissed back and not let his mind get a word in edgeways. But frozen he had been and now, he was cursed with his mind having been flooded with thoughts and insecurities.
It was an at first glance unseeming metal ring, with a relatively thin band. Not silver, either, but steel, with another band running around it. Look closer, however, and you could see that said band was in fact silver and what was more, it was decorated with Celtic knotwork in relief all the way around that silver, so thoroughly that it went from ostentatious to simple in its complexity.
The pupil widened at that.
When he did, he did something very close to startling but before he could get very far, he was halted again but this time, it wasn’t by any kind of furniture.
The dragon wouldn’t have been pleased at being challenged and restrained, thereby preventing him from getting to John as he wanted. Hell, he’d
The point was that he wasn’t a possession, either in the dragon or the human sense of the term, and Sherlock would make certain that he never treated him as such. Whatever that would take.
"Clever misdirection.”
As though in confirmation, or perhaps just in mockery or even merely desperation, he could feel the leash being tugged and pulled at, again and again. None of the tugs were brutal or even hard but their quiet insistency somehow brought the situation home much clearer.
Strangely, though, he somehow felt a slight bit better about things. He couldn’t say why, as really, there was no reason to, but nevertheless, it was there.
“My number,” he explained as he wrote, as though Sherlock couldn’t recognise that on his own, or at least, that it was a phone number. “I know we should find out when we can practise and so on, but I’m…really pressed for time, so…call or write me on that, yeah?”
In fact, neither mentioned scent bonds at all. Nothing, not even the briefest of comments or links to other studies covering it. It was as though their existence hadn’t even occurred to people who’d published the paper.
“He was clearheaded and sane enough to know exactly how to blow his victims to smithereens. Even if he had someone to actually rig it, he would have to know about it, because they’d be in his thrall or possession or whatever. He’d use what would be harmful to both of us.”
For another, there were impressions on the cheek that faced John which could only come from having slept on that for some considerable time.
Right. Figured, really, didn’t it? “Why not?”
that.
What? Disgust? Why would that disgust him? It was John, John who had actually kissed him – and apparently wanted to, too!
That didn’t tally with Moriarty wanting to claim John for himself, though, did it? Then again, that might’ve been a spur of the moment decision, whatever the underlying reason for it might be, which wouldn’t be hard to believe of the Irishman.
It was the same arguments as had floated around his mind before, with nothing new added, but it didn’t come from him, from the part of him that he thought of as Sherlock. Instead, it came from the dragon, and he suddenly realised that it hadn’t been quite as dormant as he’d thought.
It was evident her new parents had money and could buy her a new plush in mint condition if she wanted it. Had in fact done that, several times of, by the look of the room.
Were they the same places where…where what?
“Sherlock?”
Not because the Omega was a possession, mind, to be fought over and won. The day he thought that about his partner, Sherlock would find a way to break the scent bond himself, to make sure that John wouldn’t ever be treated like a thing. Again.
The thought that his coat, one of his most cherished treasures, had been cut in half like that hurt, even more than he would’ve expected it to with it being part of his hoard. It hurt quite badly, to be honest, but the rage that he might’ve expected to accompany the pain was oddly absent.
It warmed his heart to know that Sherlock was so willing to help, even when it came to something like this, especially when he could be out solving murders and such instead.
And this was different, anyway. This was…well, this wasn’t two flatmates just happening to get an eyeful of whatever bits were exposed at the same time. It was something rather more…intimate, and not because they were getting undressed. Because they’d moved onto something else, something closer, and it would be their first time seeing each other in that context.
“No. You weren’t.”
Through a combination of John carefully explaining that they were going to pick up their daughter – letting the officer draw their own conclusions after carefully framing it – but more importantly, that they might want to run it through the x-ray first, they were able to keep the poor bear from being gutted.
Moving carefully so as not to dislodge the hand, he got to his feet. “I promise I’ll tell you the moment I can feel them, okay? You’re not the only one who’s excited about all of this.”
posed to them through his bond with Sherlock, his role in getting them out and whatever links the owners might make to that, it was hardly the wisest moment to visit.
The thought was filled with pride rather than mockery or condescension.
When the eyes reached their normal placement, they blinked again to bring themselves into a better focus. John stared intently at them for any minute hint that the dragon was in fact lurking behind those eyes whose mishmash of colours he’d come to adore. That it had managed to tag along for the ride and was about to spring free once the connection between mind and body had been properly re-established.
With his free hand, he took the doctor’s hand, which wasn’t pulled away, and placed the watch in the palm, closing the fingers around it gently, relishing the contact just a little. Again, John let him.
The inner voice sounded uncomfortably like Moriarty, and though he wanted to, he couldn’t quite manage to dismiss it.
The blond moved forward, slowly and carefully, taking in as much of his surroundings as possible, even though the roof and the immediate surroundings weren’t lit – another small favour from Mycroft that would cost him with dividends – keeping alert.
To find Sherlock looking intently at him with just about the oddest expression John had ever seen on him, which was quite an achievement given all that had gone before.
“Another time?” he said, and it came out as a question rather than a promise.
But the point remained; where had he got to? If there was no case on, then he ought to be around here somewhere. It wasn’t as if he was particularly keen on going out and celebrating with the greater London population, either – the mere thought of it had a screech of something running down the doctor’s spine – and John had heard or seen no indication that he was visiting Mrs. Hudson.
Tears were underselling it, too; sobs were the more appropriate term to describe the way his whole body seemed to heave and shake, the wailing issuing from him only subdued because it all happened in the back of his throat, like a distressed whale imitator.
With everything.
As though it wasn’t aware already, if not of the individual things then of the potential in general, at least. Whatever else you said about it, this was his dragon.
Then the man leaned back, though in John’s opinion nowhere near far enough.
(See the end of the chapter for
Moriarty glanced at John again. “Of course. Goes both ways, doesn’t it? Lucky for you, wasn’t it, Johnny boy? Someone to take you out of the ivory tower at last when you weren’t about to do it yourself.”
As he did so, his lips spread in a more fully-grown version of the grin from before. It almost seemed to stretch beyond the boundaries of his face, fanciful and bloody ludicrous as that sounded. His dark brown eyes seemed almost black.
This was Moriarty, however, and while he wasn’t the strongest of people, let alone Alphas, he more than made up for that with his mind.
...I give up on chapter summaries, okay? It's probably just making it all worse.
The pause was small but there. It didn’t seem born out of reluctance, though. “...Of course. I’ll get you a pass out to see them as soon as it is possible. In the meantime, I’m afraid you will have to take my word for it. They are protected to the very best ability, from both Moriarty and the owners.”
He was still bound and therefore, he couldn’t grab hold of Moriarty. That didn’t stop him, as he instead chose to barrel into the man, hoping to knock him over. He managed to do so, Sherlock letting go of the hand he held in the process, but by momentum, he went over as well.
He wouldn’t be turning them on just yet, however, at least not the ones that had been especially made. It had been something he’d considered but had ultimately decided against it, just as he had, quite vehemently, vetoed Mycroft’s tacky suggestion that they should spell out something.
His eyes widened and he flung off the duvet in an instant, trying to get out of bed immediately.
All of this certainly would’ve been easier and with less unknowns in the mix if he hadn’t had to rely on other people for parts of it. The studio fire being a case in point. On the other hand, he couldn’t deny, nor had he any wish to, that it had made things possible that otherwise wouldn’t have been and what they had created for him was…
“John, I don’t need a shave,” Sherlock said as the blond readied what he’d need. It probably was intended to come out sounding surly but instead, it came out sounding strangely adorable in its childish moping quality. It was probably the slight slurring lisp that did it.
Shielding was only something dragons did to things they cared…no, not even that. It had nothing to do with whether they cared about the object they were shielding or not. It had to do with claiming of the object in question, nothing more.
“If you want to resort to banal idioms, then yes.”
“Sherlock!” The indignance was mitigated slightly by the hint of incredulous laughter.
But what were Sherlock’s intentions? Not to claim him, according to his own statement, but that could mean, if he followed the line of thought, not that he didn’t want to claim him at all but merely not as a dragon traditionally would. Instead, it could be…
However, the coincidences were just a tad too great for it to have been an Alpha fitting the Irishman’s description that had just happened to have picked this house to visit and assault the occupants.
“…You would. Don’t even start, you always just expect me to take whatever you say at face value and I’m lucky if I get you to answer half the questions I ask, if even any of them at all.”
“It’s not! That’s the – we’re supposed to tell each other…”
“When do you have time and where should we meet? – SH’ Sherlock wrote, ignoring the comment.
Sherlock was looking at him now rather than the finger but, when the blond quickly glanced down at the digit again, it was still the same amount that had been shifted and was kept shifted.
I thought there was something else I needed to mention but it's slipped my mind atm.
Not that they were exactly being ogled or stuck out like a couple of sore knots, anything like that, and this wasn’t the larger square with the small market they had passed on the way in, but even so, there was no need to draw more attention to themselves than absolutely necessary.
“No. He hasn’t been here,” John said but the answer came a little too quickly. Not enough to suggest that he was lying, just that it was a truth covering over something else that he was happy enough not to say.
He didn’t know but he tried to push his cheek into the hand that had only just begun to drop, trying to make up for his mistake.
“I know,” the blond said, in that same quiet tone. “Just one of those things that occurred to me now that I had a bit of time to sit and think about things after all this began. Not that I’ve been sitting here for ages watching you sleep or anything. That’d be – “
Two more steps, then he was right there.
Then there was the matter of shaving. That really needed to be done now before it grew too long, just in case the idiot ended up conking out for the next 48 hours. Of course, you could shave that long a ‘beard’, too, without too much trouble but he’d prefer not to have to.
He got a raised eyebrow for his trouble and another hand gesture to indicate to get on with it.
asked his inner voice.
When he looked a little lost, however, because honestly, it was difficult not to, one of the staff came up and asked.
‘John? – SH’
Watching John’s face, it seemed as though it did. After the initial, split-second reaction of not knowing what was happening and therefore trying to prepare for the worst, that familiar, beloved, guarded yet so wonderfully expressive face lit up, almost despite itself. The eyes widened a little and the mouth opened in first an ‘oh’ and then a slowly spreading smile.
He told Sherlock, of course. He wasn’t that stupid, even if the Alpha wasn’t capable of working it out, and not just because John wasn’t physically there. Not because he felt he needed permission, either. Again, it fell more into common bloody courtesy, removed from primary and secondary gender norms.
Oh, no that wasn’t necessary. Not at all, the Beta hastily reassured him. He was just glad that they had come to help and so quickly, too.
“The concrete details of when, where and how has been formulated in the last few days, but it’s started to come together in the last week, yes.”
They became independent while you would always be theirs, your heart in their pockets or wherever else they have tossed it without a care or a second thought.
That, in combination with the date and the missing details, sent bells tingling in his mind. Or perhaps ‘clanging’ was the better term.
Well,
John snorted minutely but with a lot of feeling for all that.
John blinked. Then he swallowed hard, trying not to get caught up in the instinctive hurt that bloomed forth at that. Telling himself that Sherlock hadn’t meant it like that, even if it did sound very much like him.
“What a hostile reaction, Doctor Watson. And here I thought we’d developed something of rapport after everything that has happened.”
“Sorry about that, I was…” He stopped and shook his head. When he stopped, his smile was a little broader, a little more genuine. A little more…present, too. “That’s good. That’s properly good. Makes the next bit easier, hopefully. Or possibly unnecessary, of course, there’s always that possibility…though better that than the other way around, eh?”
Succinct summary, for once, at least, and hopefully accurate.
What? “Sorry…you’ve lost me. What are you on about?”
Damn Mycroft to – no, Hell wouldn’t be sufficient for him. Not by a long shot.
As that warmth spread, however, he thought he saw something at the depth of those blue eyes. Something…not calculating. Nothing that cynical but nevertheless, something secretive.
In fact, he’d probably think worse of him for being a dragon than he would for thinking he might’ve said something like that.
“It goes into our bones. Whatever we collect is stamped into our bones in the sense that it leaves a small trace behind for every item, in much the same sense as vitamins are stored in the liver for a human being or, perhaps more accurately, minerals are stored in the bones for them. How it works exactly is…somewhat mystical,” he made a small grimace at that, as though the fact that it had to be explained so imprecisely was painful, “owing to the inherent and frustratingly uncatalogued magic at work. But the fact of the matter is that does work.”
“When it’s imperative we get it right, seeing as it might be what separates either of us from succumbing to the dragon in some way or other, and I have deleted everything? How stupid do you think I am?”
Too well-behaved? Ought she have picked up that something was amiss? It was hardly a normal situation, or at least, so he wouldn’t have thought and certainly wouldn’t have hoped.
He fought against the darkness of the room as he sought to check on whether any part of the brunet had shifted while he was asleep. The danger wasn’t the issue but more to see whether it was something they would need to keep in mind. For Sherlock’s peace of mind.
“They’re…safe, aren’t they?” he asked, his tone a little abrupt.
John in front of him a little way away, in a chair. He had come to bed, though. Sherlock knew that he had; even though the conversation had been a bit away, he could remember the bed dipping and the warmth and presence of the blond settling in beside him.
Instead, Sherlock just continued to look at him, that same expression on his face.
The point, however, was that he liked John’s appearance, full stop, and that he thought he looked as good pregnant as he did when he wasn’t. That he liked the curve of him this much almost unquestionably had something to do with his instincts, too, obviously, but perhaps what surprised him was really that it felt like it went beyond that.
“For what, exactly?” he asked, voice careful in its curiosity.
That was reserved for his bond mate’s expression and, now that he was inside the flat, the scent coming off him. Both of which sent the emotions that he’d been struggling to get under control earlier flaring back up far stronger than the first time.
What he had done was look at John intently with those pale eyes that seemed to strip you down to your last molecule and most carefully kept secret.
“You’re trying to get revenge for all the long explanations I’ve put you through in the time we’ve known each other, aren’t you?”
Allowed him to wrest just enough control back to get a firm grip on the foot. It tried to rise, to swipe at him but he held fast.
In fact, there was something almost comforting in the knowledge that, even when presenting it with the evidence right in front of it, without any attempt at hiding or distorting it, it was not able to see what was going on and what would happen. It was too blinded by its own arrogance and fear, which did feed into each other.
“Well, no, obvious – “John interrupted, then stopped, feeling stupid.
Thank you for the understanding and support from the last chapter, guys. Admitting to something like ABI wasn't easy to do so thank you. ❤️
The fact that he didn’t panic with the fear of what that meant, what it could possibly was…well, it was a fairly good indicator of whatever else was going on, around him and in his mind. That and character, but John didn’t seem to register that fact.
Why had he done that? Even now, after everything, he wasn’t entirely sure. All he knew was that it had been impossible for him to give it…
That said Alpha was indeed working for Moriarty, John was no longer in doubt of. The owners wouldn’t pull stunts like this and they certainly wouldn’t find any satisfaction in riling him up like this.
realisation, at least, and one which sent his eyes wide and his mouth into a little oval.
“We did just both say the words, ‘I do’, didn’t we? Ergo, husband, not partner.”
Aside from that, yes. Let’s leave the endangering of your life to the experiments, yeah?”
“Oh, he
Or possible like the valves of an exploded steam engine.
All the more reason for Sherlock to in fact get a ruddy move-on already and sort this out. Not just the jealousy, though that was obviously the main factor, whether he truly believed there was any or not, but check whether there were any other emotions or other such things that showed a crack or other weakness that could be exploited.
Cliffhangers! I gots them. Yay?
She winced and sagged in her bonds as it was squeezed, quite hard by Sherlock’s estimation. However, she did not in fact cry out or even tear up.
One hand rose, then hovered for a moment of uncertainty before it dropped to card through thick curls in what could only be described as a soothing, comforting gesture. It ought to look at odds with their normal relationship, or at least what John knew of it, but somehow, here, now, it felt as right as anything, an older brother caring for his suffering younger sibling.
“And if I couldn’t? Don’t tell me you didn’t consider that.”
He didn’t want John to see the smile as being at his expense. Not that he was likely to, but there was a chance and they ought to be focusing on other things.
“You,” he said, simply, keeping his dark brown eyes fixed on the blond. As if that was all there was to it.
The point was that John had been strong throughout the whole encounter, that was abundantly easy to spot even though he’d been rather utilitarian in what he’d related, had faced someone like that with steel and determination, despite the utter curveball he’d been thrown by the double whammy that was the bibs and the dress.
“So you still plan to add him. Why? If he’s that insignificant, surely it doesn’t matter. Oh, he could expose you, but you know he wouldn’t and regardless, you don’t care whether you’re exposed to the world or not. In fact, you want the world to know. You plan to add the whole world to your hoard, or the best bits of it, so why do you have need of one puny army doctor of no significance?”
He wasn’t going to give the thing the satisfaction of any kind of reaction, least of all the one it was fishing for, and that meant he had to contain the sneer that wanted to spring out. It didn’t deserve his anger and it most definitely didn’t deserve his fear.
he was, regardless of when and how that revelation had come about. Of course, it hadn’t exactly helped that it had been Moriarty who’d revealed to John that dragons existed and that he’d been…not exactly forced but still, he hadn’t had much choice about outing himself, too. It had all been instinctive.
“How many?” Sherlock demanded.
With that, he closed the door, emphatically but not hard. He stayed where he was, listening for footsteps going back down the stairs.
For its truth.
Ignoring it, he made himself look at Sherlock, to see if he’d picked up on the reference. It would be an odd thing for Sherlock to know, all things considered, but at the same time, he often had knowledge of the most seemingly irrelevant things.
Really, not that much weirder than the rest of it, if he was being entirely honest. A different flavour of strange to go with the palette explosion that had already happened in his life ever since he had been kidnapped by Moriarty, that was all.
It wasn’t helped when the ashen-blond boy gave him another of those warm smiles and held out a hand in greeting.
What he saw wasn’t what he expected to see, even if he hadn’t mentally articulated quite what that expectation was.
“Probably the same person who taught you, I imagine, brother mine,” Mycroft quipped, unperturbed. He stepped further into the living room, almost but not quite coming up beside them.
John, finding that his legs were suddenly, finally cooperative once more, darted over to the front door to close and lock it. Trying not to think about the fact that in the process he was also locking himself in with two dangerous creatures, for all that he knew them, he looked around the living room.
Eventually, it petered out into some gentle giggling and then silence descended between them. It was a lighter silence, somehow, than the one that went before.
Again, I do apologise for the wait and I hope that there aren't too many glaring errors in this as a result. I am trying really hard to juggle everything that I have going, but it's difficult, especially these longer stories (with lore and changes and everything), for a multitude of reasons I shan't bore you with.
“I believe that you love me,” John said in answer to his unspoken question, confirming at least some of it. “Genuinely, or why would you have waited to this point? If you just wanted to claim me, there’s been plenty of opportunity for that during our friendship. Hell, you could’ve just done it when you were wrapped around me back at the pool, if that was all that you wanted. You were certainly agitated enough about someone else having a go at it, what with the blood and everything. Is that what you bond with, by the way? Must be, since you mentioned arteries earlier.”
Of course, he had been curled around John when they’d been shot at, his front hidden by the blond, as it were, and so he was free of wounds on his front. His wings and tail were also on his back, which meant less to accommodate for on his front.
To be honest, though, John’s priority was more on snapping the lid on the box shut as quickly as possible so that none of the lumps fell out and was wasted. Thankfully, he succeeded.
How was he – did John not want Tessa back after all? But that was all that he’d…well, not all that he had talked about, there was no need for added hyperbole, but it had been such a crucial part of him for so long. They had fought for this, in so many ways. John had
“Wait, what?”
He couldn’t argue much with that point, could he?
When he didn’t react, however, he still did get a reaction in turn, and it wasn’t quite a positive or even an indifferent one.
“And what if I want everything?” he whispered and his voice had dropped a little, which sent another, stronger shiver up John’s spine. “What if I want you to open me slowly and then slide in, filling me over and over again?”
he was.
He didn’t know how else to describe it. Some of it was the traditional feeling of being sickened by something, which in this case was, well…
But not only that; John would have, if he had indeed been bred by the Irishman, told Sherlock. Without a doubt, he would have, quite apart from the probable likelihood that John’s reaction to the two of them meeting Moriarty back in the harem would have been more mixed or at the very least, more visceral. Not that it had been exactly mild, to say the least, but even so, he would have expected…more.
Apropos of that…wasn’t there a question that he hadn’t answered? He thought there might be, but he wasn’t sure.
“No, it’s not. I’m saying I love you and I want to work this out. Yes, so there are some sticking points and things to sort out still.” He paused, considering. Then he smiled. “But honestly, compared to how we usually go about it, I’m actually a little proud of us. I mean, we’ve talked about it and everything.”
“I wouldn’t expect you to believe me straight away, no questions asked,” he said, sounding as though he meant it.
“It looks…it looks like someone decided to make a lifesaver out of fabric and foam and still managed to completely screw it up.” Sherlock took it and held it up, still looking entirely mystified as he peered through the ring in the middle.
“Sherlock. Enough already. Go to bloody sleep, okay? I’m here and I’m not going anywhere, I promise, so just…do as you’re asked for once and get some bleeding kip. You need it and so do I.”
“And it hardly takes much effort to guess who that someone is.”
Speaking of that conversation, the blond was surprised to discover, once he’d woken, Sherlock wrapped around him like a creeping vine and deeply asleep still, that he had retained a good portion of it. Not all, which was possibly just as well, but he thought most of it was there.
He could ask the Alpha, he supposed, but he highly doubted that he’d get any sort of answer, never mind a useful one.
There would always be as much as they all needed, he said, his smile one of warmth and reassurance.
opportunity, at least. Just…a few?”
No, but he couldn’t attack him unprovoked, either and not just because he might face a fight that wouldn’t end well.
“We? Who are ‘we?’” Sherlock asked, even though he had a rather good idea. There weren’t a whole lot of people it could conceivably be, after all, if it had something to do with the dragon. Which it would, given that it was the watch John had taken and had decided to present to him.
They hadn’t said what would happen if he couldn’t shift, however. His wings felt solid and physical, with no hint that he could slip his coat over them or similar. That wasn’t even counting the other places on his body the bullets had touched, superficially or not so much.
One might have expected it to be a long journey. At least as long as the last if not longer. His Mind Palace was certainly capable of...shifts.
He trailed his fingers over the stubble like he had before, the gesture tender.
He couldn’t change who or what he was or what that consequently entailed. Hence why they were here in the first place rather than at their usual downtime activities, arguing not included, or even snuggled together on this very bed after a round of John teaching about the more physical aspects of a romantic relationship.
“No.”
John nodded agreement. There was still one thing, though, that bugged him about this.
John and Sherlock gets a lift from Mycroft to the airport and during the crawl there, they talk.
Sherlock had declined that, without his usual sniping in the process. Well, without too much of it, which was progress in itself. He hadn’t given his brother an answer as to why, but that was hardly surprising.
“Isn’t surveillance of the entirety of England your milieu, including the dragons therein?” He didn’t get an answer. “I don’t. Sorry. The best I’ve got is that he called me while you were…stalling Sherlock. Don’t know the time frame or whether it was a pay-as-you-go but…”
‘Why is that funny? Seriously, though, I’d like to, but I keep getting glares from our teacher, and I don’t want my phone confiscated. I’ll write you after classes finish, okay?’
Which meant, quite apart from the fact that there was a body with its stomach and chest sliced with surgical skill, that he was missing someone.
“Molesting isn’t merely screwing up.”
Or maybe, what to do.
He took a breath but ploughed on before Sherlock could start talking. “I know, too, that it’s been for a reason but that doesn’t really make much of a difference.”
They kissed, long and slow and warm. A kiss during which Sherlock decided that it didn’t matter whether John had found a ring as well. Or even that it could end up a giant but glorious mishmash of the both of them trying to propose at the same time.
“I don’t, I can’t – John, please –!“
That wasn’t even mentioning the smell but at least John wouldn’t be able to detect that. As for the dragon himself, he was somewhat surprised that he could regard the tableau in front of him so dispassionately.
The melody continued to play as John stared at the box, his grip on Sherlock’s fingers tightening gradually even as his hand trembled, his throat working and his eyes got progressively shinier, though that might in part still be the snowflakes made of light twinkling all around them in the set-up Sherlock’s contact had created.
Sherlock would have to admit, though it couldn’t be said to be with any reluctance on his part, that he’d created a very beautiful tune for John the year before. Of course, he’d known that at the time but it was still something to hear it played by someone, something else, a year on and find it just as good as he had at the time. Just as beautiful and as fitting for John and his feelings for him.
Honestly, though, he would rather not have a brain like Sherlock’s, with all the problems the man had as a result of it. Dragon. Man.
Almost without his conscious decision, he felt his eyes roam over that body, the hands-on knowledge of what exactly was under those tight clothes only serving to enhance the experience.
“Am I not allowed to look?” Sherlock asked, quiet. Slightly uncertain, even now.
Simultaneously, it had been reassuring and unsettling.
He thought he heard the chair in the background scrape and teeter and then slam back down with a short, sharp thump but didn’t turn towards the chair and its occupant, either, though that was more because he still didn’t dare take his eyes off Moriarty.
attempted to claim him in that sense, and Mycroft wouldn’t have used that phrasing if he believed, or could sense, that it had been successful. He always weighed his words rather carefully, didn’t he? So why hadn’t it? Was that failure instrumental or more incidental?
“I am not my brother.”
“I’ll tell you as many times as I need to for you to believe me; I am not leaving you.”
Pulling him further away from the human interaction that he didn’t need. He had his cases and his mental stimulation, free of all the squabbling of dynamics and primary and secondary genders, free of emotional squalor.
Wouldn’t that have lessened the impact of what he’d done? It would definitely have compromised if not outright ruined the plan and that wouldn’t do.
Sherlock could wait him out, and he did, just listening and hoping that the window where John had time to write wasn’t slipping him by, having to deal with this idiocy.
In fact, Sherlock thought he saw the hope from before gradually bloom in the blue eyes he loved so much. Delight, too, he believed, though possibly that was a trick of the light around them, which lit up the doctor’s face in a very pleasing way.
If Sherlock was unsure of what to do, the very least John could do was try and help him.
was kissing him. John was
“We cannot save the whole world in one go with a big sweeping gesture, but we can make it better bit by small bit, is that what you’re saying?” he asked, attempting light but managing only quiet and earnest.
Sherlock put a hand on his shoulder. Not hard, not really restraining. Just…grounding. Anchoring, in a sense.
So, why would he be uncertain of the one thing they’d had as a certainty from the start? Unless he didn’t think he’d make it himself. But still, that didn’t quite tally. If he was uncertain of whether he’d make it, surely, he’d just leave it out entirely?
Now he wanted a shower and a scrubbing brush. One with steel wool as its brushes.
to the one who had to deal with you in that state and knows exactly what he’s up against! The person who has managed to not only avoid being killed or claimed despite the efforts you put in to do both, but has worked on helping you in any way he could ever since you fell comatose – just as he always had, I might add!”
Of course, as is so often the case, one person snickering, giggling or similar will set off someone else and back again until the feedback loop has not only completed, but escalated gradually until they were both laughing, almost helplessly, their hands still clasped together as the laughter shook their bodies.
“You assume she wouldn’t have wanted to know whether you were bought by someone else.”
“Not just because of your association with Sherlock?” The implications ‘wanting to screw with you to get to Sherlock’ didn’t need to be said to be heard.
Sherlock nodded and let himself be led out of the building. He ignored the eyes that followed them, more focused on the fairground ride his head and heart were currently experiencing.
“Because…oh. Of course.” He wasn’t stable at the best of times, even John had experienced that, and had just been lucky not to bear more of the brunt of it than he had.
A flare of jealousy blazed within him but died as quickly as it had risen. Mycroft had no designs on John – if he had, there would’ve been plenty of opportunity to take him while Sherlock had been unconscious from the poisoning.
“Ten out of ten for observation. Well done.”
“Sherlock,” John said by way of greeting, not quite knowing how he ought to handle this situation.
“Then why do you insist that it’s okay when it’s not?”
His bond with Sherlock, particularly seeing as it was a scent bond and the unknown Alpha father did muddy the waters a bit, of course, but even so, the parameters they could be a hundred percent on were strong enough and numerous enough to give the green light for the rest of the investigation to go ahead.
“Don’t push it on the blatancy of the lie, Mycroft,” Sherlock said as he sauntered into the office. He considered taking off his scarf, but he wasn’t going to stay around for long. Any crime committed around here was going to be utterly boring. “We’ve never made much of a concession to the season or other family stuff, there’s no need to start on it now.”
It wouldn’t hurt to stay for just a bit. Or so he’d thought.
What could that possibly be?
The moment he opened his mouth coincided with his finger slipping and popping open the lid of the box all the way.
Not that there was anything that obviously wrong. There couldn’t have been, or he couldn’t have pulled off ‘Jim from IT’, could he? And he most certainly had pulled that off, to the point that no one, not even Sherlock, had registered anything was amiss.
“Pot and kettle?”
Sherlock wanted to argue. Wanted to dismiss it all and say that John was exaggerating his statements, and he wasn’t that bad, even though he knew that John was right. Instead, he kept quiet and listened, knowing that John wasn’t done speaking yet, in any case.
Then he could react however he wanted to because Sherlock could, and would, have hidden himself away somewhere, either in their bedroom, John’s room or possibly down in 221C. He wouldn’t leave the building, of course, even though he’d want to, but he wouldn’t be there to see the other’s face.
Sherlock didn’t answer which was answer enough. John didn’t know what to say, his mouth dry and his tongue a leaden weight.
“It’s nothing, really,” he said, smiling to emphasise the point.
Perhaps he could use that to his advantage. If he couldn’t hear any individual, it made it harder for them to make themselves heard, all of them working towards the same goal and getting in each other’s way.
Mycroft, who’d taken as many steps backwards as he could, was breathing hard and ragged by that point, as though he’d exerted himself immensely, his eyes now squeezed firmly shut. He was even paler than before, the also increased ruddiness bringing it into starker relief and now there was a sheen of perspiration on his brow. There was a minute but somehow still noticeable tremor in his limbs and the images had yet to fade.
Making up his mind to just be right behind John for when he was needed, Sherlock nudged his partner, who was watching the city pass by him, literally but also somewhat metaphorically.
There was silence for a moment after that, a moment that seemed to stretch far beyond the time it lasted.
John, somehow holding onto a shred of wakefulness despite his body’s extremely valiant fight to shut down, watched and felt his friend succumb to sleep. It was less to do with wanting to watch him sleep than it was to ascertain whether…not really whether he was truly safe from the dragon, whatever beliefs Sherlock might still cling onto, but how he’d behave towards having another body so close while he slept.
Looking at him out of the corner of his eye confirmed that; though he was still holding Sherlock’s hand, the rest of his body language screamed arms crossed, leaned back a little, eyebrows raised; take your shot, mate, go ahead, I’m not going to stumble or even flinch.
Talking it through with John on more than one of those occasions had…assisted in keeping a bit of a lid on the fear, too.
They were hers more than she was theirs. As were all true parents, really.
“For the other, you got lost in your own head, even if only for a little bit, and you didn’t lose control of anything. Again. That is, it wasn’t the first time you didn’t, meaning you can do it repeatedly without having, as far as I can tell, to struggle with it.”
Again, there was a lot that John didn’t know, and in all likelihood never would, about his brother-in-law, he was perfectly aware of that. However, he wasn’t stupid, either, and it seemed very much the sort of thing someone with Mycroft’s personality, job and not least resources would check up on.
“That you have a desire to claim John, yes, but not in the way of claiming a treasure.”
