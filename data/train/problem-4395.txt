“Then it’s the same, you’re doing the same thing,” Castiel said, frowning, he watched Dean wipe his mouth with the back of his hand as he twisted the cap back onto the bottle.
Cas had gotten frustrated with himself and dropped a mug in the library, he’d looked damn close to crying about it (though that probably had more to do with, well,
“Not that I’m complaining, but what happened to your costume?” Claire asked, twisting slightly on the vinyl stool.
“Stay, just today, and tonight, stay. Stay for more than a couple of minutes, couple of hours. Stay the night with me,” Dean said, like a dam had burst and it was impossible to stem the flow now the words were free.
“So was taking me from the hospital, but you did that didn’t you?” Castiel said, opening his eyes to glare across the table at Sam, jaw set.
“I can’t wait to get home and finally sleep on a decent mattress,” Sam said, stretching his long limbs, “feels like we’ve been on the road for a month instead of a week,” he added, and turned to sign for Eileen. She nodded, tried and failed to suppress a yawn, and Dean smiled as he watched an errant tear trail down her cheek.
“As I said earlier Dean, I want to be here and I want to be a part of your life, but I have a duty to heaven too,” Cas said, voice even and steady like a lazy river pulling Dean along, and he turned his hand over under Dean’s.
“I don’t think she’s gonna turn us into immortal cats Dean,” Sam threw back, scowling at his brother, “and anyway, you’re not exactly a virgin.”
“If you count driving from Lebanon to Jasper, we’ve been driving for twelve hours,” Jack said, phone in hand as he checked the time.
“No,” Jack replied, suddenly serious, “I expended nearly all my energy restoring everything and everyone,” he explained.
“To me, this,” Dean gestured to Cas, who was standing awkwardly by the open toolbox, “has always been you, but you used to have some form, you said that your true form was as tall as the Chrysler building, but most humans couldn’t see your true form or hear your true voice, me included,” he continued, leaving out the parts where he’d made Dean’s ears bleed and melted Pamela’s eyes right out of her face.
He wanted to fix everything. Every single misstep and mistake he’d made, all the people he’d betrayed and done wrong by, Castiel wanted to make everything right again. But things hadn’t really been right in the first place and he didn’t know where to start.
“Holy shit,” Dean yelled, he struggled to right the car as it swerved across the lanes, they were damn lucky that there wasn’t anyone out on these back roads at four in the morning. “What the fuck Cas?”
He kicked the ancient TV stand over. The CRT dropped to the floor with a thunk and the floorboards beneath it creaked dangerously. It landed screen down, and Dean broke the back open with the butt of his gun. There was nothing inside.
As he stepped away from Jack, Dean ruffled his already unruly hair, and Jack ducked his head as he laughed. He had a lot to repair between them and that started here.
“She’s a friend, and she’s Claire’s guardian, or well she used to be, I guess Claire’s grown out of that by now in a way,” Dean said in a sort of roundabout way, obviously thinking as he spoke. “Jody kind of runs a home for wayward girls,” he added, grinning at Castiel.
“I don’t even wanna think about how many times we’ve died,” Sam muttered, brows furrowed as his eyes slid over to Dean.
“And you haven’t stopped?” Sam said, sounding suddenly wide awake. His brows slid up his forehead and almost disappeared into his hairline, Dean tried not to roll his eyes.
“There is much that I love about Earth,” Cas began, eyes turned back toward the sloping hill, the town below them and the sky above. “Nature holds so much intricate beauty that I could stare at it for a thousand years and still find something new to see and marvel at. And mankind has built so much out of all of this, good and bad things, and all of it is a marvel both terrifying and awe inspiring. You all struggle everyday to live to the next one. And every choice you make is a gift, and despite everything it put you through Dean, I’m glad you made the choices you did, because they brought our paths together,” he said, speaking like all the books Dean had ever read and half forgotten.
“Yes,” Castiel nodded, unsure as to why the clarification was needed, “how does someone know whether they’re in love or not?”
His eyes fell on a boy skittishly glancing around, he was leaned heavily over the table, and he looked embarrassed and perhaps a little terrified. Castiel watched as the boy scratched a few words in a notebook apparently copied from the open book besides him before nervously looking around the library again. That cycle repeated for a while, the behaviour intrigued and confused Castiel. Eventually the boy hastily gathered his things and bolted from the building. He had left the book on the table.
“Oh yeah, in Dodge City, he knew who all those cowboys were,” Jack signed, leaning a little further over the bed, mouth moving wordlessly around the words. “He even brought his cowboy boots with him.”
That was how Dean found himself perched on the edge of the counter trying not to lose himself in the ocean of Cas’ eyes. The rough pads of his fingertips captured Cas’ jaw as he dragged the razor over his skin.
“You and your brother owe me nothing, but your help is greatly appreciated,” Castiel said, returning Sam’s smile, and left.
“However, prolonged listening at this volume can cause damage to your hearing, which would greatly affect your ability to hunt,” Castiel continued, ignoring the interruption, and he stated the facts as plainly as always.
“I suppose there’s a reason behind the nickname,” Cas said, it didn’t seem to be the time to get into it, and besides he felt more connected to the name than he did
“Can we talk?” Castiel asked, stood in the doorway of the kitchen. Sam had been on his way to bed when Castiel arrived and told him where he could find his brother.
He was sick of flicking through the channels of never ending reruns only to find that he recognised more than half the shows. And he even knew the jingles to an alarming quantity of the commercials too. Apparently, he spent an inordinate amount of time watching television and he was going to have a lot to say about that to Dean when he finally got there.
“I don’t really have one, it’s just something I noticed,” Sam said with a shrug, and took a sip of his water.
Dean sighed, heart still stuttering between his lungs, at least Cas hadn’t heard his exact words. Not that Cas would have read anything in them. Sam was there, though he was asleep, he could wake up at any moment and call Dean out on his bullshit.
He heard more than saw Cas follow suit, switching the lamp off. And wasn’t it something, to be lying in a bed next to the bed where the person who arguably meant most to him lied, and they didn’t even know it. Dean remembered Michael’s words, ‘
The slow and fitful way his memories were coming back to him probably wasn’t helping either. Though, Dean was surprised by the things Cas was remembering, he still seemed frustrated with himself.
As they walked, Dean stayed close to his side. He’d murmured something about how no one would notice that they were doing anything they weren’t supposed to if they just acted with confidence. And Cas figured that he was right, considering that they had done just that.
It was the first memory he’d reclaimed and it was frustrating that it was something so inane. There wasn’t anything about it that told him much of anything about himself. Though, he did wonder if the man that had been beside him was Dean, but he supposed he’d find that out soon enough.
a morning person (though that might have more to do with the mounting pain due to the time between doses of painkillers than anything else), and he’d been to a lot of motels. For some reason, all of the memories that had come back to him so far consisted of dank cheap motel rooms. He wasn’t sure what any of that said about him, but it certainly wasn’t much.
“Uh, sort of,” Dean said, scratching at the back of his neck. “It’s not how we met, but sometimes we’d ask you for help with whatever we were dealing with, and sometimes you asked us for help.”
He grabbed the first aid kit from the cabinet and called Cas over with a curl of fingers. Cas rolled his eyes, that full bodied thing that he did because he’d never learnt how to do it normally, and approached Dean again.
The hospital was on the smaller side, and finding Cas’ room again took far less time than Dean wanted. He’d hoped to have a least a little time to collect himself, but he doubted that he’d ever be fully prepared to meet that face and know that it didn’t know him.
“Oh, right,” Dean said, likely remembering that he’d left a near memory-less man alone in an unfamiliar motel room without so much as a note. “I’m just at a nearby bar, I’ll be back soon though, you should probably go back to sleep, don’t worry about me,” he went on ,glossing over the fact that he’d left in the middle of the night to go off drinking.
“Cas, the near three years we’ve known each other, that’s nothing to you, you’ve been around for millions of years and sometimes I wonder if you’ll poof off to heaven for a while and when you come back it will have been too long and we won’t know each other anymore,” Dean said, eyes resolute and steady on the road ahead, but he could feel his hands shaking and readjusted his grip.
“I get the feeling that you gave me good reason to be so rude,” Cas said, and turned his sharp eyes onto Dean, thrilling Dean with his stare and the knowledge that Cas was getting a better idea of their particular dynamic.
A mirror image swept into his mind. Stood by a car, saying goodbye instead of hello, with Claire’s arms over his shoulders, they’d hugged before she departed. He remembered feeling a sense of pride in her and inadequacy in himself as he bid her farewell.
“Guys?” Sam called, his lumbering steps made the floorboards creak, the sound died in the doorway. “Ew, seriously?” he asked, looking between them as they reluctantly pulled apart.
Jack continued to stand beside the open door, face pointed into the wind as he squinted at the sky, Castiel didn’t remember having angelic powers, didn’t know what those powers were, and so he couldn’t miss them. But Jack was young, shockingly young, and he’d already lost so much. And still he seemed to do nothing but smile.
“I understand that it is a feeling difficult to translate into words,” Castiel said, in his research he’d come across vague illusions to metaphors and universal experiences that surely weren’t universal, and he had found most of them incomprehensible.
Four people filed into the room, he recognised them all, both from the photos on his phone and vaguely from his memory.
What was home to a man like Dean who hadn’t really ever known one? The home he’d grown up in was nothing more than a fading memory, good and bad all wrapped up together to make something that only hurt to think about, Dean didn’t think about it.
Something about being included in that list, though he already knew that Dean counted him among his family and friends, made a gooey kind of warm sensation spread out inside him. He wanted to hold onto it.
“You’re kind of a father figure to her, but I think Jody would be able to tell you more,” Dean explained.
“I suppose what would be most helpful would be for you to describe the nature of our lives,” Cas said finally, gaze steady as it returned to Dean.
“Yes, it is good,” Cas returned, staring right back at Dean, smiling slightly. The sun sat fat in the sky behind his head, light cascaded down around him like honey spilling over his shoulders, gold leaf in his inky hair, backlit and moody in a way that reminded Dean of exactly what Cas really was.
This was only the start of things and Castiel knew that there was more to come. Very early on in their relationship, Castiel had come to know that Dean rarely if ever found himself worthy or deserving, and Castiel felt that he had a lifetime (at least Dean’s lifetime) ahead of him of proving Dean wrong. He felt more than up to the challenge.
“What?” Dean shot back and Sam sighed. The smile fell from Sam’s face, and Castiel watched as Sam dragged his hand down his face. He seemed to take his time considering his words before he spoke again.
“Well, you’re welcome,” Dean returned, just as mush mouthed and bashful as Cas had been, which was very. He knew he wasn’t doing enough, it wasn’t enough and it was never going to be enough, but Cas didn’t know that and Dean was dreading the moment when he figured it out.
“You love me?” Dean said, the words punched out of him, brows riding high as he stared at Castiel unblinking.
Sitting beside Dean felt very familiar, and staring at Dean’s profile left filled him with fondness.
When Dean turned back to the beds, Cas was sat at the edge of his bed with the lamp’s low soft light warming the tones of his skin. Dean pressed the respective bottles into Cas’ hands and dropped down on the opposite bed. He made to lie back down and go back to not sleeping, but Cas spoke up again.
The heart-rate monitor beeped from somewhere to his right. Where the drip went in through the back of his hand was itchy, he followed the tubing to find the IV hung looming over his left side. His right arm was in a sling and rested against the stomach. He could feel the bandages around his head, the skin beneath the gauze and bandages was irritated, but he was wary of moving either of his arms to scratch at the undamaged skin.
“You’ve never met any other angels?” Castiel asked, and began to pick at the now fraying edge of his sling.
“Sam said that it can take up to a year for someone with amnesia to remember everything,” Jack said, and Castiel wondered why that hadn’t come up yet, but he supposed he’d been too busy chewing Sam out to allow him to say much of anything.
Though Castiel didn’t remember being able to heal his body or what was a supposed diminished sense of pain, from the moment he’d woken up memory free, he’d felt as though there was something very wrong with the discomfort and throbbing of his body. He was sure that anyone experiencing the particular injuries that he was suffering would find the healing tiresome and frustrating. However, there was something particularly irritating about the very nature of the way the human body healed. And it certainly didn’t help his mood that he now knew that, in the past, he could have healed himself in an instant.
Dampness clung to the tarmac and left the passing fields in a state of drab freshness. The rain had stopped, but Castiel could still taste it in the air that came in through the rolled down window. Familiar music blared from the car speakers, Sam and Dean were arguing about the appropriate level of volume, this was an argument that Castiel had witnessed many times before.
A crackling sensation broke like static through the air around them, as though a storm was just about to break, like lightning could strike right beside them at any moment. Dean found himself sat behind the wheel of the impala outside the bunker. Moments ago, they’d been stood at the edge of a lake watching as Chuck and Jack stared each other down, and now he was a couple hundred miles away and inside a his car. At least Sam was sitting shotgun beside him.
“Not that I remember being gone, but I am happy to be back,” Castiel returned, and patted Jack’s arm. The boy slipped out of his hold, drawing his arms away, Jack stepped back and rubbed at his face.
And though it didn’t really answer his question, Cas felt a tingling warmth settle within his centre and it radiated outward, it was comforting to know that he belonged somewhere.
“And that means that we have to drive aimlessly?” Cas asked, as though he were trying to figure out a particularly difficult puzzle, and Dean was just glad that he was trying.
“Hi,” the young man said as he came up to the side of the bed and stopped beside Dean. “How are you feeling Cas?” he asked, his white jacket was scuffed with dirt, as though he’d been rolling on the ground.
After a few moments of fumbling, Dean finally stumbled through the door with far more force than necessary, and the door hit the wall and swung back into Dean’s shoulder. Castiel winced at the sound. Dean murmured an apology and took extra care in closing the door softly, before he came further into the room. Soundlessly, Dean dropped onto the end of his bed, shrugged off his jacket and pulled off his boots, leaving both at the foot of the bed.
Dean’s heart stammered so hard in his chest that he had to gasp to catch his breath. He coughed into his fist, hiding his stumbling recovery.
Dean wanted to protest, he wanted to drive straight on through to Washington and to Cas, but he knew they couldn’t do that. His egg would be completely fried by the time they got there and he needed to be on his A game if he was going to be of any help to Cas. And it was getting harder to ignore the encroaching tiredness and the aching emptiness of his stomach, Sam was right and Dean needed to stop being such a stubborn idiot.
“I’m not going to tell you whether you’re in love or not. No one can do that, it’s one of those things that you have to figure out for yourself, that’s part of why it’s so hard to explain. But Cas, some people, well no one falls in love the same way and some people don’t fall in love at all or at least not romantically,” he rambled, scratching at his jaw, twitchy and uncomfortable.
“You blew it so far out of proportion,” Sam cut in, saying what Dean had tried to keep in, and it was just more proof that Sam knew him too well.
Dean nodded and patted Castiel’s shoulder before moving forward, Castiel missed the contact instantly. He followed Dean back toward Sam.
Dean’s heart stuttered in his chest, the force of it made him gasp, and he was blinking back tears before he knew it. It was Cas, it had to be. The woman on the phone was calling out to him.
“I dunno Cas, this is all kinds of fucked up, and sticking with you and helping you remember everything we’ve been through, we’ve been through a lot and, and I don’t know how I’m going to tell you how it all fits together or explain all of the awful stupid shit we’ve done to each other, and all the stupid fucked up shit we’ve done
“Us?” Dean repeated, brows raised, though he knew what Cas meant. He knew exactly what Cas meant and it was one of the many things he’d been dreading from the moment they had picked Cas up. It was one of those questions he’d been asking himself for years and he’d been terrified of the answer for just as long too.
“Don’t hang up,” Castiel begged, head in his hands, he knew he wouldn’t be able to just sit there in silence waiting however long it took Dean to get back.
With only a few hours to go, they had pulled up at a rest stop to stretch their legs, refuel themselves and Baby, grab something easy for dinner later, that and Eileen had been threatening to relieve herself all over the backseat if Dean didn’t stop within the next five miles. That woman was going give Sam hell, and Dean was looking forward to it, he smiled to himself.
“Don’t you treat me like some sort of exception?” Castiel asked, brow arched slightly as he regarded Dean.
“It can seem that way, yeah,” Dean returned, speaking around the pie, voice on the cusp of laughing.
“I am aware that the human experience is vast and varied,” Castiel said, hoping to reassure Sam, though he didn’t quite understand the man’s worries.
“Oh yeah, since you were an angel, you could go around wearing the same thing all the time without it getting dirty or smelling or anything, think you used your angelic grace to do a self laundry service and shower,” Dean explained.
“Hey, you’re supposed to be on my side,” Dean said, eyeing Castiel again through the rear view mirror, those green eyes were playfully accusing.
“I just, I don’t,” Dean stumbled over the words and groaned, “don’t make me the exception to every rule Cas, I swear I’m not worth it.”
“We’re not blood related, but we’re family,” Sam said, assured and firm, “we’re family in every way that matters,” he seemed like he wanted to reach out but he kept his hands to himself.
In a few short moments, Jack was back at his side, leaning through the open door with the bottles of water and painkillers in hand.
“Yes, this is the issue I’ve come up against in my own research,” Castiel returned, he frowned, brows brought together in frustration.
“I always wondered about that,” Sam said, squinting across the bench at Cas, “’cause the other angels we’ve met understood slang at least, and Balthazar had seen Titanic and knew who Celine Dion was.”
“Oh,” Sam breathed, brows raised. He turned again to sign for Eileen, and she had a similar reaction,
“So, what brings you down here with the common folk?” Dean asked, tinkering away at things that didn’t really need tinkering with. “Those assholes upstairs still giving you grief?”
It was clear that even if there wasn’t yet something between them, that there was the possibility for it. They’d spent most of the journey into Kansas signing back and forth in the backseat. Castiel had caught Sam blushing in the rearview mirror as Eileen laughed, and there was something private and intimate about the smiles they shared.
“If I knew how I felt, then why would I wait more than a decade to mention it?” It was something he’d been wondering since his discussion with Dean the previous day. He did not believe himself to be the kind of person or being that needed a decade to sort his feelings and express them to those around him, in the past week he had found it quite easy to make his feelings known.
With one day down and one or maybe two more to go, Jimmy (which still did not sit right with him) was struggling to find things to fill the day with and make the time go faster. There was only so long he could sleep especially given the discomfort his injuries were causing. That discomfort also meant that he couldn’t just go walking around the hospital, he stretched and walked a little but it wasn’t long before he had to sit down again, and the hospital clothes weren’t helping. Beyond watching television, he had hours to fill.
“We’ve had a lot of movie nights,” Jack interjected and then turned back to sign for Eileen, who smiled fondly back at him.
“Well you coulda told someone where you were going,” Sam bit out, “I know this is hard for you, but Dean, I can’t keep answering questions that you should be answering,” not only did he sound disappointed, but he was clearly angry too.
The stench of mildew and decay filled the air as Sam flipped the pages of the dusty tome on the table before him. It appeared to be some kind of census. Castiel watched the dust motes dance in the soft afternoon light. Dean was across the room, fiddling with the microfiche machine, looking through the local newspapers.
They could only be distantly blood related, but Cas doubted it. It didn’t make sense with the photos on his phone, or the text messages, or the memories where he sat staring at Dean’s profile lit in the washed out colours from the television screen wanting the moment to last forever.
Castiel knew, because he had been down this road so many times before, that this wasn’t going anywhere. He was beginning to wonder what he had wanted from this. Maybe he wasn’t really thinking. What was he hoping to get out of making Dean uncomfortable, which he knew Dean was, anyway? It wouldn’t do to push him into a corner, it would only make him lash out.
“I did,” Jack said, almost defensive, hands sliding into his jacket pockets as he turned to face Dean.
As he sat at the table, tiredness took over every inch of him, Castiel watched the others move with the simple joy of being home. And thenhe knew that he’d never stayed anywhere long enough to call it home.
“Uh, Dean got a call, and Cas, he’s alive and he’s in a hospital in Washington, he was hit by a car,” Sam said, words stilted as he did his best to sign along.
“Good,” Dean said, his breath swept over the phone and into Castiel’s ear, “sorry I left you on your own, shouldn’t have done that,” he went on, and sighed breezily.
“You’re still alive aren’t you?” Castiel shot back, head tilted, and arched a brow at Dean. “You’re alive and I love you.”
“I don’t remember, but I hope it’s not true,” Cas muttered, and turned his hopeful eyes to Sam, knowing he was going to be proven wrong. Apparently he was somewhat prideful.
“So, you’ve been aware of this for a while?” Castiel asked, sidestepping what he knew was a fair assessment of his behaviour, and what was also a reiterance of something Dean had somewhat drunkenly told him through the phone that one night.
“Uh, well I guess I should start with the fact that monsters exist: ghosts, ghouls, vampires, werewolves, witches, demons and angels, the whole shebang,” Dean began, and licked his dry lips before he continued, “and we hunt them, we’re hunters, that’s the job, the family business,” he said with the usual vigour.
“A good one, a really good one,” Castiel urged, speaking to Dean’s bed sheets and wishing that the man was there already, he ached to have those marsh green eyes staring back at him.
each other, and I’m kinda freaking out because I’m not good at all of this, I’m famously terrible at feelings, so I know I’m gonna mess this up,” Dean rambled, wiping his clammy hands against the sheets, chest tight as he watched Cas’ blank face.
“I dunno, maybe, but you’re barking up the wrong tree with me, I’m no good at all that romantic crap,” Dean said fork settled back down on the plate, he sat back in his chair.
“If I’m already dead, then I don’t understand how you’ll be able to kill me,” Castiel returned, head tilted as he watched her, Claire broke out in loud wet laughter.
“It’s not the weirdest thing Micheal’s ever been called,” Sam said, smirking slightly as he shared a look with Dean. Jack continued to sign for Eileen, though he seemed to be waiting for an opening to finish off his bacon and eggs, it was endearing.
“Wait, so you’ve got the power of God inside you, what about Amara?” Sam asked, alarm and concern barely restrained in the curled furrow of his brow.
“Yeah, I am,” Dean muttered, and decided to just go headlong into it. “When an angel comes down to Earth they have to possess a vessel, they possess someone’s body. You, well you’re still technically wearing what once was Jimmy Novak’s body,” he went on. He tried to focus on the task at hand and not watch Cas from the corner of his eye.
“Just get in the car,” Dean said and climbed into the driver’s side without waiting for Cas to follow. Cas followed anyway, sliding in beside Dean as he started up his baby’s engine. The radio came to life with the rest of her. He reached over and turned it down before he began to pull out of the junkyard, and Cas was staring hard at the side of his face all the while.
Sam seemed to take some time to think, considering what to say, Castiel was heartened that Sam was taking his enquiry seriously. He scanned the diner and observed its patrons and workers. Castiel had always been fascinated by the way people went about their days, interacted with each other, and conducted their lives. In such a short time, relatively, Castiel had learnt so much about humans but knew that he still had so much more to learn.
“It’s not all about whether you’re useful or what you can contribute,” Sam said firmly, his eyes flicked to Castiel for a moment before returning to Jack, leaving Castiel to wonder what that meant.
“His name is Dr. Sexy?” he said, now firmly back in the hospital room, confused and irritated. And he continued to scowl at the television.
Dean was right, Castiel did believe them. There was something about it that just felt right, it felt true, and he’d learnt so far not to challenge that feeling but to trust it.
“Yeah, let me just pretend that I know what that reference is,” Claire replied with a roll of her eyes.
“You said that it could take up to a year for me to remember everything,” Castiel said, head tilted back to stare at Sam as the man approached, he was taller than anyone had any right to be.
“Figures of speech are quite difficult,” Cas said, reassuring Jack with his easy smile, and the way Jack looked back at him, as though he’d put the stars in the sky left Dean melting. For all Dean knew, Cas just might have, or a few of them at least.
“Alright, well, why don’t you take Cas to the car then,” Dean said and passed Jack the keys, Jack took them with a nod, face set in a serious expression as though he’d taken up a very important task.
Castiel could have been doing something, probably should have been doing something, but he was having an incredibly difficult time focusing. The discussion from the car, hours previously, was still bothering him. Why? Well figuring that out wasn’t entirely beyond him. Castiel had learnt a lot of things in his long existence, but he had only been learning about his own emotions and feelings since he’d met Sam and Dean.
“I brought him back graceless, mortal, I figured that way the Empty can’t get him again and really it was the only way I was able to pull it off. And I placed him in North Cove, not for any particular reason, I guess it was just the first place that came to mind and I was resurrecting nearly eight billion other people at the time too,” Jack explained, blinking in that lost and innocent way of his, like a concerned puppy. “Though it is concerning that he’s in a hospital,” he added, frowning.
He and Jack appeared to text quite often too, though the tone was different. They mostly consisted of Jack asking him questions. Their messages were oddly paternal, and just looking at them had a kind of warmth settling in his chest. He wondered how old Jack was.
Movement from the backseat pulled Dean from his thoughts. Sam sat up, blinking groggily, as Eileen stretched beside him.
“Sure, go ahead,” Dean said, that easy smile crawled back across his face. “I should probably make a few calls myself, I mean I guess I should talk to Claire,” he went on as his eyes slid toward Castiel, “unless you wanna?”
The best he could do was clear Dean’s body of the horrors that had been recently wrought upon it. Castiel reached down, curled his hand around the side of Dean’s face, and healed him. He even cleared the blood from his body. Dean’s expression darkened as he rose from the floor.
“I don’t see how this discussion is relevant to the situation at hand,” Cas said, in his usual rough monotone, brows pinched.
“We hunt monsters?” Cas asked, brows raised as he watched Dean’s face, likely trying to tell whether he was lying or not.
“What’s going on?” Eileen asked, signing as she spoke, she looked between the three of them huddled on the sidewalk.
“Well, when I was doing my research I looked into the whole family, and for as far back as I could go, the whole family is spinsters and single moms,” Sam said, as though that explained everything, and it might have.
It wouldn’t do to start feeling like home was on the flutter of wings, a trench coat and a gruff voice, and unending misunderstandings and confusion.
There were countless photos of that man. Images of him at the wheel of a car, half way through eating something, with a bottle of beer in his hand, working on a car, and just generally existing filled over half of the album.
“Yeah,” Sam said, expression careful as he took a seat opposite Castiel, “I get that it must be really frustrating to know that you know something and not be able to remember it, but you’re just going to make yourself more frustrated and tired if you try too hard,” he went on, placating, tone soft.
What information he could pull from his phone wasn’t much more than what he’d already figured out on his own. It appeared that he was often on the road, which explained the frequent use of motels, he enjoyed nature, he texted quite a bit and used far more emoticons than was necessary, he seemed to have a nickname, and had a small but active social circle.
The sheets weren’t his and so Dean had no qualms about dropping down onto the mattress. He ached all over. And he was pretty sure that he’d come damn close to breaking his ankle, it smarted something awful and Dean was thankful to be off of his feet. He knew that bruises were beginning to bloom under all the blood cake over his skin.
Previously, he never would have thought that thinking could be so tumultuous, and it was no wonder Dean had often looked pained by his thoughts. Castiel had learnt to deal with the frustration of looking inward to find not just unsatisfactory answers but no answers but it was still a difficult task.
“Could you maybe say it in a way that I would understand?” Castiel asked, aching to understand because there was so much about their relationship that he knew he was missing, and he could feel the blind spots like holes in his head.
“You’re not gonna drop it are you?” Dean returned, he parked himself on the edge of the bed and smothered the urge to snatch the bottles from Cas’ hands, he watched Cas swallow down the pills along with a mouthful of water. A dribble of water escaped the bottle as Cas’ hand shook and slid down the side of his face. Dean’s fingers twitched as Cas wiped it away with the back of his hand.
“I think you know we’re telling the truth,” Dean said, speaking for the first time in minutes, brow arched as he looked over at Castiel. He was acting like he knew everything about him, and though he quite literally knew Castiel better than he did at that moment, he did not appreciate Dean’s sardonic tone.
“I think we’re gonna be taking it slow for a while kid, so guess you’ve got some time to figure out how you want to help,” Dean said. Suddenly, he froze and his face fell before he tipped his head forward and groaned.
Cas said nothing, simply stared at his reflection and wiped his face clean, his right hand was twitchy. They’d only been back one day and Dean could already see the frustration mounting inside the ex-angel. Dean hadn’t forgotten that Cas used to be a ‘
“Thank you Sam,” Castiel said. He approached the younger Winchester, touched his forehead, and healed his wounds.
“I thought that was obvious,” Castiel returned, he dropped his arms down against his body, his coat flapped noisily, and he was sure he had picked up the urge to put his hands in his pockets from Dean’s avoidant tendencies.
“They had to cut me out of the clothes I was wearing, and besides, they would have been covered in dirt and blood anyway,” he explained, staring back defiantly as those dirty bottle green eyes pinned him to the bed.
“I am only a prayer away,” Cas said, and if he hadn’t been smiling when he said it you wouldn’t have known that he was trying to tell a joke.
“Of course we’re gonna get her Sammy,” Dean said, returning Sam’s smile. “C’mon kid, we’re going to Arkansas,” he added, herding Jack into the backseat of the car.
“Yes, Dean’s going to make burgers,” Jack said excitedly, almost bouncing on the balls of his feet, “Dean makes great burgers,” he said directly to Claire.
The moment Cas had dropped onto the mattress he was out, like a light. Dean had meant to make sure Cas took some painkillers before he went to bed, just to make sure he could sleep through the night. He figured that Cas could just wake him up. It wasn’t as though he was gonna get much sleep night anyway, with all the thoughts swirling in his mind.
“What brings you ‘round these parts anyway? Because I sure as shit didn’t pray,” he asked, brow arched as he shuffled around to get a better angle of Cas’ face.
. Dean was more familiar with Cas’ straight forward, blunt and literal nature. This twitchy behaviour was not entirely new but it was kind of surprising. Cas walked toward him, directly into Dean’s personal space, which was something that Dean was far more familiar with. He stared up into the angel’s eyes questioningly.
“Tell me a memory,” Castiel said, hoping to chase away the deep dark nothingness that crept around the edges of his thoughts, and threatened to pounce from the corner of his mind if he let it.
“You must be Dean,” he said. His voice was low and scratchy, like gravel grinding in his throat. The man above him seemed shocked, but relief quickly followed, washing over his face.
Dean got it, he did. Sam was just looking out for him, and he was just worried, same old Sam through and through. And it’d be damn mean of Dean to just let him worry. That and Dean had made a promise to himself, a promise not to leave everything in the dark to be dealt with at some later date but hopefully never, he had to stick to his promises and especially the ones he made to himself.
There were still so many other questions floating around in his mind, and that amount had quadrupled since he’d gotten in the car. He wondered how many of them he would get answers to. But he wasn’t in the mood to ask any more questions. It didn’t seem like Dean was in the mood to answer any more either.
“Good morning Mister Novak, nice to see you’re finally awake, I’ll just check your chart and vitals and then I’ll get Dr. Richards to come and give you a once over, and he’ll explain everything to you, okay?” the woman asked, she was definitely a nurse, if her colourfully patterned scrubs and chipper attitude were anything to go by.
Castiel wondered what that meant, how their actions were obvious. So far, in the few days they had spent together and the memories he’d reclaimed, Dean was the person he gravitated toward. The majority of his Earthly memories featured Dean. And in those memories they were close if not intimate in some kind of way. Perhaps from an outside perspective it was easier to tell the difference between close friendship and something more intimate, at least between himself and Dean.
“Sam’s talking about his injuries,” Jack signed to Eileen, and apparently Cas was more than adept at ASL, maybe he’d learnt it in the military?
Then he was gone, and there’s was nothing in the rear view mirror but the road behind them, Dean shook his head and refocused on the road ahead.
“You aren’t ready, not at all, and I’m damn sure not ready to tell, not even the half of it,” Dean said, chest heaving, he couldn’t meet Castiel’s eyes and instead looked down at himself. “It’s late Cas, let’s just get some sleep okay?”
Chuck was nothing more than a guy with a shitty beard and sub-par writing skills. The strings had been cut and they were free, they were finally free to do whatever they wanted and to be whoever they wanted to be. And what Dean wanted most was to let go of the rage that Chuck had pressed upon him and make up for all the damage he’d done with it.
“You know, it’s not just you, I’m here, our family is here,” Cas said mildly, shifting against the bed sheets, “I don’t think there is a right way to do this, and the apparently supernatural nature of myself and whatever lies in our past obviously complicates things, and I don’t doubt that there’s going to be times when things are difficult, where we both mess up, but that’s just something we’re going to have to deal with,” he continued, in that gentle considered way, almost smiling.
“Friends don’t just up and leave mid-conversation. Friends say goodbye, they tell you why they’re leaving, and they make plans to come back,” Dean said, so many supposed friends had done exactly what Cas did and he was still sore about it, but then again Dean had done the same too. And anyway, Cas always came back. Dean was beginning to feel like an idiot for even bringing it up.
Castiel nodded, it was a comfort to know that Sam was concerned for his feelings. It would be untrue to say that Castiel had not felt emotions before he had ventured into hell to pull Dean out, but his emotions had been clear cut and easily understood, back then everything had seemed so easy and it still staggered him how much of it had been a lie.
“And you’re looking more and more like him as the years go by,” Dean said, smirking over his shoulder as he chopped potatoes, Jack at his side was handling the vegetables.
“Hey bud, gotcha some clothes,” Dean announced, loud and boisterous, as he crossed the room. He set the bag down gently in Cas’ lap. It felt like he was having an out of body experience, like someone else was calling the shots and he was just along for the ride. He swore he could taste his heart and it beat ferociously in his throat.
Sam glared at him, but Dean pretended not to see. It’d been a long trip, not to mention all the crap they’d been through just to earn their freedom, the kid deserved a candy bar as far as Dean was concerned.
“He said that we’ve never had the time to address it and he didn’t want to say too much about it because then he would feel as though he were putting words in my mouth or telling me how I felt,” Castiel explained, fingers now curled around the edge of the table.
Castiel didn’t want to repeat himself, especially since they all knew he was lying, but angels weren’t supposed to have favourites. Then again, Castiel had done a whole lot of things that angels supposedly weren’t supposed to do.
“I will make an effort to be around more often,” Cas said, sliding his fingers between Dean’s, “now that things are in something of an order, I will have more free time.”
This was usually where Dean explained what he meant, why he was asking, and he knew that he owed Cas that much but the words just wouldn’t come. It had taken so long just to let that first one out.
In the blink of an eye, the sun was gone from the sky. They stared up as the stars began to shine through, twinkling bright and strong, the way you’d never see anywhere near a city. Dean looked down at the hood of the car. Stars shone in its reflection, but his eyes were drawn to Cas’ hand between them and before he could lose his nerve, Dean dropped his hand over Cas’. The angel moved only to stare at their joined hands.
There was a whole host of things he wanted to take back and an entire Mariana trench of things he should have said to a lot of people that weren’t there to hear it. He wondered, if he prayed to Cas, would he hear it? Dean smacked his fist against the steering wheel. There was never time. It had barely been more than a week since Cas had gone, since Cas had sacrificed everything for them again. And the weight of Cas’ last words sat heavy in chest like cinder blocks weighing him down.
“So we’re looking for a needle in a haystack with Bette Midler hanging around waiting to Thackery Binx our asses?” Dean said, frustration rising as he stared back at Sam.
It had been over a week since he had woken up in the hospital. Most of that time had been spent crossing the distance between Washington and Kansas, despite the discomfort of his injuries, Castiel had enjoyed the journey. Now that they were all settled into the bunker, he felt an incredible distance between himself and everyone else.
“An angel needed the help of humans?” Cas asked, barely smiling, the only thing that gave him away was the twitching corners of his mouth.
“How’s everything going up in the big H? You guys having diplomatic tea parties yet?” Dean asked. He couldn’t imagine what was going on in heaven, but if he knew anything about angels then he was sure that Cas had a whole damn lot on his plate. As far as he knew there was only one angel that wasn’t a complete asshole and they were sitting opposite him.
“Not to be mean or anything Cas, but you do definitely have favourites, and I’ve made my peace with the fact that my brother, who didn’t believe in God, let alone angels, is your favourite,” Sam said, turned around in his seat to talk directly to Castiel. His smile was soft and Castiel supposed it was meant to be reassuring.
“Really? That’s the best you’ve got? Tall Man?” Sam smirked, mouth open as breathy laughter spilled from his lips, chest stuttering as he looked back at Dean with mirth.
“Washington,” she replied. They were about a whole twenty six to thirty hours from Washington depending on which part she was calling from. “We have a patient here by the name of James Novak, your number was in his phone.”
“Hey, let’s not get all Eeyore suddenly,” Dean shot back, pointedly staring back at Sam as he tilted his head slightly toward Eileen. “It’s a good day, don’t wanna ruin it.”
“Well, you’ve suddenly gotten all touchy feely, telling Jack that he’s part of the family when last week you were chewing me out for thinking the same? And, look, I think it’s great that you’re saying what you actually mean for once but I just wanna make sure you’re okay,” Sam said, he tucked his hair behind his ear and looked expectantly at Dean.
“Okay, awesome,” Dean said, unable to stop himself from smiling, and he slid closer to Cas until their shoulders were touching.
His and Claire’s messages appeared most like correspondence, simple exchanges of how they were doing and what was going on in their lives, along with pictures of a stuffed toy cat in various places. They both seemed to be on the road quite often. And he shared similar messages with someone called Eileen, though they never called, and she seemed to be interested in Sam in some way. While he and Jody mostly discussed Claire’s wellbeing.
“Hey, don’t be ashamed of it,” Dean said, digging into the growing silence, his eyes slid over to Sam, “at least we know you’ve got good taste.”
He grappled for the shotgun, fingers slipping in the wet grass, and bolted for the house. The usual sounds of an altercation sounded out through the night and Dean tried to pick up the pace. He slammed through the door and squinted into the darkness. Sam’s flashlight rapidly swished across the small cabin, providing next to no useful light, Dean’s was lost somewhere outside.
“I suppose you mean heaven?” Cas asked and Dean nodded. “It is proving difficult to get a race of creatures who know only servitude and obedience to come to a decision about anything,” he muttered gruffly. “Free will is certainly a burden.”
“Actually, Cas, she kinda reminded me of you,” Sam said, smiling as he started signing for Eileen, catching her up in the conversation.
“Okay,” Cas drew out. Clearly, he didn’t believe Dean, but he wasn’t going to push it. It was almost alarming that Cas still knew how to read him, even if he didn’t quite know it. Dean supposed that Cas was simply going off of intuition. All his memories were in there, all locked up in Cas’ mind, and Dean figured he might have some kind of subconscious access to them. At least that was what made sense to him. “So how did it work, with me being an angel? I just came down from heaven to help you hunt monsters?” Cas asked, steering the conversation back to its original topic.
In the two days between South Bend and Evanston, the bruises that painted Cas’ skin were beginning to lighten and the scratches and grazes were starting to heal. Sam had redressed Cas’ head in the bathroom of their last motel, and checked out Cas’ collarbone. He was still a little clumsy, but it was kinda cute when he got frustrated by it, not that Dean would ever say it. Everything seemed to be going well. Though, Dean didn’t doubt that Cas would have been healing better it they were home and not rattling down the highway for hours on end.
“Can I put this on?” Jack asked and held up a tape for Dean to see. He didn’t really have to ask, since the cassette came from Dean’s personal collection, but Jack was polite and earnest to a fault. The tape was Blue Oyster Cult’s ‘
“No, I get it, I just,” Sam scratched at the back of his neck, dislodging some of that unruly hair, and stared down at his boots for a moment before finally meeting Dean’s eyes again, “you never really told me what happened, with Cas, and I know, with the two of you, it’s different than it is with me and him, a lot different, profound bond and all, you know, and he’s back again but this might be the last time. So, I just wanna make sure that you’re okay, I’m here Dean and you don’t gotta do this alone,” Sam said, stumbling through his thoughts, and pushed his hair back away from his face.
Maybe he’d get his Cas back, or maybe Cas would change his mind once he’d got all of his memories back, or maybe he would be different even with them. Dean would still try though. It just wasn’t in him to quit on Cas, he’d tried it once and it hadn’t taken, and with this possibly being their last chance there was no stopping him. With his teeth gritted and hands white knuckle tight around the steering wheel, he drove with apprehensive determination. He owed Cas so damn much, the least he could do was try.
“And it isn’t?” Dean asked. As far as he knew, Cas spent a lot of time up in heaven trying to clean up god’s mess, the least those assholes could do was be grateful.
With Sam and Eileen out on a job or a date, Dean didn’t know which and figured that by now the lines were kinda blurred in that department, Jack was deeply engrossed in the Hunger Games books Sam had got him and Claire’s visit was two days away, Dean thought that it was about time that they got one of the bigger issues out of the way.
“I dunno, I guess it’s not, but we’ve always been able to be real with each other in a way that other people don’t quite get,” Dean said, because that was at least true too.
“What do you want me to say?” Dean asked. The background noise fell away and Castiel supposed that he’d made it out of the bar. Out into the night, the streets seemed quiet.
“It’s not much, but they said that’s to be expected, since I’ve only been here,” Cas said, “it’s done almost nothing to jog my memory.”
“I thought you understood that I have obligations, you know where I am when I’m not with you,” Cas said, speaking slowly, frowning at Dean.
They smiled at each other. There was barely a few inches between them, and Dean could have reached out and held on tight, if he wanted to. He wanted hold on and never let go.
“I was just thinking about you, wondering how you’re doing with those bastards upstairs,” he said, and it wasn’t exactly a lie.
“Easy there, Mr. Prickly, no need to bite Sam’s head off,” Dean muttered, and scoffed, “pills are in the car, you think you can wait a little while?” he asked.
Dean looked down at his feet and the shattered floorboards. He sighed heavily, of course, the crawl space. When he raised his eyes, Sam was staring back at him, obviously he’d come to the same conclusion.
,” Jack piped up from the backseat. Castiel had almost forgotten that there were other passengers in the car, and from the briefly startled look that crossed his face, Dean had too.
“No,” Sam said, with a shake of his head that dislodged a lock of brown hair, “we don’t know how old you really are, but it’s safe to say that you’re a lot older than forty-four, like a couple millennia older.”
“Well, it’s nice to know that losing all your memories doesn’t stop you from being a salty sailor,” Dean bit back. “I know because you’re not freaking out, you’re not telling us that we’re crazy or that we’re full of shit, that angels aren’t real,” he went on, “anyone else would be pissed that we’re messing with them when they’ve got amnesia.”
“Oh and look at all the good that’s done,” Dean ground out, and Castiel wondered if they were still only talking about him.
“Mister Novak?” He croaked, his throat was dry and the words came out like splinters, he tried to swallow but that only made it worse.
He cleared his throat and closed the door behind him. Sam lifted his head and shot Dean a look, Dean struggled not to roll his eyes, and instead gave Sam a short nod.
“I just want to, I just want us to be real friends, and Cas, I don’t know if you noticed but I don’t have any friends, they either leave or they die,” Dean said, jaw tightening, holding back the memories of all the people he’d lost. The average person his age had maybe only lost a grandparent or two and he tried not to be resentful of that.
“It makes people temporarily insane?” Castiel supposed that it made some semblance of sense, the notion that love blinded people and caused them to do things they would not have otherwise done appeared in a fair amount of popular culture.
“Despite the awkwardness of looking like her father and once possessing him, I am excited to see her,” Cas said, mouth once again twitching toward a smile, and Dean guessed that Cas had been looking at the pictures and messages he’d shared with Claire.
“Your name’s Castiel and you’re an angel of the lord,” Dean said, an odd kind of brittle humour in his voice, “or well, you were,” he added, eyes flicking to meet Cas’ for a second.
The diner felt familiar, though Castiel supposed that it simply went with being on the road as much as they seemed to be, and he didn’t doubt that diners all across America were likely quite similar to each other. They were somewhere in Oregon. Castiel hadn’t been paying enough attention to know where exactly, but he supposed that it didn’t matter anyway, it was only one stop of many on their way home.
He, James, was already counting the minutes. He’d only spent a day in the hospital, but he was ready to leave.
do. They probably didn’t have too long until the hospital realised the insurance was fake, so they had to get Cas out of there as soon as possible. Most stores would be closed by now, but it wouldn’t hurt to cruise around and see what was open, they couldn’t sneak Cas out of there in his hospital clothes.
“I will do my best not to die within your lifetime,” Cas said, and Dean didn’t miss the humour in his voice, “and I...I would like to be a permanent part of your life.”
Cas was different and Dean hoped beyond hope that it had nothing to do with Chuck. When they’d been trying to stop Jack from sacrificing his life for them and the world at large, and wasn’t that just so hypocritical of them, Chuck had said that this Cas,
“I’d like to meet Claire,” Jack announced, and took a long drag off the straw in his milkshake, the sound might have been grating to anyone else, but Castiel found Jack’s behaviour endearing.
The drive back to the bunker was hot and dry. Castiel liked the sound of the asphalt flying under the wheels of the Impala, and it was loud and wild, with a hint of danger. It reminded Castiel of Dean.
“I’ll bet,” Dean muttered under his breath. The thought of it still stung, the betrayal and helplessness that sat deep in those memories, he swallowed it back down. “And Jack, I’ve done so much, I’ve hurt so many people. And there’s no one I’ve hurt more than the people I care about,” Dean said, blinking away the sudden sting in his eyes, he wiped his face on his sleeve. “I’ve hurt you, I’ve treated you so bad kid, and I know you’ve forgiven me every time, so how’s that any different?”
There wasn’t a lot to do besides stare out the window or watch whatever it was that passed for television. Since his roommate had been discharged the day he’d woken up, he didn’t have anyone to talk to, well until one of the nurses came in to check on him but that time was short and fleeting. He found himself preferring the changing sky. He watched the clouds with a strong sense of longing that he couldn’t place. Perhaps he’d been some sort of pilot.
“’Cause I’m your favourite,” Dean said, he looked over his shoulder for a moment to flick a smile at Castiel, Sam snorted from the passenger seat.
“At first he insisted, and I think eventually you just resigned yourself to it,” Sam clarified fondly.
“Cas, there’s no angel up there better than you,” Dean said, the words were so easy, and they came out like air.
“Uncomfortable,” he replied flatly, “besides the injuries, and the lack of memory, these hospital clothes leave much to be desired,” he grimaced as he shifted in the bed. He would have attempted to sign, but he’d been told that he should move his right arm as little as possible, instead he made sure his mouth was in clear view from where Eileen was standing. Though, in a moment he noticed Sam signing for her.
With a deep breath, Dean steeled himself for the journey ahead of them. Getting back to the bunker was just the beginning. There were bound to be all kinds of challenges ahead of them, it wasn’t the first time he’d had to roll with the punches.
“Our lives are frustratingly complicated,” Eileen signed, smiling still as she shrugged in a way that said ‘
That, well it couldn’t be a failure if Castiel hadn’t entered the room with a true purpose, but it certainly wasn’t a success.
“Met plenty of angels, just never met anything, and I mean anything, like you,” Dean replied. He spied the bottle of water on the nightstand where he’d left it, in case Castiel needed it in the night, and took a swig of it himself.
Castiel gasped into the dead of night, heart kicking up like a wild horse in his chest, fingers twisted in the coarse motel sheets. Form and shapes came to him slowly as his eyes adjusted to the darkness. He turned his head in search of Dean asleep in the bed beside his, but the other bed was empty and for some reason that had Castiel’s heart stuttering to pound hard enough that he felt his whole body throbbing.
It wasn’t long before the road was stretched out long toward the horizon ahead of them. That asphalt bent around curves and twisted between trees. Dean tried to collect his thoughts, fingers drumming against the steering wheel, foot easy on the pedals as his mind whirred.
“Alright,” Dean bit out, but there was no anger behind it, and when their eyes met again he was smiling. “So, I guess you do have a favourite after all, eh Cas?”
“Yeah, that makes sense,” Dean muttered, scratching at his face, “we’ll get you some clothes and get you out of here,” he added, and shared a quick look with Sam from across the bed.
“Love appears to be an integral part of humanity,” Castiel explained lamely, “I simply want to understand.”
“I require your help with something, and I don’t think Dean would be of much assistance in this area,” Castiel explained, watching as Sam picked his phone out of his salad.
The floorboards shattered above him, splinters flew into the air, in an explosion of wood. Wood chips and dust floated around Dean’s head. He coughed hard into his fist. Quickly, because the witch would be back any moment now, Dean grabbed up the hex-bag and torched it with the flicker of his lighter. The scream that followed almost rivalled the call of angels and Dean could only hold his hands to his head against it.
When he caught up with himself, Dean was stood by Baby’s side with the streetlights bouncing off of her shiny finish. His breathing was shallow and loud as he stared across the parking lot. Cas didn’t remember him. Cas didn’t remember anything, he didn’t know anything about the things they’d been through, and Dean was beginning to wonder how a couple millennia of angelic memories were going to fit into a human mind.
“They believe my connection to you clouds my judgement,” Cas stated, fabric caught in his closed fist.
“I’m kind of glad that I don’t have powers anymore,” Jack said, speaking around a bite of omelette he’d ordered at Sam’s insistence, while Sam continued to sign for Eileen. “It’s good to be useful, but I can still help without powers, and they seem to cause just as much damage as good,” he continued, head tilted contemplatively as he spoke.
This wasn’t the time to do this. There was probably a better time to do this. Though, maybe never was a good time too. Castiel was losing his nerve and fast, he sighed and slumped a little in his chair.
“Well I figured that you should probably know a few things before she gets here,” Dean said, he shoved a rag into his back pocket as he went about checking the oil.
“Everyone?” Dean yelled, snapping his head toward Sam, brows half a mile up his forehead as the colour drained from his face.
, not my fault that you’re uncultured,” Dean said, and took some jerky from the packet he was sharing with Cas, smirking back as he chewed.
“Wanna help me do a once over on Baby?” Dean asked, voice catching awkwardly in his throat, he coughed into his fist to cover it.
“Dean,” Sam said. His voice was softer now. And though he was still smiling, it was a different kind of smile, something warm and almost sad.
“I do not have favourites,” Castiel muttered, it was an obvious lie, but something about the conversation was beginning to make him uncomfortable.
With the aid of his phone and the hospital’s shoddy wifi, he figured out that the music belonged to a band called Led Zeppelin.
“It wasn’t as direct as your other prayers,” Cas said, Dean watched him frown through the rear view mirror, “it was something more like a desire for reassurance,” he went on.
He woke from an odd dream, a dream that hadn’t felt like a dream, but it couldn’t have been real. Light burst around him and glinted off of the metal of several thousand blades. The blades were held by beings whose forms were unintelligible and far beyond any possible description, as far as he could tell, they were vast bursts of colour and sprawling extremities. He was one of them. He was one of the many engaged in battle against hordes of vile twisted creatures. It was certainly an elaborate dream.
’, those words had been burned into his brain, that whole exchange was and Dean knew that Cas hated not being able to do things for himself. Every time the guy had fallen, he’d gotten downright depressed and Dean still shuddered at the memory of the possible future Zachariah had sent him to.
They broke apart again. Dean flipped the couch and tore at what was left of it with his knife, tearing the stuffing out, it was quickly apparent that there was nothing out of the ordinary in the couch. The coffee table was clear, as was the side table with the rotary phone on it. The rotary phone was clear too.
“I’m very happy to have you back,” Jack murmured, “I missed you, very much,” the emotion in his voice was too much to handle, leaking over everything like an overfilled cup.
“Of course you don’t fucking understand,” Dean gritted out, restraining himself from smacking the wheel, instead he tightened his grip. “Don’t you want to be here, with me, sometimes?” He added, voice growing small as he lost steam.
He supposed it had started as a way to protect himself. Dean had never been able to handle it when a guy came onto him, and it had never been because he wasn’t interested, it was because he was interested. When he was a kid it terrified him. He had heard the way his dad and his hunting buddies spoke about those sorts of people, and he didn’t want to be one of them and find out what his dad had to say about that. And maybe all that hiding and evasion had turned into bad cracked armour that stopped him from being able to act on his feelings. Of course he’d never admit as much.
“The nature of our lives?” Dean asked, one brow cocked, he rested his elbows on his thighs and leaned forward a little. He hoped that Cas could tell that he was just trying to listen instead of being condescending.
“How’re you doing?” Dean asked, tail bone pressed against the edge of the counter, he eyed Cas. “How’s the pain, you sleeping alright?”
“Yeah, and I guess, I dunno, I don’t necessarily think you’re a father figure to her but you’re definitely more than some guy. You, you really tried to make it up to her, to help her get stable and we helped her find a place to stay, where she belonged, and now she’s got family, with us and with Jody and the girls, and I don’t know if she looks up to you but she respects you and how hard you try despite how much of a dork you can be,” Dean said, trying to convey something, but he was pretty sure he’d messed it up somewhere. Claire would be better able to show Cas what he meant to her than Dean ever could with his extremely lacking conversational skills.
“No, I think it’ll be best if you speak to her instead,” Castiel said, voice rough, his body was protesting against staying upright. Dean nodded.
Sometimes it was almost like they were speaking different languages with too much overlap. It was moments like this that reminded Dean of how different they truly were. Dean was a child of the road, raised in the passenger seat of the Impala, in motel rooms, on whatever television he caught and the music his dad put on the radio. Castiel was an angel, older than the Earth itself, with thousands of siblings and god himself as his father. Then again, they were both raised to be soldiers and protectors, nothing more and nothing less.
“Don’t you usually do this to my brother?” Sam asked, hand held against his chest, his eyes darted around the diner.
When he entered the room, Sam and Eileen were sat in two longue style chairs against the far wall beneath the window, they were signing to each other with relaxed ease. Jack was animatedly explaining something as he stood leaning over Cas’ bed. After a moment, Dean realised that Jack was giving a heavily edited account of their trip to Dodge City to a weakly smiling Cas. Dean couldn’t afford to think about Dodge City.
“No, what I’m saying is that free will’s hard, you have to make all your own choices and deal with the consequences, and it means that you have to deal with other people’s choices too. Democracy is hard, but it’s worth doing,” Dean explained and finished off his burger, he wiped his hands on his denim clad thighs, and he wasn’t about to admit to Cas that he’d never voted. He probably knew already.
“Oh, so it’s an excuse not to listen to you, great,” Dean bit back, and smacked Cas on the back, squarely between the shoulder blades. “Cas, you gotta stand up for yourself, take it on the chin, whatever, just, get on with it and sort heaven out because personally, I don’t wanna deal with any angel that isn’t you.”
To Castiel, home felt like flannel shirts and denim jeans. Home felt like the backseat of the Impala and green eyes in the rear view mirror. Home felt like a hand on his shoulder and a promise or a plea to make things right again. Home smelt like gun smoke, mud, stale bed sheets, motor oil, the sharp tang of blood and sweat, beer, sweet cherry pie and greasy hamburgers. Home smelt like Dean.
Dean had almost forgotten that Cas was with them. He felt suddenly self-conscious, though Cas had long since stopped judging his every move, and watched the angel’s form turn toward them.
“Dean said that everyone knew that there was or is something between us,” Castiel said, nails picking at the edge of the table.
They were more than that and at the same time they weren’t. And though it was true, it didn’t stop the memory of what Cas had intended to be his last words from flooding in, and Dean had to swallow against a suddenly thick throat.
“It’s the medical drama show that Dean loves,” Sam signed, face split open in a smile, “the doctor wears cowboy boots, and apparently that’s what makes him sexy, at least according to Dean.”
The wood grain of the long table brought many complicated feelings to the forefront of Castiel’s mind. His name was scratched into the wood at one end, surrounded by a few other carvings, Jack’s name sat beside his own, while the others were simply initials. D.W. and S.W. were obviously Dean and Sam, but he didn’t know who M.W. was. Though, Castiel figured that he’d remember soon enough.
There had been too many times where he’d come right up to it, fully intending to say what he meant, what Cas meant to him and what he really felt. But every single time he had stumbled at the finish line. He cringed to himself at every remembered insistence that Cas was his brother, nothing more than his best friend, his family, despite every single thing he had done that pointed to the contrary. Dean gritted his teeth against it.
Dean had barely pulled up to the curb when Sam barrelled out of the car like an overexcited Saint Bernard and wrapped his arms around Eileen. He lifted her clean off the sidewalk. And by the time Dean and Jack made their way over to the bus stop, Sam had set her back down, and they were staring at each other like a couple of lovesick teenagers. The sight of it filled Dean with such warmth that he might never feel the cold again. Yeah, it was fucking fantastic to see his brother happy again.
“No, I’m sure they’re doing fine without me,” Castiel muttered, smothering the conflicting urges to both move out from under Dean’s hold or step forward into the embrace. It was another lie. He doubted he was welcome in heaven, considering everything that had happened, and though he was concerned, he knew they could handle things without him. “I’ll stay,” he added, smiling softly back at Dean.
“We’re going to have to explain all this to Claire,” Dean muttered, cutlery clacking against the ceramic of his plate, he wiped his face with his hand. Castiel recognised the name instantly and remembered the messages on his phone.
“I know you love me,” Castiel said, lips pulled back in a sneer, this wasn’t how this was supposed to go. Of course he knew. All the things they’d done for each other, they were things they’d never do for anyone else. And all the moments they’d shared, they were moments that they’d have never shared with anyone else. It was impossible to ignore all the ways in which Dean had fought for him. And it wasn’t lost on Castiel how similar this moment was to another time they had come close to confessions, only this time he wasn’t the reason for Dean’s injuries, and this time he could get the words out.
family Jack,” he stammered, eyes sliding over to Jack for just a second, “and it’s not because of all the things you’ve done for us, for everyone, it’s because we care about you,” his grip on the wheel tightened, he was suddenly reminded of a different but oddly similar declaration he’d made, he had to force the rest of the words out. “
“How’re you feeling?” Dean asked, his voice was rough, and his knuckles had turned white from the way he was gripping the bed railing.
“Which is fine because like 99.9% of the population has gotten by without the help of angel powers,” Dean said, smoothing out the gauze with the heel of his palm, there was no way in hell that he was going to let Cas feel inadequate for not being able to heal his every boo-boo or something.
He nodded, despite himself, and reeled off some info both real and fake before eventually hanging up. The blank phone screen stared back at him. Dean continued to stand there, frozen to the spot. It was Cas.
Sam’s gaze returned to Eileen and his face broke into a smile again. And then they were back to staring at each other like there was no possible way for them to get enough, it didn’t even seem like they were aware of how they were leaning toward each other, but they were the only ones that seemed surprised when they finally kissed. Dean shook his head and looked over at Jack. The boy simply smiled back at him, pride written all over his face, and Dean couldn’t stop it from swelling inside him too.
Even if he did deserve to finally get what he wanted, which he definitely didn’t, it would just be his luck to have someone that couldn’t and wouldn’t stick around. Dean bit back the curse that jumped up his throat. Hands fisted in the sheets beneath him, knuckles turned white. He should have expected it, it was what Cas always did, and Dean was a dumbass for thinking any different. They –
“Back from the dead, twice, you’re almost one of us,” Dean said, voice as clear as he could make it through his smile, hoping she could read his lips. He held his arms wide open.
“I know that, but it’s not about just getting somewhere,” Dean said, sighing, he slid a hand into his pocket and curled it into a fist, “it’s about the going, freedom, driving is like the perfect expression of my god-given free will, and anyway, it’s easier to talk when I have something else to focus on,” he went on lamely, trying to explain something he’d never had to explain before.
“We should probably introduce ourselves,” the tall man said, and cleared his throat, “I’m Sam, Dean’s younger brother,” he said, and tapped the joint of his thumb against his breastbone. “You already know that’s Dean, and next to him is Jack, I guess the easiest way to explain it is that we’re all kind of his guardians,” he went on, “and this is Eileen, she’s a friend, she’s deaf,” he added, turning half toward her as he began to sign.
“Okay, okay,” Dean muttered as he ran a hand through his hair, trying to think, “we’ll be there in a few days, we’re coming all the way from Arkansas ya see,” his vision was swimming, he sniffed and wiped his eyes with the back of his hand.
“What are you, a drill sergeant all of a sudden?” Sam asked, signing as he faced Eileen, when he turned back to smirk at Dean he missed how Eileen was smirking too.
Dean tried not to scoff, his cynicism was deep set into his bones, pressed in by decades of rough living and the knowledge that there were cruel and pointless terrors out there that God never gave a damn about. And Jack knew that too. Jack had seen a snapshot of all the awful things that this world, and others, could offer. And still Jack clung to his innocence, not in the sense that he’d never done anything wrong, just in the sense that his heart was pure and he still believed in the goodness of things. Dean hoped that he never lost it.
Dean drove through town with the window rolled down, and let the sea breeze roll on through. He hoped that it would help to clear his head. It was hard to forget the last time he’d been there, or at least in the general area. Just over three years ago, Cas had died, Crowley had died, Kelly died, their mother was stuck in an alternate universe, and he and Sam were shouldered with the responsibility of raising and watching over the son of Lucifer. And despite the fact that they had literally been the only people in the whole world for a time, it came pretty close to the same sense of isolation and indirection as he’d felt that day.
“Dean, I don’t know if you’ve noticed, but every time we meet an angel they always whine about how Cas chose you over heaven and how ‘the very touch of you corrupts’, and demons are always jabbing at the both of you about it, like constantly,” Sam explained, there was humour in his voice, and he was smiling as he spoke. “Everyone knows.”
“Well a reaper is what collects the souls and takes them to the afterlife, where Death is kinda in charge of all the reapers and death in general,” Sam explained, and Dean was almost surprised that he hadn’t started off with ‘
, with the woodland creatures?” Castiel asked, brows furrowed as he stared down at the wreckage of Dean’s pie.
“Yeah, kinda, I mean I’ve been on and off the phone with Bobby all day, we’ve run across town, burned some bones, I even went out to the burnt out husk of her house and I couldn’t find anything except this writing that I didn’t understand,” Sam said, he heaved a sigh. “I took some photos on my phone, but Bobby couldn’t figure out what it was, and I hoped that you might have an idea,” he added, fishing his phone out of his pocket.
“Well, for the most part yeah,” Dean nodded, “we stop them from hurting people, and that takes us all over the great wide United States, that’s the bare bones of it,” he said with a shrug, hands open with his palms pointed at Cas. “Though, I’ve got a feeling we’re gonna have a lot more free time now,” he added, smiling at the thought.
Cas shrugged. Castiel, Angel of the Lord, solider, shrugged. Dean would have laughed if Cas didn’t look so dejected.
With Cas sat in the backseat, they drove out to what was left of the Mary Clark’s home. Pulled up on the side of the road, Dean went straight for the trunk while Cas and Sam discussed the creepy writing, he was more preoccupied with not letting the damn ghost get the drop on him again than talking about crap he’d never understand anyway.
“Yeah, it’s what he deserves,” Dean spat. It was the least of it. To be just like the rest of them, powerless and insignificant, left to fight for his existence with the rest of the human race, the thought was vindictively satisfying.
“Yeah, I mean, not everything’s great, we don’t have millions of dollars and we’re not retiring to a tropical beach somewhere or anything like that, but we’re all together and we’re on our way home, and I’m pretty okay with that,” Dean said, smiling softly.
Even with the knowledge of every word ever written, every song ever sung, every piece of art ever made by humanity about love, Castiel did not feel able to determine whether what he himself was feeling was love. He hadn’t met many humans who were in love or had been very successful at it.
And Castiel had figured out very little, but it was just the start. He knew that they were more than friends, more than best friends, they were something that dipped into the intimate. It was becoming apparent that they had both acted with trepidation toward each other. And even if Castiel had known, for certain, how he felt about Dean, he couldn’t have known for certain how Dean felt without the man telling him. Despite how obvious Dean’s actions and words were now, that didn’t mean he’d acted that way in the past.
And he finally put his hands on the boy. He hauled Jack toward him and held on tight. Dean enveloped Jack in his arms, and Jack gripped him too. Jack’s hands were caught in the back of Dean’s jacket, face buried in his shoulder, breaths harsh rapid across his collar bone. Dean pressed his face against the top of Jack head and closed his eyes. His family was back together and he was going to hold on to them this time.
“Do you have a lot of scars?” Cas asked, stood stock still as he watched Dean rifle through the kit.
Cas dropped down onto the corner of the bed, jostling Dean slightly. It wasn’t often that Cas wasn’t staring at him, as though the eyes really were the windows to the soul, and Dean could see that there was something off from his whole posture.
A blanket of silence fell over them. It wasn’t entirely uncomfortable, but it still felt tense, there was so much left to say. Maybe there always would be. He tried to work the words out of his mouth, but in classic Dean Winchester style they just wouldn’t come. Fingers tapped the steering wheel. He tried not to watch Cas from the corner of his eye, though he knew that Cas was still watching him.
They sat there silently for a moment, hands still clasped between them, watching each other in that way that made Dean’s skin tingle with electricity. He ran his thumb over Cas’ knuckles. If Cas had been anyone else, if this didn’t mean so much, he was pretty sure that they would already be kissing. But it was too big and it meant too much. And he felt just fine sitting there watching Cas watch him, he could have done it for the rest of his life and not feel like he’d wasted a moment.
, but it sure as shit is wanted,” Dean returned, cutting his eyes toward Cas, brow arched as he waited for...something.
As he drew closer, the mound came into focus. The mound looked like it was made of ash and Dean could only guess as to where the ash had come from. He tried to put it out of his mind. Atop the mound was a small fabric bag, it was a pale yellow that reminded Dean of snot, he sneered but reached out for it nonetheless.
“This is definitely an up-grade,” Claire broke in, reaching over the table to tug at the flannel covering Castiel’s elbow. “Though, the hand-me-down look doesn’t quite suit you either, you should get your own clothes,” she added.
He watched the headlights of a car pass over the ceiling of the cab of the flatbed he was lying in. Spread out across the bench seat. Before they averted the apocalypse, Castiel had never truly had to think for himself, he did, but it was something that he kept to himself. Since then, he’d had a lot of think about. Mostly, he had thought about Dean Winchester.
“Hey, don’t sweat it,” Dean said, and shrugged, “it’s not all that different from how we usually are anyway,” he added, a little proud and a little ashamed of it.
She left him there adrift in nothing, the world beyond the hospital bed a terrifying mystery. The heart-rate monitor kept track of his wildly beating heart, the soundtrack to his terror. And the unknown bore down upon him.
At least he could get one thing right, he thought to himself as he made his way back to the car. His phone began to vibrate in the pocket of his jeans and he stopped at Baby’s side to palm it free.
“I’d very much like to sleep,” Castiel said, fighting back a yawn, “but I would also like to shower,” he added, and scratched at his hair, it felt tacky between his fingers.
“But there have been things that I’ve asked you, Sam, that you’ve said I should ask Dean and his answers tend to be...unsatisfactory,” Castiel ground the word out.
“It’s not different at all,” Castiel returned sternly. “Have you considered that perhaps, I’ve never met anyone like you either?”
Castiel watched Jack as he left the room, smile spread wide across his face, eyes wet. And then it was just him and Dean. They looked at each other for a long moment, sky blue on marsh green, and Castiel got the feeling that this was more than an often occurrence.
“Hey buddy, when you’re up in the clouds it’s usually literally,” Dean said, hand curled around Castiel’s shoulder.
“It isn’t so simple as giving out orders, even if that was what I wanted to do, there’s a schism in how they think heaven should be run,” Cas muttered, brows furrowed as he stared hard at Dean.
“Some clean clothes would be nice,” Castiel said. He’d gone through the clothes Dean had brought him back in Washington, and it had been pretty warm in the car as they drove across the country, he didn’t want to clean himself only to step back into dirty clothes.
“You let Dean get away with a lot of things,” Sam said with a knowing smile that Cas did not appreciate, though it was just as he suspected.
“Me too pal, now hand me that wrench,” Dean said, and pointed to the toolbox by Cas’ feet, he could only hope that the other major things they had to talk about would go so well. He doubted it.
“What’s up Dean?” Sam called. He was only a few feet away, but to Dean it sounded like he was at the other end of a long dark tunnel.
“It’s been a long ass week, and I think we all need to get some sleep, and in our own beds or the next best thing, have a shower, and just generally settle back in, five hours is good enough,” Dean explained with a shrug as Sam continued to sign for Eileen.
“That’s a conversation for another time,” Dean said firmly and turned the stereo up, effectively ending the conversation.
The bleak pale glow of the streetlights passed over the windshield and though Castiel already knew he’d been there before, he was shot hurtling back into the past. Sat in the front seat beside Dean some distance in the past, the two of them less wrinkled but stunningly more cynical. They spoke of absent fathers, faith and family. A tale of family like shackles that stood so starkly from the actions of the man he knew in the present.
It was tough to call what would be worse, the silence that was continuing to pervade between them or a never ending barrage of questions, all of which would be difficult to answer. Dean usually preferred noise over silence. That night though, he wanted to sleep, and he welcomed the silence.
“I’ll see what I’ve got,” Dean said, cheeks darkening for some reason Castiel couldn’t discern, “and you need all the rest you can get, so don’t worry about getting up or anything, I’ll come get you when the food’s ready,” Dean said, staring at Castiel as though he were daring him to argue, though Castiel was far too tired for it.
The light was beginning to dwindle as the sun kissed the horizon. It surprised him a little, and they must have been out for longer than he thought. Dean knew the area well enough, and drove up to the crest of a hill, and pulled in to park at what was definitely some kind of make out point, thankfully it was a school night. He climbed out of the car and Cas followed.
They were sat on a picnic bench, the wood was knocked, knotted and covered in crass graffiti, eating snacks and basking in the mid-afternoon sun. Dean was half hoping that either Cas or Jack would ask what some of the graffiti meant just to watch Sam turn red, though it was more likely that he’d go red himself. They didn’t anyway. Instead, Jack was showing Cas something on his phone, while Sam and Eileen were signing to each other, Dean had asked what they were talking about, but it was some true crime book they’d both read. At least his brother finally had someone to share his creepy hobby with. Dean tipped his face to the sun and finished off the can of energy drink that Sam had been telling him would give him his second heart attack.
“I understand that, but our relationship is different, I am an angel after all,” Cas said, almost smiling, as though he’d told a joke.
“If you weren’t driving right now, I would hug you,” Jack said, tears sliding down his cheeks, unabashed.
Before they could so much as step in the direction of an exist, Sam and Dean found themselves outside, stood beside the Impala watching the house burn for a second time.
“Home,” Castiel murmured. He tried to think of home, even closed his eyes, but all that came to mind was the image that confronted him when he opened his eyes. He was already home, whatever that meant.
Now finished with his food and face free from condiments, Jack took over signing again. And if Dean hadn’t been focused on Sam’s veiled accusation, he might have had the room to feel guilty about being the only one who couldn’t sign.
Cas nodded sagely, as though Dean had given him some actually decent advice, and Dean wondered if he had. He hoped he had. Dean Winchester wasn’t exactly known for his stellar advice, especially given the kinds of decisions he usually made.
“Alright,” Dean said, he clapped his hands together as he turned away from the fridge, and checked his watch before he continued, “in five hours’ time, we’ll meet back here for dinner.”
“I understand that he struggles with his feelings and expressing them,” Castiel said, sighing as he began to trace his name with his fingers.
“You can pass me stuff,” Dean said, “and I’ve got something I need to talk to you about and I’m better at talking when I’ve got something else to focus on,” he admitted. He hoped it might be at least a little like all those bone deep conversations he’d had with Sam on midnight roads when he had an excuse not to look at his brother as he pulled back his skin to show what was underneath.
“I don’t know,” Sam replied with growing distress, his hair fell over his face as he whipped his head around.
“And I’m telling you that, though I really appreciate it, I’m not worth it,” Dean said, and there was something about it that felt familiar, it felt like a conversation, more like argument, they’d had before.
Instead of Netflix and since he didn’t appear to have a way to listen to his tape besides sitting in the car, Castiel searched for somewhere to listen to Led Zeppelin and let Spotify lull him to sleep.
“Oh, right,” Sam said and instantly smiled back at Cas. He was probably over the damn moon to finally have Cas remember something about him, and something good too. Things between them had been kind of tense, between Cas’ lack of memories and Sam acting all mother hen, Cas hadn’t been shy about showing his irritation.
“Sam is right,” Cas said, the rough quality of his voice gave the statement unwarranted gravitas. Sam smirked at Dean. “These writings speak of the sanctity of the covenant. I believe they’re a protection spell.”
“More like an angel needed the help of his friends,” Dean returned, he just wished that Cas had done it more often.
They walked down the slim corridors together, with the silence bouncing off of the tiled walls, until Dean broke off into what Castiel knew was his bedroom. He continued on toward the washroom. It wasn’t as familiar as the others and he supposed that as an angel he’d had no reason to acquaint himself with it.
“Why am I expected to arbitrarily take your side in all arguments?” Castiel asked. He tilted his head slightly as he stared at the side of Dean’s face.
“She knows anyway, everyone knows, okay?” Sam said, finally, a little exasperated. He dropped his hands into his lap.
He struggled to turn his gun toward himself and over his shoulder. This way, he was more than likely to clip himself, but he’d rather take the scalding rock salt than die in some dingy crawl space. His lungs were beginning to burn and his eyes had started to water. The ghost witch continued to whisper some sort of chant or incantation in his ear, and Dean wondered if he was getting dizzy or if her curse was starting to take hold. He had to get her off his back and quick.
“Well, before we met, you hadn’t really watched any and since Dean was basically raised on it, he took it as a personal offense and wouldn’t rest until you’d watched enough to rot your brain,” Sam explained, smirking slightly as he spoke, and tucked back a strand of hair that had fallen out of place.
Cas didn’t say anything in reply, he just continued to stare at Dean. It was an echo that stretched across the entire time they’d known each other, so many tense moments of standing on opposite sides of comprehension, differing points view of that neither of them would ever understand, fondness and a yearning so strong that Dean had half convinced himself was only coming from him. But all he had to do was look to know that Cas felt the same and he looked and looked and looked.
“Yeah, that’s probably a good idea,” Dean said with a frown, a bitter twist of his mouth. “Make sure you call Jody and Garth,” he added and Sam nodded.
’?” Cas asked, and if anything, this conversation was only serving to confuse him further. If he thought back to those few scant memories, Cas found himself far more drawn to the man beside him than the television before them. Though, he had obviously put a lot of effort into absorbing whatever was on the screen. He suspected that he’d let Dean talk him into it, and maybe it didn’t matter what they were doing as long as they could enjoy each other’s company.
Where Castiel wanted to be was wherever Dean was. In his moments of idle thought, he found himself wondering where Dean was and what he was doing, and yearned to be there too.
“What if I can’t do it?” Cas said, eyes sliding off of Dean, he stared down at his hands, “what if there’s someone better?”
It wasn’t hard to find his flashlight, sat like a beacon in the grass, he grabbed it up and made for the crawl space. He kicked the grating in. He could have just pulled it aside, but they’d wasted enough time in the burnt rotten house, and Dean wanted to get this over with. Sam stayed in the house with Cas. They were the distraction, bait, as Dean searched for the source of the ghost witch’s power.
“The only things I love are,” Dean began, holding his hand up to curl his fingers as he counted them off, “classic rock, pie, my baby, and my family, mom, Sammy and you.”
“I can go get them,” Jack offered, “I’ve finished my meal,” he added, smiling with accomplishment and eager to be helpful.
“I feel like this is something of a common occurrence,” Cas said, and Dean had to swallow as Cas squinted up at him, head tilted just so. He scrutinized Dean with those cool blue eyes.
“Uh, how long have we been driving?” Sam asked. He wiped his face with the back of his hand and peered out the window at the passing scenery.
“I don’t think so Cas,” Dean said after a moment, and Castiel tilted his head, he didn’t want to presume. “I don’t think I’ve ever been in love, not really,” he clarified. Dean was very still as he continued to stare back at Castiel.
“’Cause you’re short?” Sam returned, brows furrowed, and that familiar curl in the wrinkle in his brow made Dean’s heart clench.
“I’m not content, but things are a hell of a lot better than they were,” Dean said, thumbs tapping against the steering wheel, “it’s more like the ending of
A family, mom, dad and daughter, sat on a bench across from them. The little girl had a guinea pig in her lap, she stroking its back as she fed it celery and it squeaked in apparent happiness.
“What makes you say that?” Dean said, and though his eyes were on the road, it was apparent that his full attention was on Castiel.
“Yeah, well, they’re dickwards, what did you expect?” Dean said, as though it didn’t need saying, to him it was pretty damn obvious.
Dean was yanked from his rose-tinted thoughts by his phone vibrating against his thigh. He pulled it out of his pocket and checked the caller ID, he didn’t recognise the number but he answered anyway, you never knew who could be in trouble.
“Billie tried to kill you,” Cas muttered lowly, his voice sounded like he’d been gargling gravel and glass, it was all torn up and Dean watched his throat work as he swallowed thickly.
He was exhausted. Dean was tired all the way down past the bone and into his soul. This wasn’t just the result of the past few days or their last battle for their lives as well as the whole entire world, this was a tiredness that had built from the moment good old yellow eyes had stepped into Sam’s bedroom, up until the moment Jack had appeared before them after the events at the lake. And when he finally staggered into his bedroom, well Dean didn’t think anyone would blame him for taking a sabbatical. He was planning to be unconscious for at least an entire day.
As far as he could tell, he was a relatively average guy who travelled a lot, saw the country from cars and motel rooms. All in all, that didn’t sound too bad.
“And you’ve a done a whole lot of good too,” Dean returned. “Look, all of us, you, me, Sam and Cas, we’ve all done things that are probably unforgivable. But we’ve all done things that we’ll never get enough thanks for too,” he added, the truth of it left him feeling raw, and his skin thrummed as he tried not to think of how it all balanced out.
“Are you saying that a dictatorship would be preferable?” Cas returned flatly, he tilted his head slightly as he continued to stare.
and less to do with the shattered ceramic now littering the floor) and once he’d swept the remains away, Dean had given Cas a quick hug because the dude looked down right miserable and Dean just couldn’t stand it. When he stepped away, Cas gripped him at the shoulder, blue eyes shining like the ocean. Then he’d told Dean all about meeting Mary. He had said that he was now less distrustful of computers, but didn’t want to let his guard down completely. And they’d laughed about that.
“Hey, if they ever get under your skin and you feel like you’re gonna go postal or something, you can come hang out with us,” Dean said, body held rigid against a rejection he supposed was coming. “You don’t have to just turn up when you need help or when we’re in trouble, we’re friends Cas, you can just turn up if you want,” he continued, unable to swallow his need to explain himself and keep back the baying silence.
“Well no, she wasn’t Death yet, she was still just a reaper at the time. Cas killing her is what made her Death,” Sam clarified, ever the stickler for facts and details.
“I didn’t mean that you hadn’t, I just, you’re better than them and they’re idiots for not understanding that all you’re doing is trying to make things better,” he said, trying to smooth over his misstep.
“You’re not dying again, are you?” Sam asked, stealing the words straight out of Dean’s mouth, his eyebrows reached toward his hairline.
’. Though, it felt far more fitting than Jimmy if he was being honest. It was just another thing he would have to ask Dean about when the man arrived.
When they’d been crunching down the dirt road, the odd building that slowly rose in the distance came into focus, and Castiel had been quietly overcome with a growing sense of unease. He felt as though he had to keep his guard up. And while he walked through the tight corridors, he got the feeling that he shouldn’t make himself too comfortable, that something might come up, something might change, and he’d have to leave.
The sun was just peaking over the horizon as they pulled around the corner. Eileen was sat on the bench at the bus stop, staring down the road, and the way her face lit up at the sight of Baby stole Dean’s breath. If Sam’s gasp was anything to go by, then he was feeling something similar, though probably more intense. It was good to see his brother so happy after everything.
He hadn’t said enough. It would never be enough. Dean knew he didn’t deserve Jack’s forgiveness, he hadn’t done a damn thing to earn anyone’s forgiveness, but people just kept on forgiving him anyway. He might as well try to earn it.
Blearily, he reached out for the stale cup of water sat on the dresser. His hold was shaky, but he managed to get the cup to his mouth without spilling a drop, which was a major win if the past day and change were anything to go by.
Cas stared after Dean, squinting at the space he had left behind. That was sudden, he thought. Dean could have left to sort out getting Cas discharged, and perhaps to get him some clothes, but he hadn’t said a word so it was anyone’s guess.
“You know damn well what I mean,” Sam returned sharply, “we both know that you’re the one who should be telling him this stuff.”
“You’re not going to change my mind,” Castiel said, with the same stubbornness that Dean often cursed, he’d come so far and there was no point in backing down now.
“You could have been God,” Sam said, voice tinged with a strange sense of awe, as though that was something they might want to do given everything they’d been through.
Sam had said that once they got to the bunker, since the pain in his head was subsiding, that he would probably be able to remove the dressing. Castiel stood before the short bay of sinks that sat beneath a long horizontal mirror and unwound the bandages around his head. He dropped the dressing to the counter and tore away the gauze. A strange relief filled him at the sensation of air against his skin. An angry red line tore up from just above his right eyebrow and disappeared into his hairline.
There was something uncomfortably intimate about shaving someone else. The close proximity and the fact that you had to touch the other person constantly, Dean felt like a teenager, terrified of being caught with his hand down his pants and a questionable magazine open on the bed, in reality he was a middle aged man holding his friend’s face and if anyone came in, the only indication they’d get that this was anything besides a friend helping out a friend was the blush furiously burning across Dean’s speckled face and the frantic pounding of his heart that he was sure that anyone in the room with them would be able to hear. If it weren’t for Cas’ continued clumsiness, he would have been able to shave himself, but he couldn’t and no one wanted Cas to accidentally slit his throat.
“Why shouldn’t I be?” Dean returned, leaning slightly against Baby’s side, “the world’s not ending, everyone’s back, we’re not Chuck’s meat puppets anymore, Jack’s still here, Eileen’s here, and we’re on our way to get Cas,” he reeled off, counting it all with his fingers. “That’s one hell of a win, it’s the best damn win we’ve ever got Sammy,” he added, hands open as he stared back at Sam.
They slipped into the bunker. Clean air ticked through the complex, and tickled the hairs on the back of Castiel’s neck. Dean’s boots clanged against the metal steps, Claire’s own boots tacked sharp and metallic, while Castiel’s and Jack’s steps were soft shoed in their sneakers. They followed Dean into the kitchen. Claire dumped her bag on the map table on the way, smirking as she looked around the facility, and she made a point of calling the Men of Letters a ‘creepy doomsday cult’.
“I would like to leave as soon as possible,” Cas agreed, and stared down the length of himself, toes curled under the sheets.
Laughter spilled out over the bench and Dean tried not to think about the last time he’d laughed like this, tried not to count back the days. He also tried not to think about how Cas always seemed to be there whenever laughter broke out of his throat like a runaway.
If Dean were being really honest, he’d had plenty of opportunities to get the words out, he’d just never been able to do it, but then again he hadn’t really tried.
Hearing Cas try and fail to describe his dreams about heaven and everything he’d been through before they had met was like listening to poetry about a painting he’d never seen. It was beautiful, though he didn’t understand a damn word of it. Still, it was nice that Cas was remembering things, of course he’d have preferred it if he were remembering something more recent.
Dean froze. Castiel wondered how the statement could possibly shock Dean. He could have hit him, and he didn’t need to be brainwashed for it this time. This really was not how he’d wanted this to go. He hadn’t pictured saying those words in a dilapidated clapboard house, covered in viscera, stinking of the insides of what had formerly been a person and the telltale scent of sulphur of a demon, accusing each other of being reckless. Though, given their track record, Castiel probably should have known better.
“For one, your name, that one’s complicated, and what you do, what we do, and the fact that you’re not even human, or well at least you weren’t until very recently,” Dean said, speaking as though he were going down a check list.
“Yeah, yeah I know Jimmy, he’s family. What’s happened to him?” Dean’s heart was beating like a jackhammer against the back of his sternum, trying for a jail break.
“Hello Claire,” he said, lamely, because it was all he could think to say. “I hope the journey here wasn’t too taxing,” he added, feeling increasingly out of his depth in her presence.
His skin prickled with discomfort. Light, bright and stark, filtered through his closed eyes. When he opened them, everything was too bright and he had to close his eyes for a moment. Through wincing squinted eyes, his surroundings slowly came into view. Tubes weaved their way in and out of him, and he tried not to think too much about their purpose. The mattress beneath him was shallow and hard, and the sheets were thin, though the pillows his head was propped up against were somewhat comfortable. Aches, from various parts of his body, thrummed in the background of his mind. He supposed that there was a severe level of pain being dampened by the painkillers he presumed were being pumped through his body.
He was only half way through his breakfast as the underline thrum of aches and pains began to get louder and closer to the forefront of the his mind. Swallowing alone made him feel like a nail was pressing slowly into his skull. That thought sent Castiel’s stomach rolling. He dropped his fork, closed his eyes, and gingerly pressed a hand to his head. His hands were shaking.
“Do you know where you are?” the nurse asked, watching him, filing away his reactions to be reported later.
“I don’t know kid, don’t read too much into it, they had the same actor play the killer twice,” Dean said, shrugging, and got on with the task at hand.
It didn’t look like Cas would have been able to ask any questions anyway, the guy had passed out the instant his head hit the pillow. The day had been pretty hard on Dean, and he couldn’t imagine the toll it had taken on Cas. It was probably a good thing. At least he hadn’t tried to shower, because Dean didn’t know how he’d stop himself from fussing over Cas. It was already hard enough to keep a respectable distance between them and to keep his hands to himself. Cas could act like a disgruntled alley cat on the best of days, there was no telling how he’d react if Dean acted how he usually did with Cas’ lack of memory.
“Huh,” Castiel breathed, “I suppose that makes sense,” he added. Opening the bottle of water still caught between his thighs, he dropped the pills into his mouth and chased them with a large gulp of water, sighing as he pulled the bottle away. He closed up the bottles and stuffed them into the already full glove compartment.
Whatever reply either his brother or Cas was going to make never came, as Dean was raised from the floor and launched through the blown out window into the sodden grass outside. Though he was only winded and likely bruised, it took him a moment to get back on his feet.
“These are my clothes,” Castiel returned, he frowned at the supposedly knowing smile spreading across Claire’s face, though he didn’t know what it was she thought she knew.
For now the motel’s creaky springs left a whole lot to be desired and Dean was having trouble falling asleep. It wasn’t just that he was uncomfortable, though he was but a certain level of discomfort came with the territory, but his mind was still reeling from earlier that day. He’d known that almost everything would be difficult to explain to Cas. Their lives were complicated and it was hard to untangle one event from the knotted string of Christmas lights that was the last twenty years of his life and make it understandable. And he’d expected Cas to get upset, angry or frustrated. But that strong shock of emotion, like a PTSD flashback, had taken him by surprise. Though, he figured he had handled it pretty well. Sam had given him a sympathetic nod through the rearview, so he supposed he hadn’t done too terribly.
“I believe that it might have, several years ago, but now, it seems that the rules have been irrevocably broken,” Castiel said. When he had fallen it was because he was losing his faith in his father or at the very least questioning it. Given the circumstances, Castiel still felt that it was only natural to question his faith in that moment, but he still looked back in shame that he had wavered, even given what he knew now. There were other angels who had done far worse and had kept their grace and hadn’t fallen. Even when Castiel had turned his back on his friends and played at being God, a blasphemy that he still cringed at the thought of, an act he was still working to redeem himself from, he did not lose his grace or so much as stumble.
For some reason, the fact that Cas had called Sam and not him stung. There was supposed to be some kind of bond between them, at least that was what Cas had said to Sam, so why was he calling Sam?
In several long determined strides, Castiel approached the table and grabbed the book. He held it up and examined the cover. It was almost instantly apparent why the boy had been so embarrassed, it was quite explicit without actually being explicit. The cover was a simple black and white picture depicting a young man wiping his mouth with a bloody hand. There was something erotic about it, at least the way he understood it from the contents of John Berger’s
“My injuries make it difficult to enjoy it,” Castiel said, though he had enjoyed the music for the most part.
“You’re really set on this aren’t ya?” Dean said, brows twitching as he started up at Castiel, and sipped at his drink again.
What he wanted was for his family to stay together and not change so much that he didn’t recognise them anymore, he wanted them to enjoy their freedom together.
Before he could take the bag, a weight flattened along his back and Dean was forced hard against the ground, face in the dirt. The witch’s fingers were cold and bony around his throat. Dean could feel them grinding against the muscles in his neck, crushing his windpipe, it quickly became near impossible to breathe.
“You don’t know what you’re saying,” Dean said and shook his head again. He sighed, shoulders slumping, and a wet breeze moved through the forest in his eyes.
“You’re like completely covered in guts, and I think there’s a piece of jaw bone stuck to Cas’ coat,” Sam explained, pointing between them with a disgusted sneer. “Anyway, real glad you finally pulled your head out of your ass, congrats,” he added, smiling wide and goofy.
“Cas, do you think you might be in love?” Sam asked, his voice was soft and his tone delicate, as though he were worried that he might hurt Castiel’s feelings.
Something shifted in Cas’ face, as though he were remembering all the times Dean had made a choice, every single time he’d used his free will and exactly where it had got him. Dean swallowed, hard, and took a sip of his coke. Where his decisions and free will had gotten him was right back where he started. At least he had his brother back, Bobby was alive and doing the best he could given the circumstances, and Cas seemed to be doing okay. Dean had long ago learnt to take what good he could get.
So far, Cas remembered heaven in a vague muddy way and that was likely to continue, according to Sam, considering the mental capacity of the human brain. He had, however, mentioned some anecdotes about Gabriel and Balthazar and besides those vague and strangely poetic descriptions, that was the most Cas had said about his heavenly times. Besides that, Cas remembered specific dinners with startling clarity, probably because of the way they were sitting and what they’d been eating. He remembered getting Jack back (the first time), and remembered sitting with Dean through long nights. He’d remembered most of the whole deal with Gadreel, with Sam and Dean filling in the blanks.
Cas took a moment, seemingly considering which out of the million and one questions he had to pick out and actually ask, as his eyes skittered over the room. Dean took the opportunity to really study Cas for the first time since the hospital. His hair was flat and shiny in that way that said it needed washing and his stubble was getting a little long, edging toward becoming a beard, and the sight of it reminded Dean too much of the last time Cas had been human. He swallowed down the long worn guilt. He was making up for that, he was trying to make up for all of it.
To distract himself from that longing, he returned to the driver’s license. The most puzzling part was that it was almost ten years out of date, he wondered how he hadn’t needed a new one for the last decade, he didn’t know much but he knew that the American public transport system was nowhere near that reliable. It was a mystery. Maybe he had someone who drove him around, maybe he’d been banned from driving for some reason, and maybe he had been in an accident before that meant he could no long drive. But all of that didn’t explain why it was uselessly sitting in his wallet ten years later.
Sam mostly asked about his wellbeing, and he asked after Sam’s in return, and it seemed as though they regularly discussed Dean’s wellbeing too. Beyond that, they shared pictures of various wildlife and scenery.
“Well come on, show me what you’re made of Eastwood,” Claire said, smirking at Dean, “better hope you don’t break a hip getting to the kitchen,” she folded her arms over her chest.
“The balance of those powers now exists everywhere, I dispersed it evenly throughout the universe, and left enough in heaven to uphold it and left instruction for the remaining angels to turn it into what it was always meant to be,” Jack explained, looking between the brothers, as though he were simply talking about what he’d had for breakfast. “I also brought everyone back.”
“I suppose I should get changed then,” Cas said eventually, voice as steady as a smooth river. He sat up with some effort and pulled the sheets back. Sam started to rise from his chair, but Cas drilled him back into the seat with a hard stare. And he clambered out of the bed on his own. Dean scoffed as he watched Cas shuffle off into the bathroom, bag full of clothes caught in his left hand.
“For now, things appear to have settled,” Cas said, and Dean could feel those deep ocean blues boring into him, “I won’t bore you with the details, but we’ve created a system that most feel
They looked good together, and something about that filled Castiel with a hopeful warmth, they both deserved some happiness. The word
“I’d like to have a pet,” Jack said, and Dean couldn’t help but cringe at the thought of how it had gone last time, he hoped the kid didn’t see and watched as Sam signed for Eileen, “to make up for everything with the snake, but also to have as a companion.”
“Even after Metatron endowed me with the knowledge of your popular culture, there are still gaps in my understanding,” Castiel said, diving right in, being direct was just the way he was now.
Claire was a firecracker. Blonde hair and fierce eyes, she rocketed out of her car and punched Dean in the arm, hard, and then she hugged him. Castiel watched with warm amusement.
Jack sat up front with Dean, with the box of cassette tapes held in his lap, and that bright wide smile spread across his face. He filed through the tapes, walking his fingers over their cases. If Dean weren’t so distracted, he would have been chewing Jack’s ear off about his taste in music. But the only thing on Dean’s mind was getting Baby all the way to the edge of the country, and getting to Cas.
Sat in the cab of the flatbed, the hood glistened brown and gold in the dazzling sunlight, Castiel watched a crow pick at undefined road kill though he wasn’t really seeing the cycle of life before him. His mind was on that snippet of a poem. The case was over and the Winchesters had only suffered minor injuries, which was apparently an achievement and a major success. And so, Castiel had nothing to occupy himself with.
From the looks of his text messages, he and Dean also frequently messaged each other. The messages seemed to consist mostly of asking where the other was, random photos of food, animals and vistas from the road, jokes he didn’t understand and his reply stating that he didn’t understand, and short discussions about movies and shows they’d seen. He used a lot of emoticons. Their closeness, no matter the true nature of it, was very apparent.
A song, one he didn’t quite recognise, came from the radio. It was something sickly sweet and nostalgic, reminding Dean of memories he’d never had. The lyrics mentioned home several times.
Guilt twisted thickly in his stomach. He gritted his teeth against the sensation as Claire regaled them with tales of her hunts. Dean kept quizzing her and giving her pointers on how to eliminate different monsters. It made the world sound so dark and terrifying. He was thankful that there were people like Sam and Dean, and Jody and Claire to protect the unknowing from the things that lurked in the darkness. He only wished that they didn’t have to.
Something in the air changed, like it does just before lightning strikes, an oppressive pressure and Dean was almost certain that his ears popped. That soft flutter of fabric and maybe wings came. Dean turned from the car to find Castiel stood beside him, the angel never did learn his lesson about personal space.
“Hello, sorry to bother you, but I work for the Willapa Harbor hospital in South Bend,” came the gentle voice of a woman, she sounded professional but empathetic.
“Wouldn’t it be Peter Falk that had a glass eye and not Columbo, or is it stated in the show that he has a glass eye like the actor who plays him?” Jack asked, tilting his head as he looked at Dean quizzically, face open and earnest.
Cas pushed the mixtape into the tape deck as soon as they got going. Dean stared hard at the radio for a moment, but didn’t comment on it. He supposed that it wasn’t surprising, it was obviously difficult for everyone to navigate his lack of memory and he understood that it hurt to not be remembered by someone important to you, and Dean seemed to be taking it the hardest of them all.
“Hello Dean,” Cas said, looking up from his phone, the corners of his lips twitched upward like it was inside joke. And in a way it kind of was. Dean guessed that Cas was remembering a new and different time those words had come out of his mouth every time he said it.
“Almost as long as we’ve known each other,” Cas added, He kept doing that, mentioning how long they’d known each other, as though it were somehow significant to every conversation they had, as though it might hold the key to some sort of secret, Dean wouldn’t ask because he dreaded the answer.
“What do you mean wait and see?” Dean said, brows pinched as he scowled. He knew he could have been looking things up at the last diner or in the motel room he’d shared with Jack, he knew that, but he also knew that he couldn’t think about what had happened to Cas for too long. It wouldn’t do to lose his shit before they’d even made it into Washington.
“Have you ever been in love Dean?” He asked, hands clasped in his lap, he watched Dean go still for a moment before he replied.
“Your favourite human, hunter, Winchester brother, take your pick,” Dean reeled off, that smug smile had returned to his face.
“Hey Cas,” Dean said, feeling more self-conscious than he’d felt since his teen years, he cleared his throat and rubbed his hands on his jeans, “don’t you go forgetting about us now.”
Sam took his shot and the ghost disappeared, dropping Dean to the floor in a heap. With a groan, he got back onto his feet. He was going to have a hell of a lot of bruises when this was over, if that was all he had in the morning then they’d call this hunt a wild success.
Castiel stumbled out of the diner, with Jack close by, hanging beside his left elbow in case something happened. The sun beat down against the dirt parking lot. A breeze whipped around them, pulled on his shirt, made his hoodie flap like a cape and twisted through his already messy hair. As soon as Jack unlocked the car, Castiel slipped into the front seat, sighing against the warm dark leather. He left the door open and the breeze slipped in, ghosting over his skin.
“So what now, you’ve got your grace back?” Sam asked, always the smarter and focused one, asking the important questions.
“Oh, okay, okay, I’ll, I – I’ll be there soon, Cas, okay?” Dean stammered, the scrape of wood on wood tore into Castiel’s ear through the phone.
“It’s didn’t,” Sam bit out, he grabbed Dean’s coke and sucked on the straw. Dean let the trespass slip. “Apparently she didn’t leave anything behind, she wasn’t sentimental, and her house mostly burned down anyway so there really shouldn’t be anything for her to be attached to,” he said, pointing at Dean with the straw end.
“As in you and me together, us, yes,” Cas said, patience stretched taught and Dean was that he was about to make it snap.
“Cause it kinda is, and look it’s not like you were going around and making excuses for me, but you were always just different with me, you know like one way with everyone else and an entirely different way with me and Cas, you don’t need to make yourself
“Uh, okay,” Sam drew out, seemingly as caught off guard by the action as Cas was. “The doctor explained the extent of your injuries, he said that you’ve been making great progress and have even started remembering a few things, which is really promising,” he went on, shifting awkwardly on his feet.
“Dude, when she died, Reagan was president,” Dean returned, voice flat and serious as he stared hard out the windshield. Castiel didn’t understand why it mattered who had been president when Mary had died.
Eileen tapped Sam’s shoulder and he scrambled to explain the situation, signing as he turned to face her.
The photo album was full of blurry scenery taken from a moving vehicle, a staggering amount of nature shots, a series that appeared to be an attempt at capturing a bee, a few shots of him with a young blonde woman, group shots that mostly consisted of a tall man with long chestnut brown hair who seemed to be somewhere in his mid-thirties, a younger man with a kind face and sandy hair, and a middle aged man with mousy brown hair and an ever present rough stubble, the last was instantly recognisable as the man from his memories of the motel rooms.
“Okay,” Dean drew out. He supposed he deserved that, Sam had told him, and kept telling him, that he had to be patient with Cas.
“That is what I am trying to find out,” Castiel replied. There was something that kept him from outright saying that he believed he might be in love with Sam’s older brother. Castiel suspected that Sam already knew, or at least had some sort of inkling, but the words stayed in his mouth.
He couldn’t hold the wallet up anymore, his hand was shaking too much, and he dropped his arm into his lap.
They settled into the booth with the others and ordered. Dean let the chatter wash over him as he sipped at his coffee. Sam and Jack were explaining everything that had happened between everyone being wiped from Earth and her resurrection to Eileen, alternating hands animated over the table as Jack and Sam translated for each other and Dean couldn’t help but smile at Eileen’s reaction to Lucifer calling Michael a cuck (Sam had to spell the word out and that had Dean wondering if there was a sign cuck).
“Well, while you were teaching Jack the right way to play air guitar, I was reading up on it and amnesia’s mostly a wait and see sort of thing. We won’t know what’s really going on with Cas until we get there,” Sam said, with that prissy little look on his face, as though Dean should have been doing research whilst he was driving or in his sleep or something.
“You don’t understand, of course you don’t because I didn’t really understand that,” Dean grumbled because everything he felt about Cas and ‘him and Cas’ was so messy that he’d probably never get it all straightened out on his own. “I’m not gonna deny it because everyone else fucking knows it, that there’s something between us, but we’ve never really had the opportunity to do anything about it,” he finished lamely.
He waited for the anger, or any sort of strong emotion to come, but bafflingly it didn’t. Maybe he believed them.
“I was, for a little while, but now my head hurts,” Cas said, throat audibly clicking as he swallowed, the sound of him shifting against the headboard was loud in the silence of the night slowly spilling into day.
“You never answered my question,” Castiel shot back, watching as Dean chewed on the apple pie. He felt bad about souring what was one of Dean’s most favourite things. Apple pie and a beer alone in what was now his home, Castiel would have rather been listening to jokes he barely understood, but if they didn’t discuss this now he wasn’t sure when his next opportunity would come.
With one night behind them and the border of Wyoming at their backs, Sam was guiding them toward another diner, while Eileen and Jack flicked through magazines in the back.
“I had a guinea pig when I was little,” Eileen said, watching the girl with a wistful kind of smile on her face, “they get lonely, so you have to pair them up.”
When he wasn’t with Dean, he wanted to be, and Castiel supposed that was a loose way to describe what it meant to miss someone. Castiel knew what missing something was. He missed heaven. Though heaven had changed so much and he no longer recognised his original home, it was where he came from and it still meant something to him, and he often felt an ache to return when he wasn’t there. That ache was nothing compared to what he felt for Dean.
“When?” Dean bit back, brow furrowed and anger rising. If he’d have known then he could have called Cas and maybe they wouldn’t be about to spend a few days driving, maybe they could have met in the middle and Cas would be okay. Sam shot him a look, but Dean didn’t care, it was a pretty damn big thing to miss out.
“Cas,” Dean breathed. It sounded like a warning, a plea, and a prayer. His eyes were shining in that way that reminded Castiel of tall grass after rainfall.
He thumbed through the pictures again and again. At first, he’d hoped that they might trigger something, but the most he’d felt was a short snippet of walking through a wooded area. Underbrush crunched beneath his feet, the fresh scent of nature all around him, and the sun warming his face. It was a nice memory. Though, it didn’t give him really any clue about himself.
A short rap of knuckles against the door startled him from his thoughts, and he fumbled to place the cassette back in the draw and turn the television off at the same time as Taina’s olive gentle face peaked around the door, she smiled brightly at him.
“Well, memories are weird, all sorts of things can make you remember something,” Sam said, and Castiel tried to appreciate how apparent it was that Sam had researched his condition. “People tend to say that smell can bring about strong memories, but it can really be anything, like the way someone’s standing or a particular sound or a phrase said in a certain way, it’s specific and precise in a way that no one can account for, which is frustrating when you’re trying to remember something,” he said, smiling at Castiel.
“Alright, uh,” Dean murmured and Castiel could practically hear him thinking, “ah, I’ve got a good one,” he said eventually and cleared his throat. “A couple of years ago, probably close to four, we were driving some place, dry weather and cracked asphalt, think it was Indiana. Anyway, it was just you and me and miles of road ahead and behind us, can’t remember what Sammy was doing but he weren’t there. We weren’t talking, we were just sitting comfortably together, with Zepp playing from the tape deck. And you started humming along to one of my favourite tracks. This low rough sound, like ground cement and tar, real Johnny Cash sounds, and I, I...,” Dean stumbled to a stop, at some point Castiel must have closed his eyes, and was bent in half with his forehead rested against his arm which was rested against his leg.
Maybe it should have concerned him more, but the doctors were confident that he would be able to make a full recovery, memories and all. They said it would take time, but still they seemed very optimistic. Though, he was yet to remember a single thing.
