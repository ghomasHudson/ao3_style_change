Charlie looked sympathetically at him. “I know.”
Dean rolled his eyes. As if a bullet would stop him. They waited another minute to ensure the patrol wouldn’t catch any movement before making their way to the aid station.
Dean wrinkled his nose at the smell and did his best to focus on his and Cas’s sweet smell of an orchard of apple trees after the rain instead, with whiskey and leather undertones. He went through each layer in detail. There were still bits of his apple pie and Cas’s thunderstorm in there if he focused. He memorized and categorized the feelings he could smell. Nervousness, Excitement. Pride. It was an exercise that calmed and reassured him.
“Shit.” That wasn’t natural.
Descriptions of the state John is in after being tortured and mutilated by Alistair. The torture isn't shown, just the aftermath. Still gruesome. Please take care.
Her scent was unmistakably Alpha, but now that he was closer he could tell where the notes of her scent and Sam’s now intermingled. Hers spoke of foreign cliffs meeting the ocean, of wildflowers and of sea spray. Of a cottage filled with leather books and whiskey. She smelled like family. She stood with the confidence of someone who knew how to take care of themselves, and Dean liked her immediately.
Sam blinked and it was like watching a stereo getting turned up to eleven. Sam relaxed and smiled. “Uh-huh, the orchard of apple trees after the rain hadn’t tipped me off at all”
“Don’t hurt yourself, Cassie,” Gabriel laughed.
Novak touched Dean’s shoulder to get his attention before signing <
One of Cas’s beautifully strong hands tightened around Dean’s dick, giving it a few measured strokes while the other caressed Dean’s ass, his fingers coming close, teasing but not touching Dean’s leaking hole.
Dean was cut off by Andrea’s arms wrapping tightly around him, her face buried in his chest. Dean stood stunned only for a moment before he wrapped his arms around her in return. He breathed in her scent. She smelled like an old house that had been shut up for too long. One that if you breathed deep, you could still pick out notes of cooking spices, fresh linen and sunlight. But now all it was just musty with age and lack of use. Dean didn’t know how long they stood holding one another, but long enough for their mutual scents to move more towards comfort rather than grief.
“No shit,” John replied. “Those marines' lives are on you.”
Dean wondered if his father would shout for help to bring the base down upon them, if his shout would even be heard over the sound of gunfire. Or would he reach for the baretta on his belt and try to shoot them down even though it would take more than one bullet to do so? Or would he pull rank and order them to stand down? Or start to bargain?
“Free from what?” Cas snarled. “From your pampered life as one of father’s favourites?”
“Naomi was always playing the long game, you know that, Cassie.” Gabriel shrugged. “It sounds like something she would do.”
“Let’s find out,” Cas growled and stuck her with the same IV that had been in Charlie.
“Probably?” Cas scowled.
“Dodger. Please repeat. Over.” Maybe he had misheard.
“I wouldn’t call this hasty,
Dean’s whole body shuddered at the thought of running into the Alpha again, but he wasn’t going to leave John anywhere near him either. Dean quickened his pace and brought up his assault rifle. Eileen wrinkled her nose and brought up her gun as well. Dean was both glad and upset that she and Sam were by his side for this. At least he was sparing Charlie and Cas from whatever they were about to walk into. Dean grimaced. No upside would make up for having to be separated from them. Garth and Jo immediately changed their postures to match Dean’s, while it took Ash and Bela a couple of seconds before they too went on high alert. The group moved swiftly through the tunnels on silent feet, weapons drawn.
Sam hung his head. “Sorry. I know we’re in shit. I never should have gone with them.”
“Do I smell like I’m lying?” Gabriel pressed.
“It’s true, Sir. The military is sterilizing their kind to get rid of them permanently,” Ketch said right afterwards. “As they should. We don’t need those monsters to fight our battles for us.”
“They are sterilization shots you naive fool!” Lucifer nearly shouted, his eyes fixed on Cas.
Cas shrugged. “I was closer with Hannah, Anna, and Gabriel but…generally yes. I am the only legitimized child outside of my Father’s wife and mistress’s kids. My Omega-dad is a nobody, just the gardener, so no one really knows why Father claimed me when there are so many other children he hasn’t. It didn’t make me very popular amongst my siblings growing up, claimed or otherwise...and there is a large age range between us. So more often than not I was left to my own devices."
“Stop calling me that,” Cas growled. “And I haven’t ‘come around’ as you say. It doesn’t take much to agree that Naomi is conniving and vindictive.”
“Fine. Go,” Henricksen conceded.
“We’ll work on that as well. One problem at a time.”
“Fuck off, Gabriel,” Cas snarled before he tugged on Dean’s hand. Dean looked over at his Mate only to be surprised with Cas holding the two white plastic cups Ash had left on the table in his other hand. “How about we get those samples for Ash while we wait for him to finish with your brother and take our minds off all of this, hmm?” Those eyes that had consumed him from the moment they met were fierce now, full of anger and promise, and love, and no small amount of mischief.
“That’s the spirit,” Jo snarked without turning around, keeping her eyes and gun fixed on the tunnel behind them.
“No. It’s called Google, and I look up everyone I meet. Something I was trained to do by my Omega-Dad, for good or ill, I suppose. I must admit I took a particular interest in you after you explained how you and Charlie lived. Impeccable military record except for one mark on your Page 11 during training, after which you were a model soldier. Despite that, you were bypassed for a promotion at least three times.”
Dean leaned against Baby and took a deep breath. He was grateful for her presence here and for driving them across the country. Two months after they’d moved home, John had driven up to their new house, knocked on their door, held out Baby’s keys, then nodded and walked away. Dean didn’t know if it was an apology, an acknowledgement, or even penance, but John was gone, and Baby was his.
And just like that, lone wolf Dean Winchester had become a Packmaster.
Captain Ketch and a squad of soldiers came up behind Dean loudly. Dean grimaced, the Marine Corps was a lot of things but quiet wasn’t one of them.
“And stop wasting bullets. Surely you’ve noticed that they haven’t come inside yet?”
“Well, it’s not like Garth here was going to do it, right Garth?” Jo prodded Home-Cooked.
“We… we will be fine. There is so much that you don’t know. But you will. Everyone will. Everyone needs to. But for the truth to come out you need to let us go,” Dean said. They stared at each other for a long time. Dean was sure that his bare skin covered in blood, gashes and injuries that would have killed a human slowly closing up on their own emphasizing his “otherness” to the soldiers in front of him wasn’t going to aid his argument. But it couldn’t be helped.
Charlie bared her teeth at him and growled. “Murderer.”
The Therianterine Scandal occurred four years, eleven months and twenty days after the Divulgence. Some ‘unknown source’ had spilled not only military secrets, but also those of the powerful Novak family, whose misdeeds and corruption were plastered all over the internet.
“Alright. We’ll go. But not until after we’ve slept,” Dean said, to the shock of everyone else in the room.
much.”
“They are fine. They just stepped out for a moment while you were sleeping.”
John finally stood up and moved to the front of his cell.
“Thanks.” She yawned and snuggled back into his chest.
Dean could not and would not leave Andrea to live the fate of having lost a mate alone. He and Cas had driven all the way down to Louisiana to give her Benny’s dog tag, but he vowed silently that they wouldn’t leave without giving her far more than that. Andrea would always have a home with the Winchester Pack whether she took them up on it or not. Now, or ten years from now. At least for the moment they could share their story with her, about how Benny’s death was the catalyst in Dean’s life that ended up changing the world. How much Benny mattered to him, and how much she mattered to DeanDean—to them—as well.
“Wait,” Cas whispered urgently.
They sat in companionable silence for a while, enjoying the closeness they now shared. Dean knew his eyes had turned gold again when Cas reached out to touch his face. Dean nuzzled Cas’s hand.
Lilith looked more innocent in death. Her small human form hiding the monster that she had been, her hateful eyes now vacant.
Neither of them responded to Gabriel, but that didn’t seem to dissuade the other Were at all.
Dean finally unclenched his jaw and stepped back only to be surrounded on all sides by his Pack rubbing up against him, licking at his fur, reassuring and comforting him and each other. He pressed his forehead against Cas’s in relief and his Mate huffed happily. He licked Cas’s muzzle before turning to press his forehead against Charlie’s, Sam’s and Eileen’s. Against Jo’s and Ash’s. But not Garth’s. The need to howl rose in him, as the loss still rang loudly in his head and heart.
“Or the two of you could join us in here willingly instead.” Alistair laughed threateningly. “I could even sweeten the deal if you like. How about this, I’ll let your dear father go,” he shook John roughly by the neck, and John let out a broken croak as more blood seeped out of his wounds, “and even let these others leave, unharmed. Even little Sammy and his matching Alpha mate.”
Dean slowly returned to consciousness. Castiel’s warm body was curled around him, his head lying protectively over Dean’s neck. Dean felt safe and warm, but a twitch of his ears and a deep breath told him that wasn’t strictly true. Castiel raised his head so that Dean could move and groomed him gently as he opened his eyes. The big black wolf continued to groom him, nibbling at his fur, removing dried blood and stray tufts that had been displaced during the fight, until Dean had gained back all of his faculties.
The asshole had known better than to go to the Major or to any other commanding officer to complain about his treatment. No one was going to listen. The whole situation had been immediately filed under “Pack politics” and no one would go near it with a twenty-foot pole. Castiel Novak was well and truly alone. Had he been anyone else, Dean would have felt sorry for him.
Cas cautiously stepped towards him and when Dean didn’t flinch away, wrapped his arms tightly around him, coaxing Dean’s face into his neck to calm him down.
“Four days!” Gabriel crowed grinning before his face went slack with shock.
When they’d first been escorted out of the caves, Dean had been disoriented, but once they had reached the boundaries of the area that Dean had loosely considered to be his territory, he’d known exactly where they were—and was surprised to realize that they were coming from the completely opposite direction from where they’d been snatched in the first place. Babylon either had quite the tunnel system, or the caves they had attacked had been a trap from the very beginning. Both were equally likely.
“Stay in sight. Over.” Novak’s voice came over the coms and Dean growled.
“I don’t know, Dean…it was never really spoken about. We’d just have these big parties when new packs joined, it was a celebration. As I got older, I started to suspect there was something not quite right about it, but…I was also apart from my family for many years. Even before I was sent to the military, I was shipped off to boarding school.”
Dean was saved from having to half-ass an answer by his brother’s large hand on his shoulder.
Dean breathed deeply, taking in the Beta’s home-cooked meal with a glass of whiskey and a leather chair scent in one last time before he attached the tag to his own necklace.
“Yeah, I’m good. Go ahead, Red. We need to keep up our strength for this serious hostage situation after all.”
Dean nodded but didn’t respond.
“Status report!” Jo barked.
Castiel, the bastard, chuckled. “I understand where that chip on your shoulder comes from now. Can’t say I’ve met any Omega Packmasters before.”
“Wait!” Dean growled stepping towards Lucifer again, but not loosening his grip on Cas’s hand. Just because his hopes had died, didn’t mean his Pack had to. “What about Charlie? Why didn’t you capture her as well? She’s alone out there! And Sam. And Eileen. Their lives are forfeit if I go AWOL. I’ve probably already been away too long!”
“If she’s free,” Lucifer responded. “You should be prepared to kill the Humans you once fought beside if you are to free your packmate.”
large, Dean. The size of which we haven’t seen in, well…ever. It’s not just the core Novaks—of which there are plenty. They’ve merged with a number of different important packs over the years, always bringing in the new packs whenever one of their own finds a mate.”
“I know you’re awake, Little Wolf,” Dean whispered, his heart aching using Benny’s nickname for her. “We need to get up, something’s going on outside.”
“I agree.” Novak nodded and took a deep breath, also scenting the air. “The explosive device was not created or deployed from here.”
Castiel looked bewildered.
“Yes, Sir. I will know it until the day I die.” Charlie’s lip curled in disgust. Neither of them would ever forget the scent that had taken Benny from them.
“I’m…We’re going up there.”
The mood in the car was somber. Sure they were on their way to Jody’s, to reconnect and celebrate with her and the girls. They’d turned the car around the moment they found out Jack had restored their friends to this plane of existence. It wasn’t as if they had had a destination in mind when they’d set out either. Just a need to not be in the empty bunker, filled with the with memories of those they’d lost. So of course they were thrilled that these members of their family survived. And that Bobby had survived, that Charlie and her girlfriend had survived. But...
“You weren’t mated to my brother before,” Lucifer shrugged and dismissed them, consumed with the work in front of him once more.
Unlike Dean’s clean and unmatted fur, Castiel’s was still covered with dried blood. The other wolf had tended to Dean instead of to himself and it looked very uncomfortable. That would not do. Dean methodically groomed the other wolf, returning his coat to its natural black shine. Once he was free of blood Castiel shook out his fur and rubbed his forehead against Dean’s in gratitude.
“Charges set, Angel and I on our way. Over.” Dean responded, hoping to give his packmate the same reassurance.
I don't bite. Grin.
“It’s fine. It will heal. We need to go.”
Sam shook his head and got up to put his hand against the wall. He gestured for Eileen to join him and she placed her hand on the wall beside him. Her eyes flew open when she felt it.
A short sound was blasted across the base with an announcement that all personnel needed to report to the flagpole immediately.
Ash then passed him two small plastic containers, one with a yellow top and the other with a white one, and pointed to a small room off to the side. “Fill ‘er up!”
“Fuck both of you,” Dean snapped back.
“I know, Red! I know!”
“I’ll leave you to it then,” Gabriel said before turning back down the corridor, the guards following back out after him. “I’ll come collect you later.”
He never thought he’d see the day where he’d actually want to get back into the human-fear-sweat-and-gasoline-scented humvee, but it had been a strange week.
here. Not individually or as a Pack. Another Were could enter here and not disturb or change the smell of home because there simply wasn’t one.
“Ah, and Corporal Bradbury, at last.”
Hendrickson sighed and nodded. “I better not get in trouble for this, Winchester.”
“Snack?” Charlie held up a ration bar.
A large Were stopped in the passageway ahead of them when he saw them coming. At first, Dean wasn’t sure what he was up to, but the predatory way he licked his lips and leered at them could not be mistaken.
Dean struggled to sit up only to be knocked back over by the sudden snap of Garth’s Pack bond being obliterated from his mind.
Bela bared her teeth at Charlie. “Mutt!”
The two guards stepped forward and Dean flushed. Better to just get it over with. “Remind me of your names?”
“Shhhh,” Cas said against his mouth before kissing Dean again, his tongue sliding along Dean’s lips, requesting access. Dean quickly opened his mouth, eager to taste Cas once again. Despite what they had been through, Cas was still as intoxicating as the first time they had kissed. They kissed leisurely for a while, giving and seeking comfort in each other’s arms.
“Sure thing,” Dean said.
A half-hour later Novak had already worn down a path walking back and forth across the space in front of the bars.
Sam’s eyes were also misty. “I’m not sorry.”
“The military thing was Naomi’s doing as well,” Gabriel remarked. “Notably, none of the other Novak children ended up on the wrong side of this fight. Not even the bastards.”
“There’s always a choice!” Sam snarled, teeth bared, claws out and eyes flashing gold. He wasn’t sure how Ash and Bela were handling the amount of Alpha rage in the room, but for once, he didn’t fucking care. That was his brother they were refusing to help. And he didn’t believe in no-win scenarios.
“So?” Sam spoke first, clearly not as shell-shocked as a few others in the room. It was a conversation he’d probably had with his mate a couple of times before. Neither Ash nor Bela looked entirely surprised either, but then again, they had probably been working with the Therianterine for quite some time now. So it wasn’t a stretch to think they’d figured out that much already. “Do you think Naomi knew?”
Somehow he felt the former was more likely, after all, what kind of Pack could they possibly be if they couldn’t even scent bond? Even here, in their private space, Dean could only smell dirt, gun oil and sand. There was nothing of
Dean rolled his eyes. Of course, that was what she’d focus on. “How do you know the apple pie part comes from me and not Cas? It’s such a small part of the...”
“What part of this life
“No! This is making the best of a bad situation!” Cas snarled back.
“We’re not staying,” Dean snarled. “Let us go or kill us. I won’t be anyone’s experiment!”
“I understand,” Hendrickson said sadly. “We’ve got him.”
Sam looked over to Eileen sitting quietly beside him. She had brought a book to read and was seemingly completely absorbed in its pages. She didn’t seem or smell upset or worried even, just calm and ready. She was amazing. And every day Sam fell more and more in love with her. He wasn’t sure what he had done in this life to have found her, but he was endlessly grateful for her calm, straight-forward and practical thinking. Not that she didn’t get nervous, upset or angry, as he had already witnessed, she just seemed to be able to control and contain her emotions in a way he hadn’t really seen in very many people, and certainly not within his own family. She was wicked smart and had a sharp and talented tongue…Sam shook off those thoughts before he gave himself yet another problem to deal with.
“You’re being forced to cooperate instead of being a partner for the future of our species!” Gabriel argued.
Genocide. Lucifer was talking about
Dean saw red, but before he could rip the Lieutenant’s head off, Charlie slipped in between them and gently took the box from the young man’s hands. “Thank you, Lieutenant. I believe it is best that we take care of that job for you. I promise I will bring the box to you when we are done.”
When he was finally done, he dropped the sponge into the bucket of water and drew Cas in for a hug. They clung to one another for a moment, breathing in each other’s scents. Now cleaned from their activities, the changes to Cas scent had become more apparent. Wet leather and a watered-down glass of whiskey weaved their way through Cas’s forest after the rain scent. He smelled like family, like Pack, like home. It wasn’t enough.
“Like I got my ass kicked,” Dean snarked, but noted that the vast majority of his injuries had already healed. They’d been unconscious for a while. “You?”
“Really Dean? The room you mated in?” Sam complained.
Novak looked at him intently. “What is the scent?”
“Glad your mate is smart enough to see the light at least, Cassie!”
“Fuck me, Alpha,” Dean growled in between breaths. “Please.”
“Point taken.” Dean weighed the options. Everyone seemed content here. Were they all just true believers? Or was there something in the water…or the food? Surely it would take more than one dose to change people's susceptibility?
The same anxiousness that had plagued him at home now took hold of him on the never-ending plane ride, and this time he couldn’t even get up and walk around safely. So he sat in his seat and tried to contain his limbs as he tapped and fiddled. He couldn’t even read, write or play on his phone or computer as they had left all of their electronics back at the house. It made sense really, they wouldn’t be able to be tracked, and with any luck, their guards wouldn’t even notice they were missing until they had already reached wherever it was that Gadreel had sent them. On the other hand, if they were being kidnapped or if this went sideways, they were completely unable to call for help.
“Ah, Jo and Garth, it’s good that you’re here. Please escort Sam and Dean Winchester into this cell before you return Ash and Bela to their laboratory.” Alistair said evenly but his voice had the ring of a command in it.
“That is correct,
“You’ve made a mental map of this maze?” Sam asked.
The words stamped there had become as familiar to his fingers as the words stamped on his own. Were. B Lafitte. LA. B-. Fangs. He ran his fingers over the familiar bumps one more time before he held out the tag to Andrea.
Cas nodded into Dean’s shoulder but didn’t relax into the hug, Dean breathed deeply. How many second chances was he going to waste? His guts were all tied up in knots, but this time, this time he was going to set them free.
Dean looked at Sam, whose eyes flicked back and forth between the newcomer and the rest of the Pack, who had suddenly tensed with Lucifer’s entrance. Dean touched his brother’s arm in comfort, shaking his head slightly. Dean squeezed Cas’s hand before they turned around as one.
Dean turned to look at Gabriel, an eyebrow raised. “Oh yeah? And why is that?”
“Don’t worry about it. You’re not faring much better.” Dean smirked, nodding towards Cas’s own bruised neck. Cas blushed, which was adorable considering how they’d spent the last several hours, and how they’d likely be spending the next couple of days if this went how Dean remembered it.
Cas’s hands left his backside to cup his erection tenting his cargo pants. They had insisted on wearing their own clothing upon their return to base. The loose cotton pants they had been borrowing were comfortable, sure, but they weren’t practical. Dean whimpered and licked and sucked around Cas’s mating bite that wasn’t even 48 hours old yet. Cas’s clever fingers quickly undid Dean’s pants and pushed them down. A moment later Cas was on his knees in front of Dean, eying his formidable erection as if he hadn’t had a full meal in weeks.
“No problem. Now sit back down.” Eileen smiled and pulled him back down as if he weighed nothing. Sam huffed but sat back.
He slowly became aware that he wasn’t alone. At first, he kept moving thinking it was Charlie catching up with him, but when her red-brown fur did not appear in the underbrush he slowed to a trot. It wasn’t his enemy. He’d never mistake that scent for anything else, especially out here. There could be more than one enemy, of course. But then, he’d smell them too. Unless they were just like Dean’s scentless Pack. Unlikely. That left one other wolf. Dean slowed to a stop and waited for the stranger to show themselves. Moments later, a flash of black fur and bright blue eyes confirmed his guess. Castiel.
“Oh, these two? They’re just extra insurance. Have to make sure you don’t bother the locals or cause a fuss. To ensure everyone sticks to the agreement.”
“Don’t let the Humans bait you either. We’re not there to back you up if things go sideways,” Dean added as one of the Humvees exited the base from the gate beside them.
In less than ten minutes they were back where they started, but it felt like much longer than that. Each step rubbed Dean’s loose pants against his growing erection, causing him to stumble more than once as he moaned. Cas was always there to pull him along, never letting go of his hand, but never allowing Dean to pull him in either. It was maddening. He needed Cas to touch him.
Gabriel’s glare moved from Cas to Dean before he turned and walked out of the Mess, Dean, Charlie, Cas and their guards following after him.
“Get. Out.” Dean growled a deep dangerous sound, his teeth growing sharp and his eyes flashing gold. “Or I’ll kill you.”
“There are better ways to die, Corporal Bradbury,” she responded and stuck Charlie with the needle. Oh yeah, best doctor of the year award to this one. Opossums had more charm and a sweeter bedside manner than she did.
“We came here to stop a genocide, not participate in one. And if that makes us traitors then…then—so be it!” Garth said defiantly.
“It’s okay, Dean, go ahead,” Cas whispered in his ear, his arm pulling Dean closer to him, his hand dipping below his waistband to finger him. It was spectacular and sensational and not nearly enough, not enough for a man dying of thirst.
“Why are you so angry, Dean? Because it’s me?”
“Nothing for you to worry about. Congratulations on finding your mate, Castiel.”
Sam had narrowly avoided military service when they first came for him shortly after they’d come for Dean. He’d not only managed to stay in school and become a lawyer, but also convinced the US government to pay for his education and guarantee him a job working for Were rights in the military the moment he graduated. Sam had become a JAG. Dean was so fucking proud.
“I think you’ll find that we are as far from civilization as one gets,” she countered.
“Let’s do this,” Charlie said and strode out the door.
“Roger that. Over,” two voices called out into Dean’s ear. He grit his teeth. That’s not how it was supposed to go.
They were in a cave. A brightly lit cave with a pot in the corner, clothing and blankets folded and placed within reach, and plenty of ration bars and bottles of water. It would have been cosy, albeit bare-bones, had there not also been bars drilled into the floor that reached up to the ceiling. They were in a cell. A cell deep within caves that belonged to the pack who had ambushed and captured them. A pack that had killed many of the Humans they ran with, a pack whose leader had killed Benny. Dean felt a growl rumble up from his chest and managed to turn it into a whine.
“Okay people, let’s go. Lilith, you can come with us or fuck off. I don’t care which,” Dean called as he led his way through the tunnels back towards where they had split up, to where he hoped his Packsister and his Mate were already waiting for them.
“You’re embarrassed?” Cas asked curiously, and turned Dean’s face towards his, searching.
“No, it would be your pack doing those things, if you chose to take him with us. Or you could save yourself the trouble and just let him go. Either way, he’s not yours to kill,” Dean said confidently, hoping his bravado would pay off.
, Charlie.”
“That’s…” Cas started.
His confidence was mind-boggling. His arrogance was going to get him killed, maybe get them all killed. Dean rubbed Charlie’s back comfortingly and she sat back again. A look of determination crossed her face. She was ready to know more.
“I need a headcount from the rear—Fire team, you’re up” Master Sergeant Henricksen called out.
“Hey there, lil’ bro.” Gabriel grinned. “Long time no see.”
“There’s definitely something here. Over.”
John moved away from the bars into his cell, turning his back on Dean.
Cas stood back up and went to reach for the bucket again when Dean stopped him, holding his arms tightly. Cas looked confused.
Sam and Eileen both sent him looks and he did his best to push the thought away and clear his scent of anger and despair. It only partially worked, but Sam nodded at him in satisfaction after a minute. Apparently smelling stressed and worried was fine but anger wasn’t. He shook his head, he’d have to talk with Sam about that later. Or maybe never. Yeah. Maybe never.
“What, the Therianterine? Nah, dude. We’re trying to get rid of that shit in people’s systems, not add it back in.”
“A couple of heat signatures, human, a dozen streets north. Might be worth checking out. You smell something funny, Zepp? Over.”
?” Dean snarled his Mate’s words back at him. “Is this some sort of ‘do as I say and not as I do’ hypocritical bullshit?”
Dean didn’t think he would ever stop loving the way his Mate said his name. Even when Dean was just "Winchester," the way Cas’s voice rumbled out his name had always gotten Dean’s attention. Dean wrapped his arms around Cas in return. “Hey Cas, it’s not much but…”
Ten minutes and two tied up mechanics later, John was in the driver’s seat of a Humvee, Cas sitting directly behind him, gun in hand, with Dean and Charlie beside Cas in the backseat, out of view. The vehicle’s windows were small and tinted, and with any luck they would not be spotted.
“You’re welcome.” Dean grinned, overjoyed to see her alive, whole and awake. “I mean we’re just going from the frying pan into the fire though, so you might want to hold your appreciation for later.” He handed her the backpack of their things and she dug through it for some clothes.
After a couple of hours of searching, Cas’s hand securely in his, they had only managed to find food storage, a passageway that separated out into many other “rooms” like their own and a latrine. They’d also found a weapons cache but were quickly escorted away from it. What they hadn’t found was a single exit. It was incredibly frustrating.
“You stalking me, Alpha?”  Dean snarled. Who even was this jackass? Calling the Dive ‘The Divulgence’ like he’d been reading from a goddamn history book.
He could sense the vibrations of soldiers now moving around him, then the rough tug of someone dragging him behind the Humvee.
“That information’s not mine to tell you.” Gabriel turned and walked out of the tunnel and out of their view.
Dean rubbed his fingers over the metal. Were. B Laffitte. LA. B-. Fangs. It looked nearly identical to his own, but as he added it to his own chain, the additional weight was nearly unbearable. Dean bit back a sob. He would carry it until he could get it back to Benny’s mate, Andrea.
Ash paused, as if weighing his options before he grinned and shrugged. “Okay, next time for sure then.”
Over the next couple of weeks, a truce formed. Cpl Winchester and WO Novak worked extremely well together in the field but barely spoke to each other on base. Dean and Castiel, on the other hand, would spend their wolf hours running side by side, play fighting, or napping wrapped around each other. The first time Charlie had run with them she’d cornered Dean afterwards, arguing that if he was going to treat Castiel like Pack out there, then he should treat him like Pack in here. He’d shouted back at her that Novak wasn’t Pack, would never be Pack, but had begrudgingly allowed the other Were to put his bunk back into their barracks. He was pretty sure that was the opposite of what Charlie had in mind, but it was done now.
Eileen rolled her eyes. “I’m Eileen Leahy. I work for Were Rights International. And as for messy? Either the military had the Therianterine ready for their new recruits before the Dive even happened, meaning they were already aware of us, or they had a silent partner with deep pockets who supplied them with the product and the idea of recruiting and controlling us sometime in the initial days. Either way, those shots were already in production. Otherwise, it would have taken years for something like that to be created, tested and put into production, let alone distributed across the entire US military.”
“Oh yeah?” Sam asked, both eyebrows raised. “And we are just supposed to believe you then? That you’re a Novak because you say you are? And even if you were? So what? I don’t owe your family anything. In fact, I’d have some choice words for your Packmaster if we ever were to meet.” Sam bared his teeth with his threat, his growl growing in his chest. “I’m supposed to believe that you’ve been placed beside us on purpose in case of such an event?”
“You’re welcome.” Cas smiled softly and pulled him into a kiss. Dean wrapped his arms around Cas and pulled him closer until they were flush against each other. When they broke apart, Cas whispered against his mouth, ”I refuse to lose you.”
“You’d better hope so,” John retorted.
. After that, you can do whatever the fuck you want, as long as it doesn’t concern me or my Pack. Do we have an understanding?”
“I’m here, Dean,” Cas said, and Dean did his best to focus on Cas’s deep, stubborn blue eyes that moved into his field of vision.
“Please. You lot have 'we’re running at the first chance we get' stamped all over your foreheads.” She rolled her eyes.
Cas squeezed his hand and nodded. “We have each other, and the Pack. We’re okay.”
“We have no choice! He drew a bad card.” Bela shrugged.
Lucifer stared at Cas for a long moment and took a deep breath. Then he started to laugh. His laughter filled the cave. It was a terrible sound that raised all the hair on Dean’s body and made his gut clench unhappily.
Charlie continued talking but Sam’s ears had filled with white noise at the sound of his father’s name. John was here? With all of these Weres? She said his cell. Was he a prisoner? For how long had that been true? Had Dean come to save their father and that’s how he had been captured? Or had Dean been the one to hand John over to them in the first place? Sam’s mind swam with the possibilities. No, he decided, Dean wouldn’t have put their father in this much danger had there been no other option. Regardless of the man John was, Dean was a good person and he would not have done that.
Eileen wanted to sleep in shifts, but Sam’s mind was so busy with all of the possibilities that he could barely sit still, let alone sleep, so he kept watch while Eileen slept. He had been lulled into a false sense of security for years at this point, but somewhere in the back of his mind, he’d always known that this day was coming.
“Use mine,” Sam said. “I’m a universal donor.”
Dean flushed again. “More like embarrassed to be happy…got no business being—”
“No can do, Deano.”
John hesitated for a moment before he turned and walked out of the infirmary, Cas’s rifle at his back.
“Look, Winchester saved a lot of people’s lives today, taking the brunt of that explosion. So you should back off,” Benny drawled between bites.
“Good. I want him alive,” his father had said, glancing again at whatever Novak was doing on the other side of the wall. “Oh, and here are the Dog’s tags.” He had said dismissively, tossing Benny’s remaining dog tag at Dean before he had turned and walked away. Dean had snatched the dog tag out of the air and held it to his chest until the door had closed behind Major Winchester. Dean had heard a lot of sick jokes, but that one had been particularly vile. No respect, not even in death.
“Sam?” Dean raised an eyebrow.
When this knock came it wasn’t a nervous tap on the frame, but a strong, sure rap on the centre. Dean took a deep breath in but couldn’t smell anyone outside the door. He was up in a flash, his teeth already bared, angered that the corps would have sent in a new Were moments after they had removed Benny's effects—as if a Pack member could be so easily replaced. He threw open the door, a snarl on his face and fire in his belly and was immediately lost in a pair of piercing blue eyes. The man standing there was without a doubt one of the most beautiful Weres Dean had ever seen. He looked like Christmas morning even with his standard military haircut. Dean felt his world turn upside down as he drowned in those eyes.
Dean and Cas locked eyes for a minute before Cas nodded and stepped back out of Ash’s way. Dean rolled up his sleeve and exposed his arm to the other Omega when he motioned for it. “Promise me you’re not going to give me any more of that stupid drug, yeah?”
Dean took a deep breath in, scenting the air. “Just Humans here.”
“I’m not so sure,” Ash shook his head. “Lilith’s a lot of things but she’s not exactly a liar.”
, Cas. It’s a movie. About two incompetent guys?”
The guard did not move, just bared his teeth.
“No one here...or at least…Yesterday, I would have told you my Alpha father, who is safely at home in his office in New York, but after today, who knows?” Castiel shrugged.
is unmistakable,” John said with a sneer.
“Lovely,” Dean snarked.
“Nah. Not really.” Dean leaned in and kissed Cas lightly before he pulled back to explain. “We fucked once when we were both at a low point, and the need to be touched and to be comforted had become too much to handle anymore...and sure we’d cuddle occasionally, not that that stupid shack was built to handle three grown wolves in a cuddle pile. But he’s got—had...had a mate,” Dean stuttered and swallowed his grief down again, unsure that he would ever not feel the pain of it. “Andrea, back in New Orleans. And I’m not her.”
For a moment it looked like John wouldn’t respond and then he said clearly, “It’s nice to meet you, Eileen.”
Charlie considered this for a moment before she shrugged. “Yes. But both are bad options.” Her eyes wandered to the bed currently occupied by Dean and Castiel before looking back at them. “But I’m hungry. You’re useless without real food, and giving them some space right now is probably a good thing.” Charlie fiddled with the straps of the backpack she’d been carrying around.
“Someone is talking to us!”
“Hurry!!” Dean hissed to the group and ushered them towards the far corridor. Maybe if they were quick, they could avoid being noticed entirely. Dean kept his weapon up, guarding their retreat, while he watched men and Weres alike killing and dying on the other side of the cavern. He backed into the tunnel after the last person was safely inside, just as a shout and a bullet reached his position, narrowly missing him. He turned and ran after the group.
Lucifer considered him for a moment before showing his teeth in a facsimile of a smile. “That’s true.” He stepped aside and gestured to John. “He’s all yours,
“Hannah!” Cas called after his sister desperately, but she hadn’t even turned to look at him.
“Castiel,” Lucifer smirked. “I’d say it’s nice to see you again, but we both know that would be a lie.”
“So this one must have been Corporal Lafitte’s bunk,” Castiel said, moving to stand in front of Benny’s bunk, squished up against the back of the small hut-turned barracks.
“I think they’re more like Scooby and Shaggy. 'Cause we may think their presence is silly, but they still get the job done?” Charlie mused.
She nodded again as if she had set things right before she hugged him tightly again. “I never thought I’d ever get to know your scent,” she whispered into his chest. “I’m so glad you’re my Packmaster.”
“Corporal Bradbury, do you know this scent?”
“Hey Andrea,” Dean rubbed the back of his head awkwardly.
He turned his eyes away from the bed and rolled up his sleeve, sitting down on another bed and gesturing for Ash to hurry up. Moments later he had a needle in his arm, was hooked up to the machines, and passing blood and plasma to his brother. The sounds and scents coming off the other bed were wild, and in that moment he was endlessly grateful that Dean had found Castiel, Novak or not. The other Alpha had been there for Dean when he could not and Sam wouldn’t forget it. Sam looked down at the multiple tubes now connected to his arm, and reminded himself that for the first time in years, he could help too.
“Gabriel. Tell us now,” Cas ordered with a deep, compelling growl.
“Lucifer is planning on exterminating the human race!” Charlie shouted at the soldiers. “If you stand with him you’ll be an accessory to genocide!”
Dean choked out a laugh. “You always know what to say.” Dean let Cas pull him away from the others and back to a small cave off to the side. “Do as Ash asks, and close your ears, Sammy!” Dean called out. His brother groaned in return, muttering about how he’d already smelled enough thanks, he didn’t need to hear it as well.
to stand next to these men and women who have lost
They were smuggled out of the duplex in their neighbour’s SUV, stuffed into a much too small secret compartment between the backseat and the trunk. Gadreel had dropped them on the tarmac on an airfield in front of a private jet, cited his need to return to the duplex in a reasonable time frame for grocery shopping as to avoid suspicion, and had promptly driven off without further explanation. It had left Sam sore, stiff and in a foul mood. So far, the extended Novak family had left a lot to be desired. But at least he wasn’t stuck with this one as Dean was stuck with WO Novak.
“I did have a reason!” Ketch cut in before Lucifer had a chance to respond to Charlie’s threat. “I’m here to collect on our deal. Here are the three Weres you wanted as promised. So you hold up your end of the bargain and leave our base alone!”
A moment later, Bevell went limp in Dean’s grip, and Dean laid her down on the bed beside Charlie. They were lucky that no other soldiers were laid up in here, especially with how the attack would have gone down. Maybe it had been so bad that they had evaced the injured instead of leaving them here for Bevell and her team of combat medics to take care of.
Alistair and Lilith hadn’t been in the group of wolves they had left earlier when going to get Charlie. In fact, there were at least half a dozen more wolves now standing around than when they had left. Were they expecting trouble? Or were they here to fight? The real question was whether or not they were here for Dean and his Pack or for the Humans back at the base. Dean focused on the giant white wolf in front of him and pushed away the gnawing anxiety of having Alistair at his back. Lucifer shifted elegantly and draped himself in a ridiculous white robe.
“I know. You did good.” Dean said, emotion making his voice rough. He stepped away and cleared his throat, surveying the carnage. “Can someone get John out of there, please? Ash, can you try and patch him up?”
Well shit. Good to know that Ketch was the one Dean could thank for this mess, even if the bigoted asshole did it to save his own hide.
“Only that you were lured away by that strange scent—possibly on purpose. Not sure if that’s because they wanted to keep you away from the explosion or to capture you, but you were definitely singled out,” Charlie reasoned.
Dean bared his teeth and growled, ignoring the wolves baring their teeth at him in return. “I am. That’s why, as Packmaster, I know that the needs of my Pack outweigh my own.” Dean took a measured breath and felt Cas’s shoulder gently touch his, and Charlie placed her hand discreetly on his back. They were with him.
“Dean is an excellent Packmaster, and there is no natural order, just a societal one. One that I thought you were trying to strip away. You have no more say in what I do than Father does,” Cas explained, never raising his voice, even though Dean could feel him tremor through their joined hands.
“No, I mean, reach out to Sam again, and tell him that…tell him that I will meet him in Poughkeepsie and I guarantee he will go with you. In fact, I wouldn’t say anything unless you are ready to get him out of there that very minute.”
Even though it had only been a few minutes since he’d entered the house, the smoke outside had already cleared, and they were in for a world of trouble. Novak was lifting up one of the men when the rat-at-ta-tat of automatic fire echoed around them. Huh. Eardrum was healing faster than he thought. Novak moved swiftly, but he wasn’t fast enough. Dean saw the moment Novak nearly buckled and dropped the marine as the bullet went through his side. He kept moving.
Dean glanced back at his strong, stubborn Mate, and breathed deeply. Was this the moment it would all go to hell?
Cas growled in response, but Gabriel’s laughter could be heard echoing down the passageway along with his footsteps and those of their guards.
Dean and Cas shared a glance, this was something they could work with.
“Don’t you ever fucking do that again!” she snarled at him.
Cas glared at him stubbornly for a moment before he nodded and relented. Dean relaxed a fraction. He knew it wasn’t going to be that simple.The Novak Pack’s misdeeds would weigh heavily on Cas for a long time, but hopefully Dean could help redirect those feelings into something productive.
“Everyone else is coming with me,” Dean ordered, pointing at Bela, Ash, Eileen and Sam once Charlie had stepped away. And to Dean’s relief, no one else raised an objection or tried to complicate their escape any further than it already had been.
“At the very least, something that can suppress our hormones without sterilization. Wouldn’t that be useful?” Lucifer asked so earnestly, it made Dean pause. Even if Lucifer was a murderer and a scumbag, it didn’t mean he wasn’t also trying to help their species.
“He’s your what?!” Dean snarled, immediately regretting his decision to sit so close to the other Were. “Are you fucking kidding me?” A huge list of possible scenarios flew through Dean’s head. Each one, worse than the last. Novak was sent to spy on Dean’s Pack. Sent in to befriend him. To distract him from the truth. To get under his skin. To lead him into this trap. A snarl ripped through Dean’s throat and he bared his teeth. He wrenched himself up and away from the other Were, putting as much distance between them as the tiny space allowed.
“I have no reason to trust you over them. For all I know you’re just bullshitting and are going to walk me straight into the military’s hands if we go with you. Or worse, you are looking for leverage against my brother because he isn’t cooperating anymore than I am.” Sam snarled.
A moment later, Charlie shifted back into her human form and Dean sighed in relief. He quickly wrapped her up in a blanket and cradled her to his chest. Now all they had to do was escape while the whole base was awake and on alert.
Lucifer would die, Dean promised himself, after they got some answers.
“You never told me that this Pack had more than one universal donor.” Cas quirked an eyebrow at him.
“Now Castiel, surely we do not need weapons amongst ourselves?” Lucifer gestured to the rifle held loosely in Cas’s other arm.
Dean tried to check the window first, but whoever was at the door stood in a shadowed spot that he couldn’t get a clear view of. He’d been surprised one too many times to put his eye up to the peephole. Instead, he flung the door open, gun raised.
“They took out Lafitte first,
“I hadn’t thought about it that way, I…” Cas stammered. “I thought I was sent because I was father’s only disposable legitimate child. Someone they could show as the Novak family supporting the military without actually sending someone they needed.”
Please hit that kudos if you liked it and let me know your thoughts in the comments below!
Cas, for his part, blushed and then shook his head.
John’s face morphed from irritation to surprise before moving back to determination. “For his own safety, and yours.”
“No! If he finds out I’m connected in some way, I’ll never see the light of day again! This place is already enough of a prison.” Dean sat down heavily on his bunk. “I can’t, Red…”
“You fucking lying dirty mutt!” Ketch sputtered after him.
of his weapons please?” Cas asked.
“Yeah, Dean. I’m good. How’s Dad treating you?” Sam had been extremely upset when he’d learned their father was now Dean’s commanding officer. But Dean had assured him that the bastard hadn’t treated him any differently than he would any Were, which granted, wasn’t very good, but it also wasn’t any worse either. Dean was a tool to be used, not a threat to be killed. It wasn’t much, but it was something.
“Weres have existed just as long as Humans have, we’ve lived side by side since the beginning. Just because your species wasn’t ready to handle the news of mine doesn’t mean we’re unnatural.”
Cas wrapped his arms around Dean, soft and pliant, and Dean hugged him back desperately, nuzzling his face into Cas’s neck, breathing in their forest of apple trees after the rain scent.
“Got it in one.”
Hours later they finally had a moment’s peace from both of their systems and were separated long enough for Dean to stumble over to the entrance of the cave where food and water had magically appeared. It was telling that neither of them had noticed whoever had left it. He brought the food back to the nest of blankets and pillows where Cas now dozed. As much as he wanted to let Cas sleep, he knew that they had to take this opportunity to rehydrate and refuel. Dean brushed his fingers through Cas’s hair and placed a kiss on his forehead. He really enjoyed just how quickly Cas’s hair was growing, and couldn’t wait to see it long and full and wild.
“Well—yes!” Gadreel said, confused. “I mean, alternatively, you could just spend the rest of your lives under house arrest instead? Those guys outside seem more like the enforcers than I do, don’t they?”
CMO Bevell pulled at Dean’s hand around her throat but could not move it. Her eyes were wild with terror.
“...blanket!” Cas snarled at someone outside of Dean’s field of vision, and moments later Dean was covered with a rough military blanket that did nothing to help his temperature but did hide him from the eyes of everyone else in the room.
anytime soon, if ever. In his experience, Weres only got shipped home in body bags. “Why don’t you have her join our next Skype call instead? That way I’d still get to meet her.”
“Is that enough? Is Dean okay?” Sam asked.
“That’s Miss Talbot to you, Corporal Winchester.”
Castiel growled low in his chest but didn’t look away from Dean. “Not now, Gabriel.”
“Still not convinced your side is the right one either, Gabriel,” Cas replied, “and as much as I still hate Naomi, I can’t hate her for putting me in the military. Despite my probable sterilization.” Cas was unable to continue for a moment, taking a deep breath before he continued, “It’s been one of the only times in my life that I felt free from family obligations, plus, it brought me Dean.” Cas smiled at Dean again, and Dean felt his heart flutter.
“Ah, yes. What a Packmaster that Lucifer is, always looking out for everyone’s families. He’s promised to
“You asshole!” Dean whispered fiercely against the neck his face was now buried in. Cas arms went around him in return, tentatively, as if he was unsure what Dean’s intentions were.
“Cas nnnnhhhhhgg…” Dean muttered incoherently for a moment before turning his gold, lust-blown eyes on Cas. “Fuck no. Don’t want toys. Want you.”
Dean felt the room spin. Sterilization shots? He was sterile? He’d have no kids? Ever?
. I’d call it a long time coming,” Dean snarled, showing his teeth.
“Drive,” Cas ordered. And John drove, Ketch waved to the guard on the way by. Then they were outside the walls, without killing anyone, and not followed by a riot of gunfire.
She ignored him and commanded, “Ash!”
“I can do things naturally you need machines for.” Dean shrugged. “You know? Like seeing in the dark, getting from point A to B.” He finally looked up with a smirk. “Being a soldier.”
They took off barefoot toward the now decimated building. With any luck, this search and recover would yield them the bad guy. The two Weres would have been evenly matched had Dean’s balance not still been fucked by his damaged eardrum, but as it was, the other Were easily outpaced him and led the way through the rubble. Dean scowled but followed behind Novak as quickly and as quietly as he could. They came to a halt when they reached the pile of rubble that had previously housed the enemy.
“But—”
“Jerk. From what I can piece together, there was a major shift within the main family, with many members disappearing from public view.”
“That just about covers it, yes,” Cas growled.
Once they had put some distance between them and the main cavern, Dean had taken point and Jo had moved to rearguard. They nodded to each other silently, Dean pressing a grateful hand to her shoulder as she passed.
“Lilith has seen the worst of humanity and of Were society. She’s prickly for good reason,” Gabriel said, gesturing them to one of the side tunnels. Dean had counted no less than five offshoot tunnels as they walked through the main basin. The size of this cavern alone made his head spin, and if the tunnels all ended in similar structures, it would be a cave system of unprecedented size. If it was as big as he feared it was, then how had the military
“Stop!” Dean barked out as Lilith moved to follow the other wolf back towards the battle. There was something wrong, very wrong with this. Dean closed his eyes and took a deep scenting breath. Blood, fear, gunpowder, death, the mixed up scents of dozens of wolves and men, none of whom he could pick out individually. But no Charlie, no Gabriel and definitely no Cas. All eyes turned to him and he pointed to the tunnel to his right.
Dean buried his face in Cas’s neck again, holding him tightly as Cas clung back, breathing in each other’s scents and letting it comfort them despite the smell of grief that lay over them like a blanket.
“You want to leave right now,” Dean growled, finally making eye contact with Captain Ketch and his group of marines. He bared his teeth and his eyes flashed gold.
Charlie immediately threw herself down on her bunk and grabbed one of her beloved Lumberjanes comics to read.
“I know. But we need his help to reach Sam and Eileen in time,” Cas reasoned.
Dean felt completely surrounded and filled in a way that no lover or toy had ever managed, a satisfaction that no one or thing had ever been able to provide. To feel Cas grow and stretch his insides had him keening into a pillow. Cas’s teeth worried the skin around Dean’s scent gland, nipping and kissing the spot but never breaking the skin.
Dean nodded. “Lucifer is shady as shit. That will be step three. Without harming the innocent people here.”
“The breakthrough to what?” Castiel asked.
“Before Babylon, I wouldn’t have thought so. But now?” Cas shrugged.
John Winchester stood motionless for a moment taking in the scene before him.
Cas beamed at him.
“I have his scent now. I can track him,” Dean had replied as calmly as he could while wanting to tear his own father’s face off. He wasn’t just a tool. He was a person. John’s son, in fact.
Dean glanced back at his Mate and held out his hand. Cas quickly moved up the drive and took Dean’s hand in his. Just like the first time they had held hands, a zing travelled through Dean’s system at the touch. It made Dean feel loved and safe and wanted all at once, and he didn’t know how he could ever live without that feeling, or without Cas. He didn’t know how he could survive without their combined orchard of apple trees after the rain scent filling his senses. The complexity of which served to calm and excite him every time he breathed it in.
Dean did believe him. Novak’s interactions seemed real and raw. Unless he was the best actor Dean had ever met. “What did he mean when Gabriel said ‘when you’re feeling more like yourself’?”
“You’re bluffing.”
The base alarm sounded. Dean and Cas straightened, looking at the door. Had their presence been noticed? Why wasn’t anyone storming the aid station? Were they waiting outside? But why sound the alarm and spring the trap early? They waited a few heartbeats as the sounds of men running and shouting filled the air. Cas moved back over to Dean and placed the vials he had stolen in the backpack before holding up what Dean assumed was the Doctor’s standard-issue M4 Carbine Assault Rifle.
Dean ran after the group, his Pack. He needed to find them and reunite with Charlie and with Cas.
“But—” Home-Cooked started.
“Jo? You good?”
Sometimes Dean wondered what would happen when they all went back State-side. Would the packs created over here survive? Would they disintegrate as a fleeting necessity or create an age of mergers their species hadn’t seen in a long time?
“Zepp! We’re under attack!”
“Like I can fucking trust you. It hasn’t even been twenty minutes since you were on the other fucking side!”
Dean’s voice rose into the night, a howl of grief echoing across the canyon. A moment later, Charlie’s voice joined his.
“CMO Bevell, we’re going to nee—”
“So…this Naomi chick?” Dean prompted, waving his hand at the others. He saw Ash go back to studying his brother while Sam ignored him in favour of paying attention to the conversation. Eileen was also focused, which just left Bela and Charlie, the former looking as if she was memorizing the conversation to be used as a weapon later, and the latter still busy searching one of the computers near the back of the cave while everyone else was preoccupied.
Gabriel huffed impatiently. “We both know that’s never going to happen.”
He knew Dean’s call sign, but it was the first time he’d ever heard it used. And so obviously with love. Sam smiled at the Packmate he had known for years but had only just met in person for the first time less than twenty-four hours ago. “Are you sure he wouldn’t be madder about us splitting up?"
“You’re goddamn right you’re sorry!” she huffed, crossing her arms across her chest.
“Agreed.”
Garth looked away, blushing. “Oh shove off, Jo. Sorry, Corporal Winchester.”
“Love you too,” Cas smiled back at him, strong and sure and happy. How had Dean gotten so lucky to find his Mate in Cas? This man not only indulged him a road trip across the country away from their Pack, but then also encouraged him instead of being impatient or irritated by his last-minute-waffling.
Once he was out of earshot Dean hissed at Gabriel who had continued leading down the passageway in the other direction. “Who the fuck was that?”
Dean was fairly certain he’d never seen anything hotter in his life.
The last thing Dean saw before the world went black was Lucifer’s grin. His foul scent followed Dean into the darkness.
“We can’t trust Lucifer,” Dean insisted, “there are too many things that don’t add up.”
“Do you think that will be necessary?” Cas continued, frowning.
“The way everything came together was really messy, actually,” Eileen continued.
“No, they just fear what they don’t understand,” Charlie said sitting on top of a large pile of supplies at the side.
“Thanks, Sam.”
“You have no idea,” Novak muttered.
Gabriel and Hannah turned and fled down the tunnel and out of sight.
Her eyes softened, even as she grinned somewhat mischievously. “It was my pleasure.”
“Fuck off! Those are men up there! Doesn’t matter what kind,” Dean shouted back.
“Atta boy, Sammy!” Dean grinned and clapped his brother on the shoulder, adding, “Congratulations, man,” before he turned to address the woman. “It’s very nice to finally meet you, Eileen.”
“I’m going to need a bit more context…I know your dad had a bunch of kids with different people but why is Naomi worse?” Dean cut in.
“Is she, though?” Cas sighed.
Sam smiled. “Likewise!”
“Joy.”
“How noble,” Gabriel drolled. “I hear he barely winced when I left. Ah well.”
“Did you really mean for us to...uh…” Dean gestured to the room they had just left.
Cas’s scent brought them to a large open garage with humvees, motorcycles, bicycles, and in a surprising turn of events, a Blackhawk helicopter. Dean had known that Lucifer was well connected, but this was on an entirely different level. Bikes, motorcycles and even humvees you could steal, but Blackhawks? They didn’t just go missing without anyone noticing. Had Lucifer even stolen it? Maybe he’d traded for it or it had been given as a gift by another traitor within the military? It would have to be someone fairly high up to make that happen.
“Just stay here and don’t say anything if anyone comes to talk with you, alright?” Dean said, glaring at John. “We’ll work something out.”
“I’ll grab some of the drugs they were giving us as proof,” Cas said and excused himself to the other side of the room.
“Fuck off, Bela,” Sam growled, grateful that his Mate missed the Beta’s comment. Eileen must have felt the vibration of his growl, and sat up slightly to look at him before she turned her attention to Bela’s scowling face. Eileen dismissed Bela with a glance and laid her head back on Sam’s shoulder.
The shooter was taking the occasional pot-shot at the doorway but was in the wrong position to actually hit them. “ETA?” Dean asked, his own voice still sounding distant to his ears.
“But can’t you stop it? Isn’t that what those drugs did before?” Sam argued at the same time as Charlie said, “But what about the Therianterine?”
Dean stepped forward threateningly, but Charlie pushed past him.
Dean snagged another beer from the fridge and made his way out to Jody’s back yard, taking a seat in one of her many mismatched deck chairs. He sipped in silence for a long time, looking at the sky before the words began tumbling out of him unprompted.
“I feel fine…if a little tired.” Sam said as he tried to stand up, only to find that his legs were wobbly and that his grip on Eileen was the only thing keeping him from falling on his face.
“Yeah, Fangs. Don’t get dead,” Charlie chirped.
“How many people in this army of yours know the real plan? Will they still stand beside you when they know the truth?” Sam asked loudly. Dean felt a rush of gratitude and affection for his brother. They’d always been on the same wavelength.
the stir!” Gabriel said gleefully. “I can only imagine his reaction when he finds out about Dean.”
“Charlie!” Dean shouted in despair. They should have just left. Why couldn’t they just have left? They never should have split up in the first place.
“Yeah, because Novak pulled your ass from the fire,” Charlie snarked.
“I have to go now, but be nice to Hannah when she brings you food and water, okay?” Gabriel said with a smile. “We’ll talk again when you’re feeling more like yourself, alright?”
Dean ran, knowing that his nose would not lead him astray. He’d acclimatized, and Babylon no longer overwhelmed his senses so much that he couldn’t pick out a single scent from the pack. His mental scent map was covered with Weres and Humans alike, but instead of the indistinguishable mass it had been before, now it was a bunch of individual dots and scent trails.
“You’ll just take me to the military where I’ll be locked up,” Gabriel argued.
“What use are you, if you can’t even sniff out your own kind?” John had scoffed.
“Rudeness?” Dean laughed. “You ain't seen nothing yet. And don’t think things are going to get better now that my good-for-nothing asshole father is here. He’d rather blind himself than give a Were a helping hand, especially if that Were is one of his sons.”
Dean was up off his bunk in a heartbeat, snarling.
Cas hesitated a moment longer before he nodded and started to remove his clothing. Finally. Dean stared hungrily at Cas, drinking him in from his hair to his broad shoulders, to the impressive erection—already hard and straining, curling up towards his toned stomach—on to his strong and capable thighs, to his feet that were attractive in their own right. That couldn’t be right. Weres did not have pretty feet. They were always rough and calloused with use, and so were Cas’s, and yet... Everything about him was irresistible. Cas lay down beside him, his hands wandering gently over Dean’s overheated skin, and kissed him softly.
Eileen smiled at him, her eyes crinkling at the corners. “Yes. That sounds good.”
“Nope. Man-whore. Man-whore is definitely the word I was looking for,” Gabriel snarked.
“You have a funny way of showing it,” Dean griped.
Dean turned and passed the sponge to Cas, thinking that he wanted to go first, but was shocked when Cas dragged the luke-warm sponge across Dean’s chest.
“Which way do we go, boss-man?” Charlie asked, her eyes tracking various groups. “Do we follow the soldiers out to the battle or the people with the kids to a potential bolt hole?”
“Dean, she’s alive but unconscious.” Cas’s voice came from behind him. “Looks like they are keeping her sedated.”
It was a day that would forever be known as the Divulgence, or 'Dive’ for short.
The first time he’d met Charlie it was in a different Mess, in a different camp, but still in this same pitiful excuse for a country. He’d arrived on base only twenty minutes prior, had reported to his CO who had looked down his nose at Dean and told him to stay out of sight until he was useful. Told him that he was an asset only, and not a proper marine.
“Do you really think that excuse is going to work every time you use it, Winchester?” Lilith laughed. “It wasn’t particularly effective last time, was it?” She pointed at a barely conscious John draped like a ragdoll across Sam’s back. Sam bared his teeth at her.
Lilith didn’t even blink at him, just sent him a toothy grin. He was instantly reminded of how she had crushed Ketch’s skull between her teeth without hesitation and a smile on her face.
The universe was a capricious bitch. Last week Dean
Dean slowed as they got closer, eventually coming to a stop behind some dense brush. The base shone like a beacon in the night, giant searchlights scanning the wilderness like a methodical bird of prey. Their earlier howling had, unfortunately, put the base on high alert. It would be one thing to get in, it would be entirely another to get back out again. Especially since they didn’t know what to expect when it came to Charlie. Was she chained up? Confined? Too injured to move? Was she even still on base? What if they had transferred her the moment Dean had gone missing? Dean suppressed a growl and shook his head, trying to rid himself of the thought. Cas rubbed his head against Dean’s in support.
“Hardly! Father only had children so he could use us as bargaining chips and pawns in his lust for power!”
“What about Dad?” Sam asked. “We can’t leave him.”
“No. She’s not,” Gabriel said solemnly. “I swear it.”
Dean raised his assault rifle and placed himself between the group and Lilith; the front line growing ever closer at her back. “Everyone go!” he commanded, and he felt more than saw them complying, heading down the path he had pointed to.
“Yeah, yeah, yuck it up, Mister cottage by the sea,” Dean snarked back, but he couldn’t help the grin that spread across his face. Relief coursed through his veins as Cas extended a hand to Sam and Sam immediately shook it.
Lucifer stared at him a long time before he flicked his wrist and five wolves turned and headed for the military base. Now it was eleven on three. Much better odds, but the implication was clear. Lucifer could let John go back to the base, to be slaughtered with his men, or Dean could choose to save him and bring him back to Babylon. Either way, the base was going to fall.
Once inside, he found Novak laying another man down against a wall. He looked up when Dean entered and a look of determination crossed his face. Novak moved into Dean’s personal space so fast Dean almost dropped the marine he had saved. Instead, he placed the soldier down gently and turned to the other Were. Novak said something to him and shook his head before pointing to Dean’s shoulder.
The men’s heads swivelled back to Dean’s father, who was shaking with rage. Dean never looked away. If he was going to talk about abandoning his own children as a mark of morality, Dean wasn’t going to protect him from men who despised nepotism and not earning your rank through hard work and dedication. These weren’t just regular servicemen, these were marines. Dean quietly hoped they’d eat John alive.
Dean thought he heard John say something foul, but he was too wrapped up in Cas to care.
“Thank you,” Dean nodded and felt Cas shift back into his wolf form beside him. He ran his fingers through Cas’s thick black fur and felt comforted. Whole. Strong. A moment later he had shifted into his wolf form, and with one last look at Hendrickson and his men, the two of them turned and loped out of the hanger and into the wilderness to join the rest of the Pack.
“...stop it? Isn’t...”
“Don’t be a prude, Castiel. We provided food, water,” Lucifer glanced up briefly, “and new clothes. Do you think that all appeared by magic? Or that we have an unlimited supply of these items?”
“We have no choice!”
Despite that, they followed Lilith through the labyrinth of passageways, growing ever closer to the noise of gunfire and the stink of Humans. Underneath all of that, Dean could just make out a whiff of apple trees after the rain. At least it was growing stronger and stronger as they moved through the caves, proving that Lilith wasn’t leading them on a wild goose chase. She had, however, started taking more and more twists and turns through the tunnels, until Dean was sure he would find it difficult to make his way back to the main cavern. As long as the path she took contained Cas’s scent, Dean wasn’t going to question it. Gabriel’s scent also grew stronger, but it didn’t pull at him in quite the same way.
“You heard Cas, people, let’s move!” Dean stated, and tore off the blanket still draped across his shoulders. Ash squawked as the blanket hit him.
“Sounds like fucking stalking to me.”
“Zeppelin. Scent confirmed at entrance twenty degrees northwest of main target. Over.” Angel’s voice came over the comms.
“It’s not okay!” Sam growled. “We could sue for this!”
At least everyone seemed to be giving them a wide berth, no one trying to stop or stall them. Realistically, it probably had more to do with the imminent battle rather than their dramatic increase in fire power. Escaping prisoners really didn’t rate high on anyone’s to-do list with the military banging at the door.
“Order in.”
Cas and Gabriel’s scents were faint by the time they arrived back at the meeting point. The shifting dust and rubble from the bombardment hadn’t helped, and neither had the near-constant flow of Weres running back and forth through the area. Dean realized that despite never having known Charlie’s scent, her lack of one now was really starting to bother him. If something went wrong and she got separated from Cas, there would be no way for him to know or to find her. It made him feel ill.
“I wanted us to be sure...And not just…” Cas flushed.
—Pack in danger just to satisfy Father’s rules.”
“Time to get out,” Dean announced. John made eye contact with him in the mirror, his eyes wide as if Dean had just told him to blow himself up.
“Who are you, again?”
“Soon. I…want you to meet her first. Bring her into the Pack.”
“Alternatively, you could walk us out the front gates, and we can tell the pack outside to stand down, and then everyone lives,” Cas continued as if the other man had never spoken. “It would only take a handful of them to slaughter everyone here. The forward base, for example, had an entire squad of men with assault rifles and it took just
“Are you planning on letting me starve?” John said, disdain dripping from every word.
Dean smiled at her, relieved. “Glad to hear it, Red, cause he’s staying.”
Novak was gesturing to him from the doorway of the house they had commandeered.
“Is Charlie Bradbury here?”
“Oh, but Dean, I
“Finally something we agree on, Gabriel.”
“I must admit some of his tactics have been less than...optimal. And I am truly sorry for your loss. But we are freeing Weres from their military prisons and from the old world order to form a new free society! And no transition of power has ever happened without a little bit of bloodshed!” Gabriel said passionately.
“The enemy is not supposed to have werewolves. How the fuck did he get past your...pal?” John had asked gruffly.
“He is my True Mate, Sam,” Dean said softly, hoping Sam would get it, hoping that he would support Dean in this. He didn’t know what he would do if Sam refused to accept Cas. He couldn’t bear to lose either of them.
“What about them?”
It was exactly what Dean needed. What his body had been craving. What he wanted. Dean sighed in relief as his fever abated for the moment. It wouldn’t be too long before it ramped up again, so he did his best to enjoy the moment of peace and the feeling of Cas filling him completely. Cas gently moved them into a more comfortable position in the blankets, kissing the back of Dean’s neck again gently. Satisfied, Dean relaxed fully, luxuriating in the feeling of being held. It wasn’t just the cuddling, and it wasn’t just the sex, although both were awesome. He squeezed his inner walls and wiggled slightly, which caused Cas to moan and swat him for being a brat. Dean grinned to himself. Somehow, it was more. More than he ever thought possible, more than he ever thought he deserved. And if he and Cas were really on the same page here then maybe he’d get to have this for more than just his heat. For more than just this moment. Everything in his life was so fucked up, but maybe he could have this for himself. Maybe he could keep Cas. His one reward for a long life of shit days. Dean felt his face flush with the thought, and was suddenly glad Cas couldn’t see his face.
“Same. I’m glad you’re here with me…I mean not
Cas rolled his eyes but continued as if Gabriel hadn’t interrupted. “She will do whatever it takes to keep her children on top, even if it means crushing Father’s other legitimate children like Gabriel here. Gabriel, Hannah and Anna are children of Father’s mistress, Rebecca, or the 'surrogate' to the public. Very on the up and up, as it were.”
“Humvee,” Charlie mumbled.
Dean looked over at the main entrance they had outlined in the plans earlier—a natural cave opening with no signs of human or Were use. He took a deep breath in and could only pick up the scents of the wilderness around him. Clean scents of dirt, grass and trees as well as those of small mammals like mice and rabbits. Normal, wholesome scents. He would have to get closer. “Cannot confirm scent from main entrance. Over.”
> Dean nodded and they let off a few more rounds before stepping back into the house. Ten seconds later a second explosion rocked the square. Charlie’s backup had arrived.
John stood silently for a moment longer. “Live.”
“They’re not all bad, you know. The Novaks have their problems, like any other pack, I suppose.” Cas continued, staring off into the middle distance.
“You made the best choice you could,” Cas argued, the three of them standing in the alcove in front of the bars.
“Target scent confirmed at side entrance, three point eight miles northeast of primary target. Potential civvies, multiple Weres confirmed. Main entrance unconfirmed. Over.”
He saw Gabriel standing with Hannah off to the side, both of them watching the carnage around them in horror. They were not helping, but they weren’t hurting his Pack either, so Dean refocused on the remaining attacking wolves who were slowly but surely being overpowered. His Pack worked as a team, protecting each other and overwhelming their enemies. They moved as if they had been fighting beside each other for years instead of the minutes it had been. They were smart, strong and capable. They didn’t need him, and he couldn’t have been more proud.
The Chief Medical Officer, Battalion Surgeon Antonia Bevell, nodded absentmindedly, her eyes never leaving her charts. “What about Novak?”
“Where is Dean Winchester?”
“That’s better.” Dean smiled, but his eye roll ruined the effect.
“I disagree,” Gabriel said. “He’s followed through on everything else he’s promised. There’s no reason for me to think he won’t keep his word on this.”
Dean touched their foreheads together briefly, taking strength in their bond. He took a deep breath of their calming orchard of apple trees after the rain scent before stepping back and heading up the path to the front door. He hesitated only briefly before he rapped his knuckles against the door and waited.
“What’s so funny?” Charlie asked around a mouthful of food.
“Dean,” Cas said with a choked sound, his eyes golden despite his concern. “We need to get you out of here. Right. Now.”
“You do care. Because of Sam,” Charlie said quietly, taking the wind out of his sails. “You’re lucky you weren’t even reprimanded!”
“Captain, I will remind you that I am your Commanding Officer. And as such, I think you would like to spend the next four hours demolishing that mound of rocks we have sitting thirty yards east of the camp with a pickaxe. Don’t you agree?”
trust me.”
“No. I came to tell you that I survived despite you, not because of you. And to introduce you to my Mate, Eileen.” Sam turned from his father’s face to Eileen’s who was looking back at him with love and support.
“Yeah, yeah. Get going, you.” Dean swatted his finger away. “It’s my job to worry.”
Their combined scents were now making him horny too. He hadn’t been properly horny in years, and it had to happen here, in a cave, as a prisoner, with Castiel. And to top it all off, any moment now Castiel would know it too.
“Never you mind. I have it under control,” John growled. “Have them open the gates, I’m going out to negotiate for our lives.” Ketch stared at them for a moment longer before he took a step back outside of Dean’s field of vision. Dean could hear him clearly enough as he radioed up to the guard and the on-site combat controller. “The Major is going out to negotiate. I’m going with him.”
“We’d love to come inside. Thanks.” Dean smiled and followed her into the house.
One of Cas’s eyes opened, blurry and searching before finding Dean sitting beside him holding out a bottle. His eye closed again for a moment before he groaned and sat up. Dean was immediately relieved to see Cas’s eyes were back to their stunning blue colour as he took the offered bottle and drank it down before devouring the ration bar that Dean handed to him next.
“What happened?” Eileen demanded.
“I said. You can’t sit here,” Ketch continued, looking straight at Dean. Everyone at the table tensed. Charlie may have replied to them, but everyone on base knew that Dean was the leader here. Dean went back to eating. Benny and Charlie glanced at him before resuming their meals as well.
“You’re going to threaten your own family to get me to move, Gabriel? That’s low, even for Lucifer.”
Dean pulled back to gaze at his Mate.
“Meeting you is the best thing that has ever happened to me,” Castiel said simply. Dean looked up in shock.
Dean thought of Charlie, perhaps she was injured and lost in the wild, or maybe she was already back on base preparing for a rescue, or more likely a counter-attack, either way, she was alone for the first time in years, and it was Dean’s fault. He never should have agreed to split up. Then he thought of Sam and Eileen at home, no safer than he was now, under the thumb of the military, hostages in their own lives just to keep Dean in line. All at once a wave of rage flowed through him, only to crash on the cliffs of defeat knowing he could not help them anymore than he could help himself. “You leave Charlie and Sam out of this!” he snarled.
Bela, who had been doing her best to blend in with the scenery rather than get involved in pack dynamics, snarled, “Where did you learn that term?”
“Don’t know why I’m even looking at the sky. S’not like you’re there. In Heaven, I mean. With however many Dicks with Wings are even still up there. Maybe Jack will smack some sense into them. Or I guess make more less-douchey versions of your siblings?
“Hardly, Alistair. They are guests, on their way to visit Lucifer right now,” Gabriel replied in a much less charming tone than he’d been using with Dean or Cas.
Lucifer shifted as he fell and was on Cas the instant they landed. Then they were a blur of white and black and red.
“So not at all then, as Cas is part of my Pack now,” Dean said at the same time Cas responded.
“Or go for my morning run?”
“Noted. So what do I need to know? Other than Jackass one and Jackass two are driving us out of the base and,” she took a deep scenting breath. “Shit! You and Novak mated?! How many years was I out for?” Damn, you guys smell good.” She pulled a t-shirt out of the bag and slipped it on.
“And where do Humans fit into this society?” Sam asked.
It went on like that for days, with Sam and Eileen watching the men in the car watching them.
“That’s…” Cas’s eyes were wide, and he turned to his brother beseechingly. "Tell me that’s not true!”
A sharp movement caught his eye, and Dean turned his head delicately, trying not to puke while tracking the movement. Novak. The other Were was already up and about, despite what looked like a head wound that would have killed a normal person. He was tying a tourniquet around one of the men’s arms that no longer ended in a hand. Novak looked up at Dean and said something Dean still couldn’t hear.
The CO turned and walked away, just as the weight of the tires finally snapped the metal rod of the bench press and the whole thing collapsed to the ground.
“I’ve only just begun,” Ash replied, not looking away from Sam.
Dean nodded. “I agree. There are multiple targets. And a reason why I was drawn away from the blast zone.”
“They create a scentless environment where we are free from our designations and can be more effective soldiers,” Cas recited.
“That asshole isn’t worth the air he’s breathing!” Dean snarled.
Cas huffed a laugh. “True enough.”
“Just thinking up nicknames for our escorts. Harry and Lloyd are in the running.”
At first, Dean thought the caves were getting stuffier as they walked, but after catching Cas’s concerned glances a couple of times, he realized he was the only one whose temperature was going up. They pressed on—Dean wasn’t going to let a little fever get in the way of their mission. Never mind that it had been years since he’d been sick. At one point, Dean stopped them so he could drink out of the underground river. It was clear and cool and fresh and yet didn’t seem to quench his thirst. And seeing Cas bent over drinking out of the stream only seemed to make it worse.
Dean stood there, stunned. “What?”
Dean laughed. “Okay, Charlie, okay.”
“Of course,” Lucifer replied to Bela, before he continued, this time speaking to the Pack. “I can still see you. What do you think you could possibly accomplish?”
,” Cas said without looking away from Dean. “We’ll be right around the corner,” Cas said to Dean, giving him a small smile before leading Charlie away.
He had just turned another corner down a different tunnel, when a bullet ripped through his abdomen and into the wall beside him. He didn’t stop or slow down, just pressed his hand to the wound, grit his teeth, and kept moving. He hadn’t seen who shot him. It could have been a stray bullet from the firefight, or it could have been a direct attack.
What a trip.
Whatever Dean had pictured when the tunnel finally opened up into the large cavern, it was not the organized bustle of hundreds of Weres going about their business. There were groups cooking and eating, groups doing laundry in an underground stream that curled around the space, there were people chatting, even a group that seemed to be babysitting or teaching a group of children. It was like nothing he had ever seen. It was like nothing he had ever smelt. It was a society made up solely of Weres. Granted, it was a society living in a monstrous cave in the wilderness, but a society nonetheless. The old and young were present, but the vast majority of this pack appeared to be made up of strong adults in their prime. And just like their guards, most of these Weres held themselves with the confidence of military training. These were his peers—dog tags or no. Members of the armed forces that had gone AWOL. Dean felt the world drop out from under him. Captain Ketch had been right. This wasn’t a random Were society, it was a military base, an army. An army large enough that they could have easily taken out his entire base using only a fraction of its members.
“I copy, Zeppelin. Over.” Ketch’s nasal voice echoed through the comm.
Castiel looked back and forth between them, started to say something and then stopped, grabbed his bag and walked out the door without looking back. Charlie slammed it closed behind him.
Dean hadn’t bothered to learn their names yet. He thought he remembered Gabriel calling the male by name, but for the life of him, he couldn’t remember what it was. The female for sure hadn’t been named, in fact, he wasn’t sure she’d said anything to them at all. She definitely looked more capable and hardy than her counterpart, who appeared as if he could be taken down by a strong breeze. But Dean had already learned that lesson about judging a Were’s strength by their outward appearance the hard way from Charlie. She had been quite insistent and thorough about that particular point, and he wasn’t about to forget it. Either way, the assault rifles they both carried were more than enough to get the job done.
. He is not yours to kill.” Dean stepped forward, letting go of Cas’s hand. The surrounding wolves watched him unblinkingly.
“Sorry everyone,” Dean apologized. “The point is, we are not responsible for other people’s choices and we can’t change what’s already happened. We can only stop it from continuing. Which is why we are here. Yes?”
“But did she know that she’d be sterilizing Castiel when she sent him to the military?” Sam asked.
His Pack smelled content, close to happy even, and one by one they dropped off to sleep until Dean couldn’t fight it either. They were warm, comfortable, as safe as they were going to get. It was all he could ask for. The other stuff could wait.
“Bitch.”
“Are you my Mate, or not Cas? Dean snarled. “I wanted this—you—before my heat started.”
danger if I can help it.”
“This could go badly if we are caught leaving by either side,” Dean said, pulling another rifle from the pile in Cas’s arms.
“Red’s got a point.” Dean frowned before his eyes went wide and he grinned. “We’ll get out the same way we did last time!”
The change had not gone unnoticed by the rest of the men either. One day they had been able to make derogatory comments in Novak’s direction, mess with his things and even slam into him in passing without fear of reprisals or even making eye contact with Dean, and the next Dean had all but torn out a man’s throat for dumping Novak’s tray on the ground in the Mess. The two Weres hadn’t even spoken to each other during the encounter, but after that, everyone understood that messing with Novak was messing with the Pack, even if he was still being shunned by them.
Cas nodded and waited for him to continue.
“Not really given the chance, are we?” Dean sneered back, baring his teeth.
“Everyone is free to come and go as they please,” Gabriel responded confidently.
“Yes,” Gabriel whispered. “Yes. It’s true.”
“And here Gabriel was saying there wasn’t even going to be a battle.” Cas rolled his eyes and gestured to all of the assault weapons being passed around. He grabbed a passing soldier, and relieved him of the armful of assault rifles he was carrying before dismissing him with a wave. The soldier started to complain but Dean’s Pack all bared their teeth at him, and he shrank back before continuing on his way.
“No buts. We stay out here any longer and the neighbours will call the cops on us for being creepers.”
“It’s fine, Sammy, I’ve—we’ve made peace with it.” Dean held out his hand for Cas, who took it.
Cas nodded and tapped John’s head again with the barrel of his gun. John opened his door and stepped out, Cas following quickly behind him. Dean followed Cas out his door and ushered Charlie to follow him instead of going out the other side. She shimmied into a pair of pants and then stepped outside with them.
Sam swore.
Seemingly oblivious to Dean’s pain, Gabriel continued, “Let me help Cassi—Castiel find our sister and then we can meet you back here so we can all leave together.”
“I—” His hand slid down to pull out the dog tags that he had worn for years. He unclasped the chain and carefully slid Benny’s dog tag off before closing the chain again, slipping his and Garth’s dog tags back under his shirt to rest against his skin.
John Winchester. I am in command of this base as of today. I expect your full and total cooperation going forward in order for us to accomplish our goal of hunting down the enemy.”
The day after that, Dean woke to the sounds of men hurrying about the base and knew that they would not get a second-day reprieve. He looked down at Charlie, still snuggled into his arms. They had fallen asleep wrapped up in each other and their mutual grief. Charlie was his family, his sister, his Pack and there wasn’t anything he would deny her if it was within his power to give. Holding her while she cried herself to sleep was just a small thing, but for them, in this moment, it was everything. It was against regulations, of course, to share a bunk even in innocence, but that was hardly ever enforced when it came to Weres. No matter how hated and misunderstood they were, getting involved with pack politics was something even the top brass tried to avoid.
Dean breathed deeply and pulled in the first scent of his kind in over four years. It was strong. Male. Alpha. And saturated with the smell of blood. But underneath that, it was ozone and lightning, like the air after a storm…one that had left the land charred, acrid with singed hair or burned rubber. It was a complicated scent; a cloying one. It was a scent that at once made him feel longing and disgust. A scent he would never forget.
“Dean,” Sam said sadly and Dean brushed him off.
Dean closed his eyes for a moment. He held no love for the bigotted marine, but his murder was a show of force. He clenched his hands into fists. He must not get angry and push his Pack into a confrontation they were ill-equipped to deal with. They may have been freed from their military cage and then from their prison within the caves, but they were just as much captives here outside the walls than they ever were within. Cas’s hand found his and Dean opened his eyes turning to read trust, love and acceptance in Cas’s eyes. Cas would follow Dean’s lead. Even if that was to their deaths. Dean turned and made eye contact with John. For the first time in his entire life, Dean could see fear in his father’s eyes.
“Yeah, it’ll be one great big family reunion with your monstrous children you sold into slavery and experimentation. We’ll even take selfies to send to the Campbells—it’s going to be a blast,” Dean snarled at John.
“Complicated how?” Novak pressed, finally pulling a body from the wreckage. A young man, no doubt eager to serve his community by killing the foreign invaders.
“That was Alistair,” Gabriel said, his lips pressed into a thin line. “He’s our Communications Expert.” He barked out a humourless laugh. The two guards fidgeted uneasily.
Dean laughed. “Good call, Red.”
Dean looked up at John and Cas. “Humvee it is. Lead the way, John.”
"And Eileen?”
“Oh but we are, Samshine!" Gabriel cut in. "That’s what we’re doing here at Babylon! What you’re doing right now in this lab! We are building a better future for all Weres!” Sam and Eileen both glared at Gabriel while everyone else didn’t even bother to look up.
“What exactly does he do here, Gabe?” Cas asked, wary evident in every word.
“Anyways gents, we good to go?” Ash continued snapping gloves on.
John continued outlining the plan for taking down the cave systems, but Dean didn’t hear most of it. He may have been facing forward, but his entire focus was now on his packmate Charlie, standing to his right. Outside of that night with Benny, she hadn’t properly been in the field in years. To her credit, Charlie hadn’t even flinched.
“Too much.” Dean sighed and pointed to the pale body at his feet “Lucifer is dead. His army disbanded.”
do the Novak thing.” Dean frowned. “I won’t put my Pack in danger by joining the Novak Pack—either of them.”
“Thanks, Sammy.”
“I’m so glad you’re okay,” she said with a sniffle.
“That was...Oh.” When was the last time he had received a shot? Dean raced through his memories. It was definitely after Novak had arrived, but not long after Benny’s death. The pain of that moment washed over him again and he took a couple of deep breaths. That was weeks ago now. How many? Enough. More than enough. They probably would have gotten another by now had they not been captured. Dean looked up into troubled blue eyes.
John bristled. “Nothing.”
“They’re promoting Weres to Major now?!” someone whispered loudly, while another murmured “I ain’t following no dog soldier!” The whispers became louder and more numerous until John spoke up again, his face red with embarrassment and anger.
“Can I help you boys with anything?” Sam asked, doing his best to look as casual as possible in his slippers and robe, holding his coffee cup in one hand, and knocking on the window of the car with the other,
They made their way quickly out into the yard and took their places slightly left of centre.  As they waited, more and more people joined the ranks until everyone was standing quietly under the already heated early-morning sun. The stench of sweating Humans was already thick around him and Dean fervently hoped that whatever was going on would wrap up quickly so that they could go back to their scentless and relative coolness of their bunk. All thoughts of going back to bed were crushed ruthlessly when Dean caught a whiff of someone he hadn’t seen or smelled in many years.
Ash finally gave up pestering Dean and Cas and placed two white plastic cups on the table beside them before he moved back to Sam, blood pressure cuff in hand.
“Shit,” he swore and squeezed Cas’s hand tighter. Of all the goddamn times and places.
“Maybe, maybe not,” Bela cut in over Gabriel’s protest. “But how will you know if you don’t help?”
The smile she gave him when she signed it back in return heated his insides and filled him with courage. Everything was going to be just fine. Dean wasn’t John. Dean would accept anyone Sam loved because he wanted Sam to be happy. His brother was a good person and a good Packmaster.
You can also chat with me on
Dean hesitated for only a moment. The lives of the men depended on them working together. There wasn’t time for anger right now. He nodded. Novak touched his arm, mouthed sorry and then gripped it tight and popped Dean’s shoulder back into place with a twist of his bare hands. Dean bit back a snarl of pain and breathed deeply before nodding in thanks. Novak nodded back before heading outside to get the next guy.
“She’s a real piece of work. I don’t envy you, man,” Dean commented as Ash wrapped a blood pressure monitor to his other arm and began to inflate it.
“Until we get out of this mess, you will obey
“I’m here,” Cas whispered back, “and you’re not going anywhere.” Dean felt Cas lie down on the bed next to him and pull him tightly into his arms. Dean pressed his face into Cas’s neck, trying to focus on his calming scent and nothing else. That soothing mix of their orchard of apple trees after the rain overlayed with the Pack scent of whiskey and leather.
Dean fell into an exhausted sleep with Cas’s words of love in his ears.
“And?”
The guard blinked, his eyes going wide with surprise and then curiosity before he stepped back out of Dean’s space. It wasn’t the worst reaction Dean had ever seen, and it got him what he wanted. Dean turned back around and brushed his hands against Cas’s in thanks. His touch was getting addictive.
Less than ten minutes later Dean found the entrance that Novak was guarding. It was a normal cave from all appearances, but to Dean, it lit up like a beacon in the dark, the air thick with the smell of the pack. Dean took a deep breath. The amount of information was staggering. Young, old, men, women, Alphas, Betas and Omegas. More wolves than Dean had ever scented in one place in his entire life. His mental scent map was completely lit up, the number of scents so overwhelming that they had all merged into one large blob in his brain, making it nearly impossible for him to differentiate individuals.
Fight it was.
“Careful, Miss Talbot,” Cas said casually. “You’re going to give us the impression that you like us more than them.”
Dean didn’t know how much time had passed before he finally blinked and found his voice. “Who are you?”
He exited the barracks and headed for the Mess to grab Charlie on his way. He didn’t pause but he did call back over his shoulder to the Were sitting beside the shack.
“Let me,” Cas murmured.
“It was unusual you were able to hold off mating as long as you did,” Lucifer said without looking up from his papers on the table.
“Cas…”
Dean watched his Packmates head off down the pathway, and realized he was comforted knowing that they were going just outside of view instead of off to find food. He didn’t want to be separated from them ever again. That would go for Sam too when he got here. If he got here. Dean pushed that thought out of his mind. First things first—John.
Dean didn’t even have time to let that thought sink in before Donna pulled him into a crushing hug.
“Ah, I see Major John Winchester and Captain Arthur Ketch have joined us.” Lucifer strode past the Humans to stand face to face with Dean and Cas. John’s face went red as the Were went by without even glancing in his direction.
Dean took a step back. That level of denial only came with the true belief that what you were doing was the right thing. His father was brainwashed. “Safety from who?” Dean muttered and then glanced down the cavern towards his Pack. Would they ever be safe again? Were they ever truly safe in the first place? Safety was an illusion. And no matter what he did, he wouldn’t be able to change that, not for himself and not for them. The weight of that thought settled heavily onto his shoulders.
“Then who? Cas pressed and Gabriel looked to the side. A moment passed and then something flickered in Cas’s eyes.
“Well, Charlie and me go back four. She’s like a barnacle, can’t get rid of that girl. Best sister a guy could ask for.” Dean’s eyes came up to Castiel’s, this time full of threat. “You touch her and I’ll kill you.”
“We wait,” Sam said.
“He’s got you there, Boss-man,” Charlie grinned. “He’s gotten feisty since you’ve both been gone.”
. This was evil on an entirely different level than the pain of being sterilized against his will. Dean felt like he was going to be sick.
Dean was calling it a win.
Eileen nodded back.
“You mean why did I free you from slavery? Remove the toxins from your blood? Gift to you a free society of Weres? Honestly, Castiel, I remember you being smarter than this.”
Dean turned and ran towards Cas.
John took a seat on the floor. “You could leave me to die.”
“Same old same old.”
He’d found an empty table and was only five minutes into eating when the bubbly red-head had sat down across from him. At first, he didn’t react, kept eating to see if she would just go away, but no such luck.
Dean looked up from his fork to find Captain Ketch glaring at them from the other end of the table. The men the Captain was sitting with suddenly lost interest in their food, pushing their trays away. Bullshit is what it was, Marines ate well here. Dean glanced down at his tray filled with mostly red meat and then back at the soldiers’ food, which seemed to be filled with a lot more leafy greens, beans and bread. Well, at least Weres ate well here.
Dean used Cas’s presence to focus, and after a moment finally allowed himself to look around. He was in one of Ash’s hospital beds, his mate wrapped tightly around him and a blanket covering them. He couldn’t smell any of his Pack nearby but the two techs were here somewhere. “Where?”
Dean bit down on his own hand to keep from crying out.
“No, but we’re trying to make a synthetic compound using his blood. So that’s important,” Ash piped up, coming into Dean’s view, he pressed a machine into Dean’s ear, it beeped and Ash smiled. “Looks like you’re back to a normal temperature of 42.1 degrees. And what’s more—we’re fairly certain that it wasn’t a one-time cure! Bela and I think enough of the Therianterine is now out of your system that you shouldn’t go into withdrawal again—or rather—you probably won’t go into heat again the next time you and Cas decide to get frisky. Which is good, boiling your brain is definitely a mood killer, amirite?”
Dean reached for Benny and pulled him partially upright, leaning their heads together. Even in death, he had no other scent.
“Affirmative. Over.” Novak’s gravelly voice came over the coms. Dean ignored the shiver that went through his body. It was 105 degrees out, for fuck's sake.
“Exactly.”
Dean knew that Charlie kept sneaking glances at him, trying to figure out what had put him on edge, but there was no time to explain. John had reached the centre of the yard and stopped, waiting for everyone to salute. Everyone did. Except for Dean. The lack of movement drew John’s eye and he paled. Guess the bastard hadn’t read the manifest before he’d agreed to be in charge.
Sam had known about his minders for years, usually, they kept a discreet enough distance that they didn’t really interfere or bother him at all. The day after the missed phone call, however, they suddenly became a very noticeable, and very intrusive presence. A black sedan pulled up behind Sam’s Prius, blocking him in.
“You went into heat again. But this time with a fever that would have killed you had Sam not stepped in. We gave you a blood transfusion. You’re okay now.” Cas leaned in and kissed him softly. Dean leaned into it and sighed. He was okay. Wasn’t he?
“Yes. You will come along quietly I hope? Nothing untoward has to happen here, right?”
Charlie nodded and sat down across from him on her bunk. “I get that.”
They had only gone several yards before Dean felt the sensation of all his fur standing on end. Dean picked up his pace, moving faster and louder through the brush back towards the main target. Novak kept pace with him, a glance showing that he too knew that something wasn’t right. A movement out of the corner of his eye finally stopped Dean fast. He reached out to grab Novak who stilled beside him. The other Were nodded and they turned to face their enemy.
“Cas!” Dean shouted, dread filling his body, even as he trained his assault rifle on Hannah instead of Lucifer. Cas had his hands up defensively, his eyes filled with sorrow. Dean knew his Mate’s pain came from his sister holding him hostage rather than from his own life being in danger. Even Weres didn’t heal very well from gunshot wounds to the head.
That evening, Dean and Cas sat side by side as wolves, a couple of miles out from the base Dean had lived on since the Dive. After they had been poked, prodded, weighed and measured for the last couple of hours, they’d finally been released to go rescue Charlie. Being above ground with the smell of the wind, the grass and the trees made Dean want to howl with joy, chase Cas through the wilderness and make love under an open sky. The air wasn’t bad in the caves, but it couldn’t compare with this. This was the scent of freedom; a wild desert underneath a never-ending starry sky.
And Cas did.
“Save me your pity, little brother.” Gabriel sneered. “That future isn’t mine any longer. Nor is it Hannah’s. Or had you forgotten your sister?”
Ketch paled but didn’t argue.”Yes,
I get to like, Sammy? Hit me.”
Dean shared a look with Sam. They needed to get rid of Gabriel. Dean glanced at Charlie and Sam glanced at Eileen. Moments later the two women were engaging Gabriel in what seemed to be a lively conversation that slowly drew him away from the beds and closer to the door. Even though his Pack was newly formed in person, they already made a great team.
“What hole have you been living in? Don’t you get it?” Dean snarled.
“Hey,” Sam said.
