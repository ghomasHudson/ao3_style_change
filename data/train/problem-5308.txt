“So why the fuck is he the one with the shitty dad? Hm? Why him? It’s not enough that he was in a car accident and may die unless he gets that transplant? It’s not enough that he lost a fucking arm, but he has to have an asshole for a father, too?” Tony took his hand back and didn’t try to stop it from clenching this time no matter how much it ached. “You tell me you could have stood by and done nothing. You tell me you could have just walked away.”
Tony kissed him, most likely just to get him to shut up. He knew he wasn’t making this any easier on Tony, but he couldn't bring himself to stop. He couldn’t stop begging, pleading for Tony to stay, to think of another way. So he put everything he had into his kiss, showing Tony what he had to stay for, what he had to live for, and beg for him to believe that it was enough.
“I know Orion’s belt but…” He left the rest of that sentence hanging, feeling the strokes of Tony’s fingers shift to start forming a new design, sparking a thought that maybe Tony was tracing the constellation designs from memory.
Four weeks earlier, the Avengers had been basking in a blissful evening off from heroism and were enjoying the cool evening breeze when Rhodey just had to open his big mouth and reveal to Steve exactly why Tony had a tendency to migrate indoors whenever he found himself outside, though only under the cover of night.
Steve was standing in the doorway to their bedroom in a pair of sweats with a towel around his shoulders. “You’re back.”
Nonetheless, he took a breath and bit his lip as he nodded resolutely. Then remembered that Tony couldn’t see it. “Yes. We’re here.”
“I have in the past. A woman with dark hair had caught my eyes, and I had to stand and watch her in the arms of another. I watched her age and I was there when she died,” Steve said, keeping a strong face.
What he saw made him gasp out loud; the between his hands pressed on the man’s shoulder blades there was a small pair of light red, pink almost, wings. They didn’t resemble the wings of a bird in the slightest, they looked like the wings of a...fairy? They were fluttering maniacally, obviously in protest, and Steve couldn’t formulate a better reaction to that other than just blankly staring. He was having some weird hallucinations because of the drugs earlier, that must have been it.
It then dawned on him that perhaps this was the bargain that the Spartan wanted all along; to trade himself for the welfare of his people. Steve he had no problem with that; he was a man of self-sacrifice, and he actually enjoyed Tony’s company.
Tony pressed Steve harder against the wall, gritting his teeth at his words, annoyed by how calm Steve seemed to be, his threats and physical violence always intimidating others. But was that really him in the end?
Tony’s first instinct was to try and shove Steve away, but for whatever reason took over him, he didn't do it. Maybe it was the fact that he yearned at least some human contact after being confined for so long, and that scared him. Having another human body against him felt so warm, so reassuring, even in the strange mess that he found himself into at that moment.
“Reed says that we need to push him back through the portal where he came from. He’s scanning it right now, we’ll need to make sure that he goes through at the right time!”, Steve informed him.
Steve shut his eyes, resting his head on the pillow, adjusting himself just a little under Tony and glad that he was still so close to him. Tony's warmth was comforting.
Steve opened his eyes and looked at Tony, wanting to say something but not knowing what. “What did you mean earlier, about women sharing your bed being a loose term?” he asked eventually.
Tony rolled his eyes at Steve, gesturing at a different punching bag. “Okay, use less force now, let’s see what else is there”
“That would be me”, a female voice was heard as the elevator closed, a tall, elegant red haired woman walked in, her heels echoing in the large room. “Pepper Potts, Mr. Stark’s personal assistant. You must be..”, she said, looking at Tony while her hand was extended to Steve. “Mr. Rogers..?”
“And who says that I haven’t, that mine aren't? You don’t know a thing about Spartan training, do you? I walked up snowy mountains every morning and then washed up myself in the show that I stepped on,” he replied with a proud smirk.
This wasn’t the guy that would take every hit for the others, that hated bullies. It was hard to put Tony Stark in this situation, but he did felt compromised, bullied even by what he believed to be his hero, someone that his Dad looked up to, someone that Tony secretly aspired to be, getting Howard’s approval as a child. Suddenly, being Tony Stark, the guy that people wouldn’t stop criticizing didn’t sound bad at all. Anything but being considered the type of hero like the man dressed in blue standing in front of him.
Steve raised his head, looking over at the men before grabbing his tunic to cover his body and Tony’s.
Tony nodded to him as he stood up, his gun having charged again and fired towards the direction of the scientists who tried to reach the controller. Hitting the one on the floor on the face with the back of the gun, he grabbed the controller, turning towards Steve and setting his legs back in motion.
Tony Stark himself, dressed in a sharp, black suit, complete with a blue tie, hair slicked back, his dark blue eyes visible as no designer sunglasses were covering them as usual. The man looked...better than he thought that he would do. Of course, he needed to see if his personality was just as bad as he expected it to be; he immediately scolded himself, being wary was one thing, but he had to give the guy a chance to present himself.
Steve stared at him for a moment, “My mother abandoned me, Tony, and there is very little chance of my people listening to my words. This was meant to be my redemption.”
“I have heard this argument before. I wish not to repeat it. There is defending and then there is attacking; they are two different things. Clearly your only defence is your offence,” Steve said, shaking his head.
Locking eyes with the man opposite him, Tony walked closer and cupped his cheeks, and before Steve could protest, pushing his lips against his own. It felt strange, but not in a bad way. Steve’s lips were still dry, but they tasted so sweet. What surprised him the most, was the fact that Steve didn’t push him back; he froze in place but after a split second, he kissed him right back, and boy, was he a good kisser. Tony tasted of expensive chapstick, nothing like Sharon did, but yet, he found it strangely nice.
“Come on, you can do it, for me”, he said again in a lower face, his hand reaching up to make Steve look down to him, wanting to see his face at all times.
“I gave up my chance, long ago. But you are young, you should have hope. And fate works in mysterious ways. We cannot do much but trust those who weave the threads.”
“It’s such a pity.. we had great plans for you.. the first of many in the new line of super soldiers, but you just had to find about this.. what does it matter to you anyway? You’re faster stronger than ever before-”
“I’m just teasing you, Cap, relax”, Tony cut him before placing a hand on top of Steve’s, feeling how warm it felt against his own palm, trying to pass it off as a casual touch, but the way that Steve looked at him didn’t make him believe that anything going on at that moment was anywhere near innocent and friendly.
Steve bit down on Tony’s lips as finally Tony crushed them together, lucky his groans were masked as his tongue was sucked into Tony’s mouth, tangling them together, only breaking for a moment with trails of saliva glistening over Steve’s lips. He moved again and again, tilting his head up to stare at the ceiling.
Both him and Tony just stared at the spilled sand on the floor and the bag on the other side of the room, locking eyes with each other and starting to laugh.
“I know that you can’t trust us willingly now, Captain Rogers. But I'm asking you to put everything at side for now and come at the Baxter Building. There is someone that you need to see.”
“You know, I think I would just cut the wire”, he replied calmly, his expression showing nothing but hurt, and nobody in this room would realise that. Nobody here saw Tony feeling hurt before. Nobody was inside that cave, being tortured, having the first person that believed in him killed in front of him. Nobody saw him on that roof, his eyes close as his reactor was flickering, and none saw his efforts to save the city from Hammer and Vanko. It was unfair to him, nobody, and especially not Steve Rogers had the right to make those assumptions.
“And what’s the sudden interest in my comfort?” Tony asked, setting his finished apple down by his side as he stood to fetch a bowl of broth.
“Devoting your life to your mother, huh?” Tony asked in a lower tone, the smile from earlier disappearing. No matter how hard he tried to understand how Steve’s mind seemed to work, he couldn't.  “Can I ask you something?”
“Not my fault that I was dispatched now, is it? I’ve told Pepper to keep it a secret that I was coming here”, he chuckled as he pulled away. “But look at you, looking as good as ever! Cold doesn’t seem to affect you”
Tony smiled widely; Steve came here, he came all the way back to save him, just like he would expect from a super hero like himself. The panic and annoyance in Stane’s voice and expression really satisfied Tony; the star spangled man seemed to have came with a plan indeed, and judging by the way the older man was shouting orders, it wouldn’t take long for his hero to appear right before them.
“Unless there is a particular function, I am sure,” he said, looking out at the stage, placing the scrolls by his feet and folding his arms around himself.
Tony turned at him as he felt Steve’s warm hand against his own, their fingers lacing and steadily holding his hand. It felt warm, safe to be there. The people behind this were all behind bars now, and he came out of it victorious, with not only the dream that he dreamed, giving people a better life, but also with a unique partner who understood him like nobody else.
“He wanted you, not me. But you came here, all the way from Brooklyn to save me..? How even did you-“, Tony was interrupted by the sound of someone coughing, and when both him and Steve turned around, he watched in horror as Stane was pressing the syringe in his arm, the liquid quickly disappearing into his body.
The blonde shook his head. “What happened really, in 70 years? You can’t just tell me that everything changed and expect me to accept it, I’m sure you understand-”
He couldn’t afford thinking so fondly of his past, not when he had no idea what happened to any of those friends and allied, but yet he found himself lured into that room, full of memories that made him smile and just wish he could go back where he truly belonged.
“Thanks, um… do you want to come in while I put this in water?” Steve felt funny asking Tony in when in reality this entire building belonged to the alpha.
“You’re a filthy little minx Steve Rogers.” The inventor punctuated with a kiss on the omega’s shoulder, lining up the weeping head of his own arousal. “Just relax sugar.”
Steve woke to find something warm and ..furry?  Resting just beside his hand, blinking his tired eyes it was easy to recognize Shields infirmary. What was also very recognizable was the mess of brown hair beginning to go grey at the temples. He smiled and carded his fingers through the locks, the motion waking its owner.
Phil said he didn‘t know much other than Fury had left Shield with out a word. Considering Maria was planning to kick him out anyway was moot.
“Tony, sweetheart everything going to get better, I‘m here now and I‘m not gonna go anywhere. I‘m right here…” Steve whispered, kneeling down in front of his husband and gently soothing away traces of grime and sweat with the damp rag. “Say something… I need to know what I can do.”
Thank you for coming to read my work! I look forward to your comments and kudos. This is my first full length work for this fandom so please  be kind.
The ravenette bound his hair up on top of his head and slid into the emerald pool. “I am going to steal these when we leave.” he said looking up at the sky light. For the first time in a long time, Loki felt like a real prince again.
Steve ground his teeth and god this wasn’t how it was suppose to go at all, “That’s not it.. That’s..”
Remember kids before there was CGI there was just Lou Ferrigno with green body paint looking jacked as hell.
Rage, so much rage. Starting low in his stomach and filling his core and limbs with heat, rebuilding his bones and nervous system.
Steve shouted orders over the coms as his squadron circled the creature looking for any weak points.
Even so, he made those promises and so did Tony, they wanted to believe the words they gave the pups were as true as the Gospel. Still, Steve couldn't help but worry his children would know the pain of loss far too soon. Even if it was one of them, if they lost anyone it would be traumatic for them.
She smiled thoughtfully, “No, but that doesn't mean you can't pick up a phone. We all should have made that clearer to you. Don't do this alone Loki, it won't end well and I don't want to see you or James suffer for that.”
“She called him Anthony.” Thor says, leaning closer to look at the child now clutching one of his brother’s fingers.
Things he'd never even seen, days he'd been far from Midgard in the dungeons of his home world. He could see it so clearly that it felt real and unlike a dream at all. Walking through the rubble of an apartment building and seeing small toys and clothes among the broken bits of mortar. Scraps of drywall painted a soft lilac color. His feet wanted to stop but they never did, farther and farther through the remnants of a life unlived. Then there it was, a tipped bassinet, a small bundle at his feet, and a tiny cold hand peeking through the ruined fabric.
Not surprisingly Tony responded to said shovel talk with a cheeky wink and a comment of ‘only breaking in’ the good captain. Pepper of course knew better than to think Tony would ever purposefully hurt anyone. Still, she felt some odd kinship with the memory of Sarah Rogers. Someone needed to look out for Steve, and it had been her station in the tower as a ‘den mother’ of sorts in Stark Industries.
Tony's reason was sound and Steve agreed that it would be good for Peter, having at least one of them there all the time, With Steve's missions and the occasional business trips for Stark industries they were able to work out a plan. It wasn' t like Tony had given up everything. He still tinkered in his workshop as the Avengers tech support. Those years were so good, it seemed like for once everything was finally falling into place. That wonderful domestic routine that Tony never thought he would enjoy.
“Yeah, well um, I think I’ll head out for a while. I just didn’t want him to wake up alone; the doctors said he might be confused.” Wilson said picking up his jacket.
“Thank you…” Steve breathed behind him. The Captain teetered forward and braced for another impact with the carpet but instead he was held in place by a strong grasp. Looking up he saw Tony, the visor was up and he looked…disappointed or angry. Steve couldn’t tell which, and that bothered him. Something in him sank to the bottom of his stomach, the look in the alpha’s eyes made him want to fall and show his throat. The shameful notion made the blood rush in his cheeks to fast and left him dizzy.
“He never walks away; he has done so much to restore my faith. I guess you where right about one thing; Steve Rogers is one hell of a man. Ya know something else. He’s a hell of a father.  He’s kind, he stays… and best of all. He’s nothing like you Howard.”
The alpha slid his arm around his mates back and looked up into those clear blue eyes he loved. “I don't know but I don't want to risk anything and I know you wouldn't want that either. You have to leave this one to me babe.”
Everyone should have really showered Bruce Banner in praise for keeping the world safe from certain extinction on a daily basis when his Bea was in a mood.
“I told you that squid looked questionable, now be quiet. The coronation is just a bit longer.” Loki admonished the youth; Tony was always feigning a sour stomach or some other malady to get out of things like this.
“Something to share Captain, Sergeant?” Fury crossed his arms and glared at Coulson's team who had delivered the information. As if the young agents were playing some inopportune joke. “If you have something to add then we damn well want to know what it is.”
Steve let his head falling back and spine arch when those smug lips found a home around his erection.
“No…Bucky…he….he killed them.. He killed your parents!” Steve sobbed, he couldn’t hold it any more. Here tony was trying to help him when he didn’t deserve it. He didn’t deserve any of it.
“I should make you do all the work, just lay here and let my superior genetics be taken like ripe apples from the tree of life.”
“Oh god.” Bruce couldn’t take it anymore, so with the maturity level fallen to 0. Banner had to have a special talk with Thor, Loki and Steve.
Steve’s brow furrowed and honestly hoped this wasn’t what he thought it was that she wouldn’t ask to ‘see’ anything. He was sure Bruce had told her what he was but he really wasn’t ready to have to give visual confirmation to this woman. “Depends what it is.”
“Mermaids, right. That’s what they called them in Denmark.” Natasha stood and walked around the room, her voice arrived as they looked at the glass cases as one would peruse fine art. “Half human half fish. Some believe they grant wishes and their tears turn to pearls. Other…others believe they draw sailors to their deaths.” She thought it only kind to indulge their host, perhaps if they took this job it would ease his mind in some way. Having a skilled crew to come back and put the truth before him might be what the old man needed. Natasha saw no harm in that. She wasn't sure if Steve would see it that way .
Night turned into morning with Tony stopping to catch some shuteye on the sofa in the workshop, somewhere around noon the inventor rejoined the world of the living.  Stretching and popping his aching joints before retreating to the bathroom for a quick shower and a change of clothes.
Today Loki hadn't eaten breakfast; he looked so uncomfortable even trying that James didn't have the heart to push the issue. Instead, he just kissed the slim man and said “It's ok Doll, maybe you'll be hungry later huh? We'll just put this up for now and you can come back to it when you feel like it.”  Loki had seemed relived and gone off to one of his daily haunts in the tower.
The last of his father’s acquaintances Tony has never actually met, only heard of because this one lives on land. Still, the stories that his father used to tell him still bring the young mer comfort.
After the church, there was a precession to the cemetery.  Tony rode in the family car alone with Peter, the little boy was crying again.  Tony was just numb and held him tighter, softly shushing the whimpering child. He couldn’t say it would be all right because he didn’t feel right at all.
Tony’s face fell, “anything ells?” he hoped there wasn’t because if anything happened to Steve of the babies while he was gone he’d never forgive himself.
(omega Tony, normally I don’t do this but when I heard Piece by piece, -by Kelly Clarkson. I was literally in tears and this just came to me. I feel it fits this context best. )
“Box seats for this Sundays game, I have no idea whose playing but I love the nachos.” Tony said heading back into the seating area. The alpha leaned over the back of the sofa and kissed the soldiers cheek. “Did I score spangles?”
“Oh yeah I do, I haven’t been out to a club in a while. There was one Bucky and I used to, had to walk pretty far since it wasn’t in our neighbor hood.” Steve hesitated on how to phrase it, he knew times where different now and not everything was politically correct.
The agent pulled up a chair sitting heavily upon it. “I always tried to live my life with no regrets. Even when I went after Loki alone - I had no regrets with how that went down. I thought I was going to die and I was completely at peace with that. I thought, I did the right thing... Since I have been back the right thing has been harder and harder.”
The weight shifts and he can hear Tony walking around the bed and kneeling in front of him. He can’t look, Strong hands take his wrists and there is warmth there, it feels so real and he's shattering. He can’t, he can’t look and ruin the dream or hallucination. Whatever the hell this is.
Bruce, wonderful patient Bruce. Steve wondered how in the world that man ever put up with Tony with out going green and squishing him like a bug. “So they are 20 minuets apart now? That seems about right for first stage labor, have you decided weather you want to deliver up here or on the med floor?”  The doctor asked the couple.
Loki entered his quarters and noticed Jormungand sparking unhappily as the sea serpent cornered a shivering servant girl. This would not have been unusual considering the overgrown eel tended to put most on edge, much as if Loki’s other pets whom were no longer allowed in the palace walls. However, what made this different was that the servant girl was holding a red-faced screaming babe.
“I’m home!” Steve called cheerfully to what looked like an empty room. Though if one were to look closely they would see, it was not in fact empty.
With all the bells and whistles of the grand tower, it still was not home to Loki. That was not to say that living with the pack wasn't pleasant in the sense of convenience. It was delightful to have grocery delivery at his fingertips and efficient cleaning services. The luxury amenities reminded Loki of growing up in the grand palace of his youth.
Tony tried to be sly as he slid up behind his Omega standing at the cooking range. Slipping his hands around the blonds hips and leaning up to kiss the nape of the soldiers neck. “What's cookin good lookin.” He said in a low warm tone, molding himself to the taller blonds backside.
He would walk with heavy footsteps and blank eyes to the bar. Pausing as he poured a stout of whiskey, a smear of red on his knuckles drawing the brunettes attention.
“Mutant children? Huh..”James sat back running his human hand over his stomach where the delicious stew had begun to settle.“Yeah, I mean I guess that would be true. So um..does this mean you want to...stop trying for a baby?”
Steve didn’t say anything when Phil finished. Some were in his all American idealistic brain he couldn’t fathom Tony doing that. He had seen the footage but even then - it wasn’t like this. Not the man who bathed their son, played hide, and seek with Peter and the lab bots. Not the man he married and slept beside at night, that man was warm, funny, and generous.
As a result, The Captain was currently holding his bleeding side with his back pressed in a corner. He looked over to his shattered com, Barnes had destroyed his only link to his team.
For now, it seemed all was well. it only took moments for Tony to flair up with worry and was all over Clint, wanting to know why he wasn’t at the tower taking care of Peter. Natasha assured him that Peter was safe with Bruce and that she had personally kissed the boy goodbye and left him blissfully coloring in the den on Banner‘s floor. No one would dare touch a hair of that child’s head with his uncle Hulk just under the surface of the quiet doctor.
Sure, maybe he couldn’t beat Tony in the ‘silent self loathing’ department. He was damn close though, and from an outside perspective, it was troubling.
James kicked one of the corpses and wasn’t that surprised to see a network of wires and sparks in through the bullet hole. At the very least, this didn’t add to the blood on his hands. This was no more heinous than kicking a vending machine.
Steve seemed to relax just a fraction so Tony scooted closer humming softly and rubbing a hand over the tight white cotton that was now ridding up over the baby bump.  Steve always slept better, when he sang to him, it was somewhat cute. Usually Tony would pick some old standard his mother used to play on the hi-fi when he was a kid.  Something else occurred to him tonight though, with a soft little thump against the palm of his hand.
“Ok, well have fun. I regrettably cannot stay and science with you Brucy bun. I promised spangles here some pop culture education. Did you know he doesn’t know who Spinal Tap was?”
Tony stood in the cold November wind, tugging his jacket tighter around his frame. He needed to do this, should have done this sooner if he was being honest with himself.  Now he stood here in this quiet cold place and wasn’t sure were to begin.
Wagner looked down at his clasped hands, tail drooping slightly. “I know you are strong enough my dear friend. Logan spoke with a contact in Canada recently. There is an orphanage there for mutant children and young mutant mothers. It is a nice place surrounded by forests.” Kurt smiled thinking of the photos he'd seen of the old lodge tucked away in the snowy mountains.
Tony had been right, nothing had changed. In the field, he was still just ‘Cap’. Still Steve was having a hard time focusing; the incident in the tower had thrown him. He Hadn’t expected to be so affected. True there was so much of his past that hurt and nights he found sleep a distant memory. Yet he never showed it, never let that wall down for anyone.
The alpha sat up and took in the seriousness of the conversation. Obviously, this little dialog had been going on in Steve's head a lot longer than it should have. At this rate, he was going to have a small sports team of kids. Not that he didn't love his kids or have the thought of more cross his mind; Tony just thought there would be more time. “You know I’m with you on going public, I would have called a press conference if you said so the day after they were born. I know how hard it is to stand up in front of the world and tell your secrets Steve, you know that. That said, you don’t have to be pregnant to do it.”
He sent up and order for doughnuts and coffee become getting back to work, after all nothing spells productivity like sugar and caffeine.
Tony tugged off his shades leveling the man with a glare, “ Ya know doc you’re not startin off real strong here so how about we get down to the brass tax and cut the trip down memory lane bullshit.”
He had gone into an abandoned church following the person and then... Nothing.  Why there was nothing…nothing was bad.  Nothing was cold and empty and tasted like salt water rising up in his throat.
Steve was stronger than most people believed. He took care of her and always managed to smile for her.
Everyone looked up and thought it over, it wasn’t a terrible idea. Turning Bucky over to an off planet ally would eliminate the possibility that he could escape and wreak havoc or be compromised by a hydra agent in disguise. After all, if hydra could infiltrate SHIELD, what said they couldn’t already be in the government on other levels?
This fathers then erupted into laughter, the little one not sure what was so funny about all of this. He had clearly asked for a puppy and now he we getting a brother or sister. That was no fun at all.
Stark had seen the research, the nanotechnology's process of redevelopment was a violent one. Extremis essentially broke down the human body and rewrote every system from the ground up in a matter of hours. Once perfected the progression could be even faster. It was violent and messy, a large empty freezer would be the perfect place to be if someone wanted to take it for spin.
“Yeah..yeah...I won.” Tony felt his consciousness drifting in and out. Someone was shouting and they had stopped moving. Were they at the surface? Was his dad there?
Steve sat up, the top of his head brushing against the top of the awning. “You know what I’m talking about. Don’t worry; I’ll have my things out by the end of the week if not sooner.”
Still, James supposes that hearing it from an Asset  Agent, makes Fury feel that the information is sound. It wouldn't be the first time that the field operatives uncovered something was amiss among the fine print. Things can change like day and night when you get out in the field.
“Someone didn’t get that this party was invite only.” He said, looking over to where the plane flickered into view. The black metal now dotted with lines of frost. The bay doors began to open, the mechanism faltered for a moment as the cold air hit the hydraulics.
But hey, the grammar is nice and apparently that is way more important than someones mental health right?  At one point I seriously considered just deleting all of my works and walking away.  Because this felt like a chore or assignment and not sometime I was happy to do.
She picked this place because it was quiet and upper crust, the sad irony that Stark still owned his family’s old estate in Fieldstone not far from here- not that Stark had been there in ages. Or even been seen in days.
Steve shook his head, “That’s what I’m trying to stop. Do you think Tony will stop with Hydra and AIM? He won’t, I can see it and I can tell it will never be enough. All this anger and pain will tear him apart and turn him into something so much worse and so much more dangerous. When that happens none of you will be able to stop him.”
Tony backtracked, finally letting go of the solders face. “Ugh…yeah, no I didn’t. I meant. Well it’s all really technical and what not point is this is great, your great, I‘m great this all just …great.”
Bruce slid down in his seat, staring at the pasts twirling on his fork. Phil didn’t looked phased at all by the topic. That’s what happens when your mated to an idiot who brings that sort of thing up at a dinner table.
Thankfully, this was not such a visitor. Tony realized that the moment he gained a proper look at the front vanity plate baring a large X.
The boom from column of iridescent light striking the earth sent up a wall of steam and shook the mountainside.
“Its fine I'll take her in” Loki mumbled looking in the glove box for toilet covers and sanitizer. Norns knew what one could pick up in rest area toilets. He could use magic to make them spotless but even then,…one never could be too careful.
The soldier could tell a lot was going on in his old friends mind by the way Bucky had stared at him just moments after the sounds of battle settled. That this all had been as hard for Barnes as it had been for Tony. Steve knew however, Thor and Loki had been right in keeping the brunette off Earth, because there would have been nothing to stop his old friend from falling back into the darkness of the Winter Soldier.
Letting his eyes linger longer, Tony found himself missing more. The little white mark on the palm of his left hand from falling down in Aunt Peggy's garden when he was ...what was it 5? 6? He still remembers cutting his palm on a sharp stone and how Howard just glared at him for crying and Maria had stood off to the side sipping her cocktail. Aunt Peggy was the one that picked him up and Aunt Angie with her sweet smelling hair had hugged him and bandaged up his hand.
Coulson and his team blasted through the main gate – literally. Daisy lead the charge quaking the gates off the hinges and sending them flying. Next hit was the small fleet of black SUV’s. She sent the vehicles sliding and toppling over in the lose gravel.
Flopping back into the chair Tony rubbed his own arms and let his eyes wander, he could see a million things in this room that could use improving and that was driving him nuts. It was better to look at those things than Steve though. Because when he looked at the sleeping soldier, his eyes focused too much on things they shouldn’t.
Loki wanted to wait until his mate was at least half way through before he tentatively proposed his idea. Watching carefully as he tucked into his own meal, eventually finding his moment.
They left him, they wanted to be there when Bruce explained things to Peter, even though Banner swore he could keep it together. Pepper wanted to be sure.
Loki turned away walking with a slight limp that Tony just now noticed. He had no idea what happened and his mind was already conjuring up images of long pale limbs painted in red ribbons all sprawled artfully across white tiles. The billionaire shook the macabre image away as he staked after the other man. "There's a lot left damn it so just let me help you!"
“Stark, we have a problem and I don’t like problems.” Fury said walking into the workshop. “How exactly are we suppose to get Intel when you go off half cocked on some mission I didn’t even approve?”  The lease on his favorite attack dog was growing thin and Fury knew it. He could see it in the inventors eyes, that hallow hungry look of a man who had been in the wind to long.
Life for a life. “Alright, just let me take him back to shore. I have friends there who can take care of him.” Howard didn’t want to miss his son growing up but if it meant Anthony had a chance he would die. He would go and be with Maria if he could - unless this monster took his very soul. Either way it would be worth it in the end.
Waking up on that big soft bed with Tony softly snoring into his chest had been amazing. He had never felt so content, even so, Steve wondered if he deserved that kind of contentment because later that day they would send Bucky with Thor to Asgard.
Coulson and his team returned to SHIELD headquarters while Clint delivered Barnes and Stark to the tower. Some of the SHIELD personnel had attempted to pressure Barnes into staying there for medical treatment, instead, the soldier begged off stating he would be better off at the tower.
Tony kissed his back. “Go to sleep baby, I’ll clean you up and get us something. You feel like Italian?
The doctor hummed pulling the safety tip from a syringe. “I’m not surprised. You can try to get some water into him after this; if he cannot handle them, we’ll do an IV. Ok Steve I’m going to give you a few injections in your hip ok? Then we’ll see how you feel.”
Maya Hansen was an old associate of Tony's. They had met a number of years ago during a technology summit in Switzerland.  It seemed that the lovely beta scientist was in hot water. Truthfully, Tony could just barely remember the woman, while yes she had been beautiful, Tony was still in his 'wine, women, and song' phase. He did vaguely remember she had been working on some innovative and exciting tech in the biotech discipline.
Barton could have done this job, hell even Melinda or Daisy would have been qualified. Phil would be pushing it because while he was a great agent… James didn’t want to sit through more “look at these cute videos of the kids on my phone.”  For the next six days or be tricked into telling old war stories.
Steve stretched his legs; he did feel more powerful, it made him wonder how faster he could run with those legs, maybe he would go for a run the next morning, early on and check.
Steve felt so relaxed, feeling the kisses over his lips, tilting his head up to kiss Tony back. But he felt something deeper in each kiss, craving him more and more, as though Tony was pouring all his emotion into it.
“In that case, we both need to thank this little thing," Tony smiled as he tapped on the medallion, looking up to Steve again to see how calm and relaxed his expression was.
Tony wasn’t exactly a man of patience, and Steve’s defensive attitude wasn’t something he was willing to accept, especially after that night. He quickly hopped over the bed and stood over the blonde, looking down at him.
But for now, he wanted to give Steve some space, he dragged him into this crazy Stane business when they had just left the cemetery. Tony didn’t know who Peggy was, but asking Jarvis made him well aware. He knew how it felt losing a lover, someone who he could possible consider a life partner. Rumiko Fujkawa was for Tony exactly that, but she was taken away from him in the worst possible way. Herself being the heir of one of the biggest Japanese companies in the market and Tony Stark’s girlfriend sure made her a target for the Yakuza, and while Tony was taken away, tortured in Vietnam, she was assassinated on her way to America, to learn more about her boyfriend’s abduction. After Tony was released, there was one person he wanted to see, and that was Rumiko, and to be told that she was buried away in Japan was the most devastating thing he heard in his entire life. Months of alcohol dependence came by until he was able to stand on his own feet again and move the expeditions outside New York for the search of new energy resources. Yes, he experience the heartache that Steve did before, and he knew how it felt, he was able to feel and understand what was going through his mind when he stood by Peggy’s tombstone and holding his hand was an act of impulse, something that he would like to have happened when he was standing in front of Rumiko’s own shrine and mourning her passing.
Just like any other night, Tony stayed awake until he made sure that Steve was asleep. When he finally heard the man’s light snoring, he closed his eyes, trying to drift away to sleep.
Tony’s smile looked rather smug, Steve let out another moan as the kneading fingers on his hips began to move him. The friction between him and the suit generating warmth that surged up through his entire body, and by this point his knees were weak and barely moved.
In a way, Steve’s silence was comforting, and Tony followed suit, letting the warm water and steam wash away all his worries and doubts, just enjoying the moment and the sight of the handsome man in the bath with him, looking calm and relaxed for a change having taken his armour off.
“Can we get to Brooklyn tomorrow? I want to visit my..apartment” , he said calmly. He postponed that for days now, and he didn’t even know why. Still, he wanted to go, he never changed his mind, and now that him and Tony seemed to be in better terms, maybe it was better, and more comfortable for Steve to make that visit. It had only been a couple of days, but Tony became someone who he could consider a friend, especially since he didn’t have anyone else in that century. Tony as well seemed to be happy of them bonding; he would show up and talk, spend more time together and actually help him figure out anything that Steve needed to be answered.
Steve stood up, his posture straight as he followed the man into the elevator yet again. He didn’t know how to feel; part of him expected that outcome and he was wondering what would be worse, to see his lover’s grave or to see her aged in front of him, thinking of all the time he wasted and not having been by her side. His fists were clenched up and he stayed silent, following Tony out of the glass elevator and out of the building. The breeze didn’t help at all to cool him down, and he didn’t snap out of his thoughts until Tony spoke.
“Some values are worth keeping around”, the billionaire replied with a huff. “Now..this way”, he said, walking ahead and stopping by a door near the end of the corridor. The big room was decorated in a style that Steve honestly didn’t expect from the other man. He didn’t find it impossible for Tony to have arranged for the room to be changed in that way while they were flying back to make the adjustment easier for Steve.
Steve drew the shield back and looked at Tony, staring straight into his sapphire blue eyes, “Why didn’t you... Why were you so ashamed, after I gave myself to you?” he said.
“Iron Man!”, a disheveled Captain America yelled, cowl off to cool himself down, shield blocking any heat rays coming their direction, doing his best to protect them both. “You need to get rid of that suit, right now!”
He slid himself inside just a little, before pulling back out again, starting to coat his length before attempting to push inside again.
Steve turned to Tony and then to the screen. It felt strange to talk to thin air and hearing someone reply back to him, he didn’t even know where to look at, so he decided to face the screen where the Stark Industries logo was spinning around.
“It means that I won’t be responsible for the potential death of a human being because someone decided to use my blood as a basis for the super soldier formula. I’m not signing up to be subject of experiments again”
“We’re not a team, we’re a time-bomb”, he heard Bruce saying from behind his desk, shaking his head.
“To make two demigods fall in love is not the right thing to do, especially these two,” the thunder god's son said as he shoved Cupid's son forward. “Now fix it.”
Tony rubbed the back of his head. He always told people that Hephaestus gave the medallion to him because of his services, and that was partly true. In reality, Ares requested it to save Tony from mortal wounds. “It keeps my heart beating. If I take it off, I’m...” He stopped. “You get the picture; tragic old injury, near death experience, godly construction keeping me alive. I can’t take it off," he finally said.
“-Tony. I cannot thank you enough for this opportunity, I will admit, I was skeptical, I didn’t think that they look..that good, feel so real. I don’t even need to think about them moving the way normal feet do, they just...do it.”
“Don’t you even think about touching him!”, a stern voice was heard behind them, and before blinking an eye, the syringe was knocked off Stane’s hand, leaving the older man rub his fingers in pain, knocked down by Steve with a swift movement.
Tony looked at him carefully, both their previous attitudes stripped away in that moment without either of them truly knowing why.
The large wolf wrapped his tail around Tony as they slowly drifted to sleep, slowly but steadily being replaced by strong, built and hairless arms. The cold that Tony felt was soon repressed by the warm chest of his now furless boyfriend.
“I can’t say that, Tony, you know that very well..”, Steve replied, kneeling down to match Tony’s height, still away from him as he was commanded.
The bearded man was holding a glass in one hand, and by the smell of it, it must have been some good bourbon, and on the other hand he was holding firmly a small square device. He had to squint and take a better look at it, all by making sure that Tiny wasn’t aware of him staring. The little device seems to project numbers and images to Tony, and even though it was hard for him to tell what it was showing exactly, the other man seemed genuinely concerned about what he was viewing. He couldn’t help but question everything, but he knew he had to wait; the shock after seeing his city for so long would have been bigger than finding out about a strange little device that could project all kinds of things.
Steve stretched, looking at Tony and running his hand down the man’s chest, rubbing it sensually. “I’m sure I will,” he said. “I’m enjoying learning thus far.”
The super soldier serum, that was it. It had to be it. The government experiments that his father also overlooked during the war, the promise of a new breed of super soldiers that would have won the war... What did he read about it... It was flawed in some ways, too many side effects... Could it also favour cryogenesis? Was it possible that the Captain’s fall into the icy cold ocean combined with the serum that was running in his veins could have kept him alive? Too many questions needed answering, and right now, their priority was to see if the soldier was indeed meant to be saved.
“That’s right, you can’t do anything! I should have killed you a long time ago, Tony, you and your dog are going down for good!”, Stane laughed, standing before them, his hand up in the air, ready to strike them down.
The sharp sound of his armour being pierced echoed through his ears and he could feel his heartbeat. He gasped, pulling back to look down. The tip of Tony’s spear protruded through his chest plate - only that spear, crafted by Hephaestus, could pierce his armour. One of the Spartans had grabbed the spear when Tony let it fall, and had struck him from behind, the warriors face covered completely in red as he let out a loud battle cry.
“Mr. Stark”, the sheriff replied, nodding politely. “Yes, Marshall Fury has indeed warned me about you, sir”
“I should go to the temple of Hephaestus and give him an offering, to show my thanks,” Steve said. “Without him I wouldn’t have met you.”
It was impossible to fall asleep. He just couldn’t do it, after not spending nearly seven decades trapped in ice. If anyone was going to ask, he would surely reply that sleeping for so long must have been enough. He didn’t think of the consequences of waking up, surely his insomnia that he suffered from during the war would have gotten worse now. He predicted many sleepless nights in his future and that made him sigh.
“I’m sure that you’re underestimating your skills, Athenian,” Tony replied with an honest nod. “You are probably as good as any of them.
Steve patted the horses lightly, hearing them make a happy neighing sound as he jumped into the chariot. “They were gifts when I was younger,” Steve answered. “They’re quite old but they are the closest I’ve had to friends, without my mother intervening.”
“You seemed adamant to shut me down earlier,” Steve said, raising one eyebrow. “Why the change of heart?”
Steve smiled to the kiss, looking up and noticing the telescope. “Oh, you never showed me what this does,” he said, leading him over. “Where did you get this?”
Steve moved lower, kissing Tony’s torso and moving to suck the skin on his chest softly, just as he was ‘taught’.
“No, not leave them,” Tony said, running his fingers over the shield. “I just wish we didn’t have the responsibilities that our names bring upon us." He turned the shield in his hands, knocking it while turning it around, admiring whoever had crafted that glorious weapon. “I must say, I spent many years working in Hephaestus’ workshop and I never laid eyes on such a beauty," he said as he gave the shield back to Steve.
Tony tried again to smile in return. “You should keep on fighting, and maybe... maybe one day we can both find who we’re looking for, what do you say?” he asked. “If anything matters, I do have faith in you, from what you’ve showed me so far.”
“And what if you need to be educated the Spartan way, Athenian? What if you must finally learn what matters and appreciate the necessity of war? Is that supposed to be a challenge?” Tony huffed a little. “Because I will take that challenge, but it’s not honorary to kill an ambassador in time of war."
“D-damn you Tony Stark...” Steve muttered with a bittersweet pleasure, feeling the warm musky breath cascade along the skin of his neck, close to finishing but not wanting to give Tony the pleasure of watching him. “T-turn your head!” He barked.
It started as a joke - almost every night ever since December hit, they would try to create the ultimate cup of hot chocolate. They didn’t think much of it, but after every night’s attempt, they would both try and come up with a different idea to up their game next time.
Despite all, Steve was indeed back. He came back from the land of the dead, but more technically, he had never been there. Tony and the team was trying so hard to defend their name, and to see rising Norman Osborn rising in power just before his eyes, claiming his and Steve’s titles, stealing his own team and ethics sure was a low blow. It seemed fine until he was forced to follow a protocol that he had been planning for a while now; to wipe off his memories so the identities of his friends wouldn’t be known to their enemies. It was the least he could do after the war he caused, and the ultimate solution, it had to be that way. Waking up after his ‘memory wipe’ and realising how much he actually forgot was a shock to him, especially when he found out exactly what he did during the war. He could see why, but the fact that everything got so far and so scary in such a little amount of time.. that was still terrifying to him. It took him a long time to piece everything together and to realise why Steve seemed to be distant, which lead him to have more heated arguments with him, trying to both apologise and defend himself. Steve remembered everything in detail when Tony was struggling to remember the looks, the words they exchanged, but he knew that he sought one thing; Steve’s forgiveness. He confessed to him that he couldn’t unsee his mistakes, that he was at his best when he was beside him, and Steve embraced him.
“This isn’t an office job position, Mr. Rogers. We’re here to ask you.. a favour, of some sort. If you were to accept, you will get more benefits out from this than we will.”
“Morning”, he greeted Steve with a smile, passing him a coffee mug that got ready for the both of them.
Tony wanted to make sure that Steve was comfortable enough before he carried on with the soft caresses on his shoulders, leaning to press soft kisses to the man’s chest instead, his hand still resting by Steve’s front to give him time to get used to the feeling.
Steve’s voice was loud and clear, he could tell that Tony needed the backup and he was offering it; he stood by what Tony believed anyway, he wouldn’t let someone who clearly had no good intentions to use something as dangerous as the formula that gave him his advanced skills and powers, it wasn’t something people could just play with. It was a potential weapon, and that’s how he was used back in the day in first place.
“Now that you’re here, yes”, he blurted out. “I mean, it’s good to know that you’re back in one piece, Cap.”
Tony waited until Steve was ready before walking out of the bath and back into his chambers, with Steve following him closely, and he shut the door behind them as he ran his fingers through his hair, trying to dry it up a little.
“Of course not. I don’t often hide anything from my mother but she mustn’t know of this; she would think I am even more foolish than she thinks I already am for going to Sparta in the first place,” he said, pursing his light pink lips, brushing his hair back behind his ears with his free hand. “The fact that you find killing amusing, however, leaves a lot to be desired.”
Asking for help to get on his wheelchair every day was painful, so he learnt to do it himself in no time. Still, the times that he found himself on the floor and forced to call one of the nurses to help him up were enough to shatter his pride and cause him to isolate himself.
“Captain Rogers, if you need anything at all, don’t hesitate to call me. I will be coming by tomorrow at 9 to pick you up”
Steve obeyed, feeling refreshed as the cold water was hitting his face. “Was the meeting all right?” he asked, changing into a fresh blue shirt himself.
It wasn’t until he was hit by a very clumsy and frightened cyclist that he actually had to pay a visit to the dentist. Spending a few hours there wasn’t his ideal Friday afternoon, but again he considered himself at least a bit lucky for not getting one of his front teeth pulled out. The dentist reassured him that the fake tooth that he would put in would look and feel like the real thing but it didn’t make the procedure of pulling the tooth out any less painful.
Reed coughed, raising his hands in the air. “There’s something…more! I’ll show you, just let me go!”, he replied, not wanting to fight Steve back; it would only put him in a worse situation than he already was, and with what he was about to show Steve, he doubted that the Captain would keep his calm.
It all started with that pair of piercing blue eyes that stared at him through those golden slits; at first, Steve Rogers thought that they looked menacing, terrifying even, belonging to someone who posed a serious threat. And indeed, due to the initial shock, Iron Man and the rest of the Avengers did have to explain themselves and take a confused and out of time man back to the Mansion.
Leaving the building with his cheeks swollen and a solid dose of painkillers and anesthetics, he managed to take a taxi back to his apartment; the driver understood him, which took him by surprise. Staring at the bulge in his pocket caused by the napkin that he wrapped the tooth in, he remembered how excited he would be whenever the tooth under his pillow would disappear whenever he would lose another tooth. His mother would say that unfortunately the tooth fairy didn’t have enough money on her for him, but Steve found the idea of an actual fairy coming to take away his teeth whimsical. Of course he knew that his mother was the one to replace the tooth with a few coins, but he would always act so surprised; he knew his mother was working as hard as he could to afford a better life for them both.
Steve looked at the chariot and then climbed on, sitting next to Tony and looking at the vehicle that seemed so polished - spikes and all.
His people and the locals were mostly rivals, but they offered him all the help he needed to find his way to Sparta, and he traded his knowledge for hospitality; some of them jokingly advised him to stay there and never return to Athens, something that he couldn’t take lightly, but he replied with a small, polite nod of his head, explaining that his allegiance stayed with his city, no matter what.
“Did you honestly think that I’m invincible? Come on now, Tony, I’m just a man”, Steve said softly, attempting to get closer. This time, Tony didn’t pull away. “Let’s get you back to bed…”
Tony waking up covered in sweat and panting heavily seemed to be a common occurrence in the newly rebuilt Avengers Tower. At first, he was dealing with it alone, waking up in the middle of the night and trying to calm himself down, reminding himself that all those were memories that he was trying to repress, that he was safe from Iron Mongers, terrorists, aliens and Extremis enchanted soldiers that would spit fire.
Steve kept his eyes on Tony as he was pushed up, his scrolls rolling to the floor the instant Tony pinned him up.
“It wasn’t that bad, was it?” he asked him with a chuckle as the suit stopped vibrating, that smug smile remaining on his face.
“It’s just.. this is so strange, in a good way, of course. I wouldn’t expect that there would be a day where I would walk again, not just walk, fly, and sit in Tony Stark’s penthouse eating pizza with him”
“Of course. Anything you want," Tony said with a nod. He felt protective, sensitive towards the young Athenian, not wanting to hurt him in any possible way, not when he was so innocent and pure. Tony wasn’t going to taint Steve with his own ways; Steve deserved to be treated in a delicately, carefully.
Soon, they reached the marbled building, and Tony pointed at it as they walked inside. Steam coming out from the main room, and Tony started to take off his tunic and sandals.
During his journey, he passed through the Isthmus of Corinth, a bridge so famous to the Greek world that he heard about it often, which eventually leads him to the nearby city of Corinth, admiring the quick pace its citizens lived in, it being one of Greece’s busiest harbours.
“Yes teacher, of course I want to learn," Tony nodded, blinking at Steve’s comment. “You find my body fascinating?” Steve nodded, and Tony smiled. “Thank you,” he said, focusing on how Steve seemed to take in everything. “That’s the result of year of Spartan training. Cruel training."
Tony couldn’t help but exaggerate that smug smile on his face, especially when he knew that Steve couldn’t see him, let alone being aware of his presence in the room. He licked his lips when he saw that he was wearing the boxers he got him, always such a beautiful sight, the soft fabric fitting perfectly over his tight muscles, the front leaving little to his imagination of what was hiding inside it.
“Yes, it’s really beautiful here, it gives you a strange sense...” He scratched his head, feeling again that familiar buzz at Steve's touch. “I don’t know exactly how to say this. It brings you close to Mountain Olympus in a way, even if I have no relations to Athena."
Upon hearing those words, Steve snapped out of the mesmerising stare he was giving Tony, pulling back and shaking his head.
Tony growled, shoving the arm away like Steve did earlier. This didn’t turn out well for neither of them. The meeting between Howard Stark’s son and Captain America sounded promising, but now it was nothing but disappointing, it was like none matched each other’s expectations.
Steve turned to Tony, wanting to hear his answer. It was a common fact that Howard Stark was supplying the army with weapons and tech against the Germans, but according to what he gathered so far, Tony was focusing on renewable energy now, something completely different and not violent in the slightest.
“How are you feeling?”, Tony asked in a lower voice, getting behind Steve and pushing his chair towards another more secluded room, where  a metal table was waiting for them. It looked ominous, it certainly made Steve shudder unintentionally, hoping that nobody else caught that.
“Its justice, Spartan,” Steve explained, walking through the busy market, looking around at all of the different items. “It’s not being too hard, it’s balancing the scales. I did something wrong, therefore I must be punished.”
“Does...this make us friends?” Tony asked hesitantly, fighting the urge to rub his cheek against Steve’s hand, closing his eyes in satisfaction anyway. He was strangely comforted by Steve's warm palm touching his skin.
The lights of the Eiffel Tower were on, lighting the whole city, the warm, orange light emerging from it making the metallic structure ten times more beautiful to Steve’s eyes than it did earlier in the morning.
Tony shook his shoulders. “Whatever suits you”, he said as he turned to Pepper again. “Did you come all the way down here just to greet me? I’m flattered”
“Help yourself, Athenian,” Tony nodded to him as he sat on his bed. “There’s plenty more where those came from, and you’re an honourable guest after all.”
“Negative. No liquids are stored inside me”, he replied, the hands moving to rest on the knees of the suit. “Removing your clothes will be necessary, sir”
Steve caught a glimpse of Tony’s back, his eyes following the scars that crossed Tony's skin, probably old wounds, acquired at a young age by the colour of them. “I do not wish to be a burden.”
Tony was speechless as he held on to Steve, still in shock. “What just happened..?”, he said after a while, sitting up properly, but still not letting go of the Captain.
“So I am a demon now?” Tony asked, a bit annoyed with how blunt Steve was being in the way he spoke about him. “Still not managed to redeem myself?”
Steve’s look seemed confident and strong, but Tony was able to see past that, having experience that before. He knew very well how it felt to mask your pain and appear strong in front of others, and the least he could do now was to stick by Steve’s request. “All right, I’ll get Happy to drive us there”, he nodded as he stood up and typed on a device he took out of his pocket, gesturing for Steve to follow him.
His voice shook slightly as he vividly recalled what he was shown, knowing he should have accepted his fate, but part of him just wanted to fight against it, change it, but it was written already.
What he saw left him speechless. It was a complete blast from the past; the apartment seemed untouched to strangers like Tony, but Steve knew that someone else has been inside throughout the years. Maybe not to actually live here, but surely to steal things. Upon further inspection, he noticed that one of the drawers in his small living room was broken, where he kept his savings. Not that he cared at that moment; money was the least of his worries for once.
Despite Tony’s attempts to ignore it, Steve’s groans in his sleep kept Tony awake. He wouldn’t bear it, he couldn’t accept that Steve didn’t want his help to get over this. The thought that Steve kept things hidden from him, even though he tried everything to make Tony open up to him instead, didn’t seem fair. Because, one of the things that Tony hated but also was thankful for being with Steve was that he changed him, made him a better person, taught him how to share his burden with him. Right now, Steve was doing
“I trust you that you won’t try and murder me in my sleep and run off with my savings, if that’s what you’re implying”, Tony shrugged. “Besides, we could use some trust around here, especially you. You need someone you can trust in this world, right? And I’ll gladly be that person”
time, spending so much time on his own, away from everyone else, wishing that Steve was alive, that this didn’t end up that way. And then, he was back. Just like that, the one person that gave him what he really wanted was back.
He watched Tony's curious eyes, gazing around wherever Steve took him, and Tony seemed at ease. Of course, Steve spotted women looking their way, mainly looking at Tony, but such was to be expected, especially due to Tony’s dark looks. His olive skin and dark hair, along with his rugged beard and sharp eyes that were framed delicately by long eyelashes, were a novelty in Athens. How could someone considered to be a demon be so beautiful? Now Steve could see the human in him, and much to his concern, he was falling for him.
