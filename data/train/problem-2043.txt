Another moment of silence and then a bit of gentle splashing.  The image of a nude John settling into a steaming tub has Sherlock scrambling for a distraction.  He hurriedly shucks his clothing and dons his pajamas, taking care to fold his trousers, shirt, and pants and lay them in a neat pile on the desk beneath the window, storing his overnight bag beneath.  On his way back to the bed, Sherlock catches a glimpse of John’s bag, half-open on the couch, and notices that John’s own worn flannel pajama bottoms and plain white t-shirt still sit at the top just beneath the zip.  John didn’t take his clothes into the loo with him, meaning that he will have to either come out here and get them – in a towel – or dress for bed here in the main room.  Where Sherlock would be in bed.  Awake.  With very few options to avoid watching John’s naked body –
“Wade in?
“Sherlock,” John manages, his voice steadier than he could have hoped for, “what is this?”
Sherlock straightens and pulls at his cuffs, clearly pleased with himself.  “Well, predominantly capoeira and—”
John huffs quiet laughter and moves to the sofa, dropping his bag at one end and sitting at the other, elbows folding over his knees so he can lean forward towards the pair of them.  The detective rotates in his chair to face John, pulled inexorably towards him as always, but says nothing further.  After a moment, John raises a hand and strokes his palm over Rosie’s back in small soothing circles, his fingertips brushing against Sherlock’s wrist in rhythmic glances of touch.  The moment feels comfortable in silence but Sherlock’s chest aches.  However much he once might have ridiculed such saccharine musing, he now ponders if perhaps this is why people yearn so desperately to have children with a person they love.  The child curled in Sherlock’s arms is not his own but … but it feels as if she is, as if she lays against his chest because she belongs to him, as if John’s fingers linger on his skin because John belongs to Sherlock as well.  In that moment, he wants so desperately for this notion to be the truth that the force of what he feels for John stifles him.  He presses his cheek back into Rosie’s hair.  He has to hide from John because with the enormity of the feeling, there’s no way he could turn this face to John and expect him not to see.
The tone trends up at the end a minute amount, a question without being a question; John is asking Sherlock to give him a reason to stay.  Sherlock remembers the expression of veiled panic on John’s face when he called Sherlock ‘beautiful’.
He chortles into the other man’s chest.  “How do we even get ourselves into these situations?”
Phew .... that was a lot of information.  Okay, if you're still with me (and I hope that you are), please subscribe to the series and keep your eyes out for more.
Sherlock gives a mirthless chuckle.  “You’ve met me, John; how many men do you believe returned my interest?”
o	Late January/Early February(ish) – Rosie born (extrapolated from discovery of pregnancy in May, approx. 7 months of pregnancy)
“John, perhaps you should let me—” he begins, stepping towards the bed with his arms outstretched again.
“Obviously, my taste is far superior, so really it could only improve—”
“Well, he did have an inside man, as it were, in MI6.  I could understand why he felt a bit cocky.”  John grunts as he drops his overnight case next to the stairs leading up to his bedroom and follows Sherlock into the sitting room.  “Inside woman, I mean; the girl in MI6 who was helping him embezzle.”
“In the heart?”
Sherlock’s voice pitches low and soft and John feels the gentle but insistent pressure of Sherlock’s hand at his shoulder.  He resists looking up at the detective but Sherlock slides his hand down from the shoulder to grip John’s elbow, grasping him firmly enough to telegraph his intention.  John lets himself be pulled away from the sink and steered to a kitchen chair.
Enjoy and don't hesitate to comment (hint hint)
His fingers touch the slim slices across sharp shoulder blades.  “Whipping?  With … a cord of some kind?”
“So then why would you make that assumption?”
and you care for her like a parent.”
“It’s all right, John,” Sherlock replies, his voice low.  He starts to head for the rocker he indicated but then thinks better of it.  “Would you … like some privacy?  I could take Rosie downstairs for—”
“How is it,” John grouses as he sets the carton down in the sitting room, “that after seven years, at least three near-death experiences, two near misses with drug overdoses, a heart-related gunshot injury, and double kidney failure, you can still bound around like a bloody gazelle without showing any signs of tiring?  Especially seeing as how when you’re not in the act of chasing suspects, you lie about on the sofa for days on end, only getting up to play the damn violin?!”
Sherlock turns his face away to hide his grin.
what I did to you.  Least of all you.”
William suddenenly looked rather guilty.
He laid there for a moment, relishing the quiet and the soft sheets, until he smelled smoke coming from the open window above.
“I apologize. I thought you meant Pilar’s baby girl.” He wiped his eyes and drew a long, deep breath. “Penelope.”
It was later than usual when John arrived home. He called out for Sherlock but there was no answer. He searched for him everywhere, and finally found him passed out in their bedroom, sleeping like the dead. John let him sleep and walked through the house, opening the large doors to the ocean and enjoying the first dry day of the year.
“No, I guess my ears are clean because we most definitely have an out-of-tune player. Whoever it is, this is your last chance.”
“He's not a guest, m'lord. He's downstairs. He's requesting to speak to his lordship.”
“Right,” he said. Lestrade winked at Sherlock and motioned for them all to follow. “Come on, I’ve got a surprise for you.”
John shook his head. “That we don’t know. Sherlock’s brother, the Earl of Cornwall, found him working at the British consulate in Munich.” He paused. “Donovan, he’s not the same man. He sustained a head injury. I have no idea what happened, but he suffered severe memory loss. He won’t remember who you are.”
Whose twinckling starrie lights doe never blin to shine on lovely Venus, beauties bed;
“Student dies in mysterious drowning accident,” he quoted. “Carlos P. Powers II, 19, of Nottingham, died yesterday in his dorm room at Cromwell Music Conservatory. Powers, the son of Carlos P. Powers I, British composer and maestro of the Munich Symphony, was found dead at the scene face down in the shower located in his dormitory at the Cromwell student living quarters. Cause of death is ruled drowning. Authorities do not suspect foul play.” John gave the phone back to Sherlock. “That’s awful.”
John hadn’t realized he was crying until he saw one of his tears drop onto the letter. He handed it over to Sherlock, then buried his head in his hands.
He heard John gasped in surprise, their emotions suddenly in sync and all at once overwhelming. John pulled Sherlock close, kissing him, holding him, stroking him.
PLEASE JOHN. MYCROFT.
“Are you alright?”
Full lips found his as he thrusted firmly. Sherlock gasped and moaned quietly, locking wanting glances with John as he writhed, his body consuming the pleasure John was giving.
“No, I do -”
“Read it,” demanded Sherlock. John glanced at the small, thin book in his hand. “Keep it hidden, but read it.”
“Who are you?” he said with a glimmer of admiration.
“They want to show us some gentlemen’s club,” he said. “One drink, and we’ll head back to the room.”
Sherlock sat on the floor in the far corner of the hallway, purposefully out of sight.  He held the Reichenbach Concerto sheet music in his hand, using his mind technique to methodically commit as much of it as possible to memory.
The maestro counted off. The orchestra played the intro, and Sherlock came in, on cue, and nailed the first half of the solo. Brook smiled and Sherlock began to relax. The whole orchestra flowed together well as Sherlock’s solo increased in intensity. Brook sped up the tempo, and Sherlock kept pace, the cool wail of his violin penetrating the moments of silence as the orchestra backed him up.
John drew up on his tiptoes and whispered in the taller man’s ear:
John quickly shook his head. “He wouldn't come,” he answered sadly.
William was convinced the strangler was methodically working his way through employees of the museum to steal the Holy Thorn Reliquary, a piece that had just arrived from the collections of the now deceased Baron de Ferdinand Rothschild. William had greased the palm of the night guard on duty, and they were awaiting his signal as soon as the perpetrator was on the scene.
“Now?”
Sherlock finally stumbled out of the bedroom at almost midnight. His hair was mussed and he was wrapped in a sheet. His bony chest was exposed as were his feet. He carefully padded to the table holding the brandy and poured himself a generous glass. He gulped it down.
“Alright,” he said, knocking his knuckles against the chair. “I will. I'll tell him to fuck off.”
John kept walking. He’d broken his oath of honesty with Felipe, and it was time to come clean.
“Carl grew up half his life in Munich,” said Wiggins. “Musicians knew him from the time he was in grammar school until he graduated secondary.” He shook his head. “It didn’t add up.”
John laughed. “Oh, yes, you are. You stole those vials from my apothecary. Medicine to be used for less fortunate people who really could use it. It’s disgusting.”
“Doctor Canales, Dr. Watson, they’re back.”
John silently admonished himself for getting carried away. He held Sherlock close.
“I am,” he said, his voice cracking.
Victor nodded his head, then froze, the color draining from his face.
And when John removed his gathered fingers from Sherlock’s behind, he wanted nothing more than to be filled up again. John laid back onto the bed, propping up the pillows behind his head and rolling a condom onto his large, stiff penis. He smiled at Sherlock, and then pulled him down into a kiss.
Dimmock entered with the tray. They both took up the steaming cups, gratefully.
“What?”
Will continue to post every Sunday unless I finish a chapter early.
He allowed himself to give into his desire, lazily stroking his body under the sheets, pulling, pressing, massaging between his thighs. He imagined bees and their honey dripping onto Sherlock’s pink, parted lips. John buried his head in his pillow to muffle a groan. He thrusted his hips, his swollen and slicked organ sliding easily through his thick, blunt fingers over and over again. His entire body trembled as the warmth spilt from the top of his fist, running down into his nightshirt and sheets. John continued gently stroking his body, his chest, his neck, riding the after waves of pleasure and basking in his release.
“John?”
A smile quirked at the corner of John’s lips. “May I help you put them on your shelf, m’lord?”
“Is everything out of your mouth a lie?” John said accusingly. “Are you even a real student?”
They locked eyes as Sherlock drew John’s member into his mouth and sucked, then pushed his hips so close to John’s face that his leaking, wet length brushed against his cheek.
John and Sherlock realize they are falling for each other while in Berlin.
“Ah, well. He probably thought it not important. I've lived in Spain for quite some time.”
John was silent for a moment. “I wasn't in service at the time,” he replied carefully.
“Anderson tells me you were using the gas line again in the kitchen.”
“My father’s a writer.”
“Stop,” said Sherlock firmly. “Just, don’t.” He glanced up at John with tired eyes. “You really don’t know, do you?”
Travel was easy by railway back to France, and the short ferry ride to Plymouth found them back in the English countryside. The unusual evening in Berlin seemed less important the closer they got to Cornwall, until one would accidentally catch the other looking longingly at a hand, or a leg, or a neck, or a pair of lips.
Sherlock handed him the snifter filled with brandy and he took a generous gulp.
“Very well,” said the Earl, breaking the silence. “Please excuse me, I have my letters.”
The Spaniard didn’t answer.
Lestrade nodded. “Jean Pierre. He said Sherlock showed up at the schoolhouse a few days ago. He passed out in the doorway with this pinned to his collar.”
“Sherlock,” said John, taking turns wiping down Sherlock and then himself. “Did you really do all this to find a missing pair of headphones?”
Sherlock immediately dropped his hand. He nodded once, obviously embarrassed.
“Was he the first person that you, did he…”
It suddenly all became too much for Sherlock. He began to fidget, then sigh. He tucked his long fingers under his thighs, but his leg continued to bounce without ceasing for a full 3 minutes and John folded like a bad hand in poker.
John hung Sherlock’s suit and jacket on the back of the desk chair. “I think I shall stay here and write. I want to capture the things I saw today while they are still fresh in my mind.”
The Spaniard nodded slowly and grinned. He moved his body, pushing John deeper inside.
Sherlock rolled his eyes, the jab bringing him back to himself. “Oh sod off, Blood,” he said, glancing at the board.  He suddenly has no interest in chess.
“All clean, Mr. Holmes. You should get some rest,” she said, looking down at his arm disapprovingly. “After your long journey and this debacle, you’ll catch an infection if you're not careful.”
“I wouldn’t tell just anyone this, Dr. Watson, but you seem to care for him quite a bit,” said the officer. “How much do you know about what transpired in Transvaal?”
“Oh God,” whispered John, as Felipe held onto his waist. Strong hips up bucked up gently into his behind. John threaded his arms around Felipe’s neck and kissed him hard, his mouth half open as he gasped in time with the rhythmic thrusts.
They both collapsed onto the bed sitting up, backs against the wall.
Sherlock cocked his head. “I didn't hear anyone come to the door.”
As he walked through the doors he stepped onto something, hearing it crunch under his boot. He lifted his foot to find a broken syringe smashed into the sandy dirt. He thought it odd... then his heart stopped beating in his chest.
John paused, then chuckled. “Alright,” he said, nodding. He extended his arm in a sweeping gesture. “After you.”
The words pierced Sherlock's heart like a bullet, realizing his error.
John drew the Browning from his pocket and stormed the crowd, pointing the barrel up in the air and firing two successive shots. The crowd immediately froze and grew quiet. John aimed the weapon at one side while assessing the other. Two of the medical students picked up Felipe and brought him back inside the hospital.
The people were friendly but curious of the Englishman wandering about the square. John stuck out like a sore thumb, with his wool trousers and bowler hat. The air was a bit cool and tickled the exposed skin on his cheeks, but the sun was definitely burning the back of his neck. He decided to venture into a tailor’s shop to inquire about some more suitable clothing.
John reveled in the feel of Felipe’s mouth on his neck, the weight of him on his abdomen. He knew the pleasure Felipe could easily bring to his neglected body. He couldn’t deny that he ached for it.
“Then let me be your partner!”
"Shit," cursed John. "Sherlock, where's your torch?"
“Now this young man’s future hangs in the balance of his doctors,” continued Brook, a tear slipping down his cheek. “Let’s all hope and pray Victor Trevor has a full and speedy recovery, and is back in the concertmaster chair very soon. Let’s have a moment of silence for Victor.”
******
John sat up and rested his arms on his knees. He stared out into the ocean. “My mother died suddenly. I was dismissed soon after.”
He collapsed between Sherlock’s long legs to catch his breath.
John dared to chuckle as Sherlock’s face broke out into a brilliant smile, both men sharing a moment of warmth in the otherwise drafty room.
“God you’re gorgeous,” John whispered hotly in his ear. His free hand disappeared into his crumpled jean pocket to retrieve a tube of chapstick. Sherlock heard it squirt, then felt it being smeared all over his cock by John's steady palm.
He licked and sucked along the tender skin.
“Yes, Mrs. Hudson?” John had just emerged from said bedroom, dressed, ready for breakfast.
Long fingers gripped his thin wrist.
“I just came from the bank,” he said.
John cocked his head to the side. “A what?”
He learned to read and he enjoyed writing. He liked doing his homework, especially when the servants offered to help him around the evening table.
“I meant to ask, who was the woman on horseback with the giant Jesus?” he asked. “She kept giving me strange looks all evening.”
“A surgeon.”
"So," Brooks said, louder than necessary. “You know I'm looking for...players."
Sherlock smiles weakly, and bringing the back of John’s hand to his lips. “I guess I will have a boyfriend in uniform.” Sherlock gives John a smoldering look.
“But why?”
"It doesn’t matter," said Sherlock angrily. "It's over.”
John in turn drew up straight and took a deep breath in doing so. He tugged at his jacket and nodded his head just once, resembling the soldier he’d once been.
“Yes, you did have quite the haul.”
"Ah," said John. "So that means..."
“You see me,” he quietly declared.
Sherlock leaned back, his fingers drawn to his lips in thought. John Watson had surprised him again, when so few did. “I’ve thought about it,” he admitted. “But even I didn’t know there were nancy pubs of ill-repute,” he said, half-jokingly.
“Grocer...the American?” John said incredulously. “Whatever for!”
Days passed. John had no opportunity to read the book as he was never alone. Even in the evenings, with Dimmock snoring just a few metres away he didn’t dare dig into his dresser where the book was hidden.
Sherlock pulled John close and kissed him deeply. He didn't let go for a long, long while.
Sherlock stared at John in disbelief while John blinked back at Sherlock with kind, satiated eyes. John was still a bit out of breath when he finally spoke:
"John?" said Sherlock, between coughs.
“By all means. I need to settle my bill at the inn and visit the tailor.”
Sherlock had already typed again into his phone, this time showing him Carl Powers’s Facebook page.
“Improbable, but not impossible, Watson.”
John’s fingers played in the water. He was ashamed of how he’d behaved. He'd hurt Sherlock - intentionally - and it scared him.
John’s face flushed with embarrassment as his hand continuously rubbed his jaw. “I’m really sorry about this.”
Sherlock glanced at her skeptically. “And that didn't bother you?"
“Ah, a squeaker,” responded the man. He extended his hand. “Victor Trevor.”
“A woman?” John asked, grinning.
Molly made a beeline to the desk.
His face raged with desperate emotion as his fingers clawed at the bedsheets.
John slowed and turned. He looked completely miserable.
“And you feel you’ve found the right subject to study now? Your music?” said Brook with a wave of his pale hand. “Not going to quit this too, are you?”
Sherlock slid his hand across the covers and brushed his fingers against John’s trembling knuckles.
“Sherlock?” he said carefully, his voice gravelly from sleep.
Just then, the marquess walked back into the library...with an older, slow moving dowager marchioness on his arm.
“Call me John.”
Sherlock didn’t need much prepping he was so ready. John eased himself in and Sherlock tensed up and then groaned with pleasure. John rode Sherlock through time and space and pleasure and pain.
Felipe didn’t answer.
“Hey,” said John. “I’m talking weeks, not months yeah?”
The pub was growing more crowded each passing moment.  Sherlock had seen to Victor’s safety, and now sat at the corner of the bar, texting furiously on his phone.
“Excuse me, who are you?” demanded John, making a beeline for Sherlock. He took hold of Brook’s wrist and pulled it out of Sherlock’s shirt. He backed Brook up against the wall.
Felipe wiped his face with his palms. I had to take wine samples to Barcelona. Maria, she remembered you were at the inn. If you hadn’t been here…”
John’s eyes grew wide. “You know them, sir?”
John, not used to being asked his opinion on anything, answered stupidly, “Uh, yeah, fine.”
William buried his hands deep in the pockets of his housecoat, a shadow of worry tinting the unease already etched into his face.
Victor entered right ahead of Professor Brook. He spotted Sherlock and gave him a quick wink as he handed him a music folder, then returned to take his place as first chair. Brook stepped up onto the podium, and took a moment to gaze around at the orchestra, seemingly taking roll call in his head. His eyes finally met Sherlock's. The coal black irises danced in the flourescent lighting.
“Why are you telling me this?” he said softly.
John's eyes were unfocused and red around the rims. It took him a few moments to realize Sherlock had asked him a question.
"Hey there,” said a dark haired, handsome man. He leaned against the bar on Sherlock's left side, a bit too close. "What'll you have?"
“Might as well tell ‘em. It’ll all be in the news soon enough,” said Lestrade.
John looked elated. “Good,” he said. He kissed him and stroked his sweaty curls. "You're brilliant. Amazing. Perfect. I can't believe how brilliant that was."
“How was the village?” he rumbled.
John felt his nostrils flare, the anger coursing through his veins rising to a dangerous level. He stepped in between the unwelcomed stranger and Sherlock.
John’s lungs seized. Pain shot through him and made him groan as if he were dying.
Felipe laughed heartily, reaching for John as he continued to tease him. John smiled, but his lover’s remarks had hit a bit too close to truth. Felipe gently rubbed his knuckles along the blond man’s jaw.
Sherlock squinted. "Oh, please."
“Your Dr. Canales. He’s a very good man.”
Autumn had just settled in, and the gardens bloomed in rusty orange and bright yellow. A path led through green bushes and withering perennials to a group of small, white structures that looked like simple rectangular wooden boxes. The boxes immediately caught William’s eye, and he approached them with a demeanor of disbelief and reverence. John followed behind, hoping for the man’s approval.
John looked up at him suspiciously. “Why?”
Sherlock turned to him to say something, then stopped. "It’s nothing," he said.
“Did you get him off a murder charge?”
Sometimes she’d get caught up in his stare. He wasn’t staring at her of course. He was analyzing his clients like he does, with his fingers tented, pressed against his lips.
“Make me ready,” he pleaded softly. “We have all night. I want to be with you again.”
“Sherlock, there’s something you should know about Raibert,” John said carefully. “He seems simple, and harmless, just a shameless flirt. But he’s manipulative. And selfish. Quite a charlatan, actually.”
“Master Siger has grown into a fine young man, m’lord,” said John, pleased to see the boy in good health, but rather confused at why he was being asked to watch the boy play catch with his dog.
The bullet had obviously entered from his back, with the exit wound just under his collarbone. A nasty, jagged scar started at the top of his shoulder and led down into his chest. Scar tissue surrounded the entirety of the scar, puffy, pink and tough. Patches of hair were completely missing from his chest and abdomen where scars from shrapnel peppered his right side. His right arm had a series of symmetrical scars, most likely from cuts made by doctors for blood letting.
“Mm,” Sherlock mumbled. “Could you be more specific.”
John guided them both to the bed, and pushed Sherlock down into the mattress as he crawled on top, kissing him and manhandling him, pulling at his trousers and undressing him with practiced ease. Sherlock seemed to short-circuit, engrossed in John’s lips and doing little else to help the process, letting the older man control the pace and the flow.
John led the way into the hospital, but once inside the ward, Ahad was immediately at his side.
John’s mouth expertly worked his prick up and down as he gently fucked the younger man's tight center with care. Sherlock lost his breath as the fingers brushed against an intimate place deep inside of him, causing fireworks in his cock and pleasure to radiate through his arse and thighs.
Sherlock jerked, and felt the heat rising in his cheeks.
Sherlock looked longingly at the hall, then back at John.
The Earl glanced up at Peter, who quietly took his leave, closing the bedroom door behind him.
Sherlock looked at John thoughtfully. “It felt like we were making love.” Then he grinned. “Well, in the beginning.”
Things get dark, folks.
Stay tuned for the final segment "Baron Your Secrets" to be published early 2017.
Sherlock turned and looked at him, his gaze piercing in the candlelight.
“Alright.”
Sherlock sat up just a bit against the headboard. He reached up and pulled at the string on his nightshirt, letting it unravel in his fingertips.
Scarce had the morning Starre hid from the light
John assessed him coolly. He licked his lips.
The young Sherlock completely deflates, throwing his bow down on the music stand and collapsing heavily into his chair.
“Wish we were going on holiday in Ibiza,” mumbled John.
Then, with the slightest move of his index finger and baton, Brook engaged the orchestra.
“Louder.”
“Actually, it is necessary,” snapped John.
“I have no idea. But Felipe,” said John, growing impatient. “I don’t have the credentials. Like I told you before, I’m not even a doctor.”
“Take care, alright? I’ll be back before you know it.” he says, misty-eyed.
The next section of the garret opened up into a wide space, as pristine and sterile as the apothecary had been cluttered and unclean. The layout resembled a Greek style theater, with benches forming a half circle looking over a small, round center, where a simple wooden slab around six feet long sat perched in the middle.
John’s eyebrows rose. “Uh, yeah, right again.”
His voice startled Sherlock, who quickly turned and began coughing. He finally got a hold of himself and said, “What time is it?”
“Oh, to be a first year again,” chuckled Wiggins. He pointed a thumb at his chest, and smiled. “Lead trombone in Concert band. Found a position with the philharmonic come January.”
The Spaniard had left him again. At least this time, he had said goodbye.
“I wasn’t expecting anyone, I suppose.”
The end.
William nodded.
“Are you boys alright?” said an old, shaky voice.
“Raibert was home from college,” said John. “He stopped by the house about the time I got home from school. Mum was out, worked the night shift, Harry, of course, had been gone for years by then. Raibert had this bartender book, we made these drinks, White Russians I think. I was right pissed.” John’s face changed as he continued. He became melancholy. “I let him fuck me face down on my own bed.” John looked up, remembering. “Years later at a family reunion the cousins all went out and got pissed and we found out Raibert had fucked us all. Boys, girls.” He shook his head. “Except for Harry. She wanted nothing to do with him, old girl.”
“All yours,” he said. When Sherlock refused to take it, he threw it in his lap and walked away, slamming the door to the second bedroom behind him.
“Sherlock?”
“Certainly.” John pulled at his cufflinks and removed his shirt. “But for now, I’m washing my face and having a kip. And you should join me.”
A series of loud knocks at the door startled him. He dropped the blanket onto the floor.
Raibert picked him up and pinned him against the wall. Sherlock heard himself groan as he scrambled to grip the Scotsman’s huge powerful shoulders. A warm, slick tongue licked his neck, his nipples. Teeth gently scraped his pectorals. He wrapped his long legs around the giant's hips as his head fell back and hit the wall hard.
He stroked his hair until the young nobleman fell asleep.
“It’s not obvious, if you’re worried,” said Sherlock, picking up his violin case. “Your accent is near perfect when speaking English.”
The middle-aged man raked a calloused hand through his graying copper hair. “He expects a surgeon, so he can boast about the theater he funded. I respectfully request that you attend in my stead.”
Sherlock took a long drag and exhaled, smoke billowing from his lips. He immediately felt better.
Later, at that point in time where night begins to turn into day, Felipe reached for John in the darkness of the bedroom.
John looked back and forth between the doctor and his mother, his face filled with grief. “What should I do?”
John was lost in the admiration of Sherlock’s body when nimble fingers began unbuttoning his pyjama bottoms. John immediately backed away.
“Let’s get out of here,” said John, pulling on Sherlock’s jacket.
The Game is On...
“For you, I'd go through it all again.”
Sherlock was utterly, irrefutably infatuated.
-----------------------
? she thought.
John took a deep breath and released it, obviously moving on for Sherlock's sake. “7am tomorrow. A young girl named Sam. I met her this morning,” he said, his eyes deep in thought. “We’re repairing a heart defect she was born with. After the surgery, she’ll be able to run and jump and swim like a normal kid.” He smiled to himself. “Sometimes I wonder how I got so lucky, getting to do the things I do.”
“Surgery?” he whispered. “It’s one thing to let me run the apothecary, but this - ”
“Ahad,” John said. “Come with me.”
“Bloody, drafted, bootlicking, blazing bull tits typhoid,” slurred John. “Fuck all.” He sighed and slumped heavily against the wall.
“I’m in?” Sherlock repeated, confused.
They ate a supper of fresh eggs and bacon. John made William clean up while he checked the hearth in William’s bedroom. He stacked the kindling and checked the flue, and soon he had a fire roaring and crackling in the tiny bedroom. He pulled the door shut behind him keep to the room warm.
Sherlock stepped out into the hallway, closing the door behind him.
He didn't answer, but walked over to John and laid down on the bed with him. John shivered a little from the chilly air still present on the detective’s clothes.
“No, no it’s not.” He licked his lips and tried to think of a way he could make him understand. He closed his eyes in thought. “Being a surgeon, a healer, a soldier makes me happy, gives me a purpose.”
It was William’s deerstalker.
******
The sun was bright as they made their way up the winding dirt path. Their pace was slow and leisurely as they enjoyed the greenery and shimmering lake below. Their activities from the night before had caused a bit of soreness. They would catch the other grimacing at certain points on the trail, especially when it became particularly steep. One would giggle and the other would join in, and then they would stop to rest and take generous swings from their canteen.
“I see,” answered Sherlock, grinning. “So, out with it. What did he think?”
“I received your telegram and left immediately from Cornwall. I was hoping by the time I arrived this would have all worked itself out. Sherlock would be sitting here, in this room, awaiting my arrival with a smirk, pleased to see that his big brother did care enough to drop everything to come to his aid. I was prepared to never live it down.”
“His note is disrespectful,” he murmured.
Later that day, like he had done a dozen times before, John sat down next to Sherlock on the small cot. He pressed his palm to a pale forehead.
-------------------
John hesitated, then stepped inside, more or less just to get out of the cold wind blowing straight through him.
**I should have known, a fucking Englishman. Jean Pierre, I should murder you.
John took a deep breath and approached the table.
“You - heard us.”
When he’d first arrived home after the fall, he tried to enter their bedroom. He opened the door, and the smell of Sherlock’s lavender sachets made his knees give out. Miss Turner found him doubled over on the hardwood floor. She helped him up and sat him down in the parlour and gave him a good stiff drink. He accepted it gratefully and drank it down in a few gulps.
Felipe sat with his back up against one of the pillars, looking out across the city. The sun was bright but the ledge was shaded and cool. Felipe’s white shirt whipped in the wind, exposing his broad chest in patches. His fingers played with his full lips as he appeared lost in thought.
“Thank you. Bass. Five bars from 59.”
“No, Dr Watson, I haven’t seen him since this afternoon.”
It was half past nine when William began to wane. John had led him into the bedroom and pushed him into the bed, throwing the covers haphazardly over his long legs.
John smiled at the simple command. Sherlock’s skin was rosy pink from the hot bath, his curls damp and frizzy against the pillow. His eyes sparkled at him in the dimly lit room. He looked angelic.
“Name’s Watson. John Watson,” said the man. He held out his hand for Sherlock, and Sherlock gingerly shook it.
“What's your name?”
John tasted one of his own tears as he opened his lips. Felipe’s talented tongue moved languidly over his own in an attempt to draw him out.
He settled for a hand on a shoulder. He squeezed reassuringly.
John, out of breath, emerged from the original passage. “Sherlock, what the hell…” He stopped and looked around, amazed no one was there. “Where’d he go?” he asked earnestly. His cheeks were bright red, his chest heaving.
“Here, lie down,” he murmured, cradling his head.
"Famished."
John’s outburst made the soldiers stop and turn. The ward went silent. Felipe appeared at the end of the hall.
“I don’t know!”
John explored the depths of the face before him. He noticed the crows feet around those almond-shaped eyes had grown more prominent, and the laugh lines around his full mouth had deepened. His high cheekbones were flushed with color and the bright eyes that stared back at him were full of fire and longing. But there was something else he could detect as well, something he’d never picked up on before; a wisdom, forged from pain, and a peacefulness that came with submitting to life’s tragical whims. It wasn’t just Sherlock he was seeing anymore, but a man who had pushed beyond the point of his struggles to forge something - someone - new.
Sherlock leaned forward to help, but John pinned him to the wall with this forearm. Sherlock could do nothing but watch his love writhe in pleasure and pain from his own making, his knees bent and thighs stretching and grinding over his own.
“You should take off those pressed clothes,” mumbles Sherlock, pulling him close. “We don’t want them to get wrinkled.”
“Watson,” said Sherlock, startled. He immediately started towards him. Dimmock reached down and helped John back to his feet. Sherlock picked up his cane and handed it back to the valet, who was obviously humiliated. “Are you alright?”
That now is ripe, and full of honey-berries;
(See the end of the chapter for
“I've often wished that had been my fate,” he whispered.
Suddenly, strong arms had him by the chest and mouth, and he was dragged across the floor the short distance to the men’s loo.
“Berwick,” he replied. “Albert and Sara Stuart.”
John steeled himself for the impending introductions and possible recognition. Sherlock had told him ad nauseum how much he didn’t resemble the John of years’ past, but he was still positive the name with a face would surely draw attention from the dowager.
John was silent for a long time. He seemed far away, deep in thought. He started to speak, changed his mind, then changed his mind again and said, “Raibert had me. When I was sixteen.”
“Inspector,” John said. “What brings you by this late hour? Did you apprehend our strangler?”
“Johnny,” she said, holding back tears. “The steward came by with your wages. And here, the cook packed you enough food to last the week.”
He received a response within a fortnight.
Sherlock’s ears felt hot in the cold wind. “Yes, cheers,” he answered shyly. He self-consciously looked up and down the street, deriving his bearings. “Any chance you’re hungry?”
“No,” Sherlock responded curtly, cutting him off before he could finish. “And I would not be happy here.” He stood and placed his cup back on the silver tray. “I’m not interested in dalliances with strangers or anything of the sort. I have my work. I am glad to be going home.”
Gently, he gathered Felipe by his waist and turned him around. John kissed him messily, his tongue fucking Felipe's mouth like the blunt fingers sliding in and out of his arse. Felipe writhed against him, his hard prick trapped and leaking all over John's stomach.
Sherlock shifted a bit, his head still sore, his arse, he realized, even more so.
“Evening,” said John. “This is a turn-up, isn’t it Sherlock?”
Sherlock seemed to realize this, and let go of his hand.
“What is it?” Sherlock finally asked.
John’s laughter trailed off as he thought about the question. Had he been sober, he would have panicked at how fully unprepared he was to discuss the matter. Apart from the actual scandalous facts, John was sure Mycroft had purposely left him out of the narrative that was Sherlock’s life. Why he wasn’t sure, but most likely it was due to his desire to protect his younger brother from becoming overwhelmed.
He felt as if he were floating.
Ten years they had been in London, living in a cozy little flat together with Mrs. Hudson and her delicious biscuits and coffee. John was living a life he thought not possible. He had his practice and he was writing again, and the love of his life, his brilliant, striking Sherlock, second son of an Earl and the most exciting, perplexing, infuriating man he’d ever known, had been by his side the entire time.
“I don't know.”
“I lie in bed and night after night,” he said, his eyes drifting over John as a beautiful, pink flush worked its way up his long, pale neck . “And I think of you -”
“It would just be for a couple of months, until I can get whatever it is straightened out.”
Sherlock gasped and squirmed against John’s still fully clothed frame, his naked, narrow thighs pressing into the well worn fabric of his clothing, his bare chest caressed by a soft, fuzzy jumper. Sherlock licked his lips in anticipation as he watched John undo his jeans with his free hand and push his pants down to release his huge erection. His other hand squeezed Sherlock’s wrists together even tighter.
Soft, warm lips pressed against his own.
“It’s not far,” said John.
“I could write him back and tell him I'm not coming.”
He squeezed John’s hand gently.
"No, go ahead, talk about him," said Sherlock, his speech slightly slurred. "Doesn’t bother me."
After realizing Sherlock was alive - actually breathing alive - John had immediately barricaded his emotions, even potential ones, in order to keep a clear head.  Some intense anger had punched through along with a bit of sadness, but he had been successful overall in that his brain had chosen to shut down, leaving him passed out cold in the library (of that he was rather embarrassed).
John awoke with a start. It was dead silent, and the shadows falling over the room signaled the sun had recently set. As he sat up, he startled at a figure standing in front of the window.
“No, nothing. I apologize for interrupting your evening.”
He pulled him away and told him to dry his tears. He reached into his pocket and pulled out a small purse.
“Mrs. Hudson has a sister that lives in Provence that she's always wanted to visit. And Edinburgh has an incredible facility that keeps a supply of fresh cadavers for scientific research.”
“Oh, God,” sighed John, his head falling back as Felipe firmly moved his hand over his growing erection. “Now I'm definitely not going.”.
An unusually intense winter storm hit in late February and due to the weather, stopped all trains in and out of Edinburgh. Communication grinded to halt for a week as telegraph lines were compromised by the ice and sleet that followed the snow. It was treachery for John to simply walk to the hospital; he couldn’t imagine what it was like on the railways. He wrote a letter a day to Sherlock in Alnwick, hoping it might be delivered by rider at some point before the ice thawed.
As they approached the main museum entrance, John tried the door. It was locked.
Sherlock reveled in the safety of John's presence on top and inside of him. He raised his head to take in his lips one last time before he fell apart and released into his lover's fist. Rainbows filled his vision as he bucked and writhed underneath him, reveling in his thrusts and caresses.
“John Watson, you’re the bravest, wisest, kindest man I’ve ever met,” he says endearingly.
“We definitely don’t have time for that,” John chuckles. “Did Lestrade give you some more cases?”
Sherlock stared into the black soullessness of the madman’s eyes.
Felipe had laid down onto his stomach and was hanging over the side, shining the lantern down into the infrastructure of the bridge.
He didn’t breath as he pressed two fingers against his long, pale neck.
Could it be?
“You’re beautiful,” whispered John. He couldn’t help bringing his hand up to cup Sherlock’s jaw.
“But I was, Felipe. It’s alright.” John reached over and patted his knee gently. “Is Pilar a friend, family?”
"Alright?"
John’s eyes grew wide. “That’s the office the tunnel led too...that’s his office.” Sherlock didn’t confirm nor deny, so John continued. “Don’t play dumb, Sherlock. I saw the nameplate.”
“Not very original.”
John froze. He wasn’t sure if he wanted to hear the answer.
Roberts suppressed a sigh. “Yes, m’lord, whatever you wish.”
Donovan pulled him to his feet. He leaned into the Inspector who helped him to the stairs.
John held onto him the rest of the night.
Brook hovered over Sherlock, stopping and starting, insisting the tempo was compromised over and over again. He sauntered back up to the front of the room and placed his hand on a spare wooden chair.
He looked straight at Sherlock.
“Quite,” smirked Mycroft. “Up for finishing the game, loverboy? It won’t take long.”
Felipe walked in as far as the waiting room and stopped, a look of concern on his weathered, handsome face.
Sherlock opened his eyes and exhaled. “John, you're so big. I need to get used to you.” He moved his hips ever so slightly. John gasped and rose up. “Trust me,” Sherlock said softly, pushing him back down. “Let me do this. Lie back.”
Mycroft had told his brother on more than one occasion that caring was not an advantage and that sentiment was a form of weakness. Sherlock had chosen to subscribe to this same school of thought, though his desire for a friend, a partner, even -God forbid -a lover, had always been there, buried deep inside him, covered up by a brilliant, freight train of a brain and a thick layer of cynicism.
“You’re safe,” he said. “Just rest for a moment. Get your bearings.”
John took the small envelope. He smiled back at Mr. Thomas.
John read it with a furrowed brow.
One Saturday afternoon in October, Miss Turner knocked firmly on Dr. Watson’s bedroom door.
It was then that the Earl made his entrance.
Sherlock walked alongside the cart, his gaze fixated on John, refusing to give in, convinced he could still make him listen to reason.
Instruments at ready, the orchestra was silent, awaiting the baton to strike and to begin again.
“Would you like a drink?”
“What you did for Pilar...”
Mr and Mrs Thomas had recently married in a small ceremony in London, and had chosen to settle in Berwick upon Tweed. This meant John and William had been on their own and had eaten out practically every meal. The dirty teacups that had piled up in the sink were quite a point of contention between the two men, so it had been a relief to leave the flat and head south to Sussex Downs. Stamford had offered up the free housing. It was a cottage owned by his late uncle, who had been the village doctor for 40 years and had never married. He’d built the cottage himself, and had been quite a fixture in the community until his passing the year before.
“Move, John,” commanded Sherlock. John’s hips snapped up and pushed back into Sherlock harder than he intended. His lover cried out and squeezed his fingers tightly. “More,” he said breathlessly.
His bloody gun was
“NOW!” Roberts bellowed.
“Oh my God, Sherlock,” he said, his chest expanding but no air filling his lungs. “I can’t...I just….”
Brooks looked at him like he was the stupidest creature to ever walk the Earth.
The Spaniard rose from the chair and turned to Mr Thomas.
Sherlock held out his arm and motioned for him to come inside. “Come, Walter, I’ll show you.”
“Are you finished?” he said calmly.
The heat between them was growing despite their wishes.
John smiled then, and no sooner had Sherlock closed the door behind him that John fell into bed, asleep as his head hit the pillow.
John felt his whole chest flush with desire. He watched with anticipation as the Spaniard licked him again, then wrapped his glistening lips around the head of his sex.
“We’re supposed have a full moon tonight, not that we’ll get to see it” said Mr Thomas.
Sherlock turned to see Brook casually leaning against the doorway, his hands in his pockets. The maestro’s tongue clicked in disapproval.
"I bet," John hid his smile behind a cough. "And you come to Postman’s Park often? To play chess with your brother and mother?"
“To bed,” he finally answered. He turned back and gave John a tired smile. “Don’t wake me up to fuck me this time.”
"I don't understand, it's not that hard!!" he whined. He walked around Sherlock twice, before unleashing a second strike with the baton along his shoulder blades.
WIP, will post every Sunday, sooner if I complete the chapter ahead of time.
John maintained that barricade. Until now.
Mycroft sat back against the chair and sighed. For moment, he resembled the Earl.
Sherlock deftly slipped two fingers into the good doctor's still slick and come-buttered ass. John moaned deeply and reached back with both arms to grip the top of the table. His hips snapped and jerked as Sherlock held on, determined to work John thoroughly with his filthy pink swollen lips and slender fingers still sliding in and out of his tight asshole. Sherlock swallowed him dry, releasing him only after he had stopped shaking.
*******
“Please, she's not some helpless old lady.” Sherlock seethed, his indignation glowering through narrowed eyes.”She must pay for her deceit .”
He looked warily at John, expecting a fight.
“Where is this wine from?” he asked, desperate to stop the growing heat in his chest.
They kissed and necked and explored each other, finally collapsing onto the sofa. Sherlock rolled on top of John’s smaller, compact frame and gathered his stiff, large member alongside his own, wrapping his long fingers around them both. Quick breaths and low, satisfied groans followed as they both rutted madly against each other, lips crashing together over and over until one released, the other following immediately after.
“Sherlock!” exclaimed Victor. A look of genuine concern filled his face, his dimples all but disappearing. “Are you alright?” He placed a hand tenderly on Sherlock’s shoulder. “We’ve missed you at the Monday night sessions.” He placed his wax back inside his case and shut it, his violin and bow tucked under his arm. He lowered his voice. “I know it’s tough right now, but it will get better. I promise.”
Sherlock crumbled with desperate need, his eyes glistening with conflicting emotions as John turned Sherlock onto his side and held him tightly against him. He licked the shell of Sherlock's ear, and whispered hotly:
The chip & fish shop was unbearably tiny, warm, and crowded, but Molly didn’t seem to notice as she cuddled up next to Sherlock as they awaited their order. She closed her eyes to concentrate on his intoxicating scent: a mix of tobacco, bergamot and high-end cologne tinged with the London air wafted past her nose, temporarily blocking the pungent odor of the grease fryers only a few meters away.
Sweat poured from his forehead as he opened his eyes, nodding his head. It was no use denying it. He resigned himself to the humiliation he was feeling.
Sherlock reached over and undid the lock. His was hair wild, his eyes swollen, his body weak. "You’d break your shoulder before the door would give," Sherlock couldn’t help saying.
"John, are you going to...ahh..."
They traipsed up the servant's stairs and through the narrow hall to the great hall and walked down the gleaming wooden floors to the library. Mr Frank entered and introduced John to the marchioness, who was sitting regally on a settee and drinking a cup of tea.
Sherlock had grown quite fond of Molly. His treatment of her had gentled over time; much more so after the Christmas 2012 debacle, where Sherlock found himself chastising Molly in front of her colleagues about her secret crush, only to find out he was the object of her affection. He was relieved to learn that in his absence she had in fact moved on with her life. Besides the ring on her finger, Molly seemed happier, healthier and more confident that he ever remembered her being.
“I’ll have you know, you ungrateful boy, that Mrs Turner and I plan on marrying, soon. So there!”
“Please,” he whispered. “I've reconciled the fact I will never take the place of him in your heart. I'll never be the wisest man you've ever known. I can't compete with the legend of Sherlock Holmes because I'll never win.”
“I’m staying with friends of the family. I’ve known Lady Katherine since I was a boy,” said Sherlock. “It’s not like I’ll be roughing it with you in Edinburgh.” He wrapped his long arms around his former valet. “I won't be without you again. It’s only a few hours train ride into the city. I’ll visit, you’ll visit, and then eventually, when I’m stronger and you’re settled…” Sherlock brushed his lips against John’s.
Sherlock gazed at John for a long moment, and whispered, "I love it when you say that."
“I paid it.”
“It would mean a great deal to me if you’d call me Sherlock,” he said.
“Let him go,” John growled. “Or I’ll blow your brains out.”
His thoughts kept drifting to the water sloshing in the next room. Long, pale legs bent to fit into the edges of the oblong container, soapy hands lathering up a pale, muscular chest, sweeping over two dusky pink nipples erect from the cold air...
“Come inside me, John,” Sherlock whispered back.
John whispered again into his ear: “Have you ever fucked anyone?”
Their eyes locked; then they both laughed.
That’s basically all he remembered.
As the three men entered the courtyard, two were shocked to find police cars, a fire engine and an ambulance all parked with lights flashing in front of the old main hall.  One entire side of the entrance’s landscaping had been completely pulled, including the thick ivy that once hung over the now exposed ancient doorway. Men and women in hazmat suits walked in and out of the entrance carrying debris and evidence from below.
“No…”
“Mycroft had been lying to me for months about London. I could tell you wanted to tell me the truth.”
They both sat in silence for a long time. Sherlock, visibly upset to learn of his lover’s hardships, turned and scooped John into his long arms.
Sherlock’s chin rose as his eyes stayed transfixed on Molly’s.
"Yes?"
“Yes! Mycroft’s younger brother!” John saw Sherlock stiffen a bit out of the corner of his eye. “How is the old devil?”
----------------
“I can’t delay any longer,” he said, a bit of regret in his voice. “My men have indulged me, but now it’s time we head home.”
“That,” he panted, “was insane.”
"I ask you why you stopped playing," he said "And your version of an answer was to turn into a wind-up monkey playing the fiddle." He groaned into his hands. "You're all the same."
“What did Brook say, exactly?”
John gasped loudly at the contact, pushing him over the edge as his hips worked his thick cock through his fist over and over again in short, hard thrusts. Sherlock eagerly watched his release, coming in spurts and running along his abdomen, soaking into his pants and staining Sherlock’s expensive sheets.
“Given how badly I tend to trample nearly everyone else?” Sherlock offers wryly.
“Dada.  Luff.”
John finds himself at a loss to respond so he just nods and turns to go.  A cab stands just outside the front entrance with its side door open, Sherlock already crowded to the far side with his face buried in his phone.  John ducks inside, careful not to jostle Rosie too much as he sits.  At least five solid minutes go by in silence as London whips by them.  Despite the detective’s front of complete absorption in his phone, John sees that Sherlock’s eyes haven’t changed focus since John sat down.
“I don’t
Sherlock stares at the words “you are never alone” for an indeterminate amount of time.  In the back of his head he hears a loop of all of the voices that have spat the word “freak” at him over the years; this aspect of himself always just seemed to be one more way that perhaps the masses were right about him.  And yet, that tidy scrawl of four words in John’s tight handwriting – small, bold, and consistent; so much like the man himself – somehow dulls the roar.  The cascade of usernames and posts stands stark in his hand, a testament to John’s assertion: these people are like him; they feel what he feels; they understand.  And so, it seems, does John.  The piece of paper quivers in his grip and he isn’t aware that a single tear track snakes its way down his face until he feels small fingers on his hand.
be that.  John cares for him very deeply – of this, Sherlock remains absolutely certain – but if John actually felt that, surely he wouldn’t be exhibiting so many behaviors that push Sherlock away?  John is many things, but never a
“It wasn’t—” Sherlock begins to hedge but John won’t have it.
Rosie rolls her eyes and this time, the expression is so very Sherlock.
John stutters to a stop when he sees Sherlock standing in the middle of the room gawping at his phone.  “What’s the matter?” he asks, bending to scoop up Rosie and deposit her on the couch with her tiger.
John blushes.  “Good thing nobody’s here to see this.”
“Why not?”
John raps his knuckles against the door.  “Sherlock?  I’m looking for Rosie’s medical records, have you seen them?  I was sure I put them in the top drawer of the desk but they’re not there ….”
Present tense.  And you said you
“Wosie.”
sometimes – not often, but sometimes – it deepens into an appreciation for the body.”
John gapes at him, well familiar with this voice: it’s the one he uses when he either wants to coax a power-drunk suspect into thinking he’s weak or a hysterical victim into sympathizing and divulging key facts.  What he can’t figure out is why Sherlock is pretending that he was the one to douse Rosie on accident.
“—looked like curtains my grandmother would buy at Oxfam,” Sherlock retorts.  “For God’s sake, John, at lease press your nose up against the window of Burberry, would you?  It’s the least you could do if you’re going to be seen with me.  The
“And now you know
Sherlock’s mouth drops open.  His jaw works as he tries to cobble together something to say, but nothing comes out.  Nothing he can think of seems enough.  John recovers much faster than Sherlock, though.  He hauls himself to his feet, gently releasing his grip on Sherlock’s hands.  Just the tips of the fingers on John’s left hand skim up from Sherlock’s hand, over his wrist, up his arm and lift off near his shoulder.  John’s fingers curl open in the air next to Sherlock’s cheek but when Sherlock gazes up into John’s face, tilting his head quizzically, the fingers clench shut again, flex a few times in the air, and then dart away. Sherlock can’t decide if he’s disappointed.
As always, a huge thanks to my beta
“Twelve hours,” John spits.  “Christ, you’d been beaten and broken and it was all still raw and I just—you just let me—?! Jesus, will I ever stop brutalizing you?”
The joke falls flat but Sherlock gives a tight smile anyway.
Sherlock nods, eyes wide, and then mumbles, “Of course.  Well … goodnight, John,” in an unsteady voice.
, and worse yet, he has absolutely no concrete evidence to support either train of thought.  He strides across the room and picks up his violin, hacking away at the strings atonally for a few moments before deciding on a piece.  Something energetic and violent, he thinks, to give vent to his anxiety and agitation.
John chuckles but doesn’t let the blatant distraction tactic derail him from his point.  “Your parents dote on her already.”
o	August(ish) - events of His Last Vow: Sherlock shot; confrontation at Leinster Gardens; John and Mary 'separate'
“John,
“I’m not,” his brother says far too quickly.
“Yeah, maybe.”
“What were you looking at?” John continues doggedly.  “Something for a case?”
“Huh,” John mutters.  “I would have thought she’d have better taste.”
in an endless loop of babble.
“But—” Sherlock begins.
“Great!” she says in the same chipper tone.  “Can you tell me what happened then?”
Sherlock tries to keep his face still.  “John’s been acting odd lately.  It’s … an experiment.”
Although he’s a bit ashamed that he’s avoiding this conversation with a not-quite-two-year-old, John hitches her up from his lap and settles her back into the pushchair.
John returns his hot stare.  “I’d punch you if the blood wouldn’t freeze on my hand and make me even colder.”
“She thinks I’m her
The experiment data from earlier in the day can’t keep his attention, though.  As a matter of fact, he can’t help but sift through the change in John’s behavior over and over in his head; try as he may, he can’t make it coalesce into any coherent pattern or conclusion.  The only idea he keeps coming back to, unfortunately, are the words from Mary’s last message:
Sherlock knows what John is really trying to ask but he can’t come right out and acknowledge it, so he hedges for a safer, ambiguous answer.  Still true, anyway.  “Never as an adult either,” he says.
there was no canonical mention of his age; however, I recently came across a screengrab from the "Hat Man and Robin" article in Scandal in Belgravia, which lists him as "John Watson, 37", which means at the start of the series, he is 36 with a birthdate of March 31, 1974 (the March 31 birthday is ACD canon).
Normally John would have ignored him and carried on with the last few but he’s too upset to focus.  He chucks the dirty needle in the direction of the med kit and stomps out of the lavatory without a second look, resolved to let Sherlock clean up the mess for once.  It takes nearly an hour’s walk around circling nearby streets to clear his head but once he does, John realizes the full measure of what an arse he’d been.  Sherlock scared him and took unnecessary risk, no question, but it doesn’t excuse his reaction to it, especially not when he’d been so determined to change how he deals with his anger after what he did to Sherlock at the hospital last spring.  The worst part about it is that when he returns to Baker Street to apologize with his tail firmly tucked between his legs, Sherlock won’t let him get through it.
“Develop a particular affinity for
He can’t help the angry edge to his words when he strides towards the stairs.  “She’s starting to blister; we’re going to have to take her to the A&E.  I’m going to get her dressed and I’ll be down in five minutes.  Have a cab waiting.”
John glares up at him and spits back without thinking.  “Because someday your luck is going to run out, Sherlock.  I’ve had to watch you die right under my fingers twice now, I’m damn well not going to do it again. Someday you’ll insult another nutter with a gun just a shade too much and it’ll be
“What’s the matter?” John asks and his voice sounds rough, as if he hasn’t used it in days.
Sherlock huffs a bit of a laugh and flips to the second page John left.  It’s nothing but a list of usernames and the beginnings of sentences which takes Sherlock a moment to parse as a screenshot of forum post links.  Every single listing on a page of at least thirty items – with numbers at the top to indicate that this is the first page of fifty-seven – of postings by people who identify as demisexual discussing how this affects their lives.  Sideways along the margin, John has written again.
“Rosie loves Papa?” John prods.
“Sorry, gents,” the blonde woman manning the desk says with an apologetic expression.  “It’s been a big weekend, seeing as how it’s Christmas in a few days.  Everyone home for the holidays and all, so we only have the Attic Room free.  It’s a double bed and there’s a couch in there, so hopefully you can make it work?”
“As if you become a gypsy right in front of my eyes.  You’ve always been high energy but when you play, you just … come alive in such a different way.  You’re beautiful,” John finishes in a hush.
John,” Sherlock entones, clearly implying that John is a simpleton for not figuring it out.  “She’s mistaking me for you.”
Sherlock snaps his gaze up to John but now he won’t meet Sherlock’s eyes.  “What do you mean by that?”
John hands a nappy through the door once he’s slid on his dressing gown, jogging up the stairs to prepare to head out on an adventure.
For whatever reason, it does the trick.  Sherlock wakes like a lightning strike, thrashing against John’s tight hold on him, his eyes snapping open and wheeling around the room in panic.
Sherlock remonstrates and makes a ‘get on with it’ gesture with one hand.
Sherlock quirks a brow at him with that infuriating
“Sherlock, do you care for Rosie?” he interrupts firmly.
“I thought we weren’t going to lie to each other anymore, Sherlock.”
“—just until you calm down.  I will sit with her in that chair,” he motions to the rocker a few feet away in the corner, “just until you feel more settled and then I will give her back immediately.”
Sherlock brings his eyes to meet John’s; John feels routed to his chair as the realization sinks in.  How John remains upright in his chair as Sherlock’s eyes search his face is a complete mystery.  The warmth of his body radiating over John’s skin makes John realize that he must have stood up and closed the distance between them at some point but he honestly has no recollection of doing it.
Sherlock digests this and turns his gaze to where the little girl’s eyes still stream fat tears that soak the shoulder of John’s t-shirt.  John’s pace is relentless as he rocks and the child clearly doesn’t appreciate it.
Sherlock admittedly may be an arrogant arse but he really doesn’t think he deserves this sort of torture.  Then again, the thought is insanely irritating when he recalls that he engineered this situation on purpose for some reason.  He doesn’t have any masochistic tendencies that he’s aware of, but this predicament may cause him to reevaluate that.  Although, in his own defense, he engineered this situation before he became aggravatingly aware of what John looks like naked.
“No!” John says hoarsely.  He looks away for a moment then gazes back to Sherlock.  “No.  Please … please stay.”
Sherlock lets the high, trilling note linger, his bow still moving in continuous strokes as he turns to regard John.  He knows what he must look like to the doctor: flushed about the cheeks, sweating lightly, scowling to high heaven; and yet, John just quirks a small smile at him.
“Observe, John.  You tell me.”
John trails into silence, gazing up at Sherlock in the golden beam from the street lamp outside (when did it get dark enough for a street lamp?).  Sherlock feels himself wavering forward onto the balls of his feet, leaning towards the end of John’s sentence.
“You,” John says at once.  He moves across the room and settles in his armchair, scouring Sherlock’s face as the man stands in front of him. “Play me something of yours.  I want to hear you play you.”
“Must I?”
and you know how deadly dull most people are.  Besides, because I experience attraction and desire so rarely, the feeling of being attracted to someone … for me, it’s very unsettling, John.  Bewildering, even.  Easier to simply ‘meet the need’ on my own than pursue it.”
Sherlock screeches to a halt, both verbally and physically, and he can feel the redness climb from his chest to his face as he stares.  And stares.  And he can’t seem to do much more than that, despite the scrambling going on in front of him.  He just clutches the knob of the loo door and blinks in surprise.
“Not entirely.”  The detective stares forward at the wall for a moment then regards John.  “You seemed to need it.”
“—by the sound of the clinking change in her handbag or something,” John continues with a rueful grin.  “So it’s just you and me then.  Any requests?”
had to stop me killing my best friend.  Even after everything you’d done, I still—”
“I’m a man,” Sherlock says, rather stating the obvious.
Sherlock makes a show of gazing at his watch and then back at John.  “Two hours and eleven minutes since you walked in the door and fifty-three minutes after dinner.  I must admit, your restraint really has improved dramatically.  That’s thirty-seven minutes longer than I expected, so well done, John.”
“I, erm,” John falters a bit, “did some research last night when I couldn’t sleep and I wanted you to take a look at it.”
Usually I wouldn't put this BEFORE the fic (so as not to bias you) but when you're reading the section where Sherlock plays for John, I want you to have these songs in mind, as they inspired/informed how I wrote what I wrote:
“Case?” Sherlock asks, damning himself for only being able to manage this.  “Case, no.  Not a case.  More of a … study, I suppose.”
dislocated, John.  Obviously,” Sherlock protests and gestures with his right hand.  The movement is jerky and he tries to hide a wince when the shoulder moves.
o	March 31 - John's 42nd birthday
The boy is silent.  John checks for a few more warning signs but based on what he can see, poor Alex is just a victim of inadequate or rushed preparation and isn’t all that much worse for wear.
“Papa,” she burbles and Sherlock chuffs against her fingers.
“Tell me,” John croaks.  “Everything.”
John’s eyes dart up to his and then away.  He nods.  “Did you want to talk about it?”
“Capoeira? Isn’t that the one based on dancing?” John interrupts, secretly gratified at the detective’s miffed expression.  “That explains a fair bit.”
“Buggering fuck,” John mutters as his cock starts to fill hopefully.  “Listen, you,” he points at the traitorous appendage, “you damn well better behave yourself tonight.  This mess is awkward enough as it is without untimely erections.”
Seemingly unperturbed, Dr. Simon nods and answers, “Superficial epidermal burns on her arm and chest – swelling and redness mostly reduced by the cool water and paracetamol you gave her, so good thinking – and a relatively superficial dermal burn at the juncture of her neck.  It’s the dermal burn that’s a bit more concerning given that it penetrates deeper, obviously, and the fact that it’s blistering, but given that it’s been about three hours since the initial incident and there’s no further swelling or profusion of blisters, I’d say it’s likely that she won’t have any lingering effects.”  She strips off and disposes of her nitrile gloves, binning them and leaning against the count to regard them both.  “I applied some lidocaine cream, which I will give you to take with you, and I’ll write you a script for it, but she probably won’t need it that long.  Potential for a small scar at the juncture of her neck where the burn is the worst, but nothing too horrible if it does scar.  She should be just fine.”
it rarely, it’s unsettl
John nods and murmurs as he pats Rosie’s back. “Of course not.  I know you’d never—”
, as she is amazing both as a beta and as a writer.
They lapse into silence and stay that way for quite some time.  The ticking and settling of the old building echoes around them, mingling with the ambient noise of London from outside the windows, but the two of them stay as they are for nearly an hour while Rosie sleeps.  Eventually, Sherlock gets up and mills about the sitting room, collecting his laptop and a few other things he anticipates needing, placing his case in front of the sofa next to John’s.  John fiddles about in the kitchen filling a few cups of snacks and packets of juice for Rosie that he stuffs into her diaper bag to pass on to Molly.  They circumnavigate each other throughout the two rooms but don’t speak until they hear the doorbell, Mrs. Hudson’s chirrupy greeting, and the shuffling footsteps on the stairs that follow.
“Today then,” John corrects.  “You’re always right, aren’t you?”
Sherlock enunciates.  “You’re a terrible influence.  Next thing you know, you’ll tell me it’s late and we should turn in.”
“That’s a lie,” John spits.  “You would have been there and back inside a fortnight and you know it.”
~~ ** Lady Tuesday ** ~~
When Sherlock’s expression doesn’t change, a look of tentative unease flashes across John’s face.  He seems … nervous.  Odd.  Sherlock lets the bow drop and then quenches the vibration of the strings with his fingers.  The room is plunged into sudden silence but for the noise of London outside.
A/N - So yes, demisexuality; this is my Sherlock.  I think there's a lot of evidence to support it, especially with season four's projecting Sherlock as a highly emotional person who CHOSE to be restrained with his emotions.  It fit, to me, although I acknowledge and enjoy many different depictions of his sexuality.
said that Baker Street is and always will be your home, so you barely even needed to ask.  That hasn’t changed and will not change.  You’re not just welcome here, you belong here.  You always have, from the very beginning.”

“Which is?”
John whips his head up and sucks in a lungful of air in a rush.  “Don't you say that.  Don’t you
John hands fist in his lap but he doesn’t look away.  “You just …” His voice drops to a half-whisper.  “Transform.”
“You can gauge sexual preference by a single instance of observed masturbation?”
John’s cheeks heat up but he’ll admit, if only in his head, that Mary is probably right about that.
he finishes in his most commanding Captain Watson voice.
kitchen,” John clarifies when Sherlock squints at him as if he’s a simpleton, “not a science lab or a morgue.”
He forces it through his lips.  “Torture.  You were tortured.”
“And never as an adult?” John asks tentatively.  “Not even—never?”
Sherlock scoffs with a smile.  “As if I’d be able to fall asleep in the twelve and a half minutes it takes you to bathe.”
“Exactly,” John agrees.
Sherlock looks down and pulls the disc from the computer’s tray.  “Human nature,” he says eventually.
The faux-anxious expression slides from the detective’s face and he gives John a gentle, satisfied smile.  The long, slim fingers gentle but don’t leave John’s grip.
Eva clears her throat as she deposits a key in John’s waiting fingers.  “There’s fresh linens on the bed – David let us know you were coming – and I’ve already put towels, flannels, soap, and things in the ensuite bath.  Hopefully you won’t need anything else but feel free to come down and see me if you do.  I’m on all night.”
He stops talking and hums a bit to try to clear the lump in his throat.
“I’m fine, Sherlock,” John answers stiffly.  “I just—”
“What happened?” he asks quietly.
John rolls his eyes.  “First of all, a man who faffs around crime scenes in Spencer Hart and a coat that costs more than a month’s rent wouldn’t choose socks simply because they were on sale, let alone something he was going to put up his bum.”
“I … yeah,” John admits; his posture goes from straight to stiff in moments.  “Is that all right?”
she says when John restarts the video for the third time; he gives a shaky laugh because it sounds for all the world like she knew he hadn’t been concentrating the first two repetitions.
“Would you mind getting her nappy and outfit changed and taking her downstairs for breakfast?” he says as casually as he can.  “I would love to start one day with a nice, long shower before I’m covered in baby food, wee, or diaper cream and cursing you for using all the hot water.”
A car door slam, low murmuring.  “Six minutes.”
Sherlock just stares flatly.
“Just you and me,” Sherlock confirms.  “Perhaps risotto and the thing with the peas?”
“Sorry,” John reiterates, trying to get back the jokey voice.  “Didn’t realize she’d be quite so eager to tear off before we’d either of us gotten properly dressed.”
A gusty sigh from Mycroft.  “I’m hanging up now.”
Sherlock spits.
Sherlock sips his tea and smiles.  “Nonsense.  Frankly, I’m surprised you’re not crowing on about the obvious superiority of your genetic material making itself known in your offspring.”
Throat feeling raw, Sherlock nods and turns away.  “Thank you, John.  I … I’m glad you enjoy it.”
Sherlock sounds panicked now, gulping and gasping, his limbs beginning to thrash with the effort.  There’s nothing for it, John needs to wake him immediately.  He grips the detective’s shoulders tight and gives him a few firm but controlled shakes.
“It is a
Sherlock pins John back with a withering glare.  “Oh for God’s sake, are you on about ‘High Wycombe’ again?  Honestly, John, you seem more obsessed with her than I ever was.”
“Why didn’t you want me to know?” he asks, his voice hushed.
“What happened?”
“John—”
Sherlock reaches back and points to the general direction of the irregular splotches – “acid” – and then the circular ones – “cigarette.”  He delivers the remarks so blandly that John feels light-headed.
He turns a beseeching look to John with eyes that quite clearly entreat John to just go along with the story.
“Babysitter,” she says without hesitation.  She comes up close and uses two fingers to push the tube of cream for Rosie into his front trouser pocket rather than the much more accessible jacket pocket.  Her smile is unrepentant in the face of John’s raised eyebrows.  “Hoping for an excuse to slip you something much more exciting than medicine.  Maybe my cell number.  For house calls, obviously.”
sneaks in and Sherlock is powerless to resist, even if he has to try.
“John,
“Well,” Sherlock says, playing as if he’s pondering the matter, “she has me around, after all.  Perhaps it’s nurture instead of nature.”
“Sock,”  Rosie groans.  She waves one arm behind her.
John smiles because this is normally the part where he would give some teasing response that would hook her interest as he scrawled her number on a slip from his pocket.  But his eyes flicker back to the disappearing Belstaff and he can’t seem to find the anticipation he would have felt once upon a time.
“Do you still?  After everything?” the detective asks quietly.
“So,” John starts, clearly choosing where to begin.  “Do you do that a lot?”
I’m not going to hug you while naked under your coat.”
“I … woke Rosie.”
Sherlock waves the explanation away.  “Trying to impress her.  Obvious.  Dull.  Thought he could pocket enough of the renovation funds, taxes, what-have-you.  Thought it would make him her equal.  A small-town clerk.  Ridiculous.  Frankly, I should have known it from the start; every person in this case was pathetically attempting to impress someone—”
That last bit will have to wait, John knows, before he can get back round to it.  Letting his eyes flutter shut for a moment, John swallows around the tightness creeping from his chest up into his throat.  He clears it conspicuously before he can continue.
“Oh,” is all Sherlock can manage and he looks away again.
“Weeks?!”  John’s voice bursts out of him far louder than he intends, causing Sherlock to jump.  “And where the bloody hell was your almighty brother?  Where was Mycroft while you were being beaten to hell for nine weeks?”
“I didn’t mean,” Sherlock fumbles.  “I just meant that’s what a stranger might
“Oh, for—” John grouses, catching the blooming smirk on Sherlock’s face.  “I suppose if I were built like a damn giraffe and had unlimited resources—”
to men.  But … very rarely.  I typically have no interest in sex with other people because I don’t typically feel attracted to other people. For the most part, any interest in sex is merely a byproduct of being a sexually-mature adult and rarely involves a desire for another person.”
John’s mug slides out of his numb fingers and crashes to the floor.
“Mmmm,” John hums in agreement.  “I suppose some of it is that it’s never quite the same as having your own live concert,” Sherlock smirks, “but, I dunno, you in particular … when you play that one you just….”
Above his fingers, Sherlock watches John slowly lean forward and prop his elbows on his knees.  His gaze rakes over Sherlock’s face and it feels tender, even if Sherlock can’t quite meet his eyes.
“Some combination of the three,” he jokes.  And because he can’t resist, “Why?  Which one were you hoping for?”
He hears muffled laughter and splashing, then John’s voice from the back of the flat.  “Giving Rosie a bath, give me a minute!”
Now - one of the biggest things I had to do when setting out an outline of what I wanted to write was put down a timeline.  Why?  Well, because since there's such a huge gap between each of the series' of the show, sometimes it's effing hard to keep straight when things happen, especially since they don't always give exact dates/times in the episodes.  Also, please note that I've done a lot of research recently on when canon birthdays happen.  Anything noted below in my timeline with an exact date is the exact canon date that it happens (either in BBC Sherlock canon or, as far as birthdays are concerned, in ACD canon).  Characters' ages are taken directly from Sherlock canon - in The Great Game, Sherlock mentions that Carl Powers happened in 1989 when he was 9 years old, therefore he was born in 1980 and is 30 years old at the start of the series in 2010.  John was more trouble, as I
“Fishing?  Don’t be ridiculous, Sherlock, I’m not exactly a sportsman.  Now if you would—”
John.”
“Don’t say you
With a smirk, John confirms, “That’s my favorite part about him.”
The doctor actually wrenches away from Sherlock, cradling his arms around Rosie as if he believes Sherlock is going to steal her and pitch her out the window.
“Just so I know, Alex,” John says, “have you been sexually active before or was this a totally new experience?”
John slams his eyes shut and frantically tries to gather his scattering thoughts.  Except now, in the wake of this evening and this song, all of his thoughts coalesce into one solid, unshakeable revelation:  Sherlock loves him back.  Without hesitation, without a doubt, John knows this fact as if it is the only thing that he has ever known.  A sudden crushing weight settles onto John’s chest and he’s gasping on nearly every breath.  He’s rocking forward towards Sherlock helplessly as he feels and hears and smells the inescapable presence of the man, overwhelming every sense and knocking the whole planet off its axis.  A light brush of Sherlock’s fingers on either side of John’s jaw has him snapping his eyes open, gazing up into Sherlock’s shifting, liquid eyes and they’re here, dancing on the precipice of the moment he’d thought would never come.
fine, just as you are.  Whatever you are.”
John beams at him and actually applauds.  “Absolutely brilliant.  Loved that one the first time I heard you play it.  Tried to look it up on YouTube a time or two, but even when I thought I’d found the right one, I could never find anyone that played it as well as you do.”
“Nope. You and I are not going starkers in a shed in the great beyond—”
Sherlock nearly chuckles; he can hear Mycroft shifting the bedsheets up to cover his chest, as if the prim gesture somehow gives him the high ground.
“Sorry about that,” John says with a grin as he shakes her hand.  “Not sure what’s gotten into him but … well, it’s nothing new.”
“Bees?” John asks, nonplussed.
Well, that is certainly … unexpected.  John hadn’t
“Phone calls twice in one week, Sherlock?  You must be
John huffs with laughter before he realizes that Sherlock is in earnest.  “Why on Earth would you think that?  It’s not as if I look like a human stick insect, too; I’m fairly certain she can tell us apart.”
Wrapping a towel loosely around his waist, John bends over and whispers to his daughter.  “Rosie love, would you like to go show Sherlock what a wonderful bee you are?”
As he hears Sherlock shuffling around in his bedroom – changing Rosie’s nappy, most likely, before putting her down – John stares at the tea service and debates his next move.  He’s known it was inevitable for a while now that they’d have to deal with this, discuss it eventually.  John’s known it since Sherrinford, certainly; maybe even since his wedding, if he’s really honest with himself.  Which he hadn’t been until very, very recently.  But it can’t be helped now.  He’d just hoped maybe they could have waited to talk about it until everything had settled down more.  Hoped not to spring it on Sherlock when they were still so busy just rebuilding their lives together in the aftermath of Mary’s death and Sherrinford.  Also, John’s just plain rubbish at the whole business of discussing emotions.  No help for it though.
Sherlock’s throat tightens.  John looks terrified.
“A case?  Hardly the sort of thing you need to call me for, brother mine.  You seem to do well enough through the Yard and your little blog.”
“Because I care about you, Sherlock.  Jesus, you’re my best friend.  You’re the person I love most in the world, apart from my daughter.  I want to understand.  So explain it to me.”
Oh.  That's obviously the wrong thing to say because several emotions chase across John’s face in the silence that follows.  Sherlock puzzles at them, though, because in between the amusement and the rush of embarrassment, there is definitely fear and … disappointment?  Baffling.
“Goodnight, Sherlock.”
“—see but don’t observe; yeah, I’ve heard,” the doctor finishes with an eye roll.  “All right, all right, so you’ve studied what, exactly?”
Clearing his throat, Sherlock pastes an entirely transparent expression of boredom on his features but conspicuously fails to meet John’s eyes.  “You know I do love to be congratulated.”
“Onto the floor where my toddler was playing,” he interrupts harshly.
~~ ** Lady Tuesday ** ~~
After a few minutes of silence, he realizes that John is not shaking any longer and Rosie’s eyelids flicker with all indications of dreaming during REM sleep.  Sherlock unfolds himself from the chair as gently as possible to avoid waking her and gestures towards John.
“Mary will only ever be a name on paper and face in photographs to Rosie.  She won’t know her mother.  She will, however, know
“Hello, Miss Rosamund, I’m Katie,” she says and offers Rosie her hand.  To the amusement of all the adults, Rosie removes her soggy fist from her mouth and clasps the doctor’s forefinger in an unmistakable shaking gesture.  “Polite little one you have there,” the doctor says to John and then turns a sympathetic face back to Rosie.  “I hear you’ve had a rough night, haven’t you?  Could one of you give me a rundown on what happened?”
“Sorry,” John says as he hoists Rosie up on his right hip but the jovial tone dies on his lips almost immediately.
“Sorry,” John mutters quickly, pressing Rosie closer to his chest, angling her red, blotchy face towards his neck and away from Sherlock.  “Sorry if she woke you – or, I dunno, interrupted you if you haven’t gone to bed yet.”
Sherlock pulls a face.  “What makes you say that?”
“Papa?” she says again and pats his face for emphasis.  “Luff Daddy?”
“Don’t be ridiculous, John,” Sherlock says, eyeing it with suspicion.  “With your shoulder, you’ll be in agony tomorrow if you sleep on a couch, even a good one.  I will—”
makes a comment about the ugliness of jealousy but decides to leave it be.
William closed his eyes as if to savor the contact.
This all came none too soon. Sherlock Holmes was narrowing in all his calling - and it was just as outrageous as the man himself.
John looked down to hide his smile, his hands clasped behind his back.
“So am I kipping with you for the next few weeks, or has some younger, better looking bloke taken my place?”
“Es gibt Schlimmeres,” replied Sherlock. “Don’t worry, I don’t consider this any of my business.”
“See him?” he gasped. “He’s there!”
Sherlock smiled. “As was I.”
“Oh, that.” Sherlock rose up from the sofa and shuffled to the fire. He warmed his hands against the flames. “I was ready to snatch you away from that blasted hospital if you weren't here. Good thing you were. Would’ve caused quite a spectacle,” he teased.
“I burn for you,” he whispered. “I blamed buried memories. I blamed misplaced gratitude. I chastised myself for being unable to quell my most basic, primal instincts, like
Later that evening, Sherlock showed up at the flat. John had ignored every phone call and text Sherlock had sent. He hoped he at least wouldn’t turn him away in person.
“You think he went to the reservoir, to look for Oscar Dzundza,” the Inspector said warily.
“No, he wasn’t, Sherlock,” John shouted back angrily. “He was hurting you!”
“Alright,” answered John. “How can help?”
“I’m feeling peckish.”
His voice shook with emotion as he spoke.
“Dzundza was here,” he murmured.
John raised his cup and took a small sip. The delicious liquid coated his tongue and warmed his throat. He took another sip, closing his eyes to relish the taste.
“We’ll get the through this, yeah?”
“Thank you, Otis,” said Sherlock.
“Yes,” he replied simply.
“Be brave, man!” John whispered, as the Inspector approached them.
Sherlock had failed to attend the last couple of Monday night sessions. He hadn’t felt up to it after the grueling Concert Band ordeals, and frankly, he wasn’t sure if he could bring himself to talk to Victor after what he and John had seen that night in the group practice room.
“You’re really going to do this?” Sherlock hissed defiantly. “After everything we’ve been through -”
“William, I owe you an apology,” he managed.
“‘Course we will,” John replied assuredly.
He didn’t stir, his breath shallow and uneven.
So when the Spaniard uttered those three words one night, after they had made love on the floor of John’s bedroom (they never managed to make it to the bed), John easily said them back to him.
John kissed him and placed Sherlock's hand against his solid chest. "Just be with me."
He reached forward in his drunkenness and placed a small, strong hand over the Spaniard’s heart. He rubbed the spot tenderly with his thumb, then rested his blonde head on Felipe’s wide shoulder.
Sherlock reached forward and pulled up the leg of his trousers. He observed the brace and the condition of his leg in complete silence. He then began to undo the leather straps.
When it came time to retire for the evening, John pulled Molly aside.
“John,” said Sherlock somberly. “That is the most disgusting story I’ve ever heard.”
------------------
John’s chest was solid and strong with fine blonde hairs that spread down towards his abdomen and into his groin. His length was thick and large and hard as a rock. It lay leaking helplessly against his belly.
“He needs broth,” he finally said, his voice strained.
“Oh, Sherlock.”
Felipe gasped and clenched tightly around his length. John calmed him with soothing words and hands. Once relaxed, he carefully pulled out.
“I’m coming Sherlock,” he murmured. “Hold on, love. I’m coming.”
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “I thought it was your mate who didn’t know ‘his arse from an ankle tap’,” he said.
It didn’t take long for the fire to be squelched. The maids came in and opened up the windows and began to remove the smoky linens and upholstery. John helped the others with the clean up. Mrs Hudson made them all an early breakfast and the entire staff sat down to eggs and beans and coffee at 4am.
“You’re supposed to chase after the criminal, Holmes, not hang about and fuss over me.”
Sherlock surveyed the board, and moved his white bishop. "Maestro Richard Brook."
John glared at him.
“It’s going to pour, gentlemen. I suggest you all come inside and have a nightcap.”
“That place,” he said, his voice trembling. “I can hardly believe it.” He sat down heavily on the sofa.
Sherlock struggled but Brook pinned him to the floor, straddling him and holding the baton against his neck.  Sherlock suddenly felt hot lips on his body as Brook licked at his mouth. He gently kissed him over and over, then suddenly bit down on the sensitive skin just below his jaw. He sucked and sucked until the skin turned bright purple.
His shout was a desperate sound, and shocked the innkeeper so that he nearly dropped his torch.
Dr. MacDougal cleared his throat and appeared stressed.
John bit his trembling lip and looked away, a mixture of guilt and gratitude washing over him. He took a deep a breath and managed to meet Felipe’s gaze.
Just then, a loud noise and sharp cry forced everyone to stop and turn around.
The butler, Mr Frank, kindly interjected.
Raibert handed him a towel, which he gratefully took, wiping his mouth and face and the back of his neck, trying to wash the memory of those two awful men away.
*********
“I was thinking,” he said softly. “Maybe I could work part time with the grocer on the corner.”
He opened the bathroom door and found Sherlock sitting on the floor.
“Thank you,” said John softly.
Victor laughed. “If you must know, he hasn’t stop talking about you.”
Once he determined mother and child were out of danger, he collapsed on the back porch in exhaustion. He fancied a whisky and large cigar, but pushed the thought out of his mind as he knew Mr. Thomas would not approve.
He waited for John to comment. When he didn’t, he continued.
"It's not over," he mumbled to himself. "I'm going to find you, Richard Brook."
"Why don't you let me decide what's best for me," he said in his deepest baritone, and pulled Raibert down for another kiss.
John sat down quietly beside him.
“Why me?” John whispered. He searched Sherlock’s ocean-colored eyes for an answer.
He obediently licked John's smooth, firm member for ages before taking it between his plump lips. He felt incredibly sexy and powerful as he slid his tongue up and down his lover's cock, relishing the pressure fed to him by the John's thick fingers. He pushed his bottom back against John's hand and moaned.
“Oh,” murmured John. “I’m not sure how - I guess I didn’t think about it. After we’ve been back in London, he’s been working, at the Yard...we haven’t talked much about the past.”
The butler, whom John did not recognize, introduced them as Dr. John Watson and The Honourable Sherlock Holmes. No one batted an eye, even as several members of the family greeted them. Servants wordlessly took their jackets and placed their hats in the hall. The parlour was eerily just as John remembered it. A young (and very tall) footman appeared with a silver tray and served them champagne in crystal flutes. Sherlock raised his eyebrows at John and grinned as he took a glass from the tray.
His mouth was suddenly filled with warm, salty liquid. John swallowed without thinking as his hand roughly palmed his own throbbing erection, his hips rocking back and forth. He whimpered softly as he released against his fingers, the head of Sherlock’s softening penis still touching his glistening lips.
He then leaned forward and buried his face in John’s neck, his hips grinding harder and deeper. John whined and held on to his soft, white bottom, wishing he could see himself moving in and out of Sherlock’s body.
John pressed on in spite of his jealously. “Where is he now?”
"Oh God you feel so good," sighed John. “Keep doing that."
“I don’t understand, why would he do that to me?”
Sherlock grinned, then winced in pain. “I suppose. Quite fun too.”
Sherlock memorized every detail as he entered the fourth floor.  He pushed through the glass doors that guarded the music study and made his way through a large multi-purpose room complete with oak tables, chairs and glass shelves full of sheet music and books. Except for the occasional closing of a door or ruffling of papers, the fourth floor was eerily silent.
Sherlock cried out, but the dark-haired man slapped him hard across the face.
John also noticed a flicker of sadness in his eyes as he turned away to head down the stairs.
Sherlock had curled up under the oak tree and was sound asleep, his jacket bundled under his head for a pillow.
“What’s here?”said John, impatience clear in his voice. “Sherlock…”.
Then the man threw the stick to the side and pulled out a thick, glass rod and held it as if to penetrate his partner's well-exposed arse.
Having Sherlock back in his arms felt like home to him, too.
Ahad was shaking as he bravely stepped forward.
Sherlock knelt down by his side and placed his large hand over the bloody wound. The pain was excruciating, and John cried out in misery.
Peter and Mycroft glanced at each other in surprise.
John licked his lips and looked up at the officer. “Sherlock was injecting himself with morphine and cocaine. He must have been trying to dry out on his own when he became infected.”
“Intentions?” John said. “What you speak of is a sin and punishable by -”
Sherlock sighed softly into John's chest.
“Sherlock survived the fall. In fact, he’s sleeping in the front bedroom as we speak.”
“Oh?”said Raibert curiously. “You two break up?”
John flattened up against the rocks and hid. He heard the Afghans shout at the man, but what they were saying he couldn’t quite make out. He pulled his knife from his boot and readied his rifle.
“Because,” said Sherlock, the corner of his mouth tugging into a slight smile as he noticed the absence of m’lord. “I don’t want Mycroft to see them and ship them back. I’ll start using them to teach and he’ll be unable to return them without disappointing the village.”
William acknowledged the Detective Inspector with a weariness beyond his years.
John placed a warm hand on Sherlock's waist. “Try straightening your back.”
“I’m here, my good man,” he said, gasping. “Pray, tell me she is still with us?
“He’s getting away,” he whispered.
John watched intently and reached around Sherlock’s exposed thigh, his fingers gently wandering into the cleft of his arse.
“Dr. Watson, if I may ask a favor,” she said sweetly as she poured his coffee.
Sherlock turned, his face drawn up in thought.
“I wasn't --”
"You okay?"
“Bloody hell.”.
,” he whispered. “Please-”
Agnes wasn’t expecting him in Marseilles for another two weeks. At Mr. Thomas’s urging, he’d left early, planning to spend some time sightseeing in Paris before traveling south.
It was then the familiar sound of Jean Pierre’s prattle emanated from outside, breaking the small spell that had temporarily surrounded the two men. John closed his eyes for a moment, and when he opened them, Felipe had opened the door and walked out onto the street.
“That was bloody insane,” John said pointedly.
Sherlock cocked his head. “So it is a secret.”
………….
Ahad managed a tiny smile at John’s attempt at humor, then bent over and vomited up his entire supper all over the hospital steps.
“Mycroft, old chap,” said the Duke. “Or should I say, my lord.”
When John was twelve he was promoted to hall boy. He no longer went to school since his service was needed full-time in the household and he was being groomed as a footman. Upon his promotion he was moved to the male servant wing of the household where he shared not only a room but a bed with two other boys. He rarely got enough sleep as it was always toes in his face or elbows in his back or farts followed by giggles. Yet as the oldest he learned to keep the younger ones in line and they looked up to him for guidance. His mother shared a room with the other lady’s maid, Liza, and he saw her every day in the servant's hall where they all had breakfast together after the family had eaten and the marquess was off in the library writing his morning letters. John was happy and the staff was kind and though he hated the work (emptying chamber pots is never one’s true calling) he was thankful he still got to polish boots in the afternoon.
William again turned away toward the fire. His fingers pressed against his sore neck and he winced.
Sweat flies from his curls, his eyes tightly shut to keep the wetness from sliding in as he plays faster and faster and he realizes that the sound he’s producing is no longer beautiful but an annoying wail that sounds like a child’s wind-up toy -
John held out his hand. “John Watson.”
Thanks again for all your lovely comments. :)
“It’s alright,” whispered Sherlock against John’s trembling lips. Sherlock pressed his chest against him.
If your schedule permits, join me for dinner tomorrow night? Aceituna, 8pm.
Sherlock fell into a deeper rhythm with the players. His body pulsed with the reeds, vibrated with the brass. He was truly leading the band. He was the concertmaster.
Sherlock raised the hand to his lips.
“What?” replied John. “What are you talking about?”
The words were so hollow they almost echoed inside the small sitting room. John cleared his throat and shifted uncomfortably in his chair.
His big brown eyes glistened with tears.
Mrs. Hudson clicked her tongue in reproach. "If you say so, dear..."
The man froze and held up his hands even higher in defeat. Sherlock spit blood onto the cobblestone as he cradled his jaw. John reach into his own pocket and handed Sherlock his handkerchief.
John watched with delight the flush that began in Sherlock’s chest and crept up his long pale neck into his beautiful, high cheekbones. He watched his lithe chest rise and fall quicker than before, his fingers squeezing into fists as his knuckles whitened.
“To let you know your friend Victor is quite safe,” he said sincerely. “And to congratulate you. I never thought you had it in you, baby brother. To masquerade as a student to capture a criminal mastermind, though rather unconventional, I’m still quite proud.”
Stefan followed suit, casually sliding in beside him, blocking John. “I have a personal carriage. I am happy to take you home,” he whispered in heavily accented English.
“I can’t see it!” he cried, his hands pulling at his slicked back hair, causing it to fall forward and curl over his eyes. “The man was murdered, yet the door was locked from the inside.”
“The marchioness herself.”
"Better?" mumbled John against his lips.
By the time they made it to Donovan’s office, William was in an obvious state of distress. Sweat poured off his brow as his shoulder’s slumped, and he had turned white as a sheet.
“South Africa, yes. When do we leave?” He managed to sound indifferent, though his heart was pounding with excitement.
“Mr. Watson. Pleasure to see you again,” said Mycroft briskly.
“I beg of you, Dr. Watson, please don’t say that.” He ran a large hand worriedly through his curls. “I realize now my method was unethical and I didn’t think it through. I have been so desperate for information about my life -”
John rang that evening with good news. Sherlock was relieved to hear his voice.
Donovan didn’t hesitate to consult Sherlock on every murder case that floated across his desk. Sherlock loved every moment. He'd hurry off, sometimes in the middle of the night. He was having so much fun that John never fussed, though he secretly wished he could come along.
“The medical school in Tangier,” said John softly, as he ran his fingers through wild, dark curls. “Captain Lestrade found you at the village school and brought you here.”
“You don’t know that.”
Translation of Stefan and Sherlock's conversation in the bar:
Sherlock’s moans were muffled as the good doctor kissed him deeply, the hand not curled tightly around the detective’s neck pulling off his unbuttoned shirt and throwing it to the floor.
Several moments of silence passed, until Sherlock whispered:
Both were unusually silent during the ride home. Once back in the room, Sherlock poured two brandies and handed one to John. John took it with shaking fingers.
Sherlock watched John's lips, wet and perfect. "Yes, I’m sure," he said softly. "Just..." His soft gaze met John's. "Talk to me. Please. Tell me what to do."
His draft was complete. He needed to read through it one more time, then he could finally crawl into bed.
The smaller man cupped his palm firmly over the front of the Spaniard’s trousers.
“Help me, please,” he begged, clasping his hands in front of his chest.
“Nonsense,” Sherlock answered. “You were sound asleep. How was the Apollo?”
And there was Seb. He’d never told another living soul, but at Cambridge, he was pursued by a young man, Sebastian Wilkes, who lived in his dormitory. Sherlock had eagerly responded to his advances, so much so that the relationship had become physical. But after some months, he discovered the Seb’s intentions were not sincere, and were instead motivated by a friendly wager made between he and his roommates. It had been a devastating experience, and Sherlock had become deeply guarded since the day the ruse was revealed.
Sherlock gratefully accepted the white cloth and held it carefully to his lip.
“I’ll just, uh, change into my nightshirt,” John replied. “I’ll just be a moment.”
He managed to glance up at Miss Turner, who was staring back at him rather concerned. He had the decency to look apologetic.
Raibert obeyed, helping Sherlock undo his trousers and making quick work of shucking his pants and socks.
Brooks slammed the door shut again as Sherlock threw his bow down on the music stand and collapsed heavily into his chair.
“Very well,” he said softly. “Go on back, folks, tell the next wave to come on up. And bring Dr. Watson a set of dry clothes.”
Sherlock pushed his back up against John's chest. "John," he whispered, relishing in his heat, his arms holding him in place, his huge thick cock filling him up, over and over.
Mycroft raised his hand to calm them all. “I didn’t mean to interrupt. I just wanted to say that I am grateful to all of you for your action and service today. You may have very well saved Land's End as we know it,” Mycroft said, his eyes uncharacteristically glistening with emotion. "And Mr Watson?"
“Yes. William Sherlock Scott Holmes.”
“Are you recovered from your trip?” asked John.
John is torn between duty and love.
He was disappointed when Raibert answered the door.
"Oooh Goddd," groaned John as Sherlock fucked him so good, their eyes locked as they moved together. Sherlock leaned in to kiss him deeply every few seconds as he thrusted harder into him, pushing his thighs wider, forcing himself deeper inside John’s tight little arse. He felt the spasms around him before he heard John's breath stop, and then warm come spilled between them, soaking their bellies as he continued to fuck up into John from the floor. He held John in place, his arms in a vice around his solid shoulders as he fucked him and fucked him and fucked him until he was coming with an intensity he’d never felt before.
“We found a pattern.”
“Don’t fuck this up,” he cood.
John shook his head adamantly. “I love you, Felipe. I love the vineyard, the village, the people…”
"Stefan, a pleasure. And you are?"
“Why?" he answered. “Every question I have, every problem I bring to you you give me half-truths or placate me with some trivial nonsense. You keep me far away.”
“We, actually,” answered John automatically. He pondered his response for a bit before attempting another stitch. “Well, no, Sherlock solved them. I just tagged along usually. Wrote my little stories.”
His huge hands were then in Sherlock’s hair, his lips kissing his forehead, his eyes gazing into him hungrily. Again they kissed passionately, Raibert’s tongue slowly unraveling what was left of Sherlock’s misgivings. Sherlock felt broken, and he needed someone to put him back together again, even if those pieces weren’t going to hold together for very long.
He crawled on top of Sherlock, who was sitting up, a looked of bewilderment on his face. He wiped Sherlock’s face, neck and chest with the flannel, then threw it on the nightstand.
Felipe held him close and kissed him, powerful hips threatening to grind up into his sex and end it all too quickly. John pulled off his own shirt and quickly undid Felipe's trousers, pulling them down to his knees.
“Sherlock,” he said softly, shaking his head. He turned and walked quickly away. Sherlock followed after him.
Sherlock cried out, the burn real and raw. It had been weeks since they’d made love.
"After what?"
“Lie on your back,” said Sherlock.
He flipped open the tin of sweets and pulled out the stolen medicine. He left the rest, shutting the lid and handing the tin to Sherlock.
John had come back for him. Sherlock felt his cock twitch in his trousers.
“He said it would be a shame for your talent and training to go to waste,” said Sherlock. “I happen to agree with him.”
“Sherlock,” said Brook, approaching him. “Victor is out. I need you for Reichenbach.”
“Mr. Steiler, I need your help,” he said. “I think Mr. Holmes is in danger.”
Sherlock didn't answer.
“Damn my leg,” he whispered.
Molly blushed. “It’s okay. It’s my pleasure.”
Sherlock played on, one eye on his music, the other on Brook, awed by the maestro’s presence of mind.
Sherlock thought for a moment, then knew exactly where they should go.
“I see you,” he whispered in amazement.
He squirmed underneath John’s weight, pressing and rubbing his naked, full erection against his trousers.
William shook his head. “A cottage.” He paused for a moment, then said, “And I should like you to go with me.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock opened his mouth to argue, thought better of it, and continued down the staircase.
“How do they look?”
Dangle adowne his lovely cheekes with ioy,
The old servant feigned calm as he ran his long fingers through John’s shaggy blonde hair.
John felt himself lifted into the air as the Spaniard’s laughter filled the barn.
“Was it a man?”
Warning: Shit gets kinda weird. for those of you grossed out by hetero sex (like me), just stick with it. there's (hopefully) enough satisfying johnlock interaction in the next chapter to make up for it.
"And you are?"
“Start. Counting," he growled.
Sherlock sighed. “A sexual deviant. Inverted. I fancy men.”
“John, this is wonderful!” said Dimmock.
Sherlock smiled discerningly. “Victor, I think you’ll find there are few who are.”
John leaned over and kissed Sherlock tenderly on the forehead. “I thought of you every day, you know.”
“John,” he whispered. “I offer everything I have to you. You already have my heart. This school, it can be ours, yours and mine.”
“No, never," said John. “I have dreams sometimes. I do things... I want to be in control, but I've never... Sherlock, God, how can I fix this? Can I fix this?”
William had the book under one arm, the other carefully outstretched away from his body. The stitching was perfect, but the wound looked raw and painful. Before John could respond, he ducked inside the room and softly closed the door.
“Quite impressive, m’lord” said John.
*********
When had the rain turned into snow?
“A suspect we arrested yesterday, a Mrs. Tupplebottom, hung herself in the holding cell this morning. She tore her dress, made a makeshift noose. It wasn’t pretty.”
Mycroft, the eldest and heir, was now the Earl of Cornwall. He was born to fill the role, not just because he was the first but because ruling suited him. Sherlock, on the other hand, was interested only in science and his experiments and rarely heeded a word his brother or anyone said.
John looked up and smiled. He placed a hand on Sherlock's, then rubbed his cheek against his knuckles.
“No,” said John. “But I do think you are sick. Your mind isn’t right.”
John's response to Stefan in poorly-spoken German:
"God I missed you," John said breathlessly, as he gently brushed his lips along Sherlock's long, graceful neck.
Felipe drew in a deep breath and slammed his fist down on the table.
“The family,” he said. “They didn’t just attest to others. They trusted me, invited me into their home, fed me. I played with their children -”
"Sherlock," said John, his voice muffled. "Open the door."
“Dr. Watson,” he began, the stopped. “John,” he began again,a bit more softly, “my respect for you is that of the highest mark, and as I’ve mentioned before, the debt my family owes you is beyond any form of earthly compensation. It is because of these things that I am obliged to be frank, as I am desperate to spare you any false hope. As much as I wish there was a chance, no matter how infinitesimal, there is none. The harsh weather combined with the fierce nature of the falls is no match for any man, even…” The Earl’s eyes became a deep red and moisture filled the rims. His voice was shaky as he continued. “...even for Sherlock.”
Sherlock set his glass down and leaned forward. “You’ve been looking at me like I’m a firing squad for the last half-hour,” he stated. “Out with it,” he added quietly.
He dared to glance over at John, who was staring back at him in confusion and shock. They both turned back to the scene just in time to see clothed man pull out what looked like a long, rounded stick. He struck the young man’s naked back, not once, not twice, but three times in a row.
John shook his head. “No, no you don’t,” he seethed. “I’m not letting you off this time.”
"I ask you why you stopped playing," he says icily. "And your version of an answer was to turn into a wind-up monkey playing the fiddle." He groans into his hands. "You're all the same."
"It's John," said the voice on the other side of the door.
Agnes smiled thoughtfully. “She thought the world of you two. She called you her “boys”. And that Sherlock. She spoke of him from the day he was born until the day he-”.
When John awoke he was on a cot in the makeshift infirmary. He tried to swallow, but his tongue felt huge in his mouth. He shivered violently, knocking his blanket on the floor. John somehow got to his feet to retrieve it, but became so dizzy he fell to his knees. He bent over to vomit, but nothing came up. He heard someone shout for a doctor just as he blacked out.
He heard the door slam shut below them. Then voices.
“Mmm?” Felipe murmured, leaning down once more to capture the young man’s lips in a full, sensuous kiss.
Raibert goaded him on. "Are you sure?"
“Did he ever come after you?”
“John.”
“I have resolved to kiss you as much as possible.”
Sherlock’s body quivered in his mouth and in his hands. His translucent eyes were heavy-lidded and raw, his red lips wet and parted as his fingers opened and closed in the soft sofa cushions. John locked his deep blue eyes with his lordship’s as he continued to suck and lick gently, his technique messy and uneven. Sherlock, grateful to feel John's lips in any capacity, squirmed underneath him.
He had meant it when he said he was going to kiss Sherlock everywhere. He took his time, lavishing his lips and tongue over his beautiful chest, then kissing and licking each finger as if it were sticks of candy. He massaged his cold feet between his fingers and chuckled every time Sherlock squirmed as he kissed each toe with reverence. He laved at creases in his thighs, and when he turned him over, did the same with his coccyx, spending generous time coaxing his center open with his tongue.
*******
Felipe eyed his lover carefully.
John felt a bit of happiness bloom in his chest.
William nodded. “I’d be delighted.”
What was that?
“Oh, speaking of a spectacle…” John got up gingerly from the sofa and found his discarded jacket on the floor by the front door. He dug into his pocket for the note MacDougal had given him. He’d never bothered to find out where the dinner was being held. “I’m inviting you to a fancy dinner. Courtesy of Dr. MacDougal.”
Sherlock, remembering the brick wall in the tunnel, immediately felt around the rocks and within moments, pushed a lever that popped open the bogus barricade.
********
John got up and unwisely filled his cup again. He faced the window, watching the rain pour down the pane. “What if you lived here?” he said carefully. “Maybe you could be happy. Here. In a modern city.”
Sherlock’s rage was building along with his desperation. He wanted to pull the trigger. He wanted Moriarty’s brains on the concrete. He wanted to rip the bomb off of John’s body and carry him back to Baker street. Moriarty was so close, Sherlock could smell the Hermes D Orange Verte aftershave on his neck.
Brook, as though discussing the weather, addressed him casually. “Why do you suppose I just hurled a chair at your head, Sherlock?”
He reclined on the soft, narrow bed of his rented room, picking at a bowl of almonds and writing about his journey from Barcelona to the village. The weather had cooled quickly from an unexpected rainstorm. He got up and pulled down an extra blanket from the wooden shelf next to the wash basin.
“Let’s have a drink,” he said, motioning towards the building.
Fifteen minutes later, the orchestra filed back down in the hallway, whooping and cheering and patting an exhausted, sweaty Sherlock on the back. They had taken first place, and had qualified for the nationals in December.
Sherlock saw John’s eyes darken at the compliment.
Sherlock exhaled a breath he didn't know he was holding. His fingertips felt gently for John’s lips in the dark as he leaned down and kissed him, whispering “yes” as he melted into his embrace.
“How did you feel?” asked John. “Tell me.”
“As do you.”
John’s heart leaped into his throat. She had recognized him! But no, wait...that’s not it. He had still yet to lighten much from his time in Tangier. So no, he hadn’t been recognized after all.
It was the last thing he remembered before falling into a deep, relaxed slumber.
John studied Sherlock for a moment then shook his head. “It’s not your fault. I’m shit at pulling a bloke,” he sighed.
“Brook is a ghost,” he said. “No one can nail him down. I’ve got friends who’ve heard of him but never met him. Were in the same band and can’t remember his face.”
Felipe gripped his lover’s hips and pulled him deep inside, still feeling his muscles pulsing and contracting.
“I want intimacy,” he said softly, as if it were the most obvious thing in the world.
Felipe stumbled back into the barrel, but John caught him and picked him up, settling him on top of the wood. He lifted his long, defined legs and cradled them in his arms.
“Mr. Roberts,” he said through gritted teeth. “Could I trouble you for some tea?”
A brutal rhythm ensued as powerful hips smacked against a tender behind, Sherlock's bottom no longer white but a splotchy pink. John drove into his body hard and fast, Sherlock watched him, his eyes now clear but his expression blank as John took what he wanted.
And now, in a drunken stupor, a moment of weakness, he’d promised to take William to Baker Street.
“Yes. He was my first lover.” Sherlock turned again to look at John. “You’re my second.”
The woman nodded her head and smiled. She gestured at him, asking his name.
Sherlock leaned back in his seat, his eyes sparkling. He suddenly didn’t seem so drunk.
John managed to shine the lantern on William’s face. He was shockingly pale and his eyes were shut. John hesitated before leaning forward to check for a pulse.
Sherlock reluctantly moved on, taking his place in line with the strings.
"As long as I pursue the right one, you mean."
William, surprised, turned his head to stare with amazement at the doctor.  He nodded shyly.
Felipe followed him outside.
Donovan’s eyebrows shot up in surprise.
Sherlock picked up the key and inspected it.
Felipe immediately picked up William and placed him inside the guard house. John tried to follow, but his knees gave way and he landed with a thud. He folded over onto himself and began to sob with relief, feeling the rain beat his body and the thunder roll through his ears, because at last, at last, he’d saved his love, from the raging waters that had once again tried to take him away.
John’s expression remained stoic, though Sherlock detected a flicker of vulnerability underneath. He placed the coffee cup and bun on the table in front of him.
Sherlock looked completely debauched, not to mention sweaty, pink and satiated.
“It can be no worse than the journey to Turkmenia,” said Sherlock.
“Keep counting,” he whispered.
“I am the Earl of Cornwall,” responded Mycroft not unkindly.
“Alright, take ten. When we get back --the squeaker’s on.”
It helped somewhat. As the fervor began to die down, so did the unwanted advances.
Felipe’s teenage nephew, Raul, was suddenly at their side.
William continued to read aloud:
“Yes,” mumbled Sherlock. “But I don’t think it was an accident.”
The name of the village trickled into the unpleasant memory of how he’d left things with Felipe. Though he’d made the right decision to stay with Sherlock, he sometimes wondered what had become of the man, the medical school and the vineyard.
John held out his hand. Sherlock slowly reached out and took it. The good doctor helped him to his feet and as they made the short distance back to the bed.
John peered inside again. “Unfortunate,” he mumbled.
John blinked. He didn’t say anything.
“You are nothing of the sort,” huffed Sherlock. “You’re the bravest, wisest man I’ve ever known.” He abruptly sat up, rubbing his fingers against his lips, thinking.
William stood still, as if weighing whether or not to argue with him.
“Dr. Watson -”
“All set?”
Sherlocks face crumpled and twisted with rage.
“Dr. Canales wished to express to me how valuable your skills as a surgeon and physician were to him during the outbreak,” said Sherlock. “He also mentioned that he had made you an offer to stay and teach at his school. He said you turned him down, that your loyalty was to me.”
“Did you ever wonder why the marchioness dismissed you so unceremoniously?”
John hesitated. It was well worn tin used to store sweets. It had no lock. Surely inside were peppermints. Sherlock had an insatiable sweet tooth.
He found a small bed and breakfast on the outskirts of Barcelona and slept hard for the rest of the night. The next morning, he ate breakfast with the owner who gave him directions west to the tiny village.
“Miss Turner,” he had said shakily. “You should know your employment is secure.”
John turned and pressed his forehead against the window. He craned his neck and strained his eyes, and yes, Mycroft was right.
John caught a glimpse of a human skull on the shelf and did a double take.
Felipe stood up and gathered the shorter man close. His large hands cradled his neck as he kissed him softly.
Sherlock stood perfectly still, like the hairs standing on the back of his neck.
It was then he heard his name being shouted.
“Because,” answered Sherlock. “We’re going on holiday.”
“It’s ok. Play.”
John forgot about why he’d gotten up in the first place and slid in beside the young nobleman. There they lay, face to face, staring at each other in the moonlight, much like they had months ago when they first arrived in Tangier.
He would find a way. He would do it for Sherlock.
Sherlock closed the book and placed it in his lap. He didn't look up, but managed a slight nod.
“Please do.”
The strong arms of the Spaniard enveloped him into a cocoon of warmth and safety. John couldn’t help but collapse into Felipe’s chest and bury his face into his neck. He breathed him in and sighed.
No one would be surprised to learn the two are brothers. Both young men oozed impeccable breeding, with straight as an arrow spines and reddish highlights in otherwise raven black hair. Sherlock's curls were wild in the wind, whereas Mycroft's slicked hair was tucked neatly under a pageboy cap.
The man smiled. “I’m Major Siger Holmes. I command the Cornwall Light Infantry.”
He laid his own clothed body over the Spaniard’s back, and whispered hotly into his ear.
It read simply:
“You’re doing great,” he said, caressing Sherlock’s milky thighs.
“You assumption is incorrect.”
“Beg your pardon, m’lord,” John continued. “But it is Christmas Eve.”
“Please tell Mycroft that I will be resting,” responded Sherlock, sipping his cup.
“I’m going to call you ‘idiot’ if you don’t tell me what’s wrong,” snapped Sherlock, through there was no bite in his bark.
John checked his watch again. It was well past 8 o’clock, and William was nowhere to be found.
Sherlock also seemed just as fascinated with John. He was quick to include him in all of his activities, including his teaching. He would call Watson “his assistant” in front of the boys and girls as he did experiments that made them ooh and ahh. He taught them biology and chemistry and even German, since the students had full access to the books during class.
Dr. Watson,
Irene smiled at him. “We’ll miss you,” she said facetiously.
Victor shook his head. “I just know one phone call wasn’t like all the others. Brook was threatening someone. It was horrible. I kept hearing the man on the other line begging him, crying. But that’s all I remember.”
The clarinets, oboes and saxophones played and were cut off.
"Already inviting me on a second date?" said John.
John didn’t want to admit to his mother that he thought of his father multiple times a day since he'd passed. “Sometimes,” he answered.
Felipe nodded.
“Five-six-seven--”
"You're right," admitted Sherlock softly. "I was trying to impress you." He squeezed John’s hand. “And I’ve only been in one relationship. If you can even call it that,” he admitted.
“I am upset…”
John responded immediately, his lips on Sherlock’s, his body wrapping around him and holding him close. “You taste so good,” whispered John between kisses. “Tell me what to do next.”
“Examine your patient. Ask them if they are injured elsewhere. Absence of proof is not proof of absence, yeah?” said John, looking expectantly at Felipe, who shook his head while wincing in pain. John quickly examined the Spaniard from head to toe, at one point lifting the tail of his shirt to reveal a large, mangled scar on his abdomen. He quickly covered him back up. “Now, clean and stitch the wound.”
“If I’d listened -” John grew choked on each word. He swallowed to keep his composure, but failed. “Bees. You wanted to keep bees, and I pushed you into something you didn’t want to do, because I thought…” He looked away for a moment to wipe the tears from his face. “The work meant everything to Sherlock. I thought if you had the work...but, that’s not it, either. I knew you hated it, yet I kept insisting, because I needed it. I needed you to be him because I needed to be me again. It was a selfish thing to do.”
“My goodness, what are all these?” she asked, pointing to a stack of white cloths in a basket next to Mrs. Hudson’s bed.
“Would it be so bad?”
John shifted his weight off of Sherlock, giving him room to move.
“Impressive, yes,” mumbled Sherlock. “Don’t tell Mycroft. They were obscenely expensive.”
John eyed the former footman and his maid for a moment.
Sherlock cocked the gun. Moriarty creeped closer to John. Sherlock stole another glance, and their eyes met. John appeared angry, frustrated and worried, but not fearful. Sherlock took a deep breath, and forced his brain to work while his lips continued to indulge in Moriarty’s worthless banter.
Sherlock bent down and sweetly placed a chaste kiss on her cheek. Molly’s heart leapt into her throat, her body alive and buzzing.
"Show me your rudiments," Brook snaps.
John continued. “You’re still not sleeping, you’re not eating…”
More sweat trickled down his temple, down his back. He found himself losing control of the instrument, of the tone, of the note, of the sound. No longer was his violin under his command. He only heard an annoying wail, a sound like a child’s wind-up toy.
Sherlock was confused. Why did it matter if he liked it?
“So you are,” said Mycroft, turning to the pale and rather thin man at his side. “How are you feeling?”
“Good riddance,” snarled Mr. Thomas.
John found Lestrade and Felipe quietly talking in the sitting room.
He rose from the cot and quietly opened the door. The raucous was coming from outside the building. The voices were numerous, shouting in anger, then suddenly quieted down.
Sherlock shook his head. "I promise," he replied. Another lie.
“No, I will,” he said, turning to Lestrade. “First, come inside. Let your men rest and eat.”
Sherlock left on a cold, foggy Tuesday morning, and he was gone for nine months.
“Yes. Family.”
“Brilliant Plan B,” whispered John, his chapped lips grazing Sherlock’s smooth ones.
Sherlock didn’t stop his kisses, only slowed his lips. “Yes, you are. Shut up and let me kiss you,” he said softly, pushing John back against the headboard. He reached up and pulled at the string binding John's nightshirt.
John felt a bit of panic creep into his elated disposition, but kept his poker face in check.
John laid there, wide awake, guilt-ridden and terrified. Ahad’s cries of grief played over and over in his mind.
He handed him a new pack of L&Ms and his own silver lighter.
“I bet you never saw this coming.”
John awoke early the next morning at William’s side. He’d once again slept in the chair next to the bed, and his back was beginning to revolt. He needed to lie down.
The old man howled with glee as he rushed forward to embrace the young surgeon. He squeezed him so hard it pushed the breath clean out of John’s lungs.
It made him sick.
-----------
“What is it?”
“Fine!” he grumbled. “You’re way, always your way.” He pulled out the envelope they had found in the bank’s deposit box.
Find the unicorn! (thanks to a brilliant suggestion from BanimalQ)
They lay there for quite some time in the darkness until Sherlock’s breathing finally became even and deep.
Mr Frank appeared in the doorway.
“What did he say?” asked John.
“After we argued, I went to the flat. Raibert said you were at hospital, so I started home. But then I ran into Victor Trevor.”
John wasn’t sure if he could make it up the stairs, let alone to Provence, but he managed a small nod.
"Don't be stupid, John."
The taller man wrapped his long legs around John's waist. John leaned in and stroked the Spaniard’s large, leaking prick over and over as he mouthed at the dark hairs on his chest. He took a nipple inbetween his teeth and flicked his tongue teasingly, enjoying Felipe's gasps and squirms.
“I know you didn’t eat dinner, Mr. Holmes. Did you manage breakfast?”
But instead, he found no reaction to his words. He had called the Earl of Cornwall’s brother by his Christian name and no one had noticed. In fact, everyone seemed pleased he was there, taking an interest in his well-being.
-------
John slid his arm underneath Sherlock's knees and stood up, easily carrying him into the next room. He laid him on the bed and settled on top of him, pulling the robe off within seconds. John, still fully clothed, pressed a naked Sherlock into the bed, kissing him and stroking him and pushing his elegant, white knees wide open with his palms.
John coughed and spit his water across the room, most of it landing on Sherlock.
To John's surprise, Sherlock reached across the table and laced his fingers through his own.
John eagerly watched the perspiration gather along his lover’s dark hairline, the hair beginning to revert back to it’s wild, curly state from the humidity and exertion.
William takes matters into his own hands, and the results are disastrous.
“Here, take it,” he said placing it in John's trembling hand. “Use it wisely. This along with your final wages should be enough to get you to Luss.”
“Mycroft mentioned my time London, but he did not mention you.”
“Harry just texted. She’ll be here any minute,” says John, dropping the duffel bag heavily onto the floor.
“It was for a case,” the good doctor said slowly, his eyes knitted in concentration.
Felipe giggled and slid off the barrel. He placed a large hand along John's cheek.
“I think she fell,” said Liza. “I heard a terrible crash, and I found her at the bottom of the stairs.” She began to weep.
John turned down his reading lamp low, and checked to make sure his door was locked before crawling under the covers. He continued to read, and after several minutes, came to this passage.
His stomach was in knots remembering the way he'd ended things with Felipe. He’d only been honest about his feelings for Sherlock. Yet, even after all these years, the thought of Felipe leaving without saying goodbye still made John shrink with shame.
"Sherlock!" he sobbed, as the consulting detective leaned forward and fucked him so hard into the table the legs creaked and bowed.
Fortuitously, at that same moment, the butler entered to informed the marquess that additional guest had arrived. He left the two men to their own devices in the library, and Sherlock quickly jumped up and was by John’s side in seconds.
“I don’t want to forget it,” he said. He approached him and tried to take his hand, but he was shaking so hard he forced his arm back down to his side. “Tell me. Tell me what you want.”
“I do,” John seethed.
"Yes."
William seemed reluctant to speak. He rested the glass still half-full of spirit on his knee.
“Yo estaré con usted momentáneamente,” said a female voice from the back.
The violin and bow dropped to his sides. He waited, chest heaving, sweat trickling down his back, for Brooks’s reaction.
“It’s alright,” soothed John. “We’ll get through this.”
“Wait, stop!” John shouted.“Come back!”
John looks at Sherlock, who refuses to look back. John sighs.
John ignored him and ate quickly, shoving the soup and bread in his mouth so he could leave.
“He took the gun,” John growled. “That idiot took my gun.” He pulled at his hair and paced the floor in fury.
*****
He fell back into the grass in slow motion, landing hard on his coccyx.
“Look at his profile, particularly his photographs,” Sherlock instructed.
Friday's weather was clear and beautiful, much to John’s disappointment. He was secretly hoping for a spring snowstorm that would cancel the dinner, but it was not to be. The two men set out on the train and arrived at Halidon Hall by 5 o'clock. They entered through the main door, something John had never done out of uniform in all the years he’d lived there.
The carriage dropped them off at Englischer Hoff, an inn near the the village center, and an older man, presumed to be the innkeeper, greeted them at the door.
John’s eyes went wide. He looked over at the Earl, whose jaw was tense.
Once the murderer (the household’s cook) was handed over to the authorities, the two men happily limped home. They ate breakfast heartily and recounted the story to Mrs. Hudson and Marie with a rare excitement normally reserved for Christmas or an out of town visitor.
No one in the room reacted to the outburst.
The heat grew between them and the kisses became urgent. Both the men moaned into each other’s mouths as they refused to separate for even a moment, blissfully aware of every centimeter of skin that rubbed together, causing friction and desire and the need to fill each other up, to become one again.
John looked up at him in awe, his voice trembling as he quoted the lines he'd memorized, the words that made him burn with feelings he hadn't understood until it had been too late.
When John didn't budge, he reluctantly, angrily stomped back to the train.
"Please," he pleaded, his voice cracking. "Don't ask me leave. And don't ever leave me again. I can't bear it. I'm so sorry. I just
Sherlock knew his retreat was imminent. He attempted to retrieve the mask, but it was nowhere to be found in and around the pounding and running water.
It was later than usual in the servant's hall when everyone sat down to eat their supper. Everyone chewed in relative silence until Anderson opened his mouth.
Peter stepped forward respectfully, his hands clasped in front of his thighs.
“Watson,” whispered Sherlock. He stood there helplessly, wishing his valet would say something, even if it were in anger.
A shuffle and loud creak below them broke the moment. The released each other, both panting, John’s fist still wrapped in Sherlock’s coat.
The kitchen maid stood off to the side, eyes wide and twisting a towel between her fingers. Her eyes floated back and forth from the flame to the handsome Sherlock, who was oblivious to the chaos he was causing.
John nodded. "He hates me now."
“Need to shut that mouth,” he said mockingly. “I know, I’ll shut it for you.”  The man undid his fly, and pulled out his small, pathetic cock.
“What’s her name?”
He held Sherlock down and began to fuck him roughly, pressing his body deep into the mattress.  Sherlock held on to him for dear life as John’s palms pushed against the back of his skinny thighs and forced his knees to open wider, his mouth suddenly covered by John’s mouth, his whimpers muffled by John’s tongue. He pounded into Sherlock, in and out, over and over and over again, his sweat dripping onto his Sherlock’s cheeks and running down his neck, Sherlock’s body aching from the abuse.
“I don't know,” he said softly. His hand shook so violently he dropped the vial onto the floor. It landed with a clatter onto the tile.
“Dr. Watson, do sit!’ said Irene. “We want to hear about your time in Morocco. I heard you successfully fought off a terrible outbreak enteric fever.”
“‘Course,” answered John.
“Where?” demanded Sherlock.
“Watson,” asked Dimmock, “Why didn’t you tell us you saved his lordship’s life in the war?”
In the weeks and months that followed, John’s wounds finally healed but his limp remained. He felt foolish for what he had done, but Sherlock never said another word about it. In fact, it seemed to have strengthened their friendship, if John dared call it that. Sherlock was an oasis full of life and adventure when everything else around him was dull and hopeless, and he was grateful. His lordship had a different way of approaching the world that John found refreshing and exciting.
He gripped the straps of his bursting backpack and carefully made his way through the narrow archway. He was greeted by an immediate fifteen meter drop.
“Quite,” answered Sherlock. He looked Victor square in the eye. “I had no idea Maestro Brook was a man of so many talents.” He leaned, his lips near the older student’s reddening ear. “He is lucky to have you as his confidant, nem fielaan?”
Finally a dry day allowed John to open his windows and doors at the little apothecary. He aired out the room and dusted and swept up. Several villagers came by with routine problems. He took inventory of his supplies and was confused when he found a considerable amount of morphine and cocaine missing from his stockroom.
Sherlock felt the warmth of John’s palm surround his own as they turned around and carefully began the journey back to the entrance. John kept his other hand along the wall, leading the way.
It had happened before. So many times before.
“I respectfully request that I be called William, instead of Sherlock,” he said softly. “It is my name, my first name. I feel this is reasonable to ask of you all."
“He’s alive! Help him! He’s alive!”
It was in that moment, unbeknownst to both men at the time, that Sherlock Holmes fell in love with John Watson.
“No,” said Sherlock simply. He turned to walk back down the stairs.
He dropped to his knees and held Sherlock’s face in his hands.
Throughout dinner, John felt strange sitting with Sherlock while others served him. The food was delicious. Friedrich was joined by another colleague, Fritz Marchiarch, also a scientist. All three were talking shop in German. John enjoyed his dessert and people watched until the men had worn themselves out.
Sherlock hid a smile. He pointed to the sign on the door.
Donovan nodded. “Oh, yes, quite.”
Donovan extended his hand, but William managed only a nod. He wiped his large, sweaty palms over his trousers and finally, extended a shaky limb.
“Now let us hope for both our sakes I remember how.”
“His lordship wishes to know if you will be dining with the family this evening,” said John.
“I’m afraid I’m feeling rather skittish, John. I need to wander a bit.”
John turned as the Spaniard paused in thought. His brow wrinkled in concern.
John gripped at the nape of the man's long, graceful neck as he wrapped a solid arm around his too-thin waist. He gasped as he felt Sherlock’s hard length brush against his stomach. He thought of how he wanted to touch it, how it would feel like his own, hot and smooth and firm.
...that never came.
“Am I on Punk’d?” he said seriously.
“You didn’t know,” said John. “How devastating.”
John broke the kiss long enough to whisper:
Ahad smiled. “It has been an honor to learn from you, Dr. Watson.”
“There’s more in my quarters,” said Felipe. “Ahad, please go fetch it.”
Peter led them up the stairs and to their room, which was a beautiful, two bedroom suite that, like the old man said, overlooked the river.
“It was brilliant,” said John. “I wish you could have gone. There was a lady whose singing I thought would shatter the windows.”
At first, Mr. Thomas had the good sense not to encourage him, but the laughter was infectious, and he found himself giggling along with his younger cohort. When they finally managed to get ahold of themselves, Mr. Thomas leaned forward and grasped John tightly by the shoulders.
It only took a minute or so, and Sherlock was coming with jagged swells of breath and deep grunts as he curled forward, almost in half, with John pumping the last bit of sweet come out of his partner's aching cock.
Mr. Thomas considered him for a moment, then nodded.
“I didn’t mean to wake you.”
The next morning, Sherlock walked into the main hall for his morning music theory class when a pretty young woman stopped him in the hallway.
The young man began coughing. This time, he did not refuse the canteen.
John had his hands buried in his pockets, his head down, face tucked deeply into his coat as he walked. His eyes were downcast, as if he truly wished he were anywhere else.
She practically ran out of the chip shop, brushing up against Sherlock as he hailed a cab.
John raised his head, his eyes puffed up from emotion. “What?” He answered pathetically. “Why?”
“Johnny, your mother should be very proud,” he said, grinning at Mrs. Watson. “You have taken to service like a duck to water.”
Finally, John was instructed by Mycroft and Lady Irene to knock on Lord Sherlock’s door and insist he come downstairs.
The door swings open once again, and Brook bounces inside, a wide smile on his face. He seems surprised to find Sherlock is still in the room.
When they finally emerged through the hidden door and back out into the crisp, night air, John collapsed against the old monastery and took a generous swig from a canteen hidden in his rucksack. He offered it to Sherlock, who obliged.
The Inspector gathered it up and handed it to the doctor. In turn, Donovan helped John up the stairs, and they met Felipe on the bridge near the guardhouse entrance.
He suddenly turned exceedingly pale and slid off the bar. John jumped up and kept him from falling.
“I think so.”
Brook cleared his throat and stepped heavily onto the podium. He observed the orchestra, looking thoroughly bored.
“Well that was quite exciting,” murmured John as he refilled his glass.
“I've got over a year left on my fellowship,” John said carefully.
A couple walked by, arm in arm, laughing and talking. Both men glanced up and watched them pass.
His body froze. He shot John a frightened look, then looked away. His chin drew taut against his jawline as his neck and chest turned a deep pink.
John grinned.
