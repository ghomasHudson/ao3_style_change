And still, he can't stop.
"Yes. And we were hoping you might want to help us," Tony added.
Steve pressed a light kiss on Tony's cheek. "That's okay. I'm used to it."
"Always, in these things," Steve promised.
He'd originally planned to prevent the kidnapping without having to talk to Tony at all, but after ending up out here, and after keeping an eye on Tony as he slept through the sedation, he'd almost started looking forward to having a conversation. He hadn't been expecting overflowing gratitude, or that Tony would forget all the bad blood between them at the drop of a hat, but he'd thought Tony would at least acknowledge Steve's helpfulness, even if it was in a quippy, off-hand manner. More than that, he'd been sure Tony would see that the smartest course of action would be to stick together, just for the sake of survival. During the quiet hours of his vigil, Steve had painted an entire picture in his head of the two of them traversing the wilderness together, the shared predicament bringing them closer and helping them put the past behind them.
After they'd caught and secured Loki, the demigod who'd stolen the Tesseract, Steve and Tony faced one another properly for the first time. Standing at the back of the Quinjet, Tony took off his helmet, his big brown eyes meeting Steve's, and—there was something about him that Steve couldn't put a finger on that set him on edge, sent a shiver down his spine and made his pulse jump uncomfortably. If he'd ever felt like someone was walking over his grave, this was it.
"That wasn't you," Steve said, as much to himself as to Tony. He had to cling to that. If he didn't, the betrayal would make everything hurt even worse.
Tony glared at him. "You think I'm too pampered to handle one night on the floor, Rogers? I'll have you know, I've slept on all kinds of hard surfaces plenty of times. Sure, most of those involved booze, but still. Nothing new." He walked over to the bed, grabbed a pillow and a blanket, and dropped them on the rug. "There, I'm all set."
Steve should've been afraid, probably. He'd seen what Tony and that artifact could do—since it was looking more and more likely that Tony had caused the fires, and was in fact the mysterious burning man. The only sliver of hope that might free him from responsibility was that someone else had been using the artifact those times, but Steve wasn't sure he could bring himself to believe that.
Tony's not too fond of the idea of handing the thirium reactor design over to Kamski, but really, at this point, he thinks Kamski is less likely to turn it into something lethal than the R&D people back at SI. Besides, this way, he'll get to decide how to present it to him, and maybe he can keep some crucial details to himself. It definitely leaves him with more control over the situation than most alternatives.
As for the two of them—Pepper never asked Tony whether he wanted to test if they were a match. He didn't bring it up, either. It was obvious enough that they weren't. No need to rub it in.
"What's your name?" Lina asked.
The ceratopsian knelt to bring his riders closer to the ground. "I don't know. I don't think so," Bucky replied gravely. He grabbed Tony by the armpits and lowered him to Steve over the dinosaur's side.
Could she have meant it in the most concrete sense? That Tony wasn't Tony at all, but someone else posing as him? He would've loved to think that; to believe that the Tony he'd once known lived on somewhere else, but he couldn't bring himself to. It would be wishful thinking to reach for such a far-flung explanation. Combined clone and identity theft was one of the worst crimes out there, and even if he could imagine someone wanting to supplant Tony, he couldn't see anyone actually succeeding. Tony wasn't just one of the richest people on the planet, he was also among the most intelligent.
"He has?" That was unexpected. Would it have been before or after Steve had met Tony last night? He couldn't very well mention the encounter to her without risking his secret identity, so he asked, "How can you be sure he's not been, say, kidnapped?"
"Congratulations on your very successful first mission," the Mayor said to Bucky, a pleased smile on her lips. "Ambushing that caravan and bringing Stark to us through that lizard-infested jungle was no mean feat."
"Hey," Steve said cautiously, his hand settling on Tony's shoulder to massage it. "You okay?"
Everything hurt, worse than anything Bucky had ever felt. Even thinking. The worst of all was his arm. Starting from his left shoulder, he felt nothing except brightly flaring agony, as if the entire limb were on fire. When he tried to take a deep breath, it sent him coughing, the fire spreading to his lungs as well, suffocating him. For a a small eternity, all he could do was cling to consciousness, because he was sure that if he let go, he wouldn't wake up again.
Tony kept going, speaking of the passionate affair he'd ended up having with her, which Steve couldn't help but feel slightly envious about. But some time after they'd left Venice and Tony ended up on a tangent about foreign politics and how he'd eventually found himself in Siberia, Steve lost track of the story, lulled to sleep by Tony's voice and the sound of his heartbeat mixing with the thrum of the ever mysterious repulsor pump.
Iron Man by night, genetic match-maker wannabe by day. Who would've thought. His life was so weird now. A lot of the time, he actually liked it.
Steve wasn't particularly familiar with the New York University campus, and it took him some asking around to even figure out where to start. Fortunately, the people he asked were always happy to help Captain America. Eventually, he found his way to an office in the massive main building overlooking Washington Square Park, where a lady behind a desk was able to inform him of the particular location of Dr. Hansen's office. She was quite emphatic with the title, which Steve hadn't caught earlier.
Tony leaned closer, putting his arms around Steve's waist, standing on tiptoe so that their noses almost touched. "I was hoping you might help me with that, like you said, the last time we talked."
"What are you waiting for?" the Kingpin shouted. "Finish him!"
"You're from Indiana, you said?" Stark asked him. Bucky was surprised he even remembered it.
He was going for a gun. He was cornered, and he knew that any investigation would be rendered pointless if Tony was dead.
Occasionally, he glances in the direction where he last spotted Steve. Once, he thinks he sees a figure on a hill in the distance. He wonders if Steve is still stalking him. It would be hilarious if Steve were as obsessed with him as he is with Steve, but that's probably just wishful thinking on his part.
Both the reptilian and Barton were shouting after him, but there were no gunshots as he pushed his way out through the door—and almost collided with Natalie Rushman, who was waiting outside.
Steve sets Tony down on the bed, stretching out his legs and laying his arms by his sides. With the low light hiding his deathly pale complexion, it looks as if he might be just sleeping.
Steve examined the shoulder anyway, and agreed with Rhodey's own assessment; no broken bones or serious tissue damage, as far as he could tell. He then joined the two others in the task of removing the remaining pieces of armor. No one said much, the despair of their situation hanging heavy in the air.
Tony has no idea what to do or how to feel about this whole situation, in general. He's really not dealing with it. It's way too early for this. Not that it'd ever be the right time.
As much as Steve knew that the body Tony was admiring was just a fake and not his own, that hungry look was still flattering, and a huge turn-on, enough so that his cock was starting to harden.
Rhodey takes Tony's android spare part life support in stride, once Tony manages to convince him that it's not going to explode. It's the easiest of the conversations Tony has on the topic; a prelude to challenges awaiting him.
"I'm pretty sure I do, actually," Steve said, but didn't pause to elaborate on all the different frames he'd been wearing in the past while Tony completely took him apart. Instead, he kept one hand still on Tony's front, mapping that gorgeous expanse of skin, feeling his shivering abdominal muscles, his heart pounding under his ribs. With his other hand, he took hold of Tony's fingers to bring them to his lips, licking at them and then sucking them into his mouth.
Natasha glanced at Pepper, her lips curling into a small smile. "You don't need to protect me, dear. I'm fine with this," she told her, then turned to face the rest of the group again. "Like most of you, I wasn't born on this island. But unlike all of you, when I first crawled up onto the shores of Dinotopia, it was on the north coast."
"It's past midday," Rhodey reminded him.
Steve doubled his efforts, using all the strength of will that he had, but he was already too far gone. There was no air. There was nothing he could do; he couldn't even control his thoughts, let alone his body. There was just pure, primitive terror, because he knew he was dying and there was no way out.
Tony froze, frowning at Steve like he couldn't parse the words. "You should probably take some more time to think about that."
He headed back into the ruined building, looking around for any clues he might've missed. The spot where he'd found Tony was as they'd left it; the beams hadn't collapsed any further, and the small space where Tony had been stuck was still open. Moving as cautiously as he could, Steve peered into it.
"That must've been scary," Steve said. He shifted position, settling lower against Tony's shoulder, holding on to the blanket so that it wouldn't slip away. "Tell me another one."
The meeting with the local elders turned out to be a waste of time. They had no information to give on the Northerners' strongholds, and the very suggestion of sending out a rescue party was met with suspicion and reluctance.
"For people who aren't skybax riders, that would be catching a sky galley from one of the summit villages in the mountains, but they don't run towards the north on a regular schedule," Sam replied thoughtfully.
"All she wanted was to discuss a few more details about tomorrow. Strictly business. Now I'm all yours, " Steve said. He managed a smile, though it didn't feel natural at all. He certainly wouldn't use this frame for any kind of a covert operation.
He let out a low chuckle. Here he was, comparing the merits of different ways to die. Almost like the good old days before Dinotopia. Except that back then, he'd usually had Rhodey to tell him he was being stupid.
When Friday finally told him the time was up, he could've sworn it'd been hours.
"What happened to Jarvis?" he asked, remembering the crisp accent of Tony's AI, who'd been ever-present in his workshop and his cars.
********************
"I know exactly how that goes, and I understand. I just wanted to tell you that you don't need to put on a brave face for me," Steve said. "You never think any less of me if I admit that I'm weary and hurting, right? You shouldn't think any less of yourself, either."
Holding his ear over Tony's mouth and nose gave him his answer, and it was exactly the one he'd feared: he didn't feel or hear the slightest whisper of air. The blue light in the chest of Tony's armor had gone out. Steve had read his file, and he knew Tony needed that to live.
"If he does miraculously return, what's going to happen next?" Rhodes asked.
It took a while for Tony to pick up. It occurred to Steve that Tony was probably so busy running his company and working on his countless engineering projects that he might not have time for random phone calls. Steve was considering if he should just send an email instead or wait and call again later when Tony finally answered.
Tony didn't seem scared in the least. "I'd like to find out how convincing it is under close scrutiny. So, how about it, soldier? I know you've got all night." He took half a step backwards, giving Steve another suggestive look.
"Of course."
"Well, you know, there are things that I usually do that he could take care of. Making coffee, taking out the trash, sorting out the dry cleaning. Basic chores," Pepper lists.
He loved Tony.
"I hope they're not permanently inert. Not much use then," Tony sneered, and nodded towards the door. "Luckily, I've got us covered."
"Tony! So, so nice to see you again, and in one piece, too," Hammer said, shaking Tony's hand and patting him on the bicep.
Tony was opening his arms in clear invitation, and without a word, Steve grabbed him in a tight hug. Tony clung to him, fingers digging into Steve's shoulder blades, and Steve held him close, one hand on the small of his back, the other up at his neck, which was unmarred, no longer damaged, like it had been in framespace. His chest felt smooth against Steve's as well, without the circle of hard metal in the middle. As much as Steve knew that this was virtual, he relished every second and every detail of it, the warmth of Tony's body pressing into his, the illusion of his heart beating close to Steve's.
The stairs leading to the loft would be challenging to negotiate while carrying someone, so Steve went for the easier and closer option instead. The sheepskin rug was only a few steps away, and looked soft and inviting. Moving very carefully, Steve crossed the floor to it and set Tony down on the rug, where he lay down on his back.
“That part did happen,” Steve admitted. He could feel his cheeks heating up. “Look, Tony, I want to apologize for taking advantage of you like that, it was–”
"That's great!" Bucky exclaimed, glad and relieved to hear that Stark had come to his senses before it was too late.
"You can't be," Tony insisted, ignoring Steve's question.
Tony took hold of the other one as well, his fingers pinching tighter. When Steve still didn't react, he kept increasing the pressure, but that was all it felt like: pressure, without any excitement to it.
He made it to the door and outside, where he realized he didn't feel like catching the subway to go home, so he hailed a taxi instead. The look on his face must've been very grim; beyond asking him where he wanted to go, the driver didn't say a thing to him.
Tony was suspicious, but he went anyway, because if it was from her, he wanted to know what she had to say—his last memories of her were vague, as were all his memories about what had happened at the Fountain. He was hoping she could shed some light on those events. If it wasn't from her, well, he had no idea who might've forged it or why, and he'd like to find out.
Steve clasped Tony's hand between both of his. "It definitely does. There's just a few things that need to be sorted out first, like the fact that I'm a fugitive and not supposed to be here at all." He hated to bring any of that up right now, but since they seemed to be taking the first, tentative steps towards a future together, it couldn't really be avoided.
As sad as he felt on his own, what was even worse was telling Tony's friends.
“I’m pretty sure he meant attention from someone who’s qualified and knows what they’re doing,” Tony pointed out. “That won’t be available until I fix the quinjet and we get out of this damned dust bowl.” He’d sat up, his palm against the floor. He was still making a very good effort at covering up how he felt, but Steve saw right through it. Tony’s face had gone a shade paler under the bloodstains, and his breathing was superficial, like it would be, to minimize the movement of cracked ribs.
Of course, he didn't even know if these inklings he had of Tony's moods were correct. It wasn't as if Tony was going to admit that he was, for whatever reason, currently as nervous as he might've been standing next to Ultron.
"No. Not all of them. Not anymore," Steve said firmly. "It won't be easy, but we'll put up a damn good fight, and we won't give up. Even if it's going to take another decade, or a whole century, in the end, we'll win."
He raised Tony's hand to his lips, pressing a kiss against the lifeless fingers. "Tony, please. I'm right here. Come back to me."
Kamski flashes him a smile over the video connection. It's probably meant to look magnanimous; Tony finds it sleazy. "You're welcome. What are friends for, eh?"
That was the plan, now: Tony was going to dedicate his time and his money to repairing and rebuilding the property he'd damaged on his fiery rampages. This was the consensus of an off the record meeting with some of the higher-ups from the police and fire departments. Tony wasn't sure how much of his account of the events they had believed. Even in a world where men like Toro and Captain America were widely known, Tony's particular powers and their origin sounded outlandish. Still, they had accepted Cap's insistence that Tony had only ever acted in self-defense.
He'd guessed it might've been a long time, but he'd expected perhaps a decade or two. Not the best part of a century.
Steve frowned. He'd heard that name before. "Your mentor? The news archives said he died."
"I'm ready when you are," Tony said, without a moment's hesitation.
Looking around, he spotted Bucky to his left, closing manacles around the wrists of someone who must be the guard he'd taken down. To his right, in the far corner, was Pearly-eye.
Tony walked into the hand-washing area of a public restroom, where he pulled a gun out of a shoulder holster and, without hesitation, took aim and fired. It was a blaster of some kind, a new design Steve wasn't familiar with. The results were not pretty; the force of the blast flung Tony backwards and nearly severed his head at the neck. There was a lot of blood. Even though Steve had seen plenty of bloodshed, and even though he'd just been talking to Tony and knew he'd survived the incident, watching it still made him shudder, his throat tight, his hands clenched in fists.
Sam feels like he should apologize, maybe, but Tony doesn't seem to notice him anymore; he's dropped to his knees by Steve's unmoving form, and is reaching his arms around Steve. Steve looks half dead, frost clinging to his eyelashes, the skin of his jaw marble-white below his mask, his lips tinged with blue. He doesn't react at all when Tony lifts him up.
Luckily, the wait wasn't too long. Sooner that Bucky would've expected, Stark stopped to lean against a large propped-up metal plate, his eyes closed. "Done," he said in Dinotopian, his voice almost inaudible.
Steve searches every square inch of the room, and comes up with no clues regarding his location, let alone a phone. All in all, the place doesn't seem like anyone's home, but rather like some kind of a free-to-use shelter.
He felt so content with Tony's warm body pressed against his, and so worn out now that all the tension of the past weeks had faded away, that he very nearly drifted off to sleep. What brought him out of that drowsy state was a shaky breath against his collarbone and a few soft sniffling sounds.
He kept checking the time. The minutes were inching forwards so very slowly. Even looking at the watch reminded him of Tony: it had been damaged by the explosion and the sea water when Steve had ended up on the island, and Tony had fixed it for him.
Tony waking up was impossible to miss. He groaned loudly as he sat up, stretched his arms and rolled his neck, then demanded, “What the hell was in that drink?”
"So, you learned a lesson. Yay. Could've picked up any outdoor survival guidebook for that nugget of wisdom," Tony quips.
The lady looked back at him with some concern in her eyes. "Sorry—do you know her?"
He watched the man lead Tony not to the front door, but to a door at the back, and out of the room. No one else seemed to be paying any attention to them.
Steve cast one last glance at his birth frame in the stasis box. If he'd only ever been in that frame, Tony wouldn't have looked at him twice. He kept telling himself that he didn't mind. It wasn't as if this thing between them was anything more than casual fun anyway, and it would never be more than that. He was going to enjoy the ride while it lasted.
In the daze of this realization, it took him a while to notice the strange tight, tingling feeling around his pinky. He raised his hand and slowly uncurled his fingers, first wondering if he'd hurt himself throwing that last, savage punch, but the touch of crimson that he saw on his finger was not blood.
He settled into as comfortable a position as he could find, his head tucked into the nook of Tony's shoulder, the blanket-hooded top of his head just beneath the rim of Tony's helmet.
More scientific articles soon followed the first one, confirming the finding: it was an irrefutable fact that there were pairs of people in the world who had repeated shared strings of nucleotides in their genomes that no one else had. Those same people also experienced this mysterious, but very much measurable, connection when they were in one another's presence. Since Persons with Identical Non-Coding Sequences was a mouthful, it morphed into PINCS. Tony was sure the scientist who had first come up with the original phrase cringed every time the cutesy acronym was used.
Tony was a precedence. An opportunity to make an example, to show the world just how serious the Accords should be taken. And he's fine with that, really, he is. Six months probation is nothing, especially since he's still permitted to lead the team. Except for the implication that they're now on a three-strikes system. Or, no, they're mostly European - a yellow card/red card system, then. One more strike and Tony is out until he is deemed fit again. A rule for the entire Avengers system, there entirely by Tony's mistakes.
and he loved them and now his last moment with his parents, vibrant and alive, had been ripped away and replaced with a cold bunker in Siberia, Captain America at his shoulder. He'd lost them all over again.
"Are you using your delicate emotional state to finagle a hug out of me, Spiderling?" Peter frowns, his arms starting to lower hesitantly and Tony figures 'fuck it.' Just attach a free hug sign to him because apparently this is his life now. Hugging Peter is strange and for a moment makes him violently miss Harley Keener, but its nice, too. In its own way. Repeat performances won't be necessary. "And you called me manipulative."
The director's assistant ignored him, pointing an accusing (and armored) finger
"And when are you going to stop?" Steve asked, voice carefully even and dangerously quiet. It would completely distract anyone from noticing his shaking hands. "When is enough going to be enough?"
Hope. That's the watchword.
“Well,” Steve says, clearing his throat when the one word comes out choked. “I never much had the chance to see it from this view.”
"You should get used to that feeling," Sam snorts.
Above him, FRIDAY cheerfully announces that Aleksander Lukin has just been appointed as Secretary of State. There is a full body scan of Peter's multiple injuries on his interface and the memory of Hope and Clint's disquieted faces in his head. The formula spins around him. The door to the lab slides open and Bruce is at his side, trying to get his attention.
"I'll do it," Tony answers, heading for the door. "You staying the night, Wakanda?" The Panther nods and Tony leaves him to his devices, heading upstairs. Maybe the world won't be so bleak for Kamala after all.
Kamala's genetic makeup. Terrigenesis replicates itself in a person's blood stream and bonds to their cells, but when every single reaction creates a different outcome it's impossible for the body to survive. That Kamala did is a miracle. But he hasn't suspected until now that HYDRA has meant for this to happen. They're not trying to create one army of super soldiers, they're trying to create an army of Enhanced, like Wanda.
"Oh, an appreciation," Tony echoes, smiling wide if a bit false and crossing his hands behind his neck. "Well, I'm always open to
And now its everybody's.
Neither one of them had ever trusted the other to stay.
"I'm not," he told Tiberius, but it was weak.
"Tony."
"Not Wakanda, then. Somewhere people don't have the resources to help themselves. Third world countries where the military would sooner spit on their graves then lift a finger to help, places where the military are the ones doing the killing," Steve snaps back. "Or, hell, even places like New York City. The police did the best they could but it wasn't enough. If we hadn't have been there New York would be a radioactive wasteland and Loki would likely still be around raising hell."
Far enough away to be shielded from the group's cheeriness but not so far that they wouldn't know it when she started talking about them, Amora sat with Baron Zemo and scoffed at the display. "Look at these fools. Laughing. Joking.
There is a hand on his shoulder and Tony jolts. Butterfingers rolls a few threatening feet forward, extinguisher aloft, and Kamala retracts her arm way too far before raising her hands in surrender. "Sorry! I just, I know that - I am really grateful, Mr. Stark. Thank you."
"I had him on the ropes," he said. With the cloth in the way it came out more like
"Captain." And then she's gone, and Steve is left with the hum of Bucky's chamber and the traces of Wanda's perfume.
"I am sorry." Barnes' whisper breaks on the last word, and Tony wants to run, feels his feet press harder into the floor on reflex, back muscles clenching. He slides his hands to the edge of the table and holds on.
He had developed a device that can alter memories, preventing a trigger sequence. It has already been tested and works in practice.
Tony lets her have the abrupt change in topic. "What was it, then?"
He does things you wouldn't.
“Cap needs to up his game if he thinks that will hurt me,” he said dully, and he was such a terrible liar. “I only hear it every other day.”
Fury leans forward into Steve's space. "And that's some real pretty talk, Captain, but tell me this: are you fighting for you or are you fighting for them?"
"I'm not the hold up here," Tony says snottily as they traipse out into the hallway. It's hard to remember that he can't lean on Rhodey the way he used to. "Hey," he tells them. "We should take Lukin's deal. Sharon Carter? I think it might be good for us."
“My Steve,” Tony parroted with a self-deprecating chuckle. “No. I didn’t. It probably wouldn’t have mattered if I had. AC/DC and
He cocks his head, the line of his shoulders stiffening without conscious thought, bracing himself. Wanda drops her uplifted hand like a guillotine. "You bring him hope and terror in equal measure. A future at the cost of reliving his past. It's unkind to him."
Where is that bottle of scotch? Tony could have sworn he put it right next to his foot, but it's not there when he looks. "You saw where Barnes was found innocent of the UN bombing in Vienna? Guy called Zemo framed him, lured us, me, Barnes, Rogers, to Siberia. T'Challa found him and took him in and apparently he spilled his guts to Ross. Not surprising, the man
count?”
This is how Bruce finds him.
"Nobody lets J Jonah Jameson do anything," Peter grumbles, but he smiles gratefully at Tony. He's a extraordinary kid, Parker, genuinely good and brave. A hero, through and through. Tony feels lucky to have met him.
He'd never quite mastered that lesson.
"I think T'Challa has some intent to show you around the capital tonight," Shuri says, side-eyeing him like T'Challa's intentions are beyond her. "But you will remember where you are, won't you, Dr. Stark?"
Ultron had been his biggest. Tony works everyday to make sure its not unfixable but the task seems insurmountable.
His voice is unbearably small, but Natasha's is somehow smaller. "He's still my friend, Tony."
He harangues them out of the training room and off to their respective suites and/or basements as he himself heads through a disassembly line for the suit. "
"I never exaggerate, Ty, I leave that up to you. You're the professional."
Maybe Steve even wanted it too. Tony did, in his heart of hearts. A legion of Avengers, together, connected. Helping each other and protecting the world. An Avengers
“Rebuilding,” he guesses, and Tony rolls fond eyes at him.
Tony tries but the floors are too hard now, concrete instead of dirt, and when he looks up he can see his reflection in the glass of five different cryogenic tanks. He is twenty one years old and his parents are about to die.
"It does make things easier," Sam quips as he scuttles back a few feet. Sure enough, not ten seconds later a speck of black appears in the air that expands outwards to stretch five feet across and at least seven feet high. Cloak and Fury step out of the inky blackness and Cloak waits patiently for Shuri's go-ahead before closing the portal behind him with a swish of his wrist.
NATASHA:
“Hank Pym can’t tell me anything I don’t already know,” Tony said with a snort. “No, I need to go. I – well, no matter what, I got people waiting on the other side.”
I can't tell if you're being sarcastic or you're genuinely asking.
Tony sighs and lets himself smile. "If it doesn't, well. It'll be one of the better lies we've ever told ourselves, Fry."
"Tony," and Bruce's voice in impossibly soft, long years of practice being the bearer of bad news. "I only looked into other options because Don's already at risk. BARF has worked great, and Donnie's success rate is in the high eighties by my most recent calculations, but it might never be permanent. He'd need to keep exposing himself to it for the rest of his life and the switching, Tony, I've already showed you. It's not good for him. This," he brings up another scan. "This was one of Donnie's bad days. He switched over five out of eight times. This is the last time. Look at that drop, Tones."
"Food for the invalid prisoner," she drawls. Her odd, green-tinted hair is limp where it has fanned out against the bed. It is the only source of the color in the room, the delineation between her and her white sheets and pillows. "Is this Captain America's version of a bargain?"
Steve hands it over, watches Sam take in the same picture he had, sent from Natasha's phone. It's a snap of one of his drawings on the Accords, his own head in cartoon form, giant wings sprouting out of the side of his head. Beside it, written in Tony's blocky engineer's print, is the sentence:
Bruce starts laughing, this soft miserable sound. "You're such a
"You know?" Pepper said, a bit too brightly. "I think I want some popcorn. I'm gonna go get some. Steve, do you mind keeping Tony company?" She was already standing and gathering her things. "He just dies without the chance to explain all the scientific inaccuracies in movies."
You - you sided with Ross! You know what he did to me and you worked at his side, you hunted our friends down like animals!" Bruce is vibrating with anger and Tony very determinedly does not move to put space between them.
"Perhaps I can help with that," a voice says, and Steve is whipping around and grabbing the table to flip it up in defense before he can register who is talking to him. It is a man, smooth- and dark-skinned like the other Wakandans, completely regular except for the slight flatness in his accent and the way his face is not quite shaped like the typical Wakandan.
"Tony," Bruce says. "You are talking about turning James Barnes into a lab experiment. Don't you think he's been through enough?"
Yeah, okay. Maybe the universe got him good on this one. Maybe he lost this fight.
He moves to mirror her, placing one elbow on his knee and tipping his head into that hand. "Tell me more about myself, Nat."
She sends him more, over the next few days, the embellishments to his drawings and words. Some are funny, like when Clint warped his drawing of a panther in motion to the Hulk riding a kitten. Some make him angry, like the few times someone will just write 'NO.' under one of his suggestions. Some make him sad, like the drawing he made of Tony back when they first met that Tony has viciously scribbled out the arc reactor from, leaving the smirking, bright-eyed man in the drawing with a dark hole in his chest.
T'Challa holds his stare for a long moment, searching for something Tony is pretty sure he can't give him. Then he reaches into his coat and tugs the Accords out of his belt. Even from here in the dim light of the street lamps Tony can make out Steve's distinctive writing and art style. Tony's always liked Steve's art; he is overly precise in his details and has no head for drawing faces but his crisp clean lines have always been perfect for sketching out Iron Man. He used to have five or six doodles in his workshop alone. He still has the first postcard Steve sent him from his cross-country tour after the Chitauri from Seattle, a ink-pen Iron Man flying around the Space Needle.
"How do you know it was you?" Steve asked, frowning. Stark gave a one-shouldered shrug and a corner of his mouth tilted up in a bitter smile.
Bucky laughs again, hoarse and unhappy. "I was holed up in hotel rooms and every once in awhile I'd look around and nothing would look right. Because my brain had fallen back to 1944, or 1959, or '85 or '97 or some fucking year that wasn't now. And maybe I'd get lucky that day, and I would wonder where Stevie and the Commandos were, what kinda bender I'd gone on last night that they'd left me to sleep off. Those are they days I wrote about, the ones you - found." There's a small surge of guilt at that, even though there's no accusation in Bucky's voice and it had to be done to find out where his headspace was at the time. "Most days I wasn't though. I'd slip back to the Winter Soldier, ready for a hit, waiting for my handler to come with my gear so I could suit up."
The lawyers are pretty sure Clint's only real hope is signing the Accords. Natasha stays by his side and lays out the individual contracts of herself, Rhodey, Vision, Spider-Man, Black Panther, and the Defenders in front of him. Tony calls Laura Barton.
Tony frowns at her, not liking the way she's eyeing him as if waiting for him to flip out. "No need to build suspense, Killer Queen, if you've got a source I'm happy to hear about it."
So he builds, one line of code at a time.
Thank you all so much for the comments and discussion. I love you all dearly. This chapter ate my soul. That's it, I'm soulless now, you poor bastards.
I have seen Colonel Rhodes wait for you when you don't come home, I have watched Agent Romanov hover at your shoulder, I have seen all the words Spider-man bites back, I have seen Vision outside this very lab, trying to find out how to just
"Kitty," he gets out in something that supposed to be teasing but simply comes out exhausting. The paramedic's eyebrows climb obscenely high but T'Challa appears unfazed and the other man wisely backs out of the conversation. "I didn't expect to see you here."
She swallows, face growing serious. "Gone."
"You are. You're just pretending you aren't." Then he took the MIT letter and pinned it to their corkboard hanging over the desk they shared. "A reminder," he said again, tapping it with one finger, and then he headed to dinner. At the door he stopped, and Tony could feel his stare on his back. "Think about it, Stark. Then get back to me. I have a feeling you and me could be having a lot more fun."
, indeed.
“Two hours, sir,” JARVIS answers, and Tony thinks of the two hours he’s just spent in his bed, waking up from nightmare after nightmare, waking up and drifting off until they all became one big long terror.
thanks cap.
Steve wondered if that Steve hated this Tony, too.
They take the measure of each other, and Tony can't help but wonder what's on the other side of Barnes' scale, and if he's coming out even against it.
(There was a note on Richards file that from Fury that just read "Damn idiot. No, do not mark him 'deceased.' Sue's too smart to let them all die.")
"Any video recording?"
." T'Challa looks at him sadly and Tony realizes that he doesn't have to imagine, he can remember. "Sorry. I know I'm not helping my case."
"If Nat and I didn't sign the Accords we'd be right next to you in the Raft," Tony says bluntly, ignoring Clint's flinch. "The Accords were always going to happen whether we liked it or not. The people are scared of us, Barton." Clint opens his mouth and Tony slams a hand down flat on the table. "One hundred and thirty eight countries, now, Barton, who didn't feel safe with us running around unchecked across their borders. And you think your opinion is somehow more important than theirs?"
Peter nods so hard Tony fears for his neck. "You got it, Tony. You won't regret this, I swear, I'll kick ass. Metaphorical ass, of course, since I'll be
"You think he's trying to control Tony?" Steve is not too delicate to snort. "Tony usually only lets himself be manipulated because he thinks its funny when people try." He knows this, because the first time he ever heard Tony really laugh is when the man explained how he and Fury basically tricked each other into getting Tony on the team. It had not been a nice laugh, but that was how most of his firsts with Tony had gone. "Then again..."
"Why?" Barnes asks again, looking a bit stricken. Tony fights to calm down, to reign it in. He thinks of Howard, and the boardroom, and how his father would rip him apart in seconds if he lost control like this. He
I am INCREDIBLY iffy on this chapter and I'm going to be honest, I might go back and edit it because I'm not really happy with parts of it. The thing with Clint is essentially wrapping up his storyline and addressing what would be some real life concerns with the Avengers in that they have now sort of set themselves up as a superhero haven and Tony is hypervigilant about the team functioning as a team.
." She grabbed a fistful of StarkTurf in her hand and with one green burst of light, incinerated it. "I hate it."
The reactor goes out. Tony drops his hands. Everything is red and dark and cold and Steve is so tired. He waits for Tony to speak, because this is his half-dropped cue, the one that Tony always picks up. But Tony stares up at him, so indescribably hurt.
with just a smile and everyone obeyed, and it never seemed to be enough. Tony always had to do more, make more, be more.
Rhodey grimaces. "Prom. Eighteen years old, trying to make it with Indries Moomji. That was a mistake."
"You know. Flashy and - and impossible," Steve ducked his head, feeling the anger stir back up. "He's frustrating as hell."
"You mind?"
Tony barely gets out a hello when Steve hefts something up onto the lab table and almost reverently puts it down, stepping back and looking at Tony expectantly. It’s one of his old suitcase armors, the only armor left now. It must have gotten lost in Steve’s stuff ages ago, and it’s caked with dust and grease.
Madame Hydra carefully peels back the lid on her jello and scoops out one tiny glob - green. The folks in the kitchen have a sense of humor. "Captain," she says after she swallows it down, placing the spoon down. "I know you did not come here unprepared. I know you have already seen Nicholas Fury's interrogation. What precisely is it that you want?"
"I said - and very badly, mind you - that I wanted to keep you safe."
"I only stood by and watched," Stark said sadly. "You know I was working on a suit? Made it out of metal, like a Knight of the Round Table. It can stop a bullet or two. It could've stopped yours. All those days I was mopin' and drinkin', I could have been building. It would have been done before Fisk ever came for us, if I had just done better. Don't you understand, Sheriff?"
"Steve," she says, deadly soft. "It's okay. I'll be fine. I learned from the best, didn't I?"
Peter looks down at Greenie, still screaming, and lets out a frustrated shout before pulling him back over the edge. Tony cuts the webbing loose just as a loud clank sounds behind him. "You're late, sour patch."
"I wouldn't dare," Tony says with a mocking gasp. "You could've just beeped me, Natasha, this is the 21st century."
, without all the information, you are putting them in danger."
Lukin smiles, all teeth. "Oh, yes. In this life there are many paths, but finding the right one is hard. Keeping to it, even harder. The Accords are of course one more step along that path, but only if the leadership is strong. But you could not sit idly by while the world spun out of control, could you, Mr. Stark? You are not that kind of man." It's all the right words but they still sound wrong; Tony can feel his spine straightening subconsciously, chin tilting up, thankful for his customary shades. "You've taken action both on and off the battlefield. It's to be admired, not persecuted."
Ty leaned back, looking Tony in the eye and smiling at what he found there. "You see?  The rest of us have love hardwired into our DNA, chained to a bunch of letters, but not you. You could do anything. You're completely free, Tony Stark. Quite frankly, I'm jealous."
There’s something growing here, in Natasha’s miniscule smiles and the easy line of Clint’s shoulders and Thor’s embraces, just a smidgen hesitant; in Bruce’s shy offers of dinner. There’s something in the way Tony looks at him over the glow of his holographic work stations, something in the easy way that Tony fights at his back.
Tony looks up at T'Challa, grinning a bit madly. "You are full of surprises today, Def Leppard. If you got any more, I'd like a warning. My heart can only take so much."
Clint's face shutters closed for a moment before one of his kids hugs him tight. He looks up at his wife, then Natasha, then Kamala, with a kind of helpless look on his face. "I came back."
" Steve said, nearly shouting by the end of it. Tony reared back a little, looking confused. "And everything else, as well - you're talking about taking the fight to the villains, but that's not what we do, Tony. That's not our job, we're here to protect people."
. The name stuck, otherwise. And if Steve had ever gotten to see the movie, Tony hadn't known. He was well ensconced in his delusion of retirement by then.)
"I-" Vision comes in over the communicator. He was the only one they could safely send into the fog. Rhodey and Tony linger on the outskirts while Natasha coordinates with Coulson (and isn't that going to be an interesting conversation Tony will never get to see?) "I have casualties."
Steve sighs. "No one's putting you in a cell, Rachel."
"Tony?" he's asking before he even gets the phone all the way up to his ear.
Can you promise me you'll be there the entire time? Wanda too.
"Pep, Pep, Pepper, honey," he tries, and her eyes well up and he pulls her into a hug. "You are the best woman I've ever known. And I knew Peggy Carter. I knew my mom."
"Yeah," Tony says.
“Special,” Steve echoed, his gaze drifting down to his wrist, touching the words now with a reverence he reserved for their family bible. “Me and Buck. Forever.”
"Please call me Aamir," he begins softly, clutching at his cup. "I cannot describe how grateful I am for all that you have done, but I have some questions."
Howard breathes in his ear from thirty five years ago, Baby's First Board Meeting, no one's your friend Tony, it all will be yours Tony, so tear them apart, Tony, before they can get you.
, getting it flight-ready again. The one-eyed man wants us to go to the Conservatory soon and see if anything's left."
In anyone else Tony would say that ran very close to emotional manipulation but this was Pepper - and while she wasn't above emotional manipulation, this was their friendship on the line. And also, she was telling the truth.
transparent, so instead he just sends some files to the agent and tells her she would know when to pass them on.
T'Challa just grins. "Explosive. Mr. Lang, I have a delivery for you. Along with something I think you all should see." He extends the package in Scott's direction, who scurries to take it, while he throws another sheaf of paper on the table in front of Sam. "That is my copy of the Accords. I was waiting for one of you to ask or show interest, and of course you always have the choice not to read it, but it has...occurred to me how hard is it to make a choice when you don't know what the choice may be.
Bad days happen, kid. It's part of the job. I know its sound hokey, but you pick up and you keep going.
It was Clint's decision too. He'll be fine. We've already got lawyers on standby.
She's smart; it only takes her a second to put it together, and sure enough, there is The Smug radiating off of her, but it's sweetened by an undeniable air of relief and affection. "One that can perhaps be downloaded to a smartphone," she surmises.
He can't, really, but he doesn't want to disappoint T'Challa, or lie to him, so Tony shrugs and lets himself be led to a small room with one large window taking up a wall. There is a figure just beyond the window, vague and unsymmetrical, but Tony doesn't look too hard, not yet. He keeps his eyes on T'Challa from the moment he's directed to a seat to the moment the king says "I'll be right outside," and shuts the door behind him.
It isn't as if Tony is new to hope, Tony runs on hope; he's never been a miserable person, or at least, if he is, he would like to think he confines those feelings to himself. The world, on the whole, is glorious, the future even more so, and both are filled to the brim with people who deserve a better chance than what they're getting. It isn't idealism, he doesn't think so, it's the things he's seen. For every Raza, there is a Yinsen; for every Stane, a Pepper; for every Ross, a Bruce. And Tony knows they're worth fighting for, dying for. For every soldier of Hydra out there trying to destroy the world, there's a Kamala, a Peter, a Donnie who deserves better. Tony has always wanted to give that to them.
"He could be keeping valuable information," she suggests, baldly sly.
She looks up at him, her face lit up from the screen, and then she slides her phone back into her pocket.
Tony had his own answer to that - for one, the armor could kick Thor's ass any day of the week, thank you very much. For another, the armor was multi-purpose and could tackle a larger amount of problems than Thor could. He wonders what Steve's thoughts had been, though. It had been Steve's plan, at that base. A perfect plan, actually, disregarding the Maximoffs. It had been - it was a good fight, that day.
scrolls across the screen.
Bruce's mouth tightens and he reaches forward to take the glass from Tony, swallowing the remaining scotch in one swallow before setting it aside and sitting down beside him. They sit in silence for a very long time and Tony just stares at nothing, trying very hard not to think. His chest hurts; Tony allows himself one dramatic moment to consider his heart might be breaking before letting it pass with nothing more than a sardonic twist of lips.
"Really? Well, the man was certifiable," Tony remarks, coming over to inspect it. Rhodey's not wrong; the trigger is there but nothing's connecting it to the wires that would set off the bomb. "Let's not tell Spidey about this, okay?"
Donnie tilts his head back towards the wall. "Then what is it?"
Steve stared at that smile, at those bright brown eyes, at a Tony who cared.
Steve watched, narrow-eyed, as Hologram-Tony was overtaken by the dots. "What are those?" he asked quietly, pointing towards holes marked on Holo-Tony's frame.
"Did you read my file?" When he shakes his head she frowns. "Did you read any of our files? Madame Hydra captured me and my partners. She tortured us for months then she shot my two best friends up with that Terrigenesis crap. Neither of them lived. I was supposed to be next but something spooked her. She got sloppy and I escaped."
Fury shrugs. "Go ahead. You owe him one anyway. His Highness has worked pretty damn hard for these Accords." He raises one eyebrow. "I've read the reports, Tony. I want to hear what happened from you."
, and Tony gave that derisive snort again. “I should have taken him to you five minutes ago; he gets antsy when people break protocol.”
"So, I ask Wanda and she say 'Steve's gone off to save the day' and I think to myself 'fucking
Tony couldn't let his parents know about this, couldn't let anyone know how much of a fuck-up he really was. It was bad enough that Ty knew. He whirled back around, intent on grabbing up his paper, but Tiberius was in the way, watching him with a calculating gleam in his eye.
Tony runs his hands along the shield, gathering dust in his lab. Who was that man that his father seemed so proud of? Did he die in the ice? Or was it earlier, did he fall off the train with Bucky Barnes and leave behind a man that drove his shield into Tony's chest every night?
"What, do you put him back in the deep freeze every time?" Tony asks, a bit confused.
and feels bile at the back of his throat. Tony must be in agony right now.
"Like I said," he repeats, raising an eyebrow at her defensive tone, and she falls back a little. He scrolls through the texts one more time and hands it over. "So we're getting missions from Fury.
But Barnes' eyes are still soft, and Tony can't help but focus on them. Because those are not the eyes of a murderer. "I'm your chance," Barnes says quietly, and Tony doesn't respond. "I need to-" Barnes begins, and then his mouth opens and closes around the likely thousands of things he needs.
"See. Just like I said," he says, lighter than he feels. It's not really Steve, he knows that, but he'll take it. "It'll take a while to get used to. I'll stick around, okay. Just in case, you know." And he does, just like that, matching his breathing to the subtle whir of the arc reactor.
"I'm surprised to see you back at work, Agent Carter," Natasha says abruptly. "I thought Deputy Director Ross would have your head for stealing Rogers' and Wilson's gear."
The Avengers are
"You recruiting us now, Cap?" Cloak says, one eyebrow raised.
"Then why did you agree to it?" Hope asks, a bit of horror tinging her genuine curiosity.
like that song but he clapped a hand over his mouth nonetheless. "Sorry," he muttered. "But we're under attack right now and I've had my fill of aliens tonight."
Natasha, the coolest and most collected super spy ever, practically vibrates with tension at his side.
"There's nothing to forgive, sweetheart."
When he dropped the shield in front of Tony, he didn't feel loss.
"Come to escort me to my cell?"
The blood seemed to freeze in Steve's veins as Tony's words sunk in.
"Yeah, the Machine's catching it," Rhodey finally answers. "Delayed response time of about .5 seconds in the back left hip joint, you seeing it?"
Tony hasn't heard one word out of his kid that didn't involve a string of numbers.
The message said he trusted me. To know.
"Ashes?" Tony echoes. Everett nods, watching Tony's reaction.
He felt relief.
BANNER:
BANNER:
"No," Donnie replies honestly. "Pretty not okay. But anything's better than before."
"What happens if he doesn't have you?"
"Tony, I need better traction on the suit!" Peter garbles out when he comes back up for air.
"I'm not saying you shouldn't try, Wanda. I'm saying that you can't let these things destroy you. Thinking about it won't change what happened to you, it won't bring your brother back. All it will make you do is doubt yourself and in the situations we get into, we can't afford that."
When was the last time he had looked back at her, the one person his eyes should always be fixed upon? Not since the War, not since
Rhodey adjusts his legs by hand, probably just to have something to do with them. "And as I was saying to Captain Danvers, my place is with the Avengers now." His voice sounds firm but Tony can't miss the spark of longing in his eyes. Rhodey's a military man through and through, always happy to serve, happy with his men and his rank and the lifestyle. And Tony took it all away from him.
Aleksander Lukin is from the comics. Do not look up who he is unless you want to be spoiled.
That voice sounded almost familiar to Steve. If it was higher, maybe, less husky-
Tony writes
Steve glared mulishly at the rough cotton of Bucky's jacket, ducking away from Bucky's hand. "I couldn't let him get away with it, Buck! You shoulda heard the way he talked about Arnie. Just because his mark hasn't filled all in yet - well everyone knows some people are late bloomers."
“I didn’t feel right without it,” Steve says, and though the subject is the same the change in tone still seems abrupt. “Like part of me was missing, too. I - thank you for saving it, Tony, really.”
He sounds like Steve's ma when Steve was being his most stubborn. He feels a muscle in his jaw tick. "I never wanted any of this to happen. I never wanted to fight, I never wanted anyone to get hurt. It sounds so stupid to say it out loud, of course no one wanted that-"
They have not gotten everyone to the roof; Tony sees a few waving out of the broken windows all along the building. He knows Vision and Wasp are still a few miles out but they direly need more fliers. He sets his two civilians on the ground, about the head back up when a tall, older blonde man in a police uniform calls his name.
"Nope."
"Did he tell you about - about upgrading himself?" Steve asked, anxious. "He wasn't - he wasn't serious. I told him he couldn't be serious."
.' But that would be uncharitable and mean and
"He dreams, sometimes. Loud, so loud." Here Wanda winces, retracting her hand as she glances sidelong at Steve. "I - I try to help. It's dark in his head, I just shine a little light-"
It is not T'Challa who greets him at the international (
T'Challa's hand tightens. "You have done everything you can for him, Tony. The rest is up to him."
Donald shuffles over, looking at Tony from underneath furrowed brows. "Call me Blizzard."
Tony swallows hard at the dark writing, gouged into the page, knowing there is something there he cannot fix.
when it all disappeared and he was left alone. But for just a moment, he had been happier than he had been in
"I am. We've got business to discuss. And...I need to talk to him about his father," Tony admits. "If he knew anything about what was happening, or how the Green Goblin came cackling into existence."

"Don't be. All I want is for you to help me get even. And you know-" She turns to him, taps him on the cheek with her still bloody fingertips. "Maybe to smile, at least once. I bet you have a nice smile. Guys like you always do."
“I don’t want-“
Things are very quiet for a long moment, neither looking away, then Barnes nods. "Yeah, that's what I thought."
Tony looked down again. “I don’t think he thinks that’s worth much.”
"Can't say the same for you," she replies, all dulled sharpness. "You look like shit, Stark."
“I assure you it is,” Brian said, insufferably sure. “I believe you Yanks have borrowed a phrase from the Japanese, what is it…oh yes. ‘Notice me, senpai.’ Though Heaven help Tony once Steve finally does.” Natasha felt her mouth fall open as several things fell into place. Brian took no notice, gathering up his jetpack and facemask to head to class. “Ah, well. Until that time, I’ll be happy to join Stark for body shots at the club. Care to join?”
"Colonel Rhodes. Good to see you back on your feet. I'm surprised the military isn't all over your ass to come home."
"Yeah, he's, uh..." Rhodes looked over his shoulder. "Well, busy. And kinda steamed at you. I got an earful. Give him some time to cool off, Cap."
Rhodey groans. "Viz, you are killing me. Ready to pack it in, Tones?"
"Don't push it." Tony lets his arms be draped over Rhodey's shoulder and they shuffle step-by-step to Tony's room. "Tony," Rhodey says, and he hums in acknowledgement. "Your brain is a dick, and your dad was an even bigger one. Don't let them get to you, alright? We need you in top shape. All of us."
"I would have been honored by that," Steve said honestly. The stare that got was incredulous and Tony made a noise that blurred the line between sob and chuckle.
"I was in a war," Steve said coldly, and on the ground, Sam started to rise. This was getting into dangerous territory. "We were desperate. It isn't the same at all."
NATASHA:
T'Challa's too busy to lend a hand, so all four of them pack into a quinjet and head overseas. Natasha debriefs them once again and then as one they turn to Tony. "What?" he asks, and Vision inclines his head with an unspoken question.
"The Soldier's serum. Not likely. We
"Oh? You done with keeping secrets, super-spy?"
"You have always been a 'sucker' for the younger set. Observe Harley Keener."
Four years ago Tony would have bugged his computer and broken into their systems. But that was before the Accords and before he had a team. Now Tony merely nods, buttons his jacket, and stands. "Thanks for the clarification, Deputy Director."
He let his gaze slide to Pepper and smiled. "Just Steve is fine." Pepper obligingly greeted him again, first name only this time, but Steve had already turned back to Tony, shifting from one foot to another before he caught himself.
Are you alright? Is Vision?
What concerns him most is this supposed 'daughter.' "They still have her," Tony says when the recording's finished. "That's...a problem."
Tony knows Clint is looking at him but he lets Vision take the lead again. "As I said, Agent Barton, the orders were for Sergeant Barnes, who with the help of Steve Rogers and the Falcon had just destroyed a substantial portion of a Berlin pass."
Tony shouts. It rings loud throughout the house and Tony can't bear to let the echoes settle. He grabs for his phone, flips to a photo and shows it to Bruce. "Charlie Spencer, Sokovia, young kid, bright future and
Tony takes a deep breath. "I didn't."
Steve thought unkindly, and then immediately banished the thought. It didn't matter that he was angry. This man - this Tony - needed his help.
"Yes."
"Reverse engineering," the other man says under his breath. "Of course, why didn't we-"
Right. The veritable stockpile of data sitting pretty in FRIDAY's servers right now, ready first for the council to see and then for Tiberius' spin to show the whole world just how helpless James Barnes really was. "I kinda wanted the guy's permission before I make him the greatest underdog story ever told and dump his trauma on national television - my own experience with that was a
. The meeting seemed to be over. Many of the students drifted off, whether to get to class, go on patrol, or take a nap at the dorms. The conversation went back to other, more pleasant topics.
"They don't have anywhere else to go."
"I didn't agree to that," Donnie says loudly, adjusting the little nodes that will create his shockingly Matt Damon-ish digital mask. Kamala and Hope look a little appalled at Tony's joke.
"Captain," Sam prompts. "Orders?" He has stepped farther away than any of them, holding himself back or holding himself close or both, Steve doesn't know anymore.
"Eh." Tony scratches at the back of his head, abashed. FRIDAY has not been pleased to be taken offline and rebooted three days in a row. Tony had taken a very cold shower and drank some disgustingly tepid coffee today. "She's a bit mad at me for said tinkering so, yeah. Tandem hacking, today. I'm letting Vision handle it instead. It'll be good practice for them both."
, a voice that sounds suspiciously like Tony's snarks in his head. He could always turn himself in, fight for his freedom, but he's not-
Shuri clearly thinks the same. "Here in Wakanda or back in your United States, he will have still 'been through a lot.' There is no hope for him here, only our risk. I do not...begrudge my brother his need to fix his misjudging, but the mistake was not mine, or Wakanda's. I carry this for him still because he is my king and cannot be second guessed but as a sister...I worry. Without end. To ask of an outsider that you relieve us of our burden is a thorn in the side of my pride, but I will take that pain gladly if you would do so. Barnes does not belong here, Dr. Stark. Take him away."
"Oh, that," she says, waving her hand like her handler recommending her termination and ultimately rejecting it for how it would affect Cloak means nothing. "Don't mind that. I mean, don't kill me, because he will warp you into space, but he can survive without me. As I can without him."
"I almost killed Barnes, did you know
"Check if any big names are interested, then forward that list to Pepper. I don't want to threaten Junior, just talk to him," Tony growls. "I promised Peter some answers; lets get them. Sidebar here: did they do a physical evaluation on Osborn in prison? Draw any blood?"
"How many?" Tony calls.
"We know how much you care about him, Captain-" Steve whirls. The man has somehow gotten behind him, facing Bucky's cage, one hand ghosting over the glass. "The whole world has seen what you are willing to do to keep him by your side."
That makes her snort indelicately just before her face goes carefully blank and she holds the phone out to him. "Steve knew about the bomb before even we did. They've got a top-ranking HYDRA agent in their custody right now. His team - Fury's team - might have information that we can use. If we pool our resources-"
"I got to tell you, the other guy is not happy about three AM wake-up calls, what's-" The scientist finally looks up at the tableau in front of him: Rhodey, still standing with his hand outstretched towards Tony, T'Challa observing with a strained expression, and Tony in the middle of them. "Jesus, Tony, you're - sit down before you keel over."
"Please, Stark, I help run a company that runs on experimental tech. I know the benefits of a good spin, and that was a bonafide Tilt-A-Whirl. Clever not to mention that the Accords were initially presented as a 'do or die' mandate."
"Thank you," Tony says by rote, as he taps a log of what she's told him into his own private database. "It's not looking any better on my end. There's no tampering of the video outside Osborn's cell near the time of his death, but we did find a blackout several hours ahead of time. There's no toxicology report from his time in the hospital or after his transfer and the prison had his body cremated."
"Will you...come after us?"
Gamora snorted derisively. "Please. Iron Man alone won't stop the Chitauri and Ronan will pound you into pretty red-and-gold smears before your first attack. We need to come up with a plan for Ronan's next attack."
Is this SI business or Avengers business?
What why?
Almost.
Steve read them. They could work on them together, in some small way, just like Tony had wanted before. Of course his suggestions are brilliant, he's Steve. Not much for politics, but Steve was the one who knew the Avengers, Steve was the one with the moral compass to point Tony in the right direction when he got lost. Now that's all gone, but Steve is trying, at least a little, to repair the damage he's done.
"People are assholes," Scott bites out.
Thank you so much for the amazing response! Now who's ready for me to seriously fuck with some Marvel origins?
Tony said id feel bad about it. he was right. i shoulda been better.
"Don't be, Pete, that was - I'm a bit of a mess."
He thinks Steve sees it all in his face anyway, because his eyes go a little soft and more than a little pained. “Yeah,” he says. “Sometimes.” And Steve’s seen friends slip between his fingers, too. Steve’s seen death, too.
How he fit with Steve. Captain America. Tony snorted derisively at himself. God, he had idolized Steve growing up, the young and glorious fallen hero, the boy wonder who had built his own legend. He could never live up to that, he had thought to himself when he was younger, and it was okay then, because he never would need to.
Blizzard's in the HYDRA chamber, terrified and pleading as Zemo laughs in the background. Tony is trying, trying to get to him but he keeps getting distracted by Bucky Barnes.
“I never asked for his help!” Steve almost shouted.
Tony's jaw clenches tight. The panthers aren't what scares him about Wakanda and they both know it. "Thanks for the offer, Your Highness, but I think I'll pass."
Another long pause and Representative Rochambeau sighs. "The council will back you up, Mr. Stark. Now we will see if New York City will do the same."
"Am I being tested? I feel very tested right now-"
Goblin Face screams impotently. "All I wanted was Anderson. You've ruined everything!"
Clint clears his throat. "Oh, excuse me. Instinct, adrenaline, and
Tony is dreaming. For the first time in a long time, it isn't about his parents, or Siberia. He's in his Malibu house, and it is whole. He is laying on the couch, the sound of waves crashing at his back, the arc reactor heavy in his chest, and he can't move.
"He comes near me again he'll be the least of your worries," Luke snorts.
The council looks between themselves and the American delegate finally leans forward. "I do not see why this is a question at all. James Barnes has always deserved a trial; what you are arguing for is a basic human right, Mr. Stark, and it is baffling to me we are debating this. I will see this to the ICJ, Mr. Stark, you have my word. Will Sergeant Barnes be there to defend himself?"
"Don't." Not his kill, not his lie, not his fault. "This - isn't about that. I came here to tell you what's going to happen - because it is going to happen."
“So, I hear thanks are in order for saving my life, by the way…”
"I went to Siberia to help Steve," Tony says dully. He doesn't want to tell this story, so he doesn't. Bruce is smart, let him put together the pieces. "That's where Ross got the video from."
Natasha snorts. "Good thing this isn't about you, or him, right? This is a threat to the world and we need the best minds working on. We need better than 'as near as I can tell,' Tony. And Rhodes told me you went to Tiberius Stone when you know Pepper would have dropped everything in a heartbeat to help you ream him out. And this mysterious favor you're going to call in, I bet you're going to do that all by yourself as well."
, hellcat."
Steve shot a grin at his mother. “It will be, just you wait. You and me, Buck.”
Clint nods, eyes glued on his kids like he still can't believe they're with him. "Yeah. Apparently the suit's got some kind of stingers, may be even stronger than Tasha's bites. I think she's jealous."
"Just a bit," T'Challa echoes, sounding a bit amused.
“You know why I told you that?” he will say out of nowhere, and I will hum noncommittally. “Because I was hoping you would say exactly what you did.”
“Is that your shield?” a little boy asked him, staring at his back with wide eyes that then moved to Steve’s face and, if possible, lit up even more.
Steve throws a grateful smile over his shoulder and then glances sidelong at Wanda. "I need time, Steve," she tells him. "Please give that to me."
The man smiles at Tony. "For infinity."
“For what?”
Tony and Natasha both flinch, hard, and a miserable look of glee flits across Clint's face. No, none of this, Tony decides. Natasha Romanov was brave enough to hold his hand in the hallway not ten minutes ago and Clint Barton is not going to ruin that. "You wanna read the report that Commander Garneau's going to write up, Barton? I can already tell you that he'll commend Agent Romanov for saving more lives than a whole squadron of his soldiers." Natasha looks at him, surprised, and Tony shrugs. "He really hated admitting that to me, by the way.
"Thanks, Spidey," Kamala says cheerfully, taking a cup and instead of taking a sip, plonking it down in front of Tony. "Bottoms up, Mr. Stark, you look like you could use it. Well, not actually bottom's up. Don't do that. That would be super painful."
He used to think what a shame it was that Tony lived so far in the future. He still does, if he's being honest, because in his impossible effort to bring the future to him, Tony has systematically ripped away every piece of solid ground underneath him that isn't named James Rhodes. But Steve can no more bend the past to his will then Tony can the future, and he wonders, a little miserably, if the reasons they never quite got along is because the whole time Tony was thinking similar thoughts about him.
Bruce is up and out of his chair before Tony can blink. "Don't. Just don't. Don't try to pull any of your shit on me, Tony, because I am
Hope settles in well enough, though she doesn't hide her irritation that even Tony can beat her on the mat as well as she thinks she does. She's terrifyingly smart and can talk Donnie and Tony both into the ground when it comes to biology, though she has a little more trouble with Bruce. Hope is competitive but she's making a conscious effort to make it productive, something to motivate the rest of them. Clint tells her a few stories about Scott and she hangs on every word.
“I wanted.” Steve takes a shuddering breath that shivers down Tony’s own spine. “
Hopefully my writing actually managed to convey this and if it didn't, shame on me, but AvAc Steve in the game is basically a Jock character who has a heart of pure gold. He's like the sports kids you knew in high school who wanted you to have FUN with them in gym and when they clapped hands with the opposing team at the end of play and said "great game"
"So a normal life is only for everybody else, huh?"
"Until he gets better," Tony says and another flash, a red and gold fist flying at terrified blue eyes.
He can't stop every bad thing from getting to them, and he needs to stop trying. But giving them a solid future, one they're prepared for and not thrown into, sink or swim, 'we're a time-bomb' - he can do that.
"I heard about your shouting match with him. I didn't believe it - Fury doesn't shout. Is he actually playing you or did he just keep something
"When will you call Tony?" he asks when he realizes how long the silence has stretched on.
The horrible truth is that this isn't what he wants. He doesn't want Barnes pardoned and he doesn't want him to get a normal life. He sat down and read through the reports, the precision and clinical coldness of decades of HYDRA scientists and handlers as they documented how best to break this man and bend him to their will. He was a puppet, a living weapon, and he
“Steven!” Sarah cried, and gripped him even tighter, much to her son’s dismay. She could feel it now, the steady heartbeat, the skin no longer burning up from within. “Don’t you ever do that to me again!” she couldn’t help but scold, pushing Steve back so she could get a good look at his face. His cheeks were still a little pink, and his fever was more banked than broken, but there was a glow to him she had never seen before.
Okay.
"I didn't mean like that. He's really cool, Mr. Stark." She looks around the lab, eyes still wide but with a new gleam in her eye. "So you built them?"
"Simple," she finally says, looking up at him. "It wasn't your serum, Captain. Nor that that belonged to our glorious leader. It was one created by cast-offs, scraps. Inferior."
He suspected Tony had asked for it himself, but he could never quite bear to broach the topic with Jarvis, let alone Tony. Hell, he hadn't had a conversation with Tony in years. He'd never much liked kids, but he especially wasn't fond of those that stared at him with eyes just a bit too sharp, just a bit too judgmental for someone that couldn't manage what 99% of the population had. Maria still tried, somehow. She was always stronger than he had been. But it was breaking her heart, a little more everyday, to stare at the little person she had helped make and know that there was nothing inside him.
He peels his hand away from Don's and they sit there in the quiet for a very long time while Tony puzzles out how to say what he needs to.
"Why?"
"Barton collective," he says, moving on with the next set of keys. The Bartons look up at him, one of Clint's hands holding Cooper's shoulder while the other grips Nate close to his chest. For the first time in a long time, Tony feels a flash of pity for the man. It must be killing him to let his family out of sight like this, but he's doing it anyway; anything to see his kids happy. "I'm assuming we all know the field trip procedures."
Kamala perks up. "Thank you, Mr. Stark." At Tony's jerky nod she bounces a little so that she briefly stretches up to seven feet tall before coming back down. "It'll be fun, I promise. I'll ask and see who wants to go. Thank you, thank you!"
Tiberius had read up on all the literature when he'd found out what Tony was. He had tracked down a series of medical journals that had been quietly published bi-annually for the last thirty years, documenting aberrations in soulbonds. Most articles concerned second soulmates, but some were about people like him, the bare-wristed. There were less than thirty known confirmed cases, upwards of one hundred when historical conjecture was accounted for, and doctors had analyzed the characteristics and behaviors of these people to find out what had gone wrong.
"Stay close to Mr. Vision," Lila chirps.
"Four days. Busy man, got lots of stuff to do."
"Bad hypothesis," Tony said with a forced laugh.
"Wanda's been doing it up in braids," the other man says. "I look pretty good."
“My presence is not usually conducive to speedy recoveries.”
Tony is well acquainted with causing damage. So far the world has been gracious enough to let him at least try to repent for it. He won't let Steve fix what's broken inside of him, but he can't deny Steve the right to the same chances he was given himself.
. "You know what the Mayor said: no more alien heads in the street! It's disturbing the tourists!"
Madame Hydra laughs at that, silky black bob curtaining around her face as she tips forward a little. She holds up her hand to show a black device blinking in the palm of her hand. A detonator, one that's surely paired to the hulking black piece of machinery sitting in the middle of the room. "I'm sure. Rachel was always very excitable. But she's not the one I'm interested in."
He always has, through the death of his parents, Obie’s betrayal, his own many brushes with death and his lingering issues over the nightmares those produced. He looks in the mirror every day and tells himself that he has lived through so much worse than Steve before.
"I'm right here," he told the Tony in front of him, taking him by the shoulders and leading him to the bar. "A water," he told the robot on duty, and that blank-eyed head bobbed obediently before jumping to fill a glass.
Tony smothers a laugh into his hand, feeling properly chastised. "Yeah - okay, I hear you."
"I don't trust him with SHIELD and he chose this place to go back into stasis. He felt safe. Out there I can look for a cure for the triggers that I'm not going to find sitting in Wakanda. Until then, T'Challa will protect him."
But Peter shakes his head again. "He doesn't want to see me," he murmurs, and then, like he's ashamed, because he
Tony feels his heart rocket up to his throat before dropping down to his stomach. Taking Barnes away from Wakanda has never been the idea...but that's a lie, isn't it? A pretty one, so Tony can keep doing this. But really, taking Barnes back and getting him help, convincing him to go to the trial and clear his name, has always been his endgame. It almost sounds altruistic when he puts it like that and a bitter smirk pulls at his face.
Peter's blush can practically be seen through the mask and he turns to the cupboards, opening and closing the doors while retrieving a kettle, some cups, and a box of jasmine tea Wanda left behind. "Don't get his hopes up, sugar cookie. What are you doing?" Tony asks him, sitting up to watch.
"Calm down," he repeats, listening to his even breathing, his steady heartbeat, the quiet building in his head. "Calm down."
Tony didn't know what he was expecting.
sorry you have to go through this, but your face - it was like you already knew. Did you know the whole time that the Winter Soldier killed your parents? Is that...Is that why you fought against Steve, to bring James Barnes to justice?"
Just block them. It's what they're doing to me. Only, my filtering system is actually effective.
Steve was either an early riser or a light sleeper, because Tony only had to knock one more time before he was opening the door. “What is-“ the soldier began, unfairly alert, before he realized who it was. “Stark? Why are you in the suit? Why are you covered in mud?”
"Tony," Natasha says, soft and oh so careful. "I'm not blaming you."
Tony tears the door off and stares inside. There in the passenger seat sits Wanda Maximoff, bound tight in a straight-jacket while a power dampener gleams at her throat. Her eyes stare at nothing. Tony is too late.
Zemo patted her shoulder with a sympathetic hand and the Enchantress sighed.
my tech. Where do you think the armor comes from, or Sam's wings, or Natasha's Bites, or those robots that you're more than happy to use for target practice when it suits you? And you - you were just telling me how amazing this suit is. Well,
They didn't protect him before. You didn't see what the Raft was like. I'll turn myself in in exchange for Clint.
Behind them, Peter stops tussling with Donnie over who exactly gets to throw the ball to Dummy this time to protest this. "Hey! What about me?" Pointedly, he gestures the blue panels framing his torso and legs of his costume.
"You're—you," Tony stammers.
"If you want my help, you've got it," he offered right away.
Steve shook his head. "I'm fine. Still a safer driver than you." Steve grabbed his helmet and offered the spare to Tony.
"It did, but it came with far too high a price. It's ironic, more so than you could possibly imagine." Tony still wasn't facing Steve, that distant look on his face again, as if he were a million miles away. "See, I spent years of my life looking for something exactly like this. Some kind of magic that could fix my heart." He touched his chest, running his fingers lightly over the left side of it. Steve wasn't sure if it was for emphasis, or just a subconscious gesture.
"I know. It's special, though."
He drank some more.
Tony frowned at her. It sounded like she was expecting him to catch on, but he had no idea what she was getting at. "That there will be plenty more disappointed people in the world when they realize that finding your soulmate isn't a shortcut to bliss and harmony?" he suggested.
“Not so fast.” Steve moved his hand to Tony’s shoulder to pin him down. “I seem to remember a sprained ankle, too—I should take a look at that. Besides, don’t you want those ice packs?”
"Yes. Been wondering about that since he first put me on the case," Steve said between spoonfuls of gruel.
"I'll hold you to that," Tony said.
He tries to think of what he would say, and he doesn't even know where to start.
"And there we go. Just keep your mouth shut, will you?" Rumlow yanked Stark backwards by the shirt collar and shoved him against the nearest stone wall; the way his head collided with it made Bucky wince in sympathy.
"You should be," Tony said. "Probably knocked a couple of years right out of this body. Might start going gray prematurely. I'm not sure I'd call this frame inspection a pass."
Stark reached out for a cog in his assembly of parts, flicked aside a peg that had been holding it in place, and leaned back again. "Done."
Half a day with Stane, and he'd managed to convince Tony that the past ten years had just been a virtual simulation.
"Not all by myself," Tony replied modestly. "The design is mostly me, with plenty of input from Jarvis. The actual work involved several other people too."
Tony hadn't worked with amoromics software in years; after the early days, he'd gone back to engineering, leaving the bioinformatics to the top specialists he'd recruited. Still, a quick online search and scrolling through a few pages were enough to remind him of the basics. Checking a single pair of subjects for INCS was a non-standard task, but not a particularly difficult one. Being drunk and out of practice wouldn't stop Tony from doing it.
"If you're about to blame us for sitting on our asses for all that time, you can just keep your mouth shut," Fury interrupted him, raising his voice for the first time during the conversation. "You don't know the things we've been through, or how much it took for us to get where we are today."
The law was clear on this: if a match was found, both parties had to be told about it. It was for everyone's protection. Handing over your genome to a database meant you agreed to that. Tony could easily go outside the books, of course—he could probably get hold of Steve's DNA without his knowledge, run the sequencing and alignment just for the two of them if he wanted to, but that'd be both illegal and so deeply unethical he wasn't going to consider it. He could only run the test if Steve also wanted it. If Steve agreed to it, he'd have the right to know the result.
Steve leaned his head against the shower wall, his eyes closed, letting the spray trickle over his face, as if it could wash away the harrowing memories like it did the bloodstains. Even though the water was warm and the floor tiles below him heated, he still shivered.
"Should I be? Is there something unusual about it? More dangerous than most?" Tony asked, shifting to sit on the edge of his chair, leaning towards Steve.
He cried out and fell back into the pillows, barely hearing Lina's voice in the background as she called out for help. One of the nurses was back in the room soon after, soothing hand on his arm—his good arm—the only arm he had left—
The guard's alarm call had felt like it had lasted for a long time, but in reality, Steve had reacted right away, and it couldn't have been more than a few seconds. The guards elsewhere in the town might not have heard it, and in any case, they'd need time to figure out where it had come from.
"No. Just demonstrations and training exercises for CyberLife," Steve replies. Tony doesn't miss that for the briefest passing moment before he speaks, Steve's LED blinks yellow, again giving the impression that there's something about his past he's unwilling to talk about. Deep down, Tony's selfishly glad that Steve's got such an obvious tell; it's only fair when he's got those extra accurate senses helping him read the people around him.
Tony waited until they'd left behind the Vault and the guard posted outside its sturdy door before he speaking up again. Walking felt much more exhausting than it had any right to. When he was sure the guard wouldn't hear them, he stopped to rest against the nearest wall, breathing hard.
He wasn't going to meet Tony as Steve Rogers. He needed to close this case, and he needed to do it properly. He would go as Captain America. Whether he would tell Tony that those two were one and the same, he wasn't sure. In a way, he thought Tony deserved to know. Then again, in a selfish corner of his mind, he thought that if he didn't, maybe Steve could meet Tony again. If Tony found out about his deceit, he certainly wouldn't want anything further to do with Steve.
Steve pulled out his finger, and added a second, pushing in again, carefully, gently. Tony was relaxed enough that there wasn't much resistance. "Does this mean I pass this part of the inspection?" he asked.
He slept, and he stared at the cold stone walls. He ate when one of the nurses brought him food and accepted the few old, worn books they offered him, even though he had no interest in reading them.
Since Steve's vantage point on the hill has given him no obvious destination to aim for, he decides to head for another, even higher, hill that stands above all the others nearby. It's not too far away; he figures he can reach the top before it gets too dark. He takes off at a jog to stay warm.
The certainty with which Clint had announced he'd have no trouble killing Stane's frame and taking out his node in one shot had been disconcerting—Steve was glad the man was on their side, and couldn't help but wonder about his background. He wasn't going to complain, though. It made that part of the operation a lot simpler than what they'd initially prepared for, since it meant that only two people were required to implement the first step. That left a larger crew for the trickiest part: the kidnapping.
"We are," Pepper answered him. "I sold the idea to him."
"None of us came home unchanged, and I doubt there are many who have no regrets," Steve went on. "If that's what we're talking about, I've probably done just as many bad things as you have. But it's not just that, is it?"
Tony tossed back the rest of his drink in one go, grimacing. "Yeah. I was getting to it. It's kind of embarrassing. The thing is, I need your help."
"What is it?" Steve asked, still on his feet, clasping his hands together behind his back.
As much as he couldn't control what his subconscious got up to, he still felt vaguely guilty when he picked up the phone to call Pepper back and set up a meeting.
"Of course. Anything's possible, as long as we have nothing solid. Occam's Razor would suggest otherwise, though. It's been years since anyone last tried to off me, and now twice within two months? I'd say it's more likely there's just one culprit."
He changed out of his costume and into the same suit he'd worn when he'd last met Tony. When he combed his hair and checked it in the mirror, he told himself it was mainly to make sure it wouldn't look flattened after having been under his cowl all day. He wouldn't want that to give him away.
Steve takes a breath, pushes away the thought, unclenches his jaw, and continues his search.
He gets to the living room and has enough time to spot Obie, see the device he's holding and realize that something is not right here, before a high-pitched whine hits his ears and his entire body goes numb. He knows what this is; he was involved in the design. It's temporary and non-lethal—but he has a terrible sinking feeling in his gut saying that whatever else Obie's got in store for him might not be.
"I do," Tony said, "but I also think you know more than I do, and I'd really like some answers."
"No. Back then, he wouldn't have." She looked as if she had more to say on the topic, opened her mouth, but then pursed her lips and shook her head. "You'll find out."
"So, Captain, you've had a long day. Anything I can get you?" Tony asked, his voice casual, although Steve thought there was some tension to it, still. "A bite to eat? Something to drink? You've probably noticed this place is pretty frugal, so there's no running water, but don't worry, I've got plenty to spare. Oh, and the privy's outside, if you need that."
Stark pulled back his hands and nodded. "Heart failure. I have a device that helps, but I need sunlight to charge it."
He should've stayed away. He should've let the kidnappers take Tony, and left it to the remaining Avengers to sort out the situation.
"Of course it won't. I'm going to miss him. And you're going to miss me. There will be lots of manful tears." Tony kept his voice breezy and casual. He was very good at that; he could do it even though Steve's words had stung like he'd just stabbed Tony in the gut.
The possible hut is definitely too far for him to reach in one day, but he's fairly sure he can do it in two. Aiming for it is the only plan he's got, so far. It easily beats wandering aimlessly on the fell, hoping for some miraculous rescue.
"It's pretty good." Steve licked at his lips; the designer receptors on them were so sensitive that he could taste a trace of the coffee Tony must've drunk before he'd come here. "But it's also different. I can definitely tell."
Somehow, between one blink and the next, he went from lying on the couch in his workshop, facing Steve, to a bed somewhere else, with more people around him, speaking in hurried, concerned tones, hands touching him, occasionally followed by a sharp sting. He tried to make sense of the words; they sounded familiar, but he couldn't focus enough to tell where one sentence ended and the next started, and even though it sounded like English, it could've just as well been nonsense.
Steve was up to his neck in this now, anyway. Walking away wouldn't undo what had already happened between them. He might as well see this to the end.
"If you still want to stick around after everything I've told you, you're more than welcome to do so," Tony promises, making sure to word it as an offer, not a command.
Rumlow was right that Stark probably didn't deserve thanks, because he'd been giving the group enough trouble earlier. Still, Bucky couldn't help feeling impressed. That had been exactly the kind of display of courage and smarts that Stark's chroniclers had described on the pages of his magazine: standing up to deal with a threat even when he was held captive and surrounded by enemies, and was all around having the worst day imaginable.
"You're not actually afraid of me, are you, Tony?" Hammer said, sounding almost gleeful.
"Miss Virginia Potts," Randall said.
Tony isn't dead.
"Whoever it is you're trying to protect, they're not worth this, Steve," Tony said, exasperated, disappointed. "Just tell me where you were and all this will go away. You'll wake up in your nice healthy frame."
Seren lifted her head to address Steve directly. "Your mate is a good man. I know many don't see him that way. I'm going to tell them they're wrong."
"I had a hunch," Kamski admits, his poker face firmly in place. It's both frustrating and intriguing to try to puzzle out what's going on in this man's head.
He pumped his hips even faster, making it feel like he was rubbing against every square millimeter of Steve's cock at once, finding every synthetic nerve ending—and then, suddenly, without warning, those signals crossed with the learned sensory patterns of his human mind in the frame's neural node, and everything shorted out.
He didn't want to be stuck in this frame for the rest of his life. This frame wasn't him. It was a mockery of him, one that someone else had picked for him. Still, right now, what he wanted more than anything was his freedom, and he knew he'd never have that without getting rid of that damned tracker. He was ready to risk everything to get there.
The drone pushed him into the chair, holding him down with its pincers. Steve brought up his legs and planted his feet against the drone's midriff, trying to push it away from him. That did him no good, either.
"Oh my God! Captain—do I call you that? Is it really you? What can I do for you?" the receptionist stammered, trying to simultaneously tuck some stray hairs behind her ear with one hand and push the papers in front of her into a more organized pile with the other.
Tony mirrored Steve's moves, tugging at Steve's waistband impatiently. "What's that?"
"Steve! I'd rather say I owe you another, for standing you up last night," Tony said regretfully. "I had every intention to come back later, but there was a kind of an emergency, and I couldn't."
Steve may have started his existence as a machine pretending to be a person, but clearly, he's now crossed some threshold, and he's no longer pretending. Everything he's said during this conversation sums up to the staggering conclusion that he's sentient and self-aware—and going by what Steve has said, the same thing happened to the two SR100s that came before him.
The others were less finely dressed, looking more like your average thug. There were three of them, in addition to the leader. The one to Tony's right wore brass knuckles; the one to his left had purposefully opened his jacket to show off the shoulder holsters. The one behind Tony seemed to rely on his size alone, and wasn't openly carrying any weapons.
From the chin down, like he'd already seen, his body was all solid muscle. But the face—it was as if someone had taken his own, original face and grafted it on a military frame. The nose was the same, and the cheeks, even if there was a little more meat on them. The eyes were his eyes. Even the hair was exactly right, and not just the color, but the cut as well. It was like a mockery of his old body.
He really didn’t want to talk to Tony. The prospect terrified him. He had no idea how Tony would react when he realized what had happened, but he expected it to be bad. And that was exactly why he would sit here, wait, and face the music. Even if he hadn’t gone as far as he’d first feared, he’d still overstepped all boundaries and done things that were unacceptable and inexcusable. He owed it to Tony to at least apologize properly.
"It was her apartment that burned yesterday," Steve said.
Pepper stopped her work for a moment, turning her face up towards Steve and Rhodey. She looked very serious. "Considering how much trouble we've been giving him recently—I'm worried he might decide Tony's outlived whatever usefulness he had, and that the easiest solution is the permanent one. Our best hope is that he'll choose to keep Tony around as bait, to try to get at us. Tie up all the loose ends."
He half expected Jarvis to insist on accompanying him, which would've convinced him there were things in the house Jarvis wanted to hide. He didn't, though, bidding Steve goodbye instead, then heading towards the direction where Pepper had gone.
This is a machine. Tony's got a job to do, and he'll do it as respectfully as he can.
"No," Steve said adamantly. He got up and walked over to sit on the arm of Tony's chair, rubbing soothing circles on Tony's back. "Don't you dare say that. We made our own choices. Besides, I had selfish reasons for getting you out. I've lost too many friends already. I couldn't lose you too, Tony."
Randall blinked, his eyes losing the glassy look, and nodded at Steve. "Good, good. All your readings are in the green as well. Do you feel like you could stand?"
The Mayor's living quarters, which Bucky hadn't seen before, were as impeccable and carefully decorated as her office. The furniture was all very stylish and not overly ornamental. There were paintings on the walls showing bustling cityscapes that seemed reminiscent of the outside world—Bucky could've sworn one was a depiction of Manhattan at the turn of the century.
Tony seemed to appreciate it, too, glancing up at him from the floor and licking his lips. "Would it be bad if I said I really like this body?" he asked, placing a tentative hand on Steve's calf.
"More neutral than good, I guess, but there haven't been any strange fires since the one you went to see yesterday," Bucky offered.
"You can't give in, Tony," Seren said. The way her words came faster and the pitch of her voice rose with concern made the Saurian version of Tony's name almost unrecognizable.
He wouldn't survive the fall, but he certainly wouldn't survive the explosion, either. His only chance of pulling through was to defuse the bombs and take control of the plane. He might still be able to do that. He wasn't about to give up.
He ignored it.
"No, you don't get it," Tony says. He can't have Steve forgiving him under false pretenses. "He was unresponsive, but he hadn't shut down."
This is it. He won't have long without the reactor.
"Sorry," Happy said in turn, sitting back from where he'd been grasping the metal boot.
"A regular beer for Mr. Two Hundred," the bartender muttered, but grabbed a glass to pour the drink anyway. "That'll be five," he added.
The wormhole started to shrink, the unnatural gap into some alien void sealing itself, but just before it vanished entirely, Steve could see a tiny shape emerging through it. A human figure, hurtling towards the ground. Iron Man.
Goddamn. Without even reading it, considering Rhodey's call and that subject line, Tony had a fairly good guess for what it might say.
"Duly noted," Steve said.
That night, Steve dreamed he was in bed with Tony; not the younger one he'd known and actually shared a bed with, but this older iteration he wasn't so fond of. Tony wanted to rekindle their relationship and to enjoy Steve's beautiful new body. He praised how lovely it was, ran his fingers along the carefully designed musculature just like he'd always used to, took Steve's cock in his mouth, and none of it felt good. Even though Steve's body betrayed him by reacting to the touch, it made his flesh crawl. Tony had commissioned the body. He'd chosen those muscles. Maybe he'd even given detailed specs on the genitals. He'd made Steve's body, and he as good as owned Steve.
Apparently satisfied that the room was safe, Tony stepped back into the corridor and motioned at Steve to go in first. He did, feeling so nervous he could barely breathe.
"Thank you, Captain. I appreciate that," she said, her lips turning into a slight smile. "Is there anything else I can help you with?"
Steve walked down a few steps into a room with a low ceiling and dim lights. The music was loud enough to drown most conversations. If Lorenzo's had seemed like a perfectly ordinary restaurant, everything about this place screamed "gangsters" to him. That probably meant that any truly important interactions would take place elsewhere, but then again, all Steve wanted was to find someone who knew something about Simon, and for that, this seemed like a much better starting point.
"Take it easy, I wasn't accusing you of anything," Stane said placatingly, aiming half a smirk at the drone closest to him. Then he took a few steps to stand by Steve's side instead of in front of him, and placed a hand on Steve's back. "Well, Steve, if you're so desperate to save that boyfriend of yours, let's go see him."
That was the first time Steve heard of Tony Stark. He was mildly curious, and looked him up online. Tony resembled Howard a lot, both in looks and in reputation. It seemed like he might've also inherited Howard's fascination with soulmates, since his company was now the market leader in genetic matchmaking.
"Hm, you haven't read Marvels, have you?" Jarvis returned.
That at least gave Steve a glimmer of hope. Maybe, just maybe, he still had some friends left.
It seemed like he had made a decision regarding his next frame.
"Some, yeah," Steve replied. "Look, you can stop pretending that you care for my well-being. If you did, I wouldn't be here, in this frame."
If Tony didn't know better, he'd suspect Steve's leaving something out, but surely, an android shouldn't be able to lie to his designated owner. Then again, Tony wouldn't put it past Kamski to include additional programming just to complicate Tony's life. Speaking of which: "Did Kamski at least tell you why he's giving you to me?"
"I can't claim to know everything about them. I've only talked to them that one time. Still, I'm convinced they're working against Hydra, not for them. They're not going to sell us out," Steve insisted.
"If you told them about everything you do to help—" Steve began.
Pepper raised her eyebrows in surprise. "She did. She was in the rival team I mentioned. How do you know her name?"
Tony was sitting down in one of the chairs, his body still looking like the one that had died. Steve wouldn't have expected anything different; minds tended to default to what they were used to, even when they weren't in a frame. Tony's clothing was familiar, too. Not something fancy that would've fit the surroundings, but a faded old T-shirt and jeans.
The woman broke out laughing, the sound cold and mechanical coming from her cheap fake frame. "In cash!" she repeated, like it was the funniest thing she'd heard all day. "Do I look like an antiques dealer?"
"It's all been fine so far," Steve said reassuringly. "I'm not worried. I want to do that for you."
Steve was wary of going anywhere with the police, because that wasn't many steps removed from being put back on ice, but he had to admit he was curious. Besides, Natasha was promising answers, which he sorely wanted, and more than that, she'd said he'd get to decide on the next steps himself.
"He might, if he had no other way to save himself. It doesn't mean he's planning on ever finishing whatever he's working on," Natasha said.
Mona turned around, shook her head and pressed a finger over her lips. Even from where Bucky stood, all the way at the tail of the party, her fear was obvious. The reason for it became clear after a moment's wait.
Pepper took a moment before she answered, glancing at her coffee, her expression distant. "Yes and no. See, we're used to these kinds of trips having unexpected twists and turns, and dangers lurking behind every corner. In that sense, this was perfectly ordinary. We went looking for a temple based on some recent research, and met some challenges. A competing team, booby traps, the usual, really, but this time, it got very bad. The ruins collapsed. Tony was stuck in the middle of it, separated from the rest of us. We feared we might've lost him, for a while there, but in the end, he made it out in one piece."
Steve had concluded that his first earliest hunch had probably been true, and any soulmate he might've had was either dead or very old by now. He didn't expect a lot of nonagenarians to have sent their samples for soulmate matching.
Tony's foot stopped moving, as did his hips. "Oh, do I ever, but I'm not sure that's safe," he said, his tone suddenly serious.
He has to get to that cabin. He's not a hundred percent sure of the correct heading anymore, but the weather being as it is, a gloomy early morning full of wind and rain, flying the kite is not an option. Climbing to higher ground is unlikely to provide a much better view, either, with all the mist and clouds. He has to go with his best guess.
"Yeah, please do."
"I'm not going to tell you anything, no matter what you do," Steve declared.
He's on the right track after all. Tony has been here. It really was his voice.
Tony groaned, combing his fingers through said substance, which was currently coating his hair. It was the parting gift from a slime monster they’d fought in the Amazon, and it was positively disgusting; the sticky texture and the sickly-sweet smell of it reminded him of a pudding gone sour. And yet, as disgusting as the stuff was, Tony would’ve picked swimming in a lake of it with a whole family of those creatures over what he was actually faced with.
He started pulling Steve deeper into the room—they'd barely made it past the doorway so far. Steve hadn't really been paying attention to anything beyond Tony. There wasn't anything new to see there, anyway, since it was the same suite Steve had been taken to when he'd woken up in the future not too long ago. The furniture was unchanged, and the walls were the same shade of blue as before.
"Yes?" Bucky frowned at her tone, which seemed to have a warning in it.
Why had he been so angry just a moment ago? This was what he wanted and what he needed.
The sound of a door creaking open pulled Tony out of the daydream. It took his sluggish brain a while to remember where he was and what was happening. The source of the noise had been one of the so-far anonymous guards bringing Seren her meager meal.
Pepper was right by his side. She put her arm around his back and pulled one of his arms over her shoulders, doing her best to help him up. Slowly, shakily, Steve managed to get to his feet, and they began to make their way across the small room. With Pepper's assistance, he was able to keep his balance, and the pain settled to a level where he could keep his eyes open. They didn't quite focus properly yet, leaving everything around him hazy. He hoped it would pass, and that his frame hadn't taken permanent neural damage from the abrupt VR disconnect.
"Then I thank you, Seren, for being there for him when I couldn't," Steve said solemnly. His Saurian was still accented, but Tony was sure Seren appreciated the effort.
He had loved Tony for a long time as well, and he had been completely blind to what was right in front of him.
Steve didn't fall asleep right away, of course, but when he started drifting off, he could feel Tony's body pressed against his, feel Tony's soft breaths against the back of his hand where it rested on the pillow, and the bedroom in the Tower stayed away.
"If I do anything that you don't like, anything that doesn't feel okay, just let me know, right?" Steve checked.
Usually, he'd be sharp and ready to go as soon as he opened his eyes, but today, his brain felt sluggish, and it took him a moment to realize why, or where he was. He got a reminder of that when a startlingly warm hand gave his shoulder a squeeze, and a pleasant voice said, "It's okay, I'll deal with that. You can go back to sleep, honey."
"I thought you said we couldn't," Steve breathed.
Tony swallowed, but that did nothing to the lump at his throat. "I think we're a match," he blurted out.
"What needs to be done," Tony answers.
Iron Man grabbed the towel Steve had left hanging in the hook by the mirror and knelt by his side, wrapping it over his shoulders. Steve relished the touch of his hands, even if they were metal-covered.
"Tony," Steve repeated.
Tony took a step backwards, towards the door. "Well, I'll just be on my way, then."
"Would it bother you if there weren't?" Kamski asks back. "Do you feel somehow closer to them, now? Connected?" He taps at his chest in an unnecessary clarification.
Clint Barton nodded at him in greeting. He was sitting on a bike, hovering a few meters above ground, blaster in hand. "I think that's far enough, Rogers," he said.
A moment too late, Steve realized he'd been gaping at Tony for long enough that Tony had noticed, and was looking back at him curiously.
"Everyone else is okay. You'll see them soon," Steve assured him. "I could go and send them in, if you'd like to see them?"
The note had been so concise that Tony couldn't help but feel suspicious. "Tony, we really need to talk," it had said, followed by an address, a time, and a date. The signature, just "Maya," without the last name, had been written in a hand that definitely looked like hers. Then again, he didn't know her all that well, and such things weren't difficult to fake.
He'd been injured before in the line of duty, but it'd never felt like this; this felt like he must be dying.
"And you may well need to face both if you join this team. It's going to be dangerous, and getting as far inland as you need to go will require stealth and skill," she warned him.
Tony felt perfectly happy and safe and never wanted to move again.
He went through the motions of preparing for the day, and drove back to HQ. Even though he was tired, he was also focused: the only thing on his mind was concern for his team, the need to see every member of it safely through this assignment.
"It was in another part of the world entirely," Tony began for the third time. "High up in the Himalayas, where we had heard rumors of a magical gem with unimaginable powers hidden away in a secret, sacred cave. The climb was one of the most memorable that I've done. The views were breathtaking—that's a pun, of course, the air was very thin—and the walls we had to scale really tested our skills. We had to haul poor Virgil up the worst parts like a piece of luggage.
Finally, he opened the door at the very end of the corridor, to find out that it led to an alleyway behind the building. He could hear the sound of a car's tires skidding as it drove away.
As Steve and the policemen walked closer to find out what was happening, the gathered onlookers tried to do the same. A fireman hurried up to Steve and the police. "They're bringing out a casualty. From what I hear, it isn't pretty. Can you give us a hand holding back the crowd?"
From close up, the android's face looks peaceful, as if it's asleep, except that the right half of it is mangled, a chunk of its chassis missing where Tony would expect to see the circle of an LED on its temple. Still, more than enough remains to showcase how flawlessly beautiful its features are, from the cheekbones and jawline to the long eyelashes—and why on Earth would a combat model need those?
"Away from here, as fast as we can," Pepper replied, determined.
He wanted to storm out of the room, too, but he knew that he'd probably end up on the floor if he got up too fast. He didn't have anywhere to go, anyway. The curfew was still in effect outside.
“Sorry,” Steve said. “I promise I’ll be quick.”
He returned to his table and spent his time listening in on the conversations around him. None of them sounded unusual in the least, neither the ones in English nor the ones in Italian, which he only understood partially. By the time his soup arrived, he was convinced this had been a dead end, but at least he got to have dinner, so it wasn't a complete waste of time.
He starts his slow trudge down the hill, looking for a suitable place to set up camp.
The inside of the building is as frugal as the outside implied. The furniture is plain wood and consists of a table, a pair of benches, and a wide platform with old, thin mattresses laid side by side in place of a bed. There's a simple wood-burning stove for cooking and heating, and oil lanterns to provide light; there's obviously no electricity here.
"I didn't believe I'd come across a solution, not anymore, not after the war. I was resigned to my fate, and then this happened. I haven't been this healthy in decades." Tony didn't sound happy at all about it, his voice bitter. "No more worries about running out of charge. No aches or pains, either. I was starting to feel my years, and that's all gone. I might live much longer than any ordinary man, now. And if I had the choice, I'd rather go back to what I had before. If I have to spend the rest of my life in isolation, well, as you put it, I might as well be in prison."
They got dressed, which in Steve's case meant trying on three pairs of pants and four different shirts to find ones that fit. The one t-shirt he could actually pull on without worrying about split seams was still pretty much as tight as all the tailored ones he'd had in his wardrobe in the Tower. He decided it'd have to do; Tony quirked his lips and insisted that it looked much better on Steve than it ever had on him.
Even that wasn't enough for Jarvis. "What name did he go by?" he asked next.
"I'm sure it's not," Steve insisted. His left arm had been caught under Tony's weight, and he wormed it around him now, pulling him into a proper hug.
"I'm glad I'm here, anyway," Steve added. It was true, as well. Whatever the morning would bring, no matter how wrong it was for him to be in Tony's bed, even if he'd end up regretting it later—he knew he would've regretted it more if he'd just walked away. He'd treasure the memory of this night.
"Ruled those out, then?" Steve asked, his tone light but his expression still thoughtful.
Steve was wrong in claiming that he'd saved Tony from torture, Tony thinks. The word is as good a description for his day as any. It's simultaneously full of suffering, and incredibly dull and monotonous.
In spite of himself, he can't help thinking about Tony. Tony would come up with some clever workaround for reaching the cellular network or a communications satellite, but Steve hasn't seen any sign of him in this valley. He shouldn't care, and yet, he can't help but wonder—there's a growing note of worry at the back of his mind that he's been ignoring so far, and it refuses to go away. Out here, this kind of weather can be dangerous for someone who's not prepared for it.
Steve is going to do everything that he can think of to help.
Steve was slightly surprised at that; clearly, Tony hadn't slept in, then. "Do you know when he might be back?"
A woman who was probably her mother had already placed a hand on the girl's shoulder. "Hush, now, Mary. You shouldn't tell stories to the Captain."
He made his way back to the trident, followed a path to the water and scrambled up to perch on a less formidable rock shoreside. From there, he could see everyone approaching the area, but wouldn't instantly be seen by anyone.
"No, you shouldn't have," Tony agrees. "Don't do that again, ever. I've been worried sick."
"I'm not sure, but I promise you he'll be treated fairly," Steve said. "If you hear anything at all from him, please let me know."
He might've suspected this earlier, at the back of his mind, but the full realization was still too much. For what felt like a small eternity, he couldn't do anything but lie there and try to breathe and blink away tears.
He couldn't dwell on that, not right now. He had to figure out what was going on. He'd been trained for this kind of thing, for waking up in a new frame and being on top of the situation, no matter how bad things were.
"Hi, Steve. I'm Ed," Tony said, unblinking, and shook Steve's hand. "I definitely haven't seen you before. I'm sure I'd remember it."
He's nearly prevented from seeing Tony at all by an officious receptionist, who is adamant that Tony Stark is not in this hospital, and that it's a ridiculous claim that he ever has been. Luckily, Steve can be very persuasive, and is eventually able to get in touch with Tony's nurse, who confirms that he can take a visitor.
One thing this conversation had told Steve was that Jarvis must've dealt with suspicions like this before, and was very protective of Tony. If Tony was, in fact, up to something that wouldn't stand the light of day, it was obvious Jarvis would never admit it.
Steve's hand was still there, though it had moved, so that it was covering Tony's, big and solid and safe. Tony was half afraid that when he opened his eyes, he'd find out it wasn't real, after all, but it was: the first thing he saw was Steve sitting next to his bed.
He struggles to find enough fuel for a fire. The best he can manage is so tiny, it barely warms him more than a tealight. It's in no way enough to properly heat up the air in his shelter in this cool weather. He's too cold to sleep, but so tired that he knows he has to rest, which means he spends hours huddled up into a shivering ball, feeling sorry for himself and wishing he were anywhere but here.
"Morning. I hope you managed to get some sleep," Tony greeted him.
Steve hurried to cover the remaining ground to the source of the sounds. Trusting his gloves to protect his hands from any remaining heat, he grabbed the sheet of metal and lifted it aside.
"Captain, do you have a moment?" Peggy called out, as if she didn't outrank Steve so that she could just order him to make time. Not that she would've needed to—Steve always had time for her.
Tony leaned into the touch for half a minute, then straightened up again, visibly pulling himself together. “So, now, will you help me over to the cockpit, before the Spy Kids break something?”
Tony shifted to get up on the quinjet floor, his weight on the elbow of his good arm. “No, I need to get to work.”
"Right, of course you did. Good. Great. Awesome," Tony said, and then, for some reason, lapsed into laughter that sounded half hysterical. His weight disappeared from on top of Steve, and he landed heavily on the bed by Steve's side, the foam of the bed rippling as he hit it.
"Occasionally," Bucky admitted. "When I got my hands on an old copy."
"I'm sure you wouldn't admit it, and I might not admit it myself, either, but I think the truth is, Tony, that we're better together. It's worth making an effort, even if it's difficult. Not trying at all, that's the mistake we made here, and I almost lost you because of it. If I lost you just because we're both too stubborn, I'd never forgive myself. I don't want to make the same mistake again."
Steve's heart sank. He hadn't considered that option. Of course, he should've. It had seemed like Tony had been avoiding him since that moment they'd first met in the burned wreckage two days ago. He wasn't entirely sure why; he supposed it had to do with Tony being responsible for the fires, feeling guilty, and maybe wanting to somehow fix the mess he'd gotten into on his own.
Tony didn't seem surprised, either, not exactly, but there was some confusion on his face. "And I still don't know how! I can't remember!" he exclaimed, spreading his arms. "Obviously, it's got to be the Fountain, but I never would've, not by choice—Maya, what happened to me?"
Steve slammed his palms into the nearest wall, growling in frustration.
"I didn't think you would," Steve said. He wouldn't have thought that of Tony in the past, and he certainly didn't now, when Tony had clearly grown into someone much more responsible, driven not by revenge, but the need to set right the wrongs for which he blamed himself.
Steve pulled back his hand. "I'm not him, or some simulation set up by him. I don't want you to tell me anything. I'm going to tell you something, instead. I'll tell you about our last night together before Hydra killed me."
"I thought he wasn't too badly injured," Steve said, baffled.
"He didn't," Maya said. "He dived into it."
"Oh, Tony. Come here," Steve said, crouched lower, and pulled him into a hug.
Steve will go back into hiding, and things will go back to normal. Everything that happened in the wilderness will be just a bad memory. The conversations they've had here will be better ones, but just memories, nonetheless. For all that they've agreed to try and fix things between the two of them, Tony's not sure how anything will actually change.
He stood up and stepped away from the table to take the call, Sam's curious eyes on him.
He should've implanted a tracker on himself. He's considered that many times, but in the end decided against it, mainly because of the security risks of its details ending up in the wrong hands. As things are, absolutely no one knows where he is. Himself included.
"As far as we know, he still thinks you're at the station up top with Coulson," Fury replied.
"Now, I know that all of you would like to march in through the town gates and interrogate every local you see about Tony's whereabouts," Natasha went on after everyone had expressed their joy about the good news, "but I think a more subtle approach would make more sense. I could go alone and ask around before we give ourselves away."
Unfortunately, Dr. Harris didn't know where Maya was currently staying; he hadn't even heard about the fire at her apartment before Steve mentioned it. So, out of the people who might really know what was going on, Dr. Killian was dead, and Maya, Tony and Simon were all missing.
Tony lying low certainly fit with where he'd been last night: in a shady pub, wearing a disguise. It also made it sound like what Steve had witnessed hadn't been a kidnapping, and that Tony had met with those gangsters willingly, to work on whatever he was trying to sort out.
"I'll hold you to that," Steve said.
He lets his fingers trail upwards, brushing back Tony's hair. It feels right, somehow. As if Steve should've done this ages ago.
Both men nodded, so Steve loosened his hold and leaned backwards, allowing them to get up. The scar-faced man instantly made a grab for his pistol, which was lying on the floor only a few feet away. Before he got there, Steve caught hold of his collar, yanked him around, and punched him in the face hard enough to knock him out. He landed heavily on the floor, his nose almost touching the gun, which Steve picked up for safekeeping. The thug wouldn't be talking for a moment, but at least he wouldn't be trying to escape, either.
"Some other time," Iron Man said.
In the mornings, Steve usually woke up before Tony, and it was rare for Tony to have a moment to observe him in his sleep. Today, though, he surfaced from pleasant dreams to the equally pleasant warmth of a body against his and—not too surprisingly—the exciting hardness of Steve's length pressed against his leg, very close to his own bit of stiff. These things happened, in the morning, especially in such close quarters. Tony knew it was nothing but a physical reaction, and didn't think anything of it, as much as he would've liked to imagine that Steve's body was reacting to him specifically.
Tony drew a sharp breath and blinked, his eyes seeming to refocus on the cavern around them. Clearly, Steve had caught him by surprise. Finally, he looked down at Steve, and said, "Hm, I did, didn't I? It's quite the story. I guess now is as good a time for it as any."
"No," Pepper said right away, then stopped, frowning, her fingers clenching around her cup. "I don't know what's going on with him, but I can't imagine how he could be. I saw the damage at Jan's house. She's his friend. He wouldn't do that to her. And that fire yesterday, I heard someone died?"
He tilts back Tony's head to make sure his airway is open, and spends seemingly endless moments trying to confirm whether he's breathing. Steve's convinced that for him to still be alive, surely, he must be, but it doesn't seem like his chest is rising and falling at all. Finally, resting his cheek over Tony's mouth and nose and listening carefully, holding his own breath, Steve is able to catch a soft puff of exhaled air.
"And you know for sure that this was an assassination?" Steve asked, frowning.
In the end, Steve decided to just call Bucky, too. The description he went for was a little more detailed than the one he'd given to Pepper, but not much: mainly that he'd found Tony, had strong reasons to suspect that Tony was responsible for the fires, but that he didn't know the whole story, and was hoping to get more details about it tonight. Bucky, in turn, told him that there had been no new fires that seemed like they might be related to the case—just as there wouldn't have been, if Tony was the one causing them. Steve had been keeping him busy, after all.
Of course, Ultron didn't miss it, either. "Nervous, are we?" he commented through the elevator's speakers instead of the drones.
Tony insisted that they order a meal at his expense from some fancy 175th floor place offering fusions of cuisines that Steve hadn't even heard of before. Steve tried to say that he could afford to pay his own half, but Tony wouldn't hear of it, arguing that the least he could do after giving Steve a weird fit instead of a good time was to buy him a nice dinner, ignoring Steve's repeated reminders that said weird fit had been just about the best time he'd ever had. Tony could be just as stubborn as Steve, when he set his mind to it. In the end, Steve gave in—this was just food. He didn't want to turn it into an actual argument.
"Take it easy, Mr. Rogers. You've been in storage for some time," a voice he didn't recognize spoke up to his left.
!" Tony roars at the Avenjet's computer screen in front of him. "He can't have gotten that far. If there'd been some kind of a portal, we would've picked up the energy signature. We need better coverage. What aren't we using yet?" He taps his fingers on the console, clearly thinking fervently. "Oh, I know. We're in Siberia. Russian reconnaissance satellites!"
"Well, well," Steve muttered. That could be another connection, and one he hadn't expected at all. "Do you know if there was anyone called Simon among those thugs?"
Just a few stretches of corridor away he'd probably find everything he could hope for to break out of here, if he just played this carefully.
"Sometimes, you just step on that gangway on the wrong foot, and that's a mistake that can be fixed," Steve tried.
Steve raised his eyebrows. Fury had clearly spent some time thinking about this. "I hadn't thought I was that important."
"Combat model, huh? We employ some, too, but I haven't personally worked with them," Rhodey comments, instantly dissolving Tony's hopes. "Did you work for someone else before Tony? Seen any action?"
Of course, his mind instantly went to Tony.
"It's Rhodes," came the unexpected reply. "Don't hang up."
Tony's eyes had been closed, but they flickered open now. The blue of them was like a placid pool in the middle of a scorching desert. "You know, I don't think I've been with anyone quite like you, either. There's something about you. You make things feel so meaningful, somehow. That's not to say—you know, I don't expect anything. I know this is just a fling. It just feels like it's more than that."
He really doesn't deserve this, not after everything he's done, after the kind of man he's been. But here he is, still alive and kicking, and he swears that he'll get home and do everything in his power to make those sacrifices worthwhile. That's the thought that keeps him on his feet as he stumbles through the rocky wilderness after crash-landing his armor, and finally into the sensor range of Rhodey's search party.
He's never had any scruples about talking to himself, but here, it somehow feels wrong when it's otherwise so quiet. It bothers him more than he would've thought that he has no one to talk to, no one at all. He's so used to having at least Friday or one of the bots around.
They took their time looking for a suitable campsite. Since they were so close to an enemy town, it would be crucial to find a place that was sheltered and had good lookout points close by. Once they'd found such a spot, Steve volunteered to return to the rendezvous to wait for Natasha. He knew she probably wouldn't be joining them for several hours, but he wanted to get the news from her as soon as possible.
"If there's a shred of decency left in you, a remnant of a conscience, you'll atone for everything you've done by helping us in the fight," the Mayor continued. "What you see in this room are the tools that could make all the difference in it. I need to you to fix them. Make them work so we can use them."
He didn’t look like he was, Steve had to admit; he remembered there being a feverish gleam in Tony’s eyes and a flush on his face which weren’t there anymore. Still, this felt too good to be true. “Prove it,” he insisted.
Bucky took a moment to consider how to go on about this, then decided that he should probably tell her the whole story to get her informed opinion. So, he described the situation in detail over the start of their meal: how Stark had asked to be allowed outside several times along his captivity, how he'd seemed to fall ill today, and still insisted that a respite from the dungeon would be the only solution. Bucky also mentioned his own view that sending a doctor or at least one of the nurses to see him would make a lot of sense.
Steve leans closer and kisses Tony on the lips.
Jan soon returned with a sheet of paper that had at least fifty names written on it in a curly hand. "That's everyone I could remember, but I can't promise for sure that I haven't forgotten a few," she said apologetically.
"It's not something else. I felt it, Pepper." Tony tapped at the arc reactor. "There's no other explanation, no matter how much I'd like to have one. Which is exactly why I'm not going to get it tested. You know I couldn't do that without his consent, which would mean talking to him about it. Nope. No way."
Rhodey must've recruited Pepper as well: she called Tony and demanded him to explain what mysterious Avengers business required several days of full-time work from a genetics lab. He refused to tell her. Luckily, he'd never mentioned his anti-INCS gene therapy idea to either of them when he'd first come up with it, so all they could do was guess.
On Tony's other side, Jarvis huffed and shook his head. "Tony, couldn't you at least wait until you're back on your feet before you start making new plans for getting yourself in trouble?"
Tony knelt in front of Steve, putting one hand on his hip. The other went to his cock, his fingers running gently along the length of it, from the base to the tip that was shaped as if it'd been cut, though this frame had never met a surgeon's scalpel. He then took hold of the shaft, lifting it as if to test the weight of it. The way he was touching Steve felt simultaneously reverent and almost clinical, more about exploring than exciting Steve. An engineer admiring a well-designed machine. Somehow, that didn't make it less hot, but even more so, with the way Tony's full, undivided attention was on Steve.
"I'm sure he'll make a fine addition to the team, then," Tony declared. "Did you meet everyone already?"
"You'll need to be careful, I might be on a hair-trigger," Tony said, sounding less enthusiastic about it than Steve could've hoped.
Steve woke up, and even though his body was healed again, the memory of what he'd been through lingered. His heart was racing, and he was breathing too fast; he was shivering, skittish like a cornered animal. That was all he was, in the end. Too much pain, and there wouldn't be anything left but the most primitive instincts.
Steve had had no reason to be so paranoid as to watch what he ate, and now he felt foolish. Apparently, he should've assumed that everyone was against him unless proven otherwise. Too angry to stay still, he stood up again to face her. "And why would you do something like that? Added safeguard to make sure I don't break parole?"
"Sure. There was all this stuff about shafts and pistons and nuts and lubrication," Tony quipped in kind. Still sitting on the floor, he ran his fingers gently and tentatively along Steve's spent cock, as if he were seeing it for the first time again. When he went on, his tone was more serious. "So, you're feeling all right, still?"
"It's not for no reason. It's because of him," Maya said, her gaze on Tony. "There's no artifact, only him."
"At first, I wasn't sure whether it was a man or a monster that I was looking at. He wore a mask with horns and tusks, its mouth set in a terrifying grimace, and his clothing was a robe decorated with fur and feathers. I didn't recognize him then, of course, but it was Cauac. He held a long ceremonial blade with serrated edges, pointing it at me. 'Stark! I will not let you defile the sacred ground,' he growled in flawless English. 'You will pay in blood for trying to do such a vile thing.'
Steve didn't miss it when two men at the back started moving towards the door at the far end of the room that'd give them a way out. He rushed towards it, and caught up with them in the corridor beyond.
Tony picked up a mug from the table—coffee, probably, and cold going by his frown. He set it down again, untouched. "So, yeah," he went on. "So far, I've only talked to a bunch of doctors, and they only knew the medically relevant details. I remember the fight at the workshop, some of that stuff in VR," a look of discomfort passed his face, "and I know that there were some complications getting me back to frame space. I have no clue how you actually managed to get in the Tower. What happened to Obie, anyway? I hear I'm officially myself now, so clearly he's no longer Tony Stark."
"Steve?" he asks very cautiously.
"I'll try not to, from now on," Tony said, his voice soft but warm. He let go of Steve's hand to wrap his arm around Steve's shoulders in a loose hug. "Thank you for telling me that. I appreciate it."
Steve shakes Tapio's hand briskly, impatient to be done with the pleasantries. "Look, this is going to sound like a stupid question," he begins, "but could you tell me where we are?"
It wasn't all bad. No coherent thoughts meant he could finally catch some rest.
He couldn't possibly mean it like Steve thought. Steve tried to push away the completely inappropriate thoughts as fast as they came. Iron Man had made it clear that anything past friendship was not on the table for them, and never would be.
Steve frowned. Even if that was a joke, it was incredibly irresponsible. Frames like this weren't on sale for the general public, and they certainly weren't around to be bought as expensive sex toys. The annoyance was like a bucket of ice water over his head, washing away his good mood.
"Pepper! Any time now—they're right on our tail!" Rhodey called out. The car swerved sharply to the left, then up. At least they weren't falling out of the sky. Not yet.
"Nothing like you," Tony insisted.
When Pepper asked him if Tony was all right, he couldn't help but think of how very much all right and how very, very good Tony had looked in his birthday suit. Steve was glad he was talking to her on the phone and didn't have to worry about the look on his face.
"You sound like him," Tony says, his voice breaking. He raises Steve's limp fingers to rest them against his cheek.
Stepping inside with Rhodey, Steve found himself in a hall that resembled an indoor junkyard, about the size of the earlier small garage. The place was full of tech that looked like spare parts: half-disassembled cars and drones, and smaller items on shelves and tables. A lot of it was visibly old and worn, probably scavenged. There was something oddly familiar about it, but he couldn't quite put a finger on what it was—not until he spotted the man standing by the wall to his left, staring back at Steve, his big, dark eyes wide in shock.
"I found out already," Steve said.
Tony makes it out. Yinsen doesn't.
Tony scrambled up from where he'd been crouched next to something that looked like a big silvery wing, as long as Steve's frame was tall. "I wasn't sure you'd show up again. You ask her out yet?"
"Well, then, for the record, you're welcome to join me in the shower again anytime you wish," Steve said, in the flirtiest voice he could muster. "In armor or without."
"Good," Steve said. He placed his head against Tony's chest, settling into that position he liked best, where he felt the safest.
"Awesome," Steve said, grinning up at him, lifting his hips off the bed, trying to grind his cock against Tony.
"Well, I can't deny you look good," Steve had to say, even though Tony's uninvited touch made him shudder.
"I'd also prefer not to talk when I'm not wearing it," Iron Man went on, "so there's another important rule. If I do anything you don't want, anything you don't like, tell me and I will stop. Can you promise that, too?"
Also, he still hated the whole thing, science or not.
Tony turns to sit sideways so that he can put his hands on Steve's arms. "You saved my life. That wasn't some glitch. You were still doing your job."
It happened when he was, as usual, up to his waist inside the machinery of the strutter, working on making sure that each compartment was sealed and watertight. It wasn't dramatic; he didn't pass out and collapse to the ground, or get assailed by chest pains. Instead, he started feeling faint and then realized that something was wrong.
"The three of us," Stark corrected. "I have a plan. You'll need to help me walk, though."
The dinosaur walked closer and lowered himself to the ground, waiting to be mounted.
"Yeah, tell me about it," Steve muttered, the memory of Rumlow and his last mission flashing through his mind again.
His best hope of escaping, and indeed of just surviving, still rested on James. If he could get outside soon, he would stand a chance. He'd be fine and back on track with his plan.
He had to be wrong about this. Iron Man couldn't be flirting with him. He couldn't be offering what Steve thought he might be. Suddenly, Steve's heart was pounding, and he found himself wishing he wasn't naked, because the mere thought of Iron Man, still mostly armor-clad, touching him in a completely different way was a turn-on like nothing else Steve could imagine.
Howard dropped the journal on the table and raised his hands in surrender. "No, no, that's not what I'm saying! All love is important. No one knows that better than I do, I've loved lots of ladies in my day!" he said hurriedly. "I'm all for everyone getting together with whoever they want to, it's all good. I'm just saying, if there were someone out there you could have this special connection with, wouldn't you want to know?"
"You hear that, Cap? I told you! It's not just a thing out of romance novels," Howard announced, his flashy grin particularly triumphant. "There's science! There's solid evidence right here!" He tapped at the science journal on the table in front of him with his index finger.
"For the past fifty years or so, Luna has been building a reputation as the go-to place for all kinds of storage services, particularly for data," Pepper explained. "Putting all those tunnels they've excavated to use."
"Did you tell all this to the police, too?" Bucky asked, looking awed, when Steve had finished his summary.
"Jarvis? Switch off the lights, please," Steve said, not sure if the AI was even present in the plain room.
He couldn't stop thinking that he might cause something like that. Even if he'd never, ever choose to, the power to do it was inside of him, and he might not be able to stop himself if it tore loose.
Most respectable citizens of Dinotopia weren't overly fond of the vast, jungly expanse of the Rainy Basin. Outside of the few commonly used trails, it was difficult terrain. The air was hot and humid, much of the insect life poisonous. Then there were the predators who roamed the region: the huge tyrannosaurs, allosaurs and giganotosaurs, and the smaller but shrewder dromaeosaurs, who, unlike their cousins in the cities, had chosen to maintain their original carnivorous lifestyle. None of them were supposed to prey on humans or dinosaurs, just the less intelligent creatures of the forests and rivers, but they didn't always abide by the rules.
"Ultron, this is an authorized police override. Open the door," Natasha repeated.
Tony turned to stare at Steve, frowning and blinking. Steve guessed he was going through a train of thought similar to his when he’d regained consciousness. Steve let him work through it, and sure enough, after a while, Tony’s eyes went wide and his mouth fell open. “Shit,” he swore. “Holy shit. Did we fuck?”
Tony has no idea where this is going, but even after everything he's been through today, he's more curious than concerned.
Panic washing over him, Bucky pushed Stark's chin up with his metal hand and patted his cheek sharply with the good one. "Come on, Tony. I need you to wake up," he coaxed. "Please."
It was a sudden overload where he couldn't sense anything but pleasure. The sound of his own low groan and the slap of skin against skin faded out, and his vision went blank.
"Stark! I thought you were a man of your word," the metal-armed Northerner shouted after him, voice accusing. "You promised to come with us."
Steve read the article several times, but a lot of the terminology in it was completely unfamiliar to him and only served to confuse him further. After several searches and a lot of reading, it all slowly began to make sense, and yet, he still couldn't quite wrap his mind around what he'd learned.
"You know I get around a hundred emails an hour, I can't possibly keep track of all of them," Tony replied dismissively. "Yours have the highest priority, of course, but I've been busy."
"You were one of them?" Sam blurted out, visibly shocked.
"They did it because it served their purposes. It gained them another soldier for their misguided cause," Stark countered. Although he spoke softly, there was a determination in his tired voice that sounded so honest and somber, it was very difficult to believe it could be an act. "Can you name one person here who's ever even tried to have a proper conversation with a dinosaur? They're treated like animals, even though they're just as smart as us. Good people don't do that."
Tony leaped up and backed away, his eyes huge with disbelief, as if Steve had suddenly turned into some kind of a monster. "No. No, that's not possible. You're not—you can't be… That's a dress-up costume. This is some kind of terrible practical joke. You're not really Cap."
The call instantly brought back Steve's earlier worries. If Pepper was concerned as well, it seemed more likely that his fears hadn't been misplaced. He chastised himself for not going after Tony at the bar right away, so that he might've at least gotten the registration of that car.
Steve's eyes caught something at the bottom of the hollow that stood out among the debris: a scrap of paper, its edges singed and curled up. He bent down to reach for it. There was barely enough room for his upper body between the beams, but he managed to fish out what looked like the remains of a note of some kind, or maybe a letter. For it to end up where it'd been, Steve was willing to bet it'd been in Tony's pocket, and maybe his body had partially protected it from the flames. As it was, most of it had still burned away. Steve couldn't even say for sure what size the original sheet of paper might've been. The remaining text was smeared beyond legibility, except for one word written in a neat hand: "Maya."
Steve was glad to follow that order, so he could offer some attention to Tony's body as well. He poured a generous amount of lube over his hands and got to work. Tony's hundred percent biological skin, hairless not by design, but because he chose to groom it, felt silky smooth under the pads of Steve's fingers as he ran them between his butt cheeks. Even more delightful was the tightness of his hole around the fingertip Steve pressed inside. "Like this?" he asked.
Tony looked exactly like he had before Steve had gone in the ice, his clean-shaven, youthful face making his eyes seem even bigger than they had in his older clones. Instead of the silk robes Steve had come to expect from this place, Tony was still wearing the same shabby style of clothing Steve was used to seeing him in. On this younger frame, which wasn't quite as gaunt as his previous one had been, it gave an impression that was retro and rebellious rather than old and worn.
"Oh. I never did tell you his full name, did I?" Steve said, sheepish. He sat back from Tony and motioned at Bucky to move closer. "Tony Stark. Meet James Buchanan Barnes. Bucky, to his friends."
Mister, not Captain. He was definitely not at SHIELD.
Tony curled his bare toes against the floor. "No, you did that, what was it, a couple of weeks ago?"
"I could use that, but that's for later. There's a reason why I wanted to have this chat right now," she said. "I wanted to warn you, Steve. Your assignment tomorrow? There's something not quite right about it. It came up on a short notice, and it doesn't make sense to me. You remember that illegal cloning facility you're supposed to take down, don't you?"
"Do it," Steve said.
A shiver ran through the ground, then another, and after the third, Bucky realized it wasn't a small earthquake, but the footsteps of a massive beast lumbering through the forest. The sounds of breaking branches followed, and then, a roar louder than any animal sound he'd ever heard before.
"No need to worry, though. They're just here as insurance," Hammer said, reaching to place a hand on a metallic arm. "See? Inert and perfectly harmless."
He needs to stop gaping at Steve.
"No, we don't," Tony disagreed. "I don't think you realize how long it's been for me. I'm not the kid you knew back then."
"Even if it was logical, that doesn't make it ethical," Tony points out.
If Tony was alive, they would have to come up with some way to infiltrate the Tower, something they hadn't dared to attempt even when they'd had all the tech in Tony's workshop at their disposal. If he wasn't—if Tony was dead, then Stane had won, and going after him would be nothing but a pointless quest for revenge.
"Definitely," Steve assured him. "I hope it was good for you too, except for that last part."
They'd sent a few of Tony's samples out for DNA sequencing, and confirmed that the experiment had had no detectable effect on his INCS in any of the tissues they'd tested. Not that it'd been a big surprise. Clearly, the synchronization effects between them were as strong as they'd ever been.
Steve could see why Tony wouldn't want something so dangerous ending up in criminal hands, but he was surprised, and disappointed, that Tony would choose to use the artifact against his enemies in such a destructive way. And yet, he couldn't help wanting to give Tony the benefit of the doubt: maybe he'd had no choice. Maybe he'd only done those things when he'd been hopelessly cornered. Steve couldn't be sure until he heard Tony's side of the events.
An older lady in a bathrobe, with rollers in her hair, rushed towards Steve as soon as her eyes landed on him. "Captain America! I'm so glad you're here!" Before Steve realized what was happening, she'd wrapped her arms around him.
Wherever he is, from the survival perspective, he's slightly concerned about the weather. If early afternoon is like this, the night will probably be chilly. It might even get to sub-zero Celsius. He'll need shelter or he'll be in trouble.
"So, are you asking me to be your bodyguard, or a detective?" Steve checked.
Tony thinks he's hallucinating with the lack of oxygen, at first, because his vision is starting to fade at the edges and what he's seeing shouldn't be possible.
"Would you like me to take your mind off it, instead?" There was a new note to Iron Man's voice as he asked that, something Steve didn't think he'd ever heard before. Hopeful, but tense.
He did, a few hours later, manage to catch hold of T'Challa to ask if there was any way they could make sure Tony was telling the truth. T'Challa said that technically, it would be a simple matter if they had access to Tony's DNA, but sequencing someone's genome without their explicit consent was so unethical, he'd only consider it if lives depended on it.
It took them some time to navigate a safe path through the rubble to open ground, back to where the remaining fire engines and police cars were parked. Tony followed Steve's lead, his footsteps steady and unwavering. Except for his purported amnesia, he didn't give the impression of someone who had a head injury.
"It's eleven forty-five, sir. Mr. Rhodes, Miss Potts and Mr. Hogan have been waiting in the workshop for several hours," Jarvis informed them.
Tony takes down the bad guys and rescues the civilians, and afterwards, he does actually feel better about everything; like maybe he could live with himself if he did this on a regular basis. It makes him feel in control. He can make a difference, and change things for the better. Even if it's too little and too late, at least it's something. He's trying.
Tony tensed at first, but then relaxed. "Don't worry, I'm fine," he said, misinterpreting Steve's gesture as a question.
Against his better judgement, he found himself drifting off, into dreams that were far more pleasant than the dismal reality. He was on his airship, long before the island, with his friends who were his family: Jarvis, Rhodey, and Pepper. Steve was there as well, so loving and perfect that it hurt, his arms around Tony as they watched the brilliant seascape that opened beyond the windows of the observation room. Sunlight and water, stretching into the horizon. Wide open skies.
he signaled.
Tony was messaging.
Tony got up and walked around the strutter, keeping one hand on it for balance.
This time, their breakneck flight brought them to the landing platform closest to Steve's floor without any paparazzi in sight.
The group of Tony's drones marched in, arranging themselves in a row exactly opposite Hammer's. Looking at them, the contrast in the designs was even more obvious, like the difference between a sports car and a wagon.
"I can't believe you'd do that," Steve says firmly. "How did you even—he would've defended himself. Did you ask him for the parts?"
"He would've killed you," Steve returned. "For certain. He tried to, actually, when Natasha and Fury made their entrance, but I caught him and the shot went wide."
Pepper was eyeing her with concern, and Steve couldn't blame her—she must be worried that Natasha might go missing, too. "How will you find us when you return from your reconnaissance mission?" she asked.
"Yes, and no. I can't deny that I did see an opportunity, but I never, ever would've followed you to your room if I hadn't wanted to—if I hadn't wanted you," Steve confessed, staring at the tips of his boots. They looked gray in the twilight, and his toes felt numb. "Because I really did. You were flirting with me, and, well, you're just, you're incredibly attractive. As much as I'm Captain America, I'm still human. Sometimes I want things so badly, I can't say no, even if I know I should."
Without a word, Tony holds out his hand, with the softly glowing cylindrical device on his palm.
"Sure. What would you like to talk about?" Tony said, keeping his voice casual. "The weather? The news? The latest fashion? I hear those hats are on the way out." He nodded towards the leader.
Everything feels pleasantly fuzzy and warm; he's resting on a soft surface, and his mind is blurry enough that he neither knows where he is, nor cares very much. This is nice. He could stay like this.
"Well, you go back to him then," Tapio says, casting a glance at Steve and nodding towards the hut. "I will come to you when I have news."
Steve stayed quiet, but he let go of Tony's fingers to run his hands comfortingly up and down Tony's forearms.
Tony leaned against Steve, wrapped his arms around him and rested his head against Steve's front. "We make quite the pair, don't we," he mumbled into Steve's chest.
"I've been a bit unfair, haven't I, making you wait so long?" Steve teased him, running his thumb over the precome beading on the tip of Tony's cock, his other hand roaming up and down Tony's thigh and side.
"Okay, doesn't hurt to check," Steve said.
"Maybe? I don't—they only came here once, and Maya and Al didn't seem too happy about that." Dr. Harris glanced around as if worried someone might overhear him gossiping about his colleagues.
Sam follows him back to the Avenjet in silence.
As the minutes on the cab's display ticked closer to zero, Steve crouched to take a better look at the seat next to him. Of course, the anti-grav pack wasn't openly on display. It'd probably be released when some specific set of danger parameters was met.
"Thanks," Steve said, doing his best to keep his expression neutral and non-confrontational. Better play the clueless outsider. "I think I know already. Can I have the minestrone and the ossobuco, please?"
