“Listen, Cap. It’s fine. I know I lied to you.” Tony spits out, making Steve turn back to him. He’s looking at his empty hands like they’re covered in blood. “I get it. I couldn’t tell you, but that does not make it okay. I’m not hurt, I won’t put up a fight?”
Bruce encourages him to keep a log of everything he notices, but doesn’t seemed too worried about it, telling Steve even with the serum the human brain does weird things. Still, he takes several blood samples and runs some memory tests on him before letting him go back to his floor.
T-minus 5 and Tony has to at least say something, something for the ‘just in case’ and ‘what ifs’ the dramatically altered situation of his escape forces to mind.
Tony watches as he sits, face screwed up and hands clasping the blanket too tight. “Well, nothing is broken.” He starts and Steve smiles before reaching out a hand on instinct. Tony flinches, but when Steve goes to set it back in his lap he snatches it up and presses it between both of his own. For a moment they both just look at the contact, but when Tony looks up they both smile.
“I’ll have your back.” They nod and the clock is down to T-minus 3, so Tony moves towards the armor without further discussion. Yinsen waits to follow until the sounds of boots and voices pass their door, signaling the switch from night to day watch. Then he jumps up and they seamlessly move into assembling the metal plates around Tony. With the first clang of pieces latching together, time suddenly speeds forward with a jerk and everything begins spinning into frantic motion.
They fucking did it. He fucking did it. He got them both out! His laugh may be approaching manic, but even under all the heavy leather and scorching sun he feels cool and buoyant.
It is an insane and idiotic risk, but even with his admittedly superior memory, the mind is too susceptible to data loss. Even after Rhodey pulls him out of this god awful sand pit, the stakes are too high not to create a backup.  Besides, after years of hiding things from SHIELD at the olympic level, he is rather adapt at secreting away tangible information.
“Make sure noone is going to come in and I’ll show you.” Tony replies easily, already moving for the ties at his side. The swift movement to and from the opening brings a real laugh out of Tony. Though it is not quite enough to soothe the ache at seeing Rhodey walk fully on his own. If anything can be prevented, that is up at the top of Tony’s wish list. “Wow babycakes, didn’t know me shirtless got you that hot.”
Steve’s kisses have made it down to Tony’s collar bone and he always knew that as a sensitive spot, but god the way Steve drags his tongue along the line of it is nothing short of a revelation. The rolling of his hips speeds up, muscles contracting of their own accord. They are pressed so tightly together, Tony’s cock feels trapped and he can only imagine how Steve is feeling in his beautifully tight jeans.
“That really was just a series of misunderstandings and your inability to get over it really shows a rather imperative character flaw for someone I trust with so much information. I don’t know if this position is really right for you.” Tony babbles, admittedly stalling because he really cannot involve her in this again. He also really cannot lie to her when she is looking at him with those eyes.
“Tony, take the damn thing off.” The accompanying glare is as nice as anything Tony has ever seen. Oh he is just so glad to get more years with this guy.
“It’s good. Open.” Pepper has finished packing up now and slings the bag over her shoulder. After smoothing the wrinkles in her skirt as best she can, she smiles and waves at him. He returns the gesture, grabbing the only pen left on the table so he can twirl it in his fingers. She points at her watch and raises both eyebrows to silently remind him that she plans to be over bright and stupid early tomorrow. He bites the end of his pen and nods.
Instead he rasps his knuckles on that solid chest one more time and takes a step back, turns to pick up the gauntlet case.
But, Tony will save him. Of course he will. Tony will save him and eat any guilt for the pain Yinsen will surely have to face gladly. Yinsen is too good a man, too good a friend for Tony not to be selfish.
Steve’s smile is lighter now, but the warmth radiates all over Tony and he just basks. He feels like a lazy house cat, delighting in the sheer sunlight that is Steve Rogers’ happiness. He runs his fingers up Steve’s arms, over those broad shoulders to rest on either side of his neck. In return, Steve settles both of his hands on either side of Tony’s waist, clutches into the fabric of his T-shirt.
“You can leave before I fall asleep, you know?” He says instead. Steve stills, then lets go of his hand and Tony wants to staple his mouth closed for that. When he turns to look at Steve though, he is smiling, a little hesitant but still kind and happy.
“I know.” Jarvis soothes, hand tightening on his wrists to force more cool water into the palms. “You cannot touch a hot pan like that, Tony. How did you not notice how hot they where?”
“Pepper, I promise I will explain everything to you eventually. But, you just have to trust me right now. I need to figure out how to keep you safe before I can involve you and I didn’t have the time to map it out in between all the escaping.” She deflates at the words, turning to face the front seats and close her eyes. Happy meets his through the mirror and the horrified sympathy there just makes Tony shrug and smile hopelessly back at him.
“What happened Jarvis?” She calls out as she steps away from the door and stumbles towards them. The once soothing blur of the world seems sinister and cruel as it attempts to slow her progression.
“Yes, Mama.” Tony grins and Jarvis relaxes beside them. In the moments to follow she gets swept along enough in the flurry of carting both herself and Tony off to bed and promptly forgets about the familiar shimmering scales.
Tony is far from the last person on earth to figure it out, but the amount of time it takes him to finally realize there is more than spontaneous empathic abilities happening here is ludicrous to say the least.
When he gets up to the common floor, he immediately starts searching for someone. Today is a sign that he should bring his team in on this issue, or at least get someone to reassure him that forgetfulness isn’t a sign of some super villain plot. Luckily, he spots Iron Man landing on the balcony just as he makes it into the living room.
“God, Steve.” Tony sobs, but he stops himself from collapsing again. Steve can feel him pull himself up, can feel the desire to cling back into Steve radiating off of him. He wants to pull him in, wants to keep him right here where they can see each other and Steve can know it’s all real again. “I missed you. I missed you so much.”
“A miniature arc reactor cut into my chest.” Tony admits after a small pause. Rhodey knowing would not disprove that Obidah got the information from someone in the Ten Rings. Tony is pretty sure, but he never got a complete picture of how personally involved Stane was post capture. If he found out another way, well, Obidah having no idea about the arc can only mean good things.
Steve laughs, skin going that wonderful blotchy red and Tony can’t help himself; he just has to lean forward and lick a stripe across that overwarm cheek. It tastes wonderful, sweat salty, but the real draw of it is the great huffing grunt of air Steve lets out at the motion. Actually, it’s really the way it makes him squeeze Tony closer and turn to drop him back down on the couch.
There is a pause after he proclaims his demand, Pepper is a little red in the face and her hand is clamped over her mouth. Before he can do more than narrow his eyes at what is clearly her amusement at his turmoil, Jarvis speaks up.
“Stop fighting,” Tony snaps, as he lowers Steve onto the surprisingly sturdy old wire frame bed someone left in here. The building is sealed off from the storm outside and a wood burning stove is positioned in the far corner with a stack of dry firewood next to it. Clearly, this place has been used recently, but the storm will buy them some security from the official owners.
"Everyone has their shit Steve." He says it softly, softer than he knew his voice could ever be and it feels like he is telling himself more than anything. A hand takes his, just as gentle as the words.
Something too kind to be pity flashes in Steve’s eyes, but Tony can’t place it before it’s gone. Instead he smiles, brushes Tony’s fingers away and slides his own hand over the catches. His breath is warm on the side of Tony’s face, his chest solid where it presses slightly into Tony’s shoulder. The proximity ignites that pool of heat low in Tony’s belly that seems to always simmer in silence, waiting for Steve to set it off.
half a second from swallowing his own tongue. He suddenly remembers that he can actually actively control his body and rushes to punctuate the admission with some kind of physical demonstration. Unfortunately, remembering he can control his body and actually doing anything with it are two very different things, and all he manages is scrambling to clutch his fingers into Steve’s shoulders and collapse his knees to fully settle into his lap once more.
“Steve,” is all Tony seems able to say in response. His smile wavers, then brightens. He laughs and leans forward to brush their lips together.
“What I did is to save your life.” A smile as he answers the question Tony did not ask, but remembers. Yinsen goes through his monologue like a trained actor, jiggling the shards of shrapnel against glass right on queue before tossing them. Tony catches without thinking and considers that maybe he is playing through the motions too before remembering the previous deviations. Yinsen’s description continues, while Tony ignores the jar in his hand, bracing to interrupt on schedule.
Pepper is stunning, freckles and red rimmed eyes and those lovely bangs he always adored. Her hair is blowing around and framing her face and it would be so very easy to fall into her again. She is poised and crystalline, glowing as she bites at her lip and presses back tears with a strength so graceful it takes his breath away. He wants to collapse into her arms, feel her perfect fingers brush through his hair and her lips ghost at his ear with reassurance.
“Yeah, I can…” Steve starts, then swallows, adam's apple jumping down and back up under his skin. Tony feels an unreasonable urge to kiss it too, but flicks his eyes back up to Steve’s instead. There is a little nervousness there, a little tension, but mostly he just looks indulgent. He’s looking at Tony like he could be talked into anything in the world and not really mind. It makes Tony’s stomach flutter, makes him feel small and precious. “I can sleep over.”
“I-I don’t think so.” He manages and she seems completely unphased by the answer. There is no hint of recognition in her eyes and her smile is still warm. She nods and moves to sit on a stool behind the counter.  The rain yesterday would have irritated her knee replacement.
“It’s okay, Tony. I got you. You’re going home.” Rhodey has him fully upright now and they are moving inside the closest helicopter. From his peripheral Tony can see a few of the other soldiers pulling a flat cloth stretcher over to Yinsen and moving to transfer his body onto it.
He went through it as exactly as his memory would allow. Held out and responded ‘no’ until the splashing water caught on the battery and he could do nothing but give the same broken ‘yes’ as before. When they take him out into the sun the heat is just as jarring as the Stark logos and when the big fat man shakes his hand knowing how to escape does not stop him from saying “No he won’t”.
“I’m afraid, “ A pause, one that stretches long enough that Steve contemplates repeating his last question, “Iron Man is unavailable for a sparring match today.”
“Tony.” Steve says in as soothing a tone as he can muster and runs both his hands up over his shoulder, through his hair and down to cup his face. “I’m so sorry.”
“Mr. Stark would like me to apologize, but the situation is classified.” JARVIS reassures him, tone about as truly apologetic as could be possible. It makes some of the anger fizzle out, but he still feels about ready to scale down the side of the building if the elevator remaines locked.
“We will both get out of here.” His voice is too loud and dry, but he does not clear his throat or move to look at Yinsen when the older man jumps at the sudden burst. The room descends back into their shared silence for a stretch of precisely measured time.
"Move." This time the demand is paired with a light shove to Steve’s shoulder as Tony tries to pull up the edge enough to get room for him to crawl into the pile.
Steve blinks his eyes open to see Tony standing over him, face tight in worry. He is saying something, but it takes a minute for Steve to hear it, for him to feel the way Tony is shaking his shoulders. “Steve! Steve, what is going on?”
He does not open with his father, does not so much as mention him. He does not sit down nor implore the reporters to do the same. He does not show a single shred of weakness this time, not even the slightest of micromovements for the hyenas to use when insisting this announcement is a part of his nervous breakdown. No, this time he stands straight and rigid behind a microphone with all the conviction and power of a battle worn superhero.
“What, no! No, do both.” Tony replies, huffing and crossing his arms. Vaguely he understands that he may be a little all over the place himself and really shouldn’t be holding it against Rogers for reacting to all of this nonsense. However, Tony just really really needs to talk to the guy and get him to stop feeling so lonely all the fucking time. It is depressing and Tony does not have time for it along with all the hell brought on by the shit show of the last two weeks. He is a busy busy man with his own smorgasbord of psychosis and does not need to be dealing with those of a recently thawed supersoldier.
“Go back in there, someone will have something to say about you tailing me everywhere eventually.” His best friend huffs up to protest, but Tony clasps his hand in both of his before any explosion can take place. “I’ll be okay. Obadiah will want to talk to me alone and I need you to go smooth down all the feathers my latest stunt just ruffled. I promise I will tell you if I need you.”
Tony nods, yanking off the metal glove and resolutely ignoring the shiver when his arm brushes along Steve’s abs.
“Just, let me.” He mutters, knees finally under him enough that he can get his hands out in front of him, can get his fingers to fumble at the waist of Steve’s jeans. For his part, Steve just sits and stares at him for a long minute. His chest is heaving and his hands have stilled to rest in the crook between Tony’s hips and thighs, thumbs laying just close enough to get Tony’s cock aching.
They are just looking at each other for a long while, eyes locked and stupid grins on their faces. Tony can’t quite pick out why he feels so giddy, but it can’t be all that important when Steve is running his hands slowly up and down his waist and hips. Nothing can be important when Steve is looking at him so sincerely, so soft and lovely.
Tony seems both pleased and disappointed, so she cradles the little hands in one of her own and pulls them up to her lips. With quick little bursts, she covers both in tiny smacking pecks until the little body squirms and giggles in an attempt to break away. Only then does she pull back and sweep at the dangling hair over his perfect tiny forehead. “All better, yes?”
He wants to be panicking, feels the emotion pooling somewhere behind him, but just as it starts to move forward the moment ends. Romanov signs off with Fury and turns to look at them. Stark flinches and his eyes drop and Steve feels like he can finally breathe again. The other two are speaking and Steve can not only hear but
“This one will make you feel like you’re breathing fire.” She promises and pushes the glass to Stark with a tiny grin.
Tony just nods, not even disappointed anymore. Too hallow, too wrung dry. He just wants to crawl into that bed with Steve and never wake up.
“Money. It’s always money with me sugar.” A shrug and a smile and Rhodey is sighing heavy with closed eyes. The fight is still in him, but like a good soldier it is set to simmer for the long game.
Tony remembers Rhodey mumbling about Stane being a jerk a handful of times in college. He remembers how little time they spent together, how Rhodey always kept their conversations short. But, he never thought it anything more than a clash of personalities. He always reassured Rhodey that Uncle Obie was just a brash guy. Rhodey never once said ‘I told you so’ either. God.
It takes no time at all to make his way to another staggeringly large room with more impossibly floating screens and unnamable machines that seem more fit for the science fiction book Steve loved so much as a child.
be considered kissing, but it is distance and not at all what Tony wants. “I have a test tomorrow morning, Tony.”
For all Tony loved being pressed into the wall and surrounded by every inch of Steve, this position feels just as satisfying. Steve under him, solid weight between his legs and head tilted up to meet Tony, is heady. His hands are big and solid against the sides of his waist, but Tony feels in control, feels powerful. It is his decision to tilt their heads, to collapse more and more weight into Steve, to shift his hips up and down just the slightest amount.
Steve wakes up just as the sun starts to peek into the room. He feels stiff, likely from the long battle yesterday, and a bit chilly. With a deep yawn he stretches his left arm out across the bed. For a moment he is disoriented, but upon opening his eyes he realizes the large amount of empty bed between himself and the night stand is only because he migrated completely to one side. Usually, he ends up in the exact center, sprawled to make use of all available space. With that in mind he rolls once and swipes up his phone to check the time.
“You look great.” Tony tells him, but his eyes are fixed on Steve’s face. They’ve been fixed on his face since the moment the door opened and Steve wants to do something crazy. He wants to kiss Tony right now, wants to grab his face in both his hands and press himself in close. They’ll fit together perfectly, he knows Tony’s facial hair will prickle against his own freshly shaved skin, remembers the tingle of it. He wants to experience it for real though, wants to put a solid focus to that memory, that maybe premonition.
“Here lies Rhodey Rhodes Rhodebear.” Tony immediately recites, bowing his head in a mockery of prayer that Rhodey can only make out from the corner of his eye. “He was a terrible friend, I don’t miss him.” A nudging of a foot into Rhodey’s side punctuates the statement. When he only responds with a grunt, Tony adds. “At all.”
“Like, seriously?! I know postage probably seems crazy expensive now, but I know Fury got the military to shit out a goddamn mother load of back pay for the guy so it’s not like he’s hurting for the, what? It can’t be more than five bucks to send a card, right?” Pepper gives him a withering look when he turns back to her, but he is on a roll now and just continues, arms and hands wildly gesturing. “Plus, I gave him my number! Hotels have phones! SHIELD had to have given him a cell phone!”
They’d finished running through a layer of contracts for the coming year, something Stark approached with a ruthless thoroughness that still shocked her at times. When the man suddenly flipped the light switch of his personality and demanded to know her prowess with mixed drinks, she’d happily insisted he allow her to show him some of her favorites. Now, six of her most elaborate shot concoctions later, the man was treating the living room like a five star club, loud rhythmic music and low lighting included.
“It’s okay. We all have our faults.” Steve continues, eager to get a fuller laugh. He just knows it will be a beautiful sound. “You can’t be a genius billionaire playboy philanthropist and a good coffee drinker too. It would be unfair.”
“Where are we going?” Tony asks with a laugh, letting himself settle into Steve’s side. They fit so smoothly, latching together like pieces of his armor, designed precisely to walk like this. It hurts somewhere deep and broken, but Tony can’t help but think it every time they press together; can’t help but remember how perfectly whole he felt with Steve inside him.
Tony isn’t sure where exactly this is going, can’t think much past the feeling of Steve’s huge hands finally, fucking finally, cuping each cheek and pressing just enough that Tony feels poised for direction.
That also ignores the list of things he can not find anywhere. He is missing several pairs of underwear, a good dozen T-shirts and two pairs of jeans. His old straight blade razor is also nowhere to be found for three solid days, but reappears the morning of the fourth cleaned like it is brand new. Also, his favorite blanket seems to have evaporated in the wash, because even a thorough search of the common floors comes up empty. It, unlike the razor, stays missing even after he asks JARVIS to assist him.
“Surprise?” Tony asks with a chuckle, then grunts and hunches forward into a coughing fit. Without thinking, Steve anchors him and starts running his hands down the side of the chest plate. There are catches there, exactly where he knew they would be and it feels like the ring all over again. His fingers know exactly how to press them. Tony never even told him these catches existed.
The next hours are filled to the brim with things so out of this world it makes whatever the hell is happening with him and Stark seem like a quiet stroll through the park. There are aliens, ones that look more like what the word should invoke than Thor or Loki. There is fighting and screaming and Steve feels completely centered in the way only harsh battle ever allows. Stark is everywhere, landing exactly when Steve needs him and they are stunning together. They are a unit, breaking away and flowing back together with an ease unlike anything Steve has ever felt. The other Avengers fall in step alongside them and the nostalgia of teammates cannot take over before Steve is thrust back into the whirlwind all around them.
“You’re different.” Steve finally finishes with, taking a long swallow of his juice to keep from expanding on that sentiment. It seems like an especially good decision when he realizes Stark is looking at him with wide and outrageously hopeful eyes. It makes him both want to run from the room and open his mouth to say something profound, something worthy of that gaze. Of course, because he really wasn’t kidding when he told Stark he is terrible at talking to people, he decides to ruin the mood instead. “Besides, I remember mucking it up well enough at first.”
“The other ones I want you to scan in, then sort the timeline entries in order of occurrence and split into subcategories for Banner, Romanoff, Barton, Thor, Rogers, and SHIELD. For anything not mentioning those categories set in a personal directory split in whatever way makes the most sense to you.” Tony continues, voice beginning to slur with the comfort of the whirling machines all around him. The light behind his eyes begins to dim, but he does not bother thanking Jarvis.  “I’m sure it goes without saying, but all of these are of the highest security rating. They should only be held on my personal servers behind the absolute most stunning firewall and encryption your little heart can come up with.”
“Sure.” She tells him and his smile softens, before it catches on a thought she can’t see and the moment is broken. The cloud is back and that secret suddenly bursts into view just behind his back and she remembers why she can’t just walk over to him and kiss him for hours and hours.
“Never.” Steve hisses, arms pulling Tony too tight, but he relishes the feel of the reactor digging into his sternum, the feel of his body tucked into his arms. Tony shivers, but he doesn’t flinch or try to wriggle free and Steve thinks he needs it just as much. Needs it more.
“You are hilarious.” The instant switch to sarcasm is so fucking wonderful Tony half wants to propose. Jesus fuck.
Tony looks like the cat that caught the canary every time he glances up to find Steve grinning at him like a fool. Steve thinks he should always look like that. It makes him flush, makes him duck his head and cough into his fist, but that only seems to make Tony happier. It’s ridiculous how easy everything feels. Steve knew the talking would come easy, knew there would never come a time when he couldn’t find something to joke around about with Tony. The soft glances though, the little grins and the bumping of their feet under the table, that he never really considered. He could picture kissing Tony, could picture it before all the strange memories even started. He never anticipated how looking down to see Tony’s hand resting on the table would look like such a blatant invitation though.
“I have the serum.” And he sounds happy enough, but the lack luster turn to both their moods is undeniable. Biting on the end of his pen again, Tony decides to just be his usual obnoxious self. It usually works with Pepper and Rhodey. Hell, it usually works with just about anyone Tony decides needs a good laugh at his expense, just so happens those are the only two people he ever feels inclined to share such a thing with. Well, and Bruce too lately. And isn’t that nice, four people Tony would gladly be an idiot for, four whole people he wouldn’t mind calling friends. Even if Rogers most certainly wouldn’t return the sentiment, even if they have known each other for all of three conversations. The nice thing about feelings is you get to have them for who ever the hell you want and they can’t say a goddamn thing about it.
The clean up takes hours and even though a handful of SHIELD agents tell him they really can handle it on their own, Steve stays through all of it. Natasha must take care of Iron Man, because no one but the other Avengers seem to know anything about the reveal and Steve does not see him in any of the med vehicles. It itches at the back of his head, but the horrid stench of the now blue tinted tan slime provides enough distraction to prevent more than that.
Tony is becoming a bit of a problem in Steve’s life even without the unreal recollections. By problem, Steve of course means the best damn part of it, but the classification feels completely justified. They are spending more and more time together, more than they ever did when Tony was restricted to in his armor. Almost everyday Steve finds himself walking down to the workshop with a box of pizza or little white containers of chinese food. He spends hours down there, both sketching while Tony works and watching movies together on a tattered couch shoved in the far corner.
“Noted, now get going baby.” Tony pulls the door closed over Pepper’s lap once she slides inside. Rhodey gives the tinted window a dirty look, but does turn back to the building soon enough. Happy waits and seems ready to speak, but Tony cuts him off by ordering them to go see the arc reactor.
“No one can ever know you did this. No one can know, Tonino.” She finally says, forcing calm even while her body still trembles. “You can never touch it again. Giammai.”
“I have been in captivity for months.” Tony bites out, really wanting to skip over all this nonsense and to the point where he is home with a company that no longer makes weapons and an Obadiah that no longer exists. “I think I have a right to a press conference if I want one.”
It takes longer for him to start up this time, but she stays silent. He wants to talk about this, she realizes with a bit of a start. It’s something weighing in on him and it may have nothing to do with the palladium, but it is heavy. Possibly heavier, if the sinking of his shoulders is anything to go by. Stark may value is life beneath most things, but it is startling to think there could be any secret more ominous than his poisoning. “When I was leaving, the suit’s flame thrower jammed.”
“Get some rest.” He tells him, letting himself pat his shoulder once before turning to the door. He decides not to look back, but calls out before entering the hallway, “I’ll see you in the morning.”
“Oh fuck, shit.” Tony says a little stunned and Peppers watches his rather dull response with horror. Then something seems to click and Tony is flicking off the torch and sprinting towards the sink on the far wall. Shit!” He yells while yanking the hose extension out and violently turning the faucet. “Dummy, what the hell?! There is actual fire happening and you are taking a god damn nap?!” He screeches and Pepper is stuck where she stands, completely unable to move as the bot perks up and rushes forward at Tony with a fire extinguisher. Tony turns to him and asks in entirely too calm a voice, “seriously? No, you are too late!”
“Workshop. I need to, To– Mr. Stark needs to. I just have to go.” And then the doors are opening and he is stepping inside. They close and Iron Man doesn’t even look back.
“Baby, I love when you get all caveman for me, but we got to do this right.” With a small and light voice, Tony moves to stand next to Rhodey and place a hand on the tight muscles of his shoulder. The man reels on him, but only to clutch at Tony’s shoulders in turn.
“I was thinking about getting a cup of coffee.” Tony tells him and manages to squirm around to face Steve. He giggles at the grumpy little pout on Steve’s face.
“Oh, really?” Tony is wide eyed, face bright and so hopeful Steve can’t help but beam back at him. This only brings more light to the genius’ face and he laughs before adding, “awesome. I was thinking we could go to this little Italian place a few blocks down.”
“Awesome.” Tony beams, it’s ridiculous how much he smiles these days. Something is bound to be sprained at this rate and he can’t honestly get himself to mind.
“Yes, Captain. It is your prefered blend.” JARVIS responds smoothly and Steve can make out the smell of it from the archway between the kitchen and living room. It seems JARVIS picked up on some silent queue from Steve’s body, because the coffee smells like the best idea ever.
“No, it’s fine. I get it.” Tony replies after a pause. His voice is light, choppy. When Steve looks up, Tony is staring at his fingernails and his face is so completely blank the face plate might as well still be on. “Not exactly what you were expecting, ” he continues with a vague gesture to himself and snaps his eyes up. They are cold, hardening as he lifts his chin and squares his shoulders. It makes Steve coil, makes some of his own shame and guilt abate. Then Tony’s hand spasms in his and Steve’s eyes snap down to them. There is the tiniest tremor there, the tips jerking up and down like Tony wants to let go and start tapping them but wants to hold on tighter too.
It takes a second, but Steve realizes he is laughing, giggling more like, at the thought. He looks up at himself in the mirror and for a second he can’t recognize the face. It’s the youngest he’s looked in years, smile bright and cheeks flushed pink with the excitement. It makes him laugh harder and he can’t actually understand how happy he feels.
The uncertainty of how a women dead for over two decades manages such a feat is what keeps Natasha from writing it up in her final analysis of Stark. At least, that is the unbiased reason she tells Fury later, when a certain discovery off the coast of Greenland pulls everything out into the light.
Spinning to face him again, Rhodey gives him a startled yet unsurprised look. He really puts too much stock in Tony’s ability to puzzle everything out, way more than he ever deserved.
Honestly, if Tony knew taking that Calculus TA position would lead here, he might have taken a little longer to think the offer over. If he could have seen the class roster, somehow known that this blond adonis would come to his office hours week one and absolutely turn his life upside down, he would have at least read the course syllabus before shrugging and saying “Fine, whatever.” He can’t live like this, can’t take it, something is going to give out and it just might be his heart at this point.
“And you think they stayed in contact after.” Not a question. Rhodey’s jaw tightens, anger building under his skin.
Of course there is the pile of lifeless steel poking out from the sand like icebergs from a dry sea, but that is not what catches Tony’s breath. A few feet away and to the right is a sprawled body in tattered dress pants and an offcentered welders mask.
Then Stark is holding a nuke over his body and flying headlong into the portal that Romanov begins to shut.
Tony jolts a little when he nearly slams his nose into Steve’s neck, but instead of backing up he just lifts his eyes to meet Steve’s.
“Yeah.” Tony says and something about his tone pulls Steve back up from the pad. He is still looking at the screen, but there's no focus in his eyes. It may as well be a window for all he is looking straight through it. “It’s really good, you’ll love it.” He continues, but his voice wavers on the last few words and something wet is catching at the edges of it.
“Come to bed, Tony.” Steve tells him in the same gentle tone he used to direct Tony through preparing dinner, After everything his name shouldn’t make his eyes sting so badly.
Steve smiles, bright and stunning and Tony could almost cry about it. Before he can get too worked up though, Steve drops down, taking his weight onto his elbows and collapsing all along Tony’s body. It yanks a gasp out of Tony’s throat, makes him suddenly light headed and blurry eyed. God, Steve is so heavy and he is so hard and he is so completely covering him.
“Captain, are you alright? Your breathing is elevated and your heart rate is well outside normal bounds.” JARVIS calls out and Steve jumps. The box falls to the ground and Steve dives after it without thinking. Luckily, the ring stays snug in its seat, but Steve is now on his hands and knees holding a tiny box that should not exist.
“Screw you too, Capslock.” He meant to infuse a bit more sarcasm, but it comes out just a few notches under fond. He wants to panic about that, wants to reel it in, but Rogers seems so fucking pleased by it he can’t gather the energy.
Steve doesn’t say anything and Tony leaves the room. The glass bottle is heavy in his hand, harsh where it knocks against his thigh. Giving into temptation, he lifts it up as he reaches the stairway and opens it for a swig. “Bevilo tutto, bevilo tutto” He sings to himself, smile empty, “che buon prò ti possa fare.”
Even as he thinks it though, he knows it isn’t the core of the issue. Sure it seems wrong to have found it out by accident, to have stolen the confession without consent. Yet, there is more, something too shivering to be rage, something hurt and unsure.
Maria Stark first thinks her son carries the curse when he is four years old. She sits in the library, flipping uselessly through an old book and sipping on her fifth glass of wine. The world is starting to fuzz around the edges in a pleasant sleepy sort of way that eases her mind into a blessed silence. Dragging a deep red nail up the length of the tattered page, she hooks it lightly and flips without having a single idea of the information on the previous one. She moves to repeat the soothing rhythm after another swallow of rich red when a loud insistent clattering thunders in from somewhere in the hallway.
“You’re a real piece of work, you know that?” Tony half sobs into Steve’s bare chest, hating himself and loving this man so much he could crawl out of his own skin if it meant he could be closer, just a little bit closer. Steve’s arms tighten, his breath shakes and shudders out of him and he presses his face into the top of Tony’s head. They fit so smoothly, latching together, designed precisely to live like this.
Itching for movement despite the ache and exhaustion rolling off him in unrelenting waves, Tony trails his fingers along the lower seem on his mattress. The uniformity and neatness reassures him as much as anything could in this place. Tucked deep in the musty and crumpling stuffing behind those stitches is a stack of papers not even Yinsen knows about.
“Do you think, if you’re free I mean...” Tony starts, still in that same nervous tone. Then he shifts and takes in a deep breath. Steve always marvels this ability to shift from one tone to another so seamlessly. It is something he saw hints of with Iron Man, but the full power Tony has over his mannerisms can be staggering at times. It feels like a privilege to ever see him unguarded. His eyes are back on Steve and his smile is all friendly nonchalance. “Do you want to go for dinner tonight?”
“Yes, Steve. Baby, please don’t stop. Don’t stop. It’s so good, you’re so good.” Tony says between desperate open mouth kisses, though he can’t honestly tell what any of the words mean. He just hopes he’s getting some idea of how fucking amazing this all is across to Steve. Because it is, it is so amazing and he doesn't want it to ever stop. “I’m so close honey, baby, I’m so... please don’t stop.”
“Yeah, we could keep kissing.” Tony agrees and starts to lean in to punctuate is agreement, but he catches the heavy bob in Steve’s throat and rushes to reassure him. “Just kissing. I’ll be better about, well–”
“I stayed up every night just looking at that ring you know.” Steve tells him, trailing and hand down his left arm to catch his hand. He pulls it up to his lips and presses a kiss into the skin above his third knuckle. “For days, I just sat on the bed and flipped it open and closed.”
“Tony! We were going to meet at the hospital.” Obadiah bellows and moves in with arms open. Rhodey shifts them both just enough to prevent what surely would have been a skin crawling embrace.
“I’ve got to look. He doesn’t have his shield. If he’s hurt... There’s no way for the man to navigate in this storm. He’ll die out there.” The last sentence cuts, feels chewed raw in his mouth, all glass shards and spikes. He turns to the cutout in the corner, charges up the boots.
“You sure?” The man calls out after him, reaching an arm out and moving to follow. Tony waves him off firmly and shoots over his shoulder, “Yes and sorry for not warning you about this next bit.” He ignores the “What, Tony?” called after him and moves up to the stage with forced steady steps. Obadiah moves away to give him room behind the podium, which Tony fills without so much as a glance towards the man.
That too was short lived and now here he stood, alone in his destroyed home and completely past the point of panic. Seemed somehow his brain actually managed to process everything on the back burner. Now, he just feels exhausted and weary for the days to come.
“It didn’ hurt.” And now a perfect little pout fills the boy’s cheeks with air and Maria’s heart with a dizzying adoration. “The water- the water huuurts.”
They can sit in the same room, not even speaking and Tony can’t keep the smile off his face. Rhodey’s taken to calling him a lovesick fool whenever they skype and Tony can’t even defend himself. Every day is better, every hour is brighter and is this why people date each other? He never got it, would watch his parents argue and throw things and honestly not understand why people subjected themselves to it.
They find a few hard vegetables and some dried packets of broth along with a pot large enough to prepare a stew. Steve talks him through every part of it, from the way to chop the onion to how long the potatoes will need to cook; his voice a calm and steady rhythm as Tony works. While the pot simmers Tony cuts some hard meats and cheeses he found and layers them up on a plate. Sometimes between browning the onion and peeling the carrots, Steve stretched himself out on the bed and his eyes are closed when Tony turns around to bring his offering.
“Nope, I’m all good. Just peachy honestly.” Tony babbles out, firmly not looking Obadiah straight on in case Rhodey’s gesture is not enough to dissuade any PDA from the man. If he notices anything odd about that behavior, he does not show any outward sign.
Stark headbutts Thor, the name for their current foe that Steve pulls up in correspondence to the face he'd glimpsed. If the following impact and subsequent free fall backwards is anything to go by, Stark's move did little more than upset the 'God'. Somehow, the man stops himself from crashing into anything behind him and instead starts gliding forward quickly. Flight is decidedly the most surreal thing to feel without the sight to put the weightlessness into context. Fists are being thrown now, punctuated by what must be Thor's own fists rattling the casing Steve can just barely feel surrounding Stark's body. The suit absorbs most of what he can only assume would be rather harsh jabs, but the way it vibrates Starks' skin is not at all pleasant.
He turns around and sees a figure making its way in through the shattered window. “I can’t believe you didn’t tell me.” He whispers, not really needing Tony to hear it because he knows the intensity of his disbelief cannot be understood. He needs to see Bruce, needs him to look at his blood and say there is something wrong, tell him what on earth is going on.
Trying to curl in on himself for warmth, he feels a tug in the center of his chest and reevaluates. Maybe this should be the eternal flame, a tethered hole in his chest and a red ledger he’ll never get the chance to wipe away. Seems he’ll never do enough penance, though that is not a surprise. He wants to roll and fall and let that hole rip open and away.
“So, how’s Nebraska?” He eventually asks, after clearing his throat to sound stern. Rogers relaxes at his easy tone, a comfort to him that Tony hasn’t felt since they split ways. The tether aches a little less.
When the water trickle on the cave’s floor fades into focus once more, he lays there for a second longer than last time before yanking the tube out. He doesn’t bother reaching for the water this time, just lets the coughs rattle through him as his hands clench. His breath is heavy, but he can still make out Yinsen humming and if he has to spend eternity in this place at least there is that.
“Steve?” Tony’s voice breaks the atmosphere and suddenly Steve realizes he’s walked all the way to the side of the bed without realizing. They are uncomfortably close, Tony’s shoulder could press right into his stomach if the man shifted right even the smallest amount. Tony sleeps on the side Steve keeps finding empty when he wakes up.
Steve looks at him, some sadness pulling down on his face the longer he examines Tony’s offer. Before the tension builds to a point where Tony will have no choice but to chug the entire thing just to fill the silence, Steve stands up from the bar. In one smooth movement he takes the glass, sets it back behind him and pulls Tony to standing.
They talk for another four hours and Tony goes to bed feeling more at peace with the world than he has since Afghanistan. If he hadn’t fallen asleep nearly ten seconds after making it horizontal there might have been a little more freaking out about that particular thought.
With Steve though, Tony wants to fill up his entire day with his presence. He goes on movie dates with him, actual real paying attention to the plot and sharing a popcorn, movie dates. He sits in a dark room with the guy for several hours and feels no need to try for more than resting his head on his shoulder. They sit in the second row, Steve eats the entire bag of twizzlers before the previews finish, Tony laughs and it’s so perfect Tony will never be able to go to a theatre without him.
“What?” All the anger is gone now, replaced with an exhausted confusion. It is a good thing this look is so nice on her because he has a feeling this is going to become a standard expression in the years to come.
He can make out a faint trail in the trees where they've been disturbed by the men before him, but he does not use that to direct his movements. The pull is still strong, but as he free falls in his precise arc it eases just the smallest amount. When he pulls the chute open, it is nothing to yank at the rope on either side to steer him along the line between them. He is still in the air when he feels Stark collide with something not unlike a brick wall. Yet, the wall must give since Stark stands back without a ricochet such collision would require. Then Stark's face is cooled by a brush of air and it takes a moment, in which Steve tries to understand what the man might be saying using just the feel of a tongue against teeth, for Steve to realize it means the face plate must have pulled up.
Pepper watches the exchange, clearly aware there is some story she is missing but does not comment when Rhodey deflates and steps away from the car. “I don’t like your plan, I told you eight times on the way here how much I hate the plan. You pulled this just so I would have to go deal with all the shit it is going to cause, didn’t you?”
“Iron Man is unharmed.” JARVIS cuts in before Steve can ramble himself into a full panic. It does little to stop his momentum though and he makes it out his door and into the elevator foyer in quick steps. However, before he can press his thumb into the digital elevator keypad, the screen goes black and Steve jerks his head up in incredulity.
The order drinks, or rather Tony orders them drinks. Tony orders the appetizers too and when the waiters comes by with them he orders their entries as well. Some part of Steve wants to protest, wants to insist that Tony is going a little overboard with the gentlemen act and that he can certainly open his own door and order his own meals. Most of him is so outrageously charmed by the silly gestures that he can’t make himself stop smiling long enough to really take a good sip of the wine.
“You gonna stop me?” Stark bites back, shoving Steve’s hand off his shoulder. It might not be pure anger Steve is feeling, but it is certainly the easiest emotion to be dealing with right now. He is back ready to push this man down and down and under him. Ready to force some sense into him with fist and fury.
They never really got past their terrible introduction, only managing pleasantries and shop talk. Steve always tries to keep a cool head around him, thankful for the aid and resources he freely provides the team. Admittedly, he could have done a better job, but even with two years of living in the same building they simply never interact enough to build up much of a rapport. It may be time to really work on that. “It’s been pretty quiet otherwise, so I’ve even managed a bit of time for sketching.”
The suit is tucked up behind hanging chains and under a pitch black shadow in the largest blind spot the camera angles allowed. Tony lets his eyes rove over the bulky frame, not quite able to prevent the memories of what Obadiah could turn it into from blinking menacingly in his mind’s eye. He kept most of the exterior identical to mach U1.1, only bulking out the lower legs and forearms to add in longer flight and stabilization. The weight will be a bit more significant for that, no way to avoid it with only iron and copper alloys available. He dreads the strain on his shoulders and knees, but the crude auxiliary joins will come online after the first movement and he will be able to push through. Even if the thing crashes, it will get them out far enough and this time he knows exactly how long it will take for the rescue.
There is always this angry bundle in his nerves whenever Iron Man goes off on a mission by himself. At least with Clint and Natasha he knows SHIELD usually sends them off together or with a group of other agents. Iron Man always goes alone and it feels wrong in just about every way possible. Steve is his partner, they fight alongside each other, lead the Avengers together. It makes him itch whenever he can’t be of assistance, when he is no better than benched. Stark never allows it though, and Steve has tried many times. He promised to sign any non-disclosure agreements, just about begged Iron Man to talk some sense into his boss. In the end though he respected Iron Man's choice for secrecy and Stark’s right to decide his employees responsibilities. “Well, okay. Tell Shellhead good luck for me will ya, JARVIS?”
“Name a single thing you are bad at?” Stark demands, leaning forward to poke Steve in the chest. It sends a pleasant zing straight down to his toes and he has to physically restrain himself from reaching out to grasp Stark’s hand. It feels wrong not to, but the idea of just leaning forward is so ludicrous Steve loses a bit of his easy mirth.
When they finish and Maria Hill herself tells Steve to get his ass back to the tower, however, the thoughts are too numerous to count. He wants to go find Tony and make sure he is alright. He wants to find Natasha, demand she tell him how long she knew and to list every person privy to the knowledge. He wants to scream because as close as he and Iron Man were, the intensity of his anger makes no sense.
“The one and only,” He answers, ignoring the way the air bites into his face, how his throat burns as he breaths it in. Nothing matters, not with Steve’s eyes locked on to him, looking at him like every good thing in the world exists in Tony’s face. The focus is off, Steve only just started shaking for warmth, but somehow Tony feels pierced through.
“Well you obviously haven’t smelt me after a long training session.” Steve shoots back, a wry smile on his lips. Instead of laughing or responding in any way Steve expects, Stark inhales his coffee with a sharp breath. He immediately starts coughing, cheeks flushing red from the strain. Jumping up, Steve hurries around the table to pat and rub soothing circles into Stark’s back. “Are you alright?”
“You are doing just fine right now.” Stark reassures, eyes flicking down and back up to glance at Steve from under his lashes. It is blatantly flirtatious, but in a softer way than Steve has ever seen from the man.
“What? Rock of Ages giving up so easily?” Steve knows he is smirking before turning to see it, knows the tautness of the fake beaming before making out the tense furrow of Starks left eyebrow. The reference makes no sense, but the way Stark glances at the prisoner gives Steve enough context to make due.
There is no time to deal with yet another terrible truth of this empty future, as Romanov and Thor enter. Things dissolve so suddenly, Steve feels almost outside of his own body. They are all yelling, fighting against each other in random turns. Every bad thing Starks says, every tense angle on him seems to feed back into Steve and it loops and rackets higher and higher. They all are spiraling in uneven arcs, thrashing against every one of their uneven edges. Yet, all his focus, his entire body, feels consumed and drawn to Stark. He wants to punch this man, wants to push him against a wall and make him listen, wants to put him on his knees, wants him to resist it and still come out on top. He feels them both stand taller and taller, look down their noses at one another, feels ready to press forward.
“Fine,” Tony replies, confusion leaking into every inch of the word. Honestly, if Steve had wanted to know how he held up after being rammed into, not only his couch and coffee table, but also the bed, the question really was coming in absurdly late. He looks Steve over with a raised eyebrow, feeling himself smirk at the awkward shuffling of the super soldiers feet. “Alright, Cap. How about a drink?”
“I can hold my breath for something like eight minutes.” Tony turns to look at him for that, because honestly that might be the most bizarre segway he’s ever heard and he is the king of random segways. That or the most out of the blue come on and really Tony needs to actually get
“Schedules are always better when you are ahead of them.” Tony shrugs and lets his arms fall apart and rest limply at his sides. Smiling just a little brighter, Yinsen stands to retrieve their canister of water.
The youth of the man looking back at him adds a layer he want to smachk himself for not considering. For a loud and proud atheist, he really jumped on that eternal life concept with fervour. Catholicism is one persistent bitch.
“How was the trip to Hong Kong?” Comes out of his mouth and both he and Stark look at each other in surprise at the outburst. Just a few moments ago Steve had been ready to ask where he’d been all of last week, but just before that question formed he remembered the answer. A few days before leaving, they were sat on the couch in the adjacent living room, sharing a bowl of popcorn and watching something in the long list of movies Steve needed to catch up on.
“Yeah.” Steve agrees, though to what Tony has absolutely no idea. It can’t matter though, not when Steve’s arm is so tight around him, not when his muscles are tensing against Tony’s back. Certainly not when his other hand slips off Tony’s neck and down to cup his ass. “Let me just…”
Hawkeye tries a couple exploding arrows, but after watching four of them sink into the gooey bodies as they expand around the delayed rattle of the explosion, he joins Widow in civilian rescue. Steve stays close to Iron Man, using his shield to magnify his repulsors. They manage two takedowns in a row with this method alongside well timed blasts of lightning from Thor just before the mounds can seal themself back up. Bruce is assisting shield on the perimeter as it is clear Hulk’s skill set might not be appreciated for this fight.
Somewhere in the distance he hears Hulk roar as a resounding clap of thunder shakes the entire block. None of it matters though, because Iron Man is down and seems to have slammed straight through one building and most of the way through another.  Steve scales the windows, swinging from one ledge to another in rapid succession and runs headlong through the hole left by Iron Man’s body. He picks up speed and jumps through one shattered window and into the next building.
“Shame,”Steve says and something in his eyes lets Tony know he can smell the cover up. “You’ve got such a nice set.”
“Oh, have you been in here before?” A voice calls out and he looks up, startled to find an older woman with three large flowers sticking out of her messy grey hair. She is near paper thin, but looks warm and inviting all the same. Steve’s stomach rolls and not just because of how underdressed he feels in his already sweaty workout gear. Her name is Anna and Steve remembers her fat orange tabby cat that lives on the staircase behind the counter.
He looks down and away and it breaks her heart a little to know there are still things he keeps from her. After everything, he still holds so much of himself away from the world. His forefinger and thumb rub together from inside his thick welders gloves before he flips on the torch and points it at the metal. She wants to say something, wants to pull him back to their light joking. Wants him to know that she is always here, no matter what else is thrown at them, no matter if they never learn to love each other in any different way than they do now. Instead she looks back down at her papers, shuffles them at bit more and pulls up all the professional walls that serve her so well at the male dominated board meetings.
“Alright.” And it takes all of her strength to hold back another sigh. “I only came down to give you these.” She puts the stack of papers on the desk and ignores the way his entire face shuts off at her professional voice and smile. “I need them signed by tonight. Natalie will come get them.” He flinches a bit at that last part and she knows it’s cowardice, no matter how necessary. “I have a meeting in thirty minutes.”
In the end they take his word that Yinsen will be fully endorsed by S.I. as a consulting engineer and sign off to have him transferred to the very best medical facilities in So.Cal. They keep him in an induced coma throughout the trip and won’t answer Tony’s insistent questions, but the relief at hearing the heart monitor’s continual beeping goes a long way. Rhodey lets him sit next to the other man’s bed the entire time anyways.
The other little quirks of her cursed baby do not escape her notice, but at least all of those are easily explained away or ignored by everyone else. If Tony whines and shivers extra in the harsh New York winters, Jarvis only buys him thicker and more expensive coats and gloves. If Tony insists on taking baths just shy of scolding, Maria simply tells everyone it is the Italian blood longing for Mediterranean summers. If Tony guards his favorite toys with a too terrible ferocity, well no one really expects a Stark child to be immune to materialism.
“Maybe someone else left them there?” Iron Man hedges, lifting his shoulders high and dropping them in an approximation of a shrug. The same strange hesitance is still in his voice and Steve feels less than reassured.
Stark nods, and Steve isn’t sure if watching his movements makes feeling them any better. “Still, you were pretty spry, for an older fellow. What’s your thing? Pilates?”
Every single person is shouting, but Tony simply turns and walks right off the stage and out the door without another word.
Getting back out of the car takes just as stupidly long, but this time they have the excuse of conversation to blame. Tony is arguing about some sitcom Steve’s never seen and Steve is disagreeing with him on everypoint just to see the furrow between his brow get deeper and deeper. They’ve been sitting in the parked car for nearly ten minutes when Tony stops talking and turns to look at him with the most exaggerated expression of betrayal Steve’s ever seen.
"It was really dark and so cold. I–" A deep breath in and Steve shudders– shivers –a bit as he lets it out. Tony presses impossibly closer, wishing furiously the poor circulation from the arc reactor did not make his fingertips too cold. "I know I'm not there anymore. I know it, but it's just so cold." Another shiver, but it is more subdued and Steve is resting his head on top of Tony’s and pulling their joined hands into his lap to clasp in his other.
He is gonna die. He knows this with a certainty that leaves little room for fear. He’s really gonna die this time. After everything. After the literal shit storm of the past eight years. Hell, the last forty six years if he wants to play up the whole ‘ready to bite the dust’ thing. He is going to die alone in his workshop, nothing but his own carelessness to blame, and honestly the relief is not as much a surprise as a comfort.
"Tony, you don't–" Steve starts to say, even as he lifts up one hip and allows the blankets to unfurl.
“God, Pep. I don’t even fucking know.” He lands on eventually, slumping forward to prob his elbows up and rest his chin on his palms. “It is so completely insane I don’t think there are words in any language capable of explaining.”
Tony lets out a sigh like it was the only thing keeping his body upright and takes one hand away to begin gesturing wildly with it. “And can I just say the level of shock I got for that was really uncalled for, do these people think my suit is just a shell that I rattle around in? Like, come on people, of course I built in shock absorbers. Why on earth would I spend so much time in it if it wasn’t actually going to protect me from shit like that? It is seriously insulting, I can’t-”
“This whole last week, I don’t know, I just have this gut feeling that something is wrong.” Again that feels too simple, doesn’t capture the way the whole world feels tilted like Steve is stuck staring through a fun house mirror.  “I wake up and my room is too quiet, I keep finding all these weird little things in my room. And I know they aren’t mine and I can’t remember how they got there, but they also feel like they belong somehow.”
“And you’re gonna rectify that, being the good team captain and all?” It comes out a little biting, but Tony thinks they both need that, a little sting before they can make the same mistakes again. His voice gets a little bit louder and he lets his arm drop from where it had settled on Steve’s waist. “Can’t have a old drunk billionaire ruining this sacred day!”
Without looking up, Tony responds, “can I, well, I wanted to ask you something?” He is all but scuffing his toe into the floor and Steve chuckles a bit at the nervous gesture. Something about it makes him feel more at ease.
“Enough questions!” Tony announces and turns back to the car. “Come on Happy, get the door. What on earth am I paying you for?”
Four days after his last conversation with Iron Man, he walks into the communal kitchen and sees Tony Stark sitting over a tablet and coffee mug. It is odd to see him here in the middle of the day, usually Stark flows in and out of the area at times both too late and too early to be called morning or night. He looks exhausted, back curled over and gaze hazy on the glowing screen. There is no steam rising from the mug and Steve cranes up a bit to see it is nearly empty.
“Tony, I can’t just stay here all night.” Steve tells him, but he doesn’t sound even half convinced of that fact himself. His voice is gravelly, rough and catching at the edges. It pours like hot molasses down Tony’s body and he feels sticky sweet with the rumbling texture of it.
“I can’t imagine Captain America had anything less than a hundred offers to spend his Christmas at a warm fire with a nice ‘dame’ or two,” He keeps his voice sharp, tries harder than he has on anything since Extremus, since SHEILD fell, to keep his body from depending on Steve to stand. They’ve made it to the private elevators now, the ones that will take them up to the Avengers only floors. “Gonna tuck me in for the night and go find that new bird friend of yours for a game of mario kart?”
Steve’s answering smile is part bashful, part mischief and all stunningly beautiful and Tony just wants to bask. He wants to stand here in the common living room and shiver as Steve hooks a finger through his belt loop, wants to tilt forward and brush their chests together, wants to kiss him here in the bright daylight where anyone could find them.
The sitting room is just as he left it, but again there is a strange atmosphere lingering in the shadows. Before he can analyze it fully though, the soft rhythm of his song is interrupted by Jarvis letting him know the coffee is finished brewing.
"Shit." The serum was something of beauty sure, over all something stunningly amazing. Certainly a memory like that was a blessing more often than not, but Tony feels himself suddenly wishing for someway to eliminate that particular side effect. He shuffles closer to Steve, pressing his check into the hard bone of the other man’s shoulder.
Because, see the issue with Steve has absolutely nothing to do with his outrageously stunning looks. Alright, it has a good deal to do with it, Tony can admit that, but it is certainly not the core problem. If Steve was just a pair of huge biceps and some rockin’ abs, Tony would have gotten his one and done, well, done some time ago. It’s not like Steve is the most attractive person Tony’s ever–
“It’s late.” Steve mutters from far away, but he’s leaning forward, down down down, to press his lips into the side of Tony’s neck. That is, wow, that is so much better than kissing Steve’s jaw. He is gentle, soft and sweet with his light sucking kisses. He takes his time, drags his lips up the length of Tony’s carotid and bites down where it meets his jaw. God, no wonder Steve let out such a great huff of air. Tony can feel his own leeking out, a high pitched thing dragged up right along with it.
“You have no idea what show I am even talking about, do you?” Tony shouts and Steve laughs harder, free hand pressing into his chest as he bends forward. Tony’s own laugh joins in and Steve turns to take it all in, to savor the happiness etched into every inch of his face.
“I have a test.” Steve replies and it sounds like a question, like he can’t even remember anymore. Tony can relate, he isn’t even sure what day of the week it is, couldn’t tell the time if his life depended on it. His lips are tingling and almost sore from all the attention. It’s a damn shame they can’t stay like this all the time. “Plus, your feet will get sore if we stand here all night.”
Tony’s hands join Yinsen’s, uselessly trying to press in on the multitude of wounds. Dammit dammit dammit. The blood is drizzling out and if Tony never sees a machhine gun again it will be so unbelievably too soon. God, he really did not want to live in that cave again.
They both look around, frantically, as Tony waves his brilliant deep red and gold hand in some attempt to have the air cool it. Rhodey manages to spot the small kitchen sink behind said waving hand and yanks Tony’s arm to guide him over to it.
A choking noise crawls its way out of Tony’s throat and he presses a hand to his mouth to hold it in. They sit like that, Tony at Steve’s feet and Steve turned away from him all the same. The air feels alive, some creeping thing that presses in all around them.
The comforts are little, but with them she slips from gala to party all fall and spring without too many fits of panic. When Tony comes home for the Christmas breaks, she bundles him in hot blankets, tells him she loves him and drinks enough wine to not worry about the red flush of his cheeks when they both sit too close to the fire place.
“Don’t care.” Tony rushes out. His voice is so breathy, if he had half a mind left to spare he would clear his throat. Instead, he tips forwards, leans up on his toes and bumps his mouth against the line of Steve’s jaw. It’s a little stubble-y, a little rough and so sensually wonderful Tony can’t help but part his lips to get a little kitten lick of it.
“Fixing a, well-” Tony begins, then looks down at the smooth metal in his hand as if the object would answer for him. “-honestly I don’t know what to call the thing. Penis plate? Crotch holder? Metal dick sling?” He glances at her on that last one and there is mirth in his eyes, but his lips are held in a flat line. Seems he’s not giving up the game either.
“Alright. Is there anything else I can do for you?” Pepper finally asks when they come to a stop at their destination. Tony opens the door and steps out, patting his pocket to make sure the recording device Pepper had given him part way through his story is there.
“Hello?” Stark says, one eyebrow arching high as Steve thrusts the coffee out in front of him to avoid burning himself. They stare at each other dumbly for longer than could possibly be necessary, then Stark looks down at the cup and relieves Steve of holding it. Another pause, and then he looks back up and nods his thanks, face blatantly confused.
"No, it's fine. It's been awhile.” Steve insists, a hand pulling out of the tight knot of fabric to run shaky through his hair. “I thought I'd gotten over it. But, well." Another deep sigh before Steve shoves his arm back into his constructed warmth to pull all of it tighter around his body. "I'm cold."
“I couldn’t get it to move and they were shooting everything and Yinsen was–” He cuts off and swallows again, turning his body just enough to nudge the empty glass back towards her. As he continues, she mixes the shot again. “It didn’t fix itself and I just, I opened my mouth. I don’t know if I was going to scream, or cry or…” The shot is set back by his elbow and he twists without acknowledging her. “And then there was fire all around me, all in the suit and pouring out of every hole and it felt. It felt so nice.”
This is going to happen, he is going to eat Il Ghiottone’s extra buttery carbonara and love it so much it’ll be the only thing he orders no matter how many times they go back. He will sit across from Tony and wear his favorite deep blue button up and black jeans and his hair will stick up too much in the front. It will be just like the hazy memory he gets every time he passes the restaurant on the street, and it will be perfect.
After that she spends more time seeking her son out, observing him as he reads through thick books with only technical diagrams for pictures or fiddles with scraps from Howard’s workshop. Often she gets so caught up in the amazing mind whirling too fast for everyone, even her husband at times, that she forgets the purpose for the observing. Forgets about the terrible curse she put on his small shoulders until she sits awake late into the night, woken by the snores of the man beside her.
Tony looks a little abashed at her tone, but quickly ties up his features into the fake smirk he’s been sporting so often as of late. “And it is lovely, but the blue just doesn’t go with my complexion.”
Natasha is Tony Stark's PA for three months before she uncovers his biggest secret. It would feel like a failure, but when she realizes not even the man himself knows, she forgives the delay. Besides, it is not like his other behaviors escaped her notice. They just took a specific conversation to culminate into the complete, and somewhat baffling, picture.
“Shrapnel in my chest. Yinsen put a electromagnet in there to keep them from, you know, killing me via deadly dance party. The car battery wasn’t going to match with my Louboutins, so I slapped this together instead.” Rhodey’s face grows more and more horrified as the words flow from Tony in a rush. His eyes alternate from Tony’s face and chest for long minutes, before he staggers and sits down next to Tony on the cot.
He turns away, ignoring his wet pants as he sits down at a stool and begins tilting the metal plate again. They both know she is lying, both know he isn’t looking at the metal at all.
He coughs and looks away, scanning the empty air behind Stark like it contains the answers to the universe. From the beginning, Steve thought Stark was an unfairly attractive man, but the level of reaction is something he honestly thought he moved past some time ago. Stark looks down at his reading again, seemingly content to let Steve be a disaster all by himself. The room seems somewhat warmer and certainly much more awkward, so Steve jumps to the first thing he can possibly think to start a conversation.
“You’re my best friend, Shellhead!” Steve cuts him off and pulls back to stand and start pacing. His skin feels too tight, he feels too full of half memories and unreality. Nothing is making sense and every bit of it centers around this, every bit of his life comes back to Tony somehow and he wants that, he wants it so bad. It makes no sense, he knows Tony never told him. Knows Iron Man never thought to share something this important with his closest friend. “How could you keep this from me? How could you act like–”
He still lays in the bed, covered over by piles of wool, but his uniform is laying wet and discarded on the floor. Tony hates himself for feeling disappointed for missing the disrobing. The air feels charged in someway as Tony trails his eyes up the outline of Steve’s form. He feels off-kilter, feels simultaneously too small and too large for this place. Everything up to this point ran lightening quick, all of it overridden by the soul crushing need to find Steve, to get him back alive.
“Are you alright?” Steve starts to slide off the couch as he asks, ready to go comfort his friend. Before he can so much as slide the pad out of his lap though, Tony is spinning in his chair and beaming so largely at him it nearly knocks Steve off the couch anyways.
It is early, but not enough for him to consider another bout of sleep. He feels decently rested and decides the sun has the right idea about rising. Another roll has him sitting up with his feet firmly on the floor. He stretches, cracks his neck and takes a second to look over the room. It feels uncomfortably quiet, so he calls out for JARVIS to start his newest playlist on low.
“I am no such thing.” He insists, grinning and shaking his head. That gets him a full bark and it warms the room more than all the sunlight from the windows behind him.
Tony is sat up, picking at the hem of his silk cream comforter. The room is expansive, but not empty. There are two massive pale wood dressers along one wall. Both have a set of glass catchall plates, the red one contains a silver watch, the money clip Steve usually sees Tony pull out and a handful of loose change. The other one is blue and empty. There are a few framed photos of the team on that dresser, but the one with red only has a photo of Tony and Rhodey looking shockingly young and a frame that lays face down.
Then Iron Man is standing, straight out of his chair in a movement so fast Steve briefly thinks he could use this level of agility in battle. Steve backs into his chair as Iron Man lurches forward, movements shaking and imprecise. Jumping up, Steve lifts his arms up to help steady him. The ring box is a far away thought. “Woah, are you okay?”
“Thank you.” Steve replies, but it sounds half strangled even to his own ears. Kindly, Steve thinks, JARVIS does not comment on it. He also says nothing when Steve decides to forgo the drink and simply head out for his run without another word.
“I missed you, too.” Steve swears and it is completely true. He missed Tony so much he could feel it clinging to him. Every hazy memory was just him missing Tony, just him trying to get himself to realize the gaping hole in his reality needed to be filled.
For a long time after pulling Tony out of the afghan dessert, Rhodey spoke very little about how long he spent searching or exactly how he managed to be the first on the scene only hours after Tony’s escape. After a particularly intense Rock Band marathon and a dozen too many Dark & Stormies those details spilled out all over the pre-sunlight blur of early morning. Tony should have been too far gone to remember the exact and excruciating details. Should have been blacked out instead of hanging on every piece of Rhodey’s sleepless weeks and skirting of the line between disobedience and conveniently located scouting missions. His hard earned alcohol tolerance came in handy at the strangest times.
“I mean, War Machine isn’t as nice as Iron Man certainly, but I can add a few bells and whistles, you guys wouldn’t even notice.” Tony keeps going, steamrolling on like Steve never made a sound, like they aren’t right this moment holding hands. His eyes are still hard, still focused on Steve’s face but the little spasms at the corners give him away.
“I thought we were gonna play some chess?” He asks and Tony simply has to roll over and bury his grin in Steve’s chest.
“Tony! The torch!” She yelps as the end of his fraying AC/DC t-shirt ignites. Tony blinks at her for a hysterical moment before flicking his eyes to the side and frowning at the fire working its way up his shoulder.
“Thank you,” Steve chokes out just as Tony turns away and it draws him up short. He turns back, knows his face looks gutted and wishes he kept the face plate down when they came inside. The pained look on Steve’s face should feel like some kind of justice, but instead it just cuts deep into Tony’s gut. Everything in him still yearns for Steve’s easy smiles, his gentle caresses and resolute care. “Thank you, for looking for me.”
"Oh." Again, like it is the only word Tony remembers. What on earth is his role here? He never even asks for help for his own unpleasant dreams, let alone helps someone else.
"I'm getting decaf, Mom." Tony responds with the same easy muscle memory, picking the cup up and taking a much too hot sip.
“Fair enough.” Iron Man gives in and he seems to make some decision to relax into the chair. His posture goes from straight and tight to something as close to slouching as his suit can allow. Steve smiles at him, glad the air is losing some of its tension. He wants to ask about his latest mission for Stark, wants to make sure nothing went sideways on him. Something about it must have been difficult, Iron Man always seems a little worn out after a long Stark Industries mission.
Their aim is not as good the second time around. Bullet to the eye apparently is not always fatal. Almost hurts worse than a hole in the chest, but he doesn’t bare it for long before, “I’m sorry. You can’t-”
A plush white rug spans most of the otherwise marble floor and Steve can make out a purple paint stain on one corner. He follows the corner up to see a collapsed dark wood easel and can’t help but stare at it. It is something he nearly bought himself a few months back and he can’t help but shoot Tony a wide eyed look. He never would have took Tony for an artist, but maybe he uses it as a drafting surface for his blueprints. For his part, Tony refuses to make eye contact and Steve just steps further into the room.
“Alive. Both of us.” Yinsen smiles at the word alive, trusting and weary. “We are gonna get out of this shit hole. Together.”
Yinsen cries out as Tony struggles him flat onto the metal, twisting the older man’s body enough to fit the injured leg fully along side the bulk of his weight. “We just need to head north and Rhodey will be there.” Tony says to himself as he fastens the wires around his waist and shoulders, as he grunts and begins dragging the sled out and away from the wreckage. Somehow he still has the piece of mind to pull the pin in his personally designed delayed grenade just before putting it completely behind him. If Obadiah manages to make something out of that he honestly will have earned it.
Still, the wind is fully knocked out of both of them and they lay in the heap for sometime before the last bit of adrenaline pushes Tony up and out of the now broken plating.
“What is it you need, Cap?” He asks with a forced easy smile, letting his eyes wander down the planes of Steve’s chest and abs. He’s in casual wear, a rarity these days, and Tony intends to take in his fill.
It started slowly, the morning after their conversation they’d both only managed to stay in the same room for about ten minutes. Still, making coffee for Tony and watching him smile around the mug filled him with so much warmth he started making a batch on the communal floor everyday. Those first few days consisted mostly of not talking about the elephant in the room and simultaneously avoiding and seaking each other out. It probably would have kept going like that for weeks if not for Clint.
Tony’s eyes fill with water, but he blinks it away before anything can come of it. His eyes are still wide, mouth parting silently and they just stare at each other for a long moment. It stills something in Steve’s skin, soothes away the nervous buzzing he felt since stepping foot into this room.
He watches her, nothing but a friendly gleam to his eye as she pulls out a few bottles of disgustingly expensive liquor. “Now, this one I learned in Agia Paraskevi.”
Without even a glance up, Tony lifts one hand and gestures vaguely at the ceiling. “J?” Is all Steve can hear, but it seems to do the trick because seconds later a holoscreen is blinking to life just feet from Steve’s face.
“He’s gonna try to hug me.” Tony whispers to Rhodey as the car pulls up to the curb and an entire swarm of reporters. God if it wasn’t the most efficient way to get the ball rolling on this, Tony honestly would just cancel the whole thing and go to bed.
Stark is a complicated man, even after all the allowances made for the whole ‘dying by the device I need to keep myself alive’ thing. Certainly not the most complicated person she’s ever been assigned, but something about him intrigues and frightens in equal measure. His intellect still goes past every limit she sets for it and is something to be feared all on its own. But it’s the undulation of his character that really captivates her.
Sure Tony’s first thought after accepting the Time Loop Theory™ was that Yinsen would not die this time, that he could and would save this man. But time passed and Tony thought, mind whirling past every consequence of this strange second chance. Yinsen smiles at him and Tony sees a weariness and sorrow he understands all too well and his resolve wavers more each time. There are plans, eight so far, for how exactly to get Yinsen out and back to California with him. Tony hopes he will go with one of them. He also hopes he won’t.
The run goes smoothly, as does the rest of the morning. He eats a large breakfast on his own floor and goes up to the common living room afterwards. No one else seems to be up yet, but he prefers to write up his reports in the expansive and bright space.
“Jesus.” Tony breathes out reverently and Steve’s smirk grows more wicked when the doors open to let them into the penthouse living room. They don’t say much else. They also manage both rounds in the bed this time and Tony feels like the sheets really need to be burned before he sleeps in them.
And all of that only speaks to the underlying personality, the part she figured out well enough within the first two weeks. The parts that make him truly interesting are much harder to write up in a report without sounding like a loquacious mid century author. He shows nothing resembling jealousy or possessiveness for any lover, but nearly hisses when anyone so much as looks at his favorite mug. The mansion is kept firmly above 78 degrees at all times and still, the fireplace is lit most evenings and he sits near it no matter how many blankets cover him at the time. Yet, when anything hot so much as ghosts his skin he soaks it under ice cold water for ages.
“Rhodey, go with Pepper.” Once they are fully inside the building Tony snakes out from Rhodey’s arm and starts walking away from him towards the center stage.
“Well.” Steve starts, then promptly realizes he actually has no idea how on earth to explain the situation. Rubbing a hand over his face and flopping back deeper into his seat, he admits as much. “I don’t really know how to explain this.”
When the feel of someone's hands in his chest pulls him back into reality, it takes a second for him to think anything past ‘ow ow ow, what the fuck, ow’. Then he actually feels mostly confused. This dream is so old it feels almost new, sharp in a way most nights haven’t been in years. As soon as that thought buzzes through, he realizes this is his first lucid dream in two years. Maybe that’s why he can feel it all so acutely. Feel the scratch of his throat as screams rip out of him without permission, the jolts of metal on inner tissue and numbness laced in needles so deep they pummel right through him.
“Yeah.” Tony whispears back, trailing his hand down from Steve’s neck and over his chest, to his sternum. He feels so warm now, so solid and real. Steve’s stomach rumbles when Tony presses his hand against it and something giddy bursts to life in his chest. He laughs full and bright. Steve watches him like he never wants to look at anything else. “Want me to make us something?”
The entire suit is motionless, not even the faint sound of mechanical whirling is breaking the silence. His face plate is focus so intently on Steve, he can practically feel them both holding their breath. “I’ve never seen it before, but I, I knew–”
“What?” His eyes focus on Rhodey’s and slowly, carefully, trace his line of sight to the appliance under his hand. Then he stares at it, flexes his fingers and then blinks. Twice. “Oh shit.” The words sit for a few seconds and Rhodey is about to insist on a better response because he is suddenly pretty certain the red blinking means on and Tony is very literally cooking his hand right in front of him and there is no way on earth they are making it to the ER without one of them dying.
Then he pulls back and opens his eyes and Tony keeps his closed on principle, keeps his chin tilted up and parts his lips to lick the bottom one because he knows how to play these games. It gets him a rough huff of air that tastes like victory.
“I won’t leave him out there.” He says firmly, to himself and to the gauntlet he just slammed into the crumbling wall beside him. Nothing on earth is going to stop him from getting Steve out of here. The ice can’t have him a second time.
“No of course not.” He insists, but can’t help the breathy laughs escaping him when Iron Man throws up is hands in mock surrender.
“Sir, I have located Captain Rogers.” JARVIS announces then. Tony smiles in silent thanks for getting that train wreck of a thought process cut off. Pepper looks up from her hands, lips pursed and eyes crinkled in mirth like she somehow new exactly what Tony had just been thinking. “He is currently staying at the Best Westerns on Wildcat Cir. in Lincoln Nebraska. Also his cell number is listed on the file Agent Coulson gave you.”
Things only get weirder over the next few days. Every morning he wakes up on the far side of the bed and can’t help but feel like there is some old warmth missing. JARVIS started playing music automatically after the third morning Steve requested it, but still his bedroom feels too quiet. The coffee continues and for all it is a nice indulgence, it is not something he remembers setting up. If the oddities ended there, he might have just written them off as some lingering feeling from a recurring dream he doesn’t remember in the morning. However, they are just the beginning and by far the least confusing things.
“Steve, tell me none of this smells a little funky to you?” And the whole lab is back in focus, startlingly bright and nothing but sharp edges. How long had he been completely zeroed in on Stark, absolutely unaware of his surroundings? It’s jarring, somehow shameful and Steve turns to the exit without looking back at Stark. He ignores the tearing through his chest and back as the tether screams for him to go back.
“That was entirely mutual.” Stark says it like that is all the discussion the incident deserves, like no apologies are necessary.
“Would you like that on speaker?” JARVIS asks, even as the room fills with the first ring of the call.
“Make me.” And Tony can’t ignore such an invitation, can’t do anything but swing one leg up and then the other to straddle Steve’s lap. His hand is already in the perfect position to drive Steve, to pull him in and shut the man up just like he wanted.
It takes Steve another two days to open up about it to anyone else. The same oddities keep happening and Iron Man has yet to stop by and see him since their last conversation. He’s taken to running a different path, unable to see Anna’s shop window without going inside and torturing himself with the horrible juxtaposition of knowing and not remembering.
The entire sleeve is burn to ash, but the fire is completely out and none of the hair on the side of Tony’s face seems to have been affected. His left cheek is bright red, but what she finds her eyes focused on is his shoulder. It is flaming red, nearly as metallic as his armor and broken in a strange scaly pattern with yellow lines. She feels a shiver run up her spine at the sight, because yellow is never a good color even if this one seems more golden than sickly.
That is certainly a thought. He is already dead, might as well act out one of his oldest and darkest fantasies.
“Hush, you.” Luckily, he pushes said strands back before Steve can make an idiot of himself. His little smirk has grown into a full smile now and Steve would hate to ruin the comfortable atmosphere.
“Nope, I actually really don’t.” Tony declares, stuffing his hands into his pockets and pointedly ignoring the sting in his shoulder at the movement.
Steve blinks his eyes open, a soft smile warming his face. “Sure, Tony,” He says and pulls himself up to sitting again. Tony grabs a piece of salami and some bright yellow cheddar then holds them to Steve’s lips. He opens his mouth and takes the food in, lets his tongue brush along the pads of Tony’s fingers. “Thank you.”
“Tony?” Steve manages and his vision is starting to clear, the world is starting to make sense again. For the first time in weeks he feels completely awake. How could he forget about Tony?
So, he goes home. He takes a long hot shower and changes into a comfortable pair of jeans, ignoring that his favorite pair is still missing, and pulls on a tattered green hoodie. It takes drinking two full glasses of tap water to work up the courage to ask JARVIS where he can find Tony.
“What on earth are you doing?” JARVIS had already lowered the volume on his music so she says the words in a calm voice. She almost wants to smile, but holds it back with a raised eyebrow instead.
“Madam!” Jarvis turns sharply, eyes wide. “Mama!” Tony squeals in delight and expertly slides out of Jarvis slackened hold and onto the floor. Maria manages to gracefully drop to her knees just as Tony throws himself into her waiting arms and does not have to struggle to keep them both upright against the wine fueled haze.
During the war, intelligence made more difference than any amount of firepower ever could. Steve had fought with his fair share of higher command for holding back key pieces of information, nearly lost his own men several times over less than forthcoming insights. He always understood the necessity for secrecy, the need to hold cards close to the chest, but when going into battle any piece held back could very literally mean life or death. It’d only been a few months since he’d woken up in the possession of this strange organization, but Steve already knew they only ever spoke in half truths.
Just as Tony starts to consider the chances that they might spontaneously combust any minute, the pace starts to mellow out. The sweeps of Steve’s tongue grow more exploritory than owning, the bites of his teeth no longer so close to drawing blood. It settles and shifts and Tony’s body is going lax with each soft sucking kiss.
The breaks between kisses grow longer, the time Steve takes to pull Tony’s bottom lip between his teeth and just hold it there stretches and stretches. They stay apart long enough that Steve’s lips start running along Tony’s jaw instead, start mapping their way towards his neck. Tony’s fingers scramble to get a hold in his hair and press him closer, direct him to the spot that makes his toes curl.
“I have a plan. Attack!” All his effort to keep the panic at bay sweeps away instantly as Stark disappears into the black sky. The rope stays taut even as it stretches out and passes through the bottom of the plane, staying perfectly straight. It hurts in some distant way, an ache that asks for soothing, but does not demand it. Still, something about the sensation, this invisible tether between him and the strange metallic man, spurs him into action. His hands are on a parachute before any thought can be given to the motion.
“Then you told me about the ring and I couldn’t even look at you.” Tony continues and Steve buries his face in Tony’s hair at the thought. It was supposed to be something special, something wonderful and happy, but this terrible thing ruined it. That artifact tainted something that should have only brought them happiness. If holding Tony didn’t feel like the very reason for his existence right now, Steve would be marching down to the workshop and destroying the thing with his bare hands.  “It hurt so bad Steve. I didn’t leave the workshop for two days.”
Here lies Tony Stark. He died as he lived, face down on the floor of his work shop in a puddle of mysterious fluids. It’s his last truly coherent thought before things go hazy around the edges and he can no longer hear FRIDAY reassuring him that emergency responders are on their way. He would be angry at himself for making a fucking joke of this, but really the pain is out of this world and he needs some sleep before he can bring himself to care. Or better yet, panic about not waking up once his eyes close.
She demands, shaking the poor boy as if somehow his lost eyes will hold the answers. He trembles as her grip tightens and though she knows she must be hurting him she cannot let go.
“That’s roughly thirty acres of wilderness you’re aiming to search, Boss,” FRIDAY adds and Tony would punch her if he could, would punch every thing around him if it would somehow make Steve alright. He shouldn’t still care this much, but that is a regret he had long before Siberia. By now it seems fair to say Steve will always be the ache in his chest, will never ever let the stupid feathered hope in his chest die out completely.
Time travel has occurred to him before, because of course it has and not just in the “Damn, if only I had a time machhine and could get Pepper blueberries instead” sort of way. He’d given the technology actual thought a few times, sketched out some ideas and some equations. Even got little mini breakthroughs peer-reviewed and published.
“Of course not.” Steve reassures, keeping his face serious even as his chest starts to shake with forced down laughter. Tony’s eyes narrow, but his lips are quirking up and the look just makes Steve fold like a bad hand of cards.
“A press conference? Tony you have to go to the hospital.” Pepper objects, arms coming up in an aborted move to grab his arm, likely afraid of the injuries necessitating said hospital visit.
“Who, Tony?” He knew the answer already, Tony could see it in the heavy rise and fall of the man’s breathing.
Rhodey had white knuckled the arm rest when he recalled nearly jumping out of the helicopter at the sight of a discarded oil drum two weeks before finding Tony in almost the same place. He’d gripped Tony’s arm in much the same way when admitting that he went back to that same place every few days, driven by some impossible belief that it meant something. Rhodey always was the more superstitious of the two, but Tony understood the pure desperation of grasping at straws. When an explosion went off in a cave not too far from that very place Rhodey had all but forced an entire convoy straight to that exact location. Then, when somehow Tony staggered into view Rhodey had fallen so completely mute in astonishment that another soldier had to call for their descent. There had been enough tears that neither man spoke of that topic again nor commented on the press of Rhodey’s head under Tony’s chin when they woke late the next afternoon still upright on the couch.
That of course is when things become completely not normal. Two hours pass, which Steve fills with finishing the preliminary write up and chatting with Natasha and Clint when they both pass through for snacks and some TV time. All the while, his eyes keep glancing up at the elevator, waiting for the familiar metallic figure to step out.
Steve lifts his head from where it was resting on Tony’s and frees one of his hands to tap at Tony’ chin. It takes a breath, but Tony allows Steve’s hand to guide his face up, so gently.
It isn’t until he is washing the graphite off his fingers in his personal bathroom that he realizes what actually happened. They are going on a date. Steve agreed to a date with Tony, there is no way to take the nervous start to the conversation in any other way. And when Steve agreed so quickly the joy on Tony’s face must mean he took it as acceptance to finally try for that something more.
“Yes, it’s me. What just happened?” Tony is asking, pulling Steve to sit up. He runs his hands over Steve’s face, brushes back his hair. He tries to smile, but Steve can see how shaken he is, can see the tightness that’s been sticking to the edges of him all this time. “Don’t tell me kissing me was so bad you blacked out?”
“No.” Tony cuts in sharply, reaching for the leather once more. It is only a matter of time before someone comes in to get Rhodey or tell them about the jet scheduled to transport them back to California. He decides to leave the papers where they are, loath to draw Rhodey’s attention to them. They gave him a bag along with the change of clothes anyways, he can keep them close still.
He is so tall, so broad and solid, he has to hunch down and lift Tony’s chin up for even a light peck and it makes Tony feel so small. He used to hate that, hated being the youngest guy in the school, hated being the shortest person in class. Even after starting his graduate program, he’d stayed short; that late teens’ growth spurt never came in and with his twentieth birthday on the horizon he’s starting to think it never will.
“What, maybe Clint wanted to use your room.” He insists and Steve lets out a fresh set of giggles. Leaning forward and clasping a hand on Iron Man’s shoulder to hold himself upright in the chair. Iron Man sounds positively gleeful at the turn, little static noises joining in with Steve’s snorts and chuckles. “It’s usually the cleanest!”
“Steve, I’d date you in 100 lifetimes if I could.” Tony replies, voice gone serious and eyes boring deeply into his own. It’s the same intense look Steve’s come to long for, the one Tony fixed on him so many times these past weeks.
"Okay." And it turns out that Steve brought a third blanket with him, this one looks to be his comforter based on size and general plumpness. Tony only notices because Steve turns back around to go back into the living room and in the process pulls the blanket up from dragging behind him to drape over his head. His steps are slow and a little wobbly.
“Steve.” Tony finally breaks in, voice nothing more than a breath into the space between them. He can’t say exactly why, but it makes his hands fall away, makes him take a step back. The tension is too much and suddenly all he can feel is exhaustion. The battle may not have been all that mentally exciting, but it still took its toll and that speaks nothing of the hours spend scooping buckets of disgusting sludge from the streets of Manhattan.
“Anthony!” Jarvis’ voice is strangled around the name and Maria’s whole body clenches tight in panic. Before any decision can be made she is up, tumbling herself out of the room and over the shattered remains of a glass on the hardwood floor. The sounds of running water and a child sniffling draw her quickly to the light spilling from the kitchen. It is a room she barely knows, but the sound of her child crying forces down any awkwardness in the unfamiliar surroundings.
He leaves without hearing either of their calls for him. The battle seems to be over, but he can focus on the clean up. He can focus on what he understands and make sense of Tony later. Much later if he can help it.
"What can I do?" Tony asks, feeling like the most useless person on this earth standing here using both his hands to hold a mug of decaf coffee.
“Of course.” Another hum of acceptance and Tony is sinking down into what may end up being the most peaceful sleep on record if the calm washing over him is anything to go by. Long moments pass and he nearly fades off before JARVIS calls out quiet and slow. “And what name for Project 3, Sir?”
“Stark, you know that’s a one way trip.” Steve tells him, voice steady as ever, even as his entire body ratchets tight in panic. He can feel Stark’s body relax in awe at the portal, can feel him tense in fear as he slips past the border. He knows when Stark stops breathing. When his heart stops beating. When the tether loosens.
“Stark.” A voice calls out just as the heavy base cuts off mid verse. Tony starts at the interruption, but swivels away from his holoscreen to see Steve Rogers standing in the doorway. For all his large frame fills the empty space, he looks small and uncertain standing with his hands shoved deep in his pockets. Tony takes a second to admire how ridiculously well the man pulls of plaid and khakis before standing with a stretch. He feels uncomfortably pleased when Steve’s eyes follow the movement.
“Jesus, fucking hell. Steve!” Tony shouts and his orgasm is suddenly right there. It’s crashing into him and over him and all over Steve’s hand. The thought makes him whine harder, makes him press up further into that hand as he shudders with the intensity of it all.
Steve’s fingers spasm again, tapping an unsteady staccato rhythm into the sides of Tony’s legs and it shakes some of the haze loose. He pulls up properly this time, straightens his back enough that Steve has to look up to keep their eyes locked. Tony starts to slide one leg off the couch, begins the process of getting out of Steve’s lap. “I’ll just–”
“Trust me for a little bit. I got a whole plan, green energy and medical supply and an entire host of other products that will take hours to list. I promise I will let you in on every bit of it later.” Happy meets them just as Tony moves off the sidewalk and reaches to open the back door. He slides in, but stops Rhodey from following.
It’s so hot and Steve is panting into his neck, breath humid and Tony can’t help but curl into it. His hands grip hard in to Steve’s back and Steve’s just get firmer, start guiding his movement. Oh fuck, is that even better and Tony let’s him. Goes limp and shivery as Steve pushes and pulls and suddenly freezes.
“You drive me mad, you know that?” He can’t help but say. It’s the most honest thing he’s ever said.
“Yes! We can’t be sure something won’t-” Rhodey jumps up to stop him from tying the first knot. Tony slaps his hand away and cuts him off again.
Before he can even decide which dune seems easiest to pull Yinsen over, a faint clipping whirl signals to his left. The two choppers are cresting over the horizon just as Tony turns in their direction and only he will ever know the volume of the sob he lets out at that. He allows his legs to buckle like before, let’s his hands splay wide above his head and ignores how his tears instantly evaporate on the warm skin of his cheeks. Yinsen does not so much as stir as the choppers spin up the air around them, but Rhodey is here and everything is going to be fine.
“Yeah, I was gonna take you out, make a whole day about it.” Steve replies, he lets out his breath in one long exhale and grins. “Was gonna take you to that car show in september. Then after I’d take you to dinner, get them to give us a private room.” He leans forward to brush his nose against Tony’s and grins brighter when Tony chuckles at the gesture.  “Just me and you.”
“Oh my god, Tony.” Pepper whispers to her hands, which now hold her face. Her voice is two parts exasperation and three parts incredulity, but that’s a normal cocktail for their conversations. Tony wants to be annoyed that she would even think something like that, but well. It’s not like he didn’t think about it at least 400 times in his youth, and later in is admittedly not youth. And okay, for like the entire time he was standing next to the guy. That’s neither here nor there though, and certainly does not mean he is the ditched prom date in the scenario.
His voice is far away and he isn’t really speaking to her so much as speaking the words out into the universe at large. There is no trust in telling her this story and she feels thankful for that. Far more innocent men have misguidedly given their trust to her, but Stark’s faith is hard won and harder to keep. He trusts her in only the way anyone would trust a faceless bartender. A stranger who has no power to do anything with your secrets simply because they do not care. It’s fitting and exactly where she wants to keep him. It will make the transition to team mates easier if he ever steps up enough to join the Initiative.
“Hey, Shellhead.” Steve replies, easy smile spreading his lips. It feels nice to sit down for a chat together, feels like it has been years. Distantly, he remembers that they have gone much longer than a week without so much as speaking, but he pushes that thought away. He has every right to miss his friend no matter the length of separation.
“I’d be happy to.” Steve agrees with a nod and can’t even bother to feel anything but warm when he realizes it has to be the one he avoids running past. “I’ve ran past a few times. Thought it looked pretty good.”
“What?” Steve can't help but ask, feeling both stupid and indignant as Stark continues to needle at him. The man is awful, poking at every raw edge of Steve like he has some vendetta against him or probably more accurately some great amusement to gain from riling Steve up. Luckily, before things really escalate a loud thump crackles above them and breaks their concentration. They both look out the front window, only to see a huge man clinging to the nose. A burst of lightning and they are all moving for some kind of weapon. Stark opens the ramp and before Steve can get the words out to question that stupid idea the man comes flying into their plane. There is shouting, there is a thud against his chest as Iron Man falls into Steve. The man pays them no mind, grabs Loki and flies right back out. Steve would likely be shouting along, but he managed to catch a glimpse at the man's face and reassures both Romanov and Stark that the man is a friendly.
Something occurs to her at that and she lets her mind pull up the memories as he takes a gulp of air and shoots. A man, not much younger than Stark, alone in a remote house somewhere east of Mezyn. He stoked the fire and spat into it a ball not unlike an ember, igniting the hearth anew as she observed through the far window. His death was quick and his body dragged thirty miles back to a rendezvous point. She’d been fifteen and freshly upgraded to missions at the highest risk level. A Drakon, hunted for his blood and bones, whose last words she no longer remembered.
“I will Mama, I promise. I promise!” Hiccuping and sniffling, Tony repeats the words over and over until the skin under her hands has muted in it’s beautiful shimmering, until only a deep pink remains. She watches this process and can only spare the barest thanks that his colors would be so similar to a real burn. Somehow, somehow this can be kept a secret. From everyone. From him.
Steve can see the frustration in every movement even through the video and tries to place the time of this recording. Tony is wearing a black tank top and sweats, but that is a normal enough outfit that it does very little to help him.
“If I had to do it all over, I wanted to keep somethings the same.” Tony tells him with a shrug. The idea makes something in Steve’s gut grow warm and liquid.
At first he is certain Steve didn’t hear him, is certain he didn’t even really let those words out himself. Steve is still nibbling into the underside of his jaw and Tony is still leaning most of his weight into his boyfriend’s large frame. Then the echo reverberates back and Steve seems to finally register their meaning, because he pulls back with a pop. If Tony could think past the startled look in Steve’s eyes he might have shivered at the thought of a hickey so high up.
, in those big blue eyes. He is staring down at Tony, smiling so soft and petting his cheek like it is made of something delicate and breakable. It makes Tony feel like he really is fragile, like he is going to shatter and spill out over the edge of the couch if Steve stops touching him.
Calm guitar fills the room, abating some of the unease in his gut. He stands, shakes out his shoulders and decides a long run through central park would go a long way to washing out any lingering adrenaline from yesterday. Slipping on a plain T-shirt, some cotton shorts and ankle socks, he makes his way out of the bedroom.
JARVIS interrupts him, likely growing concerned with Steve just standing motionless and contemplating his shoes for a solid two minutes. Deciding he needs the run more than usual, Steve snaggs them and slips them on. He walks out the door without further rumination.
Grunting can be heard from the far corner and Steve swivels to follow it, knocking over a desk chair and potted plant on his way. The suit is crumpled over, resting against a rather large dent in the wall and Steve can see the faceplate is cracked and one of the gauntlets is laying next to it. A tan hand waves out, either to draw Steve over or wave him off since Iron Man’s identity is at risk. Steve decides to go with the former and rushes closer.
“Stay,” Steve growls in response, shifting to crawl over Tony and press him down into the bed. His eyes are bright and alert when he reaches for Tony’s dick, earning a soft gasp and grown. He leans down more, settles his weight over Tony in a delicious slide of skin and nips his own path up to Tony’s ear. “Tony.”
“I love you. So much.” Steve tells him, head shaking because that isn’t even enough, nothing will ever be enough to explain how deeply he means it. Somehow though, Steve thinks Tony understands him, thinks the endless warmth of his eyes is there because he knows it.
No one responded to Tony’s grumbling, but Steve felt himself relax into it and didn’t bother mentioning his own movie choice. They didn’t say hello, but not twenty minutes into the movie Tony seemed unable to contain himself anymore and started muttering. It was a habit they’d gotten into months ago, Iron Man would whisper little jokes to Steve and Steve would try his hardest not to disrupt the movie with his laughter. Sometimes Steve would joke back, sometimes he would just let the easy company wash over him, but Tony always kept the words coming.
The night floats on and she silently makes him two more shots before he retires for the evening and she lets herself out of the mansion. It takes digging, days of it because Stark is a very busy man and Natalie is in charge of that business. Eventually though, the pieces come together: a long forgotten lineage, a mysterious death sixty eight years ago in the small town of Specchia and a misplaced military diary entry for May 1st 2009. It is an incomplete picture to say the least, but Natasha knows two things for certain. Tony Stark is a Dragon and Maria Stark is the one who keeps his secret safe.
"What?" Steve blinks and sinks back into the couch as if to specifically go against Tony’s demand. Tony pays it no mind and simply pulls at one of the edges of the blankets.
Tony’s face scrunches up at that and he lets out a gasping sob. His eyes squeeze shut, but a few tears manage to peek out at the edges and Steve lifts one hand to wipe them away.
Steve is standing up by Romanov, listening to her relay their successful capture to Fury, when Iron Man steps up beside him. Perhaps if Steve had known at the time just how important the move would be, he would have hesitated a little bit, or put more thought behind his movement. As it stands, he does little more than react subconsciously as the face of the machine flips up and retracts back. It’s simply mindless, his head turning and his eyes focusing in on the now exposed face of the man beside him. Stark is looking at Romanov, so for a brief moment Steve looks at the side of his face as he would any new person, or at least any new very attractive person. And Stark is attractive, even more so with the sweat pressing the fringe along the man’s temple into his skin. Steve has always appreciated the artistry of a strong jaw in profile.
It is a shame though, because it may have been one of the most fulfilling sexual encounters of Tony’s life. An argument about his flipency when dealing with an overzealous reporter had lead to Steve following him into the penthouse. Tony tried to break the tension, suggested they let their anger out with a round of mario kart and Steve went along with it for a bit. Then something had shifted, their bickering went playful, then flirtatious and then Steve was tackling him into the couch for a perfectly timed blue shell.
It seems simple enough at first, just a single guy in an outrageously bright blue pin-striped suit surrounded by a couple dozen slimy slug looking creatures. However, after the first few tentative hits, it becomes apparent that the creatures grow larger with each absorbed shock. Iron Man’s repulsors and Thor’s lightning cut through without causing swelling, but the masses quickly mold back together.
“Me too.” Steve tells him, smile impossibly softer. He leans down, uses the light pressure of his fingers still on Tony’s cheek to guide him up just enough to touch their lips together. It’s a tiny thing, soft and quiet. Their lips are barely puckered, still stretch too flat against their teeth with their grins. It explodes the whole room into a beautifully dizzying warmth.
“Mm.” Steve mumbles and tightens his hold on Tony’s middle. Tony laughs and tries to squirm away. “Going somewhere?”
“You could say that again.” Steve laughs and leans back in his chair. There is no reason to wallow in his own mistakes and brashness. This could be an easy turning point for them. It would certainly make working together easier. For all Stark insists he is a civilian, his brains have been an asset in more than a few battles. Besides, no one can design a suit as spectacular as Iron Man without knowing the intricacies of all their fights. If they can let their past animosity be water under the bridge, it could be worthwhile to start debriefing him in person instead of trusting him to read any relevant reports on his own.
The absent and easy aesthetic appreciation does not last long though, because just as Steve turned to see Stark on reflex, Stark turns to casually meet his eyes. It is not soft, it is not subtle, but it is not jarring in the way of Stark’s musical entrance. It feels like a bubble popping, a latch slipping into place, a key finally turning its lock. Something inevitable. One moment Steve is admiring Stark’s precisely sculpted beard along the bone of his jaw and the next he knows the exact rhythm of the other man’s heart.
There is nothing to say to that, nothing that won’t sound pathetic and needy, so Tony turns away and leaves the room. He shuts down the face plate and connects to the nearest satellite. It takes a few moments, but Natasha picks up, her face flickering into view. She doesn’t say anything, just looks over his face and sags in sudden relief.
It’s way too warm and Tony still vaguely wants to be holding his mug, but he also feels more comfortable than he has in months, years even. Steve is solid, but soft, all along his right side and the comforter is a thick down not dissimilar to the one Tony himself sleeps with whenever he makes it to his bedroom. The window directly in front of them is open to let in the neverending glimmering of Manhattan stretching out into the horizon. It feels like home.
“I just need to talk to Rogers.” He can feel him still worrying and anxious in the background and when he says the name he feels something like longing rush through the guy and he is done with this honestly. If the guy is so lonely he can somehow catch Tony’s unique ‘Saying Rogers out loud’ feeling he can certainly give Tony a fucking phone call. The first words came out calm, but he feels back up to boiling again and can’t stop himself from rocking back in his chair. “I mean, it’s been two fucking weeks and he can’t even send me a postcard?!” He demands of the ceiling and hears Pepper hold back some strangled coughing noise. Rogers starts flooding with concern and goddamn if the guys is worried about why Tony is so annoyed he could just ASK!
“That’s not true.” He feels himself reply, but he is more focused on looking at Stark. Something in his chest feels both too tight and gapingly empty. He feels rotten for not seeing the kindness in those eyes before, feels cheated out of years of good friendship simply because he made assumptions. Yet, it seems right that he would be punished. For years he wanted people to actually get to know him, for people to stop deciding his limitations and abilities from one glance. Then the second he could repay the favor to someone else he made the same mistakes. No one with such a genuine smile could be the selfish man Steve always told himself Stark had to be.
“Yeah, is that... is that okay?” Steve asks, but it comes out in pieces, clipped in places by tiny cracking moans. Tony’s hand is speeding up, pushing the foreskin up and down, squeezing down at the head and base in alternating patterns. He can’t look away, but Steve can’t seem to either. He is resting his forehead on Tony’s and they both are just staring down at Tony’s hand in fascination.
The reactor is similar to his first, but there is a smoothness to it, the connection against skin more precise, waterproof casing more secure. The coils and circuitry are finer, he knows no wires will get caught when he takes it out himself, that he won’t have to ask Pepper to assist him. Tony is incapable of making any of the same mistakes twice, at least where his machhines are concerned. Otherwise, well, they stop being mistakes after the fifth or sixth time, so maybe it still counts.
“I’m prepared to leave the team.” Tony says suddenly and Steve snaps up to stare in shock. “Rhodey may be the militaries little yappy chihuahua, but he’s good for lending air support when you need it.”
“Sorry to cut your vacation short.” His walls draw up with a sniff and the straightening of his shoulders. “Meant to give you a full three months.”
“I can’t leave him out there,” Tony curses to the empty room around him. The building is cut open in one corner and mostly falling apart in the others, but it gives a reprieve from the biting winds. There is no answer to his outburst, but the silence is neither judgemental or encouraging, so he just mutters to himself, “I can do this.”
“That last stunt says otherwise.” Steve points out, hand itching to smooth back the large clump of hair now hanging over the other man’s forehead.
“Classified?” Steve manages after a few calming breaths, deciding to go back into his room so the blank screen would stop taunting him. Iron Man was Stark’s employee before he was anything else. As much as Steve wanted to, he really didn’t have any right to demand information. He just felt so off-kilter today and he knows Iron Man’s company would go a long way to easing that.
“It’ll be fine.” Steve tells him and Tony moves to gather two of the bowls from the tiny cabinet above the sink. He serves them both and brings them the bowls along with two tarnished spoons. He lets Steve feed himself this time, but sits close enough to brush their arms together with every bite.
“Maybe,” Tony admits and runs a hand through Steve’s hair, before dropping it to his neck and holding on a little too tight. “Wouldn’t mind spending the time here.”
“Who?” Glancing back at the tightly closed opening, he lowers his voice. “You can’t think someone here would-”
“What the hell?! Your hand!” And he is sitting up in a rush, very insistently ignoring the way the whole room spins around at the movement. The jolt seems to wake Tony who yanks his hand off like it’s been burned, because well, it fucking has been. It’s bright red and shining and hell Rhodey has never seen a burn so bad it glimmers like that, but he is sure as shit freaking the fuck out about it.
“It’s an electromagnet, hooked up to a car battery, trying to keep the shrapnel stationary.” Tony says, looking over the lines of Yinsens suit. It looks neat, but the tattering along the edges and the yellowing along the collar make Tony ache for the other man’s losses.
Once inside the workshop he gives himself a long minute to breathe in the metallic air and soak in the sigh of his bots and his tec and his home. Then he straightens and walks over to the scanner sat to the side of one counter top on the far wall, skimming hands over DUM-E and U as he passes them with reverence. Once the papers are stacked in the slot, he walks the few more paces into the corner and falls onto the cot with a deep throaty sigh. The bots sidle up next to him and he pats each one in turn before closing his eyes and speaking up into the ceiling like a goddamn loon. “I need you to scan in those pages and start three new project folders for me.”
“It’s okay now, we figured it out.” Steve shushes him again and finally gives in to the desire to have them pressed close again. Tony goes willingly, laying his cheek on Steve’s shoulder and slumping to let Steve take all his weight. It feels like he can finally fill his lungs all the way with Tony’s weight pressing into them. They went too long without this, Steve can’t let another minute pass without holding Tony. “We’ll figure out why it happened.”
“Uh, alright.” Steve finally manages, looking down to fill his water bottle and take in the short response. “Does he, well, does he know when he will be available?”
The world is a mess, so much of which he made with his own two hands. Although he never really cared much for manners, it still feels wrong to leave the party without at least throwing out his own garbage. There is a laundry list of things he wants to fix, people he needs to care for and protect, wrongs to undo. But oh, is he tired. He has been so tired for so long and this just feels like finally finding a bed comfortable enough to close his eyes and not have to dream.
When Tony moves away to Boston, she buys him the most expensive welders gloves available and kisses his cheeks until he laughs and shoves her away. She never tells him. He never asks.
“Tony.” Steve husks out and Tony’s eyes flick up to find Steve open mouthed and hazy eyed, staring at Tony like he wants to devour him. Tony feels inclined to allow it.
“It is Christmas Eve, Stark. You can’t spend the night drinking alone.” Steve replies, walking them further into the swath of socialites Tony really wishes he didn’t know.
Tony smiles, unable to stop it, as he lets the tension drain and all responsibilities wait until tomorrow. “Avengers Assemble.”
“I passed out from the hypothermia before I ever swallowed any water.” And wow if Tony didn’t feel like a complete tool for his last thought. He tightens his fingers where they’ve interlocked with Steve’s. Steve squeezed back and takes a few more deep breaths. “I was awake, for awhile. And I remember all of it.”
"I–" It hurts, the noise. It hurts how tenderly Steve is looking at him. Like all of it is okay, sad and terrible, but okay.
“Or, we could not.” Steve says and it takes a second for Tony to blink back into their conversation, but then he can only smile. He knows it looks sickeningly soft, can feel the affection dripping off of it, but to be honest he really likes that Steve can make his face do things like this.
His hands clasp at the thick blue silk of her sides, tight enough that she can feel the pulling of the seems along the zip. Hiccups and gasps drown out the crackling of the fire beside them and she simply holds the boy and lets all the fear and sorrow spill out of her. Hysterically she feels sorry for the snot that Anna will have to wash out of the little one’s hair, but cannot stop from burying her soaking face into the dark curls. Time passes in a blur as both the terror of this revelation and the cold ice of repressed memories rack through her in tumbling, thrashing waves.
While Tony is still thrusting up in an effort to chase the aftershocks, Steve slumps down over him with a sigh that has to contain all the air in the world. It pushes Tony deep into the couch cushions and makes his toes curl even as he twists away from the too intense feeling of Steve’s hand on him. His own hand is stuck between their stomachs, but he can’t think about anything at all. His brain has left the building and Tony won’t mind if it never comes back. He feels tingly all over, feels languid and molten soft underneath Steve.
It would surprise absolutely no one if he admitted to thinking about this a lot the past few weeks. Hell, he knows they’ve been flirting pretty steadily since that movie night and it’s only gotten worse the more time Steve spends with him. He wants this sure, but as with everything else the intensity is all out of proportion. This desire feels well worn, he isn’t nervous, just happy.
It takes far too long to be reasonable, but Tony gets the button open, gets the zipper pulled down. He loses track of the plot at that point though, loses track of every single thing that isn’t the wet spot tinting Steve’s blue briefs. It makes his fingers twitch, makes his mouth water and shit that bulge is so big.
“Me too.” Steve manages, voice tight and strangled. He can’t manage enough saliva to wet his own lips, can’t find enough presence of mind to do anything but stare at the plush skin tucked between Tony’s teeth. It slips out and Steve watches the chuckle form there, watches the sound puff out and cool the slick glimmer of saliva he can just make out on the surface.
Tony pulls away, but can’t stay away long and presses another kiss to the corner of Steve’s mouth. He tries again and this time the kiss lands on Steve’s cheak, another on his forehead, his nose, his chin.  They keep coming, all over his face, quick desperate pecks to every inch of skin Tony can find. “God, Steve. I missed you. I missed you.”
“Doctor Banner, put down the scepter.” Steve manages and Banner looks as shocked by the proceedings as everyone else. The tension suddenly shifts again as the monitors let off a noise. The tesseract is found and Steve breathes in a deep breath of relief. They can focus on this, band together and drop the anger flowing between them for a common goal.
“Come on up for a game, then,” Tony cuts off, deciding they may as well cut to the chase of it all. Steve apparently couldn’t figure out a graceful way to ask for a friends with benefits sort of arrangement between them and Tony can be the gracious host and fill in the blanks for him. “If you think I cheat at video games, you can try me at chess.”
handbasket of doom, Tony might have given into the panic attack such revelation threatened. Instead, he treated Mr. Golden Boy like a bag of dirt and ran away from him at nearly every opportunity. When the guy only seemed to take that as a queue to hunt him down and press in closer, Tony realized the whole thing went both ways. Then he really did give into the panic a little bit.
Instead of completely losing his mind though, Steve forces himself to step out next to Tony and shut the door behind him. It puts his body close to Tony, near enough to feel his heat, but too far to be touching. Tony lets them linger like that for a moment, eyes locked and smiles stupidly big and bright. Then he clears his throat and steps back, gesturing to the elevator, “shall we?”
“You can never do this again.” She begs into the downy softness of his overgrown hair. “Never again.” The boy continues to sob, but she can feel the near frantic nodding against her breast and presses their bodies tighter together. “Forget about it, never touch fire again. Never show anyone.”
“No?” She asks, not at all disappointed by the outcome of the pause. It may just be an anecdotal story, but he always makes those sorts of things amusing. Honestly, this may be some of the most fun she’s had undercover in a long time.
They stay like that, wrapped around each other, desperately trying not to sob and Tony finally understands. He finally understands why that fluttering would never die, why the tether would never break. Everytime, Steve was there on the other end, longing just as deeply for all his silence. Tony feels a fresh wave bubble up in him and Steve shushes him, loosening his hold only to rub his hand up and down Tony’s back. It’s such a simple gesture, but Tony feels so cherished, so protected, so loved.
”We don’t have to do anything, really.” Tony promises, he scrambles at his thoughts like they are a deck of cards he just threw out on the floor. “I like just being with you, just sitting and being close and–”
“Well, because… Because!” Is all he can come up with. There really is no way to explain this need without admitting to everything he just decided not to tell her.
People base romantic entanglements on less and for all Steve usually likes to befriend someone first, he is not above going into that sort of thing with a hope for more. If Stark is interested, well, he would definitely not complain.
They are eye to eye now, Tony can make out every individual shade of Steve’s eyes and they are so horribly beautiful. The little crinkles at the edges hint at what he’ll look like as the years pass, and Tony is overcome with the need to see that someday. It’s dumb, just a fleeting idea, but something about watching the age lines work their way into Steve’s skin, of being the one to make sure they are more for laughs than worry. Well, it has an appeal to it. Something much more than an appeal if Tony is being honest.
When Tony had initially outlined his proposed time table, Yinsen had tried and failed spectacularly to hide his incredulity. Which, of course was understandable, as not even Tony Stark would have been capable of the speed without deep long standing knowledge of seemingly non-existent technology. Even then, their luck with predicting their captors movements and observation angles was the main key of keeping everything on track. Yinsen’s amazement at that feat makes Tony squirm under the weight of all the lies this second life demands.
"Then. Next time.” A nod and his smile wobbles just the smallest amount. “Next time you come find me too. Okay?"
“Okay? Was it a magical box?” Iron Man teases, but Steve feels the weariness settling back on his shoulders and can’t manage more than an amused huff in response.
“By tonight, I mean it.” She calls out, not letting even a speck of her worry worm it’s way into her voice.
Weeks pass and Steve is no closer to an answer for his problem. The oddities are starting to just feel like a part of his normal life, the little hazy memories no longer fill him with abject dread. It still makes him uneasy and he spends several hours each week going through tests with Bruce. Natasha is yet to find anything that could narrow down their searching, but she continues to look between her own missions and Avengers business. Clint teases him about going senile and Tony keeps looking at him with such intense emotion Steve always ends up looking away first.
“Fuck.” Tony mutters to himself as he staggers unevenly in the sand, leavering up from his hands and knees with effort. He takes a long shaky pull of dry air with closed eyes. Then he is grinning and laughing and coughing with delight.
He does not get far before both Pepper and Rhodey are at his sides and fuming. “Tony, what the hell are you doing?” and “Really, you couldn’t have warned me at all?” snap out of each respectively but he just grins and continues walking.
“Sleep is for everyone.” Rogers insists, but Tony’s hearing catches on the sound of fabric rustling. It takes a second for him to move past the idea that Captain America is laying down and chatting on the phone with him before bed. It feels so normal, feels like the long conversations he had with Rhodey back in the day. Summers when they had more time than they knew what to do with and sat for hours playing the same video games, lying about their scores to one up each other.
“JARVIS, would you let Iron Man know I’m going down to the gym if he would like to spar when he’s done with Mr. Stark?” His report saved, he tucks his tablet under his arm and makes his way to the elevator. He is still in athletic clothes, so he will only need to drop off on his floor to deposit his Starkpad and maybe grab his large water bottle. He makes it into his kitchen before realizing JARVIS never answered his request. “JARVIS, will Iron Man be able to stop by?”
“If that’s wine I’ll eat my hat.” The perfect arch of Steve’s raised eyebrow really isn’t helping matters, so Tony spins in his stool and takes a sniff of his drink as he looks out on the crowd filling the large open floor. He knows now is a good time to stop, right before he tips into fully sloshed, but its smooth flavor calls out just beneath the beat of the music all around him.
"Are we done here?" Steve manages when they all struggle to their feet. Thor eyes his shield, but nods.
“Sorry. That was…I’m a bit wasted.” Tony admits when staring into those baby blues gets to be a bit too much.
“Fine. Still hate this plan though.” Rhodey puts his hands in his pocket, seemingly to prevent himself from reaching out and tugging Tony from the car and back into the safety of his old friend’s arms.
Maybe it’s just because this is more than Tony he’s thinking about, it’s his Shellhead. It’s the man that spent nights comforting him when he couldn’t sleep. It’s the friend that spent weeks watching old movies with him and writing lists of songs he needed to listen to. Tony’s been there for him like no one else in this new world, he helped him, gave him an ear and a shoulder. They’ve fought together and against each other and Steve knows him so well that doing this sort of thing together just feels like another adventure.
The tether is short, barely yanking anymore and Steve jumps up onto a thick branch blocking view of the clearing in time to see both Stark and Thor pull their arms back to begin striking again. His shield is in the air, landing first in Thor's chest and then against the thick plate of Stark's armored stomach. Steve ignores the vibrating it causes against the sensitive flesh and catches his shield as it flies back to him.
“You like it.” Tony insists, still laughing at himself and she lets out a happy little sigh, letting her whole face relax into a small fond smile. Things have been so strained with Tony lately, like there is some deep secret he keeps biting back every time they talk. Seeing him grinning and joking eases the knot in her gut. It’s refreshing and comforting. She just wants to sit here and smile at him forever.
"Yeah. I'm just getting some coffee." Tony responds in a rush when he realizes he’s been staring long enough for the machine to ding at him in prompting.
“Tony, what is going on?” Pepper asks, standing up now and very cautiously moving closer. Her palms are up and she starts to smile like a zoo keeper trying to calm a very worked up tiger that just escaped its enclosure. “Are you alright?”
“I thought so too, but only you and Clint are in there all that regularly and I doubt either of you are using them.” He points out, arms still gesturing too wide and erratic. Talking about it all just makes everything more real, more insane.
They are both silent for a stretch, aside from Tony slurping at his bowl of wine. When Rhodey finally manages to roll onto his side and look at his best friend full on he grins and says, “Fuck you, butthead.”
By the time they get to base, the glimmer has faded and Rhodey is too busy thinking about how glad he is to see Tony’s stupid smirk to even care about what he might have seen. Tony is alive and back right where he belongs, being a frustrating idiot. Rhodey would have searched that desert for the rest of his life, would do it several lifetimes over.
It felt so wonderfully normal, so completely like it should. The memories of this were solid, for all some of them had the hazy outline of Tony instead of the armor. They always did this, even in Steve’s fake memories. Iron Man or Tony, Steve always ended up laughing with him.
His brain might just be spilling out his ears, which is the only reason he doesn’t stop himself before muttering, “You can stay.”
“Was there a reason for this call?” Rogers asks after they sit in silence for a bit longer than should be comfortable. Tony almost wishes it would have lasted longer, almost wishes he could fall asleep with the faint sounds of Captain America’s static breathing through his speakers. The tether feels more like an anchor and less like a chain the more time he spends focused in on Rogers, the more time he just basks in this easy contentment. Every one of Roger’s feelings seems too large for this world, too much and too heavy.  Right now though Tony wants nothing more than to be trapped under the weight of it. He is fucked.
“I wouldn’t do that-” Yinsen starts, but Tony does not hear the rest of it as he rolls off the bed and the wires yank and split. He chokes on a burst of air as magnet and skin and tissue go right along with it. God this feeling, so familiar he almost relishes in it. Even as he feels the constricting, the air rushing out of him as if it can not bear the thought of giving life to someone like him.
“Sam and Vision are back. The wings took a few good hits too many, thought you could give ‘em a look.” Steve is still looking at him with that wary frown that seems to have etched itself into the very cells of his face since Tony started spending more time at the compound.
Clint, however, seemed to have absolutely no reservations. He’d gotten up without a word to anyone else and started yelling for Stark to get his ass to the party before even getting into the elevator. Three minutes later they both entered the room, Tony disheveled and irritated, Clint all smiles. Without so much as an explanation, Clint tossed Tony into the seat next to Steve, took his own on the floor in front of Natasha and immediately started campaigning for Wreck it Ralph.
“Rhodey, someone tied very closely with that operation gave them my location. Only so many people knew the details.” And Rhodey knows, he has already ran through countless theories before now. Tony knows this, but he still smiles when Rhodey jumps right in alongside him. Sure Rhodey is a pretty face, but the brain is what keeps Tony coming back.
“Oh it does, a whole ton actually.” He replies casually as he turns away from DUM-E and back to look at her, hose still pouring water all over his shoulder. A dark wet line trails all the way down his jeans to the puddle forming on the floor. She looks at him incredulously, because this tone is entirely too calm for what just occurred. He was on fire, actually on fire, and somehow this seems like the least exciting thing to happen to him in years. Then she looks back at his shoulder and notices how the skin now only seems a bit pink under the water. Apparently her shock somehow exaggerated the color earlier. There is only the faint hint of yellow lines and those only seem like stretch marks on his olive skin.
“My parents died this time of year. In a car crash, sure you’ve read the file.” It feels right to say it outloud to Steve. Feels right to chop off another piece of his heart and give it away. Somehow it even feels right that Steve would recoil at the reveal, that he would grimace and look away like this is finally the too much Tony always knew he would be for anyone. “I’ve been…trying. You know I’ve been trying?” He asks, one last desperate grap to pull them back into something better than where they are now.
“Sounds like a blizzard.” Steve whispers into his hair some thousand years later and Tony feels languid as he pulls back to meet his eyes. They are red rimmed and the most beautiful thing in Tony’s entire life. It feels right that his arc reactor was blue, feels right that something like Steve’s eyes would have been the magnet keeping his heart safe.
They stay like that, just breathing. He considers just leaving it here for now, thinks to just lift Tony up in his arms and take him to their bed. Something itches at his mind though and he knows they have more to say before he can let either of them sleep.
Then he collapses, shoves his face into the crook of Tony’s neck and lets out a distressingly amusing groan.
Which, brings up a whole other line of questioning. He snaps his fingers and points at Pepper like she might have been keeping this cell phone of Captain America’s a secret from him. “Why didn’t he give me his number too!” Well, Tony doesn’t need him to, Tony doesn’t need Rogers to do anything. He has all the tools he could ever need at his disposal and a sudden disregard for using these powers for good. “J, find Rogers’ cell number!”
Steve looks up from his sketch to check the lines of Tony’s nose in profile only to find Tony staring straight at him. It freezes him in place and he lets the sketchbook and pencil slide down into his lap.
"Budge over." Tony demands, turning to drop his mug on the table, on top of a coaster because he is a civilized man.
Yinsen is not moving and Tony’s first thought is how the discarded chest piece is sharp enough that he could die on impact if he threw himself down at a roughly 64 degree angle. But, the initial observation missed the slow and ragged rise of Yinsen’s waistcoat and Tony luckily catches it before finalizing the calculations for necessary blunt force. Instead of flailing dramatically at his own discarded tec, Tony scrambles over to Yinsens side.
He starts towards the couch, but glances back at Steve and sees the still mostly askew hoodie and tied up sneakers. He stops and Steve bumps into him a little, clearly not paying too much attention to anything other than Tony’s back. Normally, that would give him a little thrill, a spike of adrenaline and joy, but he feels stupidly uncertain. Part of him wants to just rewind and let Steve go back to his stupid dorm room, just take a handful more kisses and call it good.
“Well, you know...” Tony huffs out, but the little curl at the corner is coming to be one of Steve’s favorite things. He pats his chest and arches an eyebrow, “can’t keep Iron Man down.”
Steve puls back with a pop, but his arm gets even tighter, fingers digging into Tony’s side and the keening that illisits is completely involuntary. It makes Steve’s eyes go wide and Tony bites down on his lip to try and get himself under control. It may have been a long fucking while since he’s been with anyone, but jesus he has never been this needy for it.
“Cap!” He screams and trudges forward, blasting the snow out of his way. “Answer me, damn it!” The HUD is spitting readouts of a lowered heartbeat and shallow breaths and Tony wants to start sobbing in relief. Somehow he keeps it together long enough to fall to his knees at Steve’s side and start digging him out.
Tony never needed to tell him he was Iron Man. He told the world three years before Steve even woke up. In another month, they’ll have been together for two years.
His newest home is in ruins, he is somehow tied to a man straight out of his childhood dreams and he cannot close his eyes without seeing an impossible army of monsters floating in an endless sea of black. There is a list several miles long of things he needs to worry about, to fix and repair and make better. Yet, all he can think about is Captain America and his unrelenting emotional see-sawing.
Yinsen has come over, shocked and yelling with wide eyes. “Why would you -” is all that Tony hears before the edges go black, his throat closes up and he thinks hysterically ‘I shouldn’t be able to die in Hell’.
Yinsen looks a little shocked at his summary, but smiles and tells Tony how they met once in Berlin, about a lecture and a drunk asshole. Tony smiles, but is cut off by the hammering at the door and feels his stomachh drop at the noise. He remembers this part too well. Knows what’s coming, wants anything else.
They’ve kissed before, they’ve kissed so many times Steve’s done it in his sleep. They’ve gone to Il Ghiottone’s so often the waitress stopped begging him to try anything new. Steve’s room feels too quiet because he hadn’t slept there in weeks, had started keeping his straight razor in Tony’s bathroom over a year ago. That turned over photo is of them on their first vacation together, a selfie taken by Steve of the two of them tangled together in a hammock. It is blurry and Tony’s shirt is stained with BBQ sauce, but it’s been sitting there since last june. That blanket stopped being Steve’s the first time he left it with Tony before doing a week long OP for SHIELD. He paid for the ring on the first of september, picked it because it reminded him of the watch Tony gave him for their first anniversary.
“Well,” Steve starts, smirking when Tony swallows at the suddenly deeper tone of his voice. “if you’re gonna be like that about it-”
“Yes, I think we just might.” Yinsen admits eventually, quiet and sincere, and he does not have the same hesitation for looking at his companion. Tony repays that courtesy and meets the man’s eyes firmly.
“Oh shut up.” Tony replies, but the words sound like a caress, soft and gentle as Tony’s fingers playing with the strands of his hair.
“Good?” Steve asks, with the audacity to sound a little uncertain of the answer. Tony is laughing before he can stop it, the sound bright and happier than he’s ever heard from himself. Something heavy is gone, some hard object is no longer taking up space in his chest and all the volume can finally make it out.
“The first group goes in Project 1, name Iron Man U2. Set them in a sub project titled mach 1 and take the next ten in for a mach 2.” He rattles off, settling down into the familiar comfort of the memory foam beneath him. “The next go in for Project Neutralize Stane along with all recordings on this.” He tosses the rectangle to DUM-E, who picks it up off the floor with his claw and carries it over to the center desk, where Jarvis will be able to scan in the contents. JARVIS lets out a hum of acceptance.
“Guess I’m making you a new suit, then, Cap.” Tony finally says when he can’t stand it anymore and resolutely turns to look at Steve’s face. He keeps his frown hard, demanding Steve to say something, anything to that. Steve’s eyes widen even as he continues to stare at the far wall. His whole body looks coiled, ready to run back into the storm and Tony nearly dares him to do it.
When they reluctantly make it to the car, Tony drops him at the passenger side again. It takes too long for them to stop grinning at each other, to untangle their fingers. When Tony slides into the driver's seat, Steve can only control himself long enough for Tony to pull out onto the street. If Tony is bothered by Steve insisting they hold hands even for the short drive back, his grin certainly does a poor job at conveying it.
“Another!” Stark demands with a high giggle suddenly and she is broken from her reprieve as a shot glass is clanked down on the bar in front of her. She smiles indulgently on queue, letting the softness of this persona bleed into her movements as she leans forward to take the glass from him. His face is open and happy, voice loud in the empty room.
Steve does none of this, hasn’t done more than wrap his arms all the way around Tony’s waist to keep their chests pressed together. It feels great when he does, feels amazing when one of those big hands is pressing into Tony’s back while the other rubs circles into the dip just above his ass. He wants more though, he wants every single inch of Steve in a way that makes him feel nearly delirious.
Steve is just staring though, and he can’t let Steve think for even a second that Tony is just here for the hope of sex. He just can’t, because Steve is so very important. He is special and bright, lighting up every corner of Tony’s life in only their month together. Showing his soft underbelly is all Tony can do at this point and if he had to show it to anyone, well, Steve is the perfect person. He won’t stab it, he won’t laugh at it.
“Please tell me you are kidding.” Tony asks, even though he feels his entire body jittering at the other man’s concealed humor. Using his toes, he spins back in forth in the chair to release some of the happiness bumping around every bone in his body. God, why did he put this call off.
“Can’t believe you took me there on our second first date.” Steve tells him, giving into his pout with two quick pecks.
Steve looks away again, rubs a hand down over his face. “The whole team moved back in at your insistence and you’re down here ignoring all of us.”
“It’s okay, we don’t…” Tony tries to say, but then Steve is turning his hands to pull them out of Tony’s and running them back up his thighs. It’s not fair, not at all and Tony cannot be held responsible for his actions. He whines and grinds back into that deliciously solid hipbone, just for a second, not even enough to really be noticable. He can feel Steve’s fingers clutch again and takes a haggering breath to get some much needed oxygen back into his brain.
“We fucking did it. It fucking worked.” His voice is bouncing through the air as he turns to inspect the damage of their landing. The smile falls so far off his face, he hears it landing at his feet.
“He betrayed you! He did this-” Rhodey gestures at his chest before just collapsing against Tony again. This time Tony holds him up. That is always what they do; hold each other in turns.
He may abuse that ability abit. Everytime he knocks on the workshop door though, Tony grins at him like nothing on earth will ever be better than leftover pasta and Steve. It’s the happiest he’s been in a long time. Iron Man may have been his best friend, but they never got to see each other like this; never got to spend more days together than apart and it kept them both at a distance.
The feeling gets more intense as he takes in his surroundings, but the hazy memories are almost familiar at this point. He may never have stepped foot in this room, but he can guarantee there is a metal mint tray in Tony’s bedside drawer filled with his anxiety medication. It has the american flag on it and Steve gave it to him as a joke nearly eight months ago. He remembers painting the pair of Brooklyn city scapes behind the headboard of Tony’s bed, but never once has he seen them. For a moment, just a second, he thinks his missing jeans may be in the middle drawer of that second dresser.
“I like you, too.” Tony tells him with a chuckle, kissing his temple more firmly. Steve laughs back, though it’s a slow and far away thing. His smile is dragging back and forth across Tony’s skin and it could be ticklish if it didn’t feel so sweet. Tony just holds him closer, presses his face into his hair and relishes the wonderful feeling of Steve all around him, surrounding him from every angle.
“I’m sorry. It was just easier this way.” Tony is telling him, but Steve honestly cannot figure out what he is talking about. Who did he buy those gloves from Anna’s shop for? Why does he have reading glasses in his night stand drawer?
One observation does not prove a hypothesis. He is a scientist and the scientist longs for data. Yinsen doesn’t have to pull him to his feet, but does try to grab him when Tony lunges forward.
“Tony, shut up.” Steve all but yells at him. He is up on his feet now, scratching his nails against his scalp and drawling in a deep steadying breath. He can’t forgive him tonight, but he’ll let it go soon. This isn’t a grudge worth holding and more of it comes from his own strange problems than not being told. It wouldn’t be fair to let Tony hurt because Steve can’t figure out his own issues.
He can tell Tony has been lonely too, has been longing for this easy togetherness as much as Steve and it spurs him on. Steve makes him coffee in the morning and lunch whenever they both are in the Tower. He sits down in the workshop until they get hungry enough to order in or go see if Bruce will cook everyone a nice dinner. After a battle, he stays with Tony and makes sure nothing cut him too deep or hit him too hard. When things inevitably do, he sits by his bed or with him on the couch and brings him meals around the clock. The team has taken to teasing him relentlessly, but he can’t care. Being with Tony makes sense, it makes all his forgetfulness seem unimportant, it makes him outrageously happy.
“You want to?” Tony blurts, still not back to full functionality. This is going somewhere, somewhere Tony honestly did not see coming when Steve came over to have frozen pizza and play video games. His body is thrumming, all the coiling heat from before is back in full force, rushing through his veins like a straight shot of adrenaline.
“That’s good to hear.” Steve replies with a smile and finds he really means it. He knows they’ve been a bit of a hold out on the global green energy Initiative Stark Industries is spearheading with the U.N. He knows how stressed Stark has been about it for the last months, it certainly seemed to be enough to bleed down into Iron Man. They both try to keep S.I. business separate from the Avengers, but Iron Man always ends up confiding in Steve when Stark gets super overworked and starts taking it out on him.
They all helped with the clean up for the first few days, getting the city to a point where SHIELD and government agencies would be able to begin long term repairs. But, no one was comfortable with the newfound mega fame and it was no sooner that Thor flew back to Asgard that they all part ways. Tony convinced Bruce to stay with him in the still livable parts of the Tower, but everyone else scattered in the wind.
“Like a warm bath and drinking honey. I hurt so bad, everywhere. From welding and sleeping on rocks and getting beat around.” He answers, but her mind is already reeling through the possibilities, rifling through every bit of intel she possesses on this man. “And suddenly, I just didn’t hurt anymore. All of it was gone.”
“So fucking good to be back buddy.” He finally crokes out, moving from the front door and into the familiar house. This place was always one of his favorite homes and seeing it standing up from the cliffs edge had tugged painfully at his chest. In the low light of evening, it feels even more like a dream now than the late delirious nights in the cave. He shoves a hand in the bag slung over his shoulder and clutches at the papers to remind himself of the reality.
“Sure.” Iron Man replies easily enough, but even through the voice modulator Steve can make out an under current of hesitation. He takes a breath and looks at the indistinct expression of the faceplate until Iron Man brings a hand up in a gesture of ‘go on’.
Yinsen is as much an inspiration as Tony always remembered and that is such a bone deep comfort he finds himself holding back tears some nights at just how much he came to fail this man. At how much Yinsen would actually believe Tony had tried his very best. The problem of Yinsen is one he spends many hours considering, more than he thinks a decent person ever would. Because, see, Yinsen wanted his death, wanted to martyr himself for his lost family and hope in Tony. Even though Tony knows Yinsen’s hope is horribly misplaced with the certainty  he predicted all those years ago, it seems almost cruel to take that choice from the man.
“Yeah?” He calls when it looks like Tony will continue to stare at the workbench for the rest of the day if he doesn’t say something.
“I have a really big bed, and stupidly expensive sheets.” Tony tries and Steve blinks, possibly a good blink, Tony thinks a little hysterically. “Seriously, they are super soft and luxurious and way more than any person actually needs to sleep on, but I have my hangups and they are one of them. I bet I have shirts big enough for you, and I have underwear I’ve never worn, so you could just go straight to class.” Oh, jesus, he just offered to let Steve use his underwear. This is unraveling.
