I'm starting anger management classes tomorrow. I want to do this right. Hopefully Ella is right about this.
“Honestly John, I’m not sure.”
“No, don’t go into your mind palace. I know what it is. I’ve known all along, really.”
I really should have done this "talking about how I feel" thing earlier. He does love her. He wants to be a father figure to her. He wants to be her dad. I don't know why I find this so unbelievable, but here I am, staring at her as she sleeps thinking about her growing up with the two of us together. He assures me that this sacrifice is not self-harming so it doesn't count. I always thought taking aspects of The Work away from Sherlock would be the definition of harming him, but now I think losing me would be worse. I can't believe that I'm that important to him. I don't deserve him.
“An old bolthole?” John eyebrows his friend suspiciously.
John snorts. “Alright, sounds like a plan.”
I spent the following two years travelling the world tearing down Moriarty’s web bit-by-bit. It was an endless mission, one I was not sure I would ever finish. I considered settling down in the country and making a new life there, but I kept pushing, walking through the web, because I could not bare the thought of never returning to our flat again, of never seeing you again, John.
“-Nope,” John interjects. “If you make fun of this mustache one more time I’ll shove you right down these stairs and you’ll have to climb all the way back up by yourself,” he nudges Sherlock with his shoulder.
"Of course," he nodded. "Slitheens. Seems like a lifetime ago—well, it was. I had a different face, you were just a teenager—"
Sherlock jumped on the chair, obviously very pleased. The now familiar sound of the TARDIS filled the room.
John obeyed, but winced when he found that it made it even harder to keep them open a second time. "You didn't answer my question. What happens to you, right now, if I blink?"
"Which one?" Sherlock asked.
"Um, Sherlock," the Doctor said, holding up his hand, "I've noticed that when people are trying to get used to the concept of the TARDIS, they don't actually care about the science behind it. Yes, John, it's bigger on the inside."
He stared at Mr. Holmes, placing on hand on the man's arm. "You're going to get through this, you know. If anyone could pull through, you could. Then, you and me, we'll go have a pint together, alright? If you remember me. If you even have any idea who I am. You and your doctor, we'll go and have a drink together at Angelo's, that little bar across the street I told you about. We'll talk about detective stories, huh? I got married a few months ago. I know I didn't tell you, sorry. You couldn't get out in time to be my best man, but you could still be my best friend. Just wake up," he said, frowning. "Come on. Just wake up, give me a sign, anything."
John raised his eyebrows at the clock. "Good morning. Barely morning anymore, though."
"No," a voice answered him.
"Emergency, no time for explanations. Look after Sherlock for me, I trust you completely, apparently. I'll be back as soon as possible." He called. The box was already disappearing before he had a chance to answer.
"They are statues only when you see them," he said, his voice very quiet. "Close your eyes, or turn away, and they've got you. Lots of busy streets in London. I don't know why they're here—most likely an accidental shift into space-time. Whatever it was, they must be trapped here. Too many people out there, never time to sneak away without being seen."
"No," Sherlock said quickly. "John doesn't know about… I don't want him to know what I am."
"Do we have a treasure map?" he asked.
"Shields. They hold the air in. The TARDIS produces its own oxygen. It's a Gallifreyan atmosphere but it's perfectly safe for humans."
"Of course," the Doctor nodded. He tried to see around Sherlock to the body, but his son managed to be just in the way to block his view.
Sherlock didn't seem to have an answer. Rose stepped quite literally between her son and John Watson, patting the older man on the arm. "Well, Sherlock's right, that's enough star gazing. How about a trip to London in another year, then? Would you like to have a look at what your home a hundred years from now? Two hundred?"
John set his cup down on the table, glaring at Sherlock.
Sherlock frowned at him. "What?"
The windows of the Mind Palace were closed. The curtains were drawn shut tight, and not an inch of light filtered into small room Sherlock had set himself inside. He could not see the doors, but he knew they were all locked. No historical figures wandered the walls, spouting off random facts about their lives and accomplishments. He was fairly certain he'd laid out a comprehensive report on the different types of tobacco ash in another room, but he couldn't remember which one.
His eyes widened in shock. "We're gonna' eat him?"
Rose snorted.
"John," Mr. Holmes had muttered.
"No I don't."
"It's two hungry boys who ate your father's special surprise for tonight. I know banana cream is your favorite too, did you honestly think I wouldn't notice?"
"She's doing well, but she wishes we would visit the old flat more. We're going to get an earful for missing Christmas again."
"None," the Doctor said, pulling the instrument back into his deep, deep pockets. "Two hearts, the right one smaller than the other, but steadily beating. Have you been eating? Getting any sleep?"
"Why now?" she asked, waking up a bit and stretching. "Why today, first thing in the morning?"
"Okay, bedtime now."
He jumped, find another statue like the one from downstairs was suddenly only about four feet in front of him.
"With you, Sherlock. I can't expect every corner of the universe to be gumdrops and rainbows. Do not go to a hotel."
"No, Sherlock, behind you!"
"Where shall we camp?" Rose asked. "We could stay on Earth, maybe try another century with cowboys— or pirates, yes Sherlock. Mycroft, any preferences?"
John frowned. "You've just sent them to ask about his work schedule."
He lay still next to her, and if he were any other child she would have thought he was drifting off. She knew better—she could feel the little ridges in his forehead that meant he was deep in thought. She tried to rub them away, but she knew it was just a matter of time before he asked another question.
Sherlock ignored the question, sitting quietly across from his father. The Doctor smiled, pouring himself some tea. He knew something about caring for his friends.
"You're six years old. You can't go running into the forest by yourself. I'll come with you."
Breakbreakbreakbreakbreakbreakbreak
John stood in confused silence for a moment, then he patted Sherlock on the back gently. "You…you know you're my best friend. Right? Sherlock…you're my best friend."
"Wow," Rose smiled, peering into his hands. "Good job."
The Doctor took her hand gently. "You know, I picked this spot for a reason. It's a fairly small island, no big animals….plus he's got that watch we gave him for Christmas. You know, one button and the TARDIS locates him, just in case?"
Mycroft huffed.
"Not really."
"Yes. Do pirates go camping?"
"Rose!" she squawked pulling the other woman into a tight hug. "Oh, it's been ages!"
"Just keep your eyes on it!" Sherlock ordered, not breaking his gaze on the statue behind John. "Don't blink, John. Whatever you do, don't blink."
"What are you talking about? What can be so terrible?"
John flat out hugged him. He didn't mean to, but his heart was swelling with excitement. There were tears in his eyes. He heard Nurse Molly Hooper behind him, asking what was happening.
Mycroft stared at the boy, his mouth open slightly. "Sherlock? How old are you?"
"Good!" the Doctor said. "Sherlock!" he called into the TARDIS. "Come out here."
Sherlock looked back at the clock. "Any minute now."
"Oh thank God," Sherlock said hopping from the stool. "We've found something to do."
Of course it was a bit difficult for them to maintain both a steady home and a life on the TARDIS. The Doctor had offered to lock the box up for twenty years, to take some time off to be nothing but a family, but no one was happy with that idea. The boys were used to life as time travelers, and the idea of being stuck on one planet all the time bothered them even more than it did their father. They'd decided to have a place and attempt to be there as much as possible. They'd go see something extraordinary, then be back before bedtime. Well, usually. Well, once in a while.
"Um, are you sure you're okay? What was that for?"
Sherlock followed after him, still trying to solve the enigma John Watson presented.
"You haven't told him anything?" Rose asked.
"I'm tired. You can sleep in your room. I'll be okay," he muttered, his long eyelashes fluttering a bit.
"We go out together all the time. Besides, I'm not going out."
"Is this one of those hush-hush national security threats? You could have just sent a text at this point, I get it."
Sherlock gave her only a half-smile, but it looked genuine. John frowned, staring at the young woman. Sherlock had never mentioned having a sister. She could be a cousin, perhaps? He heard the door open again and a thin man stepped out, a wide grin spread across his face. His brown pinstripe pants and jacket seemed to elongate his already lanky frame, but it suited him. His hair was wild, a chock of brown wilderness that reflected the eccentricity on his face.
John smiled at him. "Yeah. Nothing important. Just stopping by to say hello."
John showered quickly as his kettle boiled, and then settled himself into his chair, ready to entertain himself for as long as Sherlock was mentally absent. To his surprise he had only just opened the paper when the other man spoke.
"Banana cream makes him puke."
"That…that's a secret too, Sherlock." They reached the door and the Doctor peered into the distance. "Mmm…that way. Go straight that way and you'll reach camp in no time. Send Redbeard ahead of you, he'll know where to go. Better hurry, if I remember right Mum's already looking for you."
The front door to the tavern burst open and a man huffed his way inside, obviously out of breath. His long mustache blended with the dim light of the pub, and he looked white as a sheet. "I need a constable," he called. "There's been a murder."
"Pirates eat fish," Mycroft grinned.
Sherlock was out of the room before his mother could protest. Rose sighed and started pulling ingredients down from the cupboards to remake the pie.
This is not an AU, it's just a theory (not one I would support or wish for because, ouch) about the strange world Sherlock lives in. It's kind of an alternative to how Series 3 could have started… if Moffat were more evil. Probably a one shot. I suppose another chapter may be possible.
"Here boy!" The Doctor called. "Come here Redbeard." The dog jumped up and trotted over to him, laying at his feet as he patted him. "There we go. Dogs always see right through regeneration."
"Who was shooting holes in the wall?" the Doctor asked suddenly with a frown. "Sherlock, a gun? Really? You should know better."
"They wouldn't eat Nemo," Sherlock insisted. "He's so blue he'd blend into the water and they couldn't catch him."
"No I'm not," he muttered. "My pole's just harder to hold."
"Who?"
"Oh, Sherlock," she called, "a young man stopped by to see you."
Thank you all so much for making it to the end! I love this version of Sherlock (especially when he's younger). If you'd like to read more be sure to check out A Childhood In The TARDIS. :)
"You just figured out I was a doctor. Aren't you going to tell me how you deduced that?"
"Who is your associate?" Mycroft called, making him pause.
"Mycroft has. Do you remember his bout with scarlet fever? No, I suppose you were a bit young. Anyway, if a human virus can affect him then you're both at risk." He moved the stethoscope to the other side of Sherlock's chest, listening much more intently.
"Not really," the other three said at the same time.
"How could you?" she asked again, louder this time. She grabbed his arm, pulling it out in front of him and sliding up his sleeve, showing the small pinpricks on the inside of his elbow.
Rosie nodded like she was starting to understand. “Ok so Daddy and you are not in love, you don’t kiss, and you don’t want to get married.”
“I, er…” Sherlock looked up and found John looking diffident and fidgeting with the hem of his shirt. “I tried to pick the most interesting ones but no matter how nice he is, Lestrade couldn’t let me spend too much time in there so maybe they’re not all great… Sorry but it’s quite difficult to find a present that you might remotely like…” John chuckled but Sherlock saw he was rather nervous.
All the tension was released from Sherlock’s shoulder the second she disappeared through the doors. He sighed and started heading back to Baker Street while typing a text to John.
However, there had been one afternoon when his luck had run out. It was on Wednesday. A group of people from his school had passed in the street and one of them had seen him through the large window. They spent at least 15 minutes laughing at the ‘grumpy freak who was working in a flower shop’ before an old lady came in and asked for flowers. After that, they went away and hadn’t come back. Well, for the moment.
“I have no idea how you got Mycroft to agree to give me this as a present from him, but I have to say I’m quite impressed.” He was. Didn’t mean he was pleased with the present. But he was impressed.
There was a rather awkward silence. They were still entangled in reproaches and unspoken words, so that their relationship had not recovered its spontaneity. He tried not to suffer, arguing on the one hand that it was a stupid weakness and on the other hand that John would inevitably come back to him. But he couldn't help doubting it slightly and that scared him. What if John could never truly forgive him? What if he couldn't look at him without Mary coming between them? What if... He had already explored the extent of John's possible reactions and didn't want to dwell on it again. Unnecessary and anxiety-provoking. Sherlock forced himself to focus on the present moment.
Sure, the doctor had suffered a lot in the last four years, but God forbid, he wasn't good enough to walk away and let John heal once and for all. He would rather keep their relationship as it was. If he had to hide his emotions, if he had to insist on remaining his best friend by watching himself and keeping him from understanding, he would. Yes, because that was all he could have, but also all he could offert to him.
Finally, Sherlock reached him and handed him the flowers. His hand was steady, but he had to make a lot of efforts to keep it that way. He was sure – 92% sure – he had read the situation right, but his confidence kept dropping with each passing second John was quiet. It was too late to retreat anyway.
Sherlock yelled back, “Don’t stand there if it bothers you!”
All the tension left Sherlock’s body and he couldn’t stop the relieved laughter from bubbling out of him. John looked sheepish and Sherlock felt a sudden surge of affection for the boy before him.
“Huh?” John’s hair was mussed, he looked utterly confused and it took him a few more seconds to form coherent words. “Right, I’m assuming you figured something out about the case,” He picked up the cup, gratifying Sherlock with the appreciative smile he was waiting for. “Aren’t you supposed to be working in the flower shop today?” He asked after taking a sip.
look quite scary. And Sherlock was not scared easily.
care a little about their opinions on the matter.
“Sherlock, I thought it was going to be a quick thing and you show up at 9 and it’s already dark and you’re-”
He was cold, he was soaked, he hadn’t been taken seriously (as always), and John was away on a trip with the rugby team (Sherlock selfishly hoped it was ruined by the weather, wherever they went) or some nonsense like that, until late in the evening. So he couldn’t loudly complain to anyone.
“You need my help to solve a murder even though I’m not even 17 and you’ve been at New Scotland Yard since the very beginning of your professional career?” This time, Sherlock did look up, only to find what he was expecting. Lestrade gritting his teeth to prevent himself from saying something that would discourage Sherlock to help him, still fidgeting with the lapel of his coat in a nervous kind of way.
The day after, John came by the flower shop after school just to chat with Sherlock while he worked alongside his father – he and John got on really well and it made Sherlock feel all warm.
“He is quite fat, isn’t he? I’m glad it’s not just me thinking it.” Eurus said after a few moments of tense silence.
“Alright, alright I get it but it’s simply a name you know? A word. Why don’t you just call me Sherlock like you always have?”
They both stared, until Sherlock spoke again (which he immediately regretted). “That wasn’t a question, you didn’t ask us anything Rosie.”
“-yes bring me along next time because you know if it wasn’t for me you’d die of starvation or about a thousand other ways-”
Sherlock wasn’t even listening anymore to John’s babbling. He needed to completely focus on the situation to react properly. It’s only when John lowered the flowers on the counter and his posture indicated he was going to leave that Sherlock finally thought of something.
“Okay. I’ll take you with me next time.”
Rosie interrupted her monologue. “Can we go to the park to get ice cream?” She asked turning her head toward Sherlock, already putting on her pouty face, knowing it’s her best weapon against Sherlock's weak heart. He knew that he would have to get her ice cream no matter what the weather was like.
Sherlock couldn’t disagree (well not entirely, Rosie was 6 and she was brilliant).
Not expecting the praise, Sherlock froze. “Do you think so?”
“Well
It went slightly wrong.
He was alone at the counter, cutting the damp stems of whatever flowers his mother had left him (alongside with a list of bouquets and precise instructions on how to make them, with
. He managed to pull himself together quickly and regain the use of his lungs. “Alright Dr. Watson-Holmes! Let’s get to work.”
“No Rosie, we said-“
“Okay,” Sherlock said getting up to join John and prevent him from breaking something because of all the waving and pacing he was doing.
It was Sherlock’s turn to be confused. However, he didn’t have much time to wonder what that incoherent babbling was about because John Hamish Watson’s bloody
“You are back from your adventures in good health I see, dear brother.” Mycroft was smiling tightly. John and Eurus looked up, their eyes going from Mycroft to Sherlock. When Sherlock met his friend’s eyes, he was rather relieved to find that there was no trace of anger in them.
Really, life was quite unfair. It was unfair that Mycroft never had had to work there. It was unfair that Eurus had to work less than him there. It was unfair that just because one of his experiments had set fire to a room, fire that he had under control and extinguished with a (according to his father, very expensive) rug, he had to work at his parent’s flower shop every day after school and would probably have to during the next break. Maybe it was the fact that he had tried to blame it on their cat that made his parents mad? It wasn’t fair anyway. Eurus worked on her own will every Saturday, so why couldn’t she take his shifts if she liked it so much? Didn’t make much of a difference if it was a 16-year-old boy or a 15-year-old girl working, did it?
“That’s okay I understand. Oh! By the way, I haven’t seen your husband in a long time, is he alright?”
“Shut up.”
“But why?!” She cried. “Papa would become my real father, I would have my own room, and besides-”
Rosie was buzzing with excitement, but Sherlock couldn’t picture himself talking about a job he didn’t do (
. Eurus was at the back of the shop, where Sherlock could hear but not see her rearranging whatever it was that they kept there (Sherlock had never gone there, it seemed a lot more exhausting to work back there), leaving him only with the company of the giant rubber fig that took as much space as an actual person.
When John got home, Rosie stopped calling Sherlock “papa” as they had established but she kept glancing at him knowingly as if she was very proud of their secret. At some point, Sherlock thought he saw John looking at both of them suspiciously like he knew what kind of false ideas his flatmate was putting in his daughter’s mind. This made the detective very nervous.
“Please!” And there it was, the adorable face only Watsons could pull off. He sighed in defeat and resigned himself to endure whatever Rosie had planned.
). “That’s not what people usually say.” He muttered.
) right after lunch before going out and do something more interesting than
John handed the bouquet to Sherlock and he began to wrap dark green paper around the flower and as he was about to fix it with a thin yellow ribbon – to match the flowers – on the middle of the stems, John spoke up again. “So, what are they?”
“What?” Sherlock asked without taking up his eyes off the bouquet while finishing tying the ribbon around it.
unfair. It was unfair that John was so close to him, yet so unattainable. It was unfair that John couldn’t see how much Sherlock loved him but saw it when the feelings were held by girls. It was unfair that Sherlock had to sit there and watch his best friend and the one person he ever loved this way pick flowers that had very much
Suddenly, John was sporting the widest smile Sherlock had ever seen on his friend’s face. “Sherlock I-” He let out a shaky breath. “I thought I missed my chance with you I - I thought I fuck-messed up everything…”
He tore the ugly wrapping paper and opened the brown carton box to reveal what he had expected. Inside were dozens and dozens of New Scotland Yard cold case files. Sherlock wasn’t surprised but he was very pleased with it. The most pleased he’s ever been when receiving something. He picked the first file and started reading it without even bothering to try to hide his smile.
John put the seemingly heavy box on the counter right before Sherlock but kept the other gift in his left hand. “All right,” John placed his hands on his hips and directed a satisfied smile at Sherlock. “I went through all kinds of troubles to get you that present so you might as well open it.”
If you forgot about how this terrible situation was possibly the worst thing that could happen to him, he had been quite lucky this past week when it came to the flower shop. When a customer came in, there was not much social interaction needed, and the few persistent and talkative ones had been quickly discouraged by his lack of investment in the not-so-much-of-a-conversation. He could just entertain himself by deducing their whole lives and secrets and then go back to doing flower arrangements that his parents had wrote down for him. Sherlock Holmes was many things, but an artist was not one of them. If he ever tried to make a composition of his own it would most definitely come out hideous.
were on his and every hope of lucid thoughts was lost forever in the deepest part of his Mind Palace, and all that remained was
“What a shame…” Sherlock said sarcastically and rolled his eyes while John and Eurus tried to stifle their laughter.
“Yeah John just has a busy schedule for now.”
He looked at Eurus, readying himself for another round of awkward feelings and half-faked gratefulness. She merely raised an eyebrow.
John sat back on the stool, still smiling at Sherlock as if he were the most wonderful thing he had ever seen. “They’re real flowers so they won’t last long but I’ll bring one to you regularly. You really look too fit with it.”
Since Rosie had come into his life, Sherlock had learned a lot about children. And one of those things was that it was impossible to have a real argument with them because most of the time, they didn’t even know what the argument was about or couldn’t care less about its topic as long as they got the end of it.
“What do they usually say?”
John recovered quickly than Sherlock because he was the one to talk next. “Rosie! We can’t get married! Why would you suggest that!” The doctor was chuckling nervously. Sherlock couldn’t even deduce anything about his friend’s thoughts about this very idea because he was too afraid. Afraid that his (almost) perfect little life might stop being so perfect in the span of a few seconds.
Sherlock stopped breathing at once hearing his and John’s name together and sounding so,
Sometimes, John would compliment him on his deducing skill or throw a flirty comment out in the air and Sherlock would only scoff and try to hide his blush while willing himself not to look too much into that and not ruin that wonderful friendship they had.
She gasped. “You’re in love with Daddy!”
“Why not?” She sounded genuinely bemused.
“No but that’s okay! I don’t have to be related to you to be emotionally attached to you, you understand?”
Sherlock saw the corner of his older brother’s lips twitch, but he managed to keep smiling falsely as if Sherlock hadn’t said anything.
He took a deep breath, tried not to think about John Watson seeing him in a dark green ridiculous apron and stood up quickly, making a bunch of flowers fall on the ground. He picked them up hurriedly and put them back under the counter with the rest of them.
The case turned out to be a quite ordinary murder with jealousy for a motive and someone being simply shot (couldn’t people be more inventive these days? And how could Lestrade be so blind? Even him should have seen all this) and not even the whole night had been necessary for it to be solved and closed.
Many more irrational thoughts came across his mind in the span of a few seconds. He realized once more that John Watson had change him in many ways, because he was one of the most rational people of the world and it was very unlikely for him to worry over someone. Well, unless it was John Watson.
It all happened so fast, even Sherlock’s mind hadn’t completely processed it yet. John Watson was becoming his best friend and Sherlock had never felt so complete.
Sherlock didn’t say anything. Not on how there was nothing to talk about and not on how John was apparently staying in his room for the night. John thanked her and wished her goodnight too. Sherlock could tell his parents were also charmed by John Watson. No one could resist him. Sadly, the whole school shared this opinion.
Oh well, John Watson knew his name, apparently. Sherlock nodded too scared his voice would betray him and crack mid-word.
With this thought, he went back to adding flowers-related information to his Mind Palace.
) in front of a bunch of judgmental kids. “I’m sorry but um… I’m very busy at the moment,” that was a big lie considering it’d been months since he had been offered a truly interesting case “but surely I’ll find time at some point… Eventually…” He wasn’t planning to “find time” for anything that would remotely involve him with dozens of six-year-olds.
let go of Sherlock’s hand. During the last five minutes of walking that would lead them back home, Sherlock hoped and
It was perfect.
John Watson had decided to come to his parents’ flower shop. And Sherlock was hiding under the counter of the said flower shop. Guess his luck really had run out.
Later this day, after John had gone home, Sherlock picked up the mop and cleaned the floor for the first time since he started working at the flower shop. But it wasn’t to thank his parents for the small celebration. And if they saw it like that, then it was a big misinterpretation and their problem, not Sherlock’s.
“Hi, Sherlock!” He said cheerfully.
Life was very unfair. It was unfair that no one believed he was capable of doing things right. It was unfair that no one thought he was the cleverest person in London and probably in the world (except John, John always told him he was the cleverest person he’s ever met). It was unfair that the DI (Gavin? George? Gary? Lestrade) was listening to those two idiots instead of him when clearly, he knew better than them.
“You were easier to convince than I expected,” John narrowed his eyes suspiciously and got closer to Sherlock. “What are you planning?”
It turned out to be the sister of the victim, who, in a fit of jealousy over her brother’s successfulness, had shot him in the head. The murderer was doing an internship with the forensic scientists and that’s how she managed to access the corpse to pin the note to it – the note wasn’t really relevant, it only confirmed Sherlock’s opinion on how most murderers want to get caught. And when the police found her flat, they also found evidence that she was planning on killing other people. Real nice lady.
“And today, Mark told me he wanted to be my boyfriend because he loves me. But he’s also my best friend. So I told him I wanted him to stay my best friend. But I wasn’t mad.” They were all sitting on the sofa eating sandwiches (the kitchen table wasn’t available for the moment due to an experiment that ended badly (well in John’s opinion at least). Sherlock was only half listening to what the little girl was saying but the question she asked made him choke on his tuna sandwich. “Daddy, would you be mad if your best friend wanted to be your boyfriend like Mark asked me today?”
“I have to ask you something, Daddy, Papa,” Sherlock’s eyes widened at the use of that nickname in presence of John. One quick look to the man across from him was enough to tell him he wasn’t the only one startled by it. Whatever was happening that couldn’t be good. “I want my own room.”
He was startled by his sister coming into the shop to water some of the plants. “I’m surprised you didn’t shag right here on the counter.” Eurus always had the most neutral expressions even when saying things like that. “And they were calla lilies and wallflowers. If you ever want to impress him or something.”
Still, it had made John happy for a few hours so really, Sherlock didn’t even mind.
“He didn’t know you were going to be gone more than two hours Sherlock,” John didn’t appear to be very amused. “and the second thing you could do is bring me along. You probably don’t really need me for anything else than keeping you alive but leave me a note or something next time. Hell, Sherlock, break into my flat if you have to, tell my parents to pass me on a message if I’m not there, but don’t go running off like you did today!”
The detective raised an eyebrow. Apparently, John had been showing sappy movies to his daughter. He smiled at that thought, it was such a John Watson thing to do. “Yes I guess you can say it’s like that.”
“Because.”
Sherlock was taken aback. He definitely wasn’t expecting that. He wasn’t even sure he understood the question. “What do you mean?”
“That’s amazing, really, no one likes Mr Harris and Chris is an absolute prick. It was nice not to hear his idiotic comments for once.”
be what John had actually said. If the volume and the meaning of the words John had spoken had him sure he had misunderstood, the determined look on his friend’s face made him reconsider. He managed to squeak a quiet and pathetic “what”. Every bit of elaborate vocabulary had run away from his perfect mind.
They walked home, Rosie in the middle holding one of Sherlock’s hands and one of John’s. The doctor kept smooching Sherlock wherever he could reach to annoy his daughter but Sherlock knew that it was also because he wanted to. Which brought ridiculous warmth into his chest.
“We too have something for you,” His father smiled and handed him a dark blue scarf. Sherlock looked at his parents puzzled. “Since you are going to be running around London and God knows where else, we figured it would be better for you not to get sick every time.”
“Thank you…”
Sherlock cautiously unwrapped it – it really seemed fragile. Next thing he knew, he was holding smallish blue flowers paired with tiny white ones, arranged and fixed in a circle. And he was
“Do you know anything about the flower language?” John asked from Sherlock’s bed on a Friday evening.
“Something new came up, right? What is it? A note signed by the killer. That’s it isn’t it?”
Rosie was happily telling Sherlock how her teacher had promised them to talk to them about dinosaurs today. The man was nodding or humming from time to time, only half listening to the little girl’s happy babbling and trying to get her to walk faster. He wasn’t fully awake yet. See, the previous day, he had told John he would take Rosie to school because the doctor had to be at work earlier than usual (which would happen on regular basis). But he had also kind of forgot about it until his phone had chimed and revealed a text from John himself asking if they were on their way. Luckily, Rosie was much more responsible and had set an alarm on her own, so she was already up and almost ready when Sherlock had burst through the door of his bedroom in complete panic. Not that surprising since it wasn’t the first time it happened. He often had to take Rosie to school since John and her moved (back) in 221b Baker Street.
confused. He looked up at John and raised an eyebrow.
“Alright…”
The bell chimed and John Watson disappeared in the street. Sherlock let out a sigh. If it was a relieved one or a Victorian-heroine-worthy one, he didn’t know and wouldn’t tell if he did.
“Oh good then.”
She stopped moving to look back at him. “Why?”
“Yes I can see that by the colour of, well, most of the furniture in the kitchen.” John chuckled.
“Ah yes, I uh… I tried to bigger doses than the ones recommended. Had to make it a little more interesting.”
important secret. Like in that spy movie remember? Spies have to keep secrets so let’s play spies.” Sherlock had learnt kids would listen better if you made a favor sound like a game or something that interested them at least a little.
he was supposed to say.
“I hope you’re not planning on leaving the shop without cleaning that.” She said flatly, gesturing to the splotches of mud and the small lake forming on the floor close to the counter. Sherlock merely grunted at her without once stopping his pacing, which only worsened the floor’s state.
“-you’re both in love! Papa even told me he loved you! That’s how it works right? People who are in love get married!”
After a while, other kids stopped picking on him and calling him names for no reason. Yet, John had never admitted having anything to do with this, but Sherlock knew better.
to do something, but his body wouldn’t respond to his screaming brain.
in John’s eyes.
“Not the same way as people who get married do.”
, he wanted to say. But it wasn’t fair. It wasn’t fair to John and he knew it. Yet, he couldn’t imagine a future where John wasn’t by his side and had found someone else (again).
“Yes, Detective Sherlock Holmes!” Rosie answered as solemnly, with a grave expression (she was taking the situation very seriously). She was wearing the same attire as Sherlock, only the pans of her lab coat were dragging on the floor and the sleeves were rolled up.
He took the food his mother was handing him with a muttered ‘Ta’ and ate most of it, leaving some only because of his principles.
When Sherlock had arrived with Lestrade, the two idiots from earlier in the day had greeted him with repulsed looks and protestations. However, this time, the DI had simply ignored them and kept on listening to Sherlock unloading all the information he could deduce.
For once in his life, Sherlock was clueless as to what he was supposed to do next. Luckily, John was not as lost as him. Before Sherlock could think too much about what to say or do, John settled a hand on his hip and another on the back of his neck. He gently brought Sherlock’s face close to his own and pressed his slightly chapped lips against Sherlock’s.
to keep working in the shop. It used to be a punishment and wasn’t supposed to last that long. But since he started working there, things had changed, and Sherlock had trouble imagining his weeks without his shifts in the flower shop in the company of John and the giant rubber fig no one wanted. He didn’t complain about it anymore, and his family was clever enough not to mention it, knowing it would cause Sherlock to get defensive about it. But he would
She opened her mouth to say something else, but someone was coming to close the doors, so he gently pushed her towards the entrance and muttered a rapid “have a nice day, bye” as she jogged almost eagerly towards her school.
John sighed and lowered his gaze again. “Well she’s been asking me about people being in love and… and how her friends have two parents and…” John didn’t finish his sentence. Something he did too often if you asked Sherlock.
The rest of the day dragged on fairly slowly for Sherlock he spent most of it mixing chemicals on the kitchen table (which resulted in one of John’s jumpers having a huge hole in its front). Soon he found himself waiting in front of Rosie’s school among parents and nannies. She arrived quickly, her blonde ponytail bouncing up and down with every step she took. Sherlock carried her small backpack for her (like every time he’d picked her up) and held her tiny hand in his much bigger own to avoid losing her in the crowd of people that surrounded the school. The little girl started explaining things about dinosaurs (creatures that seemed to be her main interest at the moment) to Sherlock and she took this job very seriously.
John’s gaze (still fixed on Sherlock’s) silently asked if all of this was true. Sherlock could only nod, not trusting himself to speak any more than he already had.
There were moments like that, during which Sherlock almost believed John would return his feelings. That he would be favourable to including Sherlock in his family. It happened when he was looking at Sherlock like he was doing right then, his eyes full of tenderness, fondness and dared he believe, love.
Sometimes, John would reproach him to be too unpleasant towards the customers and lack social skills, before explaining to him how he could act with them instead – things that Sherlock deleted immediately after hearing them.
“What are you on about Sherlock?” John was looking directly into Sherlock’s eyes, his gaze full of incomprehension and… hope?
And if he had not-so-accidentally set fire to the rug in a hallway with the same experiment that had got him working in the flower shop in the first place, and got him there a second time for a much longer span of time, well no one had the right to assume anything.
“You work in a flower shop and you don’t know what flower you sell? What a terrible florist you are, Sherlock Holmes…” John shook his head and laughed softly.
Right when he arrived at his locker, he heard someone call his name and before he could dwell too much on the fact that it wasn’t the usual ‘freak’ or eventual ‘poof’, John Watson appeared smiling right in front of him. Even a little too close.
With that, Sherlock pulled a small stool near the kitchen table for Rosie to stand on it and got behind her.
“I understand if you don’t feel the same! I’m not waiting for anything in return I just needed you to know,” John’s features were full of sadness and worry and Sherlock couldn’t stand it. He
John sat up. He looked down at his trembling hands with a slightly surprised look on his face and hid it in his fingers.
Sherlock closed his mouth. He could accept that he would have to keep quiet again and that he would not have the last word. He hadn't stayed for himself.
"Stay. Take a chair. Mary wants..." He pursed his mouth. "We need to talk."
"God, I feel like my skull is going to split in two! Turn that off and open... Open the shutters."
Sherlock stood in front of the sink. Everything was going well, until he closed the medicine cabinet after taking the tube of medicine and met his eyes in the mirror.
"John, I..."
Sherlock reached out to rest his hand briefly on his knee. He squeezed hard, awkwardly, hoping that the gesture he had seen so often would make John understand that he shared his pain.
His pupils were slightly more dilated than a moment before. His fingers tightened around his wrist and he flinched as he felt John's pulse quicken.
He came back to John, carefully avoiding the heavy sofa that blocked his path and refraining from answering, with his usual frankness, that his birthday had only been an excuse to try to drown his pain in beer.
The intensity of the joy that overtook him surprised him. He put his hands on the cold ceramic and continued to look at himself. He who had scoffed at the irrational and debilitating love, convinced that he felt none of the illusory needs it was supposed to be able to fulfill, was absurdly happy that John loved him.
Sherlock smiled.
Sherlock didn't appreciate affection, whereas John was an emotional bunker. Sobbing and cuddling were far from commonplace between them.
Was that why John felt so guilty? Because he felt he hadn't loved Mary as deeply as he wanted?
"I'm not really... Good at this, and you're not exactly helping me."
Grief, almost pain, took him by surprise. He had to go and sit on the bed for a moment. Then he rested his chin on the edge of his clasped hands and closed his eyes, listening to the silence of his flat.
"No. It's true."
He took a deep breath when Sherlock could hardly contain himself from answering.
"Do you really think so?" John asked in a broken voice, hope in his eyes.
Sherlock knew that he was incapable of giving John what he needed in a more tender relationship. He was not cut out to be a caring lover. He was too impulsive and often too indifferent to what did not concern him. There would inevitably be a time when his contrarian ways would become unbearable, or he would forget one too many times that he had to listen to someone else's needs. For if one can accept certain things from a friend, these same things become intolerable from a lover. And even if he... It would be a mistake to try something that is inevitably painful and doomed to failure.
This letter is becoming enormous; I have wasted enough of your time. I should stop stalling and get to the final point.
"Git. Anyways, I was thinking of having a nice romantic night. I know you aren't too keen on movies, but you can either pick one and point out all of the inaccuracies or, maybe just relax with me on the sofa. In my arms?"
“So,” John began
“Us? Old? Never,” Sherlock replies, earning a smile from John. “However, that mustache is doing you-”
. But you keep doing this.”
“Yeah, well you know, bad memories.”
John gets quite the surprise.
I’m sorry, Sherlock,” John blubbered, tears now rolling down his cheeks.
"You went to the moon and back to come back home. To me."
Sherlock walks over to him, grabs his wrist, heaves him off the couch, and embraces him. John melts into his chest.
“All I’ve wanted all these years was for you to do those things, utilize those outlets like ordinary people. That is what’s been missing this entire time. That’s the gap, the variable. That’s why I am never happy,” John accepts.
“Honestly though, she’s been great,” John insists. “Really. Really great. Great! She’s amazing! Brilliant! She keeps me on my toes and pushes me.” He pushes his arms forward in demonstration. “Sometimes she’s a bit much but I need it, ya know? I mean, in comparison to chasing a criminal around the entiiire city of London, dealing with her is no biggie,” he jokes. “But she keeps me on top of my game. Tippity top. Stops me from going back into That Place. It’s good, yeah? I love her. Really! I do.”
“So this is what the other side of Big Ben looks like, huh?” John looks up, eyes reflecting the glow of the clock face.
“Yeah, great. You’re doing great.” John smiles politely.
“Of course.”
Is calling Sherlock every day against the rules? I don't think he knows either and he made the rules, the git. I suppose it's fine, we're still getting space to ourselves and that was the whole point, right? I'm not smothering him or anything.
Sherlock quirks an eyebrow at him.
Sherlock’s brows furrow as he watches his friend.
“Today I want to re-acquaint myself with London. This walk has made it apparent to me that I am not used to it anymore: the people, the noises. What once faded into the background now seems jarring.”
John walks over and sits at the edge of the bed, laughter dwindling. “So,” he begins conversationally, “Can’t sleep?”
"Just text her. Phone her. Do something while there's still a chance because that chance doesn't last forever. Trust me, Sherlock. It's gone before you know it. Before. You. Know it," John scolded.
John huffs and stares straight forward, his mind should be racing, he should be grieving, worried for himself, for Sherlock. He should feel sick and yet he feels nothing. He thinks nothing. His mind is blank.
“It’s okay.”
“Yes well clearly you were wrong.”
“We’re getting old,” John states once he catches his breath.
“Maybe we’ll all go on cases together- Oooooo! Wouldn’t that be fun?”
“Okay, deal. So what are we doing today?”
He kicks off his shoes and walks down the hall. As he glances at the door on the left his arm reaches for the handle on the right. John sighs.
"Thank you." Sherlock walks over to the kitchen, pulls out a beaker, and fills it with water to make a makeshift vase. "So what all does 'doing this right' entail?" he inquires.
Their hearts begin to mirror one another, contracting, relaxing, expanding, and contracting once more in synchrony.
“Yeah.” John lifts his hand to the back of his neck. “Sorry ‘bout that. Just a lot to, you know, process. Didn’t want to do it here.”
Shout out to SunshineGlow for talking to me about this fic and inspiring me to keep on writing!!! <3
“Haven’t exactly had the time to get around to it, John.”
God I'm being ridiculous I should just call him and ask to come over and get this on with. There's no reason I should be writing a goddamn script. I'm just so bad at these things.
Lowkey this chapter doesn't include anything we talked about but it'll come up eventually; I promise! This is more focused on just getting to know Mary's character and covering the scene I set up from the last chapter.
“Yes!”
"Wait," Sherlock urged. "I need to show you something."
“Wait- don’t tell me!” Mary exclaims as she taps her fingers in concentration. “Boomerang!” She exclaims, eyes set alight. “It was a boomerang! Right?”
Do not feel the need to forgive me. I just need you to know this, all of this.
John turned back around. "Okay then, what is it?" John questioned.
Y'all I have literally 0 plans for this story at this point so if anyone likes this concept and has ideas shoot your shot lmao. Chapter ideas, scene ideas, an outline for this mess- I'll take it! Just let me know and tell me how you want to be credited if I decide to do it. If no one has ideas I'm sure I'll eventually be hit with some inspiration and finish this fic tho so don't worry.
"Look, I know you're eager and I know we've been doing a whole lot of talking and nothing else but this is important. You'll like it."
Hey Sherlock, can we talk about something serious for a second? It's been a decent amount of months now and I know that isn't super long in the grand scheme of things but I think I'm ready. I want to come home. I might still have outbursts or bad days, but I've been doing a lot better. I swear on my life I will never, ever, lay hands on you again. And as for my bad days, I know you get them too so maybe we can help each other? We'll know what to say and what not to say. I may never again be the younger man you fell for, I certainly have a lot more baggage now, but I'm doing good. Real good. And you seem like you are too. If you disagree then that's okay, I'll wait for you.
John's hand reflexively moved to his eyes as he turned his head away. "Jesus, Sherlock what are you-"
“Some sort-!” John glances back at Sherlock and pauses-“Yes. Yes you do owe me an apology. And an explanation of how you did it. How you didn’t tell me and let me grieve for two whole bloody years. And maybe, while you’re at it, you can explain where the fuck you’ve been.”
“Yes it was. I told you I am responsible for my own actions. Me hurting you? Yeah, that’s not okay. Ever. Okay?” John breathed into Sherlock's shoulder.
“The emptiness,” John cuts in.
“Well that’s familiar.”
“Green checkered shirt. Brown belt. Jeans. Navy socks.” His breathing begins to slow. “And a, quite frankly, horrible mustache.”
"A movie, how riveting. Is that all John Three-Continents-Watson has in mind?"
“Ahem. Right, well,” John began with no follow-through.
“John, your affection for me is clouding your judgement. It is clear, if you look at the
“Don’t worry about it, John.” Sherlock waves his hand in dismissal and stands up with a flourish, wobbling slightly. He extends his hand out to his friend. “You ready?”
This is so dumb, why can't I just see him already? Why can't we be together? It's been years. We've been in love for years. And we still haven't done anything about it. Still.
“Doesn’t seem like she is. She keeps making the same mistake over and over,” John scoffed.
“Yes, well she certainly isn’t like the usual morons you fraternize with.”
“Yes. Well I would use, chase criminals around London, and play the violin. Of course, since I met you they are no longer needed for that purpose and now I turn to them for… other things.”
She simply states “Fair enough.”
“No. I’m fine,” Sherlock replies. “I want to finish what we started.”
“How could you possibly know that,” came a deep rumble.
John sighs. “So that’s it? You met me and you felt… things?”
"Right, well then I better get back to Rosie. See you tomorrow." John pivoted towards the door and began walking.
“Yeah. Me too.” He takes another swig. “But hey,” he elbows Sherlock, probably a little harder than intended, “you’re back now! Sherlock Holmes and John Watson back on another adventure. Assassins and crime lords and gun fights! Running through the streets of London. Your lanky arse leaving me behind because you’ve got the impulse control of a toddler, and me running to catch up. It’s back! Or at least it will be soon.”
“Because I love you,” Sherlock sobbed. “Romantic love is more intense than anything I have ever felt before and I don’t know what to do. I don’t have the outlets most people have for their sentiment since you are not… gay. And so I did what I normally do, self-destruct.” The words are being pulled out of his chest. It hurts. It hurts more than he expected and he leans even more into John. It shouldn’t be this hard. John knew already; it wasn’t difficult to deduce he read the letter and he almost said it himself mere seconds ago. Yet all the muscles that make up his heart are pulling, straining.
I love you.
"Please, Sherlock. We have to be better. For her. For us." John clenched his left fist, his arms straight at his side.
"Right, ahem, well still." John tugged at his button down and straightened his back. "You have a chance to find someone and be with them. Mine is over."
"I say all that. I tell you everything. And you close yourself off?"
“I mean, yeah, but it isn’t like what you think. I know you are still you and we’re good-ish and I can be honest around you I just…”
Sherlock was supposed to help Rosie with her science fair project but doesn't come home.
“So this has nothing to do with you. It’s me.”
“So basically, she’s doing experiments and doesn’t care that she’s making a mess because she knows I will just clean after her and do whatever she wants anyways?”
"That doesn't even mean anything," Sherlock retorted.
Sherlock sighed. "As I think I have explained to you many times before, romantic entanglement, while fulfilling for other people-"
on her, Sherlock. She is dead and she was perfect and I cheated on her.”
"Those are for me…?" Sherlock asks, motioning toward the large bouquet of white roses in John's hands.
“It still acts up sometimes!,” John retorts.
Sherlock considers that maybe he should be nicer to John’s probably-going-to-be-wife. However, he also couldn’t be arsed to do so.
Sherlock eyes John, his John, up and down. He takes in the man in full, his soldier posture showing that he is still uncomfortable with this kind of blatant admission. His shoulders slightly less stiff than usual, evidence of his improvement. His smile indicating he is proud of himself for making it this far. His eyes, proof. Proof that he means it. That he wants this. Sherlock didn't have any doubts that this is what they wanted, not after the months they've talked, but he never saw it in such a concrete matter. Never heard such a declaration.
"I don't want to," Sherlock asserted.
"Oh." Johns eyebrows raised, his face becoming less tense. "So... you mean…" John hesitated.
“John-” Sherlock began, unsure of what to say next.
"But you...I…" John tried, stumbling to find the words, looking into himself finally begin to realize...
“Hmmm. So there’s no way they met him at a shared job or through friends?” Mary muses.
“I can’t believe you’re back. I mean I can- I do believe- I just- I went so long thinking I’d never see you again,” John mumbles.
“Yep,” John replies, feeling his body growing tense once more.
"That's why I had to die, John. That's why you had to think...If they realized you weren't mourning they might have..."
“Does it?” Sherlock quirks a brow.
The gentle rhythm of their breathing becomes pronounced in the otherwise silent room.
“That’ll do,” Sherlock replies. “Thank you,” he mutters.
“Actually,” John paused. “This is asking way to much from you, you never wanted this,” John muttered.
They walk side-by-side mixing in with the crowds as they cross the street. Sherlock eyes each building as they go, scanning the mix of romanesque stonework and modern fixtures. He watches tourists as they pass by, a mother yelling at her son to slow down and stay with her, a couple pointing at a map of the underground with puzzled expressions, a tour group traveling tightly in a pack. He scans the stands set up on street corners selling tacky London-themed trinkets. He watches commonplace events and beholds buildings they had passed a thousand times before with a sense of reverence, discovery, and perhaps hesitance. His eyes flicker from coaches to cars to crowds as they buzz and rattle around him.
“This is ridiculous,” Sherlock grumbles as he flops back down and rolls over, covering his face with a pillow.
Sometimes, I still worry I will never be happy. That this is all for nothing.
“Yeah. Yeah, thanks.” John takes another swig. “Ya know, there’s this funny thing really that I did. Before I asked her to marry me. I went to Baker Street. Went into the old flat. Our flat. I wanted to ask for your permission,” John scoffs, “as if you were here. As if I need your permission to marry someone. It was just a- a silly little thing. That I did. Not quite sure why.”
“I mean… okay, so the answer is ‘no’ and I know that yeah, wouldn’t exactly say either of us are okay, but are you… I don’t know,” John stated lamely.
"Maybe."
“Mmmmm. And a fiancé, then?”
John grins. “Oh she definitely does. Isn’t that something? I think she’s the first one of my girlfriends that doesn’t want you dead.” He pauses. “Maybe that’s a sign that I made the right decision, ya know, that she’s the one.”
Never. Sherlock jolts slightly. Never forgive.
“Ha, yeah they’re gonna be pissed to have you back flaunting around and showing off and being all mysterious all the time,” John smirks. “But no, seriously. It’s going to change their worlds Sherlock. You changed my entire world today. Don’t you know that?”
it hurts you and yet you still do this shit. I thought that after you left and when you saw the impact those two years had on me you would realize how important you are. Or at least you’d realize how important you are to
Sherlock slumps forward. “John I- I will. I promise. All in due time.”
“You’re doing a look,” he stated.
. I’m a broken man,” John murmurs, nuzzling into his chest. “I went a fortnight feeling nothing at all and then
“But then you wanted more. What changed? That variable holds the solution to the conundrum you’ve presented to me.”
“You’re right.”
They sit on the concrete floor and Sherlock removes the golden brown bottle from the bag, taking a swig and passing it to John. They continue to share the drink for some time and partake in their usual banter. There are large moments of silence between them that are at first quite comfortable. However, the tone shifts the more they drink, morphing into something darker as repressed thoughts slug their way upwards to consciousness.
“Right.”
“They’re your friends, Sherlock. I know neither of us like talking about those sort of things but you don’t need to go into any details. I think eventually you should tell them- and me- more about what happened, but for now if they ask just say you’re staying with me and you’re taking a break from work. They’ll understand.”
Sherlock’s chest tightens. “It wasn’t a test, John. Just a distraction.”
“Aha! Brilliant! He was a cabbie!” Mary grins, looking towards Sherlock for affirmation.
When they reach the top and turn the corner, rays of sunshine filter through a massive, circular, glass face encased in a very familiar cast iron frame that illuminates a narrow hallway.
“A cabby indeed. And quite a lousy one at that.”
John is prepared for this and resists the motion, bracing himself on the wall, and surprised at his own apparent strength as Sherlock struggles to move his arm.
Sherlock steps down onto the stair behind John outside his body, opens his fist, twists his hand around John’s loosening his grip, drops John’s arm by his side which releases his grip entirely, and walks behind John, down several more steps.
“No. No one knows.”
“Exactly! And I have a bum leg and you are in no shape to be making this climb either. You really couldn’t have chosen anywhere else to go? A bolthole on the ground floor perhaps?”
“John it has occurred to me that maybe I owe you some sort of apology,” Sherlock says with a sad grimace. His eyes shine up at John.
. It was perfect. I wasn’t happy.”
"Explain, Sherlock. Right. Now," John choked.
“A woman with the key owed me a favor. Stopped an ex of hers from murdering her and her husband.”
“It’s okay. You were grieving and I almost
“Another reason why I will forever be indebted to her,” Sherlock reasons.
Sherlock grabbed johns forearms and stepped back to look him in the eye.
with you and I didn’t see it. I had no idea when you bloody
Sherlock stiffened, managing the strength to raise his head and read John's face as he talked. "When I was away I needed to destroy Moriarty's web. I couldn't risk coming back to Baker Street until this was done in case there was a chance that… well I'm sure you can deduce that on your own. So I spent two years wandering the world, dismantling pieces of the web one by one until...Serbia. I'm sure you can-" he gestured vaguely back at John.
“How’s that… going?”
John let go of Sherlock and stepped back to observe his face. His heart and mind were racing as he wondered if he made a terrible mistake. Sherlock was completely unmoving, paralyzed. John had seen him do this before, but that was of little comfort given how much of himself he just put on display. He wanted to run, to walk out, go home to Rosie, but he knew if he did he could never come back. He could never face Sherlock after this. So he waited.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I’m… not sure. I’m not sure if I’m ready for everything to go back to normal just yet.”
“I don’t know.”
“With her.”
Do I even remember the last time I wrote anything? Nope. Do I remember the plot of this fic? Kinda. Did I reread this fic to make sure this chapter made sense? Nah. Let me know if I messed anything up terribly lmao. Also every comment adds a year to my life so talk to my lonely quarantined ass pls
you and the life I wanted to live. We had a nice house together, we were married, we had a baby, and yet she let me go on cases. Hell, she encouraged me to. It was the best of both worlds: I could live an ordinary life without feeling so
Rose turned around—then quickly covered her mouth so she wouldn't laugh. Sherlock stood in the doorway in thick camouflage pants and a ruffled shirt. His favorite trifold pirate hat he'd gotten for his sixth birthday hung off the side of his face slightly. He was small for his age, and as thin as he was you'd think he never ate.
"Yep," the Doctor said with a smile.
"Nope."
His mother pulled up the side of the tablecloth and smiled at him. "What are you doing under there?"
Now he was creeping slowly through the dimming twilight, following the beeps as they grew louder and steadier. Something was out here. His heart started to beat faster as he approached the shed out behind their house. His feet slowed. He heard voices coming from the shed.
"Nowhere special," he shrugged without turning to look at her. "Just a little forest planet I know of. It's warm all year, no mosquitoes, and it has plenty of open space."
William Sherlock Scot Holmes smiled in his sleep.
The little boy ran into the room, taking in the basic patterns of the walls and simple furniture buried under the mountain of papers and books. He seemed to be looking for something very specific.
"The one that's wrong?"
"A tie on the doorknob. It's a warning to your roommate. Specifically, 'I have a girl in here, don't interrupt'."
"Good morning, Mycroft," Rose smiled, ignoring his grumbles. Every thirteen year old decided that his parents were dumb and his life was boring, it didn't matter if his life was extraordinary and his father was a hyper-intelligent alien. They'd decided to just ride out this phase, he was usually polite about his grievances anyway.
Sherlock looked up excitedly. There was John, sitting across the dark flat in his chair by the fireplace. "John," Sherlock said, running across the room and falling to the floor in front of John's chair. He grabbed at his friends knees. This wasn't right, it wasn't like him. He was supposed to be cold and logical, but he was neither here. "John, you're here. John, I jumped off a building, but I'm still here. I'm so confused. Nothing makes sense here. It looks like our flat, but the lights are going out around me, John. Can I go to sleep now, John?"
"Exactly. It's a little bit different, but it's beautiful. That's our family. We're just one family in billions of others, but we're special in a beautiful way. We don't need to be fixed, we're just right."
For a long while after he woke up, he got to simply lie on the ground, not feeling anything. It was always like this when he sobered up. Slowly, more slowly than usual, he began to become aware of his body. Not this body, lying on a nice cool floor in his Mind Palace, but the 'real' one. The transport. It was the enemy that carried him around when he was stuck in the outside world. He refused to acknowledge that body just yet. This was a process, and it had to be done in order. There was a checklist.
"Well then I don't know what the issue is," he spat.
"He's never mentioned me?" John said, more surprised than hurt.
"Sherlock!" she squealed happily, throwing herself on him in a tight hug. "This is so great!"
She was humming to herself, vacuuming their sitting room again, when a sound just behind her made her jump. She jumped around the vacuum, searching for an intruder, when she saw the blue box appearing by the doorway. She relaxed shaking her head at the little box when the door swung open.
"No, Sherlock, you have a fish!" the Doctor grinned, helping him pull the pole.
"You are a child."
"Judge Ronald Adair was murdered, remember? Lestrade called us, asked us to come down to the Yard and review the suspects.
"Sherlock," she said, stopping him in his tracks, "don't you even dare. We need to talk."
He stared at her incredulously. "You—you can't. That would literally kill me. The withdrawals are fatal—"
"It's a ship. A time machine." The Doctor told him.
Yet. No one knew they were here yet.
Something was off though. He felt his transport sniff at the air around him. It didn't smell like the house on Darter Street. The scent was familiar, of course, but not right for where he had passed out. Had he been moved? Being abducted in some way was a danger here—he had known a few friends who had passed out and woken up in chains. He needed to figure out where he was, and he needed to do it quickly.
John stopped shaking the man's hand, staring at the three relatively same-aged people in front of him for a moment. "I…Is that like some sort of code?"
It was his room. Not his room at the tiny flat he was renting right now, but his real room, the one from his childhood. He sat on his old bed, looking around at the nostalgic decorations. Of course it was a bit wrong—he had grown out of this pirate theme years before. This was his room, but as it was when he was a child. He shook, his head, trying to get his bearings. Why would his mind bring him here?
"So you kept traveling after that?"
"Let's not," Sherlock said, rolling his eyes.
"Missed you," the Doctor whispered, settling into the pillows. "The boys asleep?"
"Yes," Rose nodded.
"The banana cream pie I made this morning. It's not in the fridge anymore."
"You see it, don't you?" Rose asked with a smile. "That extra spark he has, the thing that makes him wonderful. I look at my boys and I see the universe in their eyes, and I think you see it too. That's half of what makes you special."
He thought a moment. "No. Sorry, but…it's impossible. Physically impossible."
"The ropes that had fastened the unconscious body of Mr. Whitmore to the back of the large African Elephant were tied in bowline knots. It had to be the work of the sailor."
He waved her off and leaned back in his chair, casting a sad glance at his favorite patient. Wild black curls lay perfectly still against the man's pale, angular face. The name on the chart in John's hands read William S. S. Holmes. Someone had found him a few years ago in a local drug den, unconscious after overdosing. He'd been comatose ever since. They'd tried to find him visitors, but it seemed very few people knew him. His only living family member was a brother, Mike, and they didn't appear to have a very close relationship. He'd only been to see him once or twice, and he called John every four months or so to check in on his condition. Mike covered the cost of the private room, but his lack of interest bothered John.
"Of course it can."
John chuckled once. "Sure you do. We're friends. Or, we will be."
"I know," Sherlock said solemnly.
"No, but you never make plans either. Two people, going out, spending time together, it all seems a bit too personal for you."
John blinked, looking to Sherlock for an explanation. His friend seemed to be looking everywhere except at him.
John nodded, and Sherlock wrapped his arms around him, pulling the notebook and pen from his jeans and trying his best to write out a quick message to Mycroft. They sidestepped until he could reach the wall, then he punched a small hole in the wall.
I look for this part of the story to have one more chapter, possibly two, and then I'll move on to more one shots. As always I'd love any ideas anyone has for plots of young Sherlock and Mycroft. Thanks all!
"No. Jack's been helping up with legal documents—technically the boys don't have last names yet. I'm going to let them pick one when they turn thirteen – something that really matters to them, something that reminds them of home."
"Ow, no, I'm never doing that again," the Doctor shivered. "It's about as pretty as you'd imagine but way too hot."
“Oh, right,” the Doctor nodded. “You had better all come inside, it’s getting darker out, it’ll be bedtime soon anyway.”
"No, I don't care. Well, yes, I guess I do, to an extent. I've been living with an alien and I didn't even know it."
John blinked at him. "Yes. I am."
The Doctor fought a grin and clapped Mycroft on the back as he carried his younger son out towards the living room. He flipped him over and the boy landed on the couch and bounced a bit, which always made him giggle.
Mycroft didn't even glance up.
"Have you been anywhere?"
Sherlock snorted and shook his head, leaning down to examine the body again. "No, of course I don't. There is no Thompson Savings and Loan. Well, there may be, but it certainly isn't going to be a few blocks away."
“It’s kind of embarrassing that it’s Rosie who arranged everything isn’t it?” John had asked in the darkness of their bedroom (
Sherlock didn’t have much (any) experience in kissing but he tried to imitate John and assimilate what he was doing. Because if there was one thing he was experienced at, it was learning quickly.
They ate, talked, laughed, and when dessert arrived, Rosie made a grave face and cleared her throat solemnly.
Sometimes, John would come directly after rugby practice and Sherlock would pretend he didn’t notice John’s ruffled hair and flushed cheeks and would ignore his mother’s or father’s knowing smiles as well as the tingling in his stomach.
John sighed but probably guessed there was no use trying to negotiate and sat down on Sherlock’s bed. “As you could see the weather was particularly bad today and it wasn’t better where the rugby lads and I went so we decided to go back home and reorganize the trip another time. Since I had nothing to do for the rest of the afternoon, I went to find you in the flower shop. But what I didn’t know, was that you were in London chasing after a crazy murderer while it was raining buckets,” He looked at Sherlock accusingly and Sherlock almost felt guilty. Almost. “So I asked your dad if I could stay and wait for you in the shop and he agreed. But I didn’t know either, was that you weren’t planning on coming back when it was already dark outside. Then your parents asked me if I wanted to stay over for the night, so I could wait for you. And here I am. Now your turn, what happened exactly?”
