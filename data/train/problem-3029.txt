He shut off his headphones, booted up Netflix, and drummed his hands idly across the keys while he waited, half-nervous, for his computer to adjust.
Dean looked at Cas’s mouth, the way he always had been drawn to do. The soft expanse of his lips slightly narrowed with age. Less chapped now than when they first met, still gently pink, the way wild roses by the roadside were. Dean considered just how often, just how early on, he’d thought about tasting them, sampling how they felt against his own.
Cas’s heart warms completely for the first time since waking up human. Knowing Dean cares about Claire, has always made Castiel indescribably happy. They’re two of the people Cas loves most, and they are so alike. For them to care about each other is almost to see them care for themselves, something neither of them is particularly skilled at.
“So, what, this is—goodbye?” Cas pressed. Dean hesitated, but nodded all the same. They had just reunited and the disappointment choked Cas.
dudes, Cas,” Dean said. For all Dean’s confidence, in many ways this was a first for him as well. Dean glanced down. “What I mean is, you gotta be chatty, alright? Tell me what you’re into.”
“The day after that?” Dean pressed. Cas opened his mouth. “Jesus Christ,” Dean moaned, just now realizing that Cas was completely unemployed. “I really screwed you over, didn’t I?”
It sounded cool, but also something so beyond Dean’s comprehension that it wasn’t worth asking about. “Once, a girl I was into dreamed that I cheated on her and stopped talking to me,” Dean offered, bringing things back down to earth. His voice was rough. Cas smiled at that, but there was something tired about it. “So, you’re doing okay?”
“You know, it is pretty messed up that she hit on me, when I’m taken,” Dean smirked suddenly, voice low.
Dean straightened himself out, needing to hit something, “No, the hell – we’re talking about
“I’m gonna make some breakfast,” Dean said. “Want anything?” Castiel narrowed his eyes on him.
The recognition on his eyes faded and cooled when he noticed Naomi.
“I mean . . . I guess I just like the thought that you’d fight for me, too,” Dean shrugged. “For this.”
And maybe those were just hollow words, but Dean could see it brought some of the weight off of Sam’s shoulders.
“The way you cared for your brother, then,” Cas said. “The way you care for him. You’re not a hateful person.”
“Oh Dean, I can’t –”
. I couldn’t, he already lost one son. And if he – over
“I’ve left many marks on you over the years,” Cas murmurs insistently, with a small and familiar seed of sadness. “Most of which I’ve been fortunate enough to heal.”
Most women would skip over Cas for Dean. Even when it had been Dean and Sam, unless the girl really dug tall guys, Dean was more popular. But that was just Dean, putting himself out there over and over, grinning and flirting, winking like a star in winter. Cas was a good-looking guy, or Jimmy had been, as stressed out as he looked now. A roll in the hay would probably do him even better.
“Don’t have to,” Dean mumbled. They ate quietly together for awhile. Finishing up his burger, Dean put his hands on the table in fists. “I just…what the hell are you doing, Cas? Why are you going back to them?”
Dean moves off Cas for a moment, mouth salivating and swollen, to ask, “Somethin’ the matter, Cas?” before he slides his way back onto Cas’s dick. Cas
“Yeah, maybe I should,” he agreed. He amended, “I
“Think I don’t know that?” Dean asked, trying to keep his voice soft because Cas winced and pulled his sheets tighter around his body. “Things change. People do.” Dean frowned. He knew Cas didn’t want to feel weak but…Cas was shrugging of Dean’s care every step of the way.
“Uh—that’s…great, Cas,” he said, sounding a little thrown. “Wow. Who’s the—the lucky guy?” Cas couldn’t reply. Dean laughed, a little breathless in Cas’s silence. “Am I going to have to book a B&B in Vermont?”
It was the way of demons—Death’s location in exchange for a kiss to power a spell. Dean had other things to worry about, other people. The information he had obtained from Brady had been passed on to Bobby to Ellen to Sam. Castiel escorted the call down the line and to his displeasure the line lead straight back to Crowley.
you and your brother fund your lifestyle?”
Dean heaves out a quick sigh. It’s been a weird week.
Dean aims a scrap of his torn-off beer label at Sam and is gratified when it lands in his brother’s stupid hair.
The statement of ‘of course this wouldn’t change anything, you’re my best friend’ hung on Dean’s tongue each time he considered how to broach the topic with Cas, but it kept on hanging unsaid because it just wasn’t true.
“Everything. The werewolves we’re after, I think it’s a pack. These three guys. I got their pictures from the police,” John shows him the pictures, as if that helps anything.
He laughs, “you know that won’t hurt me.” And he’s right.
And he sits there. He’s not sure for how long.
thirdly, i'll keep linking all the songs used in this fic at the end and if anyone is interested i could put them in a playlist. just let me know here or on
“Right, then,” Bobby reaches over and slaps a hand on his shoulder. “
“Okay,” Sam says. He gives her a grin, “apparently Dad left some stuff back home that we have to go claim.” His heart sinks into his chest as the lie comes out of his mouth as softly as any loving words would.
Dean glances up at him.
“You’re okay, sweetheart,” Bobby says, running a calloused hand through dry, tangled brown hair. “You’re alright. You’re not alone.”
“Fuck you,” Dean murmurs. Sleep is going to take him in 3…, “n’stop callin’ me angel.”
, I think,” he responds, shakily.
“Oh, me, Dean. You’re getting really good at this. I’m kind of proud of you,” God says, with a chuckle. He pokes at the man’s corpse with the tip of His boot. He looks back up at Dean and nods while saying, “this makes 131. You’re getting there, cowboy. Don’t give up.”
Dean shakes his head. He holds his left hand out and drags his right hand over it, up to his elbow. Slow. As Dean motions, the sleeve of his shirt rises enough that Castiel can see scarring underneath. It makes his heart sink into his chest, but Castiel nods. He’s waited years. With everything Dean has done, Castiel can wait a little longer.
Dean smiles.
And Dean continues living this way. He stays in motels even cheaper than the ones he usually stayed in with Sam. He lives on granola bars, gatorade, and diner food whenever he actually feels like eating. He keeps looking for cases, if only to avoid places he might run into Sam or his mother at. He seldom speaks and this lets him develop a sense for gauging people. He can spot a man that beats his wife by watching how the man watches the people around him. Dean especially hones his ability to recognize his father in other men. A child that flinches when their father laughs at the diner table, loud and boasting, is a child that has seen violence. A man that stands straighter than everyone else in the room is a man that has inflicted violence.
Seven years,” Dean says, running a hand through his hair.
you gonna get off your ass and do something about this car, then?”
He doesn’t go back to the house.
“Conga line? All due respect, sir, but the 40’s called.”
thank you for making it all the way through! feel free to contact me on tumblr
The guy gives him a incredulous look and says, “I— no, I was going to—”
“Uh, everything okay?” Jess butts in. She’s confused. Still, the three of them know why Sam and Dean had that conversation in Spanish.
“Dean,” comes a divine whisper from behind him. “That’s 999! You’re so close,” God says in a way that promises Dean salvation.
“I’m in love,” Dean says, breathless. His voice cracks at the end. He grips at the sheets beneath him as the tension in him begins to dissipate, replaced completely with the warmth that’s pooled in his stomach.
It’s four months since John’s left, since the last of his family has finally abandoned him, and he’s lying on the ground of a shitty motel room in a fetal position, crying into the dirty maroon carpet as a soft Spanish guitar plays around him from a radio.
“Dean, say something to me!” Sam yells. There’s no concern in his voice anymore, it’s just an upset little brother. “Anything! Tell me you’re alive in there!”
cas nods and he says with a little shrug, “it seemed like a kind gesture. i sort of gave him points to land on. that way he didn’t land in the middle of a hunt or something. i’m sorry, dean.”
Cas’ lips form a straight line and he says, “of sorts.”
And Sam understands. Dean’s revealed new dots and Sam has always been good at puzzles.
It’s a rush.
Deacon laughs, “Yeah, I guess you are.”
Dean stays on his knees, one of his hands still holding the side of the angel’s face, as if trying to give the angel the remaining will to live that Dean keeps buried inside of him. Bile rises up in Dean’s throat and the tension in his chest swells to an unbearable degree. It’s a feeling that threatens to tear him apart piece by piece should he tear his eyes away. He is a pipe bomb of rage, despair, and loss. The angel’s face is still warm in Dean’s hand. Dean keeps staring, as if he can get the angel to open his eyes through sheer willpower alone.
from the reception counter. He can’t focus on the words anymore. He tosses the book aside and it lands on the ground with a gentle thud.
Dean’s smile tightens, “you said it, brother.”
And Dean looks up at him, mouth agape in the face of the salvation he’s found. But, it’s neither salvation nor righteousness that kneels down in front of him. There’s no telling what Castiel is thinking. Dean watches Castiel’s hands shake as the angel kneels down on the opposite side of the corpse. Dean shudders at the touch of Castiel’s hand when it reaches up to gently hold Dean’s jaw. The angel’s touch is hot, scalding on his skin. And Dean laughs.
Dean shrugs nonchalantly. Sure. Maybe Cas is onto something. It’s all worth checking out, Dean thinks. Still, he’s too young to act like he’s FBI. Plus, he goes to this school. He can’t exactly tell people he’s school policeman Bruce Springsteen.
Castiel, for the most part, has opted to give Dean space. In turn, Castiel has found joy in wandering around the bunker because the bunker is alive nearly in every sense of the word. The pipes are rickety and creak and the machinery that powers the lights hums softly through the walls if you focus enough to hear it. Between the bunker’s ambience sounds, Castiel spends most of his time appreciating the feeling of nature on his skin while listening to different music playlists on his borrowed earbuds. But, the more Dean heals, the less he finds himself needing them.
He returns to the motel nearly three weeks later, having effectively surpassed the 900 mark after he’d gotten enough blood in him. He’s so close to wiping his slate clean. Meeting his end of the deal with God and righting things for— for who exactly? For the angel, right. For the angel to be brought back. And… allowed to exist again. The longer he tries to reason with how that works out in his mind, the less it makes sense. It ultimately comes back to the fact that Dean owes the angel a debt. A thousand corpses for the angel’s life. Dean just has to meet his end of the deal.
Coach Costello raises an eyebrow and gives Dean an amused grin, “wow, Dean, how come your mom lets you have two birthdays?”
Dean slips the clean pair of jeans on and zips his duffel bag up.
Logan’s breath turns shallow, he exhales shakily. The laugh still comes through as h e says, “so that’s it? I make you. I
His hair is long, reaching just above his elbows. His eyes are big, bright. The curve of his jaw is delicate and the freckles that dot his face seem to enhance how soft his expression is at any given moment.
Sam snaps back. He glares when his older brother doesn’t shut up.
dean’s blush comes down a little and he leans back just a little, so he can turn and meet cas full on in another kiss before turning back to look out at the normal neighbourhood sam’s found himself in.
There’s no other way he can really describe it. He moves with grace, with the training of an ex-marine and the skill of a man who’s done this over a thousand times under different circumstances. They’d found the base of an organized crime syndicate. It was the find of a lifetime.
Dean gives Castiel a smile that reaches Dean’s eyes and the awkwardness of feeling like Castiel is going to sink onto the ground while sitting in the pile of what he has to assume aren’t actually beans becomes worth it.
“Sure, yeah,” Jess says. “You should come inside?”
How else was he supposed to look at Sam? If not with the look of betrayal?
“What’s me being a hitchhiker got to do with a hunt?” A feeling sinks deep in his stomach, as if this is what would happen were he to try to tell John anything.
Bobby looks up from the book then. A silence falls between them as Dean buries his face in his hands. He takes several more deep breaths.
“Dean?” Sam asks, after a second of tension.
thank you again for reading!
Dean growls low in his throat, reaching up to grab handfuls of dark hair at the back of Logan’s head with the intent to hurt. He pulls the demon back, away from his neck. Logan gives him a manic grin.
(See the end of the chapter for
meet the most awkward hunter imaginable who also happens to have the coolest name. Oh, to be named after somebody as cool as Butch Cassidy. Dean was named after his grandma. Not as fun.
“A demon,” Cas says flatly.
The guard is able to connect Bobby with a licensed medical professional that’s willing to do a favour for them. It’s got to be the worst thing Dean’s experienced thus far. At least on a physical level. He spends so much time in bed. So much. After two days he’s sick and tired of lying around, but even moving around makes him ache. It doesn’t help that Bobby refuses to baby him.
“thank you,” he chokes out, voice breaking because he’s started crying again, “i... i don’t have heaven. but i love you with the power of a guy who fought god.”
“I’m in Lot A. Number four zero six,” Cas says, shoving his hands in his pockets.
They just really need to get to a bathroom.
Sam doesn’t return. Castiel gets up and sits back down on the bed this time with his back against the headboard and with his warmest smile, he invites Dean to sit with him. Dean takes him up on it. Castiel flicks through the channels and they sit there for hours, in complete comfortable silence.
It takes John another three months to ask him to do something like that again.
“Dean!” His mother yells again.
Meatsuit? Both he and Sam share this thought.
Two weeks after that, Sam sends Castiel over to Dean’s recovery room with a tray of breakfast foods. Nothing is even remotely greasy and Castiel prepares himself for a comment about bacon and a reluctant smile. He receives neither when he sets the tray down on Dean’s lap. Dean has been able to move by himself for about a day or two. He can’t get up from the bed without assistance, but he’s slowly regaining his independence.
Dean gives him a nod.
“Okay, you know what,” Dean says with a laugh. He reaches over and smacks at Sam with his right hand, his left one still on the wheel. “
He hears Bobby’s question and he has an answer for him, but he can’t make out words and thoughts over the sound of his tears. He wraps himself around Bobby, eyes staining Bobby’s shirt again.
Dean has Castiel back and Castiel has yet to respond, yet to say anything that indicates that the debt is paid.
“No, not exactly,” Cas says, almost awkwardly shifting before adding, “I attend the university. I’m majoring in political science with a minor in philosophy.”
“Follow me,” Cas says plainly.
“Dean,” Sam says. He’s obviously very concerned, “what the hell are you doing?”
“Tell you what, word ‘round the grapevine was that you also lost the mark of Cain, yeah? You remember that? That’d help you be at your best wouldn’t it? Whatever the mark’s made of is the main essence of what juices demon blood. It’s something you’d probably be receptive to.”
And away they go.
Sam almost laughs. He remembers Bobby. Bobby and Dean raised him when John was too busy being an alcoholic.
dean finds himself turning around so that cas can come around him, head coming to rest on dean’s shoulder and his arms coming around dean’s middle.
. It’s me, you know, your son? The one you don’t bother calling?” He sighs, regrouping his emotions and starting over, “I— I don’t have anything to say to you, but I do have to ask. Have you bothered wishing him happy birthday? I bought S— him a spot out here in California. I buried his jacket in there and I saw him today. Not actually saw him. You know what I mean.”
“When’s your birthday?” she asks.
His head jerks up from the puzzle cube he’s fiddling with. That’s not— He should? Uh. He gets up regardless, awkwardly heading over to the receptionist’s desk despite nobody batting an eyelash. He’s in Tucson, Arizona, the dark skinned woman behind the desk has pronounced his last name as, “Ween-ches-ter,” and somehow the missing part of his first name is what strikes him.
The heel of Dean’s boot comes to rest on this man’s neck. He applies enough pressure to keep him from moving. The man coughs underneath Dean’s shoe, attempting to grab at Dean’s ankle to get him off. Dean pulls his gun instead. The man begins flailing desperately, trying to shove away from Dean.
“It’s a long fucking story, Sammy,” he says. He looks away, toward the front door, completely hesitating.
“Dean,” Sam says for the third time, “what happened?” Sam’s tone isn’t accusatory. It’s that of a child who’s found his lost parent.
Dean’s voice had shaken and his eyes had cried, but he told John, he told John that John had turned him and Sam into monsters, just like John. Dean wasn’t a normal person and he’d never known how to be one and it was John’s fault. Sam was never going to know what it was to live a regular life, get married and have kids. And it was John’s fault. John’s breath hadn’t smelled of alcohol, even if Dean had convinced himself that it had when John leaned back and his fist collided with the side of Dean’s face. Dean doesn’t remember the next. He’d woken up inside a hospital with a concussion and a set of black eyes. Sam still thinks Dean was sent out as backup to another hunter’s case.
They spend the night at the house. Dean doesn’t know what it looks like. He gets set on a couch and gently pushed onto his back. He doesn’t know by who. The night sets into the house, still and quiet as death. Dean is looking at the ceiling, but he’s seeing the angel draped in between the burnt remnants of his wings, a painting created of the essence of a divine creature. When the dark overcomes Dean with the brief pause of sleep, it isn’t long before his eyes flick open to the sound of movement.
Castiel turns to head back into the kitchen, then.
That’s the problem, he thinks. At its core, it comes down to taking down what took everything from them. Because, it really wasn’t just limited to their mother. He’d been enrolled in an elementary school and was the most popular girl in the fourth grade when John had made them move to the United States. Sam had only just started kinder and never got to watch the newest episode of Plaza Sesamo that was supposed to premiere the day after they left. They’d arrived on new soil, with people speaking a language that was foreign to them, and were forced to learn to survive here. Most of their stuff had been left at the little house on the street corner in Mexico City.
Kelly Kline’s corpse is somewhere in the room and Mary is around and about. She tries to talk to him after Sam is unable to on different occasions.
“When are you gonna date her?” Isaac asks, “she eats you up every time she sees you.”
Dean reaches over to a counter in the bathroom and picks up a smaller pocket-knife that he’s usually opted to leave behind when he goes out to hunt for marks. He flicks it open, eyeing the blade for a moment before he brings it to a scar at his stomach that was left from the time he’d hunted supernatural creatures. He presses the blade into the healed skin and slowly drags it along. A shiver goes up his spine as the blade slices the skin open. Blood rushes in to fill the gap, releasing the built up tension inside of Dean from the weight of the debt he owes. Dean pulls it away when he reaches the end of the scar. He brings it up to another one at the side of his shoulder, near his armpit. The blade drags down his skin and the endorphins send another shiver up his spine. Dean exhales, the tension is at bay now.
Hester spared him a disgusted glance before looking back to Castiel.
“Sure,” Castiel said easily, letting go of Dean’s hand. He stretched, bones popping with the movement.
“Oh, sweetheart,” comes Bobby Singer’s voice from above him. He feels a pair of arms pick him up by his sides and they set him on the bed, but they don’t let him go. He cries into Bobby’s chest, clutching at the wet shirt.
Bobby takes him home, gets him into a better lifestyle that involves helping out other hunters before he gets sent on his own hunts again. After his first successful hunt, he finds himself in Bobby’s junkyard, hand caressing the destroyed metal of the impala. He could rebuild her. He could. He’s not in the best headspace, but it would help.
It comes out rapidfire, a quick series of accusations. How
Inside his apartment, it looks like a man lives there. There are clothes thrown about everywhere, candy wrappers, and the occasional textbook decorating the embodiment of the modern day ‘man cave.’ He slips into his bed and falls onto his back with a bit of a smile. At his bedside table, he turns to look over at a photo frame of two young boys. One’s funny looking, his features yet to grow into his face. The other is just very small, the bright smile on his face indicating the promise of what could have been.
It’s a tried and true method and it’s worked for him before. He watches from a distance as the man tries to shove the girl against the side of one of the semis. Dean knows he won’t get far. The girl is too quick, too practised at this. She leaps at him before he can do anything else, her fangs come out, and that’s all she fuckin’ wrote. The man never gets a chance to scream.
Sam’s face is bloody underneath Dean’s fist and by the third, Sam is unconscious or close to it. Dean pulls back, breathing heavily as the tension in his stomach threatens to rise into his eyes again. He stands up and digs through his pockets until he hears the jingle of the impala’s keys. He unlocks the door and with a final inhale at the smell of leather, he grabs the duffel bag he keeps in the backseat. Outside, he kneels down and puts the keys into Sam’s open hand. The tension beats Dean when he turns away from Sam. It pools in his eyes and expels slowly, trickling down both sides of his face.
Dean is suddenly very concerned with the way this man looks. The man has blonde hair that’s receded enough to create a defined widows peak, he has blue eyes, just like— no, nothing like—, and he has the audacity to stare up at Dean like
“Well, yeah, you should tell me about that. But, I actually meant, uh, what’s up with you?” Sam asks.
“Hey!” Dean says, moving his head away as best he can. It isn’t very far.
Dean says. He takes a deep breath, “There’s not much to say. I died and dad… brought me back.”
Castiel’s entire body does jerk violently in Dean’s direction, however, when Dean
at the name. He takes a few more seconds before he finally says, “thank you.” It’s breathy, softer than his voice has been the entire night.
“Yeah, yeah, ‘course,” Dean says with a forced grin, “it’s just, you know. Shit’s never been simple with us, huh?” and if Sam doesn’t know that.
“My name got cut off at the clinic. The nurse called me
Dean turns to look at Him. God walks over to him and something inside Dean twists. It’s an odd sensation. Something Dean can process as want, but it’s not want in the carnal sense. It’s a want that manifests differently. A want that’s satisfied when God puts his hand on the side of Dean’s face and says very earnestly, “that’s a good boy, Dean.” And then vanishes.
“I love you, too,” Castiel says. His voice is shaky, nervous. Had this been any other circumstance, he’d have laughed at himself. He was a creature born on the second day of creation. He’d seen war and death in every way possible, all the glorious and terrible periods of human history. And it was Dean Winchester and his wide, sunken eyes that made Castiel weak.
“Hey sugar, merry Christmas,” the brunette waitress says, giving him a flirtatious grin. Dean smiles up at her, it’s friendly and doesn’t reach his eyes. He taps at a stack of pancakes on the menu. She tilts her head to the side curiously. Dean doesn’t change his expression. He taps the pancakes again.
Dean stares up at Him, waiting.
“You’d get a kick out of this, Sammy. Hell, I thought dad would, too,” Dean says to nobody in particular. He hears the clang of his cleats hitting the aluminum and stops at the bottom of the bleachers, looking out at the way the sun makes the grass shine along the well-kept field.
“I don’t even know what the hell you’re doing. You ditched your phone, I haven’t seen you in
Castiel regards him with a slow head tilt. He’s staring at Dean like he doesn’t recognize him. But Dean knows he does. Castiel has to. Dean’s black eyes glisten in the moonlight that pours through the window Sam is on the ground beneath as Castiel approaches him tentatively. His trenchcoat is torn and frayed and dirty at the edges.
“I could get fired—” he says, hugging his arms closer to his chest.
Dean laughs, turning to look down at the ground as embarrassment creeps up his stomach and into his face. He looks back at Sam and says, “I left, Sam. After you, you know. I…”
Dean gives her a tired smile and shrugs.
“Chuck,” is all Dean manages to breathe out before God appears before him.
And he thinks of Dean among those chains. The corrupted essence of a soul that Castiel had reached for from above. He thinks of the evil, the wretchedness the soul contained when Castiel raised it from perdition. He thinks of the pain Castiel attempted to heal, the masses of thick, dark webbing he gently eroded from the soul’s interior. It fit perfectly into the body Castiel recreated, from the tips of his toes, to Dean’s slightly crooked right middle finger, to the mistreated ends of his hair. Dean Winchester had been made whole, Dean Winchester had been saved.
Dean sets his duffel bag down on one of them, digging through it for the black kit he carries. It’s been too long. He needs more.
After he dunks his hair in enough water to rinse the soap out, he tilts his head upwards and lets it run down the front of his face for a second, letting his hair stick over his shut eyes. He takes several deep breaths.
“Major league baseball!” His coach answers himself, too, ignoring Dean’s response as he continues, “and miss Anna we have over there? Also MLB bound. Just you watch.”
Dean takes a deep breath as the air stills around him. The edges of his vision are hazy and he takes several seconds to catch his breath. He looks down at the gore and carnage around him. Heads lie malfigured from the impact of their fall in several directions. There’s a severed arm that’s currently pooling blood around his boots, its fingers curled inward. He kicks it aside, sending blood spilling in a different direction. His eyes look up toward a window.
“Wanna play a game?” Dean suggested, yawning. He wasn’t going to be able to get to sleep with Cas huffing and puffing in the backseat and he figured he could entertain Cas well enough.
, if you and I were as bad as Sam stealing off to college – I couldn’t . . .
It’s better than not talking at all, which Castiel knows is the other, unsaid option.
“If my powers are failing, it’s best I learn how you have survived these past few years,” Castiel said, somewhere between the depression and acceptance stages of grief regarding his impending humanity. Dean rolled his eyes.
“Yes, I actually believe in this crap,” he replied dryly. Dean raised his eyebrows, pouting slightly. “I believe in the Bible, and the Bible did foretell the end of the world.” Dean still looked at Castiel like he was crazy. And it was strange to consider. “You deal with supernatural evil every day, and yet you don’t believe in supernatural good?”
“Oh my god,” Dean grumbled, sounding somewhere between exasperated and affectionate. “Alright Miss Daisy, I can do that.”
“If you want me out, Bobby, just tell me,” he said.
But he caught a look on Cas’s face, a little smirk. Fucker had actually made a joke. On purpose. That somehow made it even better. “Yeah, and you’re Little Orphan Annie,” Dean agreed, still laughing. “Single dad
Being with Dean, forced Castiel to confront something much deeper than he was usually privy to. This time, mourning. Mourning of the long dead. Ellen’s husband, Jo’s father, William Harvelle, had been among the spirits to rise. He had fit right in among the household as though he had never left and they had wanted to protect that. When he had turned, because the townspeople turned, Ellen had been forced to end his life herself. She came outside her bedroom, grabbed a bottle of liquor and sat at the kitchen table, silent.
“It’s great,” she said, running her hand down his arm, wrist, to join their hands together as she led him down the hallways passed some interested glances from her neighbours. “Place runs super efficiently, and you’ll see how the raids go tomorrow. It’s cramped, but we’ve been making do. Some people wanna shut the doors, not let anyone else in in case they’re infected. I guess you got lucky. And that’s not any way to live anyhow.”
In all honesty, Cas didn’t think much about his meeting with Dean. Dean was an interesting individual, with his occult jewelry, black leather jacket, and ghost stories, but he was one customer passing through town, never to be seen again. As fate would have it, not a week passed after their meeting, when Cas had left work and was waiting for the six o’clock bus, when Dean’s aforementioned ghosts turned their sights on him.
“Don’t,” Cas said, the roughness of his voice startling Dean out of his thoughts. “I made my choice. We have much larger problems to worry about. And as I’ve always said … you can’t save everyone … especially when they don’t want to be saved.”
“Yeah, but I – I know some of the kids that live there,” Anna said. “From school. Problem children. They’re not . . . the type of people that would be easily converted.”
“I mean,” Dean blustered. “What the hell am I supposed to say to that?”
“I,” Cas said. “Well, I hope so. He’s . . . an atheist, but I think I can get through to him. I’m not sure that he’ll still be here.” It would nearly be a week from the previous time Castiel visited.
“Keep us posted, you know?” Jo said, pressing her hip against him. She glanced over her shoulder at Castiel as well, eyes wide and earnest. Castiel looked away. He shouldn’t have been there to begin with. “We’ve all been looking,” she said.
“Hey, don’t knock it till you’ve tried it,” Dean said, leaning back onto the couch and rolling his shoulders, trying to get comfortable again. Cas frowned. He obviously didn’t want to try it. And Dean got where he was coming from. Dean took sleep when he could get it, but could he shut himself off long enough to sleep more than four hours most nights? Nah. If it wasn’t nightmares, it was guilt that got Dean. There was always another case, another town to get to, another highway to drive down. “Dreams are a plus,” he offered.
Dean turns to him then, a small smile on his lips.
Just then, the demon holding him down was stabbed by the angel blade, dying on top of him. He shoved them off, sitting up and calling out,
He had the urge to ask Dean more questions about their future, but, he supposed he had plenty of time left with Dean for answers. And he could sense that what had just transpired had drained a lot from Dean. He was already shouldering all responsibility. Castiel understood then, standing in Bobby’s kitchen, drinking a celebratory beer, why he would be standing by Dean’s side after five years, four years now. He took another drink and put his faith in Dean.
Dean still looks troubled. He often looks troubled these days.
“You admiring your work, or?” Dean asks, arching his back as much as he can without it being too obvious, almost sighing at the way Cas’s hands slide down his skin. He wets his lips with his tongue, nervous even while Cas’s warm hand on his ribs is driving him up the wall, hips twitching for attention.
Dean liked getting massages. He’d told Cas before about the massage beds some motels had, made Castiel try one out a few months ago. Cas suspected, on top of the physical pleasure they provided, the massage beds also gave Dean the illusion of touch.
“Alright,” Castiel spoke up. “That sounds…fine.”
Sam took it bad for once. Locked himself up in his room. No talking. Sam was always one to take death in stride. Apparently, he always thought the worst was gonna happen, so when it happened he was braced for it. Or maybe he got the satisfaction of being right, at least. Meanwhile, Dean could never get used to it. Each hit stung as bad as the first. He had more experience with it. But, Dean was the one hanging out with Cas in the kitchen, drinking maybe, but he wasn’t alone at least.
Dean steals a look at him, up his white shirt, ruffled, half-buttoned, at the flush at his neck, the love bite bruising at his collar. He does it because people like it when Dean looks up at them like this. But, it also does Dean good to see that it’s Cas that’s looking back down at him.
having sex with you,” Cas amended, dropping his pitch, enjoying the predictable way it made Dean shiver. “I plan to have sex with you many more times. Would you be . . . amenable, to that?”
Dean jerked, like he’d been snapped out of a daze, standing up as though he was rearing for a fight.
angels are real.” He squinted at the road. “Faith and evidence are kind of diametrically opposed, Cas.”
“You’d uh, maybe you’d be doing something with your physics degree,” Dean said. “Grad school. Sam talks about grad school sometimes. I don’t know. You could be a student and I could be your hot, mysterious boyfriend putting food on the table.”
“You don’t have to shoulder this all by yourself,” Castiel murmured. He had people. If he wanted Jo, he could have her, if he wanted Castiel…Dean had jumped to the task of saving the world, not because he wanted to be involved, but because he would not be able to live with himself if he hadn’t. Dean didn’t see that Sam was the same as him, or perhaps he would rather pretend otherwise.
“Hey Anna,” Dean greeted when he saw her. She smiled and moved through the doorway, tentatively reaching out to hug him.
back?” Dean asks, quietly, as though shy. “Even though you’re human?”
“It wasn’t your fault,” Cas promises, a small reassuring smile in his voice.
“It’s not like you to turn down a house,” Cas murmured.
“I think I’ve become stupider,” Cas admits.
“You know anything about the archangels, Missouri?” Dean asked, taking his drink, giving it a quick blow and a gulp.
“What are you doing here, Sam? You are aware that Dean doesn’t know you’re going on hunts,” he said, trusting his disapproval was clear in his voice. He didn’t fully understand the lines the brothers had drawn for each other but Castiel was under the impression that Sam was crossing one now.
“She was…pretty." That hurt the most to say.
Dean scrubbed some more, wondering who had told him. Sam, maybe. But then, angelic hearing and all, Cas might’ve heard it through the walls.
me.” He spat the words. “I should be over this.” He was never getting over this. He’d been okay for awhile, he’d actually been better with Cas he felt like, despite all that had happened. Things had kind of tapered down to a sort of dull ache. He had no idea what’d set him off like this. Things hadn’t been this bad since—well, since he’d first gotten back. Not that things had been easy for Cas either.
“They showed me yours as well,” he assured her. Closer, he could recognize her. She had pleasant features, soft and earnest, and she was all the more pretty in person. “Shall we go inside?” She nodded, smiling gratefully, put at ease. It was an odd situation to be in.
“Of course,” Cas said, sitting up straighter in his seat, eyes wide and blue.
“I’ll stop contacting you,” he offered. Dean steeled himself. And Castiel knew he didn’t want this either but thought it best. “Just take the tapes, Dean.”
And that cashier – while perhaps not having the most desirable personality, was certainly the kind of woman Cas knew Dean would have eagerly spent a night or two with in the past – pretty and decisive and eager.
“She’s young,” Dean grumbles. “Oughta protect her health. So should you. You’re human, now.”
But he couldn’t do it by himself, too cowardly to take the leap alone. And after all the years of hurt and loss he couldn’t even say that him and Cas would be a good idea. Just an idea he’d had and dismissed for a very long time.
, for that matter.”
“I thought I wasn’t supposed to sleep on the couch,” Cas said, eyes glazed.
“What do they got on you in Heaven, anyway?” Gabriel mused. Adam’s eyes were wide, pale, frightened. He was still a teenager. “It’s family, I bet,” Gabriel said, with a sinking recognition. “Mommy? Daddy? Flip a coin, I’ve got decent odds on being right. You know, Heaven might lie to you about everything else, Adam, but they’re not lying to you about that.”
“Oh, you think?” Dean asked dryly. Jo punched his shoulder. “Ouch! Jesus, I thought potheads were supposed to be pacifists!”
“Who’s your friend, Dean?” the man asked, looking straight through Castiel.
He couldn’t meet her gaze. He just looked down at his hands in hers, seeing how pathetic he was. That he was gay and this terrified of being seen as such, even by a good woman like Nora. That she was doing her utmost to be kind, and his hands were still shaking.
. Dean felt like it was something he should’ve ... he should’ve
stay. And, if he loves Dean, he shouldn’t do that either.
Dean Winchester,” Ellen started, anger setting in fast and thick in her voice.
best work was beyond his control but. This he could do.
“Drugs, alcohol,” Cas agreed, adjusting his coat. “I know the distractions humans use to avoid thinking about their own mortality.” That was one way of putting it.
“Thank you, for the drinks,” he said, incredibly formal all of a sudden. He picked himself off the couch, his coat hanging off his frame in a way that made him look like a little kid.
“Hey Cas,” Dean greeted, pulling his headphones down to his chin. He was a bit surprised by Cas’s sudden visit but not upset by it. “What’s up?” Sleepy, he slurred his words slightly.
Sam shifted in his seat in a familiar way, obviously ready to stand with him in a fight if he needed it. He didn’t need it. This was his goddamn father.
?” he says. “Then why have you been talking about it?”
don’t want me. I don’t
The sky above was blue fading to a muddy pink with the sunset, and the air was dry when they stepped out of Dean’s car onto the property he’d driven them to.
He consoled himself with the thought that at least he could talk to her about this. Him and Cas hadn’t really been able to pry informed consent out of Donnie by the time Raphael was through with him.
“Alright,” Dean said. “Where is this person?”
John didn’t budge. “Dean. I don’t get it and I won’t,” he said. “But fine. You’re right. It’s a new world and my opinion doesn’t count for much anymore.” And then he said something Dean hadn’t expected. “Just want you to know that if you
“Yeah?” Dean coaxed.
“Long drive,” was all Dean said. Castiel wanted to reach across the table and grasp his hand, still clenched with stress. Uncurl those fingers and thread them with his. It seemed natural, almost.
Castiel took a breath. “I’ve taken an elective course in physics.” Anna raised an eyebrow.
But when Castiel was unhappy, particularly with Dean, Dean couldn’t give him the courtesy of just leaving him alone with those feelings. It was difficult to understand. And annoying.
Cas nods, his chest flooding suddenly, unavoidably, with affection, enough to aspirate on.
Cas bit down on his tongue so that he wouldn’t argue with John. As much as he wanted to defend Sam, if this got back to Dean . . . Cas took another drink.
He kicked off his shoes to stand on her slippery wooden floor in his socks, nudging them onto a tray by the door. Shoes sizes larger than Anna’s feet sat perched next to her small sensible pairs. “Those are my boyfriend’s,” Anna said, noticing him noticing.
“No, I liked it,” Dean said hurriedly, eyes regaining focus on Castiel. “It was uh . . . pretty hot and uh, I liked, uh –” he was gasping for words. “
“I met…Dean in a very strange time in my life,” Cas started. “I don’t even know where to begin.”
“Oh,” Dean said. He didn’t seem disgusted. A little surprised perhaps, as Cas had been. “Good for you—sticking up for your sister.” Cas felt a flash of guilt. He didn’t know why it mattered to him that Dean thought well of him, but it did.
“He fits right in, don’t he?”  Bobby bellowed back, matching Dean’s anger and raising. It was enough to make Dean acquiesce.
Cas’s eyes trailed their way down Dean’s neck to his collarbone, peaking above his shirt, his anti-possession tattoo just below. Dean shifted beneath the scrutiny. “I don’t know what would happen if you banished me along with anyone else,” Cas said, planning to be there. “Where I would go. And this—this is just a precaution against…” he fell silent.
“It’s a work in progress,” he admitted. “But I’ll keep you in the loop.” There was no way Jo and Ellen knew more on the subject than Cas, and there was no sense to putting that burden on them. He’d come here to apologize, not assign homework.
Heaven did not typically preach to atheists – they had better luck converting theists who were already near the truth, but not quite there, or at least mild-mannered agnostics or spiritualists, especially if they had at one point believed in God.
normal?” he asked bitterly. “For this family, for us?” The way John had raised Dean and Sam, and he had the
“Sorry,” Cas flushed.
“How ... how long have you wanted to?” Dean asked, tongue feeling thick in his mouth.
But it seemed like such an impossible task. For a guy who had fought immortal beings, come back from Hell, moonlighted in Heaven. And he couldn’t tell Cas ...
, Cas.”
Dean flinched. “The way my dad was with my mom, when I was a kid, before she died.” And the way Dean had been with Lisa, with Ben. Withholding at best, angry at worst. “You might wanna change your mind about that.”
“How long have
just at the thought of you . . .” he cleared his throat. You could consider Castiel an optimist, but that just sounded promising to him. “Pretty weird, that’s all. Probably watch too much porn.”
It would be funny if Dean weren’t so busy trying not to self-combust from horror.
For Christ’s sake, John didn’t even seem to like the fact that Dean did most of the cooking, alternating between him and Sam but still mostly Dean. It was beyond bizarre the hang-ups John had, especially considering that Dean’d been cooking for Sam and himself since before puberty and it had never been a problem back then.
“Well, I’m turnin’ in,” Bobby announced.
Sam scoffs. “Really?”
Steadily, the bunker comes into view, beneath the elm and cedar trees, beginning to be overgrown by Himalayan blackberries neither in fruit nor in bloom. The place looks drab, old, uninviting. And Cas knows what horrible memories lurk within.
“No can do, girl,” and Dean winks. He’s just really good at this. She laughs in response and pats him on the chest, the unspoken ‘atta boy’ understood as she heads over toward the girls’ locker rooms and he follows the guys toward the opposite side of the field, where the boys’ locker rooms were.
Sam takes half a step back and sizes Dean up. He sighs, the concern clear in his tone when he says, “you’ve lost a tonne of weight and you look tired as all hell, man.” Sam’s eyes are sad, pleading when his eyes reach Dean’s.
“nope,” dean says without hesitation, “sammy, you died when you were twenty two. i died at twenty seven? twenty eight? god, i don’t even remember.”
“Never…” it’s a murmur.
“I’m sorry,” Dean says, softly. He lets his eyes flutter closed as Castiel traces a thumb across his cheek.
“Hey, man,” Dean says with a friendly grin. The guy looks up from the book on the table and at Dean for exactly a second before jerking his head back down at the book. Dean frowns and shoots his shot, he leans over on the counter and says, “uh, I’m looking for a friend of mine. He told me he has this class right now and I honestly don’t remember what it was. I really
“Yeah,” Dean says, eyeing a girl that’s walking around in a miniskirt and a sweater. He’s forgotten the game already. He watches her step out of the front door of the house. And who is he, to let a poor defenseless college girl potentially walk out of the house into a dangerous situation? He follows her out the door and watches as she picks up the pace, heading toward the end of the street the house is on, where the commercial buildings are. He frowns. That alerts other senses of his.
“i did!” jack says coming from behind dean in an awkward hug from behind, “i can still tap into the power of god if i want to. it wasn’t hard to pop into different points of your life and just take a picture.”
“I don’t know how I’m here, Dean. One second, I’m in a garden, next thing I know I’m watching you play baseball at a
Dean takes a long sip, holding a hand out in explanation as he says, “y sí, vengo por ti. I’ve been looking into stuff and shit is getting big, Sammy. End of the world big.”
Dean gives him a pleading expression, “it’s spring break. Can’t you call off work?”
He ducks his head and shuts his eyes as he prepares for some kind of assault, just like he’d expected from John, but that never comes. Instead, Bobby leans his back on the wreckage of the impala.
“You’re a hunter,” Dean says, absolutely sure.
“I brought donuts?” Dean says, gesturing to the box.
. he'd said something about finding old commercials with a dancing old man and the closest one was in kentucky. naturally, this wasn't an issue with dean. he'd driven farther for less, but on the way back he'd begun to realize that as he got older, the drives took more out of him.
His angel didn’t deserve to die like this.
“How do you know it's them?” Dean asks, genuinely curious.
“Jess, can you give us a second?” Sam asks.
“888. You know? I like that number. It can mean prosperity,” God says, stepping forward to stand in front of Dean.
and he is. the angel castiel is standing behind dean on the cement part of the patio a few feet back, wearing one of dean’s old band tshirts under his trench coat. and there’s a book in his hands.
Sam when he has to be reminded that it’s nobody’s fault this was the shitty hand they were dealt? Yes, it’s unfortunate that their mom died and that their dad is an alcoholic, but that’s just the card they were dealt.
Sam frowns. “Well, duh. It bothers me. Luego tú te crees muy chingona.”
“No. Whatever you have to say you can say in front of Jess,” he says adamantly.
“You’re getting slow, carnalito,” she says with a laugh.
“Move,” Dean grunts, letting himself fall face first onto the unmade sheets and fall right back into sleep.
“Yes,” Cas says, very simply.
And yet, he can’t exactly go to a bar and score free drinks pretending to be a new FBI agent on his first case. He has responsibilities now, no matter how insignificant. Slacking on the team isn't going to keep his scholarship. He ends up at the boys locker room nearly an hour early and ends up changing into his uniform. As he’s tying his shoes, he hears the sound of a door opening.
Dean holds a hand out and Logan gets up to put a bottle of water in Dean’s hand. The demon goes back over and picks some of the food to set it on the stand next to the bed. Dean turns to look at him and Dean’s tired eyes fall into a more pathetic expression.
Dean comes with Castiel’s name on his tongue.
“Yeah.
With a final deep breath he goes to pick up the book from the ground. He opens the cover and grabs a pen from the desk with the lamp. He scribbles out: 605-439-8760. Tell her Dean sent you. beneath Dr. Johnson’s quote on the second page. Dean stares at the words for a second, unsure if he should leave the note at all. But, he doesn’t want to dwell on it for long. He pulls the remaining cash he’s got in his pockets, about $200 that he’s collected from the recent bodies, and stuffs them into the book. He sets that closer to her side of the table and he takes off.
Dean looks back after God vanishes.
“I said no!” the man says harshly, much more harshly than you ever need to say to a child.
And even so, he’s sure he’d get a taste of that were he to try and tell John anything. Sam might understand, but just the thought of Sam giving him a disappointed look is more than enough to deter anything.
“Whoever pulled you from hell, angel. Their grace left a signature, a stench all over you. One that you can’t scrub away.”
And he needs more blood.
Sam frowns. His fingers twist in a way that Castiel doesn’t recognize as proper American Sign Language. It means something to Dean, however. Dean looks down, his head hung in a blatant display of shame. He nods and Sam inhales sharply.
Before they leave, when John’s gone to the front counter to order something for Sam in the morning and there’s nobody around to watch the door to the men’s room open, a boy gets in the way.
It never comes.
And then- a shift in the darkness. A humanoid shadow moves past Jess’ car, heading to the opposite side of the wall Sam is standing at. Sam’s blood boils and he steps out. He’d been trained as a killer. He can take on a thief.
This way of living gets him through the first hundred. It takes him several months and it’s the quietest his life has ever been, but Dean perseveres. The longer he goes on his own, the less interested he is in partaking in things he once enjoyed. He finds a sense of comfort in it at some point. There are no more voices yelling in his head telling him that he doesn’t deserve the good things in his life. The fact of the matter is, he has none left. The last good thing was ripped from Dean’s life by the Devil himself. Dean has nothing to feel guilty for. Not anymore. Sam would be fine, Sam was always fine, and his mother didn’t even really want to be a part of his life as it was. It all worked out.
“Please,” Dean breathes out, taking the sides of the demon’s face in his hands. Dean leans in and presses a needy kiss to Logan’s mouth. His hands reach down to grab at the demon’s hands, bringing them up to Dean’s chest and Dean buries his head in the crook of Logan’s neck. Dean hears him chuckle.
“Poverty isn’t fun, Dean,” Cas says, “and college kids are stupid.”
“Hey, handsome,” she says, blinking and confirming the worst. Though, he’s never met a vampire with black eyes. She lunges at him and Dean manages to scrape himself away, plunging the knife into her chest. She looks down at the knife and then frowns at Dean. He watches her pull it out and hears it clang against the ground as she says, “and here I liked this meatsuit.”
what they sing at bobby's house. This
Dean glances up at him again and does a double take. He stares forward at Castiel, his eyes softening to match his expression. Castiel runs his thumb back and forth across Dean’s knee. Dean can only stare forward at him.
“Man, you got a hell of a right hook!” The guard says with a laugh.
“What—” Dean doesn’t get a chance to argue. God disappears and Dean frowns down at the monster he’s killed. Dean supposes the guy wasn’t really a monster, if he hadn’t been doing anything wrong. He keeps the frown on his face as he cleans the mess up. A sense of guilt manages to worm its way into Dean’s chest. The guy had a life, someone to get home to. Dean just ripped him from that. He chooses not to think more of it as he gets rid of the body.
He sits in the impala for two hours. He runs through every possible scenario where Sam rejects him, where Sam is the one to throw the punch Dean had expected from John. He runs through exactly one scenario where Sam is okay with it all and it makes his entire body uneasy and his eyes water. It’s what makes him get out of the impala. He can’t let himself fall into that sense of comfort.
a few housekeeping things,
Dean doesn’t respond to him.
Sam takes a deep breath as he looks over at Jess, she’s in the doorway again. Two mugs steam in her hands.
“do you think we could do something like this? cookie cutter house. you me and the kid?” dean asks.
“Yeah,” she responds. Her body tenses enough for Castiel to notice. Her eyes flicker to the ground for a second before she looks up at him and asks, “can I ask you something?”
“did you just call me dad?” dean asks.
The blush on this guy’s face deepens and Dean smiles softly. This is… uncomfortably easy.
Both sets of eyes fall to Sam. Sam narrows his eyebrows and glares down at who he figures is now his older brother for all senses and purposes.
doing the work.
“Yeah,” Dean agreed a little quietly. “Guess so.”
While normally Cas wouldn’t mind skipping a house or two, especially if the occupants were problematic, this surprised Castiel.
Unsatisfied that he wasn’t able to hold another point against Castiel’s family, Dean frowned.
“Does it matter?”
Cas was a good guy. He didn’t have anything to do with this, he could still opt out, leave, do something else with his life now that he finally had one. He didn’t have to, and shouldn’t have to, follow Dean’s lead. Call it destiny or obligation, Cas didn’t need it. Cas didn’t seem to agree.
“Oh Cas, you child,” Dean said, though he must have been a few years younger than Castiel. “We gotta hit up a liquor store. Or a bar. Whatever’s closer.” He grabbed Castiel by the collar and yanked him along to the passenger’s side of his car.
“Mind if I stop in, boys?” a high, decisive voice spoke up from behind them. “Just bringing some more tea and biscuits.”
On his end, Cas had acted like nothing had changed, like Dean’s knees hadn’t
“Not the worst time,” Zach assures Dean, “we’ll get em’ next time.”
and then he hears an unmistakable flutter.
Dean shakes his head again.
“We didn’t pay for that, mister,” the man says, eyeing Dean suspiciously.
“Dean?” the barista behind them says, sliding a sandwich and a latte over.
he goes through the motions and cuts the first slice of the pie for himself and passes off the pastry to sam and eileen who take care of passing out the rest of it and the cake that’d been there. dean looks around, hoping cas and jack had been right behind him as sam brings him over a whiskey. it goes down ridiculously smooth. sam mentions he ran one last credit card scam for $3,000 whiskey for this. dean laughs and asks for another.
Dean sighs deep, exhaling shakily. Anxiety sets itself in the pit of Dean’s stomach.
The next morning, Dean is woken up by the sound of knocking. He grunts, forcing himself to sit up when the knocking persists. Dean prepares himself, because he knows who it is from the knocks alone. So, when he opens the door, Sam and Mary Winchester are greeted with the sight of a disheveled Dean in a green henley and grey boxer shorts.
And God leaves him again.
“Hello, angel,” Logan breathes from above him, his face is now buried in the crook of Dean’s neck as he continues rocking against him. He breathes into Dean’s neck, “tell me your sins.”
Sam frowns, “I love you. You know that. You’re my big sister and everything you’ve done for me is always gonna mean the world to me. But, I can’t live like this. I’m too
Dean turns to go and he has the last minute realization halfway through and he turns right back.
“Damn straight,” Dean says with a laugh.
he confesses.
“It’s not my thing, really. I’ve never really had a birthday party before,” he says with a shrug. Sam and his dad singing him happy birthday over a slice of pre-cut cake was as much as he ever got.
about me leaving,” Sam says with a knowing look.
“happy birthday, dean,” cas says, a little smile on his face.
anything, but John finds a bottle of perfume in the impala and starts asking weird questions that get refuted up and down, but John looks at him differently from then on. It hurts just as bad as any rejection can.
“Gravedigging,” Castiel remembered. Dean parked the car and headed out.
“How,” Cas frowned, feeling vaguely insulted. If he could change that part of himself and get fewer women flirting with him, he’d take it.
“It’s not that difficult,” Cas said softly. “Just don’t . . . take me for granted.”
But fortunately, they didn’t want to hurt each other. And because of that, they had to protect themselves. Even if they spent the rest of their life making and making up for mistakes, Cas could see that life, certain in that uncertain future. Even if it ended in death and blood, they’d have this first. There was no other option, really. Not fate, but some strange commitment to a cause.
It was an odd fit, Cas and Sam and Jack and Mom and Dad and all that they were carrying on their backs. But when they tried, they came together alright.
Cas startled. “My—
He could never understand John but had long since determined he didn’t have to. What was done was done, dust to dust, and the less Dean thought about it all, the better.
Dean follows suit, downing his own lukewarm coffee and leaving a twenty on the table. He heads out the door, the bell tied to the door ringing gently as he peers out into the night. There’s a fog setting low, greeting Dean with a misty kiss as he looks around the empty parking lot for any sign of wrongdoing. The impala is the only thing that stares back at him for a few seconds before he turns to go around the building. There’s a highway in the distance and nobody on the road to witness a crime. Except Dean.
“Out!” The umpire yells. Dean argues with him from the ground to no avail. He sighs, getting up for the walk of shame back to the locker room as the other team celebrates the win. Still, despite the loss, the team seems to be taking it in stride. Sam’s disappeared.
“kicked god’s ass,” sam affirms, “we get to choose what we want to do now. we write our own destiny now.”
It isn’t until later that Dean finds himself sufficiently inebriated and happily nestled in between the warmth of a pretty girl’s thighs. She tangles her hands in his hair, tugging slightly and he finds that he’s at peace.
“Well, thanks a lot, mister. Mighty kind of yous,” the man says with a nod as he turns back to shut the trunk of his car.
“Right,” Cas says, shutting the book, “sorry. Did you speak with the students?”
“Dean, please,” Sam begs, “mom’s worried sick. She thought you were dead.”
“Did… something happen to you? When you woke up?” Sam asks.
“Hi, Cas,” she says with a smile, giving the bag a final kick.
Sam’s head turns back at Dean, but Dean’s put his hand down already. His lips have curved downward and he’s looking down at the sheets.
“And tell them what? My brother got hooked on demon blood and I can tell you all about that because I’ve been there, too?” Sam snaps in response. His face flinches at the end, realizing he’s been rude to his mother. “Sorry.” He says with a defeated sigh.
He remembers Billie Holiday, or hearing of her, at least. His memory has been faulty since he was pulled abruptly from the empty. Despite the memory issues, he remembers that experience entirely.
. The edges of his vision blur as he stares at the side of Dean’s face, at the way his cheekbone juts out from years of malnutrition.
“Are you alright?” She asks, a curious yet slightly concerned grin on her face.
Dean shrugs off his jacket and hoists his sleeve up enough past the scars from previous injections to reveal his elbow as he takes a seat on the bed. The needle is actually the most difficult part. Dean doesn’t have the patience to keep the air bubbles out properly so he spends much longer on it than he should, injecting the liquid back into the bottle to start over as his fingers get steadily clumsier and his palms get unpleasantly damp.
A quick shower later, he’s staring at himself in the mirror again. He’s slipped a belt into his jeans and is only missing a shirt. His eyes are widened, less sunken and there’s a look of malformed determination on his face.
“right, right. something about how my eyes glitter like the moon?” dean asks, his tone is still jokey.
“Finally,” Dean says, “see you around… What was your name again?”
“Of all the things that have been thrown at you.
“Coffee?” she says with a smile that melts Sam’s heart. She doesn’t know. She’ll never know.
Those sad eyes stare at him, begging for assurance.
Dean doesn’t turn back. His hand is on the impala’s door handle when Sam grabs him and turns him around. Dean instinctively ducks from the blow Sam intends to land. Sam’s fist crashes into the driver’s side window and Sam turns back to meet another fist from Dean. Dean shoves him back and Sam staggers onto the impala’s side. Sam loses his balance and slides down the side of the impala’s back door as Dean kneels above him and lands another blow. And another one. And another.
She has no reason to not believe him. She eyes him as he darts around the room, packing more things into the bag. She’s concerned, but she doesn’t push it any further. He holds the bag at his side and leans in to give her a kiss. He holds the side of her face, fingers gently resting against her soft skin. It feels too final for Sam’s liking.
“I’m sorry,” Dean says after nearly twenty minutes of comfortable silence. His voice is low and awfully heavy with lack of use, and it almost doesn’t sound like Dean. It happens so quickly that Castiel is almost sure he’s imagined it. He stares up at the stars they’re sitting under for an awkward moment, realizing he has to try, even if he did imagine Dean speaking to him. Castiel looks down at the top of Dean’s head.
Driven by grief, the desire for revenge, and concern for how his kids might factor into the designs of Yellow Eyes, John had done the best he could. Dean couldn’t begrudge his father for raising them as fighters, it had saved Dean’s life a thousand times over. But, there had always been that thorny ‘
“Hey,” Dean replied, palms reflexively starting to sweat.
force myself to pursue other people to relieve your guilt.”
Castiel asked. Balthazar hung his head.
“Relax, angel,” he said through bloody teeth, skating his eyes up Cas’s length. “Dean here’s not gonna torture me. He’s not the type anymore, right?”
Typically, he’s unable to get back to sleep immediately, insomnia always waiting in the wings for him. So, he turns down the darkened hallways until he finds his way outdoors, dressed only in the robe, shirt, and shorts he sleeps in. He finds himself surrounded by brambles of blackberry bushes and the slick greenery of Daphne and tall grass, growing in the ditch nearby.
Someone had asked the question in Castiel’s stead. Was that Naomi? The tone was sharp.
Dean thumbed through the magazine Cas had picked up. It was one of those ‘Queen Elizabeth Gives Birth to Alien Triplets’ type of deals. “Let’s check the news,” Dean tutted skeptically, looking over the magazine, then up at Cas, raising his brow. “Did you know Jennifer Aniston is actually a lizard person?”
They’d gotten Chinese food and while Castiel was trying his hand at chopsticks, Dean had settled with the takeout container propped on his stomach, digging through his noodles with a plastic fork. They’d claimed Cas’s bed given that it was closer to the TV. If Cas had an ounce of self-preservation, he would’ve moved to Dean’s bed but, calling it stubbornness, he decided that given that they were on
“We still don’t know where the archangel blades are, or indeed, much about the fallout of Lucifer’s confrontation with Michael,” Castiel reminded Dean. He clearly didn’t know what else to do but shadow Dean. Dean didn’t know either. Dean swallowed.
Now Dean was older, he’d had a life without his dad. His dad would have to fit into
Dean had his hands elbow-deep in blood. Oxygen-red and slick, when he moved it clung to him and he slid that knife to the back of their ribs. Some demon, or would-be demon. This was the thing about Hell, it wasn’t fun for anyone, unless you were the one with the knife in any situation. Demons hated going back to Hell because it meant you fucked up, meant you were weak, meant you were, no matter how far you’d risen, at the bottom of the pecking order again.
“Good,” Cas says, trying not to sound too emotional, knowing how uncomfortable it would make Dean.
Gabriel had faked his own death, slain with a replica blade, and was intent on getting himself, Sam, and Adam out of the pockets of the Gods. “You’re cute,” Gabriel said to Adam. “No offense to Sam, but she likes
“Wait, what do you mean?” Jo asked.
Cas has to go to the bathroom again afterward, ever an anxious sleeper, and finally crawling back into bed and getting comfortable he notices Dean.
“First off, you’re gonna wanna get out of here before Mandy calls the police,” Dean said, glancing at the waitress, huddled in the corner. “But generally? Watch out for your family,” he said. “Try to get out of the big cities…” He thought for a moment, and made the decision on impulse.
Cas and Eileen had been out on a hunt together – demons again – or maybe witches.
The rumble of Cas’s voice greets Dean in the kitchen, warm and familiar. “Here,” he says, and presses a warm mug into Dean’s waiting grasp. “I made you coffee.”
“Hardly,” Cas joked, leaning in conspiratorially. Customers made that joke often. Dean raised an eyebrow. He didn’t find it very funny either.
“Jeez, Cas,” Dean said, leaning back to Cas’s regret. “Beer isn’t going to make you see little green men. It’s natural, but it ain’t shrooms.”
“Yeah,” Adam said. Dean sighed, tense. “Thanks for walking in there for me,” Adam spoke up. “I’ll be honest, I was considering it, saying yes to the Apocalypse. They had me. But I was a…an idiot. Now I know where we stand.” Dean’s face, indeed his entire body, melted into a genuine smile, relieved.
Losing Mary, the first time around, was a wound that had never healed. He’d grown up carrying around an old cut, bandaging it lightly to keep the dust and grit out, nursing a bruise. This was different. He’d known her,
“I,” Dean said, cheeks flushed. “Jesus. I’m sorry.” His fingers dug into the material of Cas’s shirt. Apparently Castiel had been still for too long. “Christ, I’m so sorry Cas, I thought that—God.”
Cas didn’t know Dean’s D.O.B. or, if he did, he didn’t care to remember it or know the significance of birthdays in general. That was fine. Dean didn’t feel like celebrating. Thirty-two years old. Ankle deep in an apocalypse he’d helped start. Dean felt like drinking, but not for fun. Still, they had a while to drive and Dean wasn’t about to throw in his hat just yet.
“Nah,” Dean agreed again. His mouth was hanging open, lips slightly wet with spit. Cas turned his eyes back to the road, trying to focus on the asphalt as it rushed beneath them.
Daphne was staring at him across the table. They’d already run out of conversation. Anything else would be to dig deep into disappointments and failed ventures. But, well, if they were to be husband and wife…“Daphne, I must ask,” Cas said. “Do you…” he paused. There was a better way to ask this question. “Do you know why they want us to marry?”
During Anna’s preoccupation, Castiel and Inais had gone door-to-door with each other briefly – proselytizing with him had been painfully awkward because, devout as they were, it was incredibly difficult to meet strangers and insist that you knew the answers to questions you were certain they had.
It doesn’t escape Cas’s notice that Dean died before he even took one break. Perhaps Castiel is one to talk, given how single-minded he can be when it comes to his own goals or obligations, but Dean deserves to take time for himself. Without guilt, without pressure to return.
, big brother.”
“You too,” Dean winked at Jess. She waved goodbye to him and Cas and headed back to her car. Sam smirked.
do?” Jo was asking Dean, her eyes narrow, disbelieving. Tempers were already short from the day they’d wasted, and Jo had always struck Castiel as equally as righteous as Dean, if not more so.
If they – if they reneged Cas’s deal with the Empty, that means –
,” Dean said firmly, though his voice was a little shaky. “Because
