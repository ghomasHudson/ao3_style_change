“It’s good to be happy, Sammy.” Dean lifts his head from the brick wall he was leaning against and smiles softly and Sam thinks it’s a good look on him.
“As long as you keep it PG,” Sam grimaces.
“The cat is coming with us.” Cas states like it’s not a question. And it really isn’t--Dean wouldn’t make Cas leave Balthazar, his fluffy orange cat, no matter what.
As things start becoming clearer, Dean realizes that he’s lying down right by a sewage drain on the side of the road.
Nobody is talking about how Dean wakes up from nightmares, still, terrified that John is going to come after him. He doesn’t have to worry about that anymore.
“Is that supposed to be--”
He keeps bringing them up, hoping Dean will show some sign of pain or grief, but he doesn’t. And Sam doesn’t care about the looks Dean gives him when he mentions bringing Cas back. He knows his brother better than he knows himself. He knows Dean is afraid of hoping, afraid of wanting, only to be let down. But Sam also knows that they owe it to Cas to try, because Cas never stopped trying for them.
“That went well”.
Dean glanced over at him once, the glint in his eyes saying he thought Sam was crazy, and puts the car in park. Sam climbs out first and immediately goes to the trunk.
“Birthday?” and so on, she continues asking questions. When she’s done, she prints something out and then gives Dean a hospital bracelet, putting it on the wrist that doesn’t hurt.
“Well that went well”. Cas says once they’re seated inside the Impala together. “Don’t you think?”
“He’s cute,” Sam observes.
“Yeah?”
“Dude,” Dean said, again at a loss for words. “That’s awesome. Who’s your brother?”
Sam clears his throat. “Yeah, look, I’m sorry. It was the only way—”
“I don’t follow.”
It’s really a testament to mess of their lives, the fact that Dean smiling so much is what tips them off. After that, he starts to notice the excessive laughter and the lectures. God, the lectures; lectures on how Sam should be happy because it’s what Jack and Cas would have wanted. How he should enjoy life because that’s what they sacrificed themselves for.
“Wait, so does that mean--”
“I don’t know. Just hang out.”
“So did you both fly in?” Sarah asks.
Dean, dressed in his uniform, was leaning on a crutch, one arm in a sling, and the entire area above his left eye bandaged but he managed to hold up the little girl effortlessly. Cas stood for a few moments before it finally sunk in--this was real. Dean really was right there.
Sam looks back to Dean, a bit fearful, and earns himself a grin and a nonchalant shrug in return.
It’s dark, but Sam can still see the tips of Dean’s ears go pink. “Right, I guess I kept that secret pretty well, huh?”
“Dean seems less guarded than the other day.” They’re sitting on the small couch in the hotel room drinking coffee. It’s not good coffee, but it could be worse, so they don’t complain.
“Dean, listen to me: You and Cas love each other, alright? There’s nothing you could do that would make him forget that. You’re getting married, Dean. To your best friend. The love of your life. So stop worrying, alright?”
“Yeah, I just wish I could tell him how proud of him I am. But the last time we saw each other, he was so mad… And I’ve never even asked him to forgive me.”
He turned slowly. Cas felt himself pale as he took in the sight of two tall men in uniform, coming through the gate.
“Husband.”
It had only seemed right to have Sam be Dean’s best man in his and Cas’s wedding. Who else would he have chosen?
Cas lied on the floor for what seemed like hours when his phone beeped. He flinched at first, hundreds of different scenarios going through his head on why Dean had disappeared. He only felt worse when he saw it was his alarm, telling him to go pick Mary up from her play-date with her cousins down the street.
“Dean talks about you all the time,” Charlie says. Sam snorts. “I’m serious. He practically introduced himself to me by saying, ‘Hi, I’m Dean. I’m an aquarius, I enjoy long walks on the beach and frisky women, and my brother Sam got a full-ride scholarship to Stanford.’”
There’s virtually nothing different about Dean. His hair is the same, he’s got the same kind of clothing as always: flannel, biker boots, too many layers for the summer heat. He even has the amulet around his neck still. But he looks a little different, too. For one, his worry lines have faded.
“Do you see him yet, Mary?” He asked.
“Uh,” he says. “Yeah. Yeah, I got it.”
Afterward, Sam, Dean and Sarah stand out in the parking lot together, the sun beating down on their shoulders.Sarah elbows Sam in the ribs, and he has to use all of his willpower not to yelp.
“The persuasion will come in the morning, I’m tired now.” Dean chuckles, tilting his head to kiss Cas’s temple.
Sam shrugs and scoots over to make room. They sit in silence for god knows how long. The night is getting colder and Sam is beginning to wish he’d brought a jacket, but he doesn’t plan on getting up from his position beside Dean.
“Sounds good to me.” Cas says with a wink. He then pulls Dean into the bathroom and toward the grimy shower.
Ultimately, Sam is persuaded to knock when an elderly woman walking her dog across the street starts giving him suspicious looks. He worries that she’s a moment away from going back to her house and calling the police to report him for loitering, so he grabs his bag, hauls it to the front door, and, before he can back out, knocks.
“Yeah,” Dean breathes, the ghost of a smile on his lips. “That’s what husband means.”
Dean fusses about leaving Miracle alone in the bunker, making sure there’s plenty of food and water in his bowls. Sam plays along, but if he’s right about this, they should be back before the dog even knows they’re gone.
“But I really don’t think you’ve payed off your debt yet.”
“Nice to meet you, Cas. I’m Sam, and this is Sarah, my fiancee.” Cas greets Sarah politely in response.
“You live in Lawrence? I do too.”
of solitude,
Dean is just about to answer when his phone starts ringing and he holds up a finger, turning around to answer it. The conversation isn’t totally understandable since all Sam can hear is one side, but he tries to listen in anyways..
There’s a twitch in Cas’s face, so small Dean swears to himself that he imagined it. But then it happens a second time, and he suddenly realizes what it means. Cas’ chest is moving up and down. His toes, which peek out from under the blankets, wiggle every so often. The softest of snores are coming from his mouth.
There’s a picture of the Chicago skyline on the postcard along with the words “Greetings from ILLINOIS” in big block letters. On the back, there isn’t even a note. Just an address. No signature, but Sam recognizes his brother’s handwriting from the countless times he’d helped Sam with his homework when they were kids.
Dean’s quiet for a long time before he puts an arm around Sam’s shoulders. Sam leans into him, feeling like he’s a toddler again, going to Dean for comfort after a nightmare. “You can stay here as long as you need, Sammy. And you can come back any time. I mean it. We don’t mind.” Sam smiles to himself.
After a short time in the car, Sam pulls into the parking lot of a chain restaurant he’s been to a few times before. For a brief moment, he thinks--hopes--maybe Dean hasn’t shown up, but one glance through the parking lot reveals the massive Impala Dean’s devoted his life to. He sits for a moment, not wanting to get out of the car.
Sam sits up and clears his throat. “Speaking of your family,” he says, “you have a husband?”
As both Dean and his husband are pelted in every part of the body, they rush up to the front porch of the house and run inside as quickly as possible. Even after they’re standing in the warm, heated house, a few snowballs are launched at the door.
“And he makes you happy?”
Now he’s here, holding the postcard in his hands, checking it again and again to make sure he has the right address. He isn’t sure how he’s going to work up the courage to actually go and knock on the door when he’d spent about an hour in the airport bathroom convinced he was going to throw up from anxiety. He should have rented a car. That would have given him a chance to get away if things went badly or, more likely, if he chickened out. Instead he’d gotten a cab and paid way too much for a ride all the way to Pontiac. A cab that’s long gone now.
Back when he and Dean were kids, Sam idolized him. He wanted to be just like his big brother. Then Sam went away to college and thought that had all changed. He thought he could finally make a life for himself, away from his family and the way he felt like they tethered him to the ground.
She runs up to him and hugs him tightly, like she’s never going to let go. She’s wearing a brown apron, one that all of the workers here are wearing, and her hair is tied up. It hasn’t been too long since Dean’s seen her, a few months maybe, but he’s glad to know she didn’t pierce up her face or dye her hair ridiculous colors when she came back in spite of her mom.
“I should have known not to bring romance to the war,” Dean says, playing along. Cas smiles a beautiful, gummy grin and cranes his neck to kiss Dean’s cheek.
“‘M not goin’ anywhere with you,” he mumbles. He wonders how everyone else that was gathered around is just letting this happen.
“It’s not weird” Cas immediately comes to Dean’s defense. “They’re really popular, especially in our area up in New York. He’s won multiple high-end contests with them”. Cas looks more annoyed than anything that he had to say that, and Sam gets the feeling that Dean still has a habit of being horribly self-deprecating.
“I told you, his name is Barry.”
“So his Grace, we’re gonna—”
“Dean!” is what he hears first when he enters the coffee shop. At first, he doesn’t know whose voice the words belong to, but his eyes fall upon Jo.
“How about we make some hot chocolate for everyone to have when they come in?” Cas offers as the two of them begin to dispose of their wet boots and coats.
“Nope,” she answered.
Dean slams the car door behind him and barely takes a moment to feel bad about it. Sam is calling his name but he doesn’t care. Sam wanted him to be miserable? Well, he got his damn wish.
Sam’s quiet for a minute, trying to think of absolutely anything he could say that Dean won’t take offense to. “So you have a kid,” he decides. “A whole kid.”
Dean pulls his beer away from his mouth. “Shit, Sammy,” he says. “I’m sorry. What was her name?”
“Cas’s life is with me.” He says simply, as if that’s enough to make Sam understand.
“To be honest, I wouldn’t even know.” Cas answers sheepishly and Dean laughs at him again.
“Nice to see you again, Cas.” Jo says, calmer than before. She hasn’t known Cas as long as she’s known Dean. “I was wondering if I’d be seeing you before the funeral, you know. Mom said not to get my hopes up, that you’re probably not in the best place right now, but I knew that you couldn’t pass up a chance to see me.”
He doesn’t feel right.
...Only to be interrupted by an ambush attack from behind. Dean pulls away from Cas and whips his head around to see everyone--even Grace, his own flesh and blood--standing with their hands in the air, releasing their snowballs one at a time.
Cas crouched down and wiped the wet hair from her face. “Nothing’s wrong, sweetheart. Your daddy’s coming home.” he said. There were audible gasps and murmurs coming from the party guests but all that mattered was the grin on Mary’s face.
For a moment, Cas just stares at the screen, confused by what he’s reading. Then, when it finally clicks, he covers his mouth with his hand and stares in awe. Where the hell is Dean?
“Deal.” Sarah smiles and kisses Sam’s hand which is laced around her own. “Hey, do you know if he’s bringing anyone?”
When Cas finally steps into the airport, he moves out of the way from where everyone is moving to check his phone. He has multiple texts from Gabriel where he’s ranting about the family and cursing Castiel for leaving a day earlier than him. He also has a text from his mother, who tells him that he forgot a few items of clothing and that she’ll ship them to him through mail.
“You mind if I get some fresh air?” Sam asks. Cas looks up from the stack of papers in his lap and nods. He motions behind him to the dining room where there’s a sliding glass door. Sam gets up from the couch and walks over to it, sliding it open and stepping outside. It’s chilly but it’s warmed up since the morning, melting all of the snow. There’s a fair amount of toys scattered around the backyard, a grill, and a nice wrap-around porch. Sam sits down on the top step.
They spend the rest of the day watching the episodes in order. The last one ends with the older brother selling his soul for his younger brother and Sam wants desperately to talk to Dean and ask if he’s planning to make any more and if so, what happens next because what a shitty thing to do, leaving the audience hanging like that.
“Good.” Cas answers and they’re quiet the rest of the way to Dean’s, save for him giving a few directions.
“So you’re moving out to Cali.”
“Our uncle Bobby always says “Family don’t end in blood.” Dean and Cas made their own family. When neither of them had anyone, they found each other and went from there. Growing up, I watched my big brother and looked up to him. He was so kind, so selfless, though he’d never believe it himself. But then Dean met Cas, the man who is responsible for finally convincing Dean of the wonderful person he is.
They watch the first episode. It’s only about 15 minutes long but it’s enough to understand exactly how Dean feels about how he and Sam were raised.
Dean glances over to his boyfriend, sitting in the passenger seat. “Thanks, Cas. I know it can’t be easy for you to pretend--it’s not easy for me to pretend, and I pretended for most of my life.”
There’s a brief description and a few reviews but Sarah doesn’t stop to read them. Instead, she pays for the thing and clicks play.
He blinked and then Mary was gone. He could no longer see her brown hair flowing behind her as she ran. Just as he was beginning to panic, Cas turned and saw that people were beginning to clear. And then, standing only a few feet away, was Dean Winchester, holding their daughter, smiling bigger than Cas remembered him ever smiling before.
Sam didn’t notice at first, when he looks at Dean he sees a steady stream of tears running down his face and he realizes Dean is defeated. He doesn’t want to have hope.
“It will, though.”
“He was supposed to come back to me.” Cas whispered. Then, louder, “He promised me!” Cas let a sob escape. “He promised he’d come back. He promised me, Sam. How could he lie?” He hollered, not caring about how uncomposed he was, not caring that he was embarrassing himself.
(See the end of the chapter for
Sam reluctantly turns to face her. She’s dressed in a t-shirt and jeans but looks nothing less than classy. Sarah always looks classy. Her hair is tied up and out of her face, which Sam loves because it makes her whole face visible to him.
The three of them begin aiming for their enemies but soon enough, they reach a patch of dead grass and there's no more spare snow. They need a plan.
Sam manages to convince Dean to pull off the road onto a dirt lane. Dean bitches about Baby getting dirty or her tires being ruined but he does what Sam asks.
“Bad word, daddy,” Emma reminds him.
Sam nearly falls to the floor on principle. “N-nephew?” he sputters. Dean ignores him in favor of retreating back into the house, leaving his brother blithering on the porch.
“You ran out in front of me and I didn’t see you,” Cas answers. It’s then that Dean remembers how late he is to work because he was, in fact, drinking last night. He was running through town, trying to get to the garage before Bobby noticed he hadn’t checked in. But hey, getting hit by a hot doctor’s car is as good an excuse as any to taking a sick day.
Sam blinks. “What?”
Cas and Dean order their drinks and then take a seat at a table by the window.
“Good. Okay, we’re at the hospital, do you think you can make it to the door or should I get a wheelchair?”
“Shall we sit?” Zach asks finally. The four of them all sit down around the table, and Zach gets down to business right away.
“So, Cas, I know you’re already paying for the medical bills, and you’ve given me a ride to and from the hospital today, not to mention letting me squeeze your hand when that evil bastard was setting my wrist--”
Charlie nudged him. Slowly, Cas stepped forward, trying to convince his shaking knees to keep him upright.
“Now we’re here. You know, I never pictured myself as a father. I don’t know, maybe I always wanted it, but I just didn’t think it was in the cards for me. But I wouldn’t change it for the world.”
“I’m a little sleepy, I was just hit by a car.” Dean growls.
“Like I got hit by a car. Hey, why’d you hit me, anyways?”
“Dean, Sarah has two dads. I highly doubt she’ll care either.”
is love.
“Jack,” Dean says, bending his knees to level himself with the kid. “This is your uncle Sam.”
“Things are good.”
“So, since I don’t know when we’ll be getting your new address to send a proper invitation, I should probably formally invite the two of you to the wedding.” Sam begins nervously. “It’s in September. We’re getting married on a beach not too far from LA, actually. It’s a small beach town where Sarah’s dads got married.”
Dean’s head clears up a little bit as they wait for someone else to come into the room. He’s able to breathe deeply and think about what’s happening. And he’s able to look at Cas again. The dude is seriously easy on the eyes.
“Alright, Dean, you gotta stay awake.”
“When do we start?”
They take a few breaks, once for snacks and once when Led Zeppelin’s “Rock and Roll” plays over the speaker and Jack makes everyone stop to dance. Sam nearly faints at the sight of his brother holding a three-year-old on his shoulders, dancing around the kitchen with a husband who’s trying to be stern but still smiling despite himself. Sam snaps a picture with his phone. He has no idea who he’ll show, but he isn’t sure he’ll get the opportunity to see it again.
“You wanna watch the rest?”
“That’s like, a little under 6 hours away from us!” Sarah grins, even though 6 hours isn’t anything to get so excited about.
“Cas.”
“Wait--did that girl say ‘why are you back’? Were you on your way home from work when you hit me?”
Sam follows and sees Dean approach Cas and Sarah who look to be chatting casually. Dean doesn’t hesitate. He sits down next to Cas and kisses him on the lips. Both Sarah and Cas look surprised.
“Yeah, well, not a lot of people do. That’s not to say you’re excused, Cas. I’m betting you have a foreign, environmentally friendly car, don’t you?”
Sam leans back in his seat and releases his nervous muscles. He sighs with a smile. “Thank you. I wasn’t sure, since we didn’t part on the best of terms.”
“Uh--you mean, you’re not straight? Or married?”
“You know it’s going to come.”
The guy looked to him, tilted his head, and blinked. “His name is Barry,” is the extent of a response Dean got.
When he finally falls asleep, it’s to the faint sound of Dean yelling at his husband for snoring in their bedroom upstairs.
“Dude, this can’t be normal,” the man says to Cas, eyes wide with concern.
Cas tried not to fear that Dean would be different. He tried to no avail. What if the things he had seen messed him up too much? What if he didn’t want Cas anymore? What if Dean wasn’t even Dean?
Dean looks at him like he’s grown two heads. “Jesus, Sammy, if you’re this awkward asking me to be your best man, I can’t imagine how you were when you proposed.” Dean rolls his eyes but smiles. “Of course, I’ll be your best man. No need for you to be nervous about it, man.”
The soldiers are silent, waiting to figure out what to do next. Dean scans the rest of the yard; Charlie lays on the snowy ground, wounded. Jess is holding her daughter on her shoulders, Mary’s arm raised in preparation for an attack. Jo sits on the porch, eyes wide an eager. Big Bobby(they have to specify now that there’s a baby Bobby too) is next to her, Dean’s toddler son Jack in his lap.
“Yeah,” Dean says. He glances down at the ring once and then back to Sam. “I have a husband.
“Damn. You don’t have to stay, you know.”
“I, um, I understand if you’d like me to go—”
Christmas Day breakfast--which is always a big deal in the Milton home--ended early with Gabe stabbing Mom’s wooden table with a fork, Michael throwing a bread roll at Gabe’s head, Anna throwing herself at Michael, and Cas rushing to pull her off. All the while, Luke sat back and watched with a smirk as his siblings tore each other apart. It was surprisingly, one of the less chaotic Christmas dinners he’s had in the past few years, probably because Dad was away on one of his international mission trips and wasn’t there to add fuel to the fire.
He went to New York one summer for an internship at a law firm. He went to Haiti on a mission trip. He’s been to Mexico, Canada, and even went backpacking through Europe the summer before he started Stanford Law.
Later that night, as Cas cuddles up to Dean’s naked and sweaty chest, he finds himself laughing.
“Can I help you?” the man asks. He’s squinting and tilting his head like Sam is somehow the strangest thing he’s ever seen. It’s not exactly unfriendly, but Sam gets the feeling the man would rather not have been interrupted from whatever he was doing.
Dean waits outside for Cas, stomping out the cigarette he just finished. He’s stressed, otherwise there wouldn’t be a cigarette to stomp out. Not only has his father just died from a heart attack (of all the things), but he has to deal with Sam, and he’s not entirely sure how happy Sam is about seeing him again.
“If you don’t do it now, you won’t ever. Plus, he’ll need to know ahead of time for things like suit fittings and schedules and his duties as--”
“Dean?” He raises his head where salty tears are now running and sees Cas. And seeing him, seeing Cas, such pure goodness that his father wouldn’t approve of, wrecks Dean. He slides his back down the tree, not bothering to care about how the bark is probably tearing up his dress shirt, and puts his head in his knees and sobs like a child.
“So, you an artist?” Dean asks, shifting in his seat so he can face Cas more directly.
“Dean, I never got to thank you for putting up with Joanna Beth up in New York.” Ellen says.
Cas still doesn’t leave.
It’s bright and sunny outside, the weather contrasting Dean’s emotions perfectly.
Cas stays true to his word and puts Sam to work. Sam peels potatoes, mashes cranberries, and yes, at one point he even finds himself elbow deep in a turkey. He cleans the living room, dusts the dining room, which is apparently never used, and helps Jack pick up his toys. He doesn’t mind, especially if it’s just the penance he has to pay before Cas stops looking at him the way he has been.
“What do you--”
“I’m no hot-shot professor, though,” Charlie says. “Just a tech nerd.”
“Because I’m the one who hit you with my car.”
“Okay, stop here,” Sam says when they make it.
How John was a great man, proud soldier, strong-willed.
Dean continued to stare, not yet being noticed by his neighbor. Again, the guy carefully moved his hand down to his bag where he pulls out another grape. This time, however, the animal climbed further out of his pocket.
“And now you’re here?”
Dean doesn’t say anything, just pulls Cas into a tight hug as soon as he’s in arm’s reach. Cas hugs back immediately, tightly holding on to his boyfriend.
“Thanks, Ellen,” Dean replies sincerely.
“Wow…”
“Like, famous art, or your own art…?” Dean asks. Sam looks at Sarah, whose eyes widen. She’s not used to people wanting to know more about her major--usually, people think it’s a far-fetched dream.
They’re sitting in the living room of their apartment in L.A., preparing to watch the finale of the first season of Dean’s show Supernatural. The only thing Cas can even begin to imagine Dean being nervous about is it being the finale, but he’s never nervous about the content of his show. He knows he’s good.
is love.
Cas pretends Dean is travelling. Pretends he’s driving down the backroads of Nowhere, USA with his obnoxious rock music playing from the speakers in the Impala. But whenever Cas catches a glimpse of the picture on the fireplace, the one with Dean in uniform standing stiffly in front of an American flag, he’s reminded that Dean is overseas, with nothing but a small, torn up picture of his daughter and husband to make him feel safe.
“Sir, you have a concussion--”
“Fuck, I feel like I got hit by a car,” he moans, squinting his eyes in an attempt to get them to focus.
“I wonder how Dean is doing with dad’s death.” Sam states randomly on the way to meet Dean at the restaurant.
“No thanks needed, Ellen. She was lost and needed a place to stay, I’m glad I’m the one who could give it to her.”
As Dean drives, he goes on and on about how it’s like old times, how surprised he is that his FBI suit still fits, how he can’t wait to get some good ol’ monster guts on his hands. But that’s the thing: this isn’t supposed to be like old times. They’ve been doing this their whole lives, they just defeated God—they deserve a little more new than some hick pie festival. Sam plays along because he knows Dean will back out if he knows what Sam’s real goal is.
Sarah snakes her hands around Sam’s midsection and hugs him from behind. She rests her chin on his shoulder and they stand there for a moment in silence. “You ready to go?” She asks eventually.
“Um, Sarah and I have a dog. And I just finished my first year at Stanford Law.”
“You’re right, I do,” Cas says, cheesy as ever. He then leans in and pulls Dean’s lips to own.
“We met a little while later. Started as friends, became more. Soon as we got married, we started the papers for me to legally adopt Jack.” Sam remembers Dean mentioning having a second kid earlier and he smiles at the thought.
They spend the rest of the night lazily making out. Aside from a few hickeys here and there, they don’t do anything more than kiss and grope each other. Cas probably assumes that Dean is too worn out to go any further, and for that, Dean’s thankful.
“Just give it time… I’m sure everything will work out.” Cas says, burying his face in Dean’s shoulder.
“Do you think I don’t know, Dean? Do you think I don’t see the way you carry around that jacket like your life depends on it? Do you think I didn’t see the way that you used to look at him?”
“No, it’s not-- I’d love to go on a date with you. In ten days, though, because until then you’re going to be resting and getting better.” Cas smiles and Dean lets out a shaky breath in relief.
“Yeah, you’re part of that, man.”
“Shut up,” Dean says, pretending to glare.
“I was kidding!” Dean says defensively, holding his hands up in defense.
Slowly, Cas pulls one of his hands from Dean’s grasp, sliding it up his arm and stopping only when he gets to the back of his neck. Dean waits for a moment, thinking that if he was to die right now, it would be enough. It would be enough for Cas to know that he’s loved.
When the waitress gets around to Dean, she’s unashamedly flirting with him, that much is obvious. But what isn’t obvious is why Dean isn’t flirting back. If anything, he seems to not even notice that the girl is behaving differently toward him than the others.
Charlie’s jaw dropped, Sam covered his mouth with his hand, someone dropped a particularly large present as they were moving to put it on the table of gifts. At first, Cas didn’t know what everyone was looking at. They were all looking past him, staring in awe.
“Dean,” he begins, taking Sarah's violent hint, “Would you want to have lunch with Sarah and me tomorrow? No funeral talk, just catching up?”
The waitress comes back then with a tray full of their foods. She hands them out and then leans on the table so that her chest is in full view. “Need anything else?”
Eventually, the Dean and Ellen break apart into a conversation of their own. It’s been a long time since they’ve last talked. Dean is nervous at the aspect of leaving Cas on his own but his boyfriend is talking to Bobby and his wife Karen, whom Cas has met on several occasions.  Sam, Sarah, and Jo are still talking and the few other people who showed up are chatting with Pastor Jim.
When he finally realizes that he’s just been staring into the house for too long, he grabs his bag and hurries inside. The entryway of the house consists of a staircase that leads to another floor and a coat rack in the corner. Sam sets his bag beside it in favor of lugging it around. To the left, there’s a living room and the right holds an office. Straight ahead, past the stairs, is a kitchen.
After class, since it’s the last class of the day, Dean rushed out of the room to find hamster-dude. When he spotted him, the boy was standing in front of his locker, holding the hamster in full view.
“I think so.” Sarah then begins her order and then Sam orders a Chef’s Salad for himself, earning a snort from Dean.
The man in front of him tilts his head but doesn’t react. “Sir, can I call you an ambulance?”
“I guess you got lucky this time,” Cas says and Dean huffs a laugh.
“I’m okay.” He said. Charlie glared at him, acknowledging his lie. “I’m trying to be okay,” He corrected. Charlie gave him a sympathetic look.
“The three of you make a beautiful family,” the woman says while scooping ice into Cas’s plastic cup.
“Why did you come?” Dean asks.
“I hope so.”
“You'll need to get to Los Angeles as soon as possible, you'll start hiring your team and making a script.”
“I’m studying art.” She says simply as she takes a sip from the straw in her water glass.
So, while Cas doesn’t know how to get Dean to stop shaking, he tries to be there for him by holding him as the plot of the episode unfolds.
“The flying! Humans really shouldn’t be able to fly--dammit.” The plane rocks forward and the man squints his eyes together tightly.
“You’re a good soul, kid. You ought to know that.” Dean blushes and rubs the back of his neck. “Your daddy didn’t know that, but we do. And that boy of yours knows it too.”
Dean is wearing pajamas as well, and his hair is sticking in every direction. He leans against the doorframe and crosses his arms over his chest. “I take it you got the postcard,” he says.
“Well, uh, thanks,” Dean takes a nonchalant sip from his water glass. He looks at Cas, who is kind of glaring at him. He’s been pestering Dean about telling them about the whole TV contract thing but Dean doesn’t want to make a big deal about it.
“Dean, how are you feeling?”
“This is an ugly car,” Dean says, before leaning his head on the window, suddenly very tired.
The other man frowns and helps Dean sit up, the small of his back leaning against the curb. The guy is in light-blue scrubs and as Dean looks past him, he sees multiple other concerned-looking people staring at him.
“I-I’m Castiel,” he said. By that point, event the children had gone silent.
Dean gives Sam his best bitch face. “Not helping.” Sam raises his arms in defense. Dean looks at himself in the mirror, hoping that he doesn’t look as nervous as he feels. “Were you this nervous on your wedding day?”
Without a second though, Cas ran up to Dean, hugging him as tight as he could. He choked out a sob and tried to hold himself up as best as he could but he collapsed to his knees and brought Dean down with him. Cas momentarily feared he would hurt his husband but Dean didn’t seem to care--he only hugged Cas back with  the broken arm, hugging Mary with the other, crutch already having collapsed to the ground.
“Dean Winchester.”
“Alright, bring him on back.” Cas then walks Dean to a room with flowers on the wallpaper and a fancy, high-tech computer coming out of the wall. Cas sits Dean down on the bed covered with a sheet of paper but he doesn’t leave. Instead, Cas sits down in the chair next to the bed while the woman stands in front of the computer and begins tapping the screen.
“Shut up,” Dean repeats, taking Cas’s chin and tugging on it so that Cas moves his lips to Dean’s once more.
He hasn’t seen Dean in roughly 6 years, give or take a day. Not since he left for college. Honestly, Sam has no idea what Dean’s been doing with his life lately. Sure, they’re Facebook friends, but Dean rarely posts anything. Even when he does post, it’s generally something vague that Sam can't even begin to understand, because that's how well he knows his brother these days. .
“I do too. But I understand. Your dad didn’t react well. You have every right to be anxious about this.”
“Papa!” Mary cried. She was wiggling around so Cas brought her down from his shoulders in fear that she might fall. “Papa! I see daddy!” She took off running before Cas had a chance to ask where. He tried to follow her through the crowd of people, not even bothering to care when he bumped into too many people.
Dean throws his head back and laughs. “Yeah, Cas. Like cars and stuff.”
“Let’s shower, and then I’ll show you around Lawrence.”
“He’s fine. Our sources tell us that your husband is on track to make an impeccable recovery. We’re to tell you that you’re the first person he asked for when he woke up.”
“I guess,” he answers shakily. Sarah grabs his hand and leads him out of the hotel. The humid air engulfs the pair as soon as they step outside, and Sam is reminded that they should be in Palm City, Florida right now, visiting Sarah’s parents at their house on the beach. But John’s dead, and regardless of Sam’s feelings on the man, he’s not going to miss his own father’s funeral.
In school, you’re only ever taught to respect veterans. You never learn how to keep breathing when the phone rings or when there’s a knock at the door. You never learn how to pretend you’re sane because it’s not fair that you’re suffering when someone you love is overseas fighting for not just their life but the lives of everyone else in the country.
It’s been six minutes since Dean Winchester fell back into his husband’s arms.
“What do you mean?”
He also wants to talk to Dean about the brothers’ relationship as portrayed in the show. He wants to know all about why Dean made the characters do what they did.
Castiel sets his bag of groceries down on the shoveled and dry sidewalk--Dean can barely see the items inside of it: two boxes of Christmas lights, a can of something that looks like whipped cream, and a package of toilet paper. Is it suspicious? No. Is Dean upset that there’s no pie in the bag? Yes.
Months had gone by. Summer came and Cas tried to be the best father he could be for Mary. That included hosting a birthday party for her on July 11. Her cousins were there. Her schoolmates were there. Even some of Cas’s coworkers from the elementary school had brought their kids.  She was having the time of her life, running around the yard in her bathing suit, enjoying the pool party Jess and Charlie had helped set up. Cas hadn’t even wanted a pool. It was Dean who wanted it in the first place.
“Is that—are you married?” Sam asks, not bothering to mask the surprise that’s most definitely showing on his face.
“I think you’re a hypocrite. You should have seen how much you were sweating. Dean, I thought you were going to give yourself a heart attack.”
“Hey, why don’t we see if we can find some of Dean’s movies,” Sarah suggests, already grabbing the remote and clicking around. The TV in the hotel is somewhat high-tech, it being able to connect to the internet and whatnot, so Sarah searches Dean Winchester. “I cannot believe you’ve never googled him!” Sarah exclaims.
Now, however, Dean is beginning to regret it. Sam has absolutely no idea how to comfort his nervous brother. Normally, Dean would turn to Cas when his palms start sweating or when his throat starts closing up but no, of course Cas is a traditional bastard who thinks he and Dean should get ready for their wedding in separate rooms. And Dean tried to tell him. He tried to tell Cas that ain’t nothing traditional about this wedding, but the other man wouldn’t have it.
Cas just keeps laughing. “You were so cute,” he tells him, leaning over Dean and kissing his neck.
Cas couldn’t make it to the bathroom, he only got as far as the kitchen sink before retching up everything he’d eaten that day. There was a picture on the fridge, one of Dean and Cas and Mary on the day they finalized her adoption--Mary, only a baby at the time-- was grinning widely and happily as her new dads held her and cried.
“Don’t know if you’d look great in cowboy boots, though. And personally, I don’t think that Doctor Sexy is half as sexy as you.” The guy laughs again.
It had been over a year since Castiel Winchester had seen his husband. Over a year since their daughter, Mary, had seen her father. Birthdays passed, holidays passed, milestones passed.
“If you say ‘deal’ I will smite you.” Cas states.
“Bring him along!” Sarah suggests excitedly.
“It went through? So my show is—“
“It did. I wonder if he’s leaving as soon as the funeral is over. How long are we staying?” Sam asks.
“Dean, wait up,” Sam calls, but Dean doesn’t stop. He storms up to the door of the bunker, ignoring the sound of his brother behind him,.
Sam is barely able to resist rolling his eyes. “Yeah, I know, but Dean, I think that means his body’s still—”
When they’re finally finished with all of the things on Cas’s list, Jack falls over onto the couch to take a nap and Dean goes to shovel the driveway of the snow from last night.
“I love you, Cas.”
“You’ve barely talked about him. You didn’t even tell me what had happened until you were wasted.”
“Happy Thanksgiving, Bitches!” The redhead says, pushing into the kitchen so she can put down the crockpot. “Someone come help me find a place for this.” Dean takes it from her and puts it on the counter while Cas hurries up to the other woman and takes the pies.
“Just… come here.” Dean says, pulling Cas up from where he was sitting on the bed. Their lips collide almost immediately. Dean groans against Cas’s lips, feeling comfortable for the first time tonight. Cas gently nibbles on Dean’s lips, not wasting time to run his hands down his boyfriend’s back to grip his ass. Dean pulls Cas down onto the bed.
“Shhhh,” she keeps saying, rubbing her dad’s arm which she is cradling in her lap. “It’s okay, daddy.”
“I’ve been taking advanced math classes for a while, now.”
The guy looked at him like he’d grown two heads. “No, that would be strange.” he answered.
“Have you gotten the call yet?” Cas asks when they wake the next morning. Dean has barely opened his eyes yet but Cas is eager to chat, apparently.
“So I can be as open with Cas as I want now?”
The pain had gone away months ago. Now he felt numb. People stopped asking for news about Dean and Cas stopped expecting it. They had only had a month left until he was supposed to come home when Cas got the dreadful phone call.
“I prefer Cas”. Cas has a firm handshake and a kind smile when he greets Sam. It’s enough to make a positive first impression for himself.
“You know, if you don’t push so hard, the crayons last for a longer time.” Cas tells the girl, picking up one of her crayons and demonstrating. Emma smiles and picks up a red crayon, rubbing it over a dog’s ear. Cas refrains from reprimanding her color choice and technique.
“Are you okay?”
Grace doesn’t answer, just moves into the line of fire and sacrifices herself to gather supplies. She begins making snowballs left and right, throwing them and her aunts and uncles and cousins alike.
Dean doesn’t let go of Cas. He climbs over him to the other side of the bed, all while holding his hand until he’s finally able to wrap his arms around him and pull Cas close.
“Beverages? For the enemy?” Cas gives Dean his renowned bitch-face. “Okay, fine. Hey, what are you going to do with the groceries you left outside?”
Cas shook his head. He sat down on the floor, back leaning against the sink where he threw up moments ago. “Dean.” He said. “Dean, Dean, Dean.”
When the plane finally starts to descend from the air, Dean’s reaction is a mixture of panic and relief. He curses loudly when the plane touches down but apologizes when Emma scolds him. As Cas grabs his duffel bag from the overhead compartment, he tries not to be upset that this may very well have been the only time he ever got to spend with the charming man. He doesn’t dwell, though, because he has to continue moving down the aisle or the other passengers are going to be upset.
He couldn’t place the culprit of the noise, it didn’t sound like anything he’d recognize from a school setting. He heard the clicking and flinched, and every time he thought it had stopped, it’d start again and he’d flinch again.
“He finished by acing all of his exams and a nearly perfect GPA .” Sarah says, sending Sam a similar look as to the one Cas just gave Dean.
Cas didn’t cry again after that.
“Thank you, Sam,” Cas says with finality. Sam looks down at his feet and nods.
“I was just thinking,” Cas begins. “Do you remember how you made fun of how nervous Sam was when he asked you to be his best man? And how you said you couldn’t imagine what he was like asking Sarah to marry him?”
It’s nothing, Cas knows. That’s where he is, surrounded by nothing. But he can’t shake the feeling that somehow, some way, he’s become something while he’s been here. He loses consciousness before he can figure out what it means.
“It is. I think it would have been nice to grow up here.”
“Sammy,” he coos with a toothy grin, patting Sam’s jaw with his hand. Sam laughs and bounces up and down, making Jack giggle.
“He’s definitely got a concussion, and possibly a broken wrist.”
The brothers have lunch together and learn a little bit about each other's lives.
Sam sits between Jack and Charlie while they eat. Across from him is Gabe, who tries to play footsie all throughout dinner. These people are loud and most of them drink a lot and make crass jokes, but Sam finds himself laughing harder than he has in a long time because of them. They treat him like he’s supposed to be there, and he’s starting to think maybe he is.
“Of course that means you’ll have to help us get ready for the meal. We have some friends coming over.” Cas begins walking to the kitchen. “It really is convenient that you showed up so early. Dean refuses to shove his hand in the turkey, so—” Cas motions for Sam to follow him into the kitchen.
Sam stares open-mouthed and the pure domesticity of Dean’s life. Dean, married with a son in a small, midwestern town. With a husband.
“What?”
“You and Cas?”
“It is going to become a televised series, yes. The contract is for one season, and the ratings on this season determine if you’ll have more. You’ll have script writers, but as the director and creator of the show you have full creative control. So you can use the basis of your films for the plot but you’ll have people who are going to write out the full episodes.”
“Good.”
“Sam.” Dean says, getting up from his chair. The younger brother cringes, not liking the way the one-syllable version of his name sounds as it comes out of Dean’s mouth.
“I--uh-- hit him with my car,” Cas says.
Eventually, he feels Cas starting to face. He starts pulling away longer so he can breathe and his arms have fallen slack against the bed.
“How was I supposed to know she’d blog about it? Anyways, I just… Sam was raised differently than they were. You know, we were taught that this is wrong and if he’s anything like I was when I figured out I’m not straight… I guess I just don’t want to ruin--not that there’s anything les to ruin--”
“Hey, Cas… No, it’s fine… I will text you the address… It went well… Yes, I behaved myself, thank you… okay, see you in a bit… uh-huh… me too, bye.”
She clicks on one of the first websites that shows up. It shows a chart with a bunch of titles and ratings next to them, all of them relatively good. The first title reads “The Woman in White” and Sarah clicks on it.
“And Cas is nice.”
At around two in the afternoon, Jack announces that the first guest has arrived by shouting from where he’s been perched by the window for the better part of thirty minutes.
Cas looks up to see Dean walking toward him, a sleeping Emma in his arms. He’s carrying way too much, a duffel bag, a diaper bag, a backpack, and a little girl, but the sight is amusing and Cas laughs. He’ll have even more to carry once he picks up his checked luggage.
Cas doesn’t wait before pulling Dean up from the ground and hugging him, tightly. He kisses him hard, over and over again, before hugging him once more and murmuring “yes” into the crook of Dean’s neck.
“I’m here, Dean.” Cas said. He looked into his husband’s eyes--directly into the emerald irises he hadn’t seen in so long, and kissed him. Dean’s lips tasted just as he’d remembered. They kissed for a while, neither wanting to let go of the other. When their breathing got heavier and they had to part, they rested their foreheads on each other.
Slowly, Dean raises his eyes to see who the voice belongs to: One grumpy looking Castiel Novak, standing on the sidewalk, holding a brown paper bag of groceries and sporting a face full of snow. Dean almost feels bad.
“I can see that,” Sam says, a sort of distant smile growing on his face. “And Cas? Why is he going with you? I mean, I’m assuming that’s what you meant when you said ‘we are moving’.” Dean looks down and even through the dark, Sam can tell he’s nervous about something. “What? I mean, you guys are obviously close, but I figured Cas’s life is in New York…”
“And he’s your—”
“How would you know that?” Cas asks, surprised. Most people aren’t quite as knowledgeable on the subject of angels as his parents were when they named him.
It’s only about a minute more before the theme song to another cartoon starts playing on the television and Jack squirms out of Sam’s arms to go watch.
“Really,” Cas says. “What made you decide to come?”
Miracle is there, curled up with his head resting on Cas thigh. He’s wagging his tail like nothing is wrong, as if waiting for Dean to come and join them. When Dean does nothing of the sort, just stands and stares, slack-jawed and weak in the knees, Miracle lets out a quiet whine. Normally she’d get a bitch face in response, but Dean is still looking at Cas.
“No, it was sweet. You were sitting with your knees to your chest like a kid--”
“Sam--”
“Have you gotten the call yet? About the show?
So maybe it wasn’t a great idea to have this snowball fight right in the front yard, but this is the first year Dean has hosted the Christmas get together for his family and he wants everyone to be satisfied. So naturally, when his niece and nephew, Mary and little Bobby, asked if they could have a snowball fight, Dean couldn’t refuse. Of course, it hadn’t helped that his own daughter, Grace, had used those irresistible puppy dog eyes on her dad--they were the last things he saw before he caved.
“Hi, Dean.” Sam struggles, but he manages to get the words out. The brothers shake hands and stare at each other awkwardly before Sam realizes that there are other people around. “Dean, this is Sarah. My fiancée.”
Sam, still processing the band on his brother’s finger, is overwhelmed with anger that he didn’t know, shame that he didn’t think to call Dean and talk, and surprise that his brother managed to settle down. At first, he doesn’t even really register what Dean said. When it sinks in, he all but gasps. “A husband? You—You’re married to a man?”
When Dean was deployed the first time, it hadn’t been for longer than a few months. The second time, it had been roughly seven months. It was hard, yes, but the waiting was never this bad before.
A young woman approaches moments after they sit down. “Can I get you started with some drinks?”
They’re interrupted by an ear-piercing wail from somewhere inside of the house. Instead of showing concern, Dean sighs and pinches the bridge of his nose. “Grab your bag. You can meet your nephew.”
“Yeah?”
Sam doesn’t bother looking at him. “Recognize anything?” he asks.
“If my yard is torn up from all of you running through it when the snow melts this spring, you’re all going to fix it,” Castiel says. Dean begins to worry that the man is angry when in a sudden, swift movement, he bends down and creates a snowball, nearly perfect, and launches it at Sam Winchester’s perfect hair.
Dean frowns. “What—”
“Yes, I had just finished a 12 hour shift.”
“Cas,” Dean said. “Cas--”
“Daddy!” Grace screeches just as Dean is hit square in the forehead with a snowball. Slowly, Dean raises his eyes to find the culprit; his own brother is standing there, a glint of betrayal in his eyes.
Chaplin Lafitte told Cas that as soon as Dean was well enough to travel, he’d be on a plane home. Cas hadn’t even let himself hope that it’d be only a week before he was standing in the airport, his daughter on his shoulders to help him scan the crowd.
“Dean, I’m sorry,” Sam says, and it sounds like a plea. It occurs to Dean then that he isn’t the only one who lost Cas. He was Sam’s best friend too.
Dean smiles at that and the two then exchange phone numbers. As Cas is driving his car home that night, he thinks he really does love flying.
Maybe he and Cas actually do have a little in common. “Oh,” Sam says, because what else can he say?
Dean is too distracted to see where his weapon went until he hears a soft yelp: the victim of the wayward snowball.
“If the battle ever ends, I’ll go get them back.”
Dean lifts his head up from where he was leaning it on the wall. “Why would you do that?”
And Dean, Dean should have known it was too good to be true. The spell was too easy, too fast, too perfect. That should have told him. That should have told Sam.
“That was all Sammy,” Dean says proudly, somehow finding the will in himself to speak. Cas looks at him when he does and his face is soft, maybe even sad, like he too is remembering what he said before the Empty took him away. “S’why you’re human. He figured, you know, if he destroyed your Grace, the Empty wouldn’t want you.”
“Oh,” Sam says. He hadn’t really considered that himself, seeing as he was drunk when he bought the ticket. “I, uh, I’ve had a rough go of it lately. To be honest, I was tired of being alone. I think I just wanted my family.”
“Touche.”
“Hey,” he says, voice softer than Sam is used to, getting Dean’s attention. “I’m going to bed.”
The chat quietly for a few minutes, the TV low in volume, playing something from some local television station. It’s only about 3:00 in the afternoon and there’s really nothing to do. The funeral doesn’t need any more planning, they’ve already eaten, and there isn’t much happening around town.
“Well, it’s just… I’m dealing with it, you know? I mean, I’m upset, but I’m handling it. I’m talking to you, I’m open about my feelings for the most part, but Dean has never been that way. He’s always been so guarded and felt the need to defend dad.” Sam pauses and shakes his head. “Their relationship was more like a drill-sergeant/soldier king of thing…”
Sam offers to start on the dishes after dinner for something to do and Charlie offers to join him. They stand side by side at the sink. Sam washes and Charlie dries and puts away since she knows the kitchen better than Sam.
Dean stands there and stares for several more minutes, just to make sure it’s real, then leaves the room in search of Sam.
“I broke a window at home, because I threw a book at it when I was frustrated, and my brother said he’d take the blame for me if I was able to bring my little sister’s hamster to school and keep it with me all day.”
“For anyone who doesn’t know, my name is Sam, and I’m Dean’s brother. I wasn’t there when Cas and Dean met. I wasn’t there watching them fall in love. But I had known Dean before Cas, and I know him now. The first thing I thought when I had reunited with Dean was, ‘something drastic must have happened in these past four years’, and it did, and his name was Cas.
“Yeah, I’ll believe you if we don’t fall to our deaths.” he says.
Tis the end, my friends.
Six minutes.
“You know, I don’t think Cas likes me very much.”
“You can count us in, Sammy.” Dean says. “Congratulations--both of you, I’m happy for you.” Sam grins and looks to Sarah who is also smiling widely.
“L.A..”
“Castiel. Or Cas.” Cas would reach out to shake Dean’s hand, but he really can’t, since the man has gone back to gripping the armrests.
“I don’t–” Sam starts, but he shakes his head and starts again. “Um, I’m looking for Dean.” The man’s face stays expressionless, so Sam clears his throat. “Dean Winchester.”
“Where does it film?” Sam asks.
When Sam had helped Dean set up the extra folding table at the end of the regular dining room table, he hadn’t expected it to be entirely full. He hadn’t expected his brother to have a real, honest to god life.
“Honestly, I expected this from you, Dean,” the dark haired man says, “but you, Grace? I thought you were better than this.” Dean looks down to his 6-year-old daughter, happy to see that there’s not a single trace of shame on her face.
“Then how could I ever have a problem with you guys, Dean. I’m happy for you.”
Cas runs over to Dean, groceries forgotten on the sidewalk, and crouches down behind their makeshift blockade. The left wing is weak, but there’s no time to fix it now.
“No, but there are some ingredients still in the grocery bags in the car that will help us bake a pie. I figured Ellen might be able to give us some guidance since when we try on our own the pies never turn out well.”
“Oh, Dean.” Cas crouches down in front of him and lifts his head. “Dean, babe, you need to get up.”
“Is he going to be okay?”
Sam hadn’t expected to ever see Dean again.
Can you at least talk to me?” Sam asks as Dean begins unlocking the door.
“Okay, Dean, I’m Castiel. Or Cas.”
“How are you feeling now?” Cas asks.
“Come here, little bee,” Cas is saying to the boy, pulling him from Dean’s arms. He goes easy, turning his head so it’s now pressed into Cas’s shoulder. “Let’s go watch some cartoons.” Cas carries the boy out of the room and Dean watches until they’re both out of sight.
“Cas.”
under the burden
“Yes.” Dean can’t help but laugh.
Reaching up with his right hand, Sam waves to get Dean’s attention.
“Look, daddy.” Emma says, lifting her book up and showing her dad the messy artwork on the coloring page with the dogs.
"Sam, really, we’d love it if you stayed.” Cas still doesn’t smile, but he looks genuine enough.
“So, like, cars and stuff?”
They finish cleaning in silence. Dean pauses at the sink for a moment. “Okay, I think everyone’s stopped crying, now. You wanna meet them?”
“‘M awake.”
But for the first time since he was a child, Dean doesn’t have to stop at enough. He doesn’t have to accept the bare minimum. He presses his lips against Cas’s and doesn’t even feel embarrassed at the tears he knows are falling from his eyes onto Cas’s cheeks. It doesn’t feel wrong, or uncertain, or any of the things Dean has told himself repeatedly to keep himself from doing exactly this.
The man before him, Cas, stares at Sam for a few more beats before his eyes begin to widen as if he’s piecing together a puzzle. “Wait here,” he tells Sam, and the door is closed in his face.
“Yeah, well at least I’m afraid of something that’s actually dangerous. Clowns, Sammy? They don’t do anything but make kids happy.” Sam’s face reddens and he glares at his brother.
Everyone raises their glasses and Dean stands up to hug his brother. He makes a joke about “chick-flick moments” and Sam punches him in the shoulder, but the sentiment is still lingering and Dean sits back down with a smile on his face. Cas takes Dean’s hand in his own and kisses it, smile very prominent on his face.
“Oh, I’m sure we wouldn’t be wasting our money. What do you do, Cas?” Sarah swiftly deflects Dean’s negativity.
Sam makes his way to the table and sits down, a smile on his face.
“And he always got the worst of dad’s rage… when dad would come home, drunk and angry, it was almost always Dean with the black eye the next morning.”
Dean still doesn’t say anything, but he turns to face Sam and tilts his head so he can see the book.
He’d noticed earlier that the house is cluttered in photographs, but he hadn’t seen the one on the table beside the couch until now. It’s one of the few pictures that survived the fire back in Lawrence, only it’s blown up so it’s big enough to fit a frame. Sam, Dean, and their parents are standing in front of a tree outside of their house, smiling at the camera.
Dean wants nothing more than to hear Cas’ voice, to look him in the eyes, once more. But Cas is human. The last time that had happened, it had taken much out of him. The least they can do is let him recuperate in the way humans are meant to. “No, let’s let him sleep.”
“I don’t fucking know, I just-- What if this is a mistake? Or what if Cas realizes he’s making a mistake?”
Under the burden
And maybe it was dumb of him to assume Dean would welcome him with open arms on Thanksgiving, of all days. He could have sent a letter in the mail, or dug around until he found a phone number. Anything would have been smarter than this.
“Oh,” says Sam. “Yeah, okay then. Thank you.”
He wasn’t clicking his pen or tapping his pencil, it didn’t sound like that’s what it could have been anyways, but he couldn’t get over the sound.
“Okay, good enough,” Sam says.
“Did you not catch that?” Sam asks. Dean’s blank look is enough of an answer. “Our entire lives and I’ve never seen you turn away from any breathing woman who was flirting.” In a single instant, Sam sees a blush grow on his brother’s face and disappear.
“Always so pushy. You’d think you’d have a better attitude toward the man that secured your show a contract for television.” Dean can practically hear Crowley rolling his eyes.
“Wow, that’s very nice.” Dean says, taking the book in his own hands. “You ready to start a new page?” He turns to a new page in the book, this one has flowers, and puts it back in front of his daughter on his tray.
“Dean is terrified of flying.” Sam informs Sarah with a smirk.
“Cas?” A voice calls from inside of the house. Immediately, Sam recognizes it as Dean’s. “Who’s at the door?”
“He wants you to pick him up,” Cas says. Sam, mildly horrified, obliges. He reaches down and hooks his hands under Jack’s armpits, lifting him up. Jack wraps his legs around Sam’s waist and links his arms around Sam’s neck.
Dean nods. “Yeah, me too.”
The last skype call they had was more than three months ago, and the last letter Castiel received came only a few days after that. It wasn’t weird at first. Dean sometimes went weeks without getting in touch. There were times where Dean wasn’t able to contact home for a multitude of reasons, most of which were nothing to worry about. And Cas always had faith that Dean would come home to him, so it wasn’t like he anticipated anything bad happening to Dean.
For the first time in his life, happiness feels more than just an emotion. It’s a state of being. It’s a part of Dean.
Dean couldn’t be dead, he promised he’d come back--
“Are you staying for Thanksgiving dinner?” Cas asks.
Dean blushes and closes his eyes. “I recall,” he says.
Dean nods. “That’s where Emma’ll go in a few years.”
It’s perfect and Dean doesn’t even care that people might see him because nobody’s opinion of him could change how happy he feels right now, so Dean goes back to focusing on his boyfriend’s lips.
“It is pretty cool, isn’t it,” he runs his hand down his face and smiles, “thanks Sammy.”
“Thanks, Meg.” Cas says as she walks out of the room.
The excitement fizzles out eventually and the two women finally notice Sam. “Who’s this?” the redhead asks.
“That was then. I’m glad you asked. Oh, Sarah, am I going to be dancing with a pretty friend of yours? A sister, maybe?” Dean asks with a wink.
“Oh, I believe it. Freakin genius, in’t he,” Dean laughs. “Well, congrats Sammy. What about you, Sarah? What do you do?”
“That actually makes a lot of sense,” Dean laughs. “Which school do you teach at?”
“Yes?”
“That’s it, I don’t want to marry you anymore,” Dean says, turning over on his side.
“They are really good, aren’t they. One might even say they’re good enough for television.” Cas says. Sarah and Sam look confused.
“Silly, daddy,” the little girl next to him laughs. She has red hair, but other than that, she looks almost identical to her father.
“Okay,” Cas says, putting a hand on Dean’s cheek and kissing him. Sam does look away now, because no matter how happy he is for Dean, he’s still his brother. “Goodnight, Sam,” Cas says. “I’m sure we’ll be able to get to know each other better tomorrow.”
There’s ringing in Cas’s ear. He backs up so that his back his the wall. Tilting his head back, Cas lets himself breathe. He finally lets himself breathe, a single tear escaping from his eye. He wipes it away immediately.
“Wait--that makes you Castiel. You’re a freshman, what are you doing taking a calculus class?”
Cas watches in amusement as the little girl continues soothing her nervous father. Her nervous, yet very handsome father. Cas shakes his head--best not think those kinds of thoughts of a man he may never see again, who also has a child and most likely a wife.
“I’m a mechanic.”
“Yeah… Yeah, sleep would be good.” Dean shifts to his side, curling around Cas who is facing away from him. “Um, they want to have lunch tomorrow. You and me, Sam and Sarah.”
“I just woke up, and we haven’t spent any time apart since the last time you asked me, what do you think?”
Sam raises the postcard that he’s still holding in his hand. “He, uh, he sent me this address. I assumed he lived here.”
sorry this is so short compared to the others.
“He might not have used those words, but I knew how proud of you he was the day I met him.” She puts a bowl in the cupboard and turns to face Sam. “You might not be able to tell, but you being here made his day.”
Dean stands up, a deep laugh bubbling up from his chest as he puts his arm out to pull Cas up. “You’re such a child,” Cas says, though his smile tells Dean that he doesn’t really mind it.
“Maybe, but it’s your wedding. You have to ask.”
Dean sighs, running a hand down from his face, and then he finally starts to smile. It’s small, barely there, but it’s something. “All the hotels are probably booked. You can stay here.” That’s all Sam needs to hear before he’s wrapping his arms around Dean. Dean huffs and pats Sam on the back and whatever this is, whatever this becomes, Sam decides it’s good enough.
“Dean’s alive. He’s coming home, Sam.” Cas said, tears welling up in his eyes again. People began to cheer and Sam fell to the ground. Charlie ran up to Cas and hugged him, and he squeezed her so tight she complained.
“What should we do, Gracie?” Cas asks.
“Huh? Oh, no. I mean, I’m not presuming anything. I just, you know, haven’t checked into a hotel yet.”
“Sounds like a plan.”
Still, all Cas wants is to be in his own home with his own bed and his own blankets wrapped around him. But he instead has a five hour flight ahead of him.
“So, it’s good to see you happy, Dean.” Sam says, joining Dean outside of the restaurant. He left a few moments ago, said he needed some air. Cas offered to join but Dean declined with a smile.
Sam can’t help but feel ridiculously happy as he looks from the woman he loves, to the brother he loves, to the man his brother loves.
He bursts in through the door to the coffee shop with a grin.
“Thank you, ma’am,” Dean says, suddenly awake. The flight attendant nods and smiles, handing Cas his drink and then pushing her cart further down the aisle.
“Oh, I’m--uh, sorry to hear about that.” Cas feels awkward and regrets bringing it up.
“Sir-- Sir, you have to stay awake.”
It’s quiet again.
“I never thought you were the L.A. kind of guy.”
The younger leaves to attend school while the older stays with their dad and continues hunting.
Cas grabs Dean’s chin and lifts his head up. “I know. I know you don’t. I know this is hard.” Their eyes meet and it takes all he has for Dean not to look away in shame. Cas smiles softly and runs his thumbs under eyes to wipe the tears. “Come on,” Cas says, and he leads Dean back to where everyone is gathered. The burial is over but people are standing around visiting each other and looking at other headstones.
“Is, uh, is everything okay?” Sam asks, crouching down to wipe the floor that is now sticky from spilled juice.
“Damn right,” Dean says, earning himself a soft smack on the chest from Cas. “Sorry. Darn right,” he corrects, rolling his eyes.
“I don’t have anything to say.”
Sam nods at him in return. The music was turned off a few minutes before so that everyone could calm down, leaving the house much quieter than before.
“So how’s things?” Dean asks before he lifts up the menu and takes a look at it. He sets it down not long after, seeming to have already chosen what he wants.
Sam sat down, pulling Cas’s head to his shoulder. They both sat there, shaking, until the sun went down.
“Sam, you’ve gotta calm down. Dean is your brother, okay? And I know I don’t know him, but from what you’ve told me, he loves you. So let’s just see this through--see how things pan out.” Sarah holds on tightly to Sam’s arm which comforts him more than she can know.
Sam fixes him with a look, one he knows Dean can identify, but Dean just turns away. “You know what.” Dean doesn’t move and Sam sighs. “Listen. I know you’re scared. I know you’re afraid that if you get your hopes up and lose this high you’ve been on, that it’ll hurt even more this time around. But Cas deserves more than what he has right now. And I think we need to give it to him.”
“I’m just anxious, Dean. I wish Crowley would just call you already.”
“Yeah, you too, man.”
“You know, when I met Dean, he thought emotions were things to be ignored. Drowned in beer. He’s better, but he still struggles with sharing his feelings. But he’s thrilled you’re here. I can tell.” Cas isn’t looking at him, but Sam stops wiping the counter and watches him talk. “He’s been so nervous ever since he sent that postcard. He didn’t think you’d want to get in touch with him.”
Cas is wiping down the mess in the kitchen so Sam decides to lend him a hand. He takes a washcloth from the sink and runs the faucet over it, then begins to scrub the countertops.
“Castiel? Like the angel?” though Dean’s getting more delirious by the second, he notices the surprise on Castiel’s face. People probably don’t often understand what his name means, Dean imagines. “Did it hurt when you fell from heaven?” he asks, a dreamy smile on his face.
He’s pulled from his thoughts when a cold bottle taps his shoulder. Sam looks up and sees Dean taking a swig of a beer and offering one to Sam. “Mind if I sit?”
“Our lives.” Sam whispers. Only instead of bad guys, his dad hunts the supernatural and the names are different.
Both Cas and Sarah seemed to have noticed, given the looks on their faces that must mimic Sam’s.
Dean just laughs and pulls his boyfriend up and out of bed. “You know you’ll have to come with me, if I get the deal.” They walk to the window and look out at a busy street. Dean wraps his arms around Cas’s bare stomach, holding him from behind.
“He’s missing, Sam. They said the likelihood of him being found--alive, anyways--are slim to none. Sam, he could be dead. Dean could be--”
Cas was sobbing by the time he shook the hands of the two men and led them to the door. He was hiccuping and wiping tears as he walked out of the house and to the party. Everyone was waiting silently, watching the door in anticipation. All of Lawrence knew about Dean. They all wanted to know what was going on.
“Fine, don’t. But I am. You can wait in the car.” Dean doesn’t move and neither does Sam. “Why don’t you just admit it?”
When they part ways, Sam is more confident about his and Dean’s relationship. He feels like, if anything, they might stay in touch after the funeral which happens in two days.
Cas was pacing the living room when someone knocked on the door. He didn’t want to answer it. More than anything, Cas wanted to go to his bed, no, his and Dean’s bed, and sleep until someone called and told him that Dean was alright. That he was coming home because Dean had to be coming home. He just had to.
Sam hand Dean spent more time together than any normal siblings ever would. Together, they’d been through more than what should have been possible. Sam was under no pretense that their lives were anything close to normal. Things should have ended for them a long time ago. But they didn’t.
They get ready in silence. Take separate showers, get dressed apart. Dean watches the road somberly as he drives to the cemetery. They’re not having the service in a church since John was basically the opposite of a believer.
Dean raises a finger at Sam, pointed in his face like he’s a disappointed father scolding his son. But he doesn’t say anything. He just lowers his hand and turns away.
“It’s perfectly safe,” Cas says, hoping he can add a voice of reason.
Each time the door to the run-down restaurant opens, Sam gets more nervous. Eventually, Dean comes through the door. He’s wearing a red button up over a black t-shirt. His pants are old and torn but they fit him and that’s something that really makes Sam a little nostalgic. He’s not used to seeing his big brother in clothes that fit him. Dean always made sure his little brother had what he needed, even if that meant getting crappy donated clothes for himself that were almost always too small or too big. He’s still wearing the amulet.
“Small world. What about you, where are you coming from?”
“We’re fine, thanks,” Cas sort of growls. Sam turns his head abruptly, surprised to see Cas’s cheeks look a little flushed. Maybe Dean gets hit on a lot--that would get annoying after a while. Whatever his reason, Cas gets her to go away. Dean chuckles and nudges Cas’s shoulder with his own.
“Son of a bitch,” Dean mutters as Sam giggles and runs to hide. Dean doesn’t have much time--he makes as many snowballs as possible within his restraints and then he’s on the move.
“Lawrence elementary.”
“You’re so good looking, you could play Doctor Sexy,” Dean slurs. The other man chuckles but keeps his eyes on the road as he turns a corner.
“Let me take you out on a date?” Dean nervously glances at Cas’s face to see his eyes wide and immediately regrets saying anything. “Unless I’m totally misreading everything, in which case you really have already done more than enough--”
“Yes, which is exactly why you can’t go to sleep.”
Dean looks at Cas with wide eyes. “Answer it!” Cas all but yells.
There’s Cas’s brother Gabe who winked when Sam introduced himself. There’s Donna and Jody who are accompanied by two younger girls, Claire and Alex. Cas’s British friend Balthazar comes holding two bottles of black-label Johnnie Walker. The last group of people to arrive consist of a guy named Garth with big ears and a frail body, his wife Bess, and a set of triplets that can’t be more than a year old.
“In my life, there was very rarely any certainty. I never had anything stable to fall back on, until I met my wife. She’s a security blanket for me, and I know now that my brother has that too. And I couldn’t be happier having Cas as my new brother-in-law. There’s no one else I’d rather see my brother go completely soft for.”
