… Please, put your finger inside.” Sherlock breathed into John’s mouth, gasping softly every time John’s finger dipped shallowly into his hole. “I can cum on prostate stimulation alone.”
“You drive a Prius?” Sherlock blurted as he sat down in the seat and pulled the door closed. John laughed and waited for Sherlock to buckle his seatbelt before pulling out into traffic.
“Do you believe in love at first sight?” John asked pulling back and looking deep into Sherlock’s eyes.
“Sherlock, you know the Statute of Secrecy exists for a reason. It protects us from being exposed to the Muggles. I don’t need to tell you how they have historically reacted to our kind.”
Sherlock pulled open the draws on the trolley that sat next to the bed, he was looking for something in particular. If the hospital staff were any use they would have left a syringe here somewhere.
Sherlock landed with a thump on the floor next to his bed. He was rock hard and covered in sweat. “Oh god!” Sherlock groaned and grasped himself firmly, he only had to stroke himself twice before he was cumming all over his hand. “Fuck!” Sherlock shuddered and collapsed back onto the floor.
Spot, John’s old retired dairy cow and Billy the goat were the funniest creatures Sherlock had ever met. Billy was under the assumption that she could stand on top of anything and everything. Including Spot. Sherlock had just stood still and blinked stupidly for several moments when Spot came trotting over to John with the goat standing tall, riding the cow’s back.
heartbreaking. He would need to inform his brother about his new companion, but it wasn't clear yet how much he could trust John. Sherlock’s eyes met John’s and they continued to stare at each other.
As much as Moriarty called himself a genius, it seemed he was no match for Sherlock Holmes. The detective had already spent the last three months tracking down and dismantling the so-called ‘criminal web’ Moriarty had built. So far, it appeared that he’d done so undetected. If Sherlock had his way Moriarty wouldn’t know he was onto him until he was snapping the handcuffs around his wrists.
As John made his way towards his subway station he heard muffled shouting and the unmistakable sounds of fighting. It was coming from down the dark alleyway between the buildings to his right. Feeling a spike of adrenaline John turned down the alleyway and made his way as quietly as he could towards the source of the noise. “Oi!” John shouted he could just make out two people struggling.
“Immobulus!” With a thump, Moran’s back smacked onto the pavement, his whole body stiff as a wooden board. “John! John are you alright? John!” Sherlock was shouting again, his wand movements were frantic as he lowered John into his arms.
Sherlock couldn’t stop giggling, which made John smile. “Sherlock, I’m trying to get you off here and you won’t stop laughing! It’s like you’ve been hit with that laughing jinx you showed me.”
“It’s summer there now, opposite to us.” Mycroft took a sip from his tea, ignoring his brother's attempts at bargaining. “It’s got to do with the position of the sun, which I know you find boring.”
“Eight.” The Captain was panting too as he pushed Sherlock’s hips down into a dip again. His cock pressing lightly against the ground. His hands slipped down and around to the front of Sherlock’s trousers and squeezed his cock.
The whoosh and crackle of the fire catching pulls Sherlock's attention back to his new companion. There is a thick long silver scar that Sherlock hadn’t noticed before, that starts up under John’s armpit and extends the length of his torso, disappearing under the band of his white elastic trousers. On both sides of the scar are little white dots, the wound must have been surgically stapled closed. Why was John covered in scars? Why was he being held prisoner in the Alps? What did Moriarty need him for?
“Yeah, okay.” John nods, he can’t believe Sherlock snuck into his dressing room before the ceremony. John had wanted to follow muggle tradition and not see his intended spouse in all his glory until the moment they met in front of the celebrant.
“Used to fancy myself an eco-warrior when I was in Uni.” John let out a self-deprecating laugh. “God I was a drongo.” Sherlock frowned, and glanced over at John he wasn’t sure what a ‘drongo’ was. “Nearly got myself run over by a bulldozer,” John continued, “protesting against the deforestation down in Tassie a few years back.”
“I-” Sherlock hesitated, he’d never really thought about after. He tried to imagine twenty years from now, having to retire. Sitting alone in his flat, watching the fire die, the darkness and loneliness creeping in. How long would he last without the work before he succumbed to old habits? Then the image of John’s house flashed before his eyes. Tending to the bees, sowing seeds in the vegetable garden, driving that stupid electric blue Prius into town for romantic vegetarian meals. Waking up next to John, every morning, shoving Captain Barks off the bed when they were trying to have sex. It was everything he wanted and more.
‘IT’S RHUMER TIME!!’ An ornately bejeweled, geisha drag queen with a microphone stands atop the karaoke stage, announcing the bar’s signature event. A throng of waiters stride out from the stage with trays full of rum and pear shots. One beelines toward Greg and John, and places a tray down on the table they’d managed to secure during Sherlock’s informal interrogation. They look up at Sherlock who arrives just after the drinks.
Greg looks hesitant ‘I…..’ walking toward the living room, slowly, and lowering his voice ‘Could I?’
‘Dust, pieces of tile flung all over the living room, and Sherlock was right there in the middle of it, I was so worried. I started shouting to him but he couldn’t hear he, and-‘
‘Sherlock it’s not now! You know I’m not getting married tomorrow! We’re just confirming the location. The wedding is still set for next week.’
Greg ‘And what about the tape? It’s the most important proof, we could easily solve the case with it’
Two middle-aged women stop Sherlock, looking excited and surprised ‘Sherlock Holmes! The real one! Oh my god, How are you dearie?’ ‘What happened yesterday? ‘Can you please sign this for my daughter, she’s such a fan of yours’ One of the women snaps a photograph of Sherlock with a deerstalker from her bag. ‘Who’s this new enemy? They say he’s a friend of Moriarty’s?’ ‘Do you remember that man? He was so evil, but he looked so good.’ ‘The telly said you were dying in bed!’
‘The home is cold. The heat went off after the explosion. You must wear something Sherlock or you’ll freeze.’
Victor is dressing, putting on a blue shirt and dark blue trousers with a brown belt. He takes hand cream while looking at himself in the mirror. Sherlock is sitting on the sofa, chatting with his phone, Victor’s dog is next to him.
‘No, this must be placed there, right there.’ She fusses, pointing toward the kitchen. She complains, gesturing wildly with her hands, ‘What a mess!’
John takes a long breath ‘Well, it seems that since he’s back into Sherlock’s life, they’re back doing what they did when they were teenagers’
‘Okay, you’re going to give him the shot into his heart, so you’ll have to through the breastplate, okay? It’s a bone, and we only have one shot, alright?’
‘<<I saw you passed by and came back at home….I know…there are still your footprints on the door step…they don’t want to go away…I saw your new shoes and I stole them, I thought you wanted to go away forever….and with a note on the bag I wrote you: I wish you’ll find love in the world, I wish that you’ll find the job you love, I hope that God will guide you, I hope that the sky will always give you sunny days, I hope that your health will be always ok, whenever you are, wherever I am, wherever you sit, wherever I sing..’
Molly and Greg look at John and Sherlock exchanging nervous questions and upset answers at each other.
‘Come inside, and make yourself a drink’ Mary gestures toward the bar, and heads back to the bedroom.
- ‘Ah!’ Sherlock maddeningly moans, carelessly crumpling the sheet. He returns to the computer, sitting in front of the glowing screen with wide eyes. His elongated fingers are typing rapidly when he is alerted to the arrival of another message:
‘No, they aren’t, they are artistic, you always say nude is artistic so what’s the problem with it?’ Sherlock replies annoyed
‘Doesn’t matter. It was easy. He’s working at a friend’s bar. Terrified someone will find out about Adair’s secret message.’ Sherlock’s voice boomed through the phone, and his speech became rapid, before Lestrade interrupted him.
And then there’s the second kind of happiness, the one you predict, a moment of happiness you plan, and you know it’ll arrive soon. In my opinion, this is the best kind of happiness: waiting for it. Usually, it last longer than the first kind of happiness, and it’s more beautiful to live the wait than obtain what you’ve waited for. You can taste each second, each minute, dreaming about it. Sadly, this kind of happiness lies on dreams and melancholy, because it’s more beautiful to wait and dream for it, than actually live the moment, because when the moment arrives you’re so caught by it that you don’t really understand what’s happening. And once you have happiness in your hands you don’t want it to slip away and you feel uncomfortable, because you want to enjoy the moment but you’re also scared it’ll past away soon.
“You must go away, and never come back again. I’ll give you the privilege to not be guilted for what you’ve done. But you don’t have to kill Sherlock, and you must go away from here. Far, far away. And never come back again.” Victor stands up, taking his phone. “Do what I told you...if you want to save your life.”
‘Helping him? How? letting him taking drugs and getting drunk? What kind of help is this....you can’t say he’s helping Sherlock if you do admit he’s dangerous for your brother’
Sherlock gets closer to him, reading his notes “You got shot..." John suddenly freezes up, noticing how close Sherlock is to him, he can almost feel his breath on his neck, and hear his heart beating. He turns a bit on the left, looking at his profile, not hearing his words, with a strange urge to kiss him, dreaming of the past, remembering the last time Sherlock got so close to him: Sherlock was sitting on John's sofa, in his dressing gown. He was sleepy, tired, his eyes half-closed when John walked in the living room....
‘John….I should talk you about…’ Greg sees John is still looking through the cab window, not turning toward him ‘John’
‘I don’t have him on my telephone book, I neither have him on facebook, I’ve never heard him before!’
John, breaks eye contact, and pulls his hands back. Clearing his throat, ‘I uh… I think we chose the worst moment to talk about this.’
Mycroft strolls past him and out the door without comment. It’s not until he’s halfway down the stairs that he calls out, ‘Goodnight brother.’
Greg frowns, shocked and surprised, not sure about her intentions. “And what about the Holmes brothers?...and John?”
"For what?” Victor hold back the tears, but his voice shakes “Everything I created...everything I dreamt about was destroyed, every piece of it, for what? nothing, for something I didn't. I spent months and....years to save money...to open my winery, and come back here, to stay here....to...meet you again, and have a job as teacher...And now I’ve lost everything."
Lestrade notices a tall figure with a strong gait, and a steady umbrella, ascending onto the landing. ‘Where’s Sherlock?’
Mycroft comes in, out of breath ‘WHAT THE HEL-‘ he looks at Sherlock crying while holding the paper ‘Sh...sherlock..’
‘What?’ The minister turns around, not understanding what’s happening, Mycroft whispers words to Anthea in the ear, she walks quickly toward the door. Mycroft stands up and goes toward the telephone.
John stands and gazes longingly at the pale man; his arm on the floor, his curly mop of hair, his face shoved into the pillow. ‘Are you going to be okay?’
They both slowly walk toward Sherlock’s bedroom, Mycroft supporting his brother as he limps. Eyes half-closed, the bags under them almost black, Sherlock’s mouth dry lips tremble. Greg and John watch on silently, palms sweaty and stiff, as the Holmes boys disappear behind the door.
Sherlock takes the moleskine on the other pillow with his right arm, and leafs some pages, in his bed, reading
‘You’re welcome,come back soon boys! We have many accommodations for young gay couples, byeeeeeee' The Clerk warbled after them.
‘Nothing… the clothes.’ He replies, not looking up and instead pointing vaguely in the direction of Sherlock’s bedroom. John and Greg look at each other in confusion. As Mycroft jogs back to the bedroom, John steps in front of him, blocking his escape. John insists, ‘Mycroft wait! Do we need t-’ Mycroft moves John to the side, continuing on his way. As John stumbles over his words, Mycroft clarifies, ‘Do anything? I don’t know. Not yet at least.’
‘What did you take Sherlock? What did you take?’ Sherlock’s incapable of answers, so John starts slapping his face hard, grabs takes the phone.
‘Good Morning!’ Lestrade sarcastically replies, as he munches on his breakfast. He sits at his desk, crumbs scattered about, with his computer loading. Upon watching Sherlock slam the door he lets out a, ‘What the hell?’
“Well…that’s amazing. I had heard about this research years ago, I can’t believe it actually came to fruition,” John said, his head slowly shaking in amazement. “And what’s the word on your nose?”
John felt the bed move as Sherlock rustled beneath the covers. “Kay.” Slender fingers crept up on John’s forearm and the doctor stared up at the ceiling through the darkness, attempting to keep his breathing slow and regular. John covered the fingers with his other hand, encapsulating Sherlock’s.
But then Sherlock’s face changed. It was a look that John had seen before – a strange fear that crept into his face, when there was something of an emotional nature he was seeking to communicate. It reminded John of a fearful child, reaching out to touch something new, filled with uncertainty, but tantalized by the reward.
“Mm-hmm,” Sherlock walked over to John’s chair, stood beside it, and proceeded to hug John’s head to his stomach. “But lon-lee.”
Sherlock texted at that same moment. The flatmate’s shared a smile, Sherlock’s a bit lopsided. He must have felt it, because the detective raised a hand to cover his mouth, his eyes filled with alarm. John pretended not to notice.
“To be honest, Molly, he’s being a bit more of a recluse than usual. Let him get healed up a bit more and we’ll see, yeah?” This was part truth, but the fact of the matter having someone intrude on their quiet little life, where John was in charge, was disconcerting.
“Mycroft! How kind of you to be here,” John said dryly. “Keep this up, and Sherlock may think you care.”
Finally, the patient collapsed against his pillows, exhausted, his one exposed eye sunken deep. John gathered the bandages, glancing at his phone when it buzzed.
And John knew the answer to his restlessness, to the unanswered questions that haunted him: the life of being just flatmates was over. They were still partners in consulting detective work, but now they were
Slowly, John turned on his side to face Sherlock, and placed his hand on the detective’s cheek, so that his fingertips caressed Sherlock’s good ear and the fringe of short hair that surrounded it. John felt Sherlock stiffen for a moment, then relax under the doctor’s gentle touch.
John kept his hand on Sherlock’s forehead, rubbing his thumb against the rigid furrows, until the eye closed and the patient exhaled deeply. John moved his hand and rested the back of his fingers against Sherlock’s cheek. There was a thin sheen of sweat there, an unhealthy heat being exuded.
After Sherlock went to bed that night, falling asleep to the sound of John reading the paper, the doctor puttered around the flat. He was restless. It had been a wonderful day – Mrs. Hudson was soon joined by Lestrade who heard as well that Sherlock was home. The detective kept to his chair, not talking much, but seeming to enjoy the company and not straying to hide out in his bedroom as before. He even flipped through the files again at Lestrade’s urging, which John did not interrupt. John could not be certain, but he thought he saw a little bit of that old fire in Sherlock’s eyes. John could feel something, too, an itch, an inkling, a desire to be back out there and at ‘the game’ again.
“Ef I toomaurrooo, thees ees awl yooors,” Sherlock said, gesturing to the room and the flat beyond. His eyes beseeched John to implore him to understand.
John loved cabs. Always did. They were his preferred method of transportation, and he had let his license lapse a long time ago. In his younger days he had associated them with the tart smell of chums after a rugby game, the sweet scent of a young lady after a date, and now that he was older, the hum of excitement when investigating a case with Sherlock. They weren’t always comfortable or fast, but John would trust the driver to get him to where he needed to be. Right now, the gentle sway of the vehicle was putting the doctor to sleep. Except his cell phone kept buzzing and the man next to him was poking at him to answer.
Molly paused, uncertain, but then nodded with a smile. “That would be nice. I heard his nose looks really, really good,” she said.
“How are you feeling about later today?” John asked. Sherlock looked up at his flat mate with a frown. “Bandages are coming off today, remember? No more mouth breathing. New nose. Sleeping laying down! Much excitement to be had!”
John shook his head, wondering why he was calling it that. It was more like a mistake, an ego-driven error on the behest of the detective, going up against a 125-kilo 2-meter tall adrenaline- and heroine- driven criminal who flung the lithe Sherlock across Molly’s lab tables at the hospital. The result? Four broken ribs, chemical burns on his right arm, hip, and…the right side of his face. The acid in the beaker that monster had ground into the side of Sherlock’s face had literally melted the man’s right ear, burned off his hair, and eaten away at his cheek, the side of his nose, and the skin surrounding his eye.
As much as John found being the caregiver gratifying and empowering, John realized that Sherlock was not comfortable in the role as the patient. He would have to be careful of the detective’s ego and not belittle the man in any way. Sherlock was helpless and exposed, not an existence that he was used to.
“I know it’s hard to talk. Listen, I chatted with the speech therapist. She showed me what to do. Some exercises to start with.”
“Oh, that is so kind, thank you,” John said, taking the tray from her. “Could I impose on you for some biscuits? I haven’t had a chance to go to the store yet.”
John hit send with a pleased nod and took a sip of his steaming tea. He turned in his chair and gazed out the window overlooking Baker Street, taking a moment to appreciate the morning sun warming the flat…and thinking about last night.
When the doctors and a nurse arrived, toting instruments and equipment, Sherlock nervously and rudely denied them tea and steered them to his bedroom. He lay on the bed while they removed the dressings, the inner supports and packing inside the nose, and suctioned and examined him. One doctor stood on either side, John at the foot of the bed, pretending not to be nervous. The doctors soothed Sherlock through it, and although he lay as still as a mannequin, John watched as the detective’s fists clenched in pain through the uncomfortable process. John brought over additional lamps as the stitches were carefully removed, one by one.
Sherlock answered with a grunt, a response John assumed was as close to a ‘yes’ as he was going to get. John moved the lamp closer and carefully set about his task. He leaned over Sherlock’s head as it rested against the pillow, methodically checking and cleaning each wounded area, applying the proper ointments, and finally bandaging it up with the least amount of material that he could. He hummed. This is where he excelled – he may be slow on the draw on drawing conclusions that would solve a murder, but he was an outstanding doctor. But as intent as he was, he noticed Sherlock didn’t have his usual...Sherlock smell. That smell of old books and chemicals, of that certain spice that John had never been able to pinpoint was a cologne or shampoo. It was missing, cleansed away by the sanitation of the hospital.
“Oh, no, goodness, you fatten Sherlock up, that poor boy. And you, too, John. Gone and lost some weight yourself, have you?”
“Kay,” Sherlock mumbled, pulling John into the bed, long arms encompassing him. They spooned, John tucked up under Sherlock’s chin and his back to the detective’s chest. “But not sleehpy now.”
“No!” Sherlock barked, pushing John away. Then more quietly, repeated, “No. No more. I’m awl done. Theees is the last. Make it, eh, fine.”
It was as if time had stopped for John. There was only this moment, this room, this man, this feeling in his heart - of hope and confusion.
“Ey – ey fine,” Sherlock lay a hand on John’s cheek as he began to stroke. Without realizing it, his thumb touched John’s lips and the doctor turned his head and took it into his mouth and sucked. Sherlock groaned, deep and desperate, his mouth no longer able to focus on kissing, too absorbed in the sensations that were flooding his body.
Sherlock’s face was twisted with emotion – rage, surprise, helplessness. Hands on his head, he spun around, and paced the room. John stood, letting the detective work it out, feeling his own heart pound loudly in his chest.
“Everything….is going to be all right,” John whispered slowly. Sherlock gave a gentle sigh, the wisps of his breath caressing John’s cheek like a warm, summer wind.
“Yes, let’s go, I’m sure you are tired of this bedroom,” he said, shaking himself out of his reverie. He turned around and Sherlock put a hand on each of the doctor’s shoulders and they trundled to the living room. John insisted on twice around, a stop at the loo, then deposited Sherlock into his chair. As Sherlock picked at his breakfast of a poached egg, light toast and tea, John piled the laundry by the flat’s door. They were both startled – but, not surprised – by a delivery of fresh sheets and groceries by one of Mycroft’s minions. John could not help but notice that Sherlock roused himself to stagger to the bedroom while John was busy, only the rustle of the newspaper floating on his desertion breeze to let anyone know that Sherlock had left the living room.
The waiting room was a large lounge area with one whole wall of windows overlooking the parking lot and blue-gray tired furniture. An offering tray of sandwiches and bottled waters sat on one of the tables. John attempted to watch the tele, but ended up shutting it off after a few minutes, annoyed by the talking heads of the news shows and the canned laughter of the sit-coms. Instead, feeling a restlessness, he pushed back the furniture and dancing on his toes, boxed at the air until sweat beaded his brow.
The contentment of a few minutes ago was gone. John hung his head and forced the heels of his hands into his eyes. He was floating again, groundless, not belonging, a creature rejected.
“Yes, you are!” John said to himself, rising from his chair and entering the bedroom. “And feeling better?”
“Careful, now, everything is still very tender. The nurse will set you up with a nasal flush, which you must perform regularly and gently, three times a day. There will be a bit of pain at first, but nothing your meds can’t take care of easily. Finish the antibiotics…anything else, Dr. Wadsworth?” Dr. Ballard said.
“As much as you would like to, I can’t keep everyone away forever,” he consoled. Sherlock responded by flipping over on his side and pulling the covers up to his ear. “I’ll let you rest, then, and be back in when Dr. Wadsworth is here. And you better be nice to her,” John said, pulling the door closed behind him; but he did have the most satisfaction when he heard Sherlock’s head lift from the pillow to watch him leave.
“You two used to be in and out, chasing people, explosions, clients -,” her hands flailed. “I don’t know if you will ever get Sherlock to come out of his, well…depression.”
“Would you like a mirror?” Dr. Wadsworth offered kindly. Sherlock regarded her with hesitation, but she pressed her cell phone, set on selfie-mode, into his hand. With a glance at John who nodded encouragement, Sherlock carefully looked into the phone.
“There,” he said, surprised at the thoughts running through his head. “That should feel a lot better.”
“Well, shit,” John whispered as he hit SEND. To his surprise, Dr. Wadsworth’s reply came in a few minutes later as he was lost in thought, staring at the screen.
“Very cute,” John replied, relishing the feel of their hands together. John had resorted to at first sleeping in the cot next to Sherlock’s bed after the recent surgery. Sherlock needed plenty of space and pillows to sleep sitting up, but no matter what, the detective could not sleep comfortably. Sherlock would toss and turn, pound the pillows, get up and pace, grumble and stomp. When he did manage to sleep, he grunted and snored. John did what he could to make the poor man comfortable, but in the end, the doctor had to retreat back to his bedroom upstairs to be able to get any sleep himself. Sherlock had understood.
“Oh, you won’t,” John replied, taking a moment to catch Sherlock’s eye and nod reassuringly as he warmed the stethoscope between his palms. “I’ve got you. Here, let me listen.” He released the two top buttons of Sherlock’s pajama shirt, placing the instrument against the firm pectoral of the patient’s chest. John perhaps took too long to listen, letting his hand linger on the pale flesh, his eyes demurely studying exposed almond-brown nipples. He could count on one hand the number of times he had seen his flatmate shirtless, most of them occurred when Sherlock had a thought in the shower and he would fly out of the bathroom, one hand gripping a loose towel around his waist, the other gesticulating. John had always wondered how the detective was able to maintain a near-perfect, chiseled physic by barely eating and a lack of fitness program.
“Bloody leeches!” John seethed, his blood pressure rising. “Someone must have seen you at the hospital and put the word out. They probably got a ten pound note for it – bastards! Keep going, round the block, the long way!” John put his hand on Sherlock’s back reassuringly as the detective cowered against the seat, his forehead resting on John’s thigh. John called Lestrade and in twenty minutes, coppers arrived to push back the crowd so John and Sherlock could finally enter their residence. With his collar high and his deer stalker low, there was not much the photographers could get for a picture, but they shoved and jeered none the less. Sherlock was white and shaken, sagging against the wall after they had run up the stairs.
“It’s okay, I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to startle you. Looks like all this has been giving you some early greys,” John said easily. “Don’t worry, it’s very appealing. Here, you won’t be able to see…let me show you on my phone. There you go – oh, now don’t frown. Gray is a feature of maturity, you know!”
“You’ve been doing great. I know this is a hard road,” Dr. Wadsworth chimed in as she entered the room with a nurse who proceeded to push Sherlock out of the room.
John ran his hands down over his stomach self-consciously, noticing that yes, he had dropped some weight since the incident. There was little time or thought for nourishment when your best friend was an injured and high-maintenance as Sherlock. John’s stomach rumbled.
“Yes, I’m okay,” John replied, surprised, but then quickly realized Sherlock was putting up his front, placing his line, telling John not to baby him. The nurses, the circumstance, already made the detective to feel vulnerable enough. There was certainly pain, but John would address it when Sherlock determined it was time.
John slid out from under the covers and padded into the living room, where Sherlock, fully dressed, was standing by the window, hands tucked into his pockets, overlooking Baker Street. He turned to John and smiled his lopsided, very endearing smile.
“Jawn,” Sherlock dropped his head into John’s neck, body quaking. They stood, locked together, for a long moment. John could have stood that way forever, holding this man, breathing him in, comforting him, but from what? Why was Sherlock so afraid? They had been flirting for a month, was the genius having second thoughts? Then John felt Sherlock’s whispered words against his skin, the detective’s face still tucked in against his neck, like a child hiding from a monster.
“Jaw,” came a call from Sherlock. John beat a path to his bedroom. The stitches and bandages that covered them encircled the right side of Sherlock’s face and over the top of his head, restricting his speech, so John was very happy to hear him attempt talking at all. The detective raised to fingers to his dry lips and tapped them when John entered the room.
John had been sleeping on his back and when he awoke, raised his head cautiously to investigate the weight on his forearm. His eyes traveled down his arm, to Sherlock’s hand, to Sherlock’s arm that had bridged the gap between the two beds, to Sherlock’s resting, unfevered face.
John thought better of it, and hit SEND before he changed his mind. He had been impressed with the doctor, an intelligent and kind woman of Mediterranean descent with large brown eyes and long black hair and olive skin. She was no nonsense, the only doctor to give Sherlock’s attitude right back to him, making the detective respect her just a bit. She was the one who John went to when he decided he wanted to bring Sherlock home, and she understood and assisted him with arranging it.
“I promise,” John groaned, arching his back into the erection behind him. Sherlock pushed down John’s briefs with quick hand and shimmied out of his own silken pajama bottoms, laying the length of his stiff cock into the crack between John’s bare buttocks. Sherlock began to move against him, his hand on John’s hip, the sweat from their bodies and the leakage from Sherlock providing lubricant between them. John flexed his arms again, wanting to grasp the curls that tickled his neck, but Sherlock did not let go. John moaned loudly at the feeling of being captured, contained, rolling his head back in ecstasy. Sherlock slid his wet lips along the exposed skin, teeth grazing his neck.
“Okay – like this – EEEEEEEE.” John stretched his lips wide across his face, jaw clenched and teeth bared. “Come on, now, Sherlock – EEEEEEEEE.”
“You need me to tell you…what happened,” John recited. “Oh, Sherlock, at the lab? When you were attacked? You mean all this time – you did not remember?”
“I’m sorry. Please. Go ahead,” John soothed, clenching the arms of the chair again in an effort not to reach forward and take Sherlock’s hand. The detective took in a massive breath and began again.
“Well, someone realized they were starting to disappear at a more rapid rate than usual. Of course, everyone blamed the supply Sargent, but he had a peanut allergy and didn’t go near the bars. He had the only key to the supplies, and the men decided he should relinquish it to me. Voted most trustworthy, I guess. But I’ll finish this some other time. Big day tomorrow.”
Reluctantly he let his hand drop, then moved over to the IV to increase the flow of much needed hydration. John’s mind, now in doctor mode, created a mental checklist, determining what medication would be needed and how he would obtain it without the knowledge of Dr. Wadsworth.
Even now, looking at Sherlock out of the corner of his eye while pretending to read the paper, John knew he would be fine. He would recover, he would heal. He would show them all.
Sherlock nodded, eyes already closed, breaths coming slow and easy. John reluctantly slid off the bed and fussed with the covers and adjusted the IV and heart monitor lines. A nurse came by to check in, assuring John that he could stay the night in the bed in the other half of the room. As he opened his night bag in preparation, he felt the crinkle of newspaper underneath his spare clothes in the bag. Sherlock had packed it without John’s knowledge.
“You little devil,” John whispered with a grin. “Had to make sure that I would read to you. Well, I promised.” He pulled up a chair to Sherlock’s bedside, unfolded the daily, and cleared his throat. “Aha, here’s a good story, let’s start here: ‘London officials have determined that the cause of death in yesterday’s Ardent Street murder….’”
An ear in a petri dish? Its actually real: https://ideas.ted.com/a-promising-way-to-grow-body-parts-using-an-apple/
John nodded and glanced over at the detective, who had taken a sudden and immediate interest in a speck of dust on his violin. There was still a white tent of a bandage over Sherlock’s nose, but it was more to hide the injury than to promote its healing. The wound was scabbed and the remnants of the appendage damaged and misshapen.
“I’m fine,” Sherlock murmured as he crawled up over John, his fingers creeping up under his shirt and his lips on John’s neck. The doctor shivered but otherwise did not move, letting the detective explore him piece by piece, long fingers unbuttoning his shirt, touching his chest and neck and shoulders and arms. His eyes were now cat-like, cataloguing, assessing, and yes, enjoying. Bare chest to bare chest now as Sherlock brought a knee between John’s legs and pushed against the modest erection, quickly reviving it.
“I’m afraid you are going to be stuck with me,” John replied, his hands on his hips. “I’m your John, and you’re my Sherlock.”
“Of course, right this way. Excuse us, Mr. Holmes,” Bethany escorted John to an adjacent office, and released an exasperated sigh. “My God, how are you that man’s friend, I’ll never know. God bless you and your patience! I’ve worked with 4-year-olds that are more cooperative. Oh, Dr. Watson, I’m so sorry!”
Thank you for all your kudos and comments, I am so pleased this little story has become meaningful! And...I just have to share...I became the patient of unexpected nasal surgery last week. For real. Art imitating life imitating art, eh?
“Now, I need you to roll on your side, I’ve got to check that hip.” John lifted the covers, feeling the heat that was released from beneath them. Sherlock floundered to move, so John placed a hand on the man’s shoulder and the back of his thigh to assist him. When he pulled the pajama bottoms down over the hip, he found that sure enough, the bandages on the detective’s hip were soaked with drainage.
Where John once thought a bridge had been crossed, feelings expressed, fear breached that night when Sherlock had lain his cheek in John’s hand – no, he had been wrong. Obviously. John was just a good man.
“It’s all good now, Sherlock. Its John. You’re home now, it’s all good,” John kept up a string of quiet words, not really sure what he was saying, just anything to reign Sherlock back in. Finally his patient quieted, one wide eye looking at John, a string of silent tears streaking down the side of his face.
And there it was. The testament, the truth. Sherlock did want this. A sob escaped John’s lips as air gushed back into his lungs.
“All right, all right,” John continued and slowly dismounted. When he went to release Sherlock’s wrists, the detective’s sweaty, shaking hands wrapped around and held on to John’s, his eye searching for reassurance. John felt a flood of emotions fill his chest: he adored this man, his best friend, who had taken him in and fixed him. Now John was more determined than ever to make Sherlock whole again. John gave a small reassuring smile and Sherlock released the doctor’s hands.
The kettle hissed and the doorbell rang at the same time, startling John out of his thoughts. The visitor was Molly, bringing a piece of equipment from the hospital that John had been expecting. He poured her a cup of tea and they sat, John in his chair, Molly sitting awkwardly at the edge of Sherlock’s.
“Surely, Dr. Watson, you don’t think that Sherlock – well, in this moment you are simply another experiment to him -,”
John’s chest heaved with emotion and he knew he was exhausting heavy, hot breathes on poor Mycroft’s face, but he did not care. John’s finger was deeply embedded in the elder Holmes’ vest, and he realized he had been accentuating pronouns with jabs of it. Mycroft’s face sagged, and he dropped his gaze.
Molly looked up at him with shining eyes. “You won’t,” she replied. John could only nod wordlessly as he pulled on his coat and strode to the office to pick up Sherlock, but he wasn’t there. When John was directed to the speech therapist’s office, he went there with an extra hustle to his step. The receptionist brought John right into the appointment, a comfortable room with maroon armchairs and an oriental rug. The therapist was a young, petite woman with a blonde ponytail and a short skirt. John could tell immediately she was fighting off tears.
First a soft kiss on full lips, then just a kiss on one lip. A tongue stroke, mouth open just a bit. Take it back to a soft kiss again. Mouth wider this time, tongue on tongue. Sherlock grasped John’s hair to keep John from backing back down to the soft kisses again. The doctor pressed his hips to Sherlock’s and was met with equal pressure and a moan.
“I’ve got you. It’s all right. It’s me.” John’s hand stroked Sherlock’s chest, from side to side, up on one shoulder and down again, each new portion touched eliciting a sharp intake of breath from the detective. John’s hand dropped lower, until he could feel the fluttering stomach of his companion under his palm.
“Not one word. Not one bloody word,” John whispered into his cell phone. “The whole move here, I know it must have been painful at times, but damn the man. He just closed his eyes and turned his head and didn’t say anything.” John squeezed the bridge of his nose with two fingers. “Thank you, Molly. Yes, I will call if I need anything. I think we – he – just needs time.”
It was hard. Once the swelling began to recede, the large black sutures that were used to bind together skin graphs were apparent, wide X’s running across Sherlock’s new nose, halfway up his forehead, and partially across each cheek. At first the doctor had to admit the surgery only seemed to produce a jumbled mess of flesh; but as healing began, he was reassured. Sherlock didn’t want to hear it, didn’t want a mirror, didn’t want the progress described. He put himself in the dark – quite literally, as he brushed his hair and teeth in the dark with the mirror covered with a towel. It was no wonder the detective was fearful of the outcome and this was the only way he could express it.
John didn’t need reassurance in his skills as a doctor, he knew his was providing the best possible care that Sherlock could ever receive. But it pleased him to know that maybe he could make Sherlock feel ‘good’. At least he could hope that was what Sherlock meant.
Well, my darlings, this is the end. I know I had mentioned earlier of increasing the chapter count from my original planned 10 to 15, but upon further writing, editing (and rewriting and editing and rewriting and editing) it seemed that brevity was the soul of this story. Sometimes you just can't fight your muse!
John clasped a hand and led Sherlock into his bedroom. He sat the detective on the edge of the bed and stood between his knees. For once, he was taller than Sherlock. But he wanted to see the man and his every emotion, and this was the best way he could do it. Sherlock tilted his head up to John, eyes wide and a bit fearful.
John opened his mouth, uncertain how to answer, when his cell phone buzzed with a text. “I’m sorry, Molly, that’s Dr. Wadsworth. Come on, I know Sherlock will be very pleased to see you.”
John paused. He had everything he needed right here – he could do it. He nodded grimly, chewing his lower lip. It would take some doing without assistance, but he could do it.
“Up now,” John said, sitting on the edge of the bed and pulling Sherlock into a sitting position. The detective seemed to be in a semi-conscious state, his head flopping forward, chin on his chest. “Easy there,” John said, realizing that Sherlock would not sit up under his own power, but rather, the detective slumped against John, his head laying on the doctor’s shoulder, small puffs of sweet breath against John’s neck. For a moment John sat, motionless, unsure of what to do. Then his hand came up and covered the back of Sherlock’s neck, absorbing the feel of the skin, the tendons, the muscles there in that long, angular, infamous neck. John turned his head a bit to the side, so his cheek just barely lay against Sherlock’s. Skin against skin. It was John who then shivered.
Sherlock bent his head over his phone, typing furiously, a deep furrow appearing on his brow. John stood by the bed, waiting patiently, but the detective shook his head and erased it all. He turned and stared at the wall.
Sherlock and John startled and stood up quickly, turning to find Mycroft standing in the doorway of 221B.
“Sherlock, are you concerned with your appearance? The way the scar looks, your ear, your nose? Because if you are, you need to get over it right now. Let’s talk about it. Because you are in the initial stages of healing, and you have a long way to go with reconstructive surgery. I don’t want you worrying about it, right? We have a long road ahead of you, and it’s going to be all right.”
“Oh,” John said, quite taken aback. It was obvious Sherlock had been practicing the words – and the nerve – to say this to the doctor all morning. “Thank you, Sherlock. I – I certainly am trying.”
The light in the room was low, monitors beeping softly, nurses padding around on quiet feet. The room seemed…reverent. And there, lying there on the hospital bed among wires and oxygen lines, was Sherlock. The detective was sitting up for proper drainage due to the sight of the operation, assuring an open and clear airway through his mouth, as his nose was covered with a large tent of white gauze. John gently took up the detective’s hand in his, brow furrowed as he visually inspected the patient. Sherlock was pale, his pink lips outstanding against his pallid skin, lips parted slightly to breath. John ducked in quickly and placed a kiss on the corner of Sherlock’s mouth.
“Let me tell you about brother mine, John. The man has escaped death more times than I care to count. In the time you have known him, you have certainly seen that. That kind of luck can lead a person to think they are a bit…illustrious. Now of course my heart would break if anything happened to him, so I have always done what I could, in the ways that I could, to make sure that he survived any kind of deathly scenario as well. In my small way, I have contributed to his sense of…immortality.”
The detective stood up and gave a nod, color suddenly flushing his cheeks. He pulled his purple dressing gown around his trim figure awkwardly, suddenly avoiding eye contact with his flatmate.
“Want out of these pants? I’ll get your pajamas.” With some maneuvering under the covers, Sherlock worked off the hospital pants and into his own dark blue, silken pants, gritting his teeth against the grinding of his broken ribs. Without a word, John helped his pull off the equally uncomfortable hospital top and slid Sherlock into the matching silken top. Sherlock’s thin chest rose and fell with deep, tired breathes as John buttoned it up. The clothes had a faint scent of that something familiar that was previously missing, and John’s heart quickened when he caught a waif of it.
“Good morning. I’m going to hop into the shower, and then we’ll get going. Only a few sips of water this morning, remember. Nothing to eat.” The detective nodded and turned back to the window. In less than 20 minutes, they were seated in one of Mycroft’s cars on their way to St. Bart’s. At first they both sat quietly, comfortably, gazing through the windows, hands tucked in each of their own laps. But somehow during the short journey, hands had crept across the empty seat between them, so they were joined, fingertips laced, upon the arrival to St. Bart’s.
He closed the door behind her and realized thick clamps encased his chest and he was unable to breath. Sinking to his knees, John closed his eyes and focused on controlling the panic that clasped his entire body like a tight fist.
A few minutes later, John entered Sherlock’s bedroom where the detective lay under the covers in fresh pajamas with a certain gray beanie hat pulled down low over his ears, looking like a child waiting to be tucked in. John smiled, but noted his patient’s eyes were ringed with dark circles.
“Of course, I’ll go make some.” John, his hands now full, walked towards the door. His phone in his back pocket buzzed twice in quick succession.
“How are we feeling this morning?” He asked quietly, placing the plate down beside the bed.  John gently placed the back of his fingers on Sherlock’s cheek, and through the stiff stubble of a several days of unshaven skin, felt the stubborn presence of the fever. Sherlock’s hand rose weakly from the blankets to shoo John away.
“Don’t stop,” John encouraged. “I love your hands…and your fingers. Wrap them around me, yes, God yes, just like that – Sherlock, you are perfect, you are perfect. Just a little faster, mmpph.” The doctor’s hands slid under his companion’s pajama bottoms and grasped his buttocks, gripping and releasing them with the same rhythm that Sherlock was caressing him. Their bodies moved together as a wave on the shore, slow and unceasing, seemingly never ending, locked together.
“Jawn,” the sun through the window struck Sherlock’s eyes at such an angle it gave them a luminescence. John was enchanted, and felt his lips part in a sigh. When the detective gave yet another tug on his hand, John leaned in.
“Another scone – no? That’s all fine. Here’s water and your antibiotics,” he managed. “I’ll clean up and be right back.”
“I’m not going to lie to you, it’s going to need future surgery. Once your hair grows back over it, you won’t see it. The plastic surgeon that Mycroft got for you is quite outstanding.”
"Ey don't care." Sherlock shrugged. “Theese is me now,” Sherlock placed a hand on either side of John’s face, long fingers on his cheeks, pulling him close, forcing him to lock eyes, seeking answers to unasked questions:
John increased the speed and pressure of his grasp, high on the feeling of granting this pleasure, of the movement of Sherlock’s entire body as they moved together, of the air between them heated with their gasps. Sherlock repeated John’s name over and over, a wonderful mantra surrounding them, a joyous trance, until his body twisted and convulsed. Sherlock tilted his head back in ecstasy, allowing John the pleasure of kissing and licking the exposed, elegant throat. He could feel the vibrations of Sherlock saying his name under his tongue and it nearly caused him to come. But it was Sherlock first, his cock now wet in John’s hand. The detective grabbed John close and hard, body quaking.
“Ah, Dr. Watson? Bethany Pierson. Just getting acquainted with Mr. Holmes, here,” she rose to shake his hand, her lower lip trembling.
“You cold?  Here, I’ll finish this up and get you warm again,” John said, reaching for a new top for Sherlock.
“Why should that matter?” John retorted, grabbing a water bottle and taking a long sip. Mycroft did not answer, but instead sat down and crossed his legs, planting his umbrella in the carpet. An audience, apparently, was being demanded.
The side of Sherlock’s head where the hair had been slowly regrowing caught John’s attention. Portions of the new hair were long enough to be brushed back, and as John raked his fingernails down Sherlock’s scalp, he could see that portions of the new hair were a different color. Some of it was white. Sherlock put his hand over John’s, alarm on his face.
“This is more than a trim,” John had muttered when 2- and 3-inch swathes of hair fell to the detective’s shoulders.
John had kissed men before, and he was certain that Sherlock had, too. But to John, this man had the softest lips, the most sensuous tongue, the damn most sexy fingers that John had ever experienced, man or woman. And those fingers were creeping around to the front of John’s jeans and applying pressure to his increasing erection.
He would not relinquish Sherlock back to the hospital. This man, in this bed, was his responsibility to care for. His alone.
“Stay,” Sherlock whispered directly into John’s ear, this one word eliciting shivers from the doctor.
I really am humbled by your comments and the following this story has accumulated. I consider it one of my best works so far, and I was only improved by your comments and encouragement. Love to you all!
“I was wondering when I might come and see him when he’s awake.” Molly blushed and looked down into her teacup.
Sherlock groaned, seeking John from under heavy-lidded eyes where the bruising was becoming quite the deep blues and purples. The bandaging in and around Sherlock’s nose forced the detective to part his lips to breath.
“Delivery for Sherlock Holmes,” the man said from behind the bouquet of at least three dozen colorful roses.
“No, they are not dumb. Here, look at me. Please, Sherlock, please.” John gently took one of Sherlock’s wrists in each of his hands and pulled them away from the detective’s face. Oh, how it pained John down to the deepest pit of his soul to see the red-rimmed, tear-filled eyes of his friend. The misery that they told, the helplessness.
He had always been a light sleeper and being over in Afghanistan had only instilled that in him deeper. Being a doctor in an active war area had trained him to sleep between waves of patients –a type of sleep that allowed him rest but with the ability to be roused and on point almost immediately. This had also served him well in working and living with a consulting detective, of course. So on this particular night, now that Sherlock was healthy and John was not exhausted, he resumed his normal pattern of being a light sleeper.
Mycroft ignored the doctor and walked over to his younger brother. Sherlock did not turn away and the two stood face to face. “I see my doctor did an excellent job,” Mycroft remarked, studying Sherlock’s cheek. “Maybe I should have taken the opportunity to give you a new identity. Nice haircut, too. Well done, John. Though you would think your years of practice as a doctor would have given you a steadier hand."
John tapped his forehead with the device, a bit too hard, but it was punishment for his oversight. After a few minutes, he put device back into the box and went to the refrigerator, contemplating its contents. Nothing in there soft enough.
“Har,” Sherlock said suddenly. At John’s quizzical look, Sherlock rolled his eyes in annoyance and texted:
A few days later, John unlocked the door to 221B and watched as Sherlock took the last few steps to the flat and stagger to his chair. Home, at last. Both men exhaled a deep sigh of relief and smiled at each other when they realized they did so in unison. The detective was weak from the multiple surgeries but Dr. Wadsworth, true to her calling, had once again let them leave the hospital early so Sherlock could complete his recovery at home. Bandages encircled his head, reminiscent of his initial injuries, but they both hoped it was for the last time. The doctors had protested what Sherlock had proposed, but in the end relented – to a degree. They removed the ear and Dr. Herry shaped a small amount of donor cartilage into a semi-circular shape and inserted it under the skin of where the ear used to be, stitching it in place. The result could certainly not pass as an ear, but Dr. Herry instructed that it was a good beginning to one should Sherlock change his mind.
“No, I’m afraid the ear didn’t take. They want to prep you for surgery...to remove it. And try again.”
He had read the paper to Sherlock, an activity that had apparently become part of their new routine. The detective had fallen to sleep after the fifth story, but John staying the room and continued to read, his tone lowered to hushed tones. It was only when he began to yawn himself that he decided to go to bed.
“I think you could use a bit of a wash up,” John continued, his voice low. “You still have a fever, low grade, but persistent. If you can eat a bit of something today, I can up your dose of antibiotics. You’re good and hydrated though, that’s good. Here, head bandages first. Come on, now, the ones around your eye can come off, you won’t be looking like the Phantom of the Opera any more. Yes, very good. Looking very, very good, Sherlock. See? Even a bit of hair coming back over your ear, just like I told you. No, keep your hands down, I don’t want you to go and touch it just yet. Good, I won’t bandage that back up just yet. Alright, arms up, let me take this top off, we will change you into a fresh one. Ribs still bandaged up, we’ll keep it like they are. Pretty bruises there, for sure. Now, elbow is looking good, that can come off and stay off. All right, over on your side, this hip is causing quite a bit of trouble.”
John dropped his head to his chest and chuckled, not even sure how to reply. But he was pleased that there was a bit of Sherlock spirit coming through, and that hadn’t even been home but a few hours. He thanked Mrs. Hudson and promised frequent updates, then tray in his hands, took to the stairs up to 221B.
“Look, you may be sick and injured, but we’ve got to keep you moving. Activity is good for this sort of thing – increases appetite and blood flow – okay, yes, I see you are ready to go!”
The detective slumped, his shoulders and head almost collapsing in on themselves. It was John that embraced him now, pulling Sherlock’s head into his shoulder and caressing those curls, wishing they were out of this damn hospital with its crappy white walls and stiff blue chairs and terrible tea.
“Yes, of course,” John answered, hoping his face did not reveal this blow. Sherlock cannot eat because to chew would hurt his face BLOODY HELL I AM THE WORST DOCTOR EVER.
“Yeah, got a truck full of ‘em! Popular guy, your boyfriend,” the man said, wiping his hands on his thighs.
With a proud flourish, John brought in a tray of tea and scones to Sherlock, newspaper tucked under his arm.
“Yes, a totally successful procedure. That was over two weeks ago...the scars are beginning to fade, and he’s sleeping much better at night.” John felt a slight blush rise into his cheeks at this statement. Since that afternoon in Sherlock’s bedroom, the two of them had been inseparable. Together every night, holding each other close, as if afraid to let go. This latest stay at St. Bart’s had completely disorientated Sherlock. He had been completely miserable without John at his side at every moment. For John, it had been exhausting to be the supportive, understanding presence that he knew the detective needed.
“You’ve got to let me help you. I’m putting your phone – here – right here – next to your bed. You call or text me anytime, for anything.” John righted the blankets and propped up pillows behind him, tucking the long, lean figure back into bed. He retrieved the lamp from the floor and turned to find Sherlock already punching at the phone. John’s phone buzzed.
Mrs. Hudson surprised John by bursting into tears. “Oh, I’m usually not this emotional. But it’s all so sad, you know?”
His bedroom upstairs seemed so far away and lonely these days. Deciding that he should be readily available should his patient require his services, he rolled into the readily available cot to sleep.
They had never spoken of that night together in Sherlock’s bed, but since then, there was an ease and comfort in being with each other that had not been there before. They wanted to be together, near each other, always in the same room. They shared silly, flirting remarks, touched a hand, or rested a head on each other’s shoulders. John still read the paper each night, and with Sherlock’s growing confidence in his speech, they talked more about simple, every day things. And about themselves. John knew now, without question, that Sherlock knew more about him than any other person on this earth – and perhaps, vice versa.
“Tehl may…what to do,” Sherlock stiffened in embarrassment, his face still hidden from John, who could feel the heat of the blush on Sherlock’s cheek against his shoulder. This man on him was now at his most vulnerable, most exposed. John could not tell if it was because Sherlock was less experienced than John had assumed, or Sherlock was seeking the best way to please the doctor. It didn’t matter.
“Checking on you after all the commotion down there! Good to see you two, it is! Been recovering just fine I’ve heard, but we are missing you boys. Got a few tough nuts we can’t crack!” Greg pumped John’s hand and offered him four files. “These are some good ones, I know it won’t take you long.”
“Absolutely,” John nodded. “He really cannot speak much. The skin grafts are a bit tight and still healing, so it’s difficult to move his mouth.”
He was tentative at first, but Sherlock insisted on a more aggressive chop, watching John in the reflection of his phone.
“Sherlock is still quite the immature little boy when it comes to decisions of the heart. He has little experience in the matter,” Mycroft continued.
“Let’s just think about it, yeah? Right now let me just cover up that ear, and a bit across your nose. That’s going to a lot less than what it was. Much better.” While John bandaged those two areas, he had to lean in close to Sherlock, gently laying sterile padding across the affected areas, his fingers tapping white tape into place. The whole time his patient’s eyes were locked on him, studying John. Observing. It wasn’t uncomfortable for the doctor, but he was unable to recall the last time the two of them had been this close with Sherlock coherent. John finished bandaging the ear, and without thought, touched the back of his fingers against Sherlock’s cheek. For a moment Sherlock’s eyes dropped and it seemed that Sherlock turned his head into John’s touch, but then it was gone, and John’s chest compressed like a metal band was squeezing around it.
John closed his eyes and smiled, relishing the feel of his flatmate’s warm, silken pajamas against his cheek.
John felt an angry rush of blood flood his face, but counted ten to one to calm down and sputtered a thank you as they left. Sherlock looked up for a moment as John pulled the equipment into the bedroom, the newspaper a crumpled mess on the floor. His head was sunk deep in his pillow, his thin form barely making a bump in the blanket. It seemed to John that the detective was getting smaller every time John saw him.
“Goood nihht,” the detective whispered. John turned his head to look at Sherlock. The lights from Baker Street backlit his face so John was unable to read his expression, but provided a halo-like effect through his short hair.
The shower water was running for several minutes before John remembered to breath. And move. And start the scones.
With a sigh, Sherlock relinquished his hold on the blanket and rolled over on his left side as John pulled it aside to look at Sherlock’s hip. Here was another area where Sherlock’s body had been resting in a puddle of acid, leaving a large and deep wound in the area of the hip bone and the lean thigh directly below. John pulled the rough hospital pants over Sherlock’s hip – he wore no underwear underneath. The detective started when John’s fingers rested on his skin to pull back the bandages. John glanced up, but Sherlock’s face turned away, hidden in the shadows. The look of this area was worrisome, red and irritated with a lot of drainage. John redressed it, focusing right on the area, telling himself not to look at the rest of the detective’s exposed body. Below the curve of his hip John could just see the cloud of Sherlock’s pubic hair, and quivering abdominal muscles above that, and the smooth buttocks of the detective were facing towards John.
If John (friend) thought for a moment about what John (doctor) had seen and dealt with in that room….a panic attack? A disfiguring injury? John clamped his eyes shut, determined to erase the sight of the half-bald, paler-than usual, wasted man bleakly laying in the bed in the flat. That was not the Sherlock that he knew, but it was the Sherlock right now. John tried to take a deep breath, to ease the clamp that seems to have seized around his chest. He gave himself a quick nod, and marched through the door.
Sherlock’s other arm snaked up under John and encased him tight against the detective’s chest, and when the doctor shifted to free his arms from under Sherlock’s grasp, the detective tightened his hold.
“What’s this for? I didn’t ask for this,” John told the henchmen as they hauled a folding cot up the stairs to the flat.
John slid beneath the covers as gently as he could, but his shaking hands and hammering heart made him feel clumsy. He lay on his back, staring at the ceiling, and licked his lips nervously.
“But…,” John began, but his voice trailed off. “Does it matter to you? I don’t want you making decisions on how I feel. You have to make sure that this is what you want.”
John ended the call but stared at the phone for several minutes, deciding what to do next. His best friend and comrade in arms, the great Sherlock Holmes, was back at home at 221B.
“Yes, you are getting there,” Molly said. “Just keep your chin up, all right? Know that we are all here for you, Sherlock. You – and John – are not alone in this.” She wiped her hands on her lab coat nervously. “Well, okay then. Let me know if you need anything. Anything at all.” Molly raised to her toes and gave Sherlock a kiss on the cheek.
“Come on – EEEEEE,” John turned Sherlock’s head towards him by tucking a finger under Sherlock’s chin.
“It looks really…it’s amazing,” John confessed, shaking his head, but Sherlock shot him a look of doubt. “I’m telling the truth, Sherlock. I would never lie to you. It’s puffy right now, remember. It’s going to need a lot more time.”
Sherlock cleared his throat expectantly and John patted Greg on the shoulder and turned him toward the door. “We’ll take a look at them tomorrow,” John repeated.
“But I believe that right now, our dear Sherlock has realized that death could come knocking on his door just like anyone else. This may make him, uh, make choices that – well.” Mycroft stood up and walked over to the table with the plate of sandwiches and stared at them.
Eyebrows raised, that smile still alighting his face and reflected in his eyes, the detective shook his head, ‘no’. John laughed and wiped away his tears, but then the detective was there, those long, strong fingers doing it, caressing his cheeks, brushing back his hair. John wrapped his arms around Sherlock, pressing their bodies together.
John’s head fell back on the pillow and he bit his lower lip to suppress a moan. He felt blood rush to his cock, and not because it was a normal morning occurrence, but because he was attempting to lock in the feel of the detective’s fingers on his arm and the light, cool feel of the five lines of Sherlock’s skin on his skin was a complete and total aphrodisiac. John lay there some, eyes clenched tight, memorizing that place, that time, until he slid his arm out from under that hand and Sherlock reclaimed it without waking, in fact, the detective took that hand and slid it under his own cheek, lush lips smacking in sleep. John turned on his side away from the detective and clasped his cock in his hand, squeezing and pulling until he came, biting down on his blanket to silent his moans, hoping the creak of the cot was not as loud as he imagined it.
“Take the flowers to the elderly’s house around the corner. They will enjoy them much more than Sherlock,” John said, handing the man a few pounds. The delivery man shrugged and trudged back down the stairs.
John lay gentle fingers on Sherlock’s check to ensure the flush was not indicative of a fever, but the detective’s skin was cool and dry. Sherlock licked his lips sleepily at his touch, drowsy eyes opening slightly.
John kissed Sherlock’s forehead and felt the detective relax. He even placed his hands on John’s hips, hooking his fingers through the belt loops of John’s jeans. Now it was John’s turn to caress Sherlock’s hair, to smooth his cheeks as they kissed, fingers carefully skirting the last remaining bandage over the disfigured ear.
John paused for a moment, listening. He heard a huffing sound, a rustling of covers, a muffled wail from Sherlock’s room. He tiptoed to the closed door. It was only when he heard the crash of something falling to the floor that he intruded on Sherlock’s privacy.
“I’m going to give you a few more days to rest, but then I need you up and around. And eating,” John lectured as put down the glass and checked Sherlock’s IV fluids. It was a mix of fluids and morphine, the pain medication being a scary but necessary need for the on-again, off-again drug user. Sherlock had skin grafts on his face, a painful but needed procedure done immediately after the incident to replace the skin on his face. Mycroft had brought in the best plastic surgeon to do the work, tearing the poor man away from his vacation in the Turks and Caicos Islands. John smiled to himself, picturing the helicopter landing on the beach, soldiers plucking the sunbathing doctor from this chair. No expense was spared for Sherlock’s care so far, and none would be in the future.
Once the detective stretched out long on the bed, John did allow himself to adjust a pillow - just slightly. Sherlock’s one visible eye was a small fire that watched John, deep and dark in the shadows of his face. He was exhausted already, and his sallow cheeks were pocked with bright red splotches of fever.
Yes, the visit went very well, and Sherlock heeded John’s words and behaved. The detective was charming, in fact, with John’s gray cap offsetting the color of his eyes, dutifully listening (or appearing to listen, John knew the look when nothing was entering Sherlock’s hard drive) to the doctor, and even a sweet “tank yu” at the end. It had been a difficult appointment, John knew. Dr. Wadsworth had a firm demeanor, insisting on taking off the bandages over Sherlock’s nose and ear and taking pictures of their condition for the plastic surgeon; listening to his heart, taking his blood pressure, and poking and prodding.
“The ear…,” Dr. Wadsworth shook her head. “It's showing signs of rejection. The blood flow just could never be properly initiated. We haven’t told him yet.”
, these were the appendages that formed thought pyramids in front of pouting lips, these were the tools that held a gun or a knife, the dexterous formations that lifted a teacup, focused a microscope, typed a text, fisted in anger, touched a lover –
Sherlock had only a moment to sigh and nod before there was a knock and Lestrade pushed open the ajar door.
“Perfect,” Dr. Ballard, the young plastic surgeon, stated as he investigated Sherlock’s nose with a bright light. “Swelling will increase again where the stitches were, but skin is pink and healthy, cartilage appears firm, septum straight. Yes, perfect, if I do say so myself.”
“Sure,” John managed. “I’ll be right back.” He managed to get himself out of the chair and upstairs to change. Frantically he dug for some old pajama pants as he usually slept in a t-shirt and boxers, cursing as he rummaged through his drawers, then praising
“Naw, Sherwock,” the detective murmured. John pushed on Sherlock’s shoulders so that he lay back and John fell on the bed beside him, so they lay on their sides, face to face. The doctor placed his hand on Sherlock’s chest, his touch as light as a feather on the taught skin.
Sherlock was quickly gathered by the staff as soon as they stepped through the designated back entrance, so that John did not have a moment to say – well, he was not quite sure what he would have said. He simply stood by the doors, watching the tall, dark-haired figure march down the hallway surrounded by staff, only realizing that he had the Belstaff coat draped over his arm when Sherlock was gone from sight.
“Sherlock, let’s talk about this before you get all upset,” John soothed, standing. But it was too late. Red splotches of anger mottled Sherlock’s chest and neck and he shook his head heatedly. He held his hands up, palms toward John as if pushing him away.
The outskirts of John’s vision became black, all feeling, thought and emotion focused on Sherlock’s hand around his wrist, Sherlock’s scarred cheek against the palm of his hand. John gulped loudly in an effort to displace his heart down to his chest where it belonged.
Sherlock raised a hand to touch the side of his head, his eyes confused. John put down his phone and gently guided Sherlock’s fingers so they would not touch any of the wounds.
“Here, let’s get you sitting up a bit more,” John said, adjusting the pillows behind Sherlock. He handed the detective a scone on a plate and then sat down and opened the paper.
Trembling, he had curled up into a ball and fell back to sleep until his phone buzzed with a text from Dr. Whitcomb hours later. He managed to rouse himself and stumble to the computer where he now sat, reading and then responding to her email.
“I’ll see you both soon. Good luck,” she said, and as she passed John, she gripped his arm for a moment, her eyes locking with his.
“I was told that if certain, um, people saw you here, they would assume Mr. Holmes was here as well. And we would like to be discreet as possible.”
When it was all said and done, John had to admit he had done a decent job. He had sat Sherlock in one of the kitchen chairs set by the fireplace, a towel around his shoulders. Using a wet comb to keep the curls under a bit of control, John took small sections between his fingers and trimmed them using a spare pair of sharp scissors from his med kit. He was clumsy at first, and forced himself to take long, even breaths as if doing surgery for he was fearful his hands would shake. This was an intimate task, coming close into his flatmate’s personal space, even standing between Sherlock’s thighs to reach the top of his head. The detective sat ramrod straight and still, aware of John’s focus. The dark curls had a silken feel on John’s fingers and he sectioned and combed the hair a few times extra to insure their evenness….and to enjoy their texture. The gentle caretaker smoothed Sherlock’s hair back from his forehead, a brief thought of what it would be like to grab it in a fit of passion racing through his head so quickly he had to blink rapidly to keep his concentration.
“All right. I just don’t...want you to be self-conscious, is all,” John paused for a moment, then seeing no reaction, plunged on. “You have several surgeries ahead. It’s going to be fine.”
“I don’t know if I ever told you this story,” John began. “But I solved a bit of a mystery when I was in Afghanistan. We had these amazing peanut butter bars in the mess – sounds trivial for sure, but when you are in a war zone, the smallest things seem to have greater meaning. They were the right amount of crunch and peanut butter and I wish I could find them now – well, anyway, when we got a supply of them, they had to be rationed or there would have been a riot.” John felt Sherlock relax just the slightest under his arm. The trembling slowed to the occasional quake, and Sherlock began to take slow, easy breathes. John sensed he was still listening and dropped his voice lower, hoping it would lull the detective to sleep. He rubbed his chin against the top of Sherlock’s head, and drank in the scent of the man, the feel of his body so close, the warmth and comfort between them.
“Uh, yes, of course. I’m here with you. We have a long road ahead of us, I meant to say.” John’s heart thumped inside his chest so hard at this statement he was sure Sherlock could see his rib cage tremble.
The hair over Sherlock’s damaged ear was beginning to get long enough to cover the ear to some extent. As John had noticed earlier, some of the damaged follicles were producing white hair, which lazed into coarse curls, much different from the silken curls on the rest of Sherlock’s head. John had to admit it gave the detective a sophisticated air – a strangely deformed ear hiding beneath curls with streaks of white.
The detective tossed his phone aside on the bed and shrugged. He busied himself by sweeping the crumbs from his lap onto his plate.
Sherlock turned his head away, drumming his fingers on the arms of his chair. John chided himself for being callous.
The procedure went exceptionally well, they assured him. Lots of bruising and swelling, new skin taking nicely, vitals being monitored, he is just now coming out of anesthesia.  John listened and nodded, the doctor part taking in all the information, the other side of him ever so eager to go in and see Sherlock, to comfort him, to be with him. Just to be with him.
“We go in for surgery tomorrow morning,” John continued. “It will be an overnight stay at the hospital, so when we are not home tomorrow night, don’t worry.”
A familiar restlessness began to grow in Sherlock. Where the detective had once craved mental stimulation with cases, there now seemed to be a physical anxiousness about him. He would tap his hands and feet almost continuously, pace, fidget. John encouraged Sherlock to accompany him on a walk, but instead the detective would push back the furniture in the living room and nimbly dancing on his feet, would punch the air in a boxing training routine until his forehead glistened with sweat. Come evening, John would prepare a homemade meal and they would sit and eat it while watching the evening news. Nights came early and Sherlock would disappear into his room once again, and ten minutes later, John would follow with the paper tucked under his arm. However, the cot had been folded up and placed against the wall and John slept in his own bedroom once again.
“I know I promised, Sherlock, but I can’t -,” John responded, trying to keep the anger out of his voice, as if speaking to a petulant child. Which, of course, he was. “The doctors need to move you to another room and I can’t be there. But as soon as I can, I will be.”
Now John raised his eyes from his laptop to look as Sherlock trudged into the living room and sat down in his seat across from his flat mate. He had taken the bandage off from across his nose, revealing the thickly scabbed and misshapen feature. Between that, the hat pulled down low across his eyes, and the bandage still over his ear, John thought he looked like a bit of an awkward teenager dressed up like a street thug.
He closed the bedroom door quietly and nearly had a heart attack as he turned and faced Mrs. Hudson, who had been standing in the hallway.
“I swear, you two are like an old married couple,” Mrs. Hudson remarked one day when she came up to visit. She was the only one Sherlock would not retreat from besides John, but he still would not utter a word in her presence. Instead, glares and huffs were his form of communication, which he expressed at that remark. “Well, it’s true! I haven’t seen the take away delivery man here for quite some time. John, all those groceries that get delivered are going to good use. I can tell.”
Sherlock’s eye fluttered open and his arm sprung out of the covers, groping for his phone. John pushed it into his hand. He texted:
“Look at me, Sherlock,” John whispered. After a long moment, Sherlock’s eyelids fluttered and his eyes opened, locking eyes with John. The sunlight slanted through the window, finding his eyes again, turning them hazel, then gray, then green, full of wonder and wide as a doe’s. But there was still fear, fear like John had never seen in the man before. The fear of emotional exposure, of dropping down every last shield, of being a true person. One that could love, but that could also be hurt.
Sherlock accepted the pills into the palm of his hand and unceremoniously flicked the pain med across the room with a look of defiance at his doctor. John put his hands up in surrender and retrieved the paper.
“I need a drink,” John responded, collapsing in a chair. It was the third day in the hospital following the surgery to attach one of the laboratory-grown ears. There had originally been five ears ‘grown’ for Sherlock in Petri dishes, but two of them had not succeeded. One had been attached three days ago but was not faring well. Even though an experienced surgeon had been brought in specializing in such procedures, there had been complications.
John moved so swiftly Mycroft startled to see the doctor suddenly standing directly in front of him. Had one asked Mycroft later if they stood eye to eye, he would have said yes, though that was physically impossible due to their difference in heights. But John had in that instance, in that moment, become so much larger than himself, Mycroft was certain the man had grown a good six inches.
“Big day,” John sympathized, pulling up his chair and unfolding the newspaper he had brought in. “Here’s tea – with brandy, lots of brandy - and I brought the paper. Now here’s a good story…”
They had ended up staying three days at the hospital since once again, Sherlock had fallen into the pattern of not eating and getting sick from the strong medication. Although John had insisted that once Sherlock was home he would drastically improve, but the insolent plastic surgeon, Dr. Ballard, did not listen. When Dr. Wadsworth had found out about the situation, she intervened and sent them home, but not before Dr. Ballard had given John tutorials on how to change the bandages and moisturize the sutures.
But money could not heal a damaged and depressed soul, and that was what John suspected Sherlock was succumbing to now. He only hoped that being back home would nurture both body and mind. John puttered around Sherlock’s room for a few minutes, setting out some medication and the bandages he would need for tomorrow. As always, his flatmate’s room was immaculate with everything in its place. John closed the window blinds and checked on Sherlock once more, who’s eyes were now closed, and left the room. It was still early afternoon and John sat at his desk and opened his laptop. He went through his emails, setting aside the ones from fans for now. He tapped his cheek with his fingers, not certain how to address the outpouring of concern and affection for Sherlock. He wanted to make sure his response was heartfelt but tactful and he was not in the proper mind frame for that at the moment. Instead, he read through the emails that may be leads on cases, imagining that when Sherlock felt better John could read them aloud to him. It would be, of course, an ego-boost for the detective to solve cases without even leaving his bed.
Gazing at the undulating red-pink-black of the coals, he finally shrugged and let it go. If anything, he was just over-tired, and over-thinking.
John carried the tea cups into the kitchen. “Should probably head on into bed. Big day tomorrow,” he said over his shoulder. Sherlock stood up and began to play his violin, his back to John, long legs ramrod straight, arms at precise angles as he glided the bow effortlessly over the strings. The melody was one John had never heard before, strong but slow, complex but sweet. Sherlock’s nimble fingers pounced on the strings, directing the movement of the piece in a way that made John realized this was a Sherlock original.
“Now most of this we won’t need, but just in case,” he said. He hesitated on the cot, then finally pushed it against the wall of the bedroom. “Yeah, just in case. Right, you want the tele in here?”
It was five hours later when the young lady that had initially escorted John to the waiting room came to fetch him. Mycroft had excused himself after glumly accepting a sandwich, leaving John to stare out the window, pace, punch, seethe, and sweat all by himself. Two surgeons met John outside Sherlock’s post-operative recovery room.
“Like no one else,” was the reply, John barely saying the words, lost in the smooth motion of Sherlock’s hand down and back, down and back the length of his body.
“Dr. Watson?” An attractive young woman appeared, hand outstretched. “Will you come with me, please? We’ve arranged a waiting room for you.”
“Do you really think so?” John bristled. “You don’t care about cases anymore! You used to be bored, bored, if you had time on your hands. Now you want to sleep all day. You just woke up – it’s 11 am! You don’t want to leave the flat. The kitchen hasn’t seen a microscope in ages, the fridge is clean of body parts! What am I supposed to think?” John quieted his voice from a shout to a whisper, his words slow and measured. “I’m worried, Sherlock. I’m worried. Please. I want to make sure…you are all right.”
“John, have you even been in your kitchen?” Mrs. Hudson asked, clucking in disapproval. “I bet it was Mycroft’s doing – go ahead, take a look!”
“Hmph,” Sherlock replied, lounging in his chair across from John. Both men had their laptops perched on their laps, but John snapped his closed.
“No, no, no,” Sherlock muttered. He stopped suddenly and looked at John, eyes glistening with tears. “Ey fine. Pease.”
Sherlock put his hand on John’s knee and gave a firm squeeze, then quickly abashed, pulled it back as a plume of red flushed his cheeks. The moment was taken away from them as they pulled up to their Baker Street flat to the flash of cameras from the paparazzi. Sherlock had just enough time to duck his head as John shouted to the driver to keep going.
Sherlock had fallen asleep during his sponge bath before John could reapply the bandages to his head, so this was really the first time in a while John was able to look at his entire face. The skin on the right side of the detectives face was still pink and a bit unnatural looking, with thin lines of the edges of the grafts bisecting Sherlock’s cheek. There was a thin stubble on the side of his previously bald head, and the wounded maw of an ear displayed prevalently. The swelling around his eye had disappeared, and the right side of his nose was thick and scabbed.
“Jawn?” A sleepy-eyed Sherlock trudged into the living room, scratching his head, dark blue dressing gown billowing around him.
“Your ear is not going to grow back on its own. And I’m sure you’ve seen your nose. It needs to be fixed.”
However, upon hearing them enter, Sherlock raised his eyes and his face crinkled into a wide, genuine smile. John breathed with relief as Sherlock opened his arms and embraced the girl.
. This was to be his life now, with this man, in this flat. Without knowing it, what he had unconsciously craved had come to fruition. His feet had grown roots to imbed in these wood floors, his heart had grown to embrace that insidious, crazy man, and he was complete. Their kiss had sealed it.
The remainder of the afternoon was pleasant, John reading until he was about hoarse, a pleasant rainfall tapping against the window, and Sherlock massaging his face with the new device from the hospital. It must have been between articles – and with the soft murmur of the rain and the drone of the face massager – that John dozed off. He was awoken from his slumber with a slap of a pillow to the face.
“Boss said to put it in Sherlock’s room,” one of them replied. “Guess he thought it might be too uncomfortable for you’s two sleepin’ together.”
“I wasn’t there when they found you, but I saw the lab. You put up a hell of a fight, Sherlock. The place was destroyed,” the two men shared a wry smile. “He must have just gotten a lucky shot and knocked you out. The thing is…Holloway was an amateur taxidermist. The chemicals found at the scene that nobody could figure out were chemicals he used to - , Sherlock, I can’t.” John clenched and unclenched his hands, suddenly finding it very hard to speak. A mist covered his eyes and he shook his head, staring at the floor. Then he felt the familiar weight of fingers on his forearm.
“I’ll tell you what I know. There was a string of murders of young women. Their bodies had been found quite disfigured…okay, you remember all that. Strange chemicals had been found at each scene, and you were in the lab at St. Bart’s one night, analyzing them. According to phone records, you called Lestrade and sent him to pick up one of the suspects for questioning, based on some result at the lab. We had narrowed it down to four men at the time, all four men at been present at various times at the same pubs where the girls had been before they had been murdered. It turned out this suspect – James Holloway – was also a night janitor at St. Bart’s. He had been stealing chemicals from the hospital for his own uses. Mr. Holloway’s wife called and told him that the police were looking for him. Turns out he was working that night at St. Bart’s and found you in the lab. Now he’s a big boy, this Holloway. Beefy, tall, strong,” John paused and took several long breathes, trying to pull himself together. Recounting this was suddenly very hard. Sherlock’s eyes softened and he came around to sit on the edge of the bed again near John.
“Yes, John, I know as a doctor you understand it better than me. But when I hear him play his violin, its always so sad, and he never leaves the flat. Afraid people will see him? And hear him talk like he does? Will he ever get better?”
“Thank you, both. I know it was not for lack of trying. Let me go talk to him – come on, Molly, come say hello first.” When they entered the room, Sherlock was sitting up on an exam table bed, his legs hanging over the side. The bandage that had formerly been wrapped around his head was gone, and only a smaller patch covering the unsuccessful ear remained. The detective’s eyes were down, forlornly watching his feet swing back and forth. For a moment John’s chest tightened with nervousness as he rethought his decision to bring Molly. It was a difficult thing to deal with Sherlock lately.
Sherlock was a handsome man, there was no doubt. Though there were whispers of doubt concerning his sexuality, it didn’t stop mobs of besotted women from emailing him, sending him their underwear, and showing up at any of his appearances. John knew that the man secretly reveled in the attention – hell, who wouldn’t? – but certainly never acted on any of the offers thrown his way.
John put anything cold in the fridge and then sauntered into the bedroom, only to find Sherlock laying on top of the covers, eyes closed, fingers pressed against his lips in his thought pyramid. John stepped inside the room, saw Sherlock thinking, then immediately turned to leave.
“You’re saying that Sherlock, in his current state of mind, has the potential for making foolish choices,” John said, anger beginning to creep into his voice.
“Just heard about all the ruckus with the press. Next time don’t take a taxi – I’ll provide your transportation. It’s much more discreet. It was the driver that called in the paparazzi. And don’t worry, any pictures they may have snapped have…well, have been deleted.”
“Oh, Sherlock, Jesus Christ, you were never a freak,” John managed to stutter, a wave of anger engulfing him. Anger at those that mocked Sherlock, and anger at Sherlock for caring what they said.
Mycroft paused, and John searched his face for some sort of indication of where this conversation was leading.
For the next few days, life at 221B became an easy rhythm for the two men. After a leisurely breakfast, John caught up on emails and paperwork, while Sherlock reviewed the increasing number of files that Lestrade was sending over. Then there would be a short session of speech therapy with new exercises, with the speech therapist video-conferencing in. Sherlock would then retreat to his room, sometimes playing the violin, sometimes taking a nap, sometimes reading, or a combination of the three.
The young woman sat down and ran a hand over her forehead. “From what I can see, he has pretty limited oral movement. Those muscles in his face have been damaged, and they must be stretched and moved. It will be painful at first, but like anything, it will improve with time, if he does the exercises.”
“Promise. There’s no getting rid of me. Lord knows you have tried,” John smiled and dropped his hands, pleased to see the corner of Sherlock’s lip twinge. “Here, let’s do this one exercise – just one!” The detective rolled his eyes, but John pulled him to the couch and they sat.
Sherlock went to his bedroom and slammed the door shut. John stared at the ceiling and tried to gather his feelings. His patient required a mix of discipline and compassion that was getting difficult to muster. John was tired, emotionally and physically. If he let himself, he would go upstairs to his room and bury his head in his pillow and cry and scream. But being the good soldier, he bit his bottom lip, gathered his energy, and knocked on Sherlock’s door.
, he thought, keeping his eyes on Sherlock mid-thigh and lower. He dried each leg, rebandaged the hip wound, and pulled on fresh silken bottoms. The elastic band of the pant caught on the tape of the dressing and John had to fumble with it a bit, his hands dangerously close to that soft cloud of pubic hair and what lay within.
John’s head fell back on the pillow, then raised again to look at the hand on his arm. Four long, elegant fingers draped over the doctor’s bare, muscular forearm, the thumb resting alongside. John studied them until his neck screamed for mercy. Perfect crescent pale pink nail beds set in fingers – fingers, these were not
“Sherlock, nonono, it’s all right now,” John pleaded as he tried to capture Sherlock’s flailing hands. The detective was gasping for air, but John realized it was not due to a medical issue. Sherlock seemed to be in the midst of a panic attack. “I’ve got you, I’ve got you, you’re all right,” John soothed. Sherlock twisted away, blankets winding, the IV toppling and yanking at the needle in the patient’s arm. Sherlock yelped in pain, and John took the opportunity to pin the man down under him, each hand holding Sherlock’s wrists beside his head, and straddling him across his waist. Sherlock bared his teeth, shaking his head from side to side.
The detective handed the phone back to John and lay back in the pillows, content. There was a sheen of sweat on Sherlock’s face from the recent pain, and a few stray curls clung to his forehead and neck. It was almost time for another haircut. Sherlock raised his hand, smiling shyly, and John grasped it. Sherlock gave John a tug on his hand, and John could only respond by sitting on the bed next to him.
“You were very brave,” John told him after the doctor left. An outsider, John thought for a moment, might have thought he was talking to a child. But Sherlock’s eyes lit up with the praise and he sighed contentedly as John tucked him into bed. Sherlock had fallen to sleep immediately after she had left, and slept through the night, a soft snore indicating to John a deep and needed rest.
“Some things never change,” Sherlock muttered, and John smiled widely at his perfect enunciation. They were home, this time to stay. The healing of body, heart and soul, could finally begin.
“’S’okay,” came the whispered reply from the detective. John brought him the files, and Sherlock slowly paged through them. It fell silent in the flat, the rustling of the pages the only sound. Greg’s wide smile slowly faded and he glanced from one man to the other.
Confused, John put the tray down and walked into the kitchen, noticing for the first time how incredibly clean it was. When he opened a cabinet, it was bursting with food and supplies. The refrigerator was new – gone was the appliance that once housed Sherlock’s science experiments, and this one had fresh fruit and vegetables, juice, cream, jams, meats and cheeses.
It was early in the morning when John had felt Sherlock’s hand upon his arm. Those same long fingers, hesitantly being placed upon his forearm. John had awoken almost instantly at the first feel, but he willed himself to remain completely still. The fingers were strong and warm, first loose around John’s arm, then boldly giving a slight rub back and forth. It was with profound regret, John thought, that Sherlock withdrew his hand after a few minutes, sighed, and turned restlessly in his bed.
“There, much better,” John said, holding back the covers as Sherlock shakily got back into bed, his long fingers grasping at the back of the chair and then the headboard for support. John pressed his lips together, determined not to help Sherlock.
“You are an amazing man, Sherlock Holmes. You have calculated what is unfathomable. Imprisoned the evil. Saved lives. Escaped death more times than I care to count. You are my Sherlock, and I am your John, and we will make it through this, together. I promise.”
