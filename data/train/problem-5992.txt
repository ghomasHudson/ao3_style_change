“Good idea.” Tony returned the smile. “Let’s get back before those Pterodactyls decide to visit Main Street.”
Steve looked down at his hands, practically whispering his next words. “Your work always comes before anyone, Tony. Not just me.”
Tony couldn’t help the smile that grew on his face, and was about to let out exactly how much he’d missed Steve too, until a loud noise caught both their attention somewhere north. It sounded like an engine, a very old, raspy engine that belonged to some kind of jeep.
“Right,” Tony heaved a heavy sigh, clapping his hands together. “Let’s do this.” He said, as he came to stand next to Thor. “Carol, keep the cameras of every soldier up on screen, Thor, get the Foniassaurus’s tracker up and everyone else, be ready for whatever comes next.”
“We’ll have to come up with a better plane than last time,” Clint added, thinking of what happened to his friends hours ago. “Get the team together.” Tony and Steve nodded in agreement.
“You came down here to say hello, after six months of running away and completely avoiding me?” Steve said crossly, Tony’s prediction was just about right. “Don’t give me that bullshit Tony, you’re here because you want something, not to see me. So what is it?”
Wade visibly flinched. Peter chuckled to himself as he pulled out their flight tickets from his pocket, giving Aunt May one last smile. “Well, we’d better go, their announcing our flight.”
Tony groaned, raking his hands through his hair. “Shit!” he bellowed, making everyone in the room jump. “I can’t believe this is fucking happening!” he exhaled.
Once the pair got off behind the rest of the tourists, they carried their bags onto the decking where they walked along the platform and came to a stop halfway, eyes scanning the area to see if they could find Tony who said he’d be meeting them.
The couple stopped by the security line and turned to Aunt May, who started tearing up a little as she looked up at her nephew. Peter sighed, groaning at her sudden emotional breakout.
Everyone’s gaze instantly landed on the large, red dot that was moving extremely slow on the screen.
Peter huffed in annoyance, but couldn’t argue when they were in the middle of being attacked. Besides, Wade was practically dragging him away and towards the nearest table to hide under. Tony and Steve shared a look as they held up their guns, without saying a word they both took their stance, and pointed towards the sky. As the dinosaurs screeched and shrieked around them, Steve and Tony began to shoot, joining in with the Shield employees.
The blonde man got straight to it and began dialling up numbers across the park, Carol jumping in minutes later to help out as best as she could. As that was going on Tony and Steve sat back and watched the map of the island on the big screen, while the rest of the crew continued to search for the murderous dinosaur through infrared. It didn’t take too long as within minutes, once Thor had finished all his calls, an employee practically dove out of his chair and pointed at the screen.
“This animal is strong, pretty powerful,” Luke said, looking out at the dome. “I made sure we used the thickest steel and strongest cement we could to build it, not to mention the toughest glass imaginable, but I’m still not sure it’ll stop her.”
Peter let the poster fall to look stupidly at the other man. “Yes, my grandfather was a great dinosaur hunter. Didn’t I tell you that?”
Peter was just a tad bit tempted to try and pick the lock on the door and jump out, maybe go on a little hunt of his own and try to find some of those long neck dinosaurs he’d seen in the movies. There’d be no doubt in his mind that Wade would happily tag along. He opened one eye to peak over at his boyfriend, who was now rubbing one hand down the glass window as if he were petting a dog. Peter smiled to himself before leaning all the way back and shutting his eyes again.
It took Peter and Wade another ten minutes before they finally got up to their room at the Jurassic Hotel, where Loki signed them in and showed them around using his uninterested, gloomy voice. The room was definitely five star if the massive television screen, free food and large balcony with fancy table and chairs were anything to go by. The bed was big enough for Wade to roll over in it six times, not to mention the shower could probably fit about eight people and the bath was more like a swimming pool.
Thor laughed joyfully. “Why, it is Energy Bolt.” He said in his English accent, holding up a can. “It’s delicious!”
“Woh, woh, woh!” Tony butted in, waving his arms about like he couldn’t believe what Steve was saying. “Are you trying to tell me, that this god damn dinosaur can control her freaking thermal temperature too?” Steve nodded in reply. “Oh hell no.”
The crashing sound of the Foniassaurus was right behind them, its heavy breathing so close they could feel it on the back of their necks. Neither of them wanted to turn, too afraid that if they did the creature would be way too close for comfort.
“Classified.” Tony grinned, earning a roll of the eyes from Steve. “Hey, if it helps, even I don’t know what dinosaurs were used.”
At Steve’s words Tony felt a lump in his throat, his mind drifting to the day Steve had said similar words to him before he’d ended their one year relationship. “I know.” He said soundlessly, hating how defeated he sounded. “I wish I had tried harder, I wish I hadn’t lost you.”
Tony swallowed the lump that had formed in his throat, taking small steps over to his friend who stood as he drew closer. He didn’t want to hear it, he didn’t want to hear what had happened, he didn’t want to hear that he’d lost the man who meant everything to him.
Tony sighed deeply, gripping the steering wheel in his hands tightly. Just when he was feeling anxious and wanted to hide under a rock, his sister just had to go and blab on and on about Steve like talking about him would make Tony feel so much better. It had the opposite effect of course.
Steve grinned, the two going silent as they crept along the soggy ground. Minutes later, Steve suddenly stopped and frowned. “Tony,” he said quietly, raising his riffle. The damp, dark, silent of the forest was unnerving, sending shivers down his spine. “I’m pretty sure this is where we saw them on the map, it’s near where Thor said he saw them too.”
“Bruce,” Steve kneeled in front of the older man, placing a hand on his knee gently for support. “It’s not your fault, none of it. It’s nobody’s fault.”
Loki froze in the middle of the street, and turned around as an ear-splitting squawk reached his ears. His green eyes widened in terror, as metres above him a Pterodactyl came lunging down straight towards him, wings spread wide and mouth agape. Loki quickly turned back around, and made a dash for the centre, not looking back, and gasping for breath. But it was no use. Next thing he knew, Loki felt something sharp wrap around his shoulders and under his arms, and he cried in alarm as he was being lifted off the ground and into the air.
“So, what did Schmidt want this time?” Clint asked, opening the freezer to reveal shelves full of dead mice and rats. “Did Natasha know he was here?”
“Any electrical faults?” Bruce said, doing his own investigation of the cameras on the screen. Everything looking normal, except for the mass of people cramped into Main Street. “At least we’ve got everyone into one place now.”
Suddenly, all the colour in Tony’s face drained. The engineer gazed over at Steve who looked at the scientist with saddened eyes. Bruce didn’t know what had happened minutes ago, he didn’t even know that the Foniassaurus had escaped. He’d made sure that the only people who knew about everything were the ones at the scene, Shield, and the employers locked away in the control room. Tony’s heart sank once more.
“Thor!” Steve started shouting down the phone, as Tony wasted no time and drove the jeep off, the tyres skidding loudly as he turned it around and shot down the trail. “Thor, there’s been a breach, I repeat there’s been a breach!”
“Don’t know why I didn’t just sell this place.” Tony sighed, thinking back to the time his father had told him he’d left the entire park in his will to Tony. It wasn’t easy running two businesses at the same time, even though he had a lot of help from both ends. “Maybe I could sell some dinosaurs to Manhattan Zoo, they’d love a Spinosaurus as a main attraction.”
Bruce nodded. Steve’s concerned tone of voice didn’t go unnoticed by Tony. “What’s so bad about a fish? This dinosaur a good swimmer or something?”
“Not a word,” Thor shrugged. “We lost track of them earlier when trying to sort out the guests. I’ll give him a call.”
Thor’s eyes widened, like a lightbulb had just gone off in his head. “Jesus, Tony, I’m so sorry!” he said quickly, putting a hand on the man’s shoulder. “No, no, Steve, he’s fine! He’s alright! A workers bringing him in as we speak.”
The Foniassaurus growled at the back of its throat, but didn’t drop her. Natasha could feel the blood draining out of her, her energy dwindling as she continuously pierced the dinosaur anywhere she could reach. But the animal was no match for her. Within seconds the Foniassaurus reopened her jaws and clinched them back down, a nauseating crunch echoing through the control room, Natasha’s heavy breathing abruptly coming to a stop. Then everything went silent, as the sounds of the dinosaur’s heavy footfalls faded on screen.
“Yeah,” Tony bit down on his bottom lip, thinking about his nephew and boyfriend wandering around the park. “He’s here, Peter and his boyfriend.”
Luke nodded slowly. Then Steve moved his gaze around the enclosure, eyes landing on each and every camera that was stuck to the wall. One by the gate, one in the corner by the glass windows, and another, hidden amongst the trees looking right into the dinosaur’s woodland. There were no cameras that could point towards where the Foniassaurus had made those marks, and all of a sudden Steve felt a chill run down his spine.
He’d thought at first that maybe he was seeing things, or that it might have been from bark or an injured bird. But as his gaze flicked through the trees above him he didn’t see anything but the leaves swaying in the wind, no birds in sight. Matt started feeling anxious when another drop fell onto his chin, followed by another on his shoulder, like the blood was falling from someone, or something that was wounded.
“Okay, okay!” Peter cut him off, pushing him aside and stomping towards the gap in the fence. “Let’s just go! I’ll do anything at this rate to shut you up!”
Turns out the glass building they’d seen earlier was where their next place of transport would be. They followed Loki onto the railway train, and took a seat halfway down the cabin a few rows in front of the man, Peter getting way too eager for his own good as the train shot off and took them closer to his first ever dinosaur encounter.
The two followed the dinosaur with their eyes as it moved slowly through the fence, its loud stomps echoing, and the ground shaking considerably.
“Pretty damn dangerous.” Luke said with confidence. “I’m not a dinosaur expert but, she ate her own sibling so, I’d say she’s worse than a T-Rex.”
“Okay.” Tony sighed, hands on hips. “Right, good.” He said, striking up an idea as quickly as humanly possible. “I’ve got a plan, and it’s going to involve a lot of help from the employees and a lot of patience from the visitors. Let’s hope there’s no angry customers out there.”
Not only had he lost them but so had Thor, who was holding his head in his hands, knuckles turning white from digging his fingers hard into his skull. Carol had lost her best friend, being Natasha’s maid of honour at her wedding was one of the highlights of her life, the wedding that happened only months ago. And Tony didn’t even want to imagine how Danny would feel when he found out, first Luke and Jessica, and now Matt, Danny’s three friends from childhood all gone in one day.
“You do what you have to do.” Tony piped in, not wanting to waste any time and start an argument. He sneaked a quick glance at Steve, who kept his gaze on the carpet, before continuing. “We just have to keep this thing away from the public, no matter what.”
Wade and Peter were sitting up against a tree in the darkened woodland, far enough from two Ankylosaurs they’d come across not long after they’d stepped between the gate. They were quietly discussing what outfits would look best on them, a suit or a ballerina dress, before they heard a loud, thunderous rumble, the ground shaking underneath them.
“A long neck,” he said, feeling another shake from the earth. “You know, the one’s you said could make a pretty bow with their necks.”
After trailing the footprints through the mud for what felt like hours, Tony and Steve had come to a dead end, which was in fact the end of a cliff that dropped down into a rather enormous, deep pool where a loud waterfall poured down into it. Peter and Wade’s footsteps had stopped there, just a jumble of them imprinted in the ground as if they’d been dancing around on the spot. What made it worse, was the giant footprint of the Foniassaurus right beside them.
Steve shook his head with a laugh, leaning further into the older man as they walked inside. Tony quietly shut the door behind them, and said with confidence, “Let’s go kill this son of a bitch.”
Everyone in the room followed his gaze and there were gasps, eyes widening in terror, as the Foniassaurus moved around on the spot. But that’s not what caught their attention, as right next to the Foniassaurus were two other dots in the shape of people, evidently struggling for their lives.
In his own thoughts as he drove Tony didn’t even hear his phone ringing, until the call was diverted to the car’s radio, courtesy of his own design. Tony looked down for a second to see who it was and groaned as he saw his sister’s name pop up. He supposed he’d have to get it over and done with.
“Oh,” Wade giggled excitedly. “Your uncle’s ex who finished with him because your uncle was a bad boyfriend?”
Most of them nodded, many of them sighing in relief that they were finally going to be able to put their feet up for five.
It kept ringing and ringing, the high pitched drone making Tony want to fling the device at the wall the longer it went on. He growled loudly before hanging up, jabbing his fingers on the screen to try again.
Peter really did roll his eyes this time. “When it bites down on the tree again, we make a run for it, okay?”
“There’s no way the trackers off,” Natasha piped in. “Those things are brand new, they’ve not once been wrong.”
Tony saw the look of shock and alarm on Clint’s face before he whirled around as another pained cry came from Steve, and his heart skipped in dread as he eyed the scene before him. Steve was on the ground on his back, rifle thrown metres away, as a pterodactyl stood above him and pecked at him like he were the animal’s dinner. Steve had his arms up, trying to protect himself from the onslaught, thrashing and kicking out in an attempt to get the creature to move away.
“No wonder they’re extinct,” Wade would say. “He can’t even see two human shaped blobs following him.”
With one quick swipe the Foniassaurus had Matt in its jaws, wrenching him off the ground and swinging him in its grasp. The group yelled and bellowed in terror, scrambling backwards and away from it, falling over one another to get to the other edge of the stream. Suddenly Matt screamed at the top of his lungs, the pain overbearing as the dinosaur bit down hard, bones cracking deafeningly.
If they were in any other situation Peter would have rolled his eyes, but instead he used his free hand to grab onto his boyfriends, squeezing it tight as they rocked back and forth. Peter shut his eyes as the ringing on his phone went on, before there was a click and suddenly Tony’s voice was shouting at him on the other end.
It was obvious what the item was when Matt scooped it out of the ground, and held it up for everyone to see. Natasha cursed out loud, the soldiers looking defeated and just a tiny bit terrified at the prospect of now not knowing where this creature could be.
Steve wanted to yell at her some more, make her see reason, tell her that Luke wouldn’t have wanted this. But he knew deep down that Jessica wouldn’t go down without a fight, and she wouldn’t let her husband go down alone. So he took one last look at his friend, and made a run through the side gate.
, to come check out her enclosure and see if you think it’ll hold and if anything needs adding or changed.”
“Guys, code red, we have a breakout!” He could hear the abrupt racket of commotion on the other end of the line. “The Foniassaurus has escaped, get her up on the screen and find out where the hell she is, now!”
“What?” Peter squeaked, as Tony led Steve towards the information centre. “No way! That’s not fair, I want to help!”
Wade stepped out of the room he was in and skipped into the one Peter stood in, and as soon as he entered he grinned from ear to ear at what he saw.
“Tony?” Steve said, as they were about to ascend the steps. “You made that way too easy. Are you sure it’s a good idea to let Peter and Wade stay?”
But there was no sign whatsoever of the creature. Matt held up his hand once more, this time signalling for the team to come to a halt, as they did. The leader of Shield tentatively kept on going, not once letting his finger fall from the trigger, eyes on the trees up ahead. He knew the Foniassaurus was clever, what she’d done to his friends not long ago was no behaviour of any dinosaur he’d seen before, and he had a funny feeling she wasn’t about to be found quite so easily.
Steve didn’t want to hear anymore. It seemed like Jessica was in the same boat as she shared a look with him before sauntering off to use the touch screen, Steve going the opposite direction. The researcher drowned out the sounds of the two bickering like a pair of teenagers by gazing through the glass, taking in every detail of the enclosure that he could.
Carol was the first to react, wasting no time in pulling the switch that completely shut down the link to Shields cameras. The screens went black, only the one television to the left showing the park’s map, thousands of red dots scrambling across it. Nobody said a word, too shocked and confused at what had just happened, Tony could practically feel the discomfort in the air and he felt sick, sick to his stomach. He’d just lost two more of his close friends.
Peter gulped, feeling goosebumps decorate his entire body as more trees cracked, the earth moved and whatever it was was getting nearer and nearer, as if it knew they were there. “Um Wade… You’re not the only one,” he whispered back. “I think now’s a good time to get the hell out of here.”
“Not until we’ve got a solid plan for the Foniassaurus, Thor.” Clint said in all seriousness, as he sat on the edge of the desk. “We can’t have people going inside until we know where she is, and how we’re going to take her down.”
Tony noticed the single tear that slipped from the blonde’s left eye, but Steve soon covered it up by rubbing his free arm across his face, visibly trying to stop himself from letting his emotions get the best of him. He was hurting on the inside, he wanted to scream and shout until his throat hurt but he knew he couldn’t, he knew they couldn’t waste any more time. His other hand still held onto Tony’s like it were a lifeline.
“Jess!” Steve bellowed at the screaming woman, trying desperately to get her to look at him. “We have to run, now!”
“Well, I need the walks, honey bear.” Wade said, planting a sloppy kiss on Peter’s cheek. “Hey,” he began, nudging Peter on the arm. “Why didn’t your rich as fuck uncle come pick us up?”
However, just to prove her wrong, he kept a record of when he spent time with Pepper and Rhodey, and how he was doing emotionally and even at work, in the attempt to prove that social interaction didn't affect Tony as any other human being - only, it did.
Still, Loki did. He had a good, slow, and calm life now. He lived true of his real nature, not continuing with the story Odin forced on him. But it was still a very fragile system, while Loki's feelings for Bucky simply weren't.
And Hydra must have used his weakened state after the ordeal to influence his mind, so it wasn't over just because Barnes shook off their control once, as Loki thought it was.
"Can't we just concentrate? Strange must be in pain and we need to get off the creep torturing him..." Loki decided to ignore everything else, and the fastest way to disappear was doing that.
Yes, they started sleeping with each other half a year now, perhaps, and even managed to shut up Bucky about it, who kept teasing them both, but Coulson always only allowed himself to be moderately happy about it, not taking anything for granted because...
"It's faint but it's definitely there," Strange announced after what felt like years, and Steve released a breath he didn't even know he was holding. "Now, step back. I'll try my best."
"Then why, why on Nine Realms bring it up?" Loki couldn't help but smile, even though Steve was, once again, acting mischievously, toying with the God of Mischief himself.
During this time, Tony had to undergo surgery, getting a pacemaker, and was examined again, and he realized his mark has changed based on the very discrete reports he got about it.
"Um, like you've never snuck out on your window or something?" Quill told her, but when he could tell she didn't, and he looked around, and all of their faces were blank, he supposed there was some advantage of not growing up as a rich kid, after all. "I'll teach you. All of you. And your sex lives can thank me later."
In other words: it could not be simulated. Therefore, it was a worthy enough challenge to keep his mind on when he didn't want to think about what he lost.
"The jury's still out on that one, and you broke Steve's heart, so you leave now. Or, I'll be only too happy to arrest you..."
Steve could have been looking for a way out subconsciously, because only then did he notice that the door stood slightly ajar, setting them free. But just as he considered whether or not he should mention it, Bucky let go of Tony anyway.
But now that Loki knew where Thor went, he had to leave soon, otherwise, there was a small chance Loki would get him back from the Hulk, and would never let him go.
"You take this, exchange it for Vision, come back, and you'll live happily ever after," he told her.
"You better," Quill could only say, before they were kissing once again, probably trying the poor driver's patience by taking so long now.
When he opened his eyes, he was in a bed with Strange. Naked, and tangled up in each other's arms. Going on by the looks of the mortal, much older too.
“I’ll tell you why,” Steve told him in a soft voice. “I was bonded to a Beta named Bucky, and he was kidnapped by a German Alpha, and he died. I’ve spent the last 50 years in a medically induced coma, in a cryo-chamber, because I couldn’t take the loss, and the doctors thought it could save me. They woke me when my hormone levels resembled an unbonded Alpha's again, but sometimes I still wish they didn’t.”
"You might have realized you're in a better mood because of my magic when I'm around. And you mistook it for what humans call attraction when it's just a kind of automatic reaction," Loki said. "Not to mention, due to the constant transfer of energy between us, now we have a shorter, faster way of connection, and could very well be that you can feel my addiction to the process resonating back to you, even if you aren't magical."
And that seemed to calm Rocket somewhat, but when Ronan left, giving him the finger, he snapped at Quill.
"So you don't even try to deny our chemistry," Tony only heard what he wanted to hear. "Are you shy? Maybe even-"
"Well, I do now," Steve frowned, and Bucky tried to move him from the door and just leave, but he wouldn't stand down. "How many times did you lie to me? How can I trust you? Maybe you secretly ogled me in the showers as well."
Waking up in Bruce Banner's body, without magic, was almost as painful as when Loki realized he and Banner in Loki's body were locked up, but the Grandmaster and the witch were standing in front of their cage.
"If it's any consolation, a century is nothing, Steve. Goes by in a blink of an eye." That at least earned him a small smile.
If you were born with something that wasn't exactly nice, it wasn't just a description, but also a limitation. An excuse if you wanted to show people how horrible you could be.
His magic needed to be replenished, his wounds healed, and paradoxically while he felt light and agile, he also was very lazily sleepy, and couldn't keep his eyes open.
if you have an old lady friend who is over a hundred but still single, just tell them I'm allergic to cats."
Put it on, and Snapped the army away, while bringing back all the Vanished. Then probably passed out for a bit, because the next thing he knew, he was in a hospital bed, with Banner irritatedly talking to him.
"I get it," Tony offered. Rhodey talking to him was already better than he expected. "But you were there for me when I needed someone for 20 years. So at least let me help you financially if nothing else."
"Oh, not like that, Captain!" Thor only gave him a huge grin. "I meant on the mission I assume I'll still have. Protecting this world and such. I could be the muscle, and you could be my consciousness warning me if I'm doing something wrong."
And he was finally free of the Aesir the first time when he fell. He could have just started a new life, yet when Thanos talked to him, he barely needed to push a few of his buttons, and Loki himself asked how he could be of help to the Mad Titan to destroy order because he was fuming again. It didn't even take much.
"But? I'm too perfect for you too, just as I am for the people on the internet?" Steve asks. "Because I can be a jerk, if that would give me a chance with you, so..."
"All I'm saying is, if he wanted us dead, he could have swept the floor with us when we attacked his clone by mistake first."
"Which means our best chance is to try play by her rules, get out, and only try to kill each other after she had this protocol deactivated," Bucky tried to point out.
"Let me rephrase. I didn't think I could or would have a shot at that kind of connection after I became Sorcerer Supreme. But now I'm retired and you annoy me the least of all the people I've ever met."
It was funny because that was the truth. Anything else would have been a lie, and Loki didn't expect anything else but one, given everything else that was going on.
Asking for Steve's help so nicely that Steve had no way to refuse (grabbing Steve on his way to the gym saying "this is all your fault, now help me fix it before Pep lectures me for disappearing for too long", giving Steve a brush but no clue as to what he was talking about before it was too late to back out).
Then, Loki was on a spaceship, when Strange appeared. He threw a knife at him without thinking, but it passed through.
"That's not what you're supposed to say, Daddy!" however, now the tiny Jade appeared, not just a spectator anymore. And Strange used this to get them out of the loop.
Only, sometimes he got so comfortable that he kept forgetting the nefarious plan, and that was alarming, to say at least. Making him think he should leave as soon as possible.
"My name is Phil Coulson. I'm going to help Fury out from today, while possibly earning some extra college credits. If there's anything you need, you can tell me."
Didn’t dare to think it would last, but then 3 years later when Scott showed up out of the blue, they still were going strong. And now that Tony solved the little time-travel hiccup Bruce previously had, it must have brought back memories too, because Tony was unusually quiet, but then when they were about to sleep, he asked.
"So, what is the problem?" but the soldier didn't sense Tony's sudden discomfort, only taking a couple of steps closer still, until he was standing there shoulder-to-shoulder with Tony, looking at the projections.
Maybe Tony hated him for omitting something so huge, and how Steve was just an Omega, but he didn't seem to be able to shake the pull Steve had on him, so Steve used that.
"No, I won't," Steve chose this moment to wake up, and even though it was apparent he could barely speak, he took Loki's hand. "Stay. At least until I can be sure I'm not just hallucinating you on the drugs they're pumping into me. I've spent years trying to find you. I never should have let you go, Loki. If it takes me to be half-dead to see you, and you leave, I swear to god I'll just get into more trouble the next time."
"So here's the deal. Let's do it. I'm in. All the way. Not holding back, not apologizing for it either. If you still want it, I mean. Even knowing that Capsicle and I tend to have some fuckups like we just did."
Maybe because Loki wasn't the average person with average problems, but neither was Bruce, and yet? Somehow it still worked. Maybe even better than Loki would have expected.
He couldn't even stand still, walking circles, despite being aware of how ridiculous he must have looked. Whenever he felt like this, he'd have his hands in the pocket, walk ever so leisurely, put an unamused face - if not attitude - on, gesticulate widely, and make rude remarks.
Spoiler alert ---> this chapter is Bucky's, next will be Tony's turn (where we also finally get to see why linguistics will be Tony's downfall, I'm so looking forward to that, hahah), and you can figure out who's the last.
"No, I mean it, you should ask her," Steve this once didn't let Tony talk himself out of the topic at hand. "And believe the numbers if you don't believe me. Or Bucky. Do you have any idea how difficult it can be for him now?"
But the captain has an interesting follow-up question just when Phil puts some money on the table, basically ready to bolt.
"I already had changed the color scheme to a more minimalist approach, so if you leave it for the night, JARVIS could take care of it for you."
By that time, people were wearing filters in their noses. There was not only a limitless range of safe contraceptives for Omegas, but the same was available for Betas and (perhaps most shocking) but also for Alphas.
"If they train excessively, as it has been known to happen, Friday is supposed to lock them in, so nobody else gets hurt, and the damage is contained to their vicinity, not the whole Tower," Bucky explained, looking at Tony, who swiftly ignored them both, conjoined with the device in his hands.
"Give it a week. It'll pass," Strange assured him, but they also arrived at their destination, and the food was much better than on Asgard, so Loki didn't get his point just yet.
"Why aren't you dressed? Where is your tux? We're already running late because of Mantis," she only said.
By Pepper who sent people home first, and when Tony wanted to object, by Rhodey, who slapped Tony when he was about to object.
"It flies," Tony finally revealed. "I figured you could be a better help to the army piloting a flying suit than with SuperLegs."
"For the first time?" Loki wondered grinning, but then Steve made good on his promise, making him not only come but laugh once he heard what the catchphrase was.
If it was anybody else teasing him like this, or making jokes on Loki's expanse, he wouldn't have appreciated it. But Tony was different because Tony could be teasing the hell out of him one second, just to be there for him the next, so... Loki kinda loved it.
It could be only Tony who didn't notice his feelings before because he was so preoccupied with the false fact that feelings, emotions, and sentimentality weren't for Stark men.
Finally, Steve all but had to do a whole mural to fix it, but it wasn't so bad. It had been way too long since he drew anything, and even if in this case it had to be something to reflect Tony's style, it was more of a fun challenge than an annoying restriction.
"I'm not as you think, at least," Steve got on the top of him and wasn't letting him go. "I'm only attracted to people who are important to me and not the different packages they come in."
"Then answer me this. Does the good Captain know that you're in love with him, and always had been? What do you think he'll say when I'll-"
Odin putting him in a cell that Loki couldn't escape, even when healthy. And giving away so much of his blood to Barnes sort of wrecked his magic too - Loki hoped it wasn't permanent, but still. It wouldn't be enough to escape anyway.
"My name is Steve. And no, but I have a bike, and I trust you can figure out the rest once you're better."
"Also, you should call them something cooler. If you were serious about the no grandma jokes, then..."
And while Ebony's inadequacy came hardly as a surprise, Loki's worry whether the doctor lived or not was.
"Apparently, Tony Stark can," Strange told him before turning to Tony. "You must forgive us. Disciplines are taught right from the start that they can't teleport without a special ring, and you just proved that principle wrong."
He wanted Tony to do this, otherwise, he wouldn't have asked for it. And the first couple of times, Steve felt both safe and satisfied too.
"But?" the captain now has a different smile on like he suspects something bad is coming, and Phil wishes he could just avoid looking at him altogether.
“Noted,” Steve looked at him as if he was about to take Tony to bed right then and there again after hearing that.
"So what? I can't sleep with you until I give myself up to the Midgardian authorities, and by then, too bad, because they'll keep me locked up and far far away from you anyway?" Loki just asked instead.
"Alternatively, I could direct you towards a form of communication that could be the fastest resolution of your problems, boss."
It was only a day later when Tony had a file which his father buried a long time ago, and the nerve to face Rhodey with it, who opened his door after the knocking but was about to shut it on Tony's face when he saw it was Tony.
“So, nobody was here except for the two guards who couldn’t see inside the cage?” Steve said, starting to put things together.
Bruce hummed in agreement. “Steve’s right, we can’t pick her out on the infrared, she’s camouflaged and has a tendency to kill, we have to figure out a plan and fast!”
“There’s no blood, so that’s a good sign, right?”  Tony’s voice grew higher and higher with each word. “No blood, that’s good.”
The last thing he’d heard over his phone was Steve shouting, Steve’s obvious panic, before the sound of a dinosaur’s ear-splitting roar echoed through the line. He could still hear it now, as if mocking him. Tony had no idea what had happened, if the three had gotten out of there in time, if Steve was alright or even alive. His pace hastened as his thoughts swirled around in his mind, hoping to God that the nauseating pictures in his mind weren’t about to come true.
“My god…” Bruce whimpered, as his two friends lowered him onto the seat. “My god… my god…” he stuttered. “What have we done… it’s my fault… oh god…”
“You guys alright?” Logan came rushing back over, the other workers in tow. “That was a bloody close one!”
Steve nodded, sticking his phone back into his pocket. He led them a little further through the tall, old trees, across some small, trickling rivers, and fallen logs, all the while Tony watched his ex as he moved with purpose, that determined look in his eyes. Tony couldn’t help but smile.
Peter grinned, moseying over to help him dig out his shoe. “At least there’s no dinosaur on our trail.”
Loki growled, huffing and puffing as he sat upright and glared at wherever the noise was coming from. “Are you kidding me?” he grumbled, noticing the noise was blasting from the sirens. He scoffed at the things, knowing they’d only go off if something bad had happened. “Let me guess, Thor escaped from his cage.” He snickered at his own joke.
Tony ran after the blonde who was way ahead of him, and who suddenly got down on his knees in the grass. Tony could see why. Laying right next to Steve on the ground was a gigantic, long necked dinosaur, its chest stirring sluggishly up and down with each short breath it took. As the engineer got closer he could see why the creature was lying on its side instead of on its feet, along its ribs a bit chunk of its skin and muscle had been torn out, the gruesome wound bleeding nonstop.
Tony, the son of the founder of Jurassic World turned to his friend, who also happened to be the park’s head scientist.
They weren’t exactly sure what to expect on the other side of the door, and what they got was pretty anticlimactic. It was just a long, dirty, dark hall with one door to the left and one to the right, with an emergency exit door at the end. Wade groaned, as if disappointed that he didn’t find a room full of skittles and marshmallows.
“We could tell them there’s been an electric fault with the rides.” Bruce suggested, shrugging his shoulders and looking away shyly as everyone stared at him. “Just a thought.”
The engineer would have loved to spend the rest of his day there but knew that behind the closed doors he had a lot to deal with. Emails from his business, Stark Industries, were constantly flowing in, and the CEO wouldn’t stop calling him about the new phone that they were about to release. Tony was halfway through a call discussing the phone’s glitches when a large, bulky man came stammering through the room’s main doors.
And Steve. Tony sucked in a breath, he didn’t want to turn around and have to face him. Too afraid that Steve would hate him even more, hate him for letting this happen, for not listening to him and stopping the Shield team from leaving the building. It was all his fault, all of this, he should have never agreed to have this dinosaur created.
“Shit.” Tony said under his breath. “How dangerous is this thing?” he said, he hadn’t realised just how insane this idea had been, only now learning some facts about the creature. Maybe he should have paid more attention to Bruce when he’d gone over the plan.
“JUST GO!” She shrieked, hand moving into her back pocket to retrieve a hand gun. “If I go down, I go down with him!”
Tony sighed, running a hand through his sticky hair, noting that his own hands were trembling irrepressibly. “It was Steve, I should never have…”
“Yeah,” Carol snorted, huffing once more. “Don’t know why Natasha didn’t fire that asshole years ago.”
“TONY!” Peter just about screamed down the receiver. “HELP! WE NEED HELP! WE DON’T KNOW WHAT TO DO! TONY WHAT DO WE DO? THERE’S A FUCKING DINOSAUR-,”
Steve nodded, letting Clint yank him off the ground. “Now you know why there was a position open on the Raptor team.”
His voice came out so brash he’d put a halt to the pairs yelling match, their attention brought to him instead. Jessica even looked up, computer forgotten as she followed Steve’s line of sight.
“Won’t be long until the boats arrive.” Thor said, drumming his fingers impatiently on the desk. The more he thought about what was happening out in the woods, the more time was wasting. “Oh, for the Gods sake, maybe I should phone security? Make a sweep around the island?”
“Of course!” Thor scoffed, like he was appalled by the idea. “Why would I forget such a thing? What I’m trying to say Anthony, is that the electric fences aren’t at full capacity.”
“Follow me,” Loki ushered, pushing past a few straying visitors. “We’ll be going to your rooms first.”
“What about them?” Tony asked as he watched Thor put up the fences system on his screen. “You had them on right?” he said worriedly.
“It’s got to be them.” Steve said, and before Tony could say another word, the dinosaur expert was already taking off at a sprint through the woods.
Tony slumped in his chair and looked at his watch. “Shit,” he mumbled. “Look Pep, I’ll have to call you back.” He said down the phone and shoved it in his pocket.
One o’clock came around and the couple found themselves being led to the Innovation Centre, the enormous, brown building sitting at the end of the main street. Peter’s eyes lit up when they pushed open the wooden doors. Inside there were walking holograms of different dinosaurs, touch screen guides and games, interactive videos and even a ride that took you past the labs and showed 3D videos on how the dinosaurs were made. It was like being four again and getting his first ever science book.
Luke nodded. “The other day one of the builder’s was standing there sealing the glass, she came out of nowhere and head butted it. I think if she’d hit it twice there’d be no glass left.”
to be working at the Dino café, but apparently I’m now a babysitter and tour guide thanks to my brother’s idiotic suggestion that I am apparently good with the visitors and know my way around, which is a load of utter poppycock. I despise people.”
“Good to see you, Captain!” Clint called over from his own position, where instead of bullets, he used a bow and arrow to bring down the prehistoric birds.
“Hmm,” Wade held out two jackets, one red and one green. “I don’t know, Shnookums. Which one matches my eyes best?” he said, holding them both to his face.
“Let’s get you straight to a medic, huh?” Tony said to the trainer, as he eyed his cuts up troublingly.
If there was anything to say about Steven Grant Rogers, it was that he was the bravest man on Jurassic island. Not only did he become the parks very own dinosaur researcher and behaviour specialist, he also became the trainer and caretaker of four very real, and very dangerous velociraptors.
“Yeah, yeah.” Tony rolled his eyes. “Most kids get left with a sum of money when their asshole fathers hit the bucket, and what do I get? A tech company and a bunch of dinosaurs.”
But as he reached out for the handle of the door he suddenly came to an abrupt stop. The engineer turned to the other two with an expression of pure dread, obviously coming to a realisation. He’d been so wrapped up in everything that was happening that his mind was only stuck on the one thing, other things forgotten. He felt his chest tighten and his voice crack as he spoke to Steve.
Wade had threatened under his breath to grab the baby and toss it into the overhead locker, which resulted in a painful jab to his ribs from Peter. Well, if there was one good thing about flying it was the constant entertainment he got from sitting next to his boyfriend.
"Careful with what you're calling crappy," Tony gave him a warning. "But I think I'm finally over it. After all, when I've completely gone off the rails, and you both held me I don't think I've ever felt so... recognized before? Safe, although I wasn't wearing a suit? I don't want to say warm, it sounds like something only a clingy perv would say, but-"
"I'm sorry, I didn't mean it like that," Steve at least realized his mistake, making Tony shut up, but still furiously shaking his head.
And at first, when Barnes' eyes popped open again, he only grabbed Loki's wrist tighter, instinct taking over, but that didn't last.
"I'm not talking about Nat," Barnes, however, only snorted. "But rather, someone whom you haven't considered before because you're homophobic-"
"No! You're just fucking with me, nobody on this planet could design something like that, not in this century!"
Steve was disorientated and could not see, sure, but still could use his Alpha voice on him. Commanding Tony to fall asleep. And then, darkness took him.
"I'm sorry, Buck," Steve never felt like this before, not even when he got the crap beat out of him, before or after the serum. That was so simple, he knew what was wrong and right. But now? "I just..."
"And if there's a fight to be fought, the Aesir swore to help the Midgardians in exchange for the land we were given, so take this," he gave Thor the Bifrost Sword. "I don't have a use for it, but I have a feeling that you will."
"Why? What do you think I'm talking about?" Tony asked with a mischievous smile, so Loki was careful not to fall into that trap.
"Aaand I didn't even give him SuperSpeak," Tony only muttered to himself, ignoring how the horde of reporters were all simultaneously trying to ask Tony and Rhodey questions.
"I'm guessing the only question is... is it true?" Strange asked him. "Could there be a version of a future where you and I actually get along?"
"That wasn't me flirting," Nat quickly said before he could tell her. "Just me telling you that in a world where there isn't a chance the find the perfect match anymore, you're quite a catch."
"I do! But I won't fall for your bullshit. If you ask me, you're just like the Grandmaster, except the fact that he seems to be fond of the Hulk at least. So if I have to choose between the two of you, I'll take him."
And that's when it hit Loki. Steve Rogers was often put down as the boring type, and Loki himself thought that was it, but clearly, it couldn't be further from the truth.
“I wouldn’t have a problem with you moving in here either,” Steve accidentally said, even though he knew Tony wasn’t ready for something like that when up to that point, he wasn’t even comfortable staying in Steve’s after they were finished.
"Tell us then," Bucky turned off the heat under the pans that were ready. "It won't matter if she figured out, if we know anyway, right?"
He was about to reach for the girl who was indeed standing on the very ledge almost too carelessly, probably just to protect her. But Loki - knowing full well who she was - couldn't help but step between them, almost snarling.
And while logically Steve could accept maybe that wasn't a reason, emotionally, he felt like he became someone else after the Serum (even if not Red Skull territory), maybe also too complacent with all the power he had that was enough for a while but nothing against Thanos and... he also felt like he betrayed some of his core beliefs when he divided the team for Bucky, even if he wouldn't let any of his friends be killed on any given day.
"You had an altercation last week that caused a rift, negatively affecting the whole team, and the issue at hand concerns all three of you. That's why I gathered you."
“STEVE!” Tony yelled, and the Alpha burst into the room, despite how he was told he wasn’t allowed. “We’re leaving.”
kids. Nothing less or more,” Steve said. “And we wouldn’t know either, not until they would present.”
Loki couldn't decide whether the Captain was toying with him, and mortals really kept these strange things as companions, or this was just a trick for Loki to humiliate himself, but he had an idea.
“Omegas deserve to be loved, Tony. There’s no such thing as spoiling them. Whoever gave you the idea that you were undeserving of attention?”
JARVIS kept filling up bowls automatically with cat food whenever Loki entered the kitchen. Natasha asked him to train with her, but that was just an excuse to use Loki as a punching bag, and whenever Loki wanted to try a Midgardian dessert, Clint showed up and snatched it away from him saying that sweets were for only the good guys.
Only, Thanos sent an even bigger army next, and Steve got hurt. It was in the news. And despite Loki's best judgment (who only got back to the states when he heard because he hoped to find himself a spaceship he could use to leave Midgard after the fight), he couldn't stand the thought of not checking on him.
"I'm sorry, I should let you go sleep," Tony typed, not happy he'd have to leave any work unfinished, but other humans preferred more sleep than he had the luxury to afford.
"Undo it," he commanded Strange. "I don't care how, but this cannot happen to me, you understand? If you think for a minute that taking your magic away was bad, you don't want to what can happen if test my patience any further."
"Uh-huh," Fury laughs at him then, and Coulson doesn't know what's so funny, but he smiles back. "I take it you're a huge basketball fan, Coulson?"
"So, you're dating Pepper now?" Rhodey asked out of the blue just when Tony thought he was comfortable with the silence between them.
So, now Stark stood between all magical threats and Earth in Stephen's body, with no knowledge of even the basic spells, while Strange who had the knowledge, was trapped in a body that didn't have the power to execute it.
, I kinda got myself a 'boyfriend'. It was silly looking back, more about having a friend, and we were too young too, but the thing is... I couldn't have known that was the only day when Jarvis wasn't picking me up, my parents making an appearance, so I kissed the other boy, just a peck on his lips when saying goodbye. I've never seen my father so angry in my entire life," Tony looked up for the first time since he started talking about it, and Steve reached out to comfort him. "It's not like he hit me or anything, but he did ship me off to a boarding school only two days later, so that they'd make a 'real man' out of me. Otherwise, I shouldn't even bother coming back, he said. Even then, I had the distinct feeling it was only thanks to Mom I wasn't disowned on the spot."
"If you believed in the marks, by the same premise you could be just as well happy too, so it's no sacrifice," Rhodey told him. "And if not, you're just pushing her away just because she got too close."
But it's hard to do that when the certain person whom you were talking to had experienced many rejections when younger, and now you were tied to their emotional landscape because you were secretly making them feel better, and you could directly sense the sharp pain your words just caused.
"Ahh, he must have sensed your discomfort, Captain. Normally, Loki is like a monk. I don't think he'd ever kissed a girl, really, much less do more, so whatever the comment entailed, he must have been just all talk."
"And here I thought the torment of one simple pathetic mortal was a sorry excuse for the God of Mischief to even pay any mind to."
"I might as well be delusional," Stark commented. "Or did I miss a memo on bringing your kid to work day?"
"But of course," Loki could have rolled his eyes. If only the topic was just directed for a workshop visit, and he could sleep at night.
"I was thinking of getting an iPhone," Bucky confessed. "Maybe also one of those laptops everyone seems to have now."
"I mean, not that I was looking for any. But seen some players post about everything and anything, and that's not a good idea either, believe me..."
“And I couldn't care less about the regulation if your thinking isn’t clear. I won’t-“ Steve now looked at him, alarmed. “I’d be the happiest Alpha to assist you in all your Heats before you think otherwise. But I want you to tell me that before it hits.”
“You gotta give me some more details, or my mind will wander to all to the possible very extreme and spicy options I’m almost certain you never even considered...”
"If you realize I'm more likely to keep you around longer if you amuse me, amuse me," Loki wasn't about to deny any of his wrongdoings or occasional malevolent intent either.
Tony only glanced at Bucky, who was munching on one of the protein bars Steve managed to find, telling him.
"Alright, so what do you want to know? That I care for Stevie more than anybody else? Even myself?" Bucky questioned.
"You know me so well," Loki mused, not even entirely kidding. "But if this child is as powerful as you suggest, I might just want to raise them. Use them to fit my own selfish purposes and evil agenda you've just outlined."
"Well, then, how about this," Bruce just walked up to him and hit Loki. Unfortunately, he didn't quite know how to throw a punch, and his hand seemed to be hurting more than Loki's face that got the most of the blow.
“Then I don’t want to make you unnecessarily uncomfortable, Steve, so just don’t fret about it too much, ‘kay?” Tony kissed him, and Steve was both pleased to have Tony just looking at him the way he was at the moment, and still felt somewhat disappointed that Tony didn’t even seem to want to try it the other way around, not even once.
"I'll pretend you didn't just say that," Bruce could hardly speak, he was so upset. "I can't...I'm not interested, Thor, so..."
"You mean you can't tell? Anyway, I have this evil plan," Loki started. "I want to use the science of Midgard and my magic fused together to go after Thanos, and somehow bring back everyone, and..."
"I literary just got back," Steve got the sudden urge to defend Tony's honor by challenging the not so kind title, even if it Tony who labeled himself with it. "And I thought you'll do it, though, given that I was gone for
"Bullshit, princess," Rocket didn't seem to care though. "Not only we've been watching you two dance around each other for years now, but then I've just heard the big idiot tell you everything a couple of days ago, finally, and you'd just let him leave?"
"The Sanctum needs to be repaired, or we're all dead already," Wong also appeared. "But if the Time-Stone is used incorrectly-"
“Ah, that. I like what we have now, Steve. Actually, that’s an understatement. I LOVE it, you make me mad with want, in a way nobody has before...”
"I'm not that horrible. So you either tell me what's wrong, or I'll just accidentally leave Thor behind for the next tour, giving you two plenty of time to sort it out."
"That sounded like an insult," Loki tried not to give away how he could be into that. Maybe. They barely knew each other, after all, and he wasn't just about to offer again when he already did in the fever-dream-like future.
Steve would have expected Tony to colorfully send them to hell twice and back, but maybe Tony was too far gone, or Bucky had a way to communicate with him because he didn't. Not only that, but he didn't fight their closeness either, taking deep breaths.
By the time he managed to articulate it well enough though, the rest of the Avengers had bagged the criminals.
Most of his bruises were gone, but his broken bones still needed days to heal, and the wound he got when he shielded the Captain must have gotten infected because the pain was almost blinding, and he was weak, disorientated, and running a temperature. Not to mention, his magic was still stretched, struggling to tend to all the wounds.
"Why, you don't want to try it at least once? Fuck yourself?" Stark, however, seemed to be adamant it was the best idea he ever had. "Because given our arrangement, if you let me do it, you can do the same to me later. So, how about tomorrow then, if you're busy today?"
“My spare phone, what else,” Rocket said from the door. “And I have all sorts of subscriptions but also music, so you’re welcome.”
“You mean you didn’t know?” Steve couldn’t quite believe it either. He was so convinced, all along...
"Fine," Loki echoed in a similar fashion. "I just hope that your healer skills are better than your magical abilities were."
"I'm sorry to disappoint, Cap, but no matter how highly people think of me, I'm still not a wizard to turn back time," Tony, of course, would say that even if he had Friday stashed away somewhere, so there was no way of telling.
"Besides, what good would it do now? Just use your head, Quill," Rocket told him. "Ronan won't forgive me either way, and that was true a month ago all the same as it is now, no matter where I sit."
"I'm on some weird alien planet and just been told that not only I missed years of my life, but I also lost my body in the process, while I got locked up for something you did," Bruce told him. "So whatever you say or do, there's no way I'll help you. You'd only double-cross me. At least this way you'll be forced to change us back."
But that effort paled in comparison to what Tony had been doing. SI was one of the major coordinating forces when all the world could have just collapsed into complete disorder.
Steve was quite old-fashioned when it came to sex, preferring to do it in the bed a hundred times over than the unforgiving surface of any table where anyone might just walk in on them, and Thor knew this as well, but there was no need for them to announce that, was it?
It all took a turn though when Steve tried to cultivate that connection and tried to talk to Barnes about going home with them, the Winter Soldier snapped again and tried to kill both Steve and Loki, not holding back, disappearing again.
“No, you don’t get it,” Tony jumped out of bed, to his feet. “Look! I’m good as if nothing happened! The doctor told me I’m missing an Alpha or I’ve been rejected by one, but I thought it was Obi.”
"I don't see what difference does it make," Barnes noted, and Tony could have kissed the guy just for this right then and there, despite just promising it will never happen again. "He apologized. And must have meant that part too."
But also, he can't cheat Rogers out of the analytics of the digital profile he has either, so it's uncomfortable, to say the least. Especially when Rogers says he's starving after practice and invites him to the closest local diner for dinner, and Coulson is about to say tell him no way, but then the captain's stomach also rumbles so loudly that Phil takes pity on him.
"Oh no you won't," Strange stood between him and the door. "The powers that child carries are essential to the Sanctums. I won't let you just simply walk away with it."
"For the record, I'm not his friend," Gamora appeared out of nowhere. "But I couldn't help but overhear, and all the other tables are full, so mind if I sit?"
"Loki, if you think your tricks will get you out of this one, you're mistaken," Thor tried to make him stand, but that was when the contractions hit.
And after that, neither of them appeared. Only on the battlefield fighting Thanos did Thor see the Hulk again, and after they've lost that fight, Banner all but disappeared, and Thor was busy helping to rebuild Asgard now on Earth - finding that physical labor had kept him mind off things. Like how responsible Thor felt thinking that with Mjolnir, he could have defeated Thanos, but without a weapon, he was almost just a joke compared to the Mad Titan.
And Tony felt ashamed with them knowing who he really was, even if the mark was only proof of what they must have already sensed when they were with Tony.
"No it doesn't, and even if you jumped, you'd survived the fall, and I sure as hell won't hurt you," Rocket said. He had enough of losing people, he wasn't capable of accepting it - even if he never really got along with big, red, so stupidly heroic robot.
"He'll kill us both in a matter of days," Wong told Strange when he braced himself for the worst, but Stark did it.
"I'm telling you right now," the last thing they needed was an argument about the semantics. "So I'm curious then... if you still have some time left and we both want this..."
"That's why I started deleting my memories a while ago. I have another joke for you," Vision smiled. "Knock, knock."
So he couldn't let himself blow up, but then he had a nightmare, and woke up in the snow, on a mountaintop where he'd never been in his entire life. Only ever too lucky that he fell asleep with the nano-housing on, so he could fly himself back from... the fucking Himalayas.
Funny, because with Barnes, even when Loki tried to make himself look bad on purpose, he only got understanding, and only got Bucky angry when he saved his life despite Bucky telling him no.
"Don't. I'd rather you just left it in the lost and found if you don't want it," Rocket told him. "I can't afford Ronan thinking I talked to you let alone did you a favor."
If a little bit of "Tony Stark has entered the room, so you better pay attention" drama was necessary for Bucky to have a friend other than Steve, and hopefully with time also become more trusting with the others, then be it.
"If you mean it, put your money where your mouth is. Because quite frankly, at this moment, I can't even picture you and me together."
"Shouldn't have used that spell, Strange," Wong only murmured then. "But if you're staying for dinner
“I know. But finally, for the first time in my life that I have a real choice to make. And I’m not gonna waste it on going back.”
"You know what would help defeat Thanos? If you could finally master the spell that lets you see into the alternate futures, Stark."
And she was right. She had her mark burnt off when she was just a baby, never having a chance to try to find her "other half".
“Who the fuck uses walkman anyway?” was all he heard from a laughing Ronan before he got a blow on the head and promptly passed out.
"As I'm sure you figured that out already," Phil notes because sometimes it's hard for any of the Avenger members to ignore all the girls who'd like to get to know them better, even though Fury is managing the issue at hand well given the circumstances. "But I have two suggestions. If you don't mind."
“That I knew but I didn’t care because I was an asshole. Which I can be but not to this level, Steve...”
"You're saying you'd like to talk? Well go on," Rocket gestured at Quill. "Communicate with our new friend. Show me how it's done, then."
"So, you couldn't live without me?" he pulled Rocket's leg a little bit, only too elevated that he could.
Three years later Steve and Tony returned to the States and not even the best lawyers could save Obidiah Stane from lifelong prison. Making Steve (as Tony’s bonded mate) the official heir of Howard Stark, owner of Stark Industries.
That said, Frigga did let him out of his prison, and Thor snuck him out of Asgard, but Loki couldn't return to Midgard without the Bifrost, and Heimdall was loyal to Odin only. And he also wasn't sure Barnes would want to do anything with him anymore.
"If you want a different proposition, you better do it yourself. I'm all ears," Strange told him in return.
"We're closer than ever before," and then let Tony interpret it however he wanted to. "But Bucky's gay and I'm..."
It wouldn't have worked if Loki didn't know that the Captain meant every word and if... it didn't remind Loki of how being a Jotun in Asgard felt like.
"I'm fine. Really," Tony insisted, but he wasn't. So Steve stepped behind him and joined the hug with a little bit of putting pressure on the other Avenger, which was supposed to help with panic.
"I'm sorry, but I kinda lost track, which one of you is she talking about?" Tony looked at the other two, making Steve frown.
For someone to turn to dark magic, and become proficient, not just the pain of a catastrophic event was needed, or one prolonged period of despair. It was only constant and powerful pain that almost broke you that would push you to the next level.
"Deal." This was one of the reasons he couldn't stay mad at Tony for long. And if Tony could forgive him, Steve could also put up with some of his antics, right? "What are you going to do?"
"I'm not!" Loki was upset how Tony didn't seem to get it. "Haven't you just heard anything I've just told you?"
"Believe it or not, it was an accident. I was too preoccupied with trying to juggle rescuing you, eliminating the guy who kept torturing you, two stupid mortals, and your daughter who you let follow you to an enemy spaceship."
In a way, they’ve been lucky, because only 3 days were left of Steve’s Heat, and Tony miraculously exercised some unbelievably firm control, because they got through it all without Tony marking him.
"You haven't told him? Am I your dirty mistress now, Cap?" Tony gave him a look, making Bucky stare at them both.
The door was still undeniably locked, and Tony - on the verge of hyperventilating from a panic attack - was sure if he didn't get out just then, he'd lose his mind. That is, if he hadn't already.
Then Thanos attacked a couple of years later (Loki excepted that too, even earlier), and while Loki and Thor did their best to try to tell everyone on Midgard to be ready for such an attack, there was no way they could have been.
"I want to sit here," Rocket wasn't calm either. "And I'd be damned if I let Ronan dictate anything in my life again!"
He was furious because he felt like Odin had made a fool of him when Loki had always thought himself so smart. And Odin could only do this because, despite everything, Loki saw a father in him, and cared for him, even still no matter what happened - that wasn't a reason to be ashamed.
Better than nothing. Maybe he was selfish for the first time in his life, but he didn't want to lose his friend.
"If you aren't dating, you should have more free time to join us. Sometimes only Bucky, if I'm called away on SHIELD business," and Steve was heading for the door, but was stopped before he could reach it.
"Quite frequently, except you don't stop to ask that," Tony admitted, which only earned him another kiss, to then he had to reach out for Rhodey next because he didn't want it to end.
"Of course, in my spare time, I'm not always just a coach. I help set up weapons capable of mass murder, but only because I believe there are aliens who might get us one day, and I want to protect Earth," Fury tells him, but Coulson isn't exactly listening.
So Tony grew up resenting the man, but he was still baffled when at age 28, he got a heart attack, and the doctors told him he needed less stress, a regular sleeping and exercising schedule, and a much better diet.
Finally, he fastened his necklace on his hand and worked on Tony for about 30 minutes. Then Steve took Tony to Dr. Cho who also spent three and a half hours operating on him, but the tissue damage and the burns were just the tip of the iceberg.
"Well, my fault. As it always is, isn't it? No matter if I care too much or too little for something, whether we're talking about the fate of Earth or a relationship, I'm always wrong, and you'll be always the first to point it out, won't you?" Tony wasn't as laid-back as he first seemed to be either. "And as much as I appreciate that, maybe I would be more tempted to run the numbers if you came here asking that I should run four. One also including you and me."
"Coffee when you wake up?" Stephen offered and got an amused smile, and for a day or two, he thought that was it.
Never mind the fact that Thor didn't have an explanation why he was sleeping next to Hulk without clothes, but at least that's not where Hulk's mind went.
But if some tricks didn't work on him, Loki would just have to be more creative, figuring what would.
"You must. You have all the power of the greatest magician of the entire planet at your disposal to do it. Or is it that you can't do what us, a couple of wizards can?" Stephen tried a different approach that would have worked on him, only hoping it would have the same effect on Stark as well.
"Imagine what he could do if he'd seen a couple of things we can do," Strange seemed to be in a good mood for the first time since Tony had met him, talking to the other wizard. "Maybe that's why the spell worked out this way."
"I put a tracker on your phone for your safety, and when I got an alert that you left the Tower without telling me, I thought you were taken against your will. I dropped everything, rushing here, only to find... I heard you. Didn't sound like talking."
"Alright, but I'm getting you a bed then too, and I'm going to monitor you. If you aren't healing while donating the blood, I'll shut it down. Tony wouldn't want for you to die as well."
"It means the world that you say that," Tony gently reached out for him with his left hand - he couldn't use the right, and might never again. "And I wish we could do just that. But..."
It was almost surreal, the exact opposite of their last time together. There was no rush, urgency, or hormones making them do it, and Steve was lucid this time.
"So that we can reopen old wounds, and cry in each other's arms," Tony took another bite from the horrid thing just to stop himself from talking.
Even forever as a mortal was significantly different, after all, and if he was frank, he liked his mind too much to surrender it to the Hulk from time to time.
Giving him a pat on the back could turn awkward in a blink while training, and not knowing how to treat him. Everyone must have noticed because even Thor was giving questioning looks to Bucky, who tried to just ignore it.
"Don't," Rocket told him, and when Quill wondered if he should take offense, he added. "You're smart, but never had a chance to study in a proper school before. I'm thinking Yondu couldn't get you into one before either. So don't mess that up. That said..."
Tony would have agreed to everything at that moment, but it was torture to think they'd have to stop, even if for the sake of relocation.
Maybe it was how close Bucky stood to him when he was curious that made him less alert, maybe it was the competition he had in his mind with Howard now, trying to impress Bucky more than his father could, but he didn't.
But then, the Grandmaster took Loki to the Arena, and he almost died before the Hulk came out, and then...
“Yes, absolutely,” Steve couldn’t help but kiss him. The Tower was Obi’s and while he didn’t want to move in with Tony even after that monster was gone, Tony said he wanted to do it. For him, it was like rewriting the past with the new memories of the same place - although, Steve insisted on remodeling it before moving in. He himself couldn’t stomach the memories of the place. “Is there anything I can do?”
"I... I have issues, but also the tendency to make inappropriate jokes. Do you honestly think I could have kept my mouth shut about any of this if I had known?" Tony tried to appeal to Rhodey stating that he wasn't as bad as Rhodey thought he was by saying he was fucked up, but in a different way.
"Have you met us?" Rhodey asked with no dignity. "Even back when you had a working heart, and I had my legs, we were always just..."
"The imminent one is him," Loki finished the sentence for him. But he was also getting desperate. He began to have doubts that he'd ever manage this. And he didn't especially like his body, but his magic was always there, and losing it would mean that 1, he would be helpless like he was now, and 2, he'd lose a part of himself like a missing limb.
"Please don't, you still have completely human arms as well," Tony said, half kidding, half worried.
Which, in turn, made Steve lift him to the desk, and not only step between the mechanic's legs, flushing their bodies close together, but also let his hands roam, exploring, making Tony groan into their mouth, but then pull away only a little bit later.
"So, you'll take care of it?" he asked Strange, who held the blue baby with the help of his moving cape now.
And, Hulk was going somewhere, and he had much longer legs than Thor. So trying to stay perched on Hulk's shoulders was just a strategy, not that Thor agreed to stay with him.
“In that case, we should both rest as much as we can today, turning in as early as we can,” Tony kissed him, and that's what they did.
"Is it a modern cosplay costume or something?" Rhodey wondered when he first saw. "And what's with the gold and red?"
Tony was so weak physically he couldn’t have argued with Steve at this state anyway. But it was so much easier if he didn’t have to.
Except, they all sort of knew Thanos was getting stronger with every Stone he took, and his army would be quite a challenge even on its own, as it had been on countless times in the past, on countless planets already.
"And am I supposed to call a crane to get this into my room as decoration or what?" Rhodey either didn't get it quite just yet or was teasing him, or both.
"It's okay, the cat's out of the bag anyway," Bucky softly kissed him, and Steve couldn't help but instantly think how just a second ago it was Tony he was kissing. "We could use the time to regroup if you're still in."
Then he had a double shift at the hospital, and when he got back, only stepping into a relaxing shower for two minutes, Tony was there in his room, ignoring the fact that he was only wearing a towel.
"No, I hate jerks, it's... just don't. It's more like-" Coulson is trying real hard to express something pretty simple, in reality, but he can't say that, and rephrasing goes so slow that Rogers has plenty of time to interrupt him.
His magic was, arguably, given that it was just a couple of days, the best progress Loki has ever witnessed, although he didn't know that many magicians.
And the more he was annoyed by Tony's antics when he would have done the same thing in the same situation, the more compassion he felt for the Ancient One when she had to deal with him and his questions.
But it would also mean that he'd risk the magic controlling him if he didn't succeed in controlling the magic. It was a dangerous step in the evolution of any magical, and even when you did it once, pulling such energy and using your body to channel it was forever risky.
"Because that worked out so well for your family," Strange said, and Loki banished the projection out of spite then, without thinking.
sorry, Steve. But maybe it’s just as well. I can help you with the Heat - if you let me. But I also have a plan if you don’t want to. You’ll take the medicine, and I rent a car, and-“
"Ask Wanda then. She's also a dark witch, and crazy powerful, maybe you can work out a deal with her."
"This can't wait, unfortunately," Tony sighed. "I owe you my life, Steve, as I hear it, multiple times over. And you should know that I'll never stop loving you."
"I'm sorry, I'd rather drink the green bio decaf formula that Pepper had brought 3 years ago, but nobody drank ever since, than let my own AI hold me hostage. Especially with you, Cap."
Barnes didn't stab him again, but the punch Loki got wasn't pleasant, even though if it only made him laugh because Bucky's anger only meant he was on the right track to figuring Barnes out.
He was reacting to Tony’s scent. Even though he was fully aware that nothing would happen, he felt like he melting into Tony’s arms. A very bad idea for an Omega with his size on any day, but especially when he was holding Tony up, so he had to quickly pull back.
"One - you better," Bruce told him in return. "And second, I'm kind of prone to change plenty for the both of us."
"Oh no," Strange was white as a sheet. "Jade, that can happen. But sometimes what you see doesn't always come true, remember the ice-cream truck?"
He helped out some elderly people who had lost their only relatives with small chores, worked at a hospital part-time, and took over the group Sam used to lead.
"Funny, because I think we should have done this a long time ago," Steve said, and Bucky turned them around with force and was about to leave the whole Avengers business, the Tower, and the country behind, but then something unexpected happened.
"He won't because I'll just turn him back to a baby. Make him forget the bad things. He'll grow up again, and then be my friend," Jade told them.
Quill would have just left it - Ronan had no proof, and Quill wasn't stealing anyway - but that's when Ronan grabbed him by force.
"Yes, yes, you're right," then it was awkward, and Thor could only pray Bruce wouldn't notice his faint blush. "It's just... I kind of got close to the other guy."
To his credit, Bucky didn't complain or push, but he didn't leave either. Which was annoying. Ever so much when the people of Loki's village started to get to know him, and everyone loved Barnes, even though he could probably drain and kill them all in a matter of minutes.
For the Time-Heist, Vision went back to the past with Rocket to collect the Soul Stone from Vormir, only to be told one of them had to die to get it.
The Sorcerer Supreme, with the magic of the Time Stone, couldn't be surprised. Even when the Ancient One couldn't foresee her death, she must have had a very good guess what would happen.
The eighteen metre sea dwelling monster was held in a gigantic tank where it hid away in the murky water. As the two sat down alongside Loki (who by this point wanted to cry of boredom) on one of the hundreds of rows of seat in front of the tank, they had no idea what to expect. When a huge great white shark was flown above them on a crate and stopped above the still water, it had the whole audience gasping and clapping in astonishment. Wade had almost weed himself as the Mosasaurus leapt out of the water with a loud wail and snatched the shark in its jaws, landing back into its tank with a thunderous splash that had the entire audience drenched from head to toes.
“There’s no other dinosaurs to count.” Wade said looking around as if some would magically appear. “Maybe I should start counting people.”
Loki instinctively pulled his knees up, wrapping his arms around his legs and tried to get as close to the bin as possible, as if that would camouflage him from the creatures in the sky. He watched in pure terror as one Pterodactyl after the other dived down into the crowd of people, jumping on top of women and children, lunging at people and biting into them, gripping them in their humongous claws and flinging them into the air.
The two stared at one another, smiling a little. In the moment Tony just wanted to take Steve in his arms and not let go, he needed it, and Steve probably did to. It had been so long since he’d been this close to the younger man, he started to think that maybe Steve might forgive him after all.
“Shut up Wade!” Peter barked, his hand shaking as he virtually stabbed the buttons on the device. If he was being honest with himself, he really didn’t know what Tony could do at that moment, but looking around he didn’t really have any other choice than to try something.
Steve chuckled, as the men nodded their heads in agreement. “I’m sure you guys could handle a few whistles and hand gestures, it’s not like I’m giving them a pat on the head, Logan.”
“Sorry, I thought you knew!” Thor apologised sincerely. “I thought you’d gotten the message from the builders over there already! They must have been too busy with… uh… shit you don’t…”
Really sorry for the long updates guys! I am trying to finish this fic, but I've got so much on and so many fics on the go it's getting hard to find the time to write it! Thanks for being patient and I know I'm not a great writer haha so thanks for your lovely comments you've been posting! <3
They didn’t waste another second. The two clutched onto their riffles and made their way outside, both feeling anxious and afraid for what they were about to do. They hoped and prayed they’d be alone out there.
The couple felt the sting of the cold water as they hit it with a loud splash, their bodies dropping deep into the river. Peter felt his eyes tingle as he opened them, seeing Wade waving his arms wildly beside him as he began to swim upwards. Peter quickly grabbed him by his ankle, yanking him down to his level. Wade’s eyes widened as he began gesturing this way and that with his hands, Peter clutching his shirt and pointing to the surface, trying to tell him that they had to wait. Wade peered up and saw why. The Foniassaurus was still there, peeking over the cliff into the water, as if waiting for them to come back up so that it could snatch them.
“Do not enter, staff only.” Wade read as he strolled up to his boyfriend. “Sounds like an invitation, let’s go inside.”
“Peter?” Tony shouted down the phone in annoyance, before the line went completely dead and all he could hear was a high pitched buzz. Tony stared down at his phone for what felt like hours before looking up and sharing a concerned look with Steve.
She didn’t take no notice of their shouts on the line, the soldiers scrambling noisily for cover, shots still firing uncontrollably. Natasha held up her own gun once again, pointing it straight at the creature that was coming her way, jaws open, eyes wide in hunger, and she pulled the trigger.
The group turned to the latest person in the room. Tony’s eyes widening in revelation at the sight of Steve standing by the doors, looking exhausted and covered in dirt and grime.
Tony ignored him, mind already boggled. “So, so that doesn’t explain how we couldn’t find her, Steve.”
As he said it, there came the sound of an engine again, which sounded like it was just around the corner. Steve and Tony shared a look of awareness, before the pair practically dashed around the building to where they had an incline of where the noise was coming from. As they rounded the corner to where the garage of the block stood, they could see that the metal door was fully open, but the jeep that should have been sitting inside was gone.
But before Steve could turn around and warn the other two, he heard something. It was a noise he did not want to be hearing this close up. The deep, growling grew into a loud grumble as Steve spun around slowly with his phone still at his ear, Tony’s panicking voice calling out his name.
Steve caught him by the arm before he could get in, holding him in place. “Tony, think about this first, please!” Steve practically begged. “You can’t just go out there and look for them, you need weapons, a plan, she’s dangerous!”
Luke nodded. “I don’t know much about dinosaurs, Stark. I need someone who knows this things behaviour, who will know just what it’ll take to keep her inside, maybe how to keep her calm or enjoy her enclosure enough to not want to get out.”
“Probably not,” Steve answered, letting Clint handle the job of putting the raptors grub into the buckets before he counted stock. “He was talking about using the raptors in a field test again.”
“Their footprints stopped not long back,” Steve said, checking his phone signal again, which was still not working. “Maybe we should have brought the radio to get a hold of Thor.”
Natasha ran for her life, the voices of her friends blaring hysterically in her ear. She heard one of her agents let out a stomach-turning cry, then another, then another, each one of her teammates being taken down around her. Natasha fled through the tall trees, trying desperately to stomp out the fear that was taking over, her hands shaking, and heart beating way too fast.
They were so close, Steve could practically count their steps to freedom. But what happened next had Jessica halt abruptly, Steve having that sickly feeling in his stomach. The two turned as they heard Luke scream at the top of his voice, the first thing they see is the Foniassaurus’s teeth clamming around Luke’s body, lifting him into the air.
Peter sighed heavily, sitting back in his seat and looking up at the sky through the glass roof. If he was being honest, and he wasn’t going to tell Wade, it wasn’t exactly what he’d pictured either. Before they’d hopped into the jeep the young employer, who spoke like he was high on helium, had blabbed on enthusiastically about the gigantic dinosaurs they’d be able to see on the ride. So far, there’d been zilch dinosaurs.
“You know,” he said, as they crossed another river. “This reminds me of the time we went to central park.”
“Whatever you say, baby boy.” Wade sing-songed as he began dodging people, and hiding behind whatever he could to get a good spot next to Loki without him realising.
Tony sighed. “Look, work’s been so busy lately May, I couldn’t take the time off, but tomorrow I’ll-,”
Everyone watched as the Pterodactyls flew above them, and thankfully turning the other way. They couldn’t believe how many there were, there must have been over a hundred, from fully grown ones to babies the size of a small child. But the group could sigh in relief, as the last Pterodactyl made their way through the sky, in the opposite direction to the jeep.
Tony sighed, running a hand through his hair. He shared a look with Bruce who gave him a nod, obviously agreeing with everything Steve had just said.
Steve held his hands higher, giving the raptors each a quick look in their eyes before he addressed Bobby. “We’re going to run in three, okay?”
“Then get them off this island.” Steve’s gaze turned to him again, voice becoming agitated. “Send out an alarm to get them out, before the thing reaches them.”
But instead of getting it from Thor, it came in the form of Carol. She came rushing into the control room, looking more panicked than any of the workers had seen her before. Everyone went silent, because they knew within an instant that something was wrong, and Carol didn’t waste another second before she was yelling at the employees.
.” Tony said over the com, trying to break the tension. It only made everyone roll their eyes as per usual.
Steve hummed, eyes going back to the screen. He felt his heart quicken as he saw the dinosaur’s tracking dot close in on the Shield agents, meaning they were almost there, almost gaining on the Foniassaurus. “They’re walking into a trap, Tony.” He practically whispered. “I meant what I said, they’re not going to kill her, she’s too smart.”
Tony ran a hand through his hair and chewed on his bottom lip, deciding that the best way to do it was to just let it all slip out. “The dinosaur’s escaped, the one you and Hank created, it killed Jessica and Luke and Shield went after it, the whole team was killed, including Natasha and Matt. We’re currently trying to track it down and come up with a solution to get everyone off the island safely.” He heaved a sigh.
Tony hurriedly followed, trying his best to keep up. They could hear the engine more and more the further they ran in a straight path, it’s sputtering and droning echoing around them. It didn’t take long for the two to reach a building they both hadn’t seen in such a long time, the old information centre that had been the first on the island, its front door slightly ajar.
Tony scrubbed a hand down his face as he looked up at one of the employees, making him step back at the look of anger on Tony’s face.
His suspicions were right as he came to a stop beside the trees, only the view of more trees, leaves and a muddy ground to be seen. No trace of the Foniassaurus.
“We need to bring down the dinosaur,” Tony began. “We’ll get the people off this island but we can’t leave that thing here, it’s too dangerous, so we have to kill it.”
Steve seized a hold of the petrol line and wrenched it towards him, with his other hand holding the knife he started to saw at it speedily. After what seemed like a lifetime the tube finally broke in half, the contents inside spilling all over Steve’s chest. The blonde placed the knife back into his pocket, before he spread the petrol further down onto his legs and arms like a flash, making sure his scent was covered enough to fool the smart creature.
“Good,” Carol huffed, pinching the bridge of her nose. “Everyone’s on top of everything here, Bruce is sorting stuff out down in the main hall, but I’ve got a bit of bad news.”
“What’s going on, Thor?” Bruce appeared beside him, followed by Clint who looked more confused than anyone else in the room. “Everything okay?”
“I was.” Tony snorted, running a hand through his hair. “It’s why you ended it Steve, you said so yourself… I wasn’t there for you… I could have treated you better.”
“Yes, mam.” Natasha grinned, hearing Tony and Thor chuckle over the line. “Let’s get out of here then, boys. Matt?” she turned to her husband, finding it odd that he hadn’t said a word during the entire discussion. “Matt?”
“Checked for what?” Tony frowned, he knew the plans had been tested over a few times since they’d started building it, everything had seemed fine from the get go.
“It should be there.” Natasha said calmly, exchanging a look of uneasiness with her husband across the stream.
The Raptors halted, heads bowed low and teeth bared in an inaudible growl. Steve stood his ground, watching the creatures every move as they clicked their tongues and snarled loudly.
“What?” Tony squealed in disbelief. “Steve, we have to get back to base, we are not following the damn dinosaur!”
Tony felt his heart swell at the words, and couldn’t help but smirk a little. “You were worried about little, old me?”
“I’m sure we won’t,” Peter said as he kept on walking, Wade trailing beside him. “I bet we taste gross, like coffee with too much sugar.”
Breathing heavily, trying his hardest not to make a sound, Steve listened as the dinosaur’s loud footfalls edged closer to him. She must have seen him, there was no other explanation. Then it hit him, he felt like an idiot for not even thinking about the obvious although his mind was in frantic mode at that minute, he was a dinosaur researcher and he’d forgotten what most dinosaurs were very good at. Smelling. And if she was anything close to a T-Rex, then she could undeniably smell him as if he were right in front of her nose.
The teenager’s head shot up at the urgency in Wade’s voice as he called him, and was surprised to see the man running full sprint towards him with a mad grin on his face. Peter was about to ask him what the hell was going on when his boyfriend grabbed a hold of his hand and yanked him off the bench.
Tony could have hit himself for the stupid question, by the amount of cuts on Steve’s arms, and the possible bruise forming on his cheek he’d say he wasn’t doing too great.
“How do you know?” Tony whispered, feeling his own flesh shiver at the spooky atmosphere. “But that could be further down, we didn’t exactly pay much attention because I may have panicked a little.”
“I had meetings this afternoon.” As soon as the engineer had said it he regretted it. “I mean… I was going to see them tonight, for some food and stuff.”
The Foniassaurus roared at the top of its voice, as if crying out in victory. Peter, in his terror, let the phone slip from his hand, the device forgotten as the dinosaur prepared itself for another chew on the tree.
It felt like slow motion as the three lifted their feet off the ground and made a sprint for the open gate. Steve kept his eyes on the exit, trying his damn hardest to tune out the thunderous thumping of the dinosaur’s feet on the ground. He tugged Jessica along as she began to falter from not having her husband beside her, Luke running at the back like a barrier between them and the meat eater.
Tony felt his heart skip a beat at Thor’s words, he let out a heavy breath he’d been holding, feeling like a huge weight had been lifted off his shoulders. “Fuck.” He cursed, holding a hand to his heart, one stray tear falling down his cheek. “Jesus, fucking Christ!” before he could stop himself he felt his knees give way, thankfully Thor was quick enough to guide him into a chair.
“Phew.” Wade sighed, shaking his shoe to get rid of the clumps of dirt sticking to it. “That’s alright then.” He said as he began hoping on one leg, trying to put his trainer back on.
Steve laughed lightly, making Tony’s smile widen at the sight. “They’re called Triceratops, Tony, and you were throwing the food at their mouth.”
Natasha cried in terror at seeing her husband in the creatures jaws, pulling up her gun and pointing with haste. “FIRE!” She screamed frantically, as Matt wend limp.
“Oh, about how this company is dedicated to pleasing the customers? How we have expert geneticists working daily to find new species to create a bigger and better park? How that science guy Wong steals all the tea from the cupboard and constantly plays Beyonce songs whilst working?”
