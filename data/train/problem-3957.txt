“To New York, then,” he said, grinning widely.
bed, and have the filthiest sex, or…
He knows Dean has a lot of studying to tend to, exams that need to be prepared for, papers that are due, and he helps the best he can. Sometimes all he can do is feed the poor man and maybe suck him off to ease some tension, and sometimes he can actually help with the studying. He’s so proud of his intelligent boyfriend and any time Dean can afford to spend on Cas and Cas alone feels so precious to him.
“Not a cowboy,” he muttered but no one heard him over the rest of the noise.
Blinded by his fear of losing Dean, Castiel propelled himself to his feet.
, he couldn’t come like this. Couldn’t force Cas to swallow, couldn’t be that kind of guy, no matter how much he wanted to see Cas just fucking take it, take him, to want him as much as Dean wanted him. Wanted Cas to come hard all over himself while Dean fucked him.
But Dean found water in a white chair with a lid that came off. He kneeled in front of it and put his head down it. It was further down that he thought, and the position was uncomfortable. Maybe you were supposed to use a ladle?
Actually, Dean had kind of counted on that. He hasn’t put on the panties yet, wanting to save that experience for the actual mating and feeling pretty certain that Cas would need to be tended to first.
“Because Dean is too chicken.”
Cas, on the other hand, stared his fill, a grin spreading slowly across his face as he took in Dean’s whole look.
He hurried into the kitchen after pointing Dean in the right direction and well inside the small room he leaned on the counter and took a deep breath before adjusting his dick. So yes, turned out this was actually happening and Castiel needed to shake his school-boy giddiness because Dean didn’t just look like sex on a stick, he also had the moves to back it up and Castiel would be damned if he blew this for himself.
Dean allowed himself to moan about that because damn, that felt pretty fucking good. With some difficulty, he managed to shrug off the wrecked shirt and the game was really on after that. He relaxed his body, sinking down to sit with his crotch pressed against Castiel’s. The chair creaked menacingly but Dean barely heard it over his and Castiel’s combined groans. Fucking
“Hey, it’s fine,” Dean laughs and opens his jeans, lifting his butt so he can slide them down. “I’ll wear it for you, little Alpha, if it gets you this riled up.”
Castiel once asked Dean who he’d been praying for, or if that had also been part of the ruse, considering Dean wasn’t very religious to begin with.
Sam punched him playfully on the arm. “Don’t kiss and tell.”
in Cas?
It’s so sudden and surprising that Cas doesn’t at first register what happened. He keeps thrusting for a moment, grunting as his pleasure mounts, crests, Dean’s hole spasming pleasurably around him. It’s only when he lowers Dean’s leg and reaches for his dick to help the man over the edge that he realizes that Dean already came. A lot.
Even the pretense of making the bed seems ridiculous and most days he just ends up tossing the blanket haphazardly on the bed. There’s a mostly empty pizza carton in his room too that he knows needs addressing but fuck it, like most days he feels like it can wait. Almost everything can wait. Dean is frankly happy he’s even able to get out of bed and brush his teeth at this point.
“I suppose I am. Look, Sammy,” he met his little brother’s eyes with mostly sincere resolution. “I’m sorry this didn’t turn out the way you hoped, it was a good idea but maybe,” he breathed out harshly. “Maybe we can just go back east, and it can work out anyway? We got by last time we stayed in Boston on all kinds of odd jobs, right? We can do that again.”
(Oh for the love of—)
He was soon all the way hard, dick tenting his dress pants and Cas was rocking steadily against him, his dick hard as iron against Dean.
Roy and Walt stop, leering, and obviously says something upsetting back. Dean starts forward but is stopped by Benny, who puts himself between and goes up in Roy’s face. The younger boy stays by Charlie’s side, one hand on her shoulder as she hunches in on herself.
“Gabe!” he gasps, glasses slipping down his nose for no apparent reason. Glasses aren’t supposed to do that, he’s been informed.
“Actually,” he has to clear his throat when his voice breaks on that one word. “Actually, I have. A date,” he looks up to meet the shocked eyes of his family, their Beta scents thick with disbelief. Castiel nervously rights his glasses. “On Friday.”
“Don’t sound so surprised,” he sniffs, making her laugh at him. “He’s a catch. Might be the one.”
“But I didn’t…?” Dean felt torn. On the one hand, good for him since he needed the money anyway, on the other hand, it was basically stealing, wasn’t it? “Are you sure there hasn’t been a mistake? I couldn’t have made this payment.”
slippers?”
Cas breathed out harshly and his hand on his dick stopped rubbing, instead just gripping himself as he watched Dean with dark eyes. Fucking
“Way to be informative,” Jo drawls, making Charlie giggle in the backseat.
“Sweet?” Castiel chuckled. “Because of the mango chutney, I suppose,” he smiled when Dean just looked at him, expression open. “Are you full?”
(For breeding)
“Right,” Dean mumbled, turning to jog back to the pond.
But they were running away, and the two men who’d come with the new guy only gave chase a short moment, before coming back.
. No, no, no,” he shakes in Cas arms, groaning deep and long as he reaches his climax and Cas hugs him, breathes him in, satisfied beyond belief at feeling Dean like this.
He reached around Dean in the last moment, fumbling with the demon’s hard dick, trying his damndest to make it good for Dean too but too late, much too late. He pressed his cheek against Dean’s head, the horn digging into his skin as he groaned open-mouthed when he emptied deep inside Dean.
“It was—” Castiel has to clear his throat. “It was nice meeting you as well.” He suddenly feels bad for just abandoning Benny like this. “Are you sure you don’t want to come back with us? Do you have a place to stay for the night?”
Castiel’s eyes had definitely adjusted enough to the darkness that he could see Dean’s eyes widening.
His words, unexpectedly, make the man groan and cover his face with his hands. Castiel watches, entranced.
hands, the way his fingers wrapped around the small matches. With burning ears he’d watched greedily as Dean’s delectable lips formed prayers for the poor souls and he’d gone home and punished himself many times for imagining such lustful things about a man of the cloth, not the least during such a holy moment.
The man grunted and stumbled back, almost crashing into the wall beside the door. Castiel winced and thought it was good that he had chosen to turn off the lights. He did that for the rape fantasies for two reasons. Mainly because it usually added to the sense of danger because it was difficult to see but also because he was bad at controlling his face when it came to inflicting certain types of pain.
It pissed him off that Cas would be in the situation he was, all because of his ex-wife. He just wanted good things for Cas but fuck if he could come up with a solution.
Sure, he was technically an adult now, but he was also still young and he wanted his parents’ blessings. Also didn’t want them to worry about him but he really fucking felt like he needed to be with Cas right now.
Boldcreek was only about twenty minutes away by foot from their claim but Dean took his horse anyway, mostly because Sam thought Dean was going to town to get supplies. Well, maybe he was a little, but in reality he went because he was frustrated.
The man anyhow certainly didn’t seem interested in knowing because he just grabbed Dean’s ass cheeks and spread him again. There was a heart-stopping moment where Dean tried to wrap his head around what would happen and then the man just fucking leaned in and
said he would.
“I know,” he mumbled. “I dunno what to do, though. Forget about it, I guess? I mean, to me it felt…
been this mushy before, usually not one for emotions during sex, but the scent of Cas’ happiness makes it all worth it. “
(As if you have any bearing on what nice is)
“I am,” he mumbles and feels goosebumps travel down his back and legs when Dean smacks the belt against his hand again. His nipples perk up to the point of hurting and he absentmindedly rubs his palms over them.
Dean squeezed his eyes shut against Sammy’s icy tone. He wasn’t Deanmon anymore, he
“Thought you would’ve noticed that when I slapped you.”
“No,” Dean cupped Cas’ jaw, bringing him in for another kiss. This one sweeter by far and Dean could feel Cas’ confusion in it as well. “I’ll do it, I want to. Also, do you have some kind of crème or something? We should look at your ass.”
In any case, Sammy’s gleeful voice returned the day of the awaited Thanksgiving dinner, when Cas said they should take a shower.
Cas was eating the other angel. A dead body, one of his
“How apt,” Cas commented, and Dean had almost forgotten what they were talking about.

Dean. He’s
“No,” Dean exclaims, frowning. “I just told you I won’t hurt him. I really like him—”
He shivered for an entirely different reason than before when he waded out into the pond. The water was warm, the sun heating it all day and evening, but it was still cooler than the air and it took Dean’s breath away when he dunked his head under the surface.
“I’m Dean, I’m Cas’—”
Dean’s dumb brain wanted to say that he didn’t have any claim over the river upstream, or downstream. Cas could swim all he wanted there without Dean’s permission. But that was of course not what Cas was asking and Dean found himself just nodding mutely.
Dean agreed but at the same time he thought he shouldn’t agree.
“I’m sorry,” Cas made a face as if he’d smelled something bad. “I’m not gonna force you to come. It’s just…” he sighed, deeply. “I did promise I’d go, and my family is so full of shit, they won’t ever shut up about it if I don’t. And I guess it was a couple’s sign up for some reason, probably one of the ladies trying to set their daughter up with someone. And I just
And every time his dick has gotten harder than he ever gets when he’s alone and he has ended up masturbating pathetically, lonely on his big bed. Once, he’d called Dean and he had talked Castiel into coming against his mattress, helplessly trapped in his boxers. Dean had called that “insanely hot” and when he next came to visit after a finished monster hunt, he’d been so wound up he’d accidentally left bite marks on Castiel’s neck that his boss, Nora, had seen and smiled knowingly about. That had been embarrassing to no end, even though Nora knows about his preferences and is very supporting, but somehow it had also made everything better for Castiel. He’d found in that moment that he likes being marked by Dean, and he hadn’t been against the sting of the bite itself either.
“If we wait until I have properly graduated from high school then none of that should be a problem,” Dean states clearly and Cas can’t help but think about the fact that he’s been told the same thing before. Has even contemplated it himself lately. But before he can say anything, Dean looks away, jaw clenched. “But you’re too focused on what society says. It feels like you’re saying what people think is more important to you than how I feel and who am I kidding, of course it is.  Because even if I graduate you could still get that predator label and it could still destroy the young
He cleans himself again today, for lack of anything productive to do, but opts out of the cologne because what was he thinking anyway? Dean isn’t someone to woo with expensive things, Dean is tenacious and straight-forward, and he’s already in love with Cas.
Dean snorts. “They try but it doesn’t take with me, I can have shit thrown at me. It’s when they go after others that I see red.”
“Why?” she seemed genuinely surprised, which made Dean feel better about his decision. “Are you sick?”
Maybe it was because he wanted to keep Cas for himself? The thought unsettled him because it made it sound like something it was not and that made him think he really
“Not like that,” Cas’ voice floated somewhere above Dean’s consciousness, but he felt helpless to obey.
That had the desired effect as Cas chuckled, looking at Dean with affection. “And of course, no attacking people or other things. You just squeeze my hand if you feel threatened, okay?”
feel as good as it does, Cas knows it shouldn’t and yet he can’t help but embrace the warmth that curls in his stomach. He’s the
Dean gritted his teeth, angered with himself for even thinking so low of his own father but the thought lingered even as he walked up to the stand where Missouri the Herbalist peddled her wares. She greeted him with her usual knowing smile and thankfully didn’t ask what he needed all those healing herbs for.
Dean nodded. “I know but hey,” he flicked Sam’s arm when his mere words failed to get his brother’s attention. “Don’t go around telling people, okay?”
He feels his cheeks heat unexpectedly. Lover? That word is strong but it’s not as strong as the word he wants to use…
“Is that true, Dean?” Cas asked, tone intimate all of a sudden and Dean was happy Gabriel had left their side to go get the drinks. “Did you order for me?”
“Thank you, Alpha,” he murmurs sweetly, his scent comforting. “You’re looking dashing as always.”
want to go back there. The other demons had made it clear that they would kill him if he returned. Why they hadn’t just up and killed him then and there was still a mystery that eluded him.
aiming to give me a heart-attack,” Cas grumbles and grabs the Astroglide again, squirting fresh lube in his hand to warm it up a little first. “And no, we can’t. I trust you when you say you’re clean, but I don’t want you to just take my word for it, I’ll take some tests first.”
Sam hummed thoughtfully. “He has a job, right? Maybe it’s a little too much, with uni and everything?”
“I’m glad, little brother,” Gabriel chuckled, holding up a cookie, which Castiel greedily accepted. “You deserve it.”
“Yeah? You like that, don’t you princess?”
Oh Dean was planning to. He was planning to go so wild it would go in the other direction and not get wild at all. In fact, he was planning to make love to Cas like a badass and maybe
He shivered as scalding heat travelled up and down his spine and he arched against the angel, his dick digging into the mossy ground.
The man who’d yelled at the other men snorted into his beer. “They’d play even better if they’d just
“Shit,” Dean gasps and slows his strokes to a stop. Cas’ hips twitch and Dean bucks down once before stopping himself. “Shit, wait. Can’t come on our clothes.”
too much interest in Cas’ proximity.
He left the lecture hall, chatting with Benny and feeling pumped about their first assignment, small as it was, and didn’t even think about Cas and that whole shitstorm. It felt liberating all the way until Dean realized that thinking about
“Well,” Dean sat down heavily on his bed. “Basically his family is on his case about going and he doesn’t want to so he said he would bring me if they forced him. And like, I guess he said it so they would back down but I kinda wanna go, if he asks again.”
“That’s true,” Cas nods. “And I’ll talk to him about possible side effects of repressing my rut for so long. I won’t do it if there’s even a slight chance that I could harm you.”
“You taste so good,” he said, voice rough, and wiped his mouth with the back of his hand. His demon eyes came out without him having a saying in it when he rolled his hips down so that his dick could rub against Cas’ stomach.
“Dean,” he exclaimed, surprised, and Dean smiled widely up at the man. Fucking hell he was pretty. “I thought you went back. Or away.”
“Whatever, do you wanna do this or not?” Gary gave him a superior smirk. “You seemed eager enough just a moment ago, like a proper little slut.”
“Fuck you always feel so fucking good,” Dean moans lowly, eyelashes fluttering against his pink cheeks. He’s absolutely stunning on any day but in the throes of passion he’s something spectacular to behold. “So fucking perfect for me, Cas.”
Wasting no time, Dean jerked out his knife, tossing it to the side. The angel made his discomfort heard by growling threateningly but the glow was back to being blue, and very faint at that, so Dean just rolled his eyes.
The boredom, the frantic need to
“I'm glad you came today,” he manages in the end, voice more level than he thought it would be.
Why did Cas keep asking if Dean remembered? Of course he did. “I do. I remember you didn’t want to go but he wanted you to ask your ex-wife. I also remember that that was very tacky of him.”
He feels his come as it splashes up on his own stomach but there’s so much that Dean has to get completely soaked and Castiel almost goes insane with the need for that to be true. His Omega should be covered in his come, should rub it in and revel in it, and Castiel wants to
Dean nods again, slower now and starts climbing down. It’s a short way but Cas sticks close by anyway, hands still on the boy even though he withdrew from the skin contact. He recognizes the fact that he felt way too much regret in losing the contact and he feels at odds with himself because of it.
“Dunno, but remember that time when I came home with a mountain lion hide and I told you I’d gotten lucky and killed it?”
“How efficient,” Dean said and meant it, meant, even, to ask more about it because it was interesting to learn about Cas and angels in general. But he got distracted when Cas stood up, holding out a hand for Dean’s bowl.
Usually it’s Dean who initiates their dates and picks the locations, not because Castiel doesn’t want to but simply because he doesn’t know how to. He’s learning, though, although he’s pretty sure what he’s about to ask isn’t something Dean would have in mind. It makes him even more nervous.
died,” Dean started again, voice louder and more certain but he still didn’t know how to finish his question, afraid of the answer.
Pam gives him a sweeping look as they turn to leave, clearly checking him out again, but she doesn’t say anything else and Cas finds himself grateful for it.
Cas arches up into the renewed stroking, gratefully focusing on his own pleasure now that his lover has been satisfied. It doesn’t take him long, not with Dean’s hand around him and the young man’s mouth on his neck. He’s grabbing Dean’s body, hands harsh as he massages his ass and thighs and it’s when Dean bites his right ear lobe that Cas comes with a choked off grunt.
“Besides, we’ll make a log cabin, we don’t need anything fancy like we have in the village. No glass windows.”
to fall in love like this.”
But that was all pretty easy for young Castiel to adjust to, especially since his right eye still worked normally. What was worse was the damage to his brain, or more correctly the connection of his left arm and the thalamus. The connection hadn’t been completely severed, the sensation of pressure still remained somewhat, meaning that Castiel still retained the actual use of his hand and arm. But he couldn’t feel pain or any kind of other sensation on that arm or hand.
“What a Hermione thing to say,” Dean grinned at his own joke, and then chuckled when he saw that Benny didn’t get it. “Dude, read a book.”
“You look so fucking good like this,” Dean groans. “All on display for me, my precious little angel, huh?”
Castiel makes an undignified noise when Dean pushes him down on the bed. He bounces once but lands almost perfectly with his head on the pillow. And oh, there’s no doubt that this is Dean’s bed. The Omega’s scent wafts up and wraps around Castiel and he has never felt so safe in his life.
“I’m debating it,” he mumbles, nape prickling with the knowledge that Dean is somewhere in this store.
But his mind derailed when Cas grabbed his hard cock in an oil slick hand. His breath was punched out of him and he made a strangely vulnerable sound that he hoped he would never make again. But it just felt so good. So incredibly good to feel Cas’ big hand, sure hand, wrap around him, hold him securely, smear him with the oil.
Dean’s breathing hitched and he looked at Cas with wide eyes for a second before starting to rip off his own clothes. They went flying who the fuck knew where, phone making a dull thud as his shorts hit the floor. Cas kept undressing calmly, a satisfied grin playing on his lip as he watched Dean struggle with getting naked.
it, and not asked first.
Deep bass music played from the open area on the ground floor. It was loud and penetrating and grated on Castiel’s nerves. He was seated on one of the crescent shaped sofas one floor above, close to the railing that ran along the balconies, allowing them to look down at the scene below.
, Cas’ ass felt perfect in his hands. Cas groaned deeply into the kiss when Dean squeezed him, so deep that it ought to have hurt his throat, and pulled out to look at Dean, eyes hooded and dangerous in the most delicious of ways.
Cas huffed out a growl.
As he rode back to their camp, drinking directly from the bottle to get the taste of the night out of his mouth, he was at least glad he wasn’t a pious man. Though he supposed if any one of them was damning their eternal soul it was Cas, though apparently that was fine if the cock was good enough.
“You think I would poison you?” Castiel asked, saddened. Not so much to be suspected of such a thing but because he knew how true it would be in most instances. Creatures such as this were most often met with distrust and aggression, even though not all were deserving of it. “I’m not.”
Dean positively beams and Cas only later realizes that he didn’t tell Dean’s parents about the first time he took Dean into his home either. Well, two times is not a habit so he thinks that they’re still safe. Just because he wants Dean to come back (for some goddamn reason) doesn’t mean that the boy will, especially not if Cas manages to help get the bullies under control.
“What?”
Thank you all so much for simply being here, even after everything awful that 2020 brought us. SPNFamily forever! I hope to see you all next week when I return with a (hopefully) fun little romp 😄 for an upcoming, longer fic, I have planned something in the line of demon!Dean and human!Cas, but not in the canon sense of the term "demon" 👀 the tags on that one are going to be fun!
“Is that what this is about? Cas, I’m kinda injured all the time, a few bruises is nothing.”
Straightening, he looked himself over. He supposed this was about as good as it was going to get, a grown male Alpha in a dress and wig. If he was completely honest, he wasn’t wholly against the braid, and the dress came with a sheer cape-like thing that felt very flowy. And blue always was his color anyway.
Well, that wasn’t
Holy fucking hell that made Dean feel
Oh he does his best to distract himself from thoughts of Dean, of what he had said and of the fact that he’s sleeping in Cas’ bed, all warm and vulnerable. He ends up remembering too much of Dean’s heated words and warm body, pressed so close to him, and finds himself wanting to jerk off but doesn’t. Instead, he sneaks past Dean to the master bathroom and takes a quick shower, colder than how he usually prefers it.
Time for that "good morning blow-jobs" tag to really mean something!
it was so late into the night that the summer sky had almost started to lighten again, the sun already on its way up even though Dean was pretty sure it was just past midnight.
Dean was very aware that he was making himself too available. He shouldn’t come running every time Cas whistled or the other man would perhaps start taking Dean for granted. He knew that but he also didn’t care right now. Because what they were doing was still too new for that to be true and Dean was so desperately in love with Cas by now that he would take any and everything he was offered.
“Nothing weird about that,” Castiel said gently. “I imagine there are lots of boys who like to wear dresses.”
Kisses!
close to chewing on the curtains and he had vowed to not let that happen.
“Let me look at you,” he mumbles, stepping up to Dean again and grabbing the boy’s chin to angle his face this and that way.
“And don’t worry about dad, he wants us to be happy, no sweat.”
“Oh, hey,” he smiled and handed Cas his cigarettes, putting the ashtray on the windowsill where it was within reach for Cas. “I thought you’d want these.”
“I’m just—” Sam huffs again and looks at the ground. “I’m thinking about Cas, y’know?”
Yeah okay, despite Dean’s stupid venture into Emotion Land, his dick was coming back full force and he moaned pathetically as a wave of arousal crashed over him. Cas grinned, predatorily and spectacularly, and ripped open one of the lube packages.
“The fuck?” the man exclaimed and touched his jaw gently.
of horniness come rushing back at him.
“Cas…”
“Yeah I guess,” Dean leaned his head back again, looking up at the ceiling and thinking about how Cas had ducked his head the first time he approached the man. “I didn’t ask, I got the feeling he was ashamed of his scars or something.”
Sam smiled, a secret little smile, fingers dancing along the back of one of the chairs. “Because you’re happy.”
“Maybe that wouldn’t be the worst thing, to involve more adults?”
“Alpha…”
“I don’t think we’ve been introduced,” Kali said then, her voice sultry and Dean offered up his best smile.
“You’re too sweet,” Cas laughed, as if he thought Dean was playfully exaggerating. “The event is this Friday, do you think you can make it?”
“Says the man who eats honey every day.”
guy.”
“Hey!”
“Huh.”
“You’re a goddamn menace, is what you are.”
“You’ll do that anyway,” Dean grinned, but then his eyes landed on his suit jacket and he turned somber again. His stomach knotted itself a little when he thought about Cas’ outburst about the charity event. They hadn’t talked about it since that day when Michael was over, but Dean was dying to get a status update on the matter. “Hey, while you’re here,” he held up the jacket. “Is it super obvious that this is a high school graduation suit?”
“You thought I was menacing?” Cas asked, amused, and stepped away, taking Dean’s hand and leading him to the pond. “I was so careful with you.”
“That’s normal stuff,” Castiel grumbled. “And I like it.”
Dean limped a bit as they crossed the lawn but Castiel saw no obvious injuries and from what he could remember Dean had seemed very nimble last they met. He decided that that was another thing he would have to carefully weasel out of the demon because the direct approach didn’t seem like it would be appreciated.
“Knock yourself out,” he heard himself say and he smiled wide in response to Dean’s happiness.
He cleared his throat. “If you lean against the doorposts and leave the door open, you’ll have support, and you’ll be able to just walk away from me if you don’t like it. Like, if you leaned against the wall, you’d maybe feel trapped? But I dunno, the door seems better?” he trailed off, uncertain, but Cas just grinned at him.
“No I guess you didn’t,” Dean sounds awfully smug for some reason. “We don’t know each other but I have a hunch you’re not some kind of knothead Alpha who’ll treat me like I’m an idiot made of glass.”
, and actually craned his neck submissively to the side, peeking at Dean.
The bruises had all but disappeared now, though. Dean’s body no doubt utilizing the supernatural healing most (if not all) demons had. Those hadn’t troubled Castiel as much, to be honest. What scared him more was the disarray of cuts and scars that went over Dean’s body in zig zag patterns. Because those were old, and they had to be deep to leave scars on someone like Dean, on any demon. Deep or constant.
“Why not?” Cas asks kindly, leading Dean into the house with a gentle hand on his elbow. “You’re welcome here any time.”
Well, Cas had earned it, Dean thought. He’d worked a lot in the past week and Dean wanted to show how much he appreciated Cas in general, which was probably why he had started the day with that blowjob. He squirmed against Cas, pressing closer as Cas flipped through the channels.
“Or even worse,” she exclaimed, exasperated, and Castiel felt a sick thrill at having her express so much emotion all of a sudden. “Humans aren’t as innocent as you seem to think.”
“I know princess,” Castiel gritted out because damn, it had to hurt the man. “Delicious, isn’t it?”
His spine burned with his arousal and he panted hotly, leaning down over Dean again, one hand on the seat beside Dean’s head as Dean grabbed his body to pull him even closer.
“I bet you both wish a lot of things,” there’s no malice in her words and yet Cas is as hurt as he is comforted by them.
Cas gave him one last squeeze and stepped away, turning around and removing his shirt in the same motion. Dean couldn’t help how his eyes roamed Cas’ back for a moment, his hands fumbling as he worked on his pants.
Dean mulled that over as Cas bent down and picked up the bird by its wing, carrying it over to the edge of the woods. He followed slowly as Cas started digging and came to stand beside the little hole, looking down at the darkness.
Dean’s body shuddered as a wave of pleasure rolled over him, waking him from his deep sleep. He mumbled something unintelligible and turned his head on the pillow. Realization that this wasn’t his pillow pulled him further from sleep’s grasp and he frowned slightly, rolling his hips up into—
“Okay,” Dean flashed Cas a huge grin just as they made the last turn onto Cas’ drive-way. “Great. Anyway, I’m not gonna say anything like that because you’re allowed to feel how you fucking want to. But if you’re allowed to feel like that then I’m entitled to my feelings too, okay?”
They’d talked some, probably more than Cas should have but definitely less than he had needed and Meg had promised him that they would resume this conversation when she was more sober. He had also made her promise not to tell Gabe about Cas’ inappropriate crush on his student because even though Gabe means well he’s kind of a trickster and Cas doesn’t need this to garner any more attention than necessary.
“I don’t have internal bleeding,” Dean interrupts, amused. “You and Sam are too alike.”
“R-really?” Dean moans breathily.
, framing them.
And then he has one hand down Cas’ suit pants and oh, he’s so hot and hard in Dean’s hand. Perfect, he’s perfect. Dean mewls against Cas’ ear, tugging, and Cas hums, releasing Dean’s butt to push down his own pants some. They only get past his ass, get stuck on his thighs, but neither of them cares about that, not when Cas’ dick is against Dean’s and they’re grinding together.
(For fuck’s sake)
The angel narrowed her eyes. “Where did Dean go? Did you push him inside?”
“He’s just really… I dunno, I wanna get to know him more.”
Without thinking he places his feet flat on the bed, the movement jostling Dean and making him whine out a moan as his whole body shudders. With this new leverage Castiel manages to meet Dean’s rolling with thrusts of his own and good God, that just makes everything better.
and he felt bad. Felt even worse about how proud he felt when he saw that the one on Cas’ neck was still very much visible even when he put on a t-shirt, but damn that really appeased his lizard brain.
when Cas called him pet names. “I want to swallow.”
“I did it. I
“You’re…?”
“I can’t let you do that, not when I was the one who suggested food.”
“I would, actually,” he easily admitted, voice low and inviting. “I would like to know that very much.”
confused.
to not live with your mate, just saying.
Suddenly he feels fingers against the lining of his boxers. “Why don’t you get naked too and we’ll get on the bed?”
“You see,” Bob panted and fuck yes, there his slacks went and Dean wasn’t slow with pushing down the man’s underwear too. “I’m kinda small in the dick department.”
“I understand. Do you want to be left alone or…?”
“I’m not completely blind.”
And so the journey ends for our boys, all's well that ends well 🥰
“So it
Was he seriously telling Castiel that he’d been living about 25 years on insects and plants? And stolen human food, he supposed, but how had that been enough to feed a demon?
*****
“Dean,” it was Sam’s turn to grab Dean’s arm. “Don’t think you’re getting away, tell me what you found.”
“Oh, little demon,” he sighed, one hand going down to grab Dean’s butt and pull him even closer. “The only reason I haven’t had sex with you is because I thought you might not enjoy me. And I didn’t want you to think I took advantage of you,” it was clear by Dean’s adorable little frown that he didn’t really understand what that meant. “You’re very beautiful, Dean,” he said with a smile and watched with delight how Dean’s frown smoothed into a smile of his own.
“That’s very sweet of you, but I’m taken,” she teased, and Dean couldn’t help but chuckle. He liked banter like that, especially with people working customer service. “What can I help you with?”
“I understand,” he says, a small smile making his lips curve. “Should I join you, then?”
That was the second time Sammy had called him pathetic today but somehow the impact was less this time.
“To the whole room?”
So he was content with just fingering around the hole, getting to know it and how it felt to touch it, as Cas continued jerking their cocks together, the water washing away the evidence of their enthusiasm.
During the building of the cabin, Sam and Cas grew increasingly close and by the end of it, Cas told Dean he felt as if he’d always been part of the family. Dean, for his part, was secretly a little jealous of how well Sam and Cas got along but at the same time he was so elated he could cry. His family was very important to him, after all, and he had been scared Cas wouldn’t fit in, or wouldn’t want to fit in, and Dean hadn’t known what he would do if that happened.
“I ain’t gonna be pretty with you and ask about why you’re doing this to yourself,” Dean stated, wholly unnecessarily but standing his ground for some reason.
Dean was caught in a limbo between outrage and disbelief, and no small amount of that was directed at himself because fuck if he’d hated what had happened as much as he should have. Should have pushed Cas off.
It felt as if the world shook, as if Dean could feel Cas’ movements through the ground, the vibrations travelling up his body, and then Cas was covering Dean’s body with his sheer mass. And
. “We’ve done it before.”
,” Dean presses out and blows Castiel’s mind. “You fill me up so fucking good, never want this to end.
Firstly, he didn’t even know how he could have made Cas his slave, was that even a thing? And secondly, he really didn’t want that.
“Yeah,” Dean puffs out his chest a bit, holding up a shirt to the whitewashed jeans. “You’re fucking right. I’ll go there and do my best to be charming to them, for Cas’ sake. But in the end, all I need from that family is him.”
“Cas!” Dean hissed, hands coming to grip Castiel’s hair as Dean’s fur-covered thighs shook on either side of Castiel.
Dean uses his grip on Cas’ hair to turn his head, kissing the Alpha lightly, smiling into it when Cas relaxes immediately.
“I was so scared,” he says in a rasp. “All day. And then you call, and you’re at a bar?”
Castiel doesn’t particularly know. He’s been dumped and has dumped people, but he’s never really been sad about it. His former partners have told him it’s because he was never really in love with them but Castiel doesn’t know about that.
“I don’t want to talk about it,” he states curtly and walks back to his couch. The couch he slept on while Dean slept in his bed. His bed,
Dean jerked when he realized how close Sam was. “What?”
“Handmaiden of the queen?” Castiel smiles at Dean’s eager expression. “I think that’s a great position.”
The next day was a bleak one with heavy overcast clouds, filled with rain no doubt. Dean liked rain, it never rained in Hell. He wasn’t too fond of the cold that followed this time of year, though, but he didn’t dare voice that or Sammy would get mad.
“P-panties?” Cas stutters and Dean looks up sharply. He’s propped up against the door, shoulders and head resting against it and his legs in Cas’ lap. Cas seems completely enthralled with the possibility and he looks at Dean with desire so hot Dean can feel it as it licks over his skin.
meant to him, he needed to say all of that and say it clearly so that Dean understood. But now… now he was diving back in to tease Dean’s perky nipple, already humping the bed, and feeling Dean’s hard dick now free of its sheath and pressing against Castiel’s body.
He rumbled, pleased, and bent his head to press his snout against Dean again. Dean bucked back, ass pressing against Cas’ stomach, and grabbed for Cas’ jowls, keeping him close as he started humping the ground. Cas opened his mouth, the stench of the dead goat wafting over Dean and he gritted his teeth against it, but he actually couldn’t care less about whether or not that was gross. Not when he had Cas like this and when his body was allowed to feel this fucking good.
“I’ll help you clean off,” he said, voice hushed, and Dean only nodded.
There was a beat of silence and then the angel opened its mouth. Dean had time to see a white light at the back of the beastly throat, past the sharp fangs at the pink tongue, and then the worst sound he had ever heard assaulted him. It ripped through his very core, stealing his breath and making it feel as if his brain was being squeezed. His ears stung like someone was cutting into them with a branding iron, and he fell to his knees, clutching his head, screaming wordlessly and without hearing himself.
And as a teaser for next week, I leave you
“I’m sure it’s not that bad?” he tries, amused by Dean’s groaning. “You’re very handsome, that’s got to make up for some of it? If it’s just about technique?”
The jab hurts, more than the bump on his forehead had hurt. “You wouldn’t look at me at first either.”
“No? Cassie, you can’t keep findings like this to yourself, you—oh,” Balthazar’s eyes turned kind. “You meant
With that in mind, Castiel let his hands roam more than the exposed skin of Dean’s thighs and ass. He went up and under the man’s t-shirt, thumbs finding hard nipples and delighting in the way Dean moaned right in his ear when he brushed them. He went up and down Dean’s back, right hand even going up to cup the back of Dean’s head, almost reverently, in contrast to the desperate fire that burned within him.
A sudden noise from the table made him look over and he grinned widely when he saw that Meg was forced to struggle out of her shirt. She tossed it to the side, saw him watching and winked at him, and went back to the game where Rachel was busy shuffling out a new hand. Castiel leaned his head back against the couch and watched Meg with hooded eyes. Down to her bra and pants, she made quite the sight, he was man enough to admit that.
He wanted to sound suave and mature, but he felt tongue tied as soon as Cas was in the car. He wasn’t a big man, but his presence filled the whole space, pressed against Dean’s skin and set his every nerve ending on fire.
want, anything you do will be good for me. Except teeth.”
“Thank you Captain Obvious,” Gabe grouses. “And that’s exactly why I’m left to pick up the pieces, and don’t think I’m enjoying this. You’re like a stubborn bull when you’re sad.”
That makes Dean moan and God, Castiel can feel Dean’s dick jumping against his side. Dean wants that too; he likes this too. Castiel’s hips won’t stop, he’s driving his dick mercilessly against Dean’s shirt and thigh, leaking profusely.
a habit, and Cas is just overthinking his emotional response to seeing Dean like that. They’re still
Dean pinched his lips together for a moment, a rush of anger going through him. “And you thought you could decide that for me?”
“Thanks, man,” he grinned and grabbed the closest pair without even looking, heart thumping wildly.
His voice was low, a sweet sound meant only for Castiel’s ears and when Castiel turned towards Dean he noticed how close the young man actually was. Their thighs were pressed together, and Dean was angled so that his chest was pressing against Castiel’s right arm.
Gabriel gave him a scathing glare, which Castiel most definitely enjoyed too much. “You only said half-
“Dean,” he admonishes mildly. “I want you to be able to come here if you feel like you need to.”
“LARP-ing? It’s like role-playing but you dress up to do it and act out a role, like extravagant cosplaying.”
They stared at each other for a moment, the tension enough to stifle Dean, and then it broke when the man—Gabe—laughed out loud, leaning back on the table.
And he really was, even more so when Dean later in bed pulled Castiel into spooning him, cradling Castiel’s left hand against his chest and sighing contently. And Castiel thought in the dead of night, as he held Dean’s sleeping body, that this was probably the happiest he’d ever been, if only for a night.
does, but he knows he’s not up to par. Dean valiantly pushes on, though, and Castiel is starting to loosen up just as the waiter comes over and startles him.
After all the hustle and bustle with Christmas and New Year’s (which Cas handled better than Thanksgiving), it almost feels good to get back to school and the normalcy of work. Almost, but not quite, because school means seeing Dean again and Cas knows he won’t be able to take it.
“I bet no expenses were spared, then.”
“A regular suit is fine. Is it black?” he nodded when Dean nodded. “Then it’s fine. Mother likes to pretend we’re rich but we’re upper middle class at best. Father offed himself when I was little and we got some money from that, mother’s been riding that high for a long time.”
Dean thought that over for a moment. At first he hadn’t really been a fan of the whole
“I guess since I paid twice last time this one’s free?”
“Sorry, I didn’t think you’d react like that,” he gingerly puts a hand on Dean’s thigh. “But you’re right, I should’ve asked before.”
Dad made a face, the expression flitting over his harsh features so fast Dean wouldn’t have caught it if he didn’t know the man so well. It was an expression he saw often enough, though, when he spoke of hunting deep in the forest, high up in the mountains. When he spoke of going near where mom had died.
“I, um, yes.”
Get what? He couldn’t think with Dean like this. The young man smelled absolutely ravishing and the sounds he let out made hot chills go up and down Castiel’s spine. Again, Castiel’s eyes gave him conflicting images and his pleasure increased at the dual images when Dean leaned his head back, grinding harder against Castiel while exposing his throat.
Many kisses!
Castiel marvels for a moment how intimate and familiar basically everything has felt with Dean. As if they’re old friends or lovers, as if they’ve known each other much longer than barely an hour.
“Yes.”
“I am,” Dean shot back, laughing now too, and sliding to the side, mindful not to press his come stained front against any part of the couch. “I
Dean’s cheeks heated and he looked down. “We’re not dating…”
Oh fuck, Dean wanted that a whole lot. “Naked.”
“Yeah,” Dean chuckles. “Can’t really give a date. You?”
Dean pursed his lips. Honestly, it was a little hard to look at its suffering. Maybe he should fire an arrow between its eyes? Put it out of its misery? Or he supposed he could just walk away and spare himself from having to watch it die. He could go looking for some mushrooms now that that weird thunderstorm had subsided.
That had been disappointing, but Dean had handled it like a man and only fretted once he got home.
“How old does that make him in human years? 20?”
because it’s fucking flowery special with him.”
“I don’t need to hear it, jeez,” Gabe laughs, holding up a hand to stop Cas’ on-coming rant. “Anyway, I’m ditching you now, I have a hot date with Kali and you have…” he gestures at the cereal. “This. So you have fun with that and maybe later you can have
“Is it lame?” Dean almost looks a little sheepish and he pulls away his hand.
He’s leaking slick and together with Cas’ liberal amount of saliva everything soon becomes warm and sloppy and Dean loves it. He rubs his thumb against Cas’ neck and catches himself lazily thrusting into Cas’ mouth but can’t stop himself even though he makes an effort to. He doesn’t want to hurt the Alpha, he really doesn’t, but
“Have a good day at work?” he asked, coming to meet his mate just as Dean was pulling off his jacket.
He was jolted into the present when he heard Cas moving behind him. A spike went through him at the thought of the man turning away and leaving for Boldcreek. Leaving Dean to stand there by his fucking gold claim, feeling foolish.
Dean squeezes his hand. “I’m sorry.” He looks truly remorseful. “I should, I dunno, share more. I just want you to be as far away from anything supernatural as possible but maybe that’s hurting you, and us. Maybe,” he hesitates and Castiel can see the fear of loss play in Dean’s eyes. “Maybe I should take you to Bobby’s? I’ve been wanting you two to meet anyway, and he’s a much better teacher than I would be.”
Suspicious but also curious about Cas’ cryptic tone, Dean went to put on his jacket and boots while Cas changed into the red robin form again and flittered out the chimney.
In fact — he looked up to meet Cas’ curious eyes — he felt like he never wanted to deny Cas anything, ever.
“Please,” Dean whispered hoarsely. “Please, want you to suck me off.”
“So you’re saying you’d rather put your career before your happiness?” Dean looks sullen, almost angry, when Cas whips around to face him. “Before
“You have to stop this.”
“Shit,” Dean mumbled, trying to school his face. “I didn’t know.”
“There,” Dean said, putting the bowl and the rag on the ground and stepping back. “You’re gonna get better in no time, especially since you’ve eaten and been able to keep that food.”
something about whatever the fuck was buzzing inside him. His mind blank by now, he shucked off his clothes and threw himself in the pond, rinsing off the smell of sweat and nerves along with smoke and the meat he’d barbequed.
to say is that he’s not ‘normal’ by society’s standards and his family gives him shit for it. Like, they’re all Betas and his older brother apparently holds a fucking grudge for not being an Alpha when Cas is or some shit like that.”
Cas pumped his finger in and out for a moment and then stopped, finger buried as far in as it went. He resumed stroking his dick, but Dean could see that his grip was much looser, as if he wanted some friction but too much would throw him over the edge. The thought amped up Dean’s needs something fierce and he bucked his hips without thinking. The motion was so violent that it made his dick slap up against his own stomach and the pleasure that exploded from his groin almost made him lose it.
Castiel didn’t immediately obey, instead moving over to Dean’s right nipple and licking that, sucking gently on it until Dean felt a sharp arrow of pleasure shoot down his spine. He growled, more annoyed at himself for getting
“Tore down all the walls up here,” Bobby continues with a fond expression, solidifying Dean’s hopes. “Heaven ain’t just reliving your golden oldies anymore. It’s what it always should have been,” he looks out over the scenery, but Dean can’t tear his eyes away from Bobby. For one, he can barely believe Bobby is here and free, and more than that, he’s starting to feel really hopeful that Heaven is a nice place now.
“This the place?” Sam asks as they get out of Baby, looking around.
To be honest, Dean hadn’t thought that would be possible so soon, or even at all. Hell, he’d thought Cas’ insides had been too mangled for the angel to survive at all. But here Cas was, proving Dean wrong at every turn and Dean was loving it.
Dean drew a deep breath and felt a strange sense of accomplishment. He still didn’t know why Cas had eaten the angel but was willing to assume that he’d just been hungry enough and Dean thought he needed to remedy that, and fast. But not before he’d coaxed the angel out of the pond so he could look at the mistreated wound.
This time Castiel felt a swell of fondness, rather than jealousy.
she was possessive, even though it had never really been serious between them. In fact, Castiel sometimes regretted sleeping with her, because he knew she’d read more into the situation, and they had long since stopped because of that.
“And he took it like a gentleman?”
“Damnit,” Dean mumbles under his breath. “Look, Cas, I don’t want you to think I’m some kind of psycho, okay? I wouldn’t
“Dean,” Cas’ low tone makes Dean’s dick jump and he grabs it at the head to steady it. “Why were you in bed with my trench coat?”
“You don’t like it when people swear?” he murmurs, even though he’s pretty goddamn sure that’s not what Cas meant. He steps closer as the Alpha tries to find his voice and fuck it; Dean can’t help getting a little aroused again.
—Dean, you have to believe me, I—”
Dean barely knew himself, but Cas suddenly looked like he knew. That was a relief.
Dean would.
this were an ordinary man, they now have no one alive, and if it’s a vamp then the dead man’s blood on the first bullet would have been enough to keep the vampire still for long enough for them to interrogate him.
“I’m happy you like it,” Cas mumbled, his smile fond enough to make Dean’s heart thud hard.
“She couldn’t even be bothered to fake interest,” he grumbled after a while, allowing himself to feel the hurt of her disinterest for the first time. “And then she had sex with my brother, and he can’t shut up about how great she was.”
His cock was responding with an almost supernaturally short refractory period, but he wasn’t the least surprised. Not after experiencing that dry orgasm. There was just something about Dean, his succubus side of course, but also something more, that triggered these reactions in Castiel. And now, now that the dam had broken and he had gotten indisputable evidence that Dean wanted him as well and that things like these were okay to do, well now he could barely control himself anymore.
—I can’t wait, Cas, I’m sorry.”
“It reminded me so much of us that I had to jerk off.”
“Cas,” when Dean eventually spoke, his voice was wobbly, and he looked like he was about to cry. “I’m a demon…”
“Take me home, Dean.”
*****
The man looked Dean up and down and hell yeah, Dean liked those kinds of appreciative looks. He stretched and preened, giving the dude a grin of his own.
“‘M gonna wash this first,” Dean mumbled and started to swipe the cloth over Cas’ hip but was stopped when the man grabbed his wrist lightly.
and Cas just...
“Oh Dean,” Cas groaned and came deep inside Dean’s greedy body. Eye closed and jaw slack, he looked like the epitome of sexual completion as his hips stuttered abortively against Dean, his cock pumping.
“Curfew?” Dean snorted and pulled up the key from his pocket. “It’s in the middle of the day and besides, I’m 18; I can do what I want.”
“Something weird over the wire,” Sam cuts in. “One of the bodies—its blood was drained?”
“Not that I mind a private show,” the driver said with an amused grin. “But the clean-up isn’t worth it. Besides,” he rolled the car to a slow stop. “I think we’ve arrived at your destination.”
Gabriel startled, though probably more from the sight of Dean’s green eyes than the demon’s excitement. Castiel, on the other hand, felt a surge of inexplicable jealousy and for a moment all he could think about was how
“Well,” he shrugged as nonchalantly as he could while entering the house. Everything smelled of Cas, especially so the man himself and fucking hell Cas was so close now that Dean was inside as well. “I was in the neighborhood.”
“You do know that the guy who played Ivan is Swedish, though?”
Unless it was the succubus pheromones that made him react, of course…
Was that too much? It wasn’t Dean’s place, after all. Dean glanced at Cas again and found the man smiling to himself, that small smile that barely made his lips quirk.
It only lasted for a moment before he started feeling sorry for the angel, however. Not that he still wasn’t scared of it and not that he didn’t believe that angels killed humans but…
He stalked around the bed to get on it, positioning himself in the middle with his head on the pillow. It smelled, of course, of Cas and Dean forced himself not to sniff the pillow as Cas got on the bed too. He went easily, straddling Dean’s hips and reaching behind himself to put Dean’s stiff cock against the crack of his ass.
It only took him two tries to make something that pleased Andrea, and only one more until Lily was completely satisfied as well. After that, she stepped into the dress and Castiel zipped her up, Andrea helping with tying on the white apron and making a pretty bow in the back.
“Sure, son,” he grinned perhaps too widely, and Dean got the feeling that dad missed those faraway times. So nostalgic in a way. “With what? Figuring out who planted the bomb that exploded in your closet?”
Thank you for your positive responses on this admittedly different fic (at least different from my usual fics haha), I'm so happy you liked it, you have
“And did nothing!” Dean snaps, fiery eyes turning up at Cas and Cas takes a step back in pure shock and—he shouldn’t voice anything else, but Dean is damn captivating in this moment, that’s for sure.
“Yeh,” Dean nodded for good measure although it did him no good. Cas was still looking down. “We’re goin’ to Boston. Prob’ly. So ya see, I bought you ‘dis horse.”
Fucking
Without asking, he lifted Cas’ feet and placed them in Dean’s lap so that he could rub them.
It’s Friday evening and the Omega is picking Castiel up at his parent’s house to drive them to Dean’s childhood home for dinner with his father and little brother. Dean has been talking about this all week, obviously happy to start including Castiel in his family and Castiel is both excited and apprehensive.
He eats his lunch alone in the staff cafeteria not because he particularly wants to or because his colleagues don’t want to eat with him but because his phone call with Mrs. Walker dragged on. It’s fine, though, he spends the time on his phone chatting with Meg, his best friend.
The scar was softer than it looked and went from just under Cas’ ribs to below his belly-button.
He can meet everyone he’s ever loved again and again, and it will only fill up as more of them die, living a happy and long life down on Earth and then coming to join him. He wonders, as he drives through the seemingly endless forest, how many of them misses him, how many of them cry, and finds himself hoping no one cries but that they instead remember all the good he did, all the good times they shared, and that they smile, happy for having just known him.
And he was anyhow distracted when Cas put his warm hand over Dean’s, squeezing.
to ride a bull or a horse. The man was a cowboy, and Castiel’s childhood fantasies of the cowboys in old western movies came flooding back.
“And you’re hot as sin and have the perfect bedroom voice,” Meg concludes matter-of-factly. “Even out of the bedroom.”
Their tongues dance together, Dean much clumsier than he usually is when kissing but that’s only because he’s so aroused he’s choking on his burning need to release. He chases after Cas when the man pulls away, but Cas is not going far, only bending his head to kiss down the side of Dean’s neck and Dean gasps and presses closer. He arches his back and finally,
The moment Castiel’s fingers grazed Dean’s nipple a curiously rumbly sound escaped him, and his eyes darkened considerably. Dean sucked in a breath and braced himself when Castiel grabbed his upper body harshly, pressing his thumbs against both Dean’s nipples.
“Feeling good?” he asks and gets off the bed, putting away his phone.
The sight made Dean groan and he spread his legs as if that would make him come in contact with the bed but damnit, he was still too high up to be able to hump anything but air. Still felt good enough to fucking come, though. He gnashed his teeth against Cas’ skin for a moment longer, making Cas groan loudly and shit, Dean’s pleasure spiked almost painfully, and he wasn’t even sure what specifically made it so. Probably a combination of everything, he thought as he pulled away slowly, licking soothingly.
, puts his hands on Cas.
of tasting them means a whole lot and arouses Cas like nothing else.
It was only half an hour later when they eventually got up and started back but the cold had seeped into Castiel’s bones anyway and he was happy to get back to his car and the heat. Dean seemed not to notice the cold as much as Castiel thought he would (despite being a demon) but he attributed that to the sweater.
It went off with a swishing sound, embedding itself in the side of one of the deer’s chest. It jerked, stumbled, and then fell to the ground. The rest of the herd scattered at that same moment. Dean managed to fire off two more arrows before they were out of range, but both missed.
jumped into the ring and easily swung himself up on the bull. Castiel couldn’t see a whole lot of details from this far, but what he
(See the end of the chapter for
“I bet your friend is wondering where you are,” Cas added, amused. “Was this for you both?” he handed Dean the forgotten Starbucks bag, grinning widely, the little shit.
It was easy to find the main hall, not only because there was a humongous sign with the name again but also because of the dazzling lights and soft music coming from it. Dean didn’t know much but he knew that was classical music, like Mozart or that other dude who went deaf, and though he didn’t particularly enjoy it he could admit that it fitted with the theme of the evening.
“No—fuck—no, I—” he exhales shakily and Castiel suddenly understands.
, feels special. And it makes everything better.”
“Wait, yesterday?” Cas turned to Dean, seemed to reach for him without actually physically doing so. Dean shifted on his feet but felt as if they were too heavy for him to step away from Cas’ sudden closeness. “You returned here yesterday? So you hadn’t just kept away from Boldcreek, you went… somewhere entirely?”
For those of you who are curious about what Dean’s apartment looks like,
Okay, Dean felt better now that it turned out that Cas’ mind apparently also was susceptible to good kisses.
As he emerged from his tent, fully clothed once again, he thought that maybe it would be a good thing to try and move Cas to a more protected place. Mostly it was weather conditions he thought about since early May could be unpredictable. Yes, at first when he went to sleep, he’d been worried about wolves and other predators, especially considering they had a still relatively fresh corpse just lying there, ripe for the picking. And indeed, in the dead of night he’d woken to the sound of wolves howling nearby.
Wearily, he toed off his shoes and discarded his jacket in the hall closet, going into the bathroom. He was
for me that I had to wear my special underwear again.”
“Well maybe I want to,” Dean flexed his hands on Cas’ hips, feeling the give of the man’s lean muscles. “Some.”

, who was unworthy of her, was the one her precious fisherman consort had to turn to when his
from over it,” he mumbles and watches how Dean hunches in on himself, clearly surprised.
So yeah, those were the only reasons he had stayed for so long and
“Now we’re fucking getting somewhere,” Dean grunts, voice wrecked. “You been thinking about me eating you out, baby?”
“I’m in college,” Dean shot back before she could continue. “I would appreciate not being treated like a child. Ma’am.”
Dean sits down beside him, leaning back against the couch, and sighs. “You’re not, I’m just an idiot, aren’t I? Look, Cas, I’m just not used to, I dunno, have someone care so much.”
It evolved into a game of endurance of sorts after those first, more innocent times and, perhaps not so surprisingly, it was Dean who first bent to the will of his libido.
have the time for that right now.
“I will,” Gabriel huffed. “Remember, little brother, that for all your studies it was
“Are you okay?” Cas murmured as he removed his jacket, coming to help Dean out of his too. His tone suggested that he was nervous that Dean had changed his mind after all and fuck no, Dean wouldn’t have that, not at
“So,” Cas starts after a moment and Dean turns his head to look at him, the man’s face soft without the arousal there but no less handsome for it. “Does this mean we joined the Mile High Club?”
“I’m sorry, I-I didn’t bring anything,” he feels so
He moans a little breathlessly as he imagines Dean in his lap right now. Suddenly he’s not rolling his hips up into nothing, seeking pathetic friction against the inside of his own pants. No, he’s fucking slowly up into Dean’s willing body, the other man straddling him as he rides Cas’ hot and hard dick.
“Not a damn thing.”
“You’ve been a very good boy, Dean,” he says, takes a chance on upping the game a little and is instantly rewarded when Dean’s breathing hitches. “Let me take care of you instead.”
“Cas!” he moaned, watching with lust-blown eyes how the angel dug in his massive claws, tearing into the ground as he chased his high.
“Look, I had some shit to deal with, okay?”
,” Dean hissed and rolled out of bed as slowly and quietly as he could, as not to awake Cas.
“I could feel your eyes on me the second time,” he murmured. “I liked it.”
He brought it with him anyway, mainly because he was a waste-not kind of guy, and went to stand at the railing, looking down again. At least the people down below looked like they were having fun, in their exceedingly mundane activities. Most of them were dancing or drinking, which seemed on par for the club, and Castiel could see several cases where the dancing had developed to more intimate activities. He wondered absentmindedly if this was the kind of place where people fucked in the restrooms and hoped not, though Gabriel happily had divulged that there were condom machines in the men’s room.
Cas makes a little hiccupping sound and it’s all warning Dean gets before the Alpha closes the gap, kissing Dean deeply. He licks over Dean’s lips and hell yeah, he’s Omega enough to admit that he wants Cas sooner rather than later. The sound the Alpha makes when their tongues tangle together is nothing short of divine and Dean shifts so that he can spread his legs and make more room for Cas.
Dean took a moment longer to pull in a deep breath. Okay, he could do this. He’d done it at the bar, after all. He tried to summon some of that courage, but it was tough, considering how much he’d come to like Cas in such a short time.
“I bet I will be,” Dean mumbles, making Castiel ridiculously happy. “How do you wanna do this?”
(Because you know you’re an embarrassment right now)
Off to the left, Dean saw an archway that led into another room, that one also decorated in the same theme but better lit, from what he could see, and he assumed that’s where the auction was held, since he saw nothing of the like in here.
“Is what you said true?”
“And here?” he asked, trying and probably failing to sound casual. “What form were you living as here?”
“Hell no,” Dean snorts. “I just needed to…” he’s looking away when Castiel turns to him. “Collect myself.”
“O-okay,” Dean almost squeaks and Cas steps back, certain he’s crossed a line, or otherwise shown too much of himself for the boy to handle. Dean only stares at him, though, looking a bit dazed.
Balthazar seemed to positively itch to take notes and Castiel couldn’t blame him. For all of the joy Dean’s company brought Castiel, he couldn’t deny that he too felt an almost urgent need to document every new find about the little demon. That he’d changed the topic of his latest paper from general theological cryptids to involving almost nothing but demons were no surprise to him.
Dean pulls him right up to a black monstrosity of a car, turning them so that he can push Castiel up against the side of the car, body molding to Castiel’s increasingly interested one.
Cas had told Dean there were different kinds of angels and looking at how Cas acted, Dean was starting to suspect Cas was more of the observer kind, than the engaging kind as he’d first assumed considering how well he adapted to Dean’s presence. That was actually one of the reasons he’d thought to still live out in the forest, even after learning that Cas could look human, rather than force the angel to conform to human society.
“We’ll see,” Dean deflects, returning the hug.
“Out,” Dean says, looking anywhere but at Castiel.
“You’re all they’ve got, Dean,” Castiel says. He feels the hopeless anger bubble inside him, threatening to pour out. It’s a horrible feeling. It makes him hot and cold all over and sets his heart racing. When everything failed, at least it still came down to this. To the value of human lives, however few. And now, Dean wanted to wash his hands of that too.
“What are
Dean lunges after them, but Cas grabs him by the lapels and drags him in for a kiss. He can hear Sam and Charlie scrambling to get their equipment unhooked and safely away from them but honestly, Dean doesn’t care anymore.
“I got eight hours to kill,” Dean grinned. “We’ll do more than talk.”
It’s not particularly cold yet, considering it’s September, but the temperatures are hardly unbearable– until Castiel realizes that the man means the biological cycle. Then the scent hits Castiel. It’s not just the smoke. The underlying notes are damp and musky, not altogether unpleasant, but only just approaching enticing. The man shifts uncomfortably and Castiel tries to pretend he wasn’t sniffing. Castiel decides he’s not fond of this smell either.
“... Charlie?”
But Castiel is a coward.
“Of course.” Castiel waits for her to turn away from him and zips up the back of her dress. Her skin is pale and smooth beneath the grey dress, and a black bra strap cuts a sharp line beneath her shoulder blades. He’s done this for her before, of course, but it occurs to him that he’s never undressed her. He’s never seen her naked. He can’t remember if they ever even took their tops off in front of each other. He can’t remember if he ever even wanted to.
“Okay.” Castiel worms back down on the bed and rests his head on Dean’s shoulder. Dean sighs and settles against the pillows, arm curling around Castiel's shoulders, chin resting atop Castiel’s head.
It’s another entire twenty six hours before Dean returns. They haven’t lost any of their men, but haven’t managed to pick up any survivors either. The jeep is laden with boxes of supplies, appearing to be the spoils of a grocery store and a sporting goods store. Food and ammunition. The woman who had been arguing with Chuck accosts Dean almost the instant he steps out of the vehicle.
By the time Castiel finishes typing out the long-winded message, he’s not sure he should send it. What is he doing here? Accidentally impersonating someone and getting involved in a stranger’s personal affairs. Nothing good can come of this. Especially if it comes back to bite him in the ass, and Castiel knows that these things have a way of doing that. Besides, it’s not his place to offer advice like this. All he knows about this stranger is how he looked a decade ago in an embarrassing photograph, and about an hour’s worth of text messages.
“It wasn’t my intention to upset her.” Cas’ shoulders hunch defensively. “Anyway, Dean got me out of there. We got burgers. And we decided to room together. And I realized I’d found someone special that day.”
Castiel frowns. “You don't like wine? I was saving this bottle for my first paycheck.” He stops when he sees the car. “She’s yours?” he asks, giving the roof a reverent caress. “I’ve seen this car almost every day and wondered who she belongs to.”
Dean huffs in amusement.
The first thing Castiel notices upon waking is that the room feels uncomfortably hot. It also smells incredibly appealing. The third thing he realizes is that it’s Dean. Dean smells appealing. Castiel glances over to where Dean is lying stiffly on his side, arms crossed, frowning in his sleep. Dean's scent makes Castiel think of the texture of Dean’s skin. The rough warmth of his palm. When Castiel swallows, his throat feels dry. He blinks, trying to clear his mind, but it’s too late. The world has taken on the shimmer of a fever dream. Everything oozes in and out of focus in tandem with his breathing. His attention wanders and refocuses on Dean. He spreads his legs, brings his feet up to lie flat on the bed, knees spread and pointing to the ceiling. Imagination skidding in overheated overdrive, his body reacts, begging and keening for stimulation that never comes.
"Yes, Dean," Cas says, and Dean tries not to feel mollified by the fond exasperation in Cas' voice. He's not quite sure what to say, but then Cas reaches across the space between them and rests his hand on Dean's knee.
Dean tugs his feet out of Castiel’s grasp and shuffles to sit pressed against his side.
Despite the depressing train of thought on his mind, Castiel smiles. Seeing Dean talk so casually about meeting him sends a warm, fuzzy curl of happiness through him. He has wanted to meet Dean for some time now, but had no idea how to ask or suggest it. To know that Dean has not only felt that way, but also felt comfortable enough to make plans… it feels good. And it emboldens Castiel to reciprocate.
“Here?” Dean stares at the road, trying to affect an air of casual interest.
Risa looks at Castiel abruptly. With a grateful smile, she reaches out for his hands and he steps closer to let her hold them. “Thanks for checking on me, Castiel.”
Castiel sits up stiffly. He’d been slumped over a table in Bobby’s library. A huge, dry tome split down its spine lies open before him. There’s a pit in his stomach, but he insists, “I don’t eat.”
“Sure,” Mark winks in a manner uncannily like Dean. “Don’t tell Jane, she’ll throw a fit.”
Dean nods. “I say we nab it and get some answers.”
“You didn’t need to do this,” She spits. “What if you’d lost more men? This is supposed to be a safe place for us. We’re trying to survive here. You could risk giving us all away. You could get us all infected.”
Then Dean shakes himself because he’d find the staring kinda creepy, and heads onward to the kitchen.
Castiel is a bright sun at the center of this newfound life. It’s a relationship like Dean never knew it could be. Castiel is friend and confidant, but he’s also mentor and witness, and yeah, Dean has to admit, he is also a lover. They kiss and make love, but they also bicker and argue, and they fight and make up. Dean screws up, as expected, and for some dumb reason Castiel forgives him.
Cas gives him a funny look like he's sort of offended Dean doesn't think the cat is cute, but he says nothing.
Castiel shrugs. "With varying degrees of success. Human information on angels is riddled with falsities. Some were partly right. Path jumping, for instance. They didn't realize that angels simply flew. Some were wrong but entertaining. They believed I, and one of my brothers, Samael, could cause 'strife between a man and a woman'. There's no truth to that. We cannot be commanded by a spell. Samael could be convinced otherwise."
“Jesus, fucking, give a guy–!” Dean pants, when a Castiel breaks from the kiss.
Castiel scowls. “That is not true. You didn’t know I had a girlfriend of three years that I was about to–” he peters off when he sees Dean outside the glass door to his office.
“Sorry. Just work,” he lies.
Castiel stares at it for too long.
“Was the possessed body found with a gunshot wound to the head?”
He’s never been much of a texter, having always preferred calls. He only texts when he’s feeling particularly anti-social. So, for instance, he primarily communicates with Gabriel via text. The issue is that he wants to talk to Dean, and for the first time, texting is the only option that makes sense.
“Made you soup,” he says, by way of explanation. “Tomato rice. House rules.”
it take for us to have sex?” Cas interrupts.
“You wanna get married?” Dean asks, after a few moments of stunned silence.
“Yes.” Castiel hesitates. “Dean, I cheated.”
Dean raises an eyebrow, but if he smells the bullshit, he doesn't call it. He just picks up the menu and peruses it with a frown. Castiel follows suit, trying not to surreptitiously spy on Dean from behind his menu. The silence stretches, then grows awkward.
“Gimme that,” Dean says, grabbing the phone out of Castiel’s hand and pressing a button. Sam’s voice fills the car.
“Wait, what?” Dean’s face heats up. His heart hammers, and he panics. He can’t kiss Cas. “There’s gonna be kissing? I didn’t sign up for that. We’re roommates, it’s gonna be weird–”
“You’re not dying,” Dean says, grim and calm. “The bullet grazed your shoulder. It’s a little deep so I’m gonna stitch you up and we’ll hit the road.”
“Woah, wait,” Dean interrupts, alarmed. “You think that’s a good idea? You got enough juice to get by?”
“Cas?” Sam says, looking confused. A moment later he smiles. “I didn’t know you’d be here! I thought you were going back home.”
“I’ll meet you there,” Castiel says, preparing to leave.
Dean looks at him balefully as he sits down. “Yeah? What is it?”
Castiel sits back, stunned. He’s not sure what to make of it. From the looks of it, Dean’s struggling with the same thing.
Dean’s fingers tighten, constricting and damning. He lifts Castiel’s hand and presses his lips to the ruddy, bruised knuckles.
“Yes, and they have.”
There’s a few quiet moments where Dean just watches him, and Castiel takes his silence for agreement.
“That was different.”
They’re having dinner at Fatty’s, because no one thought to pick a better venue for Castiel’s graduation dinner.
Might be 3 years before I post again, so read up folks! I kid, I kid. I mean, I'll make every attempt to not take that long, but... no promises.
They wait expectantly for a few moments but there’s no reply. Castiel finds that he’s actually a little disappointed. Well, he laid that little mystery to rest. No point dwelling on it. Charlie engages him in conversation about work, and invites him to an evening of board games, and Castiel lets himself be distracted.
“I wouldn’t have asked you for assistance. You needn't worry.”
“It’s only just begun.” Castiel grabs Dean’s arm to stop him from pacing, and points to the floor. It’s one of the boys from the dorm, hanging onto life by a thread.
“I don’t have to do anything. Trust isn’t for traitors.”
Castiel doesn’t bother responding to that. It’s clear Dean feels guilty and he retaliates by lashing out to what he perceives is an attack. The conversation ends. They have slightly soggy chicken salad sandwiches and split a bag of chips for dinner.
After about thirty minutes, he groans. “Can you at least pretend to breathe or fidget a little or something? It’s gettin’ a little creepy with you playing a statue in the corner.”
Not for the first time, Dean feels terrible. Cas tried to find a sense of purpose for himself. And instead of letting him be, Dean went and dragged him through a hunt to rub his face in the misguided desolation of the rest of his kind.
“I brought you a sandwich anyway.”
“In a minute,” Sheriff Mills says, still annoyed. “Dean,” she continued, turning him around to face her. “I have to know. You quit working for Crowley, right?”
And we're back to our regularly scheduled programming! Sorry about the break; RL stuff, you know how it is. Shouldn't be long until we reach the end.
“You two should be more grateful to your matchmaker, you know,” Charlie babbles, even as Dean steers her by her shoulders out the door. “I could’ve minded my own business. My meddling helps! Or worse, I could’ve set you up with different people, and then where would you be? Dean, you know you owe me–!”
And just like that, the resistance melts away and Castiel relaxes. He stays.
Sheriff Mills rolls her eyes. Her voice softens as she cups his cheek and adds, “You don't have to do everything alone, alright? We’ve got you. Small town like this– we gotta have each other's back.”
The lanky man smiles. It’s endearing, and a little puerile. “Hey there. What can we do for ya?”
“Ancient Greek.”
“Um.” Dean draws back, scratching his cheek. He thinks back to the first time he met Cas. He’d been drunk and he’d been immediately interested in the broody, dark-haired hottie in the corner. He’d hit on Cas.
"I'm here because Dean is here," Cas says. That should've been fairly obvious, but now, he's not sure who he's reminding. "As for the Bible, I don't have it committed to memory anymore. I do still remember some parts of the Book of Enoch. And, to some extent certain Jewish magical texts like the Zohar, but only because they contained spells that involved me."
“My grace is depleted. At this point, I’m more human than angel. That means I lose consciousness, I bleed. I’m forgetting things.”
“Unintentionally,” Castiel defends, annoyed. “As an angel, I was never handicapped by such base instincts.”
Castiel suppresses the lick of irritation. “Fine. Why don’t I have a rut?”
“Was not telling me about Daphne a little sketchy? Probably, yeah.” Dean shrugs, then lifts an arm to wrap around Castiel’s shoulders. Castiel puts up a token resistance, because he doesn’t deserve to be comforted, but eventually he melts into Dean’s warmth.
But Castiel just huffs, amused. He meets Dean’s gaze steadily, and smiles. It transforms him, and steals Dean’s breath away.
Dean rolls his eyes.
“Cas, let go,” Dean says, voice tight and quiet. “Get in the jeep or back in your cabin. You can’t stop me.”
Dean was breathtaking.
“No, not Heaven.” Dean has the audacity to look impatient. “That’s actually kind of a good thing. Michael took himself out. Now all we have to worry about’s the Devil. We get the demons, if not this demon, to tell us how to cram Lucifer back in hell. Or wherever.”
“Drive around the back, we’re gonna load the stuff up. Understood?” Dean’s eyes are hard and unyielding. He’s irritated.
Maybe this isn’t a problem to Castiel. Maybe the guy has problems of his own. He's distracted. After all, he’s putting himself through school, about to graduate, and looking for jobs himself. Dean was stupid to think that this would even be a blip on the radar. Besides, Dean doesn't want to talk about it. He hates talking about things. That’s Sam’s bag.
Then he gives Castiel a small ziploc bag full of the stuff and shows him how to roll a joint.
“Hello, Sam, Charlie.” Cas hesitates. “Dean. Sorry, I'm late. I couldn’t find parking.”
Castiel takes a breath, and starts to explain.
Castiel waits outside. Dean returns in a few minutes, looking harried and twirling the room key. He grabs the files from the backseat and pushes open the trunk to snag the duffel stuffed into a corner.
Daphne raises her eyebrow. “Is that work?”
“What’s a rut?”
“I have faith in you,” Castiel says seriously, and if he means it in more ways than one, then it’s his prerogative.
“You guys know we’re still rolling, right?”
“Right,” Dean mutters, wiping a sweaty hand on his thigh as his heart pounds. “Anyway, well, that’s me. And,” he forces himself to look at Cas, who, of fucking course is looking back at him, wide-eyes and earnest. “We’re roommates.”
But he gets interrupted by a text.
Dean can’t help but smile again. “C’mon, you dork,” he murmurs, pressing a hand to the small of Castiel’s back and stepping through the door with him. Castiel rewards him with a grin.
There isn’t much to see. His office is sparse. He doesn’t care much for hanging up accolades or personalizing with pictures. He likes to keep his personal life separate from work. The less Zachariah knew about him, the better. The only thing in here that really belongs to him are the electric tea kettle and the expansive collection of different teas. He likes to brew some when he’s stressed or strung out. It helps him focus and decompress. Dean turns his nose up at it, but Castiel already knew that. Dean prefers coffee. He calls tea ‘soggy leaf water.’
“‘Night,” Dean says gratefully, eyes falling shut.
“Yes. We did. Daphne–”
Castiel rolls his eyes and sighs loudly in exaggerated exasperation. “It’s worth it,” he says, and clinks his bottle against Dean’s and winks. “You’re worth it.”
This evening, however, Dean is back in Castiel’s room before the meeting. He smells like earth and blood and rank sweat. It’s a weird cocktail of scents and strangely, it doesn’t repulse Castiel. Dean tosses a rattling plastic cylinder of pills at Castiel, and by some stroke of luck Castiel manages to catch it as it smacks his chest.
“I think so.” Castiel considers it for a few more moments, and nods. “Yes. I think I am.”
Dean nudges him with his foot. “Hey.”
Castiel shrugs. “Work, I suppose.”
“You got an address?” Dean asks.
“Consider those accounts balanced.” Dean’s touch is firmer now, fingertips tripping over the sensitive head, moving slow and easy. Testing the waters. He stops. “You could just say you don’t like it, you know.”
“Rude! So I guess you’re not getting lunch with me?” Charlie asks, looking between them.
She pulls him in for a hug, and Castiel holds her until she pulls away. He’ll miss her, he realizes. Her friendship, and her warmth. They spent five years of their lives together. She must’ve had hopes and dreams. She must’ve made plans, and yet. Castiel knows that he’d abandoned them for a long time now.
Castiel thinks for a moment and sends:
“Busy day?” Castiel asks, pawing through the phone chargers.
“No one,” Cas says firmly, and picks up the next card. “Have you ever caught me masturbating or having sex? What did you do?” For the first time since this started, Cas appears reluctant to meet Dean’s gaze.
“Fuck,” Dean mutters, rubbing circles along Castiel’s lower back as Castiel takes him deeper. “Cas, I’m so close babe–” he tapers off into a moan.
“I am exhausted,” Cas admits.
“And anyway,” Dean continues, “It’s a rite of passage. Fuck me over then die trying to make things right? Forgive me for fucking you over and then save my life? We had to break the cycle. Welcome to the family.”
“Friends and family get to abuse the employee discount,” Dean says, half-teasing.
(“You just, you know, you go with the flow, babe,” he’d murmured into Castiel’s neck, while being very distracting with his hands. “Don’t worry so much about whether I find it sexy. Focus on what you want, what turns you on. It’s easy.”
Dean loves him.
“For the hundredth time, I’m in a rut and I want some fucking privacy. I’m headed to a motel to take care of myself, not spread my legs for an archangel like some heat-hungry omega whore–“
They get a double room. There’s a sizable burn in the bedspread on Dean’s bed. There are dried and cracked bloodstains around the toilet seat in the bathroom. Paint peels away from the walls and the ceiling blooms with water stains. Dean gives it all a run through, locks and salts every window and door, and declares it suitable with an, “Eh. I’ve had worse.”
“Is it true that the alphas suffer the worst biological cycles?” Castiel asks, trying to change the subject. It’s not a very subtle effort. Dean takes it in his stride. Discomfort at the topic appears to be overruled by a grudging sense of responsibility.
“Yes.”
Cas looks uncomfortable, but not completely ready to leave, so Dean sighs and plays along.
“I hadn’t thought about that,” Castiel says, feeling blindsided.
He didn’t think he’d ever feel so torn– but he’s not. He’s distinctly happy. He’s fucking elated. All the other stuff, that’s life, and that’s bullshit, but he’s here. Dean is present in this moment where… he’s in love with a man who loves him back, and it’s something he never thought he’d have. But he does. And it’s fucking amazing.
“Do you want to come to my apartment after?” Castiel asks, squeezing Dean’s hand a few moments later. “I can help you look for jobs. Or help you update your resume. Or we can just relax. Whatever you need.”
Still, Castiel throws caution to the wind and taps send. Worst case scenario, the mystery texter loses his temper and decides to stop talking to him. Or maybe, since Castiel is supposed to want that, it’s the best case scenario?
“A demon is not going to know the way into Heaven. A reaper, perhaps…”
“I miss sleep," Cas says, sounding wistful. “At first, it was unsettling, but now I find the days too long. The night hours stretch unbearably. When I was human, I was advised to count sheep to help fall asleep. Have you tried that?”
The summer’s mellowed out, and a gentle breeze sets in around the early evening. The weather is perfect. They get a precious few days like this. And Dean’s stuck at the register, scanning batteries and milk for an elderly woman.
“It’s your turn,” Cas prompts, looking at him. Into him.
Last night had been perfect.
“I don’t know.” Dean elbows him and steps inside, tossing the duffel onto the nearest twin. He sets the files down a little more carefully on the small coffee table in the corner before slumping in the chair by it.
“Unlock the doors to Heaven. Reconnect with the Host.”
“Stop overthinking it, Cas,” Dean says gently. “No harm, no foul. You came clean. Daphne and I both know the whole story. She’s forgiven you, and even though there’s nothing to forgive, if you need it from me, you have it.”
“You’re Cas,” Dean repeats, more firmly.
“What was that about?”
“I don’t care what you want to call me or the ceremony to formalize it - or even if we decide not to do it. I just know that I want to be with you. If you’ll have me.”
Dean turns his back to the tower and starts walking to the station. “It’s the student center. The upper floors are a hotel.”
Castiel tries to stop himself, but he feels like he’s come this far, so why not? The wine pools warm and low in his belly, and maybe it plays a part in his nosiness. He asks,
"It's not your fault."
Cas reaches over the table to shove him playfully. “I did not. But,” he admits. “I was extremely uncomfortable. And Dean rescued me.”
“I didn’t save you,” Castiel says, but he’s weak. His lips press a kiss to the corner of Dean’s mouth and he closes his eyes. He tries to forget himself, everything extraneous. He thinks,
, and drives him. It barely adds five minutes to the drive back to the CVS, and as Dean hurries in, the clock ticks over to show he’s exactly two minutes late.
“Why doesn’t she want her son to learn how to defend himself?” Castiel asks.
“Dean. Are you alright?”
“Well, I can’t say this is unexpected,” Daphne sighs.
Sufficiently chastised, Dean nods. He’s still a huge jumble of embarrassment and gratitude. He can't bring himself to look at her. “Yes, Sheriff Mills.”
Castiel didn’t understand. Why couldn’t Dean Winchester believe?
And yet. Here he is.
It’s an easy decision. Castiel deletes the email.
When Castiel looks up, he sees that the impromptu foot rub has been cause for some embarrassment. Dean’s watching him, cheeks pink, lip caught under his teeth.
“And I’m telling you I got a job for you.” She socks him in the arm playfully, but Dean just shakes his head and scans her things.
“Where?” Castiel demands.
Dean thinks about it for a second. “Disappointing your family.”
The following morning, as Castiel watches, Dean tucks daggers into both boots. He holsters one gun around his thigh and tucks the other into the waistband of his jeans. Slings a rifle over his shoulder. Fills his pockets with spare rounds, extra ammunition, a pocketknife, and a flask of either holy water or liquor. It’s a sight to behold. Castiel feels a surge of exaltation for him.
It’s good. Life is good. Better than Dean expects it to be.
Castiel chews his lower lip. He taps out an apology and deletes it. He’s not sure what he’s trying to say, what he’s allowed to say. What wouldn’t be the wrong thing to say. This thing, whatever it is (or isn’t), is tenuous at best. A fragile line of communication born of chance, but Castiel clings to it because, for some reason, it makes him feel alive. Someone out there gets him. Understands him. And maybe it’s silly to think that way, but he needs it. The rest of his life is in limbo; on the cusp of a fork in the road that he can see ahead, but he’s not quite there yet.
“Thank you, Dean.”
By the time Dean finishes, a not-quite smile tugs the corners of the (former, Dean reminds himself) angel’s lips upwards. His bandaged arm lies forgotten in his lap. He slowly flicks through channels, always coming back to the damn infomercials.
As if sensing Castiel’s thoughts, Dean stops. Then he turns and picks up a rifle from the crate behind him and hands it to Castiel.
The cop nods, looking wary. “I hope it’s over.”
They clink glasses and swallow the liquor in unison. Cas exhales sharply, then clears his throat. His eyes are a little glazed, and his lips are shiny. He sips the small cup of pineapple juice slowly.
“That better not be contagious.”
“Get out.” Dean’s voice is quiet, but deadly.
“It’s not a bad idea. Runnin’ low on toilet paper, too. It’s a matter of civilization, son. Don’t wanna be wiping my ass with leaves if I can avoid it.” It’s Jack, the older hunter who’d made the suggestion about the generators. His voice is light, his smile easy. Some of the tension dissipates.
Dean’s smile is a blade and he cuts to the quick. Castiel erupts like blood, sluicing through slit veins, racing to meet Dean’s gravity. His fingers tighten their grip on Dean’s shirt, as if that will keep him here. As if that will help. It doesn’t. For a few, scintillating moments, Castiel soars. The come down is terrible, filled with the sickening agony of reality. Dean smiles and takes care of him. He brushes back sweaty strands of hair from Castiel’s brow and kisses the fevered skin.
“So– what now you don’t got a problem? You’re gonna do this?” Dean demands, anger simmering in his chest. He can’t just forget what happened. What he saw. Meg, all over Cas. Kissing him–
“… No. My wings burned up.” Probably, but there’s no use speculating.
To whom?
“I…” he starts, dry-mouthed. “It was alright.”
“I can’t help you. I don’t know anything, Dean. I’m forgetting things. I’ve lost my grace. My wings.”
“Well?” Dean spreads his hands open, palms facing upward.
“Bobby left yesterday to try and track him down. He hasn’t been answering his phone–“
Honestly, Dean doesn’t give a shit. He’ll happily fork over the day’s pay if it means he gets to have this dinner. He sends off a quick text thanking her, and turns his phone off.
(Sam’s landed a summer  internship that turned into a cushy part-time gig that pays pretty decently. He’s still got Cas’ old TA job, so that’s taken care of his tuition. Kevin and Charlie will still be his roommates, so he’s not saddled with rent and expenses he can’t handle. Besides, at an overgrown twenty-four, it’s time for Sam to fly the nest.)
The joke doesn't land.
Dean exhales sharply and wipes his mouth. “Okay. Working theory. It’s one demon hopping bodies– but why? It makes no sense. Unless it’s a swarm of demons. And someone’s walking around with the Colt icing them? It seems unlikely, but– hey. Can you get the bullet out of his head?”
Castiel frowns. “Why?”
Castiel doesn’t bother arguing. They’ve spent the better part of the day trawling through the bodies of the dead kids. Castiel has seen worse, but somehow this unsettles him. He can’t see the faces of the demons. He can’t catch traces of their foul effusions. No sulfur. Nothing.
There’s about thirty seconds of dead air before Dean raps his fingers on the table to get Cas’ attention. “Cas, hey. Don't hurt yourself. Just take a drink.”
“No, it’s not that,” Castiel stammers. “It’s just late, and I figured you were probably tired and wanted to go to bed.”
He hates Dean, Castiel realizes with a roiling, sickening anger. It has to be hate because the alternative is unthinkable. Unfathomable.
“Dean,” Castiel says with a hard swallow that clicks in his throat. “I should give you some privacy.”
“Can I call you?” Cas asks and he sounds far too meek and uncertain for Dean’s liking.
“How was– are you okay?” Castiel asks, switching tracks mid-question.
“Okay,” Castiel sighs. “I think I found a lead.”
Dean passes him a mug and nudges the milk and sugar towards Castiel. He pretends not to pay attention as Castiel dumps heaped spoon after spoon… after spoon in his coffee. Dean likes his coffee black, but knowing how Castiel takes his makes him smile. They lean against the counter and wait until it’s cooled enough to drink.
Castiel suppresses a sigh and obeys. “What is the plan here, Dean?”
“Things have been a little hectic.”
There’s a moment when Castiel resolve crumbles. Dean sends him a picture late on Christmas Eve.
“Where are you?” Castiel demands, pacing beside the railway tracks.
The next day, Dean gets fired from the Coffee Grind.
Dean shakes his head, and for once swallows before he replies. “No– well, sorta. A few reasons. It was more to get some intel in general. Try to figure out what's new, where the Colt is, blah blah.”
With a little encouraging, Castiel narrates one of the case studies. The glass of wine he’d been nursing mellows him out a little, and Castiel ends up having a pleasant, long conversation well past the time he normally goes to bed. Talking to his mystery texter is refreshing. Fun. Maybe because he’s a stranger, and Castiel doesn’t feel the need to… be.
“But, Cas. I was some stranger out there that you knew nothing about. It’s understandable you didn’t wanna spill the beans to me right off the bat. And anyway, I kinda knew something was up.”
Dean freezes, but he also catches the way Singer stiffens in surprise. How long had she been here?
Sam’s jaw clicks shut and he casts one last imploring glance at Dean before he leaves.
That does it.
A loud thud shakes the table. The book is on the floor, a few leaves sticking out strangely.
“Outside one of the dorms– Gilbert Hall.”
Castiel shuts the door behind him, and moves to stare out the window. “I’ll keep watch.”
“What?”
“I’d like that,” Cas says warmly. He looks so goddamn pleased that Dean’s heart swells in affection. There’s no way Dean’s ruining that by thinking with his dick.
If Dean thought he was blushing before, the next card makes his face practically combust.
“These are biased against me,” Dean protests, already reaching for the whiskey before remembering he could’ve just lied. He could’ve just said no. Fucking hell. And now it’s on camera. And who the fuck knows is gonna see it, and–
Predictably Dean buried his face in Castiel’s chest, his shoulders shaking in silent laughter. “Cas, come on–”
Cas just looks back at him. He’s angry and Dean feels a little funny about that. Sort of torn between amused and apologetic. He can tell because it’s such a cold anger. Dean’s seen the angel’s eyes burn with irritation, with purposeful rage, with the wrath of god, capital w, capital g. That had been a controlled, coruscating, beautiful sight. That had been a warrior’s exultation. This was private. This was personal. And it’s not just anger, it’s hurt, too. It’s a deeply human, personal sort of hurt. It’s coming off Cas in waves, the questions he wants to know the answers to:
“No,” he decides. “It’s a stranger, and it was clearly an accident.”
“I’m sorry, Cas, I can’t resist. You two are so adorable together,” she says.
Fuck, he looks like a wet dream. Cas blushes some more, and Dean realizes he said that out loud.
Sam stirs awake and says, “The couch is a fold-out, Cas. You should stay.”
His eyes are black.
Dean takes a breath and sets the plate down. His hands shake. He looks like he’s debating storming out of the room.
“Cas?” Dean nips at his inner thigh, sharp enough to sting, and soothes it with a wet kiss. “I’m fuckin’ serious, babe.”
“Get. Out.”
Dean would know what to do. Dean, sitting in his lap, looking down at him, rending clothes that catch at his beautiful broad shoulders like wings. Dean, whose flesh he remade, whose bones he carved into, whose soul he saved. Dean, he realizes with the first cold douses of reality, whose heart was broken and lost to grief. Dean, whose mind was a burning house of mirrors, shattered and weaponized, and with no more room for anything as simple as affection. Or as grand as longing.
Bobby goes visibly pale. “Thought his name was Sam.”
Dean staunchly refuses to think about it.
Castiel has a peculiar way of talking, like he’s not used to going so long in front of a willing audience. And he’s awkward. Sometimes he’s serious and bashful, and other times, he has a totally offbeat sense of humor and is adorably nerdy. Halfway through the first year since Castiel moved here, Dean starts to admit to himself that he has a crush.
Dean already knows all this. It sounds like something Cas would say on a blind date. Except, this isn’t that. It’s not a date. They would never be on a date. Despite that, and despite the fact that they’re fighting, he nods. It's just like Cas. Perfect. Nerdy. Fucking adorable.
And now, Dean’s likely fucked it all up, and chased Castiel out of his own bed. He
For a moment, Dean’s not sure how to react. He’d braced himself for a useless platitude. For Castiel to comfort and reassure him without knowing if things would really be alright.
Dean forces himself to shove the dread and disappointment bubbling up inside him. “That’s– fuck, that’s awesome, Cas! Congratulations!”
Sam makes a strangled noise. “That can happen?”
“Hey.”
“Black eyes,” Dean gasps. He whips his head back to see the cop climb in through the shattered window. “They’re all possessed.
“Uh,” Dean starts stupidly. How were they gonna answer that one? Right now Cas probably hated him.
Castiel smiles, rubbing the sleep from his eyes with a content sigh. He never expected to hear from Dean again after the misunderstanding had been cleared up, but somehow, they kept talking. The weeks pass by with aimless conversation, and if more than a few hours pass in silence, Castiel misses his phone like a phantom limb.
“Happy Thanksgiving, man,” Dean smiles. “Looks like it’s gonna be an interesting party.”
Sam clears his throat. “Look, guys. We need to work together on this–”
“Heya Sheriff,” Deans smiles.
Cas grins, and Dean realizes he’s a little tipsy. The grin turns into a chuckle and Dean finds himself smiling as well. He knows exactly what Cas is remembering.
Castiel shakes his head in amusement before he remembers Dean can’t see him. He stops smiling.
“You need a haircut,” Dean says, voice echoing and floating. He runs a hand through Castiel’s hair. Then he’s gone.
“I wanted to see you,” Castiel says simply. Just like that. So sincere and open, like it’s no big deal. The meaning is plain.
(See the end of the chapter for
He absently grabs Dean’s ankle, and when Dean tries to pull his leg back, he tightens his grip and rearranges them so they’re both comfortable. Then he pushes his thumb into the sole and starts rubbing. Dean rarely lets himself be pampered. It’s a little annoying.
Dean’s pretty sure he’s too red to blame it on the heat or the drinking.
“Fine,” Dean grumbles, pulling the plate closer to himself. “More for me.” He cuts through the short stack quickly, drenching it with a truly obscene amount of syrup.
"This was my choice," Castiel says slowly, mulling the words over. "I chose to rebel."
“Can you fly?”
“Of course not.”
For a moment, Dean panics. He knows this is personal. He knows Crowley’s had it out for him. He knows that trading shifts with Meg had pissed Crowley off, but it went beyond that. This is what Dean for getting too drunk at the unofficial work Christmas party (they’d all piled into Molly’s and split the tab) and (allegedly) making out with the boss. He’d gone and pissed Crowley off, and honestly, the smarmy bastard had just been waiting for the opportunity. The only reason Dean hasn’t given notice here is because he’s waiting for Singer Auto to give him a start date.
That’s… a very attractive young man. About a decade too young for him. It must be an old picture, he thinks, because the haircut and the necklace date it. Very attractive, though. His gaze lingers at the nipple before being led down by the arm to the crotch. His face grows warm, and he realizes he’s actually licking his lips.
Sleeping is still generally disorienting, and Castiel struggles to remember the sequence of events that lead up to it. Or even how he eventually manages to sleep. Or where he is and what he was doing when he wakes up. As a result, the past month has been taxing. Dean grumbles that he has no cycle, and that it’s frustrating because Castiel tends to fall asleep when he’s exhausted, instead of every night like a normal person. Which means he’s asleep at the most inopportune times.
“You don’t have to, Cas,” Dean manages a few moments later. “Listen, you ever need anything, a place to crash or whatever, just call, okay?” Considering what Castiel has done for Sam, it’s the least Dean can do. And honestly, it’s not even just about that. Castiel is a genuinely nice guy, who’s clearly alone, and a little off-beat. He’s been dealt a bad hand. Dean wants to help him because he likes Castiel. And, he gets the feeling that Castiel is quite deserving. He deserves all the good things.
(Which was the only reason Castiel forgave the merciless teasing. That, and he knew it wasn’t malicious. Dean’s laughter was a defense when he felt too vulnerable. Besides, Dean tended to make some convincing reparations with his mouth.)
Castiel feels something primal in him rear its head. He doesn’t recognize the sound he makes. Whatever it does to the expression on his face must be good, because Dean’s cheeks get pinker and his lips fall open, and he wants it so badly– he wants Castiel back.
“Alright, then.”
Castiel can’t tell if Dean is taking the news well or not. It’s disconcerting. There was so much he thought he knew about Dean, and he does, but there is so much that is new to him as well. This is nothing like swapping texts. It’s so much more, and at the same time, it’s a lot less.
Castiel doesn’t bother dignifying that with a response.
“Where are you, Cas?” Dean asks, wiping his hands. The accusation is gentle. “Where were you?”
“Oh.” The way Daphne says it is hollow. Empty.
“Ya think I don’t know that?” Bobby picks up the book and starts assessing the damage. “I’m answering the calls from hunters that are dying out there. Stopping you and your idjit brother from running after archangels. I get it. Quit whining.”
“Listen, sweetheart,” Dean starts with a tired grimace of a smile. It doesn’t look pleasant. He’s caked in dirt and blood. One of the men cracks open a beer and offers it to Dean.
Of course Castiel knew. He could see the destruction Dean had wreaked laid out all around them. The lashes still hung from Dean’s bloody hands. And Castiel had been foolish to believe that words that were a herald from heaven, bellowed with all the confidence of an angel of the Lord, would offer comfort:
Sometimes, Castiel has to get away from it. The restlessness in the house reeks. It makes his skin crawl. He takes Bobby’s books down to the panic room and reads by the lamplight.
“Uh, yeah.” Dean looks down at himself, then at the wall behind Castiel. Anywhere but at Castiel. He doesn’t know how to ask the question. He didn’t know which question to ask.
Castiel doesn’t want to do it, but he feels that Charlie really is trying to help him. It was, after all, in an odd way, because of her that he ever spoke to Dean. Charlie punches the air in joy. “Awesome! I’m... pretty sure this is gonna work.”
Castiel’s preoccupied by Dean’s fingers. And the new information he’s learned. “You work here?”
“I dunno. Go fuck himself. Go – and say yes to Lucifer. What does it matter anymore?”
“So,” he says, chewing away stickily at a huge bite. “Girl living in the apartment behind the motel was a student at the university here. No family or friends here, but kids from her classes know her. She had two weeks left on her lease when she snapped and went on a murder spree. The ones that survived said they saw her eyes turn black, smelled sulfur, the works.”
They’re all shitty friends. Castiel deserves better. Actually, Dean’s pretty sure this is his job. They haven’t sat down and talked about it in any certain terms, but he doesn’t think Castiel is the kind who’s in it for some friends with casual non-penetrative sex deal. So, Dean’s almost ninety-five percent sure he’s Castiel’s boyfriend. And so planning this dinner was his job.
“I know,” Dean says, impatient for the first time. He crawls up the bed, ignoring its protests and collapses beside Castiel. “I know,” he repeats, and for the first time he sounds tired. He sighs and shifts around again to pull Castiel closer. “We’ll fix it. We’ll figure it out. We always do. And you need to make it until then.”
love. He crawls with the curs in the weeds.
Dean is the one that breaks.
“I didn’t mean it like–“
Castiel struggles to sit up. “I’m fine.”
Dean grins at him. “Engineering. Well… R&D. Right next door to IT. Hence, you know. Charlie.”
“You wanna try?” he asks, nudging the plate of biscuits closer to Castiel.
“How long?” Charlie pipes up. Dean jumps. He’d… forgotten she and Sam were still there.
Castiel sighs and copies the movement. Something in his shoulder pops audibly. His back arches and he pushes higher before relaxing with a sigh. Dean was right.
“I made a promise,” Cas says calmly. “I’m here to help my friends. I’m willing to be civil for their sake. Aren’t you?”
Finally, Dean looks up. “They’re overwhelmed. Give it a few minutes.” He chews on his lower lip as he circles the boy. “Look. Shot in the head. No sign of sulfur, though. Can you tell if he was possessed?”
Dean mutters something that sounds suspiciously like ‘waste of time’ under his breath but he exhales and agrees.
“Yeah, I got that.” This time the laugh shakes Dean’s shoulders. “How much has it added up to? Like five bucks? I’m worth five bucks? You flatter me, Cas.” Honestly, he can’t remember the last time he felt so good. Just a plain, openly good, happy giddiness. No smoke and mirrors seduction, no games, no pretenses.
Castiel goes to stand by the car. If he can’t leave, he won’t be forced to listen to unnecessary conversation. Dean ducks out a few moments later, eyeing Castiel warily, but he doesn’t say anything. He slides in behind the driver’s seat.
Four days later, Castiel is finishing breakfast in front of the TV when his phone goes off. The texts come in rapid fire, and Castiel doesn’t have to look to know exactly who’s texting him. No one else texts him like that.
“Nope.” Dean ruffles her hair. “Go on, you heard the guy. Get.”
Dean’s pretty sure he’s not pronouncing
“Or at least– just do this as a favor. For me, please,” Charlie pleads, looking so desperate that Castiel wavers. “If it sucks, I promise you can leave. I’ll send you a safety text and call with an excuse to give you an out and everything. Please, please, please–”
“Okay, moving on.” Dean drums his fingers on the table, and huffs incredulously when he reads the next card before tossing it aside. “What’s something you’d want to change about me? There’s probably a list for this right on the fridge next to the grocery list and the cleaning schedule.”
He groans and puts his head in his hands.
“Dean.” Cas’ voice is firm. Grounding. “Pour me a shot, too.”
It’s Jane, bearing a plate of food. It has cooled considerably, so the smell of it doesn’t assault Castiel. Still, he tips some of the tablets into his hand and throws them back. Jane sets the plate on his nightstand. It’s toast slathered with peanut butter. Chunky peanut butter. He’s not fond of chunks.
“Why didn't you just come to me?” she asks, brows pinched in concern. “I told you I had a job for you.”
“Annabel,” Chuck supplies helpfully.
“No, you stay. I never really liked this place,” she smiles. “Exit stage Daphne.”
“It doesn’t matter,” Cas sighs, shoulders sloping further and he looks so tired.
“The Angels are gone,” Castiel says bluntly. He feels a little dizzy, so he sits on the edge of the bed. His feet feel like they’re made of lead.
Dean parks beside the lawn and gets out of the car. He gets down on his haunches to study the body.
“Dead ends never stopped us before,” Dean says, swallowing the knot of disappointment. It rolls against the spittle, threatening to choke, bruising harder than rock, tasting like bile. “We’ll get the son of a bitch one way or another. Thanks, Cas.”
No. Fuck it. He’s head over heels. All he gets is small glimpses, but he knows enough to have caught a bad case of the feelings. He’s seen Castiel at his best, clean-shaven, dressed in a suit that’s just a little too big for him, looking mouth-wateringly good.
“Dean?”
Nothing happens. When he opens his eyes, Dean seems frozen. He hasn’t really reacted.
The email sits in Castiel’s phone for a week, burning a hole through his pocket.
“Case in point.” )
"I'm sorry," Chuck says, sitting down beside him.
“Something’s wrong.”
“Incredible,” Sam mutters in disbelief. “Fine, whatever.”
“What, like someone I’m related to? Dad had this other kid we never knew about, but he’s dead.” Dean lets out a short laugh that sounds wounded and flat. “Like everyone else in this godforsaken family.”
“I mean,” Dean looks down, fidgeting with the napkin in his lap. “This is all probably super awkward. You don’t want to be here–”
Castiel frowns, troubled by how self-deprecating his mystery texter sounds now.
It’s obvious. “Possession.”
“Your case and Sam’s may well be related, but I think we can rule out a connection to Heaven.”
It’s as Dean is walking back across an empty parking lot that Castiel is struck by the beauty of him. What remains of the soul is a mere kernel of his original brilliance. Everything else is fogged in black. Not that Castiel can see. He can’t really see it anymore. He lost that ability. That loss, however, has brought Castiel a new sight. A sight he’d never truly considered.
“This your angel warding?” he asks, thumb brushing skin as he traces the Enochian letters. “’S kinda hot.” Castiel can hear the smile in his voice.
“I have been praying. I’ve been saying yes. Doesn’t look like anyone’s answering the phone.”
By the time Castiel is ready to leave for the day, he’s worked eleven hours. He turns his phone on as he walks to his car, squinting as it starts to light up with notifications.
“Tsk, wrong answer. You should take the money and split it with me.”
A resounding slap cracks through the air. Sam hobbles back, clutching his cheek. Dean stands before him, hand still half raised, breathing hard.
Time slows to a crawl as Dean tries to process what he’s just heard. Cas loves him.
“So, uh,” Dean says, shoving his hands in his pocket, and looking around. “This is where. You, uh…”
“Awesome.” Dean slides the usual form over with a pen, and finishes making the bill while the man fills it out. A few moments later Dean trades the receipt for the form. He takes not of the name surreptitiously as he types in the information.
Dean spends a few minutes in the parking lot, weighing his options. He could go upstairs and fall into Castiel’s waiting arms. Watch a movie, be comforted. Or he can cross the street, march into Auto Singer and demand an answer. He drums his fingers on the steering wheel, nervous, and then decides. Fuck it.
“What is it?” Castiel asks.
The pictures don’t do Dean justice. Even now, his handsome face pinched with irritation as he thumbs through his phone, he’s gorgeous. He looks up, and Castiel freezes in place. There’s surprise, and then a flicker of… recognition? but it quickly turns to embarrassment. And then Dean’s expression shutters. He takes in the tan trench coat Castiel told Charlie he would wear, and puts his phone away.
It’s strange that he doesn’t remember meeting his girlfriend, right?
They return to chaos at the camp. Despite that, It doesn’t take long for them to fall back into routine. Like Chuck, most people were simply happy to have them back.
Right now, Castiel simply has no idea what to do. The only reason he follows Dean instead of going off on his own to explore other avenues is because he has always had orders to follow, even if they were as vague and nebulous as the Righteous Man affirming, “We’ll figure this out.”
“I’m nothing,” Dean says with so much venom that his voice shakes. Tears well in his eyes but don't fall. “I had one job. I had to protect one kid and I couldn’t do it. What makes you think I can protect these people?”
Dean frowns, rubbing his forehead. He settles on his haunches in front of the corpse, studying it. “It’s the kid… who shot that girl. The first possession. It’s him.”
Castiel bites his lip, nervous. Dean has stopped whistling. In fact, all Castiel can hear is the gentle hum of the dishwasher if he strains.
“Yeahhh!!!” Dean crowed, slapping the both of them on the back.
“Plus, I don’t even have
“Cas, I, uhm,” Dean mumbled, touching their foreheads together, “I never want to lose you again.”
“Well,” he said, turning back to the matter at hand, “

with as much force as he could silently muster.
There had been other times, of course, that Cas had been missing. Dead, even. But this time, with the whole Chuck thing over and done with...he had the feeling, deep in his bones, that this was a true Ending.
Oh shit. He and Gus still had nothing to show for all of their thinking. Time to improvise.
Sam sighed. “Dean-”

Just not one quite as…passionate as Sam.
He looked Dean in the eyes.
Not sure if i’m exactly perfectly happy with it, but done is better than perfect! Despite how much it absolutely VEXED me, and how long it took me, and how much writers block I had to fight off with a stick, i still had a lot of fun writing all of these scenes. Especially the scenes with Shawn and Gus, a duo that I have grown to absolutely adore. I started writing this when I was barely on season 1 of Psych, and now I’m on season 4, wherein this fic takes place. I am headcanoning it to take place not too long after the fake demonic possession episode.
But man, he must be getting soft in his old age, because once the angel was touching him, he didn’t want him to...stop...touching him. He simply did not have the strength to pull away.

All he could find, after hours of searching, was that the Empty COULD be summoned, but he could not, for the life of him, figure out

But, he reconsidered, the damage was already done the moment he sat down in this flimsy little chair--hell, the moment Cas had taken his
“Now, can you explain what’s going on with your...top secret project?” she asked.
Cas reached up and smoothed Dean’s eyebrow, dragging his thumb down his skin to rest just under his cheekbone.
Dean forced himself to relax, and give Cas a quick thumbs-up.
“Good riddance,” it said, and its gooey hand reached out once more, enveloping them in blackness.

The Empty surveyed the earth objects littering its dimension, and grimaced.
And that’s how he suddenly realized that he was, in fact, about two and a half seconds away from
Dean winced.
Gus huffed quietly, but he did cave, just like Shawn knew he would. With an exaggerated eyeroll, he leaned forward and daintily lifted the photograph so Shawn could see the information sheet underneath.
Dean squinted into the distance. He could just barely make out a little square of artificial light and the fuzzy, muffled noise of a low-quality motel TV.
“I can assure you,” Castiel replied, far more calm than he had any right to be, “I had
Cas blinked. “I-If you’ll have me.”
When he looked up, he noticed that the creepy symbol was
“Yeah, I see it,” Dean sighed, as Sam knelt down to examine the shoe prints.
Dean held onto Cas for dear life as they flew between dimensions, covered in the inky darkness of the Empty, until they crashed on the bunker floor with a SPLORCH.
“Yeah?” Dean said, dropping his hand as he turned.
Dean finds himself in the Empty, and things go...a different way than he expected, as he learns something new about being a human. And Cas...Cas finally learns something about Dean.

“Can I...help you, gentlemen?” asked the receptionist.
“Close your eyes,” Shawn commanded, clamping one hand on top of her head, “And I will divine the scene from your memories.”
“Well," Dean said, clapping him on the back, "Lucky you ran into us, ain't it?"
“Give me one week,” Castiel said, “That is all I ask. Then I will come to Heaven, and assist you in the negotiations.”
Cas’ face lit up with joy.
“Jack!” he called, letting go of Dean to give his son a hug.
Dean softened. Even as a literal God, that kid could still shatter his heart with his sincerity.
“Sam?” Dean said, voice strained, “Would you please, uhm...give us a moment?”
“Wow,” she remarked, “What’d I miss?”

Just his luck, it was Darren. The ghostly man of the hour himself, looking very much alive, if a bit nervous. And tired, considering the bags under his eyes.

“I’ve been attuning my microflora to my surroundings since the fourth grade, Shawn,” Gus said, “And you know how?”
Dean looked to Cas, opened his mouth, and promptly burst into tears.
“Your memories have put me off my Jamba Juice,” Shawn announced, handing the bowl off to Gus, "Oh, the heavy cost of my psychic gift."
“Jack!!” Dean and Sam exclaimed.
“Hey, it worked, alright?!” Dean said gruffly, “Get off my case!”
“Man,” he said, turning back to the Empty, “You should’ve thought twice before taking

Gus lifted up the photograph a little bit more.
The Empty looked at them both with a dead-eyed stare.

Jack closed the hole in his skin with a wave, and sighed.
“I...climbed in through the window,” he said in a deep, rumbling, gravelly voice, as if every word pained him, “Like a human.”
“The...other part, of my newfound power,” Jack said, “Is that interfering purposefully with the contents of the Empty, especially to interfere with a Deal made on my behalf, would be considered a ‘bad move’, and probably an ‘act of war’.”
He snapped his fingers with excitement.
“It just makes sense, you need Intent,” Sam said, “And, out of the two of us? Your intent on Cas is the strongest.”
Cas said nothing, he just lifted his hand and knocked the blanket off of Dean’s upper body.
“See you soon,” waved Cas, and Jack was gone.

Dean held up three fingers to Cas as they walked out of the Bait ‘n Tackle--or more accurately, out of the hunter shop that used Bait ‘n Tackle as a front--and slotted neatly into the flow of downtown foot traffic.
“What do you mean, ‘that’s it’? All this time, we’ve been treating Heaven, Hell, Purgatory,
He picked up one shoe, and grimaced at the yellow mess lining the bottom.
It clenched a fist, and Dean’s ribs suddenly felt like they were caving in.
Shawn squeaked, “Or, uhm. I could divine them out of your head.

A brown, old, treasure map suddenly appeared in his other hand, complete with a YOU ARE HERE, a dashed line to follow, and a big X marked with the word CASTIEL.

“Not much,” Sam said, sitting back in the chair, “Mostly stuff we already know. But I did find out that it can’t interfere with creation unless it is summoned in some way, and that it is, and I quote here, ‘hostile to human life.’”
He froze. His entire body, clothes and all, was covered in little golden specks of

They both burst through the door at the same time, absolutely ruining the quiet of the lobby and turning every head in their direction.
“Now talk to me, man,” Sam said, sitting down himself. “The library’s a mess, and the kitchen’s not much better. What the hell were you doing?”
Eileen’s eyebrows shot up. “You can do that?”
Dean’s heart melted at the earnestness of it all, and he turned to face Cas.
“I’ve seen you around each other before,” Eileen shrugged, “It’s...it’s kind of a lot to witness.”

something, Gus, where’s it coming from?” Shawn asked excitedly.
“Enjoying the show?” he asked, pulling away.
Dean slowly, painstakingly, unstuck his face from the kitchen table, groaning all the while. The single working bulb in the kitchen was way too bright, and there was a full construction crew pounding jackhammers inside of his skull.
“Oh! Right, I’ve been dying to tell you—we had a visit from

There was an awkward pause, in which the FBI agents looked suitably unimpressed. Understandable, but still a little disheartening.
“I’m glad you’re here,” he said loudly, leading them further in, “I was getting worried that the Federal Bureau of Investigation wasn’t getting my calls. Or my texts. Or my notes, that said ‘do you like me, check yes or no-’”
But normality didn’t have to be the absence of everything hunter-related. The part that Dean really wished for, when he thought of having a normal life, was more of a feeling. A feeling of love, and care, and

“Yeah, it’s a side effect of not repressing your emotions for once,” Sam said with a little chuckle, “And also probably the hangover.”
But then it stopped, as if blown out by an unseen force.
It screamed in pain.
Dean was still trying to blink his way back to a coherent thought, which was stymied by the fact that Cas’ hand was still

“No, I mean...we’re
