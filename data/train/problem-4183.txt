Ignoring the rising panic inside, Cas tried to keep his tone flat, unrevealing. “Really? I didn’t see him there. I went to return a book I borrowed for school.” He added, hoping without much hope that Jim would buy it and he could leave.
“Are you sure you want to do this?” Cas murmurs, squeezing back.
Latecomers were crowding the back of the church, willing to stand, it seemed, so that they might hear Jim’s sermon. Before Thursday, Dean had never understood how one person could illicit such adoration. Now he empathised ruefully with the pure happiness radiating from many of the faces. He was no better, enthralled with thoughts of Castiel.
pronounced. Though let’s not give your stupidity all the credit: I am a
bar. S’all the same after a while,” Dean looks around, taking in the sickly shifting interior and accepts it with a small shrug. “Guesss this must be all of ‘em. Maybe I’m in heaven?” He laughs again until it turns into a hiccup, hands slipping further and further down the pool cue.
He was so wrapped up in gloomy possibility that he barely noticed where he was until he walked into the library door. It was locked. He frowned: Missouri never closed early. He knocked softly, and heard quick footsteps. A second later the door was wrenched open and he was pulled into a tight hug.
“That isn’t true,” Dean grits out from his position on the ground.
“The window,” Sam says instead of reacting to that statement the way he wants to, which would involve a lot of loud swearing and hand gestures that would attract too much attention to be worth risking right now. “Let’s try the window.”
“Yes, you folks are good, the best around,” his face fell suddenly. “But let me tell you, folks like you are a rarity these days.”  The crowd shifted at that, Jim noticed the restlessness. “We’ll get to that later folks, for now let us pray...”
It’s only when he’s finished talking that he realises Dean is breathing very fast – faster than sitting behind the wheel of a car warrants. He’s staring ahead, tears streaming down his unfocused eyes, his hands gripping the wheel so tightly that the car has begun to veer from side to side as his whole body shakes.
Another, older boy sat at the table – Dean. He turned as they entered and Castiel recognised the boy who’d been staring at him in church that morning. He had been too far away for Castiel to make out anything but his vibrant green eyes. They were greener than anything else he had seen in a long time. Everything here, even the plants was either dusty or faded, and Castiel felt his mood lift at the sight of colour. He felt like Dorothy in the Wizard of Oz. Dean smiled at them as they entered, but didn’t rise.
(THE LYRICS ARE ABSOLOUTELY, DEFINITELY NOT RELEVANT TO ANYTHING OR ANYONE THO)
“Purgatory?” Cas can’t keep the surprise from his voice.
“Yeah probably. And less magical action replay,” he scowls. “Fucking witches.”
“I don’t know. He never said.”
Cas kissed him again. “I’d be delighted.”
Alistair narrows his eyes slightly. “Touching,” he murmurs. “But you’re a tad early, Angel. Not in the script quite yet.” He flicks his wrist and Cas lurches into the air, careening through the flames and into a knot of chains, which instantly coil around him like metal snakes – binding his hands behind his back as his angel blade clatters to the ground.
“I didn’t know. I didn’t know it was real. If I’d known I could’ve…” Cas swallows.
“What about Dean?”  Sam wanted to know.
Wordlessly, Cas embraces him: holding him upright until the worst of the shaking has subsided. Then, he eases Dean gently back onto his feet, guiding him back towards the impala. There isn’t really a question of who can drive – so he deposits Dean on the right hand side before sliding gingerly behind the wheel. “Be gentle with me, and with him,” he murmurs, running his hand along the dashboard like he’s seen Dean do. It’s probably his imagination, but the car seems to rumble something in response.
There’s the unmistakeable sound of a hand slapping against skin (Sam doesn’t want to think which skin), followed by a low laugh that has Sam spinning, involuntarily, to gape at the large, tanned and bearded man currently dragging his hand over Dean’s thigh. The two men stare at each other with unconcealed lust in their eyes. “Hmmm…you
He was stuck with the truth now, no matter how shitty.
They’d been laughing about, something, when Hael had come over. she’d done that sometimes, seemingly incapable of living her own life.
That couldn’t happen, of course.
have a son like you. As long as you’re alive you will be my son – no matter what fag name you decide to go by – and I cannot afford to have a son that is anything but my own image. If I cannot have that son I will create that son or I will have no son.”  He released Castiel, turning away. “Now take him: don’t bring him back until he knows what’s right.”
“What do you want?” Dean interrupts him before he can start – his voice sharp, slightly desperate.
“What do you mean?”
told myself, I couldn’t really see you as an abomination or a demon or anything. And part of it was Pastor Novak: he kept going further and further off the rails. Screaming every week about this sin or that transgression. And he was getting so big too: in all the papers, radios, even TV broadcasts”
“Do I look like a twelve year old girl to you? Is this a sleepover? We gonna eat pizza and give each other makeovers while I tell you all about my new boyfriend?” He stutters slightly on the last word – Sam decides to ignore it.
“Did she?”
Cas bites back the
“Yeah.”
Heading downstairs, the dirt of the last few days scrubbed off, he paused at Sam’s room. He hadn’t been inside since John had found out about him and Cas, what felt like an age ago. Even in here, he was missing: the photos, his camp bed even his birthday cards, all gone. Rage finally broke through numbing cloud that had settled over him. He rummaged through Sam’s desk until he found a pen and paper and began to write:
“You promise: Sam’ll be ok?”
Lucifer smirks. “For now. Though, now that I know you’re such an easy lay, I might have to stop by again sometime.”
“And if I don’t listen?”
“Since about,” Dean checks his watch, “seven hours ago?”
“Yes – Hell.”
“The logical thing to do,” Cas is saying, “is to start chronologically and move forward.”
Castiel listened long enough to confirm it was a long one; he was in full Preacher mode tonight, before he tuned the words out. He still wasn’t used to grace; it wasn’t something Mom ever did. He heard noises from across the table and looked up to Dean filling his plate, determinedly ignoring the prayer. From the way John Winchester was gripping his teeth he knew what was going on too, but he kept his eyes closed and hands clasped.
The him in the rack makes a small groan from the back of his throat, eyes squeezing shut. Dean decides this means yes.
John stumbled in as Dean was serving up. He looked grumpy and hungover, but his expression lifted somewhat as Dean passed him a plate.
“Careful now, Castiel,” Uriel didn’t even bother to keep the gloating tone from his voice. “You wouldn’t want your father to think you’ve been disrespectful would you?”Silence was his only reply.
“Because it would’ve killed me to stay.”
there's some violence in this chapter, not too graphic but still kinda upsetting so be wary
“That seems to be your plans for a lot of things.”
“He’s gone, Dean,” how strange it is to say his own name with such gentleness. He drops down to his knees again so that they’re at eye level once again. “He’s gone and he’s not coming back.”
Dean was happy to take advantage of the situation too. John was thrilled, he knew, at Castiel’s interest, and home life was relaxing back towards the way it had been. John had even agreed to let Dean drive to the school dance on his own, which saved him from awkward conversation between Anna and his Dad.
“Well ain’t I just the picture of mental health?” Spell Dean says sweetly. Both Deans look roughly the same age: though the alcohol has smoothed some of the lines from the memory’s skin.
“It’s nice to meet you Sam,” he said, trying to think of something else to say. “Have you had a nice day?” he asked, lamely.
“Shit.”
“My Father’s out of town for the day – the house will be completely empty. Let’s go there.”
“Sounds good, what’s next?”
“Dean?” Cas says, alarmed, and the impala makes a particularly nerve racking lurch to the right as Dean turns to look at him and his arms move with his head. “Dean!”
you: it’ll know exactly where you won’t wanna go.”
“I have a family. I have you.” Came the firm reply. “I couldn’t leave you. I need you.”
“Anna? God no.” Dean didn’t seem aware of what he’s said. “ She’s more of a... an acquaintance I guess? I asked her to that stupid dance on Thursday, and she said yes. That’s about all there is to it.”
“I’m sorry to hear that,” was all Pastor Walker said. “Now, we ain’t cruel boys. We just want you to accept the Lord’s love. You’ll be gettin’ another chance when you’ve had some time to think about what you done.”
fucking bullshit,” Dean snorts. “Just because I didn’t talk about it with
“And so…open.”
“What about you?”
“Can you blame him? Look at you. You already tried to entice Castiel, who’s to say who you’ll try next.”
“I found it one of the times you were gone,” Sam tells him. “I forget which one exactly. It was a space to think, whenever it was.”
“No. No. No.”
“Don’t be,” Dean says, just like his younger self had said all those years/hours ago sitting on the hood of this same car, smoking a different pack of cigarettes. This time, though, Dean sounds like he means it. “This makes it easier, in a way. But tell me: what
“Is that all you’re gonna say?”
“How long have you been here?”
Something beneath them lurches, and there’s a violent ripping sound as they’re thrown into the air. For a few brief, disorientating, seconds, they hang suspended in the cacophony of colour.
“Literally.”
“You sure about this Son?” Bobby asks him softly.
Cas was sure he’d met most of the town by now, or had them pointed out to him in church, but her name was unfamiliar to him. “Moseley? I don’t think I’ve met her.”
Sam and Cas glance at each other. Cas gestures slightly with his head, and they both move to the side – away from Dean (or whatever it is), who watches them with a slight grin on his face but doesn’t try to move any closer.
“I never exactly hid it either,” Dean points out. “Just ‘cos I don’t hang pride flags from the impala and just cos’ I used to use the word ‘gay’ as an insult  doesn’t mean I was repressed,” he smiles. “But don’t be too hard on yourself Sammy – it didn’t happen as often as you’re probably thinkin’ it did.”
Warily, they approach the door. The shadows curl in closer towards them, and the young Dean presses his face into the older Dean’s chest. Cas reaches out, trying to put his hand on the handle – but it skitters away, repelled by some invisible force.
“Well that’s not the word I’d use, but yeah. And other stuff too y’know,” Dean blushes furiously, mumbling towards his lap. “Like, I dunno, cooking or watching movies or just doing shit together,” he doesn’t seem able to look at Cas. “Look,” he says, a little desperately. “We both want the same thing – but I don’t think either of us really has much experience with it, and I don’t think our lives will let it be normal, but that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t try, y’know?”
“I knew you’ve never smoked,” he says gleefully.
“That’s not the point!” Sam’s voices cracks into a shout, and they both wince and hold their breath. When the enthusiastic panting behind them continues unabated, Sam continues in a low whisper. “Look, Cas, you’ve been around humans long enough to know this is different. So just do both of us a favour and skip the obtuse angel act, turn around and check to see if there’s a fucking door so we can get out of here.”
“Cas!” Dean interrupted again, more forcefully. Castiel came to an abrupt stop, fear clear in his eyes. Dean reached his up to Castiel’s shoulder then, after a moment’s hesitation, stroked his cheek instead, wiping away the tears. “Where’s all this coming from?” He asked gently, “why d’you think I blame you?”
“I want to hear
“Is that…” Sam glances at Cas, who grimaces.
“Yeah that’s what I thought,” he says nastily, pressing down with his boot until Dean can’t help but gasp. “So, I’ll ask one more time. Do you know where Sam is?”
Cas hums noncommittally, resting his head briefly on Dean’s shoulder as they walk towards parade. “Most people appear to be with corporations or organisations of some sort,” he says.
?” He hurls the last word at his son as if it’s an insult, rather than a simple observation.
“And what would those be exactly? We aren’t Dean: we can’t know which memories he regards as the most painful – we probably aren’t even aware of the majority’s existence.”
“I knew it!” Uriel had crowed over him. “I knew there was something wrong with you.” His eyes had flashed to Dean, who’d had to fight down a sudden wave of shame at the pure derision in that glance. “
Dean shakes his head, smiling sadly. “You’re gonna see in a second anyway just…” he hesitates, looking at Sam. “...just remember what I said – no matter what, it’s always worth it.” He pushes the door open, and garish sunlight begins to spill out. As it touches his hands and feet they begin to dissolve. “Guess this is it for me,” he smiles, his voice tinged with both regret and relief. “It was good to see you – both of you. Here’s hoping we never meet again.” Then he’s gone.
“Now listen here Dean Winchester,” Missouri’s voice was firm and strong. “There ain’t nothin’ wrong with what you’ve done and what you are. It’s them that should know better.  It was them that decided to hurt you and condemn you. I won’t let you take the blame for their choices. They’re the ones that need to pay.”
It was the only part of home he had left.
more alcohol and probably didn’t involve his little brother pretending to be asleep in the background. He pushes the thought (and the morbid curiosity that’s trying to get him to open his eyes) aside as best he can and tries to think himself back to sleep. After a while, it works.
“Hmm…You’ve gone all tense,” The man says.
thank u to everyone who's leaving such lovely comments, it really means a lot to me
A short silence. “Fine. Good night Dad.”
“It’s so nice to see you again, Dean,” Alistair croons. “The
“Is there?” Dean asks. “You were there. He’d put a gun in my hand and leave.  If he came back and I was asleep, or if I forgot to check he was still human, he’d make me stand at attention for hours. He’d tell me that things were out to get us – to get you – and that if I couldn’t handle myself they’d win and it’d be on me: a kid. And that was all
detail, about every random hook up and flirt and whatever. Hell, you’d point at bars we drove past and tell me the name of the girls you’d screwed in the toilets. And yet the way I find out you’re into guys is because you got so drunk you forgot I was there?”
“Don’t mention it Dad. It’s gonna be a busy day.” Dean smiled at his father, John smiled back. The arguments of the previous day forgotten, it seemed, in the wake of bacon.
“And that Dad won’t find out?”
Hael relaxed at that. “Thank you Castiel,” she grabbed his hand, “C’mon, you needn’t be over here by yourself, not anymore.”  She dragged him across the room, depositing him in an empty chair next to Uriel.
“Fags like you; they don’t care where they get it,” Michael taunted. “Can’t control themselves.”
out to get us. I saved your ass more than a few times y’know, and his too – and how many times have we saved each other since then? Because of what he taught us. But for all that, was it any less cruel than the times he’d hit me? Or kick me? Or throw a bottle at my head?”
His dread is compounded by the strangled gasp, the involuntary sound of horror, that the Cas next to him lets out as he doubles over, clutching his stomach as if he’s been stabbed. “No,” he moans brokenly, “no.”
“Then I got nothin’ to say to you that I ain’t already said before.” He took a step towards Dean, who remained still.
She listened in silence as he told her what had happened, taking in his dishevelled from, the dark circles under his eyes, the bruises on his wrists. He was trying to keep his voice blank, emotionless, as if what he was describing had happened to someone else entirely.
“What are you talking about?”
“It doesn’t have to be.”
He wandered through empty streets, killing time. He was noticing more and more how monotonous his town was. Everything looked the same. Squat, ugly houses sat behind bland, square lawns bordered by neat, wilting flowers. Even the people, the few that were out early, seemed to blend together. Only the street signs assured him that he wasn’t walking in circles.
“We should be fine, he goes to sleep early on Saturdays, but I’ll just say umm...” He drifted into a heavy silence. They both knew how dangerous this was, there was no innocent explanation after all, but neither of them wanted to move into a more acceptable position.  “He won’t come in,” Cas had finished lamely.
“Where do you think you’re going, Winchester?” Uriel called lazily, they were nearly on him now.
“I think I’m sick Dad,” he replied. His voice was shaky, and when Jim stuck his head round the door, concern on his face, he must have looked sufficiently pale.
Sam was already downstairs, nose deep in some book. “C’mon Sam, don’t read porn at the table.” He hit Sam on the back of the head playfully. “What d’you want for breakfast? Bacon?”
“I figured you thought I was stupid for never fighting back.” Dean’s voice shakes a little.
“Those things are bad for you,” Dean shakes his head, but his tone is light. “He’s a doctor. He should know better.”
He didn’t know what to think anymore.
Dean straightened, under control. “Yeah, it’s enough.” He smiled as Cas. It was small, and shaky, but it was real. It was enough.
“Because it got us out of there. Because it
Content Warning: non-consensual, kinda gruesome kiss between Dean/Lucifer (as Cas) in this chapter. it starts at 'his voice cuts off' and ends with 'with and pained and garbled cry' tho there is also some p bloody descriptions of wounds in that paragraph if u wanna be careful, xoxo stay safe boobalas.
“Shut it!” John’s raised voice caught the Pastor’s attention and he made his way over to them, gliding effortlessly through the disappointed crowd. He reached out and clasped John’s outstretched hand, before pulling him into a hug.
In retrospect, Dean could hear how rehearsed those lines were. How clichéd, how un-John like they’d been. At some level, he must’ve known it at the time. But he’d been so grateful that his father had even tried, and so assuaged by guilt that any doubts were immediately quashed.
“Yeah to y’know:” Sam mimes smoking – bringing two fingers up to his lips absentmindedly, considering. “After me n’Dad fought – after Dean talked us down – I’d go sulk. Dad would too – though of course, he wouldn’t call it that. He’d probably go drink and/or shoot something and I’d go cry and seethe and Dean would just…vanish. I never even thought about it until now. He was just always there until I wasn’t and I never thought to question it. It didn’t even occur to me that he was…that he needed…that he was more than just…” he trails off.
They decided to walk to church that morning. The oppressive heat of the previous week had softened into something more bearable, and the Winchesters were joined a steady stream of happy churchgoers all heading towards the church.
“Yes I fucking know what I have to do,” Dean glares at Alistair.  “Yes, I’ll fucking do it. Just let me down.”
“Sam?” Dean is frantic, his eyes darting, his hands running over Sam’s arms and shoulders, cupping the back of his head – assessing for damage. “Shit Sammy – talk to me.”
“Naw, I’m just headin’ out of town for the day to do a couple visits,” Jim was pleased at Castiel’s apparent thoughtfulness. “I was going ask you along, but if you and Dean have plans?”
“It was sudden. An aneurism or somethin. Happened right in front of her eldest, Dean, he’s not dealt with it so good either.”
“She knew.” Cas stated, shaken. “How did she know? I thought we’d been careful.”
bad.”
“We still don’t know for sure,” Sam insists. “He’s never said anything.”
But Dean only smiles a very un-Dean smile.
brain for once?”
“But where will we go? We won’t know anybody.”
“Why not? You can’t want to stay?  Not anymore.”
“Isn’t it?” Dean switches direction mid-swing – burying his axe in Dean’s shoulder.
“Yeah but –”
“Yeah,” Dean goes to check his watch, but the face has melted: the numbers smudged into nothing. Still, the sun looks like it’s in the right position. “Should be right about…now.”
“We might need to stop dad,” he said, trying desperately to sound helpful. “For food n’ stuff.” It was an innocuous sentence, but John seemed to be going through every word, searching for an insult.
“No, Sir.” He says carefully.
“Where is your brother?” John raises his voice, forcing Dean to focus on him once again.
Dean shrugs. “Cas does. All I know is that it feels like the clouds have gone and the sun is out for the first time in years. Maybe they’ll come back, maybe not.”
“Where is everyone?” He asked Sam, “this place is a freakin’ ghost town.”
“Hell.” Sam might be too.
…until she feels something give way inside and gentle waves of pleasure begin to roll through her, and she presses her face into the place where Cas’ neck meets his shoulder, legs twitching, breath stuttering. It’s muscle memory and instinct that keeps her hand moving, and it’s only a few seconds later that she feels Cas shuddering – his movements an echo of her own.
doesn’t mean I was ashamed. Maybe I just didn’t
“Dean’s the arrogant one?” Cas had broken in, his voice quivering with a mixture of anger and disbelief at the hypocrisy of it all. “You interrupt us, insult Dean and our friendship but somehow he’s being disrespectful?”
“I bought beer,” Cas replies. “And I don’t sleep.”
“Yeah, Dean – it’s me.”
that,” Dean snaps, “I’ve seen Orange is the New Black.”
“The one and only,” Lucifer twirls his hand and bends again – this time in a mock bow.
“What are you gonna do then Dean? Live in the library? Hope that everyone just forgets what happened?” She made sure to keep calm, he would find it too easy to ignore her if she were angry.
Missouri pulled back, taking him all in, meeting his eyes with such intensity that he was forced to duck his head. “You’ve changed,” she declared, “but not that much. Not like this one,” she jerked her head at Sam, who was watching with a bemused awkwardness.
“Never. You ready?”
The answer, though truthful, seems to displease John – judging by the way Sam groans softly from beside Cas. Although Castiel has never met this form of the older Winchester, he looms large in both Dean and Sam. Cas can pick out details – of expression, of stance – that his sons have inherited. The slight curl to John’s mouth is his only outward show of emotion, but it’s the exact same curl Dean has when some monster he’s been hunting is begging for mercy, which is enough to set Cas instantly on edge.
“Sorry.”
“You sure about that?” A familiar voice sounds behind them. It’s Sam, dishevelled and panting and bloody but with the lighter clasped triumphantly in his hand, extended over the open grave. “Cos it seems like you’re the one that’s burning.” Dean falls to the ground as Harvey is consumed, body and soul, in flames.
“Yes, it does.”
“But there’s a line between –”
His heart began to race at the thought, and he smiled. He’d never believed someone’s heart could actually race for someone else, It was like something out of a fairy tale, but here he was.
“I guess I just never thought it was yours – figured it came from whatever bar you’d been hustling or body you’d been burning.”
“No!” He gasps out, his gaze slipping to somewhere over Dean’s shoulder. “Get away, not here. Go!
A force sends Sam flying until his back hits something solid. A rack. Chains spring from nowhere and snake round his body, holding him in place. The rack begins to move him slowly forward until he’s facing Dean – barely more than an arm’s length away. He could reach him if he could only move his arms.
“How’re you gonna face Mom one day and tell her that her family fell apart and you did nothing to fix it, huh? How’re you gonna look her in the eye and tell her that?” Dean seemed to stare through him, eyes glassy.
my subconscious Cas,” Dean pants, still straining against the door. “And believe me: I’ve been trying to close this door for ten years. If I could lock it don’t you think I…” he trails off as the door starts to vibrate. “Well that can’t be good,” he mutters. Then, with a cry, he flies back,
He’d always pushed it down, pretended nothing had happened. If he ignored it, it’d go away. He’d be normal. That’s all he’d ever wanted. To be normal.
After what feels like an age, his hand brushes the soft fabric. He turns to face it, pulling the curtain aside, but the window stops after just a few inches of glass – fading back into the wall exactly where the curtain (once free to hang) begins. Through the glass he can see the faint outline of a quiet looking street – nice houses, cheap cars – though it too fades into nothing after half a block or so. “What the hell?”
“Strip,” she orders Cas. There’s a bottle in her other hand and she takes a grateful swig against the cold air she knows is coming. “I’m doing it too, see? And smile! This is gonna be fun, Cas.”
“Keep us busy how?” Sam wants to know.
Dean laughs but it doesn’t sound much like a laugh. “It’s funny y’know. I’ve spent my whole life trying to be him or trying to please him – even after he was gone, even after I started to understand what he was, he was still at the back of
Turning, Castiel saw that Dean was right. Uriel was still standing where Castiel had left him. There was a livid expression on his face that Castiel found impossible to take seriously.
“Linin’ his pockets with the word of the Good Lord,” Dean snorted. “Remember his radio show: ‘Any god fearin’ Christian knows that Sherman’s Soap is the only soap that cleans your soul as well as your hands…’”
“Sammy,” Dean says, but it’s not either of the Deans currently squaring off. The four of them (two Deans, two not Deans) spin in surprise to find the other Dean limping up to the window. He doesn’t seem to be able to see them properly – his bruised and swollen eyes are fixed somewhere between Cas and Sam – but his face is determined. Slowly, with obvious difficulty, he raises his hand and wipes some of the blood away from his mouth, so that when he smiles it doesn’t look so monstrous. “Sam,” he says again, placing his hand on the ‘glass’ between them. It slides slightly, leaving a red smear.
“Weird, I know, but I needed Sammy to feel comfortable going to this sleepover.” The scene had shifted abruptly. He was outside Cas’ house now. It was dark. Cas was leaning against the door frame, smiling.
“I don’t just have
. Dean regards it for a second, before spinning, abruptly towards Cas, an unconvincingly cruel smile plastered haphazardly on his face. “And I bet you’re just loving this
“Dean,” Cas steels himself for the answer, “do you trust me?”
“Then I don’t think you have anything to worry about.”
Dean shifted uncomfortably. He didn’t want to hurt her feelings but Missouri had an uncomfortable knack for picking up on things you didn’t want her to know.
me. I didn’t even think about it much until long after he was dead.”
“A representation,” Cas agrees. “One you literally set free from the room it was locked in. You radically altered your emotional landscape. It’s not surprising that you may not know how to react anymore, or that you may not be able to suppress your initial emotions and reactions. You left the door open after all.”
“Who’s Cas?” he heard Charlie demand eagerly as he left. The door closing cut off most of Dean’s response, but Sam heard him swearing softly and it was enough to make him laugh as he set off down the dark streets.
boys like you. Don’t worry Castiel: you will be saved.”
“Photography: I do freelance work now. But,” Cas grabbed Dean’s hands in his own, “that doesn’t matter right now. All I wanted to tell you was that I didn’t want to leave you alone, and I’ve mourned our time together ever since: the years we could’ve had. Maybe we would’ve burned out after a few months, like young lovers often do. Maybe if I’d run with you, we’d live on opposite ends of the country and speak of each other only in hatred, but maybe we wouldn’t have: we didn’t get to find out and we never will. Those years were stolen from us, and nothing and no one can bring them back, but I want to try. I want to love you again,” He took a deep breath, “If you’ll let me.”
He needed to start breakfast. Dean was good cook, better than John at any rate. It was worth Sam waking him up early if he could make a proper breakfast.
“Who says I’m all used up?”  Dean’s voice is suddenly clear and strong, and he jerks his head upwards, crashing his forehead into his other nose. The demon falls back, roaring in pain and surprise as blood gushes down his face. Before anyone else has had time to really register exactly what’s going on, Dean’s on his feet, wrenching the axe from his own shoulder and throwing it in a long stead arc over Sam and Cas into his own chest.
“I remember this place,” He says. “Dad dumped us here for a whole summer once. It was probably the only time we were in a motel with a decent pool when the weather was actually good.”
Cassie shrugs. “We all need our ways to cope with the stress of it all – especially him,” she pauses, waiting for Dean to meet her eyes. “He worries about you, y’know. We both do.”
“Holy shit,” Sam swears, unable to stop himself, before immediately wincing at the loudness of his voice – practically echoing and impossible to ignore in the soft quiet. Nobody on the bed – Dean, Cassie or the stranger – reacts to the sound, however: they all seem completely oblivious to the rest of the world.  Dean laughs softly, and turns so he can kiss Cassie gently. The man behind them continues to stroke his hands up and down Dean’s body.
“And when he said ‘I don’t know when I became capable of love’, he was lying too. I’ve always been capable of love.”
“Yeah. I knew Dad thought there was something wrong with me, but I didn’t really understand what. Until now.”
Cas grimaced. “I didn’t,” he confessed. “I tried everything I could think of save arson to escape, but they – and my father – were determined to ‘save’ me. It was easier to just wait it out, to pretend to be the perfect son who’d been led terribly astray.” His mouth twisted in disgust. “My Dad only allowed me to attend a Christian college, but eventually I managed to get a scholarship to an art college in New York, the pretence didn’t last long after that.”
His room was too quiet. He wasn’t used to sleeping without the noise of someone else breathing near him. He wanted Sam. He wanted Cas. He wanted Mom.
“Yeah but what about the first time it happened?” Dean holds up a hand to forestall him. “Yes it wasn’t
“I guess we’re just geniuses,” Cassie replies.
“Castiel, we would like to talk to you.” She’d informed them. She’d thrown Dean a venomous look. “Alone.”
“You wanna tell me more?”
“More or less.”
way out is through some mystery memory that’s apparently more intimate and painful than literally everything else you’ve seen or I’ve been –
“It’s ok: You’re trying.” Dean assured him, and Sam felt better.
“I guess we won’t ever know,” Dean was feigning nonchalance and Sam let him. The memories were probably painful after all. Besides, there was always later.
Slowly, John turned to face his eldest, leaving Sam to stand – all but forgotten – by the kitchen table. The air between them seemed to crackle as their eyes met. “That depends,” he said eventually, “you still a faggot?”
He wasn’t dead; it wasn’t heaven nor hell that awaited him. It was Something. Anything. He had no idea what lay ahead but at least is wasn’t nothing.
He took his place at the front of the church, next to Uriel. He could practically feel Dean’s gaze burning into his back but he refused to look back.
“Thank you Sam,” Jim answered graciously, reaching out to shake Sam’s eager hand. “Look at you. You must’ve grown at least a foot since I last saw you. And you’re lookin more and more like your grandfather everyday!”
“You’re not disagreeing,” the spell says.
“No,” Sam says again, forcing himself forward – between the two Deans. Cas joins him, angel blade appearing in his hand.
“Uh huh,” Sam says flatly.  “I’m sure ‘she’ does.”
“Great the Pastor properly” he ordered, still managing to sound serious despite his ridiculous apron.
“Yeah I think we’ll pass.”
“Cas don’t look,” Sam says, gripping his shoulder and trying to pull him away. “It’s only going to get worse, don’t look.”
Cas and Sam exchange quick looks of dismay – though really neither is surprised.
“Hell.” Dean might be swearing.
Dean’s gaze slides to the floor, and his jaw tenses as if he wants to speak, but he doesn’t say anything.
Belatedly, it occurs to Dean that maybe this parade isn’t just for him, that maybe it’s for a newly human(ish), newly adrift(ish) Castiel. That maybe Cas needs something more tangible than half-heard I love you’s murmured into his back while they drift off to sleep.
Jim raised his hands, and the crowd stilled almost immediately. “It’s true folks. This snake, in his arrogance, tried to tempt Castiel. He knows how to exploit every weakness, how to slip between the cracks of your faith. Luckily, my Son was too strong for him and was able to resist. But I ask you, do you have the same confidence in your children?” He let them ponder for a few seconds. “I can tell by your faces that some of you ain’t so sure.  An’ that’s because children don’t always have enough strength. That power can be hard to find for some people and it takes awhile for them to build their armour. Now, that ain’t a bad thing folks. God understands how hard it can be – that’s why he gave us parents in the first place. That’s why we forgive those that wrong us - that give in to that temptation.
The rest of the drive passes quickly. Sam occasionally looks over at Dean, who’s watching the road. His relaxed posture is a familiar one, especially behind the wheel, but Sam’s sure there’s an ease, a lightness that wasn’t there before. The rest of the time he stares out the window – watching the outlines of mountains roll by.
“Wait,” Sam is aghast. “You thought that I knew he was hurting you, and I still left?”
“...No Morals! No grasp of proper family values!” Novak was shouting. “They let their children cavort with the depraved and then they come cryin’ to me when their sin leads to woe, as if they haven’t already spit in the hand I offered to them, spit on the good book, on the lord himself!”
“How about neither of you does it and we just move the fuck on?” Interjects the other Dean from the side, but even Cas ignores him now – every ounce of his (considerable) focus now trained on Sam.
Jim smiled again – his paternal, kindly one this time. “Go to bed son,” he said fondly. “It’ll be a busy day tomorrow; you’ll need your rest.
“This is what he wants,” Dean warns. “He’s tryna distract you and trap you and it’s
Cas couldn’t tell if Dean was laughing or crying but, he supposed, it didn’t much make much difference: the sound was the most joyful thing he’d ever heard.
“The spell told us the exit was in the ‘dead centre’ of you,” Sam says. “Is this it?”
“Enough,” he says firmly, holding Dean’s gaze. “I understand why you are so reluctant, Dean. Really,” he adds at Dean’s derisive snort, “I do. But there’s no point in trying to annoy us into leaving without you: it won’t work.”
“No.” Missouri’s firm voice cut across the room, making the both of them jump. Her words were harsh but her tone was kind. “Even if you can somehow convince Sam you ain’t the devil incarnate after everything he’s been taught, even if you can somehow convince the rest of the town of that too it won’t make a damn difference.”
eyes) flash a strange green for a second. He sees it. He feels it. He sees it and he feels it. “And give you even more sentience than you have now? I don’t think so.”
The nothingness has at least solidified into a something – growing gradually around them, sketched in lines of gold. Sam hopes this is a good thing, even if it’s not a something he can exactly understand. There seem to be walls and a floor – curving above and around them, only slightly taller than Sam. It’s kind of like a tunnel he dimly remembers visiting with Jess once at an aquarium. The water had pressed in oppressively on all sides, and he’d been acutely aware of the fragility of glass. Fish and the shadows of sharks had passed over and around them: eyeing them with a bemused amusement at their foolishness, their arrogance, their obvious out-of-placeness. He’d held Jess’ hand tightly in his as they’d shuffled through, too busy searching for cracks to pay much attention to the fish.
“Those things’ll kill you if you’re not careful,” Dean remarks casually.
he spits out Cas’ full name like it’s poison. “Standing calmly to the side this whole time. All these memories have been about Sam so far haven’t they? Must be interesting for you: getting a front-row seat to our goddamn family melodrama.”
“Don’t think you have to stand up for him just because he’s your friend.” His voice was soft, friendly, sweet. It made Castiel want to throw up. “If he attacked you, if he forced himself on you. Just say. It won’t be your fault.”
Reaching down, she takes his dick in her hand and starts to stroke, grinning in satisfaction at the strangled noise he makes.  She thinks it’s probably the most human he’s ever sounded. She goes a little faster, and feels as he starts to thicken in her hand. He buries his face into her neck, and she puts her other hand in his hair.
Silhouetted against the wall, a couple groped and pulled at each other in the night air. Castiel turned away from the writing mass and set off towards the grass. Soon they were both sitting, side by side, as the night darkened around them.  They sat in companionable silence, each enjoying the other’s company.
sorry this is late, i've been sick and my country fucked itself over so it's not been the best week for me.
“I understand. I’ll do anything.” He cast about for an escape. “It’s late and, um, this whole thing has been quite tiring...”
“Can you stop interrupting me? I was
“I’m sure,” Dean did not bother to hide the sarcasm in his voice. “I haven’t interrupted anything important have I?” His eyes were on Castiel, but it was Hael that spoke yet again.
They edge slowly towards it, both keeping their eyes resolutely trained on the wall in front of them, trying their best to ignore the increasingly loud moans from behind them. Sam’s brain is telling him a lot of important things he doesn’t want to know – like how the song currently playing is one Dean still likes to hum sometimes when he’s been driving for a long time, or that there were too many arms for two people – but he pushes it aside and concentrates on feeling for the curtain with his hand.
“Well I’ll be honest with you, it won’t be easy.” Jim continued, “but it doesn’t have to be so hard either. Each and every one of you has resisted temptation before, I know it and the Lord knows it and both of us trust that you can do it again. Remain strong, remain vigilant.
“Absolutely not,” Sam and Cas in unison.
“I still don’t like it,” he meets Cas’ eyes in the mirror and sighs at the determination he sees in them, “but alright.” He’s rewarded by the sight of Cas visibly relaxing, and the sound of Sam’s gentle exhale. “Y’know,” he grumbles, “if I’d known you’d be this excited to go to some stupid parade we would’ve done this ages ago.”
“Lucifer lied,” Cas says suddenly, vehemently. The persistent niggling at the back of his mind, ever since he saw that memory, has finally made itself known to him – hatred, a new kind, towards his brother. Not the abstract hatred towards a distant foe, nor the despairing hatred of an undefeatable villain, but an intimate, personal ( human?) hatred that settles in the pit of his stomach and on the palms of his hands.
This, he’d realised, was the moment it had all gone wrong.  If he’d been nicer to Hael, if Cas hadn’t been provoked into his outburst. Maybe nothing would have happened. Or maybe it would’ve. Back then he’d been naive enough to think they could’ve hidden forever, now he knew better. Sooner or later the truth always came out.
“Dean, I –”
“Is there any way you can, I dunno, speed it up a bit?” He asks Alistair. Except it’s not him asking – he’s still on the rack. Yet he’s also peering over Alistair’s shoulder at himself, curious and satisfied at the sight of himself so close to breaking. “They’re getting closer.”
“No Sir.”
“How are you doing that?” Dean (the spell Dean) demands, his eyes flashing the not-quite-dean-green.  The wall in front of them darkens, Dean and the graveyard fading into shadows with it. Sam lets his hand drop.
“Castiel,” he was more pleased than he wanted to admit that Castiel had sought him out. “Enjoying your new celebrity?”  He smiled crookedly at Castiel, who had the decency to look embarrassed.
“I remember this phone,” he says. “Dean used to call me on it.” As if on cue, the phone begins to beep in his hand. Surprised, Cas drops it to the floor – where it rolls instantly back into place. On the bed, Dean stiffens.
Even a blind man, Cas thinks, would be able to see how angry John is now. He’s radiating a cold fury that would make even an archangel take a step back, yet Dean stands his ground, meeting John’s eyes with a steely determination of his own.
“Well, I’m not really much of an angel anymore,” yet the words don’t fill him with the gloom they normally do. “And after all these years, human is hardly an insult.”
The rustling of clothes, told him the sermon had ended, and he jumped to his feet in relief.  He was nearly at the door when he realised that John was among the small crowd trying to get face to face with Pastor Novak.  He huffed with impatience as he caught up with him and Sam.
“Why can’t I stop crying?” Dean grits out eventually, fighting to control his voice. “What’s wrong with me?”
That was the word wasn’t it? Castiel had grown up to the sermons; he knew what the bible said. Dean would know too. It was impossible not to in a town like this.
“Anywhere.”
“That’s what this felt like,” Sam takes the lighter but keeps it in his hand for now. “Except the reason I couldn’t see the mountains was because I was
“Yes you are,” Dean replies, adjusting the knot, “You always do it backwards. There.”
“I need to see him.” Dean whispered. “It’s been so long.”
“I have a...friend in the city. He’ll put you up for a while, though he’ll expect you to work in return.” She said, handing Dean a piece of paper with the address on it. “He’s expecting you in the next few days.” She held up a hand, “Don’t thank me. He’s a difficult man, but he’s better than here.”
School. Dean would be there. Castiel wasn’t ready for it yet. He didn’t want to see Dean, to see the hatred that would surely be there, marring his green eyes, because of what he had done.
His eyes pass over him several times. He knows Dean down to his very molecules, having rebuilt him from them more times than he cares to count. He knows, in minute detail, the particularities of Dean’s cells, of his chemical imbalances and atomic distribution as well as the ways they have shifted with time. And, in the decade or so since meeting him, Cas has become aware of ageing in the real sense, rather than the abstract cosmic blinks that humans had once been contained within. He’s watched the Dean he rescued from hell (a Dean he has only now begun to think of as young) shift and reform into the Dean he knows today – a process at once sudden and slow, obvious and unnoticeable. Despite this, supposedly extensive, knowledge of Dean both past and present, it takes him a while to associate the stocky, pale, teenager stretched out on a sun lounger with the man he’s searching for. There’s nobody else here, however, and the longer he looks the more he can see the origins of his Dean in this younger Dean’s face.
“Threesomes,” Sam corrects. “We don’t know if he’s into men. He might’ve just wanted Cassie and been willing to compromise.”
“I’m sorry,” Dean’s voice is ragged. “I’ll…I’ll try to make it quick.”
“Well I met you, so not too bad.” They both laughed, the tension melting off of them as they sat together on the grass.
Dean,
“That wasn’t my choice Sam,” Dean snapped, eyes fixed somewhere over Sam’s shoulder. “Why do I have to come crawling back huh?
He remembered what Dean had asked him, that first Sunday:
His hands were clutching Dean’s shoulders so hard he could feel it beneath his jacket. He bit back the retort he had been preparing, not wanting to antagonise his father any further.
“What difference will it make?” Cas asked bluntly. “Even if you do tell him, you won’t be able to stay.”
he is, now. And what could I say after all these years? Sometimes the past has to stay past y’know?”
“Or maybe it’s because whenever you show up you only have one thing on your mind,” interjects the man.
“Before, in that last memory,” Sam asks as they pull carefully away from the lake. “How did you know what to say to yourself?”
“One that means I can walk outta this with some of my dignity still intact,” Dean snaps. “One that gives me a bit of time to find the way out of this shit show without anyone else gettin’ to rifle through my damn brain, Ok?”
“Pastor,” was all he said, his tone deliberately polite but neutral. Castiel found himself oddly relieved. He had grown so tired of the exaggerated respect the people in this town showed to his father and, by extension, him. It was nice to be treated like a real person again, however minutely.
“You didn’t do
At first it had been funny, then annoying, then sad, and now it was funny again. “There’s no point,” Dean told her. “He could be anywhere doing anything: he ain’t gonna just walk into my diner one day and order pie.”
“What am I supposed to do?” he snapped, “I can’t just sit and wait.”
Uriel’s smile deepened.  “Really, Dean. You don’t honestly think we’d let you show your face round here anymore?”
He prowled restlessly through the sleeping house. It only added to the confusion within him. He needed space, he needed air. Still in his pyjamas he crossed the back yard, through the gate and down to the river. It was still dark, the stars burned dispassionately above him, same as they always did.
“Ok,” he says and at some point in the last few seconds he’s moved until he’s right in front of her. He puts both hands on either side of her face, tangling his fingers in her hair...
“I just wish he could see the light – as I did.” He replied slowly. “It’s... unfortunate that we’ve had to give up on him.” A few in the crowd nodded in agreement, and he relaxed.
“Cas –” Dean began, he wasn’t quite sure what he was going to say, but he didn’t get the chance.
As Sam movies the lighter slowly around, the tiny flame reveals a strange sculpture, still almost completely in shadow. It’s too straight to be random or a natural feature of the landscape, yet with odd protrusions and additions that speak of something organic.
another way.”
“Yeah, I start on Monday. It’s nice that I’m going to know one person there at least.”
“We’re taking Missouri?” Sam asked, curious.
“Is it really that bad?”
are you doing?”
“No: you’re hiding.”
“Dean,” Cas’ voice is soft as he steps forward to rest his hands on her forearms. His fingers are nearly long enough to encircle them completely, but his grip remains loose and warm. “Can I?” He asks, and she nods, letting him move her arms apart.
“No. Let me leave on my own: I’ll go far away; I’ll change my name. you won’t
“I was an idiot, a fucking idiot and I know –”
“Hey, stop doing that! And I don’t snore!”
“Cain’s a weird name,” Cas said, reading over Dean’s shoulder.
He knows that Sam and probably Cas will want to talk, but exhaustion is darkening the edge of his vision by the time they pull into the parking lot of the motel. They both look haggard under the flickering red neon of the vacancy sign, and he knows that he (the one who’s heart the ghost had tried to strangle) must look much worse. Maybe that’s why they don’t try and make him stay at the car but instead allow him to escape to his bed with nothing more than a quick squeeze on the shoulder from Sam.
“He’s gettin the bus.” John held up a hand, forestalling any questions.
“Loving you has always been easy,” Cas tells him solemnly, and the air between them feels almost solid. “Even when it’s hard.”
The congregation was stirring angrily at his words; Novak seemed to notice and made a deliberate effort to calm himself before continuing in a softer voice. “Folks, don’t despair, “You do not stay angry forever but delight to show mercy. You will again have compassion on us; you will tread our sins underfoot and hurl all our iniquities into the depths of the sea.”  God is good, he is kind, and as long as there a folks like you around, Goodness will triumph. Now, my children let us Pray...”
“Why?” he demanded, his voice quaking. “Why won’t anyone tell me what’s going on?”
“You’re gonna have to be more specific there, Sam,” Dean says wryly.
“I…guess?”  He cringed internally as she relayed this back to the kitchen.
was what he really meant.
“I don’t know. We need light. Maybe I can –” Cas cuts off as fire bursts to life around them – the walls themselves igniting. A wall of flame shoots up between them and Dean – the force of the heat throwing them backwards.  Smoke collects above them, black and roiling. Thick tendrils ooze down and coil around Dean – twisting around his exposed heart and squeezing gently. Dean makes a soft whimpering sound, before forcing his teeth shut with an audible crack so the smoke can’t get down his throat.
I think…when I was with Lisa and Ben,” Dean trails off, looking at his hands, blinking furiously. Sam lets it sit – he doesn’t think Dean’s even said their names out loud in years. They stay that way for a while, the only sounds the rustle of the trees and the gentle lapping of lake water on the shore.
“True,” Alistair concedes, and with the sound of his voice, everything else crashes away and Dean’s back to where he started, back to where he’s always been. “And boy this
He wanted to grab his father, to shake him and rage until John had to acknowledge him, to acknowledge the seventeen years between them.  He took a step forward. John didn’t move. He took a second then a third. By the fourth, he was close enough to touch.
Dean’s eyes snap open but focus immediately on Alistair. He opens and closes his mouth but no words come out – only pants and grunts.
“Yeah, I’d like that.” Cas mumbled.
“Shut up and bacon sounds nice. Do we have time?”  “We’ve got ages, Dad’s not even up yet.” Dean’s hands seemed to move of their own accord as he talked. Soon the bacon was frying happily on the pan, the smell wafting through the small house.
Dean shrugged. “I dunno, I never thought about it properly. Just...anywhere that wasn’t here.”
Hav u watched the Florida Project? U should watch the Florida Project
“Yeah, I do. And even if I didn’t, it needs to happen.”
“Well, I’m no expert, but I’d say ditchin’ the popular kids to hang out with the ‘godless loner’ is a good start. It’s pissed your minder off at least.” He leaned back in his chair, smiling over Castiel’s shoulder.
“And, as you can see, it’s working out great for me.” Dean says with sarcasm exaggerated enough for even Cas to understand – a too wide smile plastered on. His face quickly drops. “To be honest, I didn’t think it would ever come up anyway. There hasn’t really been anyone else for the past few years – man or woman. It’s only been you.” He’s not looking at Cas when he says it, staring determinedly out the windscreen instead.
“I uh,” Dean seemed unsure of what to do with himself. His hands were still full of pancakes and he cast about for an empty surface.
“And what about you?”
At first, all there is is dark. Slowly, and one by one, his senses creep back in – the way they always had when whoever was in charge that day decided it was time for the fun to start again. Smell first, of course, and not a surprise: sulphur and blood and shit, mixing together into the familiar malaise. Then touch: the air begins to heat his skin, bringing up pinpricks of sweat – creeping in between the layers of his clothes, so that he has to resist the temptation to shrug out of his jacket. The ground begins to texture beneath his feet.
“I was being serious, look” Dean pulled Cas’ face up so they were eye to eye. “I don’t know much, ok? I don’t know much about God or the world or anything. But I know this: if being normal means being like the people in that church; if it means being like Uriel and Hael then I don’t wanna be normal. Do you really wanna be like them?”
“Dean,” Cas takes a step forward. “Are you ok?”
Dean grimaces as his gaze moves from Sam to Cas’ face. “Yeah,” he grits out. “But in case you’ve forgotten I’m stuck in my own damn head where I can’t fucking lie and
Like the streets, the house felt unbearably quiet and empty. He turned the radio on, letting a news broadcast fill the silence. It was typical Sunday nothing, the world was going on same as ever even as his crashed and burned.
“I’m glad son,” and he was, John realised. As much as he loved them, as much as he couldn’t lose them, his sons had been so isolated since Mary. They needed to get back into the world. Besides Sam was almost the same age as he’d been when he’d met Mary...
“I’m sorry,” he mutters – voice hoarse. “didn’t mean to scare you.”
“You’ve lied to me; You’ve lied to Him,” Jim pointed upwards, “well now it’s time to stop.”
be really you. And I didn’t do it then to save you or free us from some spell; I did it because I wanted to hurt you, because I wanted to not hurt more than I wanted to protect you. How can you know that and still trust me?”
“You don’t know what the fuck you’re talking about.” He fought to keep his voice calm. All three had moved closer yet he was routed to the spot in anger.
“We’d better go.” Cas said morosely.
Sam. Where’s my Sam? Why’s he not here?”
Sammy...
“Could you hear us the entire time?” Sam demands as they start walking.
“I wish,” Sam says, “I wish I could’ve been there for you. I wish I wasn’t gone.”
For a second Alistair’s form does flicker – becoming the corpse that Sam had left him as. Alistair seems unconcerned, however, for he merely frowns in mock confusion. “You sure about that?” he asks casually, as the white eyes slide back into place and the bloodstains become black smoke.  “I feel pretty alive.” He waves a hand dismissively, “I know, I know, I’m not really ‘real’. Not like you two. But reality is such a…limited way to see the world. Truth: Lies, Fact: Fiction, Now: Then, Life: Death. These aren’t so much binaries as…states of mind. And what a state of mind we’re in – ripe for the taking. That’s the first thing I’m going to teach Dean when he breaks, y’know. That’s what this all comes down to. States of mind. He’s going to take to it so well. Such a good student. So eager to please.”
(See the end of the chapter for
yay i actually followed through on something for once. score. thanks to everyone who left kudos, it really kept me going.
“Shut up!” Dean is shaking now, trying subtly to get to his feet.
of it: Sam could feel the curious glances being shot their way, though nobody had interrupted them. “Everybody’s staring.” He said, embarrassed. “Like they know.”
me if I don’t want to have to think about what this means right now, and just tell me we’re not going to talk about it so we can get the fuck out of here.”
“What the fuck are you doing here?” Dean asks, warily climbing to his feet. “’N how the fuck did you get here?”
Sam, who had withdrawn slightly in teenaged embarrassment at the mention of his looks, mumbled something, before turning to shake Castiel’s hand as well. He was already the same height, and Castiel didn’t doubt he would soon tower over him.
“Why didn’t you say anything?” Cas asks, both to save Sam and because he genuinely wants to know the answer.
“Oh you really think you’ll be able to handle it?”
“Answer me!”
sorry, this chapter is quite short but the next one should be up soon
He pulled Castiel’s lips onto his again, deliberately this time. The other boy responded enthusiastically, pressing closer.
The crowd roared its approval.
“How do I escape?” he asked hopelessly, both to Dean and the world at large. It was Dean who answered.
He was being wiped away. Soon the town would forget him, except for Missouri and thinking of him would only ever cause her sadness. Even for Sam he would be nothing more than a vague, frozen memory, unstuck from time and happiness. A formless ghost: an empty space.
“You know we can’t promise that,” Sam pleads futilely, “but so what? Just because things will change doesn’t mean it’ll be for the worse. We can get through this and things will be better.”
enjoy
It was true, Cas had felt Dean’s absence from his life as if it were a missing limb. It wasn’t enough to rely on memories of love when all that surrounded you was hate.  “How should we do it?” he asked eventually.
Sam was sitting on his bed, back turned to Dean. Had they been fighting?
“That’s not true,” Cas protested.
“Yes he did! He must’ve! You can’t be – ­”
He had a point. “I’ll make sure not to spread the word.”
you Dean?” Cas asks, climbing out the pool to stand next to Sam.
Behind him, Mary Winchester’s burning body, her mouth open in a terrible but silent scream, flashes into Dean’s consciousness. The smell of smoke overpowers the chlorine as she hangs, horribly, in the air behind John – clearly an invention of Dean’s imagination, but vividly real nonetheless. Visibly, Dean flinches, and John smiles grimly, victoriously, at the sight of his son’s distress.
“So rude,” Alistair sighs. “Runs in the family, I guess.” He does let go, however, stepping back to let Dean catch his breath.
“Hey! I was nice to you, Jerk.”
“I’m not leaving! I told you, I can’t.”
No this will be good for both of them; Cas gets to experience some of the humanity he’s willing to die for, and Dean gets to have someone else inside her for a while.
He and Cas had left class as soon as the bell rung, not wanting to be ambushed by Hael again.  They’d hidden around the back of the school, waiting for John to pick them up.
“Hey now, none of that” Dean says firmly, but kindly. Gently, he puts a hand on his own, tiny, shoulder and rubs it comfortingly, waiting for the tears to subside a little. “Look over there,” he points at Sam. “Look at how fu – uh – freaking
“Please,” Dean’s voice is hoarse and cracking. “Please, Alistair.”
“Because I was scared Sam. I didn’t want you to hate me.”
“You don’t mean that Sam, you can’t.”
“You were very young,” is all Cas can think to offer (dimly wondering how angels have ever thought themselves competent at anything). “And if Dean wanted to hide something from you, then I don’t see how you could have noticed.”
“I said shut up!” Sam hisses again, but he makes no move to turn away – in fact he steps closer, glaring furiously (but ineffectively) at his (spell)brother.
seem a little worked up,” the man says.
“What’re we gonna do Cas?” Dean had forced himself to ask. He’d tried to avoid the thoughts, had pushed them to a far corner of his mind, but they came creeping back every time.
“Those bastards,” Cas was frowning in confusion. “I don’t understand, how could they just watch?”
“Oh that’s right – I melted your tongue too. Silly me,” Alistair tilts his head slightly, and Dean chokes. “Now, what were you saying?”
“I’ll understand if you can’t forgive me. I just wanted you to know how deeply I regret it.” Now that he had started, it was hard to stop. “After everything you’d already been through I should’ve been there for you like you were for me. You were hurt and alone. I mean Dad had…and Uriel, the whole fucking town knew what was happening and they did nothing and I was so angry,
“I’m strategizin’.”
“Good luck son, just,” Bobby pauses, “just try not to too lost in there: it happened, it ain’t happening.”
“Shut the hell up.”
“Hell no, I mean because you’re such a little bitch.”
“The real you?”
“Well it’s not like you’re the most sensitive person at the best of times,” Sam’s says bluntly.
“Do you have any idea where you might be?” Sam asks.
“I have no idea who he is,” Sam confesses. “I didn’t even know Dean was into uh…this kind of stuff.”
“You wouldn’t lie to me, would you son?”
“So what are we arguing about, huh? You want to do this, let’s do it!” She starts on the next couple of shirt buttons, but stops again when she sees Cas still isn’t moving. “What now?” she asks, exasperated at this point.
“But what about Dad?” Young Dean sniffs, “Why isn’t he coming back? Is he angry with me? What did I do wrong?”
“The hell are you talking about?” He asked eventually, struggling to keep his tone flippant.
“Oh,” Dean relaxes a mite.
“You mind looking after stuff for a bit? And tell everyone the kitchen’s closed: I need to talk to Sam here a while.”
“Sammy!” Dean had grabbed his arm, but the sound of his old nickname was enough to silence Sam. “Shut up for a sec ok? I’m not mad.”
Pastor Novak slammed his hand against the podium, and Dean jumped, guiltily looking around to make sure his Dad hadn’t seen that he’d been day dreaming again. But John, like the rest of the congregation, had his eyes glued to the Preacher, enraptured.
“A spell trapped us in a magical representation of your consciousness,” Cas explains earnestly. “You are simply a memory or construction of yourself, one that represents a core of your identity and the last obstacle between us and the real world – ”
“Yeah well, I was there, sort of.  It was me after all. It was all me,” his eyes move downwards as he hunches his shoulders. “All of it,” he repeats in a lower voice.
“He always opposed the parade,” Cas adds from the back seat, “but while alive he couldn’t do anything to stop it. This year, however, the run-up to the parade’s been plagued with disaster: the stage has collapsed 3 times already and a night guard was attacked. There are six people in the hospital; all claiming to have seen an angry old man shouting at them.”
“I can explain Sam, I promise.” He made to walk towards the door, but Michael’s hand clamped on his arm, trapping him in the driveway.
Sure enough, her face fell as she watched Dean fiddle. “He’s avoiding me too then?” She didn’t wait for an answer. “Well, what can I expect? He’s only young after all.” Her face brightened with interest as she regarded them.  “So then, what brings you two in here on a day like this?”
Sam only smiled, “Yeah,” he said, turning back to Jim. “Today was really great Pastor Jim, thank you.”
“Why not?” asks Sam.
“I’m sorry Cas.”
“No…”
“You have to pay for that?” He asks.
Cas’ sharp intake of breath is lost in the sound of flapping wings, and Cas (another Cas) appears on the ground in front of them – trench coat rumpled and stained, face bloodstained and twisted in pain. He looks like he’s been in a fight, and a bad one at that. Dean jumps to his feet, cigarette dropping to the ground, instinctually starting forwards, before something kicks in and he stops well out of reach, keeping his distance.
The corner of Dean’s mouth pushed up into a lopsided smile. He didn’t seem angry or sad. If anything, he seemed vaguely amused. “As a matter of fact: I am.”
“No way,” Dean had said, too quickly. “She’s super pissed at me,” he’d added hastily. “No, I’ll go to Castiel’s. We’re gonna, um, study.”
– to tell you. In case I never get the chance again.”
“I think it has to be me,” Dean says. It takes a little juggling and nudging, but he manages to coax a small hand from around his neck, stooping slightly so he can reach the door. He pushes the handle down, but pauses, twisting his head round to look into his own eyes.
“Hello Dean.” Cas’ gravelly voice brought a relieved smile to Dean’s face.
Dean smiles at him, tears streaming down his face. “Don’t ask questions you don’t want the answer to Sammy.”
It’d been a sleepover, he remembered abruptly. Sam’d been invited by his friends (Ruby probably) but he’d refused to go.
Dean gestures to the date on the door:
“I’ll try.”
“You wanna be a lawyer?”
“I’m sure he’s still hurt,” Cas concedes quickly, wondering if he should reach out to steady Sam’s shaking shoulders. He rests a hand there awkwardly and when nothing bad (or at least worse) seems to happen, he ploughs on. “But just because he’s still upset doesn’t mean that he still blames you. Remember, he never intended you see…all that – it was a vulnerable, private moment where everything was still fresh and raw. The way he saw things then will not be how he sees things now – with the virtue of hindsight and distance,” Cas pauses, and Sam nods, looking a little (though not much) better. Cas hopes it’s an appropriate time to voice his own feelings but he simply cannot ignore them any longer. “I must admit, it was…strange to see Dean like that,” he tries cautiously – and sighs in relief when Sam shoots him a wry smile in understanding.
“No-no,” Cas stammers, looking pleadingly over his shoulder, “I didn’t mean that –”
“Sorry” He’d mumbled, loosening his grip. “Just...hell Sammy, what’d I do to get deserve a little brother like you?”
“What’s the matter?” He’d asked, unable to help himself. “Need help with a book burning or something?” beside him, Cas had laughed, causing both Hael and Dean’s cheeks to flush. For him, it had been pleasure at the sound. For her, it had been anger.
“Don’t Lie to me! Sam’s over there,” Dean jerks his head towards the crib. “’N he’s not that big. And Cas isn’t here yet,” he stops, frowning at the words that’ve just left his mouth. “Wait,” he mumbles. “That’s not…I don’t understand.”
“Sammy,” he says. Then, confusingly, “If the situation was reversed, and I was dying – ” his voice is lower, rougher but also clearer – not the broken rasp that all that swelling and blood should be producing.
“I wasn’t exactly planning on shouting it down Main Street but, c’mon, not everyone in this town is out for blood.”
“I’m afraid so,” Cas replied gravelly. “Nothing except the future.”
“No Dean, you’re not dead,” Cas says patiently.
The tunnel is small and cramped, but he forces himself in. The air grows hotter and hotter and the smell of sulphur grows stronger as he descends, almost unbearably so. It’s a strange reverse of the original event:  instead of widening, the earth seems to close in around him and push him upwards, as if it’s trying to force him back to the surface. Every molecule of his mind is telling him that this is a bad idea, but he grits his teeth and powers through. Eventually, painfully, he hears a crack and the earth crumbles, depositing him in a dirty heap at Bobby’s feet.
hello i recently remade tumblr, so come chat to me there if ur enjoying this fic. it's: https://fanficanthropologist.tumblr.com/
It was only hours later, once they finally managed to escape Charlie, once they were lying exhausted and sweaty in each other’s arms that it finally occurred to Dean to ask the obvious question.
Jim was clearly disappointed, but what kind of father would berate his son for studying? “Alright boys, enjoy yourselves, if you can that is,” He flashed them his toothy smile, the TV one. “But be careful with that librarian, she’ll talk a load of bull at you if you let ‘er, you’ll be there for hours.” He added as he walked away.
“Do you want to go back? Do you feel like yourself?”
“No,” Missouri was firm but gentle. “You want this. It’s not the same thing. Do you really want to risk your brother’s safety and happiness on the off chance your father will pull his head out his ass long enough to listen to reason?”
“Dean,” John’s warning cut across the room. “Don’t you dare open your fucking mouth again!” The pure, unadulterated hatred in his words was enough to drain Dean’s defiance and he dropped his gaze to the floor once more.  John too retreated into his corner as Pastor Novak composed himself.
In front of them, Dean is trying desperately to pull away, but ‘Cas’ is biting down hard on his lips, bringing his hands up to roughly tug Dean even closer – fingers digging bruisingly tight into Dean’s skin and forcing him to stay put. Somewhere in his throat, he’s started to laugh at Dean’s panicked but ineffectual jerks of the head. Despite his words to Cas, it’s taking everything Sam has not to try and intervene, incorporeality be damned. Cas is practically vibrating at his side, desperate to act but powerless (in this half neutered, wingless state) to change the past.
“No,” Castiel admitted. “He gave me two black eyes and all he got in return was bruised knuckles.”
“What about you Dean?” He watched his older son in the mirror hopefully. But Dean only shrugged. John frowned in worry. It was normal; he always tried to tell himself. Dean was just a late starter. Hell, he should be glad. So many boys Dean’s age were out, making messes out of lives. It was normal, he told himself, that Dean was seventeen and had never shown an interest in any girl. It wasn’t normal, the stubborn part of his brain insisted. He’d seen the way girls looked at Dean – you could practically hear the sighs that followed him sometimes – but Dean never looked back.
“But I’m here now. We both are.”
Dean nodded in agreement, “He was home, heard us shouting. He still has no clue what’s going on. Uriel wanted to make sure I hadn’t ‘corrupted’ him,” he laughed bitterly, “I pretty much caved at that point.” He took a deep breath, finally admitting what he’d known for a while. “We have to leave don’t we?”
“Don’t worry about me Cas, I’ll cope with whatever they throw at me. If it’s easier you should just push it all on to me.”
Hael took over Uriel’s shadowing duties for the rest of the day. She walked him to his classes even when she was in a different one, depositing him at a desk that was always near someone she considered appropriate. She needn’t have bothered. He and Dean did not share anymore classes.
He doesn’t know how long this has been going on when Sam yawns. They both startle – Dean’s eyes jumping from his.
Both Hael and Dean had been rendered speechless at the outburst. The bitterness in Cas’ voice was almost too much for Dean. He wanted to reach out, to squeeze Cas’ hand. But he couldn’t of course, not while they here.
“Do you understand me?”
“So how you gonna save my poor soul?” he asked in mock desperation, dropping to his knees dramatically in the grass in front of Cas.
Then things get really weird.
“I agree.”
“Are you Castiel?” Charlie had taken to asking the question of every blue eyed, dark haired man that walked into Dean’s diner.
sorry for the long gap, it's gonna be like this from now on i'm afraid so i'm putting the chapters up in chunks rather than individually. Also, people are gonna be saying some pretty mean stuff in the next few chapters, lots of slurs so just be careful if that kind of stuff upsets you, this fanfic definitely isn't worth it don't worry
Hating himself for every word of but knowing he had to he said: “And thank you, for... for...saving me. From myself.”
“Dad, c’mon, I’m hungry.” He pulled at John’s arm.
“I wasn’t scared,” Dean huffed. “You just shocked me, runnin’ off like that.”
“They don’t seem to be able to hear us,” Cas decides to say instead of answering. “I suggest we wait until Dean leaves and try to follow him.”
“We decide what we want to do,” Cas says simply, well aware that it is anything but. “Do we move forward or stay where we are?” He hesitates, then plunges on. “And we also need to talk about Lucifer.”
Sound next: no screams (for now) just the vague, distant, rusty groaning of chains, vaguely malevolent crunches and splashes as he walks over piles and puddles of things he can’t yet see. Same as always.
“I’d like that,” he smiles. “Whatever we end up as, as long as it’s with you I’ll be happy,” he hesitates, unwilling to break the peaceful mood, but also unwilling to proceed on uncertainty. “I want to say one more thing, however. It’s not me trying to back out of this – it’s something I want us to be sure of.”
He wanted to speak to Dean once class was over, but Uriel grabbed him practically the second the bell rang. As he was pulled from the classroom he caught Dean’s eyes and gave a helpless shrug, receiving an amused smile in return.
Cas comes up beside them, hooking an arm around Dean’s waist and pulling him shakily to his feet. “What was he saying to you?” Cas asks. “The ghost?”
“What? No! I’m not – ” the words came out louder than he anticipated, were people staring?
here if you were winning.”
“Before Dad left he said I wasn’t allowed to let anyone in or out.”
“We already know what he saw. We don’t need the play by play.” Dean spat bitterly. And then, because he couldn’t help himself, “unless you’re into that?”
tired, exhausted even (God knows how Dean must feel – it was
“No… please…” the words fade into incoherence as Dean continues to cry.
Cas raises an eyebrow.
“I don’t know. But we can’t stay here.” He’s said, grabbing Castiel’s hand and pulling him away from the school. “We can’t wait for Dad, I don’t think I can be in a car with him.” His voice had cracked at the thought of John, and Sam
“Well…no”
“Look at me,” Demon Dean says contemptuously. “Look how broken and worthless you are. All because of that angel and that brother. Alistair was right and we both know it. We’ve always known it. All they’ve ever done is take, take, take: and you’re so broken that’s all you know to want. Dad, Sam, Alistair, Cas, what are they? Just someone stronger and smarter you attach yourself to until you’re all used up and bleeding and of no use to anyone anymore.”
“Why didn’t I notice this happening? Why didn’t I notice any of it?”
“So?”
“Hey now,” Jonah says in mock anger. “You been spying on me?”
Sam Winchester answered the door, still dressed in his Sunday best, several inches of ankle and wrist visible. He beamed at Jim, adoration on clearly visible in his face.
“Come on, I’m sure it won’t be
“What choice do I have?” Cas asked bitterly.
“Each of those and thousands more are sent to us every day to tempt us. The devil wants us covet, to lust, to abandon Christ the eternal in favour of the material. These faggots are no different. It ain’t natural, it ain’t a choice. They were tempted, and they chose to abandon God’s path in favour of Sin.
Sam shows up late the next morning with calorific breakfast that Dean takes as the “sorry I told Cas about the homophobic ghost so you’d talk about your feelings’’  peace offering it is. The three of them crowd round the ridiculously undersized table; Sam’s stupidly oversized elbows banging into Dean’s as they cut their pancakes.
“What did I just say?”
“What is it you want?”
Sam nods, stepping back to lean against the wall again and wishing distantly that his phone worked in the astral plain (he had checked earlier, with vague ideas of just phoning Dean, but there had been no signal and when he’d tried to touch the screen his finger had sank in a little like it were quick sand, making him loathe to repeat the experiment.)
“That’s…probably not good,” Sam sighs, turning to the remaining Dean, who shakes his head.
“Funny – that’s what you said last time too,” Alistair murmurs. He waves a hand, and the metal piercing Dean’s skin vanishes into smoke. The wounds, the blood, the hole in his chest, remain.
“Sam did,” she pointed out.
Dean’s grip on the steering wheel tightens.
“Wait,” Sam stops, “are you saying that Dean’s state of mind while he’s in his own mind is affecting the state of the mind that his mind is in?”
it be?”
“Yes.” Of course Dean had to say yes. He could put up with babysitters and sermons if it meant he could stay with Sam.
the pain will go away. I promise.”
“He vanished the same time you left,” Sam told him, “everyone assumed you two had run off together.”
“So he’s gone and Sam’s gone, just like mom,” there are tears trickling down the side of this face, Dean can remember them itching. “And now you want to leave too. You want to leave me here, alone.” The gun falls to the ground as Dean begins to cry in earnest once again, small hands covering his face.  “Please,” he whispers through them, “please don’t leave.”
“Hael’s a lovely girl,” He informed his son over dinner that night. “So pretty, and her family’s been with the church for years too. Looks like you’ve got a touch of the ol’ Novak charm in you after all”
But John refuses to relent, and instead of stepping he steps forward, forcing Dean into an even more precarious position than before: his legs squashed awkwardly against the lounger. Sam, with a look of pure rage eerily similar to his father’s, springs out of the pool and tries to pry John’s hand off. His fingers pass straight through, however, and neither John nor Dean appears to notice his efforts. He shoots Cas a worried look which Cas returns with one of his own. They’d been able to touch Dean in his other memories – the non-wet swimming pool is abruptly a bigger problem.
“I…” Dean’s eyes flick to the mirror briefly, then to Cas, then away again. “Fuck,” he says again, under his breath, looking down for a second. When he looks back up, his eyes flash. “Fuck it,” he says, louder. “I’m too fucking tired and I’m getting too fucking old to not say this,” he looks at Cas again and doesn’t look away.  “I’ve loved you for a long time. Probably from almost since we met. But I didn’t know till Purgatory.”
He barely recognised his friend. Castiel’s face was a hard mask of anger, he suddenly looked much older. His eyes, normally the warm blue of the sky, had hardened into ice. Dean took a step back as that gaze met his. “Cas?” was all he managed.
They were still talking about this? “Well...” the truth was Cas hadn’t listened to the broadcast, but he couldn’t admit that now. “Umm, I thought they were, uh, interesting. An unusual choice. ”
But Sam just waves towards the cemetery in front of them. “You’ll see,” is all he says.
Reluctantly, Cas twists his head round, then almost immediately brings it back to face the wall – it may just be the light, but his cheeks appear slightly pink. “There are no doors anywhere in this room,” he informs Sam, a little shortly. “Dean must not remember them – he is rather distracted after all and probably has other things on his mind.”
anything
It was a short drive to the house (everywhere was a short drive away here), no more than a few minutes. “Ok what’s the plan?” Dean asked as they pulled out of the car park. “Any ideas on how to make this not awkward?”
They had shifted closer, just like in the library. This time, however, there was no one to see them as they embraced. No one to see their lips meet for the third time. No one to see them sink onto the bed. No one to see Dean’s arms wrap around Cas; no one to see Cas’ hands cup Dean’s face.
Almost reluctantly, Dean shakes his head.
“And after that?”
“I didn’t raise no fucking queers, you hear me?” John veered dangerously across the road as he said it, his hands tightening on the steering wheel unconsciously. “I don’t know who the fuck you are, but you are not my son. Not anymore. My son is gone.”
“N-Never,” he chokes out.
a son to you: just an annoyance until you realised you could use me. Then I was your prop. The son of a Preacher man: quiet, respectful, obedient. You didn’t want a son you just wanted someone to stand behind your chair during photo shoots. You pretend to love and care. You pretend to know God when all you care about is yourself and your fame. You call
“Seriously, what the fuck am I doing here?” He wished Cas was here with him, despite how ridiculously, monumentally stupid that would’ve been.
“Who says…” Dean mumbles, his words trailing off.
“That’s the plan yeah. But what about you? What happened to you?” If it hadn’t been ten years since he’d seen Dean last, he would’ve noticed how his brother momentarily tensed, then deliberately relaxed. But it had been ten years, so Sam didn’t notice.
“True,” he admitted, “but that was a fluke.”
At the door, his father turned to face him. “Remember son, best behaviour”
Sam rubbed a hand angrily over his face, trying to dispel his tears. Dean didn’t say anything, but he did pull Sam into a tight, if somewhat awkward, sideways hug, ruffling his hair as he let go. They watched the clouds drift by in silence for a while: wispy white trails dwarfed by the all-consuming blue of the sky.
“Yes Dean.” Was all Cas had said, as they’d walked off.
Dean nods and pushes the blade deeper. Blood spurts and there’s pain – deep burning pain. Sam gasps involuntarily and Dean’s other hand clasps his arm – squeezing gently, a comforting counterbalance to the pain.
“Perfect,” Dean says, and kisses him again. And again.
Ah, so that was it. He didn’t care one bit whether  Castiel knew or cared about cars, this was all part of his Act, his character. Well if that was the role he was destined for so be it. He knew what would be expected of him if he left Mom’s, anything would be better than going back there, tail between his legs.
“Don’t look at me like I’m some kind of victim – I know that’s what you think of me.”
“Do you want one?” Jonah asks, holding one out between his fingers.
“No,” Dean replies – keeping his voice deliberately flat and monotonous. “For a while, after, it was all I could smell.”
“Dean,” Cas says urgently, “We’re trying to find our way out of here –”
Cas grabbed his hand, hard enough to bruise. “It will be. We’ve done nothing wrong” He could see the conflict in Dean, could see how strong he was trying to be, for Cas, and how fragile he truly was. “You’ve done nothing wrong, Dean.” His voice was full of conviction now, and Dean tried to believe him.
He’d kissed Castiel. Or Castiel had kissed him. Whatever. The fact was they’d kissed.
Dean breaks first, ducking his head, shoulders shaking. “I can’t bear the idea of you knowing,” he whispers, “if you didn’t know already. And I can’t bear the idea of asking – of knowing if you know.”
“I said
“I’m not sure I understand your definition of fun,” Cas says dubiously, even as he begins to loosen his tie. “I don’t know if this is appropriate.”
“What’s that supposed to mean?”
Alistair smiles knowingly, but nothing more. “Just how I’ve always preferred it,” he says. “I always do my best work when reality is more, hmm, relative.” Beside him, a razor materialises out of the mist, pushing at his hand impatiently. Alistair sighs. “Sadly, today is just a rerun – and I’m lagging behind. Got to stay on script. Still…” he takes the razor in his hand, brings it reverently to Dean’s chest.  “… You can’t beat the classics.” He presses down and the blood wells up, a river flowing down Dean’s skin. “I’m sure you remember what I’m going to ask you?” he purrs into Dean’s ear.
Dean sank to the ground, tears spilling onto his cheeks. “Cas,” he whispered to the air. “Cas where are you? Please. You have to tell me that Sam’s wrong. Where are you?”
“If you think you need to stay, then I’ll stay too.” Cas declared.
“No,” Dean’s voice is hoarse; as if he’s been screaming for hours – or days. Which he has. Hasn’t he?. He shakes his head, trying to remember. “This isn’t happening... it’s not real” he struggles against the bonds weakly, but Alistair's hands – almost tender – run through his hair, over his face, forcing him to still.
walked knowingly into a trap?” Dean winks at Cas and throws an arm around his own shoulders. “It’s good drama my young self, so sit back and enjoy the show.”
“Dean? Missouri? Did you find him?” He saw Dean’s face. “Dean!”
Dean ignored the envious look Sam shot him as left, he actually felt relieved. Now Sam wouldn’t have to know anything.
John was close to tears. “Thank you Jim, listen there’s something else as well,” he looked and the crowd still gathered around them and leaned closer. “But I was hoping we could talk about it in private. Maybe later?”
“Sam, c’mon, it’s me. You know I’m not a bad person.”
“S’ok. It killed me that I couldn’t do this earlier.” He’d pulled Cas’ face up towards him for a long, drawn out kiss. They’d gotten much better since their first awkward attempts; they’d gotten good at tuning the world around them as well. Too good, it turned out.
“Just because it’s not a lie doesn’t mean it’s true,” the younger Dean snaps from behind them – they all turn to stare,  nonplussed, and he stammers to explain. “Uh…Just because I thought it once doesn’t mean I think it now, y’know?”
“Where’d they come from?” Dean asked, thinking back to the rusty, temperamental signal of his childhood. “They look like fucking death stars.”
we're nearing the end now, but it might take a while for me to find the time to upload the rest of it now that i got classes and reading and such.
Dean. Not as the smiling boy from his childhood; not as the ominous, corrupting shadow from his youth or as the brother shaped hole in his family, but as the person he was now. Strange and foreign in some ways, warm and familiar in others.
“So you mean I don’t get to wait in the car until you’ve hidden the bullets?”
“I’m glad you didn’t have to go through it. I’m glad I could do that much. I meant what I said in there: as much as it hurts, and as much as I sometimes think you’re wrong, a part of me is always proud of you for leaving – for being able to think about after. About beyond me, beyond him, beyond mountains.” Dean says, wiping his eyes. “The weirdest part is that I still love him.” his voice cracks. “I still love him so much.”
“And for as long as we can make this last.”
“Charlie? Where’s my mystery man and wha–” Dean’s voice cut off mid-sentence as he caught sight of Sam.
“You know that’ll never happen. Listen, Dad’s more stubborn than you’ve ever been –” he held up a hand to forestall Dean’s interruption “– c’mon, you know that’s true. But he’s our Dad, and he still loves you, I know it. And I know
“Pity,” she informed him, “there’s a 10% discount for Castiels.”
“What did you say? Where is it?” Instinctively, Dean steps closer, placing a hand on his shoulder and shaking gently. At the touch, the figure goes berserk, his eyes snapping open and meeting Dean’s – filled to the brim with pure fear.
“Hey that’s not fair!” Sam objects. “I was
There is a drawn out, tense, cold second where all sounds except for Dean’s heavy breathing recede. The world around them darkens even further, the entire focus of the memory shrinking to John’s livid face – which remains lit and luridly coloured.
Cassie?” Dean hedges.
All too soon, they were pulling into his driveway. His father placed a hand on his shoulder and steered him through the front door.
“That’s not entirely true,” Dean had now become very interested in his own hands. “How’d you get out anyhow?” he asked before Cas could reply.
“Well what are we supposed to do?”
Cas knew he was supposed to go with his father. This time last week, he would’ve, but now he wanted to be as far away as possible from the man. “Yeah sorry, we were going to the library to, um, study.” He tried desperately to keep his tone casual.
“Look, we’ve already discovered where he’s buried,” Sam interjects hurriedly, almost as if he expects Dean to be angry that he’s been tricked into driving Cas towards a homophobic ghost. “And as far as we can tell he had no wife or kids or anyone that would hold onto his stuff so that more or less rules out the possibility of him being tied to an object. We get there, we smoke him and then we relax. It’ll be easy.”
“You really think he’ll listen?”
“Stop lying Castiel!” Jim slapped him hard across the face, breathing heavily.
“Humans will always be a mystery to me,” Cas muses, “and your brother is no exception: it turns out. I thought I knew him well, but really I only know a part of him. And such a small part. I had no idea that inside what I’ve seen he was so…big.” That’s not quite the right way to put it – and he gestures hopelessly at the space around him with the vague hope that it will convey the rest – that to be so surrounded by Dean is to somehow be so far from Dean.
a nasty little spell. Full of knots. And you’ve managed to get yourself all tangled up with it,” he grins a grin with too many teeth.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDXvzhnG3V4
“Not a side effect, no,” Cas frowns, casting about for the right word. “Really I don’t think it has much to do with the spell itself – more the actions the spell prompted.”
“I saw you two. Kissing.” Uriel seemed to expect some kind of reaction from them. “Each other.” He added, redundantly.
“Yeah,” Dean smiles shakily, and it’s
are not a step-down. And besides,” he smiles, “those words have no negative connotations for me: by the time I was familiar enough with human culture to feel the insults within them you had already shown me that they didn’t matter. I haven’t had a lifetime of abuse and shame to contend with, so the words of one lonely, vengeful spirit mean little to me.  You, on the other hand, have had a different experience, and admitting that won’t make you weak.”
He had only damned himself. Dean would be fine, as long Castiel didn’t condemn him further.  He would have to stay away. His heart ached at the thought, but it was for Dean.
at the back of everything: has that changed?”
“I don’t think that could ever happen to us.” He’d said.
“Whatever you do, don’t let go!” Sam yells over the din, his hands gripping Cas’ trench coat so hard it’s painful. He feels Cas doing the same – squeezing his arm to let him know he’s heard.
Dean closes his eyes again. “But I’m scared.”
Dean’s face crumples. “I can’t…I can’t do that Sam. I’m sorry.” He closes the distance between them – stopping just an arm’s length away. Some of the chains binding Sam dissolve into smoke – and he desperately brings his arm up to grasp Dean’s wrist – keeping the blade at bay.
Cas brushes gentle fingers over the slightly silver skin – a thin line on Dean’s bottom lip with a smooth patch underneath – no stubble. “I’m sorry I never noticed.”
“Christ.”
. Cas looks to Sam, who frowns.
“Meaning,” Cas mutters with a melancholic clarity, “That something is probably about to go wrong.”
“You’re right, what do you suggest we do?” Cas checked to make sure they really were alone, so he could keep a hold of Dean’s hand.
Keeping his eyes down, Sam made his way to counter and sat on one of the plush seats. A girl (she couldn’t have been more than sixteen) made her way over, pen and paper in hand, red curls bouncing. “Hiya, what can I get you today?” she asked cheerily.
Dean takes himself into his arms. He’s so fragile, like a baby bird, that’s he’s scared he may break himself. He remembers thinking the same thing about Sam (when he was young) and Cas (when he was human), painfully and intimately aware of all the ways he could hurt them.  Instead, he adjusts his grip and stands, kicking the fallen gun under the bed. “You’re not going to be alone,” he murmurs, “Not anymore. I’m going to take you with me.”
Jonah places the cigarette behind Dean’s ear, strokes a hand through his hair. “I wish you could stay,” he regards Dean with a resigned expression. “But something’s happening isn’t it – something big?”
“Guess I can’t be angry then,” Dean grunts. “Is it in the fridge?”
orders.” He shakes Dean roughly. “Answer me!”
“It’s Sunday morning, Dean.”
“Besides,” Dean interrupted. Under the table, he put his hand on Cas’ knee in an effort to take the sting out his words. “I can’t leave.”
“He wants to know if you’re handsome,” she explained, “I can’t really tell with guys. Are you?”
“You poor boy.” She whispered into his hair, pulling him closer. “You poor, brave, stupid, boy.”
“I never even let myself practice this,” Dean admits angrily. “I always kinda thought that, if it all ever came out (which it never would) I wouldn’t have to say anything.”
to read it before they declare it ‘ungodly’ like the last time...”
“Two memories are hardly a pattern,” Cas snaps. In two steps he closes the distance between him and Sam, grasping his arm and trying to drag him away. Reduced to and inexperienced with human strength, however, he makes little headway, and Sam shakes him off easily.
Every word cut into Dean like knives. He half expected to see blood welling on his arms, instead of the tears that were welling in his eyes. Gordon watched him struggle not to cry, enjoying the spectacle. How often had the older Winchester left him catatonic with rage? His constant snipes and comebacks had irked Walker to no end and it was satisfying to finally see him rendered speechless.
He forced his eyes open, squinting up to the figure above him. “Missouri?”
“Who else?” Dean grabbed his arm as they reached each other. Castiel looked around quickly to see who was watching.  There were a few figures in the distance. How much could they see?
“Castiel?”
“I don’t know,” Dean says in a small voice and suddenly he’s not in front of them anymore – he’s sitting on one of the beds, legs dangling off the side (too short to reach the floor). The gun is clutched tightly across his chest as he stares down the door. “He said that I had to: ‘keep Sammy safe’, ‘keep the door shut tight’ and that if anything ‘cept him tried to come in or out to: ‘shut my eyes and pull the trigger’”
“You shouldn’t be able to do this,” Dean insists angrily. “It’s not possible.”
“Exactly: you’ve seen him naked many more times than I have,” Cas says, sounding more like a petulant twelve year old than an ageless celestial being.
In the bright sunlight it takes Cas a second to orient himself. Even before his vision has cleared, his nose is inundated with a harsh, chlorinated tang – strong enough to make him cough. In the background, he can hear a faint splashing underneath the sounds of passing cars. As his eyes finally begin to pick out details from the colourful shapes around him, he realises he’s standing in a swimming pool.
“That’s the spirit,” Dean says cheerily from right beside them, and they both flinch back in shock. He’d made no sound as he’d moved.  He gestures to the rows of doors lining the hallway. “So, where do you wanna start?”
“Yes?”  Alistair smiles, widely. For a brief moment, his eyes become human again, shining with triumph. “Yes, what?”
“Like what?” Cas can feel a faint suspicion forming at the edge of his mind, but he ignores it – wanting to hear it from Sam.
“No.” He tried to convey strength he didn’t feel into the word. “We love each other. It’ll be enough. It has to be.” They were screwed otherwise.
“That’s amazing Cas,” Dean said. “What’d you study?”
Cas hurried away, still glowing from the new nickname. It seemed to separate him from Uriel’s group and their stupid, outdated names.
“Now you tell me – do you think Sam could’ve gotten so big if you didn’t do a good job?”
“You aren’t like him,” Sam says instantly. “
Noise and light slam into being: the ground beneath them jolting as a hundred pairs of table legs and stools meet the hard, pitted wood of the floor that has just sprung into existence. Walls rise up in a smooth motion, joining with a smoke-stained ceiling that fills the space above them. Sam has to jump to one side as a low hanging lampshade drops down – it’s sickly yellow bulb flickering slightly. On the newly erected walls, windows, posters and dartboards emerge organically from the dirty paint – designs and numbers emerging, then melting into indecipherable smudges. On the windows, stained glass flowers grow and then shrink into diamonds and the fade into nothing before blooming again. Behind the glass, dirty orange streetlights flicker on and off.
He reached the bank where he, Sam and Cas he skimmed stones. His feet were cold, he’d forgotten his shoes.
Cas was trying not to lose his balance and fall on top of Dean. He was slightly smaller than the blond boy, and had to reach up. It was causing his legs to shake slightly and he didn’t know how long he could keep this up.  He felt Dean pull back, his breath was warm on Cas’ cheek, and the two split apart. Frustrated at their own incompetence, they sat side by side, backs against the wall.
“Then it will be up to John and Jim as to what they do to you. Do we have a deal?”
“You guys are taking too long,” he says angrily.
Everywhere their skin is touching she can feel him or his power, humming beneath her fingers, beneath her mouth. His fingers brush against her scalp, and she can’t help but shiver a little at the jolts of pleasure it sends through her body. Something about the feeling is familiar to her. She wonders (distantly) if it’s his grace causing them or if that’s what it always feels like when you want someone this badly. She can’t remember the last time she was touched there, or the last time she actively desired someone else with such undeniable need. Cas’ fingers trail down the back of her neck and she gasps, turning her head to the side so she can kiss the line where his jaw becomes his neck, and then moves downwards until she hits the top of his shirt collar.  The thick cotton is all wrong, and it makes her hyper aware of her own clothes, still frustratingly on her body. She forgets for a second because Cas is kissing her again, but soon they become too in-the-way to ignore.
“I think Dean might’ve been drunk,” Sam replies, still looking around. It’s a bar, that much is certain, but it doesn’t look like any bar he’s ever been in. Parts of it – the cracked red leather of the seats, the old fashioned jukebox in the corner, a particularly grumpy bartender with a ridiculously long grey beard – are things he thinks he might remember: but from states, years and lives apart. “Hey, does any of this look familiar to you?”
Dean doubted he would be able to catch Cas before the service began, but afterwards, when people had begun to disperse, they might get a few moments of privacy.
Cas nods. “That sounds good.”
“How did you find me?” he murmured into Cas’ shoulder. “How on fucking earth did you find me?”
The sound of a shotgun loading has them all spinning round.  For a moment, the three of them stare blankly at the empty space in front of them, before a small voice has their heads turning downwards.
“I’m about an hour or so away…just let me get my shit together and I’ll meet you at that diner we spotted... no I’m not gonna shower…well I don’t care if you don’t wanna smell it… If you get there first order me some pancakes…Seriously? You’re gonna order salad for breakfast? Yeah, fruit salad is still salad,” he shakes his head. “Whatever dude. See you soon, ok?” he snaps the phone shut, looks around and frowns. “Where’s Jonah?”
Dean, amazingly, foolishly, laughs. “That’s all you’ve got?” he asks incredulously. “It might look suspicious? It’s
Dean had been rendered almost speechless by this. “Cas, what? I can’t ask you to do that, you should go somewhere safe. Find a family.”
“Do you wanna do it?” Dean asks Sam. “Or should I?”
Not long after, Dean’s snores join his brother’s – leaving Cas alone with the rumble of the engine. The three tones – slightly dissonant but still in time with each other – strike him as basically the same. He’s never really understood Dean’s insistence on treating the impala as if it’s alive, but now he thinks he gets it. “Thank you,” he murmurs. “For keeping them safe – both of them.”
,” He hissed. “If you don’t turn around and walk out right now, alone,” he picked up the receiver, “I’m gonna call Pastor Novak and the Walkers and whoever else I can get a hold of and we’ll deal with you once n’for all. You are not to come near me or my family again or I will kill you. You understand me?”
He’d kissed Cas then, not caring how loud they were.  Jim, John and Uriel could’ve walked in at that moment and he wouldn’t of cared. He loved Cas, Cas loved him. That was all that mattered.
“What’s left of me at least.”
“This is,” he says.
“Dad, are you ok?” Sam’s nervous voice forced him back to the present, and he followed it to the kitchen, leaning against the doorframe. John was by the fridge, beer in his hand, his face still unreadable.
:  there’s no one left to care. It’s ok for you to be proud of who you are and to be a part of this community.” Sam gestures towards a rainbow flag. “I’m not going to abandon you or think any less of you if you do. I don’t care if you’re gay, or bi or queer, you’re my brother and that’s all that matters. That’s all that’s ever mattered.”
“I thought I said you didn’t need to wait up,” Dean frowns.
Eager to make his brother understand, Dean cast about for the right words. “I
hang in there with me, i'm about to start uni but i'm gonna try to actually finish this
The bus pulled up in front of him. “Where to kid?”
“Except for that last one,” Dean counters. “That wasn’t even a memory. Not really. More a…compilation. Or a representation?”
“Not as far as I’m aware,” Cas says, a little affronted. “And I would appreciate it if you didn’t try to derail the conversation.”
Sam let her pull him into the easy conversation, with Dean occasionally supplying his own titbits from the side. Slowly, under Missouri’s masterful guidance, the flow of conversation eased in the direction of the older Winchester.
Dean fell silent, head reeling. It would be so easy to pretend, to fake remorse, to ‘repent’ so that everything could go back to normal. But the very thought of it, of going back to the fake life and the fake feelings made him want to die. He couldn’t live a lie, not again.
“It’s not your fault.”
“Make it stop,” Dean is sobbing in now – tears making pink streaks on his bloodied face. “I can’t do this anymore.”
The details of the classroom likewise slipped from his mind. It looked like every other classroom he had ever been in. There was still five minutes until the bell rang, and teenagers clustered together, talking loudly.
“You’d never be happy again. You’d have to live a lie forever and you’d never be from suspicion.” Missouri met Dean’s defiant glare levelly.  “Are you ready for that Dean? Are you ready to ignore every fibre of yourself: to suppress every urge, every thought? Are you ready to find some bloodless girl who’ll ignore or overlook what they whisper about you? Are you ready for years of loveless marriage, never truly able to connect with anyone meaningful again? Are you ready to abandon Cas? Are you ready to abandon life?” Her voice was heavy with pain and anger, her eyes clouded with tears.
“But we did nothing wrong!” Cas protested indignantly. Dean remained silent through all of this, and Cas was beginning to worry.
They had been walking as they talked, and soon reached the house. Dean looked around curiously. He had never been in a  Pastor’s home before, it was strange to imagine Jim anywhere but the church.
3 in 1...
From the tone of Gordon’s voice, he could tell he was winding down. The crowd, which had murmured somewhat in bewilderment beforehand, broke into applause. It wasn’t the screaming adoration they reserved for Jim, but it was enough that Gordon was justified in his smug smile as he stepped down.
“Stay back,” says the small child at their feet, his face pale yet determined. He clutches the shotgun in tiny hands and, though it must be heavy, his arms don’t shake as he aims it towards them. Nervous eyes dart between them and the cot. Behind him, the door (
“Pretty good – she likes him,” he taps the steering wheel affectionately, “don’t you baby?”
Cas paused at the question, one hand already on the door knob. “What?”
“I still don’t trust this,” Cas mutters. “He just wants to get us more lost.”
“Did Lucifer?” Dean asks, curious.
He gave up on names early on. They were all biblical, like his, and old biblical at that. Hael, Raphael, Ezekiel. He wondered if they resented their names, as he always had. In among the Joes and Peters of his old life, Castiel had sounded pretentious and dated. Here, however, there were so many of them, that they sounded elevated, almost holy.
“Yup. Every single time. They seem to think if they do it often enough I’ll just give up or something and let the books rot.”
“To satisfy my curiosity,” Lucifer shrugs. “It occurred to me that, we’ve never really spent much quality time together – in this timeline anyway. I barely know you.”
“I just wanted to say I’m sorry. We’re all sorry.” She indicated the group standing awkwardly a little further away.  “We didn’t know what was going on, if we’d realized we would’ve tried to help, but we let you be dragged down by that – ”
asshole.”
“Turn around,” Sam hisses. “Now!”
The car trundles down a dirt pathway, rolling past dark trees. The beams from the headlights pick out a break in the leaves – a black lake visible beyond them – the tops of the waves just illuminated by the weak moonlight.
“It’d be reckless of us to let a known faggot roam free.” Ezekiel added.
“I love you,” Dean told him when they broke apart at last. “I need you. Please tell me you can stay.”
want to Cas, and that’s enough for now.”  At the barriers, a group of elderly ladies are shouting at the woman, gesturing rudely in her face, one of them catches his eye and winks at him, waving him on. “Besides,” he smiles, “maybe this isn’t so bad after all.”
“At what?”
“Ok,” he relents, noting that both Sam and Cas’ shoulders sag with relief. “But if you get so much as one speck of glitter anywhere on your body you’re walkin’ home. I ain’t riskin' my baby.”
Cas walked slowly, and arrived at the library just as it opened. He could feel the weight of the past few days lift of his shoulders as the small building came closer and closer. Aside from seeing Dean, assuming Dean could get away, he would be glad to see Missouri. It would be nice to see a friendly face again.
“Wait for what?”
“Well, clearly you were listening: at least we know
“No you ain’t,” Jim told him, gesturing for him to come forward. “I got somethin to tell you, come here.”
Castiel had been worried how Dean would react to his new “mission” but the other boy took it in his stride.
“John,” he said warmly. “How’ve you been?”
“Yeah: she hasn’t seen the diner yet
He led Sam to a corner booth, sliding onto one of the benches. Sam slid into the opposite seat. He could sense, practically see, the unanswered questions in Dean’s face and decided, in true Winchester fashion, to ignore them. “This is a nice place,” he said instead.
“Seriously?” Dean said in disbelief. “I swear she used to be blonde.”
“That’s what I thought,” Lucifer sighs in mock disappointment. “You know, I’ve been in both your brother and your angel now and it’s just
Castiel jumped to his feet. He was shaking. “I’m sorry. This was a mistake.” Was all he said. Then he was gone, running  away from the grass, away from Dean.
“Not my finest moment,” Sam agrees.
Now, to god fearin’ folks like you and me the message is clear. The Lord knows what’s right, it is the lord who decides, and it's in his judgment that we must trust. But folks, to many people that just ain’t the case anymore. The spirit of Sodom is alive to this day. You know who I’m talking about...they like to call themselves “homosexuals”. Sounds nice and scientific right?” he slammed his hand down onto the podium suddenly and the congregation jumped.
“Because of my Dad?”
Dean Winchester. The Righteous Man who triggered my release…” Dean’s eye twitches but otherwise he portrays no outward sign of emotion. Lucifer smirks anyway and continues. “…and who fought so hard and – I hate to say it but credit where credit is due – so effectively against me during my last little trip out.”
“I understand that. But think about it. We’re graduating at the end of the year. You’re smart Cas, book smart, like Sammy. I’ll bet you can get into college, any college. That gives you an out that doesn’t end with you in some alley somewhere. It’ll just take time is all.”
“You think Sam needs some dirty faggot for a brother?” The words jarred with his calm tone and that somehow made them worse.  “All you can do is drag him down with you.”  John’ face was blank again, his eyes focused on the wall.
“It should be easy. Tonight, say to Pastor Novak that you want forgiveness. Just tell him what he wants to hear the most, put all the blame on me, call me a demon if you think he’ll buy it.”
(See the end of the chapter for
As far as most people were concerned, Dean was already damned.
Castiel jumped at the call, involuntarily turning towards the noise. The very first think he registered was the happiness in Dean’s expression.  This only added to the confusion already churning inside him.
merging with you and reflecting your emotions. Soon, however, it should begin to manifest more…concretely: try to oppose us more directly. Fortunately, however,” he adds, looking at Dean, “since we’re in here  with you, we should be able to figure out where in your subconscious the exit is located relatively easily.”
“How can you not know if you’ve broken my brother’s heart?”
“Yes,” Cas’ tone is serious but his eyes are twinkling, “I’ve heard it draws on ancient and powerful magic that allows you to know others’ innermost thoughts and desires.”
No such luck. “You got home awfully late last night son: surely the queue weren’t that big?”
The kid’s eleven; he can take care of himself for a while: god knows the dork needs friends his own age, and god knows I deserve some time to myself.”
“Whatever you make him do, it won’t matter. We win.” There’s a flicker of smugness, even under all this fear, and Sam grabs onto it desperately – trying to project it outwards.
“I went home, or I tried to. Uriel was there, along with some friends. They weren’t pleased to see me.” Dean shrugged, trying and failing to act casually. “They wanted to teach me a lesson or something. Punched me in the face,” he pointed to the bruise on his face “Knocked me down, got a few kicks in too. Eventually they got bored I think.”
“Yeah, me too,” Dean nodded. “I’ll go home tomorrow,” he saw Cas’ face, “during the day.” He rushed to reassure him.  “I’m not that dumb. I’ll grab some clothes, some stuff I can sell.”
Dean screams (Cas and Sam joining him) as his heart is wrenched from its position, arteries and veins straining futilely to hold it in. One by one, they give way with horrifying snaps and jets of blood. Alistair brings the still sluggishly beating heart up close, examining it dispassionately.
“I think it was beautiful.”
“Older. My parents both work, so it’s mostly just us.”
“I literally
His eyes (not his eyes,
“Do you ever think about anything that’s not my fucking father?”
Sam shakes his head. “No, god no. I’ll do it it’s just…give me a sec,” Sam pauses, gathers his thoughts and, with a visible effort, speaks. “You know when we were um…well, after Gadreel – y’know?”
“Huh,” Dean grunts, “so you’re saying that we’ll have to search through my memories and shit in order to find the door back to reality but that the spell is likely to try and throw up distractions and barriers in order to keep us trapped in here for as long as possible and cause as much pain and division as possible?”
“Bullshit. I
and thus she returneth.
“It’s all my fault,” his father ignored him. “I haven’t been there for you, I was too prideful. I didn’t notice that you’d been pulled off the righteous path.” He was muttering to himself, or to God perhaps. “What do I do lord?”
Cas couldn’t help but snicker, and felt Hael’s anger burn into him. “I think you’re being disrespectful  to the Pastor, Dean,” she said airily. “Don’t you agree, Hester? Castiel?”
“There is no understanding a boy like that,” Uriel hissed, as if he were talking about some kind of ghoul instead of a teenager.
“I do Bobby, but it’ll be fine,” Dean smiles weakly. “See you on the other side.”
“Like you’re one to talk,” Dean pants, spitting more blood onto the ground without looking away. “What did you come here anyway? What do you want?”
“You’re still young Son,” Jim was watching him with a strange expression. “You still think we can save everybody.”
“It’s something I never thought I could have,” Dean admits. “Not after everything I’ve done, everything I’ve been through it’s…”
Sam was already in bed, thankfully. Dean made for their room when a rough hand on his shoulder stopped him.
(See the end of the chapter for
A snort of laughter from Dean had brought emotion back into her voice. “Oh, you may be going to church again but you’re still an arrogant, petulant, disrespectful –”
“He won’t be able to just get away anymore.” Missouri’s reminded him softly, watching his gaze dart from the clock to the door every few minutes. “His dad’ll be keeping a close eye on him; and he’s gonna have to play along for as long as he can.”
