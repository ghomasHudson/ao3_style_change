Cas agreed "Yeah, bye, Dean."
Cas had the instructions in hand "Why does this have to be so difficult?"
Cas came first, his thrusts becoming erratic as he started to cum, moaning out "Dean" his eyes were dotted with stars.
Dean lifted up his leg using it as a guitar.
"Someone is eager," Dean laughed, letting Cas take control.
He remembered my name?
Sam, Eileen, Ellen, Jo, Ash, Bobby, and Benny have all come to visit Cas in the hospital to see how he's been doing. Dean was grateful for them to have done so, caring for Cas and his health.
Dean ran out leaving his husband to help her up "Cas, this really hurts" the pain was so bad she felt tears forming in her eyes.
Dean followed him "Okay."
Dean didn't have news about their friend "Cas got hit by a drunk driver"
"Yeah" Cas nodded "I am just so confused lately."
Dean groaned into his neck, lifting his head up to face the boy "I could do this all night"
And with that Cas set the movie up on Netflix so that it would be ready to play by the time the pizza gets here.
A guessing game?
She didn’t even look up from her phone “that’s fine” she mumbled
Cas followed his lead climbing out to be met with a slight wind.
“Excited about this year?” Castiel questioned before taking in a spoon full.
lonely in our bed
“I know, but I want to be here, I can be glad it is Friday.” It was only for six hours and then they are free for the next two days as they entered the building full of students.
Charlie cut off his sentence seeing the one the next one he pointed out "Slice of pizza."
Oh God and he
Dean ran his way up from the garage, rushing through the living room and up another flight of stairs and towards the guest room not even knocking.
Cas shrugged as he continued walking. Charlie had a question pop on her head "You saw the video, but have you asked Dean how he proposed to you?"
She then said “I’m head cheerleader and very flexible”
"Oh, you fucking got to be kidding me" Dean groaned to himself, gripping at his beer glass.
"It is a night that is impossible to forget," Cas had one hell of a good time "you looked beautiful in your black gown."
Cas understood, but informed Dean "I do know sign language" he was interested in such a thing since he was a kid and grew up practically teaching himself through books and videos.
Dean got out his wallet, "I got it" putting their items together, giving her his card "Yes, you introduced me to her after our third date and we became friends."
"I want to remember the memories I lost. I want to know if I loved my life." He didn't want to start over, he had to remember.
That got her to smile wide “You so love me, Cas.”
Cas didn’t know what to say “I mean I guess so.”
"Want to watch another movie?" Dean lazily asked his brother, being sprawled out on his couch.
Dean and Castiel’s lives turn upside down for the better when their worlds collide.
Charlie:
Dean nodded. He pushed his rolling chair back a little for Cas to let go of him. Cas watched while Dean took off his shirt, on his chest was two big scars that ran across his six pack. "Remember you asked me how I got these scars and wouldn't answer you?"
“I never actually read those” he admitted, sounding interested “I always wanted to.”
"Oh" she giggled a little making something up "I got moved to this hospital this morning actually. I am still interning, but you're my best friend of course I insisted on you being one of my first patients in this hospital."
Dean finally looked in the direction that Jo was looking in. Sure enough, he saw her sit at a table with friends. Some he recognized from high school, some he did not. He shrugged it off “Yeah she is back apparently.”
"Is he okay?" Sam hoped, since he did make it through a successful surgery.
"Right, sorry," Castiel should've known that was obvious.
"I would like that" Cas followed her to the kitchen for her to put on the kettle.
“Who’s that handsome man you were talking to?” She questioned him with a raised eyebrow
In fright Uriel fell off the bed with a loud thump.
That caught Channing’s attention “Dean? That new hot teacher everyone is talking about? Where?” she hasn’t seen him yet. Looking around, she only saw Mr. Shurley walking the halls.
"Great, let me get what I need." Meg had good scissors in a draw
"Who are you? Why am I here" he breathed out confused why two strangers were here he never seen? Are they his doctors or something?
"Absolutely it's our little secret" Charlie also told him sarcastically.
Jo, who worked at her mother's bar, came over "Hey boys."
Right away their eyes locked for a moment. Cas caught him looking at him before he took a sip of his coffee and went straight back to his book.
From the feel of Castiel's hands on him, Dean rocked his hips forward into Cas with their cocks swaying against one another, having the Cas moan out "Mmmm" something Dean couldn't get enough of hearing.
"Oh sorry" Cas apologized, he didn't know
"Cas?" Dean grabbed onto him before he could slide off the car, knowing a memory was coming back.
"Apparently some drunk driver t-boned him and his car flipped over, knocking him out," he could hear how upset she sounded, Charlie and her were the best of friends.
"Yeah" Dean answered
“Remember the conversation we had in the morning?” Sam hoped he remembered.
"I am twenty-one" Cas was that age ten years ago he is now thirty-one.
Dean sadly nodded not saying anything.
Lisa couldn’t wipe the smile on her face “Yes, I am a math teacher. What are you doing here?”
“I want to know what happened.” Dean insisted. He was really good at reading people and could see Cas was a punching bag to some ass whole kids at this school.
“How are you awake?” she asked, rubbing her eyes
"Says you" it wasn't her choice to make "at least Dean supports it."
Anger was bubbling up inside him, he couldn't stand the sight, leaving the room.
"Oh," Dean didn't want to talk about her "what about her?"
She tried to wiggle out but he is way too strong.
Castiel sighed, spinning my spoon around the milk “We’ll see, Charlie”
Mr. Winchester or Dean explained what they would be doing today as they were going to work on a small machine before working up to bigger ones.
"Were you nervous?" Cas wondered; he'd be if he had to ask him.
When he felt fresh and clean, Cas found his way back downstairs to the dining room that looked set up for two people with no Sam or Eileen in sight.
She was never going to let that go? This doesn’t help his situation “Charlie, stop calling him that!”
"I can't," he didn't want to leave Cas.
Dean didn't have an answer "I don't know. What I do know is that I let my frustrations get the best of me I practically threw him into her arms," Dean through his head sighing.
Channing cut in before anyone could answer “I haven’t seen him yet. Is he really as hot as everyone is saying?”
"Yes"
“Hey” Cas got a little defensive “I wasn’t flirting” he really wasn’t. Cas only asked him a question.
Castiel wasn’t given in just yet “Let me go to homeroom first so I don’t get marked absent then I will go.”
Cas was unable to do his usual head tilt, due to the pain “Why are you sorry? You didn’t hit me.”
"I did, didn't I?" Cas remembered that "I hope you didn't have too much fun without me"
“Doubt it.” Castiel didn’t believe it would happen as they entered the nurse’s office.
Charlie was by his side, waiting for her friend to come back to reality.
We could do revenge, revenge, revenge
Castiel didn't answer as he slammed the door.
"I figured" She responded "But why?"
Meg fought back "I pushed him to do the right things to make good money and be the man he should be. You pushed him into something he's not! You got it all wrong"
"Sure." Dean stood up as they walked to the elevator.
Cas was outside by the time Dean was able to catch up to him "Cas!"
"Yes"
"Tomorrow it is."
"What's the problem?" She didn't get why he was laughing.
"He's out of jail way sooner than he is supposed to be and he's working at the hospital that you go to" Dean finally told him.
Charlie wanted to mentally slap herself “You totally have the hots for our teacher.”
"You don't understand," Dean shook his head "She's not good for you especially with your injury. Why would you want to be around her? Do you remember Uriel?"
Ut oh.
What??? How?
"You are in love with Meg" His mother spat, her voice rising.
Cas leaned down closer to her before she could say anything else "Yes you can. One more and it will all be over and we can hold him. Do it for me. I know you can!"
"Yeah her out of my life next," Cas sighed heavily.
“Hmm?” Dean said followed by a yawn.
Cas took his attention away from the tv "Oh does he?"
Cas smiled small as he followed Dean to see the kitchen, two bathrooms, laundry room, and Castiel's office before going upstairs to four bedrooms, five bathrooms.
Sam looked to his brother confused. Why would he ask who they were?
Ding ding
A big sigh of relief escaped both men.
“More like the King of Hell” Kevin whispered only for them to hear.
He loved his job, he really does, but the worst part is having to travel from time to time being away from Dean. He was giddy to see his handsome husband, kiss him, and to be intimate.
Since it has been a week, Dean hasn't left his side, hasn't gone to work, barely ate unless Sam brought him something, or barely even slept. He was afraid if he left the room, he would miss something that could go wrong or miss Cas waking up.
"Such a liar" Meg clearly hated Dean.
Cas was distracted as well, because of the pain on his face, the new pain on his arm, yet the good that he felt when Dean grabbed him. Why did he like it?
Dean was trying to stay calm, his blood boiling inside his body. "Thanks for letting me know."
“Yeah but I’m tired” she growled laying down again
"How long does it last?" Sam wondered, was it forever?
Oh boy did she have it all wrong "He doesn't need fixing! He needs his memories back besides it's Castiel's choice. You came back into his life for him to realize he shouldn't have let you back in. If you think he wants you why do you think he ran off after kissing you? He told me he didn't like it. He then kissed me and I didn't want to stop. Who does Cas want?"
"No, you are not"
“Jerk.”
Hell no that won't
Dean's eyes practically lit up seeing him "Morning, Cas. How did you sleep?"
~~~~~~
Why would be do such a thing "I could never"
"So, tell me why were you here that night?" Cas started, not knowing why.
Cas found himself in a 67 Chevy Impala; Dean’s car. Dean was driving them someplace. “So, where are we going, Dean?” He wondered
“Are you sure?” his friend just wanted to make sure.
Smack
Dean lost track of time, down in his garage putting on the last new shiny rim on the wheels of his beloved 'Baby' 67 Chevy Impala. He was so focused he barely noticed that his phone had been buzzing constantly in the last five minutes.
He forcefully pushed her off of himself "What the hell?"
"I can get you something for that," Charlie slid off the bed, walking towards the door "and I need to get your doctor, so he can run some tests. You probably need a minute."
Dean came back into the car to show Cas he had a box of all tiny bit sized flavored pies.
42 26 31
Mythology – Mr. Shurley Rm 235 (By Himself)
Dean couldn’t argue with that he could picture it “But yeah, Sammy I will help you.” He knew Sam would do the same for him someday, if he could ever find someone to ever settle down with.
Cas actually insisted on going here tonight not that Dean minded. "So, tell me why you wanted to be here?"
Hey Sexy,
As much as I
Great about what?
"How old are you?"
Now she needed their attention.
He didn’t even look at her “What?”
Dean found himself in his living room, with the remote in hand looking up movies on Netflix when Sam came back with the two large hot pepperoni pizza's in hand, placing it on to the coffee table, plopping himself down onto the couch to get comfortable "what are we watching?"
“Cassie, this is adorable. You have a crush on a real person” She honestly couldn’t wait to tell their other friends.
Cas watched her make a disgusted face at the mention of Dean "And that's another thing! Ever since you met this Dean you changed!"
Adding more pain to the pain he already has, Cas saw stars as he fell back, his vision becoming blurry, and almost losing his balance. Luckily, Charlie was there to keep him on his feet before falling and making a big scene in the hallway in front of many people.
this morning
"Come in" Dean sure as hell didn't want to, but Cas grabbed him anyway. He struggled to let go, but Cas is stronger than him.
Dean kissed him
The girls were too busy just smiling at him, which of course confused Castiel “What?”
Dean felt a presence in the room trying to see Cas in a different outfit "you look good, Cas" turning off the faucet.
"It's the thrill of the fight."
"I learned that from the pizza man?" he watched porn for some experience since he had nothing else to go off of.
"Shit" Jack repeated himself like it was nothing.
Castiel pulled off his seatbelt, asking “You want me to go to work on a day off?” not that he minded.
"Ugh, yes!" Cas was arching his back on the couch, jerking himself off in Dean's mouth.
“Thanks”
"Castiel sweety, hi," She smiled towards her son.
Charlie stepped in to help him of course to get Castiel onto his feet, but didn’t let go just in case he lost his balance.
“What?” that came out a little louder than he wanted.
"I'm married," He shot back, being faithful even if he doesn't remember.
"Yes, you can" Dean has been dying to kiss his husband, he missed doing so "but just so you know you never have to ask me just do it."
"This isn't like a broken bone brains are less predictable. It seems that due to the swelling tissue pressed against the skull it caused some impact." It was something nobody could control.
"It was when I caught her cheating. I think I finally remember what a cold-hearted, lying, cheating, bitch Meg is."
“Huh?” Castiel snapped his head back to his friends “Sorry, what?”
Dean sighed "Because they don't want to make our lives easy" trying to screw two different parts together tightly.
Cas looked at him confused and taken back "You are not bothering me. I want to help you and I can't help if you don't tell me. Please tell me" Cas used his free hand to caress Dean's face.
"What did we do?" Cas was happy they were finally getting somewhere.
Sam took it from him, no problem as he stood up "Sure." Before turning around to answer the door.
It was bad timing to take in another bite as he almost choked on the cereal. Having to take a nice breather to get the cereal to swallow properly, he asked her “What?” wiping his mouth from the milk.
The door opened followed by a voice “Sorry I’m late I had to speak to the principal for a moment” the voice was slightly deep as it shot through Castiel as it did the class, well the girls. Everyone grew silent turning their attention the person the voice belonged to.
"He was upset last night," Sam figured Steve should know, as he opened the front door. Cas didn't have his key.
She must have told her the address too "I see so that bitch called to tell you that Cas has forgotten all about me having you praise Jesus that your son forgot he's actually gay"
"Are you hungry at all?" It was getting close to dinner time.
"I don't want to bother you." Cas wouldn't remember this anyway.
Dean:
supposed to lose his license
For that comment, the older Winchester turned up the volume to bother his little brother “What? Sorry I can’t hear you!”
“You yawned causing me to yawn”
"Hey Charlie?" Cas was confused about some more things.
“Stay for a few minutes.” Dean leaned on his desk “I need to speak to you.”
Fine he won’t say anything this time, but Dean sure would keep an eye out.
Seeing them stare down each other, it was making Cas feel uneasy "Uh, Meg maybe you should go and I'll see you sometime soon? I kind of want to see what I can make for Dean when he gets home."
“Yup!” Castiel smiled. He did admit that he did like going to those. It was fun to dress up and go to a place not being afraid to be geeky.
"Cas, are you okay?" The light was green, but Dean didn't move, he had to see how Cas was doing
"Are you ready to go?" Dean couldn't wait to get the date started.
Castiel's eyes grew wide, he heard 'shit' not the other word "He said the f word?"
Dean heard a loud bump of a noise coming from upstairs, so like any other person who would do, he ascended the staircase to figure out what that was. Another bump sounded. Dean turned towards their bedroom. The sound came from there? Is Cas home? Is he okay?
“Castiel, you need to see a nurse.” Mr. Rollen saw blood dripping down his nose and it was starting to swell.
"Lube and a condom?" Dean came prepared "yes in the glove compartment."
"Hey, Sammy" Dean greeted, glancing to see that Sam was alone, no Eileen by his side "Where is Eileen?"
Dean had a smirk on his face “I know a place” being spontaneous.
Castiel couldn’t keep my eyes off him, not noticing that every other girl in the room besides Charlie and Dorothy were practically drooling at the sight of their new teacher.
"Dean, please"
She smiled small as she sat down on the bed. Charlie relieved in a way that he at least remembered her, but his math was off, they knew each other for twenty-one years.
"Castiel Jimmy Novak, will you marry me?"
This caused Castiel to trip almost hitting the floor when he bumped into someone breaking his fall.
“Yes” Cas answered.
Cas found himself back to reality, Charlie becoming unblurry and looking worried "that was a strong memory."
"Really?" Cas may have been informed that he doesn't talk to his mom anymore, but she used to make the best lasagna "Well I'll be the judge of that."
way with me
Dean:
The rest of our "Day of fun" they literally laughed at nothing having the same sense of humor just enjoying our time together walking around some more.
Charlie let out a big sigh, before coming up with what to say, but Cas cut her off.
for good behavior. They
He will probably make it home by 9 - 9:30 tops depending if there is any type of traffic, hopefully they would still be awake.
"We really are married," he really has a life he doesn't know about.
like you used to it shouldn't
“Why do you get to be captain?” Meg rolled her eyes
Regrettably Dean pulled away from Cas too soon. “How was that for you?”
"Dean," she shot back towards him.
Sam slowly rose from the couch to stretch "Yeah I know. See you later" as he walked away and towards the large staircase where the guest room waited for him.
Charlie shook her head "No, for me, Cas! I ended up getting some. I wish I remember her name, but I hooked up with one of Eileen's bridesmaids. Dam she was good in bed."
Stepping outside it was a very beautiful, cool night. Cas looked up at the stars that filled the sky. It was always such a beautiful sight to see at night.
“No, the nurse told me it is just a sprain and to keep icing it as much as possible until the swelling goes down.” Cas told him, wanting to go closer, but he didn’t let his feet move. “But we were playing dodge ball. Got hit all over at once, but my face got hit the hardest” as everyone could tell.
They looked towards him "Cas?"
She could have almost dropped her ice cream "Yes, oh my God yes! Of course, I'd be honored to do this for you guys!" She loved them so much, and would do anything for them.
"Hey Sam," Steve greeted back, glad to see him and to see he isn't pissed at him for getting into an argument with his brother "yeah I thought I just needed to refresh."
"He drove you away tonight, so who cares" Meg groaned, getting out two mugs.
"You always were eager to have your way with me" Dean smiled big towards him.
Meg kissed his neck causing Cas to moan.
“Hmm?” Cas was stopped short in my tracks, confused, his head tilting.
"A year" Meg shrugged
"What?" She knew about that?
Castiel gripped onto his locker door with the feel of his legs turning to jelly.
"Charlie said when that happens to take Ibuprofen" Dean told him.
"And you what made you wanting to be a mechanic?" Cas wondered.
Dean got so angry, he turned around to smack the lamp off the side table of the couch, sending it flying across the room only to startle Sam and Eileen who witnessed some of that conversation.
You have no idea
Cas chuckled getting in.
"Get on all fours" Cas groaned, ready for this, beyond turned on by this point, his cock practically aching for him.
Dean put his car in drive “where to?”
"I am also kind of hungry," Cas felt his stomach grumbling for food "Did you eat?"
He, Dean, Sam, and Eileen were all here, who could be ringing the doorbell. "The doorbell just rang"
“It happened in gym.” Cas thought he said that already.
As Dean was walking around the room, giving pointers and comments on his student’s work, he made his way over to Cas. He could see Cas was struggling a bit, his hands shaking using the tools. He bent down a bit, speaking in almost a whisper “Cas? Are you okay?”
Sam was looking not at Dean but Cas.
He jumped off the car, a little shy from the fact he got caught doing that “No, just waiting for your slow ass.”
Meg wasn't seeing Uriel anymore "Uriel was a mistake. People make mistakes that should be forgiven."
If she tells him lies
Sam ripped his eyes from the tv “She is staying at Ruby’s house to study for a test they have “
Charlie walked into the room starting her shift, frowning at her friend, who was looking at his husband sadly "Dean, you look like shit."
In the waiting room, Sam took a seat with his leg shaking worried about his brother in law. He also knew he should keep Eileen informed about what was going on, so he took out his phone to text his wife about Cas.
"A chance to do what exactly?" Dean wanted to know not understanding what she would mean by that.
You wouldn't believe
his schedule, so I can
Cas grabbed a tuna wrap; it's been a while since he had one and it looked good "And that guy you were with Sam. He is your brother?"
Cas gasped turning to his husband "I told you to watch what you say around him!"
"If anything happens..." He knew she wouldn't give up.
Dean and Cas liked the ones that didn't reveal the flavors "This is our thing, that's the fun of it like pie Russian roulette. We'd be surprised by the ones we like the ones we didn't like." Yes, there are not many but a few pie flavors Dean didn't like.
“Hey Cassie” he heard Charlie whisper
Castiel watched him walk off and take a seat in a booth in the corner of the place. Once he was settled, out came a book.
"Thirty-two" Dean was only a year older than he was.
“And you get a man” she just had to add in
"Hey Dean, I come with news" Cas took off his trench coat before walking over to sit next to Dean.
"It is" Dean was still grinning ear to ear wiping the tears away "Fiancé"
"I grew up loving Cars especially after learning that my dad was a mechanic. And Bobby who raised me and Sam was a mechanic." Dean explained "Car's are freaking cool as hell. Fixing them is like a puzzle and the best part is when you are done, they leave and you are not responsible for them anymore."
"Didn't you know about it?" Cas wondered.
“I will have that then” Mr. Winchester smiled, getting out his wallet
Dean:
"Do you find it weird being back here?" It was Dean's turn to ask some questions "If you don't mind me asking.""
Dean didn’t believe him “Oh just tripped?”
"Rising up" He shot up to sing along having his own little concert.
Charlie agreed to that “Definity.”
"Is everything okay?" Why was she so worried about something?
Cas noticed his cock growing "Hard for me already?"
Charlie answered her “He turned the hallway. I have to point you out to him sometime.”
From the mention of his name Cas rotated in the direction of the voice, who spoke his name, to find his teacher about to get into his black car. A really nice car at that! “You want a ride?” Dean asked him.
An even bigger smile grew on Sam’s lips getting the approval from his brother.
It was a little awkward for both of them. Cas doesn't know who he is. Dean knows Cas, but knows that Cas doesn't know him.
Castiel felt slightly taken back to see him again and for the love of god seeing those eyes again “Hello, Castiel”
Luckily this time he was in the hospital for a check-up when Cas hit the floor in pain going into the fetal position.
"Babe, you're not imposing you're important to me. You are literally a part of my family now, join us." Dean was going to keep insisting.
"You can," She insisted "Cas will still be here. You have to take care of yourself, you need to sleep properly, go home."
"Isn't that Dean's ex who is supposed to be in jail?" Cas couldn't believe it.
Sam smiled, "We do, I guess I've been waiting for the right time?"
"I can't" She sighed, exhausted
It was a tie.
This was bliss for them, in the moment just them two, but Dean wanted this about Cas, give him all the pleasure. After a few more rocks together, Dean pulled away to once again descend down, kissing his neck, collar bone, and muscled chest planting a trail of tingling kisses until getting down to the prize. Dean used his hands to move along his taint running his finger lightly back and forth.
He could only hope "Can I just stay with you tonight? Let us cool off and refresh tomorrow?" He didn't want to face Dean right now after what happened.
To name a few, Castiel said “Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Shakespeare, and Agatha Christie” he could go on but he didn’t.
It was dark and gloomy outside with buckets of rain pouring out of the sky.
Castiel and Charlie found themselves in the parking lot of the school, getting out of Castiel’s beige pimp like vehicle. While Charlie drives a red Lincoln. You see, Charlie’s parents bought them both a car as they had a choice. Castiel didn’t want anything expensive nor anything fancy. He liked his car.  And It was his time to drive. The two friends decided to carpool together, having them each take turns driving every other day or so.
"Hey Charlie" Sam hugged her with her hugging him back.
Dean's head shot up from his phone trying to answer some emails "what?"
Sam got a text before from him "Not until later, Bobby needed him to stay later."
"What did you see in the memory?" Charlie wondered
"How you feeling, Cas?" Dean asked, curiously.
They were getting many stares from people as Charlie was screaming, but laughing at the same time when he finally caught up to her, picking her up over his shoulders "Put me down, Winchester." she whined between laughter.
Bess started it off “Charlie just told us that you have the hots for that new teacher.”
"I love you, Cas," She groaned, he was squeezing her tight "but I can't breathe."
do your normal things
Cas sat down chuckling as well "It's about Meg actually."
Meg threw on a robe running after him "Clarence, you weren't supposed to be home for another 2 hours"
"Am I going crazy or is that my Cas with ugly ass demon Meg," Dean pointed in that direction to show his friend.
"I didn't mean to" not around her at least. "What are you doing down here?"
"Great!" Meg was thrilled to have him alone as they walked out of the place together.
"I can't not until I get the okay by the doctor" Cas had to be careful while his brain was still in the process of healing itself.
Cas then heard voices, which confused him he thought they were alone. "Someone is here?"
"I can't do this." Cas shot up from the seat as her hand fell.
thinking about you
Dean shifted himself so he was laying down on his side facing Cas.
Being wheeled into the delivery room Charlie was even in more pain than she had ever imagined having to deliver Jack.
He comes from a very religious family, or I should say came from one. His father’s name was Chuck Novak, who he has never met. His father died getting shot on the job as a police officer. Once that tragedy hit, his mother Naomi became a different person. She was no longer the loving mother she once was. She went out every night drinking and smoking. One night she came home with a man named Metatron. Eventually he moved in and absolutely hated Cas. Cas hated him as well. It only got worse when Cas accidently outed himself for being gay as he was obsessed with male fictional characters and talked about them in a way that he should be talking about women. Metatron overheard these conversations with Castiel’s friend Charlie Bradbury. Thinking he was an abomination, Metatron physically, mentally, and emotionally abused Cas as his mother just watched, doing nothing about it. Because Cas went over to Charlie’s house a lot to be able to spend less time at his own, Charlie’s parent’s noticed Cas coming over with more and more bruises. Cas tried to say he fell every time, but Cas wasn’t that great at lying. Charlie even told her parent’s that she thought it was due to Metatron. Looking into it as Charlie’s dad is a lawyer, he found out that Metatron was abusive to his ex-wife. This led to forming a Cas for Castiel and for Cas to come out and admit that he was being abused. To win and get away from them Cas spilled everything. Metatron ended up being locked up and Cas was taken away from his mother. Charlie’s parents offered to take him in and he accepted. Charlie was pretty excited about her best friend moving in.
"I am letting you do that, but I'm just trying to help you regain your memories. I can't do that if you're going to argue with me." Dean wanted more than anything to help him.
“Yes, but what were you playing that got you a bruise like that?” Dean explained, asking “Is it broken?”
Cas smiled small even though it hurt to do so “Thanks.” Leaving the room, knowing Charlie will have questions about why Cas had to stay behind.
Dean remembered now that she is a narcissist "You are delusional."
"Can't go wrong with burgers" Dean loved his cheeseburgers.
"I love you, Dean" Cas was breathless, and he meant every word.
Dean placed his slightly wet hands on the island, to lean his body against it "Last I heard he will be back sometime next week." By the expression on his face, he wasn't thrilled about that. It feels like forever since Cas has been gone. Cas has to sometimes travel for work. That is the only downside of Castiel's job Dean hates. He dislikes being away from him, being in an empty bed with no Cas to cuddle with at night. "Fuck, I miss him, man"
Once they ordered they drove off again to the last destination.
Cas? Sam?
“You know it!” She smiled having the outfit in mind already “How about you?”
Cas had another question to ask "Was it just Uriel?"
Braedon. An ex-girlfriend or should he say fist love that he thought would be his high school sweetheart and more. They dated all throughout high school being the schools it couples as they were the star quarter back and head cheerleader. That was until before
Meanwhile, Cas was in the middle of a dreamlike flashback going on a walk with Sam after a run "When are you going to propose to Eileen?"
“Michael.”
He turned around to see it was Kevin
Dean closed his eyes, kissing back just as lovingly, hands sliding up from Castiel's knees to his thighs for support.
"I don't remember the last ten years of my life" he admitted to her truthfully.
"Hmm, what to get. What to get!" He heard Charlie mumble to herself.
“You came here to drink, right?” Dean assumed, waiting to pour something “What would you like?”
"Want to go down to the cafeteria with me?" Cas offered; he didn't remember him but he was still a kind guy.
He was working on some machine "I'm busy, Cas" not even looking up at him.
“She is still asleep?” he questioned myself
Nearby on the walls were pictures hung up of Cas and Dean, Dean and Sam, Cas and Charlie, Dean and Charlie, Sam with a woman, Dean with some men he didn't know, and Wedding pictures.
"He watches them because you like to watch them to make you happy!" Sam continue to say his opinion.
Castiel shook his head “yeah time flew” he said sarcastically.
He did go.
Dean nodded, knowing he so was going to be punished in the bedroom tonight.
He knew they were all saying something to make sure he was okay speaking all at once, but all he could focus on was Charlie.
Cas felt the vibration of his husband's moan shoot through his body while he let his tongue dive further into his mouth.
“I don’t need you to find me a man. I love you but no. I got my studies, work and my books” Castiel tried to argue. He didn’t really want to be set up. For one, he never even had his first kiss. So, forget about first days and so on. Besides no one at school caught his eye. He wasn’t liked by many people. He also didn’t want to be set up with anyone, considering he never had a first relationship or kiss, he wants to find the right person, not just anyone.
But it was good news "When I was with Charlie, I saw her with Crowley. A memory came back to me. The night I caught her cheating on me and now I'm getting more memories of her lying bullshit she put me through."
"This is the place?" They met here?
"Want to see the rest of the house?" Dean suggested.
Cas wrapped his arms loosely around Dean's neck, softly batting his tongue urgently into his husband's mouth.
"You can?" he would like all the help he could get but that didn't make sense "Dean told me I haven't seen you."
Cas stopped breathing for a moment from the sight of his naked husband; his eyes tracing every place, My God he has a great body.
"Alright let's eat come on" Dean announced bringing the dish into the dining room.
Without them saying a word with growing grins on their faces, which slightly made them look creepy. He asked one more time “What?”
"You really don't know who we are?" Sam wondered
“Oh right,” she giggled “I forgot about that.”
"They were saying I have a husband and a brother in law which doesn't make any sense to me." Cas doesn't recall any of this, did they have the wrong room? "I'm engaged to a girl named Meg and I don't have siblings. If I was going to have an in law it would be a sister in law when you get married."
Charlie:
"Oh, that's nice" Cas nodded, before hearing the doorbell.
Cas opened the door to reveal a naked Meg getting eaten out by his friend Uriel. "What's going on here?"
Dean understood knowing she couldn't "No heavy lifting" it was up to the two of them to figure it out.
Smiling to himself, he brought himself back in for another intense kiss, muffling their moans.
"Okay I will try this one," Steve went for a one that looked orangish. The second it hit his taste buds Cas made a face.
"If they were mine or yours" Dean figured "Those are mine by the way"
Once the coffee liquid poured into the cups, Charlie made her way into the kitchen, hair down, black vans, jeans, and a black “Hermione” shirt.
Dean poured himself a beer, even though bartenders aren’t really supposed to, but it was his family’s bar, so he didn’t care. One wouldn’t hurt.
"Dean" Cas smiled at him as if nothing was wrong.
“Kiss me” Castiel urged almost pleadingly.
He nodded in approval “all good authors” he smiled his way.
BEEP BEEP BEEP
"I moved here" Meg crossed her arms.
Sam smiled "You did, yeah!"
Cas looked at her as I'd this was a joke "I am married to Dean. I am meant to be with him."
He shrugged “I’m not fully awake yet, but someone had to get you up” it’s usually the other way around,
Sam laughed seeing Dean singing along “Heat of the moment! Heat of the moment” and pointing as he backed up to the connected bathroom between their rooms. They live together. Well, Dean owns the house which is conveniently a few feet away from Bobby and Ellen’s house. Sam and sometimes his girlfriend Jessica just happen to live with him as he commutes to and from Sioux Fall college, studying pre law.
Dean noticed what he was looking at as he swallowed the big gulp of food "That is your master's degree, Cas"
"Maybe you are right, we do everything married couples do except we aren't married" Sam thought "If I went to look for a ring would you come with me?"
Dun! Dun dun dun! Dun dun dun! Dun dun dunnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn
Cas took it but was curious "Me? We rotate who picks?"
“I will have three slices of the apple pie.” He glanced at all the pies that were available
With more and more people getting out of the game, it was easier to hit people, so of course the bullies were mostly starting to aim at Cas.
With his ass up, it was a beautiful sight to see for Cas as he poured lubricant onto his hand and slicked up his whole, Dean groaning in pleasure. The sounds Dean was making was causing Steve to lose control. He needed to hurry! Placing the condom onto his hard cock and lining it up to Dean's entrance.
Cas laughed at that "well I love you, infinity, De"
Noticing that there was a door in the garage that probably led into the house, Cas went to open it, but Dean stopped him "Hold on."
"If he said no why are you asking me?" Dean wondered; he will have to say no too.
"A year?" Cas was at least hoping to here this one time, but nope "A whole freaking year?! I proposed to you 3 months ago."
stay away from him
"Dean?" Cas walked down into the garage to see Dean so distraught.
"Nu uh" She argued but then had a thought "Well, I'm calling it the Black Pearl."
She continued "You still live in Lawrence, but not with Meg. You have a husband."
Sighing, he began to strip down and step into the shower to run the hot water through his hair and down his body. Hopefully that would wake him up until it was time to dry off and get the blue bottle in the cabinet above the sink that was filled with his anti-depressants. He had to take one every morning due to obviously depression that he had since he was a kid. He swallowed one taking one big gulp of water, even though he never knew why his doctor still made him take them. He felt like they never worked, but that’s just his opinion
"Jealous that Clarence remembers me and not you?" She grinned at her own comment.
Benny finally noticed the two of them "Yes, what is she doing here?" He knew all about Meg Masters.
Waiting for Jo to hurry up and be ready to leave, going to the Road House, Dean was laying across the front seat of his beloved Baby when ‘Eye of the Tiger’ started to blast through the radio:
Lucky I have one
"I like the sound of that" Cas grinned at him. He was a Fiancé going to be Mr. Winchester.
It was true, Castiel couldn’t really focus and it wasn’t due to Dean this time. The pain on his face wasn’t helping him at all to the point where his hands were shaking trying to do a simple task like using a screwdriver.
"Here, Mr. Winchester" the lady held out a bag for him to take.
With that comment Dean responded with “You never look ugly.”
When a song like this comes on Dean could never resist with his fists going into the air to the beat of the song.
But not for long when Sammy lowered the volume, that was practically almost all the way up “It’s too early for loud music”
"I care that is why I'm here."
There was a deep chuckle escaping Dean’s lips “No, I’m not.”
Charlie didn’t even hide her smile, she wasn’t ashamed of it “Yes, that means we have two classes together, culinary and mechanics” but then she thought of something “I can ask you the same thing why are you taking mechanics? I mean I am glad we are in the class together, but why are you?”
"I know I hope she likes the ring and actually says yes."
“You won’t be working though” She reminded him, “just hang out with your favorite girl.” They did spend a lot of time together.
Dean recalled “Yes, about you wanting to propose?” waiting for him to continue.
"Yes"
"Just one more!" the doctor urged
"I know, yeah" That be remembered.
"Well, that depends" Cas panted out, trying to joke "Are you talking about me or just my cock?"
Jo was keeping a close eye, she didn’t like seeing Lisa back here, she never liked her and from the looks of it she still had the hots for Dean.
“Garth.”
"Are you okay, Cas?" Dean noticed this discomfort in his face.
"Clarence what are you doing here?" She was not expecting to see him show up.
"Good to see you, Cas, how are you?" She asked concerned
Cas was in a daze; what they just did was mind blowing "That was.... Just Wow" this proved something to Cas. Cas knew he was in love with Dean and for sure new he was definitely out of the closet.
"Meg, get our handcuffs both pairs" Cas ordered her so he can hold Dean.
In Lawrence, Kansas we have a leather jacket wearing, pie loving man named Dean Winchester. He is a thirty-two-year-old, who co-runs a successful Mechanic business alongside father like figure, Bobby Singer, and best friend Benny Lafitte. What else needs to be said about Dean? Well, a big part about Dean was that he had an ex-husband from his early twenties. He was married to a horrible man named "Fergus" Crowley Macleod. Wait a minute.... Dean was married to a man? Yes, Dean Winchester is an open Bi Sexual. He loves girls, but he has a bit of a preference for men. Anyways, with that information, Dean divorced Crowley nine years ago after only being married for two years. They dated around three years before that until Crowley proposed..for all the wrong reasons. Basically, so he can "own" Dean and control him. If you are thinking "Did Dean's family like this Crowley? Did Dean's friends like this Crowley?" It is not that they liked him, they tolerated him. They acted civil around him while Crowley did the same. No one close to Dean could put their finger on why they disliked Crowley up until they found out what was going on behind closed doors. Crowley was abusing Dean mentally, emotionally, and physically. Being the way Dean is, he took the hits and believe all the hurtful things Crowley has said about him because he was so insecure and thought low of himself. That was up until Dean's little brother Sam or what Dean calls him "Sammy," found a deep purple bruise on Dean's stomach. Dean tried to deny it, but Sam knew it had to be from Crowley. After so much talking, Dean finally admitted to what was really going on. Sam was starting out as a lawyer and divorce lawyer wasn't his expertise, but was going to find the best lawyer for him. When that day came in court, Dean didn't want to bother anyone by coming however everyone else had other plans. Sam, his long-time girlfriend Eileen, Ellen, Jo, Ash, Benny, and Bobby came to support him. Where were his parents Mary and John? They died in a house fire many years ago when Dean was only four years old and Sam was 6 months old, but they had to be there supporting their son in spirit. Did Dean win? YES! Crowley tried to deny it all, but Dean had so much evidence to back it up that Crowley was indeed found guilty putting him in jail.
bad news?
Traveling up to his balls now, his erection was hard wanting to be touched. He wasn't going to touch it just yet he wanted to be a little tease.
Charlie sat there in the passenger seat confused, he never runs out of the car to the place he calls Hell before she got out of the car with her purple moondor backpack. She noticed her mechanics teacher that every straight girl was gushing over.
Was Cas going to finish the job and think of Dean, who he tried to convince to Charlie and himself that he does not have a crush on his teacher!
"Well look who it is," Meg appeared, placing a hand on Castiel's shoulder "Hello Clarence."
"You want to have your way with me in bed tonight that is not news to me, Cas." Dean joked, taking his feet off the coffee table to sit up.
Cas believed it “It doesn’t hurt that much anymore, soon I won’t look so ugly.”
Dean smiled in a cocky way, of course it was amazing he was kissed by Dean Winchester.
"I don't know about that" She was making faces behind his head as she cut his hair "I mean I feel like this is your chance to start over and start a new path, make better memories."
"Dinner is ready?" Cas assumed from the noise.
[Pic]
Charlie informed her friend "She's been fucking Crowley, Dean."
Dean did come back a couple of hours later just as Sam had to go look at their house with Eileen.
"I seem to, from what I can tell and I'm good at it too. I have some sketches scattered around the house that I've drawn," Cas grew up loving to draw and building things, it honestly seemed like he would take that career choice.
“Wait, a second, how did he know you have this car?” Charlie
"I know I do appreciate it," Cas wasn't confused about that.
Cas nodded seeing where he was going with this "Yeah I guess so."
He could feel the heat in his cheeks “What was what?”
That wasn't all, Dean figured it was time for him to lean down and open his mouth to push the head of his cock in. He was deepening his cock as much as he could only for Dean's slight gag reflex to sound. Dean stopped for a moment to take a breather and swallow, the motion causing Castiel's cock to pulse in his mouth, eliciting a moan from the Dean.
"Did my time, took my chances."
"Cas?" Dean looked towards him.
Cas stopped for a minute, wondering "Do I collage?"
"To Meg?"
Cas smiled, noticing she was dressed too "Same to you. Are you going out?"
"Uh Dean?" Sam gasped followed by the sound of the bag hitting the floor.
The drunk driver was still trying to drive forward. There was nothing Cas could do even with his foot slamming onto the brake. All there was to do was for Jesus to take the wheel. His car went skidding sideways along the dark road until it hit the edge causing the car to give out and flip over. Castiel's head hit right into the window causing his vision to start getting blurry and feel liquid running down his face until he blacked out. The only good thing was that he had a seatbelt on.
will get him back
a few minutes
"Ten years?!" Dean repeated. Dean wasn't in Castiel's life ten years ago. They met exactly nine years ago!
Dean's eyes shifted to Castiel. It's been weeks that Cas has been laying in the same position, not moving. Now Sam noticed Cas shift his body slightly, his eye starting to flutter open trying to adjust to the bright white room. He was in the hospital? With machines connected to him what's going on? There are people here, he's not alone.
“I bet you’re going as Hermione Granger” Kevin told her always knowing what person she would pick to go as.
talked to her?
Someone pinched him
"Is it about me?" Cas frowned.
Charlie would help, but she is 9 months pregnant with a huge belly and her feet were swollen. She was there because she is staying with them until the baby boy is born. With her close to the due date they wanted her here with them. She was okay with that.
Cas tore his gaze away from the attractive man to see what Dean noticed, and it was true. The screwdriver he was using was causing little dents into the nail’s head because of his hand. “Oh, I will try to do better” he apologized.
On the other hand, Dean didn't like that at all "What?"
"What do you have in mind?" Cas wondered back.
“Uh, I like our saison.” One of his favorites that they sell here.
"What do you want?" He wondered "I'll get it!"
Castiel's cock began twitching.
Cas blurted out "Was I with other men?" Castiel was being curious about it, he didn't remember.
Cas was careful and a good driver being safe on the road.
"You looked like you were kissing" It actually pained Cas to see such a sight.
Cas was in their bed waking up, eyes blinking to focus on his surroundings only to find that he was not in his old bedroom he remembers. He's in Dean and his room, so this wasn't a dream. This is his true reality. Ugh, slowly he got up doing a little stretch to hear muscles popping before heading to the bathroom to do his business and go downstairs.
Crowley isn't here
The drunk driver on the other hand, skidded away from Castiel's car running right into a tree. From the impact the tree cut in half crushing down into the truck.
Cas glanced at the pictures from when he was a baby "I started with the early years which was easy then I'm trying to remember the last memory I had before everything went black."
She seemed like she wanted to continue talking, but she had to go teach math “Right, see you soon, Dean.”
"Oh goodie" Dean rolled his eyes are sarcastically "Stay away from him. He doesn't need to be around you."
Why not?
"Ew" She was so grossed out by thoughts of them together "that is so fucking gross. I don't see what he sees in you. I love him."
"I'm sorry" as if that was his fault.
“Hmm?” Cas mumbled, staring into Dean’s green eyes.
“Uh” Castiel started fidgeting with the strap of his apron unconsciously “It is a coffee I made” one day at work a while back he got bored on a slow day which had him ended up playing around with coffee and came up with an interesting tasting coffee. Coworkers have tried it, Charlie had tried it, leading to the manager trying it. She liked it so much that she had customers taste it getting to the point where they started ordering it. It was coffee with two pumps of caramel, a little pinch of sugar, and right amount of honey. Castiel never knew something such as that would be successful. My coworkers started following my lead, making their own specials to sell here.
Hearing Dean’s voice in a whisper and so close to him sent shivers through Castiel’s entire body causing his body to freeze for a moment. Slowly, he turned to Dean “Yeah, I am just trying to focus.”
Why was Dean being so nice and letting him skip out on this part of the project. He will be behind. “I should get this done.”
Cas felt his heart sink. His poor Dean. oh my God. What sick bastard would do this? He moved closer to touch the scar "Dean, I'm so sorry you had to go through that."
Cas was blinking to get his eye sight back while his hand went to his nose to check for blood, there wasn’t any.
Dean was pretty distracted as he walked around class observing the students or if they needed help, but he kept looking at Cas. What exactly happened?
“I am going to go to my locker.” Cas stood up straight, his balance not being so great.
"Sure, is everything okay?" Cas could tell by Dean's facial expression he wasn't happy.
She nodded “I am! We finally made it. It feels like yesterday we graduated 8th grade worried that we will get thrown into lockers when we became freshmen”
Charlie smacked his arm "Of course you would, but I have to say it was a great wedding, the night ended in heaven."
Dean was back at the hospital another week later after Charlie forced him to eat something at least from the cafeteria. He still barely wanted to leave his side even if day by day Cas was slightly improving.
"I was looking for you," Cas couldn't find him around the house.
As Sam added in "Dean can easily eat an entire large pie by himself, I mean I could too and some more, so we usually get a lot of pizza." Placing an arm around Eileen on the couch.
“Castiel!”
"No," Meg watched Cas force Tony into a chair, as she grabbed one hand to cuff him in on her side "I think it'll be fun to have you watch me ride Cas."
"Oh, right Charlie said you'll be coming." Glancing at the computer screen to see the list of patients "He is due to be in room 403 but he's still in surgery at the moment. You'll have to wait on the fourth floor waiting room."
The girl nodded "Sure. Your total is $10.50"
"Hey Dean," Cas greeted his so-called husband.
So Castiel did “He stopped by the coffee shop yesterday and on the way home he offered me a ride, I said yes and we talked.” It wasn’t a big deal.
Sam didn't care to know "And? What are you doing here, Meg?" he knew this wouldn't end well. He will have to tell Dean about this.
Kevin spoke for Charlie “You spaced out a little bit there and looked like you were about to collapse.”
Dean couldn't stand Naomi just as much as Meg "You haven't spoken to her in years."
"He can watch" Meg turned to look at Castiel's reaction. "Good idea I like that."
"So, come home with me and we can figure this out together" Dean wanted nothing more than for Castiel to come back home and work on getting their memories back.
Dean giggled at his facial expression "You don't like that."
"We usually do" Dean grabbed another apple "followed by hot chocolate, but I figured because of the bad food and getting drinks later we shouldn't bother getting it."
He handed me a 5-dollar bill, so with a little click of the machine. Castiel opened the cash register to get two quarters in change out for her.
"To get him back" She said it like he would know that or think that.
"You at least watched your wedding video?" Charlie wondered.
What?
Charlie laughed “Yes, we talked.”
The line didn't look so long at Starbucks, which was a good thing. Cas really hated long lines, but who doesn't? The first thing he did was look at the menu deciding what he wanted to get.
"Of course, you didn't," she scoffed annoyed "why would it occur to you to call me when my son gets into an accident? Meg called me."
It didn't have a happy mood like it usually did when she entered. It felt so gloomy "Hey Sam where is Dean? Or Cas?"
It was a race to see who would be done first the coffee or Charlie.
"Cas?" Charlie didn't yell, she didn't want to make a big scene as his friend clutched at his head.
"I don't want to bother you with anything" Cas had his own problems.
"I did not," Dean informed him, knowing what he was doing "I will say this though you are not one for fancy dates. You like going on dates that other people wouldn't consider dates. Am I correct?"
“Help me get him up!” the teacher urged taking one arm.
Sam thought for a moment "Uh, I think I am going to head to my room and read a book."
"Are you kidding me?" She scoffed, not believing this was happening
The two lovers had papers scattered around the table as they were discussing something when Sam looked up "Hey Dean," looking to Cas, "wow you're home."
"Hey" He smiled at her, she seemed familiar he couldn't find a memory of her.
Dean:
"And you know Charlie?" Cas put his stuff down for the person at the cashier.
"Cas, you are back" Sam was getting home the same time Cas showed up. He was glad to see him.
Cas gave in "alright."
It was silent for some time until Dean’s eyes gazed down to Castiel’s poor nose. “I still can’t believe that happened to you.”
Cas chucked seeing that Dean's eyes weren't looking into his own eyes "Like what you see?"
I'm feeling a bit
"Innocent fun? How long has this been going on for Meg?" He shouldn't care to know, but asked anyway.
for a checkup there soon
And so on.
"Nothing I'm fine" Dean didn't want to talk about this, not now "go back to sleep."
"Dean!" Cas's hands dropped making their way down to Dean's hips, gripping tightly, but not enough to hurt him.
"What happened?" She sounded like she cared, closing the door.
"I told him" Charlie promised "I said we would give him a few minutes to process it. I have to go get his doctor" she didn't want to leave them, but the doctor needed to check on Castiel.
"He should! Why should you have him?" Meg couldn't understand how Cas was still under Dean's spell.
"It's a secret," She couldn't let that slip yet.
"Good morning, Dean" Cas greeted as he entered the kitchen
Dean rolled his eyes "I wasn't aware of it being bitch month first Meg and now you."
“Class” Mr. Rollan told them “get on your side so we can start the game. Whoever wins gets to pick the sport to play tomorrow.”
Dean climbed onto the bed "You are somewhere in the low five hundred range."
"Typical" Meg rolled her eyes. He gave her a look "I'm sorry to hear that, what about?"
"Rising up to the challenge of our rival."
"Think all you want" He knows he right "You gave up Cas when you decided to fuck Uriel."
So, she was watching the couple slightly struggle with all of the crib parts scattered around them that had to be put together somehow. They were both smart, who built things for a living yet they couldn't figure this out.
"Why are you so perfect?" Cas just looked so amazing in this position; a perfect sight.
"Sorry, I can't help" she apologized as if she had to. She did help with the room with the easy stuff but she couldn't with the crib.
It got her to laugh "True, have you gone back to work?"
“I uh I- I am okay.” Castiel breathed out, the pain was not so good!
Tell you what
The next thing Cas heard was students laughing, Charlie giggling as she held him up in a friendly way not like the others were, and Channing apologizing thinking it was her fault that this happened. “Castiel, I am so sorry I didn’t see you there.”
“Castiel!”
This was honestly hard for Charlie to say "Cas, this might sound crazy but you are thirty-one years old" she started off easy.
He had to see for myself, opening her door. Castiel peeked in to find her sound asleep and tucked up comfortably in her covers.
Castiel shot up in bed, the book falling off of him as he found himself breathing heavily. Why did he dream of something like that?! Feeling a sensation, Cas looked down to see something sticking up, his penis rose from the dream of Dean. Castiel's eyes grew wide at the sight before him.
"Point is you are not gay!" She was clearly homophobic.
"Yeah a little pain in my head, but I'm okay" Cas didn't want to admit what he saw just yet.
“You do that” Castiel laughed at her
Humming along to 'Another One Bites the Dust' Cas drummed his fingers on the steering wheel, picking up that little habit from Dean, minding his own business as he was stopped at a red light. Once it signaled to turn green Cas took his foot off the brake placing it back onto the gas, cruising along.
Castiel playfully smacked the hand holding he puppet away from his face “Shut up,” He couldn’t even say that without a smile.
"Oh, my fucking God, Cas, go home and tell Dean now, Go!"
Cas saw that they will be working hands on and even learning to fix a car and put things together for a car. No cars were in the class just yet, but now he sees why there is a huge garage door in the back and why the classroom was just as big as the auditorium.
Cas and Dean both in a state of shock to see her.
Dean couldn’t help but think of Cas and he didn’t know why, but he seemed like a good kid. In a not so weird way, Dean was always friendly with student’s platonically of course that is why he had them call him Dean. He wanted to be the cool teacher not the strict one.
"Charlie, what if," Dean tried.
Jo walked over to him “You know she’s back?”
I warned her to
Cas laughed 'Charlie, I doubt anyone is as good in bed as Dean is." They barely could keep their hands off each other when they are alone. Dean was an addiction.
"101716" Dean gave the number.
~~~~Flashback~~~~
Dean obeyed so easily "What are you going to do?"
That made Sam looked back at him from Dean's question.
Dean laughed sarcastically. He couldn't believe this was happening, placing his hands on his head, forcing himself not to punch a fall...maybe he'll wait when he gets home to do so. Sam shoved his hands in his jean pockets, staring at the floor, this was hurting him too, but he could see his brother breaking.
"Oh?" Cas then asked "What are we having?'
"And you thought 'I wish I was the person who hasn't read it so I can experience it all over again" Dean continued.
Close, but no
He was hungry feeling like he had not eaten in months, walking through the hallways noticing something. The stranger claiming to be his husband was asleep on chairs. He slowly crept towards him, tapping him.
Making the tea, Meg questioned aloud "What is something we haven't discussed? Do you remember prom?"
~A Few Years Later~
“What kind of car is it?” Cas didn’t know too much about cars. He used his to get around that is about it.
"Yes, you are."
He could’ve been there for minutes when he felt pain shoot through my left arm.
Quietly, Dean nodded and left into his own house, closing the door.
Dean put on oven mittens to take out the Big dish out "lasagna." Closing the oven door with his foot.
"What do you do?' Cas got out of the car, amazed by the house, what was inside?
She damped his hair a bit "You do have nice hair, Clarence."
me Meg?
Smack
Cas nodded silently, waiting for him to continue.
"What?" He took a sip of his hot tea.
"I did?" Cas didn't know that
The need for oxygen was becoming too great making the kiss break, placing their foreheads up against the other, with the two men short of breath; panting heavily. With eyes fixed on one another, the color in their eyes were nearly gone with their pupils blown in utter lust.
Dean was asleep in bed next to Cas squirming; he was having a nightmare.
“And I am special enough for you to bring me here?” Castiel wondered
Cas turned to look at Dean now instead of the side window “Charlie calls it that, why does everyone call it that?”
Dean glared at her there no way he would allow that "That is not going to happen."
“I asked how was culinary,” Castiel chuckled “But I see that it went well considering you’re staring at Dorothy so you must love the class due to her.”
The class went on a little longer before it was time for the last class that was Chemistry. Once it was over, Castiel went straight for the front and out into the fresh air for the car.
"How was your day?" Dean started off with "Do anything? See anyone? Has anyone come over?"
Dean finally looked at Cas "You two were naked... together making me watch as you two fucked while you told me hurtful things, not wanting to remember me and never loving me, only using me. I guess with her being back and her popping up everywhere it had me worried. I can't lose you"
Moving in more, Dean lightly pushed Castiel’s head forward for the two men to embrace in a soft kiss. As if Castiel’s body knew what to do, he kissed back feeling love pass through each other sending chills down his spine. Castiel’s right hand shot up to Dean’s leather jacket, grabbing a hold of it. It was exhilarating.
"He's not you corrupted him" His mom through at Dean before turning to Cas calmly "Castiel, how are you doing?"
She nodded "and we never got caught, but the night ended amazingly."
Only to give Dean a nice view of his ass "There is that ass I love so much."
time being
"I don't know, Meg" He sat down on a chair "we will see."
"Couldn't stop okay, I'm sorry" Meg couldn't control herself.
"Yes" Dean went to the frig of the cafe to get a water bottle "do you want a water?" What Dean really could go for right now was a glass of cold beer, but they don't sell that in hospitals.
He could see Dean didn’t wipe that smirk off his face
"Dean caused it" Meg frowns at him.
"Dean, I am sorry," Cas sat up from the couch, grabbed the remote to pause the tape
She placed a hand on Dean's shoulder "He made it through."
“To stop working and not to worry about getting this done today.” Cas plainly told her, he wanted this done yet on the other hand he was grateful because he really couldn’t focus as much as he wanted to.
Not like Dean does "You don't truly love him nor could ever love him like I do."
Charlie placed a hand on her friend's arm "stay here, let me talk to him. I'll ask him the routine questions."
Castiel wasn’t sure if he should even look or whatever yet he took one deep breath in and out feeling the air leave his lungs as he slowly turned his heels to where Dean is seated.
Silence followed
Cas had to drive her home before heading to work for a few hours.
Charlie didn’t hear the question as she was staring at Dorothy, who was talking to a friend.
"I know Charlie said the same thing that's why I'm back." Cas wanted to make this right somehow "Do you know if he is home?"
It was a good-sized wedding. No one from Castiel's family was invited, but his friends were. They only wanted the ones who they are close with.
"I'm a mechanic" Dean shrugged, pretty proud of that. He did have a big ego about it. How he can rebuild cars just from scraps, he was that good!
Dean was the first to slide onto the hood of the car to relax, stretching out his legs and reaching out a hand for Cas to take.
A few feet away at a corner table was Meg sucking face with Dean's ex-husband, yes, he has seen pictures. Cas believed Charlie and Dean when they told him, but he's actually seeing it.
“Is it any good?” Cas wondered.
The pastor started the ceremony "On behalf of Cas and Dean, we are here today to celebrate their sacrament of marriage. We are gathered as family and friends to witness the love exchange and a whole new birth of a family in front of us. We are privileged to witness the joyous love of this new family; a family that will be nourished and nurtured through the devotion of two separate individuals growing together through the common bonds of love. May their marriage bring them the peace, joy, comfort and contentment that is known in the hearts of all God's children. May Cas and Dean look forward to each new season of their marriage just as the world looks forward to each new season of the year. For all seasons bring with them their own special moments and memories. An essential requirement of a good marriage is a strong bond of real friendship and trust. We come here together so the Lord may seal and strengthen your love in the presence of me and your family and friends. Christ abundantly strengthens your love concentrated by you in baptism now he enriches you by a special sacrament that you may assume the duties in marriage. Here in the presence of your family and friends I ask you to state your intentions. Cas and Dean, have you come here freely and without reservation to give yourself to each other in marriage?"
"Amnesia?" She made a face "But you remember me."
Cas quickly got out his wallet from his pants pocket and gave her the money before receiving change and going to stand over to the side and wait for their coffee.
Cas turned to look out the window
Castel's back arched upwards as he begged "Don't stop" he was enjoying this good feeling way too much.
"Yeah" Cas slowly lifted his head up, sighing from the slight pain "I got a glimpse of meeting you there."
Waiting and waiting, they finally got the coffee and walked out to walk around.
Dean sprang into action jumping to his feet "I'll get the hospital bag and car."
"Yes, we are going to dinner with my family" Eileen told him.
"You are all done," Meg brushed off the cut hairs that fell on Castiel's hoodie.
Dean:
"I'm fine mom, getting better" Cas needed to understand this better "Dean, when was the last time I spoke to my mom?"
What the fuck?
Charlie was finally able to breath and rest laying back down onto the hospital bed trying to catch her breath.
Castiel didn't mind "It is a bit, yes" his eyes scanning the room until it landed on a plank of a paper hanging on the wall "Hey Dean?"
Sam shot open his eyes to see Dean in his room
"Me?" She figured they would eventually "Well he hates me. Clarence, I did nothing to him, but you know what? Let's forget about him. I was going to make myself some tea you want some? And we can talk more about our memories?"
"What are you doing here?" Meg asked Cas, ignoring Dean's presence.
"Yes, I didn't think you'd get that" she nodded impressed with that guess; it was a random part of the movie.
How could he not like it? "I hope you would."
"Are you delusional?" Ignoring what he just said "He doesn't remember you! You're nothing, but a stranger he's going to come back to me watch and see."
Dean watched Cas closely as he hesitantly walked into the spacious living room to notice a long L shaped gray couch with the biggest flat screen TV he's ever seen parallel on the wall. There were two love seats on either side of the couch and a nice sized coffee table.
"Do you want your memories back?" She questioned him.
In many ways since
“Kevin.”
Chemistry Mr. Johnson 101 (With Charlie)
"Dean, faster please" Cas was begging for more.
what I'm thinking
"No" Dean was explaining as he hit the level four button "I mean we've talked about it, but not yet."
Castiel’s heart slightly sunk, that wasn’t something he was proud of being eighteen, but it was not false. “Yeah…” was Dean going to think less of him?
Cas groaned “I don’t need Mr. Fizzles. He is good looking” gorgeous, beautiful, handsome is more like, but he stuck to good looking. “But that doesn’t mean crush.”
Pain shot through his head instantly, causing Cas to grab the counter so he wouldn't fall.
"Why are you so tired?" She asked him, yawning herself due to his yawn.
Hurrying out from behind the counter, Castiel quickly made his way over to her, placing her order down “sorry about the wait” he apologized.
"One thousand and fifty times? That is a lot," he smiled at such a thing "Now go to bed or I will give all your toys to your cousin Mary" with that he closed the door.
Dean had a good comeback "No, I think I impressed you enough the night we met."
Cas entered him, slowly but surely going all the way in causing them both to moan out. Cas closed his eyes for a moment at the amazing feeling as his hands rested on Dean's hips for balance.
"Boring," no thrilling cases happened today "Who is here?" Sam's ears heard a noise come from the kitchen only to see a familiar woman appear.
saved from
Cas stopped what he was doing to look up at her with a slight grin "Beetlejuice reference"
"So, what can I get you two? Blue Moon?" They usually ordered that when they came here.
Cas smiled into the kiss, going for the hem of Dean's shirt to rip off of him. Following his lead, Dean did the same, only to attack his lips once more. Castiel's hands resting on Dean's hips. Dean's hands, well that had other plans, unzipping Castiel's pants to grab a hold of Castiel's balls.
Ha, imagine that? "Worse"
"Can we hang out until then?" Cas suggested, get memories back with him.
Then it got to Castiel, so he told the teacher “I am Castiel and I love to read” it was one of his favorite things. He couldn’t help it. Reading helps escape reality for a little while and enter this whole new world.
Hearing a loud bang, Dean decided to check it out, as he stepped out of the classroom with student’s pilling into class, not noticing that since yesterday a lot more girls transferred into his class and it definitely wasn’t due to their sudden interest in mechanics. Dean noticed that Cas was on the floor, slowly getting up.
Sam was honestly trying to hide a smile “Yeah I am. I been searching for rings, I mean I haven’t found the one I want yet, but I am still looking.”
"It was alright. I fixed up a few cars, but better now that I get to see you" Dean bent down to kiss the side of Castiel's head, realizing his mistake as soon as he did it, straightening himself back up "sorry it's a habit."
"You" Cas admitted.
Dean shrugged his shoulders “It’s whatever,” Lisa wasn’t his last ex and that was almost eight years ago.
"I'll tell you and Dean soon I promise."
“We’re here, come on” getting out of his side, Cas followed his lead climbing out to be met with the wind whistling through the tall trees and small bushes.
Castiel wasn’t following her at all “What about me?”
What kind
Cas smiled small towards him "And so we don't have any kids?" They were making their way back up onto the elevator.
Dean moved away "I'll get back to work."
"Hey, Baby I have an idea" Meg grinned towards the upset Dean.
Like the Red Sea the room separated into two parts.
Dean leaded into another kiss just for Cas to whimper into his mouth.
"Can we order what we did the first time," Cas suggested if they are recreating the night "if you remember?"
"It's time for bed anyway," Dean got up to take him upstairs.
Dean nodded, staying close by "I wasn't lying"
"Cas please, this isn't you, stop this" Dean tried, begging. This couldn't be happening.
"Cas please, stop this"
“Hey, I may like girls, but I know when someone is attractive and he is.” Charlie was even admitting Dean was hot and she wasn’t even into him, he doesn’t have what she likes, boobs and vaginas!
"Really? I don't want to impose" He figured it was only their thing.
“Yeah” Sam nodded, speaking sarcastically “and if I ever hear it again, I’ll kill myself”
Cas can see why Dean was into mechanics, he saw he loved cars and loved this one. “I get it, I got attached to my car. My friend’s hate it, but I like it.”
"I get that," Dean wished he knew too "but soon you can come back home with me and you'll remember everything."
"Now all you need is...." Charlie noticed something "Meg."
He turned on his stool to look at her “What?” he whispered back.
Charlie shook her head at him smiling. Why not? He was offering, so she let him "Thanks Cas."
Cas easily spread out his legs more for Dean to have better access "Oh!" He moaned out.
Cas smiled back at him "I can see why. You seem addicting."
Cas had to disagree "I didn't change, I fell in love."
"Clarence!"
"I wanted to ask you if I could have cookies" Jack tried.
Dean had to argue "I don't make Cas watch them with me. He agrees to them besides he likes them too and you know, gets ideas" a smile appeared on his face, thinking how Cas and him had many role play ideas in the bedroom that had them wearing cowboy boots and cowboy hats.
"Tell you lies that manipulative bastard!" Meg bad-mouthed him "he made you think you're something else and to drop out of being a rich doctor. He didn't tell you any of this?"
Dean really did “It was good, I will have to go back and get it again, but that pie was really good.”
Looking at his choices, Crowley picked “Gordon.”
Charlie nodded; this didn't turn out great.
Dean helped him put the rest of the pictures in order until Sam and Eileen came home and it was time for their night.
Cas laughed.
Cas had an answer for her, stating simply “I told him.” Dean did ask.
Cas noticed two girls walking out of this ring place. They were saying "I can't wait for you to propose to Valerie."
Cas had to agree with her "Yeah me too" there was a tiny pause "Hey look! That one looks like a ship"
