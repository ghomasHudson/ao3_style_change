“So, you’ve been to the bunker?” he asked.
“Don’t be silly, Dean, you’ve always been Miracle’s number one human. He told me so, himself.”
“I should have known… I’m… God.”
“Are you ready?” Castiel asked as they watched Dean pile at least two of each food he cooked onto Jack’s plate.
“We’re back!” Jack called out, jovially as he bounded down the stairs. “We brought Chinese! It took a while to be ready but it’s still hot!”
“Are you sure?” Sam asked, looking skeptical. “I thought you were done.”
At the same time, Jack said, “Yes!”
Castiel hummed in response as he did the same.
“I know. That’s why we did it. But, we didn’t think about how heavy the responsibility would be on you.”
It’s not how he thought he would go but at least it’s a death he has control of.
Jack flashed a smile before bounding off towards the hall. Meanwhile, Dean huffed and stalked off after him. Castiel didn’t dare follow. Dean wouldn’t like it so he stayed put.
A/N: Hello, everyone! I have no excuse for my lateness other than I've just been super busy lately! And I had a lot of writer's block while writing this chapter but now it's here! I hope it's to your liking!
When it ended, Jack quickly got to his feet, placing the bowl of popcorn on the coffee table before stretching. It looked exaggerated to Castiel.
Jack didn’t answer. Instead, he swallowed, first, before taking a long drink of his orange juice.
“And you told me you…”
“I feel guilty, too, you know. I mean, I shot him right after he was born. And the Ma’lak box thing. But, I apologized and he forgave me, too. And I know he loves me. Even Cas isn’t a perfect parent. So whether he calls us his dads or not, it shouldn’t matter. We’re all trying to make it up to him now.”
Jack stood on the sidewalk, backpack on and lunchbox in hand, ready to go. But, then, Eileen took out her phone.
Claire stuck her tongue out at him before she disappeared. Chuckling, Sam grabbed the basket of Bess’ rolls and some serving utensils before following them out. The mac and cheese, green beans, cranberry sauce, and gravy were still on the table so they would have to come back.
“After all this time, Baby, he never appreciated you.”
It didn’t take long for Sam to join them for breakfast, finally back from his morning run with Miracle in tow. Now that they were all there, the older Winchester took the opportunity to talk about the upcoming holiday.
"When you looked 21. Now, you look just like any other kid who just reached puberty so we're treating you like one, got it?"
“His parents have been called and we are having a separate conversation with them.” The woman leaned back in her chair. “I know Jack tried to help but there were other ways, such as telling a teacher or a staff member what was happening, not take it into his own hands. He committed violence against another student and must face the consequences.”
Jack let out a whoop. He grabbed his sandwich and the papers and quickly excused himself to his room so he could get ready.
“I want to do more research on the schools,” he said.
“Congratulations!” Castiel exclaimed.
There was only silence as the sounds of their footsteps slowly faded away.
Even with his vision darkening, all he can see is Sam, his baby brother. The most precious and most important person in his life. His dorky, giant, book nerd of a brother.
They stopped two more times, both for the neighborhood kids who were Miracle’s regular admirers. Little 5-year-old Emma who Miracle would stay still for as the little arms hugged her tight. Then, there were the Ross triplets, who always had a treat for their furry friend. (This was why Castiel had been trying – but failing – to put her on a diet. She kept getting spoiled with treats!)
So, for the first time in months, Jack made a difficult decision. He decided to use his powers on his friend.
And, of course, Miracle followed him to his room. That dog had found a new favorite and Dean wasn’t sure if he found it cute or traitorous.
He stuffed the last spoon of cereal into his mouth, drank the milk straight out of the bowl, and stood up. He went to put the dirty dishes in the sink and fixed himself a cup of coffee.
Instantly, Sam felt guilty for waking him up like this. “You can’t keep doing this to yourself,” he said, much more gently this time.
His son’s current mood seemed better compared to when Castiel left.
Dean paused and looked at the cart, thoughtfully. “Speaking of cheese, I think we’ll need more than one bag.”
Dean flashed him a frown. “Everything okay?”
“Make a lot of new friends.”
Dean continued to eat while Castiel headed out of the kitchen, pausing for a few beats to fondly scratch behind Miracle’s ear. When he disappeared down the hallway, Dean tossed the last of the bacon to the dog before getting up and doing the dishes.
Dean shrugged.
Raphael seemed to consider this. “I care for Jack. He is our brother’s son and he has done wonderful work in the past year. But, I fear that he may want more than what he can have. He was born for a reason and his birth may not be what Lucifer hoped it would be, but perhaps he was born for us. To redeem Heaven and restore it to its former glory.”
Castiel hummed. “It is indeed happy news to find out you are having a nephew. A new addition to your family.”
“….. please….”
Dean swiped at his cheeks. “Did I get it?”
The silence was interrupted by one of the babies making a shriek of displeasure and everyone managed to laugh.
And, as always, Castiel understands and leaves their hands entwined.
Jack sniffled. He wasn’t free. Not by a long shot.
Castiel felt relief flood through him. “I’m glad to hear that. Do you mind weakening the wards so I can enter? Please.”
He blinked in confusion, his brain a little stuck. “Y-Yeah?” he managed before clearing his throat.
“What?! No! It’s not like that!”
His brother looked serious now. “You have your own life, Sammy,” said Dean. “I guess I should have expected this. I’m just pissed you waited this long to tell me. You could have moved out months ago and I’d have this whole place to myself!”
“So? What are we learning?”
“Shut your yap and put the leftovers in the containers.”
“Cool, cool. So, what are you up to?”
Castiel smiles and it shoots an arrow right at Dean’s heart as he’s reminded of the last time he saw that smile.
After breakfast, they all piled into the Impala. Dean was driving, of course, and Castiel in the passenger seat, given the rare privilege of shotgun. In the back, Jack was squeezed in between Sam and Eileen, his backpack tucked in between his legs. His stomach was fluttering with butterflies – he wasn’t sure if it was nerves, excitement, or both.
On the dance floor, the kids split up from their pairs and returned to dancing as a group.
He hopes Sam takes good care of Miracle, go on walks with her, and let her eat the leftovers off his plate. It’s funny how he and Sam always wanted a dog when they were kids but John wouldn’t let them. And now that they finally got one... now that they finally have some semblance of a normal life, Dean has to leave.
“Dean.”
CadenceImperfect, _Chaotic_Kay_, and xim! Thank you so much for taking the time to read my first two chapters and giving me feedback!
“What things?” Jack asked, sounding genuinely curious.
Dean felt himself preen as he clapped his hands.
Lazily running a hand through his hair to give it some semblance of order, Dean entered the kitchen with a loud yawn.
Aside from that brief celebration of all the holidays when Mrs. Butters was around, Jack never got to experience Thanksgiving as a full holiday. He had missed his first one due to being trapped in Apocalypse World and in the following years, they were trying to save the world for the nth time. There was no opportunity to celebrate. But, they were finally doing it this year!
“You didn’t have to, Dean,” he tried to protest.
“Still. It’s our fault you’re in the situation in the first place. We’re the adults so we take responsibility. So… So, if going to school and being a normal kid is what’s going to make you happy, then we’ll make damn sure you’ll get it, okay? Even if it means I have to drive you to school everyday and go to PTA meetings and bake cookies for a bake sale or something… anything. You can count on me. And, Sam, too. And I’m sure Cas will be with you every step of the way.”
He gestured to Castiel, who gave the teacher a smile. “We’re Jack Kline’s guardians. He’s a freshman.”
“The woman’s right, Jack, come on!” Dean had taken out his own phone and aimed it at Jack. “I’m sending these to Bobby, Jody, and Donna.”
Hugs were exchanged and Dean broke out a bottle of wine to celebrate his new status as Uncle.
“We should get going,” Sam announced. “We’ll be back in an hour. Maybe two. Don’t kill each other.”
Garth laughed a little and turned to the other twin, who had found Eileen fascinating. “The other is Sam.”
Dean was silent as he drove, but Sam wasn’t too worried after his brother snapped at him for trying to change the station. Meanwhile, in the backseat, Jack seemed preoccupied with a book but Sam knew, for a fact, that the kid had been on the same page since the moment he opened it.
Well, as much fun as all this deep talk and touching moment is, Dean was ready to move on.
Meanwhile, Michael’s vessel was completely new. When Chuck had killed him, Adam’s soul was no longer sharing their body. Small blessings as it allowed Jack to bring the youngest Winchester back, intact. But, even though Michael had formed an attachment to Adam, he no longer wanted to inhabit the human’s body. He never said his reasons but Castiel suspected that his bond with Adam was just as deep and profound as his with Dean’s (but no one brought it up, as it always made sadness flash in Michael's face whenever Adam was mentioned). Instead, Michael had found a suitable vessel in a devout man on the brink of dying from cancer who prayed for one last opportunity to do some good in the world. The man had said “yes” without hesitation, shortly before his soul left his body. Michael made sure that his soul was in Heaven, at peace with his loved ones.
“So, uh, we have some news,” he began, flashing his girlfriend a look. She nodded at him, in encouragement. “And we wanted you two to be the first to know.”
Castiel smiles softly and steps forward. He places a hand on Dean’s left shoulder and Dean can almost feel the remnants of that old handprint from when the angel first rescued him from the depths of hell.
“You could call him.”
Jack seemed to take pity on him. “I did ask him if he would like to visit you and Dean. I would have allowed him to, despite the new rules. He declined.”
Sam turned to Dean, who caught his eye. His older brother looked lost and helpless.
“Oh. Right. Haha. Thank you, Sam. You two be careful."
Castiel immediately moved forward, arms already raised, intent on comforting his son.
A/N: I'm super sorry that this is delayed! I struggled a bit with it on top of some real-world things I had to take care of. But, here's the new chapter and I hope it makes up for the lateness!
Dean didn’t know what to say to that so he just grunted and began to eat his own cereal.
The notion of a deadline seemed to perk something up in Jack and he turned serious and determined. “Alright, thank you. I will look through these, carefully.” Then, he turned to Castiel. “Will you take a look with me, Cas?”
Their life was simple. But, it was theirs. Finally theirs.
“It really does,” Kaia agreed as she looked longingly at the mashed potatoes.
It took a few seconds but, eventually, the gold faded from Jack’s eyes and guilt replaced the previous anger.
“They are able to visit each other, now. Your mother has dinner with Bobby, Ellen, and Jo once a week. They’ve invited me and Jack but, unfortunately, we’ve been busy. We also found Kevin and gave him his rightful place in Heaven as a prophet of the Lord. He and Charlie have met and bonded.”
“I ran away,” he confessed.
Jack wanted to respond that he wasn’t a jock but Casey said her goodbyes before he could do so. She said she needed to catch the bus home but Jack felt that she was just shy about meeting new people.
Dean sank back against the couch, wishing it would swallow him up. He didn’t mean for that to come out.
Dean tries to squint and the light disappears again… and then reappears.
He nodded. “That’s good to know.” He paused. “And… Adam?”
“I’ll be back in half an hour,” Castiel said.
“Castiel!” she called out, arms open for a hug.
“No.” Dean’s chair made a loud scraping sound against the floor as he stood up. “I don’t know what got you and Jack thinking you can’t live here but stop it, okay? This is your home. Neither of you is leaving.”
“You… seemed angry earlier.”
He grabbed two of the bags and Castiel grabbed the last two. Together, they left the store and hurried back to the Impala. They placed the bags in the trunk and took their place in the driver and passenger seat. Dean was still holding the receipt. In fact, before starting the car, he flipped it over to see what was written on the back.
“So, remember one time when we talked about creating a Hunter’s Network out of the bunker? You know, to help other hunters. Provide them with resources they don’t need to literally sell their soul for?”
“Dean… don’t lead him on. That’s an asshole move.”
Jack nodded. “I sped up my aging when I was in my mother’s womb. I can do it again but in reverse. I would much prefer to start high school from the beginning.”
“Dean. Please.”
Castiel could feel his chest aching in disappointment as he answered, “I’m sorry, but we can’t.”
Jack and Jack seemed to return the sentiment. Sometimes, when Dean passed by Jack’s room, he could hear Jack talking to the dog, having an actual conversation with him. It was endearingly cute, if not a bit odd. But, then again, Jack had always been an odd duck. He got it from his dad (not Lucifer).
“I… okay…” He pushed back his seat and stood up, stretching. “Jack and Sam will probably be back soon.” He flashed Castiel a look. “At least stay for dinner before you guys go back.”
“May I be excused?” he asked.
Dean and Sam tried to push the boy to talk but every time they tried, he would immediately excuse himself and go back to his room, not answering their questions. It was worrying behavior, to be honest. Despite Jack's reassurances that nothing was wrong, they couldn't help but think that
Jack nodded in agreement and stood up, too. He gazed one last time at the group of teenagers. They seemed to fascinate him and the unreadable look on his face was hard for Sam to decipher, so he brushed it off as just Jack's curiosity. After all, he didn't have any friends his age. (That was just a sad thought, wasn't it?)
With a huff, Dean got to his feet. “Alright, fine. Whatever. Finish your breakfast.” He grabbed two pieces of bacon and angrily stuffed them in his mouth as he left the kitchen.
Sighing, he got up and stretched. Then, smiling a wide smile, he excitedly jumped out of bed, tiredness completely gone, and got ready for the day.
The angel smiled and patted his hand. “I’m proud of you.”
And so, they sat there, like dorky but proud parents, watching Jack model outfit after outfit for them. They gave him thumbs up on a couple of shirts (the red, a white one, and a midnight blue) and thumbs down on the rest (a striped green, a dotted white, and an ugly orange). Castiel examined each piece of clothing very closely, patting and tugging and asking Jack to move around, making sure the kid was comfortable.
At that, Castiel looked down at his formal suit, sensible shoes, and wrinkled trench coat, as if taking it in for the first time. The only times he changed out of them was when he was human and couldn’t mojo his way to a clean outfit.
“I thought we weren’t keeping stuff from each other anymore.”
“I hate this, Sammy,” Dean muttered under his breath.
Surprised yet pleased to be included in such an important decision, Castiel nodded and sat down.
Telling Dean about his plans to move out of the bunker was not on Sam’s agenda for tonight. Yet, the great atmosphere, the good food, and the excellent company made Sam braver. He hadn’t seen Dean this happy and content in so long. It made Sam hope that he would be okay, after all.
Bobby was there. Apparently, everyone else he knew and loved was there, too, though he didn't see them. He went for a long drive with Baby. Then, Sam had joined him. They were on a bridge, that same bridge from their first hunt together after Dad went missing.
The kid flinched but continued to look down at the floor. He still wasn’t talking.
“Jack, you guys still off Thursday and Friday for Thanksgiving?” Dean asked him.
“But, it’s Friday.”
Shaking his head, Sam pushed the door open and loudly proclaimed, “Dean, seriously?”
“No, we were thinking of moving to somewhere that’s not the bunker. Maybe an apartment… or a house. We haven’t really decided. But, uh, Dean doesn’t know, yet. I haven’t had the chance to bring it up.” The thought of his brother reminded him why he hadn’t talked to him about his plans. “Honestly, I’m kind of worried about Dean.”
“This is Miss Picoult from John Adams High School. I apologize for the disturbance, Mr. Campbell, but Mr. Kline wasn’t answering his phone and you’re next in Jack’s emergency contacts.”
The angel releases a breath of relief. “I will watch over you. Like I always do. Like I always have from the very beginning.”
“That was years ago.”
“I wasn’t going to interfere,” he began. “It was after lunch and Zayn and I were walking to class. His room was in the same wing as mine. And I saw that guy… Dylan… he was harassing Casey. I remembered her from my Math class, she lent me an eraser when I couldn’t find mine. He was calling her names and she looked upset but she was talking back. She seemed to be fine on her own. But, when we were walking by them, I just couldn’t stop myself. I asked him to leave her alone. And I was polite, I swear! I didn’t want to draw too much attention to myself, like you told me to. But, I guess Dylan wasn’t happy about it. He… He pulled Casey’s hair and that was when I punched him. I didn’t mean to use my full strength, it just happened! Next thing I knew, he was bleeding on the floor and a teacher took me to the principal’s office.”
Feeling stuffed and full of dinner and happiness, Dean took the opportunity to grab a beer and go out into the back porch for some fresh air. He leaned against the wooden column of the front porch, just taking it all in.
“If you don’t tell me, I’ll come up with my conclusions. And, trust me, I
“I guess that’s baby Sam’s way of saying I should hurry it up,” joked Sam before clearing his throat. “So… Happy Thanksgiving everyone. I hope we all have a good rest of our year.”
“I don’t mind, Dean. I want you to be happy.”
“Um… wow… thanks.” Claire still looked unsure, though.
“Mr. and Mrs. Kline, it’s best that you both have a seat,” said Sam, gesturing politely to the empty loveseat adjacent to the couch.
“Talk.”
Weird.
“I will, Eileen.”
“Great! Eileen’s coming by then to help us get shit done."
“At least think about it?”
“O… kay.”
“If Jack ran away, how long until those angels realize he’s gone and will try to track him down? He’s their leader now, of course they’re gonna want him back. They waited a millennium before they realized Chuck took off. They ain’t gonna wait another millennium this time. You want them storming in here to drag our kid back, kicking and screaming?”
Finally, a “Dean” replied.
The older Winchester simply hummed in response.
Dean practically snatched the box and would have probably dug in if Castiel hadn’t taken it away, admonishing him about how inappropriate it was to eat dessert before real food. Dean whined about how unfair it was that he had to wait because pie was appropriate for every meal.
“See you, Cas.”
“Mr. and Mrs. Klein, what we’re about to tell you is confidential information. And… we regret to inform you this so close to the holidays but… it’s important that you know the truth. You deserve the truth.”
One of Castiel’s most cherished memories from when the Empy first released him was the feel of his wings on his back. His majestic wings that were damaged and burned during the Fall. One of his most prized features that he thought he would never get back again. All those years, they felt like a ghost upon his back.
Dean was humming "Don't You Forget About Me" and he could feel Castiel’s intense curious stare.
“You haven’t stopped calling him all week.”
Sam had direction – he knew what he wanted and he was going for it and he wanted Dean to do the same. But, what did Dean want? Sure, right now, he spent his days taking care of Jack as he did with Sam when he was little. But, what about afterwards? When it was time for Jack and Castiel to return to Heaven and for Sam to move in with Eileen, what was he left with?
“Y-Yes…”
“Well, maybe we could get started on that… if you’re willing to still be a part of it, I mean. I get that you have a different life now and you don’t want to hunt anymore, but you’ll be mostly hands-off in the cases. And Cas has some angelic and holy knowledge that maybe we can write down and turn into some kind of guide… if he’s willing to help out. You don’t even have to come to the bunker, I can just come here and we can work on plans and-.”
Sam snorted. “Some good that did. Everyone disappeared anyway.”
“Dean, I could-.”
“Oh. Right. I guess I was pretty loud.”
Jack appeared distressed at that. “I… I’m sorry… If I had known…”
“Yes. Yes, of course, I forgive you, Dean. You’re… You raised me. And, I know, in your own way, you cared about me. I’m sorry, too. For everything.”
Miracle jumped down to the floor, looking at him expectantly. Smiling at him, Jack stretched and got to his feet.
Meanwhile, Sam’s hands shook as he unzipped the duffle bag at his feet. One by one, he retrieved the times they had agreed to return to Kelly’s parents – things that she left behind and Castiel had kept for Jack but the kid had decided was better off returned to his grandparents – Kelly’s black cardigan, her wallet, and her necklace.
He wondered what Dean thought of Castiel’s lips, if Dean thought they were just as soft, if Castiel tasted like the wine they had at dinner.
“Did you?” Dean asked from the sink where he was finishing up with the dishes.
Now, though, things were different. Dean was in his 40’s and the world had drastically changed.
“Dude, what crawled in your pants?” Sam taunted.
“Hello, Dean.”
“And?” she pushed.
Another hour and later, the oven indicated that the turkey would be ready in about five minutes. Everything else was cooked and ready – heaping helpings of stuffing, cornbread, gravy, and mashed potatoes. Jody’s mac and cheese had been reheated and now sat on the counter beside a basket of Bess’ homemade rolls, cranberry sauce, and green beans. The wines Charlie and Stevie brought sat next to a bottle of sparkling apple cider.
The angel was unreadable, calm in that irritating manner that made Dean want to tear his hair out. Sometimes, he could read Castiel like an open book. But, there were times like these where he was so closed off and composed that Dean didn’t know what was in his head and it bothered him.
Dean and Sam finished the rest of their sandwiches before leaving the Dean Cave to get ready for their day out. By the time Dean walked into the War Room, Jack and Castiel were already waiting. The kid was bouncing on his feet, excitedly texting (his friends, most likely, or Claire as they had gotten close since her and Kaia's visit). Castiel watched him with fondness. While they waited for Sam, Dean made sure Miracle had water and some food, in case he got hungry while they were out, and laid out a couple of dog toys for him.
By now, Castiel was aware that it was sarcasm. So, he simply hung his head and waited for the wards to go down.
At 4 o’clock, Dean shut the T.V. off, Castiel marked his book, and Miracle napped, still exhausted from playtime.
“Well, Castiel is technically my uncle, too, but I consider him my father. And Dean and Sam are like my uncles.”
“See you in two days, buddy,” Dean said to the phone before hanging up.
“A miracle!”
“Oh.”
Dean tried to protest. “But-.”
“Well… it seems to be talking about two people who have hurt each other, unintentionally. They fight and they leave. But, they always come back and make up with each other. They’re a team. It perfectly describes our friendship.”
The conversation was pushed to the back of Dean’s mind, soon forgotten after his chore of cleaning his guns followed by the simple pasta dinner Castiel had managed to concoct. Then, he and Sam were roped into binging a T.V. show with Jack, something called “Shadowhunters” that involved demons, vampires, werewolves, warlocks, and Nephilim. (They laughed at the inaccuracies... until Jack asked for a tattoo. They made him swear not to get one until he was 18.)
“Can I kiss you?”
There he was, waiting with a guilty look on his face. At least he knew he had done wrong when he left Heaven with no warning.
“You were earlier.”
Dean nodded, sending a wink. “Thanks, sweetheart. See you around.”
“Get some things ready for our hunt,” Eileen finished for him.
“I’ve watched so many movies about high school dances but I still feel underprepared,” mused Castiel as he stared up at the large banner with an unreadable expression.
Jack closed his eyes and took another deep breath, the feelings of guilt and failure washing over him like saltwater.
“Come on, Cas. Even you know that what that Dylan kid did was a jerk move.”
“Look, man, I just… a lot of things happened this year, okay? And it just got me thinking. I know that… being brothers… may be difficult right now. And that’s okay, I’m not asking for us to suddenly hold hands and sing ‘kumbaya.’ Just… I wanted to apologize. For everything. With Michael and the cage and what Chuck did to you. You didn’t deserve any of that. And... I just wanted to let you know... that Sam and I... we're here. Whenever you're ready, we're here. "
The tension that consumed their way over had finally dissipated and peace settled.
“Really?” Jack was practically vibrating as he gazed at Dean, waiting to hear more.
That made Dean sit up straighter. “So, our friends and family…?”
The sound of padding footsteps echoed until Miracle appeared, bounding to Dean.
Oh, he was helping Jack. That was nice of him.
Sam stared after him, blinking as his brain tried to process what just happened. For months, Dean had been adamant about not seeing anyone new. He was too busy to date, he said. He had no interest in one-night hookups anymore, he said. He didn’t want to accidentally hurt Castiel’s feelings, he said.
He wondered if Jack was doing okay. Was he making friends? Enemies? What if the other teenagers were mean to him? Jack’s 14-year-old self was small and lanky. He was also cheerful and smart but wasn’t well knowledgeable of social cues. Kids like that were prime targets for bullies, according to the movies he watched.
“Weird in what sense?”
It was just one of four options Eileen had sent him but there was a certain excitement that came with imagining your own place – somewhere to call home. Not that the bunker wasn’t home. But, building a new home for himself and the woman he loved… it was something he never thought he could ever have.
Claire’s lip twitched. She seemed nonchalant about it for a second but, eventually, she pushed away from the wall.
But, it was different when Castiel was taken by the Empty.
Together, the two men tiptoed out of the kitchen, down the hall, and into the war room. They spotted jean-clad legs making their way down the stairs. Sam tightened his grip on the knife, getting ready to pounce.
His family. This was his family.
Dean figured he could spend the rest of the night watching a movie with the other two occupants of the bunker. But, when he suggested it, Jack declined and excused himself to his room.
Dean took a subtle deep breath. “I guess there’s no use hiding it from you, huh?”
Dinner was a quiet affair. Sure, Dean and Sam talked about what they had been up to in the last year (surprisingly, only a few cases and mostly research for other hunters). And, yes, Castiel gave Sam the short version of everything he told Dean during their talk. Miracle would pop over to them every now and then, flashing puppy dog eyes in hopes of getting scraps (Dean snuck him bits of meat while Sam was turned away, Castiel noticed). But, Jack… Jack was quiet.
“No.” Dean pinned him with a glare. “Lisa is a chapter I’ve closed a long time ago. She has her own life now and I’m not stupid enough to go back and mess it up for her again.”
Castiel’s brow furrowed. “Adam? Milligan? Your brother? I told you that he’s not dead.”
He was an angel of the Lord, a soldier of Heaven. He had led armies in battles and fought side-by-side with the Winchesters in many apocalypses. He had been through Hell and Purgatory. Most of his free time had been spent learning about humans and acquainting himself with their culture – and he mostly only did it so he could better interact with Dean and Sam. They were his friends, after all, and he enjoyed spending time with them.
Slowly, and much too soon, Dean ended the kiss but he stayed close, his nose touching Castiel’s.
“Yeah… yeah, sure. Just… you know… thought I’d be your dad, too, or something.” Dean was pretty proud of himself for managing to sound nonchalant.
She threw one last look at the three (or probably just at her girlfriend) before making her way out of the library.
“You let me eat two bowls of Lucky Charms,” said Sam. “I was hopped up on sugar, dude!”
“I don’t like the thought of Jack leaving Heaven,” he explained, honestly. “But, I understand why he may want to. For us, Heaven is home. For Jack, it may not be. Although, I’m certain he loves being with his mother,” he added for Kelly’s benefit, sending her a small but kind smile. “But, the difference between his leaving and Father’s is that he at least sent Castiel back to inform us. Father never extended the same courtesy. Though, I wish Jack came here to tell us, himself.”
Chuck was powerless. Lucifer was dead. There were no more apocalypses or prophecies or any more of that bull. They were allies with the Queen of Hell, who was strangely fond of Dean’s brother.
“Just enough to convince them,” Castiel reassured him, smiling. “And, if they agree, then we’ll figure out the next steps. But… if they don’t, you must return to Heaven. But, even then, we’ll figure something out, alright?”
Dean grabbed a pillow and threw it at Sam’s head. “Shut up and get out of my room!”
Dean and Sam paused their game to turn towards him and wave at the phone.
Sam let out a sigh. “Well, he’s been better since Cas showed up again but… uh… you probably noticed the… tension.”
“Great! So, I know Sam’s trip to the store was just an excuse but I know there’s enough ingredients in the kitchen right now to make the patties. Wanna help me?”
Dean met his brother’s gaze, curious.
“Damnit! Cas! Where are you?! Why aren’t you answering your phone?! Call me back.”
“Mrs. Kline?” Sam asked, anyway.
Castiel opened his mouth to try and offer some comfort to this child he came to call his son, but couldn’t find the right words. Instead, he simply stood there, watching the boy cry. Useless.
Dean had to get it out now before he lost his balls. Before he became a coward again. Before he let Castiel go again.
“What should we do?” Jack asked, excitedly.
A/N: Another late chapter, I'm so sorry! It's just been a busy and stressful week!
“Uh huh.”
“Maybe next Christmas, I can stop by if I have the time.
“Hell, if I could, I’d retire too. Like your Bobby did.”
Gabriel spoke up in his usual joking manner. “So, he wants to go to high school? He wants to do homework and take standardized tests? Learn first-hand what it’s like to give in to peer pressure?”
Castiel felt oddly disappointed that Dean didn’t offer him a hug. In fact, they hadn’t hugged at all since his re-appearance. Maybe Dean was still angry at him. Or, maybe he was uncomfortable showing Castiel any sort of affection, now that Dean knew of his feelings. It was understandable, though a bit sad. If Castiel had known their last hug was it, he would have held him longer. But, there was no use dwelling in broken hearts. He had a mission.
“We are righting all the wrongs and mistakes we’ve made, Dean. It’s not perfect, yet, but we’re getting there.” A worried look crossed the angel’s face. “There are… some angels who are still skeptical that these changes will make everything better. So, we’re trying to re-establish trust among our own as well. That’s why I need to get Jack home.”
Dean shook his head, lips pursed. “Guess we’re just too busy to really look for a case. I mean, we’ve gotten calls from the other hunters so we know stuff is being taken care of.”
Castiel thought about it and came to the conclusion that it made sense to split the responsibilities. They would have to come up with a viable system and routine as to not overwhelm Jack.
Dean cleared his throat. “Right… right.”
Dean patted his hand. “I’ll do my best if you do the same for me.”
“But, you told me you had your first beer when you were 14.”
“No,” Dean replied, immediately, still not looking at him.
“Bitch!”
And, then, the pain followed.
Outside, birds sang their morning song and the squirrels chattered as they went about their business. Castiel said there was a nest of robins residing in the tree by their porch.
He wanted to keep them around for as long as he could.
Classic Jack. Always trying to justify Dean and Sam’s shitty plans.
“Everything. You make Jack breakfast and lunch everyday. You drive him to school and pick him up. And Sam helps him with his homework. I… admit, I’m rather clueless about these things. I should be doing them as his father but you’ve taken the responsibility that was meant to be mine.”
There was no judgment in her eyes, only patience. She nodded at him to continue.
This time, it was Castiel who led the way inside, as Dean had never set foot in the building before. He followed the angel through the halls and up some stairs, passing lockers, classrooms, and teenagers loitering in the hallways. It must be between periods. Dean shivered a little, memories of his own high school experience springing to mind like random stills and scenes from a movie.
Jack finished for him. “I don’t want to be like Chuck.”
Castiel released him, leaving his hands on the boy’s shoulders while flashing him a stern gaze. “Why did you leave?! Do you know how worried we all were?! Your mother was frantic!”
It was good to see Jack happier and much more relaxed than he was when he first arrived. Sam and Dean didn’t mean to eavesdrop on him and Castiel last night, but they couldn’t help it. Jack watching those teenagers discuss the upcoming school year and then asking Sam about high school made perfect sense now. And he couldn’t blame him for it.
Sam felt his jaw drop, appalled.  “I’m 38! And online school is a thing now. I can get my degree from here or while we’re on the road.”
“Hey,” Sam greeted with a gentle smile. “Dean said you had something to tell us?”
“Stay,” his brother whispered to Miracle, who let out a soft whine but stayed in his spot under the table.
Castiel flashed him a soft smile. It made something in Dean’s stomach flipped and he was pretty sure he hadn’t eaten yet.
Dean squeezed his hand, offering a loving smile of his own. “See you later, Cas.”
Jack shrugged. “I know. And I want nothing more than to tell them who I am. But, I know I can’t. And that’s okay, I’ve accepted it. But they deserve to know about mom.”
“Julie and the Phantoms?”
The principal, too, sat down, her back straight and her fingers locked. She looked at Jack.
Castiel smiled. “You should head to bed, now. I’ll take care of the leftovers.”
“I’m sure that’s not it.”
“Did you mean it?”
Eileen bit her lip. “I… well… I’d be lying if I said it didn’t cross my mind, sometimes. I just didn’t think it was something I could have… or something that you want.”
Maybe she thought Jack was just humoring her.
“I… I don’t know where to begin.”
"If it's nice out, we can head to the park?” Sam suggested.
Dean took them to a popular ice cream chain in the town center. He got himself a cup of chocolate ice cream, Jack got strawberry on a waffle cone, and, after much deliberation and indecisiveness, Castiel got a cup of pistachio.
grader?”
“Let her help.” Castiel whispered in his ear. “You don’t have to do this all by yourself, Dean.”
That last sentence seemed like an odd thing to say.
Castiel was about to reply but felt himself freeze in place.
He expected Eileen to be disappointed, and maybe she was but hid it rather well. Sam was disappointed too but he didn’t see all this coming when they had made their plans. It just seemed wrong to leave now when it appeared that Jack and Castiel were officially moving back in. And with Jack going to school, they were gonna need all the help they could get.
Dean entered the room, going straight for the bed. “We gotta clean this place up, Sammy,” he stated, brushing a finger across the side table and grimacing at how much dust accumulated on the digit. “Send the kid out to walk Miracle or something. Can you grab his stuff from storage?”
“So, for the past two weeks, some local prostitutes have been going missing in a town called Trinidad. Their bodies were found days later, with their hearts ripped out and chunks of flesh missing.”
Castiel flashed him a wary look. “You don’t have to say anything, Dean.”
Castiel moves to make room for him and, for a moment, Dean panics.
“Will you and Jack come by and have dinner with us sometimes?”
A pause as the loud back-and-forth continued.
Letting out a loud sigh, Castiel spread his wings and was off. He had much work to do and arrangements to make before his temporary leave. First things first, he must meet with Balthazar, who was to take on Castiel's Heavenly duties while he was away.
Casey, luckily, managed to finish her worksheet just as Mr. Shay called out, “Bring your worksheets up on your way out! Have a great weekend, everyone!”
Dean put the Impala in gear and soon, the Kline’s home was miles behind them.
He didn’t get what the big deal was. So, he designed a robot, so what? It wasn’t like he had been smart enough to stay on the team.
Dean’s brow furrowed. “Uh, nothing. Just wanted to check in. See how you’ve been and all.”
Turns out that hope was well-placed.
“Yeah, yeah.”
The tension inside the Impala was palpable. Sam wondered what would happen if he just took out a knife and cut through it. Because he couldn’t help but squirm in his seat as they drove the 7 hours to Colorado, where the Klines lived in Denver.
, Dean.”
The angel greeted them before unceremoniously dumping a stack of papers on Jack’s lap.
Jack sat still, letting his mind wander to his list of homework assignments for the weekend. If he finished all of his homework tonight, he would have the entire weekend free. There were so many things he could do. He could study in advance and be prepared for the next lectures. Or he could re-watch all of the "Star Wars" movies again, he was sure Dean would love that. Or maybe he and Castiel could spend another day together doing puzzles – they finished a 1000-piece puzzle of the Taj Mahal last weekend. Or he could learn new spells from Sam, his witch room that contained all of Rowena’s old stuff was really cool and he enjoyed watching Sam experiment.
“Well… for one… you weren’t there.”
Jack’s pleasant chewing slowed down. He was avoiding their eyes.
“I…” Jack’s voice felt trapped in his throat.
He was brought out of his reminiscing and realized that they had reached a door labeled, “OFFICE.” It was flanked by large glass windows, covered with a curtain to conceal the room behind it. Two kids were standing outside: a dark-haired boy wearing what appeared to be a varsity jacket and a blonde girl with pink streaks and a bow pinned to her ponytail. The two students watched them curiously as they entered the office, looking like they wanted to follow.
He was familiar with the stages of grief, as he had taken a Psychology elective back in one of his many high schools (though he couldn’t remember which one). But, in their line of work, there was no time to go through all five stages when there was another monster whose head needed chopping off the very next day. Sure, it was probably a really unhealthy way of coping and dealing with grief, but that was the way things were with him.
“Of course! First Thanksgiving together? Can’t miss it! Though Donna is sorry that she can’t make it, she’s working. But, she sends her love and says she’s free at Christmas if you want to do this again.”
So, upon finding nothing to read on the fourth day, he turned to Dean on the fifth day with a request to visit the local library. Castiel could have flown there, himself – he had his wings now. But, he also liked spending time with Dean. And Dean liked driving. It was a win-win for both.
“Would you… want to do that?” he tentatively asked.
A subtle twitch of a smile graced the boy’s lips. “Yes… Like… High school.”
“Damn, never thought I’d see you guys act like this.” Claire sidled up to him and pressed her back to the wall, too.
“Yes, everything seems to be going smoothly. A few obstacles but nothing you need to worry about, they were all resolved, quickly. Kelly misses Jack but she’s happy to hear that he’s doing well.”
“Good morning, Dean,” Jack returned.
“Jack,” Castiel called out, calmly. “Please sit. We have plenty to talk about.”
Sam was happy. He had Eileen. And they were building a home.
“Did you like it?”
“If we had stayed longer in Sacramento back then, Dean would have probably participated in the regional competition," Sam continued, something like pride in his tone.
He couldn’t seem to find the words so Dean just patted him on the back again. “Wait ‘til we get to the car.”
Castiel took his glass and drained it. The alcohol didn’t affect him, but it gave him a few moments to stall.
(He didn’t want Dean to cut the tree, even though it would give them plenty of space for a nice front garden.
“What do you mean, you don’t want to worry, Cas?”
“You good?” he asked Castiel from his spot by the kitchen doors. He was holding four beers – two in each hand.
There’s silence now. There’s a lot to say but Dean doesn’t know how to start. The last time they talked…
Castiel stiffened in his arms before he relaxed and returned the hug.
Zayn’s eyes widened but he nodded, nonetheless. “Cool. I mean, sorry about your mom. But, welcome. Hope you like it here.”
“Uh, thanks.” Dean cleared his throat. “Anyway, if you want, we can start your cooking lessons this weekend. Cool?”
He loved learning in his classes and going home to do homework and learning more and then showing off how much he learned in quizzes and tests. His favorite subject, so far, was Global History. Humans have done so many extraordinary things over the centuries – both great and terrible. Jack wondered if he could go back in time and ask these people questions, himself, to see if everything on his textbook was accurate.
It had to come back to that, huh?
The two kids laughed, delighted. Dean liked them, immediately.
And with that, Dean left the room, feeling lighter than he did when he woke up.
Dean carved the turkey and wine bottles were passed around several times. Jack talked a mile a minute about school to anyone who managed to catch his eye. Garth finagled Eileen into a conversation about the best ways to dispose of a body. Gertie regaled Alex and Patience with a tale about how her brothers almost bit off the mailman’s fingers when their teeth started coming in. Sam looked to be in a serious talk with Jody about managing a Hunter’s Network and Bobby chimed in, despite how far away he was. The babies cooed, babbled, and shrieked. Miracle prowled under the table, hoping to catch some scraps.
They planned and deliberated for hours. Castiel wasn’t sure how long it took them to agree which responsibility was whose and how his monthly reports were to be done. They agreed on steps to ensure Jack’s safety on Earth and what emergencies would entail his immediate return to Heaven.
The other line rang a few times before it was answered.
“Here you go, Casey.”
“Nah, I think I’ll skip today.”
Dean, who was sitting at the map table and absentmindedly petting Miracle, shot to his feet.
“And they have all returned.”
Castiel wanted to wrap his arms around Dean Winchester and not let go. He wanted to tell him he was sorry, that he missed him, that he hoped Dean forgave him. The only things stopping him were the memories of their last encounter and the invisible force that forbid him from taking another step.
He and his brother locked eyes, silently communicating that it was go time.
“We’ll all be here to pick you up at 2:30.”
Quickly, he hid the post from Casey’s timeline but not before taking a photo of it on his own phone. Then, he called Dean but it went to voicemail so he just left a message that rehearsal should be finished in half an hour.
He could smell the eggs and bacon.
“Well?” he asked when Dean was back at his side.
“Hey, hey, hey, hold your horses there, cowboy. What are you talking about? Leaving? Overstaying your welcome? Did you think we were gonna kick you out?”
Dean clicked his tongue. “His loss. A pretty girl like yourself deserves a romantic home-cooked meal.”
If Sam didn’t know any better, he’d think Dean was trying to clog up his arteries so he would die an early death. At least that would be a more natural way to go compared to any of their previous deaths. And the notion that they had more than one death experience was pretty weird and crazy. Their life in the past year had been, for the most part, quiet and normal. But, who knew how long that was gonna last?
“Dean, uh, never told me what happened to you,” Sam stated without prompting and unknowingly answering Castiel’s question. “He just said there was a deal and the Empty took you and Billie. I’m sorry, I wish I could have helped, somehow.”
Casey was a fan of anime. Jack had never watched one before and when he told her this, she was quite appalled. She had sworn to take on his anime education and show him all the good ones.
Castiel nodded. “I believe that he feared that he might be forced to stay.”
“What are you doing here?”
Dean knows he’s dying.
“I’m awake!” he called back as he moved the blankets aside.
“No, no, you’re not overstepping. I’m grateful that you and your brother are there for him. I just… I feel somewhat… useless.”
“Fiiine.” She leaned back on her chair, her feet hovering above the floor as her grip on her desk tightened. “So, I forgot to ask earlier. How did tryouts go yesterday?”
She spun around with a sarcastic smile. “I knew you had ulterior motives! I’ll get you for this, old man!”
Jack stayed silent but he offered an encouraging smile when the man flashed a quick look at him.
“Okay… It’s okay, I’m not mad. I just want to understand what’s going on.”
Jack beamed as he entered. “Good morning, Dean.” He dropped his backpack next to the table and sat at the table next to Castiel, who was nursing a cup of coffee. “Good morning, Cas.”
Dean’s eye twitched. When he blinked and shook his head, Sam knew he won.
Castiel could hear him grumbling to himself but couldn’t decipher the words. Dean was acting a little strange tonight but, perhaps, it was just an off night.
But, there was a possibility that, after many months of inactivity, he was losing his touch as he didn’t register the presence behind him. Not until familiar arms wrapped themselves around his waist and a chin tuck itself onto his shoulder.
Eileen, Charlie, and Stevie cleared the map table of chip bags, board games, and random baby toys. Patience and Alex took the plates from the brothers and set the table. Garth and Jody placed the scattered chairs back in position.
Wasn’t a kiss too soon?
His silence only worried Sam more.
Would Sam be as happy as he was now? Would Eileen have found peace? It was a difficult question to answer and they tried not to dwell on it. All Sam knew was that he was thankful and grateful and he was going to hold on to this wonderful and feisty woman he came to love.
Sam leaned on the column opposite him, clutching his own bottle of beer.
He joined the Robotics club because the teacher was hot and he had a crush on her. Go big or go home, right? He didn’t think he would actually like it. And he learned from the other kids. But, it wasn’t like it lasted long. After a month, Dad came back and they had to take off again.
Claire pursed her lips. “No, I guess not. I still remember mini-golf. Remember? When I totally kicked your ass, old man.”
Tears began to flow and the distraught boy angrily swiped at them with his knuckles, sounds of distress emanating out of him. So innocent. So childlike.
“I missed you, guys,” he whispered.
Charlie hummed. “Us, too. Couldn't really do holidays when you're trying to survive in a dystopia." There was a second or two of silence. "But, how are you, really, Dean?”
With that, he took the next steps to his new adventure.
Ah, Dean understood, now. All they really did when they found out Castiel was alive and that Jack was staying with them was send out a mass text to everyone who knew the two. With all the excitement around Jack entering high school, Castiel must have not had the chance to check in with Claire.
Jack wiped his cheeks with both hands, sniffling a little. “Yes… Thank you… for doing this.”
He was under meds so he’s not allowed to drive. It sucks.
Jack put his code in, gave the door a little slam, and waited patiently as it slowly opened for him. He quickly swapped his books, double-checking his little planner to ensure that he had everything he needed. Then, he turned to the photo taped to his locker door.
“Yeah, but… every single night? And you don’t just talk about the case. You talk about your day and about Jack and whatever you’re watching on T.V. It’s…”
“I still don’t get it. Did Jack just change everything? And you still haven’t said how you got out.”
“What is the truth?” asked Mr. Klein. “Where’s our little girl?”
“Thank you,” he said politely, smiling and raising a hand in greeting. “I’m Jack.”
Dean was already moving. “What the hell would they be doing in the dungeon?!”
Claire took a sip from her bottle, neither responding nor looking at him.
“I told you, I was helping with the repairs-.”
Charlie grinned. “Falling hopelessly and irrevocably in love?”
“Yeah, I mean… I can’t force Dean to go out and hunt, especially right now. Pretty sure he’s waiting until Cas actually gets back but we don’t know when that is, exactly.”
“My dad.”
Castiel chuckled. “Yes, you already know that. Are you fishing for compliments, Dean?”
After finishing with the groceries, they both went upstairs to get the guest room ready. Sam and Eileen always stayed the night. Castiel dusted while Dean changed the sheets to fresh ones and sprayed some air freshener to get rid of the dusty smell.
Yes, he wasn’t exactly a good friend – or even a good brother – last year. He was a mess. Wracked with the weight of guilt, remorse, and regret, he chose the bottle over talking to his friends. He chose to recklessly throw himself at every hunt, uncaring of his life. But, things were different now. He knew he had a lot of inner work to do. Sam mentioned something about seeing a therapist once but Dean had shot that down, immediately. He wasn’t ready to see a shrink yet.
There was a silent pause. “Really? You?”
“Okay,” said Mrs. Kline, sounding impatient.
“Okay, Sam.”
Bobby grunted his understanding. He opened the fridge and took out a pack of beer and four of the small cartons of apple juice for the kids. With one last salute, he left Dean to finish the rest of the cooking.
His brother walked over to his bed and plopped down at the end so Sam took the empty chair by his desk. The desk, itself, was messy with all sorts of papers. Pretty official-looking with logos and everything. Before Sam could take a closer look at them, Dean spoke.
"JOHN ADAMS HS" flashed on the screen.
Just the thought of a next Thanksgiving gave Dean the contradicting feelings of excitement and dread.
Instantly, Castiel’s smile disappeared and he got to his feet, grabbing his coat from the seat next to him and putting it on.
Amara didn’t buy it. At least, not all of it.
Castiel squinted. “What about me, Dean?”
Reverently, he runs his hands all over the leather seat and the dusty dashboard.
“Of course, I’m still angry, Cas! You disappeared for a year! And when you came back and I asked you why, you didn’t exactly give me a straight answer!”
He strolled over to the door and pulled it open. Before leaving, Sam turned back around.
Castiel’s footsteps moved away from the door, making Jack breathe out in relief.
“You really know the way to a man’s heart, don’t ya, Cas?”
Jack looked great! The red made him look older than his physical age of fourteen. The jacket wasn’t expensive by any means, but it was good quality. And black goes with everything.
“Um… so…” He felt awkward, all of a sudden, with all the eyes on him. “I guess before we get started, I’d just like to say… thank you. All of you. I know our lives haven’t been exactly a walk in the park.”
Dean sighed. “Of course, there is,” he muttered.
Castiel tilted his head in Jack’s direction, not saying much and allowing Dean to make his own conclusion. It took a few blinks and some squinting but Dean immediately understood. His eyes widened and then he grinned, looking proud.
Giving him one last scratch on the head, Dean stood up and turned his attention back to the hallway.
Every second of the moment he rescued Dean from Hell was still fresh in his mind.
The air was chilly but the sun was out and bright, making their walk pleasant. Miracle led the way, her head swiveling around as she sniffed the familiar surroundings. She chose a spot under a tree to do her business and Dean cleaned up after her. He tossed the bag into a nearby trash can before continuing on their way.
“Jack, what’s going on?”
The familiar feelings of warmth and fondness suddenly flooded him, just like that moment he saw Jack walk down those stairs after a year of not hearing from him. Their kid was home, again.
“So, what? You all got job transfers? Promotions?”
“You’ve never been a burden, Cas.”
“I see.”
Everyone cheered, toasting to the success of the two hunters.
“But, when? How did it happen? I don’t get it.”
Castiel ignored him. He was getting good at being firmer with the kid, who was becoming more and more rebellious by the day. The three of them were oddly proud and, yet, a little apprehensive at that.
Another few beats of awkward silence followed. Dean wracked his brain for something to say.
And, right at that moment, there was the distinct sound of a key sliding into the door and Sam looked up to see his brother amble in, looking tired. At any other time, Sam would attribute the weariness to bedroom activities, but Dean looked miserable on top of it. No after-sex glow.
“I… I honestly don’t know,” replied Castiel, also sounding worried. “He seemed fine. But, then he didn’t show up for dinner at Kelly’s. She thought he was just late. He usually sent someone along to let her know he was going to be late but no one showed up. And when she went to his room and found his note, she called me.”
For a moment, Dean felt himself freeze in place as he took it all in. There was something about the scene that made him not want to tear his eyes away.
“Great!” said Sam, placing their groceries on the table and taking them out. “Mind if I make a salad real quick? It won’t take long. Maybe twenty minutes.”
The hunter felt himself go cold at that, a lump in his throat forming. He didn’t want to think of Castiel being gone tomorrow. They just got him back.
Finally, Jack found the wall of lockers. He checked his locker number on the little slip of paper Sam had written out for him with information the school had e-mailed him and scanned the wall. When he found his assigned locker, he put in the code for the lock. It clicked and Jack made to pull it open.
Castiel looked curious. “A Dance?” he repeated.
“You sure you don’t want to just stay here while we go?” Dean asked Jack as he worked on his tie.
“Just… thank you.”
He hung up and squeezed the bridge of his nose, feeling his panic manifest in a raging headache
After what felt like eons of being stared down by an angry hunter, Castiel felt the force holding him back weaken until it completely faded. He was free to enter. Still avoiding Dean’s eyes, he pushed past him and loudly made his way down the stairs.
“That was a joke, Cas.”
“Dean, we’re back,” Castiel announced, raising the bags filled with groceries that Dean needed. “And guess who we ran into on our way in?”
Castiel smiled and nodded before gesturing with a hand in the direction of the Dean Cave.
Jack got excited at the prospect of making their own pizza so Dean decided they could make personalized ones. He had already made the dough and chopped the toppings. All they had left to do was slap on the sauce, cheese, and toppings.
“Bullshit! And you’re telling me Jack wouldn’t have let you come back down for a social call? He’s God and he’s your kid! Don’t take me for a fool, Cas!”
Jack pouted. “Can’t I have one?” he asked.
Castiel’s smile widened. “He’s alive.”
Dean coughed and swallowed the lump in his throat. “Right… okay.”
“So, movie?” he asked, feigning confidence.
They froze and appeared to tense.
Sam felt himself smile as he looked at it, imagining himself living there with Eileen, sharing a life together. Dean could easily visit. Castiel and Jack, too. And it was close enough to the bunker that he could drive there if they needed anything.
With that, Dean stomped off, his boots hard and heavy against the sleek floor. They all watched him leave, quiet and a little confused. Castiel thought he and Dean had made amends the last time they spoke. Things had been going well. Perhaps, he was wrong
“Why not?”
The song sounded nice. Castiel felt his foot tapping along. His ears followed the words that made up the lyrics – they sounded sad but hopeful. Castiel decided that he liked it.
“Morning, kid,” he greeted, ruffling Jack’s hair as he sat down next to him.
“They were recommended by myself and the archangels. I was the first to be resurrected, followed by Gabriel and Michael. They requested Raphael to be brought back as well.” At this, Castiel smiled. “They have reconciled with each other. Mostly to the urging of Gabriel. It appears that even powerful archangels cannot resist any request from their youngest brother.”
Castiel.
Despite the lack of action in his life right now, he was truly content.
It didn’t budge. Jack frowned and pulled again. It remained stuck. He wasn’t using his full strength and he considered breaking his promise not to when a fist suddenly slammed into the locker door. Jack jumped back, startled.
He could feel them still watching him as he turned around and made his way into the building.
