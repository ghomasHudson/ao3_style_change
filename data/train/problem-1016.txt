John wondered with a distinct sense of amusement how his vague fantasy of a dancer’s arse had been morphed into one in which Sherlock was the centre of attention, but then that was hardly a surprising development. “Where’d I put it then?”
—in one box, so to speak, and this sex experiment in another. They weren’t even in the same wing of his mind palace. But now it was as though a secret passage had opened between them. He hadn’t wondered, not yet; hadn’t tried to imagine what sex with John might be like, but now he could feel his mind
His phone rang. John grabbed for it, hoping it was Sherlock or, better yet, Lestrade, but the screen read
“I have scars,” Sherlock said evenly. “Behind my ankle. I can’t remember how they got there. I remember Eurus using the knife on me to see what would happen, but that was on my arm, and she didn’t cut very deeply. There are no scars there.”
“John,” Molly gulped out, fresh tears running down her face. “Did they tell you anything? I haven’t heard—I haven’t heard anything, but they haven’t sent a chaplain yet, that’s a good sign—“
“Not yet. When she gets out. Okay, she’s out of the car now, they both are. Get out of the way you bloody branch…there we go. Transmitting now.”
“Oh, that was one for the ages,” John gasped finally, wiping his eyes. “A criminal gang of posh sixth formers, all with the same name.”
Baker Street, the ordinary rhythms of their life there, Sherlock’s feet in his lap, Sherlock’s clear blue eyes and brilliant smile,
“I’m about to leave to follow them over,” Owen was saying.  “If he’s half a brain he won’t say a word, but it can’t hurt to have a crack at him. It’s all down to you two, I can’t thank you enough.”
Up ahead Sherlock heard a sound of breaking glass and looked up to see Mirzayev punching out the car’s back window with the butt of a handgun. Blood was running down his face, and he seemed to be tangled in something—his legs trapped, maybe.  Sherlock tried to get to his feet, but his leg collapsed under him. He pushed up on his elbow and began to crawl one-armed, dragging his bleeding leg behind him.  “I’m coming,” he cried. He had no idea what he was going to do when he reached the car, whether he was going to shoot MIrzayev or pull him free or shield him with his own body; he just knew he had to get to him. “My father, I’m com—“
Sherlock was much less sanguine. “I don’t want you to go back there,” he said, sitting up in alarm. “That man almost killed you. Can’t you have Dr. Woodcourt take you on as an apprentice or something?”
John was shaking his head. “We can’t. They may have come from the village for all we know. Did your father say anything about the warning, who was threatening you, anything?”
Somehow, in spite of the obliterating intensity, Sherlock did not pass out. But as the overwhelming force began to gradually recede his consciousness followed it out, and he slipped into sleep.
“Oh well, it was worth a try,” Sherlock said cheerfully. “In that case, John and I will be moving into the apartment in the East Wing that used to belong to Great-Aunt Cecily and her companion—you remember, the one who was always embroidering cats on things? We’ll need tutors to catch us up—not too much of a job in my case, but John will need to be got ready for medical school, and I won’t go to university until he does—Mr. Brooke will do for me, and—“
Sherlock was not the only one sleepless that night. As it turned out, they needn’t have worried; Mrs. Hudson had not been second in command of a drug cartel for nothing. When the police got to her—bound hand and foot and covered with Semtex in an empty flat—she’d managed to knock her guard out cold with a well-timed head butt and kick him in the groin a few times for good measure. Fortunately, she’d thought better of trying to free herself while wearing explosives. It seemed to John that Mrs. Hudson was more upset about Connie Prince being murdered than her own abduction. “What are we going to watch now?” she asked John sadly as she was being loaded into the ambulance.
“You want my cock here?” John said softly into his ear, twisting his fingers and pressing. He sat up a little to get a better angle and pushed up into Sherlock’s prostate again. Sherlock whimpered. He seemed to be trying to push his hips up into John’s fingers, but his legs were sprawled out so widely he had no leverage.
Irene smiled behind her wineglass, showing her teeth: the same wicked grin he remembered so well. “I told you, I’m working later. When one’s livelihood depends on appearing exquisite whilst scantily dressed…”
Hobbes blinked, took a nervous breath, and began to sing in a thin uncertain voice: “Who run the world? Girls. Who run this motha--”
Sherlock rolled over onto his back, to look up at John. “John? Would you show me how to punch like you do, so it actually knocks someone down?”
“I’d agree with you, but I’m not some bloke he just met. He loved me before any of this shit happened. You know that, Mycroft, you’re the one that showed it to me.” Mycroft sniffed, looking annoyed, and John went on, “Mycroft. I promise you. I’m not going to hurt Sherlock. I’m going to take care of him like he’s the most precious thing in the world, because he is. You know I can do that.”
John honestly had no idea if Mycroft had persuaded the Americans of the mutual benefit of this, or whether he now owed someone an enormous favor. He decided he didn’t want to know.
Lady Merton looked out the window again. Sherlock could read her thoughts so clearly he thought the maids could probably hear them two floors below.
, were all staying in an enormous house near the beach, and rarely inquired into his activities as long as he turned up for dinner. Phillipe took Sherlock to a tiny little cove, only accessible at low tide, and said, “We can smoke here and no one will notice. It’s our own private beach.”
John took to suggesting longer and longer rides in an effort to keep Sherlock distracted. One fine hot day they went all the way to the quarry, where they could swim in the fathomless blue water. They stayed so late they had to race most of the way back, slowing only when the estate walls came in sight.
“Trevor, I tried to have you killed,” Sherlock said. He was trying to sound exasperated, but the thought of what he had been contemplating still made his throat tight.
“But why?” Sherlock said, frowning. “He’d been gone for two years! Unless they met whilst I was abroad…”
and, thank God, he had work. Sherlock ran his hands through his hair, deliberately shoving the memory of everything that had transpired in the last hour to the back of his mind, and strode over to his desk.
“No, I don’t need it now. The violin helps me think, but I’ve finished with all that; I’ve laid the past to rest for good, I hope.”
, Sherlock had drilled into him: the fact that they were terrified youths anxious to get home through a countryside crawling with soldiers was clear enough.
and then he stepped up again and his boot slipped on the axle grease Sherlock had spread on the third rung and he jerked, making a surprised sort of grunt as his arms flailed, and Sherlock lunged forward, grabbed him by the hair, and cut his throat.
“Ah,” the man behind the desk said. He looked weary, eyes bloodshot as he looked up at them from a mass of what looked like accounts spread before him. John was aware of Sherlock flicking his eyes everywhere, trying to be subtle. “I am Mr. Temple, the headmaster. You have been sent to St. Bart’s to learn a trade and keep out of trouble, so keep out of trouble and you will get along very well here.”
“But it hasn’t,” Lestrade said. “Once I knew I’d be coming to you I told them to leave everything just as it was.”
“Yes.” Sherlock was feeling much better now; he was still smiling, and the hollow feeling was gone. Now that he’d eaten he was beginning to feel sleepy. He was going to go and see the sights of Denver, he decided, and then find a motel and take a nap, and then give Grindr a whirl. No bears. Outside the sky over the flat plains to the east was turning pink, and the diner was beginning to fill up with lorry drivers. “I should probably be going. Enjoy the job. And John?”
. “Bit of bedtime reading? He must have thumbed through it frequently, it’s the only book under the bed without any dust. Let’s see what he was reading, shall we?”
“No,” Mycroft said patiently. “I’m saying you shouldn’t get involved in the first place. Which I said at the time as well, as I recall.”
“I know. He’s not using again, I’m pretty sure of that.” John looked out the window for a minute. He suddenly wanted desperately to confide in someone, someone who knew Sherlock almost as well as he did, and he thought he could manage it without violating Sherlock’s privacy. Well, without violating it too much, anyway. “There’s been some stuff going on, but it’s complicated. Would you be up for a pint in a day or so? After we find the baby?”
Sherlock spent the next few days hobbling stiffly around the flat feeling sorry for himself. Molly dropped by a few times with pastries and a Banoffee pie, which he appreciated, and Mrs. Hudson drove him half mad with fussing, but really he just wanted to heal up already and get back to work.
Sherlock said irritably, “Although that’s an excellent idea--I’ll do it at least until Mr. Brooke goes on holiday himself.”
Sherlock got off the train a little self-consciously, wearing a new t-shirt and jeans from their recent shopping expedition. (He might not have had the nerve if Mummy had taken him to the train, but he could have climbed into his father’s car starkers and his father would have said only, “Bit chilly today, isn’t it? Might want a jacket.”) Rowan was there, his brightness dimming all the ordinary people around him, as usual, but when he caught sight of Sherlock his eyes went dark and hot in a way that Sherlock had not seen before. “Look at you,” he said in a low growl, taking Sherlock by the belt loops and pulling him closer. “Look at this arse,
“Yes,” Sherlock said simply. “You are. Because he is your enemy too, and you don’t have the protection of being dead. Was that his child you were carrying? He is a ruthless man and he will track you down eventually, and you know it.”
“Hey!” Lestrade said. “Wrong league, mate--not that you aren’t a nice kisser, understand.” He grabbed a handful of John’s arse in revenge. “Nice arse, too,” he added.
Curtis Harmon’s attorney met them in the prison reception area. He was a young man, wide-eyed and idealistic, wearing too much aftershave and trying hard to behave as though Aronsen didn’t intimidate him. Sherlock shook his hand politely and promptly deleted him; he wasn’t going to be a problem. A guard recited the rules in a bored tone and took them through a metal detector. The security procedures were a good deal stricter that at Warren, Sherlock observed, although still laughable by Sherrinford standards.
They decided to eat first. John got the little stove going and poured a tin of beans into a pot whilst Sherlock fiddled with the radio. He found the correct frequency and listened intently for a few minutes: two voices he didn’t recognize seemed to be discussing a rendezvous, though as they were using codewords for everything he couldn’t be sure what was going on. When they seemed to have wrapped up he pressed the transmitter and said, “Jacobite One, this is Jacobite...” he hesitated over the unfamiliar pronunciation and John leaned over to say, “Taigh-solais.”
“Are you an omega?” The little girl said suddenly. She was leaning over the seat, and her fair hair tickled his cheek.
The prince watched as the shepherd gathered the flock from the green pasture across the stream. There were more sheep than he had realized, but they clustered together in a great woolly mass and obediently trotted along up the hill. They followed the stream, more or less, heading uphill as the shadows lengthened. The prince followed along too, like a more finely-dressed sheep.
Their streak of good cases eventually ran out, as they always did, and John woke up late on morning after far too much post-case dim sum to find Sherlock sprawled out on the sofa, laptop perched on his chest.
“I’m not really front line material,” Sherlock agreed. “Rather poor at taking direction. It’s a miracle I survived the Order.”
Sherlock hadn’t woken with an erection in years. What on earth was happening to him? He lay perfectly still, hoping that the unwanted heaviness against his thigh would somehow give up and melt away without any effort on his part, but this proved as fruitless as it had in his school days. This was unacceptable. Sherlock did not indulge arousal. This was clearly the pernicious influence of those bloody books, which he wouldn’t be reading if he weren’t on bloody house arrest…oh, he wasn’t even convincing himself. It wasn’t
“A fact that has nothing whatsoever to do with patriotism and everything to do with Moriarty ruining my escape plans when he blew up the Houses of Parliament,” Sherlock said.
Young Tom looked shocked and affronted--Terpisichore was a fine horse, the one Lord Mycroft usually rode--but lowered his head in assent.
Sherlock was prepared to hate Rowan, just on general principles and pure adolescent obstreperousness, and had already established a clear mental image of a slightly older version of Mycroft’s stuffy public-school-stiff acquaintances. But Rowan turned out to be none of those things. He was handsome, with Sherlock and Mummy’s sharp cheekbones, a cheerful Australian accent, and thick fair hair spiked up with gel. He even had an earring! Sherlock was dazzled by the sheer exoticness of it all. And when Rowan turned from booming, “Mike, mate! You’ve hardly changed a bit! Got to get you out of the library more!” to greet Sherlock with a long whistle and “Look how this one’s grown up!
“Well,” John said, “not how I expected to spend my first day as a Lord’s groom,” and then suddenly they were both laughing, doubled over and shaking with the giggles.
The next day turned unexpectedly fair, bright and almost springlike, and Sherlock was surprised to realize that he felt rather cheerful. He had plans today to go to the Veilgarden District with Molly and Henry to visit the bookstore and the bakeshop. Ordinarily Henry’s housekeeper was even stricter than Mrs. Turner had been, but he had managed to convince her to make an exception.
. Like John, he had found the events of that night more of a recognition than a revelation: of course he loved John, he had loved him since the pool, he just hadn’t seen what was right in front of him (although as usual John was an even more unobservant idiot than Sherlock, since John at least had some experience with love and therefore should have caught on a good deal more quickly). Being in love was literally intoxicating. He was drunk on it: dazed by John’s kisses, undone by his hands, unable to focus on anything but the next time John would touch him.
“Not the hat!” John said. He neatly snatched the deerstalker from the air where Sherlock had just launched it in a smooth flight toward the rubbish heap. “You can’t bin the hat. It’s only a bit scorched, look, the rest is just soot. I’ll take it to the cleaners and it will be good as new.”
hand would feel. And then it suddenly struck him that he had two perfectly good hands of his own. Really, what was he holding back for? He had already fornicated and sodomized and was hoping desperately to do it again; touching himself was hardly going to send him to hell at this point. Feeling horribly illicit, John slipped his hand inside his drawers and wrapped it around his straining prick. Well, that was...good...now what? John began to try to mimic the sounds behind him, sliding his fist up and down in time with them, and that was
and then, when he remembered, thinking even more illogically that it would be John on the line. It wasn’t, of course; it was Michael.
“You start with Google. Put his name in, the firm’s name—see what comes up. I’ll do a background check.”
“It’s much closer to London than Reigate Abbey. If Sherlock decides to return to his former profession, you could keep it as a weekend house, or sell it. If not…I think he could be happy writing music there.” Mycroft flipped past the first page, which showed a ridiculously charming little cottage overgrown with wild roses. “There’s a room downstairs currently used as a study that could easily be used as a bedroom until Sherlock is able to manage stairs again. The kitchen has been recently updated…”
“As long as you take poor old Shovel. Sounds like a big party they have coming, we’ll need all the riding horses,” Gregson said, looking harried again.
“Note was a big deal. I mean, you know what he looked like, right? He wanted people to think that nickname, Note, came from C-Note, like it was a joke on his name, like he was money, but it wasn’t. It was because he looked like the guy from that Disney movie,
Sherlock began to shake. “No. I don’t want to. I don’t want to see her. I want to go back.” His voice was rising, sharp and fearful.
“Oh, enough with that, Sebastian Wilkes is his mother’s punishment and not yours, and no woman deserves it more,” Mrs. Gregson said with uncharacteristic sharpness. “And anyway he won’t want to ride if Lord Sherlock’s not here to torment, so he’ll be the maids’ problem and not yours.”
The trees had begun to thin out. After a bit Sherlock asked, “So do you know anything about this man? Angus Crawford?”
“Oh, John, good,” Mrs. Hudson said, bustling out from the kitchen. “Are you taking the early train tomorrow?”
Sherlock stopped and peered inside. The drive curved, and the tall shrubbery behind the wall blocked the house from view; worth a try? He crept inside and into the cover of the tall trees, moving carefully to avoid loose branches. He saw the glow of light before he even glimpsed the house, a handsome stone building with all its downstairs windows brightly lit. No good; the inhabitants were awake and too likely to spot him. Sherlock made his way back the way he came.
“Miss Jones will fill you in on the way,” Mycroft said, stepping aside in a clear signal for Molly to get moving. Molly looked at John a little helplessly and said, “I’ll talk to you soon,” and went meekly out. Mycroft closed the door.
John was so lost in his thoughts that he barely noticed running footsteps until Young Tom clattered up behind him, out of breath. John’s heart immediately stuttered in a panic, but Tom said only, “Help me with Terpsichore? I’m being sent to town posthaste.”
They were all so keyed up, burning with impatience and excitement, that the shock of finding the small room empty almost made John dizzy.
“Aronsen talked to Harmon’s attorney, and got someone at her firm to pull some strings, so we’re set up to meet with him tomorrow,” he said when he’d done.
He was right. “Mrs. Turner says you’re to come to the Commander’s study,” Tilly said, bobbing a sloppy curtsey—all of Tilly’s curtseys seemed ironic. “You done with that tray? I’ll have the fire going when you come back.”
John’s heart leaped, then fell when he saw the Reverend St. John Eyre’s writing. He took the letter to the table to read.
“No—I mean yes, I know what you mean, but that’s not it. It’s not as though I’m even there every day. Besides, I
“Oh, Mr. Phelps claimed to have business in Bath. I think he just wanted to take the waters really, so he said I might return as he had no real need of me there.” Sherlock looked John over. “Burning the midnight oil again, I see...cold chicken and pickle, ugh, you’ll have to clean your teeth if you plan to kiss me.”
“How would that even work? If I were married to the work, I’d be married to him.” They both looked at Sherlock, who stared back inscrutably, and they burst out laughing.
John let himself into the cold dark kitchen and frowned, looking around. “Mary?” He realized belatedly that Mary could be napping, but discarded the idea immediately: the house had the dead, stale feel of a place that has stood empty for hours. He realized he hadn’t seen the car either. Maybe she’d thought of something else she needed from the shops? But no, she would have texted him to pick it up. John checked his phone again: only the text from a few hours ago.
Everyone stood there, startled, for a brief moment before Gerard said solicitously to John, “Cold feet?”
“I’m going to take the blindfold off now,” he said, “and you’re going to kneel by the side of the bed. And then I’m going to fuck your face and come down your throat. All right?”
Sherlock considered. He currently didn’t, but there were always little projects simmering away on the back burner he could look into. “I’ll come up with something. Wednesday, you said?”
John lifted the map higher, tracing a small road with his finger. “I was supposed to look for a road by a pub called the Blue Ball…I’m pretty sure it’s on this road. If you can get me to the road I should be able to follow the directions from there.”
Sherlock exhaled a breath he hadn’t known he was holding. “I need the checque in two days to post with my application,” he said quickly, “but I’ve got to run now, I’ll be late for dinner.” He hung up the phone on his father’s querying voice and grinned at the wooden wall. He knew he’d managed it; his father would have convinced himself this would be the making of Sherlock by the time he got round to telling Mummy. Now he just needed to compose something for his application and tape himself playing something suitably dazzling by day after tomorrow. Piece of cake. Filled with delight at his own cleverness, Sherlock opened the door of the phone cubicle and came face to face with Bruce.
Well, that was...nice, if not particularly the earth-shattering excitement John had always supposed accompanied kissing, but then he had never really had much interest in kissing to begin with. But Callie was soft and warm against him and he found himself wrapping his arms around her, enjoying the soft warmth of her pushing up into his front. Actually, rubbing up into his front. And that was maybe a bit more than nice, that was maybe even exciting. John’s hands had somehow ended up on her waist, he realized as he pulled her more snugly against him. He was now rather breathless, which made the kissing a good deal more messy.
“Ah,” Mycroft said thoughtfully. “The Crown might, at that.” He glanced at John, then turned back to Sherlock. “Well, I will look into it. In the meantime, I believe you are due to rest.”
Sherlock’s eyes flew open and his mouth opened in surprise. John rubbed the ice over his bottom lip, cupping the back of his head when Sherlock wobbled. The cold soothed the pain in his lip even as the rest of him warmed, and the trembling subsided. John lifted the half melted ice cube, tipped Sherlock’s head back to check his mouth, and took the bloody ice to the kitchen.
“Yeah, well, I doubt he’s waiting for your thank-you note. Now go on and tell me what you really want tonight, as you’re doing so splendidly with feelings.”
“You can see him immediately, but he won’t know you are there. He’s been sedated and paralyzed and placed on a ventilator.”
Holmes preened a little. “You’re rather good yourself. I know most people have moral barriers that prevent them from appreciating a well-executed assassination, but really some of yours are practically works of art.”
Sally leveled her finger at him. “Got it in one. Roz thought if she could find some similar cases maybe she could pressure somebody into taking a second look. And she did—she found two. But one of the cases had already been solved, supposedly, although what she found put that into question too, and nobody she talked to wanted to mess with two cases that already had convictions.”
“I’m having the town house cleaned and redecorated, and trying to see what can be done about the servants—Mrs. Wilkes sacked most of ours—but the house should be ready for habitation in a day or so, even if everything is not entirely in place.”
Rosemary Allen opened the door to her windswept cottage and Sherlock felt that prickle again. Mrs. Allen was old, with short-cropped snow white hair and a hunch to her back, but her flat, dark eyes were Jim Moriarty’s.
They had finished their glasses and night had fallen outside; the lights of Geneva glittered beneath them. “They’ll give you the Nobel prize when you’ve got it done,” he said, refilling their glasses. “Not the physics prize, though you should get that ten times over, the
“You go on over to the kitchen,” Gregson said to John. “Missus had a notion he would try to sneak out early, so she’s getting you some breakfast. Sorry I forgot to tell you last night.”
though he did wonder if he’d be able to get him off, but the man was humorous and unselfconscious and generous with his coaching; he gave Sherlock the best blowjob he’d ever had and was happy to share tips after. In Las Vegas he had his first
“You’re not either. I’ve seen Lord Sherlock, and you’re not him. And you mean to tell me that’s a lord’s coat?”
Sherlock melted against him in relief. John had not thought it possible for his heart to break more tonight, but it was aching now. There was a great deal he still didn’t know—the path from “rough” to viciously raped and beaten was fairly murky, for one—but this was enough for one night. One thing was clear, and that was that Sherlock’s injuries were not the only reason they were going to be taking things extremely slowly. Sherlock’s heart was a guarded, fragile thing, and John had no intention of treating it carelessly.
“Ah. Yes.” Logistics; logistics were good. Focus on logistics. “And—lube and condoms, then? Do we all bring our own, or…?
Sherlock took another drink and managed to smile. He thought with grudging respect that Michael was very good at putting people at ease: years of intimidating everyone he met, with his size and celebrity; he’d worked at this. “Not exactly,” he said, relieved to hear his voice sounding more natural. “I was at a Buddhist monastery, in fact. In Nepal.” He’d decided to go with that as soon as he’d heard Irene’s ridiculous story—he actually had spent time in a monastery whilst being dead, so he had a much better chance of pulling it off.
Five minutes. Ten. John suddenly became aware that he needed a piss, but he would stay at that computer until they found Sherlock if it meant pissing his trousers in front of all Whitehall.
Molly went red again, eyes flicking toward the urine container and then quickly back to the slowly-filling tube. “I think he was, um.  Different kind of bad decision. Oh, relax your arm!”
“Got one of his not-entirely-legal contacts to send it through the post, is my guess,” John said. He’d been a teensy bit suspicious that the knife had come from Mycroft himself, but Mycroft was looking convincingly irritated.
As though reading his mind, Jim pulled out a pocket watch and grinned his demented smile. “Two more minutes!” he said brightly. “Any last words? You can talk, Johnny boy.”
John turned on his heel and walked out. His stomach was churning and he could feel his hands balling into fists. He wanted to find Sherlock and talk to him, shout at him, anything to make him see sense; but Sherlock was in one of the bedrooms with a stylishly dressed woman and a multiply-pierced young man, looking over what appeared to be hair dye samples. He did not even look up when John paused in the doorway.
Gradually things settled down at home. They were finally forced to give up on the breastfeeding, which resulted in several days of increased weepiness from Mary, but at least after that Em started gaining weight and began to sleep more than forty-five minutes at a go.  John went back to work, which meant that for several hours a day he was too distracted to agonize about Sherlock.  Mycroft texted him here and there, but mostly to tell him that some hoped-for lead or other had turned out to be a dead end. Nights were the worst: he would fall into a dead sleep as soon as his head hit the pillow, but after he woke to take his turn feeding the baby he inevitably lay sleepless the rest of the night, mind churning with worry.
No. No. It was the unanswerable question, John down in the vault and shaking the box now to see what rattled, Sherlock couldn’t answer, because of course he did not want John to touch him, Sherlock did not want anyone to touch him, he’d put all that aside and locked it away, touching was for ordinary people, not for him, no thank you,
“I can’t do it by myself,” he said finally, and was relieved to hear that his voice didn’t sound as needy as he’d feared.
“No.” Sherlock exhaled softly. “Back to London. I don’t know what’s going to happen then, Mycroft said Father would decide when he returned. Tutors, I suppose. It doesn’t matter, I’ll do anything not to have to go back to Eton.”
Sherlock caught a plane to Chicago, where the gentlemanly basketball player—whose name was Michael Rhodes—was playing that night. Michael Rhodes was a forward for the Los Angeles Lakers. He was six feet seven inches tall, weighed 231 pounds, averaged twenty-seven points per game, had been Rookie of the Year, and won multiple MVP awards. His endorsement deals were reputed to be worth millions. Sherlock had looked all this up on his phone, and had also found a vast number of basketball statistics that meant absolutely nothing to him, although he assumed he could work it out if it proved important.
Sherlock was so desperate he never hear the knock or even the door opening. The only awareness he had that anyone had arrived was the sound of John’s voice, shocked, saying, “What the—oh,
“Right then, I’m off,” Angus said, pushing himself to his feet. “Help yourself to whatever ye find in the cupboard, and we’ll be back in the morning to fetch ye down for the meeting.”
“Yes, but you got my presents, didn’t you? I had to make certain you didn’t end up brood mare for his spawn.” Moriarty shuddered. “Imagine. And then he might have thought he had to bond you.”
“Shh,” John’s voice came, inches from his own mouth, and then John kissed him, and when Sherlock took a breath to demand that John fuck him
“That went well,” Lestrade said cheerfully as Sherlock came out. He was sliding a five-pound note into his wallet. “Come on, I’m to see you home, and your brother’s agreed to a bit of a celebration on the way.”
“So he’ll be willing to help me. The catch would be that he hasn’t seen me since I was a child and would be likely to doubt my identity, but he does know you.”
“So what?” Sherlock said. “Loads of alphas were married to betas before, and it still happens all the time. Alphas with servants, omegas with servants…”
In the morning John and Sherlock distributed their store of goods and shook hands as Angelo had before them. John, after some thought, gave the sharpened nail to the older pickpocket. “Look after him,” he said, not trusting his look to convey the message as effectively as Angelo’s had.
Easter came and went: overlong service, Bondeds in new frocks and fanciful hats whilst beta children were starving in the streets, young girls in white frocks like wedding cakes and hats with veils. Apparently veils were coming in. Almost everyone would be leaving the next day, so there was more milling about and chatting after the service than usual, to Sherlock’s annoyance. At the corner of his field of vision Sherlock caught sight of a Bonded in a pale silk suit waving: at him? Oh God, it was Lord Fitzwilliam. Sherlock turned away as casually as he could but Fitzwilliam called, “Brother Peeeetts!”
“The money is mine. I have a trust; Mycroft has control of it, he always has done; I was not, ah, reliable when I came of age. I used to have an allowance until he stopped it. After…after I got clean, he wanted me to come and work for him, but I didn’t want to, and I wanted to prove to him I could look after myself, so I told him I didn’t want the allowance anymore.” Sherlock shrugged. “I haven’t touched it for years. There’s still a fair amount left.”
“I’ve loved you even longer than that,” he said when he was sure his voice would not betray him. “Since the first moment I saw you astride a horse. I thought you were the most beautiful thing I’d ever seen. It just...took me a little longer to understand. But I’ve always loved you, and I knew from the first that meant I would do anything to protect you.”
It had been almost a year since the last, disastrous time Sherlock had gotten high, but he wasn’t worried. This wasn’t going to be like it had been at the end, last time. He was going to be careful, methodical, just as he had when he first started using. Things would be fine. He took a carefully measured, very small amount, and in a few minutes he was pacing and thinking, his brain flying along like an airplane that had been grounded for a year, and almost immediately he knew what he had to do.
“Wouldn’t fit if I did, but there should be blankets in the linen press,” John told him. “I’m going to look for some food. I’m starving.”
“I’m making a tour of the house, checking to see where there might be any weak points,” Captain Watson said. “I’m sorry we didn’t get to your rooms before you came home, but I’ll do my best not to disturb you.”
“Yes, very helpful, Reilly.” Sherlock appeared over the lab bench, having apparently finished off his coffee. “What do you think, John?”
Kristin was alive and you knew it. Of course I still didn’t know where the money was or what the reason to stay was or how Holmes was mixed up in it, although it seemed the two of them hadn’t run off together after all. I’m kind of embarrassed how long it took me to work it out. I mean, don’t get me wrong, I don’t have anything against gays or anything, but I didn’t realize that
That sounded cruel to John, no matter what the master said, but he was not about to say so. Nor could he ask the other questions burning on his tongue--was writing letters also thought to bring distress? would he be allowed to leave for Christmas? did he still count John his friend? “Well, I hope he settles in soon, my Lord.”
There was a crackle of static and then a new voice said, “Six feet, light eyes, scar from gunshot wound on the chest, able to identify himself in British English, asked what he was looking forward to when he got home and replied ‘a proper cup of tea’.”
The figure in the garden was so small that John’s first thought was that it was a child, but then it pulled out a mobile and the screen illuminated her face as she began a text. John’s mouth opened in a soundless gasp and Sherlock promptly clapped a hand over it. Tafline Jones slipped the mobile back into the pocket of her hoody and moved silently toward the back door. When she reached it she knelt down, pushed back her hood, and unzipped her hoody a few inches. John shoved Sherlock’s hand away and watched, puzzled, as she cocked her head, reached out to push something, and then proceeded to wriggle her way through a small opening in the door.
“’1999’ has a waltz beat, I swear.” Felix held out a hand to Sherlock, who hesitated and then slid off the seat. Oh, why not. “Uh, who leads?”
“It’s not a terrorist attack.” Sherlock whispered. “It’s just as Irene told you, the terrorists are a myth. This is Moriarty, creating a crisis and a power vacuum in one move. It’s why he’s not here. He’ll come swooping back in and take advantage of the chaos to seize command. And this, keeping us here—it’s not for our protection. It would be the worst possible idea if there were really terrorists, they may as well draw a target over the church. We have to get out. Now.”
“Anna Grace Ransome disappeared some fifteen years ago,” Mycroft said. “We presumed her to be the Agra assassin, who seemed to become active about the same time, but there are no known photographs of Agra. Mary Elizabeth Morstan was born in London in 1972 and died two months later. She rose from the dead more than five years ago, when she applied for reciprocity for her Australian nursing certification. The certification is a fake, of course, but Miss Ransome did have a year’s training as a nurse in the military before her exceptional shooting scores aided in her requested transfer to a specialized unit. Miss Morstan was hired as a PRN nurse at a long-term care facility in Worcester, where her mother had supposedly moved. According to the supervisor who hired her, she had recently returned from Australia to care for her dying mother, which was why she only wanted PRN work. In point of fact there was no mother—Erma Morstan died in 1976, a suicide. For the next two years Mary worked the occasional shift, developed a circle of friends, got a master’s degree online in health care administration, and had at least one serious boyfriend.”
Dull, Sherlock thought. Singing did not particularly interest him; all that over-emoting. He let his eyes glaze a little, mind wandering, until it suddenly dawned on him that Tiernan was looking directly at him as he sang. “Oh, when I was in love with you,” he warbled soulfully.
Sherlock was so depressed when he was finally moved back into his bed that he pushed the buttons to draw the blinds, turned off all the lights, and lay in the dark feeling sorry for himself. It didn’t count if John wasn’t there, right? He was so worn out that he actually fell asleep. He woke up to John coming into the room, obnoxiously cheerful as he turned on the lights.
The countryside was rolling and wooded and probably charming, but John was focused on staying on the dark road and doubted he was able to really appreciate it. The passed through a small cluster of dark buildings and a pub, but not the Blue Ball. “I miss Google Maps,” Sherlock muttered from the back, frowning out the window into the moonless dark. “For all we know we’re on the wrong road entirely and…wait, what’s that?”
“I couldn’t go with you in any case,” Mind Palace John said kindly, looking at him over the newspaper again. “You know that, don’t you? Even if I were really here, you have to do this on your own.”
“Thinking,” Sherlock said. He looked terrible. His thin face was pale and bruised from the previous night, his grey eyes heavily shadowed, and John saw for the first time that his fingers were scraped and bloodied. “We need to work on our story.”
“I’m not a girl,” he said, his legs spreading of their own accord. “It’s just—the baths, at home—the oils--“  He had to stop, because he could no longer form words that made any sense. Every bit of his attention was on the hand stroking his thigh, higher and higher and closer and closer and then—
Sherlock rolled his eyes, all tentativeness gone in an instant. “You needn’t bother. I already know what you’re going to say.”
John blinked, trying to force his eyes to adjust to the darkness. Of course it wasn’t a ghost; ghosts didn’t lock doors. It was the omega, whom John had never seen out of his heavy red habit. But what was the ancillus doing out of his…
I needed something to set myself against, Sherlock thought, but all he said was “I’d get sunburnt in Ibiza.”
The soldier standing guard had gone out a few paces, evidently trying to see what was going on at the dock. He turned at the sound of their footsteps and said, “About bloody time, where’ve…”
“Yes,” Sherlock said, sitting forward. “Mr. Rhodes, can you recall where Deana Clark’s daughter was on the night of Levon Singleton’s death?” He felt McGinty startle slightly beside him but Aronsen didn’t move a muscle, which raised her in his estimation.
Sherlock considered. He was angry, not least at Thomasina, but he wasn’t going to get anywhere railing at her. “Very well. I would be delighted to join Lady Smallwood for lunch.”
Sherlock’s father turned out to have had something of a valid point. Reading chemistry at Oxford was a good deal more demanding than taking a few classes at a local college, and his music studies were equally daunting. Sherlock had to work hard, but he liked it that way. Mycroft may have had a point too: he was never bored or stressed enough to resort to drugs; just the occasional tiny hit of cocaine now and again if he had to work through the night more than twice running. He
John appeared in the doorway. “Just wanted to make sure you didn’t fall asleep in the shower again,” he said. “All right?”
Something passed across Wiggins’ face, a dark spasm gone so swiftly Sherlock almost thought he’d imagined it. Wiggins smiled again. “Wrong question, Mr. Holmes.”
“Mmmm.” Mycroft looked pensively into the fire. “Did Sherlock ever tell you that he was captured whilst he was ‘playing secret agent’?”
After a time they turned off onto a winding drive between two massive and rather crumbling gateposts. The house when they came to it was splendid, a massive old Georgian built of warm stone, but the grounds were shabby and overgrown; all the men away at the wars, presumably.
John rolled on top of him again and pulled Sherlock's wrists high above his head, looking down into his fathomless pale eyes. “Idiot,” he growled, reveling in the way Sherlock’s pupils dilated. “After all the trouble I had to save your virgin arse--the prison, Bart’s--you think I’m just going to let you give it away? You are
“I don’t know!” Jessica screamed back. She looked deranged, hair wild and her face spattered with blood, eyes almost as wide as Felix’s. “I thought she was dead! They sent me her hair and her backpack and said they threw her body in a ravine but tonight I got an email from her!”
“Margaret of York. She’s in my embroidery class and she’s always yammering on. I’m wondering if Rachel ever gets a word in edgewise.”
“I see it.” Though most the residents of the village were technically in compliance with the Modesty Code—it was too chilly for bare legs in any case—they were a good deal more casual than John had seen in England; men with open collars and many of the women in trousers. He even thought he saw one wearing jeans. Jeans!
The shepherd’s strong arms comforted him, stroked his hair. “You can’t. Your father would send men to find you. And even if he didn’t, you’d get bored in a day.”
It made no sense. John could not imagine Sherlock letting anyone hurt him, yet he was clearly not angry or upset. Had someone convinced Sherlock that being hurt was something he should expect during sex? If so, John was going to hunt them down, castrate them, and possibly kill them. Right after he killed Moran, of course. He had absolutely no idea how even to begin to approach this topic with Sherlock.
“She’s a beautician,” the neighbor said helpfully. “Does a real nice job too. She did my granddaughter when she got married and she looked so nice…”
“Work camp, I suppose, if he recovers. He won’t be sent back to us at any rate. We’re to get a new captain, but one hasn’t been assigned yet.” Sherlock changed the subject. “So, did I miss anything?”
After a few more unsuccessful attempts at direct interrogation, Sherlock had taken to suddenly tossing out provocative phrases like grenades, in the apparent hope that one of them would jolt John into a reaction. The effect was initially a little starting, but John took it in stride.
“Oh, I think she’ll see us,” Sherlock said, flashing his shark smile along with Lestrade’s warrant card. The receptionist scurried away, clearly afraid, and returned to show them into a large office.
There was a scraping sound. “I’m calling the police,” Mycroft said icily. “Statutory rape is a crime, and no matter what you say—“
disappointing, but there was an email from Donovan. MacDougall had ordered the lab panel and appreciated his suggestion, and Donovan was passing along the rest of that day’s notes. Sherlock noted with a flicker of discomfort that the email had been sent after eight in the evening; she’d stayed late to get him the information again. Reluctant as he was to admit it, Sherlock was unquestionably in Donovan’s debt, a position that made him extremely uncomfortable.
In the lift John took out his phone, turning it over as he considered his options. He was too keyed up to sleep anytime soon anyway, and now he felt as though he would be unable to rest until he understood what had Mycroft’s knickers in such a twist. The lift doors opened and he stepped out, still frowning down at his phone. If he rang, Mycroft would likely just ignore him, but if he texted…everyone read their texts, didn’t they? Even if they didn’t answer.
Mrs. Turner harrumphed. “I’ll tell him, but I can’t answer if he’ll have the time. He’s quite busy in the evenings.”
Lestrade grinned. “Yes she did. She admitted it right away.  But the thing was, she hadn’t seen him in a few weeks, what with the holidays and all. Her story is, he was supposed to come to her house that weekend because his wife was away at a spa. But Friday afternoon she got an email telling her there was a change in plans because the wife wasn’t going away after all, so he’d arranged a surprise for her: a spa weekend of her own. The email also said not to reply because his wife was already suspicious and he was going to break the news that he was leaving her that weekend. Miss Ekland was pregnant, see.”
“Whole-grain toast, just a little bit of butter? I miss toast too.” Sherlock narrowed his eyes and John said, “Okay, no butter, if I can have my whisky back at night. I don’t really care about the eggs.”
“You’ll have to talk to the new housekeeper at the Hall when we arrive,” John said now, climbing back into bed beside Sherlock. None of the surviving servants save Callie had stayed on at Sherrinford Hall during Mrs. Wilkes’s tenure, and most were now well established elsewhere. Mrs. Medlock had retired. John was secretly glad of this, since returning to the Hall as a de facto family member in the great house would have been extremely awkward otherwise.
“As are you,” Sherlock answered, looking her over in turn . “You’ve finally chucked your awful marriage, likely when your youngest left for uni, and you’re quite happy in your current relationship—three years? No, four. He wants you to move in with him and you’re considering it but not really very hard, you like having your own flat at last. Oh, and you’ve got a cat.”
Lestrade went pink. “Oh, no. No no no no no. I’m not even properly divorced. From now on, I’m following in the footsteps of the great Sherlock Holmes: married to my work. You should try it,” he added to John.
This section doesn't have the unambiguous happy ending, but, as promised, it's a nice little break from all the angst.
“Feet off the furniture, if you please, Captain Nicholls.” Mrs. Turner’s sharp voice came from behind him. “Have you some business here or are you merely cooling your heels? It sounds as though you have work to be doing.”
Sherlock nodded. He wasn’t the only one who acted against his best interests. “Shall I ring for lunch?”
John blinked. Hadn’t he? The whole situation was so intertwined, Sherlock and Mary and Magnussen—but of course Ella didn’t know that, she couldn’t know that. John had told her only that Mary had lied about her past.
Yulia came marching up in a t-shirt and jogging bottoms that were several inches too short and handed Sherlock back his coat. She had John’s too. “Thank you,” she said in English to both of them. She glanced up at Sherlock and for a minute she looked like exactly what she was: a sixteen year old in a strange country, all alone.
Sherlock cracked the code in half a day and set John to deciphering the notes—which turned out to be mostly business transactions, to the delight of the drugs team—while he worked out the chemical formulae. The poisoning case was tracked down the first day and the methamphetamine ring on the third. On the fifth, John was puzzling through what he was almost sure was a shopping list when Sherlock, who had been pacing, suddenly stopped stock still and said very softly, “Oh.”
Ryan was on her own phone, apparently talking to her superior at the FBI office.  Sherlock longed to shout at her—he’d
Addleigh Crossing was a fair-sized village on the far side of the forest. There was no direct road to Sherrinford, so John had only been once or twice when out with Sherlock. “I’ll be less conspicuous if I go in on foot,” he pointed out. “Let’s both ride to that little meadow between the woods and the road, and you can stay with the horses whilst I walk into the village. It won’t take as long that way and the horses need to graze.”
“Well, you shouldn’t put off,” Mycroft said serenely, accepting a cup of tea from the ever-helpful Charles.
Michael’s assessment of his father’s relative criminality was of no interest to Sherlock, but the dead girlfriend…a dead girlfriend implied someone killed her, and that implied….
A million thanks to cwb who taught me how to put pictures in the notes. She tried to teach me how to resize it so it wouldn't be, er, a billboard, but that was beyond me.
Sherlock did not argue his feeling that a little quibble like a name on a certificate should carry considerably less weight than being already married, albeit under a different name. “How on earth could you let this happen? You’ve made John’s life into a bad storyline on telly.”
, was getting Sherlock back safely. He thought of Sherlock’s wide eyes, of the livid marks on his thin vulnerable back. He thought,
Sherlock gave a long, put-upon sigh and then sat up briskly. “You will get me full access to your husband’s workplace and associates. I am working for you, not the police, and I trust you can ensure me their cooperation. When I have identified your husband’s location I will turn the matter over to the police, and they will take full credit for the entire process. My name will stay out of the matter and your husband will use his joyful reunion press conference to draw attention to the shameful practices of his business competitors.” Lestrade—or whoever had overruled him—would be embarrassed enough by Sherlock solving a case using the lead he had freely given them without it being public knowledge, and Sherlock really wasn’t about to draw Moriarty’s attention if he could avoid it. “Are we agreed?”
“Oh,” John said. He handed the bottle back to Sherlock. “You keep it, I’m afraid of dropping it now. How exactly are you going to manage selling it though? You can’t exactly go to Mr. Temple and ask to take a cart so you can visit the wine merchant.”
There was a nonplussed silence. “Are you saying you want to hire my niece to be your PA?” Donovan said incredulously. “You realize she’s a kid. And it’s hardly appropriate--”
Mrs. Hudson appeared at the bottom of the stairs and scowled up at him. “It’s Tuesday. And don’t shout. Don’t you have your drugs test today?”
There was a brief silence. John’s mind was already racing, trying to think of plausible reasons, causes, but he could do nothing here, he had to—John stood up so abruptly his chair squealed, and for a moment the buzzing room fell silent.
Mycroft smiled his tight enigmatic smile over the foam in his glass. “I didn’t become the British government by following the rules.”
John cupped his head in both hands and kissed his forehead and then his mouth. Sherlock tipped his face up, a flower seeking the sun, and opened his mouth. John kissed him again, longer, sliding his tongue along Sherlock’s and rubbing his cheekbones with his thumbs, and Sherlock lost himself in the pleasure of it.
,” Lord Sherlock shouted and John shot forward like a rabbit startled from cover. He flew out over the grass, wind in his face and eyes streaming, all but laughing with the sheer joy of riding swift and smooth on a fast horse. He kept his eyes fixed on the direction of the pond, trusting Hermes to see to the ground, filled with the thrill of it, of
“Oh lovely, another diagnosis,” Sherlock interrupted rudely. “Can you put it on some sort of plaque? Mycroft can have a row of school prizes and I can have a row of pathologies.”
“Incoming water is a different division altogether,” Sherlock said. “However, I have the number for the district supervisor, and I know he would very much like to help you.” He tore a piece of paper from John’s clipboard, wrote a number on the back, and handed it to her with a smile. It was completely unconvincing.
The fire did not go out, and when the shepherd returned, water sparkling in his hair and warmth in his eyes, the prince felt again that squeeze around his heart. The shepherd sat next to him and shared out his meagre dinner, and the prince ate with a gusto he never showed for the fine dishes at home and thought privately to himself that the shepherd smelled wonderful, not like sheep at all but like the sun and wind and herbs of the hillside.
, then. John, a soldier himself, did not forgive. Even though he knew the anger was not directed at him, Sherlock was grateful when John smoothed his face before handing him back the letter.
Afterwards Sherlock gulped punch and let himself be hugged by his delighted mother and clapped on the back by his father. Even Mycroft seemed proud, which was a first in Sherlock’s experience. Emily and Rupinder came up and hugged him too, which made him squirm, and Jonathan sighed as though dealing with Sherlock were an enormous pain in his arse and said, “Not bad for a little kid.”
“Of course Irene will ask if you can come,” Molly said at once. “Do you think he’ll let you leave the city?”
A beer suddenly materialized in front of him, a beer clasped in a pale long-fingered hand that caused a Pavlovian jolt in John’s groin before his conscious mind registered the hand as Sherlock’s. “You look thirsty,” a deep voice rumbled in John’s ear.
“Set him here,” John said and knelt beside Leo, who was still struggling to draw breath. “Leo? Can you hear me? We’re going to give you something for the pain, all right? There’s going to be a bit of a sting, Tank is going to hold your hand.” Tank grabbed for it, desperately grateful for some way to help. “His--his brother,” John said, thinking quickly, to the nurse. “His brother is at the storerooms at the school. I’m going to run fetch him.”
had was a dealer. Sherlock had been a careful user—clean needles, no trading sex for drugs—until Mycroft cut him off and careful was suddenly something he could no longer afford. For a while his usual dealer had let him pay on his knees. The man had been callous but not cruel and he liked to grip Sherlock hard on the back of the neck, amused by Sherlock’s submission. They were unpleasant memories, impossible to delete, although nothing compared to what came after.
“I can’t remember Emmy’s face either. But she had ginger hair, and it was very soft and silky. I remember that. I can remember what she sounded like when she was laughing. And...you’re right, we used to sleep like this, and I remember how she felt against me. It was like a hole in the bed, when she was gone.”
Some time later Sherlock woke with a jolt, utterly disoriented. It took him a minute to realize he was still on the sofa, now covered with a blanket. Evidently the combination of starchy food and moronic television had lulled him to sleep after all. Ugh, had he fallen asleep without brushing his teeth? Sherlock never went to be without brushing; he was obsessive about the feel of his teeth.
Chapter 7: From the Friedrich Schiller poem which Beethoven used for the “Ode to Joy” chorus in the Ninth Symphony. The passage translates as “Whoever can call even one soul/his own upon this earth” (shall join the jubilation, and so forth). Sherlock heard this performed in Munich and, being that kind of adolescent, felt that the music was capturing his anguished soul, because certainly no one else in the history of the world had ever loved as Sherlock did.
So Mycroft, John, they’d all been right. He had overdosed after all. “Too bad for you my brother now carries naloxone with him everywhere,” he said coolly.
Sherlock had never seen his brother too flustered to complete a sentence. He looked at Mycroft with a surge of unfamiliar compassion. “Because I’m a scientist,” he said gently. “You’re a…” He hunted for a flattering term. “…statesman. You decide how the world should be and you make it that way. Scientists know that the universe is bigger than we can possibly imagine, and it can always surprise us.”
John waited until he retired that night to open his parcel, less out of a desire for privacy than anticipation. Inside he found a heavy woolen comforter, a jumper, and what seemed to be an extremely thick pair of socks. He turned them over, puzzling. These would never fit in his boots; what was he to do with them? They seemed lovely and warm though--they were lined with a velvety soft flannel--so John put them on while he opened the letter. They
“I’m going out,” John said, sticking his head in the lounge. Sherlock was where he’d been for the past few days: hunched over the desk scowling at a stack of crime scene reports Lestrade had apparently got stuck on. “Might be late.”
McGinty considered this and nodded. “Yeah…she’s got nothing to gain by talking to us, you’re right. Go ahead.”
They watched television for another hour or so. John didn’t register a thing on the screen. He tried to act as though he were just tired after a long week, but he had a suspicion Sherlock saw right through his inattention.
“Please, sir, if I may,” John said hurriedly, “his speech is slow, sir, he had the summer fever, a few years ago.”
“No thanks, I’m fine.” She pushed the laptop toward him so he could log in, then tapped away on the screen. “Hey,” she said, grinning at the screen in a way Sherlock had never seen before, the smile transforming her stern face into something bright and lovely. “Roz? I’ve got him right here. This is Sherlock Holmes. Holmes, Rosalind Corwin.” She stepped away, pulling up a chair to the side.
If he hadn’t asked the first question, John would have assumed Sherlock was telling him that he wasn’t interested, that he was asexual, but Sherlock had admitted to attraction, at least, so…John took a deep breath. “Why not?”
Sherlock made a face at the phone. Probably forms or something he was meant to sign. He pushed himself up and scuffed at his hair, hoping his temporary disability excused him from offering refreshments.
Molly held up an enormous gladiator sandal, unable to stifle her giggles. “I won’t be able to sit through Sunday services again without wondering who wears these at home.”
Sherlock sat for a moment, considering this. He had a bad feeling he was not going to like where this conversation was going, and obviously John had liked it even less. There was the additional unpleasant fact that he had no idea what Mycroft was talking about. “Go ahead and gloat and get it over with. And then tell me everything from the beginning.”
John gestured awkwardly at the chair. “Well, it’s certainly very…” Unprecedented? uncharacteristic? unbelievable? Sherlock wondered. “…considerate of you to come by.”
“Really? You seem quite healthy to me. Be advised, boy, that malingering to get out of your duties will not be tolerated as it may have been in the past.”
Whatever he’d been expecting, it wasn’t this. Because aside from anything else, he’d assumed the man in the black uniform to be dead.
“That’s how law enforcement usually reacts to me. Give Rodriguez a few days and he’ll be doing it too.”
“Allegedly,” Lestrade said quickly. “There’s no proof. That’s why he wasn’t taken into custody there, though he was expelled from the school.”
Sherlock reached out with one red-gloved hand and picked up the pill bottle, which had a handwritten label:
Sherlock had just rounded the steps onto the third storey landing, thinking about Effie’s brother and about Commander Smith’s creepiness and making no particular effort to be quiet, when he came face to face with Captain Watson. “What are
“Cat case is up,” John told Molly. They were sitting companionably in the lab, feet up on the counter, drinking coffee and watching Sherlock faff around with the spectrometer.
The boy’s eyes went wide and Sherlock added swiftly, “Though you ought to stop. Your acne would clear up loads.”
“No, don’t,” John said, reading his mind with unnerving accuracy and pulling his arms away. “I love every inch of you thin or fat; you’re the most beautiful thing in the world to me no matter what.” He went right to work proving it, kissing down every prominent bone and into the hollow cave of Sherlock’s abdomen. It all felt wonderful, like a feast after a long case, and Sherlock soon forgot his self-consciousness and wriggled under John in delirious abandon. It did not take long for them to be panting and rutting against each other.
The prince made his way gratefully to the spring and drank his fill, taking a few moments after to strip to the waist and wash the sweat and dust away. He thought longingly of his bath at home, the attendants holding towels, the scented oils. This shepherd was mad. Perhaps he had simply never known the pleasures of a bath. Probably smelled like the back end of a sheep, the prince thought uncharitably, ignoring the way his pulse quickened at the thought of getting close enough to find out.
Mycroft finally nodded and Sherlock stood in the doorway as he left, listening to his brother descending quietly down the stairs so as not to disturb Mrs. Hudson. He went to the kitchen, considered the almost-empty whisky bottle, and poured the last of it into a glass. Then he went to his chair by the fire.
He gripped harder and yanked Sherlock back against him, driving impossibly deeper. At this angle Sherlock couldn’t have gotten a hand underneath to touch himself even if John had let up but John was too far gone to stop--he’d take care of Sherlock afterward, he’d slide his fingers into Sherlock’s entrance all stretched and slippery with John’s semen and stroke him, Sherlock was ridiculously sensitive to prostate stimulation--and the thought of touching Sherlock there when he’d already been used and filled with John’s come somehow made John even
Sherlock hesitated, his face going pinched for the first time. “I have to see the door when I play,” he said slowly. “And bolt it.”
Could he shelter in the trees? At least it was a bit of cover, but in full daylight he might still be spotted, and besides he was desperately thirsty. He came to another opening, this one with a sign reading “ROSE COTTAGE”. Below the sign, so old and faded it was barely recognizable, was a crude painting of a smiling cat.
Molly blushed, the red rising from her collar to her hairline like a slow-motion tide. “John added some more tests this week. Didn’t he tell you?”
century Anglican hymn “Not here for high and holy things”. In this universe, it is John’s favorite hymn. These are the first two verses:
“Here we go, I’ll start on this lot,” Janine said, pulling out a stack of folders. “Who else should we do? How about this one, doesn’t he own the Kensington football club?”
Sherlock considered. “He could have given us away easily tonight, far more easily than at a dockyard pub. If it’s a trap, I can’t see the point of it.” He looked into the fire a long moment. “We’ll meet him,” he said finally. “But we’ll make sure to look it over very thoroughly, just in case.”
Harmon nodded. “Lot of the police were still loyal to him too,” he said. “All those guys, they all went to school together; he was still connected.”
John sighed. “I’ll tell you what. I really need that laundry put in the dryer or I’ll have nothing to wear tonight. If you stay around and take care of it, I’ll text you where we’re going to lunch and sit as close to the window as possible. That way you won’t have to follow me and you can still spy on us.”
Two women burst out laughing—John wasn’t sure why—and one, who had a commanding air John associated with army nurses of a previous generation, said, “Professional meddler, are you?”
“I really can’t tell,” Sherlock went on. “But I rather think you understand the purpose, if nothing else. The Latin is
John jumped, sloshing tea onto his lap. “Bloody--sorry, sir, so sorry.” Dr. Woodcourt was standing just behind him, surveying Sherlock quizzically as John blotted at the tea. “Ah, our employer made sure we had plenty of books in the servant’s hall, he, Lord Sherrinford, he was a great educational reformer and Stephen, er, he loves chemistry and, and…” John trailed off, unable to come up with any reason why Lord Sherrinford, educational reformer or not, would think his grooms learning German a sound investment.
“Think we’re done here,” Lestrade announced cheerfully. He left them to go over to a woman who appeared to be in charge of the police contingent, leaving John alone with Sherlock for the first time.
deadly dull, and there might be a chance of a private conversation with Lady Smallwood, one that would not have to be conducted in Braille—but just now he was too distracted by Margaret of York’s absence to pay attention.
Sherlock stepped forward carefully, almost reverently, and knelt to pick it up in his gloved fingers. “What is it, is it a driver’s license?” John asked.
Sherlock’s breathing slowed. He understood that he had been shaking, and that the shaking had eased, and finally stopped. He could feel John stroking his hair, hear his occasional soft nonsense murmur:
Back at the cave, John built up the banked fire and blew it to life, then took the paper Sherlock had already tossed aside. He read more slowly than Sherlock, so was only halfway through his second paper when Sherlock threw his last one down and stood.
Sherlock looked at the shadowed face of the dark-haired boy in the picture, who was ducking his head as though hoping not to be seen, and felt his neck prickle.
She did, at length. “Moriarty had paid my landlady off to watch my rooms, but I sussed that out quickly enough. He probably had someone on the take at my bank too, but I was not such a fool as to keep all my accounts in one place…” It was an exciting story and John wished Sherlock could have been there to hear it. “So after convincing Sir Percy I could be trusted, he has tasked me with delivering a message to the other men of conscience opposed to Moriarty who have taken refuge in Edinburgh. I thought I would stop here on my way north and make arrangements so that you could travel with me on my return.”
Sherlock glanced over to him. John could see him weighing the options, his word to Mary against the chance to keep Garrison talking, possibly gain some advantage. “Tell me.”
Eventually John had satisfied himself that his work was as perfect as a clerk with no actual education could make it, and he extinguished his lamp--the last one still lit in the large room--and headed for the door. He was tired, but it was not the pleasant weariness of a long day’s riding or physical labor; his back and neck ached from stooping over the desk. He decided to walk home. It was a fair distance, but it would feel good to stretch his legs.
even as he tried to focus on how Michael liked it, what made his breathing pick up. Sherlock had exceptional powers of observation. It did not take long before Michael too was tensing, groaning in shameless abandon as he came all over Sherlock’s hand.
Mycroft glanced over at John’s cards pityingly. “Well. Good thing we weren’t playing for real stakes.”
“Your weight is well within the normal range for a British woman your age and anyway, that extra five pounds is all in your breasts because you’re nursing.”
“Of course he didn’t. He’s bent as a corkscrew,” Sherlock said. “Remember when he came for the inspection at the convent? It was obvious then. And I’ve seen him every Sunday making eyes at his undersecretary. That’s who will have done the job, Anne fancies him too; they’ll have all gone at it together--either the commander watched or maybe the undersecretary let him have a go at him whilst he was mounting her. She probably thinks if she plays her cards right she can convince the commander to make a permanent arrangement of it, but that’s a mistake. The undersecretary doesn’t give a fig for either of them and he’ll be up for his own ancilla soon. He’ll be off like a shot.”
lot, so he turned quickly and made his way to a smaller café he sometimes frequented down a less populous side street.
John sighed and followed him, the damp warm air hitting him like a wave as it always did. It was well after midnight and the street was quiet except for the noise in Ellis’ house. Sherlock was moving restlessly about the tiny patio liked a caged tiger, both hands buried in his hair.
John tugged Sherlock’s head against his side so they could both pretend he did not see. “Let’s see what’s on the telly,” he said, turning it on and flipping around until he found
Rowan’s hands slipped a little lower and back, almost on Sherlock’s buttocks, and Sherlock felt the strain in his button fly again. “Like this. Back and forth. It’s like sex, yeah? Find the beat.”
into a catheter bag on the side of the bed—but how could he ever make Mycroft understand the rest of it? How to explain that he’d made peace with losing John, with his own death, and had gone willingly and bravely to make that sacrifice, only to find out that it had been for nothing? That here he was back in this place, hurting and afraid once again: that he would ruin things with John, that he’d never been meant for a relationship, that he couldn’t stay clean, that he would fail. His eyes burned traitorously and he clenched his jaw as well. “I don’t know,” he bit out finally, hating the desperation in his voice. “I have everything I ever wanted so
John descended the stairs with a spring in his step. He liked Ana, who was funny and easy to talk to, and there had definitely been sparks when they’d kissed that last time. Besides, it was their third date, and she’d mentioned being off work the next day. A good shag was exactly what he needed to get his head back in order.
And you’re not a, a monster magnet. You’re a magnet for ex-army doctors with illegal firearms and excellent taste in jumpers.”
“Hey,” John said, now peering into Sherlock’s face in concern. “Sherlock? We don’t have to say anything. It’s nobody’s business but ours, though Greg’s our friend, and I know he’ll be happy for us. But I don’t want to do anything you’re not comfortable with.” John was using his gentle voice, the one that made Sherlock simultaneously insanely irritable and filled with the desire to crawl into his jumper like a burrowing hamster.
“Of course I’m right,” Sherlock said with maddening certainty. He tilted his head. “My neck feels cold.”
“That’s all very well, but I don’t hold with omegas moping about indoors all day. It’s not healthy. Why we haven’t yet had a happy announcement, I shouldn’t wonder! You’ll be taking your constitutional every afternoon rain or shine now I’m in charge.”
“More so in the cities, I think,” John answered. “The ladies that were taken up and, er, mistreated—that was in Blastburn, or maybe York. We’ve had not trouble in the countryside, nor likely to, I should think. Sir Willoughby’s a fair master and a just lord; there’s none with cause to complain. My father died in a barn fire a few years ago and Sir Willoughby let my mother stay on in the cottage, rent free, until we were grown.”
“Yes. He was shot in the upper arm and beaten for information, according to what he told me. There’s significant damage to his face and arm and the care he received after was fairly rudimentary—we’ll have plastics and ortho round in the morning to see what can be done. The X-ray reports are in there.”
Having finally run out of ways to put it off, Sherlock climbed the stairs slowly and peered into the wreckage of his flat. When he stepped inside, ash stirred up from the debris at his feet and drifted lazily in the muted light, like dust motes. He stood for a moment letting his eyes adjust to the dimness. Something bulky was blocking the door and he stooped to touch it: the client chair, now bent and mangled.
Freshly shaved and showered, Sherlock stood in the guest room of Irene’s house and dressed in his clean black suit. Then he looked at himself in the mirror, considered a moment, and took off the jacket and pants, replacing them with his jeans and leather jacket.
Sherlock shrugged. “I cough all night and it makes my chest hurt, and I can’t lie down properly to get comfortable. I wouldn’t sleep well in any case.”
“It could explain why he doesn’t want to talk too much about the relationship, too. He might think that you wouldn’t understand.”
They reached the top of the hill and started down and distantly John heard the sound he had been listening for: the faint
“Good thing that headboard’s attached to the wall,” he finally managed, when he thought he could speak a full sentence again.
“Our guy has some nerve,” Roz said when they were back on the freeway. “Even if he backed right up to her apartment, even allowing it was the middle of the day—he must have had blood all over him. And what did he even put the fetus in?”
The man had been between him and John. He would have kept them apart, he would have—he had to go. Sherlock gripped the knife in his right hand and wrapped the rag around his left. He peered down the ladder, saw blood, saw nothing else, heard nothing at all, and swung himself down from the top rung without stepping on the ladder.
what?” John asked when he came in the kitchen that afternoon for some bread and cheese and found everyone buzzing.
Sherlock looked at her with new interest: he hadn’t thought of her as particularly observant. “Adler looked all right too,” he said, forking up a bit of icing.
Hobbes looked down at her cup and took another sip, but Sherlock had seen the look in her eyes, and for once he did not have any trouble recognizing it. He had seen that look in his own mirror often enough over the past few weeks. She wanted to believe him. She wanted to hope.
“I read history,” Gregson said. “Liked it rather well; thought about making a go of it as an academic, in fact, but.” He lifted one shoulder. “Seemed a bit dull. Ivory tower and all. Still, I keep my hand in a bit, read quite a lot, last century in particular. ”
“I think I’m due a break,” John announced, stretching. “I’m going to get Thai, I’ll bring you some iced coffee. Sherlock? Getting anywhere?"
The servants’ Christmas was quiet that year as there was no family in residence, so they had their festive tea a bit earlier than usual. Everyone was impatient for the box.
“Well.” The tension in Sherlock’s tight shoulders eased a little. “I may qualify as a veteran, but that doesn’t mean I can extrapolate from my own homecoming experiences. I was hoping you could help me with that.”
Sherlock’s eyes faltered away from John. When he looked back, the bland hauteur was gone. “You can’t tell anyone. He’s not—they don’t know he likes men. You mustn’t put anything—“
At that moment there was a knock at the door and the footman stood aside to announce, “Sergeant Lestrade, my Lord.”
The sniper dropped like a stone and John shoved him out of the way with his foot, darting forward and flinging himself onto his belly to look through the rifle scope. For a second he saw only a collapsed figure on the path
“So,” Mycroft said. They were in Mycroft’s weird and slightly dungeon-esque office in Whitehall this time. “A subordinate of mine has received an unofficial request from an American counterpart. As a matter of policy, all such inquiries are vetted by me, of course.” He gave John his insincere, tight-lipped smile. “It seems that six years ago, a CIA agent named Kristin Amburgey disappeared during an operation in Pakistan. She was assumed dead. For reasons that were not disclosed, our American comrade now suspects that she did not die but instead assumed a new identity and is presently living in the UK. He requests that we locate her, if possible.”
government which resulted in the incarceration of opposition leaders in their most punitive facility has predictably resulted in bringing those leaders into closer proximity than they would have managed themselves had they remained at liberty. As a result, Sherlock reports that he has been able to negotiate an alliance. The leaders of the Western-leaning and Islamic parties have arrived at a tentative power-sharing agreement and a plan for new government. Some diplomacy may be required with our American allies and Russian intervention is still a concern, but if elections proceed as planned next month, I have every hope for a favorable outcome.”
Sherlock rolled his eyes and caught John’s cringe of embarrassment. His phone buzzed in his hand, and he looked down to see a text from Violet:
“Oh for—“ John snapped his jaw shut on the words as Sherlock spun on his heel and stalked back to his chair, flinging himself onto the seat. Were they really going to do this? Have the fight they’d never had out loud, the one that went
“Er, it’s Dr. Watson, actually,” John said, letting go of Paolo and turning slightly away. “We’ve found Paolo and he’s fine, but there’s been a bit of an, ah, emergency back home; someone close to him has cancer…”
“You saw me watching you, didn’t you,” John said. He was still gripping Sherlock’s arse, grinding them together. “You’re waiting for me.”
“Yes.” Sherlock said. His free hand found John’s and their fingers laced together on the bed. John leaned over to kiss him again and the movement shifted him deeper and Sherlock arched his neck: “Mmm.”
“Want me to lie down with you for a bit?” he asked, and Sherlock broke into a somewhat tattered version of the radiant smile John only seemed to get when Sherlock was half drugged. “All right. Go clean your teeth, I’m just going to clear this away. And put on some more salve!” It was only late afternoon, but John rather thought he wouldn’t mind a bit of a lie-down himself; the day had been exhausting. Sherlock would undoubtedly sleep clear through until tomorrow, but John would just rest a bit until Mycroft showed up.
John decided to ignore him. He would delete the annoying surgeon, just as Sherlock did. It was surprisingly easy…of course, that might have been the morphine. He was hazily aware of being rolled along and then jostled onto a table, and then a soothing voice told him to count backward from ten, and that was that.
Miles was silent a moment. “Okay,” he said finally. “You’re right, this has to stop, or eventually the police are going to get involved anyway. But you didn’t hear it from me. I’m fairly sure I know who Danny was buying that from.”
Sherlock couldn’t help crooking her a half smile, even though it hurt his face. The fact that Mycroft paid Mrs. Hudson to keep an eye on Sherlock was no secret between them; she deducted it from his rent.
The gunshot was loud in the enclosed space of the hallway, momentarily deafening Sherlock. He grabbed instinctively for his own gun but something was wrong: his right arm would not move, and there was a painful pressure across his chest, as though he had had the wind knocked out of him. He was on the floor.  Sherlock heard running footsteps over the ringing in his ears, then shouting; he scrabbled for the gun with his left hand but couldn’t find it, and then the lights came back on and Sherlock was staring directly at the mangled wreck of his right arm. The bullet must have gone right through his humerus just over the elbow; Sherlock could see edges of bone in the torn flesh. Then the pain hit.
John looked down. Sherlock’s arms were stretched high over his head, making him look even longer and slimmer than usual. His eyes were closed and his mouth was open and panting. His cock was hard against his flat abdomen, dark and wet at the tip; his pale skin seemed to glow in the dim light, and his hips undulated against where John’s hand was pressed into his body. He was beautiful, a bit out of his head with lust, and utterly within John’s power. John felt a familiar throb of desperate tenderness. He slid his free hand under Sherlock’s head and brushed his lips over Sherlock’s forehead. “Do you remember the day I taught you to swim?”
“You’ve been drinking,” Sherlock said suspiciously and then in annoyance, “You’ve been drinking with
“What!” Molly was furious. “No. Absolutely not. What are you thinking? We’re bonded now, there’s no way I’m leaving you.” Irene opened her mouth but Molly overrode her: “And anyway, this is my bloody country too. I didn’t run before, and I’ve damn well not running now.”
Sherlock turned moodily back to his computer. The website was just as unrevealing as the phone call, so he went digging as he munched his way through the tray. Nothing, nothing and more nothing. Regal Florist was to all appearances a legitimate, law-abiding, tax-paying business, albeit in a rather shabby street; its delivery van showed signs of being driven by an Eastern European who liked to strip the gears, although it was hard to be certain of that in a Google Earth photo.
John’s brave expression fell right off his face and he had to swallow hard a few times. Right. Surgical waiting room. Loo first; he’d been dying to go for ages but hadn’t want to leave Sherlock. Then a cup of coffee. Yes. John took a deep breath, squared his shoulders, and marched out.
Lestrade had every intention of shouting some more, but something about Sherlock’s stiff, defensive back gave him pause. Come to think of it, he hadn’t seen John since that night they’d shut down the White Hart. Had they had some kind of falling out? Or was John just…getting on with his life?
“So what do you think?” Lestrade asked. “Nothing seems to be missing, and as I told John, he was apparently well liked.”
“For one thing, the ancilla’s carrying on a rather serious flirtation with the guard captain. It’s not quite an affair, not yet, she’s got some romantic notion of holding out for her heat. She’d better stick to it because Moran chose her for her virginity. He likes to make his partners cry. Usually the guard captain is the one who checks her lock at night and they spend their time together then, but it seems that Moran goes out quite a bit, and then the housekeeper has to lock her in. But some nights Moran goes out so late that the guard captain does the honors, but he can’t stay, and that makes her cross.”
It was beginning to sink in for Sherlock that not only was he not going to be back on his feet in a few weeks but that John was not either, at least not in the metaphorical sense. Still: again, they’d survived Sherlock’s suicide, John’s wife
that he could wrap his hands around Sherlock’s long feet, hear the deep rumble of his voice, see his pale thin face intent on the newspapers.
“I’m not robbing a grave for you,” John warned. Soil from a fresh-dug grave was still Sherlock’s holy grail, as he knew very well.
Sherlock tensed visibly, shoulders drawing together and biting on his lip, and then said rather stiffly, “I’ll give you a lift. To the train station in Harrogate; that way you needn’t worry about getting wet.”
It took John a minute, but finally he focused the binoculars on the little patch of stone where an indistinct huddle of fluff seemed to be. “That’s the nest? It looks so bare.”
“Fairly certain we’ll both be fucked,” Sherlock muttered and then they both laughed, silently and heads down to avoid notice, because it had still been funny back then, back before it was real.
By Tuesday morning the only thing that kept Sherlock from suffocating himself with his own pillow when he woke up was the thought that at least he’d get to leave the flat for his drugs test that day. He sighed, regarded his hard-on with disfavor—the morning erections persisted in spite of his stubborn refusal to indulge them—and padded morosely into the bath for his cold shower. He stripped off his pyjamas and then it hit him: the day was February the first. He’d been clean an entire month.
“Well.” John shrugged a little helplessly. “The heart wants what it wants, I guess. I mean, haven’t you ever wanted anybody? Even a little?”
John was beginning to suspect that Mycroft was coming to need his company as much as John needed his, but he was still surprised and a little grateful that Mycroft was taking the time. “Fine. But I’m paying this time, and I’m picking the place.”
Sherlock rolled to his side in turn. He’d never seriously considered bonding in his life, the idea was preposterous, but now… “I do want to.”
“Well, we’re joining up with some other trails out of the valley fairly soon, so we can just follow the signs. Or the other hikers.”
Sherlock arrived home to find the rest of his family having drinks on the terrace. His mother looked up and smiled. Mycroft took one look at him—hair stood on end, sunburnt, reeking of cigarettes, lips wildly swollen, still slightly hard—and opened his mouth, but Mummy said pleasantly, “Mycroft, drink your wine.”
Irene, as it turned out, had gone to France in early December with one of the silent opposition (“some secret errand, they love their cloak-and-dagger, those boys, they’re worse than Seven”) but had been annoyed to discover that the man’s liberality did not extend to including a woman in their schemes. He was far more interested in having Irene in his bed away from the sharp eyes of his wife. Rising tensions between the two nations and inclement weather had combined to delay their return by several weeks, which had resulted in Irene’s late arrival in Blastburn. Recently she had been corresponding with some of her other connections back in Edinburgh, trying to get some idea of who in London might be trusted--her previous contact had been caught and executed for treason--but thus far had been unsuccessful.
“I’ve gone by during the week after my appointments.” Sherlock closed his eyes as though ashamed to admit this to John, though his voice stayed quiet and calm. “I couldn’t quite manage going in. You could take the bus back Sunday and catch the earlier train, if it makes you feel better.”
The van came to a halt and Sherlock heard the slam of the driver’s door. Thank God, not a roadblock. A minute later the back door opened and John’s voice said softly, “Sher—oh,
Sherlock had warmed up now, but he still didn’t fancy a cold beer.  He ordered a whisky without ice and went back to considering his route. Having got bored with looking up natural wonders, he began investigating which cities had the best options for gay bars. Leather? Hmmm.
John grabbed for the rifle grip, lining up the sight, just as Sherlock turned toward Moriarty and Moriarty shot him. John heard the shot but did not see it, because in the next breath his finger tightened on the trigger and he blew Moriarty’s head off. He scanned wildly for Sherlock. Sherlock was—shit, Sherlock was on the ground, he seemed to be moving feebly but he was down,
, so good, you’re incredible, I want to just fuck you so bad…” He wasn’t exaggerating; the short shallow slide was making him as crazy as his teasing had Sherlock a few minutes ago.
“No!” Sherlock cried. “You said you wouldn’t hurt him, you promised you’d leave him alone if I did what you want!”
John shook his head. “Of course not. He’s the classic self-medicator who’d never trust anti-depressants because of the side effects. Anyway, he really probably needs mood stabilizers and he’d never go for that. He
They went up two flights and out into another narrow hallway. Sherlock flicked his eyes along it, said “that one” and led John to a door halfway down. He had the lock picked in seconds and they ducked inside the dark, empty room.
Something blinked on the monitor, but Sherlock’s drooping lashes did not even flicker. John swallowed. He wanted to kiss Sherlock more than he could remember wanting anything, but not like this, in the middle of a case, with so much unspoken between them. When he made his move he would do it properly, with all Sherlock’s attention on him. He uncurled his hand from Sherlock’s neck and gave his head a final, gentle squeeze. “If you get to a hundred, text me, and I’ll buy that fancy French jam in the pink jar,” he said, surprised at the steadiness of his own voice as he pulled away.
breathing,” Sherlock hadn’t been. He could just barely see John in the dark but he was as acutely aware of every inch of him as if John had been bathed in floodlights. “I….”
That was what John told himself, over and over the next few days. No one knew; no one could possibly know but the two of them. It had been the middle of the night, the rest of the house deep in exhausted sleep; even Phillips had been snoring in tandem with Pitts when John had slipped past his room on the way down the stairs. No one would ever know, as long as he kept his head and didn’t let it happen again.
“Hmmm.” Ella scribbled something on her pad and looked back up at him. “When he left, last winter, you had some conflicted feelings about the situation. Do you think we need to talk about any of that?”
Sherlock bounded into the lab all ready to tell Molly how much better he’d been feeling since he’d swapped sweets for antacid chews—the last time he’d broken into Mrs. Hudson’s flat he’d found a brand-new economy-size bottle, with a note affixed reading NEXT TIME JUST ASK—and begun eating regular meals, but Molly seemed curiously reticent. She held out a specimen cup without meeting his eye.
Sherlock managed to get to the road and into a cab, though he had to ring Mrs. Hudson on the way to have her bring down some cash. Fortunately she was in; even more fortunately she had her Sunday baking in the oven and didn’t stay to bother him with questions. Sherlock wobbled out onto the pavement, his legs like water, and then the sparkles in his vision cleared to show John, striding down the street from the direction of the gym. John gave him a stiff nod, then stopped and frowned. “You okay?”
be it. Swiftly, before he could change to his mind, Sherlock got to his feet and strode to the loo, where he emptied the contents of the little bag into the toilet, flushed it, and binned the empty bag for good measure. Then he leaned his head against the wall and tried to consider what to do. He had intended to return to his experiment, but he was light-headed and trembling from the single cup of coffee on an empty stomach and suddenly wanted only to be in bed. The experiment would wait until tomorrow. He decided to just leave the rest of his things at the lab and went straight back to his rooms, where he curled into bed sure he would sleep until midmorning and wake with a clear head. Instead four AM found him wide awake, dry mouthed and shaking, sweat drying cold on his skin from a nightmare he could not quite remember.
“I sent him a copy. He probably never even listened. Here—“ Simon handed John his phone as he put the car in gear. “Plug in the cord, there, and look it up in the music files. I believe the name’s ‘Winter Solstice’, or maybe ‘Winter Solstice SH’.”
Sherlock, caught, looked ashamedly away. John set the bags of food down, went over to him, and pushed the button to raise the head of the bed.
‘There’s some sort of trouble back in London, and Lord Mycroft is going down in his father’s stead,” Young Tom explained. “The Earl and most of the guests are off on that big picnic outing...and so are all the conveyances.”
John listened and nibbled at his plate, asking the occasional hopefully-not-too-stupid question and refilling their cups as they drank down the tea, and was genuinely surprised to find the pot empty and the two hours nearly done. “You’ll have to make sure one of the proud parents sends you a recording when they sing it,” he remarked.
“No family. Pitts is covenentated—that means there’s an ancilla, so you’re responsible for her too. Moreso than the rest because they’re property of the Crown.”
“Gladly.” He meant it; Sherlock loved this bit, always had. “Mrs. Reilly’s been sleeping with Commander Moriarty from the beginning; it’s obvious, just look at her underthings—well, the outline of her underthings under her clothes. Moriarty kept Brother Hosea in the country as long as he could and promised Mrs. Reilly he’d be packed off as soon as the babies were born, but then he told you he’d changed his mind, didn’t he? What did he say, that five babies were just too compelling, people would wonder if he didn’t ask? You were the one who told the doctor Hosea was having mood swings and asked for the pills. You gave him one at dinner, yes, but you put at least one more in the milk, maybe two, forensics can manage to check that much, maybe even a quantitative blood level depending on time of death, probably a lot more than a drop of brandy as well. That knife is brand new, it didn’t come from the kitchens, you bought it. Bridget will verify she’s never seen it before. No one would sell a knife to a handmaiden, especially a pregnant one, but they would to a housekeeper and if Lestrade’s lot haven’t gotten even less competent they should be able to find out who.
“I know.” John nuzzled against his cheek, brushing his lips across Sherlock’s lips and cheekbones. Sherlock closed his eyes. People weren’t meant to feel this much, at least not Holmes people, and he was already so full of feeling that if he kept looking into John’s eyes he was going to come apart at the seams.
“I don’t know if I can help much,” Jayla said. “I told the police back then, I was asleep all night. I didn’t know anything happened until I heard about it on the school bus the next day.”
Everything seemed to blur together after that. He was aware of drinking frantically, desperate for relief from both the thirst and his own awareness, of the ache in his arms and legs from his constant frantic rutting and pumping. He heard his own hoarse voice, distantly. He tried to fuck himself with one of the empty water bottles and found that he could press it in in such a way as to mimic—he assumed—the pressure of a knot, which finally made him come hard enough that he actually blacked out for a brief, blissful stretch of time. When he woke, his arms were so rubbery from exhaustion that he could barely reach for a fresh bottle. Within minutes he was rocking again, driven by the desperate pulsing need between his legs:
“It doesn’t start until tomorrow. We’re at a reception right now. It’s pretty good—I’ve run into some people I know, and we’re all going to go to dinner in a bit.”
“Certainly not. As I was saying, Sherlock’s injury was an unintended consequence of the bomb meant for Miss Hooper, but it presented us with an opportunity. Sherlock should be back on his feet within a day or so, but the official story is that he has suffered a devastating neurological injury. He is in the process of being transferred to a private hospital which will not be identified to protect his safety.”
“I am,” John said. Even to himself, he did not want to admit how much. Not just the rides themselves, as enjoyable as they were, but being with Sherlock: talking, laughing, swimming, racing, arguing. Sleeping. Sherlock had snuck into his room two or three times a week since the night of the storm, curling himself under John’s arm so quietly that sometimes John did not even realize he had come in until he woke the next morning, Sherlock’s soft curls tickling his cheek and filling his nose with that clean clover smell. Sherlock claimed he often had trouble sleeping and found it easier to settle down with John, which was probably true, but John suspected he also just liked it.
Lunch was pleasant, or would have been if John hadn’t been thinking of Sherlock the whole time. He was torn between worry  that Sherlock would come crashing in and throw a wobbly over Sylvie sitting too close and suspecting that he was, perhaps insensitively, beaming his I’m-in-love-and-I-just-had-the-best-blow-job-of-my-life glow a bit too obviously. Apparently Sylvie did not find any of this out of the ordinary. John walked her back to her office after, hoping to manage a casual parting. He could hardly refuse to shake her hand when she put it out, but fortunately another woman hailed her going in, so at least there was no cheek kissing.
Well...he would deal with that later. Sherlock pulled up the case notes, but it seemed the team had spent most of the day working on Austin’s family and friends back in America. Barking up the wrong tree, Sherlock thought with satisfaction. There was nothing else he could do until morning. Sleep would be impossible without a needle or a handful of pills and that was out of the question; he had to be in top form in a few hours in any case. Keep moving, he had to keep moving, stopping meant thinking and he couldn't risk that. Maybe some music. He hadn’t played in weeks, and if he played something hard and vigorous enough he might wear himself out to the point that he could catch a catnap. Best to put some plasters on first, he thought, looking ruefully at the crescents of dried blood where the ends of his nails should be.
Sherlock shook his head. “Unlikely. Even if the fetus survived an unskilled and traumatic Caesarian section, it would have taken considerable effort to keep it alive and there is no indication that our killer had any desire to do so. In the unlikely event that the infant did survive, it almost certainly died of exposure or suffocation.” The words were harsh, but his tone was gentle. “I’m sorry.”
“I don’t need a bed,” Sherlock said and he slithered down onto his knees. John could tell the move had hurt him and he was lopsided on his weak leg, but when John tried to reach for his arms Sherlock forestalled him by pulling down his trousers. Oh, shit. Sherlock clutched at John’s arse with his long fingers and moaned into his groin as though it were the most delicious thing he had ever seen, and then his mouth closed over John’s cock. Oh,
“And if the records match, you’ve got the warrant and can search the storage unit, and I’ve got Ellis sitting in my lap waiting for the handcuffs if you get the goods,” Rodriguez said. “I like it. Let’s go.”
“Then we’ll hurry.” And as she opened her mouth again: “It doesn’t matter we don’t have passes, they never look at ours anymore anyway.”
John made the most of it, insinuating his tongue between each finger and sucking Sherlock’s thumb lewdly into his mouth, taking no small satisfaction in the way Sherlock was all but humping his hip by the time he finally pulled away. They were both breathing hard now but there was no hurry in Sherlock’s movement as he reached back down and circled his fist around John’s aching cock, just a hair too tight. “God,” John gasped, and Sherlock slid his clenched grip down to the base and then back up, so slowly, so tight—it should have hurt, it should have been unbearably slow, but Sherlock twisted his wrist at the top and John’s knees wobbled. He scrabbled for Sherlock’s arm in the dark and latched onto his shoulder with one hand, half-propping himself against the wall with the other as Sherlock pumped him mercilessly, a series of quick flutters that made John’s bollocks draw up and then a long, exquisite stroke over the head. Again, again, again. John was light-headed, no longer sure if his eyes were open or closed; there were sparkles around the edges of his vision. Again and again Sherlock brought him to the edge of orgasm and then pulled him back, squeezing and slowing.
Mycroft shook his head. “He’s been taken to the hospital at the air force base and they’re evaluating him. That’s all I know.”
“Sir!” Effie said, stumbling to her feet. They had been sitting at the table, the decimated remains of the chocolate gateau and several almost-empty bottles of wine between them. “I mean Brother--I’m sorry, we must not have heard you ring, can I—“
“Seref Turan,” Samirelliev said, coming into the lounge. “Arslan, Rustam, you three on the sofa, you’re with me. Elyer, you four playing cards, Saidimir—where’s Saidimir?”
Sherlock kept his eyes modestly downcast so he wouldn’t roll them. What was with these prigs and their repeating every inane utterance?
John was frowning, still trying to work out what Sherlock was doing, when he took a step forward and leapt lightly to the low wall that ran around the edge of the roof. John’s heart surged into his throat. “Jesus, Sherlock, no,” he gasped.
The climb back up was grueling. Sherlock had gotten by most of his adult life through a combination of good genes, regular visits to the dojo, and not caring whether or what he ate, but the double tap of getting shot and then trying to destroy himself with drugs had taken a significant toll. By the time he reached the cabin Sherlock was out of breath and panting, sweat trickling down his back and legs. He shed his coat, thudded into a chair with considerably less grace than he’d have done if anyone had been watching, and took stock. He was all alone on what felt like the edge of the world, his life was in ruins, and he was woefully out of shape. This might have felt like the last straw, but to Sherlock it came as a relief: at least he had a place to start.
“Why not? As he said, it’s mostly true. Mycroft won’t, but that doesn’t matter. He’ll give Owen his seventy-two hours rather than admit he doesn’t know what I’m up to.
