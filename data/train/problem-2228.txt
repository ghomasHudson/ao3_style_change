The voice on the other end of the phone conversation answered abruptly.
"Come on, John, if we don't get to the crime scene soon, Anderson may show up and ruin everything."
"Pink case, within a five minute radius of here. Split up, we'll find it faster."
Sherlock was much involved in the tape, watching for the mysterious van when John’s mobile receiving a text drew him out of it. John was grinning at the screen as he slowly texted back.
Gossiping about minor celebrities didn’t seem like it should be part of her job, but since it was helping with the case, Sherlock wasn’t complaining.
“221,” I said.
"We're here," Sherlock reported, drawing John out of his reverie.
“We need to get to the garden,” I said, wetting my lips.
“Great, now it’s going to attack us,” said Greg.
Sherlock needed John. Of course he needed him, every moment of every day, and that was just the truth of the matter. He hadn’t been able to actually say it, not even back when he was able to speak properly.
John didn't say anything to him, but crossed over to the package on the bed. Sherlock hadn't touched it, and John tore it open.
Sherlock blushed.
A) Sherlock wakes up John with nightmares
He pressed his fingers in and rubbed firmly, and Sherlock’s vision blurred as tears of pleasure welled up in his eyes.
"I am."
“So we’re both single,” John said.
“Hello!” she said brightly.
Sherlock sighed. "So, if it's not played like the kid's game, where whoever gets to ten fingers last wins, then when does it end?"
“It’s lovely, isn’t it,” John remarked at length.
"I still don't want to help with the tree," Sherlock sighed, sinking back into the sofa.
"What is it, dear heart?" John said against their hair. "Just tell me."
"A wounded vet?" the driver asked, turning in his seat to look at John. "Him?"
But he remembered what the thrill of the fight was like, and he needed it. He knew that Len had been up to something untoward, and he also knew that Posh Bloke was investigating it.
There was no way that this was going back to normal. Normal was before Sherlock had jumped off a roof. Normal was before John got married to an assassin. Normal was before Sherlock had shot a person in the head. Normal was before John's wife had tried to kill him multiple times.
"There you are," John said, stroking Sherlock's sweat-soaked curls.
"Ugh, why did we drink so much?" John asked, putting a hand to his head.
Even so, he said, "If this is too hot, use your safeword."
“John, what are we doing?” I asked once he drew back.
“Really? Him?”
They joined the stream of disgruntled people exiting the building. Most people, upon realizing that it would probably take a while to sort out, drifted off towards the more busy streets that might have cafes to wait inside.
“Most people don’t have the British government as their overbearing big brother.”
“I have to take this. I ask you, Sherlock, for your own sanity and mine, fix it.” He grasped his umbrella and placed the mobile to his ear, turning away and leaving the morgue with the nonchalance of a practiced politician, icy to the core.
I have some ideas about showing a bit of John and Sherlock after the bonding, John and Sherlock meeting Marcus's family, and also what happens with Brandy and Julia's baby! Vote for whatever you want, but honestly I will most likely write them all and make this a series. Might even be an MPREG series. We will see!!!!
“Wh-what?”
Unformed Omega's didn't go into heat, they didn’t have children, they didn't bond, and they certainly didn't entertain romantic but erroneous notions of gender passivity, even to an apex Alpha such as the one before him.
, he wanted to say,
Unfortunately, strangers weren’t supposed to haunt your dreams, or break down the carefully constructed brick and mortar walls of your heart. The inside of John’s chest felt raw and delicately fragile, like his heart had been replaced with nothing more than a replica made of wax paper and string - easily cut and easily torn.
“We couldn’t save her;
It was probably because of this, their mutual passion and almost strangling affection for each other, that neither one of them heard the low voices outside of John’s door. Nor did they see that door open, admitting a rather scruffy Detective Inspector who started violently, throwing a hand up to his face and shielding his eyes in outright alarm.
Jimmy nodded and slumped his way out of the bungalow. John shook his head, youth these days. He wondered if his parents and other relative authority figures had ever thought the same about him when he was in his younger days. Probably not, John had always tried to be a good kid, regardless of whatever trouble his gender caused him.
Please, oh god,
John raised his eyebrows in disbelief and looked back at Sherlock.

“He was my friend,” John stepped in, nodding to the younger brother and Mr. Chandler, “he meant quite a lot to me. He was incredibly special.”

“Yes, of course.”
She glanced down, chastised, though Mycroft had not raised his voice or openly admonished her in any way.
John cleared his throat, eyes stinging in a sudden rush of emotion. Marcus looked well, he looked rested and handsome. His shaggy hair was tamed and brushed back, and he cut quite the noble figure in the suit Mycroft had specially made for him. John wanted to run a hand across his brow, like some sort of too late comfort, but instead he pulled his chin down into his chest and squeezed his eyes closed.
, only barely managing to keep the door closed. “If you want me, you have to catch me. I thought you were apex Alpha, I thought you were supposed to be
“Yes, that’s fine. Two o’clock it is then, right. Thank you Jeremy.”
He took a quick inventory of his body, and while he was terribly thirsty and physically weak, he wasn’t in a great deal of pain.
A frantic voice from off screen broke into Dr. Frankland’s narration. The camera wobbled, then was abruptly placed on its side, giving the audience a full (although sideways) view of Dr. Frankland and two other men (possibly aides) gathering around the small cot in the centre of the room.
the word was a resonant whisper, a whimper, a cry in the darkness.
it would stop. He stifled his groans, clenching his teeth and allowing only a small and somewhat pitiful whine to escape his lips. John’s eyes prickled as tears welled on their glassy surfaces – he couldn’t remember the last time he’d managed to suffer so much.
He left the rugby ball on the grass where it landed and hunched his shoulders forward, trying to appear as small as possible.  “What do you want Ed?” He couldn’t keep his voice from sounding weak, though inside his anger began to build.
His clothes hung unflatteringly on his thin frame, both highlighting and concealing his lack of regular meals. Dark rings settled in under his eyes, which glittered with fever. His hair, while still short, stuck to his skull in sweaty clumps, and his beard was so far past unkempt as to be outright laughable. He was surprised he wasn’t stopped by security, if only for the fact that he looked like hell. Honestly, the only thing that didn’t scream ‘homeless,’ was the moderately dirt-free clothing and his lack of offensive odour (courtesy of the Day Centre, once again).
“What’s not yours, Marcus?”
John’s voice was a warning, a reminder, and it came entirely too late.

“Yeah, got the idea from dogs, they did. You know, after they’d been neutered there wasn’t much left, just an empty sack,” He continued to caress the loose skin, absently rubbing John’s perineum with the meaty thumb of his left hand while he did, “Not really sure if it was just for show but…they found it certainly gave the dog something to
I might have a few epilogues for this story, but this is basically it. The culmination of almost a year's worth of sexual tension! LOL!
Sherlock slid in next to him, his movements as smooth and fluid as usual, and shut the door. Almost immediately, the Alpha pulled out his mobile and began to text as he gave the cabbie an address John was only vaguely familiar with. The cab pulled away from the kerb with a lurch and accompanying cloud of petrol exhaust as they both made their way to the crime scene.
“Why do I have to go in with him?” Sherlock managed to keep his abrupt opposition out of the question, but it was a near thing. He was never really any good at feigning nonchalance when emotions ran high.
Dr. Watson slid the flattened (but still quite rugose) pile of papers in his direction, obviously meaning for him to take a look, which he would do, in time.
“I’m here, yes,” John clasped his hands in lap, swinging one leg over the other, a picture of perfect calm and patience.
you are, they didn’t
Over time, John could say he had got used to the smell of the apex Alpha he was more than proud to call his own, but that would most definitely be a lie. To John, he still emanated excitement, exuded power and intelligence, not mention he smelt of the most decadent tobacco, purest rosin, and about a thousand other low-notes John had yet to categorize. It was simply mind boggling how sensitive his nose had become since the ‘experiment.’
John felt dazed, stilled, and for the life of him he couldn’t understand his sudden paralysis. He’d seen many men die – both under his care and out on the field – but somehow this was different. This was personal, this was up close, in his face, and he couldn’t look away.
too long after all this had begun.
John perked at the mention of Baskerville, he had actually heard of it before, and glanced over at Sherlock to see a quick flash of confusion pass across his handsome face. The Omega allowed himself a brief moment of satisfaction in knowing something the apex Alpha did not; he allowed this, because he wasn’t sure it would ever happen again.

IMA: Why don’t you take off your masks and find out?
“Sherlock…”
“Sir, yes Sir.” He answered with a sigh, unable to school his face into impassivity any longer. Let the man see what he wanted, John thought his behavior this morning made it perfectly clear; he had nothing to hide.
been properly seen by a healthcare provider, and he tried very hard to comply and not feel like a performing monkey. He breathed when asked, lifted his shoulders (the left not being able to go up near as far as the right), lifted his arms…he laid on his back while Wilkes auscultated, palpated, and percussed.  The doctor took his vital signs: temperature, blood pressure, respirations, and pulse.
“What? John!”
He decided not to take the piss after all.
I was a bit late with that last chappie, so here is a new one for you, early!
“Capsule, of course, simple…easy. Plant cellulose, carrageenan, gelatine…animal proteins,” his eyes focused on the pill with a laser like intensity, mouth and brain moving in tandem, facts spilling forth with uncanny ease and alacrity. He leant his head forward and gently licked the side of the capsule, much to John’s vocalized dismay, “Definitely gelatine and carrageenan based. Orange colouring…Orange B, turmeric, Yellow number 6, oleoresin, saffron, paprika, Citrus Red…look here, the stamp on the side of the pill John, WMM 50, what do you think it means?”
distinctive.”
And John did, he breathed in to five counts, and then exhaled to the same. In this moment he felt so
“You gave me an awful fright you did, Sherlock! Is it alright if I call you Sherlock? Sometimes your types tend to be so stuffy and downright constipated. My last charge, oh he was a –”
– John!” Harry tugged at his Captain’s Kevlar vest, twisting and pulling on the protective gear, much like a young child tugs on their mum or dad when desperately trying to get their way.
Now, he used his limited funds for other things, and wasn’t quite as able to hide his Omega latency like he wanted. He knew most of the others already knew, their little group was a sort of family that inhabited a certain section of the city, and it wasn’t easy to hide secrets from your family. They weren’t quite a gang, just a gathering of about 20 individuals with similar life issues that helped each other out. Most of John’s pension went to food and hostels for some of the younger women and men. John didn’t mind sleeping rough if he could help others avoid the true hardships of homelessness.  You could find every variation of the spectrum harboring their ills under that god-forsaken bridge, and each had their own sad stories. John found solace in doing what he could. It was the only thing he found peace in nowadays; that stilled his fractious soul. This had the rather unfortunate effect of garnering John a reputation as the Good Doctor (he didn’t mind, though it did make him slightly uncomfortable), as not only did he help others monetarily, he did so medically as well.
After a long considering moment, in which John stared wordlessly at the two women, Julia finally relented and pulled the other into a tight (as possible with the large belly between them) hug.
The tower, the drugs, Mycroft, the Cottage, the procedure, a guide – that was it, that was the answer to all this.
“Your room is on the fifth floor,” she continued, moving towards the lift she had only just mentioned. It was a standard metal affair, painted another neutral colour with another no-doubt ridiculous name (weathered fossil, perhaps?). She pressed the button with one perfectly buffed fingernail glinting in the low light.
“Mycroft,” John muttered with vitriol. It was just his luck that the tall, stuffy man would show up here just before he and his brother were set to meet. Probably to interfere, or maybe tell John he wasn’t good enough? He needn’t bother; the Omega already knew he wasn’t good enough.
Sherlock paused, his frenetic energy fizzling out almost as soon as it had begun. “Very well then, Dr. Watson, I await your company in the sitting room when you are finished. We have much to discuss.” With that, he inclined his head rather formally and moved down the hallway at a steady pace, finally disappearing through a door adjoining the kitchen.
“I – when I was having my…physical, well, after I had my physical, there was a young woman who came in to take samples of my blood. She asked if I wanted the flu jab.” John laughed without humour, passing his hand over his eyes before settling it back against the cool metal surface behind him, “I thought sure, why not? After all I’ve nowhere to go. We’re a high risk population, the homeless, couldn’t hurt, could it?”
“Who are you? What is your name?”
to know what made this procedure so unique.
John sat, hunched over his desk, rapidly flipping between several fat manila folders. Some were older, worn, with soft edges and faded names stamped on the side. One was very new and labelled ‘Sherlock Holmes.’ He’d already been through his most recent patient’s file a dozen times, but he had to be sure. He had to triple-check every test and step, every decision made.
, don't stop,
“Yes,” she set her plate down a little too loudly, a wrinkle of concern appearing between her brows, “I pulled you out myself. I know what I saw.”
The other man sighed, eyes boring up and into the ceiling. He squeezed their clasped hands and cleared his throat, looking hesitant.
This wasn’t exactly what John was expecting, “Yes, yes I have...enough for a lifetime, far too much.”
Disclaimer: Not mine, no money, just playing, etc.
“Naw, I jus’ go in twice a week for physical, they take summa me blood, and das’ it. Been doin’ it now for a littl’ ovah two monfs. But I’m startin’ t’ not feel so good.” He raised a bony hand to his abdomen, face drawn tight.
IMA: No, no. I mean, no thank you. I will tell you what you need to know.
“Fantastic! Will she make tea and do the cleaning up as well?”
“Excellent. I’m Dr. Sebastian Wilkes, I’ll be assessing your health, administering your physical and drawing your blood work, alright?” He moved over to a small bin and pulled out a few large, clear plastic bags. He placed them on the bed, then pulled out an unattractive hospital gown from a large overhead cupboard. This he placed on the bed as well.
The Omega backed away, the street was narrow and unkempt, and not exactly the ideal place for trying to hide.
The blond furrowed his brow, more than little confused. Did he seriously just question John’s devotion to resolving the murders?
(See the end of the chapter for
“John, please,” Sherlock addressed the Omega by his given name, trying to placate the man, his Alpha pheromones drifting through the flat like the most aromatic bouquet John had ever scented. “We’ve identified who we think is responsible, and if we’re careful it would require very little effort on your part.”
that John felt urgently against his left hip.
(See the end of the chapter for
He was in so much trouble.
“Yeah,” John laughed softly, flexing his bad leg and only barely managing not to wince at the ache it produced. “Of course you’re my best friend.”
Sherlock kept his back to the Omega, purposefully refusing to acknowledge the man was even still in the room. The tension was perceptible in his rigid lines of muscles in his back, and he inhaled in long, drawn out huffs.
“Sherlock,” John offered quietly, voice neutral and non-threatening, as if he was dealing with a very unstable animal, “what you’re saying, it can’t be true. You can’t just make up a new kind of human. That kind of technology doesn’t really exist, does it? I mean, that’s the kind of stuff you read about in those crazy tabloids that talk about the Bat-Child and three thousand year old mummies coming back to life. It can’t possibly be true.” He looked to Molly, who nodded her head in agreement, wispy trails of loosened hair floating about her ears.
I promise one chappie full of mad sexytimes next because, well, that is all that is left of this story. LOL!!
The roiling sensation in his mid-section continued, giving no indication as to when it would stop,
He twisted his arms, testing his bonds again, every movement initiating a pounding in his head that left him both exhausted and nauseous at once. The bindings held true.
“I fucking meant it, you wanker!”
He trudged down the stairs with a heavy head, one hand on the railing, and the other clutching the tightly knitted nylon strap of his bag. He counted the stairs one by one, keeping focus on the here and now, instead of lingering uselessly on what might have been.
“In my tea?” He took another sip, a larger one this time, since the liquid had cooled sufficiently. John decided it really did taste quite good, and it had been dog’s years since he’d had a decent cup of tea.
The proper denouement.
For a moment he fumbled with the simple metal button at the top of John’s fly. Above him, John chuckled momentarily, but that only urged the Alpha further, for the Omega was not supposed to laugh when his mate was to give him pleasure, but only
“C’mon boys, you’ve played around long enough,” he took one last drag of his cigarette and flicked it out into the street, it hissed as it landed into a puddle, “get it over with.”
“No luck?” prompted the Omega, who, after at least thirty minutes in the flat, was really beginning to crave a bit of tea, and a comfortable place to rest his hip.
Sherlock closed his eyes in a desperate bid for patience. Why,
- the burns were another issue altogether. His legs and lower torso smouldered and stank like charred pork tainted with melted plastic.
But like before, strangely, Jim was absent.
didn’t need this right now. His stiff-backed reserve was wearing thin, and truth be told, he wasn’t entirely sure if he had the strength of will to completely resist the apex Alpha.
Murray, to his credit, was a noiseless shadow behind him, following his lead and exuding a quiet confidence that reminded Sherlock of his own oft-underestimated Omega.
Four familiar percussive blasts shot through the night air, leaving John’s ears ringing.
…” Sherlock growled, the sound coming in low and laborious, rippling through his thorax to settle deep within his bones.
“Yes, I can see that.” John offered with barely concealed humour. He lifted his dark blue eyes to the paper, reading each line before lowering the paper down onto the polished side-table to his right. “Explain please.”
! Not to mention the man who will
She faltered, unsure, “why? What could you possibly say after that?”

than this.
Behind him, Marcus blinked silently, taking in the small living area. John limped a few paces further in and scratched at his beard, then ran a hand through his greasy hair. It was grown out entirely too long and curled about his neck and ears in a most unfetching way.
“Right,” Lestrade whispered with authority, wiping his face against the mist in the air, “you two are purely here for John. Our other teams have circled round back, ready to move in at Mycroft’s command. It’s their job to do the dirty work. You two are
“John, that first time I met you, I mentioned you had a background in the Army. You seemed surprised.”
SEASON FOUR IN THREE DAYS WOOHOOOOO!!!!
“Seems alright, it’ll do for now, at least. What do you think?” He regarded Marcus with a questioning look, but the larger man only shrugged. He wasn’t much for words, was Marcus. John had known him for exactly one month and the man had taken quite a shining to the good doctor.  He was by his side most days now, and John found that he really didn’t mind the company.
The mousy Omega tucked one wayward lock of hair behind her ear nervously, “Well, I took the liberty of running some specialised blood tests, and the answers were positive for certain tumour markers, Sherlock, specifically HCG. It’s quite possible he had some kind of cancer - most likely ovarian, or something of that nature.”
“I said so, didn’t I?” John laughed quietly.
POLICE: Need I remind you that you are in our custody, and as such must answer all questions truthfully until such time as a solicitor is required.
There was so much information I wanted to include in this chappie, but I think I cut it off at a good point. The next chappie will have lots of stuff going on as well. SO EXCITED!!!
Dimly, he was aware that the man was speaking to him, but at that point his vision began to fade. It left him slowly, clouding over the back of his mind in a kind of osmotic process, leaving only a refreshing darkness that envelopied the small Omega in a blanket of painless unconsciousness.
So I am so sorry this chapter took so long! I simply agonized over the first scene until I felt it was right. I hope you all like it as it is my first foray into actual smut. Props to all of you who do this on a regular basis, because it was difficult for me. Hopefully, it will become easier as time goes on, because I plan on lots more smut before this story is done.
John himself either didn’t notice, or didn’t care, wrapped up in his own misery as he was. The man groaned and grumbled from his room, only venturing down for lukewarm tea and biscuits, as if that’s all his stomach could handle, then shuffling back up the stairs without so much as a kiss or simple ‘hello.’
The culmination of everything.
But that took a backseat to the breath-stealing realization that not only could he not help Patterson, now he could not even help
think that I can’t take care of myself!”
"So you're threatening me now?"
“Dr. Watson, as a man of considerable means, there are a great many things I could do to reward you and your little retreat for a job well done. It is not my intention to bury the past, as it were, but suffice it to say that if you succeed with my brother, I will make it my personal mission to destroy any and all records involving one James Moriarty.”
“So you’ve started a blog after all?” She raised an eyebrow, the pen moving in long swoops upon the page – scratching.
To be honest, he hadn’t truly known why he offered "fix it for her" – magnanimity was not a trait he actively cultivated. Rather, he eschewed all flavours of sentiment and tended towards cold, hard reason above all else.
you see, just the two of us together, forever…and ever, and ever, and ever.” It was sing-song, it felt like madness. “But no.”
His blood suddenly ran cold, his heart dropped dead into his stomach and he blanched noticeably. The young woman standing by the tape turned her weary gaze towards the blond and furrowed her brow in confusion.
This afforded John a perfect and uninterrupted view of Sherlock’s fine arse as the muscles extended and flexed repeatedly in those dangerously tailored trousers. John shut the door just shy of a proper slam. This was going to kill him.
With a sigh born of someone who’s prepared for the worst, he swept up his phone and left the exam room. The Omega counted the doors till he found the correct one (why was nothing ever labelled in this place?), and knocked softly.
“What is this?” The ginger woman asked, flipping the card over once, and then back again, “who is Mike Stamford?”
But by then, the atmosphere changed in the flat had changed completely.

“What…where am I?” His voice was weak and dry, he hated to sound cliché, but really, it was the most pressing thing on his mind right now. Well, that and how the
With great effort, he managed to trudge up the stairs, the simple act of putting one foot in front of the other taking much more energy than it did earlier this afternoon. He had to stop halfway, swiping a hand across his brow and clenching a fist in his soiled coat…damn, it was even getting hard to breathe.
made it; I texted you ages ago!”
“Mr. Holmes, I need you to – to follow me right now please.”
A warm, strong hand on his arm halted his steps.
Sherlock angled his head, following Jim’s moving silhouette with caution and wariness tingling at the tips of fingers, “No?”
He left it at that, letting the weighty silence speak for itself, and after a few long moments, Anthea finally cleared her throat.
No. In fact he did not need a slobbering Omega at his side, the only person he needed was
Gloved or not, the man’s finger felt rough and intrusive. The pressure increased by volumes as the man hubbed his third knuckle against John’s body, giving his now completely enveloped finger a little wiggle, as if testing the clench of the Omega’s internal muscles. The movement was crude and profane, and John couldn’t help the tension of his muscles as his body quite literally flinched halfway off the table.
The moment his trembling hands went for his belt buckle, John knew he had him.
John looked down into his lap again and inhaled deeply. The scent of wood smoke and pipe tobacco filtered in from somewhere, probably the slit under the door, and continued to muddle his brain. If he couldn’t get a breath of fresh air, he’d have to do more than try to will his erection away…he’d have to take matters into his own hands, literally. And that was certainly not something he wanted to do with the scent of Sherlock Holmes thick in his nostrils.
“Phone me if you find anything.”
, if one was feeling quite maudlin. If Sherlock extended too far, John washed over his mind with calmness, security, and strength.
“These files, they were…informative.” John sat back down in his chair, exhausted and emotionally spent. He had taken hours to fully read the files, to fully understand the impact the experiment would have on his life. “Do you think it’s true?”

“Alright then, how about this one? What the
John Watson was a man who brought nothing to his office save an oft-stained RAMC coffee mug and a pile of medical journals stacked (not too high) on the corner of his empty desk. Sherlock Holmes, however, lived and worked with his life thrown about him in a messy uproar of belongings and experiments. It appeared these men were exact opposites, and possibly, perfect complements. It was no wonder they were so compatible, even at the genetic level.
It was a few minutes before he could pull himself together, and Sherlock’s face dissolved into a worried scowl (it was quite charming to John, he looked almost like a little boy who fretted over the state of a broken toy).
He wasn’t a
“You know, I’ve heard about people like you. Those who think they’re too good for the Tower. People who think they don’t need the teachings, that they can survive on their own and not be a burden or a threat to everyone else. People like you are always wrong.”
He didn’t know much about him, this Sherlock Holmes (ridiculous name, that), but he was supposed to be exceptional.
A sharp knock at the door interrupted John’s self-disparaging reverie; and he thrust his hand quickly towards the first towel he could see, wrapping it around his entire body like a robe. He didn’t want

The man grazed a hand over the breast of his scandalously tight aubergine dress shirt, sighing yet again. Then after a moment he clapped his palms together, twirled one on foot and dove towards the other end of the room, rummaging through a large woolen coat draped carelessly across the back of a hideously upholstered Edwardian chair.

Irene stood next to him, smaller, but only in stature. Her tenacious eyes noticed the way the man leant against the glass, how his breath condensed at the surface, at once obscuring the object of his desire and his own greedy reflection.
“Mr. Holmes, just try to fax in the information as soon as possible. I’ll phone you if anything changes.”
…it was maddening, vexatious,
He rounded the corner, blinking his tired eyes a few times, following the glow from the streetlamps into another small room whose windows faced the street. He had chosen this space as his own not long after they moved in. Sarah’s room was across the hall, and Raz crashed downstairs when the he found himself needing a safe place for the night.
Neither of them knew where Sherlock had disappeared to. If one wanted to describe the current atmosphere in 221B, there probably wouldn’t be a better phrase than ‘tense beyond all heretofore imaginings.’ Sherlock had absconded to parts unknown almost immediately after the row with his brother, and had not contacted them since. It wasn’t completely out of character, so neither men was especially worried as of yet. Still, he hadn’t quite been in his right mind when he flew down the stairs, hurled the front door open and took off down the street, uncomprehending of the chaos he was leaving behind.
Oh I am terrible. This is late, of course, because I have been ridiculously tired! It's alright though, I am trudging bravely through my ficcie, and I see an end in sight!!! Huzzah!!
It exploded in a spray of blood, sprinkling John’s hand and forearms in fine, carmine droplets as the man screeched and made to bring both hands to his face. While he was still startled into inactivity, John darted in front of him and grabbed his cheap black tie, pulling it roughly down and towards him. The man flew forward with another startled cry, and John cocked his knee upwards, ramming the man’s temple into the dull, blunt surface of patella. John grunted in satisfaction as he heard a distinctive
than bad because it wasn’t immediately clear what set off the alarm – and now the entire warehouse was alerted and their window for getting John out of that hellhole had just shortened dramatically. He shoved the first policeman that dared to get in his way away with a dangerous growl and barrelled forward, a singular purpose in mind.
“Alright, I’ve got all I need for now, when can you come in?”
“Yes.”
Then the inevitable blast of air, the super-heated wave of pressure that crashed against John's own vehicle shattered the safety glass and ripped a shocked scream out of Hopkins. Spittle flew from his mouth as he gripped the steering wheel, white knuckled and wide-eyed as it became clear he was losing control of their transport.
” Sherlock looked around him, taking in his surroundings for the umpteenth time that evening. Surely, his manner screamed, John didn’t mean to stay
But then a wave of true, blessed calm washed over his mind. It was singular, different, an erratic energy that suffused his body and brought him to real, final purpose.
He sat up stiffly, letting the sleepless night work itself out of his shoulder. With the flexing of his abdomen, an accompanying twinge of pain awoke fiercely in his right hip.  He winced, and sucked in a breath through his teeth before he could help himself. The long-embedded shrapnel made itself known early today, probably because all of the extra weight it bore throughout the night. Some days were better than others, and he supposed today wouldn’t be one of them.
“How many times have you failed?” Sherlock leaned in, eager, and filing away everything she mentioned for further study later.
Any kudos, bookmarks, and comments are fabulous!
John heard this exchange as though he were floating under water. Their speech was muffled and distorted, and when he pulled his hand away from his temple it felt slippery and sticky. He licked his cracked lips and tasted blood. Jesus Christ that man had a fist like a wrecking ball.
“Too much of a what now?” John queried, smiling with no sense of joy behind the expression, “were you going to say liability?” Anger spiked his tone. He may have made a mistake, but he wasn’t going to crawl and hide away to (possibly) seize and die in a corner.
to share any more of his personal information with the Beta than he had to. It was bad enough he had to fill out those forms, god knows who would have their grimy paws on his medical history now.
“Doesn’t matter, I’m in it all the way now, yeah? Have to see this through…I made a promise, after all,” the Omega jammed his tightly clenched fists into the pockets of his sullied coat, steeling his reserve once more, “besides I…I don’t know what’s wrong with me or what will happen. I’m hoping they have the answers, otherwise…” John looked away at that, managing a noncommittal shrug. Although they both knew it was an act.
,” This time Sherlock did look away from his experiment, his laser-like gaze cementing the Omega to his seat, answering almost immediately and practically speaking over John in his haste, “But no, no
“Yeah alright, bloody hell…”
…everywhere. He began to sweat, and he was sure the considerable thumping of his heart against his sternum could be heard by the entirety of London proper. John’s hand gripped the paper, each small fist wrinkling the newsprint in their grasp as he screamed in abject vexation and suddenly threw the paper down towards the fireplace. The very edge of the paper caught fire almost instantly, the flame licking and curling at the edges in seconds, leaving dark and delicate whorls of soot and carbon remains that stained the well-worn rug at the hearth.
Mycroft and Sherlock remained silent, both taking in the events of the recording.
What was he thinking? What was he
“If you don’t mind…I’d very much like to forego all appearances, now that we are alone. What designs do you have on my brother…and no, don’t pretend like you don’t know what I’m talking about. You know who I am, don’t lie, it
John sighed, rubbing a hand over his left temple, “Not sure yet. I just, need some time alone. I’ll be back in a few days, yeah, hopefully. Tell Marcus and Sarah for me, would you?”
But first, he had to do this one last thing. Just this one more thing, and then maybe...
“I know it was you.”
“I want to be near you, always. I want you by my side…I…thought you’d want that too.” The uncertainty in his voice was heart-breaking. It was strange how quickly Sherlock could go from a ridiculously self-possessed and dominating Alpha, to insecure and practically begging for John’s good graces. It was charming, frighteningly so. John would never in a million years think he could affect a man like this in such a way.
“Huh…” Lestrade ran a hand through his salt and pepper hair, “something about fertility and dead bodies?” He offered lamely; it was clear he didn’t remember.
Thank you to everyone who has followed and commented and kudosed and bookmarked, you are angels.
(also called the ‘treatment’) really was as effective as the brochure claimed. Sherlock, with his highly scientific and curious mind couldn’t puzzle out exactly how one small implant was supposed to somehow lessen, if not erase, his sensory difficulties completely.
The outlook was not good. It seemed Private Patterson's body was relatively intact, but the
He shivered, though he kept his room quite temperate, and pushed all thoughts of
- before the door was kicked open with enough force to rattle the walls and knock a ten centimetre hole in the plaster just underneath the Periodic table hung next to the window.
The explosive, rage-filled screech echoed off the tiles, bouncing back and forth until Sherlock succumbed to the urge to cover his ears. It became louder, and louder, and –
“Just give me a minute; I need to go get someone.” He left Marcus with Sherlock, who regarded the other Alpha with blatant mistrust and barely concealed hostility. John hoped he wasn’t making a mistake by leaving the two alone together, but he assumed two fully grown men could behave themselves for a few moments, even if one was challenged. He supposed he would find out when he returned.
He wanted to close his eyes, God, he
With a sigh, he stood, gripping the folder and already envisioning how they’d approach the altered treatment, what equipment they’d need, and what a fool he was to offer himself up again, like a lamb to slaughter.
Mycroft raised a fine eyebrow, silently urging him on.
The Omega sighed, irritated and feeling overwhelmingly vulnerable. “Not helping, Sherlock.”
. He stifled that thought the moment it floated to the surface, now was not the time for distraction, now was not the time for
Mycroft had given him an ultimatum, in the end: go to rehab, or be collected by the Tower and cut off completely. The inherent threat in this very statement gave Sherlock pause, because he’d only just recently avoided an unexpected summons from the Sentinel Prime himself, Horace Wiggington. He was a fat, squat little man that Sherlock tried to avoid at all costs. He smelt of sweat and stale coffee, so much so that Sherlock could taste the salty perspiration at the base of his throat before he even entered his office.
Mycroft Holmes sat across from his younger brother, one leg swung casually over another, the bottom of his trousers lifting ever so slightly to reveal the argyle pattern of his dress socks. Beside him, his ubiquitous umbrella rested upright against the plush, brocade arm of the chair. He rolled his eyes, gathering his hands in his lap before responding in an icy tone.
It was less of an assault than it was before the implant, and even still it was less of an overload than merely the day before. Sherlock could smell the smoke from the petrol lawnmower over the lawns near the side of the building seeping in through his window; he could smell the newly shorn grass and the washing powder used to clean his trousers. Cleenzyme vapours wafted upwards from the carpet, lemon-scented, burning the nostrils and mixing with some brand of glass cleaner (something industrial, Novaclear possibly). Housekeeping tidied his room daily, when he couldn't scare them away, and though these scents were meant to be gentle and forgiving to most Sentinels, they were bright as fairy lights in Sherlock's mind...and steadily growing brighter.
It was the measure of a thousand heartbeats, or one long in-drawn breath - maybe two - that set John's blood aflame and pricked the surface of his like the hot, dry winds of the Afghan desert. He leant against the wall, mind reeling, and felt the warmth of Sherlock's hands collect around the tender areas of his neck. Time slowed, stretching the sensations on an infinite scale.
"Gustav?! It's Gr – you know what, I don't even know why I bother. Molly, would you like another drink?" He moved away from the chair to engage the lovely pathologist, who was smiling sublime and pretty on the couch (if one went for that sort of thing).
“Anyway, I answered his questions as best I could. I mean, honestly, I felt like I was being railroaded. He had these eyes…this voice. He said that all the pictures of the dead men were latent Omegas and homeless and if I knew any of them. I told him no, I didn’t recognize any of the men in the pictures, but really I mean who could? They were just awful…the pictures. Anyway, he asked if I knew of any latent Omegas and I…well I-might have given him your name-”
She tensed her perfectly lined lips, coloured blood red, and noticed Sebastian was trembling. The paper in his hand shook, ever so slightly, until he gently pressed it down on the desk in front of her.
Sherlock paused for a moment, lifting his chin and swinging his unnerving gaze towards John. He narrowed his eyes, searching the Omega’s face before taking a few steps closer to the armchair.
John wasn’t buying it for a second. If she was just pawn, an innocent, why the hell was she shredding documents? It didn’t make sense, and John needed answers, and he was
He glanced outside the window that faced the street, taking in the dim glow of the sodium lights as they reflected off the misty clouds of rain that floated in the air like dust motes. It was dark now, and with a glance at his mobile, John noticed it was 6:30pm – just before he had set his alarm.
He should have seen this coming. He really should have. He should never have let him go to that blasted study alone, just like he should have never,
“My phone,” John blurted out suddenly, putting his hand inside his trousers and pulling out the iPhone Sherlock had gifted him, “you can already record my conversations, can’t you record everything else too?” He tried not to sound resentful, truly, but it might have snuck out just a little. The statement did have an undercurrent of bitterness Mycroft was almost certain to pick up on.
There it was. That man: early thirties, long time sun-bather judging by the premature age lines around his mouth and eyes, cares too much about his appearance, but poor.
Sherlock had almost lost count of how many corridors he’d run through, of how many dead ends he’d suffered in pursuit of his quarry.
Sherlock ran a frantic hand through his curls, gripping and pulling the wayward strands with a frustrated energy. He didn’t seem to realize his sable locks already stood out in dramatic disarray; and Molly mused whether he was purposefully doing an historically accurate Einstein impersonation, or had quite inadvertently electrocuted himself sometime within the last fifteen minutes.
“It was just an idea until I met him, until he got investors involved, pushed paperwork through the Tower, and everything went from there...at light-speed, seems like. I didn’t know then that he was an extremely powerful Sentinel. He hid it quite well, really, his control was unbelievable, and since my Guide abilities had gone tits up I bet it was easy. It wasn’t until later he mentioned he was looking to utilize the treatment himself and volunteered to be the very first test subject.”
“Yes?” He pulled his head off of the mediocre pillow, hair already askew.
, and he knew this pain. He knew this pain like he knew how hard he clenched his hand when he tried not to give in to his anger, or like he knew the number of freckles on his sister’s face.
…he felt on constant high alert, though he couldn’t for the life of him recognize any of the usual signs of danger that would normally trigger such an intense fight or flight sensation.
“Look here you, you’re paying us to watch one scrawny little Omega, how hard could it possibly be to -”
When he again chose to spoke, his voice was small.
He chose the latter.
of his mouth, the perfect
John coughed, but tried to stay still, only pumping his right hand to assist in engorging his veins. The blond wasn’t about to tell the young woman that it was more than just a ‘bit of aches and pains.’
He sighed, letting his breath come out in a low groan until it evolved into a roar of complete frustration and misery.
He took his own seat now, across from his invisible guide who drank his own coffee, well,
Really, well this just bordered on ridiculous. Honestly! Who comes to an expensive and very exclusive retreat and immediately sets about throwing their lovely things all over the floor?
Tears stung at his eyes, his chest tightening in an overwhelming wave of life and unstoppable consequence washing over him. What was to become of him now? Or, more important than that,
am surprised at your insights sometimes.”
The doors to the lab opened just then, emitting a loud squeak as Detective Inspector Lestrade (appearing exhausted and ruggedly handsome as always) made his entrance. He was dishevelled, as he was wont to be; and looked to be on the wrong side of about five strong cups of coffee, and then some.
Oh Jesus almighty, did he
Her reddened eyes took on a feverish glint, so near to maddening that John took a step back and raised his gun once more.
“You know I think that’s ridiculous, but whatever.” Brandy opened her mouth to reply, only to have Julia cut her off with a quick swipe of her hand.
Alright, he couldn’t just stand by and do nothing after receiving information that could be vital to an ongoing murder investigation, even if that meant he had to spend more time with the apex Alpha that featured in his most explicit daydreams (and night dreams, for that matter).
“Have you reconsidered the blog?” Now the pen moved in one graceful arc down towards the lined paper pad on her lap. “I honestly believe it will help you.”

John didn’t speak for several heartbeats.
He averted his eyes, the lushly carpeted floor becoming incredibly interesting now, for John stared at it so severely he thought for sure the strength of his gaze would cause it to smoulder and burst into flames. He almost never talked about his family - and he
John sat up, brow furrowed in concern.
The only thing he could do now, the only thing that could really help his Omega (his?), was the cool deductive reasoning he had become to rely on so thoroughly throughout his lifetime. He owed him that, at least, and if he was found alive (
One lone cigarette butt, isolated in a small but deep puddle just to the left of the middle of the street, floated on still water.
That they would solve this case, he was certain. He had spent enough time in the man’s presence to know that even the most brilliant and clever of criminals didn’t stand a chance to the scintillating intelligence that was Sherlock Holmes. The Omega both blessed and cursed the day he met the apex Alpha and wondered if this, probably ill-advised, foray into crime-solving would pan out. It would either be the making of him, or make him worse than ever (though he wasn’t sure how that was possible). How did one get worse than what he was now?
“I-I think I made a mistake,” was all John could muster, voice small and tight, “I think…I think I’ve already been dosed with the drug.”
He made to speak, no doubt to spout a scathing reply to his brother’s unprovoked little speech, when Mycroft’s mobile chimed in his trouser pocket. With a raised right hand (held up specifically to prevent Sherlock from talking), he pulled the mobile out with his left and glanced at the screen.
cruel, but nothing would come of it. Just another reason why there was so much pressure on Omegas to be fertile and reproduce, and another reason why Unformed latent Omegas were so stigmatized. All this nonsense about starting a family, going through Formation, finally giving his due to society just about did his head in as a child, and threatened to do just the same as an adult. Those ridiculous gender studies classes in secondary school were partly to blame for his apathetic and frankly avoidant attitude towards his half-gender.
And it did, for a little while.
Dr. Watson inhaled, as if readying himself for quite a lecture, then, thinking better of it, pointed to the papers. “I won’t bore you with specifics, but as you can see, there are six distinct Sentinel genes on Chromosome 13. Chromosome 12 has several more as well, but you need only have one gene activated to develop Sentinel abilities. However, the more activated genes, the stronger the senses. Your brother has the most activated Sentinel genes on both Chromosomes I’ve ever seen without serious consequences.”
The first floor was less of an assault on his senses. The horrid rose-scented miasma that greeted him as he entered the building tapered off into a more neutral, almost dusty smell. It wasn’t unpleasant, like mould or old, unused things, but more like the loamy scent of the outdoors. It was natural, like fresh dirt or wet sand.
“Yes – yes, I hope to, but – I, I’m sorry, to the both of you. This really isn’t by choice.”
…there was movement near the flaming vehicle ahead. Someone was in there - someone who was still
we spend out here, John continues to remain in danger. Is this nothing to you?” Sherlock spat, turning round again slowly.
The Alpha bellowed, his hand spasming and releasing the gun, while John smiled in dark amusement as he heard the low
, sort of.
Hmmm…there might be a better word for it somewhere – chair – perhaps? His current lack of grasp on the English language was
He limped his way over, making note of the layout. Two more doors opened outwards on either side of the makeshift desk, possibly leading to further hallways and then god knows where. John wasn’t entirely sure of the layout of this building, so, he didn’t really know how large this new suite actually was.
. Now, he knew what was happening. John had been gone for many hours, reappeared, and now no longer smelled like himself. In fact, John now smelled like an Alpha…and an
“What do you mean? These types of Omegas?” John cocked his head, his hyper-vigilance faltering in his curiosity.
“Yes, Mrs. Hudson, thank you,
The hand now travelled slowly down John’s short and too slender body, only stopping to swipe along his inner thigh, gathering a more considerable amount of lubrication. John looked towards where he last felt the hand (but of course he saw nothing), and a painful tightness began in his throat while tears welled in his eyes.  Then he felt it…a large, generous, warm hand enclosed his cock, giving it a light tug and then squeezing the aching organ in an almost painful manner.
He wrenched his gaze away from the glass, though it seemed to pain him in doing so, and favoured the woman with an accusing eye.
“…you think you’re safe now, huh, Watson? That was just for starters. Next time you won’t be so lucky…”
It would be so easy…so, so easy to just give in now…but there was one more thing he needed to know before he could succumb to his heat entirely.
A snuffling sound caught his attention, and he looked over to his right side, seeing Marcus crouched by his bedside. The man was sitting silently but looked alert; it was possible he hadn’t slept at all during the night. The Omega was touched, as always, that the larger man thought him so important as to watch over him all night. Not for the first time, John wondered how he had ever missed the signs that Marcus loved him. They were all there, of course, but he supposed he had either ignored or flat out dismissed the man’s obvious regard for him.
In any case, I hope you enjoy a bit of crime-solving and deductions. I do my best! Please note any typos, inconsistencies, or brit-picking issues for me. I miss these things sometimes. Any critique is also welcome, just be nice.
This thought was, unsurprisingly, punctuated by the low click of his heels against creamy, alabaster tiles. Maybe he wasn’t wrong about the sliding door after all – it seemed he had a visitor.
couldn’t save her, my own little girl.”
The thought gave him little comfort, and he placed the note on top of her bedroll, folded in half with her name hastily scribbled on top and the card tucked neatly inside.
“We all thought so, at first. Jim healed well. We had already agreed I would be the donor since we were a match, and it seemed we had achieved the impossible. But...I’ve found in life that the good times rarely last.”
John looked around the room, nonplussed. The table in the centre (probably 30 years old), was passably clean, except for one green glass ashtray that housed more than a few cigarette butts (which was amusing because smoking indoors was banned ages ago).
Sherlock exploded into awareness, heart thumping and gasping for breath. The monitor alarms buzzed shrilly around his head as an army of medical staffed appeared by his bedside.
” The Omega blubbered, thinking he
The voice coalesced far beyond him, settling somewhere near the blinking gems of Way Out signs and heavy, fire escape doors.
No. He couldn’t allow those thoughts to interfere with his work. The most important thing to focus on right now was Sherlock Holmes receiving the best and most effective treatment available for his significant talents - even if it meant running the risk of John losing himself all over again.
His tone veritably crackled through the line, and John felt the fine hairs on his forearm rise to attention. Then suddenly – he could see him, James (Jim), sat in the same chair he now held in a death-grip, peering up him. John’s attention was fixated, Jim’s brown eyes trusting and full of the ignorant gleam of youth.
you call an office, not when I’ve a perfectly good bedroom you can use here.”
He was, in fact, everything John was not – and this is why the blond chose to bend to his will. That, and his rather intense crush (he refused to call it love, though he knew it to be true) that refused to lessen no matter what the infuriating man did.
Sherlock had long since stopped his pacing and turned away from the Omega, choosing instead to stare out of the far window by the cluttered desk. John watched, worried, as the taller man kept his hands clasped tightly behind his back and looked dispassionately out into London, onto its wet streets and hapless citizens. He absorbed the Alpha’s beautiful profile, strong and Grecian as it was, his pale skin reflecting the streetlamps as if he were a ghostly visage out of some Dickensian tale.
John’s scent was strong, a little
POLICE: Calm down Irene, please remember you are in custody.
He pulled at the plastic contraption stuck to his face, and only then realized he face felt – odd.  He couldn’t quite pinpoint the sensation but, his face felt padded and full.
Murray moved forward to contain Irene Adler, who was screaming and inconsolable in her terror. Sherlock thought he heard words, maybe some pleading dripping from her duplicitous lips, but he paid her no attention. She was nothing to him.
John was familiar with the ALS guidelines and their stance on drug administration during cardiac arrest, but he held to his Army training, and while Margie might have given him a bit of leery side-eye, she did as she was told.
, joining the group of officers gathered at the double doored entrance on the south side of the warehouse.
“Um, okay,” she squeaked in that infuriatingly mousy way of hers, “only I’ve just finished the post-mortem on Jimmy Price’s body and…I think there’s something you need to see. There’s some unusual lab results and I think –”
Well, he supposed that made sense. Considering this place was costing Mycroft an obscene amount of money, he wouldn’t put it past them to want to impress.
John gets in a little over his head and he meets a certain detective. Will sparks fly?
“Greg? No. Sorry don’t know him, but he sounds terribly dull,” the Alpha stalked towards the DI, putting his right hand out in front, expecting the other man to pass over the evidence as requested.
,” at this point, he began to pace, gesturing a bit wildly and seeming to forget John was part of the exchange entirely. “Now…china clay is an organic compound, easy enough…you already know, and as organic compounds do, they disintegrate at specific rates of decay. Taking into account the acidity and relative moisture in the air and surrounding environment, plus the staining by the coffee ring in the upper left hand corner, I can deduce that he had been a participant of the study for at least 3 months before meeting his untimely demise.”
His jaw dropped, lips parting as he stared into her eyes, swirling and blue like liquid pools of sea-glass, “J-John is fine – Irene is fine.”
You shut up now,” he levelled the gun at her chest, ignoring the pain in his shoulder and the ache in his hip, “you don’t get to call the shots anymore
“What do they normally say? Piss off?”
“You’re too kind, really,” she praised, motioning for him to take off his coat and roll his sleeves up for her perusal, “and pardon my saying, but you look
Mrs. Whitney smiled at that, though it was a bit forced. She paused in her brisk pace, looking as if she would say something else, and then thinking better of it. It was no matter to Sherlock either way; he would suss it out later if he had to – that is, if he decided he cared. Instead, she bustled along, bypassing doorway after doorway until she neared one towards the very end of the hallway, on the left.
“I know what I promised, but you must know the chances were…astronomical. Sebastian was already getting antsy, wanting to end everything
Sherlock asked him to calm down, to make it stop. How was he to do that?
When he started medical school he would be a new John Watson, and he’d be damned if he let
Slowly, he turned, and stifled a humourless laugh as a pair of glossy black Magnanni’s came into view. Sherlock Holmes
John cleared his throat nervously; Sherlock’s scent wriggled its way in through the miniscule opening made by the door, floating in through his nostrils and disturbingly insinuating its way into his hind-brain.
John took advantage of the Alpha’s disorientation and grabbed the conniving bastard by his collar. He leaned in, voice dipped low and dangerous. Sherlock may have thought him meek and easily manipulated, but now he was going to learn the truth.
All of this was standard fare, of course, and it wasn’t until the reproductive assessment that John began to feel a bit uncomfortable. At first, he thought he was imagining things…that perhaps he was just unhappy with the situation and superimposing those feelings onto Dr. Wilkes. After all, this man was a Beta (or smelled like one anyway), and they were not known to be sexually aggressive.
His jacket was linen, once expensive, but threadbare around the elbows.
I am SO SORRY it took me a crazy long time to update this story. *points accusing finger at myself* UNACCEPTABLE!!
Instead he faced the main door to the flat, standing at parade rest, or as best as he could muster, what with shaky knees and fat droplets of sweat sluicing their way down his lower back and to more sensitive places he dared not think about if he was going to get  through this next bit. He tremulously clasped his hands behind his back, and waited for Sherlock to arrive home.
“Yeah, alright,” he nodded, a small but genuine smile flitting across his face. “Do you mind if I just sit here?” He motioned to the maroon chair in front of him, as hideous as it was; it was a bit more comfortable than the harsh wooden chairs in the kitchen.
Marcus jerked back as if stung. “
idea, John.”
He didn’t get far, however, as just as he reached the knob, the door opened to reveal Marcus, standing quiet and unsure in the threshold. In his arms were blankets, a few manky pillows, and various other living items he’d collected out in the cold and dismal streets of London.
He was now standing behind two imposing wooden doors, both of which contained a small window offering a glimpse of the other side. The plaque next to the entrance labelled it the King James Conference Room, and though he missed it before, a small piece of paper jammed in the slot underneath the bold lettering quite clearly stated ‘895’ in neat block handwriting. Relocated, huh?
yes.”
would be a gross understatement. He oozed sexuality like –
did he think he was doing?
“Never seen a chat involve restraining a 15 year old kid, maybe I’m not getting out as much as I should.” John replied; following the arc of the cigarette until it landed not far from his water-damaged brogues. After, he nodded towards Raz and took a measured step closer. The men seemed unimpressed, and stood their ground with beefy arms crossed along their sizeable chests. John could feel the tension in the air spike immediately. He wasn’t sure why, but he was certain these men were out for blood, and didn’t much care who they got it from.
“Are you alright Dr. Watson?” It was a simple question, but unexpected. John hadn’t said or overtly broadcasted any of his feelings or emotions during this entire exchange; so for Sherlock to ask him if he was alright was rather…odd.
“May I see him?”
“This is very important information, Sherlock. Don’t make the mistake of thinking you are the only one who has a vested interest in this case,” his long index finger hovered over the ‘enter’ key for a moment longer, “if you can manage to keep quiet for more than two moments, you will be well rewarded, I assure you.”
“I see you’ve discovered my chair.”
“We didn’t even know until the next day. He always worked late for the bank, took his job very seriously that one.” Mr. Chandler’s lips twisted with suppressed grief, “we thought nothing of it, figured he’d show up in time for dinner.”
“Not my John, not mine,” the man gasped, placing his arms across his chest and curling, cross-legged, into himself.
“Stay out of this Mycroft! How many
“I anticipated your concern for the women; they will be taken care of, if you wish. Mycroft has many resources at his disposal –”
But, like many things when one is a member of Her Majesty’s military, he was not allowed to sit still and die. A decision was made for him, whether he agreed with it or not. Louis and Harry clutched the sides of their helms, listening to the rapid, audio correspondence that was naught more than a buzzing of static in John’s ear (Mary’s grin radiant and wide in her face, teeth straight and beautiful, eyes squinting shut with the force of her resplendent smile). Then they moved, each burly man grasping one of John’s arms, clutching at the base of the shoulders and dragging the man bodily away from his deceased love.
“My name is Sally Donovan. I am a Master Guide employed by the Serenity Cottage and believe you to be in great danger. Your handler found you unresponsive in your room just a few moments ago. Please, take my hand and I will help you escape this construct if I can.”
Well, not quite in hospital, but some kind of post-surgical ward.
“So, why did you do it then?” He regarded Sherlock from across the seat, deep oceanic eyes questioning.
“Your own purposes?”
John landed on the rough, hard ground and curled himself into a crouch. He was off-balance and unsteady on his feet, though he had managed to stand up once more. The ground swayed and gave under him, giving him the impression of walking on fine wet sand. He blinked a few more times, more to get the rain out of his face than anything else.
John had already limped his way to the overstuffed chair and was grasping his coat in his hands when he heard the younger man speak.
“My thoughts exactly,” the Alpha replied, as if reading John’s mind, “at first I thought it was some kind of revenge killing. You know, lover’s spat and all that…twaddle. But then another body showed up a few weeks later, and then another. It became more than just a coincidence, and as my brother is so fond of saying-”
Who were these goons anyway? They obviously needed more training.
A brutal force, much like someone fiercely pushing the back of his right thigh had him sprawling forward, crashing to the ground and unable to break his fall. His right cheekbone hit the polished concrete with crushing accuracy as the pain in his leg bloomed on a scale that couldn’t be properly conveyed with words.
The jarring flash of blue and red police lights tripped and stuttered across the wet concrete, reflecting off puddles of murky water and casting the entire street in a pulsing, sickening glow.
John couldn’t move, he could say nothing as Marcus lunged towards the Taser man, teeth bared in animalistic ferocity. Then –
Mustering his strength, and blessedly thankful for his days in the RAMC, John effortlessly slammed his heel against the top of his assailant’s foot, hearing (and feeling) a satisfying crunching sound as the man grunted in poorly concealed pain. He did not lessen his hold though, and John could feel his hands on the man’s forearms begin to grow weak and numbed. As a last resort, he rallied his strength and threw his head back in an uncoordinated but brutal blow to the bridge of the man’s nose.
Finally, Sherlock’s carefully controlled façade cracked. He raised his hands to the side of his head, fists clenched in his hair, face twisted in frustration and something else John couldn’t quite recognize.
A kind of controlled chaos erupted around him, now that stealth was no longer an issue, Lestrade and the other team leaders began barking orders left and right. It made no difference that Adler and others knew they were coming,
John pulled on his jumper, unable to shake a certain sense of foreboding. His mind flew back to the iPhone lying on the bed next to him. He was suddenly very, very thankful that the phone could only record sound; though, thoughts of what that abhorrent man said flew through his mind with unease. There would be questions, and John would not lie.
John eventually rolled off him and used his discarded boxers to wipe them both off a little. Sherlock hardly moved, sleepily allowing John to kiss him.
Sherlock usually only went in there when he was either sleeping or shagging. He obviously wasn't shagging, since John was out here. But John could have sworn he'd slept last night.
"I think we should switch games," John said.
A lot had happened. But he had John back. That was what really mattered in all of this. They were back together again, even after all that had happened. That, in itself, was something of a miracle.
“Yeah, probably,” said Greg. “What should we do?”
Sherlock thought that his flat was the most dismal place in all of existence, until one day, he nearly ran into someone in the hallway.
"I thought it was obvious," Sherlock said, in a slight endorphin daze from being so close to John, and his warmth, and delicious John scent. "I want you to stay with me as long as possible."
"If you could give me a good reason why, I'd have left you alone," Mycroft said.
"Everything I just said, and also your dog. She's a military dog, by her training. Not just any big dog would follow your every command, and know how to crouch behind something for cover."
"Yes," John said.
"Sorry if I'm being abrupt," Lestrade said. "It's been a rough morning, and I haven't been able to make hide nor hair of this crime scene. Sherlock is my consultant, but I had no idea he had an assistant."
"I'm really not," Sherlock replied.
There was plenty here that John wasn't seeing, but Sherlock couldn't tell John as he did normally that he had a database of tire treads memorized. He also couldn't tell him anything about dust settling patterns, or the faint outline of shoe prints in the dust.
Sherlock went through the basket of food, savouring the lingering scent of alpha. It was fading fast, and  Sherlock wished that there was some other way to get John's scent without John actually being there. If only he had some of John's laundry.
"Will you just give in?" asked the alpha. "Half the street can probably smell you."
John was washing dishes and the sight of him was simply too much to bear. Something inside Sherlock overflowed and overwhelmed him.
"Shhh, just let me work in one more finger," John said, and scissored his fingers until he could fit a third.
“Maybe for once I’ll have a girlfriend who sticks around for a while,” John said, and laughed. “I warned her that we might have a case that interrupts a date once in a while, and you know what she said?”
