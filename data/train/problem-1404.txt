John was also invited to an exclusive party, The After Dark Ball, just for those in adult entertainment. It was a splashy affair being held at The Diogenes Club on the first Saturday in April. It was a yearly event attended by strip club owners, high profile exotic dances, porn stars, models, and other doms like him. He was intrigued by the idea of attending a real adult-themed party.
The skies over Sherrinford were gray and gloomy. Heavy rain appeared to be on the horizon and it had turned cooler. The weather was matching the mood of the town, as if it knew the terrifying tragedy that happened the night before.
"Nausea, vomiting, blurred vision, agitation, confusion, dry red skin, dry mouth, a ringing in the ears. More severe symptoms can be seizures, hallucinations, and kidney dysfunction. The person may not be able to urinate. Did your victim experience any of these?" John asked.
Sherlock looked at John for clarification. "Rosie named her. She overheard me telling you how good you look in your bespoke suits and that you want to get me my own bespoke suit, and she thinks bespoke is a happy word."
Mycroft ran down the steps and moved to the side of the house, concealing himself next to a tall green bush, but still able to see the comings and goings. He saw a tiny, brown-haired girl who looked to be fifteen or sixteen with yellow pigtails that matched the short-sleeved yellow blouse she wore. She had plaid knee-length shorts on and yellow Mary-Janes. She had a big smile on her face, which quickly disappeared. She turned her head in both directions and Mycroft knew that she was looking for her ride which hadn’t showed up yet.

Sherlock held his phone up to the man's face. John studied the video intently for a moment and then he nodded quickly. "There are ruptured blood vessels in the eyes, face, and neck. This man was strangled to death. I don't know how Anderson missed that. Wait, never mind, I do."
"How did you come up with this performance?" Greg asked.
*****
"Aubergine, and I agree, it suits me."
"Then we'll schedule another day if he isn't the one. You know whomever is cast as Titan is crucial to the ballet's success," Sherlock retorted.
John was sitting at his kitchen table, enjoying a cup of tea and a plate of bacon, eggs, and sausage. Little Evie was sitting in a booster seat, feeding herself bites of banana, a sippie cup of apple juice mixed with water in reach. The radio was on, and John was listening to the morning news broadcast. A front was coming in tonight, bringing heavy rain after seven-thirty. John thanked his lucky stars he would be home before the deluge began.
“If you’re not off my property in thirty seconds, I’m calling the cops,” John threatened, his dark blue eyes narrowed into tiny slits. Sherlock finally took the hint and scrambled to his bike. In under a minute, he was tearing away from John’s house and down the street to parts unknown.
"I decided coffee and bees can wait for another time. The only hot and sweetness I want right now is you."
"Is it officer? Is it really over?" Wilkes replied cryptically, his face morphing into a twisted, sinister smile.
The two swam, played, and kissed for a while, then they got out, toweling themselves off. The sky had turned a dark gray, and thunder rumbled in the distance. They both knew Florida could bring sudden storms, so they headed indoors.
John extricated himself from Sherlock's embrace, picked up his comic books and trash, and threw them into the basket mounted in front of his bike, which was propped up against the tree across from him. He pulled the bike out and began to walk with it towards the park exit. Sherlock followed him towards his own bike.
"Good evening ladies and gentlemen. My name is Officer Dave Morstan. Beside me is Officer James Sholto. We're from the Sherrinford Police Department, and we have an announcement regarding the Sherrinford Slayer."
"Well, I don't want to prolong your stay any longer Mr. Holmes. I'm going to get that wrap. I'll need you to take off your shirt. I'll be right back." As Doctor Watson was leaving, Sherlock called out to him. "Please call me Sherlock. Mr. Holmes is for my older brother."
I had some difficulty with this prompt so I hope you like it!
"Anything for you John, even going to the shops."
It was a typical Friday night at Lestrade's, the popular disco in London's Soho district. Dancers were crowded on the floor, a mixture of gay, straight, bisexual, and everything in between, black, white, Asian, even some Middle Easterners. It was a rainbow of faces and bodies, all there to have a good time and boogie their hectic week away.
"I couldn't keep anything down either. It really knocked me for a loop," Hal sympathetically replied.
The alpha snorted. "Those alphas are idiots."
"Do you think he's crazy?" John asked.
In this Omegaverse, I've included a new gender that will be explained more in the story.
Bryan shook his head. “No. If Seb or Jim found out I went to the coppers, I can only imagine what they’d do to me. I wouldn’t be alive to tell my story. And, would they even believe me in the first place?”
"Sherlock! Love, come here so we can start celebrating. Mrs. Hudson is here and already sipping some wine," John called happily from the kitchen. Mrs. Hudson could be heard giggling shortly after.
On his way to the studio, John smiled as he remembered his day out with his daughter. She'd been thrilled to see all the animals, squealing and laughing the entire time. Then they had ice cream. John wished Mary had been there to see Evie's happy little face smeared in vanilla custard and rainbow sprinkles. John had taken this coming Saturday off to have another daddy/daughter date at a children's museum on the outskirts of London.
"Come on, let's go in and grab some seats," Harry said, taking Clara's hand. John rolled his eyes and followed.
*****
He swallowed hard, and began to tell his tale. " I---I---I heard him this afternoon. Talking to himself. He was in the basement. I had gone down there to do my homework. It's cool and quiet. Richard has an office down there, and that's where he was at. The door was closed, but he was loud enough for me to hear. He said he was going to kill Jeff Hope tomorrow night. He found out from Sebastian Jeff was planning to break curfew and sneak off to see some girl at the beach. I was so shocked, so scared, I ran back upstairs and stayed in my bedroom. I didn't know what to do."
The alpha's eyes nearly bulged out of its sockets. "Holy shit. That's unreal. No wonder I couldn't smell you so prominently."

If he did agree to work for Irene and Molly, he could use his former military experience as part of his job. Instead of leather, he could wear his old Army uniform and dog tags. He knew there was a whole subculture of those that had military kinks and got off on people in uniform. He could use it to his advantage, and bypass the whole black leather and studs getup. He wasn't too fond of the look, and he'd come off as a poor man's Rob Halford from Judas Priest.
"I'll buy you a drink for a job well done. What's your poison?" John asked.
"Oi, what body parts is he storing in there now?" I asked with a shake of my head.
Now Victor was gone, after the car he was driving hit a patch of black ice which sent him crashing into a tree and no hope of survival. Mrs. Hudson had also passed on, peacefully in her sleep during a vacation to Florida. Sherlock's brother Mycroft had retired from his government job and was now living at the family's other home in France. Sherlock's inner circle had shrunk, but he still had Greg and his friend Molly Hooper, who still worked at the morgue in St. Bart's, only part-time now. She and Greg would visit Sherlock in Sussex when they could. Theo and Sophie transferred to Sussex University to be closer to their father.
"Actually yes." John took a sip of his gin and tonic. "I told Warren about it, and asked him if he wanted to come with me."
, he mused to himself. With a devilish grin on his face, he followed John inside.
"Eating is boring John."
Greg laughed. "Sure thing Dad." Sarge was their Labrador Retriever. He was eight years old and a sweet, but ornery dog who loved getting dirty.
“I can’t complain Mike. I guess I’m lucky to have this job, that I actually like, and Mom is doing a lot better since she got promoted to lead secretary down at Reichenbach’s place. We’re still struggling a bit, but she’ll have a little bit more money in the bank after bills, and my wages and tips here means she doesn’t have to worry about food. She’s actually thinking about selling the cottage and renting an apartment three blocks from the beach. Mr. & Mrs. Reichenbach own this two-bedroom above a laundromat they want to rent out, and they want Mom to have it. We wouldn’t have a washer or a dryer, but it’s closer to her job, and it would be boss being able to walk to the beach and spend more time there. She already has two takers for our house, an older lady named Mrs. Turner and her daughter.”
His brother-in-law sighed. He couldn't keep Marty and Art's murders a secret. He nodded. "Yeah, Hallie, he did."
Tonight, as our entertainment, Gregory has chosen to have one of the best and popular Kine Dancers perform for us. Normally I would not host that type of variety, but I have seen this human in action and he is quite the spectacle, and this is my gift to Gregory. So without further adieu, we present to you, John Watson."
Several moments later, Sherlock saw him approaching the bar, and he let out a sharp breath. Irene, nursing her second Pink Lady, saw the look on her friend's face and let out a giggle. "Looks like coming here was a good idea, judging how you're gaping at the hot blond over there."
He looked pleadingly at Wanda. "John...I heard on the radio that he was shot...I rushed to get here...is he okay?"
Eurus placed the bloody switchblade back in her pocket and smiled sweetly at Jim. Thank you for taking up for me. That’s probably the nicest thing anyone’s done for me a in a long time.” She planted a soft kiss on his cheek, which caught him off guard. “Now, how about coming with me to get a bite to eat. I’m suddenly starving.”  She took hold of his hand.
John laughed. "You sentimental fool."
The ride ended, and John picked up Rosie off her horse. "I wanna do it again Daddy," she said.
Rosie smiled reassuringly at her father. "I know Dad, but Your Turn isn't like all those other dating sites out there. It's strictly for people fifty and up."
"I've come to ask for your help brother mine," Eurus replied.
Pat nodded. "She's very grateful you saved her poker winnings."
******
John nodded against Sherlock's chest. "Sure. I could do with a nap and I figure your beekeeping book is the just thing to put me to sleep." He looked up at him and smiled teasingly."
"We wanted to surprise John," Molly explained.
"You guys really outdid yourselves," Molly said with approval.
New Year's Day, the boys woke up to snow flurries. They paid it no mind and prepared to pack up and head back to London. As much as they loved their Sussex holiday, they were ready to head back to London. They were about two hours away from the city when the snow started to pick up in intensity. John, who was in the passenger seat, looked at his new husband. "Do you think we should try and find a hotel and stay the night until this passes?"
"I'm twenty-four."
They arrived at their destination early Friday evening, a secluded old campground outside of London with a large lake in the middle of the property. It was still on decent shape but passed over for a newly built campground an hour away that had a mini golf course and two pools. Sherlock was grateful for the quiet, which is why John chose the place.
Sherlock stopped playing and turned to look at his daughter, who was snuggled under her bee blanket, eyes closed. He smiled and put his violin away, then sat in his chair, reaching for a book he started reading last night, a non-fiction detailed account about H.H. Holmes, deemed America's first serial killer. John had bought it for him, wondering if Sherlock was related (turns out he wasn't). Sherlock had heard of him, but didn't know the full extent of his crimes, and he was fascinated with learning exactly what he'd done.
"Only because of Evie. And it's not a particularly close one, but I email him pictures of her, and from time to time he calls me and lets me know what's going on. Most of it is ranting about this group or that group, especially gays. It's like dealing with Archie Bunker."
"None of your business Grover," Sherlock retorted, but his lips were quirked up mischievously. He had a running gag where he always called Greg by any other name that began with G besides his own.
Sherlock smiled at John. "I've decided I'll be there after all. I think it's time I put the solar system back in my mind."
"You got it," John said, entering the appointment into his phone.
******
John laughed and sat up, taking Sherlock's hands in his. "Come on, let's get something to eat. What are you in the mood for?"
The two left the studio and were outside in the early afternoon sunshine, heading towards the restaurant, oblivious to the blond staring intensely at them from inside a coffee shop window.
"Tank yoo, Happy Hall'ween!" Rosie said and she turned and ran towards John. "Daddy! More candy!" She showed him her sack, which was nearly full with candy.
Then three months later, Janine showed up at his flat, sporting a slight belly bump. "It's yours. There's been no one else since New Year's Eve," she said.
"Will you continue to come to the meetings John? The guys really liked you, and I think Sebastian will come around," Luke asked once they were done placing their orders.
"But John, my sister is a killer, and I thought if you found out, you wouldn't want to be around me, or my family..."
Before the cries of Happy New Year! rang out, Sherlock pulled John close and kissed him, soft but cool lips pressed to John's. Sherlock tasted of bourbon and mint, John of whiskey and frying oil, but they didn't care. It was their first kiss, and it was magic.
Sherlock’s response was to slowly lick a wet stripe from John’s neck to his earlobe with his tongue. John cringed at the touch and shuddered at the moist heat on his skin. “You taste heavenly,” Sherlock darkly murmured. “Better than all the others I had back in England.”
Valentine's Day wedding fluff!
Seconds later, a pounding disco beat paired with synth sounds could be heard. Sherlock frowned and turned towards Irene, who just shrugged.
"As it should John. I'd do anything to get back to you...I love you."
"What do you want John? Or should I say,
Harold slowly opened his eyes, a look of confusion crossing his face. He glanced around the room, frowning. "Where am I?" he croaked with a dry voice.
Sherlock finished his cigarette and slid down to the ground, folding his long legs underneath him, his back against the wall. He closed his eyes, and soon images of a handsome blond with breathtaking blue eyes and a voice like sunshine filled his mind.
---John
John walked to the bus stop with a spring in his step. When he reached his destination, it was only a few minutes he had to wait, and soon the familiar red double-decker pulled up in front of him. He got on, greeted the driver, and paid his fare.
The two got in Sherlock's car and headed towards town. Soft classical music played on the radio; John closed his eyes and leaned back in the seat with the sunshine on his face and the salty scent of the sea sending him into a relaxed state. Sherlock gazed over at him and chuckled softly. "Already feeling comfortable?"
Irene looked at him in surprise. "You already knew?"
Sherlock stood against his motorcycle in the parking lot, taking a long drag off his cigarette, feeling like an idiot. He knew he shouldn't have confronted John like that, and in the school library, but he was too hopped up on seeing the blond. He needed a friendly face after the last person he met slapped him. It really wasn't his fault though. He pointedly told her she shouldn't be asking him for his phone number when not only was she dating another guy, she was pregnant with said guy's father's baby.
*****
He was engrossed in watching the rain through the glass he didn't hear the voice at first asking to buy him a drink.
He sighed and sat back, the sound of the rain and the windshield wipers making for a relaxing combination of noise. Just then, John's phone pinged. He took it out of his pocket and saw it was a text from Sherlock. He smiled and opened it. It was a selfie of him and Rosie. The little girl was in the tub, streaks of purple and blue paint all over her face. She was grinning from ear to ear, and Sherlock was sitting next to her on the floor, a goofy grin on his face.
He took another drink of water and stayed silent for a few seconds before going on. "I really don't know much of anything else. And I need to get home, before he starts to worry and goes out and looks for me."
"Why would you want to go to something so...pedestrian?" Mycroft made a face that looked like he sucked on a sour lemon.
Sherlock stood in front of the mirror, satisfied that his curls were back in their proper position. He looked intently at his locks. No sign of gray yet. But his face showed more laugh lines, more forehead crinkles, a reminder that he now was forty years old. He couldn't believe he made it this far. So many had told him outright he wouldn't live to see thirty. But he did, and now another ten years had passed, and he was happy. He had a loving husband, his relationship with his brother was more cordial even though Mycroft could still be a big prick at times, and even Anderson and Donovan were less hostile towards him. He was in a very good place, so good that he no longer minded celebrating his birthday. And he was secretly glad that his party at Angelo's got snowed out, because he was right where he wanted to be for his special day, with John, his conductor of light and love of his life, in their flat. His social skills had improved greatly, but he still wasn't a fan of get-togethers.
"Sherlock you and John can fight. Hamish is just a baby! I can get him out of there before anything else happens. Let me do it!" His voice wasn't raised but it was serious and firm. His tone was almost pleading for Sherlock to let him do this. "You and Jacob can follow me in but do not reveal yourselves. You two should go along the top and take out the snipers first." Mycroft motioned to where the two men could slip in.
“John, you have not spoken much about what transpired…” Mycroft said very gently, he and Gregory had been trying to get John to speak about his experiences for several days.
“Seriously, you two have got to stop that. It’s near King’s Cross. Assassin style killing. Will you come?” Greg asked softly, cuddling Hamish for another moment and then setting him down on the couch as Mrs. Hudson sat down with him, talking quietly to the boy.
"Be there at eight o'clock on the nose." The detective smirked settling into his food without John even asking him to.
"It was so comfortable though. And I have no idea when you will actually sleep again." John sighed and pulled himself out of bed to follow Sherlock.
for - was gone." Sherlock looked uncomfortable. It was too much, more than he deserved. This was his fault, he'd put John at risk and brought him pain. He wanted John to be angry, that was the logical reaction to this situation. John should be hitting him, or kicking him out, or any other number of things that an angry person would do. But he was trying to forgive him. Trying to allow him back in, even though his trust had been compromised.
"What do
"I figured you would think it was too sentimental." He turned back to survey Sherlock, analyzing everything about him. "It's your thing, I just..." He shrugged.
"Why do you still hide all of this from me?" His tone was hurt but it also betrayed annoyance.
"Sentimental," Hamish pronounced and looked up at Sherlock who blushed slightly. It was clearly aimed at the detective and even Mycroft gave a small smile. John had to fight not to giggle but Greg couldn't stop himself, after a few minutes John followed Greg into another fit of giggles. A few minutes later Sherlock settled back in his place and John continued.
"Yes, of course!" He was about to lose his temper.
John ignored the sorrow that gnawed at his gut as he held his son close, doing his best to allow the gentleness of his son’s actions to replace the new gaping hole in his heart that was trying to consume him. He fought himself as he was reminded this beautiful boy had been a gift he would never be able to repay Harry for. A gift that was beyond anything he could have ever imagined receiving. Hamish Gregory Holmes was a week away from his first birthday and was currently suffering from a rather bad toothache. The pain coupled with his hurt feelings over the lack of time John and Sherlock had been able to spend with him in the last few weeks had succeeded in convincing his Dads to allow him to sleep in their bed during the day, instead of his own bed which was in John’s former bedroom upstairs. Hamish was long and lanky like his brooding detective father, those same piercing eyes observing every detail of the world behind him from behind his grumpy expression. His hair was wavy like Sherlock’s but colored more like John’s, and though it was clear already he possessed Sherlock’s superior intellect he was softer around the edges and displayed an empathy that could only have come from John. John rocked the boy gently, trying to soothe the eager face staring at him and demanding answers to why he was suffering - while grinning as he remembered the selfless act of Harry that had brought this beautiful boy into their lives.
"So that was him..." John mumbled and Sherlock's attention snapped to him.
" Sherlock's voice was teasing as he worked his fingers deeper and deeper inside him.
“I will come back later to be sure things are well.” She spoke quietly as she stepped from the room. The last thing she heard as his low, growling whisper as she stepped from the room.
"Yes."
"W-What?" John gasped out, clenching and unclenching his fists. He swallowed hard and his eyes hardened. Sherlock took two steps forward, into the room.
“Sherlock!” Sebastian growled, as Sherlock walked passed the main room on his way to his chambers. “Come, have wine with us.” His smirk grew darker as a shudder ran through John. John was on his knees in front of Sebastian; his eyes almost rolled back in his head as Sebastian slowly drug a silver tipped knife over his skin. “Come now mender, you can do better than this.” He rumbled as he lazily shoved his hips up and his member down John’s throat. John grunted in pain.
“While I do feel you should have more control over your instincts and yourself, I understand now why you felt as you did. Why you acted the way you did. While I may not trust you the same as I always have, and our relationship may never again be the same as it was, I still love and care for you. With our enemies back at our door I need to know you will promise me to stay safe and care for Sherlock should anything happen to me.” Mycroft’s frown deepened, his thoughts flickering back to the overheard conversation during their travels.
Sherlock and John woke sometime later in the afternoon when a soft knock echoed through the room. Sherlock pried himself up, wrapping his dressing gown around himself before opening the door to find Mycroft. Mycroft offered him some drawn blood and stepped into the room, trying to ignore the heady smell of the pairs' arousal as he did. He found it moved easily through his body, exciting his own passion despite his efforts to ignore it. John looked up at him from where he was still snuggled in the bed with a smile that sent shivers through his body and he returned it as best he could, sinking down on the couch and watching them as they drank the blood he had brought them.
You all are amazing for not lynching me when I didn't get the next chapter posted. This chapter is a bit shorter but it simply did not want to flesh out into a longer chapter.
"Yes, but that's good. He needs to rest. I know you want him to be better already but you have to give him time to rest my little pirate. I'm sorry we can't play pirated again yet." Hamish snuggled closer to him, clinging to his shirt and looking at his Grandmother.
"Yes I will." Sherlock said proudly and Greg just nodded.
“You worry too much for me.” He whispered, finally uniting their lips in a soft kiss. “I was only gone a few days.” John raised an eyebrow and Sherlock sighed in annoyance. “A fortnight then.”
"Yea, the most important one," He forced out, shivering with silent sobs. Sherlock leaned forward and John let himself melt into the moment but as their lips met the kiss was very different than any of the previous ones. It wasn't about desire or lust. It was a tender, passionate, and fumbling kiss. It was the pain they both held inside and hoped to shelter the other from. It was the deep adoration and love that the two of them had hidden from for so long but now could not hide away.
"Why did you come to Pendergrass Estate?" Sherlock asked and stood to pace. His attention only briefly sweeping over his family long enough to notice Hamish was sleeping again against John's chest.
"Yes." Sherlock stiffened looking at John with a livid stare.
“How can you know that?” He stepped closer, already pulling of his jacket and undershirt. He would claim Sherlock and wipe that smirk off by making the other moan like a whore for release.
“No John, do not attack him.” Sherlock cooed in his ear, trying to soothe his grieving husband.
"Oh I'm sure you'll see it, unless Sherlock suddenly demands I teach him."
"I do actually." He blushed just slightly and John raised an eyebrow. "Oh go on." He said imitating John's earlier actions. "You know very well that I like it when you ask
"Oh my God. That is so powerful.." John's head fell back as he lost his focus, the sensations overwhelming him.
"So my brother..." Sherlock was almost laughing but Mycroft looked angry.
“I told you when I returned you were not to put a hand on my mate. As you cannot control yourself we shall be leaving at darkfall.” Sherlock’s voice was soft but dark.
"John, no," Sherlock's voice was tight with emotion as he tried to soothe his husband, completely unprepared to see him grieving like this. He knew there was so much under this grief, he'd let John go too long without dealing with it. "You haven't failed anyone. Not me, not yourself, not Hamish, and not Harry. Harry made her choice, she was an addict John. As an addict still in recovery I can tell you that her mind was not on you when she started that car." His tone cut through John's sorrow and slowed his tears, slowly drawing the doctor's eyes back up.
"No, thank you dear." She stepped in and laughed. "Your kitchen is so clean today!"
"The visits were my doing." Sherlock sighed and started pacing. John's face tightened as his mouth resumed the tight lipped, straight faced grumpy look he was trying to maintain. More explanations were not at all what he wanted right now. "I was of course concerned about you and how you were getting on after everything. So when Mycroft informed me that some of his surveillance was no longer working due to your lack of leaving the flat, I asked him to begin looking in on you. I needed more information on how you were and whether or not you truly believed I was gone. I needed a way to check in on you without coming close enough to tip off those still lying in wait." John's anger was mounting again. "I had actually hoped you and Mycroft might come to some new understanding in your grief."
"No, I think I am just worn down from trying to keep pace with a man who always goes twice as fast." He smirked but it faded when he saw the worry on Sherlock's face. "Love, it's a cold..."
2 - Shadow Walking - this is an ability to actually bend shadows and thus become invisible. If done in a room full of light it creates a black mist effect, if done in the dark the vampire blends in completely and the shadow simply moves with them.
Tudor England is coming to a close, likely with the next chapter. Then we head towards Victorian England.
“P-Please…” Meaghan gasped her voice dry. She was weak, having ridden non-stop to bring John to safety.
"You love him so much as that? Are you certain you do not simply miss the joys of his flesh?" Mycroft forced out, his tone a challenge though he was simply trying to give his brother anger to bolster himself with.
John was not aware of how violently he was trembling, at least not until Sherlock’s hand dropped from his shoulder to his elbow and directed the mender into the house. John had never before felt so vulnerable and so terrified of Sebastian. In all the years they had met he had always possessed a gentleness that reassured John he was safe despite the history he knew of the coven. Now that gentleness seemed to be a thin mask over something far darker. John however was unable to dwell on his own bodily reaction due to Sherlock’s angry mutterings and tight hold on him as he directed the mender to Mycroft’s study. He kicked opened the door, hard, not noticing when John noticeably jumped. Mycroft was started slightly himself and he looked up at Sherlock, his eyes darkening as he took in the cross look on his brother’s face. He softened however as he looked to John and saw how he was trembling.
"Well the plan didn't involve Hamish and he was injured. So I don't think I deserve any credit for a bungled plan." John blushed because he realized Sherlock was staring at him.
"That does not mean you may run off to him whenever the whim takes you! You are my husband!" Sherlock shouted back at him, standing very close to him.
The majority of the story is written out in my head, it is getting it onto the paper and making sure it doesn't sound awful that has been plaguing me.
He heard the door open downstairs and a very quiet conversation with Mrs. Hudson. He was sure he heard a third voice but dismissed it as being one of the assistants Mycroft often brought with him on these 'visits'. Mrs. Hudson let out a small squeak of delight and John wondered what sort of lovely evening Mycroft had planned for her this time. Every two weeks Mycroft came to the flat, bringing some takeaway that he thought (usually incorrectly) that John might like, for a visit. These visits were tedious chores that John had stopped even trying to pretend for. Each time he would send Mrs. Hudson out with one of her friends to shows, dinner, the cinema, whatever he came up with. He was at least usually better with those. Which made John happy in some dark place, as Mrs. Hudson deserved joy. She'd been amazing to him, bringing him breakfast and tea each day. He had a slight suspicion she was keeping tabs on him as she never cleared away the food and the cups of tea she made him until later in the day, as if keeping count. For three days he hadn't eaten. He had no desire for food. No desire to...
times before." John could not fight the squirming feeling inside his chest as Sherlock admitted that John caused him to skirt the edge of his control. "You're not as physically fit as you used to be, likely owing to your current desire to not care for yourself. But you're still in good physical condition. Your body is much softer than I expected, your skin is so smooth as if begging to be touched." John groaned, opening his eyes to watch Sherlock analyze him. "You've never been touched like this." It wasn't a boast. "I can feel the tiny tremors it sends through you when I move my fingers over your skin. No lover, man or woman, has ever caressed you like this."
"Yes well, I didn't think that part of the plan though all the way, obviously." He replied in a tone that was an attempt at humor, but could not mask the discontent he felt at having to concede he had not been perfect. "It was however, the only means available to me without raising new suspicion. I used his guilt, much as I imagine he used mine. He should have known better." An evil look passed across Sherlock's face but faded quickly. "I convinced him to visit you, to be nice to Mrs. Hudson, even to send Lestrade on vacation. Though I have no qualms about admitting that he chose not to listen to my suggestions about takeaway." Sherlock had said it to be sweet, trying to show John that he'd looked after him even while he was away; but the effect was opposite. John felt panic rise in his chest along with a need to run. His breath hitched as his body contemplated the ways he could escape the amount of emotion he was currently feeling.
"You're going to leave a mark." It was a statement, not a concern.
"Yes, little one. He will be perfectly fine. The longest he has been in a dark mood has been ten days. I believe he will awaken in the next day or so and be confused as to where you are. Will you stay with me until that time?" Mycroft's mouth was on his instantly and John could find no will to say no.
Sherlock sat there, his eyes burning into John's as he panted hard. He was so desperate to just give in and do what John was asking, but he also knew this might be John's first time. His eyes twitched slightly and John smiled.
“I shall. They are a powerful group and it is likely they can assure my safety far better than you.” She smiled a bit.
"He what?" Sherlock deflated slightly and turned to look at John, watching him sleep. He looked pained and Mycroft's rage should have deflated but it didn't. All of Mycroft's hurt welling up and feeding his anger. John had suffered because of Sherlock. Mycroft had not been able to enjoy a moment of peace with John because of Sherlock.
"What the hell?" He mumbled softly, turning to look into Sherlock's face.
“I can and I shall.” Sherlock kissed him, hard, their bodies coming together with force as he claimed John’s mouth over and over again. John could not stop himself from wrapping his arms around Sherlock, groaning as his actions only spurred the other on. “I will erase every hateful thing he has done to you.” He promised his tone softer and more like John remembered. Sherlock’s kisses softened and he continued to hold dominance over the mender until he felt the mender’s arms go slack. He stood, sighing softly as he regarded the wounded man. He would find a way to flee this place and make this man his own. He tore from the room, returning to his own and set himself to brooding away some plan to escape.
The scene they found made Mycroft want to turn away Elizabeth, so he paused for a moment to enjoy the scene. Sherlock was lying, fully clothed, in bed with John nestled against his chest. John was looking up at him, his eyes half lidded in comfort as they whispered softly back and forth. Whatever words Sherlock was saying were soothing the mender who snuggled in closer. Mycroft enjoyed the sincere and earnest smile that bloomed on his brother's face as John sought out physical comfort for the first time since his ordeal and sighed that he must interrupt them.
"Sherlock, come here." Mycroft called from the hallway and Sherlock growled but obliged moving to speak with a doctor. A nurse came in and fussed with John. Sherlock returned a few minutes later and then growled when a nurse came and drew blood from him.
John. If I had done as I should have you would have been able to resist Moriarty enough to break free of his hold. I have failed you tremendously by refusing to train you with your abilities. I have not been a very adept mate to you and it is because of that you have suffered this." Sherlock cupped his cheek, stroking his thumb across it.
John was tight, rigid. Tension filled his entire body but there were no twitches or spasms. Just pure tension -
"You know so little of me yet you seem to care so much. I have never seen this side of you, Lord Holmes." His voice was soft but he tried to remain firm. Mycroft was pleased by his effort and softened more, cradling him close to his own body. Trying to help subdue the shivering that possessed him now.
“Love you… I will find you… Wait for me.” John promised, coughing again.
"You fed all on your own this time." He praised and John looked up at him with an eager and blush tinged face.
The group made it back to the house and Sherlock led John up to John's room. A fire glowing in the hearth as he stripped to cloak off John's shoulders. John pressed forward and began to undo the ties of Sherlock's shirt, drawing a confused expression from him. John simply smiled and pulled the shirt away, exposing Sherlock's long lean torso. He motioned for Sherlock to get comfortable on the bed before pulling his own shirt off and crawling up to join him. John shifted Sherlock this way and that until he had himself draped across Sherlock's lap and wrapped in his arms against his chest. He leaned his cheek down against the pale skin and sighed softly as a tear fell.
The next chapter will be pure fluffy goodness before everything comes to a head!
Sherlock did not allow John to remain at the Holmes manor for much longer, following Mycroft’s attack. Instead he pressured the other into moving into the city, to the rooms that Mrs. Hudson had mentioned when they had seen her in the city last. However, the short time they remained at the coven house had been nearly disastrous to the other members of the clan. Somehow, however good came from the incident as John and Gregory were both at the mercy of the Holmes anger for each other, and through that found a sort of bond that grew into a strong friendship. Though John refused to tell Gregory anything that might sway his opinion that Mycroft was anything but a good man. Just as soon as the snows relented enough for a carriage to travel the roads, Sherlock uprooted himself and John taking them to Baker street.
"So your Uncle obviously found you." Sherlock said grumpily.
“No!” She shouted loudly. “It’s a trap! Flee John!” She ordered, but it was too late.
“Hmph, you really are a stubborn creature.” James purred. He leaned in to kiss Sherlock, surprised when Sherlock did not pull away. “We will be leaving again in a fortnight. The coven is meeting at the original coven house and there I shall secure my place anew within these walls. Behave until then at least?”
"You should be resting. How are you feeling?" He asked quietly, as John nuzzled into his arms.
"It's true. I heard you in that suite in the hospital. I came in when you two slept and watched how you were so lightly sleeping, ready to jump at a moment's notice if either of your loves were in discomfort or pain. You are a brilliant father."
"Do you not enjoy this sort of event?" Sherlock asked darkly and John knew immediately it was a question of test, he wanted to determine outright if John was even worth his time. He felt obligated to be honest. Sherlock walked towards him slowly, enjoying the sound of silence around them and the look of confusion and desire brewing on the man's face. He understood why his brother had brought him now, because he felt it the sensation of a string connecting the two and pulling them ever closer together.
"Yes and he'll be responsible for more if you don't keep an eye on yourselves." Jacob stood and sighed.
Sherlock's eyes had gone silver as they watched John huff warm breath across his stirring erection. He moaned loudly before shouting as John's fingers began to deftly explore the twitching member as if he'd never seen it before. Lips and tongue followed fingers before John took the whole of Sherlock in his mouth, humming with contentment as Sherlock again shouted and forced himself not to buck into John's mouth. John moaned again, he felt powerful. The feel of his mate, a man like Sherlock Holmes, restraining himself to prove his heart made John alternate between weeping with joy and sheer thrill. For that moment he felt like himself again and all he desired was to see his mate come apart under his work. To see that he could make take Sherlock apart. It was selfish and dark but John needed it and he found that Sherlock made no effort to resist.
"You would do well to remember what it is like to suffer the wrath of your brother. John has been nothing short of kind to everyone here and the two of you have seen fit to abuse that. He is a tender soul with compassion for all of us, we will not see him suffer so." George added darkly, before stepping back into the hallway.
"If... If I..." Sherlock's throat was stuck. He was trying to warn him, to make sure he really knew what he was saying. John almost laughed at the effect he was having on the great Sherlock Holmes, but stifled it so Sherlock wouldn't think he was joking.
"God you push me." Sherlock whispered his lips meeting John's again. "Do you know how many indecent things I want to do to you right now?" John met his eyes and blushed.
it. Please let me claim you." John's voice was soft, a breathless growl as he claimed Sherlock's mouth again. Sherlock's mind felt like it was liquid, the desire that had been coiling away inside his chest for months reigniting as if his entire being was being consumed in the flames.
“Greg, I need the files for Elisa Monroe, Dominic Argyle, Kevin McDougall, and Jensen, and James Pendergrass. As well as everything you have on this case already. ”John said from where he was reexamining the body. Sherlock looked at John with wide eyes; those were five unsolved cases that Sherlock himself had been studying for many years. Greg seemed to catch on and looked at Sherlock with confusion for a moment, he didn't like the look he found there.
, your poor sweet pet. You'd never leave him to die all alone." She was still sort of singing at Sherlock and it unnerved him slightly, the woman had clearly lost her mind. "No, you'd never. But it's too late." She flashed her teeth at him in a huge grin.
"She never got to make amends with you..."
"I don't think I will ever get used to how incredibly arousing it is to hear you announce details about a crime scene." Sherlock whispered nuzzling over his ear. "You've gotten so much better lately... Even noticing things I miss." He was purring the compliments into John's ear, making him shiver.
battles." Sherlock paused watching with almost pure fascination as John pulled slightly away and unbuttoned the top few buttons of his shirt. Sherlock realized almost instantly what John was doing but his attention was caught by the force of what John was doing. He slipped his dog tags out from under his shirt and slowly forced Sherlock to let him slip them over his head. "John, this is too much." He tried to protest. This was
” Tears ran down Sherlock’s face and James seemed only amused by them.
taken care of.” He replied coolly, his eyes flashing over John. John could feel the force of Jim trying to push his way into his mind but he easily repelled it. His pendant flashing slightly.
"Sherlock is..." John shuddered and Mycroft instantly realized the carelessness of his words.
"Yes, he did. Clever boy." Sherlock smirked and strode into the bathroom, pleased to see John had pulled himself out of bed and moved to the table.
“Oh my love, please…” John groaned as Sherlock clawed into his chest. Sherlock trailed his mouth down, grabbing John’s hips hard when John bucked up in surprise. Sherlock’s tongue tracing the quivering ring of muscle he so longed to claim. “Sherlock!” John panted, clawing the bed hard.
"Feel it in your body," Mycroft whispered as a command. "Feel the hunger rise." His voice was low, purring against John's ear. John felt his focus narrow, all he could feel was the hunger. "Your teeth want to change, feel it." John closed his eyes and felt how his entire body forced his energy forward. Forced the need to focus. "Yes my little vampire, come on..." Mycroft groaned as John leaned forward and sank his teeth into Mycroft's neck. Both of them groaning deeply. Sherlock moaned lowly. John felt fire throughout his body and absently began moving his hips, Mycroft pumping into him with his still hard erection. "Yes, that is good. Keep going." Mycroft finally pulled back as they both shouted and released, John falling back against Sherlock.
"You're just here to cause trouble." Sherlock said dismissively, trying to cool his own anger.
"I don't want to be with her." He whispered. "She proved to me that these feelings were dangerous. It was easier for me to be caught off guard by them with her, when she suddenly showed up. I did feel very strongly attracted to her, I could have grown to love her I imagine but my heart already belonged to you. After she… After what she did I determined it would be wrong of me to let you in further."
"Sherlock will not move." He whimpered, panic in his voice.
"You deserve far more than an old wounded soldier, Sherlock."
John was panting with effort, struggling as his mind fought against the ever building amount of herb in his blood. Thankfully Meaghan had seen fit to tie him down; otherwise he could not be sure what he would do. The physical effects were strong, making him dangerous even to Meaghan as she tried to tend to him. However, worse were the memories his mind provided him. Memories of all those times when Mycroft and Sherlock had helped him through the blood passion that came from the herbs. For almost two months John remained on the knife’s edge of desperation for death and an arousal so strong that his entire hallway was cordoned off from the coven. Meaghan worried that her father would not return in time and John might perish from the strain off it all, but just as her hope waned news of her father’s arrival came. When they arrived she was waiting at the door for them, something that Sebastian felt was not only suspicious but worrying. He took a moment to survey her and noted she looked worried and he frowned, knowing something was wrong with the mender.
." He growled. Her hair was a mess, it stood up at weird angles and looked like she'd run her hands through it several times without realizing she was dripping with John's blood. His blood stained her blouse, her skirt, and her hands. Another smear was prominent over her cheek where she had carelessly wiped sweat away. She was unstable and Sherlock felt nothing but panic at the fact he could not get between her and John.
“More!” Sebastian demanded his mind full of nothing save the primal need of physical pleasure.
The first message had included a picture clearly showing Sherlock the extent of John's chest and face. No major injuries looked present. That was enough to be going on with there. The second picture showed the John unconscious and tied to a chair. The syringe on the ground added the final clue that Sherlock needed about John's condition and instilled in him a greater rush of panic. The picture was deliberately vague but Sherlock already knew which of the warehouses it was. He pushed himself up out of the bed, determination crossing his face as he ripped off his hospital gown and started pulling on the clothes Mycroft had brought him. Sherlock started typing away at something on his phone and opened a web page, a smirk on his face as the map showed GPS coordinates for something.
"Poor thing, I take it that wasn't a cold then." Greg smirked.
-Overnight bag tossed about on the ground, only in town for a few days.
“A week ago, I stole into the room you were in during the day and drank of you so that I would see your memories. I was not prepared.” Sherlock jumped up, needing to move as he tried to cope with what John had seen and suffered. “How you bore the things you did… How you’ve managed to keep your faith and hope alive despite such terrible torments… I simply do not understand.” He turned to look at John, a mixture of awe and pain on his face. “You could have simply let me go, lived a life free of pain and torment. You could have gone anywhere and done anything you wished, instead you stayed where your heart was continually injured every day. Your heart that then led you into his clutches and left you on the edge of life so many times…” His voice cracked a bit and her turned to stare at John, adoration shining in his eyes. “You are stronger and more loyal than any other person I have ever met.” He praised, and John could not accept it. He needed his mate to understand.
He heard footsteps and looked up into the face of Kitty Riley, a sneer to rival any other he'd ever seen playing across her face. She backhanded him rather hard for a girl but he wasn't fazed, his lip bleed though. His back ached and he realized that his shin was cut open and very poorly bandaged. She backhanded him again and then a third time for measure, growling.
"I'm sorry to interrupt I have a letter here for Mr. Watson." The young man was in a pressed suit, short black hair, and brown eyes that were focused on his purpose.
"No." A smack again, this time on the arm.
something that he knew to be irrational.
They were in a large room made of some sort of smooth stone and illuminated with a golden glow from several lighting fixtures around the room. The entire room was underground and there was only one entrance set far against the wall opposite the area he was in. He and Hamish were alone and trapped in what looked like a large cage, the only furnishing was a bed built into the wall where Hamish was lying shivering. John was on the floor and his back gave a painful ache. His wedding ring, pistol, and cell phone were missing. Hamish looked to be okay, no injuries or bleeding that John could see which was a relief. John himself seemed to only have the bump on the head and one black eye. He struggled to remain sturdy on his feet, trying to show strength in front of the obviously terrified little boy.
"Sherlock, what are you playing at? You're never a gracious host like this, usually you're all wrapped up in the arm chair, your collar popped up and an angry look on your face." Lestrade said suddenly and all of them laughed. "Donovan's coming later yea, so if you're playing any pranks let's get it out of the way now."
"M-Mycroft... Why..." John tried to speak, his voice dissolving into loud, wanton moans.
" Mycroft's voice was a whisper. "
As always comments and kudos appreciated!
"Just as you have done to me for so long," His breath blew across John's ear again, making him shiver. "When I am done with you John Watson, no one else will ever be able to satisfy you." He wasn't saying it to boast, but as a statement of fact.
and beg you to keep it safe so I will know you when I find you again. I have decided that I shall become a doctor as well as a soldier - that way if we ever again encounter the Beast I can save the victim. That I shall possess the knowledge that would have saved us this distance in the beginning. So that we shall never again be separated. I understand how terribly difficult it must have been for you to confess such sentiment when you told me before loyalty was all you needed, but you should know I still feel the same as I did. Those words whispered in the rain in the forest have not changed. I look forward to the day we meet again, always yours John." John's eyes were glassed over and Sherlock was utterly a wreck, betraying far too much emotion all at once. It was actually slightly disturbing to Greg and Mycroft how much he was unrestrained in this moment.  "But John never heard back from Prince Erik, he couldn't even be sure the letter made it to him after all he didn't trust Prince Croft as much as Erik did. But something even better happened, though John didn't know it at the time. One day, six years ago Captain John took a chance and followed an old friend into a lab where he met the now grown up detective Sherlock Holmes." Hamish let out a happy sigh from where he was snuggled deep under a blanket in John's lap.
"No wonder he is so horrible to people." Greg whispered softly, putting his hand on the table. "I know how bad I would feel about that, I can't imagine how it went for him."
"Leave him. No matter what I think he is I know he is
"Yes, all this time it seemed that he'd only contacted her when he wanted to setup the story about Richard Brooks, but I have found evidence they were linked before that. Long before that whole incident began. I think she was partially responsible for building up our publicity when we first started getting popular. You of course were the primary instrument of that, but I think she really blew it up - got us out into the limelight. I think she did it partially so that when Moriarty was able to take me down it would look that much worse and I would seemingly suffer that much more."
"Hamish," Sherlock said scoldingly, stopping John from answering until he asked properly.
"Even now you're going to try to say I'm wrong?" Sherlock's mouth hitched into a grin.
"There are rules for tonight John, beginning now. Rule number one - no discussing the current cases or anything involving this tangled web once we step outside the house. There are eyes and ears all around us, at least here we know whose they are." A small smirk but all seriousness. "Two we don't do anything that you are uncomfortable with." His voice betrayed just how serious he was, wanting to be sure that John understood he could say no. John however picked up something more in the way he'd said it. Picking up a revelation about Sherlock's past that he had not meant to divulge in that moment.
"John," He clicked his tongue. "You need to rest and to eat properly. Don't start something you aren't ready to finish." He grinned with pure desire and then picked up his violin. He did a few strokes across the strings to warm up before turning to look John directly in the eyes. "You had better clean up, we're going to dinner tonight." Without another word, Sherlock began to play John's favorite tune, not seeing the tears that fell as John turned back to clean up the kitchen.
"What?" John demanded, knowing that Sherlock's mind was hard to keep up with.
The next evening, they heard Gregory’s familiar footfall on the stairs as he barreled up them. The pair were up, pulling their coats on, before he even appeared in the room. He looked worn, his face tired and it was clear he had not fed in several days. John frowned, moving to open a bottle of bloodwine to share with his friend when Gregory waved him off.
John’s body language was rigid and closed off; he also wasn’t looking Sherlock in the eyes. Sherlock watched as John became a mask of emotion, something Sherlock couldn't read no matter how hard he tried. It was a trick John had taught himself during their short separation before Hamish was born. It worried him, John was somehow connected to the Pendergrass Murders and he wasn't about to tell Sherlock how. Greg sighed and hung up the phone, moving back over and crossing his arms. When Sherlock stood and signaled he was ready to speak, Greg spoke first.
"There are many reasons, cousin." She said stiffly, stepping back slightly. "The most important was that I wished to look in on you and see how you were. James informed me that you were quite extensively harmed by the actions of those he counted as friends and had no news to report to me on your recovery. As I understand it several inquires he made regarding your wellbeing have gone unanswered. I also came to inquire as to why you have not sent any request to know the state of my beloved's health or my own, as you are not the only one to have suffered at the hands of the younger Lord Moran and his ghastly accomplice. My James has been utterly beside himself since the incident and you my cousin have shared no kind word with him, though it was you who tried to seduce him." John's brow furrowed, Sherlock and Mycroft both tensed angrily, and Elizabeth looked waspish.
"I thought it was blatantly obvious that was how things would be when you came with me to Lauriston Gardens." Sherlock grinned and John shook his head.
“I do as I wish.” He growled in response, pushing John harder into the wall. “Who are you?
"Thank you Molly. I appreciate this, I know you didn't come out here to run errands." He kissed her cheek and immediately pulled the boxed from the bags.
"No you're not," Their eyes met. "You're angry. You're angry with yourself." John groaned inwardly, how could he have forgotten that to Sherlock he was transparent as glass?
The next day just before noon Mycroft summoned them down to the dining room to discuss the planned social engagements ahead. He refused to look at John, but felt the ripple of sorrow that went through the mender when he tried and failed to gain Mycroft's attention. Sherlock kept his hand on the small of John's back, helping him down into his chair before taking his own and glaring at his brother.
His breath locked in his chest as his heart hammered against his ribs. He tried to speak, to say something that would draw John out of the darkness around them, but his voice felt trapped inside his throat. And for the first time he could not detach from his feelings. Love. It was
"You're really not well. How long have you been sick and not telling me, John?" Sherlock whispered as John clumsily wrapped his arms around him.
“You know full well I shall, and I shall not let anything happen to either of you,” Mycroft promised. He sipped his blood wine, watching the Mender carefully as he started to pace slightly.
Marcus fell over shuddering as he did and Sherlock never noticed that he'd pulled the trigger. Instead he first saw pure fear and terror building in John’s face. He then felt fire bloom across his abdomen and looked up at John as John screamed his name and lurched forward, sinking the hook into his neck. Sherlock took a few shaking steps towards John, both of them reaching out for the other before he collapsed. The pain in his body was so much he felt like he was disconnected from it, watching himself from some other vantage point outside of it. Mycroft was shouting behind him and men with guns poured into the room. But neither of them heard anything he said, both of them watching in horror as their lover was bleeding out and their vision swam and faded to darkness.
She moved like a cat and tackled Sherlock at the knees, smacking his head into the ground hard. There were a few minutes of tense struggle as she tried to stab him with the scalpel. Her actions dislodged the pistol from his hand as he deflected one swipe only to be caught with the next. The scalpel lodged itself in his right bicep and he let out a shout. He went to grab her but she rolled away, flipping over as she did and coming up with his pistol firmly in her hand. She pointed it first at John but then smirking she turned it to Sherlock's chest.
"Go to the Yard as soon as you are able. Good day." Mycroft nodded and stepped away from Sherlock and walked directly out of the flat.
." He ordered, pressing their mouths together as he rocked their hips together. Both of them shouting into the kiss. He kept rocking his hips forward at a slow pace until both of them trembled and shouted as they reached their orgasms. He kissed John over and over. "Sleep now, my little mender. Rest with me." He commanded and John's eyes fluttered closed. Mycroft's face darkened as he cleaned them up and settled into the bed next to John, his mind focused on how to best punish Sherlock for what he'd done. "
"Only because I want people to be able to
"I don't..."
“I surely promise you there is not more that could be done to harm my opinion than he has done himself. He has become harsh since you all left, his manner has soured, and he refuses to confide even in me. I confess, we are not even sharing a bed.” Gregory’s voice was tense and drew John’s attention. John paused, taking in the body language of the other as he stared at the floor. John’s frown deepened, and he sighed.
“It's called familial tidings, Lestrade Surely you understand that?” Sherlock scolded and moved quickly to the corner of the room where he scooped up his violin and John's case.
"Don't even try to pretend it wasn't. I've put it all together Mycroft and we both know if I can put it together he can. We also both know that it isn't going to go over easily, it's not going to be something that he can just accept. I know how I feel. I know that it doesn't matter. It wouldn't have mattered if you had picked me up yourself thrown all my stuff into Baker Street and told me I had no choice, because we both know you can't control how I feel. My heart is beyond your grasp, something that has always bothered you immensely." John smirked a bit as Mycroft's face conceded the point. But John was standing in the living room in such a way he could not see what Mycroft could. He couldn't see the bathroom door propped open just enough that Sherlock's eyes could sweep every motion his brother made and every word landed clearly on his ears. "But he needs to know
“I…. Sorry…” John grunted, blood running from the side of his mouth and pooling below him.
A text alert noise was the first sound that Sherlock heard next. When he opened his eyes he was in the hospital and Mycroft was sitting beside him. A quick look over Mycroft's face told him what he needed to know. They'd taken John as expected.
"I... I know... You get bad guys." Hamish said softly, looking ashamed for being so sad. John sighed.
"The Order knows about that?" John's voice was timid, not afraid but not masking his concern.
"This still isn't right." He mumbled softly and got up, tearing up the stairs before anyone could say anything to him. Sherlock was actually drawn from the files long enough to watch his husband, a contented hum escaping him as he returned to work. John rummaged through their suitcase until he found an old brown leather journal, almost sighing with pleasure at seeing it again. He brought it downstairs and sat back down opening it to compare it to the witness accounts from James Pendergrass' file.
"It's not big enough." He pouted, John almost laughed.
The next chapter will be called a Study in Scarlet and we will soon (sooner than I am sure we would like) be headed out of this time period and into the BBC Sherlock Universe.
"Where is Sherlock?" Her tone was polite but it didn't mask that she seemed to know they'd had a row.
"Is it twue?!" Hamish demanded, his eyes wide. "Is that when you met Daddy?" He turned to look at Sherlock, narrowing his eyes.
"I have to go to Baker Street. Now." Sherlock looked around. "Where is it?" He demanded, dancing around the room.
“Y-yes…  The… Gathering,” He forced out.
"As have I." John kissed him again before settling down against his chest, slowly allowing the weary exhaustion that had chased him for months claim him.
My dear readers! I am so sorry for the delay what with the holidays, series 3, and the beginning of a new semester! I have so much of this story already planned out but getting it down on the page has proven a bit difficult. I will try to get the next chapter up ASAP!
"You're wrong." His tone made her growl and she stepped towards him. It made Sherlock tense and the sight of John's blood on her was not helping his calm demeanor. "It is not too late for him, but it is for you."
It was a knife that dug deeply at John – though Mycroft did try to be gentle with the budding romance so as to ease the Mender’s heart. John was in a way, quite happy for his Sire, though it felt like a knife twisting into his soul at every pass. As Gregory and Mycroft grew closer, John grew more distant; behaviors which were not comforted by the quickly approaching wedding of Sherlock and James. As the date of the wedding drew closer John became more isolated and easily agitated. He refused to speak even with Mycroft, preferring instead to remain in the confines of the library. Gregory and Mycroft had formulated a plan in the hopes of convincing Sherlock not to go through with the wedding, however to perfectly succeed with the plan they needed John’s help. Something he had so far been quite reluctant to provide. The day before the wedding Mycroft stormed off towards the library, in the hopes of finding it occupied, and hoping his one last attempt to convince John would work.
"What are you doing?" He growled.
John just nodded but his entire body tensed and his mind went blank as Sherlock's hands began exploring his hips and over his thighs. He cried out as the touch shifted and he realized that Sherlock had wrapped his hands around his erection. He explored every inch of him before sliding up and down over it, watching how each pass made John shiver and moan. He changed his speed, alternating his touch and the amount of contact. Tormenting John and learning every detail he could about how to bring pleasure to him.
It took all his cunning but Sebastian was able to get himself underneath the carriage roof without exposing John to sunlight. He pulled the weakened mender into his arms, wincing as John cried out in pain.
then again over some demonic dog that I couldn't accept. You stood beside me as the entire world turned on me, despite the fact you warned me it would happen. And I repaid all of that effort by just giving up." John searched his eyes as he spoke, trying to find the meaning behind what Sherlock was saying. Trying to understand what he was feeling. "Do you know why," His voice cracked.
"Please Lady Anthea, I entreat you to move John to speak with me. I have wronged him greatly and I need to see him. Please." Anthea felt how the woman shook and helped her up, noting she now had a Solvanaar necklace around her neck.
"Sherlock, if you do this to John again the punishment will be severe. Take him and make him feed, then care for him." Mycroft ordered softly, not turning back to look in the room.
"Nein, ich bin nicht okay. Min Sohn und mein Mann sind in Gefahr sind sie nicht?" He asked him, turning to look at him.
"You didn't even see it did you?"
"And I, you." He whispered as they sank into a strange sleep, plagued with dreams.
“That is just precious.” Greg giggled.
like that. Interesting thought Lestrade. Thank you." Sherlock sat forward putting his fingers under his chin and returning his full attention to John. Lestrade just shook his head. He knew that Sherlock's attention was gone.
“You owe me nothing. This is but a small portion of repayment to the mender for how many times he has saved my family. He was drawn in by that very desire, a plot made so that it would seem my sister Anna became ill. That was how he was caught.” She sighed and looked down at the glass in her hands. “He is our savior and the way my father repaid him was more terrible than I can ever explain.”
"Why did you not take me last evening?" John forced out, his shivering slowly subsiding.
"What's going on Sherlock, you're acting weird."
"I'm sorry, he was determined to find..." He paused and looked down. "You're the nephew..." He whispered.
"A child? Really?" He demanded, sounding giddy and excited, but John saw something cold in his glare. "My wife is a fine specimen to be sure! We should celebrate. You will celebrate with me won't you? I don't have anyone else!" He dashed over to the sideboard and opened a bottle of bloodwine, pouring them each a glass. "Please tell me you will. I know there has been bad blood between us John, however this is a cause for peace. This shall be a blessing for us all!" He sat down across from John his eyes never leaving him.
Sherlock's mind had been rampant with thoughts of his brother since their last bout against this blood passion in the little mender.  Thoughts that he'd locked away as mere folly barreling to the surface as his gaze burned into his brother's form. He had to concede that watching how easily his brother worked his lover into a frenzy had become deeply pleasuring. Perhaps the situation was now established enough it would allow Sherlock to conduct an experiment. He slowly ghosted his fingers up over his brother's shoulder and across neck, raising an eyebrow with a smirk as he saw goose pimples cover his brother's flesh. Mycroft let out a soft moan, pulling up and away from John's mouth before turning to look at his brother with a confused and incredulous glare. John was caught between his own desperation and the slow smoldering heat passing between the brother's glances, his own breath hitching as it was sucked from his lungs by the fire burning between them.  Mycroft felt his skin flutter as Sherlock wound his fingers in his hair and tugged gently, his confusion deepening. This was not arranged or discussed, though if he was honest it was also not... Unwelcome. A smirk barely twitched at the edge of Sherlock's mouth before he pressed up and kissed his brother, enjoying the surprised moans that came from both his brother and their desperate lover. There was a struggle and suddenly Sherlock was pressed back into the bed, Mycroft plundering his mouth and grasping his hair possessively. John whimpered and struggled but half of Mycroft's body was still on him, keeping him pinned to the bed. The noises issuing from the throats of the brothers resonated in John until his entire body felt like it was liquid.
, what history is there between you and Lord Sebastian Moran?" Mycroft demanded and stepped back from John. John felt himself compelled to tell the story and slowly moved over to sink down on the couch across from Sherlock. Mycroft sank down on the couch next to his brother, both of them across from John. They both leaned forward, mimicking each other by putting their hands together against their chins. Both of them burning their attention into John.
." Pure desire causing the heat to skyrocket through John's body yet again, "No this is something about work. I want you to become my full time assistant. I know that the financial aspects of what happened left you quite well off, even with the required recompense for my being alive. So, since money is no longer a factor for you - I need you. I need your expertise and your mind beside me at all times." There was something about the way he asked that mixed John up inside. He wasn't just asking about work, he was asking John to never leave his side.
"Be that as it may they are no longer welcome in my home for any reason and should they choose to darken my doorstep their safety is not my concern." Mycroft growled.
"I love you." Sherlock replied.
"My brother, you should..." Mycroft moved to hug him, to comfort him. Sherlock however pulled away and stalked partially across the balcony.
." He sighed. "Whatever
"It'll likely be some time before they get anything that exciting." John smirked and they laughed. "Ouch." He sighed, realizing again he was injured.
He watched in stunned silence as John stood and walked over to the ceramic vessel containing Elizabeth’s herbs and began to go through it as if it contained the secret to life. He took a handful of the herbs and scattered them out on the table as he examined each component of the blend. Footsteps echoed in the hall and Sherlock looked up just as Mycroft led the Duke into the room.
"God I can't believe you lied to me." He growled, his nails digging into John's hips before one had slipped under John and wrapped tightly around his length, stroking up and down in time with the thrusts meeting his sore ass.
"Minutes." They all laughed again and John nodded. "Thanks Greg."
"I am
“What has happened?” Moran demanded darkly, apparently displeased with Moriarty’s accusations against John.
voice, close to him. He looked up at her, his vision swimming as he tried to focus. His eyes wide with fear. She stepped forward, tucking a small envelope into his jacket pocket. "How you have suffered for such a foolish man. He doesn't realize how important you are." She knelt down, beside him her voice a kind and very feeling whisper. "John, focus on me." She commanded and he found he had no choice but to. "You have to tell him that he can't take his eyes off you for a moment. Stay beside him, no matter what!" She commanded again still softly, cupping his cheek. John tried to speak. "Just nod and I will get you help. Save him from himself, John." John barely nodded as he passed out. Irene Adler stood looking over the innocent man before her. This man who loved Sherlock more than his own life, this man who would give his own blood to save him, who gave so much of himself to let him feel for her… She pulled out her phone dialing the police. She knew she was being watched and by whom, but she would not let this man come to harm. "Yes, I've just found a man who was attacked by two men with knives." She gave them the location of the alley way. "No, don't just send anyone. Send someone from Detective Inspector Lestrade's division, it's very important." She hung up. "Don't worry John, you won't die now." She whispered, snapping a picture of him before stealing away.
"Sherlock!" John hissed. "Fuck!"
"Here's the tea. Is he sick?" Greg asked quietly. Not realizing John was awake.
"No. I... I just never realized how much I meant to you." His eyes burned into John's but the blush came back to his cheekbones. "I always thought things were so one sided, but I should have known better. The signs were always in front of me and I was just oblivious to them."
"You… Oh… Right, I forgot." John whispered with confusion. He had forgotten about that part of the plan. He tried to say something else but Sherlock gently placed his finger over John's lips.
- a woman whose mind was so like Sherlock's she stole his attention from the very man who stood beside him, the man who would never let him fall.
The morning of the wedding came and with John still refusing to attend, Mycroft was forced to leave his grief stricken mender at home and attend the ceremony with a pretend sentiment in his heart. While Mycroft and Gregory were pretending to be happy for Sherlock and attempting to find an opening to get him away from James, John quietly packed a bag and left the coven house leaving behind only a simple note.
. Sherlock grabbed John's hand a bit tighter, afraid to do more as they heard Lestrade's footsteps in the hall.
of what he took in settled over him.
." Sherlock's voice growled in John's body.
"I'm going to go see if we've gotten any leads." Lestrade stepped out. Mrs. Hudson didn't look away from John, not wanting to see another row between the two brothers.
"Are you ready John?" Mycroft asked quietly and John simply shook his head. "Answer me." He growled, digging his nails into John's ass. John shouted and moaned.
." He let his teeth trail over John's neck before gently sinking them into the exact same place as the night before.
They spent most of the rest of that day catching up with Elaine before they were finally allowed to leave the hospital just after breakfast the next morning. The car ride was somewhat eventful as Sherlock had trouble every time the car hit a bump in the road and Hamish could not sit still. Once they finally arrived at the manor it was to find Georgina, Jacob, and Uthur waiting for them in the living room. Lunch was set on the table and two of the staff bustled about taking their luggage to their rooms and making sure they had everything they needed. Georgina jumped up and met them at the door surveying them as she did. Sherlock looked normal save his hand resting gently across his abdomen, clearly protecting the location of his wound. He was wearing a t-shirt under one of his button down shirts but the shirt was unbuttoned, likely because John wanted to make sure his stitched didn't bleed. John was wearing his normal button down under a jumper and black trousers. The only sign remaining of his struggle was the bandage on his neck. Hamish skipped around them, happy to be able to be noisy again.
"Lestrade gives us the cases John." Impatient click.
"Sherlock, are you asking me on a date?" John's voice was still soft but a smirk played at the corners of his mouth.
" The greed and lust in his voice was unmistakable. "
"She was there." He sighed softly. "She told me to tell you to not let me out of your sight, to stay with you no matter what." He smirked. "Not that she needed to do that. I'm never leaving your side." Sherlock cough slightly, hiding a blush. John didn't mention the rest.
"I'm going to go upstairs myself. I believe my son asked for my attention and I'll have better luck in my mind palace if I don't have you two staring at me." He teased and Molly just shook her head.
"I see a man who is testing the limits of my control." He purred in his ear, licking it. "I see a man who was very nearly bent over the kitchen table and savagely taken four days ago. A man who is lucky he hasn't been bound, gagged, and tied to this bed
"As am I." Sherlock sighed and set the food down. "It was a fit of childishness and I will be better about it in the future." He met Mycroft's gaze for only a moment. Mycroft sighed softly, Greg meanwhile consented himself to rearranging the fork at his place setting on the table, a smirk toying at the edge of his mouth.
Mycroft was pacing back and forth in the inn where they were staying as they waited for the others to join them. The darkness in his heart was growing stronger and something began to gnaw away at his calm as time passed. He looked up at the sound of horse hooves and threw open the door of the inn, his face falling when he saw Anna.
"Do not
"I know I am no longer alone! I did not expect to need to be in my mind palace for as long as this task required! I also had been informed by him that you would care for him should I be unable to do so and it seems you have not taken to your task very well!" He leaned over their faces almost touching.
"All of it. I woke when Mycroft first opened the door. I'm surprised that I didn't wake when you came in the bathroom." He looked thoughtful for a moment but his attention never left John's face.
"My love, you are not required to do this." Sherlock protested softly, trying to ensure John understood.
Sherlock has come home but how will things fall now that he has his memories back?
“It is a historical fact, nothing more or less.” Sherlock sighed, rolling his eyes in boredom.
The pair left the house, their hands clasped together and got into the carriage. Both excited to get back to England, to their home. They chatted idly as they remained curled together in the interior of the carriage and the forest passed by outside. John began to doze lightly and Sherlock simply smiled and held him allowing the peaceful contentedness of the moment to surround them. Shortly after their departure Lord Moran arrived at the manor house in France.
John shuddered as Mycroft released inside of him and Sherlock's thick seed spilled over their chests. Sherlock pulled him into a kiss, not drinking from him. Instead letting Mycroft finalize their bond completely. John did not go limp between them this time, though  weakness did settle in. Sherlock watched transfixed as Mycroft turned John to face him and tilted his head, offering his neck.
. It's a standard form of..." He launched into his explanation but John cut him off.
Sherlock let himself soften his eyes betraying the change as he silently admitted that John was right. That John was well within his rights to feel as he did, though Sherlock didn't like it. He slowly slid his hands up onto John's trying to loosen John's grip on his shirt. He felt John relax just a little as John tried to accept that Sherlock was trying to change, to accept this new relationship.
"Hamish, it's alright. I promise the story has a happy ending." John whispered and Hamish settled back into his lap. He grabbed John's sleeve.
"Oh that face..." John groaned as Sherlock's eyes fluttered closed, his back arched up splaying his long lean body against that of his brother's as he trembled. "Mycroft... Take him..." John pleaded, pushing up into Sherlock as Mycroft pushed his fingers more deeply inside. Sherlock jolted hard. Mycroft moaned softly against Sherlock's ear, pressing possessive kisses to it before following with sharp bites.
Sherlock found the light switch and flicked it on allowing a dim yellow light to fill the small room of the cottage. This allowed Sherlock and John to both get a good look at the man before them, but their attitudes on the situation were vastly different. Sherlock was still cautious and guarded but it seemed John had released all suspicion of the man before them. Sherlock grabbed the case but he didn't speak because he was actually in a sort of shock. His mind reeling as he took in the vast amount of information before him. The man in front of John was taller and more muscular than John himself, but he had the same sort of military physique and mannerisms. He was older than John but not by more than five years judging by his style of dress. His brown hair was cropped close in a military style hair cut and his green eyes were somewhat dim with exhaustion. He was wearing well made trousers, a dark blue shirt, and a dark blue jacket similar to the one that John often wore. His watch was high end, he had a single gold ring on his right hand, and only one necklace. It was the same one that Jared Pendergrass had been wearing, a snake shaped like an infinity symbol devouring its own tail. John didn't seem to be analyzing anything as he took the case, plopped it down, and hastily extracted his medical kit. He was in full doctor mode as he started triage for Jacob.
"Are you feeling alright?" His voice was so soft, so lost in this sea of emotion.
"I don't think I knew the truth anymore." John admitted honestly.
"You would do well to remember your place." He ordered darkly.
"Everything is bright and loud, except for you." John whispered, his hand gently coming to rest on Mycroft's cheek, his actions somewhat child like.
“Well if we are to remain indoors, what better way to pass the time?” Sherlock groaned as John easily took control over him.
Mrs. Hudson looked up at Sherlock as he finally broke his eyes away from John and turned to look out to window for a moment. She began fiddling with the blankets; trying to be sure John was comfortably covered before settling back down into her set. He began pacing the length of the room just in front of the bed. Lestrade perched himself on the wide window ledge, watching Sherlock closely. It was clear Lestrade wasn't leaving until he felt for sure John was still safe. He watched Sherlock move, knowing the wheels were turning in his head.
“No you have not! You refuse to let me go visit my home. I am not allowed to write to my brother without you seeing it. You keep me in a gilded cage!” He shouted, anger flaming in his eyes.
“Do not rush me Sherlock,” He growled as he admired the form of his lover, “I have not had you in nearly an age and I will take my time.” His voice was dark, possessive, and it was driving Sherlock beyond reason.
"Oh, John!" Lestrade said suddenly, turning to look at him. "How are you feeling?" He moved into the kitchen. Sherlock dropped into John's chair, throwing his legs over the arms and continuing to flick through his book, continuing to appear busy.
“Sherlock is the one who kept you from me on your return! I had no other choice!” Mycroft countered, his voice cold and dark.
"Oh yes. You two have been hiding lust for each other for much longer than I have been privileged to see it. I was glad to know you had become so comfortable with your own body to explore his." John promised as he slowly began to tug down Sherlock's trousers.
"Well little Prince, it all began many years ago..." Sherlock began softly, smiling.
"Why couldn't he have been happy with the children he had?" The tears fell as John leaned back into Sherlock's embrace letting the warmth of his arms shield him as he dissolved under the weight of the darkness around them, shaking sobs wracking his body.
"There is nothing to be rational about!" He yelled, quite loudly. Most of his anger was at himself, but he channeled it into his words and actions. He was angry with himself for almost giving into the normalcy he desperately craved without seeing the warning signs. "You were dead. All of sudden you're not! You were disconnected and then I find out you made Mycroft come to see me! You're acting like everything is fine and trying to use my desperation to have you back to hide something! After everything!" His grip on the front of Sherlock's shirt was so tight, there was no way Sherlock could get away. His knuckles digging slightly into Sherlock's chest, amplifying the various feelings Sherlock was having. John's face was so full of the anger Sherlock had expected yesterday but now today it hurt. He'd let himself believe it didn't exist. But now it was also laced with something far darker, with something that made Sherlock ache inside in a way he'd never wanted to feel. Betrayal. It screamed,
? "So I've decided to go all in, as they say, and ask you the second most important question I think I will ever ask you." His voice was soft, full of the vulnerable emotion that he only let John see. Full of fear of rejection and yet a glimmer of hope. Their eyes searched each other's as they both analyzed every movement, breath, and word. "Will you marry me?" Sherlock handed John the box and watched as he opened it, the candle light glinting off the silver titanium ring. "It's likely to be very inconvenient." The ring held three small diamonds in the band.
John and Sherlock return to Baker Street where John finally demands that Sherlock stop holding back.
"What?" Sherlock slowly lowered the paper, smirking broadly.
"It's alright Sherlock," Lestrade whispered putting his hand on Sherlock's back to get his attention. "These are
“John?!” She exclaimed before coming to his side. He could not speak and for a long time she simply sat there, holding him as he shook.
"But Uncle..." He started to protest. John and Greg both laughed as Mycroft softened some.
"He used the apothecary to poison her." John interrupted, growling as he stood up. "Elizabeth came to us just over a month ago saying she feared for the life of both herself and her child. She begged me to come and aid her and I ensured her I would, however I believed that she would be able to sway Lord Moriarty to allow it. The apothecary has made this herbal blend and it contains an herb known by all of the women of our world to induce a baby's arrival. It has been used often times to draw out a baby who does not wish to come. I believe the amount he was giving her has been increasing over time due to its’ lack of effect. Though he knew not that her normal eating habits were keeping the herb from reaching the child in large quantities. I believe he spoke to the apothecary on his return to find her still alive and thus a decision was made to restrict her intake of food and thus allow the poison to work. He has done this with intention and care to gain access to your title, wealth, and power via the life of my cousin.” John’s tone was tight, his words snapped free in anger as he spit them out. Sherlock stared at him in awe, too impressed to say more of what was on his mind.
"You didn't fail John,"
"We'll be back as soon as we can. We won't be leaving the grounds but we're covering quite a bit. We've got our cells. Hamish is napping upstairs."
"What about Kevin, the other murder?" John asked suddenly, his addled brain struggling to keep up.
"No," John snorted. "It's fine. I don't know why I would have..." He was gearing up to explode. Sherlock saw how his features tightened, how his body seemed to quake with the emotion pouring through him. He moved quickly to his side, one hand cradling John's chin. The effect drew John's glance to his own and he felt John's breath hitch in his chest.
"Oh." Mycroft said softly, looking a bit taken aback. "Is that..."
“John, I implore you, please come with us tomorrow. We may be able to stop this wedding.” Mycroft’s voice was soft, pleading. “I know you do not feel there is much hope however Gregory’s plan…” He flinched when John sharply cut him off.
Mycroft pressed his mouth to the mender's desperate lips, wrapping him in his arms, as he caressed and teased every part of him he could reach. Sherlock shuddered finally feeling his body come relax as it backed away from the over sensitized edge of arousal, his attention focused on watching his brother and his lover. John shouted as Mycroft's fingers slipped inside of him, working and stretching the quivering, burning muscle. Neither had seen Mycroft reach for the oil nor had the mender been prepared for the sudden pressure but he arched into it and whimpered. Mycroft for his part worked slowly, teasingly, as he watched the mender writhe and press down onto his fingers.
"No, he toyed with you. You were nothing more than a pawn, just like
“My love, I fear for you and your tender feelings. Those flighty things that you both desperately adore and abjectly hate all at once. There is once again darkness trying to overwhelm us and I fear it is stronger than we have faced before. My nightmares are of losing you, of facing long dark years apart.” His voice cracked slightly and he looked away, unable to bear Sherlock’s intense gaze at the moment. “There is pain coming we cannot possibly prepare for.”
"Sherlock!" John's tone was warning, he found the oil they kept beside the bed and coated his fingers, slipping two inside Sherlock and gently toying with him. He kept pressure firm and even on Sherlock's pulsing member, not letting him move to create the friction that would allow him release. Sherlock groaned and thrashed until John coated his own length with oil and sank deep inside of him.
"It's exactly like he said. She believes herself to be the John to Moriarty's Sherlock. She thought he loved her, I'm guessing he played it along wanting to have someone he could use. She was already there on the edge of all the reporter groups that came along wherever we went. I think that she thinks she is more than she actually is. But she's well hidden, there is no way to draw out this game than to play. It's a game of chess that started years ago." John said it meaningfully and was rewarded with just a slight flush of color on Sherlock's cheeks.
"You never have to apologize to me, John. I let you down. I always do and yet you always take me back. You accept me for the flawed human being I am and it makes you happy to do so. You even wanted to start a family with me, of all people. I was the one at fault, that's why I asked you to come to Mycroft's for that weekend. Because I needed you back. I need you, I always have and I always will."
"I love you too," Sherlock softly replied.
"Pay it no mind, he's always like that," Mike said apologetically.
"Thanks babe." He wiped his face and threw them in the trash can. "Jesus, I'm a fucking mess."
"Trying to scare my Jimmy away brother mine?" Eurus' voice frostily rang from behind.
"Bollocks John. Sherlock adores you more than anything in this world, and he would most definitely love you doing a photo shoot just for him. It would definitely stroke that big ego of his," Sally cut in. She looked pointedly at John.
"Wonderful. And I'm assuming you're all heading to the beach now? It's a splendid day for it, now with those storms moved off the coast."
"You don't need to do anything except love my son."
Sherlock smiled like a Cheshire cat. Your haircut, your stance, and the way you spoke to that man about his prescription. I couldn't help overhear your tone."
Harold frowned again. "Where's Lucy?"
The alpha chuckled. "Beat the world record did I?"
, and casually followed her brother inside.
Jim waited for a few seconds. He didn't hear anything, so he pressed a kiss to Eurus' lips and started back up.
Wanda made him sleep in her bed after he gave his statement to Dave Morstan. She went to John’s room and saw the crumpled sheets, knowing what had taken place in them, her face getting hot with anger. She would pay a visit to Sherlock’s parents tomorrow. She had their address. Lucky Sherlock gave it to John when he tried to seduce him. How surprised he would be when the Watson he wasn’t expecting would show up at his house instead.
Mycroft sighed loudly and shook his head. How could he get his stubborn younger sibling to realize a drug-fueled orgy with twin brothers was not healthy behavior?
With the holidays coming up I'm going to take a short hiatus and resume the story after Christmas. Happy Holidays!
"I can."
John followed her, and was instantly hit with sunlight streaming from the lobby windows. The rest of his co-workers were either seated or standing. He sat down in one of the empty reception chairs, and sent a text to Sherlock letting him know what happened, and not to worry.
John looked at Greg. “Take care of Molly please? If Mycroft comes near her again…”
A short time later, Officer Morstan, Robert, and Angelo returned, announcing the all clear. Everyone felt much better, and things went back to normal.
he wants. I don't think he'll stop pursuing John, but I think he'll be more careful and stealthy about it."
"Shh," Sherlock whispered. "It's not your fault." He moved to sit beside John, who leaned into his chest, resting his head just beneath Sherlock's shoulder. "God, this is such a nightmare," John said.
John rolled his eyes. "Uh, do you remember what happened in this room two weeks ago?"
"Sherlock can be so unpredictable, yet predictable at the same time. That's one of the things I love about him."
Suddenly the taller boy lunged forward and yanked the hose out of John’s hand. Before he could protest, Sherlock wrapped his arms around the blond tightly. He leaned down and pressed his forehead against John’s. “You’re bisexual,” he nearly whispered.
"Haven't you and that brother of yours done enough to terrorize our children? John had to leave town because of what he tried to do to him!"
"I know, but she has the right to come here just like everyone else," Mary ruefully pointed out.
"I know I want to be in your life." Sherlock sat up and pulled the blankets off his legs, and moved so he was sitting on the edge of the bed facing John. He reached out and caressed John's cheek with his thumb. John shivered at the touch and Sherlock smiled. "You bring me all of these new feelings. Whenever I see you I start to get warm inside. Nobody makes me feel the way you do. That's why I've reacted so strongly."
Lucy sighed and sat down on the edge of the bed. Harold noticed the look on her face, and frowned. "Something else bad happened, didn't it."
*****
John was silent for a few moments as he processed Sherlock's words. He pictured him in a beekeeper's suit, talking to the bees, scooping honey out of a jar with his finger and putting the sweet amber liquid to his full, plush lips...
"You too Captain," Bryan said with a wink.
Sherlock hummed and smiled. "Just the two of us, literally. How we wanted it."
"Of course. I wouldn't expect you to keep this quiet. You're probably recording it."
"I prefer to compare us to Romeo and Juliet," Sherlock replied.
He smiled sheepishly. “Hi Mrs. Hooper. Is Molly home?”
Sherlock nodded. "I'll be here." He watched John leave, obviously not trying to stare at his pert behind.
Soon John was sitting at a small round table in the bar, having ordered a bourbon, and an appetizer of shrimp cocktail. He figured the small meal would tide him over until breakfast tomorrow.
Janine knew what happened to John after Molly told her when she arrived at the house. "At least John is with his sister and brother-in-law. But he's tough. That Holmes creep will take the hint. Sebastian Wilkes did."
Sherlock was lying on his bed, perusing his chemistry textbook. It wasn't that well-written, but he figured he'd be a good boy and try to get a few chapters read before school started tomorrow. Since John was out visiting his boss in Gatiss, he wouldn't see him until tomorrow, but John promised to call him later tonight and tell him how things went.
John just laughed as he ran to catch up with his taller love, having thoroughly enjoyed this wet, but happy Halloween night.
"Oh yeah." Victor leaned in, and pressed a soft kiss to John's lips. Once they parted, John sighed and smiled. "That was lovely."
On the feet were expensive Italian loafers, polished to the ultimate shine.

He cleared his throat. "It's a long, somewhat sad story, but I'll give you the Cliff Notes version. He was a DJ at uni before graduating. He worked at your basic doctor's office, then went to St. Bart's A&E. He decided he wanted to enlist in the Army. He fought in the Dhofar Rebellion and was shot, honorably discharged last year. He couldn't go back to surgical work. He got back into deejaying and decided to make it a full time career. I hired him before Christmas. He's been a big hit with everyone here. He goes by "The Captain."
"Was Harold Saxon able to identify him as the one who attacked him?" Billy asked.
******
The man was about John's height, but much stockier in build. He had a strawberry blond crewcut, and John could tell he was furious. Maybe it was a lover's quarrel, he thought to himself.
"Yes Lucy," Dave replied, sitting down in the other seat next to her husband. "The doctor said I could question you Harold, as long as I kept it brief."
John stood there outside the Roller-Rama, eyes closed, letting the evening California breeze wash over him. Now relaxed and with fresh air back in his lungs, he was ready to go back inside and skate some more. But then his relaxed feeling disappeared. He could feel someone standing next to him and they weren’t making a sound. Then he smelled tobacco and he wrinkled his nose. He hated the odor of cigarettes.
Sherlock turned red again, and John giggled. "Out of the mouths of babes," he said after he was done.
“That’s what I’ve been trying to tell him,” Greg chimed in.
*****
"Dave, call for you, from Gatiss General, line one," Officer Sholto said as he stood in the doorway of Dave's office at the police station.
He stalked off, nearly missing Mycroft as he went back into the main ballroom. Mycroft glanced at him and sniffed dismissively. The ginger-haired teen met his sister, who was still lying in the lounge chair, her white kitten heeled pumps on the ground beneath her dangling toes. “I see you’ve made another one of your infamous deductions sister mine. What did you say this time?”
Back with an update!
"This has to be arson. Somebody torched that building," Dave said, growing angry.
BAMF Mrs. Hudson appears next chapter!
John threw his head back and roared with laughter. "You can't be serious! Me, hot? I call it a success if I don't show up to work with wrinkled clothes."
John had showered and was in his bedroom, pulling a pair of dark blue jeans out of his closet. These were his "good pair" he wore for certain occasions. On the bed was a short-sleeved blue and white checkered shirt, and a white wifebeater. He had polished his brown loafers to the best of his ability.
"Good afternoon Sherlock. Remember me?" John asked with a coy grin.
Sherlock smiled at his husband and daughter then looked at the box. "Let's meet the newest member of the family," he told them.
John smiled and pressed a kiss to Sherlock's lips. "Sentiment looks good on you love."
Sebastian turned Henry around to face him, and began passionately kissing him. He pushed him into a chair and began removing his clothes. "I'm so glad I found you. Screw Carl and those other dopes. They can go gawk at girls through a window. You're better than any of them," he said, his voice rough and filled with arousal.
"No way Mycroft. You're not going to blame Sherlock's promiscuity or our parents being absent on me. They make their own choices," Eurus shot back.
Sherlock cocked his head and frowned. “Why is that?”
"Hi Victor. Didn't think I'd be seeing you so soon."
The door opened and there was Angelo himself, in a wheelchair, smiling. A nurse was behind him, pushing him inside. "Hey kids," Angelo said.
Greg was now sitting in front of Molly’s house, nerves frazzled, wondering how to approach her. He ran a hand through his brown hair and glanced up at the pretty yellow rancher. Just do it Greg. Either she says yes or no and you move on. Steeling himself, he got out of the car, went to the front door, and rang the doorbell. Moments later, Sylvia Hooper opened the door and smiled at seeing him. “Hello Gregory! What brings you here?”
"Well, I'd figure they would be dull compared to the schools you attended back in England."
Molly laughed. "I'm just full of surprises." She released him and kissed him on the cheek. See you next week!"
." Eurus spat at the last word like it was poison.
Mycroft held out his hand. “I’m Mycroft Holmes. I just moved into the neighborhood.”
"My mom, and a friend."
Ten minutes later, I heard the door open. I moved some distance away so it wouldn't look like I was eavesdropping. It was Doctor Watson. "Sherlock's all wrapped and ready to go. I'm going to get his pain meds, and write a prescription refill."
"You have them all the time John." Sherlock turned on the flashlight on his phone. "Oooooh," he moaned, the bright light shining on his face making him look spooky.
"Okay Mom. I love you."
"And I would have expected you to go by some silly hippie moniker, like River Song or Afternoon Breeze."
A severe wave of nausea crested up in her stomach, and she let out an ungodly cry. "Jeremy, pull over. I'm going to be sick."
"As many as I can, so Sherrinford will know I mean business, and everyone will learn their lesson and start being more tolerant and compassionate." The killer took a deep breath. "I must go now. Remember, you'll never know when or where I'll turn up. No one is safe.
"And you've got your date Friday night with Mr. Auden," John reminded her with a sly grin.
There were only a few students in the room; the sun had come out and warmed things up so many that had a free period were outside.
Sherlock was intrigued, but obeyed his blogger. He took off his Belstaff and his scarf and hung it up on the coat rack. He stepped out of his shoes, and finally feeling more comfortable, headed to the coffee table and took the food out of the bag.
*****
It seemed as if time stood still in Sherrinford. Billy was playing the killer's call to the station, and Officer Dave Morstan was listening intently. The killer had disguised their voice, and he didn't recognize who it was. But now he knew it wasn't a race crime. Someone was playing avenging angel. But who was being avenged, and why? All he knew is that he and the Sherrinford police force had to catch this psycho before someone else ended up dead, and it wasn't going to be easy. Anyone could be on the killer's hit list.
"Of course. That's why I'm calling. I want to warn the lovely citizens of Sherrinford that I'm going to do it again. Nobody will know when, or whom, but it will happen. Remember, no one is safe."
"Christ Sherlock, I feel bad for John with his sibling troubles. I don't know how he tolerates it," Greg said sympathetically.
"That name sounds familiar---wait, she was at that country club dance you chose not to attend. Mummy and Father were talking to her."
"Well, I must bid you goodnight. I'll call again after my next handiwork is complete. Sweet dreams."
Sherlock entered and smiled at his husband. He was happy to see John in a good mood doing what he loved. John had become an excellent fisherman and loved the seafood dinners he prepared.
Sebastian started to grow angry towards his father. He hoped the police would catch him, and he'd pay for his actions. He didn't care if his family were drugged through the mud. He wouldn't be here to witness the stares, listen to the judgments. He and his mother were already in the process of leaving Sherrinford and moving to Berkeley, and Henry would be going with them. Richard had been behind the move. He would stay here and visit them on weekends.  He agreed to it, while at the same time murdering people. He probably wanted them gone so he could continue his killing spree and they'd be none the wiser.
Sherlock blushed and looked away, nodding. "You are essential to me John, both in work and in our married life. It pained me to see you like that."
will tell Mummy and Daddy. You've all the tact of a bull in a china shop," Mycroft retorted.

"Sure doll. We'll go to my house after school. My parents won't be home until later tonight."
Sherlock decided after John came home they were done. John agreed and the two announced their retirement from crime fighting. Sherlock's late uncle Rudy had left his favorite nephew his seaside cottage to him in his will, and the two decided to live there permanently.
The judge turned to face Sherlock and asked him to place the ring on John's finger. Victor retrieved the band from his pocket and handed it to his friend. John held out his hand and exchanged a loving gaze with Sherlock.
"No," Sherlock insisted vehemently, shaking his head. "You are definitely not ordinary, definitely not boring, and something did happen to you."
"I thought I was like that, and then I met you," Henry noted.
The two walked down the short hallway towards Dave's office. It was fairly quiet, most of the rooms were empty.
"10-4 sir."
Just then, a petite blond waitress with Mary on her name tag delivered their food; a chili dog, fries, and cherry cola for John, and a grilled cheese sandwich and chocolate shake for Sherlock. John tore into his meal with gusto, while Sherlock spent most of the time drinking his shake. Every now and then John would gaze up at Sherlock and smile, which set Sherlock's stomach fluttering like a butterfly. But was John gay like him, or just wanting a platonic friendship? Homosexuality wasn't technically illegal but definitely frowned upon. It was something Sherlock couldn't deduce. If this wasn't going to be a romance, it was fine with him. He could use another good friend.
He sighed happily and lay back on the pillows. Today was his last day as a single man. Tomorrow, Valentine's Day, he and John would be married and embarking on a new chapter of their lives.
Greg was puzzled. "Okay, so why do you want to know more about him...oh wait a minute!" Greg chuckled. "You think he's attractive. Makes sense. You always did have a thing for short blond blokes---"
Sherlock nodded. "You ever been to the shop on the corner? They always have fresh hot drinks."
, along with his other titles,
"Oh, if you could see yourselves!" Mary sputtered in between laughs. "You're hysterical!"
"Come down here," Greg said, grinning.
John laughed and raised his glass. "Here here. And let's toast you and Molly. I'm glad you finally got together." The two men clinked glasses and took a big swig of beer. "Fuck that's good," John said. "Been a while."
Eurus was in the kitchen, happily munching on an English muffin, leaning against the countertop as she talked into the phone. "Hi Jimmy. My parents are gone, they went to Los Angeles to chase after Sherlock....my brother is obsessed with that
John grinned back and got in the car. "You know my name, so how about you tell me yours."
"Morning love. I'm just popping off to the loo but I'll be back," John replied, getting out of bed.
*****
"You know, you look familiar," the girl spoke to John. "Have I seen you here before?"
"Yes," Veronica replied. "Sidney and I wanted to put the children in Cumberbatch Academy but they insisted on attending public school, especially Sherlock and Eurus. I think the environment will be good for them. Maybe it'll make them normal." She lowered her eyes, and Sidney put her arm around her.
But John didn't move. Not until a strong ocean breeze sliced through the dunes and startled Sherlock enough to break off the kiss. John finally took a step back and gazed up at the other boy. His eyes had turned a darker shade of blue, and his face had deepened into a pretty shade of peach. Sherlock had a dreamy expression on his face and reached out to tenderly stroke John's cheek again. "There's something special about you John. I think you can keep me right. Can we start over again?"
Molly's voice trailed off. She'd never said anything about getting a ride with Mycroft Holmes. She'd have to admit it. "Then I caught a ride back home...with Mycroft."
A new week was here, and John's Monday was going to be a busy one. He'd dropped off Evie at daycare, and after breakfast the bulk of the morning was spent reviewing his bookings and confirming appointments. He also responded to a text from his new friend Raquel, inviting him to lunch with her and her husband Luke. They all were free on Friday afternoon, and plans were set to meet at a coffee shop not far from the lab where John used to work. Raquel explained her husband was not comfortable in upscale restaurants, and the coffee shop was a favorite of his. John was fine with that. His bank account may have gotten larger but that didn't mean four star meals at four star prices all the time.
Sherlock grinned. This was going to be easier than he thought.
"So is staying home, because that's what you'll be doing if you don't get something in that ritzy stomach of yours."
(See the end of the chapter for
Becky longed to watch the encounter between the two teenage boys, but her older brother Mark decided it was a good time to spoil things and walk out on the porch. “Come on Becky, get inside, Mom needs you to help her with dinner.”
"Whatever it is, you'll be hot wearing it."
John snorted. "Don't push your luck Holmes. You're lucky to get cute today."
Irene was a sultry sight in a black leather bustier paired with a tight fitting, black lace trumpet skirt. She wore a black velvet choker around her slim neck, adorned with a large sparkling diamond that radiated light from all directions. Her dark hair was pulled up in an updo, the top loose and curly, with a few tendrils hanging down on the sides of her face. Her lips were bright red, and her eyes were lined in a sexy cat eye.
"Hi Mrs. Holmes. Is Sherlock there?"
Molly Hooper rolled her eyes as she heard the catcalls and whistles from the greaser gang, The Hell Hounds, as she skated up to where they were parked to take their orders. "Okay you goons, cut it out. What do you want to eat?"
"I'm Clarence Winstead."
The nurses had given Sherlock a comfortable recliner to sit in as he stayed with John in his hospital room. He had been there all night, and now it was dawn. Rain could be heard softly hitting the window next to John's bed. The doctor was sleeping soundly, and some color had come back to his face.
Owen also moved to England to put distance between he and his family, who were not thrilled with his homosexuality but tolerated it as long as he showed an interest in the family business. Owen had a younger sister, Emma, who was nineteen, and the spoiled favorite child. He and John had something in common, disapproving parents, and the two talked about their families when John wasn't in his military uniform dominating the other man.
Sherlock noticed the card and wrapped box as soon as he got out of the shower. Intrigued, he quickly dried himself off and wrapped his dressing gown around him, sitting down to open the card. He chuckled at seeing a drawing of a hive surrounded by bees and flowers, with the saying "You're the Bees Knees circling the hive. Inside, was a message from John.
"John?"
Thank you. That's very kind of you to say.
"John, I think you deserve something special for your suggestion," Mike declared. How about we all hit Speedy's for ice cream? I'll treat John."
Despite not much conversation going on, everyone was relieved their boss and co-worker were alive, and would recover from their injuries. Then there was the added bad news of Sherrinford Community Church being possibly torched by the killer. The church had been there since the 1916 and to see it destroyed in the blink of an eye was devastating.
This is a pretty dark chapter. You can thank The Hollow Crown for that, as I was writing it while watching Benedict be the creepy, scary, shouty hunchback king.
John went in, grabbed one that was hanging on a small towel rack by the sink, wet it, and returned, handing it to Warren. "Thanks mate." He began to wash himself off.
Sherlock stepped closer again. “I’ll go, if that’s what you want.”
John kissed him again and began to jog towards the track. The train slowly pulled in, and John turned around and waved at Sherlock one last time before boarding.
"Not much. Said he was a businessman, and his work took him out of the office and out of town a lot. He said he was married and had a son, but he really didn't talk about them, only that the marriage was a good one and things were settling down with his son."
"Oh Sherlock, I'm so happy. See? You two are fated to be together. He read your mind," Molly replied, grinning from ear to ear.
"I'm so happy John. We found adopters for all the kittens and their mom. This little family has been so popular online and captured a lot of hearts. And just in time, because Monday we're getting a new momcat, vet says she's carrying four to five kittens, so we've got extra time to care for her," Chris said.
Bryan sat back in his chair. “I actually met Zach Quinn months before he attacked Sebastian. He was a real piece of work. Arrogant, sexually aggressive, thought he was God’s gift to men.” He suddenly looked at Evie. “John, if we can have this conversation later, I mean, might not be good with the baby here…”
As the boys continued to make plans and tease each other, Susan Powers stood at the top of the basement stairs, listening to everything, and a devilish gleam flashed in her eyes. Smirking, she left and headed towards the phone in the kitchen.
"Excellent plan John." Sherlock pressed a kiss to his blogger's cheek. He wrapped an arm around John and the two began to walk back to the flat. Sherlock turned to take one last look at the frozen angels, and he frowned. "John?"
The detective followed John's voice and saw him standing with a big grin on his face. Then he saw the pink box and his heart started to flutter. "You've been to---"
"The worst part is over, now we can relax," Sherlock replied, nuzzling John's neck. "I love you."
*****
Henry peered straight into Richard's icy eyes, struggling to remain calm and casual. He was still in disbelief that this unassuming man, so gentle and kind to him, who'd given him a home, taken care of him, got him everything he'd ever want or need, was a psychotic killer who'd brutally struck down so many people, and had burnt down beloved buildings. If he went to the police and told them everything he knew, he'd be out on the street again, with no one to love or take care of him. Life as he knew it would be a hellhole, like it was before he met Sebastian. He was sure his boyfriend and his mother---Richard's wife---would never forgive him for turning Richard in.
"I would too. Rosie makes a mean chicken parm," John added. He looked at his watch and sighed. "I hate to end this amazing day, but I'll have to leave to catch the train back home. Sophie, Theo, thank you for welcoming me into your home and making all this great food."
John decided to take a dip in the sea. He took off his shirt and threw it in his tote bag along with his sunglasses. He headed for the shore, silently reminding himself to put suntan lotion on his chest and face after drying off from his swim. A big wave had crested, and the water coming in flowed over John's feet. He winced a little at the coolness of it, but kept going in until he was waist deep, then dived under, instantly getting refreshed by the cool saltwater.  John reveled in the fact he'd be here all summer to enjoy it, before going back to London in September and starting his job as a physician's assistant. His friend Mike Stamford, a fellow med school graduate, had secured employment for them both thanks to his uncle, who had a thriving practice in the city. The two were planning to move into a flat together.
*****
His daughter Mary told him how he and his friends crashed Janine Hawkins' slumber party with the attention of getting a thrill seeing the girls in their nightgowns or possibly naked, but they had forced him and his friends to wear nightgowns too and were invited to join them. Everyone said they had a good time, and Carl didn't make advances to any of the girls. So something else must have spurred his murder.
Owen nodded again, no sound escaping from his mouth.
"Sherlock?" Molly spoke. "You okay?"
Right after the movie ended the power went out. Unfazed, the two went to bed, oil lamps lighting their peaceful slumber as the storm finally dwindled away to quiet light rain.
The waitress came over and took another order for pints for both men. Greg finished all but a few chips. "Now I know why I don't eat chips all the time." He patted his stomach and let out a small burp.
The guy still got the money though, her mother paid him off, and the two moved to Sherrinford. Nancy remarried a wonderful man that ran a successful real-estate company, and eventually the two moved on. But for Gloria, the painful memories lingered just below the surface, and when her son Sebastian came out to her and his father when he was sixteen, she decided she wasn't going to have him suffer the same shame and isolation her father did. So she let Sebastian openly have his relationships. And now that he had Henry, and had settled down for the most part, it wasn't her place to take all of that away from him. The rest of the town could look down on her, but she was doing what she had to do for her family. She wasn't going to be a hypocrite, everyone else be damned. Still, she was terrified that a murderer was on the loose, and she wanted to keep her family safe. She may have been at odds with many in Sherrinford, but no one deserved to be brutally killed.
*****
"Sherlock, that was some meal. Your kids can really cook. And the honey---it was absolutely amazing," John said appreciatively, patting his full stomach as the two sat outside in the back garden, soaking up the sunshine."
John laid his head up against Sherlock's chin. "The only things I wanted to do were to join the rugby team and major in medicine. I wasn't interested in the social scene either. But if it wasn't for Molly insisting I attend that mixer I probably would have never met you. Best night of my life."
*****
The boys enjoy a getaway to the beach.
“I agree Greg. We don’t want to rouse suspicion.”
Officer Sholto nodded. "Billy Wiggins called me from his shift at the radio station. The killer called into his show and claimed to have set the fire. Apparently he's pissed off that Mr. Capaldi and Mrs. Hudson survived, and that he torched the church to punish the town hypocrites, his words.  He also said next time there won't be any survivors."
“John may be there tonight as well, I know you’re itching to go too. Plus, a few cheeseburgers might do you good, you’re so thin someone could get a paper cut from hugging you, that is, if anyone actually wanted to touch you. Haven’t had much luck since we came to the land of opportunity, have you brother mine?”
, John thought. "We have a blue and white check long sleeve button down that I think he will like. May I show it to you?"
"Bathroom's off to the right," Warren said.
John got up Sherlock moved to make room for his blogger. John lay next to Sherlock, who wrapped an arm around him. The two soon fell asleep.
Molly wasn't stupid. She knew why they were there. They were best buddies of the late Carl Powers, and they also had a reputation of being "tough guys." Well, they weren't going to push her around. But she was going to stay silent first.
Shirley Lestrade was going through her checklist for this afternoon's Labor Day cookout. She and her husband Robert decided they were still having it. They weren't going to let the psychopath on the loose ruin their plans. They needed to be as normal as possible, and Greg would have been disappointed if it had been cancelled. Besides, it was good to have all of Greg's friends around and together, and not home or somewhere else where they could be more vulnerable. It was still hard to believe Phillip Anderson and Sally Donovan had been so brutally killed and she would no longer see the couple around town, holding hands and saying hello to Sally when she spotted her working downtown at Ventham's Pharmacy.
"Hello Ms. Adler. This is John Watson."
"Then cheers to new beginnings," Sherlock replied, and, the two clinked glasses.
"Yes?" a cultured female voice called out.
Dave Morstan sighed and pulled at his blond hair stressfully as he listened to the recording of another threatening phone call made by the killer. The creep certainly had a busy weekend.
"We are gathered here today to witness the wedding ceremony of Sherlock Holmes and John Watson. They will now exchange vows and rings to further cement their already strong union as a bonded Alpha and Omega pair."
John pushed the injured robber to the ground, who looked up in him with agony. The other would-be robber looked at John with a mixture of surprise and fright. "Come on Jamie, let's go. I don't want any broken bones for Christmas." He helped his friend get to his feet and the two ran off into the night.
*****
A year later, the two were married in a small but quaint ceremony at the local chapel. John continued to work at the clinic and Mary got a job at a rest home. The two settled into married life and things were great. Then two years later, Mary gave birth to Evelyn Rose Watson, Evie for short. Evie was an adorable little girl with her parents blond hair and her father's dark blue eyes.
The Sherrinford Community Center was bustling with activity. The sock hop meeting had gone extremely well, and some of the women were sorting through boxes of decorations. It had been decided to do a red, black, and white color theme. Black musical notes would be hung from the ceiling, along with red and white balloons with matching streamers. Sylvia Hooper found some red and black tulle to wrap around the poles fixed from the ceiling to the floor.
"Do you think it's wise to proposition me while you're in a sexual relationship with one of your co-workers? Billy, isn't it?"
John barked out a laugh. "I haven't even told you anything about me, other than I'm a gamma."
"Okay, okay, we're going! Hold your horses!" John gently scolded.
Wanda was in her bedroom, getting ready for her dinner date with Hal Auden, who was picking her up at five-thirty. They would be going downtown to Leonard's Restaurant, and then to Speedy's for ice cream.
_____
John awoke to Sherlock laying next to him. He stretched and yawned, discovering how dry and sore his mouth was. Before he could ask for some water, Sherlock smiled and reached over to pick up a glass of ice water sitting on a tray, next to a plate of yellow colored cake. "Here, take a nice long sip," Sherlock murmured. I figured you'd rather have the water than hot tea."
With the casting of Jodie Whittaker as the new Doctor, I wanted to use her name. But since women weren't fire chiefs back in the 60's, I had to make the character a man, and used the common male spelling of the name.
Sherlock leaned in for a kiss. When the two parted, they each leaned back in their chair. John sighed contently. "I think I'm going to be spending a lot of time on this porch, especially if it rains, taking in that clean, comforting scent of petrichor. It's just the best. But not as the best as being married to you." He leaned over and kissed Sherlock gently. "Come on you, let's get inside and get some lunch. How does chicken casear salad and iced tea sound?"
"Only a human heart and some hands. Not as bad as the head he brought home last month. As a doctor, you'd think I'd be averse to it, but it's off putting when you open the door looking for something to eat and this dead white face is staring back at you, silently judging you for invading his privacy."
Sherlock nodded. He liked that idea. There would be less pressure for him to say and be more romantic. He was pants at romance, well, what other people would consider romance.
"Oh Johnny, he says that to all the ladies. He's a big flirt."
"Going to the beach."
Eurus and Sherrinford broke out into giggles. John smiled and gently took Sherlock's hand. "Yeah, I guess it is."
"I'm going for a walk. It's a nice afternoon, and I've done all my homework."
"Can you also pick up some coffee? We're out," Wanda asked.
Sherlock placed a hand on John's forehead. Still fever free, thank goodness. He tenderly brushed back some blond hair that was falling over his eyelashes. "Come on John. Wake up, take your medicine, and then you can go back to sleep," he gently urged.
John and Sherlock watched everything go down. John shook his head, feeling a little sad for the man who was obviously disturbed.
Dave opened up the door and saw Harold, sitting up in bed, reading a magazine. His wife Lucy was sitting next to him, knitting. Both Saxons looked up and smiled happily when they saw Dave.
"John, no." Sherlock knelt in front of him and squeezed his shoulders affectionately. "Don't blame yourself for this psychopath's actions. He's the one choosing to kill and set fires and make threats."
“Key-wran, not see-ar-an,” Sherlock soberly replied.
John shook his head, his anger dissipating. He chuckled softly. "Detention huh? What'd you do, deduce one of the teachers and they didn't like what you had to say?"
Wanda almost cried at her son's response. He was too young to be dealing with this. She placed her hand on top of his. "Johnny, we'll be okay. We'll just have to abide by the curfew and be aware of our surroundings."
Ms. Divine hoped the death would be ruled natural causes with a little help from her prophecy so no one would suspect it was actually cold-blooded murder.
"Mummy and Daddy let us read anything we want. They say when it comes to books we shouldn't be limited to subject matter," the girl spoke up.
Doctor Watson was in disbelief. "Me? Nah, I'm just a poor doctor-in-training living in a crappy bedsit."
Sherlock deduced the assailant was a middle-aged white male, in good physical condition. He was also extremely religious, and maybe a vicar, or involved with the church in some capacity. Clearly the beatings were to send a message to women visiting the discos alone, this person did not approve of them going out and partying, actually trying to beat them into submission. The attacker was married, with a submissive wife who he could easily dominate, so he felt all women should stay at home and be wives and mothers. His appearance would not attract attention, and no one would approach him if he were to be at a disco.
John hung up the phone and went into the living room. "I'm ready!" he sang out.
Greg was driving down Benedict Road, his car radio playing Buddy Holly but he wasn’t paying attention to the music. His mind was still on his visit to Irene Adler that morning before church. He had confronted her about her cheating on him. At first she denied it but eventually she admitted she had been unfaithful.
"Yeah? Well you keep watching those movies." He leaned in and kissed her again.
"You too." Molly watched her skate away and she realized she had it pretty good as a sixteen year-old. Where would she be at Ella's age? Twenty-two wasn't that far off.
"Have any plans for today?" Sherlock moved closer.
The bee pin:
"Hello Irene, Molly," Sherlock replied, trying to sound haughty.
The door opened, and the lady herself appeared. "Hello you two. It's been a shitty night for customers. I'm going to let you go home."
"I wanted to make it work Mike, for Rosie. I felt so strongly about having a mother figure in her life. Eventually, it wasn't going to be that way. She cared more about social status than wanting to be a wife and a mother. I didn't mind that she didn't want to work, but when I found out she was dropping Rosie off at this friend's house and that friend's house in order to spend money we didn't have, and then she started seeing that plastic surgeon on the side...I knew I had to end the marriage, not for my mental and emotional health, but Rosie's."
"We have some honey for you to take home," Theo said.
The Big H prepares to reopen; Principal Saxon begins to remember a little more about the night of his attack, more fluff with Sherlock and John.
******
"I know. But Mr. Powers was drunk, I guess he was drinking away his grief, and Carl told him about how I turned down his offer of a ride yesterday after school, and I called him a nosy punk. Apparently he was torn up about that."
“The only other option was Molly. She would have done it, but they wanted someone with an athletic background so a rapport could be built up. And seeing as how I’m the only bonded omega on campus playing a sport right now, it defaulted to me.”
One bedroom was turned into a lab for Sherlock and another served as a guestroom in case Mrs. Hudson or Harry and Clara or Mycroft or Greg wanted to come for an overnight visit.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Who do you have feelings for?" Harry pressed.
He extricated himself from John, who continued to sleep. Sherlock couldn't help but smirk at the fact he'd worn John out to the point of exhaustion. He'd make sure to draw a nice, soothing hot bath for him later.
"Oh, you're far from old and tired. You're a very attractive man. I'm generally partial to brunets like myself, but after my last romance went down the tubes, I decided to stay far away from dark-haired men and try a blond," Warren explained, growing confident.
John perked up. "You'd do that for me Mom?"
Sarah had dressed as a naughty elf, and Janine, like Sally, chose to be a sexy Mrs. Claus, but she went for a little more modesty and wore a red velvet above the knee dress.
"I'm so lucky to have him John. I thought I'd never find a decent guy after all the stupid shit I pulled. Let me tell you, being clean and sober really has its benefits." Harry pulled no punches when it came to talking about her past. While John and his parents were in Sherrinford, Harry had gotten involved with a group of greasers and started dabbling in marijuana and booze. When she was twenty, she nearly overdosed on cocaine at a party and was rushed to the hospital. After being released, she quit cold turkey and moved in with a friend and her family. While going through withdrawal, she met her friend's older brother, Clarence Winstead. Clarence was twenty-seven and working at his uncle's garage. The two fell in love and married that New Year's Eve. It was a quick courtship, but they were enjoying a happy marriage and a good life.
Charlie Magnussen stood up front. He was a tall man with platinum blond hair and icy blue eyes hidden behind glasses. He looked cold and imposing but was actually one of the nicest men you'd ever meet. Pete Hooper had asked him to guide the meeting and he agreed.
"No, and I hope I never see him again. He's a very odd young man."
John's mouth quirked up at that comment, memories of his father pushing
A cheeky smile played at Irene's wine-colored lips. She loved it when Molly took charge. It was a big turn-on, and she was already contemplating a nice, "long lunch" with her lover and business partner.
John nodded. "I'll see you then. Bye Bill!"
...and we have the kiss. Will John give into Sherlock?
"Okay." Henry swallowed, and continued. "It's funny, Richard saying how much he hated those guys, when Sebastian used to...well, you know what he did before we got together."
"No problem Sherlock." Valerie turned to John. "Now don't be stubborn. Take your meds and do what Sherlock tells you to do. He's a smart cookie," she gently chided him.
"Have you had enough?" John asked the struggling man.
Sherlock's funny thought instantly evaporated when he heard the beginning sounds of Bach's Air on G String, expertly played by Mycroft on his violin, and his lips expanded into the widest, most happiest smile he could make, when he saw his beloved walking forward to meet him, also sporting a matching smile.
"I've got plans."
It was mid January, a week after Sherlock's 40th birthday, and six-thirty in the evening. It was also raining steadily, a cold raw rain that sank into bones and irritated old wounds and sore joints. It was the rain John hated the most because it reactivated the ache in his left shoulder, reminding him of when he got shot in Afghanistan. He was so looking forward to his holiday with Sherlock to Florida at the end of the month. Mrs. Hudson had bequeathed them a beach house in Miami that she owned but no longer wanted as it reminded her of her abusive marriage to the late and not great Frank Hudson. Sherlock and John jumped at the chance to have a separate place they could escape to when London got too much, even if it was on another continent. If she had asked the detective and the doctor two years ago, they would have turned her down, but now, after Sherrinford, after Mary, after a baby that turned out not to be John's, they needed a far away retreat more than ever.
