Castiel figured it was enough and he could finally stop torturing Dean, who was being patient but antsy all the same. Watching him closely and asking on occasion. ‘How’s the writing goin’?’ To which Cas would smile and tell him about how the last poem had been about nature or about something that had been on his mind. Dean would respond and nod seemingly satisfied but mostly happy just to chat about something so casual.
... and I remember flashes of you drivin’ me to the hospital mostly keeping those baby blues on the road all while telling me to hang on.” Dean’s voice a whisper now.
Cas knew Dean would eventually say outright what he wanted, the retired life more than just a passing comment but more when and where and Cas would happily be there beside him when he did.
Dean was half way through scrambling the eggs when Cas rolled out of bed still sporting only his boxers and came downstairs.
Cas glided his hands over Baby’s clean exterior, and carefully opened the passenger door, he fiddled with the keys in his right hand.
The music filtered in low as the bass thumped on the road roared beneath them. Cas had his head resting back on the headrest as he watched the passing scenery a blur of colors. Things had been slowing down. Dean had made a few comments about something like retirement and Sam had been laying future plans of his own with Eileen. Big plans for the bunker and future hunters. Dean was proud and supportive but didn’t include himself in their plans.
Dean continued to let his mind wander more than he had dared to in a long while and ended up needing a cold shower.
“Are these for you or a gift?” She asked, holding a small pile of cards. “We put these in for gifts, I drew them myself.” She said presenting small white cards with tiny bees and things like “You’re un-bee-lievable” and other bee puns on them.
Beth came out hands full, in one she was carrying a wicker basket and the other was a small jug containing a yellow and orange liquid.
“M’ going on a milk run, need anything?” Dean said, regretting having asked already. Sam loved to give him a long list of crap.
“I’m adjusting, as you said and I’m a lot better than I expected...thankfully the circumstances are far different than my last human experience.”
“Hmmm.” Dean said, pretending to think about it. “Nah, just enjoy the ride,” Dean said clearly teasing Cas.
Outside Crystallo inn was a fresh blanket of white fallen from the night before gleaming still and quiet in the sun rises gentle glow.
Castiel had three blank pages left. It had only taken him a little over a month and a half to fill the small notebook with doodles and poems some longer than others. He had written only about twenty odd poems and the other pages were filled with doodles and haiku.
Dean closed the small distance between them like the moon’s pull on the tide he pushed unto the shore as Cas pushed back matching the pressure and passionate force.
“You know…. A while back I found one of your poems… you had left it kinda crumpled up back in Illinois, at that one diner ya’ know tight after You and Sammy took out that library ghoul.”
Castiel’s hand slipped up Dean’s shoulder and slowly when his hands stopped and he was cradling Dean’s cheek. Dean leaned into the touch, closing his eyes as his heartbeat began thumping wildly.
Dean planned on coming back for an actual tour of the place next time around but today he had other plans.
“After I’ve finished, you could read it. If that’s something of interest to you.” Cas said, giving a hint of a grin.
It had been left behind a half crumpled coffee-stained napkin, sticking out among the dirty dishes of where the trio had just shared an all American diner of burgers and far too greasy fries.
With each time Dean would catch a glimpse of Castiel writing, early morning or late at night. The pages falling heavily into the right side, less and less pages left to fill.
Dean swiftly packed the grocery’s into baby’s backseat and flipped open his wallet. Thank god he actually had some real cash on him, he didn’t think a magic credit card was on the list of acceptable payment methods.
“You know I love you , I’m so in love with you ... being with you... it’s made me the happiest dude in the world... I don’t know how I got so lucky.” He leaned in.
“Okay, you’re right I’m the one acting weird,” Sam said mockingly as he turned his gaze back to the stack of books he had been hard at work organizing. Dean really wasn’t as sneaky as he thought he was but Sam wouldn’t tease him too much. Cas had already confirmed it without actually saying it outright and then Sam had caught him shuffling out of Dean’s room around four am a few days ago. Not that Sam didn’t know before that, but it was just further confirmation. They shared a knowing nod and Sam swore he heard Cas giggle. Honestly, he didn’t know if he was ready for what awaited him once the cat was out of the bag.
“Listen Cas , we haven’t had one real vacation since we moved , since we got married , since like ever.”
Cas surely needed space, after everything. Especially now only a few short months of humanity, and of Jack's new promotion. Dean had been dancing around the topic. Dying to ask.
It didn’t take the couple long to get all settled into their quarters it was a beautiful spacious room already pre-decorated for the coming holiday tree and lights , stockings the whole nine yards.
They hadn’t talked about it yet. Dean hadn’t said anything close to the words that echoed in his heart, but he’d tried to show it. Make Cas feel it, feel at home.
Castiel emptied his hands and stepped forward into Dean’s orbit. His eyes drifting from Dean’s down to his hands and back up.
Castiel didn’t feel babied in these moments now a days , he appreciated Dean’s careful attention to Cas’ comfort and his protective habits.
With a small beehive at the bottom and three fluffy round bee’s around it. Cas smiled up and Dean before returning to unpacking the bag. The next thing he pulled out were the two stickers. One of another round bee, in the same style and another that read “Jackson Family Apiary, Buzz on by.” At last, he pulled out the brightly colored pen covered in bees and a honeypot as a topper. He rolled the pen around in his hands and broke the silence.
Dean peeked into the kitchen, library, map room and when everything else failed he ended up right in front of his best friends bedroom door.
Dean chuckled. “Yeah that, but the apiary itself isn’t why we’re here, s’ just part of it.” He added proudly.
Dean quickly places the napkin in his coat pocket. Outside, he catches a glimpse of Sam already slipping into the passenger seat before his eyes zero in on Cas. He was still leaning against baby's sleek body, with his hands in his pockets, face tilted to the speckled night sky. The sight makes Dean’s heart skip a short beat.
“Cas, I want to wake up and face the world with you everyday for the rest of my life , will you do me the honor of marrying me?” His eyes stung from holding back his tears. His nerves were playing fucking pong.
“S’ wildflower mead,” Dean explained. “Won’t be getting us drunk or anything, but I figured you’d like it.”
He stood up and glanced around the restaurant and decided to gingerly pick it from the table after a moment’s hesitation. On it, words were scribbled in blue pen. The familiar handwriting he’d seen in the margins of the bunker’s book’s that lay well-loved and piled up, or on a rushed to-do list and scribbled ingredients to find. It's unmistakably Castiel’s handwriting. He’d know it anywhere. Although this note is messier than his usual stroke still it retains the graceful curves when he jots down an S or a C.
It had only been one year since the move to their new home in Lebanon, Kansas it was a quaint little place but it had everything they wanted.
Cas silently pulled Dean into a tight embrace and they wordlessly clutched each other until Dean’s breathing had stopped catching in his throat and tumbling into hearty sobs.
After being married for three years finally Dean Winchester and Castiel Winchester are able to take a long awaited vacation for Christmas after Castiel wins a all expenses paid trip to a small mountain town.
The night was crisp and clear just as the chipper weather person had predicted but Dean knew even if it had been a cloudy evening Castiel would eventually wander out, sometimes before dinner other times it would be before the crack of dawn.. occasionally on quiet nights Dean would hear the soft shuffle of Cas’s feet leaving his room and he’d have the urge to follow but always decided against it.
“Uh Cas you alright?” Dean said watching Cas’ blue eyes burning a hole through his phone screen all slack jawed.
Dean started up the classic car and the rumbling filled his ears, he revved it softly his own excitement bubbling over.
“You can join me anytime… to look at the stars... to talk...” Cas said only looking at Dean as he was the only light in the night.
At first it was soft and unsure but slowly it became a hungry animal devouring its first meal after a long winter.
It was far too early for Dean to be up but something stirred in Dean, something that wouldn’t be easily shaken off with booze or sleep. It was the lingering of his dangerous curiosity. How much did Castiel write nowadays? Were all the poems about these feelings shaken loose by the lack of grace and all that crushing humanity?
A romantic candle lit dinner waited for them and a soft tune played whistling out into the open air.
“It’s almost afternoon but I’ll still accept it, everything alright?” Cas asked, turning from his desk still hand fills of loose paper.
He didn’t want to wake his sleeping angel just yet , he wanted to pack and make coffee and breakfast to go for them as a sweet gesture.
Snow had begun to gather on baby’s sleek body a few miles back , the windshield wipers working overtime , the hot air conditioner cranked up.
Dean didn’t dwell on his brother's teasing, he had a plan and he was going to make sure that it went off without a hitch. He pulled out his phone and called the last number he dialled previously. After only a few moments of ringing, someone picked up.
Cas wasn’t pushing him but he felt Dean’s eyes on him more so than they had been previously and he considered that a feat of its own.
Dean headed to the checkout, humming along to a stupid pop song that was echoing in the store. He was pretty sure he recognized the artist as one Cas liked but couldn’t be too sure. Making a mental note of the lyrics, he surveyed which line seemed to be the shortest. Check out was fast and easy, Dean gathered up the bags in both hands five in total and headed out the automatic doors.
Soon they were out of the car and into the field Cas following close behind Dean into the blooms. “Think here’s good?”
Cas beamed. “Honeybee’s and if we want to get specific I’d have to say apis dorsata, the giant honey bee native to Southeast Asia...as for flowers it’s a daffodil.”
Dean made quick work of grabbing the usual essentials coffee, fresh meat, toothpaste, Cas’ favourite honey and loose leaf tea and last but not least Sam’s extensive list of veggies.
Dean chuckled. He loved this , taking long drives with Cas up into the mountains. Just him and his two babe’s.
This pleasure made it harder for Castiel to control himself , his grace slipping through his control.
They went up to Castiel and Dean favorite not so secret spot that was surrounded by beautiful mountains.
Dean pulled up to the bunker and right away announced he’d be in shortly as he wanted to do a once over on baby since they hit a nasty pothole a few miles back. Sam teased him and Cas nodded, still flashing that small grin of his. Dean watched the two get in safely and out of sight before he slipped his hand into his coat pocket and pulled out the napkin. Carefully he unwrinkled it tracing the blue pen with his fingertips.
“These are for our adopt-a-bee project, it’s fifteen dollars and you get a pen and a few stickers to raise awareness.” She beamed.
“M’ cookin Cas.” Dean said putting down his spatula and turning to his husband his hands finding they’re way up to his face. His thin strumming against the stubble.
The next poem came a few short days later and this time it was much more out in the open, not hidden between burger greased plates and coffee saucers or within scattered notes but right on the kitchen table in the form of a small notebook adorned with delicate poppies and this time the penmanship was even neater than he’d recalled Cas penning before.
Taking him into his arms and holding on for dear life ... like every hug they had shared on earth and purgatory and in between but now there was no invisible wall.. nothing to hold him back from loving him they way he’s wanted to since .....he can’t even remember when the ache began.
“It’s connected, yes,” Billie says. “It’s called traumatic bonding. You feel indebted to him for protecting you. You can’t criticize him. You gave him excuses. You wanted to please him. He was giving you something you desired – companionship and protection – so you thought he deserved to take what he could from you. You were so desperate for the hurt to stop that your brain tricked you into thinking what was happening was okay. Maybe you felt guilty for the way your body responded. So your brain rationalized the situation as something acceptable – something you
“Yeah,” Sam sighs, stress immediately jumping back across his face. Dean regrets asking about it.  Sam presses the heels of his hands into his eyes. “Working late.”
Over the next weeks, in-between looking for hunts, Dean asks Jody if she’d be a job reference for him – in case he ever felt like looking for a job that would provide them with actual money. The credit cards Charlie set up work again, but it might be nice to start laying down legitimate roots.
“The fuck m’I asking for?” Dean grunts, but looks away, immediately and alarmingly self-conscious, because clearly he’s supposed to remember. There’s a disturbing blank spot inside Dean’s head where last night should belong. He thinks he can vaguely recall yesterday morning: an insistent, unsettled feeling in his chest that chased him out of the bunker and – and what? To the nearest bar, clearly. But then what? And why?
Dean isn’t quite sure what will happen if he confesses that it was all a hallucination – but he sure as hell can’t begin to explain that it was real.
He was too high to think about anything feeling wrong. It all just felt comfortable and slow: the rowdiness of the club drifted lazily into the background.
“I wasn’t aware we were preparing for battle,” Cas says drolly. He’s definitely in a better mood this morning than he was last night. He’s also wearing jeans that unfairly show off his nice ass. Dean’s grateful he’s not planning on drinking at the wedding, because it’s hard enough to keep his mind off sex with Cas while sober.
Dean goes cold. Ice drips into his stomach. He remembers the cabin in North Cove. He remembers Kelly’s corpse in the bed upstairs. Mom and Lucifer disappeared in a shower of yellow sparks. And Cas dead. Hole through his chest and echo of his wings burnt into the ground at his shoulders.
Anna’s face flushes. She shuts her eyes. For a minute she sways from toe to heel, and Castiel is afraid she’s going to collapse.
“Good,” Dean says, and he tries to ignore the little bloom of warmth in his stomach. He won’t admit it out loud, but he’ll always feel better if Cas is with them.
“I just – ah – knew you didn’t like kids,” Dean stammers. He never has known when to stop talking. “I didn’t wanna make you…uncomfortable or something.”
There it is. Free-falling and there it is. The ground. Just getting closer. Nothing Sam can do because he’s not wearing a fucking parachute.
“Th-there’s a Benny,” Dean says. He blinks his tears away well enough so he can see his phone screen and thumb in his access code. His fingers shake so hard he has to plug it in twice. “He – I know him from AA.”
He hears the door snap closed on Cas’s way out. It occurs to Dean that he’s not supposed to still be in bed. He needs to be at work. He didn’t call out sick. He’s used more than his share of personal time. Bobby’s too good to him.
“Hiya, Sammy,” Ruby calls lazily from the other side of the chain-link fence that separates the basketball court from the road. She’s lounging on the hood of a parked Hornet that probably belongs to some stuffy suit in the office building across the street. A rope of smoke twirls into the air from the cigarette between her fingers. She’s wearing Audrey Hepburn-type sunglasses and a pair of those shorts that cinch at the waist and show what Dean calls, while running his tongue over his lower lip,
It’s another question Dean doesn’t know how to answer. If he says yes, it means admitting he’s uncomfortable. It means agreeing to talk about something else. But, if he says no, it means he has to talk more about Dad. And he’s not going to talk more about Dad. Unlike Sam, Dean knows that family business is supposed to stay in the fucking family.
Cas presses his lips to Dean’s mouth, so quickly Dean nearly misses it, and it’s the second time this night that Cas has kissed him so casually, and Dean hasn’t really minded it – and then he’s just holding him, chin on his shoulder, arms steady around his waist.
“I’m almost afraid to ask,” Dean says with a tired grin, dumping his emptied thermos into the sink and toeing his boots off. “But what have I done?”
“You worried me,” Cas says finally, like people just say that kind of shit, all gentle and serious, like they really mean something. “I don’t like seeing people I care about in pain.”
Castiel swallows. His throat is very dry. He gestures for the men to come in and take a seat on the sofa. Cas suddenly feels that their apartment is very dirty; there are cracks in the ceiling and faded holes in the carpet. It smells vaguely like mildew and the burnt residue on the stove. Cas takes a seat in an armchair across from them; he tries to look as dignified as possible in his robe.
He’s got Dad’s age-worn leather jacket slung over one shoulder. It’s still too hot to wear it, and the shirt he wore to the dance is stained with sweat under the arms and down the back.
, Famine called him all those years ago. And it’s always been there. That feeling. That gaping nothingness inside of him.
Since this turned into a vow renewal ~ I wanted to show a little of the first one and the original wedding ~ I hope it’s not too rushed but again this took a life of its own ~ I hope it’s okay!
On the drive home, the small napkin weighed heavy in Dean’s mind. He turned to his usual distractions of classic rock and stolen glances of his angel in the soft flash of the rearview mirror.
The second poem was another accidental discovery, it was shorter and penned in the margins of notes from a spell they’d needed for a previous hunt. Dean figured Cas must’ve left it there in his hurry to catch all Sam’s commotion this morning when Sam was scolding Dean for “playing” with an artifact.
They were married on a Thursday’s evening as the sun was just sinking down by Sam who easily got ordained online .
“It’s true, I’m glad you found that.. although I didn’t expect you to,” Cas said, closing his eyes enjoying the sunset on his face.
“I can’t imagine being here with anyone else , not like this.” His eyes welled up the emotions hitting him.
Dean rolled his eyes at the fresh memory of Sam classic bitch face (the likes of which he’d lost count of) before turning his attention back to the more important thing at hand..these short poems that made Dean feel like a lovesick teen.
Dean was grinning as he watched Cas and Max talk and talk about the local flowers and how much they’d been blooming and how the bees were thriving.
They’d been doing this, having small moments of stolen soft kisses and knowing smiles. Movie nights had gotten more than cozy and most of the time they didn’t sleep alone. Somehow, Cas would always end up in Dean’s bed, arms snaked around his chest but, all things considered, they’d been taking it slow. Cas wasn’t about to push the issue, this was more than enough. These moments of comfort and bliss. Spending extra time together in the evenings just to talk and share each other’s space was more than he could ever need.
“Fuck Cas , you’re really out of this damn world.” Dean said his head still spinning from his wild orgasm.
It wasn’t anything special and maybe it was too fast but Dean couldn’t bring himself to waste another second.
Dean flicked through the stations passing the pop music and slower soft rock until settling on what his ears quickly recognized as Kiss.
Castiel spread open his wings as much as he comfortably could creating an umbrella of shimmering black and rainbow hue’s above them.
“It was very thoughtful, I’ll cherish any gift that comes from your heart ...from your mind.” Cas’ hand slipped slightly more up his fingertips brushing Dean’s hairline.
Castiel hummed as he took a sip from his orange mug. Some obnoxious gift shop trinket he had picked up in Tulsa. Dean had rolled his eyes then but now he’d grown fond of seeing it in Cas large hands almost every morning.
“I’ve won a prize , but I don’t think it’s wise to keep it.” Castiel said deflating slightly letting his wings droop down.
They rolled together letting themselves become castaways in this first kiss of roaming hands and whimpers and heavy breaths.
Dean smirks to himself at the mental picture of Castiel, angel of the lord busting into his life all those years ago all electric and bad news and now admiring him over dinner … how much things have changed since his fall, or two from grace.
Dean hummed in anticipation, the rush of Cas’ hands gripping him the weight of Cas’ against his groin. The blood rushing down.
“Since you’ve asked so nicely.” Castiel slid himself into Dean still teasing him with his slow entrance.
“Go ahead and jump in, I’ll go let Sammy know we’re taking off,” Dean said, chucking the keys to Cas in a gentle underhand throw.
“Okay, you can read it now,” Cas said pressing his mouth to Dean’s forehead before rolling himself unto the ground next to him.
“Even when you weren’t around ... it was so hard to imagine going on without you ... living in a world without you in it, it’s not something I ever want to do.” Dean said slowly bending down onto one knee.
Cas blinked at the page and grinned,  he then basked in the smell of coffee in the air and the sight of his already packed bags by the bedroom door.
Cas felt the vibration of his phone and lazily pulled it out from his pocket and shot off a quick text.
Cas gently lulls his head into Dean’s chest melting into the rising and fall of his husbands breathing. He’s hardly watching the old VHS anymore. Cas had watched it a million times over, practically being able to quote the whole thing line for cheesy line.
“So how about we go for a drive then?” Dean beamed, pulling Castiel into his chest. “You’ve got it with you?”
Dean’s mind arrived at how Cas’s eyes flickering to his lips and back to his eyes in a dance Dean had surely taught him while he was unaware. Eyes mouth, deadlock smouldering glare. Dean placed the pages as he found them too afraid he’d find more than he already had.
Cas’ smile was genuine and soft. Dean’s mind was drowning. He didn’t deserve that smile. He broke their eye contact and looked to his feet.
Cas had a small smile stuck to his pink lips all night. The job was done. No one had died, hell they hardly had a scratch on them. It was a good day, a hunt well done. Dean let himself feel a bit of that satisfaction right along Cas.
“If , you promise to actually let me take over driving when you get tried.” Cas said expecting Dean to resist.
While Dean was wrapped up in making dinner (a pot roast which he’d just about perfected) , Cas wandered into the kitchen surely he was following his nose.
“Figured we could eat up before leaving around 6 , whatcha think sunshine?” He said finally turning to meet Cas’ hooded blue eyes still.
“Just you two huh, you and Cas, going out for an unspecified amount of time together ?” Sam grinned.
The week after the flood gates opened they shared their first kiss in a parking lot of a truck stop dinner.
Only a few months ago at a grocery store a young cashier told him about an raffle they were doing for a couples vacation and he never thought anything would come of it but here it was.
“Just the usual, some greens and some more of those protein bars Claire introduced us to.” He smiled fondly.
Dean placed the bag in his pocket and decided to figure the rest out later. He ignored the warm feeling on his cheeks and drove home.
Dean’s fingers rapped rhythmically unto the steering wheel as he began to softly hum out the tune, that too was happening more often. Dean humming and on occasions singing. Castiel found Dean’s voice entirely soothing.
“Got it yesterday morning, a girl was fundraising… I figured it was your kind of thing.” Dean said doing his best not to trip over his words like a girl getting asked to prom.
He was more focused on the comfort of Deans skin against his own, the sensation of his eyes get heavy. He found himself sighing, allowing his wings to softly unfold themselves, draping them against Dean's body like comfort blanket, keeping him safe and warm.
Dean would opt to take a more scenic route for His husband who adored stopping to take photos of the landscape and sky.
Sam had noticed of course how Dean would try to peek or stop what he was doing to linger, and it didn’t take him too long to ask Cas what it was all about.
“Good morning, Dean,” Cas said turning from the counter and passing him as he shuffled back to the table.
Dean found himself drifting closer into Castiel’s space. Only trying to get a closer look at his best friend reaction of course.
The waters ran a chill over his shoulders as he dragged his hands down his face. Castiel… was writing about him about wanting him. Dean’s mind reeled… maybe it was all a big misunderstanding but Dean let himself indulge in the lingering thoughts… Cas’s hands running along his chest and his lips on his skin. Dean gave a pained groan as he shut off the water.
Cas began to hum the song as Dean was now more so mumbling the lyrics. He hadn’t heard the song before but he very much enjoyed his personal serenade.
“Yeah...yeah, lemme ‘ turn this on low,” Dean said, turning the oven down. Roast tasted better if it sat a while anyway.
Cas slid himself down leaving a trail of small licks and nips as he made his way to Dean’s cock, already twitching with anticipation.
“Cas , please stop teasing and fuck me.” He hissed throwing his head back again when Cas hit that sweet spot again.
Dean’s handwriting was sprawled out neatly onto the white page, the blue pen sat beside it on the nightstand table.
They fell back into a routine. A little over a week had passed and Dean didn’t find any more loose poems. He’d only caught a glimpse when Cas would leave his honey-colored notebook open and behind, but that early morning kitchen conversation now kept Dean from reaching for it. He couldn’t read it before it was done. He’d wait like he told Cas he would. The tension built around the small bound notebook.
“Think I’ll take you up on that, I’ll just try not to blubber like ol’ yeller just got put down next time.” Dean’s laughter was quiet.
Castiel sighed but not with discontent. He could tell Dean was excited about this and he settled into the passenger side to do just that. Relax and enjoy this.
Dean bundled up his husband. Wrapping him into a scarf and placing a beanie on his tussled black hair.
“Good.” Dean said satisfied as he watched his naked lover strut to the bathroom following shortly after him.
Soon Dean was done reading and he clutched the notebook tightly to his chest and exhaled deeply. When he inhaled he was met with the floral scents that surrounded them. He moved closer to Cas and rested his head on his shoulder.
“I love you Castiel and I was going to wait to do this until after Christmas cuz’ I didn’t want to be too cheesy... but I could really care less ... this just feels right.” He laughed at himself softly a single chuckle.
in the whole world had admitted his love for him in front of everyone with what could’ve been his dying breath.
They lost themselves in the moment , letting themselves get completely absorbed into the rhythm of their thrust of their breathing of the sweat dripping from their skin.
Cas felt a small buzz and lightness since they had just finished off the jug of mead. The soft breeze is cool against his slightly flushed cheeks.
No more beating around the bush, Dean was going to grow up and just give Cas his gift. He’d given him gifts before. And that gift ...that was way more romantic in retrospect but this was making his heart swell. Something Cas liked, something for him to possibly use almost every day.
When Dean told him about the proposal he immediately asked to be part of the ceremony to which Dean told him he didn’t have any fancy plans.
Dean shot him a flirtatious look before connecting them in a kiss briefly. Cas sat himself up and got onto Dean's lap, licking Dean’s mouth softly before going in and deeply kissing him again.
On his way out the sliding doors, Dean spotted a small table he swore hadn’t been there before. The table cloth was yellow and draped in bees that had caught his attention from the corner of his eye. A young woman sat behind her small sign that read “Save the Bees.” Dean wandered closer, his hands full but not strained. Her eyes lit up as she noticed Dean. She gave him a warm smile.
“If you could , I doubt it’s important.” Cas said lazily lifting his head and grabbing ahold of his phone from Dean.
It didn’t take long for the field of orange to come into view. A sea of poppies laid before them. Cas poked his head out of the passenger window slightly, the poppies stretched out for miles and miles.
Here it is!!!! My first long real fan fiction after quiet a few years ! This one is for Destiel secret Santa 2020 and it’s for my dear moot ArcticFox007 ✨✨✨💗I did my best to follow your wishlist I hope you like it !!!
That hadn’t gone as planned, dinner after was quiet but not in an awkward way. In a comfortable and unspoken way. Sam didn’t seem to notice or at least he didn’t react.
Cas giggled softly. “Thanks Dean, such a gentle man.” His tone teasing slightly taking his extended hand.
He had no idea proposing Dean read his poetry would have him so completely enthralled and he would be lying if he said he wasn’t enjoying it. Something as simple as opening his notebook and jotting a few quick words would grab Dean’s attention like it was something elicit that he was doing. Instead of simply writing. It got cranked up to ten after he started using the pen he was gifted. Castiel adored his pen. It was a hell of a lot better than the motel pen he had been previously using to write with and of course, this one reminded him of that first kiss.
“I’m gonna go now, Sam,” he says, trying to sound firm, but landing on beaten. He turns. Sam’s hand on his arm stops him again, and Dean tries not to notice the miniature flare of panic at the idea of someone grabbing him. Holding him. Pinning him –
He finds Jack bowed over his laptop at the dining room table, face illuminated by the blue light of the screen. The kid’s munching on a bowl of dried cereal, which is apparently his late-night snack of choice.
Martin pipes up. He seems like the type of guy who’s anxious to be helpful. Or maybe he’s just anxious. As Dean watches him, he seems to be almost vibrating with nerves. And his voice kinda explodes out of his lips like he can’t wait to be rid of it. Frank, also, seems on edge. He’s clearly hyper-vigilant and a little twitchy. He keeps looking over his shoulder, and Dean can’t help but notice he took the spot in the circle with the clearest view of the door.
Cas’s truck is already waiting for them. Maybe Cas is inside, setting up some kind of ambush. Dean doesn’t wait for Sam to pull the lever into park before he swings his door open. He musters whatever strength he has left to get out of the seat, uses his momentum to take his first steps toward the door.
“Alright, you’re gonna come into my apartment, and we’re gonna figure this out. Dude,” she says again, aghast, “you’re shaking really hard and kind of freaking me out.”
cooped up in the same crummy hotel room together – makes him want to curl up in bed and never come out again.
“Hey, hey,” Dean says immediately. He clumsily drops his hand and pats the side of the bed. He doesn’t have enough strength to scoot over, but there’s enough space for Cas to perch there on one thigh.
It only makes Dean fight harder. He kicks out at random, and his foot connects with someone’s knee. More cursing.
He sucks in a shuddering breath, but his lungs don’t want to inflate, so he rolls onto his back and forces himself into a sitting position, even though his back screams at him for moving too quickly.
“You, ah, seem good,” Sam says tentatively, shifting his workspace to the far side of the counter, so he’s out of the way of the stove.
“Okay,” Dean says. He sounds all breathless and weird, like a teenage girl who just got told Justin Bieber wanted to marry her. “Okay,” he tries again. “Listen, I’m gonna be totally honest –” No. No, Dean is not going to be honest. He is so not built to have this kind of conversation sober. “That sounds, ah, I mean, that sounds really great. I just – I’m not – ah –”
It turns out Charlie’s serious about making over Dean’s apartment, because she doesn’t just drag him to Walmart or Lowe’s; instead, she brings him to a ginormous thrift store that has piles of secondhand furniture. It’s cheap, too, which is a plus because a month without work plus rent, child support, and a stay in a private psychiatric hospital means Dean’s on a shoestring budget.
Dean’s out of the room and half-way down the stairs before he registers he’s in motion. It was so dark in the bedroom that Dean forgot it was still midday. The light spilling into the hallway through the windows is a shock.
This is not fair, Cas thinks, panicked. It’s not fair of Cas to take advantage of Dean’s lack of awareness like this. Cas has to leave, even if moving means waking Dean up.
“I love you,” he tells him seriously, making sure to find Cas’s beautiful blue eyes when he says it; his eyelashes are sticky and clumped from tears.
That’s how Lydia finds them when she gets home, Dean half asleep on the couch and Emma sucking her thumb, out like a light, tiny rasp to her breathing as she sucks air through her stuffed-up nose.
Cas is gone. And it’s fine. It’s fucking fine. Cas is probably – Dean listens hard for a second, still unused to how clearly sounds travel in the small farmhouse compared to the bunker, and he hears both the shower running and someone puttering in the kitchen downstairs – so Cas is in either of those places.
“I think I might have hurt him,” Cas says in a small voice. “And I just need to make sure he’s alright, Sam.”
Fucking stupid. Fucking manwhore. Can’t he fucking keep it in his pants for even one fucking interaction?
“You sure?” Dean says. And he’s never been good at this. The prying apart people’s stories thing. He never knows when it’s okay to dig farther, whether someone’s secretly hoping he’ll ask the question or if they just want to be left alone. Sam always takes the
Sam gulps, but nods. “I’m sure,” he says to Cas. And then he says to Dean, voice softer, almost pleading. “We just – we need to figure out what’s going on with you, man. Okay?”
Dean’s belly is twisted up into a thousand knots, but he swallows hard and bats the guy’s cigarette out of his hand.
Sure enough, Cas shoulders open the door a second later. He’s carrying a glass of water and Dean’s pills.
“You have any other jewelry?” she asks, scanning his mother’s ring he wears on his right hand when he’s not at the garage and Sam’s amulet. “Sucks your ears aren’t pierced. That’d be hip as fuck. Maybe a septum piercing. You should talk to Meg.”
“Sammy, just wait a Goddamn second, okay?” Dean blusters. His face is even redder than it was before.
“I dunno,” Dean says uncomfortably. He doesn’t feel great under the scrutiny of so many eyes. “It’s just something I wear. I think Sammy mentioned it was supposed to be protective, or some shit. Not that I fall for woo-woo crap like that.”
He catches her nametag this time: Lilith. And, for a fraction of a second, he wonders how much trouble he’d get into if he flipped his tray in her smug face. But it’s not worth it. And he painfully slogs through half his meal until he feels like he’s going to throw up. And then he sleeps again.
Sam’s hacked into New Philadelphia’s police database. There’s a photo of a crudely drawn skull. Dean stares for a second, trying to remember why it feels so familiar –
He’s – fuck. He’s actually really fucking cute. And Dean turns away before he can forget that this isn’t a
Dean finds a bruise on his shoulder, left there by the toe of Luca’s shoe, and he squeezes it hard, grounding himself in the pain, not letting himself fall apart. Not yet. He can’t afford to fall apart yet. Not when Sammy’s waiting for him at Turner’s yard.
And Sam’s not a kid. The other guys are three, four, five years older than him at most. And Sam’s already nearly taller than all of them, even though, as Dean says, he’s skinnier-‘ana-beanpole. Besides, Dean was Sam’s age when he dropped out of school and founded the Hunters with Benny. Sam can look after himself.
“Sorry –” Dean says at once. He pushes up with his good leg and leans over so he can unbuckle Micah’s seat and lift him onto the floor. “Sorry, buddy.”
A sharp knock on the front door radiates through the apartment. Anna sits up sharply. She roughly wipes her eyes with her sleeves and stands up. She brushes past Castiel and leaves his bedroom without another word, tugging the string of her dressing gown closed.
Cas and Jack finally detach. Cas pulls away only far enough so he can clutch Jack’s face, one hand on either side, and press a kiss to Jack’s forehead. Dean can see Cas’s face is blotchy and swollen. His eyes are wet. Dean can only think of one other time when Cas cried this hard, and that’s a day he tries very hard not to remember or talk about – unless he’s feeling comfortable enough with Mia.
It suddenly occurs to Dean that Meg is the friend Cas was talking about. The one that made him learn the trick with the ice cubes. Taught him about staying warm and holding something soft after a panic attack. God, he wishes Cas was here. Wishes so hard it pulses painful in his stomach. Cas would know what to do.
Benny stands with Dean hanging off his shoulder, barely able to get his feet under him. Goddamn, this booze is hitting him hard. Benny fixes Shay with a firm glance.
Jo tosses Dean the satchel of darts Ellen keeps under the counter, and he gently extracts a dart, cordially leads Michael over to the board and begins explaining the rules.
Charlene draws herself up. She has a sharp, chiseled face and manicured eyebrows. She must have been an imposing mother to grow up with.
For example, I initially included the term "Asperger's" to describe Cas's autism in this chapter. I've since changed it when user neuromagpie kindly pointed out in a
Dean doesn’t know what to say. His chest aches and his throat closes up. He shuts his eyes, opens his lips, and what comes out is, “Fuck off, Sam.”
“Um, yeah, sorry ‘bout that,” Dean says. “Can you just, like, slide it back on top?” He stoops a little to give the guy room to stuff the box back on top of the other box in Dean’s arms.
“I know it’s sudden, and I would a’ told you sooner, but I wanted it to be a surprise, and I wasn’t sure it was gonna work out – but I close in three weeks, and then I can move my shit and start, like, living there. It’s in Independence, so it’s, you know, across town, but still super close –”
“Oh my God,” Charlie says when she climbs out of her window. True, Dean doesn’t technically need to chew his gum outside, but he can’t pretend seeing Charlie wasn’t part of his motive for coming onto the fire escape. “Is that a habit I see being broken?”
“Wasn’t great,” Dean says, because it’s not like he can lie. Not when Sam literally called Pam while Dean was in the middle of a mental breakdown.
It’s something, that’s for sure. And it scares Dean to his core. But he feels intoxicated by it. High as a kite and itching for another fix. He wants this rumble over and done with, so he and Cas can get back to – whatever it is they figure out comes next.
He was calling Sam every five minutes, but he stopped after Eileen texted him to let him know that Sam had left his phone at the apartment. She added,
He joins Meg on the floor, being sure to avoid the glass and coffee. He’ll clean it up eventually. First, he wants Meg to stop crying. He really, really wants Meg to stop crying.
“Goodnight, Dean,” Cas says. He pauses with a hand on the door jamb. “Come get me if you need anything.”
“Yeah, well, tell him he and his friend Lafitte ain’t as smart as they think,” Deacon says, forehead wrinkled with something almost like concern. “You tell ‘im we know you kids were cooking something up at the dance tonight. You tell him Campbell’s got his scent, you hear?”
“Stop treating me like a kid, Dean,” Sammy snaps and leaves to walk between Chuck and Ash. A new emotion nestles beside the worry inside Dean’s ribs: something akin to jealousy, but it has too much hurt in it. Dean falls back to the tail of the group, where Jo is skulking around trying to be unobtrusive.
It’s a damn trap, because Kathleen takes advantage of Dean’s distraction with Layla to slip the mask over Dean’s face and secure it over his mouth and nose. Dean’s eyes pop wide, he chokes, squirms, tries to feebly shake the pressure away from his face –
Sam doesn’t say anything. He fades into the background, like Dean taught him. He’s afraid that Benny might suddenly remember that he’d asked Sam to leave, too, and he doesn’t want to be sent away right when things are getting interesting.
“Much better,” Charlie says with a relieved sigh. She immediately flops onto the couch, ruining the placement of the throw pillows, but Dean follows her right down.
“Come here, boy,” Dean says, and wonders if this is gonna become an everyday thing as Miracle bounds over the end of Dean’s bed and into his arms. “At least you smell better than yesterday,” Dean tells Miracle and unabashedly buries his face in the dog’s fur; it ain’t like Sam’s around to make fun of him.
Watch TV. Dean doesn’t have a television because he could barely afford a couch. And he can barely afford this crummy apartment. He can barely afford his monthly rent, his groceries, his therapy bills, his meds, his –
“Dean – shit – calm down!” Sam doesn’t mean to yell, but his heartbeat throbs in his throat, and he just tied his brother to a bed, and he doesn’t know what else to do.
“It’s really…colorful,” Dean says stupidly. He doesn’t even mean it as an insult – instead, it’s just the opposite: the layers of color are entrancing and intense. They make it hard to look away. But Dean has no idea how to articulate that, and now he’s worried Cas is going to think he’s making fun of him, or something.
Worst of all, Layla’s blood pressure drops suddenly and she has to get transferred back to the ICU. It’s not like they were constantly making conversation, but at least he wasn’t totally alone. He’s sick with worry over her half the night before Kathleen takes pity on him and checks with an intensive care nurse, who says Layla’s stable again, but needs to be kept under watch.
Sam finally tugs away to follow Mick out of the building. Dean follows, making sure to stay far enough behind that Sam won’t turn back around to ask him again. Dean’s fine. He’s –
“Not – not gon’ leave,” Dean mumbles. He discovers he won’t start coughing if he takes in tiny sips of air from his nose and exhales carefully from his mouth.
And somehow Cas had known she wasn’t talking about the Mark. Cas’s face flushed uncomfortably warm. He wasn’t aware that angels could blush.
Sam checks the time and does a few quick calculations. “It’s only thirty minutes late, man. And he wasn’t in the best mood, he might have stopped somewhere –”
So, that meant jobs. And it wasn’t like Kansas real estate was booming, or anything, so they could swing it, maybe, if both he and Cas got part time gigs. It wouldn’t be extravagant, by any means, but it’s not like they’re used to living the high-life in the bunker.
Dean sends him a smile over his shoulder. “Take a load off, buddy.” He smacks the grass next to him, inwardly cursing himself for his utter, absolute, batshit stupidity. Buddy?
The nearest thing he’s ever had to friends was Aaron, who sold Dean weed in high school, and Lee, who Dean road-tripped with for a handful of months when Sam was at Stanford. But Dean was also screwing both of them, so they don’t really count. ‘Cause he’s pretty sure friendship doesn’t involve much nudity; platonic is pretty much a corequisite.
“The man himself,” Gabe announces as soon as Dean walks through the street door into the stairwell, and Dean hides a wince; he’d really hoped to get into his apartment without anyone noticing.
. It’s a little after 10:00 when he rouses himself enough to shuffle over to the kitchen so he can take his sleeping pill and really crash. He’s been better at taking his sleeping pills after Victor switched out his temazepam for another aid that makes him less drowsy during the day.
“Charlie, ah,” Dean hisses, not sure what to say to make her come back outside. “Charlie, maybe you shouldn’t –”
“Hey, Mom,” Dean says. He sits cross-legged on the chilled, brittle grass in front of Mary Winchester’s headstone. It’s already dark out.
Sam blinks at Dean from across the table, mouth practically gaping. Several of the other patrons, those close enough to hear the crash among the general ruckus of the diner, turn to see what happened before going back to their breakfasts and coffee.
. If Jody knows, then it means Donna probably knows, too. And the girls. Which isn’t ideal, but at least they’re not making a big thing of it.
“Just to clarify,” Cas replies, totally neutral, like they’re talking about the weather. “I was not specifically asking about a romantic relationship. I would be more than pleased with casual sex.”
“Have you discussed boundaries with him?” Billie asks. Billie watches him again. Dean can hear his fucking heartbeat.
Dean remembers what Cas said about staying quiet, and he swallows back the shout that rises in his throat. He bites his lip until he tastes blood. His stomach clenches so hard it almost hurts, and then, like a snapped rubber band, it releases and the energy swarms outward, an electric charge radiating from his center.
“You guys got plans for tomorrow, too?” Dean asks. He’d invite Cas to Bobby’s, as well, even if it meant putting up with Gabe, but it feels a lot more significant, somehow, then inviting Charlie. He doesn’t want Cas reading into it. For that matter, he doesn’t want Bobby, Ellen, Jo, or Sam reading into it. It would be a lot easier convincing them that he and Charlie weren’t a couple – just mention she’s a lesbian and they’re good as gold – but Cas and Dean? Ellen has wanted Dean to settle down with someone for years; no use getting her hopes up.
“Fine,” Dean says. “Bet you like it like my frou-frou brother.” He opens her fridge. She doesn’t even have real milk, just the fake almond stuff Sam puts in his smoothies. “Gonna ruin it if you don’t stop me.”
And that’s it. Not threats to call the cops if Dean doesn’t reply in an hour. No cavalry called in and waiting in Dean’s apartment to pounce on him. It’s so unlike Sam that the relief propels Dean for long enough to type out a quick message:
And he can’t fight back the feeling that he’s losing so much time just sitting on his ass while he heals. It’s his fault he got sick in the first place; now he’s just making it worse lazing around the complex when he should be out earning money for Emma or working on the upcoming hearing.
“No,” Dean says. He covers his eyes with his arm. “Fuck. Sorry. Should have said something before – didn’t have to make it –”
Sex with Tina is sweaty, fast, a little desperate. Lights off. She’s the kind of woman who knows what she wants. Dean doesn’t mind her taking the lead. He’s always kinda liked getting bossed around in bed.
Dean’s still tapping against his ribs. It’s one of his tells. He knows it because Dad pointed it out a couple dozen times. But it’s not a tell for when he’s lying. It’s a tell for when he’s getting too close to the truth. “Or yeah. I don’t know. Sure.”
Sam’s only three blocks away. He can do this. He can do this for Dean. And his head aches with each step. His vision strobes. He pauses once to dry heave into a dumpster, but he keeps going.
Dean turns, so now he’s facing Cas instead of standing side by side. His heart speeds up, pinballs against his ribs like Elton John and those wild two-story platform shoes in
Dean doesn’t say anything. At this point he’d only tell Cas to fuck off, and he already knows Cas won’t do that.
Dean wants to believe he’d never hurt a kid. Let alone his own kid. But he remembers, in the hazy, distorted swirl in which manic memories exist, drawing a gun in Lisa’s house, pointing it at invisible shadows. Ben was in his room, but what if he’d taken that moment to climb down the stairs? What if Dean’d been so startled by the small, innocent shape that he’d turned his gun and fired?
Sure enough, the doctor that worked on Dean before is standing inside the door with Cas. She’s a woman in her mid-fifties, wearing glasses, holding a clipboard. Sam has seen so many doctors in his life that he’d recognize her earnest-but-sympathetic look anywhere.
“Fair fight,” says Benny, getting up from his chair, crossing the distance to Michael and extending his hand.
“Hold this,” Cas tells him, and stuffs a handful of ice cubes toward Dean’s chest rapidly enough that Dean fumbles to catch them. The cold is stark and biting. He grips the ice hard in both fists, trying desperate to latch ahold to the tingling, sharp pain of the chill.
. Before he can think better of it, he grips Lydia’s hand – still raised – between his own. Her fingers are trembling slightly. “Thank you, Lydia. I mean it.”
“We still have fifteen minutes,” Dr. Jorgensen says kindly, and Dean knows he hasn’t fooled him at all with the whole hiding his face act. “Would you like to talk about something, or would you like to just sit here?”
Thankfully, Cas gets the point. “I quite understand, Dean. You don’t have to explain to me.” Unease trickles into Dean’s stomach; he wonders just what, exactly, Cas thinks he understands.
Dean doesn’t react to the revelation that Donna’s with another woman, but he does relax a little more. At least there’s little chance, now, that she’ll turn out to be some kind of bigoted asshole, not that Dean was planning on divulging any of his sexual history.
A digging, scratching, pressing pain across his ribs. Inside of his body. Dean wants to pass out. Please, God, let him pass out.
“I trust –” Cas comes up for air. His pupils are blown wide so his blue eyes are practically all black. His hair already looks well-fucked, and Dean can’t wait to tangle his fingers back in the strands. “I trust you are amenable to going back to my apartment?”
“Hey,” Dean says, feigning hurt. “The art was cool, too. I mean, I didn’t understand it, but doesn’t mean I can’t, like, appreciate it, or whatever.”
Eileen sits beside the dog on the floor and smiles big at Emma, “Hi, sweetheart,” she signs exaggeratedly as she speaks, waving a large hello. Emma mimics her at once.
“Damn,” Dean laughs it off. “Least there are worse things than dealing with a wet arm for the rest of the night.”
Cas understands that Dean has intentionally changed the subject, and he knows it would be best if he did not point this out. Cas thinks for a minute, straightening out all the pieces inside his head, not entirely sure how to start, but Dean waits for him patiently.
Castiel’s eyes widen in comprehension, and then he spins away. Gets swallowed by the shadows so quickly it’s almost like he sprouted wings and took flight.
Turns out Jody’s busy tackling a non-supernatural drug bust. Donna, Claire, and Kaia are hunting a Wendigo near the border. Eileen is in Florida with her friend Sue, chasing down a pair of vetalas and killing time at the beach; she’s sent Sam several bikini pics, judging by the doofy look he gets on his face every time he swipes up to her messages. Jody offers to call the network to find someone else, but Sam tells her not to bother.
. Charlie pauses her cursor over the episode on her Netflix home screen. Dean helped her angle her desk toward the couch, so they’re watching on one of her three large, flatscreen monitors. They’re sharing her loveseat under the window, which means they’re sitting kind of close, but it feels comfy and casual. Charlie has a way of unabashed sprawling that feels entirely welcoming. “I nearly flushed my phone down the toilet just so I wouldn’t be tempted to text her. But I’m a strong, independent woman, dammit, and I persevered.”
“Wow!” Ella launches herself off the armrest and into Jack’s arms. She winds her legs and arms around him in as large a hug as she can muster. “Hi, Jack! Hi! I’m Ella! You wanna play? I got toys and games! And my own room now because Mr. Bobby came in summer to build an es-ten-shun.”
“That’s a good idea,” Dean says hoarsely. Cas bought pillows for him. Cas wanted Dean to be comfortable when he came over to hang out with Cas in the studio. The gesture should be tremendously comforting; instead, it leaves a trail of gooseflesh down Dean’s spine.
“Why not bricks?” Dean says, voice smooth and cold. “Or sticks and bottles? You too chicken to settle this the old fashion way? Afraid to get in close? Too chicken for plain skin?”
“I, ah, meant to ask,” Dean says, as Cas rounds the hood and joins him on the curb. “Am I supposed to wear a tie to this thing?”
Dean and Sam started coming back to Stull after Dad died. It was Sam’s idea. Spend November second in a way that didn’t involve drinking themselves stupid and getting into a bar fight, coughing back the stink of smoke in their lungs. Visit Mom in the morning. Just the two of them.
Branches clatter against the windows. The front bumper slams into a trunk of a tree. And the 1967 Chevy Impala doesn’t have airbags. So, Dean whips forward. Chest slams into the steering wheel. Neck snaps forward and his head cracks against the windshield, leaves a smear of blood behind. The motor sputters and smokes. Dean falls backward, slumps against the door.
The silence in the car prickles; there’s something there, on the tip of Sam’s tongue, he just doesn’t know what it is. Cas fidgets in the passenger seat. Sam’s brain runs at one-hundred miles per hour:
“Fucking bastard,” Benny says, and makes to clap Dean on the back. But Dean catches Benny’s hand in the air, gives his fist a gentle pat, and the two of them exchange a soft glance that always makes jealousy rear its ugly head in Sam’s chest, cause he’s Dean’s
Except it’s not like Sammy tried to – well, it’s not like Sammy went off the rails. Sammy’s still – part of that thought must show on Dean’s face, because Sam keeps talking:
just because you don’t like their choices? You wanna talk about how you’re fucking your wife every night and getting blow jobs from your secretary every morning? You don’t know morality if it came up and bit you on your ass –”
. It’s not his fault, Pam said. “I mean, I’m sorry about after. When I tried to, you know. The thing you said, about not being able to trust me. I’m sorry I, um, scared you like that. Or, ah, upset you.”
, Dean becomes acutely aware of Cas’s eyes on him. He looks over his shoulder to find the other man watching him with a look so soft it should be outlawed. It’s Dean’s turn to flush.
He twists his head away, moans again, and Sam gets the point. Dean hears a clink as Sam sets the glass on the night table.
“Michael, please,” Dean breathes. His hands are shaking. He is a coward, Dean knows it. He’s a dirty, rotten, piece of shit coward, and all of them know it.
He squeezes his arms hard. He shuts his eyes. He tries not to think about the razor. He tries not to think about slicing line after practiced line, layering one after another across his wrists. How long does it take someone to bleed out? How much would it hurt?
“Emma, baby,” he tells her urgently. “You gotta calm down, okay? We’re going to see Mamma? Okay? We’re gonna go see Mamma, but you gotta calm down first.”
“Awesome,” Dean says. He leaps off the couch, and he’s half-way to the office door before Pam talks him back around.
And Dean had to live with the fact that every time Dad looked at him, every time Dean couldn’t help but think
“When you say you hadn’t remembered…?” Billie’s eyebrows duck in concern, and – yeah – no shit copping to amnesia in front of a shrink is gonna raise a couple red flags.
Dean realizes he’s still holding the unlit cigarette. He quietly takes his pack back out and stuffs the stick into an empty place.
made this beautiful Dean and Emma art for me on Tumblr in honor of Dean on Father's Day! I embedded the art in Ch. 23 because I thought it fit well in the theme of Dean's first visitation with Emma, but I wanted to post it here, too:
Dean checks to make sure Cas is still with Anna across the room; he’s barely visible in a crowd of family, but he looks like he’s doing okay. Dean has a feeling that his presence is doing more to hinder Cas then help him at the moment – as long as Dean’s not there, no one will ask them if they’re dating, after all – besides, he needs to cool off, so Dean heads for the door at the end of the room that leads onto the deck that overlooks the harbor.
Four things he can feel: the door behind his back, the cuffs of his flannel brushing his wrists, sweat slithering down the side of his face, his feet tight and hot in his sneakers.
Mick hasn’t grasped the enormity of what just happened. His eyes soften in pity, but his voice is still composed when he explains gently, “I’m sorry, Dean. But it was an outstanding charge in Tennessee. You’re well past the statute of limitations, so they can’t still arrest you, but the charge wasn’t expunged from your record.”
Dean salutes her with his cigarette to his forehead. “You mentioned you’re staying with some Jody person?” he prompts.
The door opens, shrieking on its hinges, and the Angels file in. Quiet spills across the bar like black ink.
“Golden retrievers are very good family dogs,” Eileen says comfortingly. “They’re gentle with children.”
It has the desired effect: Sam goes red and turns his attention to his souffle. “There aren’t any gory details. She’s nice. She’s smart. I don’t know, she’s fun to hang around.”
Bobby picks up one of the towels and dabs at Dean’s face with a clean corner, wiping away sweat and tears from his warm, pain-flushed skin.
“Nope,” Dean says. His arms are crossed in front of his chest, and he’s trying hard not to tap his foot.
“But you gotta,” Dean pauses. He shuts his eyes, and his face blanches as he rides out a wave of pain. “You gotta,” his voice is fainter when he continues, “head to the apartment…pack up our stuff, okay?”
Dean slides his phone back into his pocket. His hands are shaking. He heads back into his apartment to finish getting dressed. He tosses a dress shirt over his tank, buttons it to his chin. Threads a tie around his neck, not tight enough it feels like he’s suffocating, and tying it crisp and neat like Dad taught him, when he was nine and it was his first time heading into a courtroom.
Sorry for the delay, besties! Life be busy lately. I'll hopefully get the next chapter (penultimate!!!!) up sometime this weekend. And I'll reply to my backlog of comments soon! For now, thank you, as always, for keeping up with this fic.
Dean reminds himself to breathe. His chest hurts. There’s a phantom twinge in his bad leg, starting in his hip and running down his shin to his left foot.
“I didn’t say you were!” Sam says. “Can we just go?” And, shit, he never did get around to the apartment. He doesn’t want to leave all their stuff behind, but, right now, getting the hell out of Dodge is more important than a couple of old records, even if he’s sure Dean will disagree.
He’s still shaking, so he burrows under the covers. His head splinters with pain from one ear to another.
There’s someone in the passenger seat. That’s the only thing Dean fully registers before he works his way as quickly as possible to the front door, brace thumping on the floor with every step.
Sam frowns at him, but he steps forward like he’s going to give Dean a hug, so Dean complies. He wasn’t sure what Sam would be like – it’s the first time they’ve talked since the disastrous deposition. Apparently Sam’s decided to enter that terrible holding pattern where he pretends everything’s okay before he can find an appropriate time to “talk.”
He takes it slow this time: makes sure he clears his lungs with a couple gulps of cold air before lighting up again. He takes a sip from the end of the cigarette and holds it right behind his teeth, like when he was 15 taking his first drag and didn’t want the other kids to laugh at him. He breathes the smoke out slowly. His lungs ache, feeling like dried-up sponges inside his chest, but he doesn’t cough again.
Dean grins at the callback to their first meeting. “Just means you’ll have to bring me another mug in the morning, sunshine.”
“What have we here?” It hisses, facial features shifting between Cas’s furrowed brows to Jack’s perturbed grimace. “Two of you now?”
“You on the bus?” Sam says. He can probably hear the rumble of the road under the tires, the screech of breaks, and the chatter of the other passengers.
He’s fucking worthless. Dean doesn’t blame Sergei for rejecting his application. Dean’s an awful tenant. He’s too much of a risk. He’s unstable and angry. And he shouldn’t ever get more custody of Emma –
Castiel smiles gently at Dean. “If it is Sunday, you come to hear the choir and a sermon. But if you come when no one else is here, mostly you come to pray.”
Amara interrupts. She has eyes only for her brother. “We both know you’re bluffing. You can’t hurt Sam unless you hurt yourself.”
“You’re not gonna pass out on me or anything, are you?” Shay asks, wrinkling her nose at the prospect at having to drag his drunk ass to the hospital if he came down with alcohol poisoning.
“Sounds good, Doc,” he says with false optimism. Victor frowns at him, obviously unconvinced and possibly concerned, but he doesn’t say anything else besides good-bye as Dean leaves the office.
“Y’all want some beers?” Christian digs out a couple bottles from the cooler. He tosses them across the room before Sam or Dean can answer. Dean catches his on instinct.
It suddenly occurs to Sam what he’s doing, how Dean always insisted that men don’t hurt girls, no matter who the bitch is. And Sam drops Anna like she burned him. Anna wilts against the fence; she gasps for air. She looks pale and sick. Sam totters two steps back. He looks at his hands and he doesn’t understand. There’s something wrong with him.
Dean just nods. Cas told him about this, he remembers. How Anna seemed like she was separating herself from the family’s stringent values before she turned back at the end of high school, just in time to miss Cas’s own period of doubt.
“Dean,” Sam says again. He helps pull up Dean’s blanket and tucks it around his shoulders so it doesn’t slip off. “You know I’m not mad, right?”
Perhaps he owned chickens. Cas wonders if Dean would let them get chickens. Dean likes eggs; it would be nice to have fresh ones for breakfast.
It’s a joke. Dean knows it’s a joke, in the tasteless, tactless way people make jokes when they’re feeling awkward. His fingers bit into his palms. He hides it by bending to pull up his own underwear and pants.
“I’ve seen it,” Anna says, voice clipped. And she immediately turns her back on Cas. This is it, Castiel realizes, and he has to suddenly bite his lip against the influx of emotion. This might be the last time he ever sees her.
Dean’s smile starts slow and uncertain, but then it becomes a beam of light, so wide it hurts something deep inside Cas’s core. He vows to make Dean smile like that as often as possible.
“You don’t know,” he says, strangled. “What it fucking feels like to live with this – to know I didn’t – to know I
Dean smiles sadly in return. “I think she would ‘a liked you. She liked nearly everyone so long they weren’t a jerk. Dad though – well, he didn’t like anyone, really, so you’re off the hook where he’s concerned, I guess.”
“When you say things like ‘not a big deal’ or that it was ‘just’ something, you’re diminishing the value of your own experiences. Do you know why you do that?”
Jack straightens out and approaches cautiously, eyes glued to Micah. Dean, himself, can’t look away from Jack. He never thought he’d see him again, and the thought sticks in Dean’s throat until it’s hard to breathe.
“Dean Winchester,” Billie greets him with her deep, soothing voice, and Dean stands sheepishly in the open doorway of her office. “I’m glad to see you back.”
“I, ah, dunno,” Dean says uneasily. What is Cas gonna wear? Is he gonna wear is earrings? Should Dean dig out some of his old bracelets? Should he –
“He – whiskey,” Sam gulps. He tastes acid. The room smells like alcohol and vomit and old cigarettes. “It looks like two fifths. And, ah,” he fishes for the empty bottle of painkillers he found on the ground. Vicodin. It’s an old prescription, something they carried around for emergencies. Sam has no idea how many pills were leftover. “And this.”
And for a long time, Sam just assumed it was from hustling pool or poker, maybe in some of his darker moments he thought Dean was stealing, but when they were stuck in small towns, it would have been impossible to hit a bar more than once, before Dean got thrown out on his ass or someone figured out he was carrying a fake license.
“Dude,” Sam huffs, voice a cross between amusement and empathetic. “It’s just coffee. It’s fine. Eileen can have it – I think that’s her getting up.”
“Shh, Dean,” Castiel whispers into Dean’s forehead, gripping Dean’s hand tight in his own. Lips ghosting across Dean’s clammy skin. “You’re going to be alright.
Cas beams at him. Dean really does roll his eyes at that, but instead of tugging away, he brings Cas in again to smack his lips once more with a quick kiss.
There’s still anger welling in Dean’s chest, but there’s fear, too, because he can’t help but see what Sam must see when he looks at Dean: someone who can barely hold themselves together, can barely provide for themselves, who can’t even be left alone for a week without falling to pieces.
And he thinks about the rumble that will take place that night. Michael and Luca had been abuzz about it when they came in late last night. Castiel knows Dean must be going, too. Perhaps Dean is too busy preparing for the fight, and he’s forgotten he agreed to meet Castiel.
“You wanna go with Junior, peanut?” Dean suggests softly. “He can bed down in your room, okay? You wanna show him where that is?”
There’s someone standing in the center of the room, near the island. Cas can tell, even in the darkness, that it’s Dean.
Here’s the thing: Sam always sounds so hopeful. Maybe he was tentative about the apartment when Dean first brought it up, but now that the step is taken, Sam will resolutely believe that it was a step in the right direction. Letting Sammy down is about the worst thing Dean’s ever done in his life; he’s not planning on doing it again.
Cas is waiting for him when Dean comes downstairs. Dean expects him to harp about eating breakfast, maybe push an apple on him or some crap because Cas is getting almost as bad as Sammy about this healthy eating schtick. But Cas doesn’t say anything, just shrugs on his coat to keep off the rain and leads the way to the front door.
Fuck. Dean’s breathing hard. His chest hurts. He wants to get to the bed, but he doesn’t make it. He crumples in a heap on the floor, thighs pressed tight against his heaving stomach, forehead scraping against the rough carpet. He pushes his hands into his hair and tugs hard, trying to pull himself back with the pain. It doesn’t work.
Sam’s eyes burn. He stares at his brother’s face: swollen from the medication, but there’s no hiding the sickly shade of his skin, the dark hallows under his eyes, the sharpness of his bones jutting through skin because he’s lost so much weight lately. And Sam should have known. He should have fucking known.
“We, ah, should probably hash this out,” Dean says cautiously. “When we’re not…you know.” He waves at the alley and the rain. “But, um, there’s some shit I probably need to tell you.”
Mick files Dean’s motion to modify child custody and serves Lydia’s lawyer with the summons, a total bitch named Toni Bevell, who Dean remembers all too well as being on the opposite end of the phone call about the initial paternity test.
Dean lights his cigarette after ending the call with Mick. He smokes for a while, leaning against the garage, staring at the heap of garbage spilling out of the dumpster across the alley.
And Dean, who has left Cas behind so many times. Who has messed up so many times. Who, despite what Cas said, is not worth dying for.
“I can answer your questions,” Castiel draws himself to his full height. He knows he looks absurd. He is wearing only a bathrobe and his underwear. He tries to inject as much authority as possible into his voice, but he is unused to being the man of the house. “Anna can leave.”
“Well, it didn’t go horribly tonight with Luke, did it?” Dean asks. Awkward as fuck, yeah, and maybe kind of backbiting in the way rich people always seem to double talk, but overall not a disaster. Then again, Dean’s criteria for a disaster is a family gathering ending when someone gets punched in the nose.
Fuck him, Dean thinks with unexpected fervor. It’s not Dean’s fault if he can’t handle a normal frikken one-night stand. They aren’t, like,
The whole task leaves him too riled to attempt to sleep, which was his first plan of action, so, instead, he grabs his cigarettes and heads for the fire escape.
,” Charlie says again, shaking her head. She climbs back onto the couch and shifts his laptop so they can both see the screen, pressing play.
or a raging tantrum. Thank God, it’s the former tonight. Dean stands with Cas and Emma at the shoreline for the last few minutes before he finally calls it, and Emma lets herself be bundled in his arms, waving goodbye to her new feathered friends.
Nick punches a grunt out of Dean’s throat, and he pushes hard against the wall to keep standing. He’s going to be sore tomorrow. Dean’s body is hot. There’s that twist in his gut again, harsh enough he gasps through it.
She fishes two medication bottles out from the pouch of her hoodie and gives them a rattle. “Got your drugs. Also your toothbrush. And now I’m gonna ask you a super uncomfortable and intrusive question, but I saw the razor blades, so I gotta know….”
“Hey, boys,” Dean lowers his voice to a gentle timbre. He sticks his machete in his belt so the kids won’t see the blade and get scared. “We’re here to get you out, okay?”
“I – I can’t…” Dean stammers. He looks desperate. A little unhinged, maybe. Sam wonders just how many times Luca kicked him in the head. “I promised, Sammy. I can’t just leave Cas behind.”
There’s an old guy across the counter that looks vaguely familiar, but Dean’s soon drunk enough to not care. Son of a bitch probably just has the kind of face that always looks like someone else.
“I’m Amy,” the blond woman to Benny’s right says. Real Housewives. She’s got fake, red nails that look like they’ve been dipped in blood. “And I’m a member of alcoholics anonymous.”
Benny hesitates long enough for Michael to spring back into action. He takes advantage of Benny’s distraction to tangle a foot between Benny’s legs. Benny upends and lands hard on his ass. Dean is between Michael and Benny in a blink of an eye, arms outstretched, heart clogging his throat.
Dean takes the last flight to his floor at a jog; it’s more than enough to get his heart pumping. He hopes to high-hell that Sam attributes Dean’s sweat and breathlessness to climbing four flights of un-airconditioned stairs, because he cannot afford to let Sam see Dean as anything less than fine, right now.
“Don’t pester your brother,” Cas says, nestling close to Dean’s side, and – despite the heat – Dean finds he doesn’t at all mind the physical affection. He wrenches his arm free from between them and tosses it over Cas’s shoulders.
But now it’s done, and it’s gonna be just like it was with Jo. Except it won’t be for six years. It’ll be forever. Because there’s nothing for Dean to fall back on with Cas; they barely knew each other long enough to count at friends.
“Listen,” Sam says, trying hard to ignore the anxious ache in his chest. “I’ll try to call him. If I don’t hear back from him in twenty minutes –”
Eventually, Sarah’s called away to deal with curating duty, and Dean’s left alone. He loads up a second plate of food and retreats to the corner of the room, where he’s not in anyone’s way, and he can observe Cas without looking like a total creeper.
Sam clearly wasn’t expecting Dean to cave because he’s momentarily at a loss for words. He lets out a violent breath, chest heaving. “Fine,” he says. He drops his hands, turns away, maybe looks a little ashamed about coming on so strongly. “Fine, Dean. It’s just – I’m trying to
“Let go,” Sam whimpers into Castiel’s shirt, but he doesn’t tug away. Instead, he grabs wildly for something to hold onto and fists his hands tight in the back of Castiel’s jacket. “God, leave him alone. We don’t need you. We don’t fucking need you.”
Pam lets him go with a good-bye and a reminder to be gentle with himself. Dean spends a few minutes doing some of her stupid breathing exercises before he gathers enough courage to go downstairs.
. It wasn’t rape because Dean loved it. And he loved his social studies teacher, Angela, a little bit too. It’s not like she was some kind of sexual predator. She didn’t pull up outside his house in an ice cream truck. She didn’t bad touch him in a church basement. She didn’t fucking
Sam remembers that Eileen watched Lillian O’Grady die of cancer when she was sixteen, that she clearly understands what Sam’s going through, and it isn’t fair of Sam to shut her out.
Dean huffs a laugh, but it turns into a weird, strangled sound that gets caught in his throat, and Cas tightens his grip around his back. So maybe, yeah, maybe he can’t laugh about that quite yet.
Something like relief, except it hurts. It hurts so bad Dean sobs. It tugs itself free of his aching chest, sends pain down both arms.
She releases his left wrist. Dean immediately tugs his hand free and covers his face with his forearm. His skin lands in warm, sticky tears. Shit. He’s not wearing a shirt. He’s just wearing a stupid, flimsy hospital gown, which means his arms and legs are totally bare and everyone can see the fucking scars. Dean hates his body. He hates it. He fucking hates it –
The heat plus the alcohol plus the unidentifiable ache in the center of Dean’s body make him sleepy. He thought about taking off his boots, curling into the bed, not getting up again.
“I don’t want to hurt Sammy,” Dean protests. He sways where he stands; for a moment Cas thinks he’s going to get lucky and Dean’s going to faint. “He – if I’m gone than – than his plan won’t work anymore. I don’t – don’t let him use me anymore, Cas.”
What the fuck is he supposed to do? “Cas – buddy –” he reaches for him, helpless. But Cas flinches hard out of the way of Dean’s hands. He hits the shelf behind him, sends a couple cans of Lysol rolling off the shelf.
“Fuck,” Dean says unsteadily, running shaking hands through his hair. “Sorry – I,” this is not about him. This can’t be about him, right now. “Sorry,” he finishes, softer.
And Dean could feel himself hardening under the guy’s hand. And no no no no fuck no because Dean didn’t want – Dean wouldn’t let him –
“You’re very warm,” Cas says. And he’s got one of his large, dry hands pressed against Dean’s forehead. It feels so nice. Soft and cool and gentle. Dean wants Cas to touch him again, but Cas is already pulling his hand away. “You shouldn’t be out of bed.”
“Emma,” Dean calls for the umpteenth time that afternoon, jogging to catch up to Emma’s surprisingly quick legs for being so damn tiny. “You gotta stay by Daddy, sweetheart.”
Then Jack returns with the cuffs, and Sam pushes his doubts to the back of his head, where they won’t get in the way of doing the job. He works quickly and efficiently, trying to forget it’s his brother he’s chaining down, who’s fighting back tooth and nail because Dean fucking hates to be tied up and Sam –
“Sure,” Dean says, but his heart is tripping in his throat. His eyes are burning, and it’s taking every ounce of his control to not start bawling. And he doesn’t want to. He doesn’t want this to be such a big deal.
“That’s not gonna happen, Sammy,” Dean tells his brother firmly. “All that crap? We fixed that. We fucking kicked their asses. You hear me?”
Reality filters in and out. A doctor hovers overhead and asks Dean questions. She’s replaced by a receptionist who wants to know about insurance. Who’s replaced by Alastair who croons,
Cas smiles again. He looks pleased at the thought, and Dean’s glad he said it. “It’s good,” Cas says. “The idea that our family is expanding.”
“Fuck off,” Dean says. And shit. Because his eyes are burning. The heat is building inside his skull until he’s sure his head is going to pop. “Just don’t fucking –”
Dean forgot he told her that. He shakes his head, no. She doesn’t look super convinced, which is fair. Dean really should have taken a Valium this morning when he woke up in the middle of a panic attack. That’s what it’s for: emergencies, but Dean can count on one hand the number of times he’s voluntarily downed it.
Dean still doesn’t know why she approached him. She was so antagonistic toward Benny. Maybe she just wants to talk. Hell, Dean can understand that. Talking in a room full of people is a shit-ton different then talking one-on-one with someone who gets it. He figures he and Kaia were kind of the outsiders in there – the only ones that didn’t voluntarily share something – and maybe they’ve got a sort of companionship, now.
“You asked how many years I’ve been here,” Cas clarifies. He is much calmer now that he’s been removed from the crowd at the gallery. “I moved right after I graduated.”
“Hey, peanut,” he tells her softly. He’s got one hand on her back, the other is playing with her darkening curls around her tiny ears. “Rough day, huh?”
“Top of the day to ya, Lieutenant,” Ash says, tipping an imaginary cap and sharing a grin that reveals two missing teeth.
When the delivery man shows up with the pizza, everyone scrambles for cash so they can pay. Meg brings the stack of boxes and sack of wings across the floor to Charlie’s kitchen. They forgo plates, eating with their hands and catching grease in the napkins that came with the pizza.
“Might sting a little,” Dean warns belatedly, and Sam shoots him the patented Bitch Face. After Dean’s padded each of the cuts with antiseptic, he douses the tweezers with iodine and goes after the pebbles.
Shit. Dean thought the coughing up blood thing was a fluke. It only happened that once on the fire escape. Dean assumed he’d just irritated his throat enough to make it bleed.
“It was difficult, yes.” Cas agrees. “It took me a long time to realize she was wrong. But it’s still difficult to internalize it.”
Cas joins him a minute later, carrying two mugs of coffee. He slides one across the table to Dean. Grabs the box of cereal and stuffs his hand into the opening, bringing out a fistful of wafers.
“Do you have any fucking clue what this is like for me?” Sam exclaims. “Do you know what the fuck it’s like to do everything in my power to keep you safe and to have you fight me at every fucking turn? I was
“Are you fucking kidding me?” Dean interrupts him. “I get my wheels back on the first. You think I’m letting you drag my ass around in your fucking Prius for one second longer –”
“I, ah, I guess I ended up screwing around with one of my teachers. She – she was helping me with college stuff. But then we left that school, and I just never picked it back up. Didn’t seem like there was a point.”
“It makes me drowsy during the day,” Dean decides to tell her. “I can’t deal with that shit if I’m working at the garage.”
, Dad tells him, and Dean’s not going to even try to identify the irony of Dad’s voice appearing in this situation.
It’s another blow, and Dean tenses to stop a full-body flinch. She doesn’t know him. She doesn’t cry for him. She doesn’t reach for him when she’s scared. She doesn’t know that he’ll protect her because she’s never met him.
Dean excuses himself quietly. Cas’s arm slips from around Dean’s shoulder. Dean disappears down the hallway where he remembers the bathroom is. It’s across the hall from Cas’s bedroom. Dean shuts his eyes and tries not to think about having sex with Cas. Tries not to think about the disaster that came afterward.
sign, which Dean sends back with a blown kiss and a wink. Dean’s smile follows Cas back out of the door, then he drops another kiss to Micah’s forehead, carefully brushes a curl of hair away from Ella’s eye.
“Okay.” Sam says on an exhale. “Listen, you’ve been running pretty hard for the past two weeks. Neither of us have been getting much sleep. And you’ve been drinking, like, a lot. So maybe you just need to take it easy, okay?
Dr. Jorgensen leads them to his office, where he waves them to two seats before dropping behind a desk. Sam can’t help but remember the time he and Dean checked themselves into that mental hospital for the wraith case. It feels surreal to be playing the role in real life.
“I’m inviting Charlie, as well. So you’ll know more than just me. She knows a lot of people I know. The local queer community is quite close knit.”
And there’s an older woman frowning at him from the foot of his bed. She’s got a round face, a halo of tight curls, and a clipboard in her hands.
“Clearly something is wrong,” Cas says. He sounds upset. His face hovers above Dean’s, obstructing his view of the ceiling. “Can I get you something? Water?”
“I’m – ah,” the blonde pixie cut says. The artless rips in her jeans and backpack slung over her shoulder make Dean wonder if she’s homeless. Plus, there’s a guarded look in her eye that Dean remembers from when he was about her age. “I’m Kate. I’m an alcoholic.”
Sam finally looks at Dean head-on, and Dean doesn’t let himself look away. He searches his brother’s face for any sign of hurt or suspicion or frustration. But Sam learned his lesson back in the diner: he’s not gonna push.
“I can’t believe that,” Cas says. His heart thuds inside his chest. His stomach is tight with nerves. Carefully, he crawls the tips of his fingers over Dean’s shoulder until his palm is lying flat there. He can feel the heat of Dean’s skin under his leather jacket, the shifting of his muscles as he tenses under Cas’s touch. It is so hot Cas would not be surprised if he was searing a handprint into Dean’s flesh.
“Please don’t, Bobby,” Dean begs, voice hoarse, feeling wrung out. “Please, just, not fucking today.”
“It’s, um,” Cas licks his lips. It’s hard to concentrate. He should have planned out this conversation better in advance. “It’s only fifteen minutes from here. On the other side of Lebanon –”
Sam looks vaguely guilty, but Dean tosses him a reassuring smile when he gathers Emma into his arms. It’s just an overtired toddler tantrum; Dean hopes to God it’s not an omen of what’s to come in the terrible twos.
“Dean!” Charlie squeals excitedly when Dean enters the room upstairs. He didn’t notice it the first time he visited the bar, but the entire second floor is set up like a cozy study area or coffee shop. There are plush, ragged couches, stacks of boardgames on the floor, and tiny reading nooks. Charlie’s group is seated at a round table in the corner of the room.
Then he heads out of his apartment and down to the street to his baby. He drives to the courthouse and gets there earlier than even Sammy, who’s always been chronically ahead of schedule.
Dean should apologize to her. Dean should tell her sorry for getting angry. He didn’t mean to – he wasn’t going to – to yell at her or something. He wouldn’t hurt her.
And how high can he count before drifting off to sleep? He falls back onto his bed, atop rumpled blankets and pillows. The bottle of pills in his hand rattles. The springs jostle the nausea in his stomach. He fishes for the bottle he left somewhere on the mattress. His fingers close around the neck.
He wants to be alone. He wants to wash away the past few days. He wants to stand under a hot stream of water and let the heat bleed into him, scald his skin, peel flesh from his bones.
He can’t call Cas. He can’t tell Cas that he fell off the wagon. Drove his car into a tree. Can’t tell Cas that he hasn’t taken his meds in two days. Can’t tell Cas – not when Cas is already so disappointed.
“That’s not what I meant. It’s they couldn’t – a girl against someone stronger than her or who drugged her or who – she couldn’t stop it. I could have
He doesn’t like the idea of Cas or Sammy undressing him or dressing him or washing him or whatever the fuck else they’ve had to do. Constantly starting at his body. Touching him.
“And Bobby couldn’t have just told me about it?” Dean says, because he doesn’t want to think about the other thing – the Jo being back thing; the Jo inevitably interacting with Dean thing – so he latches onto this other, ultimately insignificant hurt.
“God moves in mysterious ways,” Layla says with a wink. Ordinarily Dean scoffs at those kind of sentiments, but that feels pretty mean-spirited when Layla’s lying half-dead in a hospital bed. Whatever she needs to believe to get through; Dean can’t fault her that.
“It doesn’t –” Meg presses her palms against her face and groans, “God, I sound like a fucking after school special – but it doesn’t
“Dean?” Cas answers, cracking open his eyes again, but not looking particularly worried, which is good, because Dean really wants to carry off this morning without adding anymore to Cas’s worries.
The last hour is terrible. It’s nearly ten o’clock according to Dean’s watch, but it’s approaching eleven in Eastern Standard Time, so Dean’s exhausted, and he’s run down from having bypassed an early dinner, too nervous to eat anything. He’s only ever flown once before: back when Sam was at Stanford, Dean scraped up enough money to fly out to him during his first winter break. Dean remembers that taking off and the descent were the worst parts. The terrible pitch in his stomach is the same when the plane drops altitude, as is the painful popping in his ears and the feeling of vertigo that rushes through his body.
Dean turns to Micah, bracing himself for the kind of heartbreaking fight Micah is apt to give whenever faced with the idea of either Dean or Cas leaving him for the night. “What about you, sport?”
“Get their hair done?” Sam says incredulously. Then he softens into his typically half-chastising, half-sympathetic tone he pulls when he thinks Dean’s being irrational, but he isn’t sure whether or not it’s because of one of Dean’s many
The first few months were spent on pain management and relearning how to walk with only one functional leg. Thankfully, his KAFO and walker, affectionately dubbed Chuck Norris and spray-painted hot pink in a to-be-retaliated prank from Sam, helps him get around pretty-well. His current six-month goal is to strengthen his core muscles enough that he can graduate to a pair of crutches, but it’s hard to be bummed about a walker when Dean knows he could very well not be walking at all, or much worse, dead, burned, and buried.
It’s hard to get out of bed, but now that Dean has a goal in mind, he’s able to push aside the covers and slip his feet onto the floor. The concept of putting on shoes right now is completely out of reach.
“Dean?” Sam’s voice comes through the speaker, clipped and hurried. “Are you, ah, good this morning?”
. Maybe we’re kinda taking a break, right now. While she’s off doing cool motorcycle stuff across the country all month.”
“My name’s Shaylene,” she says. She puts a hand on his arm. Her palm is warm through his sleeve. She looks kind and soft. Dean aches to have her against him. It’d be nice to be held. To be lost inside another human being. It’s been a long time since Dean’s felt that. “You can call me Shay, if you want. What’s your name?”
It’s not long before the nightshift nurses come in for their rounds. The curtain gets fixed so Dean and Layla can both have their privacy during the night. Dean’s vitals get picked over by a woman who’s not as soft as Missouri, but she’s got laugh lines around her eyes as she introduces herself as Kathleen. She asks him a bunch of embarrassing questions about whether he needs to take a dump in the bedpan, and then she tells him to try to get some sleep.
It’s sound advice, but it doesn’t fucking help Dean feel like he’s those little piles of rounded dirt worms shit out. And he’s tried all the techniques before: snapping rubber bands, drawing on himself with a red sharpie, taking a hot shower, holding an ice cube. Nothing’s ever seemed to work.
Dean can’t even remember how regularly he’s been taking his meds for the past week, and the idea breaks with a fresh wave of nausea, because that shit isn’t okay. Dean knows it’s not okay. He could stroke out with some of these meds if he stops cold turkey.
There’s silence from within the room. Cas and Sam look at each other. Cas turns back to the door and knocks again. “If you do not open this door, we’ll break it down.”
“Sammy?” And that’s Dean’s voice – Sam’s heart jumps into his throat, and he shoves past Bobby in the doorway without a word. He pelts up the stairs, Bobby’s shout of surprise and irritation echoing behind him.
Bite his lip so hard it bleeds. Blood in his mouth. Blood in his eyes. Blood running down his wrists. He just wants it to stop. Please, stop. Let go. Please, let go. Don’t hold him down. Burying him. Burying him alive. No room. No air. Dirt in his lungs. Can’t breathe.
Sam wrinkles his nose and looks so much like fifteen-year-old Sammy that Dean laughs. But the stab of painful nostalgia that comes in its wake is so powerful, it nearly makes Dean wince.
“So,” Charlie makes conversation as she works. Dean’s currently trying not to flinch as she gets way to close to stabbing him in the eye. “Your whole chastity thing doesn’t extend to being my wingman next weekend, does it? I think I need an all bets off, reckless, and filthy rebound to get my mind back on track.”
Cas smirks again, and he nips at Dean’s ear before he pulls away and faces front, “I would if you would cease being such a distraction.”
Dean packs the cooler again, stuffing their trash into a plastic grocery bag. He’s just about to climb to his feet to head over to Emma for a five-minute warning when his phone vibrates in his back pocket. He checks to make sure Cas has got Emma well-handled – he’s crouching beside her, calmly talking to her about why she’s not allowed to bring the ducklings home – so Dean pulls his phone out to check the notification.
– it wasn’t – I just… I just left feeling like shit,” Dean says, not wanting to tell her how his skin erupts into gooseflesh even at the thought of Nick’s body against his, or the delayed reaction when he panicked helplessly in his car afterward. “I feel like – like I cheated on someone, or something.”
Sam suddenly knows, like a punch to his gut, that he shouldn’t have left Dean alone. He should have insisted on Dean returning to the bunker, should have followed him in his car to make sure he got there alright. He shouldn’t have left Dean when Dean was alone and hurting and probably in one of his self-hatred freefalls. Because no one ever does self-loathing quite so thoroughly as Dean Winchester, and Sam should have stuck around to –
“What happened?” she asks. Dean just blinks at her for a couple seconds before he registers that she spoke.
,” Anna gasps. She fixes her eyes on them, and her gaze is full of livid, teeming hatred. “You tell Dean that Castiel is not coming. You tell him that Luca found out about them – and he shot him! You tell him that Castiel is dead!”
“Pretty please!” Charlie insists. She chortles and tries to tug at both his wrists. Dean twists away, but he miscalculates the amount of space on the loveseat, which is how he ends up on his ass on her floor. Charlie shrieks and lands on top of him. Her attack is relentless: “I was deprived as a child! I never had those fancy Barbie makeover head things! You have to let me! Please let me!” She gives up on trying to ply his hands away and turns to underhanded tactics: tickling.
“Dean Winchester,” Dean steps in, offering his hand. It’s the third time he’s had to introduce himself to a disapproving relative in the past fifteen minutes. He’s found being direct is the best approach. “I’m a friend of Cas’s from Missouri.”
Dean tries to latch onto Tessa’s voice. She soft and calm. She’s gonna be the last thing Dean ever sees. He won’t get to say goodbye to Sammy. Or Bobby. Or Charlie.
They’re all in the kitchen now, sipping beers, mostly sitting in stunned silence. Eileen is sitting next to Sam, and Dean couldn’t help but notice they’re holding hands, but he figures he’ll give them the night off from teasing; they’ve earned it.
“I don’t know if you’re too familiar with the whole concept of a one-night-stand.” Dean forces himself to keep talking. “Probably not, I’m guessing, ‘cause you don’t look like the kind of gall who’s getting much. Unless you and Marv, here, are getting down and dirty on his day off. But, yeah, we were both drinking. Fuck, we were probably both drunk. And we both wanted to have sex, so we fucking had sex.”
Dean stands from his crouch, and he immediately regrets moving too quickly as the room spins around him.
Dean picks at the corner of the label on his bottle, works it with his thumbnail and peels it clean off, all under Benny’s relentless gaze. And Sammy. Dean can feel his little brother’s eyes on him even stronger than his best friend’s.
So, Dean gets up on his elbows, careful of the annoying cast on his right arm, and crosses the remaining distance between he and Cas before Cas can say anything else.
“You’re not getting one with her, though, right?” Dean prods. “It’s just that I think you missed Riot more than you missed Amelia when you two split.”
“You know what you’re gonna do with the extra dough once you sell?” Dean asks between chewing a slice of meat lover’s.
He can’t see anything right now, because his eyes are closed, and if they were open, he’d just see the doctor frowning at him, so Dean figures he can skip that one.
Jack looks alarmed, but everyone else is very familiar with toddler tantrums, by now, and Eileen merely grins at her son.
“I waited to start the movie,” Cas says warmly, setting his phone down on the couch arm and wiggling to give Dean his space back. There’s a tug-o-war inside Dean’s chest: one half is warmed by Cas’s thoughtfulness; the other half really doesn’t want to deal with a date anymore. The happy fluttering in his stomach is entirely gone. Replaced by a crumbly cinderblock. Dean just wants to be alone, wants to deal with this new development without any spectators, wants –
“He’s fine, Dean!” Bobby cuts him off. “You know what he’s like on a rough case. Can’t think about anything else. And he keeps calling me to bitch about you because apparently neither of you know how to talk to each other anymore.”
“No –” Dean says hastily. “I don’t think you’re pathetic – I just – I mean, I get it. Christmas sucks for missing people. And I still talk to my mom’s headstone, and I was a lot younger than you when she died.”
Dean cringes in response to Cas’s touch. Just slightly. So slightly Cas wouldn’t have noticed it if he couldn’t feel the shiver through his own arm.
Dean takes his seat across the table from Lydia, Sam and Mick sandwiching him. There’s silence but for the distant ticking of a clock as they wait for Cain. Dean’s stomach is a tightly spiraling pit, whirling inward until there’s a solid rock of anxiety in his gut.
It startles something like a laugh from Dean’s mouth. Because, yeah, Dean knew what he was doing. He knew – for a long time he knew – Dean steadies himself with another breath, presses his teeth together.
“What’ll it be, boys?” a pretty waitress in a white apron and ballet flats sidles over. The conversation waylays from there to include whether IPAs are douchey enough to count as craft beer and if they should order a plate of the fried mac and cheese balls.
Does Miracle belong to someone else? Dean thinks, and it’s a punch in the gut. Are they steeling someone’s dog, right now? His hand scratches down Miracle’s neck, and his stomach drops again in relief.
Cas stops himself from reminding Dean that the shaking hands can’t convincingly be blamed on the medication, because it’s something he’s been dealing with for some weeks now. But Cas doesn’t think Dean would appreciate it, so he says instead, “I’m sorry, Dean,” because he knows it isn’t like Dean to be so candid about his pain.
At quarter-after three, Sam comes back into Dean’s room to tell Cas that they should go back to the hospital. Cas looks up from his phone. There is a white rectangle tattooed across his vision, and he blinks several times before his eyesight clears. He nods at Sam in the doorway, tucks his phone away, and follows Sam back out of the bunker.
“You don’t sound super thrilled about it,” Pam says with a cheeky wink. Might as well put out a news bulletin: Extra, Extra, Read all about it! Dean Winchester, depressed, useless as ever. “Unless mine ears deceive me. It’s been a while, right? It can take some time to get back on the horse. If you wanna work on that, we can. Setting some boundaries, making sure you can approach sex healthily.”
Sam finally looks at Dean. His eyes are narrowed, lips are pursed. “You really don’t know?” he says, like some kinda sanctimonious bastard.
, someone screams inside his head. And he knows, theoretically, how guys do it. The mechanics of it. But all he can think about is it hurting. All he can think about is how badly he wants Cas to draw back and slap him across the face, spit at him, tell him how disgusting he is, to think Cas could possibly love a filthy monster like him. A killer. A murderer.
“Yeah,” Dean says. Without even realizing it, he’s closed his hands into fists. His fingernails are a little longer because he hasn’t been great about personal grooming this week, and he focuses on the pinch in his palms for a minute before he makes himself relax. “Sure.”
Castiel can’t exactly concentrate on the show. He’s worried that Dean’s uncomfortable; he keeps sliding farther down the headboard, like keeping himself sitting up is too much work. Cas is stupid – he should have realized Dean would still be tired. His body’s still recovering, after all, and he’s probably trying to keep himself awake for Cas’s account.
Victor’s got one eye on the window. He cracks his knuckles on the table one, two and the two gangs move in tandem: one minute they’re yelling in each other’s faces, shoving each other over the counter, next minute they’re slapping each other on the shoulder, chatting with nice smiles.
While Dean drives, Sam triangulates the vamps’ latest targets, trying to find likely locations for the nest. Cas provides feedback and suggestions from the backseat.
on the side. “Oh, no, that was…ah.” He doesn’t really know how to explain why he has the mug. But he’s surprised to realize that Charlie is the first person he really wants to talk to about it. Maybe it’s just fair play: she talked to him about her asshat ex-girlfriend, so Dean’s supposed to tell her something personal now. Isn’t that how friendships work? A series of emotional exchanges?
“Cas,” Dean whimpers. And he doesn’t know what he’s asking for. He only knows that the kindness in Cas’s face fills Dean with dread. Because Dean can take Cas’s hatred. He can take Cas’s coldness. He can take Cas’s violence. But he cannot stomach Cas’s forgiveness. Dean thinks it will kill him.
“Up, up, up!” Micah squeaks, upset, tugging at Dean’s jeans. Moose normally makes him laugh, and he always loves seeing his littler cousins, but clearly the heightened emotions and unexpected visit have ticked all his bad boxes.
As soon as Cas’s hands are empty, he starts tapping his fingers. It seems to soothe him, and he stops rocking back and forth so violently.
Cas isn’t just damn sexy. He’s also wry and sarcastic. Dean knew all this before, but it’s established now that Dean’s spent an afternoon and evening with him. He also loves a good burger. What’s more, he’s never been to Conner's Diner, which is
He was silent and listless on the ride back, too tired to muster up a rant like he did after the last session, about Dr. Jorgensen’s stupid voice, stupid diplomas on the wall, stupid beard, and
subject. It’s ridiculous. It’s unfathomable. It makes his insides feel like they’ve melted into a pile of gooey slop.
“Not your fault, dude,” Dean shrugs. He wonders who Gabriel is. A partner? And then tells himself to shut the fuck up, because it’s none of his business whether or not Gabriel was Castiel’s partner because, even if he was – and that meant Castiel was interested in men – then that was still bad news, because it wasn’t like Dean messed around with cheating. At least not anymore. Not since he was trying to model healthy sexual habits now.
And Dean sure as hell doesn’t do chick flick moments. And this sure as hell smells like a fucking chick flick moment.
Cas keeps his hand on Dean’s chest, stroking slow and steady patterns against his sternum with his thumb. He can feel Dean’s heartbeat, too fast, below his sweatshirt. Cas’s back hurts from sitting still for so long in the hard-backed chair. His stomach feels empty, despite the warm bowl of soup he’d eaten. The other bowl Eileen brought in sits barely touched on the side table. Dean had managed a few spoonful’s before he pushed Cas’s hand away and fell against the pillows supporting his back.
“You’re coming back, right?” Sam whispers, unable to put words to the numbing, nameless fear that suddenly slithers through his veins, turning his blood to ice water. “You ain’t gonna do anything stupid?”
Bobby grunts in reply and flips out a switchblade from his pocket. His cane is leaning forgotten against the small, cluttered nightstand. He slices a stripe down the center of Dean’s t-shirt. Then he gets a hand under Dean’s shoulder, hauls him into a partial sitting position. Sam grits his teeth when Dean moans in pain. Bobby slides the ruins of Dean’s shirt off one arm and then the other.
Cas doesn’t know what to do to help Dean. He knows Sam is just as clueless. And Cas doesn’t know how to address the fact that maybe allowing Dean to come back to the bunker isn’t the best idea. Cas understands that neither of the brothers has ever been comfortable staying in a hospital, but perhaps it is the case that, this time, a longer stay is necessary.
“None,” Alfie says immediately, looking absolutely thrilled. He’s like a puppy. He and Alice remind Dean of Andy and April from
“F-fuck everything up,” Dean says. Sam’s words don’t quite penetrate. “The f-fucking de-deposition and – and g-got d-drunk –”
“Uhg, no,” Dean says. “Don’t remind me.” But he doesn’t mind her taunting; he’s much more comfortable getting teased about hookups than he is about makeup.
“Oh yeah?” Dean prompts. He understands all about shit families. He runs through everything he knows about Cas’s family: the jerkface older brothers and sister and little brother who only communicate with him over the internet, if that.
“Dean,” Cas insists, and maybe this time Dean will hear it. But Dean’s hand is trembling, very slightly, under Cas’s grip as Cas pulls Dean’s hand out of his pants, lifts it to Cas’s mouth. Cas presses his lips to Dean’s knuckles. He gently plies Dean’s fist open and kisses the heel of Dean’s hand, traces Dean’s thumb with his lips.
. That’s Sammy’s voice. The words drift lazily through Dean’s head. His body feels heavy and unwieldy. He’s drowsy and dopey and just wants to stay asleep.
“Hey, man –” Dean’s voice dies on his tongue when he opens his door and discovers it’s not Cas, but Sam, in the hall.
By the time the food arrives, they eat, and they shower off the day, it’s after one o’clock. Dean is so exhausted he doesn’t bother popping a sleeping pill. He crawls into the bed and luxuriates in the extra space, extra plushness of the pillows, and extra thread count in the sheets. The day has tired him out, what with the sustained panic of the flight, dealing with Luke, and the fact that he worked a six-hour shift before leaving. He drops off to sleep almost immediately.
“I can’t stand my mother,” Bela whispers. She hums in approval as Dean’s fingers dip below the loose waist of her pajama bottoms and finds the wiry curls of her pubic hair. He brings down his other hand and pulls at her pants. She gets the point and raises her hips so he can slip them past her hips. She’s not wearing underwear.
Lydia doesn’t look mad. She just look embarrassed. Which means maybe she isn’t planning blackmail, right now.
“It did upset me,” Cas says slowly. “It upset me that you were clearly distressed and seemed intent on ignoring it. It made me feel like you were pressuring me to do something neither of us were emotionally prepared for.”
Dean sets her down in his apartment while he puts the cooler on the counter to unpack later. No way is he letting Emma get ahold of her toys on the way to the bathroom. He’ll never pull her away without tears if she gets her hands on the building blocks.
Eileen gets that look on her face, the one where she guesses Sam’s not telling her the whole truth, and Sam’s chest constricts painfully.
Cas doesn’t say anything right away. Dean watches Cas’s silhouette against the night sky. He watches his Adam’s apple bob, watches Cas lick his lips.
Dad shook Dean, and Dean’s body was like jello. He just flopped, chin dropping to his chest because he couldn’t hold it up any longer. The world was awash with too many colors and sounds. Dean could still taste vodka on his lips.
Sam’s smile turns wry, but he doesn’t call Dean out on the dodge. “Maggie made me drink the rest of my protein shake.”
“I found this in my freezer,” Charlie explains sadly, lifting the vodka. “I bought it last Christmas to make boozy, minty-fresh hot chocolate.”
“So, ah,” Sam continues, like he’s tearing each word out of him, and the for the first time, Dean thinks it’s possible Sammy’s crying. It makes Dean sit up a little straighter in bed. “It’s six months, and I was – I couldn’t help but notice that it – it’s almost midnight.”
“Uh... yeah... we had, uh, fun. Talked a lot. Went home early. Us old folks just don’t party like you youngsters, ya’ know.”
Deans breath hitches as Cas gives him the filthiest leer he’s even seen. No! Surely he doesn’t mean...Cas starts unbuttoning his pants and blue eyes fix on his, head tilted.
“WTF Dean! You do realise this is basically non-consensual sex, right?! You deceiving him so he’d touch you, making him manhandle you in the name of... idk... stress-relief?!”, Sam says, pacing the room with both hands in his hair.
“Let’s add some losing Cas to that, shall we? Seeing the love of his life pierced by an angel blade, giving him a hunter’s funeral, scattering his ashes in a carefully selected place...”
“So sorry, Mummy. You hadn’t asserted your authority in 15 minutes there... one does forget ones place so quickly.”
Ooooooh, that’s all he needed to hear! No way is he passing up an opportunity to beat that son of a bitch! He’ll show him!
Sobbing. He's sobbing now. Feels like the world is ending, like nothing matters anymore. And guilt, so much guilt...
And then one day, a young man knocked on my door. Short, blond and the mirror image of my father. He told me how his mother had been an intern at my father's law firm. She was young, beautiful, impressionable... and my father took advantage. He promised her the world and left her begging in the streets as soon as he found out she was pregnant. As a last attempt to appease him, she named her son Gabriel, so all his children would be named after angels. He never even made any attempt to meet him. My blind faith in my father crumbled...just like that. And things were about to get worse.
Cas actually has the AUDACITY to smirk! He thinks its funny...Dean is drowning in lust and the angel is fucking laughing!
Gabriel took me in. No questions asked, no conditions. And for the first time in my life, I started thinking about what I wanted. WHO I wanted to be. Where my true passion lay. Granted, I got swept away by Gabe’s ‘Thank-Fuck-I'm-Alive-Tour'… For some time, I lost myself in hedonism. No longer burdened by others’ expectations, I felt free and sexually blossomed. Drugs, women, men... every sin that brought me pleasure was thoroughly tried and tested. And found wanting. I missed being a priest. Helping people, whether it be through religious guidance or simply being a helping hand... It was my sacred promise to mankind and one I could not leave behind.
Aaaand the moment is broken. Dean doesn’t know if he should be annoyed of grateful, really... He turns around and sees John standing there, drunkenly swaying, face like a thundercloud. Annoyed it is then...
Everyone easily made it to the Tabasco, but their numbers were dropping drastically after the Scotch Bonnet. When they brought out the Fatali -a beautiful white pepper- they were down to 3 contestants: John, Mary and Cas.
Dean walks into Cas’ cabin and sees him sitting against the bed. He's smoking weed, head thrown back, looking weary.
He looks up and sees Cas grinning down at him. That little shit... He gives him a dirty look and squeezes Cas’ fingers... hard.
Things are not looking good for John Winchester... He has now fucked up with BOTH his sons, made a terrible impression on his grandson/God and to top it all off: Mary left.
“What?! Why?! Let them find another priest! What does it matter who’s in charge here? Let’s just GO!”
He’s just about to agree with his dad and change the subject, when Charlie and Cas appear in front of them.
So, he just withdrew from the rest of them. Filling his days with manly things. Cleaning his guns, sharpening his blades, shooting cans from a fence, cleaning the guns again, his daily workout routine (death is no reason for slacking off after all), taking naps in his favourite recliner… the works.
“Yeah! It’s wild isn’t it? We were shocked ourselves when we found out. Didn’t know these things could happen. And, not gonna lie, it was a struggle... Cas started going into full dad-mode as the pregnancy progressed, but Dean... well, figures it would be hard for him. And then there was the birth! Pfff, that was some weird-ass day! We were battling Lucifer and trying to stay hidden from both the Host of Heaven AND the demons and suddenly there was an alternate reality... The birth itself was no picnic either... especially since Jack chose to grow into a teenager right after being born. And Dean... Lucifer killed Cas. Right in front of him. Man, I’d never seen him like that before. He couldn’t even look at Jack, blamed him for the whole thing. Then suddenly, Cas is back! Jack just... brought him back. I swear, the kid is amazing!”
Oh shit, she’s back! He quickly puts the panties in his pocket and makes a mental note to confront -nay, congratulate- Dean tomorrow.
“No angel, the pink ones...” He leans down to fake-whisper the rest in his ear, “The ones that make you go all badass-angel-of-the-Lord on my ass...”
Saturday comes sooner than expected and Dean is not ready. He’s not ready to tell Lisa. He’s not ready to have a romantic weekend with her either... He’s basically screwed. He keeps going back and forth in his mind... Why fuck up what he has? Why keep living a lie? But Cas refused to be together anyway... but... he felt so... liberated.
There’s a bit of soft laughter coming from their family. They’re all absolutely enraptured by the pure love displayed in front of them.
“He sure is submissive, isn’t he? Gotta say, Cas, you really struck gold with that one... I don’t know where he gets it? His mom? Not a submissive bone in her. Found THAT out the hard way... Hope he a bit more willing in the sex-department than she was. Not one for exploring either, ifyouknowwhatimean. Then again, blowjobs and anal are kinda what your sort does, huh?! No need to ask him for it, it’s always on the table! You’re one lucky sonovabitch...”
Oh, and he knows where she is... He’s sure Bobby welcomed her with open arms... Probably listened to her little pity-ditty like he really cares and agreed with her on every turn. Everything to get into her pants. Rat bastard... he already poisoned his boys’ minds against him, pretending to be the one that raised them, now he just has to have Mary too. What is he doing...collecting an entire set?!
As if that isn’t bad enough, Lisa’s now insisting on couples therapy with Father Zachariah every Wednesday. What the hell does a celibate, unworldly priest know about relationships. Especially one like theirs... shotgun wedding at 18 after a weekend of fun. 10 years on and well... no love to speak of really. Not on his side anyway. Lisa tries. She's convinced they’re just in a funk and things will go back to the honeymoon fase if only they work at it hard enough. She’s obviously forgotten they skipped that bit. They were never really in love. Dean was hardly even in lust. Back then he actively chased tail for one purpose: making his dad proud. Real men got the hot girls. Real men weren’t seduced, they did the seducing. Real men didn’t... no! He’s not even allowing himself to think it. Out of sight, out of mind, out of reality!
Cas arrives at the bunker and is immediately dragged to Deans room. Dean is sweating... he’s nervous and excited and feeling mischievous all at once. He needs to do this very carefully, so he doesn’t scare Cas off. Off course he could just ask him to throw him on the bed and finger him until he goes cross-eyed, but come on... like Cas would ever want to do that. Like he’d ever have a chance in hell with an actual Angel of the Lord. Cas, who gave up so much for him and Sam, who rebelled against Heaven, who did a bout of self-inflicted penance in Purgatory, who is still so naïve and kind... What is he, compared to that? Still just Dean... traumatised, scar-riddled, emotionally constipated Dean.
Sam throws his hands up in the air, “Stop! I don’t want to know!”, he makes a circular move with his hand, “all...this... it’s not healthy. Like at ALL! You need to explain yourself to him and apologise. Right the fuck now! If you want ANY chance at ever having a real relationship with Cas, you need to do this. Tell me you at least understand that?”
They don’t say much afterwards. They get dressed, exchange shy smiles... Cas almost hopes he’ll just leave without much ado. No such luck off course...
Dean lifts his head and even through the screen he can see those green eyes fixed on his face. He doesn’t get to finish his sentence.
He meant to say it with conviction, but it sounded like a question in the end. Cas leans forward again, staring into his eyes, tilting his head... *oh shit, that’s cute...*
“I want to. I want to be selfish and have it all. With you. But I can’t. It would go against everything I am... and you wouldn’t want me if I betrayed that.”
“Oh, Dean... your efforts in making amends with your father are commendable. You are, by all means, a loyal son and he doesn’t deserve you. But ok, let him come, I’ll be civil. I promise.”
Oh, hell yesss! Dean is 100% on board! He walks to the bed and gets on all fours. No time like the present and times-a-wastin'!
The angels Jasmin is smiling sweetly at him, the knife twirling between her fingers... he eyes it nervously.
He has no idea what to say to that. How does one explain this? Fuck... Sam’s not gonna like this, is he? Dean moves to one of the chairs.
Cas thinks back to the recent conversation with Sam. He’d been trying to avoid him. He was convinced Sam would see through him, would see the true meaning behind his antics. And yes, maybe his actions are a bit shameful, but it’s the only way he would ever be able to touch Dean... to pretend he’s his.
He reaches down and touches his hole. Man, that’s so strange... *Ok, time to be a man about it* He inserts one finger. *Okay nope! Toomuchtoomuchtoomuch! Auwch, fuck!*
She’s asleep already. God, she looks so peaceful...so content. He’s never been able to sleep like that. Always in a mode of constant vigilante.
“Oh! No! Nothing's really wrong, it’s just... look, I’m 37 now and I haven’t exactly had the healthiest lifestyle. A normal dude my age would visit a doctor and have a physical exam done, but I don’t know... doctors, hospitals...not a fan. Plus, I’m technically dead, so... I thought, maybe you could...you know...”
“I even know...”, Cas says as he suddenly straddles him and places his hand on his crotch, “what nice little things you wear underneath your manly clothes.”
He crawls down a little farther and directs his attention elsewhere. Hands are roving his thighs, while that sinful mouth suck his balls. Dean is basically lost to pleasure, lost to the miracle that is Castiel.
He no longer avoids them. In fact, he seeks them out, he WANTS to spend time with them, it seems. At first, Dean was optimistic about it, but Cas never trusted it for one second. And he was right.
He looks at the picture again. How did this even happen? 2015... what happened in 2014? Oh god... the trails... the fall. He was human. And Dean cast him out. Hell, if he did THIS, what else did he do?!
He finds himself panting, heart racing, eyes closed. Is he really ready for this? It's his final frontier...where no man has gone before...
“Claire Novak-Nieves. I have to say, I'm so glad to finally meet you! I’ve heard such stories about you!”
Dean is disgusted. This is how well his dad knows him. He didn’t have a clue his son was bi, he’s been disrespecting the man he loves, now he’s talking about his sexuality like it’s ‘just a fase’ and he thinks he’s a cheater to boot! He might have been a bit reluctant about Cas’ plan to make John suffer, but he’s all in now!
“Ok, Lisa? Would now be a good time for you? Dean can come over on Wednesday evening, as planned. If that works for you, off course?”
As soon as he’s gone, Cas goes to Dean and hugs him tight. He tries to fight him of for a moment, but gives in anyway and sinks into Cas’s embrace.
“Well, I’m off. Here, Dean, have a chair. I know you love this whole chick-flick-routine, but for fucks sake boy, you’re giving my son-in-law blue balls!”
“It did bring them back together in the end, didn’t it... Even if you did try to shit on their happiness, there’s no place they’d rather be than in each other’s arms. That's where they are right now, in fact!”
He feels his knees buckling and let’s himself fall back into the chair. From that position he’s got the perfect view of Cas opening his own pants and quickly jerking himself to completion. It doesn’t take long and the combination of come landing on his black, roman collared shirt and his head thrown back in ecstasy makes Dean's cock twitch in interest. What is this man doing to him...?
How did he ever deserve a girl her? He doesn’t know what to do... what to say. The silence stretches on until his wife gets up, takes him by the hand and gets him to stand up.
“Okay, Sammy,” Dean says, when it’s finally time for his brother to leave. Dean trudges back to his room afterward, despite Joshua’s suggestion he eat dinner with the rest of the residents. And then Joshua asks if Dean wants to unpack his stuff – he even lugs Dean’s bag down the hall for him, which is nice, but just makes Dean feel like shit.
Sam is at the desk, talking Dean’s doctor into releasing him early. But Cas suddenly wishes Sam was with him; it would be easier to face Dean with someone else by his side.
“Sam hasn’t even texted me,” Dean says. And, stupidly, disgustingly, his eyes are already burning. He really didn’t fucking want it to be this kind of session. But he’s cried in almost every session since he got out of the hospital, so it’s not like he should have expected anything less.
Anyway, as of now, I don’t have another chaptered sequel planned, but I do have another fic for this ‘verse: “winds of fortune,” which will contain a collection of one-shot scenes, codas, or timestamps that didn’t make it into the first two volumes. I’ve got the first scene – a short, simple bonding moment between Cas and Jack – that I’ll post some time this next week. After that, posting will be sporadic. But I hope you’ll stick around for it; I promise they will be a *wee* bit fluffier and domestic.
As soon as Dean and Cas collapse onto the cement floor of the bunker archive room, the portal fizzes shut behind them.
“Are you hurt?” Cas says into Dean’s hair. Breath warm. Soft. Rumbling up his chest. Dean can hear his heartbeat.
“What happened to what’s her face?” Samuel isn’t one to be deterred. His critical gaze lands on Sam. “Amelia?”
Near dinner time, Cas works up enough courage to go check on Dean again, preparing to get his head bitten off.
“Yeah,” Dean says. His throat is dry. His palms are wet. “Yeah, ‘course. I’ll, ah, talk to Cas when he gets home. We’ll plan on, ah, leaving early Saturday morning. Get there around dinner?”
“Get…Sammy,” Dean says with difficulty. The agony is his chest whorls outward until it engulfs his entire torso, runs up his chest. Whites out his vision. “Promise you’ll get him out.”
“No,” Dean chokes. “No. Don’t let them – you said you wouldn’t let them,” Dean says, and he looks right at Cas, and Cas looks like he’s about to cry.
“Suckers,” Lizzy giggles, and immediately Dean wonders if that was a word she wasn’t supposed to know yet. Oh well. She’s probably picked up worse at the garage.
“Well?” Dean says, turning to the less-hostile person in the room. He opens his arms to show Cas the finished look, feeling, admittedly, pretty stupid. But also kind of having fun. “How do I look?”
Dean doesn’t think he’s drunk, but he can’t tell. Everything is too bright, too loud, too confusing, all blurred.
Dean opens his door and lets Cas into his apartment. He finally releases Cas’s hand, and he immediately misses the pressure of his fingers. Cas propels himself forward and face plants into Dean’s open bed.
“Dean,” says Cas carefully. He starts rubbing Dean’s back again, very slowly, barely brushing Dean with his palm. And Dean wants him to stop and doesn’t want him to stop all at once. It hurts, the warring desires inside his head. It’s like the hellhound is ripping him to shreds again. He still can’t open his eyes. “I want you to know that I love you.”
Castiel does not know what to do with this feeling that’s been awakened inside his chest. Something that has been humming, virtually undetected, merely the size of a mustard seed for his entire adolescence. Something he has tried so hard to stamp out, to pulverize into dust so it never bothers him again.
“Is he still praying?” Sam asks quietly, not able to handle the silence. Trying not to replay the conversation he just had with Cas. Trying not to worry about where Dean might be or what he might be doing.
Her soft voice, her lips on his face, her finger inching up his leg don’t help. His heart clogs his throat, pulsing there like some animal in the midst of its death throws. The buzz of alcohol makes him feel bewildered and afraid. He isn’t supposed to be here.
And Dean wants to scream. One, because Cas says it in a way like maybe there hasn’t been a whole helluva lot of people telling him he’s attractive, which is, to be honest, straight-up blasphemy. And, two, because who the hell
Instead, he sinks to the floor. Pulls his knees tight to his chest and puts his face against his kneecaps. His slacks pinch where they bunch too tight in the crease under his knees. His dress shirt is sweaty and stuck to his back under his jacket. His tie is too tight, looped like a noose under his collar. He runs his hands through his hair and tugs hard. Hard enough he can feel the skin of his scalp move against his skull.
When he gets back, Charlie’s face looks bright again. The hair framing her face is slightly damp, and Dean wonders if she doused her head under cold water. They sit on the floor in the kitchen, seeing as Dean and Charlie already disassembled the dining room set.
He’s kind of glad Charlie’s there – this way he can’t just stand around and dawdle, psyching himself out of going downstairs to grab Cas from his studio. This way, he’s forced to actually walk out of his door and down the hall. His heart hammers as he trips his way down the stairs. Soon enough, he’s standing in front of Cas’s door, feeling a little sick to his stomach. His palms are wet. He knocks.
“Fuck you,” Dean says, and Charlie cackles. He knows she’s joking, but the tips of his ears burn. He wonders if she’s gonna push the makeup thing again. He wonders if he wants her to. But it’s one thing to wear makeup as part of a costume, another thing to wear it as part of his everyday get-up. Even for a date. Even for a date with Cas, who definitely wouldn’t mind – who has probably worn makeup multiple times outside of costumes.
“I believe you dropped this,” the guy says. His voice is deep and sandpaper rough. He bends at the waist to heft the box that fell on his toes into his arms. When he straightens up, Dean gets his first real look at him, and the first thing that manages to blare through the alarm ringing through his head is
Dean leads the way through the door. Charlie is silent beside him as they get into the elevator and make their way to her car. But her hand finds his knee before she starts the engine, and Dean doesn’t think he’s ever been more thankful to have her as a friend.
The ambulance is tight. Its metal walls and cold, sterile equipment, and the flashing monitors give him a headache. He can’t remember much of solitary, but it must have felt like this: confining and isolated and impersonal. No one there to stop him from looping the bedsheets around his neck and letting the weight of his limp body do the work.
Castiel wonders if Dean is trying to tell him that he’s uncomfortable in this place, that perhaps he does not enjoy being surrounded by so many reminders of a faith he does not have.
“Hey, baby,” she says, turning to Dean with an indulgent smile. “You just take your time, now.” She adjusts the canula under Dean’s nose, grabs a couple tissues from the swivel bedside tray and dabs under Dean’s eyes. “Ignore your brother,” she tells him conspiratorially. “He just doesn’t know the difference between worried and mad.”
But Bevell doesn’t care. She raises both hands to shoulder height in surrender and sits down. “I’m done,” she announces loftily.
this. Cas has witnessed many of these dark places, himself – but Dean always manages to pull himself out of it. But what Cas doesn’t understand is why
“Better, ah –” He swallows. “This mangy pile of rags needs a good bath.” He gestures to Miracle, who knows he’s being talked about and opens his mouth, tongue falling out in glee, and Dean’s stomach twists again. There’s a strange hurt at the bottom of his ribs. It’s a little hard to breathe through.
He can’t stop shaking and he doesn’t understand what the fuck is wrong with him and he just fucking hates this. Wants it to stop. Wants it to go away.
He never realized how cold the bunker was, with its stone floors and walls, the old and aching heating system that pumps stale air through the hallways. So, he’s got a blanket wrapped around his shoulders. He knows he looks ridiculous, but his blanket is comfortable and warm, and he doesn’t mind the extra layer.
Dean just stays on his hands and knees for a moment, gasping hard through the pain in his stomach. Cas is on his back, but Dean can hear him coughing weakly, so at least the son of a bitch is still alive.
“That’s Jack!” Ella suddenly declares. She bounces on her perch, and Dean tightens his hold around her waist. “He’s from the pictures! That’s Jack! He’s our big brother, Daddy Cas said! Are you our big brother?”
The GPS tracker in Dean’s phone lands on a motel off Route 36, about one-hundred miles East. And maybe Dean just needs some time, maybe he just needs a couple nights away to get his bearings.
“Oh,” Dean says, trying to keep the relief out of his voice. “I mean, ‘cause, I’d get it, you know? If you wanted to…um, leave.”
Lizzy smiles and nods enthusiastically, and Dean heads over to the food table, fishing under the tin foil for a piece of the brownies he baked earlier. Bess catches his eye from across the patio, and Dean winks conspiratorially and puts a finger to his lips.
Jack sits, cross-legged at Dean’s feet. Dean sees his throat work as he swallows. He looks so much like Cas. Dean had forgotten how much. Dean’s eyes sting, and he resigns himself to the fact that he’s just going to be crying off and on for the rest of the day.
The playground’s only two basketball courts, some monkey bars, and a tetherball pole, sandwiched between two buildings – a dry-cleaner on the left and a block of apartments on the right – and enclosed within a square of chain-link fencing. The Hunters are on one court. The Angels are on the other.
There’s flashing lights. High-pitched siren. Rushing wheels. Hands. Hands. Hands. Don’t touch him. Don’t hold him down. Please. Please let go. Can’t breathe. Can’t breathe. They’re burying him. Burying him alive. And he can’t get out. Can’t get out. Can’t –
“If you prefer,” Victor says seriously, “We can wait to discuss this with Sam this afternoon, but it isn’t going to sway my decision. And I can recommend we go over your head to get a 21-day commitment from a judge. But I don’t really want to do that, Dean. And I don’t think you want to, either. So, it’d be easier all around if you signed yourself in.”
Dean turns over to face the opposite wall, and he doesn’t say anything as Sam climbs back onto the bed to fasten the new curtains over the window.
“No,” Dean answers. “Sometimes – when he wasn’t drinking, he wasn’t that bad. But a lot of times he was pretty messed up. So, I – I mean, Sam needed someone in his corner. So I took care of it.”
“I’m so sick of this shit,” Dean says. There is a low register of anger in Dean’s voice, but mostly he sounds unbearably exhausted.
“Yeah,” Dean says. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Why the fuck did he even bring this up? “Sure. I considered it. But –” but Cas doesn’t want to. Dean doesn’t have to ask. He already knows Cas doesn’t want to be friends. People don’t want to be Dean’s friend. Dean’s even been avoiding Charlie this week because he wants to soften the blow of her inevitable betrayal.
“I’m okay,” Dean says. He makes himself smile. “I’m great. It’s just – big news. Kinda hard to digest.”
Dean swallows a few more deep breaths. When he’s done, he can open his eyes again, and the world isn’t spinning, but his whole body shivers.
Cas grins at him, and Dean avoids his gaze, but he can’t quite hide his own smile. He was twelve the last time he showed his arms in public.
Cas hums contentedly in response and goes back to staring at the back of his eyelids. After the commotion and anxiety of the morning, Dean’s content to sit in the slow quiet of Cas’s room, even if it’s a little weird to just hang out while Cas gets high. Dean will probably get a bit of a second hand buzz; it’s not like the window fan is great circulation, but if Cas’s mellowness is any indication, it’s probably an Indica, so hopefully Dean won’t go all trippy and paranoid this time.
“Hey, Dean,” a gentle voice says from beside him. Narrow, soft fingers stroke Dean’s cheek. He flinches hard. The movement twists his throat, makes the air stop. His chest seizes. He’s coughing now, hard enough to run tears down his face. “It’s me, remember? Layla. You’re okay, honey. Let them put the mask on.”
But then Cas comes around from the other side of the naked lady – he’s wearing a wrinkled, white dress shirt as a smock and carrying a palette in the crook of his elbow.
No. Fuck. No. Dean shuts his eyes. He can feel the dampness on his cheeks now. The tightness of his throat that precedes a sob. He catches Cas’s lip between his teeth.
Emma is officially on the move; she’s started crawling and scooting around on her butt, and she can stand if she’s holding onto something. It means Dean’s been following her in circles around Lydia’s living room, dining room, and kitchen, and even though she’s moving at the pace of a turtle, she’s still got Dean out of breath.
people before. People have always just told him. “I mean I’m – I’m, ah, like I take meds for – like mental stuff.”
“Ah, shit, sorry,” Dean says. He tugs out his Zippo again, flicks it open, and a flame dances to life, briefly illuminating the guy's face.
But Cas can’t help it: he drops his face and latches onto Dean’s top lip, nudges Dean’s mouth open so he can slip his tongue out, bumps the tip against Dean’s teeth, and –
He turns to meet Jack’s wide-eyed, confused gaze, and Dean realizes that Jack is even more out of the loop than the rest of them, because at least Dean and Cas got to read Eileen’s messages.
“Thank you for teaching me to dance,” Cas says at random. His voice does something funny to Dean’s guts. Gets them all twisted up and warm. “I don’t think I was able to say so before we were interrupted.”
Dean holds the smoke in his mouth until it makes his gums sting, then he breathes it out through his nose. The bar door opens, and a rush of noise washes out onto the street. Dean doesn’t even bother looking up.
Dean gets halfway through a cigarette on his fire escape before he catches himself with disgust and remembers he doesn’t want to die of lung cancer when his daughter’s fifteen. He stubs the stick out on the banister and flicks it over to the street, four stories below.
