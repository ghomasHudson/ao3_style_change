“Come over. Let you fill me— Let me fill you in on the case, and then decide if you want to help stop a murderer.”
“No, it’s atrocious.” Sherlock mumbled as he handed it back to John and walked to the other side of the desk to look through the drawers.
Holmes raised the pile of paper in his hand and forced a smile. He had not been looking forward to this part of the case. They were sitting face to face at the table in the rehearsal studio.
“We’re going to work on Edward’s posture; how he moves, how he walks. That should lead us to how he talks.”
Before Holmes could open the door, Watson took a chance. “Holmes wait I-” His words lost their way when Holmes turned around to glare at him. “I-I don’t-”
The door closed silently behind Molly, just as Sherlock pushed aside John’s panties, rubbed the tip of her fingers against the delicate skin, making them glisten before pushing her middle fingers in. Molly’s eyes went from John’s blissed expression to Sherlock’s long finger pushing in. It moved in and out slowly until John was moving her hips and meeting each thrust.
“No really, is this the barometer’s side effect? You become the world’s biggest dick after long term use?” John’s tone was calm and controlled but Sherlock wasn’t fooled.
“Loss is a loose concept for a Warehouse agent.” Sherlock continued. “So does the event of your death affect me? Think of it as another case, only you’re looking for the artifact to fix it. But your life; clearly I don’t need to explain the value of your life.”
Everything was cut short when Archie pushed through the studio door, followed by Stamford and Ms Hooper.
Holmes looked up at Ms Hawkins with wide eyes, and before he could think of what to say, he felt his mind go hazy. “What’s...?” He sniffed the paper and recognized the smell. “No, oh no.”
“Right.” John scanned the room, looking anywhere but towards the artifact. “Coffee?” He offered. It’s not like they had anything better to do until they figured things out.
Sherlock is sitting at a table covered with books, newspapers and old maps. There are shelves of books behind Sherlock. A few books are removed and wee see Santiago peeking through, watching Sherlock. John arrives with two coffee cups and a bag of pastries. Amy ducks until he has passed her. John sets one coffee and pastry in front of Sherlock before sitting down. Sherlock pushes the pastry away.
“I- I um...” John wanted to slap himself. He had trouble understanding what the hell was wrong with him. Had it really been that long since his last...
Lestrade crossed his arms. “I ran background checks on everyone. They all check out except those three.”
The soldier sat up in his bed, head spinning as he blinked at the daylight filtering through his curtains. More out of habit than out of actual threat, he reached for the Tesla under his pillow and aimed it at the door as he slowly became aware he was dreaming.
“You stay calm in dangerous situations. You have a natural instinct for things that are out of place. Among other things.” The man answered with chosen words. Watson looked at him sideways, taking in the fact that if he worked here, this would be his boss.
“They’re linked. And like the Warehouse, the building adapts to its inhabitants. The Warehouse adapts to the artefacts, and the flat adapts to the agents.”
Even though it was terribly romantic, and something he never would have been remotely interested in before, Holmes found himself blinking away tears when Jane and Edward embraced.
This left no time for Watson to process everything that Ms Adler had confided, not to mention what it all meant. As much as he wanted to pause and think, Watson had no control over how his mind went blank when he felt the length of Holmes’s thigh press against his.
Even though they had done this the last time, being relocated to the bed and fully naked with John lying on top of him heightened the experience. He had never felt this level of intimacy. It would have been overwhelming if John hadn’t been there with him, as they thrusted in tandem, chasing their pleasure together.
Not just any woman. A contract killer that was planted as a failsafe to kill Watson if Holmes ever came back.
“Sher- Fuck, I- I’m-” John’s words were lost as her body tensed, eyes squeezed shut before a long guttural moan filled the room.
With the best smile Watson could muster, he stepped forward and waved at the crowd. The few cameras in the room went off, the sound of flashbulbs taking Watson by surprise, but he managed to keep his smile.
John pursed his lips, fighting the urge to snap at him. He knew this artifact was sort of personal and that biting each other’s heads off wasn’t going to help. He was the one insisting they be a team, might as well lead with the example. “Well lucky for us, this artifact won’t cause the apocalypse, so there’s no rush. Now, how do we catch it?” John asked with a smile that started to falter when he saw his partner shuffle his feet. In all their time together, this man had shown himself prone to the most peculiar habits and a tendency to be brutally honest; but John had never seen him at a loss for words, and certainly not
Wilder was right. Morgan, or rather Moriarty, hadn’t cared about the movie. All those tantrums, those arguments about storytelling, the long speeches about the craft, it was all bullshit. He was just putting on a show, keeping everyone distracted while he orchestrated the takeover of the Hudson cartel.
Once he was showered and dressed, wet hair sticking out every which way, John went straight for the coffee pot, which he found full of a fresh brew. Surprised, he turned to see Sherlock sitting on the couch, reading the paper spread across the coffee table, a steaming mug to his right.
“Janine Hawkins and Frank Hudson arrived shortly after to warn the others of our arrival,” Jones continued a bit louder. “Moriarty ordered Ms Rosie to kill Holmes. Watson intervened, shooting first and killing her. He shot a second time, which wounded Hudson, then twice more in the general direction of the now escaped James Moriarty and Janine Hawkins ran. We’ve now determined that they escaped.”
. You are THE BEST. With your help and support my writing has improved SO MUCH. I am so lucky to have you in my life (also the best writing sprint buddies!).
Lestrade blinked, stunned by Morgan’s response. Lestrade had only gotten that kind of reaction from teenagers, he wasn’t expecting it from Morgan.
“I know, sir, but this is only for today and tomorrow afternoon. After that, Ms Adler will be there to rehearse, right?”
Morgan stood from his chair, his white silk scarf dangling left and right at the brisk movement, and started pacing. “I can’t work like this.”
Sherlock imagined John hitting his arse with each instrument, one after the other. There was something about John’s skill with the riding crop. It made Sherlock want to take his time, imagine John showing off, drawing patterns on his arse and back, making sure he would feel the pain for days.
The sound of a car driving by popped them out of their bubble. Watson looked uncomfortable then, turning away from the street.
By the last piece, Sherlock was sucking on two of John’s fingers. It was unbelievable. Hard again. Sherlock had never considered eating as something sexual and now his mind was busy figuring out what else they could do with food.
Holmes continued staring at him in the mirror as a slight flush creeped up his neck. Watson hadn’t raised his voice, barely used any force, he had simply
“Depending on where it is, I might have something to useful.” She answered Sherlock but kept her eyes on John, winking at him as her hand squeezed his bicep lightly.
Holmes felt a cold wave wash over his body, increasing the nausea and the numbness in his limbs. Something happened in the light diamonds, as if he had started absorbing them. Holmes looked down in shame. He knew why he had darkened; he was curious.
“We also had a few sets that came in late. And, well…” Ms Hooper bit her lip and looked uncomfortable. “We ran out of film quite often.”
“I didn’t realise your ego had and ego.” John shot back and laughed at Sherlock’s reaction. It reminded him of Mycroft when his little brother acting like a child.
Molly’s body froze into place, thrilled yet terrified at seeing John step into the lab. The sensation increased as she waited to see if Sherlock would walk through the door. Then she realised John was alone. It’s also then she noticed John was wearing a skirt.
John gets out of the car. He walks quickly from the parking lot to the boardwalk. Once he’s on the boardwalk, he slows down and takes out his phone. As he makes his way towards the suspect, John looks from his phone to what’s around him, looking left and right. The suspect walks past just as John was turning around and bumps into him. John grabs the suspect’s arm while his other hand pulls the suspect's wallet out of his jacket.
Adler batted her eyelashes at him, “I mean Edward is an idiot, and I’ve just run off angry, and now I’m standing here contemplating how much of an arse you were, and you come in. Is that about right, Watson?”
John’s nail trailed down his arse. it was only a light graze, but it felt like ice needles against fire. John’s message was clear: the next hits we’re going to be excruciating painful.
He finally sat down, lifting his gaze to the woman only to find she had left. He couldn’t help but feel a twinge at the disappearing act. His instinct was usually so on point about his surroundings. Having the man disappear in Qatar, people appearing and disappearing in his flat, then this. Maybe something was off. Maybe some time off wasn’t such a bad idea.
“This is a pawnshop, it’s like a museum, old-looking things everywhere; it’s a goldmine for artifacts.” Sherlock explained as he followed John.
“Yes. I came back, laid on the couch and told you to be ready by eight o’clock.” John blinked at him a few times.
“A tattoo that transforms people into suicide bombers, this just keeps getting better and better. So how much time have we got?”
A bit of hacking led to John’s military file. It confirmed Sherlock’s deductions about John being an Army doctor, but he couldn’t have guessed John was a Captain. Impressive. Discharged after getting shot in the left shoulder. Hm. Why wouldn’t John try to find work in a clinic? Was his need for an adrenaline driven lifestyle that substantial?
“He’s busy with the set change, he’ll catch up with us after. And he would agree this is a perfect chance to get information.”
John had just come back from work, Sherlock was at the desk, answering an email. John’s head suddenly appeared next to hers, curious. She stayed only a few seconds, but the odour was plastered in Sherlock’s nose.
John draped his coat across the back of a chair and stood there, his eyes lingering on his partner, watching him as he hung his suit jacket on the back of the computer chair and rolled up his shirt sleeves.
Holmes looked around the table worriedly while the room shouted encouragements at him. It was somehow endearing to see Holmes so uncertain.
“Yes, because the Farnsworth is made to communicate through any materials, no matter the thickness, or, say, a communication scrambling field, in which you are presently standing.” Sherlock stated before turning back to the screens. John looked down at his phone and confirmed he wasn’t getting any reception. He closed his eyes, attempting to control his urge to bash the man.
Special shout out to Zala and Kira for this chapter. It wouldn't have gone the same without you guys. All the love and hugs.
“No, that has nothing to do with...” John paused, concerned by where the conversation was leading them. “What, you don’t care if I die?” He was more preoccupied with the fact that he felt the need to
“We might need to fight off some of Holmes’s as well.” Ms Adler nodded towards the group of women straining their necks to look over to Holmes.
Holmes rolled his eyes and spoke to Stamford in a reassuring tone. “I’m trying to say that you’re an honest man.”
John’s shoulders sagged in relief. “Oh thank God.” Breathless, he looked for any sign that the sphere had started to dissipate. Nothing.
“Yes.” Stamford’s tone was hesitant. “The light shattered on the floor, and it caused enough damage to the set that we had to shut down while they cleaned up the mess, but it was so late in the afternoon that we just stopped for the day.”
“Please, stop, it was all a group effort.” Holmes said with a wide smile, gesturing to the crew. “Thank you all everyone.”
She wanted to hear her say it again and again, but she knew what John was asking and couldn’t refuse any of her requests.
“But doesn’t this require investigative qualifications to actually find the artefacts? I’m use to live fire, not looking for clues?”
“That’s Gary Cooper at the bar. He’s the strong and silent type. I think it’s because he’s too stupid to have a conversation that isn’t scripted.”
Without thinking Sherlock leaned in, nuzzling the base, enjoying the sensation of sparse hairs over the soft skin. He smelled soap with a hint of musk. Sherlock’s tongue peeked out, sampling a taste before licking a long stripe up to the tip. The task was easier said than done without a hand holding the base. John’s cock kept shifting, making Sherlock twist and turn to follow the movement. Having the head slip into his mouth was accidental but welcome. He closed his lips around the girth and sucked lightly.
There was still no movement from John, and it was making the whole ordeal even more tense. Sherlock cleared her throat and backed into the kitchen to wash up and gather herself. When she returned, John was sitting in her chair, arms crossed over her now untied bathrobe. Her bare legs were uncrossed, but still held together tightly.
“Is that what get’s you off?” Irene’s sultry tone broke the silence. Stunned, John turned to look at her. He wasn’t sure what he was expecting, but that wasn’t it, and from what he could tell, Sherlock was also taken off guard.
“Found it!” John heard Sherlock call from behind him. He looked up to see him wearing purple latex gloves, holding a knife with a glass blade. John put down the clock and headed towards Sherlock, not noticing that the smiling face had turned into a scowl.
“You’re seeing it too so it’s not my head injury...” Sherlock muttered, his eyes zooming around. “Well, it could have been worse.”
Edward and Jane harmonised the last chorus and embraced. Watson didn’t remember mentioning it this morning, much too preoccupied by Holme’s reaction. Yet it was somehow exactly as he had pictured it. Along with the memory of their kiss in Stamford’s office, Watson found tears on his cheeks as he watched them kiss.
“God this is tedious. It’s taking too long.” John heard Sherlock whine as he came into the office, walking over to the fridge to put the milk away.
“They cleared the crime scene, so Morgan wants the audition on set,” Stamford replied over his shoulder.
The loud electrical sparks covered the sound of John’s body hitting the pavement, unconscious and limp, shirt still fuming from the blast.
“Stop it.” Sherlock didn’t like losing control of his movements, especially if she was at the controlling end.
“I’m down here, your flat is upstairs with Sherlock. Your room is on the second floor. Your things should already be up there. I’ll be up in a couple of minutes with tea.”
From what they could tell in the corridor, there were four offices, two on either side of the back door. The corridor then led to what looked like a reception area complete with a reception desk and waiting area. The corridor then continued towards the shop doors, and stairs that lead to first floor above the offices.
“Because I saw you in the infirmary for the second time today and wanted to talk to you about that.”
Sherlock’s mouth opened but no sound came out. His back arched, toes curling. His left arse cheek burned in the cool air of the room.
“Yes, yes, perfect.” Stamford encouraged. “Everyone must be there. We’ll all meet back here tonight at seven thirty and we’ll take the limousine to the Cocoanut Grove together.”
“Yeah, yes, I’m…” Watson couldn’t shake it, there was something about those words, that melody. He turned to Holmes and as he looked up, his eyes lingered on Holmes’s lips. Watson could feel the idea slip away when he focused on how much he wanted to kiss Holmes.
Sherlock is hanging half out of the broken window. He is fighting with the shooter, trying to keep the gun angled away from his face. With an angry growl, the shooter pulls away. Sherlock quickly shifts to trip him. The cabin is so small the shooter hits the wall instead of stumbling to the floor, but still drops the gun. Sherlock dives to grab it but the shooter tackles him before he can reach it.
Stamford nodded and stood. “Thank you, Ms Hooper.” He smoothed his waistcoat and hair quickly and stood next to the desk.
He then went to check on Molly, an excuse to get a look at the blue haired clerk. They were currently discussing garter belts, which explained the bright red blush on Molly’s cheeks. Blue Hair was also innocent. Well, of murder, not of the drugs she sold on the side. It was something she started recently… Ah, recent divorce. Legal fees. Still not a murderer.
“That may be,” Holmes replied, “but shouldn’t I at least practice with someone with whom I have chemistry, as little as that may be?”
John looked up then and something flickered, something… dark. As if he was about to devour Sherlock like a fine dish. John flattened his hands on the glass counter, accentuating the pull of his black t-shirt over the muscles of his shoulders and arms. He licked his lips as he let himself lean closer to Sherlock.
“Huh. South Dakota.” Sherlock read out loud, zooming in on the location. John moved closer, half sitting on the desk. Sherlock looked at his partner’s reflection in the screen. Twice in one day, this man, this small deceiving man had surprised him and given him the key. He didn’t want to fight his smile.
“I can’t just…” Watson huffed and shook his head. “I understand the reasons why you asked me to rewrite it but… I can’t just make it happen. It took me three months to write the first time, and now you’re asking me to do it in three weeks.”
John’s hand guided Sherlock to his lips. The gentle kiss grew deeper as John’s arms wrapped around Sherlock, holding him close. The pace was slow, exploratory, soothing. It left Sherlock wanting more while John trailed his lips along his jaw.
As uncertain as it made him, given the urgency of the situation, Stamford looked ready accept anything.
Gently, Sherlock moved her hands towards John’s robe. She folded it open neatly, like any other sheet covered experiment, enough to reveal the dark red hair.
“Don’t move,” Watson said before Holmes felt his hands disappear from his neck and jaw. “Did you want something for the pain?”
viral artifacts. The point is, you don’t get infected, you get affected, but sometimes the effects are, well, peculiar, like glowing-”
Sherlock stared at the screen. Was John serious? Did he not realise Sherlock had been consumed by fantasies about tomorrow? He had never wanked so often in his life, not even during his puberty, and it didn’t even begin to scratch the itch John had created.
They walked down the hall of an office building, the setting sun shinning bright across their dark gray trench coats and fedoras as they passed each blind covered window. John watched their shadows on the opposing wall as they crossed each section of vertical lines and smiled. He didn’t want to admit it to Sherlock, but he really was enjoying his. It was incredible really, getting the chance to live out one of Bishop’s stories. He could practically hear the words in his head.
Watson was grateful Ms Adler was leaning on his shoulder, making it seem to the crowd that Holmes was singing to her. He was trying desperately to keep his face neutral, but he doubted his success. Hearing Holmes’s baritone voice saying those words, the way he was staring, Watson’s longing for Holmes was overwhelming.
Holmes shook his head, and was seething inside that he couldn’t tell. Her nonchalant reply didn’t help.
The already quiet room somehow became heavy with silence, before Morgan slammed the table with his hand.
“You’ve got questions.” Sherlock said as he sipped his tea. That mind reading thing was getting annoying.
“That’s quite a feat, getting yourself a job with Ms Adler. We didn’t even get the casting call to replace Anderson. Who’s your agent Mr Holmes?”
John couldn’t help but smile as he stepped into the room. Not noticing his few belongings stacked between the desk and closet, he walked directly to the bed and lied down on his back. As he listened to the sounds of his new home, he noted that his room was situated exactly over Sherlock’s. It could be an advantage as much as a disadvantage. Well he wouldn’t be around long enough to find out.
“WHAT?! Never mind, just go! Get the artifact! I’LL BE OK!” John told him loudly. He would get the explanations later. Sherlock looked at him a moment before nodding and running after the man, Tesla in hand.
“The DOCD” He said, flashing his badge. ”this is of the utmost importance; did you purchase a violin online this morning?” The creepy smile was long gone and replaced by an intimidating stare as Sherlock took a step forward, taking advantage of his height to loom over her. John tried his best not to seem completely irritated at his partner undermining him in front of the civilian they were questioning.
Just like the other night, he was so focused on kissing John that Sherlock’s body started moving on its own. Guided by its need for pleasure, his legs wrapped around John’s hips. His hands stroking John’s back and shoulders, letting his nails trail down the offensive shirt on his back. Sherlock wanted to feel his skin. Needed to. He started pulling at John’s shirt, tugging it out of his trousers while small moans of struggle escaped their kiss.
Just as John nodded, Sherlock leaned in and kissed her. There was a pause before the grip around Sherlock’s wrists lessened, her arms slipping down, off the wall and wrapped around John. One hand to John’s neck to deepen their kiss, while the other unhooked John’s bra as if she had simply snapped her fingers, letting it fall to the floor. Her hands ran up and down John’s back and sides before twisting them around and pressing John’s back against the wall. Molly’s breath caught as their position mirrored the one she had found them in the first time. Sherlock captured one of John’s breast with her lips as she guided the opposite leg up and around her waist.
“You sick bastard.” John choked. He had no idea what was about to happen, but he had learned enough in the last 48 hours to know that whatever that thing was, it was bad.
“This is good, much better than the love story we’re currently filming. Therefore, it should be made.”
“And even though the premise of the romantic arc is common, the portrayal of Edward and Jane, along with clever dialogue, brought a depth to their characters and to the story that culminated in a refreshingly intimate song.” Stamford paused to eye Watson and continued to read to paper. “Ms Irene Adler’s performance excelled, as always, but seemed to shine brighter by newcomer Sigerson Holmes’s side. He is a force to look out for. His charm and looks are enough to get noticed, but once he starts dancing it’s impossible to look away. Despite the recent threat of the Hudson cartel that almost ended the production, this movie is a must see.”
Molly wasn’t sure what happened then, but John’s knees gave out. Sherlock pulled her hand away and helped John straighten and guided her to the nearest stool. The one where Molly was sitting when John arrived.
they may be. Unless you use an artifact on him, but none of the artifacts on your authorised list would get any information out of him. So maybe you’re looking to do some shopping by coming here. Plausible, since this place is like a candy store to you. But how could you take out an artifact without us knowing about it. No, it most likely has to do with the GPS; not directly, but somehow linked. The simplest way to figure it out is if you give me your source. But you made sure to have a clause in your contract stating you were under no obligation to disclaim your sources because it would compromise you’re clients and threaten your company’s reputation. That being said, Ms. Adler, tell me:
“Yes,” John repeated more to herself as Sherlock pressed her face against John’s soaked panties. “Oh,
Even though John felt tired, physically as emotionally, the prospect of concentrating on finding an artifact came as a relief. He grabbed his coat and jogged to catch up to the office door slowly closing behind his new partner.
“I thought you would.” Ms Adler held her hand out and Ms Kate pulled a folder from under the table and handed it to her. “Here’s a copy of the contract. Look it over. When you’re ready, you know where to find me.”
It was overwhelming. He had never felt his body chase pleasure like this. His hand was moving furiously on his cock, while the other dug his nails into the skin of his arse. It made his legs tensed, his back arched off the couch, and his breathing sound like a constant moan.
“Actually you could learn a thing or two from Watson.” Rogers piped in, smiling at Jones then at Watson. Watson’s eyebrows rose a bit more as he nodded thanks to Rogers.
John wasn’t alternating. His hand landed exactly in the same spot, increasing the pain to a throbbing blaze.
“Ms Rosie was supposed to be here today.” Holmes muttered in his British accent while Watson finished tying the first knot.
“And I prefer it that way for now.” Watson felt his temper flare up at the secrecy, but before he could indulge his anger, the man continued speaking. “Would you like some tea and biscuits?” The man said with a quaint smile. Watson couldn’t help but look at him with disbelief. The stare that was returned brought back the memory of the threat. Taking a deep breath, Watson put his temper in check and let the man play whatever little etiquette game he wanted to play.
Ms Hawkins waited for them to finish before speaking. “Congratulations Holmes. We’re happy to have you part of the team. Let’s give Holmes and Ms Adler a last round of applause.”
Holmes straightened his spine, opened his mouth wide to stretch his jaw muscles, and nodded to himself in the mirror. “No I’m fine,” He spun to face Ms Hawkins. “Let’s keep going.”
“Are you trying to be reassuring?” John asked, his tone dripping with sarcasm. Sherlock’s eyebrows lifted to feint an innocent look.
Holmes turned away and ended up facing himself in the mirror. Now that he was neck deep in his undercover persona, and discovering the full extent of the work that would be required for this movie to be a success, all without getting caught, Holmes wasn’t sure if he was acting nervous anymore. Because like it or not, he had a better chance at saving Stamford’s company if the movie was good, and a large part of that depended on his performance in the movie.
She took drag and she thought. “All right. But just so you know, if I see you here again, I’ll have to shoot you.”
“I don’t need the details.” Lestrade raised a hand to cut Sherlock off. “Not with his area of expertise. Now go in there and behave or I’m taking you off the case for conflict of interest.”
John turned, eyes scanning over Sherlock’s face as he lifted his cup beneath his chin with both hands, slow smile blooming on his face.
Sherlock dropped his mouth open in shock, more flabbergasted by the implication that Mycroft loved him than anything, John having made that clear long ago.
“Really,” he confirmed, nodding in a nervous twitch, and Sherlock was already counting the minutes until they were alone again. “I guess we’re both the jealous type,” he added with a chuckle, and Sherlock laughed, catching the door as Harry pushed it off her fingertips.
John made to follow after him, but, just before disappearing around the corner, he stopped, turning back to Sherlock with a determined draw of breath. “Good luck,” he said, something infinitely more complicated than that passing across in his earnest gaze, but he was gone before Sherlock could even reply, let alone figure it out.
He bit his lip, fingers tapping erratically at his knee as he pretended not to be staring at the screen, and then lunged forward when it lit up, nearly losing his balance and toppling into the pile of sweets as he opened the reply.
“I- He’s always taken care of me,” she said, her posture growing determined as she waved a hand toward the locker room in another false alarm. “He never complained, but I know it was hard; I know he sacrificed a lot so I wouldn’t have to. He doesn’t deserve- If you’re not sure-”
“What, infiltrating a hipster club?” John chuckled, socked footsteps padding across the living room floor before he appeared, pushing open the door and leaning against the doorjamb to smirk smugly down at Sherlock.
He was tall, Sherlock noted as he stood, what little black hair he had left slicked back on his pale skull and a sharpened smile peeling over stained teeth. “Your Highness,” he said, even his words somehow greasy as his swept his hands out in an elaborate bow. “How wonderful to see you again.”
“No!” Sherlock cried, the ragged voice drifting up to his ears as if through water. “No, I-I have to find John, I- We can’t leave without John!”
He closed his eyes, drawing in and releasing a long, slow breath, fingers stretching wide as his fist unclenched. Rattling his head, he jerked the other sleeve of his blazer on, muttering to himself as he perched on the edge of his bed to slide on his waiting shoes, trying not to think about the cedar and clove left hanging in the air in Sherlock’s wake.
“The team is running much more smoothly with you at the helm, and he knows it.” Sherlock nodded in the boy’s direction, watching as he slid his phone into his pocket with a long-suffering sigh. “He’s not really angry with you, John. He’s angry at himself for not being even half as good as you.”
John met his eyes, the relaxing tension in his body signaling Victor’s disappearance over the crest of the hill. “It didn’t matter,” John answered with soft certainty.
“He will be your personal butler throughout your stay here at Lornesse. Anything you need, Dimmock can find it or find me,” Mrs. Hudson explained, and Sherlock nodded at the man, stepping forward and holding out a hand, Dimmock blinking down at it a moment as if not quite sure what to do with the gesture.
“Just a little,” John replied with a grin, and a peace settled over Sherlock for the second time that day, a warm heaviness of
“But you would’ve,” the voice interrupted, dangerous with calm, and Victor shuddered. “Did he threaten to kill you if he saw you again?”
Sherlock frowned, glancing over Greg’s shoulder to Molly’s shrug, but there was a first time for everything, he supposed. “Of course. Let’s head into my office and we’ll get started right away.” He gestured to the open door, and Greg started toward it, Sherlock dropping a hidden flick of his brows to Molly behind the man’s back.
“Oh, John! You’re the rugby captain, right? Don’t know why I didn’t put it together sooner, Mike talks about you all the time.”
They didn’t speak until they were in the observation room, Lestrade closing the door with a dull thud behind them.
“But why!?” John demanded, stepping forward in a rush, startling Sherlock into staggering a step back. “You never told me! Not really.”
Sherlock just smiled. “Nice,” he hissed, grimacing slightly. “You never say anything rude about anyone.”
John turned to him slowly, face stone and eyes narrowed. “Yeah, I can really feel that in all of your
second opinions,” she clipped, feet slapping back toward her flat. “Smartass,” she added in a muffled mutter, Sherlock raising his brows while John ducked a smile to the floor, and then the door thumped shut below them, the clang of a baking tray following thereafter.
John bowed his head, letting his smile curl a little more genuine on one side. “Enjoy your meal,” he said, shuffling a step backward before he turned, crossing the room to snake around the bar. “Hey, can I get a St. George and tonic with lime?” he requested, focusing his question on the tangle of dark hair tied up atop the pale neck of their bartender.
John wouldn’t believe him, not at this moment, not after all the other lies they still had to sort through, and Sherlock supposed he could understand that, nodding even as a bitter taste soured his tongue.
With that thought, John grew numb, and, by the time Sherlock returned to the room, he had everything packed away—both in the suitcases and his mind—and they were off, John somehow winding up carrying both bags.
Probably weight-related, if John were to guess, so he headed it off with a sharp, proactive mutter of: “Sherlock.”
It wouldn’t have been apparent to anyone else, but Sherlock knew his response time was a little slow before he replied, “Yes.” He swiped his coat off his desk chair, following John out the door of their dormitory and closing it with a click behind him.
Harry smiled, ambling toward him from the bleachers, where Clara was waiting, clearly giving the interaction some space. “What I said earlier. About not liking you,” she clarified, but it still didn’t make much sense to Sherlock, and he frowned, tilting his head slightly as he turned properly toward her. Harry’s smile broadened, and she looked eerily like John for a moment, her eyes twinkling with knowing. “I do like you, Sherlock,” she said with a nod, and the reiteration only made it more puzzling.
John froze, hovering in a hunched position that might have been funny if it hadn’t meant he was halfway to leaving. “No?” he echoed, and Sherlock closed his mouth, trying to steady his breathing in and out of his nose as his saliva turned acrid.
want to,” he breathed, tipping his chin to try and recapture John’s mouth, but John twisted away, not a rejection so much as a stalling.
She stalled an inch from his hand, licking her lips, and Sherlock held his breath, not wanting so much as a twitch of muscle to spook her back into hiding. Her nose thumped as she sniffed toward his hand, as if trying to smell his intentions, and then, slowly, twitched her mouth forward, taking the treat between her front teeth and hurrying back to her sanctuary of shadows to eat it.
They continued in silence for a time, alternating their throws until Mycroft was out, but Sherlock still had just under half of his remaining, and he was grateful for it as Mycroft drew closer, twisting off chunks providing him a welcome excuse not to look his brother in the eye.
“I…sleep very still?” Sherlock speculated, filing that away for further study. How had he never thought to research his own sleeping habits?
before you reach the end of the chapter, or at least the "Total Eclipse of the Heart" reference, because it will ruin your reading experience, I am not even a little bit joking. The playlist covers just the next few chapters, not all the way to the end of the fic, so don't worry about that.
dangerous option, Sebastian then turned to John. “He needs it, you know,” he sneered, but his eyes kept flicking warily to Sherlock even as he tried to glare. “It’s only a matter of time, you’ll see. He’s only good for anything when he’s
“No, I- It’s fine,” Sherlock assured, flicking his eyes between John and the invitation. “I just…don’t know what to wear,” he mumbled, frowning at the strangeness of the sentence as it met his own ears, and then his gaze was drawn up by John’s laughter.
“No, no ‘but’, no conjunctions of any kind.” He waved his palms between them, fending off the assault. “It’s only been a week! I’m not ready for...graph paper!”
“I can’t give you suggestions.” John shook his head, smirking over the chipped lip of his faded blue mug. “That would ruin the romance.”
“I probably know…someone,” he muttered, though, at a cursory glance, that appeared to be a lie. “You don’t have to stay with me.”
, and it would be all Sherlock’s fault, all Sherlock’s fault for letting him get involved, for not kicking him out of his room and his cases and his
“He was back ‘round the corner,” John continued, addressing Dimmock, Sherlock’s face too difficult to watch any longer. “Rob- Moran wouldn’t have been able to see him, and it was quite dark.”
Henry! He never shares his Haribo”—Sherlock snorted, tipping his chin up to watch John’s face journey through the past—“and he’s always wearing that
“Right.” Sherlock nodded, taking a few steps toward the opening back out into the café, and then stopped, glancing back to where John had been watching him go. His eyes narrowed a moment, calculating, and then he started to smile, the curve of his flushed lips quickly growing to a smirk as John darkened guiltily. “Yes?” he mockingly inquired, and John glared at him, grabbing a nearby rag and flicking it out to swat him on the arm.
“Oh, shut up,” he snapped, and John laughed, drawing up to Sherlock’s side as the detective stormed off.
“I will not stay thy questions; let me go: Or, if thou follow me, do not believe but I shall do thee mischief in the wood!” he barked, making to stomp away from Molly, who latched quickly onto his wrist, drawing up to his side as he turned.
, right!?” Molly squealed before continuing, and Sherlock let her, smiling softly as her voice picked up greater and greater excitement, and when she insisted on reading ‘just one more’, he nodded, even knowing it would turn into at least five.
Sherlock watched the heavy wooden door drift shut after him, uncertain what he expected to happen, but, when it closed, the click shook through him like a gunshot. With a jagged pant of air, he slid down the wall, his arms trembling as he wrapped them around his shins, burrowing his forehead into his drawn-up knees. Eyes closed, he listened to the sharp rises and falls of his breath, his body still unsure if it wanted to sob or be sick, but a decision seemed to be made when the look of hurt on John’s face flashed through his mind. With a singeing suck of air, he threw his neck back, slamming the back of his skull into the wall, his eyes pressing tight against burning tears as he breathed out to the ceiling. Opening his eyes, he blinked up at the strips of moonlight above him, interrupted here and there by a fuzzy shadow of the snow that had begun to gently fall outside. He shook his head, looking back down to his knees, and then he gave up, gave in, and pulled his legs in tight to his chest as a sob rippled through his frame, shaking loose the fear and doubt until only bitter shame was left stinging hot in his throat.
John chuckled, looking over her shoulder to take in the grim expressions of the students already seated inside. “Well, you’re welcome to that,” he chuckled.
“It’s in her desk,” Sherlock muttered, mind-reading abilities in top form as his hand batted John’s away from the bag to pluck out a crisp
“Stop, stop.” She rubbed her forehead. “Okay, I think that’s enough of that for today. Let’s sit down and focus on your character. We’ll work on your physicality tomorrow, when I find someone to fill in for Ms Adler. But tonight, I want you to sit in front of the mirror and say your lines. What you see in the mirror is what the audience will see. Work on your facial expressions. I want you to understand how a single muscle movement can change what you’re emoting. You’re trying to be real, not paraphrase reality like theatre.” Ms Hawkins raised her hand when Holmes opened his mouth to protest. “Spare me the monologue on theatre, just make sure you practice tonight.”
At the bottom of the stairs was a medium sized room with a central system that reminded John of the inside of the Tardis but without the console, just a large clear glass tube with purple goo glowing inside. At the far end wall were large steel gears covered in what seemed to be a cocoon like substance, only bright pink.
“Get out.” Was all Sherlock said, his voice cold, tossing her away like an old rag. He turned back to the computer, not noticing John’s worried frown. He had not seen his partner back out of an argument ever since he had met him.
Suddenly, Sherlock’s arm was released. She rubbed her wrist as she turned to an angry and very naked John putting the microscope back on the table. She didn’t mean to, but something red caught her attention in the corner of her eye and made her look down.
“So he was dead and brought back to life, now coming after you with a taste for vengeance.” Sherlock summarised.
“What? Why get me suspended in the first place then? Why not just transfer me? Or I don’t know; ask!?”
“According to the database, all the members had this symbol tattooed on their left shoulder blade. The tattoo artist, to whom this box is rumored to belong, was one of the leading members, Ignaty Gryniewietsky.”
Holmes paused a beat, and Watson smirked at the dramatic effect in the silent room. Holmes really was quite a showman.
John looked down at his coffee again. He should have figured it wasn’t going to be that easy. “I think we should go to the market together.” John tried to ignore how weird that just sounded and waited.
A few things happened simultaneously, and John noticed none of them. Sherlock’s eyes went wide, his mouth dropped open, and he found himself slipping off the door frame as the words registered.
Siger Holmes narrowed his eyes, searching John up and down before turning his gaze to Sherlock. “I thought you were done with this,” he said icily, and Sherlock flinched, ducking his chin and turning his eyes away.
“Sherlock!” Victor called out behind him, but Sherlock didn’t stop, already through the kitchen before Victor caught up, grappling at his arm while Sherlock fought to keep it free.
workaholic; no kids; no overactive tear ducts.” Molly shrugged, lifting her festive paper coffee cup to her lips. “You should be kissing my 60%-off designer heels.”
“Pretty much,” Greg muttered, and Sherlock puffed a disbelieving sigh, pacing toward the fireplace, a hand running through his hair, the styling forgotten.
He heard his sharp, waking inhale before he realized he had made it, his eyes shooting open as he made to bolt upright. He knew instinctively he had slept much longer than intended, but any further assessment of the situation was aborted by a blinding spike of pain in his head, swiftly accompanied by nauseous dizziness. He moaned, falling back onto an elbow as he lifted his other hand to grind at his head, willing the swooping feeling away.
“I didn’t say thank you,” he snapped, and John laughed, hands sliding smugly into his pockets as he turned, continuing away down the corridor.
John didn’t even change out of his uniform, gathering up his things and rushing back up to Kingsley House with a wave over his shoulder and a call of “See you tomorrow!”. He was trailing mud and grass behind him as he rushed down the corridor, but he paid it no heed apart from taking extra care not to slide on the corners, and then he stopped outside the door, calming a little as he pushed it gently open.
“No, but I do insist,” he replied, the glow of a streetlamp captured in his eyes as he smirked, walking toward the slowing taxi. “My grandmother would roll over in her grave if I didn’t at least offer coffee or something.”
The attendant, notably more relaxed with Sherlock safely sequestered, approached John, standing in front of him and wringing his hands as he leaned down. “Is there anything you’d like me to bring in, sir?” he asked in short, nervous tones.
“I’m gonna go- er- grab some ice. For your head,” he muttered, avoiding eye contact and gesticulating much more than normal.
Slowly, he lifted a hand to his cheek, swiping across the tear-slick skin, and then blinked back up to his brother, a sob steadily climbing up his throat. “Mycroft?” he whimpered, unsure what he was asking, or how many things he was asking at once, but, regardless, his brother didn’t seem to have an answer, his expression crumpling with pain as he lifted a hand to the back of Sherlock’s head, pulling him in to his chest.
“I dunno,” he murmured, and then his expression fell, mouth curving down as he blinked, a thoughtful wrinkle forming between his brows. “Probably be better off,” he said, looking up at John with a glass smile, and John frowned, puzzled.
you won’t walk right for a week. And not in the fun way,” he added, shaking his head in false commiseration.
Mycroft Holmes, hammer of the British government, a man seven years his senior who needed only to snap his fingers and someone halfway around the world would drop dead,
It had been five years since then, Sherlock now 28 and on everyone’s top-whatever under-whatever lists, but Irene was 31, so he thought that ought to have dragged their average up. He wasn’t allowed to say that in interviews anymore though, for whatever reason.
“You can feel however you like,” Sherlock said, scratching a note on the page and lifting a small smile, “but, no, I don’t normally ‘stalk’ clients. But I also normally have more than three weeks.”
Bright images of innocuous objects looked up at him, angle upon angle of chairs, couches, bookcases, desks, and-
“Idea, thought, notion, inkling, whatever you want to call it, just tell me!” Sherlock looked positively rabid, and John vowed to make him sleep that night, even if he had to slip sleeping pills into his water.
Lestrade gave him a doubtful look, but then leaned in further, watching Sherlock’s strokes across the screen. “What did he do? When you told him?”
John sighed, finally resigned. “Fine,” he said, lifting his hands. “You can hammer in the nails for this row. But I am
Two bags of popcorn later, they were done, John somehow getting stuck with carrying the box back up the stairs, but it wasn’t heavy, and they were apparently just in time, Irene flitting over to help them unload while informing them she’d had three people come up and ask if there was more already. The two of them didn’t want any more, however, and simply settled back down on the beanbag chairs, talking idly while the remainder of the movie rolled on unheeded in front of them.
“So they have to hold a special pissing contest in the middle of December?” Sherlock tugged his scarf farther up his face, a difficult task with the dexterity of his fingers lost to mittens.
“Er, my-my dad taught me,” John murmured, turning back to the sergeant, but not before he noticed Sherlock freeze halfway out the door. “Put me through self-defense too. Wanted to make sure I could defend myself. He was in the military,” he added by way of explanation, shrugging and hoping Lestrade wouldn’t notice his discomfort.
Harry chuckled, a smile curling at Sherlock’s lips in response. “Yeah, I- Thanks,” she muttered, and Sherlock started to slow down again.
“I’m sure I’ll see you around,” she said in farewell, her eyes glinting with mischief as Sherlock’s face turned to stone at her back, but John only nodded, smiling blithely back.
“Why?” Sherlock asked, rolling onto his side, phone held over his free ear. “Did you expect him to react negatively?”
“No harm done,” she assured with a smile, the warmth faltering in her eyes as she glanced back over her shoulder. “I don’t suppose you heard anything, then?” she questioned, and though Sherlock had hoped to get away unsuspected, he was not one to lie.
“Isn’t there supposed to be some sort of…mourning period?” he spluttered, waving a hand in front of his chest, but John only smiled.
John swallowed, looking down at the holey toes of his socks where they protruded from the navy pajama bottoms. “Didn’t wanna wake you,” he murmured, and Sherlock shrugged a shoulder.
Sherlock looked up abruptly, clearly shocked, but the surprise quickly gave way to narrow-eyed suspicion.
Sherlock sighed, dropping the phone to his lap a moment. He could hear John saying it in his head, hear the unyielding tone clipping over his name like he had a thousand times before, and he knew it would do no good to lie.
“I’m using a lab around the corner for my thesis research,” he explained, and John’s lips parted in comprehension as he nodded.
“Excellent!” Irene chirped, clapping her hands twice beneath her chin before elegantly lifting her mug to her lips. “It’s a date,” she added, exchanging a look over her cup with Molly, who stood up before John could properly fix her with a glare.
“Ay, there he is!” Greg announced, throwing his arms out as he stood, the rest of the room turning to look as the older man swept around the table to sling an arm around John’s shoulder. “The man of the hour!”
“Not much,” she admitted, shrugging as she walked across the carpet. “Just what Moran said when he was back in here the other day. Sherlock, you have to-”
Suddenly, his jeans buzzed in his hand, and he wriggled his mobile from his pocket, finding a text message had just come through. Flipping through the phone with one hand, he wrangled his jeans on with the other, seeing that Molly had left him five messages already, and he swiped her contact name, pinning the phone between his ear and his shoulder as he fastened the trousers.
Clara laughed, Harry rolling her eyes, but she smiled a moment later, stepping forward to wrap her arms around her brother’s neck.
“Oh,” Sherlock started, suddenly placing the face now that he could see it properly, or, more specifically, now that he could see John’s eyes, the blue just as piercing now as whenever he’d turned around to check the time in their organic chemistry lecture, his seat three rows up and four to the left. Which Sherlock remembered for some completely innocuous reason he would come up with later. “Right, I- Yeah,” he muttered, smiling as he firmly commanded his brain to pull it together. “You do look a bit familiar,” he added with a nod, and John grinned, the gesture seeming strangely sadistic as it twisted Sherlock’s stomach into knots.
Sherlock smiled as he nodded, an olive branch of a gesture that was not returned. “Thank you, Anderson,” he amended, his tone falling flat as he gave that endeavor up as a lost cause, but it was hard to feel wrong-footed by the initial show of indifference when Mrs. Hudson was beaming like he was the second coming, stepping out of a small cluster of people all dressed in a similar black-and-white fashion.
Sherlock puffed a laugh, shaking his head even though John couldn’t see it, but he needed the time to swallow around the lump in his throat. “Nothing, I’m fine, I just-“ He faded away, the words that should follow foreign to him, but John, as always, understood, and chuckled softly.
Lestrade was having trouble standing at this point, bracing himself against the corridor wall as he clutched at his sides.
“Are you alright?” John asked, moving to his side, his head tilting concernedly. “You look really pale.”
“It’s not like I have my lines memorized or anything,” Mary offered with a small smile, and that did make him feel a little better. “I just don’t think we’ll really know how much work we have to do until we give it a shot without reading.”
“He doesn’t get paid for this or anything, ya know,” she continued, her deductive skills apparently not registering John’s furious glare. “He
“Yes and no,” John said, bobbing his head side-to-side. “I guess he had a dog when he was younger, and he named it after the pirate. I asked his brother about it after I figured out what he was saying.”
Sherlock’s smirk was wicked. “Spoilers,” he crooned, flicking his eyebrows, and then left to a soundtrack of Mike’s raucous guffaws.
“Oh, right, my mistake,” John muttered, nodding with his eyes fixed forward. “I forgot you have to be dating
Sherlock smiled, sweeping an arm up the narrow walkway leading to the front steps. “After you,” he beckoned with a small bow, and John rolled his eyes, muttering under his breath as he stomped toward the door, unaware of Sherlock grinning at his back.
“I only picked people who hadn’t seen him before,” his brother continued, gaze heavy with questions Sherlock would avoid answering. “Everyone here just thought he was another agent, Agent-”
“I mean to say,” he rambled on, leaning back to brush a hand through his curls, “you could always stay with us. At the Manor. I mean, I know I wasn’t exactly
“But why do we want them to be able to tell it was staged?” John asked, but picked up his shoes from beside the door nevertheless. “Doesn’t that defeat the purpose of staging it?”
“That’s stupid; I wouldn’t want you to do that.” John shook his head, frowning across the table. “What about if you have guests? What would you wanna do then?”
Sherlock stared after him, perplexed for not the first time that day, and wondered just how many times he would misjudge John Watson before he finally figured him out. Hopefully, it wouldn’t take much longer; he was growing quite tired of being less-than-completely correct.
“Yeah, well, I couldn’t fit much else,” John replied, still thoroughly oblivious as he leaned back in his chair, “so it was just a lot of ‘Be Mine’ and ‘XO’, and then a couple people wanted their names.” He shrugged, thankfully looking out the window as Sherlock’s head snapped up in alarm, heart leaping into his throat with tentative hope.
Sherlock turned thoughtful for a moment, mouth slowly pulling down. “Alright,” he eventually agreed, nodding. “We should get go-” He reached past John for the doorknob, but John batted his arm away.
John reached into his rugby jacket pocket, grinning with proud triumph at the pure surprise on Sherlock’s face as he produced an ID card. Without a word, he swiped it to a chime and a green light, pushing open the door with a stretched arm before waving Sherlock in ahead of him. “After you,” he chirped, not caring how smug it sounded.
Though John had heard Sherlock say he was 18 on the phone, something within the man’s cadence had led him to imagine an early admission into some top-tier university, or a child prodigy already teaching graduate physics at Oxford. The worrisomely thin student before him, skin stretched pale over too-long limbs, was somewhat at odds with that image, but, then again, no one ever believed John was 19 either—at least, not without a healthy helping of scruff.
“Right, everybody gather ‘round! I’m gonna call you off!” Coach Powles yelled, and Sherlock turned, watching as the team lazily grouped together. Coach Powles droned through the names, most of which Sherlock still hadn’t bothered to retain, but his ears instinctively found his own.
“She’s not a babysitter,” he said, smirking as he perched on the edge of the bed beside Sherlock, “and, yes, you do.”
“I don’t know how much Sherlock’s told you, but I’ve made something of a name for myself. They don’t call me ‘The Whiphand’ for nothing.” She giggled at what John was sure was a rather mortified expression. “The point is, there’s no actual sex involved,” she finished bluntly. “People pay me to tie them up, to give them pain, to
. It still makes people happy. It’s still love, man, LOVE IS LOVE!” she’d cried, attempting to toss her hands in the air but only chopping Sherlock in the throat, and then they were all on the floor, pissed and laughing at the sheer dumb luck of it all.
“Oh my god,” he wheezed, covering his mouth with a hand and trying to rein it in. “What would that even
to ask you to spy on him,” he added hastily as John opened his mouth, “merely to keep an eye on him. I meant what I said, about talking to me first.” Mycroft grew serious, and John imagined he saw a glimmer of real concern cross his face. “Sherlock can’t go running off half-cocked into this one. He needs to let someone else, namely me, take the lead this time. And I need your help ensuring that happens.”
“Lie the fuck down,” he grumbled, pushing lightly at Sherlock’s shoulder, and Sherlock obediently fell back, laughter slowly waning as he felt John moving between his legs, another crinkle of plastic as the lube packet opened.
“Oh, we can’t tell you that,” Mrs. Hudson chuckled, apparently unaware of the volatile atmosphere, or perhaps just too accustomed to it to care. “It wouldn’t be fair. Now, John.”
It was late January, a faint dusting of snow frosted over the ground outside the foggy window, and Sherlock grimaced at the bare branches whipping in the wind, an ill omen for the rugby practice later that evening. Maybe he could get out of it if he shivered enough, but John had caught on to that trick last week and started bringing along an extra coat and mittens to rob Sherlock of the excuse. Where he got the mittens, Sherlock would probably never know, but he smirked rather smugly every time Sherlock was forced to put them on, so Sherlock was probably going to have to buy his own protective gear soon enough. Not mittens though. Gloves. With fingers. Like a grownup.
“I wanna lie down,” she said, buckling herself in before tipping sideways onto the haphazard pile of John’s things. “And can you drop me off first? Sherlock knows the way.”
“Before you finish that sentence, I feel I should remind you I am an officer of the law,” Lestrade interjected, and they stared mutely at one another for a moment before Sherlock cleared his throat.
He’d gone to bed hours ago—11:54, to be precise—after the second most brutal verbal beating of his life, Sherlock taking top honors, of course.
Sherlock glared at him, the startled thundering of his heart fading into a steady thrum of fury. He’d tried to get John back all night, drifting in and out of vivid nightmares as the looping voicemail played out darkness and heralded dawn, but he’d never reappeared. Not until now, anyway, and seemingly only to tell him off. “What do you know?” Sherlock snapped, and John chuckled as he pushed free of the doorframe, sidling into the room.
He groaned, collapsing his face into his hands. He didn’t have it in him to be any worse, he knew that much, at least. It was hard enough being as standoffish as he was now, but he couldn’t just stop. Sure, Sherlock did find his eyes drawn in John’s general direction a little more than normal, and maybe he did check the common room when John was studying to make sure he was still doing so unaccompanied, and perhaps he had waited to get another notebook for his experiments until the day John was having coffee with Mary, but just because this was the most frustratingly difficult thing he had ever had to do didn’t mean he could go back to normal. There was John’s safety to consider! What did it matter if his vision swam a little red every time he smelled perfume on John’s rugby jacket, or found a long, blond hair on the back, as if Mary had been wearing it, had had “Watson” stamped across her back like he belonged to her at all.
John’s attitude had changed when she came back from work the following day. Clearly, she had been complimented on her hair several times, Sherlock could tell by how she had strutted into the flat and took off her coat, flipping her hair as she greeted Sherlock. She seemed to be flipping her hair a lot now. And more smiling. Apparently, John liked the extra attention she was getting at work.
“No, by spreading butter with it. Of course by playing it! Instruments can tap easily into the player’s emotions. I guess that’s where the saying “music of the soul” would come from. It’s more about the brainwaves synchronising with the instruments vibrations, but there isn’t much research worth reading in that field, not until human testing is legalised.” John closed his eyes and chose to ignore what the man was implying before he had had a chance to finish his first cup of tea.
They stood there a moment, staring at each other in the entrance hall growing more and more crowded. The sounds of the shops preparing for the work day filled the silence between them.
As they stepped into the Warehouse, John blinked a few times as his eyes adapted to the return of color, which was comforting in a sense. He was relieved to be back and pleased to see he was wearing the battery pack and still holding the elephant.
“In the paper.” He pulled a copy of the Hollywood Reporter out of the inside pocket of his trench coat and tossed it to Stamford. “This movie was the talk of the town when you managed to book the most sought-after actress in Hollywood with the most controversial director. Just that was enough to get the rumour-mill going. Add to that the leading man accidentally falling to his death during dress rehearsal of the finale number, and the papers would be all over it like a moth to the flame. The curse story was a nice touch, adding just the right twist to make this production the talk of the town. It’s such a perfect set up for fraud, I couldn’t have written it better myself.”
“Did you want some more?” Holmes asked Ms Adler, pointing to the half-eaten piece of chocolate cake.
Ms Adler smiled mischievously. “Because your performance will be better if you mean what you’re singing.”
“She’s sending us out on a wild goose chase, can’t you see it?” His brother argued, ignoring the threat.
He spun around and standing in the doorway they had gone through to access the balcony, he saw the man that disappeared in Qatar.
“Unless you have anything useful to say, I fail to see why you’re still here.” Sherlock told her, his tone like acid. But John could see how it amused her. It was nice having someone who understood how to deal with Sherlock. Not that John couldn’t handle him, but it was nice to get a break.
“About the Warehouse. We don’t exist.” He answered, turning his head lightly to speak over his shoulder. John remembered Mycroft’s words during their first meeting. Absolutely no disclosure.
“That’s not the point!” The former soldier didn’t know what he could possibly say to make his partner understand. “Every time we talk about a plan, well, no, I talk, you look around with a smart look on your face; you just disappear and leave me to figure it out alone.
“You have to think of your body as transport. Over the years the Warehouse has developed many ways to preserve former agent’s contributions and pass them on to the next generation. So even though there are artifacts that heal or bring the dead back to life, as long as we can preserve consciousness, that’s all that really matters.”
“So you understand the concept of the relationship between a Dom and a Sub? The trust, respect, and communication that is involved?”
“Apparently not. It moved. Damn computer! Why can’t you follow it!?” Sherlock slammed his hand against the desk.
are you here?” Sherlock’s eyes were boring holes into the woman. She simply smiled at the agent, her eyes shining bright. John could feel his heart racing. He didn’t know what it was about this man when he did whatever the hell he just did. But he couldn’t take his eyes off his partner, his eyes fierce, sharp as he waited for an answer.
When the man ran past the alley they had just cut through, Sherlock sprang out and tackled him. John caught up and saw them struggling on the ground. Sherlock was still holding the knife. The man knocked it out of his hand onto the sidewalk. As John moved to get it, the man kicked his legs and tripped him. Before the soldier he knew it, he was on the ground, seeing Sherlock get an elbow to the face and the man crawling to grab the knife.
It was fascinating, how those words made Sherlock heady. Judging by that sly smile, John enjoyed the effect as well.
Watson’s breath caught, and he wished so very much that they weren’t the centre of attention in the middle of a very posh restaurant.
“You mean besides the fact that it will protect the world?” The man answered, holding the soldier’s stare. “I saved your life.” The man said smugly. Watson hated himself for being so honorable. He considered his options before speaking. It was much simpler to go back, but this man didn’t look like he would leave without a fight, even if he was tied up. And he wasn’t up to learning the man’s training the hard way. Watson could knock him out and carry him back, but that would slow him down considerably and put him in danger of missing the chopper. He stared at the man sternly before speaking.
Watson laughed, but he felt rather bitter about it. He wished he could be more helpful with the investigation, but it was no use. Tripping or hitting someone with his cane was the extent of his usefulness.
Sherlock heard the man’s jaw crack under the force of the punch, and the sound of his head hitting the wall on his left. His body slid against it and crumbled to the floor, unconscious, the artifact falling limply from his hand.
Chester looks over his shoulder towards Sherlock. When he turns back he gets tackled by John. They wrestle on the deck. John manages to hold Chester face down with his arm twisted behind his back when the towboat motor starts. It distracts John enough for Chester to break free of John’s hold and knock him out.
“Okay.” Dimmock thought a moment. “Maybe… mostly piano, a few strings for the dancing bit, but still end with something soft for the kiss?”
Lestrade leaned his elbows on his desk and took a long look at Sherlock. He didn’t look angry, which was a good thing, but he had this glint in his eye that Sherlock was weary of.
“Yes.” Watson could feel his chest ache at Holmes’s wounded tone. Watson took a step forward, took Holmes’s hand in his and looked up. “Sherlock, I swear, I will explain everything tomorrow.” Watson’s eyes dipped down and look away as soon as he felt this melody slip away. He had to go before he lost himself in Holmes.
“Sherlock!” John screamed as he ran, both hands pushing his partner away as his legs propelled him into the air, effectively shielding him with his body.
What had he done? He had forgotten about the case. Had let himself, no, insisted on getting spanked by John. He was
Holmes fought not to turn to her, fought not to let his concern show. He had assumed this was an act, but if even Ms Adler had no idea what was going on and did not seem to be lying, things could take a turn for the worst. Namely another deadly ‘accident’ on set.
“The universe is rarely so lazy.” Sherlock countered. He took one last look at Irene, his face looking as if he smelled something foul, before he turned back to the computer to continue working. The woman turned to the new agent and offered her hand.
Stamford turned to Ms Hooper, who nodded and stepped out of the conference room. She returned a few minutes later with Holmes and a blush on her face. He had changed into a black suit with a purple shirt, the dark colour contrasting beautifully with his pale complexion. His hair, rather than being combed back, was now in curls falling around his face, accentuating his cheekbones.
“I, I did, yes, but, disease outbreak? What’s going on, what happened?” Mrs. Turner’s voice was slowly becoming distressed.
“If you want a smooth mission, you should put Watson in lead.” Neeson continued, clearly looking for a reaction from Jones. Watson kept a straight face at the comment, but couldn’t help his eyebrows rising a bit.
Ms Riley knocked on Ms Adler’s door. It opened, a dress was thrust into her arms, before closing once more. Ms Riley sighed, rearranged the dress over her forearm as she sidestepped to the next door on the left, Anderson’s dressing room. She looked over her shoulder quickly, rearranged her cleavage and knocked. There was some ruckus inside before the door opened.
John ignored Sherlock’s know it all tone to point out the obvious. “Do you happen to have an artifact that can dump a giant vat of ice onto that thing?”
They watched them film the next scene, and Watson was impressed by their performances. It was a simple scene, but their acting just elevated it.
As they arrived in front of their dressing room doors, Holmes spotted Watson out of the corner of his eye and tried not to smirk. He then turned to Ms Adler, keeping hold of her hand and he gazed down at her lovingly. She smiled up at Holmes wickedly.
“Glad to hear it.” Stamford patted him on the shoulder. “Because we have a production meeting this afternoon. I’ll have a car ready to take you to your hotel to change. I’m going to introduce you to the crew and they’re going to groom you to audition for Morgan. Remember you need to charm them, they’re going to be the support to your success, which means the success of this movie.”
Speedboat POV: As they pull up, Amy is the first to see Sherlock and John making out in the cabin. She gasps, both hands covering her mouth. Jake looks at her then at where she’s looking.
Holmes pushed down his urge to kiss Watson, instead wrapping his arms around him and holding him as tightly as he could manage.
John searched over his stunned expression, his own slowly contorting with confusion. “What?” he asked, tilting his head.
“Come on,” John goaded, and, begrudgingly, Sherlock turned his head, squinting out over his shoulder. John was beaming down at him, holding out a plate he could not yet see the contents of, but his stomach lurched anyway.
Sherlock snorted, turning away toward the kitchen before sharing an amused glance with Lestrade out of the corner of his eye, and the exchange hit John like a wrecking ball to the stomach, reminding him just how thick the battle lines had been drawn, and how firmly Sherlock was on the other side.
This chapter is a monster, but I hope you don't mind. School starts on Monday, so expect the next update late next week or next weekend.
, but it sort of almost did a few times, and-and then…then his teammates started in on him, saying all the usual sorts of things because he hung out with a ‘faerie’.” He curled his fingers around the word, his tone stiffening with a bitterness the years had not entirely wiped away. “And he- Well,” he muttered, shrugging a shoulder, “the only time I ever saw him after that was when he was shoving me into lockers.”
!?” he sputtered, nose wrinkling in disgust as John shrugged. “How can you- You can’t possibly- I would
happened with Mary,” he said, looking steadily at the brunette who wouldn’t look at him. “Nothing. I didn’t even know I was supposed to be dating her, remember?” He smiled, trying to coax Sherlock into reciprocating, but the man would not be moved. “Sherlock,” John implored, but he was abruptly cut off.
Sherlock blinked blearily, trying to make sense of the flurry of movement in front of him, and then he was falling, his father shoved away to leave him sliding down the wall.
in their interactions, some underlying tension John knew would have to be addressed, and the dreaded ‘Define the Relationship’ conversation felt like it was around every corner, waiting to pounce every time Sherlock’s name popped up on his mobile screen.
Roll call complete, John wandered back over, rubbing his hands together in front of him. “We can get on now. The driver’s gonna load up the bags.”
Sherlock swallowed, glancing down at the table as he plotted his words. “I didn’t know immediately,” he said, and Irene turned the corners of her eyes to him. “About the fire.”
John held his gaze, blue eyes shifting between grey ones, and Sherlock’s inside squirmed with nerves under the skeptical scrutiny. “Did you take anything?” he asked finally, his fingers twitching against the tile.
“John asked if we could come out a bit early and help him with”—the sharp clear of John’s throat sliced the air—“er...prep. Ball prep,” Sean blustered, John shaking his head while Émile snorted.
, or to my email address (prettysherlocksoldier@gmail.com). I will post the list of prompts and links on Tumblr, and the actual fics will be posted here, so you can keep an eye on either of those places.
“Hey, Mike?” John asked as they walked toward the door. “You don’t have English literature right now, do you?”
“What!?” John spat right back, and they were frozen there for a moment, staring at one another in an offended tableau before laughter broke the scene.
see you again,” he paused, trying to force the threat of his words through his eyes, “I will kill you. Without hesitation, without mercy, and without leaving anything large enough to identify your corpse, is that understood?”
“No,” Sherlock chuckled, but John only continued frowning thoughtfully, though a corner of his mouth did twitch.
It was nearly ten in the morning, and Sherlock perched on the edge of his desk, his palms pressed together beneath his chin as he watched John sleeping.
John groaned, theatrically crumpling forward to bang his forehead on the table beside his coffee. “Why couldn’t you have been romantic
“Holy shit,” he deadpanned, smile rapidly growing to a delirious grin, and then he burst into laughter, clutching his arms around his sides as he wobbled to the side.
“Have you not been paying attention?” Sherlock replied, his voice drifting away as he moved further into the building, the beam of his light reflecting off the cinderblock walls of a narrow corridor. “We’re solving a murder.”
Sherlock blinked, a knot of nausea tightening thick and fast in his stomach, and he nodded when the sergeant lifted his face, not wanting to hear it any more than Lestrade wanted to say it.
John lifted his head, letting his fingers slide from his nose. Had it really only been three days? Not even, considering it was Tuesday morning and he had moved in Sunday afternoon. It felt like so much longer than that, but, then again, they had crammed a lot of…well, everything into yesterday. In a strange way, it was comforting to have someone already know everything about you; you got to skip that awkward, small talk phase. Of course, he still knew next-to-nothing about Sherlock, but he suspected that would be the case for a long time.
John blinked at the top of his bowed head. “Do you stalk all your clients or should I feel particularly honored?”
The boy was sitting on the floor, leaning against one of the tables against the right wall, his legs drawn up in front of him and tethered by his hands around his ankles. He looked the opposite direction when John entered, but did not move away as John sank down cross-legged in front of him.
“Sherlock?” he whispered, blinking into the dark of the room. “Sherlock?” he asked again, slipping his phone from his pocket, the light guiding him as he closed the door behind him. The faint blue glow landed on Sherlock’s bed, illuminating the lump within, and John trailed the light up the duvet to the mop of dark curls sprawled over the pillow. He smiled absentmindedly, watching Sherlock’s side rising and falling with his breathing as he backed silently out of the room, closing the door behind him.
John dithered another moment, his hands stalling on the back of the chair, and then pulled it out and sat in one sudden sweep, as if afraid the furniture might bolt if he didn’t take it by surprise. Or maybe it was Sherlock he was afraid might bolt, as he was now watching him warily out of the tops of his eyes, stretching his fork out to the plate of waffles with almost painful hesitation, like Sherlock could, at any moment, lash out at the encroachment.
It was about an hour before midnight, and thus the fireworks display, and Sherlock returned from putting on pajamas and storing his shirt and trousers for tomorrow in the walk-in closet—something John had been adamant someone named Harry Potter would have cried at the sight of—to find the blond had also changed—now wearing grey track pants and a dull red hoodie that seemed to be from his previous school’s rugby team. He was lying across the bed on his stomach, facing the direction Sherlock would have to return, and his feet were drawn up behind him, threadbare socks bobbing as he bent and stretched his legs.
He stopped by his elderly couple again, noticing that the woman had returned, and received rave reviews for the meals, promising he would compliment the chef as he headed back to the kitchen, flicking one last glance over his shoulder.
“Er, yes,” Greg muttered, rocking his heels back into the carpet as he cleared his throat, “you see, I was under the impression that the queen would be informing the prince of your arrival before you…arrived.” He rolled a hand at Sherlock to indicate the obviousness of that sailed ship. “But, it would seem I was…misinformed.”
John had swallowed, guilt or vomit—not that it couldn’t be both—rising bitterly up his throat. ‘He always did that,’ he’d muttered, attempting to dismiss it with a shrug. ‘Says he can work stuff out better when he pretends he’s bouncing it off me.’
John whined, flipping onto his back to stare up at the ceiling once again while Mike chuckled. “This is all your fault, you know,” he muttered while he replied.
“I think it’s Italian,” Sherlock remarked, but John only snorted, and Sherlock chuckled as he obeyed, slotting into the offered spot. His legs were longer that John’s, but, as he moved to be level with John’s shoulders, their feet brushed where they both bent them up, socks tangling together until they were swinging mostly in tandem.
“Nonsense,” Sherlock huffed, opting for domineering rather than encouraging, which would probably have given Lestrade a coronary. “You’ll watch from the observation room with me. I may need a second opinion.”
“Exactly!” Sherlock exclaimed sitting up and throwing his hands toward John, who simply shook his head, a begrudging smile tugging at his lips as Sherlock continued to laugh.
“It’s nothing,” he assured, fingers fishing toward the back, “I just-” He faded away, arm retracting to reveal a glinting black pistol.
His fingers still shook, but less so, his breathing evening out as he lifted the mobile to his ear, stepping across the room to close the blinds as it rung.
The crisp fell to the table, cracking as it bounced on the metal surface, and sent greasy shards shooting out like shrapnel.
“Shh!” Sherlock hissed, interrupting John’s protest, but John’s indignant retort was cut short by a voice behind him.
He sighed, lifting his hands from his sides and grinding his palms into his eyes. He was lucky John hadn’t moved out, really, considering how awful he’d been. He hadn’t truly wanted him to, but he certainly hadn’t let any of that show, and he supposed he was grateful John was staying, even if it
,” he added pointedly, withdrawing his hand with a tremble of what Sherlock would dearly love to believe was reluctance. “But you really should be washing it. And pick the rest of those pieces out.”
Sherlock smiled, eyes flicking up to John from the corners, and then nodded, turning away to head for the door.
John smiled with his usual fondness in the face of Sherlock’s oddities, but it caused an unprecedented twist in Sherlock’s stomach this time. “Yeah, I do,” John said, shuffling into his seat, and Sherlock flopped down next to him.
John rolled his eyes, but did quicken his pace, feet moving as fast as he dared on the slick slush as they tore toward the waiting cab.
Sherlock held the cigarette tight between his fingers, hoping to stave off most of the shaking, but he could see Irene watching him out of the corner of his eye, and kept his face determinedly downturned as he breathed slowly in and out at the concrete he couldn’t bring into focus.
I thought I would introduce him to some of my less royal pastimes. And you useless lot,” he added to a chorus of cheers, Émile clutching his chest in mock sentimentality. “Get you out of the pub between now and Christmas.”
“Not yet,” he replied, pulling his mobile out again to be sure. “Should be soon, though. The movie was, what, two hours?”
“What?” Sherlock questioned, confusion sparking through the shame in his eyes, but John wasn’t in the mood to be the one answering questions, and rolled his eyes, moving to turn around again.
,” he drawled, lip curling over his teeth. “Like me, it seems. I’m Sebastian Wilkes. I was Sherlock’s roommate for a while last year,” he said, and John hated himself for betraying his surprise, but it was obvious he had as Sebastian’s grin grew. “Oh, he didn’t say? I suppose it’s not quite polite, though, is it? Talking about the old with the new.” Sebastian continuing grinning, but there was no humor in his eyes, and John was torn between pounding his head into the wall or staying polite for the sake of information, because surely Sebastian couldn’t mean…
“Jesus!” John exclaimed, jumping several inches in the air as Sherlock seemed to shout himself awake, bolting up from where he had been laying as if it hadn’t been even remotely compromising.
Sherlock groaned against John’s mouth, haphazardly trying to keep up with John’s tongue and keep his mind from fracturing as he felt his way down John’s chest, finding the waistband on his jeans and tugging with a whine of suggestion.
“He just gave me a ride,” he murmured, his whole body hot with shame as he felt John’s eyes on the side of his face.
As slow as he could manage, he kissed a trail down Sherlock’s chest, pausing at each of his nipples to drop a sharp flick of his tongue, and Sherlock moaned, just like he always did, hips lifting up to brush his firm cock against John’s torso. “Shhh,” John chided, moving a hand to Sherlock’s hipbone to hold him down. “Not so fast,” he whispered against Sherlock’s ribs, chuckling when the man gave a sharp tug on his hair in retaliation, and then pulled out of range of Sherlock’s grip, moving his mouth to the inside of the man’s left thigh.
. He wasn’t one to covet, leaving other people to their lives as he preferred them to leave him to his, and there was never anything he had truly wanted that hadn’t been provided for him, his family fairly wealthy and he not exactly having frivolous tastes. Well, except perhaps in suits, but what was the point in having one if you weren’t going to get it custom? No, jealousy’s sharp sting and bitter bile had been entirely unknown to him up until he’d met John Watson, and now… Now it was keeping him up at night, a constant chopping in his stomach like waves upon a wooden hull, beating away at him in ever-present threat of capsize.
“Just try to relax,” the EMT interjected, draping the blanket around John’s back, and John stared down at the orange fabric, gaping with incredulity. “Now, let me see that shoulder.”
Molly blinked at him, lips popping apart, and even Mary looked startled, head snapping up as her blush abruptly faded.
“No one,” Mycroft replied, shaking his head. “Just myself, John”—he waved a hand back at the blond still pressed against the wall behind him, but Sherlock didn’t allow his eyes to follow the gesture—“and a few of my people who had to bring the decoy body from the morgue. And Anthea, of course,” he added with a tip of his head.
“Yeah,” the girl responded tartly, folding her arms, “it was. Until Irene showed up dressed like the world’s sluttiest elf.”
“No,” he chuckled, shaking his head, “just keep going. I know where we are now.” He had never lost track of it, of course, just lost interest, and, though Molly must have known that, she only smiled and nodded, bowing her head back to the paperback in her hands as she began to read her lines.
“Naturally,” he murmured, and Sherlock laughed, heart swelling in his chest as John beamed. The blond then leaned back, hesitating a moment before swinging his legs off the bench and standing. “Well,” he muttered, shoulders lifting as he slipped his hands into the pockets of his jacket, “I should get to class.”
“Sherlock,” John answered in a rush of air. “I’m sorry, I-I know it’s late.” He paused, and then sighed heavily down the line, Sherlock remaining motionless as he listened, feeling Mycroft’s eyes burning into the side of his head. “Will left,” John continued coldly. “He’d been stealing from Mum. No idea how long, but I caught him taking money out of her purse, told him I’d tell the police if he didn’t stop. He ran off after that, threw some clothes in a bag and left. Took the money, of course.”
Heads turn as Sherlock walked by, possibly because they were the only ones who weren’t wearing a tuxedo or because of his natural grace and beauty judging by the looks directed his way as he pushed through the crowded club.
John and Rosa are still keeping a lookout, but they are talking animatedly (well, I say animatedly, but it’s pretty much the same as earlier except they’re actually talking and looking at each other now).
Sherlock leaned back in his chair, one arm across his chest as a finger lay on his chin. “Well, I haven’t really thought about it.”
John’s smile was wonderfully dangerous as he leaned in to whisper. “But I spent all this time thinking about how to make this good for you.”
Watson scoffed. “It’s a musical, it’s not meant to be realistic. It’s not like people actually use a song and dance routine to declare their love in real life.”
“It’s been almost 6 weeks without a word from Mycroft, why won’t he tell us anything?” The soldier insisted, his impatience growing steadily as the weeks went by. The cases were enough to keep him occupied in the beginning, but the longer the wait, the heavier Manning weighed on his conscience.
“Whatever you do, do not touch it with your bare hands.” Sherlock handed him a pair of gloves. “If it grabs on, it will not let go.”
It was worse than John thought. “You know what, never mind. We’re here now, may as well get on with it.”
John wanted to burst out laughing. Surprising even himself, he nodded slowly, pursing his lips as he hummed a neutral approval.
“Apparently,” the woman continued, accompanied by the sound of footsteps, not heels, coming closer, “you’ve been looking for me.”
Watson had always had a great respect for actors. Repeating the same line again and again while maintaining the energy and making it seem fresh every time, was a difficult task in itself. But for some actors, being asked to stay silent and convey emotion was like getting a death sentence.
He had no idea from what century the decor was, but judging by the hard wooden walls, plush carpeting and moldings on the ceiling, this place was posh.
“How did you know the fog would be our way home?” Sherlock wasn’t even trying to hide his suspicion.
Jake, Amy, Boyle, and Lestrade are all lined up along the edge of the barge as Rosa and Holt ride in on the speedboat.
Ms Adler chuckled. “Break a leg, Mr Holmes.” and slipped her hand around Morgan’s arm. “After you, Morgan.”
“Watson insists on being modest, but I assure you he directed everyone with respect and was able to listen to ideas and use what served the story best.” Ms Adler cut in.
“I’m happy to announce that John Watson, our scriptwriter, will be directing the remainder of the movie.” Stamford turned to Watson and signalled him to take a step forward.
“You let Rebecca walk out of here so she lets Lily go, or you both die.” Bishop threatened, clearly at the end of his rope.
Ms Adler turned to Morgan with her hands on her hips, clearly used to dealing with him in this state. “What is it, darling?”
, as well as its history, but keep in mind I modified some facts for story-sake. Mainly that it is a nightclub, not a restaurant.
Her hair fell around her face and fanned softly against her bare shoulders and back. The bright red strands crisscrossed against the faded tan of her skin made her seem younger, playful even, despite her current scowl. It was an intriguing contrast that was very John Watson-ish, even though it was far from her usual conservative look.
I’m Detective Inspector Lestrade from Scotland Yard. That is Sherlock Holmes and Doctor John Watson. We’re here to investigate--
“A simple clock. Look. Let’s just go back and I’ll show you.” John said as he tugged at the man they were holding to get them moving again.
John knew he wasn’t going to change his mind, now that he thought about it; it was surprising he hadn’t already turned and left already. “Fine. I’ll stay until closing time.” John offered reluctantly.
Pinned against the wall, Sherlock knees the shooter in the stomach. With a painful grunt, the shooter releases his hold and moves away. They look at each other as they catch their breath. They both look towards the gun on the floor, at each other, then both dive for it. The shooter is closest, so he reaches the gun first.
John forced her eyes open and scanned the room. It took a few seconds before she spotted Molly. Their eyes met, and it felt like the sexual tension in the room grew exponentially. Just their eyes meeting heightened the arousal.
Sherlock didn’t want to tell John about his overdoses. He didn’t want to see the disappointment in his eyes. John hummed as he put aside the soiled cloth. Thankfully he didn’t insist. Sherlock watched his nimble fingers prepare the local anaesthetic as the lamp warmed his wet skin.
“Morgan’s public humiliation told us more about their hierarchy. This confirms my theory that Ms Alder was part of the plan as help, valuable help, and by humiliating her, Morgan lost her loyalty.”
After a quick look around, the clerk placed the book on the counter, turned it around to face John, grabbed the money and left as quickly as he could.
Holmes’s low voice almost made Watson jump, caught having personal thoughts and worried Holmes had somehow heard them. He was surprised to be included in Holmes’s search of the infirmary. It was quite a change from Holmes’s initial dismissal.
“Where are they going?” Watson asked as they turned right rather than left, towards the rehearsal studio.
“Has she bought something from an art gallery recently?” Sherlock asked, turning a bit emotional. The man furrowed his brows as he answered.
“I’m sorry, I’m sorry dear, It’s just- Oh dear, getting gooed, that woman and that artifact in the same day, he must, he must be absolutely
As the second truck went through Holmes’s same methodical process, Watson checked on the building and was obligated to intervene during the counting process.
“Yes, there is, or we wouldn’t be here.” John riposted without waiting for his partner to catch up. “You said it yourself, there is no way it moved here on its own at the exact moment we started a trace. It was told to do so. Maybe you can do it from a computer but you just need to be next to it. Send a stronger signal.” They slowed as they approached the booth, standing out of the way of the alley circulation but close enough for John to try spotting it.
Stamford turned to Watson then, whose postured now looked ready to fight, which piqued Holmes curiosity.
John started by cleaning the blood on Sherlock’s face and neck. The touch was so gentle that, even with his headache, Sherlock could feel himself relaxing.
Watson laughed and moved onto the third stitch, making quick work of it. He cleaned, and secured his work, leaned back and slipped off his gloves. Watson looked at Holmes; judging by his frown he was probably in more pain than he was letting on.
“Will you shut up?! I’m working on it!” John screamed towards the speaker, his voice sounding odd against the low beat.
Morgan shook it briefly and took a step back. “Well, Ms Hawkins wasn’t exaggerating, you are quite the looker.” Morgan started walking around Holmes, looking him up and down.
“I told you, you’ve got it down, we should move on to the first meeting so it’s ready for this afternoon.”
Watson looked over his shoulder. “Are you worried I won’t let you go to the infirmary if you’ve taken something?”
“Your definition of friendly diverges greatly from the masses.” He retorted, his words filled with hatred.
All of a sudden, the alarm and blinking lights stopped, restoring the Warehouse to its standard halogen lights, except for the purple rain surrounding ground zero.
The large room was still dark except for the corridor light leaking in through the door, and the two red lights over the emergency exits at both ends of the studio.
“Because you insisted that we start with dance rehearsal, I’m going to assume you understand that dancing is the most important part of the performance,” Wiggins monologued as he paced along the mirrored wall of the rehearsal studio. “Dance lets you emote, communicate emotion in a way words can only scratch the surface.”
“Morning,” Holmes mumbled and made his way to the window to stare outside. “But it most certainly is not a good one.”
Watson felt grateful to help with the case, but even more for the chance to experience it through Holmes’s eyes. He was seeing Hollywood through a new lens and was excited to see where it would lead them.
Sherlock didn’t need to look at John to know he was smiling at his choice of words. He could hear it in his voice.
Holmes’s mouth was on Watson’s nipple as soon as it was available, licking and biting it gently. Watson cursed and cupped the back of his head with one hand while the other caressed and scratched the long span of Holmes’s back. It felt so good Watson almost forgot about the hand sliding down his pants to grab hold of his cock.
“It’s deplorable how the case turned out so disappointing. In my experience, serial killers are usually much cleverer. I once worked on a bombing case which took six days to find his bunker. Of course, it was rigged. Almost lost an arm.”
About thirty minutes later, when Holmes finished reading the last page, he tilted his head to the side and tapped the script with his index finger absentmindedly. “I’ve never seen war movies, only real footage.”
The Fic Writers’ Retreat in Barrie, Ontario, Canada. Thank you to the (now closed) Kempenfelt Convention Center for letting us use their wedding dance floor setup to film (free of charge! Thank God there was a wedding the next day). And to the wonderful @hubblegleeflower for organising the retreat and letting this crazy idea happen.
“Sherlock, you know as well as I do that in the Warehouse, as unlikely as it seems, we never rule anything out.” There was the patient older brother tone again.
Watson chuckled. “We went to med school together. He dropped out when he inherited the production studio.”
“Hm.” Sherlock hid his surprise at seeing the artifact he was holding when they got sucked into the manuscript and handed the picture to John. “He was hired to find the artifact in this picture for your boss and you kept an eye on him in case he tried to run away with it, which he did, and now you can’t find him and can’t go to your boss empty handed. Still not interested.”
“No, no, I get it, you’re right,” Moriarty replied, almost apologetic. “It’s not my style. But little Ms Rosie here just loooves killing people.”
The sight of John wavering as their eyes locked sent a wave of pleasure through Sherlock, tempting him to focus on his partner instead of the case. But this was Rebecca Carson’s second murder and even if she was fictional, she needed to be stopped. It was fascinating in a sense, how he struggled with his own body to turn away from John. The jog up the stairs helped him regain some composure, his mind back on the case as he walked to the car.
Molly grabbed her bag, trying not to look guilty about buying something she seemed genuinely happy to own, and they headed towards the exit.
John’s arms tightened around Sherlock as he nuzzled and tongued the crook of his neck. It made shivers run up and down Sherlock’s back. He squirmed and moaned until John bit down.
“Barely a few minutes with her and he was infatuated,” Stamford explained. “She dragged him around like a puppy. He would have licked her shoes if she asked.”
“Apparently since we’ve just ended a war, the public doesn’t want to see a movie that reminds them of it.”
Bishop nodded. “Something happened. To her.” He shook his head. “It happened so fast.” He continued with emotion. “One day she was sick, and then she was gone. I threw myself into a new novel, wrote a few chapters, and then, well the story was wrong. My wife was all I could think about. I'd sit in front of my typewriter and close my eyes, and I'd imagine this world.” He lifted his head and looked around with a smile that didn’t reach his eyes. “Then one day I woke up and I was here.”
“I’m sorry for not telling you sooner, but it was to prevent any interference with the investigation,” Stamford explained.
This particular artifact had been owned by WWII veteran, John Giltoy. He had been part of The Battle of Bataan that had lasted three months. It was the largest surrender in American and Filipino History. The 90,000 prisoners of war captured by the Japanese were forced marched over a hundred kilometers from Mariveles, on the southern end of Bataan Peninsula, to Camp O’Donnell. Starved, mistreated, often kicked or beaten on their way, those who fell were bayoneted, decreasing their numbers by thousands during the journey. During the march, Giltoy's friend, Roy Schrop, became deathly ill and their captors wanted to leave him for dead. With only 30 kilometers to go, Giltoy helped his friend walk, repeating "You can do this" over and over again, until his wish came true.
Sherlock pulled out a business card, white with his name printed in black capital letters in the centre. It had his number and address handwritten on the back.
Holmes appeared in the doorway, and Watson’s fingers forgot how to work. He had been so concerned with Holmes’s reaction to the song that suddenly being alone with him felt terrifying, even though there was nowhere else in the world he’d rather be.
Sherlock slowly became conscious he was clutching John’s back, hard enough to leave a mark. He released him, slowly regaining feeling in his arms and legs, but kept his arms wrapped around him loosely. He wished he had seen John come, but he knew he’d have other chances.
Watson could just picture it. “Oh no.” He started laughing, picturing the commotion it must have caused on set.
“Evening, gentlemen,” Lestrade told Stamford and Watson as he stepped in and frowned. “Holmes isn’t here?”
Lestrade cut Holmes off with a loud cough. Holmes turned to see both Lestrade and Stamford staring at him angrily.
“See, I’m doing you a favor.” John could hear the smile in his partner’s voice and it made his blood pump.
“John shut up.” Stamford sighed. “I don’t care if he’s a bloke, I haven’t seen you this happy in years.”
John didn’t hear him. “It’s too lonely here.” He whispered to himself, half surprised, half concerned. He remembered reading that the artifact had mainly been sighted in public places, but nothing in there explained why.
“John. You go mad when you’re at home. We’ve been on the phone for more than 15 seconds and I haven’t heard you complain about being suspended, or curse the living hell out of our superiors,” The man at the other end of the line hesitated before continuing. “and you aren’t hung-over. So. What’s her name?” John closed his eyes, cursing his brain for suggesting to answer
John continued his way down, adding his hands into the mix. He caressed Sherlock’s stomach and hips until he finally wrapped a hand around his achingly hard cock.
“Well,” Stamford started uncertainly. “They, they start over there, and then…” Stamford looked from Lestrade to Watson with a blank look.
The reporters bustled to life when the door opened, and Lestrade ushered the small group to the table and microphones. Stamford sat first, Morgan second, then Holmes and Ms Adler. They strategically put Ms Adler last, knowing the cameras would start flashing as soon as she stepped out, thus blinding everyone. It also meant no one noticed Ms Hooper rounding up the group and closing the door before leaning against it to watch.
“I sleep odd hours. Sometimes I don’t speak for days. And I like to play violin when I think.” John’s head spun around.
He took the coffee mug and hunched over it, staring into the dark liquid, letting the steam fog up his sunglasses. “It is morning, but I’m still unsure if it is a good one,” And took a sip.
After Holmes’s rescue, what had been left of the night was spent at the Police Precinct. They were now in Chief Jones’s office, which felt cramped with so many people in it. Jones was sitting behind his desk, with Lestrade, Stamford, Watson and Holmes sitting in front of him. Officer Rogers, Lestrade’s contact, was leaning against a filing cabinet behind Jones.
Murray looked at the clock then and smiled. He reached out his hand to Small who reluctantly handed him money.
The string shattered instantaneously, making John take a few steps back. With a loud creak, the gears broke the remaining pieces and started turning again. The central tube sprang to life, emitting large bubbles, reminding John of a lava lamp.
“Sly bugger.” John cursed under his breath, but turned and started walking away from the booth. “I’ll try again in 5 minutes or so.” He said when they had turned the corner of the alleyway and stopped.
Their booth was in a well-placed spot, with Lestrade a few tables over to keep an eye on them. The booth was close to the dance floor but far enough away to survey the room, which Ms Adler started doing as soon as the waiter left with their orders.
“Just do it.” John demanded. Sherlock kept his eyes on John as he opened the bag and held it out. Sherlock nodded to John, who nodded back and dropped it into the bag. They both looked away as the flashing electric blue light sparked.
“Well you did bring back milk.” Sherlock grinned making John chuckle. Clearing his throat, John was about to reply when the computer pinged loudly. Sherlock stood from his chair and walked rapidly towards the computer, John not far behind him.
.” The entire mood of the scene shifted. The following lines, along with the way their bodies danced around one another, now made perfect sense.
But wasn’t this supposed to be the base of a highly secret government branch? Why did it look like the basement of a hoarder? Walking carefully into the... office, he went towards the desk, curious to inspect the odd-looking devices hooked up to the computer. Well, a computer with 6 screens. That’s when he noticed the windows behind the screens, all lined with wooden blinds.
There was something about Holmes’s delivery that emphasized how the word was inadequate to describe his sentiment, but also told Watson how much the song had meant to him.
The next time John and Sherlock came by the lab, nothing happened per se, but Sherlock kept… staring.
John tapped the line. “Operator? Say miss, what’s your name? Doris, what a beautiful name. I’m certain you have a lovely face to match that sultry voice. A red head, I love red heads. No, what do they say?” A flirty chuckle came out of John, earning him an elbow in the ribs.
Holt and Rosa are walking along the boardwalk with a Pier 12 employee. The barge is in the distance, slowly making its way onto the river.
“You’re just good as new?” John considered Sherlock’s health more important than trying to hide his sixth sense. “What do these things do anyway?” John held up the tags in his hand.
“And a good thing I was, or you would have definitely ended up in the hospital. But I’m not always going to be there.”
It was close to John’s natural colour, but it would lack the nuances. Sherlock estimated how long it will take to grow back and pouted. The prospect of losing such an interesting aspect of John’s physique was unfortunate, but it did offer ideal conditions to measure her hair’s growth rate.
This has been a crazy ride, and I can't thank you all enough for reading and commenting along the way at every new chapter. How many times I went back to read through them to motivate myself to keep going.
John let his head hang, a bit discouraged, but a smile was tugging at his lips. He couldn’t blame Sherlock, seeing what he had said about the man in his many interrogations. But if he had come to him, John probably would have said yes. Well, after a lot of explanations. And proof. But one thing was certain. Once he would have stepped foot in the Warehouse, John would have said yes and ended up exactly where he was now.
He opened the door for John, who gave him a surprised look, given what he had just heard in the car, which Sherlock ignored, trying to act as if it were completely normal for him to do so. They walked into a small shop, filled with electronic devises, odd pieces of furniture, even a wall covered with guitars. A little section in the back seemed to be for smaller objects. Sherlock moved directly towards it, leaving John alone in the front section. He kept an eye on the man behind the counter, nodding his head to him as he looked around. He was expecting everything to be crap covered in dust, but this stuff was actually nice, and well kept. An old clock caught John’s attention. It was a small box made out of dark brown polished wood with marble detailing around the edges. A clock ticked on the front, with a painted face. He picked it up to look at the clock face more closely. It looked like a painting of the moon smiling.
John looked to the side, licked his lips. His point was that as insane as his life was at the moment, as crazy as this man made him on a day to day basis, he knew he couldn’t turn his back on life as a warehouse agent anymore. And as much as he hated to admit it, the main reason was standing right in front of him.
“He asked to have Watson fired, which I told him was out of the question,” Stamford said more for Watson’s benefit than Holmes’s.
Ms Adler looked around them subtly and leaned closer to Holmes. “Calm down. Almost everyone here is on coke or painkillers.”
The director was sunk in his chair, arms crossed, staring at the ceiling. Holmes turned to Ms Adler, confused. She kept her eyes on Morgan, but shook her head subtly. She seemed calm, but Holmes could see how tense she really was.
John was heavy against Molly, but Molly didn’t dare move her, willing their bubble of lust to last as long as possible. Her eyes met Sherlock’s and she bit her lip when she noticed the wetness across Sherlock’s full lips, how it shimmered on her chin and down her long pale neck. Felt her breath catch as Sherlock’s tongue slipped out to taste, then sucked in her lower lip and hummed.
Sherlock lifted his chin and sniffed loudly. “I didn’t catch it, or we wouldn’t be here.” His tone was dripping with resentment.
“Will you two stop speaking as if I wasn’t here? And I do not work here, I haven’t agreed to anything.” As much as he felt something he couldn’t describe about this place, he wasn’t about to get into this blindly, especially with these two.
Lifting the plank to chin height, John aimed it at the silly string and blew. A puff of cold air raised from the end of the plank, growing steadily and freezing anything in its path, specifically the silly string, turning from bright pink to a pale shade of blue that shimmered in the lights.
They clinked their glasses and as their eyes met, Sherlock was pleased to see whatever they had shared in Stamford’s office that morning was still there. A part of him wanted to kiss John right away but Sherlock knew he wouldn’t be able to stop. And the dinner ritual was important to John. He didn’t want to risk ruining things so quickly.
The finger inside her wasn’t moving, and the mouth on her breast was licking slowly and languorously. It felt like a lot, but it wasn’t too much.
The punk runs into the parking lot, looking over his shoulder. Jake comes in a few seconds later, running full speed, and tackles the teenage punk.
Just like any other day filming, Wilder was the first one in, unlocking the studio, switching on the power for the day. Even though this morning was rehearsal and they weren’t filming, Wilder liked to look at the scene through the camera lens, his way of preparing for filming.
Even with his earpiece, Captain John Watson could barely hear Talley, their commanding officer, over the roar of the plane engine. As soon as they were done going over the Intel for the infiltration mission, the special ops team would parachute out of the plane 20 miles away from the research facility. Once they hid their parachutes, they would take a truck that would be waiting for them to drive to the cliff overlooking the target area, approximately 2 miles south-east. From there, Talley would monitor them from the van, the rest would continue on foot to the south east corner of the building.
It was squeezed between the feet of a life size sculpture of Elvis and a gray tool box in the far corner. He rolled his eyes. This GPS definitely liked to play games. It had chosen the only spot where it could blend in properly. It’s gray 90s plastic bulky shape stood out from all of the 50’s memorabilia once you noticed it. Smiling, John turned back towards Sherlock.
Why are they at the Waterfront Museum? This is the worst place to visit in Brooklyn. The subway doesn’t even make it here.
“Sounds like a good Warehouse agent candidate.” John commented and was surprised by his partner’s protests.
The sound of the towboat motor changes, making both Sherlock and John jolt as the boat starts moving.
“I appreciate the invitation.” Watson still looked worried. “But I’ll be a bit useless in a foot chase.”
“That depends on the play list. If you’re listening to everything he’s composed, you have over a day.” Sherlock’s voice echoed against the metal walls.
“Oh thank you, thank you so much.” She said as she stood, her hands worrying her clutch as she walked towards them. “What would I ever do without you?”
Sherlock had woken up with his head on John’s lap. The agent had shown the most curious look on his face, as if he had been surprised that John had taken care of him even though he had acted like a prat all day.
Congrats on that lead. Sergeant pulled up Turner’s file. He has two priors, one for car theft and one for boat theft. He sent out Boyle and Lestrade to bring him in for questioning.
He fought the temptation to look back, because he knew John was there. He could feel his eyes, watching, just like the day before.
“That’s because there isn’t anything to understand!” Sherlock spat, spinning in his chair and standing up suddenly. It made the chair fall to the side, the back hitting the side of the desk, making a loud crashing noise. John was taken aback by his partner’s sudden outburst, staring at him as they listened to the soft spinning of the chair’s wheels in the silent room. Mycroft had a look on his face that was probably the same one he had used when they were kids and Sherlock was having a fit. “It is the most annoying artifact because it is completely useless. It isn’t harmful, it isn’t helpful either. It’s just a hyper aware electronic device that likes being chased.” John watched his angry partner and fought the smile that wanted to spread across his face, pleased to see him out of his wit in front of what he thought was a rather amusing artifact.
“Yeah?!” He screamed from the other side of the room. Watson felt a rush of relief. He wanted to see if Rogers and Jones were ok, but he knew they still had a mission to do.
“Still waiting for that explanation.” Watson repeated to the office ceiling, wondering when his life became a sci-fi sitcom. Sherlock straightened and turned to speak directly to John, using what he considered to be a patient and pleasant tone.
Lestrade pursed his lips. “Knowing Holmes? Definitely not good.” He straightened and opened the door. “Ms Hooper, please call Holmes’s hotel and insist they go check his room and see if he’s there.”
“John, there isn’t much time.” Sherlock insisted, his hand dropping from the artifact as he swayed on his feet.
, every morning wasn’t really the best way to keep him cheery. “No appearing out of thin air this morning?” He asked over his shoulder as he filled the kettle.
, the opening song, Holmes’ head rose. He stared into Morgan’s eyes and, as if it were the most normal thing in the world, started singing.
“Shh.” Ms Hawkins cooed, catching Holmes as he started losing his balance and helped him lie down on the floor.
“Just hold it.” Sherlock ordered in a gruff before pushing it into John’s chest forcefully and walking back to the computer.
Sherlock sucked in a breath and shut her mouth, eyes wide. She was grateful John had said something before she did or she would already be up and leaving for Bart’s out of sheer humiliation. But she still couldn’t believe John had said yes. She watched her, searched her, deduced her, trying to understand how she could possibly be going along with all of this. That’s when Sherlock felt John’s knee nudging her. It was small, but it was still there. It didn’t provide much of an answer, but it was still John’s way of telling Sherlock it was okay.
“Morning.” John greeted. “Don’t mind me, you can keep playing if you want.” He added, not knowing if this was the usual morning routine. He just wanted coffee.
He managed to shake Molly off, after she insisted he come by the morgue the next day to collect a large bag of body parts as a thank you.
.” John’s tone was a clear warning. He knew the tall bastard had figured it out and was just making a scene of it. Well, he sort of deserved to enjoy it, even though he also kind of didn’t if you think about his behavior this past week.
“Try covering it with this.” Sherlock said as he started to take off his coat and unbutton his shirt.
Even though all he could see was Lestrade’s back, Sherlock could tell he was impressed by the way he straightened.
But his eyes… Watson couldn’t look away. There was this careless, almost naïve quality to them. It was fascinating when compared to his confident stare, like he could see through everyone.
Holmes eyes flickered to Watson before focusing on Stamford. “Tell me more about Anderson. If you had so many problems with him, why did you hire him?”
But that didn’t tarnish the wonderful joy of seeing them perform, the relief of having finally written the finale, the anticipation of Holmes coming over tonight.
Lestrade straightened his back and focused on Stamford. “Officially, the police are ruling his death an accident.”
With a resigned air, John watched the couple embrace each other, happy to finally have a chance to be together. He then took one last look at their surroundings, ending his trail on Sherlock, devastatingly handsome in black and white looking at the horizon.
“No! Nope.” John crouched down, grabbed her towel and quickly wrapped it around herself. “You stop talking right now. You will not say a single thing about-”
“You asked, deal with what you get.” John kept his gaze on the GPS but he could still picture his partner’s eye roll. “Um, basic button interface, display screen... So yeah, it can teleport. Either on its own, or when you touch it. Or if you try to push it off a shelf with a stick. Or a trap door-”
