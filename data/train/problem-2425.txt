Sherlock and John both moaned loudly at the sight of the clear liquid dripping down near John’s belly button, Sherlock slid a finger through it and held it up to John’s lips, he swallowed hard when the doctor locked half-lidded eyes on his and bent his head to draw the finger into his mouth, cheeks hollowing as he sucked up and down on the digit. Sherlock couldn’t look, he squeezed his eyes shut and dropped his head back but it didn’t help, it only made things worse, He could feel even more clearly the sensation of John’s hot wet mouth sliding and pulling on his pointer finger and hear the loud slurps the doctor made with each upward motion, it was torture and Sherlock loved it.
“Fine, but be quick about it.” Molly gave another one of her heavily animated nods just before the doors opened in the lift when they arrived at the maternity ward and then led Sherlock to the private rooms at the back of the ward, making sure to lead him around the main desk so as not to be seen. It wasn’t until they reached the door of the room with ‘
"Here’s my, er, cell number. If I could help, with Henry, give me a call." He smiled at Sherlock and handed him a card. Sherlock spent the next two minutes asking questions that Frankland just danced around, annoying Sherlock who just gave up and held up the card.
." Sherlock said viciously, sounding absolutely disgusted by the idea and that cut deeper than any other cruel act Sherlock had inflicted upon him that day. No matter if Sherlock didn’t want to share John’s heat and bond with him, no matter that Sherlock’s instincts ran hot and cold, leading John on and pushing him away again and no matter that it was Sherlock’s Alpha pride that had pushed the man to harm John physically,
“And you were doing so well there Mycroft, very well, where am I heading first?” Sherlock sighed leaning back and crossing his legs as the car started to move.
." Sherlock soothed and pulled John against him, running his hands up and down the smaller man’s back, John sighed and nuzzled Sherlock’s scarf.
"MOVE!" Sherlock snarled and John, whose face was a mask of concentration, pulled back and slammed forward; hard. Sherlock’s world jolted and and another animalistic moan dragged it’s way out of his body. This was how it continued for the next ten minutes, John pulling out slowly and then slamming back in with all the force he could muster, kisses and bites being exchanged as well as moans and pants of pure pleasure. Then Sherlock got impatient.
? A minute ago footprints were boring, now they're very promising?" Sherlock gave John
"If you move I’ll bloody kill you, Alpha or not." The threat made Sherlock snort, it wasn’t very scary when John was too busy snuffling against his neck and pouting.
be another Alpha for me; you’re the only Alpha I’ve ever wanted to belong to. I love you." John could hear the gulp Sherlock took to swallow the lump in his throat from the affectionate proclamation and leaned in to cover the small space between their lips to give Sherlock a sweet peck. Sherlock deepened the little kiss into something more substantial but kept up the slow affectionate aura of it and they sat there like that with John straddling Sherlock’s thighs in the front seat of a 4x4, under the cover of trees and darkness. Eventually, John pulled back with a wince as another bout of cramps, much more powerful than the last, hit him and Sherlock gently shifted John back over to the passenger’s seat.
"Absolutely no idea but-" Sherlock trailed off and his face contorted in confused anger when he caught sight of Lestrade, shuffling on his feet casually in the pub. Sherlock stomped off into the pub just as John had caught sight of the DI too, he made sure quickly follow in Sherlock to prevent the man from ruining his only other real friendship outside of John.
"I'm not sure, it should in theory prevent you from reacting further but since your body’s already been exposed to the scent, I don't know. I'm going upstairs to pack, I'll meet you outside, just leave your bag at the door and I'll grab it with my own on the way out." John said quickly and turned to go upstairs.
Sherlock frowned, that wasn’t right, his Omega should be leaning into him and bearing his neck in pleasure, not jumping away as if afraid of him. Sherlock tried again, this time nuzzling John’s neck and rubbing his shoulders but that was when he heard the jingle of keys falling on the ground. John had sneakily pulled the car keys from his pocket and dropped them. Sherlock’s grip slackened when he looked down to see what the noise was and John made use of the distraction by shoving the Alpha hard and jumping away, Sherlock snarled at the Omega’s disobedience, teeth bared and pupils blown wide and reading himself to pursue John again but stopped dead when John called his name.
"One; I don’t want to know how much and two; will you need any more baby things in the forcible?" John pouted at Sherlock and handed him back his card.
"I'll let you know next week’s lottery numbers." He said smugly and John chuckled at him, as if he would fall for that... again, Sherlock huffed at him, so much for that genius brains great idea.
, the... the
"You being funny now?" He teased and Sherlock decided to be honest.
"God bless, Henry Knight and his monster from hell." Sherlock heard and glanced up when John answered.
"Firstly it
"Know what?" Sherlock waited until Mycroft took another drink of tea before breaking the news.
that just happened?" John just looked at him.
"Nothing of importance?!
"Yes, yes, yes!" Sherlock called and started thrusting himself down John’s throat, John for his part just relaxed his throat and took it, focusing on breathing through his nose and swallowing every once and a while to make Sherlock groan. Saliva was dripping down John’s chin and soaking into his collar and tears were running down his face at the force with which Sherlock was shoving into his mouth but John loved it, he loved it because Sherlock was loving it, the Doctor could tell from the way Sherlock was growling, moaning, groaning and snarling John’s name over and over again. He could tell from the sweat that was covering Sherlock’s face and pooling at his collarbone and he could tell from the way Sherlock had sped up at the end before he shoved himself so deep that John never even got to taste his come before it was pumped down into his stomach in thick globs.
"Faster, John,
After getting cleaned up and wiping down his harpoon, Sherlock came striding back into the living room and started his pacing up and down routine again, a routine that had become a very common sight in the past weeks. John sighed and kept reading his paper, thinking that if he focused enough on the words in front of him then he might just manage to get through the impending tantrum.
." John stopped digging through his bag and turned to look towards Sherlock contemplatively.
"Sorry mate! Sooo... bonded to Sherlock, what’s that like then?" Greg teased, John smirked.
“She’s so tiny Sh’lok, so tiny.”
It didn’t take long for him to reach his destination, 8:03 minutes to be exact but it was long enough. He brought the car to a screeching halt a safe distance from the black ‘copter and was immediately greeted by a short, stout, Beta man who stood by the side of the vehicle.
"At night? You want me to go out there at night?" he asked robotically and Sherlock hummed in affirmation taking another sip of tea.
"Um yes... about the room-" John started but was interrupted by Gary raising his hand.
?!" John cried furious and Sherlock shushed him whilst looking around at the other people who had glanced over at John’s exclamation.
"Thank you, sir."
"Is that when you had the idea, after the TV show went out?" Lestrade asked, giving Gary a challenging glare so hard that poor Billy cracked under the weight of it.
Thank you for all your support and I’ll see you in the sequel:
he smelled, John chuckled.
"Sherlock what your smelling is the change in my scent now that yours is mixed with it, it’s a part of our bond." Sherlock rolled his eyes and slid down so he was face to face with John’s abdomen.
"Put down." Gary softened.
It was a very rare occurrence for there not to be any cases on these days at 221B thanks to the rising popularity of John’s blog, meaning that usually poor John didn’t get a lot of sleep or food in between the running around London chasing leads and criminals. However over the past few weeks there seemed to be a sudden drought of cases, almost as if the London criminal classes had decided to take a little holiday from being foiled by the dynamic duo of Dr. John Watson and Sherlock Holmes.
Sherlock had the feeling he was going to absolutely love being a father... after all with entertainment like this; it was hard to think otherwise.
was there light in the first place anyway? Sherlock was sure the curtains were firmly closed the other night when he had claimed John.
"Okay, fine. Just a quick one though." John sighed, Sherlock pulled back triumphantly and slid a hand beneath John’s jacket to reach the inside pocket, John raised an eyebrow when the detective pulled a mini bottle of lube out.
"I’m afraid we won’t have time for that. We’ll need the full tour right away. Carry on." John ordered and
"What’s the matter?" Sherlock asks, looking at John concerned.
"Mycroft’s name
"Listen, if there is a monster out there, John, there’s only one thing to do: Find out where it lives." The detective drawled and smiled at Henry. John gave a mirthless laugh and then winced when the force of it hurt his shoulders, Henry glanced at him concerned.
John suddenly needed the bathroom, and had to dive into the nearest one, coming out feeling very shaky.
“Uh…” Sherlock put his hands on John’s shoulders, and pushed him back, so he could no longer reach him. “Sorry, you…” He glanced down at the fake bump. “That should be illegal!”
“Nah, they have to stay with the girls. Unless they want putting back to normal,” the lad getting carried away gripped his cock through his trousers and there was more laughter.
“Incident?”
“John said he loves me,” Sherlock said, staring at the seat in front.
It really was romantic. Almost as if...
John thumped the table. “This is all bullshit! Why do omegas stop being fucking
Sherlock looked back at his case, and picked it up. “I’m going to put this upstairs. I don’t want anyone resting a drink on it,” he took a step backwards, and the offered cheek was part of a smiling face again.
Sherlock shoved himself hard between John’s legs, slotting their pelvises together. John let out a sound as the vampire’s hard cock made itself known, rutting over the inside of his thigh, his crotch, meeting his own cock as John groaned in need.
He nodded.
John wanted to look up. To move away, but he couldn’t. “Um…”
“But we –”
The scent was coming straight from the window – come and heat and virgin and omega and fertility and unclaimed and oh sweet jesus it was a call to anyone who might have a nose.
Sherlock sat up, eyes going wide.
“I know…” John shook his head. He swallowed and pulled back to look down at the youngster. “What happened, Sherlock? How did you get like this? Who brought you here? Was it… Victor?”
“No, no,” John felt heat suddenly rise into his face. “I’m, er… on some tablets. Not supposed to drink.”
“I forgot to say you’re my best friend, too,” Sherlock grinned.
James laughed with him. “Nah… gas canister in an abandoned building. Returning fire and the whole thing exploded. Lucky to get out of it at all, to be honest.” He folded his hands on the table-top. One of them was unharmed. “I heard you got shot.”
punishing himself.
‘Deep breath, John, that’s it, try to wake up for us.’
Sherlock met his eyes. “I’m not afraid,” he lied. “I want to know. How it goes. In hospital, and at home. How is it different?”
Sherlock didn’t answer. The truth was, no omega could say they were unhappy with their mate. Not publicly, anyway.
John shook his head, slightly. "No, I'm inviting you. The blood I borrowed should already be absorbed into my system. We ate tapas for lunch. Or, I did. You will do, by default."
There had been a court case, albeit a brief one. Eurus was found unable to stand trial. It was unsurprising – she hadn’t said a single word since shooting her father. She stared into the middle distance, her hands limp at the wrist as they dangled over the arms on the chair. Her pregnancy had been brought to an end shortly after her arrest. It was the only thing she would react to, when questioned. The only nod she would give. The only paper she would sign.
“John… I…” Sherlock huffed out a breath. “I’m seeing Victor. I have been for some time. I don’t know what to do, now. I… I thought we were over.”
When Sherlock had pictured John’s attacker, he had formed in his mind an image of a sort of darkness-enshrouded figure, a man with no real features or appearance other than seething evil, and fangs.
‘What?’ John looked over his shoulder.
“It’s nice to meet you, Sherlock,” John said, covering the embarrassment in the room. “Were you playing the violin, sir?”
“Night.”
“No, not for another seven weeks, maybe?”
The doctor laughed. “You got me. So, do you have any questions?”
John was relieved of his oxygen mask, and without it, quickly fell asleep again before he got to the lift.
“I believe… it leaves us at the beginning,” Sherlock said.
Sherlock leaned in again, just as John did the same, and their kiss met softly, chasing as they skated on the abandoned ice.
“Not officially,” John said.
Sherlock spoke softly. “John… it’s only been an hour.”
, John thought.
“I mean it,” John went on. “I love you so much, and you’re doing such a wonderful job with Pixie… I know this hasn’t been plain sailing, but…” he cupped Sherlock’s face, and pressed their foreheads together. “But, you are perfect. For me, and for her. And forever.”
So, the weird swimming fluttering thing was the baby moving.
John’s throat clenched, like a vice. ‘I know.’
“I didn’t know,” Sherlock pulled him into a close embrace. “But I’m so glad.”
The man smirked. “You don’t believe me.”
John reached cautiously, and put a hand in the place he had laid. He was quiet for a moment. “It’s cold,” he said.
He hadn’t taken a pregnancy test.
John stepped in between Sherlock’s legs, and hesitated. If he went closer, Sherlock would be able to scent along his throat.
“How does he… you know?”
“Yes…” Sherlock looked over the doctor’s face. “I keep thinking something will happen, and I won’t have to die. Something will… save me.”
“I think so,” John said. “It’s not going to be quick. But… yeah. She made me think of things, already.”
“Problem?” Mycroft noticed.
John wrote several messages, deleting them all before settling on the one he sent.
“She’s in the best place.”
“You don’t need to ask for that.”
Stop it.
“Either you tell it me now, or we do a DNA swab and I find it out anyway.”
“Except you’re enjoying the cuddle,” John’s smile widened.
“Oh, my boy…” Cam reached, and cupped the side of Sherlock’s head. “For them not to see what a special, delightful, joy of a person you are…”
Sherlock gave what might have been the ghost of a smile. “I fell.”
John pulled a doubtful face. “A smile doesn’t mean you’re giving me permission to be a dick, Sherlock. And neither does a kiss. It’s not a door-open or door-shut situation. Besides,” he shrugged, “I don’t know about you, but I’m not ready for that.” He looked away, his brain throwing up some choice images.
“Sherlock’s a girl.”
A little flutter had run through John’s stomach at that.
“Ocean,” John said, writing it clearly.
John how he felt.
"Helps if you're a bit more graceful than me," John let go, and took a step, trying not to wobble. "Shitting hell."
“Do you want to talk about it?” John asked, looking up.
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock shook his head.
“Thanks,” John sighed. “And… thanks again for the lift.”
“Tell me in the car.” John knocked on the teacher’s door. He went in and received a small lecture about the importance of school rules, and assured Ms Tressle he’d talk to Sherlock, and expected the other boy’s guardians to do the same. He came out, ready to tell Sherlock to go, but he was no longer in the chair.
Sherlock nodded, chasing John’s lips again as his fingers touched over John’s entrance.
Sherlock flashed a grin. He snatched at John’s wrist, pulling him to stand, and enveloping him in a hug – a proper, chest-to-chest hug.
“Not the kind that happens in heats,” Sherlock brought his knees up again. “Not the begging, breeding, bonding kind.” He pulled a face. “Everyone talks about it. Laughs about it. Well. Most people.”
“It’s… not that big.”
“He wasn’t there,” Sherlock almost laughed. “I fell asleep, and nested in his bed.”
“Let’s take a last look,” Greg nudged John. “There’s only do much time we can sit here being miserable, right?”
“Oh, ok,” Sherlock shrugged. “Are you working for him again, now?”
Mycroft gripped his arm again, as their parents walked into the sitting room, leaving their suitcases in the hallway.
Sherlock sighed. “Realise where the line is, big brother.” He picked up his bag, and carried it up to his room.
anything, but then I get worried that it’s you that doesn’t want anything?” He frowned. “Does that make sense?”
“She’s been lying to the entire school!”
“Without being a bit presumptuous, you’d think they’d have measures in place to deal with this sort of thing already,” John sighed.
“I think it’s a boy,” Sherlock said, squinting at his copy.
Sherlock grabbed the remote. “Are you watching this?”
“Don’t fall asleep,” John whispered.
“No… I’m confused. Why isn’t he angry?”
John chose some fitted maternity trousers with a hidden elastic band inside, though he barely needed it yet, and a blue shirt cut to accommodate a small bump. He pushed the curtain back, and held his arms out. “Yes?”
“Tea?”
“I love him!” Victor screamed. His dad back-handed him on the side of the head before dragging him down the steps. “Sherlock! Sherlock!”
Sherlock didn't respond.
John shook his head, and went to get dressed. He wasn’t booked in to work, that day, and he was planning on spending the voucher Sherlock had got him. He needed maternity jeans and trousers, a Moses basket, all sorts of things… That was likely more than was on the gift card. He would have to start eating into his compensation money.
“Your face is bruised, what –”
He spent the time at Cam’s working in the library, reading books and making notes, whilst Cam sat opposite and answered any questions Sherlock put to him.
The captain nodded, and Sherlock released his grip only to slip two fingers back into the wet heat of John's mouth. He pulled his hips back and slammed ruthlessly back into him, his cock throbbing with pleasure.
“I don’t know,” John uncrossed his arms, “I always assumed it was something to do with loving the person.”
“How old were you?”
“Indeed,” Mycroft said. “But there could be consequences that most people would rather avoid.”
“Get lost, Mycroft,” Sherlock was hissing, his red eyes glowing.
John turned at the sound of Greg’s raised voice. He edged over to the door, and listened.
Victor looked him over, glancing up at the stairs. “Well, whatever it is… You sure about this?”
John had to laugh when Sherlock asked for a knife and fork to eat his pizza with.
“Yes.”
“I don’t think less of you,” John said. “That’s… ok, I don’t know anything about omegas, or alphas for that matter, but if you said you didn’t want to… kiss… then I wouldn’t think that meant you really did, ok? I can take no for an answer.”
have been used to coerce him into sex. There was every chance he would never know for sure how willing he had been the night James Sholto had sex with him. The more he thought about it, the more tangled the truth seemed to get.
Mycroft didn't say
“See you at Christmas,” John said, gruffly. He handed Sherlock a pack of Fruit Pastilles. “They won’t melt in the car,” he explained.
John glanced up, quickly. Sherlock’s hand were tense on his cutlery, though his face showed not a drop of stress.
“All omegas are whores,” Siger said clearly. “All of you. Even, apparently, at your age.”
Sherlock almost laughed, the entire situation was so ridiculous.
John slammed the door behind him, and ran down the path, around the fence, and straight up to the Holmes’ front door. He banged on it.
“I don’t want anyone else,” John said, quietly. “But… I don’t know what he’ll think of this.”
“No,” Sherlock snapped, bundling the covers around himself. “Stick to your side.”
John raised a hand, and patted him on the shoulder. “Um. You can, if you ever want to. I mean... I can’t do much, but I can listen.” He looked around the room for something to change the subject. His gaze landed on the still-boxed laptop. “Is that a new MacBook?”
Sherlock sat up. “Are – are you old? What does that matter?”
There was a sudden cough from the bedroom across the landing. Sherlock quickly threw back the covers, and undid the window.
“To tell you to leave my brother alone,” he said. “And to remind you that your army pension makes paying rent in London nearly impossible, and that moving up north might be your best option.” He took a business card from his wallet, and John took it with a sneer. “Call, when you’re ready to make the move out of this shoebox, and to a new life, away from London.”
did you do to me, Sherlock?” His eyes flashed, rubies in the afternoon light.
‘He wouldn’t do that,’ Joseph shook his head. ‘He’s already married, you see. I’d be a home wrecker. I’m not doing that.’
“It’s not really about last night as such,” Sherlock said. “It’s more… what… could… happen.” He looked at his cup of tea, and wished he could burst into flames to avoid this.
Sherlock nodded. “I know…” he folded his arms around himself, like a hug. “Have a good first day, then.”
“We’re being told off,” John said, letting Sherlock pick her up.
“Your… John, please!” Sherlock wailed.
His alpha was alive.
“Or,” A soft voice said from the doorway, “there is a bakery around the corner?”
He did care. He cared so damn much he wanted to die.
Sherlock sniffed. “You… don’t want to be with me.”
Mycroft and Sherlock met eyes. “Sherlock, mind this tea, won’t you?” Mycroft walked past John. “It’s this way.”
John made a face.
“That’s probably very wise,” John said, trying not to sound too relieved. “You should talk to someone about it.”
Sherlock strode over, looking over John's shoulder easily and reading the screen. John tried not to flinch, but he couldn’t help tensing up a little. A natural response, he told himself. Perfectly natural to be on alert when your predator is within biting distance.
“That culture will be ready in half an hour. Sherlock?” Molly said, hopefully, from somewhere around Sherlock’s left elbow.
“It does suit you, to be fair,” John said, “but it’s a bit… much.”
John's lips tasted of James, which irked Sherlock even more than it ought to have, but part of him didn't care.
“Thanks.” Sherlock closed the window, and dived back into bed, tucking the covers around himself. John had to perch on the edge of the bed, his socked feet cold. He didn’t say anything, but it was mean of Sherlock not to share the blanket. He usually did.
“Ah!” he suddenly flinched as the hot feeling came again, making him arch his back, grab the desk for support. “Ow. God, ow…” he shook his head, trying to stop tears from coming, trying to stop his panicked breath coming in little gasps.
Cam seemed delighted that Mycroft had asked. “Ah, I’m afraid I’m one of those terribly dull people who takes a severe interest in their family tree. I have been researching and keeping records since I was very young, much as my parents did. It’s sort of a family tradition.” He lifted his glass of dark red wine, and pressed some of the liquid to his mouth without actually letting any in. “Of course, we are a terribly dull lineage. Alphas and Omegas as far back as you can trace.” He shrugged, as if it was incredibly boring.
"No you won't."
"You haven't hurt me before."
Sherlock ran away despite Lestrade still shouted questions after him.
"No! That is not the case!" Sherlock protested. "I have to tell you something."
"Of course." Sherlock cleared his throat. "I planned to check in the Yard today. I surprise Lestrade."
"Nothing." SH
"It's a binary code..." Started Sherlock, but Moriarty rubbed his forehead dissatisfied.
"Oh, no, I ensured it." John eyes widened. Who I mingled with?
Finally he saw John at the street as he walked to the flat. His heart beat fiercely. Oh, God! He missed John terribly. He wanted to run to him, hug him close, but he can't. He had to wait to John do the first step. John was in the flat, Sherlock felt it.
John was grateful for the reassuring touches. He ran his fingers into Sherlock's hair. He just sat on his alpha's cock for a few minutes while Sherlock petted him.
"I was warned about you. I've been on your website, too. Brilliant stuff, loved it!"
He was definitely not okay. He even smoked a cigarette. Didn't talked. Composed lethargic sonatas. He's grieved. It was unusual. John was helpless. Mycroft told him, he has to stay with him. John doubted it helps. He also saw that photos. Irene Adler was breath taking. Also very smart. A true match for Sherlock, John thought sadly. Yes, Sherlock liked her. Maybe it was more. He felt jealousy. He broke up with Sarah with reason. Of course he didn't dared to hope, despite of Sherlock's alpha showed courting behaviour towards him. Sherlock clearly told John, he separates himself from his alpha's want. He avoided him for a while after the incident. John was old, average, boring. He sighed.
Sherlock couldn't finish the sentence, because John grabbed his collar and pulled Sherlock's face to his.
"Fantastic!" John praised him again. Sherlock's alpha felt far so pleased. It was unpleasant.
"Nice letter paper. Czech made. No fingerprints?"
"Is that a British Army Browning L9A1in your pocket, or are you just happy to see me?" A thin man in Westwood suit appeared. His fan, his enemy. "Jim Moriarty. Hi!" Sherlock pointed the gun at him. "I have a snipper to dirtying  hands instead of mine." Little red point danced around John's head. "I gave you a tiny glimpse to my world. I'm a specialists, like you."
Relief came as a tsunami, swept them. Sherlock pulled himself off from John.
Moran is a dead man walking. His time is counted. He is the only barrier between him and the way home.
John nestled close to him. Sherlock buried his nose into John's hair, it was so reassuring.
John immediately marched into the room. Sherlock lay  on the bed paler like ever. His eyes were shut. Watson climbed on the bed next to him in doctor mode. He examined his pupils, checked his slow, weak pulse. His skin was cold.
John tilted back his head over Sherlock's shoulder. The detective's hands touched John everywhere. He stroked his ribs, massaged John's nipples with his thumb.
"It took him five seconds" told Ms. Adler from behind. "We should talk."
"The killer must have driven her to Lauriston Gardens. He could only keep her case by an accident if it was in the car. Nobody could be seen it without drawing attention-particularly a man, which is statistically more likely. So he'd feel compelled to get rid of it. Wouldn't have taken him more than a five minutes to realise his mistake. I checked every backstreet wide enough for a car five minutes from Lauriston Gardens, and anywhere you could dispose of a bulky object without being observed. Took me less than an our to find the right skip."
Mycroft's house looked like a miniature Buckingham Palace. The older Holmes enjoyed his afternoon tea, when John burst into his home like  an enraged bull.
"Shut up! You did enough! Leave me alone!" Sherlock felt he has two different personality, and his alpha was louder as ever.
John told Mrs. Hudson he would move out from the flat to move together with Mary. He didn't want to Mary live in Baker Street, it just wouldn't be right.
"There was no case!" Lestrade shouted after him.
"Sherlock!" John ran up on the stairs. "Are you okay? I heard what happened in the news."
Tower of London, Pentonville Prison and the Bank of England were all broken into at the same time by him. He taunted Sherlock with his graffitied GET SHERLOCK at the scene of the crime.
"We are compatible based on our blood. It's a fact."
"Yes. And I can reed you military career in you face and in your leg, and I can tell your gender without a smell of it.
"Should I have asked your permission first?"
It hurt Sherlock's self-esteem a little, but he was succeed after all. John seemed happy.
Sherlock frowned.
Sherlock's alpha winced harder. Sherlock didn't liked it... at all.
"No."
"You can't forbid me to court you."
John tried to follow the events, and got interested about the case, became disappointed to left behind. How could be useful? Meanwhile Mrs. Hudson kept chirping.
"I was so lonely. I felt myself useless. But when I met you, and we started to solve mysteries together, and you healed my psychosomatic limp..."  Maybe it wasn't the right thing to say, it happened with the intellectual part of Sherlock after all, but the alpha only smiled.
"I don't know how to do a relationship, John." Sherlock said quietly. He saw John's naked form was covered with love bites, his alpha took advantage on his blogger, and Sherlock himself didn't even remembered it. It made him mad.
"Brilliant! Yes! Four serial suicides and now a note. Oh, it's Christmas. Mrs. Hudson, I'll be late. Might need some food."
"Sorry?" John asked surprised.
With his cock inside the omega, he moved backwards, he pulled John with himself until he sat on his lap. He hugged him close from behind.
"You all right guys?" Lestrade approached to them. Sherlock growled. John seemed wounded and the genius held him as some kind of treasure. "Oh!" The inspector held up his hands. "It's okay Sherlock, It's just me. I'm bonded remember? Have a wife who cheating on me in your opinion. John needs help. Let the paramedics check on him."
"Mrs. Hudson!!!" Sherlock shouted again, and she ran.
"Gas leak." The room was ruined a bit, and ventilated better as before but Sherlock was fine, only that mattered for John. "How is Sarah? Is her mattress comfy enough?"
Few minutes passed until Mycroft's phone beeped again.
This chapter is managed to short. I had no more inspiration for this, but I didn't want to wait any longer with the updating.
"Non of the others did."
"Good night, John."
"So, this is all yours." What a messy alpha. "That's a scull." John pointed over the fireplace.
"Well, I knew you found the case, I'm not stupid."
"Tell him you're alive" John replied immediately.
"It isn't the same phone. It's new. Someone tired a lot to got one looks like the same. Your blog has a wide community."
"The couch, indeed." Even better.
"I wasn't in rut."
"And now I'm giving you one. Take your time. I want your best game."
"So you trusted better in Molly and few homeless instead of me?" John wasn't only angry, he was deeply disappointed in Sherlock. "Oh, God! Your parents also knew, that's why they didn't came to your funeral."
"Did you?" Sherlock, as usual, doesn't answered unnecessary questions.
"So soon after Sherlock." Mrs. Hudson complained.  She felt bad about John is leaving.
"I told you to wait outside! I wont climb through the window."
"Told me what?"
"I'm a consulting detective." John never heard about consulting detectives before. "Only one in the world, I invented the job." He sound proud.
What riding crop? Is this guy some kind of pervert? John screamed inside. He is gonna kill Mike for this. He don't want a flatmate. He don't even wanna move out his actual flat. What is Mike planning in his head?
"You sounds like Sherlock." Lestrade fell silent for a minute. " I divorce."
"Yes, like everyone. Do you really not know that the Earth goes round the Sun?" Damn it John!
"Who said anything about flatmates?" John was confused.
"No."
"In progress." SH
"And where is the case? They should pay for her as much as she ask."
"Trust me. I won't cheat or leave you. We deal this together."
Sherlock Holmes wasn't an ordinary alpha. He desperately tried to suppress every instinct, what his inner alpha tried convince. He didn't act territorial, nor get interested about omegas... Dull, useless gender, really. However, he had an omega friend once, Victor Trevor. He was charming, funny, clever even. But when they used to get older, things changed. Sherlock started to feel strange desires, he wanted to possess. His parents told him, it's natural. Sherlock don't wanted this feelings. Especially, when Victor told him, he is not that kind of alpha, as any omega would want.
"And what's wrong with the landline?"
"Which was it, in Afghanistan or Iraq?" He hated to repeat himself. Is this man really so dumb?
"John comes home with me." A deep voice grumbled from behind. Before John could turned around, Sherlock grabbed his hip and dug his fingers on it.
"It's dead or alive, Dr. Watson."-MH
"It's not the right time."
Moriarty also stood up, like he wanted to match their heights.
"Look at him, dashing about... My husband was just the same. But you are more the sitting-down type, I can tell. I'll make you that cuppa, you rest your leg."
Moriarty quickly retreated as he ran up the stairs and jumped out of the window.
"Really? It was a big improvement. Your mouth is too small now."
I would never be your friend. John horrified inside.
"That's enough!" John's voice was rigid. He stood on the stairs, worn a jumper with jeans. He heard Sherlock arguing himself, and it upsets him. "You two want a lobotomy? Cause I can arrange it!"
The smaller man rocked his hips back and fort.
Sherlock seemed to be considering.
"Fine, I'll tell him and I still won't help you" he said vehemently, ready to leave.
"What are you doing here?"
While he selected the food, out of the tail of his eye he could see someone slipped a letter under the sitting room's door.
"Mr. Holmes, if it would be the end of the world, and it was the last night..."
"I have a sponsor. For every life I take, money goes to my kids. The more I kill the better off they'll be. You see? It's nicer than you think."
"If your snipper pull the trigger we both gonna fly."
"It's free zone safety."
Warning! Sexual content.
"I did."
"Don't lie to me!" SH
"Do you know what I love?"  The detective asked as he peppered John's whole face with kisses. "Your nose! So cute."
"I'm not his date!" John denied vehemently. Angelo didn't bothered himself, and told John how Sherlock saved him from prison.
"You reading about Alpha-Omega relationships?" He finally asked in disbelief.
"Yeah, okay, I did. But the flirting is over Sherlock. Daddy's had enough now! Show you what I can do. It's just a friendly warning. Back off! Well, I have loved this, playing our little game."
Sherlock bite down on John's neck. Not hard enough to leave a mark, only a warning.
John bit him and it wasn't a playful bite. Sherlock licked his lips and tasted blood. He growled.
"I wanted to protect you, not to risk your life. I had to finish Moriarty's men off, so I can guaranty our safety. If I had died, you could going on with your life, as you did." Sherlock's voice cut like a blade, the acid in his voice was unmistakable.
"No. I keep you safe, warm."
"Don't play Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde! You know my feelings. You are... Sherlock is complicated, and I doubt bonding behind his back will make any good."
"Well, he won't be your assistant."
"Mrs. Hudson, isn't is time for your evening soother?"
John turned and faced with the genius. Sherlock nodded at his brother and started to led the doctor towards the corridor. His room placed at the end of it.
But inside him nothing made it presence, like his alpha replaced by a deep dark space.
"So? There's hospitals full of people dying, doctor. Why don't you go crying their bedside and see what good it does them?"
"What's new about this one? You wouldn't have come to me otherwise."
"My key can open any door anywhere. A few tiny lines of computer code. The man with the key is king, and honey you should see me in a crown." Moriarty straightened himself like a peacock.
"Bit not good, yeah."
With a final forceful thrust he came inside John.
"Of course we'll be needing two." It looked like Mike and Mrs. Hudson conspired against him.
"Oh... you're good. When I die they won't get much, my kids" he explained. " Not a lot of money in driving cabs."
“…I know.” Sherlock touched his thigh, feeling soft pyjama bottoms. Someone had dressed him. “Who dressed me?”
Sherlock scratched at his forearm, trying to suppress the urge to stab himself with the pencil. “I don’t need anyone.”
“Oh…” John sat down in his desk chair. “Oh, ok. That’s that, then.” He put the stick down. “That’s ok, then.”
“Do you want me to spell it out?” John went red, and pushed his hips against Sherlock’s. “I just… it’s been a rough fucking day, and…”
Sherlock went up to his room, and dropped his homework on his bed.
“It’s an option,” John shrugged. A great weight had settled on his chest, and his throat ached. “I just don’t see what else… it’s going to go its whole life knowing its mother didn’t bond, and its father was a… absent.” He rubbed at the scars on his arms. “When it could have a real family, where the omega and alpha love each other, and want to look after it. Both of them.” He rubbed at his eyebrows. “Sorry. It’s…”
Sherlock was bored already, he was expecting something exciting when the doorbell rang! Not some posh, deluded, country boy Omega, who had clearly just finished a heat two days prior and was still experiencing hormonal imbalances, to come in to his flat and insist that he watch a stupid documentary about local superstition and a military base in the sticks. Sherlock could very clearly see that this man truly believed that he
and over the past twenty-four hours I’ve treated that one very poorly even though he’s done nothing to deserve it, I’ve attacked him, ignored him and worst of all made him believe that I don’t care for him, but I do, John, more than anything and I would
"You said if you
for...
"John! You are amazing! You are fantastic!" Sherlock called when he pulled back and started walking a bit faster, shoving a hand into his coat to pull out his notebook. John swiped a hand over his lips to remove the slobbers Sherlock had left and followed after the Alpha.

They thrust frantically against each other for what seemed like and age until Sherlock growled into John’s neck and released himself in his trousers, the fluids seeping through the fabric and dampening the back of John’s. The feel of the warm liquid against his backside set John off and he keened loudly and came in his own trousers. Sherlock stroked John through his orgasm until he was sure his Omega was finished then gently released the back of John’s neck revealing a huge purple bruise, satisfied with the state of John’s nape, Sherlock bent down to lick long strips up across the mark and then instinctively reached below his belt to gather a small glob of come to rub into the bruised flesh. Now no other Alpha would try to claim John, Sherlock had marked him and his scent was mixed with the Omega’s, that's how it would remain 'til John showered.
"What is-" Sherlock started when he strode into the bedroom but froze when he saw what John had clutched in his hand.
to comfort John when he was miserable, hence the twisty, crampy stomach. Sherlock glanced out the corner of his eye when John’s head swivelled back from the window to look straight ahead, Sherlock desperately wanted to say something to the man and cheer him up but not only could he not think of anything, he didn’t want to say something and encourage any ‘
Sherlock went for a drive across the moors to think some more about his theory and the more he thought, the more convinced he became that it was the sugar, he and John had done, ate and drank all the same things since they’d arrived, all expect for the sugar because John was a strange man and preferred milk in his tea to sugar.
“As you requested we are keeping you close by for the time being so we are starting you off in Scotland, Moriarty was running a drug cartel out of a small village in the highlands, we have reason to believe that all the residents of the village are involved though we can’t be sure, fortunately it is a very popular tourist destination so you’ll have no problem integrating yourself. Your task is simple, acquire data on how many are involved, remove the leader from the equation and notify me of your findings, my people will take care of the rest.” Mycroft handed Sherlock a file with new credit cards and ID’s all with the name Mr. Shane Watson printed on them just as Sherlock had requested, he had wanted to keep a piece of John with him during his little adventure and even if it was only his name, it brought Sherlock some comfort.
"I think we should stop for some air." Sherlock said finally breaking the silence and John looked at him curiously.
"I’ll
"Look all you have to do is keep quiet for five more minutes whilst he writes me a prescription and books me a scan date and then we can leave." John soothed and Sherlock nodded.
"Why do you assume I’m asking for something? Perhaps I’m just concerned about my big brothers welfare." Sherlock pouted and leaned against the 4x4 as both John and Mycroft collectively snorted.
"Okay, listen to me. The heat I had three months ago, was nothing short of a

’ just fine when he pinned John down, rutting against him and rubbing his scent all over the Doctor in an effort scare of any other Alphas. Which was another thing, John hadn’t even seen Sherlock
"Ah! Here comes loves young dream. Glad to see you boys have surfaced alive and well." John blushed at the Scotsman but was smiling none the less.
"Uh, it was worth a try." Then he dove to the fire place and started ripping things up, desperately trying to find his secret pack of cigarettes, they should've been in his desk but they had mysteriously vanished and there was no way John could have found them so that only left...
, he couldn’t blame John, it was one thing for an Alpha to resist his instincts, it was another for an Omega to do the same, let alone on the verge of heat and surrounded with Alpha pheromones like the ones Fletcher and then Sherlock where letting off. When Sherlock raised his head again he realized that the smell of John on his clothes had calmed him down and it was then that Sherlock had an idea and decided to do a little experiment when he returned to the car. He had made sure to be especially cruel to John and upset him, not a nice thing to do yes but necessary to test his theory.
"Well how would you feel if I told you that, I’ve never submitted to an Alpha in that way before? How would you feel if I told you that the only thing I let Greg do was satisfy my physical need and nothing more, no knotting? And
agreed on two. Sherlock growled at himself, no, this was not a priority, finding John was and Sherlock had no idea where to look but he figured going back downstairs might be a good start, it was just a shame that his feet couldn’t move.
"That should bring things to a head." Sherlock reasoned and Henry’s face went white.
has our charming Omega got off too whilst you are here completing domestic tasks in his absence?" Sherlock hated that smug, snarky, snippy bastard and he was about to shove that umbrella somewhere unpleasant and open it up but then an evil idea popped into his head, he smiled, a genuine full blown smile that had Mycroft tensing.
’ whilst he clutched John protectively and ushered them both inside the taxi. Once the cabbie started driving however, Sherlock abandoned his enthusiasm to accompany John and swapped it for a whole novels worth of bitching. By the time they had arrived at the surgery John suspected the
"You don't understand." John narrowed his eyes, he really couldn’t be arsed with Sherlock’s crap today.
Almost as if sensing she was being scrutinised, his daughter gave a grumble and opened her eyes to see who would dare disturb her slumber, Sherlock’s breath caught in his throat when he saw John’s eyes staring up at him. Of course she would have John’s eyes, it was the only possibility that made any sense given the ratio of her facial structure but still, it was a lovely surprise to see. The baby in arms must have been very confused and unnerved by his staring and sombre expression because she started to whimper and sensing that she was about let out an ear piercing screech that could potentially wake up John, Sherlock decided to follow his instincts and repositioned her so her head was on his shoulder to give her full access to his scent, with one hand holding her to him and the other stroking her back as he rocked her back and forth making shushing noises to soothe her.
!’ from behind him and had a moment of guilt for shooting the dog but it passed, he hadn’t been in his right mind with that drug in his system and his heat so close so John just finished his meal and drank his tea whilst he waited for Sherlock to come back; he didn’t notice Lestrade approaching but he definitely felt the slap across his Shoulder where a bite mark lived.
!?" Sherlock let out a deep, amused chuckle at the horrified look on his Omega’s face, John looked like he was going to have a seizure. There was water
This was proving to be very difficult to watch, Sherlock had assumed he was braced for watching John’s reaction to the drug but there was no way any Alpha could be prepared to watch their Omega run around in the dark terrified of the sounds Sherlock was playing over the speaker system. Right at this very moment, Sherlock hated himself, hated himself with more passion than he could possibly imagine. John was trembling so hard he could see it on these fuzzy monitors, he watched the poor man stop and reach into his pocket for his phone and then he heard his own phone start to ring but he fought to ignore it and kept watch on the screen before him.
Of course it could, he was Sherlock Holmes after all.
"Straight through, sir." The soldier called in parting and John nearly crumpled in half with relief.
"I’m going to put a call in to the local force, let them know what happened. You three should go back to the village; they can collect statements from all of you tomorrow." Lestrade told them after a moment of silence before striding off to the right and pulling out his mobile, Sherlock nodded at the man’s back and went to take a hold of John to pull him towards Grimpen but the Omega doctor shifted around him to head over towards Henry who had slid down to sit at the base of a tree, a blank expression on his face, John crouched down and laid a hand on the fellow Omega’s knee.
"Brilliant!" John scoffed and Sherlock looked over at him, okay so maybe he was wrong, John, was in fact, still upset and now looking a little distressed.
"Well John don't just sit there, answer the door." John groaned and jumped up, this was going to be a long day, he could tell.
been drugged." John’s eyes widened and Sherlock gave him a comforting squeeze.
A few minutes later Sherlock was bent over the bench laughing himself sick whilst John was trying to wake up the poor unconscious DI who had fainted into the bush behind him.
John stumbled up the stairs to the flat, laden with bags of all shapes and sizes and if he was honest a bit guilty, he really hadn’t meant to spend that much money but... at least he wouldn’t be unprepared for when the baby arrived. John snorted at himself and just made it to the landing when all 6’2" of his lover came flying out of the living room and glomped him.
child?" Sherlock asked quietly, vulnerable. He was sure he hadn’t misread John over the time he’d known the Omega, he’d seen him gaze longingly at little broods of families as they had torn through London on cases, he’d seen him play and laugh with Lestrade’s children when they were invited to the detective inspectors birthday party a few weeks ago, he’s seen him cradle a helpless infant in his arms who had been abandoned in a freezing house by a murder who had killed his mate and ran away to save himself but more importantly he’d see how happy John was when the child had accepted his comfort and affection, returning it with little gurgles and he’d seen how devastated he was when social services took the child away with them. He knew John wanted children; he loved children so it could only mean that the thought of having
"You must have been dosed with it elsewhere, when you went to the lab, maybe. You saw those pipes – pretty ancient, leaky as a sieve; and they were carrying the gas, so ... Um, ketchup, was it, or brown ...?" Sherlock asked, once again trying to distract John from further questioning but John was no idiot and something in Sherlock’s story just didn’t make sense.
"What is it? Are we in trouble?" He asked and Sherlock caught the waft of another Omega.
That was when Sherlock caught sight of the mirror across the room and saw his lovely little Omega looking back at him through the glass before a smirk took hold of his lips and John gave one more mighty push down against Sherlock’s upwards thrust so his knot popped inside and just like that John was coming and clenching hard around him. This was the moment that instinct took over completely and Sherlock shot up to sink his teeth into the back of John’s neck, finalizing their bond as his knot expanded and streams of release shot inside John’s body. John moaned at the feeling of being filled with Sherlock’s seed that seemed to be an unlimited source and he tried to pull forward into a more accommodating position but Sherlock’s teeth wouldn’t release John until the first wave of his orgasm had subsided. When that finally happened and Sherlock pulled back gently, John didn’t have the strength to do anything and they both ended up falling backwards onto the bed, still locked together.
The most beautiful, enticing, sweet, heady scent Sherlock has ever come across practically punched him in the face causing the towel in his hand to hit the floor, his eyes darkened to near black and his cock to rose ‘til it brushed his stomach with his knot forming at the base.

"Mr Holmes, they were the footprints, of a, gigantic hound." Henry repeated slowly and Sherlock brought his hands to his face in prayer stance.

"Huge; red eyes?" Sherlock asked.
Sherlock, still lost to the primal mind that had control for the moment lay flat against John and nuzzled his hair, it was John who came out of the pheromone induced haze first and realized what had happened, what Sherlock had done. He knew he had to do something but he didn't want to move and startle the big content Alpha. John swallowed and turned his head slowly to the side, staring at the upholstery.
it was in the sugar." John insisted and Sherlock couldn’t take the weight of his mate’s inquisitive stare and looked away before making a show of checking his watch.
’? In John and Sherlock’s room?
"But...
Still, if it wasn’t for that moment his eyes met John’s back in that hospital room he probably wouldn’t have realized something very important. Sherlock was going to survive this and then when he was finished, when Moriarty and everything to do with him was erased from the face of the earth, Sherlock was coming back home to John and Charlotte and nothing was going to stop him.
, the pleasure he’d felt from that pressure against his nape was like nothing he’d ever felt before and this was all just so bloody confusing! He supposed a reason he trusted Sherlock not to bite was because he knew the man but then again he’d

Once John and Mrs. Hudson were securely in the cab and heading back towards Baker Street, Sherlock emerged from his hiding place and headed off towards the entrance of the cemetery himself, he had just taken a step through the gate when a black car with darkened windows pulled up in front of him and a door opened to reveal Mycroft casually sitting in the back.
"Anyway like I was saying, my heat is due sometime in the next five days and I only just noticed the symptoms this morning so we do have some time. I normally don't do this until my heat officially starts but I'll take some birth control, that should rein in the hormonal fluctuations in my scent that are messing with your head and then I'll get packed okay?" Sherlock shifted around the bed warily.
“Not saying ‘no’ can be the same as not saying ‘yes’,” Sherlock said, voice low and deep, a comforting note through John’s chest. “When you were little… you didn’t want any of that to happen, but you didn’t say ‘no’, then, either. Do you see why it bothers me? Why it makes me want to rip him limb from limb?"
The grip left his sleeve, and he walked over to where Mycroft and his mother were watching koi swim in a pond.
‘So do I, until an omega lad turns up. It’s all bullshit, saying you like lads or lasses. It depends on the person.’
“You’re
“This really sucks,” John said to the ceiling. Then sighed. “Sorry. Bad choice of words there...” he gave Sherlock’s hair a stroke. “Does it always feel like that?”
Lestrade’s voice softened. “You know he’s not the only one who cares.”
“I guess.” Lestrade stuck a plaster onto his arm. “If he hadn’t been pregnant, he’d’ve had no trouble.”
“I can try,” John set his jaw, determined. “I don’t have to be a vampire. I can stay here, not go outside… I can beat this. Sherlock…” he reached for him, “you can help me?”
“There’s room enough for two.”
‘Sounds perfect,’ John smiled. ‘Fish and chips?’
“My brother was supposed to bring my things after we… mated,” Sherlock blushed. “I don’t know.”
“You can’t delay maturity forever,” John said. “And it can wreak havoc with fertility, bone density…”
The very thing he had given up.
“Work wife?” Sherlock frowned.
Hating himself, and the entire world, Sherlock folded the tissue over and over into a rudimentary pad shape and thickness, before yanking up his underwear to trap it against his hateful body.
Waiting to die.
“Quite,” Sherlock nodded. “He… is somewhat convinced you have stolen me. Or tricked me.”
It was still familiar, and still welcome.
John cleared his throat. “As I say, it’s basic. But you can make it your own, put pictures up, have your clothes and things in… You can choose to have the walls painted a different colour if you like, I just went for magnolia because it went with everything.”
“Oh god…” Sherlock’s legs gave way, and John had to catch him under the arms. “Oh god, oh god…”
Sherlock nodded.
‘Excellent.’
“It’s lovely to meet you,” John said, making no move to shake her hand – her mate’s body language was all-too easy to read. “You have a wonderful home.”
“Not yet,” the corporal shrugged. “She’s… worried about me, going on deployment, all the time. Worries I’ll be hurt, you know? Well…” the corporal’s eyes flicked to John’s shoulder. “I’m sure you understand, sir.”
Possibly the man himself didn’t even know he had done it. It was equally possible that no one who wasn’t Sherlock Holmes would have noticed the pause. There was a fraction of a second’s hesitation before John lifted his hand and shook Sherlock’s.
Mycroft pulled an almost-smile, and looked around the room.
John plucked at the filthy shirt he wore. “I lay dead in this,” he sniffed. “That’s disgusting.”
Mycroft stood, taller, but John didn’t back down. “You think I’m the only person who made Sherlock the way he is today? Made him think so much like the father we despise?”
“It’s ok,” Sherlock said eventually. “If I end up being an omega, I’ll just get an alpha to bite it harder and make a real mess of my neck.”
“He was ok,” John said. “Mum… have I got to have… babies?”
“It’s big?” Sherlock raised his eyebrows and looked at John’s bump.
still covering him. The memories of the night before suddenly rushed back, making him blush and shift nervously, taking stock of his situation.
John clicked off the stopwatch, and darted to the desk, snatching up the stick.
John stared. “Just like that?”
John loved him more than ever.
Sherlock leaned his head into the touch. “Maybe.”
“I’m clean,” Sherlock stood, going for his belt. “I never… without a condom, with…”
The party wound down eventually, and Sherlock spent the last hour of it watching the guests bustle around taking photos of John. They even took one of Sherlock and John together, both of them looking (as Mycroft icily remarked to his brother, later) as if they’d been caught doing something naughty. Then, it was time for goodbyes.
Siger coughed gruffly. ‘It’s not nice to talk about, but it does happen. That’s one reason I almost miss the whole arranged bonding thing. It made the whole idea less worrying, for parents and their children. If your omega son was caught alone on a dark night…’ he shuddered, and Sherlock mirrored it. He didn’t like to think about it, but the possibility was there. Outside his protective school environment, he’d only have to walk down the street close to his heat and be at risk of being bonded with a total stranger.
“He’s ok with it,” Sherlock turned the new handset off, the on again as it restarted. “If we are.”
John groaned. “Oh god. Really?”
One of the staff let them in, and Sherlock was just hanging his coat up when Cam came out of a room, taking his reading glasses off.
And Sherlock knew, from personal experience, that it would be years before it ever did. Moriarty had built a barrier around John’s heart. Whatever love John and Sherlock had before, they would need to tear down the barrier, first.
“Your bed smells amazing.”
It hadn’t felt the same, when John did it. No whooshing sensation, no white noise in his ears, no gaps in his memory where he still wasn’t entirely sure what had happened to him. He remembered every moment of his kisses with John. Physically… it had almost been the same. The pressure on his mouth, the warmth…
“Ok…” John pressed the wand into the gel, and moved it slightly, getting his bearings. “Ok… there’s your insides…”
“Looking after himself?” John frowned suddenly. “What do you mean?”
Sherlock laughed softly, his soft touches making John relax. “I suppose they’re glad you’re staying.”
They both smiled stupidly at each other.
Oh god.
“But you’ve not even had breakfast!”
. He was
‘D’you have to smoke?’
“Yes, I knew I was going to meet someone I was going to marry,” John said. “I didn’t get
A knock came, and a man Sherlock didn’t recognise let himself in. He was tall, and thin, with grey hair and a beard, and the sort of frameless glasses Sherlock thought made people look a bit like Father Christmas, though this was the only similarity.
The two boys’ smiles met their mirrors in the other’s face.
“With you?” Sherlock looked at the angel.
It was a relief to see Sherlock in his own clothes, again. Clean ones, that hadn’t spent the night in a drugs den. Mycroft had been over, and John spent a few minutes adjusting the furniture to try and remove the other alpha’s smell, without being super-obvious about it. Sherlock was setting up his new phone.
“Lucy can be moved by ambulance,” Mycroft said. “Think of it as a holiday.”
to the point of Sherlock arriving. And then let him die.
“No, and Christ, I’m glad you didn’t. I’d never say I regret that – I’m not an idiot. Just let me say what I need to say!”
‘Because it seems to me,’ John said softly, ‘that you’re worried about me not wanting you, which you should know is bullshit. But you think it’s because of something you’ve done. You told me about the kiss, so… there must be something else. Mustn’t there?’
"Lestrade. He has a case."
“You still want to be one, but you can’t be,” Harry clarified. Is that right?”
“Mine,” Sherlock snarled, breath washing over John’s ear, making him whimper. “My mate.”
“John!”
So, to hear that Sherlock wasn’t interested in omegas felt like a weight being lifted.
Mycroft sat up. “You love him?”
The nurse shook her head. “Not yet, John, I’m sorry. Maybe in a couple of days –”
Sherlock didn’t move.
Sherlock kissed his head. “Merry Christmas Eve.”
“Don’t you like blood?” John started mopping it up with some cotton.
“Well, fucking try to. Think about where I am, and – and what that means. Doesn’t matter what anyone wants, or thinks. His job is to keep my body alive for as long as he can. That’s all he cares about…”
"Yes, well..." Greg scratched the back of his head, watching Sherlock settle cross-legged beside the first corpse and start to collect tissue samples. "It's not simple as all that. You must know what the Holmes family are like? I mean... You know Sherlock and I were once -"
Lestrade held his hands up. “Look, he said he was going back to Baker Street, and then coming here. I’ve not seen him since this morning!”
Over the next few days, there were visitors.
He smiled.
“You will be,” Sherlock said. “I’ll make sure of it.”
John cleared his throat. “We will sort it, Mycroft, I know we’ve been under your feet, and Sherry, too…”
The bus went over a road hump, and John bumped into Sherlock’s arm. It wasn’t unpleasant.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I’m sorry, Doctor Watson isn’t here.”
There was a tentacle wrapped around his arm, another coiled around and through his fingers, and his legs were knotted up with the things. If they chose to move without being careful, they could very likely rip John in half. And those suckers, although soft and kiss-like for now, had a nasty bite, he knew. The creature – mer-man? – was stronger than he was, but John couldn’t see his face to check if he was awake.
Charles had responded with a small card of dark paper with a violin on it in silver (he had to know Sherlock played), and a signature. Sherlock had put it on his shelf for a couple of days, and then moved it to his desk drawer. It was nice to get things, but they weren’t doing much for how much he missed John. Sherlock hadn’t even opened the packet of fruit pastilles, and instead had them in his pencil pot looking like a fat felt-tip amongst the pens.
“Why?”
"Wish I could see pictures."
“Oh, shit. I’m sorry. Do you want to talk about it?”
He could tell – there was a bubbling, crackling feeling when he inhaled. He could taste blood, taste it in his nose, somehow.
Sherlock had regretted them having sex.
“You’ve not met many babies, have you?” Sherry said. “Five outfits a day sounds perfectly reasonable.”
John held his arms out, and had her passed back over. He smiled at her, at her dark blue eyes and tufts of dark hair. “This,” he said, “is Lucy Watson-Holmes.”
John tried to memorise the feel of sherlock’s hand in his. What parts of themselves had they never shared, or touched? So many. They barely knew each other. They shouldn’t have even been friends. But there was something connecting them, whether they understood it or not.
“Did you have a good term, dear?” his mother asked from the front seat.
“Oh, fancy that. How did you meet?”
John ran himself a glass of water. “I thought it was… you know.”
“Oh, touched a nerve, have I?”
There was a moment of embarrassment for both of them as Sherlock’s cock was freed from his trousers, and the difference between the two of them was starkly apparent.
“You’re sorry?” Victor mocked.
“Mm,” John squeezed Sherlock’s hand, and let him go. “I’m tired.”
Sherlock rolled his eyes at himself. He needed to get a grip, text back.
It was the worst night of Sherlock’s life.
Kisses continued, breathy names whispered back and forth like prayers. John shuddered at the growing warmth inside him, and he smiled against Sherlock’s lips as those long, deft fingers stroked over his throat, down over his collarbones, his chest. There was a slightly sticky moment as Sherlock’s fingers crested over John’s nipple, and Sherlock paused.
Heads-up for an adult trying, and failing, to explain the birds and the bees.
Sherlock pressed his phone against his head.
Sherlock looked back at his phone, his lips going thin. “I don’t think that’s a good idea.”
“I know,” Craig said. “So you two carry on. And I’m sorry. About before… I don’t deal with things like I should. This… feels like a bit of a wake-up call.” He held his hand out. “Sherlock.”
She pressed a button, and moved the wand, and suddenly the image settled.
Sherlock went quiet, then. John left him for a moment, and went to boil the kettle. He went back into the room when the tea had brewed, finding Sherlock still shirtless, with Pixie on his chest, trying to get her to raise her head to see him.
“It’s ok,” John pulled him close, so Sherlock was leaning against his chest. He stroked Sherlock’s hair, and kissed it, not caring they were at school, that anyone might see.
An alpha’s command, that Sherlock responded to like a shot, standing, and looking on, head lowered, submissive, as John got to his feet.
“Ok…” John rubbed his nose and cleared his throat. “You, er… You ok?”
Sherlock looked over, his eyes widening. “What?”
But John hardly noticed. He was pelting all over the field for the ball, throwing it to his team-mates hard, and knocking out two of the batting team before they called it a day.
And then it all went wrong.
are you talking about?” Sherlock asked.
“You don’t have a lot of stuff,” James observed as John shut the boot of the taxi, and paid the driver. “Aren’t there more boxes?”
“No. No, no, no… No. No…” John reached out, and was grateful when Sherlock took his hands. “No, I…”
“Bar a little break in the middle,” John added, thinking of his six years of military service. “I’ve known you for longer than I’ve not.”
“… Sherlock isn’t here.”
John shrugged.
you here? Aside from wanting to drag me so effectively through the dirt?”
John met them all, and had to smile as he found himself entirely enveloped in the sort of acceptance he hadn’t felt in a long, long time.
Another scent rose into the air.
“I like what you’ve done with the place,” John said as they got upstairs. He took off his backpack and put it beside the sofa, just like he used to when he’d get in from school, all those years ago. An ache of longing – longing for the past – ran through his chest. He looked around as Sherlock followed him in, looking at John for a moment, before going to stand near the mantelpiece as if getting too close to John was unthinkable.
“For us?”
“About…?”
Neither of them even considered that John wouldn’t walk Sherlock back to his dorm. The alpha’s urge to protect – to protect someone who was clearly vulnerable – was up, and he would rather have stuck himself in the eye than left Sherlock’s side for a moment.
Their hands were still grasped together.
From the way Sherlock froze, his back stiffening, it was obvious that it certainly did.
John leaned close.
Sherlock had toyed with a few names, but he was happy to leave that up to John.
Sherlock was curled onto his side, his body a ‘C’ shape around his daughter, arms encircling her sleeping body without touching her, his face close to hers. His clothes were the same John had left him in that morning, and his hair looked like it needed a comb. Pixie was in a different sleepsuit, and looked immaculate. Her blonde hair was swept to one side, and her rosebud mouth was slightly pursed in sleep. The room smelled of warmth, and milk, and bodies, and it wasn’t at all unpleasant.
When they got back to the bunks, John picked up his washbag and towel, and excused himself as Sherlock settled, cross-legged, on his bed, laptop open, and papers neatly lined up on the mattress. He looked more like a student preparing for an all-nighter than a vampire.
The kettle had just boiled when the doorbell rang.
‘Because you don’t know everything about me.’
John took his hand firmly, and Sherlock let out a small cry at the warmth and the size of it. ‘Of course you’re my best friend,’ John said. ‘You always have been, and always will be. And… I’m going to miss you so fucking much, you know?’
John didn’t answer. He kept his eyes on the empty bird-feeders in the distance.
A nurse crossed the doorway, glancing in, rushing past.
Sherlock took to school like a duck to water. He came back after the first day somewhat amazed to have found out he was already top of the class, and ahead of his classmates in several subjects. The perks, John silently supposed, of being from an old family with money to throw at your education. Sherlock happily went off to school again after that, taking his completed homework in ahead of the deadline, and looking very smart in his polished shoes and ironed shirt.
“Sherlock,” John gasped, as Sherlock ran his hands down over John’s legs. “Sherlock, I – I need to – need to tell you – need to tell you something…”
John hated his secondary gender. He hated the expectations, the mess of heats, the way people thought you should be at home, cooking. He was as much a man as any beta or alpha.
“Really? I see…” the teacher nodded. “You’ll have to see if Bradley’s parents want this pursuing, Sherlock. Go to your next lesson.”
Mycroft stared. “You disappoint me, John.” He picked his umbrella up. “Your child is, of course, legally a Holmes –”
“Mummy,” he said one evening, “can you read this for me?” He had been trying to make sense of the words on the page for over an hour. The markings kept swimming around in his mind, refusing to stay still and make sense as they once did.
Sherlock pursed his lip before speaking again. “Are you still licensed to practice?”
Sherlock was in the shower, John waiting in his bedroom for him to come back.
John didn’t know what to think. He wished he could speak more easily, as if that might make processing the story less of a burden.
“Yes,” the man walked over, “it’s against the law where I come from, too.”
John thundered down the stairs, and threw himself at her, as soon as she stepped through the door.
John didn’t dare say ‘yes’ when he was stuck next to the eldest Holmes on the sofa. He just stared, helplessly.
He clenched his fists as he walked. He’d been found out.
“Says you,” John winced, as his car crashed into another barrier. “Bloody hell.”
Sherlock nodded. “I saw you. That day. When Mycroft and Siger carried me to the car. It was… as thought I was watching myself from the outside. I could see myself – this sweating, feral, snapping beast, and you, this tiny omega boy, frightened by the sight of me. And although you didn’t smell right, I knew that if you had, I would have fought my father and brother off to get to you. I would have… hurt you.”
“Betas?”
“That’s ok, I just figured you were busy. Or didn’t care,” John teased, too poorly to take things too seriously. “It’s... Good. To see you.”
The rest of the car-ride was in silence.
“Indeed. Your request for him to be told about your condition came through to me, as Sherlock is currently... indisposed.”
“Luck of the draw,” Greg smiled. “I was in a patrol car off the high-street. Someone came running to say they’d seen three alphas approach an omega on his own. I didn’t know it was you until…”
“Ha! Seriously, though… He’s not being that much of a dick?”
“Alright, Mr Bossy,” John turned his bedside light off. “Goodnight.”
John watched Sherlock staring at the paper before putting his hands to his temples in apparent discomfort. Sherlock massaged them for a moment, then looked at the page again. His eyes seemed almost desperately hungry.
Sherlock was quiet. Then he sucked in a deep breath through his nose, as if thinking carefully about what to say. “I don’t know,” he said eventually.
“Sherlock,” John said again. “Sherlock…. Where is my baby?”
“I thought he was ok with waiting…” Sherlock’s eyes spilled over, and John dropped everything, catching the student in his arms as he covered his face and wept.
"Not unless you want me to smell you."
“Yes,” Sherlock caught his breath back, and raised his eyes.
When they got back to the bunk, Sherlock packed his belongings and John watched quietly. He looked like he wanted to say something.
He gave Sherlock’s hand a squeeze. “If you want… you can put that cushion down,” he said, gently. “You know I’m not going to think any differently of you. I saw you in hospital. And before.”
he washed his hands, and face, spraying on deodorant and tidying himself up in the mirror. He sent John a text, choosing not to mention puking:
John moved his hand from Sherlock’s lips, round to his hair, cupping the back of his head gently as their mouths came together.
“Without your permission.”
‘John, come on, wake up for us,’ someone was saying in a sprightly voice. ‘Then it, keep your eyes open.’
If it killed him.
One John could never have.
“Yes, I am,” John said. “I honestly am.”
‘No,’ Sherlock said. ‘I don’t think that. That’s why I need to see him today.’ His heart was beating very, very fast.
“I’ll text,” John stifled a yawn. “I can’t see there being a problem, though. I’ll be back tomorrow afternoon, or early evening.”
John frowned. “I don’t understand, I’m sorry?”
‘Have you done the wooden spoon thing yet?’
“No,” John said, not wanting Victor even marginally undressed in his flat. “You can keep them on, it’s fine.” He led the way up the stairs. “Sherlock, Victor’s here to give you…” he stared at the empty lounge. “Ok, he
“I’ll get a first.”
Sherlock opened his eyes. “Why?”
“You’re worried,” Sherlock said, looking up from his phone as John came into the room. “And your arm hurts,” he added.
John blushed, slightly. A pink tinge over those cheeks of fading tan that would never fully fade. Not now, because, angel or not, this man was something of the supernatural – he was not real, and apparently never could be, not for Sherlock.
John stopped. “What – like on holiday?”
“I don’t want to tell you what he might not want you to know,” John sighed. “Even if you have pretty much guessed it.”
John blinked. “I don’t know. Maybe. I… I thought he might mean that I didn’t refuse. He’s angry about that. I should have fought him off, isn't that what he meant? Or not?”
Sherlock swore under his breath, pinching the bridge of his nose for a moment. Mycroft cracked one of his knuckles, loudly.
“Because you’re not ready,” Victor sighed. “I don’t think you’re even close.”
It took almost fifteen minutes for their pinky fingers to touch.
“New beginnings aren’t always happy,” Sherlock put a hand to John’s stomach, and the baby rolled over, though unfelt by its father. “Sometimes they’re painful. Or sad, or awkward. Sometimes we cry. Sometimes new beginnings come about because you lose something. Sometimes you gain. Someone is born, or someone dies. Change is never easy, and not always welcome.”
“Fat lot of good you were…” Sherlock looked up at the house. “He might kill her.”
“Sorry.”
!!! NEWS !!!
“Why…” Sherlock turned his head slowly. “Why would I be interested in your life?”
Sherlock glanced at the door. “How – how are you… doing?”
The alpha needed no encouragement. He withdrew his fingers from John’s sopping entrance, and manhandled him backwards onto the mattress. John hooked his legs up, over the back of Sherlock’s, watching as the alpha grasped the base of his cock, the knot already swelling, and lined up with John’s hole, pushing against it, but not in.
“No. Yeah. I told them he was scenting me. But… he was so heavy, and I was so small, and I could feel… everything.” John wiped his eyes, angrily. “Sometimes, I still can.”
Sherlock held a hand up. "Just come with me. I don't need self-flagelation." He bent over the bed, and kissed John's clammy forehead. "I won't be a moment, my love."
John stills at the sensation.
Mycroft pinched between his eyes.
“I’ll simply refuse to work with them unless you have a job, there.”
That was something, at least.
Mycroft blinked, seeming to shake himself. He put the remains of the pastry on his plate. “…yes.”
‘I could ask the same of you.’
He dropped his phone onto the table.
‘A blazer,’ John said, suddenly feeling awkward. ‘Why?’
“Are you alright?” Sherlock kissed the hinge of his jaw.
He’d walk home, or run. It wasn’t that far –
“No.”
John looked up at him. Sherlock expected him to deny it. But he didn’t. He nodded. “I am. I don’t want to be. But…” he glanced at the spot on the floor where the incident had occurred. “I can’t stop thinking about it.”
Blood
There was an unpleasant silence.
Sherlock stared.
Sherlock’s jaw went tense, but he nodded. “Come on, then.”
Two hours later, Lydia Thornton was dead, and Sherlock was sitting on the pavement outside her house, staring into the gutter.
The vampire did not tire. He could have reamed John for hours, had the man beneath him not drawn out of him the pleasure and desire he thought had been beyond his grasp, until now. John was like a vampire himself – feeding off emotional energy, attachment, call it what you would. Sherlock wanted to give him it all. He rocked his hips hard, plunging into John’s tight wet heat, moaning as John whimpered, clearly fighting off his own release.
John could feel his chest going tight, and a noise trying to claw its way up his chest.
Perhaps this wasn’t really the beginning of the end. Maybe things were just getting started, after all.
John nodded. “Why
John let out a moan of want. Shivers shot down his body, tingling over his skin as he gasped as the sudden tightness of his trousers, his cock hardening and thickening because there was an omega – Sherlock – here. An omega in heat. An unclaimed omega in heat, who needed his knot.
“No,” Sherlock said to the ceiling. “We’re not.”
“I’m just breaking you in gently, John.” Sherlock winked.
“Please,” John looked up, face bright red and wet. “I – I know I hurt your dad, but I can be good, and – and you look after me, even when I’m horrible to you –”
‘Obviously not,’ Sherlock said, blowing smoke away from John. ‘But it’s calming.’
"People do little else, don't they?" He said softly, bending to John's will and taking his lips. An intense rush of affection and need for John rushed through him, and he cupped the man's face with his hands as they kissed fiercely, parting only when the door opened, and another nurse froze at the sight.
“Congratulations,” John grinned. “You’re a dad.”
Sherlock and Lestrade both looked at him, mirrors of one another.
“No, it’s ok,” Sherlock checked it. “Just pulling on my leg-hair. It stings.”
‘I know.’ Sherlock kissed him on the head. ‘I love you.’
John screamed. A proper scream, and that’s how he knew it wasn’t a dream. Sherlock grabbed John around the chest, pulling him onto his lap as Greg and Mycroft leapt to their feet to stand in front of Eurus.
‘He’s going to join the army.’
Sherlock almost collapsed as he let himself go, stopping just short of knotting his mate as he came inside him, biting down on the bond-bite that had been re-opened several times by now. John cried out as the skin broke, the nudge of pain making him come again, his entrance clamping hard on Sherlock’s cock, making him gasp, over-sensitive, the last drops of come entering John as Sherlock tried to fall in slow motion, behind him.
“No,” John pointed a finger. “Fucking no. You don’t get to explain that. You have any idea how much shit I’ve put up with from alphas my entire life? I am not someone’s fucking property – you can’t fucking steal me and expect me to just stand there and like it. I’m my own person, and you do not get to touch me. Not now, and not
‘No,’ Sherlock sneered, then took a big sip of the drink just to be annoying.
A pause. “You had an arrangement, didn’t you?”
Sherlock was past caring. He grabbed his laptop and bag, and left the science room, and his former teacher, forever.
The line was faint. It was barely there – a pearly pink that hardly showed at all.
“No,” Sherlock shook his head. “Not until Mycroft took you. There’d always been something… not right. With Siger, and omegas. Eurus, yes, but… Even with Sherrinford. Sherry bonded with Archie because Archie didn’t hit him, he told me. I thought it was a joke, he always had a strange sense of humour.”
“Anything you like the look of, you may borrow. These aren’t volumes for display. Knowledge should be shared. Please, take a look at the shelves before you leave.” He put his head on one side, as if thinking.
John couldn’t agree. He felt completely miserable. His whole head ached and he hadn’t even opened any Christmas presents. He sucked the lolly off the stick and then lay down to go back to sleep. But his dad was right. Two days later he was up and about as usual, and his new teeth had grown in enough for him not to look a total fool. They would continue to descend for another few weeks, but the hardest part was over. John was almost a man. There would be that barely-detectable hormonal shift, and then… he’d be a mature alpha.
“Is this it?” John let himself out of the car. “It’s massive.”
“She’s not premature, Sherlock, she’ll be more than fine.”
Hell, if he hadn’t played with John every single summer as a child, none of this would have happened.
“Yeah, it was ok. Glad all the relatives have gone, now. I’ve hardly seen you.”
“Why?” John echoed. He sighed. “You’ve barely spoken to me, since... What’s going on?”
“Er...”
“Neither did I.”
Sherlock blinked, then looked at the man, his eyes gleaming with danger. "For me or for you?"
Then, John knelt up, and pushed Sherlock’s cock under himself, so the throbbing head was pressing against the sopping entrance to his arse.
John suppresses a laugh.  “Well, that’s honest.”
John doesn’t seem inclined to disagree.
“Yes.”  At this point, Sherlock would agree to almost anything.  He might even vaguely intend to follow through, though that will no doubt waver if John would just
John falls asleep that night with Sherlock’s warm hand pressed to the dull ache in John’s shoulder and wakes to Annabeth jumping onto the foot of the bed and squealing, “I knew it!  You two were so silly, pretending not to love each other.”
The subtext, John thinks: You fail, but I like that you try. He imagines Sherlock sitting at the bottom of the stairs all evening, waiting. He probably brought a book.
And John never shows.
John wants to scream.  He hasn’t spoken in hours.  Not since Sherlock left with John’s gun and a promise to bring their daughter home.
“Oh.”  Harry smiles cautiously.  “Maybe he loves you, too,” she ventures.
John continues quietly, “Things won’t be the same.  I won’t be able to just drop everything and run off with you on a whim.”
John waits a moment to take this in.  “But you do want a relationship?”
“Who is Mycroft?” she asks.
“It’s okay, Sherlock,” John says quietly, calmly, into Sherlock’s shoulder. “I’m not leaving, you can let go.”
“Pity about the girl, though,” Anderson murmurs.
What John hasn’t exactly, in so many words, owned up to feeling.
“Unless those questions are being asked for purely rhetorical purposes,” Harry adds, smiling at Sherlock, “to make sure everyone knows exactly how brilliant you are.”
John writes, cutting to the chase. He doubts Sherlock would acknowledge or appreciate an apology even if John could bring himself to offer one.
that’s not the kind of person I am.  I’m here and I’m asking.”
“I believe it’s time we began your mathematical education,” Sherlock proposes.  “It is morally neutral to satisfy your father while still providing essential mental enrichment.”
Sherlock writes.
Sherlock plays the violin for two days and doesn’t eat, doesn’t open the door to Mrs. Hudson, is finally only roused from his misery by Lestrade. He pounds on the door and, once Sherlock mutely lets him inside, complains that Sherlock hasn’t answered a single text or voicemail. He explains a new case, a murder in a locked room, Illuminati symbols and false identification and something about a member of Parliament.
“Why should it be?” Sherlock asks, sitting up now. “Although you’ve likely changed to some degree in the intervening years, you already know me, and your being here and your actions of the past hour tell me all I need to know tonight. I’ll learn the rest when you unpack your belongings here in the coming days, of course.”
“See, a true sociopath wouldn’t care about respecting boundaries,” John jokes, but it’s a weak joke and he sighs again.  “Sherlock, can you tell me what you want?”
She furrows her little brow.  “I don’t want you two to become arch nemesises.”
a present.”  Annabeth fingers the ribbon around the bear’s neck.
