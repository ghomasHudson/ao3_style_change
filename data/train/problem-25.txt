When John gave him a look, he rolled his eyes dramatically, giving off that infamous irritation he was known for. “You’re the Chief of Medical with four different nurses. Meaning, all of those fancy scanners and heavy machines won’t be your job, it’ll be theirs. You’ll just be there for expert opinion and more serious treatments, if need be.” He looked back down to his phone’s screen, a clear sign of boredom. “If the situation ever arose, I have no doubt in my mind you could amputate, suture, and wrap a leg before the next person could sever it. Trust me, you’ll do perfectly fine.”
to be here. With you.”
He still wasn't sure if he was dreaming or not.
He tilts his head to meet Sherlock’s eye, at least peripherally, and finds their faces much, much too close. It’s commonly known, both among doctors and the regular folk, that whenever it comes to the eyes, the peripheral vision is much more acute and useful during the night. To notice the stars in the night sky, you should look where there aren't any, and find the specks that appear all around your line of sight. Here, in the late afternoon sun streaming through the flat, John finds that it’s true now, too. That he doesn’t have to focus to see the laugh lines, the cupid’s bow, the little brown fleck in one eye, all in perfect detail.
The drinks were brought. John found himself drinking more of the coke than he’d think, downing the soda in under a minute, and at the end of it long fingers nudged another one closer.
feel comfortable with was ignoring him. Cheeks blazing, he excused himself to the bathroom. He might just leave; it was ten minutes until seven, when he shift ended. He had already cleaned up, anyway. Determined and feeling like a dick, he slid out of the room and into the empty hallway, taking in a gulp of air. Anxiety was clawing at his chest, and he had no idea why.
The guitar Sherlock’s bought is beautiful, really, even to someone who’s never had much of an interest. It’s currently propped up against the left window, mirroring the violin’s corner to the right, and the mid-morning light catches the dust in the air that drifts against its glossy veneer. The wood is a reddish color just between light and dark, and is riddled with knots as though it were carved directly from a tree trunk. John brushes his hand over the first fret’s line, not hard enough to make a sound but enough to feel the strings give.
John gave him a crooked smile, the first
“Alive,” John said. “And well. She calls me all the time, I’m surprised you haven’t heard her. She’s quite the talker.”
“Hello, welcome to…” The words died off as the woman rounded the corner, once she caught sight of who entered. Her pink lips stretched into a grin and the papers in her hands fluttered to the ground. “John!”
The ball’s in his court now. Hopefully he rallies it back soon.
He held up a hand, eyes closing. “Not now. I’m… I don’t know, alright? You’ve… opened a lot of doors for me, you see. Doors that have been closed for a very, very long time. I’ve never...” He sighed and shrugged his shoulders, almost seeming disappointed in himself. “I’ve never.”
John felt caught up in the beginnings of a violent storm. Sherlock dropped a hand to his good shoulder, gently kneading in a goodbye, before departing. When the door closed, Mary’s frame totally relaxed, and it was as if Sherlock was never there.
John nods, eyes drawn to the fabric of his jeans. “To confirm,” John says slowly, while his brain flashes warning signs at him (to no avail), “This was with a…”
“So, then, how are you two?” Lestrade asked suddenly, drunkenness making him unobservant. Well, more so than usual.
John jumped back in utter surprise, while RJ simply laughed. It wasn’t gone, though; it popped into existence a few seconds later, only moved halfway across the mat. Teleportation? John was looking around to the people passing, disbelieving that he was the only one who saw the trick. He turned back to the giggling child. “How?” He asked incredulously.
Despite the fact that his death had saved countless lives and he would never regret making that choice, Sherlock desperately wanted to fall to the ground and beg for forgiveness.
If you liked my writing or just Johnlock in general, please, follow me over
Rosie’s successful with one shoe, so John takes the hint and slides them both off. He stretches, feeling his spine pleasantly crack and tight muscles loosen, and he runs a hand through his hair to try and push it back into place, to no avail. He’s debating on getting it cut back into his usual style. He starts towards his laptop, intent on checking his email, but Sherlock clears his throat before he can.
He adjusted his course of leave to pass by Sherlock, and when their eyes met he sent a glare with much more fervor than his previous one.
Something flashed in John’s eyes, and he tugged Sherlock forward by his wrist until they were flush. “Do you remember how to dance in one?” John asked, the bridge of his nose knocking at Sherlock’s chin. Sherlock could only shake his head, not sure if he could trust his words.
As Molly scurried away, Sherlock tossed John goggles, an apron, and elbow-length rubber gloves, rolling over a metal cart topped with the most intimidating medical instruments possible. He wordlessly handed John a bone saw. John swallowed, looked at the body, and then looked back up to Sherlock.
“Give ‘im some room, lads.”
The man’s head turned, as if summoned. His eyes narrowed on Mike, until they slid to John. There was little change in his expression, save for something less annoyed and more thoughtful crossing his features, before he turned back to the matter at hand. John forced his eyes off of him, back to Mike, who seemed curiously unaffected.
Mike laughed aloud, something warm and familiar. “Old? Washed-up? You’re the best damn surgeon currently inside the building, I guarantee. And you’re just, what, thirty-three? Thirty-four? If you’re old, I’m old then.”
John sighs. “That just means I’ll have to try harder, then, won’t I?”
Sherlock flipped them around and pressed John into the sand with his lips, the rain pelting at his back and sound of his brother’s footsteps shuffling closer. It didn’t matter. None of it mattered. Because in the darkness, there was a glint of silver and an
Dimmock nodded, once. “Go get him.”
“I used to think you were a ghost,” John said tightly. “When we first met. Every adjective I connotated with you was something along the lines of inhuman. The fact that the only way to describe you, was to describe the opposite of what you should be. The opposite of a human.” He held those silver eyes in his, trying to enunciate his words through his stare. “You are a legend in Stansex, you know. Seventy years ago, you are said to have arrived and slaughtered an innocent life. You are not allowed back on the territory, Mary told me. If you step foot in Stansex, something terrible will happen.” He swallowed, voice wavering. “It makes a man think.”
The silence was comfortable, free of pitying glances towards his cane. John had nearly forgotten that Mike was there until he spoke back up.
Did Thomas think
John flapped his hand, ripping off the receipt with the call number that was printed. “The representative from Sector 11, the girl who has a crush on you. The one helping you with data or whatever.” John snapped his fingers in realization, and then immediately regretted the sharp movement. “Molly! Molly’s her name, sorry.”
Every Monday he’d ask his schedule for the week, which labs he’d be assigned to and who he’d be assisting. Every Monday she’d glance at that blasted post-it note on her desk, and every Monday she’d purse her lips and read off names that definitely didn’t sound like the one they were both awaiting to hear.
work anymore, considering he doesn’t let Sarah even pay him, but when he starts feeling useless and one of the resident doctors is out, the clinic is more than happy for the help. Today is one of those days, somewhere at the end of November, and Sherlock’s already shooing him away with Rosie scrambling in his arms.
disappointed. Not in the slightest.
Before this new reality, Earth was roughly 71% covered in water. Closing halfway through the third millennium, the number had dropped to 35%. The decline was only becoming more rapid with time. Where John lived was in the northern parts of the Sector where there used to be a ‘coast’, as relics were still being found from a more water-centric time, buried beneath the dried-up seabeds. Now, there wasn’t even a glisten of the liquid as far as John could see, only the gradual decline of the land into sand-crusted canyons.
him. That much had always been obvious, Sherlock knew, but... that was the only thing to do, wasn’t it? To say? Sherlock loved John and had to speak it out loud (this dreadful, secretive thing) and was currently blind to the world in the most literal sense of the phrase.
Sherlock nodded, blinking around the sitting room as if there was a murderer hiding in its depths. “Good.” He shifted in place. “Do me a favor. Can you… tell me what I am?”
“You’re… familiar with her,” he grappled, unsure of his words. “You weren’t thinking about your leg. We both know it’s psychosomatic, but talking to her took the thought completely out of it.”
“No, we’ve been dealing with that since October, give us a break! There’s a new pop song-”
Sherlock was expecting many things. He was expecting John to apologize, he was expecting John to skirt around the issue. Another part of him was even expecting John to ask if they could keep up the arrangement (as he had definitely shown Sherlock that he was
ME: Another question?
“Save it,” John growled, storming down the hallway. Sherlock kept up with him easily, walking as if gliding on air. John couldn’t take it. “Stop that!”
years ago,” Sherlock says carefully. “I don’t want to expose Rosie to firearms. A pistol shot off indoors is over double the decibel maximum recommended for her age.”
It was the oddest, most wonderful thing. He wasn’t attracted to him like he was a woman; there were no possessive kisses, or an all-encompassing lust that he could hardly bear. No, he wanted to know James as he’d never known another person, and he would take as much as he could in return, even if it meant fantasizing about hot nights under a tent barely big enough for two, spending hours and hours filling each other up to the brim.

it was the most important. Desperately, Sherlock wound his fingers with John’s in their grasp, trying to convey with his body what words were failing to do.
Stag night, they were completely inebriated, and-
“It’s for your own good,” Lestrade had sighed, leading them through the ship while they wore fully-insulated suits to keep them from contaminating the air. He didn’t seem angry this time, only more resigned. Like he had expected this. “The air outside of the dome and inside the Intrepid were never supposed to make contact. A simple cleansing won’t be enough, we’ll have to put you in quarantine a couple of hours during launch so you can get a full disinfection.”
“Well, we’re all going to space, aren’t we? Even the captain does everything he dishes out. Being at the top doesn’t exclude our bones from, well, separating.”
For the past several weeks as training was reaching its end, John and Sherlock spent much of their free time together, when not working in their respective fields. They had not grown closer since the first few days of their acquaintance, John had noticed, because they were already fast friends to begin with. It was as natural as breathing, and as Sherlock had once pointed out, John annoyed him the least out of everyone he knew. John had quickly learned how to decipher Sherlockian compliments.
Sarah was just ending a call. Before John could pass by her and head out, she held an arm out to bump his chest, mobile in hand. Her eyes were narrowed thoughtfully in his direction. “What was that?”
John bumped his arm. “He would’ve liked you, you know. My dad. Instead of reading children’s books like mum did, he’d read us murder mysteries before bed.”
“No,” John immediately assures, not even having to check. He could draw his likeness onto a canvas by memory at this point. “You’re still thin as a rail. Your brother’s just trying to get under your skin, successfully I might add.”
“Mmm,” Sherlock replied, head shaking. He was close, anyway. It’s been years since he’d even felt arousal; his hand vs. someone else’s hand didn’t really make a difference at this point. With a shudder and a heavy exhale, he came over John’s comforter and floor. When he glanced up, John was watching him with wide eyes.
“Yes sir,” Dimmock immediately complied. “Do you… that is, do you have his name?”
ME: …
. He kept the expletives frequent and to himself.
John glanced over his shoulder at the other man disbelievingly. “You said he doesn’t talk very much.”

Sherlock’s face twisted into a half-hearted grimace, and god help him, even with wrinkled chins and a scrunched-up nose John still thought he was tremendously beautiful. His baritone was careful. “You… you’ve been in the army.”
For a moment, John felt weightless.
“It’s wholesome,” Gillian added.
just before Moriarty succeeded in killing Sherlock. Fourth, the time that John most regretted, the day Sherlock returned.
Sherlock’s lips twisted. “On the contrary, John, blood is my entire reason of existence.” Despite the worrying statement, he shook John’s grip off to dab at the scrape. “Just because I’m a vampire doesn’t mean I’ve no self-control.”
, dark hair curled around an ethereal face.
“You agreed quicker than I previously assumed.” There was some sort of shuffle on the end of the line, and Mycroft’s voice was further from the speaker. “Fifteen seconds, now. Go outside, a car is turning onto Quincy Street.”
“Ah!” Sherlock announced. He nearly smushed his face against the glass separating them from the driver. “D’you know where the Buck & Bare Wild is?”
“And what I asked you?”

“Hold on, hold on,” Lestrade interrupted, voice oddly lilted and eyes alight with something worryingly delighted. “It’s been a successful week, and it’s our first free night in a while. Let’s say we go for a drink.”

feel the surge of duty that ran familiar through his blood. This is what he wanted, right? To help somebody again?
“No, don’t be,” John said. “He was nice enough. Bit strange. His questions were…”
“It’s… the fluorescence.” Sherlock explained, his voice sounding choked off. He hunched back over the table to scribble something on a piece of paper. “Changed the color.”
Sherlock didn’t reply, because there was nothing left to be said.
Sherlock says in confusion, brow furrowed and skin more green than pink.
“Yes.” No hesitation. At John’s expectant look, Sherlock continued on. “That’s an easy explanation: adrenaline. It can push your muscles in ways you never thought possible, disregarding comfort and aiming for maximum strength. I’m a bit sore, to be honest, but I had a rush while pushing you out of the way. Even at the high speeds the car was going, I was able to stop it. I'm lucky that I didn’t break my arm.” He met John’s gaze, his long eyes thoughtful. “I’m sure you can Google it, Doctor.”
before. So why, John thinks as a bead of sweat sprouts under his hairline, is this any different?
“Behind the fridge,” Sherlock corrects.
“Didn’t.” He turns his head to keep John in his periphery, eyelashes caught reddish-gold in the light, and says, “I didn’t mean to wake you.”
There was a car door shutting outside. Wind moaned ominously through the house, creaking the foundation. With another lasting squeeze, John made to pull away.
John doesn’t put up any pretenses. He quotes, almost conversationally, “‘It certainly did the trick’.”
“The representative for Sector 13, Technological Designing,” Sherlock commented, staring at the boy just as intently. “He’s been following us. Well, you, really. He seems too shy to talk to you directly, but he’s in need of your attention.”
be near the entrance, trying desperately to remember if chapels were usually built at the front. Maybe. It would make sense, anyway. He ignored the paranoid feeling of feet ghosting at his heels, knowing that the men were still a good bit behind him.
“Yeah,” John replied instead, voice falsely light. With a terse nod, he turned back to Mike. “Well, thank you for letting me know what an utter
Sherlock jerked his head in Molly’s direction. “She is the only one out of the lower crew with access outside of the dome. I need to get her to give me that access, but even she wouldn’t be that stupid.
He frowns. It wasn’t running when he went upstairs.
John did as instructed, facing the nose of the miniature ship away from his body. He ran a finger between the ship’s belly and the hoop, and when he found the notch, he pressed up.
“I know who she is,” John snapped. The other man only took a wordless drag while John mulled the words over. “She’s not my type,” he decided on.
They slept together. Purely platonic, an unspoken agreement stemming from a need of compassion and contact. On other sides of the bed, but with their feet brushing together under the covers. That was still a wonderful thing, Sherlock thought.
Sherlock flicked his cigarette butt out into nowhere and nodded John towards the car. “Shall we?”
to contact Sherlock the following day, even though it was the official move-in day into the Intrepid and he was itching for some company. He had heard the words himself:
“What?” John’s taken aback at that. Rejection? “Your brother
Sally guffawed, flapping her hand at her stomach as if she couldn’t breathe. “Angry? For a rejected shag? God, no. It’s not like I was in love with the man, it’s only that I can’t have sex with anyone I’m directly in command of when we’re in the ship. I just thought I might as well give it a shot down here, considering.”
It went… well.
the only ones keeping it alive.”
he says.
Sherlock’s jaw was tensed. “It’s really not ‘okay’, me admitting to killing.”
Sherlock, alike to John, was a man of science. He would never be content with being a creature of… well, supernatural means.
“Sherlock, let him go,” John ordered, hands wringing at Sherlock’s to release the wheezing attacker. Well, at this point, the attackee. While John could appreciate the good revenge story, he wasn’t about to sit and watch a man die in front of him. When it became obvious that no amount of prying could ease the hold, John bit his cheek and tried a different tactic.
ME: Beta, you can argue about the definition about consciousness for as long as you’d like, but the official definition requires the existence of a brain. Just because a plant transports water and nutrients through its body and reacts to sunlight doesn’t give it a consciousness nor a brain, but merely awareness.
“Ah,” John sighed, knotting his hands into his hair and arching against him. “You haven’t let me know yet.”
When he thought of John, it squeezed harder with a vengeance.
Hardly believing even his own thoughts, John went on downstairs and cleaned up vomit for the better part of three hours.
“… Of a sort.” They were nearing Baker Street now, though Sherlock was driving a bit slower to draw it out, taking his time. In the car, it was like being in their own world where topics such as these were somewhat valid, if just between the two of them. “I don’t think you’ve ever noticed, but on the truly sunny days, I don’t go out. I stay in the flat, or I’m very careful about where I travel. I don’t perish from direct sunlight, no, but… there
“Yes.”
“How did you sleep?”
John was
Sherlock’s face paled in horror, and then went utterly blank and vacant like the flip of a switch. John was similarly frozen, though what was once cold and sick along his spine was warming, turning into a sort of hope that he didn’t think he’d ever have. Didn’t think that he deserved.
“Mm,” John hummed, hand perfectly steady between them.
Sherlock turns his head and nods John towards the table, where there’s already tea brewing and applesauce ready on the highchair. John sets Rosie all up with a bib and a spoon, and lets her go wild.

the ship!” John wheezed between laughter.
John’s throat was dry, his plate forgotten. “And this… Hamish fellow. Is he. Well. How does Scott feel about him?”
When Sherlock helped John onto the gurney, John noticed that underneath Sherlock’s right nails was something blue, the same color as the car itself.
“Nobody drives a car anymore, not in this day and age. You know that.” As if out of nowhere, a sleek vehicle smoothed to a stop at the edge of his driveway, hovering a few centimeters above the magnetic track with a light buzz. The door opened to a plush interior. “You are going to take this car to your sector’s transportation facility, where you’ll board the rail directly to the ICAM. It’s a four hour journey - perhaps you’d like to bring a book?”
John shrugged, switching the safety back on his gun and shoving it into his waistband. “Maybe the garbage was recently taken from it,” he offered. Then he immediately winced at his words, regretful.
It was a new moon, meaning he had to rely on the dim lights in the graveyard as the sky darkened, the lamps throwing long, amber shadows against the ground. Calling Highgate a graveyard was almost insulting – it was a land of the dead, a ghost town, great mausoleums lined up like houses and zealous gravestones made up of intricate statues rather than slabs. As he walked deeper, he couldn’t shake the feeling of eyes on his neck, goosebumps dotting his arms like freckles. He stopped in place, telling himself that he wasn't scared – the walk back would be over an hour already, after all, so it was only best if he turn back around.
“So,” he started, sparing a glance beside him. Sherlock was just taking everything in, eyes darting from the windows to the fence peeking from behind the house to the trees backdropping it all. He started slightly at John’s voice. “Are you… William Scott, today?”
John tried to concentrate on his running, but the focus in his friend’s eyes was just too intriguing. “What is it?”
John started at the words. “That was over twenty years ago! I don’t know a thing about medicine anymore, I can barely even- hey!”
John sighs. “And Happy Holidays to you,
In the dark, her blushing cheeks seemed almost maroon. Blinking away the surprise, she gripped his hand back. “Well, alright.”
Sherlock narrows his eyes at his reflection. “Compromise.”
Sherlock was oddly quiet, his face shuttered off. His hands were firm on John’s knees. “And your conclusion?”
Sherlock fell into the cab more than he entered it, feet twisting as he maneuvered uncoordinated legs into the car. It took him a few tries to close the door. “Nonesome-sense, nonsense, John,” he barked, voice higher than usual and hilariously slurred. “This is what your ‘Stag Night’ is for, hmm?”
“Angelo’s,” John began, wetting his lips, “Do you remember our first… dinner there?”
“That maybe,” he continued, “Doctor Watson was not quite as thrilled to see you as you were to see him?”
“Hi, yes, I’d like an order of the steak, rare as you’ll cook it, and- John, would you like the Caesar salad or the fish and chips? I can’t tell how light of a mood you’re in.”
His hand carefully wrapped around John’s cock, already half-hard, and John groaned from his chest. He pulled Sherlock back to nip at his lips, licking into his mouth and reaching around to splay his hands into Sherlock’s back. There was a discrepancy beneath his fingertips. Sherlock’s hand stilled.
“Hmm? Oh, that.” He flapped his hand, waving the question away. “Just passing the time. Never know when a body with no arms or legs will pop up at a crime scene, and I’ll have to identify the weapon.”
The title of the song reminds John sharply of Mary, but he ignores it. He clears his throat until Sherlock looks his way. “Good morning.”
Sherlock didn’t move, save for his eyelids fluttering closed and lips trembling around his voice. For the first time John had ever remembered seeing, Sherlock looked
“And I swear, if you drug me
“Yes,” he says. “I’m ready.”
“Yeah, sure,” he says absently, dropping down to pick up the crumbly mess. He’ll have to hoover tomorrow, and makes a mental note to figure out where
John felt his brows pull together, wary as Sherlock made his way across the sitting room. “What do you mean?”
The Japanese legend of the Gaki.
“Got any scary stories?” He asked playfully, keeping his tone light. There was only one story he was interested in, but to give Mary credit, she seemed to realize that.
Sherlock’s lips curled up, despite himself. “A while,” he admitted.
John reached behind the gravestone, and then straightened back up. He felt Sherlock at his back, emitting more cold than heat, and he glanced over John’s shoulder to see what he held.
John,
Something in Sherlock’s face smoothed out, and his smile seemed easier. “Then we
to the impossible man. Glimpsing his angelic face in the flat never failed to send a shock down John's spine, and when he was alone, he found himself frequenting Sherlock’s favorite spots in search of his alluring smell. His armchair, the windowsill, at the dining table. John, like the teenage girl he was, was trying to drown himself in the scent that was both natural and inhuman. Unlike any cologne on the market, yet so different from the natural emittance the human body could supply. He was obsessed, and it was bordering on a gross habit, but he just couldn’t stop.
John urged impatiently, “It’s, what, a 20, 30 meter drop?”
“John Watson!” Lestrade greeted, grabbing John’s hand from his side to firmly shake it. The enthusiasm jarred him to the core. “Mycroft told me you’d be coming in. You must be a damn good doctor, considering all the fuss it took to get you.”
, a minor league rugby coach? Well, that certainly heightened his curiosity. “Erm, right. Yeah.” He dropped into the armchair offered to him, the identical one across from him empty. “If you can disclose, can I ask what this is about?”
“She’s not a people person,” John said carefully. At the look on Sherlock’s face, he quickly continued. “No, no, not like you – you may not like people, but you’re at least semi-neutral about it. Most of the time. Harry… she lives off of anger. Makes people disappointed in her in the beginning, so expectations can’t go anywhere but up. I’ve learned to live with it and, well, twin connection I guess. It’s just… I don’t need to give her anymore fuel for the fire.”
As it turns out, two weeks later, that’s exactly what happens, over dinner with Sherlock’s voice stuttering and cheeks aflame. John’s hiding such a tremendous grin, he nearly forgets to say, emphatically,
“In all fairness, you hadn’t shot a man to save my life yet.” He was avoiding John’s eyes.
A half hour later found some of the crew vomiting up their breakfast, pressed to the ground in exhaustion and even a few others in-and-out of consciousness. The air was falsely humid, courtesy of Lestrade’s adjustments, and the time that blinked at the top arch of the dome was only 08:54. John wasn’t too far off from collapsing as well, breath heavy and clothing positively drenched in sweat, but he was able to keep himself together despite his couple hours sleep the night before. Caffeine was a miracle, he decided.
Before John can comment on
“Hm.” He collects together all of the gifts, and then reaches beneath the table to heft up his own half-filled cloth bag to gather them into. Oh, John thinks with vague surprise; he hadn’t even noticed Sherlock had bought a few things himself. John’s nothing if not unobservant, as per usual.
John realized that with a jolt. He wasn’t even sure why he noticed it in the first place. With a frown, John effectively pushed the thought out of mind and boosted up his pace.
“Who are you?” He nearly growled, body language the precise mixture between aggressive and vulnerable. John was beyond confused, but also wary of this newfound hostility. He braced himself taller than his frame, an almost military stance that shrugged on as comfortable as his own skin.
Sherlock’s lips quirked, but he said nothing more on the subject. “What brings you back to London, then? I can get enough of a read on you to tell that you're familiar enough in the city.”
Sherlock’s plate was only half-empty, but he threw in his napkin. “No, I’m finished as well. I might not be back Monday; I’m going out of town over the weekend.”
His lower lip wavers, but it’s schooled immediately. “A dangerous chemical,” he finally says.
Oh, fuck it. “I’m in love with Sherlock, yes. I have been ever since the beginning.”
“I’ll let Mrs. Hudson know to prepare herself.”
Molly’s words earlier wrung distractingly in John’s head, but he didn’t let them linger. He pulled back to look at Sherlock in the eye, hands trailing up to brace at his shoulders. “Yeah?”
John tried to shrug, but it was more like a barely-there nudge of his shoulder. “Yeah, can’t seem to shake ‘em.” The Sherlock dreams had faded whenever tensions eased between them, and instead had been replaced by the death-filled snippets of Afghanistan. It was better to stay awake than experience
“What sort of ‘hypothesis’ could possibly warrant you leaving only hours before launch?”
“Apparently, it was Sherlock’s idea of Christmas.” He blinked down at her arm. “Can I help you?”
“John,” Sherlock whispered, barely breathing. He couldn’t think of what to say, so instead: “Shouldn’t I be doing that?”
ME: Was it Mycroft?
“Well, that’s not why I like you,” John replied. After a beat, Sherlock nudged him back in acknowledgement.
was across London.
The feel of wind, a metal vice on his shoulder, and suddenly John was slammed into the curb head-first. A crowd of people surrounded him, more by the second, and he heard a familiar baritone yell: “Stand back! BACK! I swear, if one of – yes, yes, call the emergency line! All fourteen of you, maybe if you annoy them enough they’ll send the ambulance faster.” The voice again, gentler: “John, can you hear me? You’re- You’re bleeding. Quite a lot. Can… I’m not a doctor, John. Answer me!”
The first night back at 221B, John wanders downstairs at midnight.
His neuron-chip whirred to life at the back of his skull.
After that… nothing. To John, the thought was somewhat unnerving. He messaged Sherlock while he brushed his teeth.
“That was a deduction, John, a skill I have that I’m sure you’ve heard about. Apparently it’s my
A hand swiped at John’s temple and came back bloody. The hunter inspected it with unmasked delight. “This is just a game, you see. He’s the reward, while unfortunately you’re the price. No hard feelings.”
Lestrade turned his glare onto him. “I wouldn’t say anything if I were you,” he warned, voice on the brink of becoming a growl. “I know you’re not as innocent in all of this as you seem.”
“… and I was wondering if you’d like to go to it with me?”
In a normal world, a detective-inspector wouldn’t be apologetic about the lack of murder going on in Greater London. As it is, Sherlock’s vibrating with excitement and only urges him to continue.
John tilted forward, bracing his elbows on the table and perching his chin in his folded hands. “I was hitting on you, Sherlock. Quite successfully, I had thought, until you rambled about how
gets to hold his own daughter.
Sherlock was watching it with rapt attention, though he had his elbow crooked around his nose and mouth to keep himself from the smell. He had climbed up onto the ring and backed up to the curve as far as he could go. At seemingly the precise moment he figured, he pushed into a sprint down the bottom perimeter of the ring.
“Apparently, you are.”
John doesn’t move. The lightbulb above him flickers, but it’s actually his eyelids, rapid and fluttering on the tailend of his adrenaline rush. There’s one thought that formulates itself, flashing itself in his mind with warning sirens and blinking lights:
“I’ll leave you to it, then,” Mycroft said softly, and the line went dead in a fit of kindness. Sherlock lowered the phone to the desk, and shrugged on his dressing gown over his pyjamas.
Such mornings are John’s favorite.
Said daughter is watching them with wide, unbothered eyes, as if they were both on a television screen. John ignores the insult and licks his lips, attempting to make his case.
Both men groaned simultaneously when John gripped them both in his hands. Sherlock sighed breathily and gripped John’s shoulders, and John had his lips and tongue and
closest friend, and he’s not sure he’ll ever let that go. He hesitates, then sets his glass on the floor so he can lean forward on his knees.
“She left voluntarily, I’m afraid. Apparently an old employer had something of significance that prompted her to stop playing housewife.”
, I think it might be a bit late for-”
“Sure,” Sally assented, kicking off into a full run with a farewell salute. When she passed him, he felt the wind of her departure brush his face.
“Impossible,” Sherlock muttered, leaning further into the dumpster to observe. It smelled moldy, but not rotten. There was a layer of cardboard at the bottom. “This bin has been recently used, I’m sure of it.”
Sector 2 took up a series of land, once called the United Kingdom, Ireland, and Western Europe. There used to be some separation by water, but in these days with such a harsh sun, the land was fully connected by rails over deep, dry chasms. Water could only be found in the more isolated parts of the planet, away from civilization.
John chuckles, but it only serves to hide the tempest within his chest. “I’ll be there.”
Sherlock tightened his lips and burrowed his face against the curve of John’s neck, mouthing at the skin there softly. “You’ve no idea what you mean to me, do you?”
The ‘dismissed’ was implied. Somehow, Lestrade’s captaining mode wasn’t harsh in the slightest. John fell into the order in almost a sense of familiarity, turning on his heel towards a platform near the back of the great room. He had almost saluted, an outdated gesture which would’ve been an odd thing to perform. He couldn’t help but feel a bit of curiosity at the captain’s sudden shift in mood, and the reason towards that change: John’s sparring partner.
“The brother?” He asked politely, sounding much more calm than he felt. The miniscule pause told him everything he needed to know. Next to Sherlock, John was an idiot, but by himself he was really quite smart; he wasn’t sure why people seemed to think otherwise.
What was he playing at? “A… vampire?” And then John saw him flinch, slightly, and he registered the gaping space between them and Sherlock’s hesitancy all at once. “Wait a minute… are you walking on eggshells?”
“It’s a small town, John. We don’t have much to talk about.”
“No.”
The thing about Stansex was that it lived up to its name. In older English, ‘stan’ meant stone and ‘-sex’ meant territory. Territory of the stone. While stone was a recurring material used all over Dartmoor and its towns, in Stansex it practically sprouted up and grew with the foliage. Every house was made of stone, every bench and table, all the way from the ground up. It was a beautiful theme, green moss draping over weathered stone, and John was struck by the sheer loveliness of it all that he had forgotten.
John hummed, tapping his printed ticket lightly on the counter. “Will this ‘interesting’ lead to another prohibited outing?”
John watched him wander away at that, and John caught Thirteen watching, too. John wasn’t too sure what good goading an antisocial child would do, but his curiosity was officially piqued. Feeling awkward, he carefully made his way to the mat until he was only about a meter from the boy.
he was, in the beginning. Four months in, the brilliance and rush of the chase dimmed until it was lackluster. A year in, he was dreading every next location, every new identity. The men and women that he’d killed weighed on him, scarred him alongside the deep cuts and lashes that decorated his back. But there was a motivator, at least.
“Ma!” Rosie gurgles. They both pretend that she’s trying to say ‘Molly’. John clears his throat, sliding his palms up and down his jean-clad thighs.
He slipped away all at once, trying not to linger before winding around people on his way to the bathroom. His seduction techniques were rather rusty, after all, if they could be called that. When he reached the bathroom, he paused to listen over the slight chatter.
“Stings?” Sherlock murmured.
John curses silently. “Oh. That.” He can feel his ears going red, and he prays that Sherlock can’t see from the distance. “Um. No. Not yet. I’ll… keep you posted.” He winces to himself.
“Alright, thanks,” he murmured, feeling strangely lost. He just wanted to tell the arse off, damn it! Yeah, that’s why he couldn’t help but keep an eye out for every dark head of curls that passed, or shake the disappointment he felt when each sighting proved itself fruitless. He just needed to yell at the bloke, is all.
There’s no reply. Carefully, John settles into Sherlock’s chair, turning it so it half-faces the window and puts them parallel to each other. He’s significantly closer to the floor, neck nearly craning at the angle, but what else is new? Sherlock watches him, expression inscrutable, and after a beat goes on to pluck some more. His voice cracks when he finally speaks, rusted with disuse.
“Excuse me!” He shouted, causing people to disperse in surprise. “Coming through, pardon me! Who’s the primary engineer on duty?”
. There was a young boy on one of the mats behind them, roughly ten years of age with curly hair nearly down to his shoulders. He was working intently on a figure in his hands that looked to be a miniature DSE Intrepid, completely disregarding the rubber dumbbells at his side. When he glanced up to meet John’s eye, he quickly looked away. He was startlingly familiar.
"No sulking, this will come off, we're gonna shower and then you can have it again, 'Lock." John undid it and helped Sherlock to the bathroom and then to the tub. He showered himself and Sherlock and cleaned them both with sandalwood shower gel. Then he dried both of them with a towel and laid them in bed again. "Because you were a good boy, pet." He fastened the collar around Sherlock's neck again. "Now cuddle with me, Sherlock."
"Maybe? But that doesn't matter. I'm not a slave nor a whore and I take suppressants from a young age." Sherlock answered and pouted.
"Perfect, but first we'll lose that." He started undoing Sherlock's gag and blindfold. "I wanna see and hear you when you come, pet." Sherlock's eyes were glassy from tears, blindfold and subspace and he truly looked fucked out. But he looked so happy.
"If you feel good, nod, pet." And Sherlock nodded. Then he cuffed his hands to the headboard and he tied his shins to his thighs so he couldn't move his legs. Sherlock sucked on the gag happily. John took him into his loving arms and started to make another collar of lovebites under the black one, rubbing himself against Sherlock. "Oh pet," John moaned and Sherlock moaned too but it sounded more like a wet purring. "Oh god, fuck!" John swore and found the lube by touch. "Gonna make you feel good, 'Lockie. My good lad."
“John, please. Not this. Anything but this.”
Unknowing, innocent, she smiles her gummy smile up at him. Sherlock is helpless to do anything but bunch her up tighter to his chest.
go. The choice has always, always been yours, so don’t try to pin your cowardice on me yet again.” Her hand slides from his hair to his cheek. The warmth of the gesture prompts his eyes shut. “It’s time, Sherlock. Enough is enough.”
“Don’t you.”
John continues. “It sounded almost like permission. But permission for what? Perhaps you could enlighten me, since you two always seemed to be one step ahead in everything. What am I missing?”
“We underestimate her, even now.” He shakes his head. “For all our sakes’, John. There’s a time and place.”
The phone goes unnoticed.
“How often?” Sherlock hears John move closer, the sound of him planting his feet and crossing his arms; a familiar position of defence and offense.
She comes to kneel in front of him, solemn and
No, these days he devotes his skills to the important things: feeding and changing Rosie; putting on the tea when she gets too loud at 3 AM; pulling John from the brink of the sadness that seems to be constantly drawing him towards its abyss.
Sherlock nods.
Sherlock’s back is against the wall, knees drawn up to his chest, his breathing ragged. “What lesson; what mistake?”
A heart, poisoned. The boy cries out, silently, desperately trying to think of the kind of poison, of the cure, if that cure existed, if he could create it himself.
be. Let
There they go again: words and their immeasurable power. For a split second, for forever, time stops and the world fades away. All that remains is John’s eyes, piercing and gentle with a near-invisible undercurrent of hunger, on his, the tingling burn of the ceramic on his palm. Surely he’s dead. Surely, in this moment, he’s expired of old age, his hair a thin white ghost of its remembered curls, his skin sagging off his bones. Surely, he’s died, and St. Peter wears John’s face as he awaits his sentence of damnation.
John laughs, reclining back into his chair, before growing serious once more. “You spoke at my wedding. You composed us a piece to dance to, specifically for our first dance, as man and wife.”
Padded cells are their own brand of peculiarity. You’re left there to tear your own mind apart but you’re afforded the supposed comfort of firm, soft walls. Their purpose is to torture you until you ache to die and deny you the kindness.
He’s on the floor, writhing with a phantom pain.
John heaves a tender sigh. “Oh, Sherlock,” he murmurs, and presses their lips together.
“Sherlock.”
“So, Sherlock.” John’s lips, chapped and tasting of milky tea, touch his every time he speaks. “
“I don’t – ,” she continues. “I really don’t want to look at your or hear your voice right now, or any time soon. I know you did what you had to but, God, Sherlock.” Tears pool in her eyes, fall down her cheeks, touch her shaking lips. “I don’t think I can do this anymore.”
When he isn’t dreaming about Eurus, when he isn’t thinking about John – almost never – Mary dominates his thoughts. She’s there, eyes dancing, a cruelly beautiful grin on her face, lips clean of blood.
It isn’t the Woman, it will never be the Woman. He’ll see her beheaded a thousand times before he chooses her above John.
“I don’t – it’s not like I keep track exactly how often–.”
Once, Sherlock Holmes would have been above begging a toddler to perchance wear one of the pretty dresses her Papa had bought her, but that man has been squarely replaced by this one, a man not above bribery in order to re-establish a thin facade of propriety in the 221B household.
“Why, Sherlock?” John hisses, voice like an inferno.
. Sherlock softens his posture, stepping across the length of the kitchen closer to John. “I hope it goes well, then.”
John is never cruel; he doesn’t have the capacity to be. His anger, when it comes, long-winded and slow, is cold and precise, like a surgeon’s scalpel sliding down into your skin. This isn’t anger, but Sherlock is lost as to what exactly it is.
“Sherlock.”
Sherlock’s hands halt on the milk bottle.
“Sherlock,” she sing-songs, arms crossed at the foot of his bed.
Of course.
John is silent for seconds, for eternity. “You taught me how to waltz for a wedding you left early.” A pause. “Is that what you want?”
“John – .”
John interrupts him. “What does she say? Is it a particularly long message that she visits so often?”
Eternity passes by before he calms his sobs to painful, hitching breaths. He remains curled up on the concrete, but opens his mouth to speak. “You need to leave, Mary. You can’t stay here, I can’t keep you here. Free yourself.”
He can be so unkind though.
John’s eyes are flint. “You didn’t dance. You left, you didn’t dance. After you told us about Rosie.”
John shakes his head. He closes his fist around the heart, crushing it. The boy retches, sobs, falls on his knees and begs for forgiveness.
“I love you,” John murmurs, with a tinge of wistfulness that says what he can’t.
“You could try kissing back you know.” John’s voice is light but he is extricating himself calmly but quickly, misconstruing Sherlock’s stunned unresponsiveness for rejection. There’s a quiet pain in his voice and Sherlock comes to the horrifying realisation that he has
The face that stares back at him in his mirror while he shaves is one of a stranger. Logically – logically, Sherlock knows that that is false, his eyes the same piercing shade, his lips the same thin pink, the lines on his face placed exactly where they always have been. Maybe it’s his heart that’s different: sluggish, struggling its way to the next beat. It sits in his ribcage like a poisonous core, corroding the rest of his system.
– “I really am dead. It’s incredibly disheartening to have to keep reminding the two of you of that.”
Without looking, he sees Mary roll her eyes. “You bloody moron,” she says, quotes? “Trust me, Sherlock, it’s gone before you know it.”
Sherlock has taken his first sip of tea when John speaks.
Molly’s eyes are bright and cold, her mouth a thin, trembling line. “I think – I think it would be fair if I asked to never see you again. Or at least not anytime soon.”
Sherlock tenses; braces his weight on the kitchen table. “A day.”
“We need to talk,” John says, finally.
“Mary - .” The name bursts from him on its own volition, and his horror curls his tongue. He becomes silent.
“I have,” Sherlock whispers around the lump in his throat.
Sherlock nods, again. The doors of the St. Bart’s morgue have never felt colder.
There is a stunned, terrible warmth in his eyes, his mouth softly agape as he absentmindedly shifts to better hold Rosie. They stand there, staring at each other, Sherlock helpless in understanding what John isn’t saying. The silence is heavy to a choking degree.
His throat thickens. “I’ve failed two out of three already, darling. I won’t live to fail the third.”
This temporary peace is awarded to them by Rosie. Through some unfathomable miracle, she had laid down for her afternoon nap without any of the normal fuss, giving them an estimated three hours, 16 minutes, 19 seconds, based on the flickers of her eyes and her breathing pattern. Sherlock reclines on his armchair, valiantly ignoring John’s obvious attempts at capturing his attention.
He closes his eyes, his flushed face pressing harder into the cool floor. “Free us from each other.”
“In my defence, out of the both of us, I do have a longer history when it comes to hallucinations–.”
“I think it’s fair to say that Mary knew everything there was to know in my head, John, without me poisoning her mouth with my thoughts.” The words, after they’re out, shatter through him, the shards digging into his airways, his brain, slowing everything down to a stop. She’d known, she’s
Sherlock dreams of a young boy laughing the carefree laugh of the innocent. He has dark hair and grey eyes. At his side is a man, taller than him but shorter than average, sandy hair and wounded eyes. In his palm, which he reaches out to the boy, is a black, beating mass. The boy recoils, recognizing it for what it is.
“She’s from the surgery, you’re dressed more for familiarity rather than to make an impression, implying that you’ve known her for quite some time and see her frequently; no place you frequent more than the surgery, as I doubt you’re picking up at the grocery, or at your therapist’s. You’re excited, but wary, with the obligatory lingering of guilt for this date, implying both that she’s aware of your history and is aware of how to tackle it in your budding romance.” Squaring his shoulders imperceptibly in his third-best dressing gown, Sherlock spreads his arms much similar to a bowing conductor at the orchestra. “Let me know how it goes.”
So focused is he on their game and Rosie’s intoxicating laughter that he doesn’t even realise John has entered the flat until Rosie squeals, running towards where her Papa is standing by the sofa. Sherlock grins at him, holding up the dress and preparing an explanation, but the look on John’s face cages the words before they can pass his throat.
Mary’s curls are an exquisite halo under the single fluorescent light. She’s sitting on the floor, back against the wall, legs spread and bent at the knees; the concrete is wet, blood or tears or spit.
“Try me.”
He works, enough to keep food on the table and rent paid, knows well enough that John isn’t able to, or shouldn’t; not with the wound of everything so fresh. He ignores the sores festering in little parts of his own mind, colours and sounds and pains and joys dulled by an almost frightening degree. The hypothalamus rots in its cage. Sherlock is almost alarmed by his unconcern.
Then, mind and body in unison, “‘and if all else remained and he were annihilated, the universe would turn into a mighty stranger.’”
Regardless of what Mary says, Sherlock’s love is not what John deserves, what anyone deserves. Nor is it something to be desired, his companionship not something to be coveted. Sherlock knows how to keep people away. He knows how to wrap barbed wire and immovable stone around him to ruthlessly cut into any Molly Hoopers or Lestrades that may dare to come near. If the bleeding and mauling doesn’t work, like it hasn’t with any Molly Hoopers or Lestrades, Sherlock’s affection is another monster to fear. Sherlock loves down to the grotesque infinitesimal: to teeth, to skin, to pores, to blood. For this fact, Sherlock loves all-consumingly, destructively.
The shine of John’s shoes one afternoon makes Sherlock freeze.
“Answer the question, Sherlock.” John Watson is never cruel. John Watson is not a cruel man.
John’s face becomes shuttered and guarded. “You can’t just throw her at me like a grenade and run, Sherlock.”
“Why won’t you die?” Sherlock snarls. “
John doesn’t rear back, but it’s a close thing. The aborted movement draws his gaze back to him. “Here I was, afraid that your insufferable assumptions about my ability to deduce a single thing in that ridiculous head of yours had died.” John is glaring, but it’s absent, almost like an afterthought. “It’s not obvious to me. Answer the question.”
“You’ve been lying to me for a very long time, Sherlock,” John breathes into his neck. Pleasure and guilt shorts out his overwhelmed brain.
“I made you a vow, Rosie.” He smoothes a thumb down her cheek. “To you and John and Mary. I swore I would protect you, that I would always be there for you.”
“She said, ‘Get the hell on with it, John Watson.’ And, oddly, it almost sounded like she was urging me to do something, something beyond getting the hell on with it.” John pauses, chuckles. “Something I was too afraid to do; the way she always does –
Life after Eurus is astonishingly mundane. After her, everything seems like quibbles to Sherlock; the final problem indeed. These days, he rarely has the energy to be scathing to any of the idiotic hangers-on in Lestrade’s crime scenes; just as well, since they’re all giving him a wide berth, as if fearing that any proximity to him would drive any of their relatives to a psychotic episode leading to mass murder.
“Busy, Mary.” He screws his eyes shut, tightly, with the childlike hope that if he can’t see her, she can’t be there.
John’s coos begin overpowering Rosie’s cries. Soft hushing noises emanate from the room, the creaking of the wooden floor signalling that he’d begun to rock her back and forth; the way Mary – .
The night continues on with no explanation coming forth, John choosing to ignore the Damocles sword his statement has hung over their heads. Sherlock has played the waiting game with far more dangerous people, whose morals have taken a permanent vacation, people hell-bent on destruction and pain and suffering. Yet nothing feels as excruciating as this.
"Yes, John, but I can shower in 7 minutes-"
He checked his list for the last time and left it on John's armchair. He made his way to John's old room and nostalgia hit him. They were just colleagues, but John has found a way to Sherlock's heart and they became friends and then John kissed him sweetly after one dangerous case and Sherlock knew he has found a way to John's. That was almost 3 months ago - exactly 2 months, 19 days and 16 hours. John moved to Sherlock bedroom and this room didn't have a purpose, until now.
John had a mess in his mind.
"Because I want to, now shush, we will talk home I promise," John answered him and looked out from a window, he really was doing it. The cab stopped in front of 221 and John paid the cabbie and noticed that Sherlock didn't hurry into the flat like he used to do, no, he waited patiently before the door, keys in the lock. "Thanks, bye." He closed the doors of the cab and walked to Sherlock.
"Alright, I'm gonna believe you!" He scented and mouthed his back. "Lay down and I'll good care of you, my lovely omega." But Sherlock was having none of it and pushed his ass high.
"John, if you don't want to do this, please don't. I'm already slipping into..."
Something was wrong. He freed Sherlock's feet and waited until he picked the lock on his cuffs. Sherlock quickly fled to his clothes and he dressed. "Tell me what Lestrade said in that text." He said with a face without emotions but his voice betrayed him. Sherlock was scared... but
"John can do now, Sherlock," John giggled and kissed his love. "With you, it's always something new...that's why I love you, brat." He waited for a response but none came, Sherlock was asleep with a little smile on his lips. Now he was in his Fourteen-Hour-Post-Case-Sleep-Of-Dead and nothing could wake him up. "I love you, too," John whispered to the quiet room.
"Do you have any other kinks?"
John said goodbye to Lestrade and followed Sherlock. When he saw him waiting next to a taxi like a well-behaved dog his heart melted. Oh, how he loved his idiot. "Get in, sweetheart," John smiled and tapped Sherlock's arse lightly. Sherlock hopped in the cab and after a few minutes of silence, he spoke.
He texted one beta from his homeless network to buy pills and throw them in mail hole at 221B. In two hours he had a dose of pre-sex suppositories and popped one in the mouth. He felt less dizzy with lust after so he knew it worked.
"And before that?" He groaned.
"John... If I may ask...Why do you call me sweetheart?" He asked slightly confused.
"It's the 'connection of feelings with a mate', love," John chucked because he felt Sherlock curiosity. He probably deleted this too.
Sherlock shivered in anticipation, he will be able to do it again, after those damned years. He already planned his tactic when he was climbing those bloody stairs. He opened an old shoebox and just looked in it for a while. Black gag, pleasure duck tape for BDSM purposes, black silk rope, black padded wrists cuffs with chain, vibrator, three buttplugs with different colour and size, black collar, a big tube of lube and nipple clamps. It should do. He already felt calmer.
"Because it's just heat and hormones talking." John signed not touching Sherlock, just having hands in fists. "You don't actually feel about me that way." Sadness in his voice broke Sherlock's heart. No, he felt like that a long time but thought that John was like any other alpha. Just trying to tie omega to themselves, not actually caring about their brain or ambitions. But John was different and he proved that to Sherlock every day.
Everything was alright now. With John's voice in his head telling him things in his Captian voice he layed for another 4 hours. When he heard real John in the living room he held his breath and waited. But nobody climbed those stairs to Sherlock and he didn't know if he was relieved or disappointed in himself.
Wordlessly, Sherlock nods.
“Three, four times.”
“Don’t bullshit me, Sherlock.”
Mrs. Hudson is beside herself with attempting to re-establish normalcy, Mycroft much the same. Sherlock, in this past half year, can hardly remember a day where Mrs. Hudson hasn’t attempted to engage him in a petty quarrel about biscuits or body parts or blood on the walls of the fridge after a botched experiment. Mycroft rarely visits him, but files containing highly-classified information appears on his table like clockwork every week or so. With Mrs. Hudson, he plays along, casting his mind away while his mouth runs. With Mycroft, Sherlock cracks all the cases without leaving the sofa, then tosses the file of the week to rot with the rest.
He clears his throat. “See who–?”
Mary scoffs. “Sherlock – ”
When he speaks next, John’s voice is soft and unreadable.  “Okay, then. If that’s what you want.”
“It’s all in your head, see, that’s the point. Anything she says, it’s all you. What things are coming out of Mary’s mouth that don’t belong there?”
“I’m dead, Sherlock.”
Sherlock hums. “I love you, too.”
“You see her, too.”
Perhaps it’s because he was never so pathetically, desperately in love with any of those people. Perhaps.
Thus, he would be content. If never a lover, then always protector, hoping to be friend.
“Something Mary said, during the Culverton case.”
John was wrong again, in another respect.
Rosie, swaddled in her yellow blanket and footie pyjamas, is exquisite. Sherlock cradles her in his arms in a way he’s never held anything else, not with the care and fear and love. Nothing beyond –
It’s been over two years, John is back to cycling through London’s stupidest, and it’s as though nothing has changed, beyond the pink, squalling thing spitting up her carrots on Sherlock’s coat.
“– the dead.”
Suddenly, his head is yanked up, and Mary’s furious eyes bore into his. “You selfish, ignorant bastard,” she hisses. “I don’t believe there is any sin too big to never forgive, but you are veering into the wrong side of my patience and mercy.
Sherlock sobs. “
. Leave me be.”
John.
Her kind eyes during the wedding, the gentle sadness cloaked in joy after he’d informed them of Rosie, “
John huffs. “A week?”
A whimper bursts from deep within his throat. He opens his swollen eyes.
Sherlock wrenches his eyes away from John. “You’re not stupid, John.”
If he has no one, at least he has Rosie.
Dinner is casual, hilariously light, with the customary questions about each other’s day, such a domestic routine that it always gives Sherlock a secret thrill. Tucking Rosie in is much the same, the old song and dance of a sleepy toddler putting her fists up against slumber, her demands for a second story, and then a third rebutted. The kettle is boiled, the tea is steeped, the telly on but muted. As they take their respective places in their chairs, Sherlock finds it harder and harder to breath.
Genuine amusement suddenly floods John’s eyes. “I’ll be sure to give your well wishes; I’ve heard he’s a fan.”
He clenches his shaking hands into unsteady fists.
“Now, since I’ve taken up residence in your wonderful brain, I know exactly what’s holding you back from pursuing – what was it – ‘romantic entanglement’ with my husband.  Furthermore, I know why you loathe yourself for wanting what you do. Absurdly, you feel like you’re taking advantage of my unfortunate demise; at your expense might I add. Therefore, I deduce –,” she raises her finger in a eureka motion, “you’re using me as an excuse to be a coward.”
– she’d always known.
The snow outside falls in thick blankets. The people of 221B laugh uproariously. The sharp cry of a child breaks out beneath the merriment.
A touch to his shoulder –
John draws back, but only enough so that their eyes can meet. “Let me rephrase that. I have been
He sighs. “Yes. I do.”
, Mary.”
Sherlock despises being shocked. It’s a sign of failure, more than anything, and anything he fails at must be concealed lest it be used against him. Sherlock conjures up a placid lake in his mind, keeping his expression much so. “Finally decided to indulge your blatant bisexual proclivities?”
Rosie sleeps on in her nursery. The night settles around them like the culmination of years of yearning.
It’s the least he can do to seize John’s wrist, his other hand climbing up John’s shoulder to his nape, and pressing their lips together once more. This kiss is what an epiphany feels like: new and familiar, terrifying and comforting all at once. The reintroduction of old lovers, a joy tinged with the sorrow of history. Sherlock pushes aside everything between and behind them to immerse himself fully in the clever slide of John’s seeking tongue.
Sherlock’s knuckles creak. He remains silent, pulse racing, afraid and hopeful and anguished all at once.
With all his might, Sherlock manages to put down the newspaper to meet John’s eyes. “Widower’s musings? Not really my area.”
John however remains undeterred by his paltry attempts at obfuscation. He merely tilts his head, an enigmatic smile stretching his lips and creasing the skin around his eyes. Sherlock feels pinned by his gaze, skin crawling with discomfort and desire in equal parts.
. What were you going to say?”
Sherlock has survived this long mostly for the excellent quality of his bravado. “Well, declarations such as the one you made earlier tend to preclude drastically life-altering events in popular culture. Tell me John, are you about to break up with me?”
“How lovely of you to put me in with Moriarty, Sherlock.” Mary’s eyes are dancing. “Shall we have a party?”
