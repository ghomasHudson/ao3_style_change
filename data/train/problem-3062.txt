“Do you really want to come fishing with us?” Dean asks as they stroll slowly across the street, in deference to Castiel’s limp.  “It’s bound to get a little crazy.  Sam and me are both competitive fucks.”
He wants to argue, but the fact is that he’s wanted to ‘jump all over that’ since he pulled it out from under a pile of trash.  Or at least since he washed all the grime off Castiel’s body once he got him home.  Doesn’t matter how hot someone is, Dean’s got standards, and they involve far less gunk getting close to his junk.
“Someone’s at the front door.”
“Damn right, babe.” Dean punctuates the claim with a light smack to Castiel’s posterior.
“That’s what I said.”
Castiel smirks.  “I’m sure I can handle it.”
Surprise Sabriel!
“I was waiting for you.”  Castiel slides his closed menu to the edge of the table.  “I’m thinking pancakes.”
um…” His neighbor lifts the box in Dean’s direction again.  His smile turns to something far more genuine.  There’s humor there, but also… maybe interest?  “Well,
“Just a bit bruised,” Castiel says as he straightens.  He pulls away from Dean and is glad to find that he can stand without help.  Testing the knee by bending it causes the ache to increase slightly, but he doesn’t seem to have lost any motion.  “I’ll be fine.”
Castiel stares at that open space for several heartbeats before he makes his decision.  He’s sore, and tired, and the mattress looks soft and inviting.
When he’d begun healing and the numbness had replaced the pain, Dean had been grateful.  Now though, he misses the ability to feel Castiel’s touch the same way he could have before.  All he senses is a light pressure now.
Jody nudges the bag in the center of her desk.  “He brought food.”
Sam swings around from where he’s working on unsaddling his horse.  Dean can feel the disapproval radiating from him, and he knows he’s probably in for a lecture.  The surge of guilt he feels is quickly subsumed by annoyance.
The numbers are against him, even if every man down there is human.  His only chance is to rely on the element of surprise, and then confusion.  He fires several rounds from his rifle to get their attention, and then he sends the horses down into the encampment.
Out of the corner of his eye he sees Ellen take the man’s order.  He catches himself leaning slightly in that direction in an effort to hear the man’s voice again and immediately straightens in his seat.  He stuffs a couple fries in his mouth and chews despite the fact that he can’t really taste them anymore.
Castiel’s feet carry him toward the back exit at six minutes and ten seconds.
These thoughts leave him restless and agitated, and he doesn’t believe he’ll be able to sleep at all now.  He slides out from under Dean’s arm and out of the bed, careful not to wake him now that he’s sleeping peacefully.  Rubbing both hands over his face, he winces at the growing stubble on his cheeks and the grit still coating his skin.  He craves a bath, with clean hot water to wash away the dirt and the fear and the grief he feels for his brother.  But he doubts the hotel owner would appreciate him asking for one at this hour, so he’ll have to wait until morning.
Sam slides a hand between them and cups Gabriel through his jumpsuit.  “Shouldn’t you ask me for something that you weren’t going to get anyway?”
Emotions swell up inside Dean so vast and uncontainable that he feels like he might burst from it.  The sudden infusion of energy from it drives him up onto an elbow, and he catches Castiel’s mouth with his own again.  This kiss is completely different from the last.  It’s not soft touches and slow exploration; it’s hard and rough and full of fire.
Crossroads is a larger town half an hour north, and it’s where Purgatory’s residents go when they need anything that isn’t carried at the local mercantile.  Castiel hasn’t been there yet, but everyone has told him that’s the place to go.  “How about we go tomorrow?” he suggests.  “I don’t have work, and--Dean?  What’s wrong?”
In the mercantile, Dean finds Sam speaking to the owner in a low voice.  They’ve purchased from him before, and he carries supplies that only Hunters would ask for.  Dean exchanges a nod of greeting with the owner, and leaves Sam to obtain what they need.  He scans the large interior but doesn’t immediately see Cas.  When he glances at his brother again, Sam gestures toward the back of the store, indicating Cas disappeared behind the maze of shelves.
“Can’t believe I didn’t think of it,” Dean mutters to himself as he stalks through the bunker’s halls toward the bedrooms.  “Fucker melted my damn brain.”
“Awesome.”
He’s staring at the finished bike, mentally cataloging everything he’s done, and hoping to find one more thing to do, when a cruiser pulls up outside the garage.  Dean looks up and isn’t surprised to see his brother unfolding his massing frame from the car.  Sam takes his responsibilities very seriously, and checking up on Dean daily is one of them.  Dean stopped trying to convince him to give it a rest a long time ago.  Not only is Sam the most stubborn person he knows, next to himself, but it’s nice having a chance to talk to the kid every day now that he’s moved out.
A lump rises in Dean’s throat, and his eyes sting.  If Castiel had succeeded… Dean wouldn’t have known any different, and he hates that.  But what’s worse is knowing that Castiel has that in him.  What if…?  Fuck, he doesn’t even want to finish that thought.  He’s attached now, more than he ever thought he could be, and the idea of losing Castiel sends pain lancing through him.
Castiel casts him an amused glance as well, making Dean blush.  But he continues examining Baby, feeling her stomach as the contractions work through her body, and checking to see how close she is to actually popping out a new pegasus.  And he directs his words to her, as if she understands exactly what he’s saying. (And maybe she can. Magical creatures have unexpected gifts.) “Everything appears to be normal so far.  The foal doesn’t feel like it’s in the wrong position. So it’s just a matter of work and time.”
Wyatt finally looks up from his boots.  He clears his throat, but doesn’t speak.
Up ahead the trees thin and open into a meadow.  Once he leaves the tree cover he’ll be completely exposed.  But that might have the advantage of drawing his stalker out into the open as well, giving Castiel a glimpse of what kind of danger he’s facing.
At first Castiel has trouble parsing the coded shorthand, but after a few tips from Sam he works it out well enough that he can read it, if slowly.
Happiness.
His shoulders relax, and he gives her a fond smile.  Even if he hasn’t missed Boston, he’s missed Charlie.  He enjoys his new home, and his new friends, and working with Sam and Jody is a lot of fun, but it’s not quite the same as spending every day with Charlie as his partner.  She’s very much like a sister to him.
That train of thought is derailed when arms come around his shoulders and someone leans into his back.  He goes stiff, his hand clenching too tight on his glass.  But then he catches the scent of Jo’s favorite vanilla perfume and he relaxes, leaning into her embrace, and even tilting his cheek up for her to plant a kiss on.
“C’mon man, talk to me,” Sam entreats, going with Unthreatening and Reasonable so he doesn’t spook Dean any further.  One wrong step and Dean’ll clam up for weeks. “What’s wrong? And don’t tell me it’s nothing. I’m not an idiot, and I know you better than anyone,” he adds when Dean looks like he’s going to object.
“Sorry,” Dean says, raising his voice enough to be heard over the loud rumble of his tires over the rough pavement.  “We won’t be on this road for long.”
Anger at Cas’ stupidity hits him first.  He’d warned Cas not to go down to the river.  Then the unexpected, sharp tang of fear backs up into his throat.
Doug looks back at him in question.  Castiel reaches into his coat and pulls out a silver knife.  It’s not nearly as vicious looking as the knives Dean and Sam carried, it’s barely more than a dinner knife, but it’s effective as a deterrent against any beast sensitive to silver.  He flips it and presents the handle to his partner.  “Take this.”
Dean turns to face him, still holding his hand just under the water’s surface.  They’re standing close enough to make Castiel aware of their slight height difference, making him tilt his chin up to meet Dean’s eyes.  Even with only an inch or two on him, Dean’s presence is large, almost looming.  Except that would denote danger, which Castiel absolutely does not feel in Dean’s presence.  There’s a heavy sense of impending
Castiel squints at him.  “Is that a real thing?”
Dean snorts.  “No, and don’t go throwing punches to say hi to people.  Jo’s just rough around the edges, and I love her enough to let her get away with it.”
“I miss the Cold War,” Castiel grumbles.
his mind crows, but his jaw stays locked tight, so he expresses his pleasure with soft grunts and growls.  They’re echoed by the omega trapped under his body.
“That’s a little less eloquent than I expect from you, Sammy,” Dean says cheerfully as he puts his breakfast in the microwave and sets it to reheat.
Castiel’s head tilts, making Dean realize he’d just given the android a nickname.  He’s preparing an apology for it, but Castiel surprises him again by not addressing it.  Instead he gives Dean a solemn nod.  “Thank you.”  He finally breaks his lazer beam stare and looks down at the pile of clothing on Dean’s bunk.  “My previous owner was not so lenient with me.”
Then his hands are on Castiel’s body, checking for blood or injuries.  “Any sharp pains? Does it hurt to breathe?’
His hand is still wrapped around Castiel’s wrist, and he doesn’t realize he’s squeezing until Castiel cups his free hand over Deans.  “Angel Industries grows replacement organs and limbs from cloned DNA.  They’re going to use Jimmy’s DNA to create a complete body for me.”
Boy was he wrong.  He’s about to be seeing a whole lot more of Castiel Jameson, and not in the fun way.  At least until he can come up with a foolproof escape plan.
The anxiety swoops in on him again, despite the calming exercises and his hands begin to shake.  When he fumbles and drops a tool, he begins cursing.  Jo gives him a curious look, but apparently realizes he’s not in the mood to be social, so she wisely keeps quiet.  She usually doesn’t tip toe around him, because he’s asked her not to treat him with kid gloves, but whatever is happening on his face has convinced her that today isn’t the day to follow that specific request.
He’s stopped shivering, and is now radiating heat into Castiel’s skin.  That alleviates some of Castiel’s worries, but his concern still simmers inside him.  “Was it a nightmare?” he asks softly, risking the question now that Dean is volunteering snippets of information.
Castiel can understand now why Dean said that the blood was changing him for the worse.  Because he can hear the wistful undercurrent in Sam’s words.  He misses that power.  But guilt rolls off of him in nearly palpable waves too.
Thankfully, Castiel doesn’t seem to be intimidated, so it doesn’t look like they’ve threatened him over Dean’s chastity or something equally stupid.  In fact, he seems pretty engrossed in the conversation.
The Boy leans toward his companion and whispers conspiratorially “Told you he’d like him.”  He either doesn’t notice, or doesn’t care about the flat look the demon gives him.  He’s nearly bouncing on the balls of his feet when he answers Alistair.  “Found him near a water source.  I thought he’d be some interesting entertainment.  And he’s not bad looking.”
More than okay.  “Please touch me again, Dean.”
“Close your mouth when you eat, you gremlin,” he says before shoving a couple fries in his own mouth and chewing obnoxiously.
Dean looks at him, hard and piercing.  “Did I?”
Chuckling, Dean nudges him with his shoulder.  “Don’t hog the popcorn.”
Castiel smiles when Dean joins him at the sink, but resists being hipchecked out of the way.  Instead he hands Dean a towel and then goes back to washing the dishes.  “You know I don’t mind.”
“I’ve just gotta-” Chuck lifts a hand towards Castiel’s face, hesitating briefly when Dean doesn’t physically back away.  But when Dean also doesn’t make any other threatening moves, he continues with the motion. His fingers slide up through Castiel’s hair, bypassing the power button near his temple.  His palm settles over Castiel’s forehead, and he presses all five fingertips in at once.
“Should we join them?”
” Miss Ava corrects her as she turns to glance in the stranger’s direction.
“All the doors in this hallway are bedrooms,” Dean says as he leads Castiel past closed doors labeled with numbers.  He stops at one and opens it to an empty room with a narrow bed and a wardrobe.  “You can pick whichever one of these ones you want, but the last one on the right is Sam’s room, so not that one.”
More acid swirls in Dean’s stomach, and he suddenly wishes he’d eaten at least a few bites of the last meal he’d been given, even if it was barely edible.  It doesn’t seem right to die on an empty stomach.
The name is spoken low, but is unmistakably Dean.
What strength he’s able to pull from that thought leaves him when they reach the scaffolding.  The tiny flame of hope that Dean had been harboring that the gallows would be too rickety to do the job dims to embers when the steps don’t even squeak under his feet.  And when he and Sam stand side by side, a noose dangling before them, the flame goes out completely.
Dean snorts.  “Of course not.  They’re easier to get through than locks.”
Sam grins as he watches Jack running his fingers over the spines of the books.  His look of wonder mirrors Castiel’s so closely that Sam feels like he’s gone back in time.
“It’s too bad you can’t enjoy the results,” Dean says.  He shovels another pile of eggs and veggies into his mouth and smiles around it while he chews.  He doesn’t bother to swallow before adding “it turned out pretty good.”
Castiel’s head comes up in alarm as they step through the doorway.  “Two?”
There are so many questions Castiel wants to ask, but he agrees that time is of the essence.  He can table his curiosity until a more appropriate time.  But there’s a huge problem with the current situation.
“You could take off the coat and pants,” Dean suggests.  Although he’s also kinda resistant to Castiel removing his clothes.  As much as he likes to see Cas naked, seeing him in Dean’s own clothes soothes some of the ache in his heart.
The condescending tone digs at Castiel's temper. He realizes that most folks in the territories take one look at his refined clothing or hear his educated Eastern accent and assume he'll be useless, but he'd hoped he'd given Winchester enough proof that isn't true.
He allows Dean to guide him, lowering him to the wet earth, and there’s no longer any thought of what they had just survived.  A new instinct has taken hold of them both.  Instinct born from the need to celebrate the fragility of life.
“Hey, Cas, hey… shhh, it’s okay.”
I just added some new fanart by purgatory-jar at the end of chapter 2, so go back and check it out if you haven't seen it yet :D
Wearily, he sinks back against the wooden seat and tries to make himself comfortable.  Raw fatigue pulls at him, and he allows his eyes to slip closed.  In spite of the fatigue, hunger, and muscles that ache from the abuse of a rough coach ride, he knows that he’s doing the right thing going after the Winchesters.  He’s come too far, waited too long, to simply let them slip through his fingers now.
mistake, not yours.”
They’d been raised with all the advantages that money and an important family name could provide.  An excellent education at private schools, music lessons, fine clothes.  Their friends, if they could be called that, were chosen from several old established Philadelphia families.  The twins hadn’t connected well with the boys they were expected to befriend though, mostly preferring each other’s company.
madness.  Something you could never understand.”
), he’s out the door and pulling up to Benny’s place in less than ten minutes.  They exchange greetings, and luckily Benny seems to have given up on needling Dean about Castiel.  They head into the garage, and are soon elbow deep in engine parts.  Benny can make his way around a toolbox, but for anything more complicated than changing the oil, he relies on Dean’s expertise.
Castiel’s smile turns genuine.  “I would like that.  Rootbeer, please.”
Castiel slams a palm on her desk.  “I am not an
His deep voice, getting rougher with age, sounds like it was made for the song.  He croons the words softly, like he isn’t sure he wants to be heard, but Castiel is too close to miss it.
Or he can continue to be chicken shit about it, and just bask in Castiel’s presence.  Treasure every look, every gentle slide of Castiel’s fingers against his hand or his arm.  Soak in the cooling relief of his presence, because Castiel probably doesn’t understand the concept of Personal Space, and isn’t standing shoulder to shoulder with Dean in the print shop because he craves that contact as well.
It doesn’t seem to reassure Dean at all.  He scrubs even harder at the already clean soup pot in his hands.  “Is that why you’re only working part time?”
“Ask him. To stay,” she says slowly.  “If you don’t think he wants to, you’re not paying attention.  But he’s probably waiting for you to invite him.  He’s on your turf, and he’s not going to overstay his welcome.”
The pinch of regret under his sternum over that realization just pisses him off more.
He slips the power supply into Jack’s chest cavity with careful fingers, closes the compartment, and let’s the t-shirt Cas dressed him in drop down over it.  Deja vu overwhelms him when he lifts his eyes to Jack’s face.  His hair is lighter, and the face isn’t exactly the same, but there’s something about the angle of his jaw and the bow of his lips that echoes Castiel’s features so strongly that he looks like he could be Cas’ kid.
“Oh hell no.” Dean starts to struggle in earnest. The adrenaline pouring through his veins gives him extra strength, but still the restraints hold firm.
“What the hell?”
Jo takes one look at them when they exit the bedroom and rolls her eyes with a groan.  Sam and Eileen are with her, and Sam wrinkles his nose at their disheveled appearance but his eyes glow with humor, and Eileen doesn’t bother to hide a belly laugh.
decisions about what you did with your clients?” he asks.
“I see.  It’s a lovely name, although I prefer to be called ‘Cas’.”
Based on what he can hear, he thinks the wolves are very close now and may have picked up the scent of the horses.  As long as he and Dean are out in the open, they’re vulnerable to anything that comes at them.
He bites his lip against the pain in his fingers as he grasps the first few handholds.  The childish urge to sit right back down on the ledge and wait for help rises up, but that means trusting Dean or Sam to come back for him
Sam’s lips press together, and the glance he shoots Dean’s way isn’t anywhere close to pleased, but he nods curtly in acceptance.
That perks Jimmy up even more.  “What kind of upgrades are you looking for?”
The peaceful moment drags on, and Sam lets his thoughts drift.  Most of the time he has difficulty just lounging around, since there’s usually something requiring his attention at any given time, whether it’s a Hunter referred to him for advice, or the book he’s been working on about culture in the City’s underworld, or even the greenhouse needing to be harvested.  There’s always something to study, someone to save, or just the random chores around the bunker that aren’t taken care of by Dean’s robots.
Jo shows him her teeth, more of a challenge than a smile.  Behind them the bell rings over the door as the stranger walks in.
Dean had managed to finally sink into the mindlessness of his work, so he’s startled by Castiel’s sudden presence.  He knocks his head against the car’s dash as he straightens too quickly, and he blinks up at the android standing over him.  The embarrassment and shame that he’d forgotten while he worked comes rushing back, along with a wave of heat to his cheeks.
And out here, he doesn’t have to pull himself in tight to prevent brushing too close to someone who might suffer injury on contact with his skin.  He lets his head fall back on his shoulders and looks up into the starry sky, smiling at the unfamiliar constellations of the Fae realm.  With a sigh and a slight relaxation of his concentration, he lets his wings slip free.
He nods slowly, never taking his eyes from the etched glass doors.  “I’m wondering if I would have eventually attempted to leave on my own if Naomi had not discarded me first.”
Dean finishes rinsing his hands--as clean as they’ll ever get--and stands.  “Slim,” he answers, and Sam’s curt nod isn’t surprised.  He swings his attention back to Cas, who has finally stopped looking at Dean like he’s fragile and has moved to check his own horse over.
“Yes.  Is that not alright?” Castiel sifts through his logs.  “I don’t recall having been restricted to only leaving with you or Dean.”
“The barbeque is on Friday.”
“He told you a lot, didn’t he?” Sam waves Castiel’s apologies away.  “It makes this easier.  Did he tell you how it changed me?”
They ride to the river and follow it for a few miles before Dean leads them up what barely seems to be a trail to Castiel’s untrained eyes.  But he says nothing, aware that Dean is familiar with these mountains as if he’d lived in them his whole life.
Deciding that he’d rather try to see who’s coming, he ignores the tingle of fear jumping along his nerves and eases his mare into the meadow.
Castiel lifts his head, peering at Dean through the sunglasses still perched on his face.  His breath catches in his throat when he sees the way Dean is looking at him.  His eyes are wide, and he’s chewing his bottom lip hard enough that it’ll probably be red and swollen from the abuse when he finally stops.  He looks
“So you were a virgin?”  It’s a stupid question.  He knows it’s a stupid question.  But Dean just can’t wrap his head around this new information.  He surges to his feet and paces away from the fire, running fingers through his hair as the knowledge of what he’d done really sinks in.
“It’s several days, Dean.  Are you sure that you want to drive that long?”  Some of the excitement in Castiel’s voice has been replaced with worry, but he still sounds hopeful.
Sam shrugs and looks out into the moonlit wilderness surrounding their camp.  “Couldn’t sleep.”
Wiggling to make himself more comfortable makes their bellings rub together, smearing Dean’s come between them, and Dean makes a face.  “You’re going to need clean sheets.”
“Why are you walking?” Gabriel asks as he slides an arm around Sam’s waist.  He flicks a salute at their curious audience and spreads his wings, driving them further away.
Sam responds by brandishing a taser.  A strong one, that could take down a hyped up Were, or fry an unenhanced human.  “Bring it, C-3PO.”  He flicks his thumb against the trigger and a white arc of electricity flickers between the contacts.
He gets a message bounceback.
“--on the force for about ten years.  My dad was a cop, so it was just natural to follow in his shoes.”
“Sounds like it,” Benny says with a laugh.  “Did you get lucky with the hot guy from the diner?”
There’s a rustling sound, and Castiel closes his eyes to picture Dean scrambling out of his clothes.  On the canvas of his imagination he can see all that bare skin, marked by ink and scars, and his fingers curl with the need to touch it.  He does the next best thing and runs his hands over his own skin, imaging Dean’s callused and work-stained fingers in their place.
Shaking his head, he nudges Baby with his knees, guiding her to the livery's exit.  "This is such a bad idea," he mutters to himself.
“It was self defense,” he reminds her.  “And an accident.  Why do you act like I’m a cold blooded murderer?”
“That’s not completely shady,” Gabriel points out.  “Someone that rich might just have a privacy kink.”  He clicks a few more things and then sits back in his chair.  “So I guess you’re here because you want me to do some more digging?”
Silky cloth catches against the hair on Dean’s legs, and he wonders for the nth time whether he should try shaving them.  He’d done it once in high school, and it was kinda awesome for the first day, but it drove him nuts for the week it took to grow back.  He’s not sure he wants to deal with the hassle, or the upkeep.
“Thank you, Sam.”
The plan had been for Benny to stay outside while Dean and Castiel lured the dealers out to him.  But with Benny’s identity revealed and Dean missing, that plan can no longer be executed.  Castiel looks toward the exit Desmond had indicated.
“Seriously?” Castiel asks, looking at the water with new interest.  “How is this place not packed with people?”  He turns a suspicious squint on Dean.  “It’s because of how hard it is to drive up here, isn’t it?”
Dean glares at the closed door.
The power in his muscular body is leashed, carefully contained.  Castiel tries to keep his eyes up, away from the broad expanse of skin, and the odd tattoo above his heart that draws his attention like a moth to flame.  Instead he keeps his eyes on Winchester's’s face. The beard is gone, along with the stench and grime that he’d sported back in the Tombstone jail.
One perfectly aimed thrust hits him just right, and he throws his head back with a wail.  His fingers dig into Castiel’s back, trying to drag him closer, deeper.  And then he’s coming, his dick throbbing between them.
Michael Militon has always seemed bigger than life to Castiel, even though they are similar in size now that Castiel is an adult.  He has the same sharp blue eyes and dark hair that Castiel sees when he looks in a mirror, although Michael’s hair would never misbehave as much.  Even now, it’s combed neatly, while Castiel’s probably looks like he’s never held a comb in his life.  But even with the growing patches of gray at Michael’s temples, it would be obvious to anyone where Castiel had inherited his looks from.
Dean chuckles.  “I don’t think so,” he says cheerfully.  “Would you like me to check?”
Without pulling away from the kiss, Dean lifts the hand holding his beer, middle finger held up in defiance.
Was Castiel strapped to this same table, unable to call--
“Yeah, apparently we made good time and the weather cooperated or something.” There’s a shuffling sound and a soft thump, like a door shutting.  “And Dean?  He barely woke up long enough to get off the plane.”
Sam sits up and holds Castiel’s new badge under a lamp, turning it in the light to make sure the holographics look accurate.  “Are you sure bringing him with us is a good idea?”
His eyes drop to Castiel’s lips.  He wants to kiss him so bad he can almost taste it.  But he’s not going to pounce on him.  Not without permission.  He’s about to ask but Castiel seems to already be ahead of him in this race.
“Quit being a pussy and go talk to him,” Jo says, thankfully in a low voice that only carries to him.
Black Eyes snears at Sancho, who is watching the scene unfold with bleary eyes.  “He would not know what to do with his prize.”
More than once he considers leaving Dean there with plenty of firewood, water, and food, and riding out for help.  But he knows it would be foolhardy.  If he succeeded in finding his way out--and there’s no guarantee that he would--he might never find his way back again.
Wonderful.
Tugging the coat closer around his shoulders, Dean watches Castiel manhandle the guy up onto the table and strap him down.  He’d help, but he’s afraid if he moves too much he’ll lose his balance and faceplant on the concrete.  It’s filthy, and he’d rather not get up close and personal with it.  “If you got away, why didn’t you come back to us?” he asks.  “Why just call?”
One of Dean’s hands slides up Castiel’s ribs, and catches his arm.  He nudges until Castiel releases his grip on the back of Dean’s neck.  “Put your hands behind your head,” he orders.  His voice is muffled under the blanket, but unmistakably rough with lust.  He makes a soft noise of approval when Castiel obeys.
Dean’s hand shoots out and catches Cas’ shoulder.  When Cas turns back, Dean fumbles at his shirt.  He holds out the broken rosary.  Its warding properties still work, and he’d used it to get the jump on the other demons he’d killed earlier. “This too.  Be careful.”
A rough hand in the center of his back shoves Dean forward.  He’s been so focused on Sam that he hadn’t heard Kubrick’s speech to the crowd listing off his crimes and his sentencing by a judge that Sam and Dean had barely had a chance to see, much less plead their case before.  He’s nudged onto the trap door, and the noose is placed around his neck.
In the hall he finds Amara leaving the room across from his own, a shallow basin and shaving supplies in her hands.  He catches a glimpse of Dean in the bed before the door is closed.  Dean is asleep, but the heavy growth of his beard is gone, revealing that his color is much better.  Sam sits at his side, and he looks less haggard with worry.
Castiel lifts one shoulder in a shrug.  “Sitophilia is not uncommon among the clients I attended to.”
Dean obeys eagerly, straddling Castiel’s thighs on the rock ledge.  Castiel smiles up at him, appreciation gleaming like starlight in his eyes as his hands stroke Dean from knee to hip and back again.
Dean’s voice is muffled under the palm over his mouth, but he tries anyway.
“That seems very inefficient,” Castiel says.
He would love nothing more than to bury himself in Cas, to show him all the pleasures of the male body that he’s been missing out on.  To imprint him with so many memories of Dean’s touch, that no one else will ever be able to erase them.
Castiel smiles through his pain.  “Well then… thank you.”
, he realizes.
“Come on, Cas,” he whispers harshly against Cas’ lips as he increases the speed of his strokes, making sure to run his thumb over the head of Cas’ cock to catch the liquid pooling there to ease the way.  “Come on, sweetheart. Let go.”
looks up to
Dean huffs out a relieved breath.  “So you didn’t do it.”
Dean’s regained enough of his breath that his limbs follow his directions, and he sits up enough that he can see the android’s expression.  It squints at Sam, tilting its head as if trying to interpret a language he doesn’t have loaded in his database.  “I disobeyed.”
Gabriel rolls his eyes and grumles epithets under his breath.  “Well at least he’s still coming home in one piece.  So far he’s just busted a couple nanite ghosts, and he tracked down a ghoul that’s been going after fresh meat in the lower city.  Last week he took out a vamp nest with Benny--don’t glare, he’s an alright guy for a bloodsucker.”  When Sam forces himself back to a neutral expression, he continues “anyway, nothing too crazy.  He went on more difficult hunts with you guys.”
“Alright,” he says. “Let’s go find that idiot and bring him home.”
Castiel nods his understanding and Dean’s hand disappears from his mouth.  He lets out a slow, shaky breath and does his best to keep his fear in check.  Dean’s presence helps, but from the corner of his eye he can see shadows moving below the ledge moving in toward the camp, seeming to come from every direction.  They’re severely outnumbered.
Dean gives him a curt nod, then turns to his brother.  “And that goes double for you, Sammy.”
“If it makes you feel better,” Sam says, “one time Dean handed me a Bikini Inspector badge and expected me to use it to get into the hospital under the guise of an official from the CDC.  It totally worked.”
“Not exactly.  But Cesar and Jesse often take in children who have lost their parents to--” she cuts off, and the spoon she’d been stirring in the pot goes still for a moment.  “--to very bad circumstances,” she eventually finishes.
“Castiel!”
It becomes difficult to stay awake.  He’s so tired he aches with it, but he knows if he gives in to fatigue for just a moment, they could easily stray from their course.
The arms around him feel like safety and security.  Dean smiles against the cloth of Castiel’s uniform, and allows himself to be thankful for small miracles.
“There were people betting Cas would say no?” Dean asks.
Castiel’s gaze is focused out and up at the midnight sky, the half moon and field of stars bright enough to reflect off the glassy surface of his eyes.  If Dean enhances his own vision, he can see how Castiel’s irises rotate minutely, and he wonders how far into space Castiel can see.
“My lack of experience cannot be corrected if I’m not given the opportunity to learn.  And intuition is a noun defined as the direct perception of truth and fact, independent of reasoning.  I fail to see how a decision made independent of reasoning would have been helpful.” Castiel’s usual tone has gone flat, and his words are clipped.  “I had facts.  The mission was dangerous and required more than one person to complete for the safety of all involved.  Dean was late.  Dean left the building with an unknown person.  I had orders to send Benny after him after fifteen minutes.  Based on these facts I reasoned that Benny alone may not be able to assist Dean, and I went searching for him instead of staying behind.  Would you have done any differently?”
“Dean.”
“We need to find the spring,” Dean calls back over his shoulder.”
“Yes, thank you.”
Sam huffs out a sigh.   “Different hours, different descriptions of the thief, and no connections between any of the locations.”
He supposes that what he experiences does share parallels with what he understands of dreaming.  But he doesn’t agree that it’s ‘cool’.  Not when his favorite memories of Dean are corrupted by far less pleasant memories from his time in the brothel.  He’s been tempted to delete those, but since he has so few memories of his past, he hasn’t been able to justify erasing them yet.  “I don’t like it,” he says.  “They’re not all good memories, and they don’t make good dreams.  Nightmares would be a better description.”
Dean rolls his eyes heavenward, even though he doesn’t think there’s anyone up there listening.  “It’s not like that.”
“Dean,” Sam says from the other side of the fire.  “I know what you’re doing, and you need to lighten up.”
They ride out at daybreak.
Thankfully, when Castiel turns his head and finds Sam he doesn’t attack.  Moving as if he’s inebriated, he sits up and squints.  “Iiiis Deeeeeeeeeannnn allllriiiiiight?”
“I’ll get of your hair so you guys can talk, and so I can get some actual work done today.  See you tonight for some hot steamy cybersexin’, Samshine!  Stay sassy, Cassie!” Gabriel winks and waggles his fingers in a wave, and then his image disappears from the display, leaving a bluish glow overlaying the brick wall.  A simple text message with a kissy face emoji punctuates the sensation of Gabriel disconnecting from their session.
Dean’s face scrunches up.  “Gross, Cas.”
“Cas.” Dean’s voice is soft near his ear, his shoulder warm against Castiel’s.  “Is this all that different from the role play scenarios you used with clients?”
“I should be more limited in my responses,” Castiel says for him.
All Sam's POV.  There's a tiny bit of Sabriel content, but nothing explicit.
“Do you want me to bandage up those scrapes for you?”
Art by Purgatory-jar on Tumblr :D
Dean grins at him in that aggravating way of his, and Castiel turns away so his expression hides just how not funny he finds this whole situation.  He finds several clean shirts, their size suggesting they might have belonged to Sancho or Alfie.  By the cleanliness, he knows they were Alfie’s, and his fist tightens briefly in the cloth before he sets them aside to be used for bandages.
Dean is halfway down the hall before he realizes that he probably should have taken a pill before he left.  He turns back, but stops just short of opening the door.  Curling his fingers away from the knob, he hesitates.  The situation with Hannah is already uncomfortable enough without him popping his head back in to grab his meds.  He stands in the hall, uncertainty making him shift from foot to foot for a long moment.  Eventually he shrugs, and turns away.
Dean’s face scrunches up with disgust.  “Not sure you’re safe sleeping in it, but whatever.”
“Castiel, god…” Dean buries his face against Cas’ throat and revels in the solid body writing beneath him.  Hands, uncallused but not soft, need Dean’s shoulders, his back, the globes of his ass.  He moves under their silent command, rolling his hips against Castiel’s.
The bell rings two more times before they all reach the door.  Even though they never use this entrance to the bunker, there’s still a stash of weapons nearby.  Sam grabs a wickedly serrated knife, and Dean picks out an even longer dagger that glints as he flips it in his hand.  Castiel and Gabriel hang back, just close enough to see, but far enough to be out of the way.
“Dean?”
“I’m not,” Jo says firmly.  “But you’ll never know unless you ask.”
“I don’t need sleep,” Castiel points out.  The bathrobe Dean talked him into wearing over his t-shirt and underwear swishes softly around his bare legs as he keeps pace.
I’ll deck you.”  She raises her brows at him when he presses his lips together.  “That’s what you were gonna say, right?”
He watches them dully, and makes no move to dismount.  He’d very much like to join them on the solid ground after spending all day swaying in the saddle, but his body doesn’t obey the wish.  Dropping his head again, he examines his hands, still gripping the reins.  It takes an effort of concentration to uncurl his fingers and let them go.
Her smile fades, but she doesn’t look away.  “I suspect it still belongs to the demon,” she says simply.  “Unless someone can find a way to convince the demon to release me from the deal.”  She shrugs, and her smile comes back, even if it is weaker than before.  “I do not have regrets for myself.  Please do not have them for me.”
warnings in his libido.  Dean’s fingers twitch, and he gives in to the urge to touch, wrapping them gently around Castiel’s wrist.  A small tug brings him close enough that their chests brush with each indrawn breath.  Watching carefully for any signs of discomfort, Dean slides his hand down and threads their fingers together.  His heart thumps like a happy hound dog’s tail when Castiel squeezes his hand.
When he attempts to open a channel to Benny and let him know where he needs to be, Dean realizes that he might need to go for the garrote instead.  There’s a jammer nearby, blocking him from the overnet and any chance of requesting backup.
He turns to find Sam leaning against his horse’s side watching them, lips quirked into a knowing smirk.  Dean gives him his fiercest frown, which only makes his brother bare his teeth in a delighted grin.
“Home sweet home, right, Cas?” he says as cheerfully as he can muster through the exhaustion that’s hitting him now that he’s in a safe place and his nanites are no longer buzzing around keeping him awake for the drive.
“Anything else?” Castiel prompts.
He grins at her.  “I’d like that.”
,” Castiel insists, leaning forward intently.  “This is all new.  For both of us.  You don’t have to apologize for being worried about me.”
He drops his palm to his chest and it collapses when all the air he’d sucked in explodes out.  The cloth covering him is… is…
A smile ghosts over Dean’s lips.  “Of course we are.”
Dean snorts with black humor as he thinks about the tantrum the deputy threw when he found out he wouldn’t be escorting the Winchesters back out to their execution.  “There is something seriously wrong with someone who takes that much pleasure from hanging people.”
He thinks of the horse that had returned covered in blood.  It must be Dean.
For nearly a minute Dean stares intently into the tank without answering.  And then he leans into Castiel and links their pinkies together.  “Are you scared at all?”
Castiel resumes eating his own cereal.  The sugary bites are no longer crunchy, but it’s still delicious.  It has been years since he’d eaten cereal that isn’t for “grown ups”.  Hannah would be horrified.
gorgeous.  I’m not sure how you’ve managed to remain even a little bit humble.”
“He said you looked like a couple of shaggy dogs, and smelled even worse.  And that’s a direct quote.”  Wyatt chortled after sharing that tidbit.
Dean bends over the bed, driven by a dangerous impulse.  He kisses Cas softly, just the barest brush of their lips, lest he wake him.
“Cas?”
“Apparently not anymore,” Dean snorts.  “Her dead husband eventually came back.”
“It’s for Dean,” he says.  “And I’m glad you stopped by, because Dean will be here soon, and I’d love for you to meet him.”
He gives her a skeptical look.  “I think
Dean licks his lips and drags a wrist across his spit damp chin.  He shifts his weight in preparation to stand, and winces when his knee twinges.  “Maybe a little bit of both?”
She grumbles at him, but a smile twists her lips.  “So you guys need me to do some digging?”
The question makes Sam’s face twist with a mixture of anger and regret.  He hesitates, and Castiel can see that he doesn’t want to answer.  Before Castiel can take the question back, Sam sighs and says simply “he thinks I’m the Antichrist.”
“Better now,” Dean admits.
It might be best to give Cas the alone time he needs, but Dean can’t get last night’s kiss out of his head.  He has a feeling that it would be better for them both to have privacy if they talk about it. And there’s not much of it at the ranch.
“I’m going to miss you too,” Castiel says against his ear.  “But I’ll come back.”
Castiel’s lips quirk up, because he knows that Sam will probably enjoy the reprieve.  The eyerolls he’s been giving Castiel behind Dean’s shoulders have been growing more pronounced and annoyed.  Dean’s concern for his brother’s welfare is very endearing, but Castiel isn’t surprised that Sam finds it overbearing.
His heart leaps with relief.  Dean’s leg is whole and complete, though carefully braced against the edge of the desk.  And next to him rests a cane.  He can walk.
Without another word, Dean walks back to the horses.  He jerks the Appaloosa’s reigns hard, making the mare roll her eyes at the rough treatment.  Once he’s swung himself into the saddle and turned his mount about, he gestures across the river to the far bank.
Some appear to be cheaply made, the paper cracked to the point where he can’t decipher the title or author.  Others are higher quality, woven cloth or what appears to be leather, but they also show much wear.  He reaches out and lightly runs his fingers over the partially peeled away letters on a book with a black cover the sensors in his fingertips register as smooth.
Or else there’ll be fucking hell to pay.
Lean, wary, handsome.  Dangerous. All of these things Castiel had known about Winchester, but seeing him now, caught and cornered, those elements of the man are far more vivid.  He stands his ground without fear of the gun in Castiel’s hand, or embarrassment for his nudity.
Dean dismounts and opens the flap of the bag closest to him.  When he doesn't find it after searching both sides, he whirls on Cas.  "Is this it?" He snaps.
They travel as fast as they dare over rocky terrain and dense thickets.  The air turns cooler as they ride higher up the mountainside, and Castiel is grateful for the long duster coat that Cesar gifted him for the trip.
Sam grimaces sympathetically.  “It might turn into an actual fight you know.”
And then Dean is gone, fading into the dark.  More silent than the wind in the trees or the quiet lap of water from the pool.
For once, Gabriel’s avatar is wingless.  It’s just him, hair tousled, lounging against his own pillows.  Naked.  Of course.  His eyes light up with mischief and he scoots closer, throwing an arm and a leg over Sam’s virtual body.  “Do you really gotta ask?”
The warning registers just as he aims and pulls the hammer back.
“Hey, poutine is in my top three foods of all time,” Castiel protests.  “I have no room to tease you for drowning your food in condiments.”
Krissy’s voice snaps Dean out of his spiraling thoughts, and he sends a quick command to his nanites to stop the rising heat in his cheeks.  It doesn’t work to disguise his thoughts though because Krissy smirks at whatever the hell his expression must be doing.  “I think Dean likes it too”
He frowns, wondering if Mr. Pinkerton’s special client might have chosen to leave.  He doesn’t see anyone in the room, and turns to go back out to the outer office.
“I’ll just have to prove him otherwise.”
“Or he’s less complex and didn’t need as much time to program his neurons,” Amara adds dryly. Her eyes shine with humor, taking the sting out of the insult.
Castiel is too tired to care about how close he’d come to certain death.  His temper is short due to his exhaustion, and he’s more annoyed that Dean was able to sleep so soundly--both eyes closed--while so much danger hovers over them.  He doubts he’ll be able to sleep so peacefully, despite how tired he is.  “You said to wake you at midnight,” he says stiffly.  “It’s midnight, and I want some sleep.”
Alistair looks pleased.  A force shoves Castiel across the floor, leaving him in a heap at Black Eyes’ feet.  “I agree, wholeheartedly.”
Nice save.  Sam lets up on that line of teasing because he doesn’t want to actually hit a nerve.  Whatever Gabriel’s reasoning for staying at the shop nearly 24/7, it doesn’t bother Sam as long as Gabriel is happy.  He knows where to find him--online and in person--when he wants to see him.  “Dean doesn’t hate you, Gabriel.  You just aggravate the fuck out of him.  On purpose.”
Dean kisses him on the nose.  “Thanks, Cas.”
He gives Baby one last scratch and turns back to finish breaking camp.  “Where’s Cas?” he asks when he finds only his brother packing his things.
“What if he’s sentient?” Castiel whispers.  “He’s powered down, as good as dead without this.”  He looks up at Dean, and feels his eyes begin to sting as his vision blurs with tears.  “She killed him.”
Dean gives her a lazy salute, but he doesn’t leave just yet.  He leans down to kiss her on the brow. “Thank you for understanding, Ellie.”
Dean grins after her, admiring the way the sun glints off her golden curls in an almost angelic fashion.  The little spitfire definitely reminds him much more of a demon the rest of the time.  A hot breeze sets him in motion again quickly though, and he hurries after her toward the air conditioned interior of the Roadhouse.
Dean’s pleasure is always his own, even if Castiel doesn’t experience arousal and orgasm the way an organic creature would.  He still treasures every nanosecond of their lovemaking.
"Shit," Samuel hisses.  "The Colt."
A few minutes later, footsteps sound behind Dean.  Sam pauses in the room’s doorway.  “Are you ready?”
Jimmy only spares him a short glance before he looks back to Castiel.  His thumb rubs Castiel’s skin, smearing the makeup like he’s trying to remove it.  “My husband.  And he’s going to be in deep shit for this.”
Seeing her distress, Ellie decides to intervene.  “C’mon honey, I got something over at my place that’ll fix you right up.  Fancy tea, ordered from a catalogue.  Just arrived on the train last week.”  She wraps a thick arm around the small woman and guides her toward the boarding house.
with a guy who’s only had the ability to feel pain for a few weeks?” Dean grinds out.
Well at least Dean won’t get stuck staring at Castiel’s ass if he’s wearing the coat.  He’ll take the small blessings.
Dean could be way off base.  Maybe dragons are touchy-feely by nature.  It’s completely possible that Castiel is always staring at Dean’s lips because he’s hard of hearing.  Eileen stares at Dean’s mouth all the time, and it certainly isn’t because she wants to jump his bones.  And the intense eye contact when Dean’s not speaking?  Well that could just be Dean projecting.  Eye contact is normal, right?  It’s not all eye fucking.
Dean catches him, and all but carries him to the edge of the meadow.  He finds a downed tree and straddles it, and cradles Cas against him. When Cas presses closer, hiding his face against Dean’s neck, Dean runs his fingers through his hair.  Cas’ hat had been knocked free during the skirmish, and Dean attempts to tame the spiked strands. They’re silky against his fingertips.
Castiel takes the space to Sam’s other side and adds his flashlight beam to theirs.  The mound is a slimy mix of pinks and whites.  “What is it?”
“Just how serious are you about ‘keeping me’?” Castiel eventually asks.
“A will to live,” Michael corrects solemnly.
There are patterns there, lines in the skin, whorls around the knuckles.  They were designed to look real, but he can see the repeated shapes and lines.  His hands lack the subtle irregularities of a human’s.
“I was going to wait,” Dean says softly.  “I wanted to do this with friends and family around, but--” he breaks off to take a deep breath, and he opens the box.  Inside is a simple gold band.  “I can’t wait anymore.  Cas…you know I love the hell out of you, and want to spend the rest of my life with you.  At least I hope you know, and if I'm not tell you enough I'll--" he cuts himself off again, this time with a huff of laughter, but quickly turns solemn again when he meet's Castiel's gaze.  "What I'm trying to say here is... will you marry me?”
Cas had been looking at Baby with quiet admiration, but now his eyes snap to Dean’s.  “I suppose I fall into that category.”
Dean winks at Cas, before turning to acknowledge his brother.  Just as he suspected, Sam is looking at him like he’s an adorable puppy or something.  Why does everyone think he and Cas are brand new boyfriends?
Jo doesn’t though.  “He’s still being a mopey baby.”
“Good enough I guess,” Sam teases.  “Let’s go.”
Dean clears his throat.  “You’re uh… enjoying yourself, huh?”
Admitting that he’d be perfectly happy if Castiel stayed naked would be rude under the circumstances.  Mostly because Sam is glaring at Dean from the corner of the room, and while Dean’s not opposed to an audience, it’s a little too weird if it’s his brother.  “Nah,” he says with a shake of his head.  “You choose.”
Sam’s expression falls, and with his perpetually floppy hair he looks like he was just told he can’t have a puppy for his birthday.  “Oh… well I’m going to miss having him around so much.” He runs his hand through his hair, but it flops right back down where it was.  “Do you think he’ll leave right away?”
“How do you feel?”
Castiel genuinely likes Dean.  It’s rare to find the kind of instant connection they have.  But... “We just met, Rowena.  I hardly know him well enough to feel like he’s worth picking up and moving my whole life for.”
Castiel flattens a palm over his chest, and a tiny wrinkle appears between his brows.  “I don’t… I’ve never done that before.”
Both men begin to laugh again.  Dean squeezes Castiel’s shoulders then his touch falls away.  But for some reason the sensors where his hands were remain active.
One dark brow goes up, and Castiel cracks a smile at the familiar expression.  It’s one he’s caught sight of in the mirror.
“Good choice,” Dean agrees.
“You’ve got the directions?” Dean doesn’t trust Google Maps out in the middle of nowhere, and he insisted on printing the directions and buying an atlas.
Panic starts to overwhelm Castiel, and he looks around frantically as he tries to rein in his galloping thoughts.  How far had the river carried them?  Where is Sam?  Is he looking for them?  Does he even know they’re gone, or had he been caught in the flood as well?
Draping his reins over his saddle horn, Castiel accepts the book.  His hands are stiff and clumsy in his new gloves, and he fumbles with the strap of leather tying the book closed, but is eventually able to flip it open.
The cold butt of a gun presses into his palm.  Castiel feels the inscriptions carved into the handle.  The Colt.
Dean shivers.  Castiel’s usual whiskey on the rocks baritone has dropped into a lower, richer octave that makes Dean want to do anything to hear more.  He’ll drop to his knees right here in the water and worship the man in front of him, just to hear praise or profanity, hopefully both.  But Castiel’s hold is firm, keeping him upright.
It’s tempting.  Dean’s already uncomfortably hard in his jeans, and Castiel’s a goddamn sinner with his mouth.  But that’s not what he wants right now, so he shakes his head and sinks down a few inches.  He continues to stroke what he doesn’t have in his mouth with his hand.
Castiel pulls in a deep breath through his nose.  “I like it.”
Castiel tilts his head so that he can better see Dean through the hologram data.  “Is there a reason I shouldn’t?”
Something about Cas’ matter of fact tone raises Dean’s hackles, and he resists the urge to lash out.  But anger never gets him anywhere with Cas.  Sam knew it too, and had warned him last night.
He receives his answer as a soft press of lips against his own.  The kiss is gentle, almost chaste, but it’s more than Dean usually dares to hope for.
The fighting drove Sam out of the bunker, to live in the city by himself.  And even after his relationship with Madison ended, he’d refused to come home for a long time.  Almost too long, and he regrets that it took John’s disappearance on a hunt to bring him home.
“I was not born, so I cannot be an illegitimate child of nonexistent parents, nor could I fuck my nonexistent mother,” Castiel says, smiling.  His database of idioms is growing with the media he consumes, but he enjoys the way Dean rolls his eyes when Castiel continues to treat everything he says literally.
Castiel’s head dips and he looks between their bodies.  “Is that a problem?  I can correct it, if that’s your concern.”
He’s nervous, but he’s done this before.  Being in the mountains rather than on a cold rooftop in the city makes little difference.  Only the sounds of the night are changed, from the occasional sound of a carriage or a night watchman’s footsteps to the whisper of the breeze through rocks and the hoot of a distant owl.
“These might be a little short on you,” Dean says when he comes out of his room holding a bundle of cloth.  His eyes drop to Castiel’s thighs.  “You’re, uh…”
Castiel nods solemnly.  “I see.”
Everywhere the Comancheros visit, they leave death and ruin.  And a clear message promising the same to anyone who dares follow.
Castiel nods, and turns his attention back to the hanging wall of cloth in front of him.  He starts pushing them apart so he can check the styles more clearly, and access the tags.
He closes his eyes against the memory, but it doesn’t help.  His mind plays out the images against the inside of his eyelids.  Swallowing against the thickness in his throat, he says “I did.”
And his sex drive apparently.  His shorts, chosen for comfort, are now tight and restrictive, and he keeps his back to Castiel while he wills his dick to chill the fuck out.
Castiel is grateful for that.  One of the downsides to living in a small town is the lack of medical emergency services.  He just hopes that Sam isn’t so badly injured that he’ll need to be taken to the hospital.
The brusque order puts Castiel’s hackles up, but he calms again almost immediately.  Dean is right that the horses need to come before sating his curiosity.  He leads his horse to the water and allows him to drink, but his attention is still centered on Dean.
Jimmy’s car has disappeared.
“Baaaaatteeerrrrryyy loooow…” Castiel’s voice drops even further in pitch, sounding nothing like a real human.  It’s the most robotic he’s acted since Dean first powered him on.
“Well I’d have to if I wanted to get our pardons,” Dean jokes weakly.
Sam considers him for a long moment, probably weighing his sincerity.  Finally, his shoulders relax and one side of his mouth tilts up.  “You’re all right, Cas.”
weird.  No body heat, no soft rise and fall of his rib cage.  No heartbeat.
“Dean?”
The only reason Castiel had come to the library was to keep himself busy since downtime is not something he is accustomed to.  He had a steady stream of clients, and in between appointments he would clean up and prepare his work space for the next client.  On the infrequent occasions where he had gaps in his scheduled primary functions, Naomi would send him to assist with other brothel employees.  His original power supply did not require recharging, and she said it was wasteful to have him inactive for any length of time.
“What variable factors?”
Getting the youngest children to bed is a full family affair, and once it’s done, Ellie announces a late supper for the adults.  They’re joined by several of the vaqueros, and Amara is also allowed to join them since she’s not exactly a child.
“Um… maybe I should call Dean?” Aaron says, and the biocircuitry at this temple blinks.
He gets the squinty head tilt, but Castiel obeys, crab crawling backwards until he’s where Dean wants him.  The door to his battery chamber is held open by the power cord, and Dean makes sure to drape it out of his way before divesting Castiel of what’s left of his clothing.  He stays fully clothed, unconcerned with his own body at the moment, and crawls up onto the bed.
They move together like that for a long time, whispering words of love and lust.  Castiel comes first, arching his back and burying his face in the curve of Dean’s neck.  The slick heat of his come changes the friction just enough to bring Dean over the edge along with him after a few more grinding thrusts.
“Ain’t no one been able to kill him, and some of the best have tried.  And his brother’s out there too.”
Castiel wants to deny it, but dishonesty won’t do either of them any good right now.  Instead he falls back on stubbornness.  “You’ll make it.”
“Okay, come have a seat here.”
“I’m all right.” Dean heads for the water.  He kneels on the bank and strips off his shirt.
, Dean leans in to kiss him.  He misses, catching him on the chin first, but after a slight adjustment their lips meet.  And if the way Castiel kisses him back is any sign, he might be feeling as overwhelmed as Dean is right now.  Chest to chest, legs entangled, they kiss until they’re breathless.  But their lips never part for long, coming together over and over again.  Eventually the kisses shorten into soft pecks and slow drags.  The kind of kisses that are full of need, but never tip over into anything more than another meeting of lips, and a tightening of their arms around each other.
Once Cas is settled, he looks down at Dean.  "What?" he asks suspiciously.
For a man who borders on being completely delirious, Dean is amazingly argumentative.
Whaaaaat, another chapter already???
Thank you to Burrsmom for commissioning the lovely art from PurgatoryJar for me! 💚💙
Dean’s jaw sags.  “You’ve never even been with a woman?”
gives Dean the warm fuzzies and he doesn’t bother to hide how pleased it makes him to hear Castiel say it.  “Consider it your penance for taking off on me.”
feel.”  He turns his face into the wall of Dean’s chest and nuzzles the fabric covered firmness and takes a deep breath.  “You
“I know about his parents,” Castiel says.  “It must have been tough.”
Dean snorts.  “Neither, it’s just kind of warm.”
Dean drops his hand and sighs.  He looks at his little brother, who is watching him back with wary defensiveness.  Their dad would have ripped into Sam.  For endangering himself.  For not keeping good enough control of the horse.  Sam would have been in for one helluva lecture, and it would have turned into a fight.  The kind of yelling match that Dean would have to jump in and break up before it turned physical.  Because even injured, Sam won’t take that bullshit lying down.
“Really?” Dean drawls, and it feels like fingers dragging up Castiel’s spine.
“I’m already past the worst part and I’ll be fine with Cas.  And it’s not like you’ll be far if we need any help.”
They make their first camp amid rocks that shelter them from the wind.  Castiel settles Dean into a bed made from the thick furs, then builds a fire and makes dinner.
Sam swings around and stares at Chuck.  “And you wrote all of it yourself?”
Kidnapping, yeah.  Dean is pretty sure this guy’s spouse isn’t coming back.
“Thanks, Cas.  And just to be clear, if I’m really in a life threatening situation, I definitely don’t want that kept a secret from him.  It’s just the regular stuff that we’re keeping on the down low.”
“I see you’re going to St. Louis.  Is that your home?” the man asks politely.
It’s once they pass through the glass doors into the lobby that Castiel notices the first signs of Dean’s nerves.  He’s chewing at his thumbnail, and his eyes dart to every corner of the room, looking for unknown dangers.
“Dean!  Are you going to help me with this, or do you want to stay in that cell?”
Because the feelings Cas rouse in him are something he’d thought no longer existed in him.  Something torn out and eradicated by the traumas of his life, leaving his heart too scarred to beat properly for himself, much less for someone else.  He’d forgotten what it feels like.  How tempting the feelings are to give in to.
“Clean,” Castiel answers.
“The only thing that’s certain is the sun comin’ up, Mr. Jameson.  But the fella that bought that Appaloosa lives in Tucson.  I’d say that’s where he’s headed.” His eyes slide away, and he clears his throat.  “And maybe the Red Garter saloon.  Pamela Barnes owns the place.  She and the Winchesters are… old friends.”
Eyes darkening with intent, Gabriel gets up from the desk, and comes around it to straddle Sam’s thighs.  He wraps his arms around Sam’s shoulders, and tugs the back of his hair, forcing Sam to tilt his head back to look up at him.  “That kind of information comes at a price,” he murmurs.
hunt, and they’re his backup.
Castiel smiles up at Dean.  There’s that word again.  Life.  As if it applies to Castiel and Dean equally.  “I suppose you’re right.”
Charlie summons Sam to Moondor to share the info she dug up.
After a few seconds the doorknob turns and Castiel swings the door open.  He’s still sweaty and disheveled from their sparring, and now his eyes are also suspiciously red-rimmed.  He steps aside in silent invitation for Sam to enter.  He closes it behind Sam and leans against it, head dipped low and his eyes on his bare feet.
Since Dean wouldn’t knock so politely, if at all, Sam isn’t surprised when Castiel pokes his head around the door.  “Hello, Sam.  Are you busy?”
When Cas turns to him with dazed eyes, Dean grants the unspoken request and kisses him.  The angle is off, with Cas leaning back against him and twisting enough for their lips to meet, but Dean makes the most of it.  He plunges his tongue between Cas’ lips, stroking with the same steady rhythm of his hand.
He gets his answer almost immediately.
“He does alright.” Jo’s voice holds a note of teasing.  “He took Home Ec classes with me in highschool when we were dating.”
Maybe he’s being paranoid because he’s tired.  He’s been stifling yawns almost from the moment he arrived, and he’s starting to get that heavy-limbed sensation that always comes with lack of sleep.
“Can’t relate,” Dean grumbles.
“I thought he’d be with you,” Castiel says as he immediately turns back the way he came.  “But if he’s not here, I know where to look for him.”
“So, Mr. Jameson, we meet again.”
As if reading his mind, Sam continues.  “It nearly broke us apart.  But Dean’s a stubborn bastard.  He locked me up, got me clean.  It nearly killed me.” His next words are even more grim.  “After he was sure I would live, he hunted down Ruby and killed her with the demon killing knife she’d gifted us to gain our trust after she first crawled out of Hell.
It doesn’t seem prudent to address Dean’s fears about Sam at this time either.  Distraction is probably the best course, and he does have other questions.
“I think she’s decided we’re best friends,” Castiel mutters against the top of her head when she rubs it against his face.
“Raincheck on the movie?”
They’d had to start small, with weekly shopping trips to Crossroads, first on slow weekdays then on Saturday when the stores are the busiest.  Eventually they moved on to taking weekend trips to nearby cities, and they even spent a week in Denver in late summer.
Slowly, he drags Cas to a frenzied peak.  He delights in each desperate gasp, and high pitched whine.  Cas quivers in his arms, urgently bucking up into Dean’s touch, his hands clamped down on Dean’s thighs for leverage.  Dean feels the strain in every limb in his body. He’s at the brink, and Dean wants to feel Cas fall apart in his arms, even as his own body throbs with painful need.
It’s fear.  He’s dreaming.
And that’s something he’d very much like to do for Dean, if not for the sake of his own experiences.  “Well, thank you for taking the time to talk to me tonight.  I’m sorry I disturbed you, but I’ll let you get back to sleep now.”
Dean winces.  “Okay yeah, I wish you’d said something.  I would have tried harder to back off.”
Swallowing down his protests is physically painful.  “Okay. Whatever you want.”
And Alistair will play with more victims the way he did with Dean.  The way he did with Magda.
He remembers his father’s smile, and his laugh booming through the cabin.  The way he’d lifted Dean so high, and they put their heads together to whisper their excitement over the new baby in Mary’s arms.
“We’re almost there,” Dean says as the road begins to angle up and the truck’s engine revs harder as it begins to climb.  He flashes a grin at Castiel.  “This is the fun part.”
“We were raised in the life,” Sam says, and there’s an undercurrent of bitterness in the statement that leaves Castiel curious, but he’s too polite to ask.  “Our father taught us most of what we know.  We’ve met other hunters along the way, and some things we’ve had to figure out through trial and error.”
Sam nods.  “Although sometimes they’re the least of our worries.”
He should let him sleep.  And he will.  But he needs just a few more minutes.
He’s finally had his revenge, and he has the proof he needs--Alistair’s distinctive black steel revolver with the gleaming mother of pearl handle etched with notches.  One for each law man he’s claimed to have killed.  The men who had ridden with Alistair were dead as well.  It wasn’t the end of the Comancheros, but the largest band of them, and hopefully the rest of the demons, were gone now.
“Clothes off,” he murmurs into Gabriel’s mouth.
“Not yet,” Castiel says softly.
Dean chuckles, but doesn’t lift his head from Castiel’s shoulder.  “Well yeah.  You’re pretty hot, Cas.  And you just had my dick in your hands.  Gives a guy ideas, y’know.”
The bay doors are open wide, but only two of the three stalls are filled.  The Impala sits in the stall closest to the house, the back doors open, and Dean’s legs hanging out.
His mind races, looking for any way to escape the hell that’s waiting for him.  “I’d make a shitty suit with all these holes in me.”
“Terrifying?” Sam offers wryly.
He scuttles between them, faster than Dean expects someone so broken down to move.  He stops a few yards away and looks back expectantly.
Empathy coils in Dean’s chest as he watches Cas.  He recognizes the sense of loss and confusion, and the fear.  Especially the fear.  It’s been his constant companion since childhood.
Castiel practically glows with excitement.  “It’s my favorite show.”
Dean’s fever is out of control.  His skin is so hot and dry it seems to Castiel that there’s a furnace burning under his skin.  And he’s afraid.  He’s never been so afraid.
He really did.  There are plenty of tourists in the summer, but no one stays for long.  Everyone in Purgatory has had at least one fling with a vacationing rock climber, and Jo’s no exception.  He’s admired her choices of partners many times over the years, because she’s got damn good taste in men.  But he suspects that just like him, and everyone else who’s dallied with an out-of-towner, she’s probably tired of the revolving door to her bedroom and would much rather find someone to settle down with.
“Cas, get your ass down here and help us set up camp.”
Dean and Sam both swing around to look at him.  They’ve never asked him to take a shift guarding camp before.  Mostly because Dean’s relentless pace has kept the Pinkerton so exhausted that he usually falls asleep as soon as he’s out of the saddle.
know what I can handle.”
Sam doesn’t pause in his prowling, although he does throw a glare in Dean’s direction.  “This isn’t funny, Dean.”
“What the hell?”  Dean throws the blankets back and stands as he checks the system again.  When he still doesn’t show up in the bunker, he pings Cas directly.
“A pain in my ass is what he is,” Dean lifts a foot out of the water to scrub with a brush.  “Crazy sonuvabitch must have a death wish.”
Castiel’s body sags, but the visible signs of dejection disappear quickly and his chin comes up at a stubborn angle that makes Sam think Dean’s in for a shitload of trouble.  “If it comes to that, I won’t back down.”
And where is Dean?
Before he can escape, Amara hisses an insult in Spanish and jerks out of Dean’s hands.  She runs around the corner of the cabin and straight into Castiel, nearly knocking them both to the ground.  When she realizes who is steadying her, she angrily wipes tears from her eyes, twists out of his gentle hold and dashes back into the house.
But he doesn’t move.  His eyes are dark with lust, the green almost consumed by black as he watches Castiel intently.  After what feels like an eternity but is probably only the space of a few heartbeats, he begins to move.  He rocks his hips, forward and back, his own hard cock bobbing with each movement.
He hadn’t expected to stop at Dean’s right now, but it makes sense.  If Ash drops him off to the motel, he’ll have to either ask him the extra favor of helping him get his bike to the shop the next morning, or call for a tow if that’s even an available service around here.  His heartbeat kicks up at the idea of seeing Dean again so soon.
Baby snorts, which he takes as agreement.  He smiles and moves his scratching to her other ear.
Castiel laughs.  “It won’t be that bad.”
They do that a lot.  Sit so close that they’re almost in each other’s laps.  Even when they’re not seated, they stay close within each other’s space.  They touch, quite a lot actually, mostly brushes and nudges.  And sometimes they get caught up in each other’s eyes.  Which Dean is keenly aware of, because any time they have an audience for the eye-sex throats get cleared or snickers get badly muffled.  And when he catches himself doing it while they’re alone, he imagines leaning in and stealing a kiss.  Maybe more than one.
“Yeah?”
Castiel squints, and he’d probably do his little head tilty thing if Dean weren’t cupping his face.  “Mud isn’t clear at all, Dean.”
It’s a valid point, and Castiel concedes.  “I will be glad when my stim integration completes.”
He finds a rocky outcrop where he can sit down in the water while keeping Cas firmly in his lap.  Cas lifts his head and meets Dean’s gaze with hazy blue eyes.
Dean grabs his hand and guides it to his hip where the scars begin.  He presses Castiel’s hand against the warped skin, and feels Castiel’s gasp of surprise.  But Castiel only massages the flesh under his hands gently, undisturbed by the scar tissue itself.
“That’s not weird either, is it?” Dean fidgets with his coffee mug, turning it so the handle lines up with the edge of the table.
“He should have anyway.”  Truthfully, Sam would rather not have been disturbed.  Not in the middle of acrobatic sex that he still needs to wash off his skin, and definitely not in the aftermath.  Being pulled from a warm bed and the strong arms of his lover is not exactly his idea of a good way to wake up from a post orgasmic haze.
“God damn you,” he mutters.  “I won’t let you die.”
Castiel’s jaw tightens as Dean’s hand returns to his hip.  He tells himself he’s concentrating on the lesson, and not the sensations Dean’s hands rouse.  Dean leans in closer, his chin over Castiel’s shoulder, their hat brims brushing together.  Castiel can feel the heat of his body wrapping around him, smell the essence of sun and leather, and the tang of copper.  The latter shouldn’t be arousing, but Castiel is beginning to fear that his body will soon show signs of how it’s affected by the aura of danger Dean exudes.
bad luck.  I’ve driven through here thousands of times.”
have.”
,” Dean corrects.
Dean immediately guides his horse away, starting on the long trek to their destination.  Castiel sits frozen, watching Dean’s shoulders shift with the darkly spotted horse’s movements.
The sensation of being watched intensifies and Castiel takes a deep breath.  He needs to remain calm.  His life depends on it.
“You know,” he says, “no one’s paying attention to us anymore if you want to slip out.”
He sets the phone on the dryer while he goes back to his search for the first aid kit.  His phone buzzes again just as he finds it.
Charlie looks to Sam in question.  “Really?  Is he ill?  Do we need to upgrade his nanite implant with an app to help with erectile dysfunction?”
“You’re larger than I am,” Castiel points out.
“Sorry.” And he really is.  Having that look directed at him feels goddamn awful.  Worse than when Sam does it, because Dean’s mostly inured to his little brother.  “It didn’t seem important at the time.  But I promise to show you soon.”
As they ride throughout the afternoon his skin crawls at the eerie sensation of being watched.  He almost wishes they would just attack already, but he knows Dean is likely right that they will wait until the cover of night.
Someone without sense enhancements probably wouldn’t notice it, even with their face pressed against the back of the android’s neck like Dean’s currently is, another sign of the Castiel’s quality manufacturing.  Even he only catches it occasionally.  It should be weird, and it was the first time he noticed it, but it’s unique to Castiel like Dean’s own miasma of bodily odors.  It’s just a part of who he is, and the scent curls in Dean’s sinuses, making him hum and nose in closer.
Dean sighs.  “Sam--”
Before he can see more, the door is slammed in his face.  He hears the distinct sound of a heavy crossbar being dropped into place.  He’s locked inside.
Castiel nods.  “It has even happened when you are not present, when I am reviewing memory files you are included in.”
What he feels right now is big.  Almost too big.  And he wonders if that should send him screaming for the hills.
Ash leans back and slaps Dean on the back with a carefree laugh, unaffected by the clear warning of danger.  “I’m just messin’ with you, Dean-o!  Don’t get your panties in a twist.”  To Castiel he adds “He doesn’t dance, amigo.  And trust me, if you’d seen the things I’ve witnessed, you’d never ask him to.”
The tracks that rise from the bottom of the gorge disappear among the rocks.
“Like I said, he’ll get there.” Sam grimaces.  “It’s going to be rough though.”
“Yeah, I’m good.”  His voice modulates oddly, in a way Castiel hasn’t heard before.
Dean slips into the bedroom and comes out wearing Castiel’s leather jacket.  It looks good on him despite being a little bit short in the sleeves.  Dean tucks his hands in the pockets and pulls out a ring of keys.  “I assume the house key’s on here?”  When Castiel confirms with a nod, Dean snaps them back into his palm and shoves his hand back in the pocket.  He pointedly doesn’t look at Hannah as he steps into Castiel’s personal space and gives him a soft kiss.  His eyes are serious when he lifts his head.  “I’ve got my phone on me.  Text me.”
“Touch yourself, Cas.”
Sam’s lips pull up in a smirk.  “Don’t worry, you don’t have to see him all the time now that you know we’re ‘official’.” He’s been hanging around Cas too much, because he uses air quotes like it’s a thing normal people do and not a quirk of perpetually confused robots.  “He prefers his place anyway.”
Castiel obeys, and Dean tilts his head enough to watch the head of his cock slip in and out of his hand.  “Good.  A little faster now.”  He increases his own strokes.  “Follow my rhythm.”
Dean huffs an almost laugh.  “Yeah, pretty much.”  He checks the load and the safety, and turns it handle first to Castiel.  “This is in case shit hits the fan.  And don’t shoot one of us, alright?”
“Do you feel like talking about what set you off this time?”
“Oh, we are going to play with this first,” Castiel says, smug as a well fed cat.
“Should you be working this much?” Castiel asks from right at Dean’s shoulder, making him jump again and spin to face him.  Dude is stealthy as fuck.  “My understanding of human anatomy is limited to providing sexual pleasure, but my BDSM database has a subcategory on aftercare and it indicates that rest is important after stressing the body past its usual limits.”
His body feels like a tightly wound spring, twisting tighter with each firm stroke.
Castiel smiles as Dean nuzzles into the comforter.  He does not suffer the same discomfort from what Dean claims are subpar motel mattresses, but he does have to hear Dean’s nightly complaints and deal with his tossing and turning.  If he had to actually go into sleep mode to charge anymore, Dean’s restlessness would also affect Castiel.
“Very good,” he says.  “We’ll leave in the morning.”
Castiel shoves half the tortilla in his mouth, and hurries into the other room.  He hurries to undress and slips into the tub.  He winces as the warm water meets the sore flesh across his back, and he sinks deeper to soak the welts.  The heat begins to ease the pain after a few minutes, and then he proceeds to scrub himself thoroughly.  Twice.  Ellie brings him clean clothing and shaving supplies, and by the time he’s finished, he feels human again.
“Oh man, not again,” one of the humans sighs.  “Mr. Novak, you can’t bring your toys through here.  You know it sets the big guy off.”
“I appreciate it.”
I hope the weekend is warm, safe, and happy, whether you celebrate Christmas or not <3
The subject didn’t come up during dinner, but Castiel assumes Sam didn’t want to give him something to think about too hard after spending the day in bed with a migraine.  “Well I'm definitely interested, if the offer is on the table.”
“I’m glad to hear it,” Castiel signs, smiling.
“Yeah, your new socks’ll be fine.”  The comment gets him a few strange looks from people close enough to hear as they pass, but he ignores them and heads for the bar at the back.
“And falling on my face would hurt like a bitch, so my point still stands.”  Dean wraps his arm around Castiel’s waist, but leaves his grip loose enough that Castiel has to do most of the work of balancing by himself.  “Cybernetics and medical nanites can fix it, but there’s no reason to put them through all that work.”
Sam cackles.  “He’s right!”
“Do you think it worked?” he demands.
“I’d rather avoid cleaning masticated food out,” Castiel confirms.  “But liquids are fine.  I actually need to ingest water to facilitate cooling my internal systems.  Plus it keeps my mouth functional.” He sticks out his tongue and runs his finger down the center, then holds the digit towards Dean to show the tip now glistening with moisture.  “Lubrication is important.”
Castiel sniffs at the skunky air of the cabin, and smirks.  “Yeah I get it.”
Decision made, he surges to his feet and approaches the door separating the rooms.  Just as he reaches it he hear’s Pamela speak.  “Relax, would ya?  Stop acting like you’re gonna hustle outta here any minute.
“Gabe, wake up, I have news.”
Castiel does as he’s told, hitting the cactus at middle height and right in the center of its trunk.  When Dean tells him to shoot other targets, he follows along, hitting everything Dean points out to him, no matter how quickly he shouts out commands.
At some point in their lives, there had been people who taught the brothers a sense of compassion, kindness, and decency.
When he feels like he’s not going to come apart at the seams if he moves, Dean lifts his head off the pillow and opens his eyes, he finds Castiel staring down with intense concentration at where their bodies are connected.  His lips are parted around gasping breathes, and he looks as wrecked as Dean feels.
There’s a moment of silence that sends fear tingling down Castiel’s spine.
He puts it on speaker and sets it on his chest.  One ring, two rings.  Three--
The truck slows, and Dean pulls onto a side rode that Castiel wouldn’t have noticed from the highway.  It’s narrow, just barely wide enough for two vehicles to pass, and there are no lines painted on the ragged asphalt.  The road is poorly maintained, lined with washboard ridges that shake the truck hard enough that Castiel is afraid his teeth might rattle loose.
He says nothing to Cas, but communicates that it’s time to go by pulling himself into Baby’s saddle.  Cas mounts up as well, and they ride side by side towards the mountains.
Castiel shakes his head.  “I don’t.”
“But…” Even as he starts to protest, he thinks of the small stores of food he’d seen when helping Alfie cook.  And the gaping cracks in the walls that won’t seal in any warmth.  It’s true, this place will not protect them from a heavy winter storm.
He bends to pick it up.  Large, block print boldly spells out WANTED--DEAD OR ALIVE across the top.  Below that were once the likeness and names of four men, along with the chilling account of their crimes.  The paper is torn, the images of two men ripped away.  He stares down at it for a long moment before carefully tearing away the likeness of Dale Guthrie.
Tears.  He’s crying.  How
“When Dean’s feeling better you should ask him to rig you up a car charger for long days away from the bunker,” Sam says with a grin.
“I’m good,” Dean responds simply.  He doesn’t want to give Castiel a reason to get mother-hen-hovery so soon after his recovery from the vamp blood.  And there’s nothing wrong with him that a meal and a good night’s sleep won’t cure.  “Just glad to be home.”
Castiel’s fingers curl into fists.  He takes a deep breath and lets it out slowly.  He’s never had a temper, but Winchester brings it out in him in spades.  “I see no reason to change my clothing.” He gestures to his coat, vest, and striped trousers. “My clothing is serviceable for riding--”
“You can change into something you bought if you want to,” Krissy offers Castiel once the exchange is complete.
“Where’s Dean?” Sam asks as soon as he sees Castiel.
The familiar anger that comes when Dean defies him bubbles up.  He arches over Dean and grabs the tattered remains of his shirt.  “Don’t you dare die on me, you son of a bitch,” he snarls into Dean’s slack face.
The rest of it is the staff.  He grins and waves at the familiar blonde waitress working behind the bar, and then points to a booth near the back wall.  When she nods, he detours, pulling Castiel along behind him.  They settle in the booth, and Dean watches Castiel’s reaction to the place.
“Well you know how small town life is.  Things are as boring as ever here.  The biggest news is that Sam’s been able to leave the house, which is good for Eileen.  She doesn’t have to deal with his giant moose ass climbing the walls anymore.”
“I know,” Castiel soothes.  “Just rest.”
Now, with Cas, that deeper need surfaces, overriding everything but this one.  To lose himself in the oblivion of Cas’ passion.  To maybe purge himself of the devils always hiding just below his skin, and perhaps ease some of the pain of loneliness that he’s carried with him for so long.
His excuse is that he’s been traveling so much for the last few years, that he’d like to reacquaint himself with the city of Denver.  But his real reasoning is that there is less here to remind him of his time with Dean.  He still spends far too much time thinking about the ex-outlaw, and he hasn’t yet learned how to control his thoughts.
Castiel huffs out an annoyed “I have to take this,” and pulls out from under Dean’s arm.  He pulls the phone out and answers it as he makes his way down the hall, and his greeting sounds frustrated and curt before he slips through one of the doors.
Seeming to realize he’s got an audience, Dean coughs and straightens.  He turns a disgusted glare on the bulky android that delivered Castiel’s new parts.  “What are we going to do with this guy?”
“Nothing, just…” Castiel squeezes his thigh again.  “I’m glad my bike broke down.”
“Of course I am.  They belong to him, and he wants to trade them for money,” Gabriel says as he spins away from the counter, taking the box with him.  He turns just enough to wink in Castiel’s direction, out of Aaron’s sight.  He knows Castiel is human, but apparently he’s decided it’s not worth trying to convince the younger man otherwise.  “I’m sure he’s going to spend at least some of it on a huge surprise for Dean, right Castiel?”
He knew Cas had been just as embarrassed as he was.  Even in the meager light Dean could see how dark Cas’ cheeks had turned.  But he’d remained cool and calm, just like ice on a frosty morning. Except for those blue eyes.  There’d been nothing frosty about them.
Doesn’t think at all.  Just feels.
Anything Castiel might say to that flies right out of his head when Dean’s pole jerks out of the makeshift stand Sam had made for it out of rocks.  Sam drops his own pole and lunges for Deans, catching it before it can get dragged any further and lost in the water.
A long table takes up most of the space in the middle of the cabin.  Dried food is crusted on the metal plates littering the surface, and scraps lay about on the floor.  Several bedrolls rest against the far wall, a stack of animal skins fill one corner, and a pile of blankets in another.  A single window is covered with a rawhide skin.
But Dean doesn’t even give him half of one.  He closes his arms around Castiel and pulls him against his chest.  “You don’t have to pretend, Cas. Let go and give in to the fear. You’re entitled to it.”
That earns him a soft laugh.  “I would advise against it.  I’m not sure how many of them are demons.”
It’s too much.  Too goddamn much.  All of Dean’s considerable willpower crumbles and he moves into Castiel’s personal space and cups a hand around the back of his neck, pulling him in for the kiss Dean has wanted to plant on him since he’d found him in the library.  There’s no finesse, just a mashing of lips, but it’s a relief to channel some of his fond adoration into actions since words are not really his thing.
“So do I,” Cas growls.
“I’m from Philadelphia, actually.” Cas chuckles at Dean’s surprise.  “Fancier than you thought, hm?  And yes, I also have experience with animals.  We were wealthy enough to keep horses for riding, and our aunt who raised us insisted we learn because it was ‘proper exercise for gentlemen’.”
“Sorry I worried you,” Dean says as the sunlight creeps across the lawn and toward the porch.  “Didn’t think I’d be out here so long.”
“Do you use toys or anything?” Castiel asks.  His hands disappear from Dean’s skin, but Dean’s dismay over that turns to eagerness when Castiel starts removing the last of his clothes.
Relief makes him sink deeper into the firm reality of Castiel’s arms, and enjoy the heat of Castiel’s palms on his bare back.  He closes his eyes and forces back the relieved tears burning his--thankfully intact--eyes.  They need to get moving.  To restrain Doc Psycho, and to find Sam, probably put a bullet or three in Martin, and free the other prisoners while they’re at it.  But it can all wait one goddamn minute while he relishes the actual physical presence of his boyfriend.  And the fact that he hasn’t been dismembered and put in random piles around the undercity to feed the ghouls.
“I miss you too,” Castiel sighs.  He sounds tired.  “I miss Purgatory.  How is everyone?”
Their life here is so idyllic that Castiel sometimes forgets they have reasons to have nightmares at all.  He also suffers through his own psychological scars in slumber, and while most of the time he prefers to ride out the heartache and terror in Dean’s embrace, sometimes he needs time and space to process things on his own.
“I have a bad feeling about this,” Sam says.
“Damn you, Dean Winchester,” he curses under his breath.  Somehow he
Which is weird as hell, but he’s lived too long with the knowledge of non-humans to judge Castiel for not being made of flesh and bone.  And if Castiel is really a sentient AI, then he’s just as much a person as a werewolf or a lucid ghoul.
Way beyond ready, Dean relaxes with an exhale, and Castiel slips two fingers inside him with ease.
Once the fire is lit, Sam breaks the comfortable silence they’d fallen into.  “I suppose you’re wondering what that was all about.”
Dean turns his head and levels Castiel with a glare.  “You’re kidding, right?  All your fancy programming, and you don’t know?”
“You’re afraid of flying?” Jo asks.  “But you’ve been on the other side of the planet.  Did they let you take a rowboat?”
The brothers are silent as he scans the first few pages.  What he finds makes his jaw go slack.
When Sam’s face lights up at the mention of Jack, it illuminates some of the darker corners of Dean’s heart.  “He’s here?”
“It’s a symbol of protection,” Dean answers.  “Everyone in my family gets one.  It’s tradition.”
There’s a phone in the garage, but he doesn’t want to have this conversation in front of Jo, so he heads into the house to use his personal line.  His decision is made as soon as the phone in his hand, so he doesn’t hesitate over dialing Castiel’s number.
Castiel realizes he’s clenching his teeth when a sharp pain zings through the back of his jaw.
The kissing eventually slows down, and after one last soft peck that leans dangerously into
With Dean finally resting, Castiel searches the cabin.  He finds another clean shirt that is his size, then goes looking for anything else useful that they can take with them when they leave.  He finds several boxes of rifle shells, matches, tins of dried food.  As Dean said, there definitely isn’t enough food to last the winter here.  At most, it’s only a place to rest the horses before heading deeper into Mexico.
“We’ll lose him.  He went down this alley.”
Cas murmurs something and shifts in Dean’s arms.  Dean holds him tighter, with the excuse that he doesn’t want to drop him, and ignores how good it feels to have Cas’ head pillowed on his shoulder.
“You okay, Cas?” Sam asks, cupping a large hand around his elbow.
“Ugh, at least put up a sound barrier so you don’t disturb your neighbors,” Charlie groans.
Castiel chuckles and nods to concede that Dean scored a point.  “Yeah, I’ve got them.”  He doubts he’ll need them.  Cooler weather always means fewer headaches.  But he keeps them with him now, just in case.  Especially since it seems to give Dean peace of mind.
“Eh, compadres!” he calls in a lisping, nasally voice.  “It’s about time you arrived.”
“I’ll be back in a moment,” Castiel says, deciding that answering nature’s call will be more prudent than becoming embroiled in a verbal sparring match.
Dean releases his death grip on the steering wheel and reaches across the seat to pat Castiel’s thigh.  “Happy to do it,” he says, with complete honesty.
This time Castiel sees that he keeps his arm low, aiming as soon as the gun is free instead of lifting it and sighting along his arm.  “And how do I do that?”
“Hm maybe,” Gabriel breathes against Sam’s lips, “we should skip the meeting and just fuck like bunnies till the queen comes looking for us.”
“Thank you for the visit, Cousin,” Charlie says, back fully in character as The Queen.  “You’ll keep me updated on your progress?”
Dean’s freckles disappear under his blush, and he dips his head to break away from Castiel’s gaze.  But even as he looks away, he leans into Castiel’s palm. Objectively there’s nothing different about his appearance other than the flush of extra blood under his skin, but subjectively Castiel finds him even more aesthetically pleasing in that moment.  It would be an entertaining exercise to analyze his reaction and determine the cause, but he’ll save it for a quiet night when he’s unable to sleep.
Instead, Dean had offered him comfort.  Simple words;
When Sam sniggers, Dean sends a splash of soapy water in his direction.  “Shut up, bitch.”
Shaking his head, Sam casts a significant look around them.  There isn’t anyone within earshot on the dusty road, but he seems nervous about the townsfolk anyway.  “Later.  When we’re somewhere safe.”
, he thinks.
“Dude’s got good taste in music at least,” Dean mutters.
and he wants to understand before he acts on his impulses.  What makes Dean different?  The conflicting signals lock up his limbs, forcing his hands down to his sides, and rooting his feet to the floor.
“Very well, we’ll need the usual background information.  What can you tell me about the person you’re looking for?”
“And you aren’t?” His grin is unrepentant.  But there’s a hitch in his breath, and Castiel knows he isn’t as unaffected as he’s trying to act.
“Admit it, Wyatt, you’re more upset over the money than that we’ve also had a few nights with Pamela.”
“C’mon, Cas, don’t tell me you don’t know what a yawn is.”
“Good, eh?  Real chocolate.”  Gabriel shoves half a cookie in his own mouth and chews for a moment before talking with his mouth full.  “So wha’ happened?”
Suspicion niggles at the back of Sam’s mind, and it’s almost too crazy to think about.  Artificial Intelligence--
His conviction strengthens.  After seeing the destruction Alistair leaves in his wake, Castiel is more convinced than ever that the demon needs to be stopped.
The reminder isn’t necessary.  Chuck had warned them before they’d started, and again while they watched the tank of nanites build Castiel’s new body from what seemed like nothing, and once more when they placed Castiel’s freshly grown body in the hospital bed he’s occupied since.  Dean’s not sure why everyone keeps telling him, since he’s not asking anymore.
“Yes, well you’re not the only hunter that brings us strays.  And now some of them have married and started breeding,” Cesar says dryly.
It’s the first time his body has responded in such a way that he actually welcomes it, and that runs so contrary to his normal thought process that he stops after that one step.  He wants to keep moving.  He wants to reach out and pull Dean close.  But he doesn’t know
He throws his stuff on the chair in the corner of the room and settles down on the bed, sighing in relief when the weight comes off his ankle.  After staring at the ceiling for a few minutes, he digs his cell phone out of his pocket.  His thumb brushes over the keys on the simple prepaid phone several times before he takes a deep breath and punches in one of the many numbers he’s been avoiding for a long time.
With one hand gripping Castiel’s hip tight to guide his movements, Dean wiggles his other hand between their bodies.  He fumbles at the cloth separating them until he has them both pulled free and sliding together skin to skin.  Castiel refuses to give him enough room to get them both completely naked, but Dean’s okay with it.  Once he has the kind of friction he wants, he wraps a hand over the back of Castiel’s neck to pull him into another kiss.  The muscles under his other hand flex and clench, and Dean digs his fingers into the meat of Castiel’s ass to encourage him to speed up his movements.
The room is small and kind of dingy, but it’s private.  And the shower
But even the worst wouldn’t have mattered to him.  He would take Dean Winchester as he was.  Still, it would matter to Dean, and Castiel rejoices that his body remains whole.
The hand tracing circles on Dean’s back goes still.  Castiel shifts until they’re both on their sides, face to face, with Dean’s head still pillowed on his bicep.  “You don’t need to thank me.”
Pasting on his for-the-camera smile he lifts his beer in a toast to Rachel and her circle of girlfriends.  “Have a good evening, ladies.”
Castiel is slumped forward in the saddle of the demon-possessed Comanchero.  They have been riding since early dawn, and now, as their pace slows, he looks up through his matted lashes.  Another mountain rises before the;m, all jagged peaks and hard granite.
The android’s earnest expression prompts a grin out of Dean.  “You’re a smart one, Cas.”
This is all speculation of course.  He has no intention of visiting Boston any time soon.  Purgatory is as good of a place as any to continue to avoid his problems.
Dean watches as Cas scoots past him and snuggles into the blankets he’d just abandoned.  “Pleasant dreams, Cas.”
If Sam wasn’t crippled, Dean would already have asked him to go.  “Maybe,” Dean repeats.  “I’ll think about it, Sammy.”
When he doesn’t say anything, Dean huffs and the unhappy twist of his lips softens into something closer to a smile.  “Fifteen minutes.  I’ll come find you, or you send out the cavalry.”
She’s ecstatic to hear from him, which makes him feel even more guilty.  But like everyone else, she refuses his apologies, tearfully insisting that she’s glad he’s safe and sound and that’s all that matters.  It doesn’t feel like a lie this time when he promises to keep in more frequent contact.
It has nothing to do with the fact that he’s stayed in his condo long enough to start leaving his belongings around without putting them away, or the fact that the sheets no longer smell musty from disuse.  It has everything to do with the hard body draped over him, keeping him warmer than any down comforter could.  Strong arms hold him tight, long legs tangle with his own, and when he shifts he feels the hair on Dean’s calves catch against his own.
“Thank you for your help,” Castiel says.  “I’m Castiel.”
Before he can decide what to do, Dean’s wild mutterings change.  A sheen of sweat breaks out over his body, dampening his hair and the sheets.  The muscles in his arms and across his chest twitch and contort.  His fingers curl into fits.  He reaches out in one moment, and tries to protect himself in the next.  Over and over he calls for Sam--Sammy.  Begging for help, for mercy… for death.
Dean gives in first, muttering “I’ll do it for now.”
“Only if we have to,” Dean admits gravely.  “But the government won’t admit that it’s even a problem, and while they’re sitting on their thumbs people are out there dying.  Someone’s gotta do something.”
“Charlie told me about your bet,” Dean blurts.
“Of course, Dean.” Maybe a handjob in the shower wouldn’t be too vigorous for Dean if he’s immediately going to bed afterward….
He pings Dean’s neural net to let him know he’s leaving, and gets back a vid of Castiel in the library flipping through an old book, with the tag
“Well I appreciate that you’re thinking about me,” Dean says, completely sincere.  “But you know how hard it is to find someone to date in a small town.  Especially when you like men.”  He pulls a rag from his pocket and tries to wipe away some of the oil on his fingers.  “That’s one thing I miss about living in the city sometimes.  Much easier to meet people.”
“Well, what I did wasn’t illegal back then, but I’ve been charged with war crimes as a result of my work.” Chuck takes a deep breath, and meets Castiel’s gaze steadily.  “You’re not the first AI I’ve ever created, although you were definitely an accident. After the first one, I put in layers and layers of extra security to keep my creations dumbed down.  Virtual Intelligences only, so I wouldn’t draw attention. I probably should have stopped programming intelligent interactive software altogether, but I could never really stop.” He wiggles his fingers near his temple.  “Messy gray matter up here wouldn’t stop drowning me in ideas.”
Without pausing for thought, Castiel reaches for the button of his jeans.  He’s already made his decision about how he wants his relationship with Dean to go, and he sees no reason to hesitate over physical intimacy.  It
Which is plenty of time for disaster to strike.  “I’m just going to check up on him.”
Castiel’s shoulders actually lift in a small shrug.  It’s stiff, like he’s trying it out for the first time.  “It seems a noble pursuit. To protect those who cannot protect themselves.”
“Yeah, good job on ‘em,” the other guard says on a laugh, gesturing at Sam and Dean.  “But not good enough to fool Uriel over here.”
Dean’s eyes widen, and his mouth starts to water.  His mood instantly improves tenfold.  Anxiety? What anxiety?  “Cas, have I ever told you that you’re the man of my dreams?”
Castiel nods, and Dean kisses his ear as a reward.
“I’ll wear it for you if you put on the Han Solo costume.”
Castiel is immediately aware that he’s succeeded in bringing back the anger between them.  He heard it first in the hissing fury of Dean’s voice and then in his use of Castiel’s last name after he’d been stubbornly insisting on calling him “Cas”.
Two men work behind the bar, supplying a steady flow of expensive whiskey and cheap conversation.  The closest looks up from drying a glass and eyes Castiel.  “What’ll it be, mister?”
Castiel chuckles weakly.  “That’s an accurate description.”
“Thanks, Cas,” he says softly.
“Yes, really.” He laughs.  “He also says you’re his friend.”
“I know,” Dean’s mouth moves over his, then to his ear.  “Let it happen, Castiel… just let it happen.”
“You’ll get there.”
He sets his fries down, despite his gnawing hunger.  “You mean Dean?”
Instead of reaching out, Dean moves the bucket near Castiel’s knees then lies back down but with his head on Castiel’s thigh instead of the pillow.  He tilts his head back enough to look up at Castiel.  “Is this okay?”
“You’re either a liar,” Dean murmurs,  “Or you’re just as bad as they are, and you like to see me suffer.”
The brick and mortar are bones, exoskeletons.  The humans, animals, and other fleshy creatures living inside them no different than the microbes and nanites milling around in Dean’s body.  The City breathes in oxygen and breathes out carbon dioxide.  It feeds on sunlight and all the resources the planet has to offer, and shits out garbage.
“Let’s go down to the gun range.”
It’s much more comfortable speaking with Samuel.  He doesn’t exude any hostility toward Castiel.
That earns him a bright laugh, as Dean’s head tips back on his shoulders.  He pats Castiel’s calf to let him know he’s done.  “I don’t know ‘bout you, but now I’m in the mood for a Star Wars marathon.”
“She was born to one of the mares given to my father by the Nez Percé when he helped them destroy a monster that had been terrorizing their tribe.  And when they were forced off their land, the chief was afraid the horses wouldn’t do well in the reservations.  He gave Pa enough breeding stock to start his own herd.  Pa promised he would keep the bloodline true.” Dean’s voice grew quiet.  “But he died and wasn’t able to keep that promise.”
“I love you too,” he rasps in between kisses, again and again, repeating himself while Castiel groans against his mouth.
He limps around the other side of the shed.  The gunfire has stopped, and after a few moments of silence, Dean slips out of cover and heads for the cabin.  Halfway across the yard, a voice freezes him in his tracks.
Castiel presses his lips together, and his irises spin to the left then to the right.  Then he lifts his other hand and cups it around the back of Dean’s neck.  The last thing Dean sees of Castiel’s expression before he’s being guided back down to Castiel’s dick, is a soft smile.
She grins slyly.  “Sure do, honey.”
Outside the room, Sam nearly runs right into Dean.
“Wait, the founder of Angel Industries?” Sam asks incredulously.  “
Cas nibbles at his bottom lip, the only sign that he’s unnerved by the warning.  “That’s not why I carry it with me.”
Black Eyes goes still, his eyes wide with alarm.  “Are you sure?”
“It’s not about flying,” Dean says, and he smiles a little when Sam’s eyebrows pop up in surprise.  “I’ve got agoraphobia… it’s already hard leaving my comfort zone.  Flying across the country to a place I’ve never been scares the hell out of me.”
It’s surrounded on three sides by an unusual cluster of large rocks, so there’s only one way anyone can approach, should someone decide to pay a visit during the night.  He’d recognized its potential safety when Dean had chosen the spot to stop, even as he’d argued that they continue their journey.  Outside the circle of boulders, the desert stretches out seemingly forever in most directions, with the mountains looming dark to the south.
Castiel falls silent, unwilling to raise his voice over the noise to discuss such an uncomfortable subject.  Only the rumble of the truck’s tires and the indistinct music from the radio fill the cab for the next ten minutes until Dean pulls off onto a dirt road.  It’s full of potholes and rocks, but the ride is quieter.  They also slow down considerably.  The truck has no problems with the ruts and bumps, but Dean still takes each obstacle carefully.
Resisting the urge to physically push Cas away, Dean releases his shirt.  Cas’ fingers are slow to drop away from his wrist, and Dean misses his touch immediately.
“Yes.” Castiel grins.  “But maybe not so hot.”
When she swings her muzzle up and tries to nip Castiel’s arm, he moves quickly, pushing her head away, firmly but gently.  She looks at him again with new curiosity.
When his stomach growls, he recalculates.  He’ll whine like a little bitch if there’s not coffee already brewing.
If Dean unfocuses his eyes, he can almost perceive the edges of Castiel’s true form.  Just the colors alone give him a headache though, and he blinks, focusing on the man standing in front of them with his head ducked like he’s expecting a scolding.
“Trust me,” Ellen says in a serious tone, even as her eyes twinkle with mischief, “We
Dean blinks, turning his focus outward and settling his gaze on his brother.  “Yeah, no shit.” He closes the file, but keeps a copy of it to go back over later.  “So you think Castiel is a case?”
Talking isn’t what he wants to do at all, but refusing the invitation would be rude.  He won’t repay the hospitality he’s received in that way.
He turns in time to see Castiel connect the power to his batteries.  The change is instant.  Castiel sits up straight and his movements resume normal human speeds.
Castiel watches him for signs that he might need to vomit again, but his cheeks are still flushed with color instead of the pale white that preceded each instance of illness.  Since he seems alright for the moment, Castiel reaches for the fly of his jeans.
Shaking his head, he tries to focus on better memories.  The soft gold light as it reflected off his mother’s yellow hair, and the sound of her singing hymns while she moved about the kitchen.  The way her fingers felt in his hair when she ruffled it playfully and told him to behave so the angels watching over him could take a little break.
James half-smile morphs into a confused squinty frown, and Castiel wonders if what he’s experiencing right now is the same thing Dean has described as “uncanny valley”.  He looks back and forth between the brothers.  “What?  Castiel’s a sexbot.  He isn’t programmed to want anything except a good fuck.”
“We could at least ask him first,” Sam points out.  “What if he thinks we’re trying to escape?”
“Cas…” Dean gasps as his prostate is nailed
Dean’s eyes are drawn to the movement of Castiel’s muscles under his thin t-shirt.  Whoever built the synthetic biceps and pecs and abs did a damn fine job.  “It’s from a really old movie.  There’s an android who takes everything way too literally named C-3PO.”
I'm trying to use NaNo to finish this, since I have about 50k left.  This may or may not result in delays or faster posting.  It depends on if I feel like editing after all that writing :)
That actually earns him a small smile.  “I’ll take my chances,” Dean says dryly.  Sam snorts, and moves to the water to refill all their canteens while Dean teaches Cas whatever lesson he has planned.  Apparently he’s not too worried about Dean ending up with new holes in his hide either.
The uncertainty in his voice brings Dean’s head up, and he finds Castiel staring at him with worried eyes.
He’s quiet for a long moment, and when he speaks again, Castiel is reminded of their night up by the hot springs.  When he’d talked for the first time about his injuries.  “Therapist says it’s agoraphobia.”
Unable to deny a direct request, Dean opens his eyes, and his vision is filled with blue.  Cas is close enough that Dean would only need to move a few inches to kiss him.  More tears spill over when he sees the sorrow in Cas’ wide eyes.
Dean isn’t certain whether he hears it first or feels it, a distant rumbling that seems to seep up through the ground beneath him and churn through the cold air above him.  Having lived on instinct for so long, he is immediately on his feet and shedding the oilcloth slicker he’d wrapped around himself when the rain first began.
Before he can work out the best course of action, a nearby door opens and Dean sticks his head out.  Despite the potential serious consequences of his inaction, Castiel takes precious seconds to examine his appearance.  His hair is flattened on one side, and spiked haphazardly on the other, and his cheek has red pressure lines along the skin.  The green-gold of his irises are hidden behind his lashes because he’s squinting at them as if the hallway light is too intense for his eyes.
He hesitates as he moves further from camp, uncertain of the terrain in the dim illumination of the half moon floating just above the horizon.  But everything is flat, unlike the rolling hills they’d left behind the day before.  The only exceptions being the unexpected rock formations they passed occasionally, and the wide gully of the river at his back.
Scooting forward on the seat to make room for Castiel to join him, Dean tries not to look as eager as he feels.  “C’mon, Cas.  Hop on.”
Hands explore, and limbs tangle together.  It’s too soon for either of them to come again, but they still tease and caress until Castiel’s skin buzzes with low grade arousal.
Castiel is dragged from the saddle and shoved to the floor inside a crudely built, one room cabin.  The dirt floor is cold and hard against his aching knees.  There are places in the walls where he can see fading daylight trickle through gaps where mud caulking had dried and crumbled.
But how foolish is it to leave with Dean in his present condition?  With that bullet in his leg, it will only get worse.  The question is whether they can make it down without killing him anyway.
He forgets all about Castiel’s threat until he comes in a few days later to find his desk plastered with post-its of all different colors.  They cover the monitor and the keyboard and his Cisco phone.  The whole tiny surface of his desk is covered in a rainbow of little flaps of paper.  They’re even all over his chair, even down to the wheels.
The tip of a knife protrudes from his throat.  Yellow light flickers under the skin around it.
Thinking of how hot it still is outside, Castiel chuckles.  “If they even have winter here.”
Cas is already striding for the horses.  Dean knows exactly what he’s thinking.  With a curse, he springs up and goes after Cas, grabbing him by the arm just as Cas reaches for the gelding’s bridle.  “Only a fool would set out after dark, Cas.”
“Yeah it’s not the greatest.” Dean slides over on the bench to give Castiel space.  “Join me?”
He hadn’t been exaggerating when he told Dean about his strained relationship with his father, but he still loves the old man.  Castiel pushed himself hard to please Michael Milton, and even now he craves every scrap of approval he can earn from him.
Another thing Dean wonders if Cas picked up from Sam.
He’s not going to let Dean Winchester win this battle of wills, no matter how broken he feels at the moment.  At this point he’s already invested too much time and energy in the man, and it would be a waste to shoot him in the back and leave him for the vultures.
“Fuck, Cas look at you,” Dean breathes and then his eyes squeeze shut and he comes in hot stripes over Castiel’s cheeks and mouth.
Once he’s in Crossroads finding his truck is quick and easy, since there’s only a couple department stores on Main Street to search.  His truck doesn’t stick out among all the other jacked up rock climbers that everyone and their dog owns out here, but Castiel had parked it out in the emptiest part of the lot.  He probably moved it there with the last of his energy, so that he wouldn’t have to deal with the sound of other engines starting up all around him.
“No shit.  Next time you see your boyfriend, smack him for me.”
Dean turns his head, giving Castiel a glimpse of glazed eyes, red lips.  “You’re a bastard,” he pants.
He’s confronted criminals of all kinds; bank robbers, thieves, even murderers.  Lowlife scum lurking in back allies, swindlers who rob people of their most precious possessions, and coldly emotionless scoundrels who would easily cut a person’s throat for a pouch of gold dust.  And a few
“You hungry?” he asks once he’s sort of dressed.
“Dean, do you want to have sex?”
“Looked like it to him,” Dean explains.  They’ve reached the part of the city where he can take control of his car, so he disengages the auto drive and turns down the highway that will take them home.  “I’m surprised he didn’t kill you, to be honest. If I hadn’t woken up when I did, he probably would have.”
customers!  At the same time!
Cupping Dean’s cheek, he leans in to kiss him.  It’s gentle and chaste, but Dean inhales sharply when their lips touch.
Small towns are quiet.  No traffic, very few voices unless one visits the Roadhouse around mealtimes or at sundown when it becomes the local watering hole.  Sometimes the loudest thing a person hears all day is the buzz of electricity, or the hiss of wind kicking sand up against walls.
“Oh that’s much better,” Eileen says without looking up.  “Thank you.”
She sighs dramatically.  “Homework,” she says glumly.  “I’d been putting it off to the last minute.”
Benny straightens from his crouch next to Boris, who is still as a corpse.  He holds out the flask full of blood to Castiel and gives him a crooked grin.  “You did good for a first time hunt, Castiel.  Taking down a full blooded vampire ain’t no easy thing.”
Dean scoffs.  “Easy for you to say, Cas.  You’re immune to the cold.  I, on the other hand, will freeze to death without at least five layers.”
“You know her better than I do,” Castiel points out.  He rubs a hand up and down Dean’s side, and says carefully, “but I think she might be… jealous.”
“Get the sheriff!” Castiel urges.
Castiel and Dean step apart, allowing Sam and Jo to pass between them on the way out.  Castiel sees Sam mouth
After a grueling hunt, Dean’s too tired to maintain his brain to mouth filter, but Sam’s not too tired to be an awesome brother.
“There’s no need to apologize, Sam.  It was an appropriate reaction for the situation,” Castiel assures him.  He smiles, and winks the way he often sees Dean do.  “But if you had shot me, I’d definitely expect an apology.”
But he seems okay at the moment as he straightens from situating their things in the trunk.  He gives Castiel a look as he closes the lid with a
“It’s not
Castiel blinks at him with sleepy eyes.  He’s not much of a morning person, but he usually does better than Dean.  “Good morning, Sam.”
Dean brightens, pride squaring his shoulders as he approaches the car he’s working on.  His grease stained fingers caress the metal where the paint has been removed.  “Sometimes, when I can scratch up some extra cash for the junkers and the parts, and have some free time.  This is a special project though.  It was my dad’s car.”
Despite the futility of the motion, Castiel shifts his weight again.  Maybe it does help.  “I don’t want to sleep.”
Dean hides a snicker behind his hand, and Sam glares at him briefly before returning his attention to Castiel.  “Look, I know it’s a crazy plan, but we think you can do it or we wouldn’t have suggested it.”
“I should probably get back to work,” Dean sighs as he finishes his second cup of coffee.  They’ve once again chatted away a small chunk of the day.  “I’m surprised Jo hasn’t come hunting me down to drag me back already.”
The memory of his anguished cries, filled with pain and a profound sense of loss, touch something deep inside Castiel.  They’ll haunt him, giving him a knowledge of the way his brother probably suffered that he can never forget.
He was going for casual, but he can tell by the look she gives him that he failed.
“How could you not be?” she asks.  “You’re gorgeous!”
It takes the last of his endurance, but between the two of them they manage to muscle the bike into the truck.  Once it’s strapped down, and they get in the truck’s cab, Castiel lets out a long sigh when he’s able to relax and take the weight off his leg.  His hip still hurts, and his scraped skin still burns, but his headache has receded again, and his ankle is no longer protesting so loudly.
“He’s certainly going to try,” Alistair says brightly.  He strokes Castiel’s cheek almost fondly.  “And I look forward to punishing him for it.  You will help me with that.”
Hard green eyes scan the trail behind them.  “Yeah, it’s just a matter of time.”
Dean’s fingers stroke along his jaw, the calluses rasping against his growing beard.  Then his velvety tongue swipes against Castiel’s mouth, seeking entrance.
Running a hand over his face, Castiel tries to focus on the fact that Jo doesn’t sound worried.  “You didn’t have to get a rental, Jo.  I was going to come pick you up.”
Dean gives him a questioning look, but Castiel’s jaw clenches and he gives a tiny headshake.  He looks angry, which makes Dean burn with curiosity, but it’s obvious Cas doesn’t want to talk about it right now so he lets it go.  He’s about to join in on Charlie’s browbeating to get Jo to stay longer when Castiel’s phone buzzes again.
Castiel takes it and sniffs at the contents.  It’s the same sweet beer that has been flowing so liberally around the table, that he’d turned down in favor of the lemon drink.  He takes a sip and sighs as the burn fades slightly.  “Thank you,” he says before taking a larger drink.
Dean digs roughly through the drawer that houses all their old spares, looking for one that will be appropriate for the android.  Most of them are bricked for one reason or another, but Dean’s kept them for parts, and he’s glad now that he didn’t dump them all on Gabriel for cash.  “Dude, we need to get some new burners.”
Castiel stands outside the circle of light cast by the fire, and sudden wariness about the empty darkness around him sends him striding back to camp.
Sam hesitates, and for a moment Dean thinks he’s won.  But Sam’s expression hardens.  “What about Madison?”
One blue eye drops shut in a wink.  “Of course, Dean.”
Usually a dream like last night’s would have kept him awake for hours, but instead of dwelling on the bloody memories and letting them drive him out of his bed, he’d been preoccupied with thoughts of Castiel.  Of how his weight had pushed Dean’s body deeper into the mattress.  The way his thighs had felt caging Dean’s, the strength of Cas’ hands on his wrists, and all the kinky things they could do in that position.  Cas had been affected by their position too.  Dean’s head had been a little foggy at first, but he still felt the telltale twitch of interest pressed into his hip.
“You know I would if I thought the invitation was genuine, cher.” There’s a little less teasing in Benny’s tone, but they both know that’s a ship that sailed a long time ago.  “I’ll see you soon.”
going to show weakness to anyone.  AI or not.
Sam very clearly doesn’t believe him, but he lets it go with a soft hum of acknowledgement.
“Something like that,” Castiel responds warily.
“Hey, no.” Castiel closes the space between them and wraps her in his arms.  She fits against him perfectly, just as she always had.  “It wasn’t just your fault.  We both handled things poorly, and the drugs were
The tall man with the rifle turns, and Castiel’s jaw sags in amazed recognition.  “Sam?”
It’s between check ups, sometime in the afternoon, or at least Dean thinks so since time doesn’t hold as much meaning without a solid sleep schedule, when something shifts in what has become the normal monotony of Dean’s days.  There’s a barely perceptible change in the flutter of Castiel’s pulse under his fingers, and heart monitor double beeps.
He swallows down bile and covers his nose and mouth against the stench of flesh decomposing under the desert sun.  While Dean and Sam speak quietly, a ringing fills Castiel’s ears and he finds himself grateful for his empty stomach so he doesn’t lose its contents in a moment of weakness.
“Well something like it.” Despite the threat of driving a wedge into Sam and Castiel’s budding friendship, excitement buzzes under Dean’s veins, and he grins.  “I think it’s part of his defrag function or something, playing archived memories back as the packets are compiled in his storage banks.  But he’s aware of it and wakes up and doesn’t want to go back to sleep.”
The panic.  The screams and explosions.  He
Castiel grins when Dean trails off, a flush obscurin his freckles.  He cuddles Lore to his chest with one arm as he stands.  Pain stabs through his injured leg, and pulses in his head.  He keeps his eyes on the cat for a moment until he’s sure the pain won’t show in his expression.  When he looks up, he finds Dean standing close, one hand hovering close in case he needs help staying upright, so he must not have done a very good job hiding his reaction.
“It’s because he loves you,” Castiel points out.  “And in my experience, having someone care enough to ‘helicopter’--” Sam chuckles over the air quotes this time, “--is vastly preferable to feeling like no one cares at all.”
