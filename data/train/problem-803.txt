but by John it was even better. The thought rocked through Sherlock, he hadn't even known he would love it until this very moment.
"Alex!" Sherlock said brightly. "You look well. I take it you joined Victor at the gym?" He smiled. Sherlock hugged him back, rather more friendly than John had and Alex said nothing, simply because he was too polite to mention it. He grinned broadly at the detective, winking slightly as he did. Sherlock for his part liked Alex, he was loud, charismatic, but polite. "Mycroft," He said shaking his hand as he emerged from the staircase and then walking over to shake Greg's. "It's good to see you two as well."
"C-Can you help me get in the shower? I feel really cold again." He said, sounding disappointed that now that all that pleasure was gone that he started to feel the sensations of detoxing again. "I think I'm detoxing again," he whispered sadly.
"Ow, be careful, Sherlock!" John snapped as they sat in the back of the car Mycroft had sent for them. Sherlock muttered an apology and then ordered him to stop complaining because he wasn't used to doing this. It wasn't often that Sherlock was the one giving the stitches and John was the one receiving them. John sighed, his mind completely overwhelmed. Time had passed far too quickly for his liking. One moment they were living peacefully in a loving three person relationship with Victor and then suddenly they were parents. Hamish's parents had been brutally murdered, causing the crime scene that they'd received the call to join Greg Lestrade on. Of course once they'd found the little boy it had been clear Sherlock was partial to him. Sherlock had promised not to do anything rash... But apparently letting it casually slip to Greg that they intended to adopt him if his family didn't come forward wasn't considered rash. Nor was slipping off and finalizing the adoption papers two days later. Once the words were in Greg's mind there had been no taking them back. Though John had never wanted to. He loved Hamish. Victor had moved out and into his own lavish flat, proceeding on with school and work until he suddenly disappeared. He'd fallen for his assistant, Alex. He was a nice bloke and if John was honest he was thrilled for the two of them, but they were getting married in the spring and all of it was quite overwhelming. It had happened over the course of three years but to him it felt like three seconds.
"So gentle and caring." Sherlock hummed, as he met John's eyes. "Absolutely perfect."  John went slowly, moaning softly. He was desperate to make sure Victor felt amazing.
"I'm hoping it's gotten better but I have yet to learn how to make that man tell me what he's thinking. How do you get Victor to do it?" Sherlock grinned. "I'm sorry if it bothered you that John did that. I never really thought they would bond the way they did." Sherlock flushed slightly.
." He scooted closer to John, his eyes flashing slightly. "Which isn't fair." John’s head gave another painful throb and he shook his head.
"Never made a fort?" Victor said in shock. He had Greg help him shift the tables and directed Alex on how to move the chairs. "How unfortunate." He smirked remembering all the times he had seen a blanket fort in the living room at Baker Street. These beautifully mad men...
"Sherlock," John whispered very quietly, "We always give Hamish a gift on Christmas eve, do you think the P-U-P-P-Y would be a good gift for tonight?"
"You love it, John. I can feel you inside me. You're so hard." Sherlock moaned as he took one of John's hands and placed it on his cock. "Stroke me." He ordered, already driven mad by his lust. John had told him to have his way with him. Sherlock was doing exactly that. John started stroking him hard, using that small allowed movement to speak for him. "Fuck, yes. Just like that, John!" He moaned loudly, as he started to bounce a bit on John's length. "I'm using you, John, just like you want me to." He smirked down at his lover before meeting his lips with a heated kiss. John was reduced to noises: grunts, whimpers, and moans. He stroked Sherlock with as much focus as he could manage but he was blank, his entire attention focused on Sherlock's tightness wrapped around him. He panted and frantically tried to kiss Sherlock as the man worked him over, his body already frantically trying to move. He struggled to stay still, transfixed by every motion Sherlock made.
"I think you've covered everyone really. You could be out all day at that rate though and you need to rest too. You hit your head pretty hard when he threw you into the room." He sighed softly, his leg giving an involuntary twitch as the adrenaline oozed out of his system and left him hollow and aching. "I could have lost you. We could have lost you..." He whispered, his brooding finally breaking open. "If that knife had been just two inches to the left..." His voice trailed off and he tensed. Now John could see it. He could see how worried Sherlock was and how because of that worry he was sinking into his own mind. There were many signs that was what was happening to his husband but the strongest one was that Sherlock had begun to spin his wedding ring on his finger. John almost inwardly cursed for having bought a ring that spun - it had become an easy habit to Sherlock, one he picked up quickly and now it betrayed his brooding to John whenever he was losing himself under the tide of his own dark thinking. John could see that his husband was thinking so many,
"You want me to use you? Fine. I'll use you. But remember that you asked for it." He warned his voice shaking as he brought a hand to John's hair and tugged on it so his face was turned. "That's it, I want you to look at me while I fuck you," He hissed as he started to slowly push the tip of his cock inside, John.
"I'm okay." He assured John as he crawled out of the fort. "Tripped over some pillows." He confessed as he stood. "Do you need anything?" He walked over to John and ran his fingers through his damp hair. "Water? Medicine? Anything I can get you?"
"Oh..." Victor said softly, his eyes turning to Sherlock who tensed. "So it was you two over at those flats..." He sighed as Sherlock looked down, fighting the desire to comfort the detective that clawed its way up into his chest. "Marius and Hamish have a bit in common, don't they?" He asked tentatively.
"What?" Alex chuckled. "How on earth do you know we were doing that?" He asked nervously, going red.
"Sherlock!" John grunted and bucked his hips slightly. He groaned trying to be still. "I'm sorry Master, please don't stop." He pleaded averting his eyes. He was red with both embarrassment at how much he was enjoying this and desperate need. He wanted to touch them but he was completely lost in their battle. "Oh God, please use me!" He begged
"Goodnight, Sherlock." John whispered back, still running his hands gently over Sherlock but slowing then over time to let him sink to sleep. He kept his thoughts soft, focused on just being there for Sherlock but it took him awhile before he fully relaxed. He didn't quite catch the moment he drifted to sleep, but he slept lightly - hyper alert and aware so that if Sherlock moved he would be able to jump to action.
"Thank you, Master." He whispered, changing his words again without thinking. To him that was what Sherlock was. The master of his heart and soul. "Oh that feels so good!" He whispered, still forcing his body to remain firmly where it was. He dug his nails into his own palms to try to keep himself from moving.
"Fuck, okay, I'm sorry." He whimpered and once his hair was released he quickly went to sit in his chair with a pout. Victor turned to John, a smile on his lips as he straddled his lap.
"Well, it's lucky you've told him or that would have been a very odd way for him to find out." He giggled as he walked into the kitchen to get the plated of biscuits and the milk out.
"I'm sorry Sir," John said softly, but the smirk still played at the edges of his mouth. He moved as Sherlock asked, putting his hands up above his hand as if he was tied up and looking down at Sherlock with pure, burning desire. "I am in position, Sir." He said firmly. "What are my orders now, Sir?" He could not believe the things coming out of his mouth but the sheer desire on Sherlock's face was enough to make him do anything. Sherlock pretended like he didn't see the smirk on John's mouth for the sake of the mood as he climbed back onto the bed. He pushed John's arms up higher, trailing feather light touches over him as he adjusted his leg this way, then that until he was satisfied with John's position.
"You really should knock before you enter other people’s rooms, John." He said, trying to act calm, but inside he wasn’t calm anymore. He was terrified. "They might have company." He snapped.
John woke many hours later. His mind slowly pulling itself from sleep without really wanting to. He'd barely opened his eyes when he blushed realizing he and Victor were holding hands and sandwiching Sherlock in the process. He felt Victor's thumb swipe over his hand and he just barely shifted his gaze up to meet Victor's eyes. Victor had only recently woken himself, but hadn't moved an inch because he didn't want to break the magic of the moment. Both of them were silent for a long time, simply cuddling in closer to the deeply sleeping detective.
Some how this chapter ended up without any smut, don't worry the next chapter will more than make up for it. We promise you.
"Fine, I'll go help him but if you start to feel faint you need to sit down and rest okay?" He kissed him once more before walking back upstairs with Greg who was muttering about doing all the work himself.
"It's alright; we're taking a few days off. And I mean it, Greg." Sherlock crossed his arms but winced and uncrossed them quickly.
"I suppose so. The boys would be disappointed otherwise, I think. They're quite fond of each other already. Not what we pictured previously is it?" John grabbed his bowl from the microwave and shook his head again.
"Oh trust me, I noticed. You have some balls showing up to Buckingham Palace with nothing on but a sheet. But then again you are Sherlock Holmes." He smiled and led Sherlock out of the bathroom and helping him into bed. "I'm going to go get the blanket and make some tea. Do you need anything?" He knelt down and retrieved Sherlock's bags and used needles from under the bed, his face relatively blank as he did so. He could be strong Sherlock was trusting him so for now he'd give him the benefit of the doubt.
"God I want to. I want to feel you so tight around me." He groaned, bucking his hips slightly. "I'm so hard for you."
"We don't have much time." Sherlock whispered and motioned for Greg to lead. He was the trained police officer. Greg took a deep breath and looked to Sherlock.
"Yes, because you damage them. That's why people blow on their soup or their coffee before they drink it. So they don't hurt their tongue."
smirk. The one that said 'Aren't you adorable?' The one that irritated Sherlock to no end. "Just like you couldn't see it with me. He loves you Sherlock. You two were alone against the world and had nothing." He sighed again, that ache welling up in his chest again. "If I had to guess, he's in love with you." Sherlock stared at John with confusion.
"Yes well, no offense my love - but the governments of the world require a bit more firmness than the police of the Yard." He smiled and leaned their foreheads together. "We should probably finish showering so we can get some sleep. Then when we are home and Marius is settled we can see if
"I only ever want to be yours." Alex said, still blushing a bit as he placed soft kisses on Victor's neck. They were alone. He was allowed to do things like this if they were alone, wasn't he? "I don't want to be touched by anyone but you. I never want to share my bed with anyone but you, do you understand?" He asked, playfully growing and nibbling on his ear. He wasn't being entirely honest, but he was enjoying how the primal growl in his voice was making Victor shiver.
"You're angry." John said when Sherlock helped him stand and walked toward the bedroom. "Don't be. Greg only told me because I kept asking what case was so important." They were in the bathroom now and John was leaning against the wall as he watched Sherlock turn the water on. "I'm sorry I never told you. Maybe if I had told you that boy's parents would still be alive." Sherlock’s entire body was rigid and tight. His movements were angular and sharp, leaving John worried he might go off at any moment.
"Oh, please, Master. I'm sorry I'm so bad. I promise to be a better pet. Please let me release." He begged and he meant every word because he knew Mycroft was being utterly serious. "Please let me please you, Master. You can fuck my mouth. I won't make a sound. I promise."
handle it." John whispered and pulled him into a deeper kiss before slowly shuffling into the bathroom. John flipped the shower on and slowly undressed. He stepped into the stream of hot water and let his forehead rest against the wall. He didn't know why but he felt overwhelmed, like too much emotion was caught in his chest. He took slow metered breaths as he tried to keep himself calm. He found himself worrying about the two of them, about Sherlock and about Victor. Meanwhile Sherlock nervously stepped into the living room seeing Victor laying on the couch with his eyes closed.
"Sorry Sir," John mumbled softly, lowering his eyes to indicate his submissiveness. "You are beautiful..." He whispered blushing some as he did. He slowly looked back up at Sherlock, his head turned down even as his gaze returned to Sherlock's face. He just gave in and just followed his instincts. He put his hands flat on the bed, palms down and assumed a military stance. Still looking up at Sherlock from a subservient head tilt when he spoke, "What are my orders, please give them to me Sir." He pleaded, shivering with arousal. Sherlock couldn't help but moan at the sight of
"I didn't try too hard. You try hiding something from a Holmes in this flat." John snorted with a bit of laughter but returned his attention to Sherlock, trying to play off his annoyance. "Is this helping?" He asked softly, not fighting the blush that rose on his cheeks, as he let his hands rub smaller circles on the detectives back.
"My love, when Uncle Vic leaves, I will be a little sad. But Papa and I are going away on a holiday soon to cheer me up and when we come back everyone will be happy. You'll be happy, Papa and I will be happy, and Marius will be happy because he'll get to stay with us while your Uncles take a holiday together."
At this point, Sherlock wasn't sure what he wanted. He felt like if he tried hard enough he could have both of these boys doing every little thing he said. Christ, it'd be wonderful too. But Sherlock wasn't sure if he could fight enough to regain control. This felt remarkable. Having both of these gorgeous men ravish his neck made him want to melt and made him want to obey every one of Captain Watson's commands. In the end, he tried to be logical. Which way would he get the most use out of the both of them? Yes, he was being selfish but he didn't care. Logic told him being submissive would get him what he wanted... But the ache in his cock told him if he was desperate enough he could have both of these boys on their knees for him. Then he felt it, he felt John's desire to be commanded. To be punished for having these thoughts. It made him hum in enjoyment.
"You're a fucking tease." Victor hissed as he started to ravish Sherlock's neck. Sherlock looked over at John with a knowing grin.
"Yes... It does. It only didn't earlier because I was upset..." John smiled against Sherlock's lips, he was still thankful that he had this power over his husband. His mind could get so carried away and sometimes he just needed to stop thinking.
"Holy fuck..." John forced out. Sherlock chuckled and wrapped his arms around John, kissing his shoulder.
"Hm? I'm fine, love. I'm not worried. I'm just focused on building this house with you two." Greg lied as he took Marius into his lap and helped him break apart two bricks that were stuck together. Hamish watched them for a moment, something in his face betraying the thoughtfulness going on behind his eyes.
"Yea he got in the shower." John said softly. He sighed. He felt tired, and wrong, and a whole host of emotion that he didn't know what to do with. "He cares about you a lot." He said gently, giving Sherlock a sad smile. "Why don't you go to bed for a bit. I'll sit up and keep an eye on him then we can switch in a couple of hours." John felt guilty. Like he should somehow... What convince Sherlock to love a man who used him? Like he wasn't worth Sherlock's love and Victor was? Suddenly nothing in his head made sense. But he knew Victor was hurting and he knew what it was like to think Sherlock didn't care. He actually ached for Victor, he felt some sort of unspeakable bond with the man. The sort that came from choosing to do something so wildly crazy it forced you to become friends. That's why John and Greg were so close. They knew what it was like to live with a Holmes.
flat. He warmed up some water and then moved into the bathroom to get a wash cloth. He set these down by the door to Sherlock's room before going to get glasses of water for them both. He entered the room and gently washed Sherlock off with the warm towel and then dried him so he wouldn't get cold. He readjusted the heating blanket and put Sherlock's water near him before returning the bowl and towel to where they belonged. Then with a quick trip to his room for his mobile charger he was back to stay. He plugged in Sherlock's mobile and then his own, dropping his bathrobe and then slipping back into bed.
"You can always sit on my shoulders, Mish." John said happily helping his little monkey climb up on top of his shoulders where he held him carefully. He looked over at Sherlock with a smile. "Do you remember how tall our last one was? I ask because last year it was bit small and I think we can go another foot or two." John said, simply thinking out loud as they began to walk around the many rows of Christmas trees. "Hamish, do you want to put the star on top like last year?" John asked with a bright smile, looking up at his son.
"Put the gun down or you leave this room in body bag." Sherlock hissed lowly, rage apparent in every line of his body. The woman started shrieking in confusion, two new men had just burst into her house and pointed guns around. Her husband lay dead in the other room, having given his life to protect her and their son. Whom she now thought was in terrible danger. At first she didn't stop shrieking even as the man behind her clenched her hard in surprise; but after a few moments she suddenly recognized Greg and stopped screaming.
Sherlock just nodded as John promised him they would go back to bed and he would be okay. Allowing himself to relax just a bit because he knew they were alone for the moment. He pressed their foreheads together and closed his eyes for a moment.
"To breathe." John grinned and kissed him again, pressing his body against Sherlock's. He wrapped one hand gently in those dark curls, pressing their mouths back together eagerly.
"Your fiancée may not like you doing that." John whispered in his ear, making it look like he'd just been reaching for syrup for his pancakes. Alex had not only noticed the gesture but had expected it. He knew that Victor and John shared an even more tender and powerful bond than the one Victor shared with Sherlock. He had not been surprised when he saw Victor grab up his phone and stalk from their room to answer John's messages recently. He knew Victor loved him. He felt like he would not be a very supportive partner if he tried to hem Victor in and stop him from interacting with the Holmes. Instead he resolved himself to speak up when he did start feeling uncomfortable and for now to focus on Marius and Greg as Greg tended to his son.
"Four. My brain's not addled Sherlock." He grinned and pulled Sherlock down for a soft kiss. "I'm laughing because this is just us, so bloody us. Both of us scrambling around in the dark trying to help the other without a clue what in the bloody hell we're doing. Because I'm falling apart ignoring that I'm sick trying to take care of you and now you're going to try to pretend you're better than you are so you can take care of me and it's just... Us." He smiled and stroked his thumb over his cheek, staring into Sherlock's eyes. Sherlock couldn't help but smile at John. It was really
"Why not?" Hamish crossed his arms and demanded. "If kissing is what you do to people you love then why not my cousin?" Greg was a terrible shade of red now, what had he gotten himself into? Inwardly he cursed Sherlock for teaching Hamish so much, so soon. He took a deep breath and ran a hand through his hair.
“I'm not leaving the flat for work,” Sherlock insisted after a brief pause. “And you, Uncle Mycroft, should learn that Santa Claus is an important thing for children. Or so I'm told." Sherlock smirked. Mycroft only rolled his eyes at his brother before he continued to shake more red and green glitter of his shirt.
"I am well aware of that, Victor. Very well aware." Sherlock wrapped his arms around John from behind, resting his chin on his shoulder. John smiled a bit, leaning into Sherlock. Sherlock was so relaxed, so open it was hard for him to consider actually trying to speak up. But he really did need to tell him how he was feeling and now since everyone was occupied he could.
"No, no, no. We're done." He said sternly. "Christmas is in a few days. We're on Holiday from this moment on and we’re done." He said it firmly but he could still see the glint of curiosity in Sherlock's eyes. "Sherlock," He said warningly.
"It'll be alright, Marius." Sherlock said softly, trying to calm the boy. But he didn't have to be a doctor to know the woman wasn't going to make it. Greg was suddenly on his knees beside them trying to help Sherlock however he could.
. He pulled his bathrobe lazily around himself as he came into the room, barely noting that they were standing in the doorway. He was mad at himself for sleeping through Sherlock's pain but he just padded over to the med kit, found the partially used vial and a new syringe, and walked over to Sherlock. His full attention was on Sherlock as he mentally ticked off the hours to be sure it was alright for Sherlock to have the next dose and determined that he was almost precisely on time for the injection. Followed by the Dramamine an hour later. "He is quitting." John said sternly but didn't turn his attention to them, instead speaking specifically with Sherlock. "I'm going to have to give you another dose, Sherlock. Are the symptoms still the same?"
"We were very close until I went to University..." Mycroft said softly, something tightening in his face. He looked at Sherlock with some confusion, as if he'd just realized something. Sherlock flushed just slightly.
"I sort of guessed as much from the sound of the water." Victor said softly and moved so he was at the opposite end of the couch. He tensed a bit and sat up rigid and firm. "So what he sent you in here to babysit me? I'm an adult. I don't need you two breathing down my neck." He was trying to be harsh but the emotion wasn't behind the words, something even Sherlock could read. "What's with him anyway? He's going to crash and burn at this rate." He again tried to remain unaffected but Sherlock detected the attachment in his voice. It intrigued him but he knew better than to push too hard. Victor seemed to trust and care for John, perhaps that was something that would make this easier?
"He won't do anything." Sherlock hissed. He was upset. Why was everyone so dead set on treating Victor like a ticking time bomb? He was still a person and he didn't feel like it was stupid for Sherlock to still have faith in him. In his frustration he wanted something to distract himself from the look on their faces, so he turned to John and he noticed that for all intents and purposes John had fallen asleep with a fork in his hand.
"John, you can tell me anything. I promise I won't do anything rash." He rubbed John's knee, trying to be comforting but lacking in any idea about how to properly provide comfort in the moment. He wanted to try though. In fact it was almost a desperate need to comfort the wounded soldier before him. He knew that he was the one hurting him and he wanted to fix that. He wanted to help him.
"I wasn't flirting. I was being polite. After all you get upset if I am mean. Besides we got the perfect tree for our perfect Christmas." He said it softly but he was basically pouting. He scooted back and looked out the window tending slightly. "I don't flirt. I don't know how."
"For about five years now, on and off. But mostly on." Greg answered glancing over at Mycroft and beaming at him. "We met when Sherlock was going through a... tough time. He overdosed pretty badly and I was the officer that was called to the scene. I met Mycroft that day and since then we've been together."
"Hm?" John hummed. He had almost fallen asleep but at the sound of his husband's voice he woke again. He looked at him with worried eyes. Christ he was spinning his ring again. It made his heart flutter slightly, knowing that his health was the only thing that so easily destabilized his normally unaffected husband. "Nothing, love. I'm okay. Really don't worry, please."
"Sh," he whispered, trying to soothe Hamish. "You didn't mean to. It's okay." He kissed the top of his head. John pulled away to look at his face and wipe away the tears."Papa does everything in the world to keep me safe, only sometimes Daddy doesn't listen because he's stubborn." He explained with a smile as he ran a hand through Hamish's hair. "You don't have to cry, I'm okay. Really.  Papa does a wonderful job at protecting me." He promised as he leaded close and rubbed their noses together.
"Oh! OH! Sherlock!" John grunted feeling Sherlock's nails dig into his hips as he worked. "Yes, please don't stop!" His ass hurt but it felt so good. The sting of touch rushing over it as Sherlock worked stirring up the tension and sensation from the riding crop. John's fingers were white with effort as he clutched the bed so tightly his gaze still on Sherlock as he worked. He didn't just
"Well if you prefer Sherlock's taste then you must like classical then?" John stood almost still as he flipped through a CD case. Victor could tell it was his because of how gently he flipped through it, but as flipped through Victor could see most of the CDs were classical collections. John Watson didn't strike him as someone who liked classical music, which meant he was just as easily influenced by Sherlock as Victor himself had once been. He seemed to be looking for a specific CD, his brow furrowed with focus. Victor found himself enjoying the overall effect the look had on his face, betraying the compassion that seemed unending within the man. His mind sufficiently distracted he watched as John picked out a CD and slipped it into the player. John knew it was one of the few CDs Sherlock occasionally put on himself when he needed noise to think but didn't want to play himself. He turned it on not to softly and not to loud. "He walked back over and sat down next to Victor again, helping prop him back against the couch. "Focus on the music, the notes, the details... Let it fill you up until nothing else exists but the sound." Victor gave him a quizzical look and it made John get the impression he thought he was insane. "Trust me, I know it sounds stupid, but try it." He coaxed gently, stopping short of putting his hand on Victor's shoulder again.
"So eager..." He purred, "eager to please me." He swatted that blushing arse again, once on each cheek. "You are doing so well. Those were for your cheeky comments about Mycroft being controlling." He leaned down and pressed his noticeably bulging pants into Sherlock so that the fabric and his erection applied pressure to his blushing skin. "I think you have done so well you deserve to be rewarded now." He stepped back quickly leaving a gap between them. "Turn around,
"Yes... I do think we can." He whispered, meeting Greg's eyes. He knew that Hamish could only have learnt that song from Sherlock, and if Sherlock could love a child that much… If his once emotionless brother could teach a child to be this tender, well so could he.
"I think Greg would thoroughly enjoy watching me own you on a crime scene." John said softly, with intention as he stretched. "It's hard for us to stop isn't it? I mean all this time of repressed emotion and sexual tension. But I probably should eat lunch and we should probably try to get some sort of nourishment into you, whether you want it or not." Sherlock blushed at the idea and then he shook his head.
"I met him at University, he was my only friend. I'd never had any other friends before so needless to say it eventually turned into something more, but I was never truly able to be myself around him. I kept secrets from him and I wasn't as comfortable being my true self with him like I am with you. I never let him take me to bed but I did kiss him and go out to parties with him. He started using drugs and for awhile I was able to keep that separate from myself, but he talked me into it. He knew exactly what to say to convince me that it was a perfectly logical idea and that's how I became an addict. Mycroft tried to keep me away from him after he found out about my drug habit but it didn't work. I couldn't cut him out completely because even though I broke off our romantic relationship he was still my drug dealer. But..." Sherlock took a deep breath, rubbing a hand over his face. "This will be the part you won't like." He whispered, preparing himself for the possibility that John might just jump up and run away. "Sometimes, when I couldn't pay him I'd... I had no other choice but to suck him off." He confessed with his eyes closed not wanting to read John's face. Which he expected to be full of disappointment and anger. "I didn't want to but he suggested it and I rather needed the drugs." John processed the information watching how Sherlock shut down his ability to analyze him. He let himself fall silent for a moment and wondered what Sherlock expected him to feel. He supposed Sherlock expected him to feel angry or disappointed but he didn't feel that way at all. He felt sad for him because he knew what drugs could do, he knew the horrible things addicts did to get the next hit.
John's body took over and he grabbed Sherlock's hips, slamming him down over his own cock hard. He was already shaking and moaning and just an overall mess, so it didn't take long for him to feel his body clenching hard, ready to explode. He slammed Sherlock into himself a few more times, arching his back to swipe across that sensitive spot before he shouted Sherlock's name and an orgasm ripped through his body. He held on for a bit longer until Sherlock's hot seed splashed over both of their chests and then he utterly collapsed, panting for breath.
"John Watson, I love you but if you ever feel like ending it all again, I swear, I will knock some sense into." He warned. "I love you. You changed my life the moment you walked into St. Bart's. If I lost you I don't know how I would cope."
"I keep telling him he's my friend. I don't know what else to say." Sherlock said with a blush he wasn't really good with confrontation. Being blunt, yes. But he knew that Victor wouldn't be happy if he just said, '
"Like shit," Surprisingly that answer came easily from Sherlock who was curled up in his chair. He was getting the damn flu. He was trying so hard to fight it but he knew he was getting it. He curled up tightly in chair his eyes shut tight as he held his stomach tightly. To make everything worse, his throat was already starting to feel a tad sore. "B-But I'll be fine."
"Well Papa wouldn't come in the fort..." Hamish pouted. Sherlock got up as the food arrived, paying for it and bringing it in and giving it to John.
"Okay," Sherlock said with a eager smile as he grabbed John's hand, his fingers placed carefully over his pulse. "Let's check your pulse first." He whispered before he started to kiss John softly. "Oh, it's rather rapid, John." He murmured against his lips. "I wonder why, it's not like your doctor is doing anything to excite you." He teased.
"If your headache does not get better soon I am going to call Mycroft's doctor to come to the house." He was very serious, that same dark fear from the night before returning full sweep.
"No, I don't want to watch it either. I just wanted to do something I knew you'd like." Sherlock admitted. He pulled away from John only so he could lay down and pull John on top of him. "Here, now you can hold me for as long as you want. I promise I won't get bored." He assured the other. "But, I actually may fall asleep. I'm rather tired, I didn't get any sleep last night. I'm rather certain you didn't either, Dr. Watson." He kissed his lips softly before he closed his eyes.
." Sherlock said with a giggle as he pulled away from John's touch. "Touch, Victor. I know you want to." He said with a smirk as Victor moved to sit in his lap.
"You're touching me. That always elevates my pulse. But you're also on top of me." John chuckled again. "So handsome and so very beautiful..." He murmured as he watched Sherlock. Sherlock felt his cheeks warm at the sweet words and he looked away feeling just a tad shy.
to Sherlock - what it was that made Sherlock so careful in their interactions. He wanted to see the unbridled truth contained within the cold, calculating mind that dazzled and delighted him. To see the only man he'd never seen falter give in to that side of himself that would only ever be wild and uncontrolled. "Please," He barely breathed. Sherlock simply couldn't take anymore, hearing John begging like that broke him. He threw the riding crop aside and pushed John onto the bed until his chest was on the bed, his ass in the air.
"Dat sounds nice." Marius said as he snuggled into Mycroft's arms. "Can I have a pictuwer of my Mummy and Da? I haved one in my old room." Greg nodded quickly. "Of course you can. I'll have one of my police officers bring it over to our house tomorrow. Would you like your toys too?" Greg asked and he was utterly shocked when the little boy shook his head. "Why not?" He asked curiously. "Dey would 'mind me of Mummy and Da too much."
"I could tell. And it's not as hard to share it when I know you need to hear it." Sherlock explained as he continued to kiss John with a surprising heat. Shit, if they weren't careful they could end up shagging all over again. "We better be careful, I'm already starting to get turned on, John."
"You've been bottling it up for too long." John said, hugging Sherlock tightly, not caring how badly his head hurt. "There is nothing wrong with you. You're upset; there is no shame in that. You watched that little boy's mother die today, did you really expect to remain unattached? You're not emotionless stone, Sherlock. If you're upset, please, be upset." He kissed the back of his neck a few times, his own eyes closed because his vision was a bit blurred again. "Don't feel like you have to hide how you feel from me just because I'm sick."
"I love you." John forced out, almost wincing with the quickness he'd said it, at how easy it had been to admit it. "That's why this hurts so much." The tears again, damn it he was not used to feeling this much all at once. His breath was pronounced, his shoulders rising and falling with each breath. His eyes looked wild but afraid as he bore his heart, his whole truth, to Sherlock. Maybe Sherlock would regret all of this when he was sober again, maybe he'd run away or tease John; but whatever happened then he had to get it out of himself now or he was going to explode. Sherlock’s eyes narrowed and John watched as the words burned trails through his mind, igniting the fuses of thousands of thoughts. But he was convinced that he could make Sherlock stop thinking, that he could replace what the drugs gave Sherlock. And he had to know if he was right. "Stop thinking." He commanded and he pressed his mouth to Sherlock's, letting their lips meet for the first time. Sherlock had been on the verge of protesting. He couldn’t stop thinking, that was utterly impossible. Especially now. He’d never been in love, what was love? He needed to understand. Were the feelings he felt for John love or was it just fondness...
"This won't play out well," Greg mumbled as he looked up at Mycroft, listening to John's angry footfall retreat down the hall. Mycroft stood and moved to the window to watch John's exit, sighing. "He's never seen Sherlock when he's high. He's never seen him on edge like we have. He doesn't know there's no talking to him. No reasoning with him. All that matters to him is the high. When's he's using he doesn't care about anything else. Why are you letting him go back to him? Won't that just make things worse?" Greg stood, walking over to the window and joining Mycroft watching John get in a taxi. His mind wandering to Sherlock and wondering what had made to Sherlock chose to go back to his addiction? He thought for sure John would have been able to keep Sherlock clean. "He had been doing so well, what made him relapse?" He tentatively placed his hand on Mycroft's back, offering his lover support.
Alex smiled, running a hand through his dark hair and his eyes growing pleased as he looked around. He knew full well the extent of the relationship Sherlock, John, and Victor had shared. Victor had told him the entire story very early on in their relationship so that Alex would be clear on how important John and Sherlock were to Victor. Alex knew Victor owed a lot to the 'Baker Street Boys,' and that in Victor's mind he still had not repaid even a fraction of what they were due. Alex enjoyed the stories that Victor told but sometimes when Victor got lost in a memory Alex worried he might leave him to go back to a life where two lovers were better than one. Alex blushed a bit guiltily as he knew that his fear was part of the reason the pair hadn't visited the Holmes family since Hamish turned two. Victor cutting off his visits abruptly following a slightly tipsy evening celebrating John and Sherlock's anniversary. He sighed, forcing that dark thought away and looked around at the family gathered before him.  Sherlock reappeared from the bedroom, wearing his purple shirt and black trousers. Which forced John to look away, lest he giggle and give away Sherlock's plan to torment Victor.
"Right Mycroft, how very easy for you to say." John crossed his arms, biting his bottom lip to keep from saying anything else. He hoped Greg would hurry.
"Oh but you have." His grin widened and he nipped at his neck. "You didn't ask me if we could begin properly, did you?" Sherlock bit his lip, realizing his mistake. He couldn't pretend he hadn't done it. He was somewhat upset that he'd done it but he was also marveling that John had picked up the thread of their game quite so quickly.
Sherlock sat straight up in bed with a gasp as a soft knock rang through their room. He had a sour, unpleasant look on his face as he was utterly exhausted. The knock came again along with the frantic turning of the handle, which thankfully was still locked. Sherlock sighed.
"This is my fault..." Sherlock muttered softly, surprising Greg again. Sherlock didn't often admit he'd done something wrong and usually if he did it meant he felt like he'd really bungled it all up. "It's at least six... No, more than six." Greg sighed as Sherlock's eyes focused on him, he didn't even want to know how Sherlock was figuring all of that out, likely the lines on his face or some such nonsense. "This is why you've been so keen on having Hamish around. You realized this was connected before and never told me because you didn't want to upset me. You don’t know how to handle me now that I’ve show emotion and become a parent… So you were trying to keep me from feeling guilty about taking time away with Hamish while at the same time you were trying to get me to pick up the case again. That's why you gave me such vague information..." He said darkly, automatically spinning his ring. "Damn it. I'm sorry Greg. I let you down. We
"No. Is that true?!" Hamish asked softly, in awe. He loved it when Sherlock told him scientific things. "Is... Is it because of your... Your taste buds?" He asked eagerly, trying to prove to Sherlock he'd learned something even being so young.
"Shit," He breathed not being able to stop himself from cursing. "You aren't so bad yourself, John." He smirked before bringing him down into a deeper kiss their tongues moving together furiously. Just as Sherlock shifted his hips so his burgeoning erection rubbed against John’s thighs, a ring from his phone indicated he had text message. With a groan of annoyance Sherlock pulled out of the kiss. "Hold on," he mumbled before reaching over and grabbing it. John sighed in disappointment but turned his attention to Sherlock without voicing a complaint.
"Oh- Oh fuck the not moving rule." He panted, now desperate to go over the edge because he was so close. "Just fuck me." He ordered, growling with need as took his own cock in hand and started stoke it. "Just fuck me; I'm close, just fuck me hard, Please!" He begged.
"Yes, fuck me, yes. Cum inside Victor!" He growled as he continued to slam into the both of them. He was on the edge of an amazing orgasm as well. It was so achingly close his movements were becoming harder and faster. Then just when he thought he couldn't take anymore he felt John tighten around him. The moans that escaped both of his lovers lips caused him go over the edge with such a powerful orgasm it literally took his breath away. He didn't know how long he stopped breathing but once he started again he gasped and clung to John. His body shaking as he rode out the aftermath. "Oh God. Oh my God." He repeated over and over again, no other words coming into his mind. John and Victor shouted loud as they orgasmed and John just barely stopped himself from collapsing on Victor. He held himself up so Sherlock was braced against him but it was clear he would not be able to hold their weight long. He could not speak or even try form words. He just panted and shook as he stared at Victor. He was boneless and wanted to just fall down, his arms shaking hard.
"If I have a concussion I shouldn't sleep." He said with a frown. He wanted to sleep. He felt like that would help. He hugged Hamish close, running his fingers through the boys' hair in an effort to ease him back into sleep.
. Even though he felt like his body was finally cooling down Sherlock couldn't enjoy the sensation because of the guilt clawing at his chest. He'd never felt guilt like this before, the closest had been the guilt at leaving John alone for so long after St. Bart's but that was to protect him, to keep him safe. This was supposed to be the same thing, why did it feel so different? He grimaced and hugged John tighter, drawing a look of surprise from John. The hug was clearly protective as if he was shielding John. Which in his mind he was, he was just trying to protect him from Victor.
"Sherlock, I'm not..." He sighed and then laughed. "Isn't this your favorite shirt?" He slipped on the clothes and slid out of the fort, padding into the kitchen. The purple shirt barely fit over his arms, which were thicker than Sherlock's but he wore it all the same. The purple a start contrast against the white undershirt. Sherlock blushed slightly as John turned to look at him. "I just want to make sure that our new flat mate isn't put off by our broken table."
"That's sweet, but I doubt it's so innocent. I love you." John grinned and moaned again, his eyes fluttering closed. Christ he hadn't felt this aroused around someone since he was a teen. His body stirring again even though he'd just... The memory crowded into his brain and he grunted. "What have I gotten into?" He smirked.
"Yes." Sherlock hummed, his eyes closing as he relaxed into John's touch. It was making the ache in his head dull some. He let out a deep relaxed sigh, "Even when I was a child. It's always been this way."
"We won't either that's why you have to stay close." He nuzzled Hamish's nose. "Maybe Daddy will let you sit on his shoulders again."
."Please! Claim me! Own me! Make me yours, John, please!" Sherlock was a whimpering mess now so desperate to have John inside him that he would literally do anything to get it.
"Please, Master. May I have the punishment I deserve?" When he heard no reply Sherlock knew he had to do better than that. Christ he had to do better than that. He
Sherlock stared at the screen with confusion, his face screwing up a bit because that message really made no sense to him.
"He thought you were my date the last time we came here, John. I doubt he'll think much of us coming back." Angelo came out from the kitchen and smiled brightly when he saw Sherlock and John.
"Are you okay Uncle?" Hamish looked up at him. "You have the same look Papa gets when he's worrying about something." The boys faces turned up to look at him, Marius trying to see what Hamish saw.
me here. This is the first time I've had your attention in almost eight minutes." John whispered and continued his work. "Brood all you want, Sherlock. I'm your doctor, your partner, and your lover - I'm going to take care of you the best way I know how. You've been dangerous before, hell you attacked me... But we both know I can hold my own." He kept up his work, smoothing over the muscles with expert care. "You need me and I won't leave you when you need me the most." Eight minutes? That wasn't too bad. He knew they both were used to the times when his mind would get so stuck that nothing could get attention for three days. Eight minutes was almost nothing in comparison. He leaned into John's touch trying again to keep his mind here with John. He wanted to stay with John. Victor wasn't important. John was.
He let his hand sink down so he was holding Sherlock's, wanting to have some sort of contact with him. He nuzzled deeper into the blankets, his other hand clutching the purple shirt around him as he slept, shivering just slightly. It only took a few seconds for Sherlock to drift off. Content in the moment even though he still felt like he was about to be sick. He slept through the nausea, his hand tightly wound in John's even in sleep. Though he knew it must have been hours later when he was jolted away by a knocking at the flat door it felt like he had just closed his eyes.
"I don't think he'll kill us," Victor assured John with a chuckle. "I think he'll just get between us and demand we pay attention to how brilliant he is." Victor ended up giggling at the thought because Sherlock would most definitely do that. "He pouts if we don't pay attention to him, have you realized that?"
Greg took off as fast as he could and cursed the day he'd stopped working out because he wasn't as fast as he used to be. He heard a shot fired and ducked out of the way, rolling behind some bins before firing a shot back. The man ducked around the house and before Greg could catch him burst back into the flat to find Sherlock trying to calm Marius. Just as the woman walked back into the room and sighed with relief that Marius was safe the assailant burst into the kitchen and fired a shot, hitting her in the chest. Sherlock shouted and set the boy down before rushing over to try to staunch the bleeding but shouted in surprise when a shot rang out and the assailant screamed, a bullet hole gaping in his leg.
"I honestly have never felt so much emotion for one person in all my life. The idea of you having ever been touched by anyone else before me is infuriating. Though it's childish to think that way," He let their foreheads rest together, enjoying the closeness. "I will go wherever you lead, just as I always have."
"John!" Sherlock moaned but it came out as desperate whine. "Christ, the things you do to me, John. I'm already so close." He whimpered into his ears as his hips moved on their own. He gripped John's hips even tighter while his lips worked together with John's. "I love you, John. I love you so fucking much." He panted.
"He's been into some very expensive places before, brother. Regardless of what you think I do try to treat him to better than just takeaway. I also doubt it would shock him as much as you'd like it too." He hummed a bit as he thought and then conceded Mycroft's point. "I do think he would like French food though. We both know I have always have but then again mother did start us eating French food early in our lives, being French herself." Sherlock concluded before putting his fork down and moving a bit closer to John to rest his hand on his shoulder. He wanted contact and really if he was honest he wanted to go back to the flat and see that uniform. It was consuming his thoughts. He felt like eating anymore would cause him to explode. John smirked and looked down over his plate.
"Why don't you just go on holiday somewhere? What about Paris?" He hummed happily. "I'd love to go there. I went there a few times when I was kid, I had a few cousins who lived over there." Mycroft turned to watch Greg's face as he remembered some of his visits to France, a small smile warming his tense face.
"They were both exhausted." Sherlock said softly and stood up to put the glasses away. He gently draped a blanket over the two boys, kissing their foreheads before returning to the couch. "I'm not brooding. There is a very large difference between..."
"Hm, maybe." John smirked and moaned softly. As soon as the cab was back at the flat he got out, half dragging Sherlock as he did. "Maybe you should ask for it properly." He giggled, unlocking the door. Sherlock gave a laugh and let John pull him up the stairs, John was almost as desperate as he was for this. That was promising. He leaned close to John's ear, grinning like an idiot.
"Where's Sherlock? I thought you two were working on a case." He said as he hung up his jacket, loosened his tie and removed his coat. Victor's health had come back in leaps and bounds under John's careful care and he looked so much better now. His muscles were coming back, the dark circles no longer lived under his eyes, and he was beginning to look the way he imagined he would after University. John smirked and motioned for Victor to join him on the couch, grinning as he did.
"You're Mummy and Daddy are safe in heaven, just like Marius's parents. The bad men are gone. No one else will lose their parents again." He whispered to Hamish. Greg only smiled at that knowing stare, he loved children. He honestly did and it was clear this little one would need a little brother or sister to help him get along.
John's illness is getting worse, Sherlock has the flu, and Victor arrives... But Victor doesn't find what he expects in the good Doctor but how could he? They're the only two men in the world who are mad enough to fall for Sherlock Holmes.
"You'll be spanking for a while then," John said with a wide grin and it earned him another smack which caused him to wince and then let out a soft giggle. "Test me, Master. I bet I can last longer than you think." John said with a smug smile at Sherlock. Sherlock fell silent and he brought his hand down on John rapidly, a flurry of movement. He varied the speed but never the intensity watching as John's ass turned bright red.
. Punish me. I deserve to be punished. I didn't behave. I was bad. Please punish me for it!" He begged, trembling with desire.
"Uncle Victor?" Hamish asked, coming to rest at their feet and looking up at them with his very best, very perfect impression of Sherlock's cold, steely gaze.
"You don't need a second opinion. He's one of the best doctors around." Victor said softly, the amount of emotion he'd just watched go through the doctor devouring him from the inside out.
"I will not." He said as firmly as he could, already half asleep. "You brought that on yourself. Instead I shall wear a triumphant smirk all day tomorrow while you are reminded of it every time you move."
"I won't forget." John whispered, hearing the words again made his heart flutter. "I love you." He murmured softly. "It will take me time to get used to this but it will be okay. And when your mind won't quiet just take whatever you need from me. I honestly don't care if we are in the middle of a crime scene or cuddled in bed. Anything I can do for you I will." His breath was heavy as he stared back into those eyes. "You are my life." Sherlock heart swelled with something he still couldn't quite understand, he knew it was love. He knew this feeling clanging around his chest was love but it was still a tad overwhelming. He smiled softly and instead of doing anything sexual he just wrapped his arms around John and kissed his shoulder.
"Paris... We could go for Christmas." Mycroft offered Greg to soften the moment. John looked out the window trying to soothe his own nerves. He wasn't angry at Sherlock but any mention of Victor made some strange rage sweep through him, a jealousy he didn't yet understand. He couldn't possibly understand that he was jealous of not being Sherlock's first lover. He turned back, feeling a bit mollified and grinned.
"Neck-lace." Hamish sounded the word out slowly. The cab stopped and Sherlock hugged Hamish tightly to him as he opened the door and scooted out. He paid the cabbie and smiled as Hamish got excited again. "Pancakes!" He shouted.
"I'm fine," John answered with a simple shrug, he even dared to give his husband a bit of smirk. He wasn't going to let Sherlock tease him. Not right now at least. "I am perfectly fine despite what you're doing," he whispered before turning his gaze back to Hamish. "Slow down," He chuckled as he took the cup away. "You'll get sick if you drink it that fast."
"I-I can wash them for you," Sherlock offered, not wanting to be completely useless. Victor scoffed,
"Trying is all I can ask for." He whispered, shivering as his breath slowed. "Thank you." His arms relaxed slightly but he was still very tense. "I felt your mind clear when our lips met. I could feel it in how you relaxed. Is that what the drugs do for you?"
"I had a feeling that was the case." Mycroft smiled and he leaned into Greg just slightly. "If they do answer, I won't be offended if you don't mention me."
At that last message John felt his heart give a painful ache and instead of forcing himself to reply, he set his phone aside and turned his gaze to Hamish.
"Hm...." Hamish said thoughtfully, back to playing with Sherlock's scarf. "We should get her something pretty!"
"Really? Well be careful on those stairs, don't run." He ordered and he smiled when Hamish took Marius's hand and explained how he should go down the stairs. He let him go and watched as Marius climbed down.
"John, love," Sherlock whispered leaning down towards him. "Greg and I are going to catch the people who murdered Hamish's parents. There's another boy in danger. This is the case Greg has been bothering me about, it needs to be solved now. Mycroft is here and Hamish is with him. Rest and I will be home soon." John was aware of the throbbing pain in his head before he even registered what Sherlock said. He sat up carefully, wincing as the throbbing seemed worse.  He forced his brain out of sleep and to focus on the situation at hand, his body immediately trying to convince him to get up and go out on the case with him.
"Please, Captain Watson. Please. I want to see you in the uniform you wore when you were in the desert. I want to see the uniform you were meant to use to dominate me with. To control me with. It's the only thing that will make me behave completely. If you're in that uniform, I will follow every order without question, just please let me see it on you." He almost whimpered because his mind was so totally possessed of the image of the uniform on
"I-I can't ask him to do that," John said wiping his tears away. He felt like that was too much, they were making a fuss over nothing. "We've been away from Hamish too long and I don't want to go off somewhere without him. He gets lonely too, Victor." John pulled away from Victor to lean on the car and take a deep breath. "I'm sorry." He whispered, he had finally broken. He had just snapped even though he promised himself nothing like this would happen again. "I...I just don't know how to speak up for myself. I've never really had to. I've always been busy sticking up for other people and looking out for other people, even when I was a kid."
"Sherlock is simply being quiet. Though I must commend you for whatever means you devised to keep him that way." Mycroft's face tensed, his lips in a thin smile.
"If he wants to learn starting him off young is a huge benefit." John said with an eager smile. It would be absolutely adorable to see Hamish with a little violin trying to learn how to play like Sherlock. "If he starts now, I bet he will be able to play almost as well as you by the age of ten." He added, hoping the challenge of it all would make Sherlock more keen to the idea.
Hello darlings! This is more of a compliment to the last chapter than it's own stand alone but it is beautiful and should be shared! We have been considering going back and writing a version of Save Him (the first story in this series) that focuses on Mystrade but have not made a definite decision on it yet. If you'd be interested, let us know! ~Holly
"You're the one whose gone sentimental Mycroft. I was already woefully destined for sentiment when John Watson walked through my door." They two of them chuckled softly.
"I know that 'Mish, but you cannot yell." John giggled as Sherlock swiped his hand through his hair, thus lacing it with flour again. Sending the two little boys into a fit of giggles. Sherlock sighed before he dusted the flour from his hair, moving over to two bowls and dropping in a bit of food coloring to make the batter red and green. Mycroft picked up a ladle and scooped out some of the green batter, focused on cooking the pancakes. "John the presents we bought for Alex and Victor are in our closet on the top left."
"Yes I do." Sherlock grinned, unashamed of his behavior. "It was your own fault, letting her flirt with you." He moaned softly, pulling John back to kiss him again.
"Aw, why thank you, John." He whispered honestly meaning it, he lay back against the pillows, his body splayed out in front of John. He brought a hand down to his own hard length and began stroking it with a sly smile. His eyes completely focused on John's as he let his reactions to his own touch show on his face. "Your orders are to stand there and watch, Captain Watson." He said in a low voice, almost growling the words. He winked, a smirk playing at the corner of his mouth as he knew this would drive John mad with desire.
"It won't happen again, I swear, John. I'm sorry it happened in the first place." He rubbed John's back as he sobbed and shook. He started to hum when John finally fell silent. Trying to soothe him in the few simple ways he knew how. "I love you, John. Don't forget that, okay? Even if I don't remember you, it's you I love." He promised, murmuring it over and over until John finally responded.
He slowly opened his eyes and looked at Sherlock. His body a bit tense as he did. He wasn't sure what Sherlock would say if he'd truly heard everything John had just spoken out loud. It was an awful amount of sentiment and John still wasn't sure how much Sherlock actually appreciated. Sherlock bit his lip nervously, turning a bit red as Victor ran passed him and up the stairs. He'd hurt Victor so much, and not only that but both of these men were so in love with him they were both willing to do anything he wanted just to be in his life and that was both beautiful and utterly tragic.
"If you stop acting like such a jerk and lighten up, maybe I will. If Sherlock can be nice surely you can." John's voice was half teasing, half serious. Mycroft was completely out of his element. Just what exactly was this man doing?
. Greg was a fool for thinking he had gotten away with it. What should he tell him? The truth? Wouldn't it only anger him more? He sighed but then looked down to see Hamish holding up the stuffed rabbit. It shorted out Greg's focus on Sherlock.
thought. "I suppose one of these days you will have to tell me what it is you thought about." He was definitely red now. "Oh you've turned me into an idiot." He growled softly, huffing a sigh.
"I know you do." He whispered and then damned himself because that wasn't what he meant. "I know you do and I love you too. So much." He wrapped his arms around him and hugged him tightly. "Don't cry, love. You've cried so much tonight and I hate that I can't make it stop." He kissed the top of his head, not caring if it was sweaty. "I hate when you cry. It tears me apart." He rubbed Sherlock's back in slow circles, hoping he could sooth him.
"We should probably go to bed, it is past midnight." Sherlock said, a smile on his face as he rubbed at his stuffy nose. "But... I really don't think I should talk to him. At least not right now and I'm damn sure not going to tell him about this. That would crush him." Sherlock frowned hiding his face in John's neck for a moment. "Why does everything have to be complicated? Usually I love complicated things, but not like this." John had to smirk at the irony of the statement but Sherlock didn't catch on.
"Aw, so sweet, John. You're precious." Sherlock said with a fond smile as he spread John's legs. "I'm not disappointed, pet. I'll show you how much of a tease I can be in the future. We both know we've been desperate for this moment for some time now, so I don't blame you for being so aroused." He kissed John's knee and poured some lube on his fingers. He watched as a small flicker of fear passed through John's eyes and he smiled. John spread his legs further, silently turning himself over to Sherlock yet again and it made Sherlock's breath hitch in his chest. "Now, first we'll need to stretch you. I may be your Master, but I am a very caring one who doesn't want you hurt." He purred as he slowly toyed with the tight knot of muscle, enjoying the small moaned and grunts John gave in return. He slowly pushed a finger inside his eye burning as he committed this all to memory. "How does that feel?"
"Yes, please!" Victor cried into Sherlock's mouth. He tore his mouth away from to look at John with lust filled eyes. "Please, John. I've thought about it for so long." Sherlock grinned and started to kiss Victor again.
"Hm..." John grunted. He moved into the kitchen and got an ice pack which he slid behind Sherlock's neck. He then slowly prepared the injection and prepped the site on Victor's arm. Victor was surprised at how gentle John was as he gently knelt down and started checking his arm for the proper injection site. He felt John's fingers flutter lightly over his wrist, checking his pulse before deciding he was alright to proceed. "This is likely going to make your arm hurt, Victor. If you start feeling anything like burning or pain in your veins tell me immediately." John ordered softly. Victor found his attention drawn to John's face as he spoke, watching the man as if he might disappear. John gave him the injection, again checking his pulse and breathing as he did. "It's going to be hard but we will help you through this." Victor was in awe, how could John say something so kind when he didn't know anything about Victor? John lingered there beside him for what felt like an age, being sure he settled down comfortably before he moved over to Sherlock and checked his vitals as well.  "Not good, I think you are coming down with it too." He fished in his pocket for the flu meds and gave Sherlock one. "This will shorten the duration. How are you feeling?" He asked both of them, sinking down in his chair both to rest and to watch them.
than John does." Mycroft's eyes flashed possessively, as if suggesting there was some sort of competition between the brothers over whom had the more submissive husband. Greg pulled himself out from underneath Mycroft's pin, which surprisingly took a lot of strength and smiled at Mycroft. If he stayed put he would lose control.
at me. You can just give me a look that turns me into a puddle. You know it too, you've used it on purpose and thought I didn't know." He licked the outer part of Sherlock's ear before gently grazing it with his teeth. "Just relax into it, go with the moment." He encouraged, one of his fingers tracing up the line that followed Sherlock's sternum.
"Always something." He hissed but he let go of John to move to sit next to him. "I'm happy for you, I really am. I'm very proud of you too." He wrapped his arms around Victor and hugged him tightly. John giggled as the two of them bickered but still sort of looked like a school boy caught at something he knew he shouldn't have been doing.
did to him. "When you compliment people like that they think your flirting with them. Which then makes them think they can flirt back. Which they shouldn't be allowed to do because you're-" He was about to say 'mine,' but he stopped himself from giving Sherlock the satisfaction of such a possessive comment. "You're married." He forced out, his voice sounding flustered and breathless.
"So beautiful..." He muttered the appraisal, sitting up slightly to change the angle of his thrusts. "Oh you're so tight John. God yes," He whispered, his hands fluttering over John. "Come apart with me." His body moved relentlessly, almost as if it had a mind of its own. He growled and moaned, just letting the noises come without trying to stop them. "God if you don't move those hips more I'm going to flip you over and pound you into this bed." His voice was a growl of desire as he spoke.
Victor frowned while John was scolding them like the children they were. He hated it, how very right John was about all of it. He realized what he had done and how he had likely hurt John by doing it. His cheeks started to flush with embarrassment and he tried to look away from Sherlock so he could apologize but John yanked his head back up. He whimpered and closed his eyes before speaking.
"What on earth are you doing, Myc'?" Greg asked softly, blushing when John giggled as his use of the pet name.
"Then we can keep doing that." Sherlock whispered, his lips finding John's neck which he started ravishing with kisses. "If you just want to keep kissing then we'll just kiss to the point of exhaustion." He brought his lips to John's again, sucking his bottom lip into his mouth with a groan. John’s breath was ragged and broken, pulling Sherlock easily back into the fluid place their attraction took them to.
"John, if you need anything I'm here." He whispered softly, with a gentleness that surprised John. Though his tone was greatly appreciated.
. The door is locked and my brother and Greg are the only ones with keys. We're safe. It's okay to worry about yourself for once." He rubbed his nose with John's.
"I'm still going to thank you, that must have been rather terrifying." Sherlock said as John worked, looked somewhat ashamed of himself. "Greg and I are going to have to have a very serious discussion."
." His stare was purely indecent as he pulled back slightly, a smirk toying on the edges of his mouth. John's heart began to pound and if he hadn't learned to have better control over himself he would have had a strong erection almost immediately. Thankfully Sherlock's incredible neglect for minding his tongue had quickly worked up John's resistance.  Though as he met Sherlock's gaze, the lust burned in his eyes.
"Oh fuck..." John hissed and his gaze was completely glued to Sherlock and his actions. There was some burn but there was mostly intense overwhelming sensation as Sherlock just let go. "Yes, Sherlock. God, yes!" He grunted. "I did ask for it, I asked for what you're giving me Master. I need it..." He groaned. "Please..." Sherlock let out a moan as his length sunk deeper into John. He gasped, and wrapped his arms around John from behind clinging to him as he held him in place. He stayed where he was trying to let John get used to the stretch before he started to move inside him.
"No Hamish," Sherlock said softly, running his fingers through his hair. "Your Dads have been talking about potentially adopting a brother or sister for you is all. If you're a good boy Father Christmas may still bring you a puppy."
"Of course you can." Mycroft assured him, though he wasn't sure why the child would want to. He suddenly understood the catch to his situation. Greg would want to give Marius a brother or sister to help. He gave his husband a knowing stare as he gently held Marius close. "We'll never be far away." Then it all clicked with John. Oh.
"How do you know it's the people who murdered Hamish's parents?" He asked, his voice very soft as he rubbed his temples. He couldn't even find it in him too be upset that Sherlock was leaving. The pain was too severe.
Victor shook with pain and what might have been a sob but it was hard for Sherlock to tell from where he was sitting. Victor was watching Sherlock as they sent the texts back and forth but his attention also kept returning to where John was huddled under the blankets, only his wrist visible where it held onto Sherlock's shirt. Victor felt a horrible guilt sliding around in his chest and stomach. Was it true? He really sat on the floor, outside his own flat all night? His mind flicked back over the entire scene the night before, how easily John had just bowed down and let Sherlock go with Victor because it was what Sherlock needed in the moment. Everything that man did was for Sherlock - even letting Victor come stay with them and trying his hardest to help him. Suddenly in that moment Victor truly understood everything about how Sherlock felt for John. He started to wonder, instead of finding his own Sherlock he, in that moment, began to wonder if he would ever find his
"I want to try to eat something again." He mumbled but his eyes watched John as he grabbed the needles and bag from under the bed. Part of him wanted to snatch them away from John and run. But he kept himself content in bed by remembering what they had done together in this bed. By remembering what John had so willingly given him. His mind had been blank and it had been better than the drugs. He looked away from the drugs and got underneath the covers even more, using the action to hide the shame flushing across his cheeks. "I need you in this bed too."
"You're adorable to me." John replied simply, moaning as he felt Sherlock respond. He slowly extracted his hands and started undoing Sherlock's shirt. The more John touched him the more he seemed to relax, relaxing was what he needed to do right now which obviously meant John needed to touch him more. Another text noise sounded from the living room but John's attention was turned to his work. He licked his lips, his face betraying pure love and desire for the man before him as he looked over Sherlock to gauge his reactions. "Your ears are hyper sensitive." He whispered, returning to kiss and nip at Sherlock's ear, his fingers now finding free range over Sherlock's chest moving and pushing his shirt back off his shoulders and letting it fall. John was correct, he couldn't help but whimper and squirm while his toes curled as John nibbled on his ear.
"Be careful of your arm." Sherlock reminded John. "Last year's was a bit too short. I will be able to tell better by standing near it. You could barely reach the top last year." Sherlock chuckled because he remembered John being stubborn and saying he would put the star on the tree.
"I forced a piece of toast down your throat before we left the house this morning." John chuckled because Sherlock had cussed at him for fifteen minutes after John had shoved the offending piece of bread down his gullet.
"I'm not brooding." Sherlock argued, trying to his best to focus on his lover. "I don't brood." He mumbled even though he knew very well that he did.
as I say, otherwise…” He paused and bit back both the emotion and the words he really wanted to say. But they were clear on his face. Sherlock could read how he bit back: ‘Otherwise we won’t make it through this.’ John took a deep breath before continuing. “Otherwise you’ll feel really awful. I need answers, Sherlock, answers so I can make sure I am treating you properly.” He stalked upstairs, noting how Sherlock was shivering, and returned with his heating blanket. He plugged it in and draped it gently over Sherlock, turning it on. He then stalked into the kitchen and returned with an ice pack, which he gently slipped under Sherlock’s neck. His gentle touch and concern betraying how much he was actually worried for Sherlock’s health and wellbeing. "Unfortunately you have to wait a bit for the detox medication to get into your system before I can give you anything for the other symptoms. In a bit you can take some Dramamine for the vertigo and the room spinning. It will likely make you sleepy. So before then I need to know how long you have been using again, when you last ate, and how recently you dosed yourself.” He sank down in his arm chair, looking directly at Sherlock as he waited for his answers. He made a mental note that he should eat something himself in the near future, but sipped his tea. “Also, the warmth of the tea might help your stomach, but judging by the faces you made when you ate the cracker I wouldn’t blame you for ignoring it.”
"I am well aware of what I need to do to take care of myself." John said softly, though there was a bit more of the 'doctor' than the 'man' behind the tone. "I am taking medication and doing what I need to. I don't need constant supervision, you two do." He sighed, Victor didn't respond so John looked towards the bedroom. He should probably check on Sherlock. "I'll be back." He sighed and he moved into the bedroom. He moved softly to the side of the bed trying to check on Sherlock without waking him. He wavered slightly, his legs wanted to drop out from under him but he buried the weakness deep down. One of the three of them had to act like a functioning adult and right now it was clearly going to have to be him. It was like having two teenagers in the flat with the two of them. "Love, are you awake?" He asked gently, barely placing a hand on his arm. Sherlock hadn't been but he woke at the sound of his lover's soft voice.
While Mycroft had been showing his son how to pretend Sherlock had been trying to smooth things over with the noticeably upset Alex. Sherlock knew he was uncomfortable with the fact that John and Victor had gone outside alone and he really wanted him to be comfortable.
"Oh please don't." Sherlock flushed a bit and looked down at Hamish, sitting him in his own chair and preparing him a plate of food.
"Just shut up about it right now, Mycroft." Sherlock argued in the same soft stone. He didn't want to give John more reason to be stressed. As much as he wanted to shout and argue, he wouldn't. Not with John so close to having a break down. "I really don't think right now is the best time to discuss it." He continued to stroke John's back trying his best to keep him at ease until the pair were gone. "If you would like, we can discuss this later, but I really must ask you to go right now."
John's phone chimed and he sat almost straight up, making both of the other men jump with surprise. It hurt him to do so and caused a coughing fit, but John was hyper alert. He fumbled for the phone for a moment, having trouble getting it in his hand. His brain was fogged over from the lack of sleep and the deep illness but he still tried to focus. Victor made a move as if he was going to get up and stop John, actually getting to his feet. Sherlock tensed and his mouth tightened into a thin line.
"Hey boys why don't you go wake John and Sherlock first okay? Me and Papa are really tired." He watched almost transfixed as Marius nodded with understanding and turned to Hamish.
"Oh Lord, make a little extra, Victor and Alex are coming." John said softly but he blushed at Victor's flirtation. He wondered if Alex knew Victor still sent him messages like that from time to time. Sherlock turned enjoying the red flush on John's cheeks and deducing the message.
"Don't worry John, it'll be fine." Sherlock said firmly, trying to convince him. Sherlock swept back towards the bed, setting the medicine down on the table. He was going to need help caring for John and accomplishing the necessary tasks, that much was obvious. If he could simply convince John to sleep he would talk to Mrs. Hudson... "You can rest while I get the tree setup and if you feel better after some sleep and your pills you and Hamish can decorate." Sherlock swallowed hard, trying to keep his internal emotional tug of war from showing in his actions or on his face. "Thank you Dr. Evans. I'll be sure he takes them as required." The doctor nodded and excused himself, letting himself out. Hamish wriggled in the bed till he was once again snuggled against John, grumbling when Sherlock tried to stop him.
ever got to see you like this. Only me." He brought the riding crop down for a fourth and fifth time.
"True but that is because you're the officer who arrested him." Sherlock pointed out with a faint smile.
"We're not here enough. Either of us. Can you remember the last time we got to have a night in like this? I do... It was almost a month ago. We're not doing enough for him. Only one of us is with him half of the time. It's never the both of us. He's going to start to think we don't like to be around each other if only one of us is with him." He rambled.
He didn't move because he was half convinced he'd gone crazy, his thoughts were so dark throughout the night he'd resigned himself to believing that Sherlock would never remember. His entire body ached and screamed at him, trying to force him to get up and go lay down in bed. He'd been folded up on the landing for five hours and he didn't dare move now. That hadn't been Sherlock's voice, he was just delirious. "Landing." He called out as loudly as he could. Which wasn't very loudly - before dissolving into a very horrible coughing fit that was absolutely terrible. Sherlock heard the coughing coming from the landing and he quickly turned around hurrying over there. When he saw John on the ground his heart sank. Meanwhile upstairs Victor let the tears come and leaned back as the pain rocked through him. This was his fault. He'd done this. He'd attacked Sherlock and caused John to suffer so much. He was absolutely convinced that Sherlock would kick him out now and no matter what John felt about him there would be no convincing him otherwise. He slowly curled deeper into the bed, hiding for the moment and letting himself suffer the feeling Sherlock's anger and disappointment brought him.
"I promise its worst case scenario." John whispered and pressed his mouth to Sherlock's cheek and jaw, trying to reassure him. "I'm sorry love, but this is the consequence of you using the drugs. I promise to do all I can but for now it's going to be crap." He was blunt but his voice was full of love. "We can do this. Together." Suddenly something clicked in Sherlock's mind and he growled.
"I'm full..." Hamish said in a somewhat sleepy voice. He snuggled against John. "I love you Daddies."
"Not yet, Captain." He whispered, but there was no lust behind like before. He took John's dog tags off and slipped them around his own neck. Then he helped him get his shirt and those boots off. "Now we'll go to bed." He told John once they were both finally naked save the dog tags now around Sherlock's neck. The kitchen floor was covered in their clothes but Sherlock didn't care. They'd clean up later, right now he wanted to bask in the glow of this incredible moment. He took his lovers hand and led him to the bedroom. He curled up against John the moment they were laying down. "We must try to break the plates in the cupboards next." He said with a soft chuckle.
"Dey seem niwce." He admitted quietly before looking back to Hamish. "But I miss my Mummy 'n Da." He said, the tears starting to come back. He rubbed his eyes, hating crying in front of all these people he didn't really know.  Greg wanted to console Marius but he couldn't ignore the text. He picked up the phone and read over the message.
"What I'm thinking currently is that you're under enough stress worrying about me and this isn't helping." He felt awful. John knew that Sherlock didn't mind that he was getting emotional but that wasn't what mattered. "You'll spend hours brooding on this moment; worrying about how broken you've made me when it's not really your fault." He hugged Sherlock even tighter, wishing he could be stronger than this. "I should be stronger; I used to be the stronger one. I'm a solider. I should be able to push all this nonsense aside. I don't want you to worry about me, ever."
"Oh John dear are you ill?" She asked softly, trying to determine exactly how much of their minds the two of them had lost. The blanket fort and broken table were not leaning heavily in the favor of sanity.
"No, I won't mind." Sherlock promised but he kept his hands exactly where they were. "Am I required to let you go though? Because I'm not sure if I can do that, Captain Watson." He murmured into his ear with a sly smile. John grunted, biting his lip. That tone was just...
"I can do that." He assured the other in between kisses. "I can show you how badly I want you, John." He moved his hands under John's uniform to feel his back. Digging his nails into him as they kissed. John growled and kissed him furiously, clawing into his shoulders.
"Marius, my name is Mycroft." Mycroft said softly, shifting him so he could meet his eyes. He gently cradled him and ran his hands through his hair. "I'm afraid your Mum and Dad won't be coming back, little one. They were hurt very badly by some very bad people. They were protecting you, trying to keep you safe..."
"Mrs. Hudson, come have breakfast with us." Sherlock pointed to an empty chair for her. "There is plenty." He smiled warmly at her.
"Come on." Sherlock said softly and scooped Hamish out of bed. "I will make you breakfast. Let's let Daddy sleep more." In the living room Mycroft said almost the exact same thing to Marius as he stood and scooped Marius out of the bed.  Sherlock kissed John gently and strode out of the room, closing the door behind him so the weary doctor could continue his rest. Mycroft smiled as he saw him and the two convened on the kitchen, settling the boys on the counter so they could watch.
"You can't yell at your brother, he is trying to help." He mumbled before pressing their mouths together again, moaning softly. Sherlock smiled into the kiss, his pain didn't seem as bad now. Not when John kissed him and held him like this.
"The number of times I almost..." John shook his head; they'd discussed this all already. They'd talked about how much he wanted to end himself because he'd missed Sherlock, but it truly had been so many times. "It's still worrying to me. I still feel like I am nothing... I'm still going to feel it. Even if I know the truth. I'm sorry it's stupid and childish of me to act like this. But it's hard. I love you and if I ever lose you I won't even think twice about walking out of this life. You are my world and you have been for so long... I love you."
"Sh..." Sherlock whispered softly and he pressed gently kisses to John's forehead. "Hush love, tears will only make it worse. I promise everything is okay. We should be able to catch the murders at this house, get the shopping done, and be back before dinner. Greg and I will be careful and I'll come right back home to you. Everything's okay..." Sherlock's voice was tight, panic rising in his stomach. "Please love... Rest. Mycroft and Mrs. Hudson will help with Hamish you just rest. I'll be home before you know it..." He promised.
"Here..." Mycroft offered it. "I want an explanation Sherlock." His tone was low. "And I want you to go away. Sometimes we don't get what we want, dear brother." Sherlock replied with a smirk. Mycroft didn't intimidate him, not when he was fully clothed nor now while he was wearing nothing but a blanket.
"Sh." John said when they pulled apart because he didn't want to think about that either. "Don't think about that. I shouldn't have even mentioned it." He laced his fingers in Sherlock's hair and held it as he gazed into Sherlock's eyes. "I love you. So much. You know that? Even when you’re on your cases and you can't remember anything else, you have to remember that." He kissed him once more as hard as he could trying to show his husband just how much he loved him. "I want you to always remember that. Just for me, Sherlock. You can't forget that."
"I should help." John said softly and his throat was definitely giving him away. Damn that meant the congestion was going to start soon. "I'll make some tea and help you." He started to get up. "Greg thanks for helping." He fished around for his phone and looked at Sherlock confused. Sherlock blushed and looked away, definitely guilty.
"I'm fine." Sherlock answered but he winced when he stood up. "Oh, I have a fucking headache from hell." He looked at Victor with a smile. "Did we go out last night or something?" He chuckled. "Christ, I told you this is why I don't like drinking love. The hangovers are worse for me than they are for you." He walked over and gently checked Victor's wrist. "How'd that happen, Vic?" He asked with concern. John was trembling as he stood transfixed, unable to do anything other than watch this horrible nightmare unfolding before him.
"You want him too." He whispered to the both of them because he knew that they were all to focused on one person at a time. He moaned as he felt John's hand wrap around their erections. He turned his head so he could watch his lovers kiss. "You're both perfect," He purred before he started to kiss at Victor's neck. John groaned loudly as he and Victor kissed again. At lot of dangerous things were blooming in his mind and stomach but he ignored them in favor of feeling Sherlock moving against Victor. He slowly broke the kiss off and smirked.
"Brooding over the deaths is not going to serve you, brother." Mycroft's voice was stern but soft. "It's going to make you emotional and cloud your judgment."
"This is all I've got. Sherlock doesn't let me keep much in the house - which is probably a good thing. He'd poison it or something and I wouldn't be able to taste it." He tossed it to Victor. "That's the strongest we've got. I can go get more tomorrow if you two are okay enough to be left alone for a bit." John paused as he had a slight coughing fit, ending up bracing himself against the wall. Victor felt concern well up in his chest and made a motion to ask if he needed help, but he shook his head no. "But I can tell you it won't work. The only thing that works is that insanely annoying thing called talking about it."
"It's what being with you has done to me." He said as he slowly sat up with a groan. He wanted more. So much more than that. But at least that would hold him off until later that night. He kissed Sherlock's lips fiercely, desperate to taste every part of him but he forced himself to pull away. "Have to get dressed." He insisted but it was clear he didn't want to. He grabbed his pants and trousers off the floor. "Later tonight," he promised as he zipped up his jeans. "I promise, I'm yours." He buttoned his jeans and moved close to kiss Sherlock once more. "I'll be all yours in our fort." Sherlock's hands had a mind of their own, his clothes readjusted they found their way into John's hair, pulling his closer for more kisses, trembling with desire.
"Really!? I will!" Hamish exclaimed clapping again. "Can we pick out a big tree? Can we get Nanny a prezzie too?"  Sherlock simply smiled a John, his head resting gently on Hamish's as he asked questions.
"I miss him," he whispered. "I miss having him around so much. He used to come around more when Hamish was baby just to help out but he was here. He comforted me. He held me while I was holding Hamish and that felt so much better than holding Hamish alone." He hated this, there were tears in his eyes and he felt like crawling away and hiding. He shouldn't miss Victor so much. He shouldn't have relied on him this heavily. "Now he has Alex and they love each other so much that he never has time to come around, which is fine... It's good that he has his own life but I just miss him, Sherlock. He was my friend."
"Oh God fuck me, yes!" Sherlock moaned. Yes, it did hurt a bit but in all honesty the pain was nothing compared to how mind blowingly good it felt. "Just like that, John. Use me." He cried, his hands gripping the sides of the table. Sherlock's mind was spinning with lust and desire as John slammed into him over and over, matching his stroking with his thrust causing him to moan loudly.
Mycroft watched Greg go up the stairs to the boys and simply sat there, brooding gently as he did. He slipped his phone from his pocket and began texting furiously, arranging presents for Marius to be delivered later that evening. Sherlock simply looked between John and Victor for a moment, furrowing his brow.
"You already slept." Sherlock said a little dully. "Maybe I should call the doctor just in case. Then you and Hamish can nap while I do the shopping." He didn't feel the moment his control slipped but he suddenly was spinning his ring, his eyes narrowed as his mind raced through lists of symptoms, medical possibilities, Hamish's Christmas list, and how to be six places at once.
"No, we're the Holmes brothers and as John has once pointed out my brother's name literally opens doors." Sherlock regained his countenance, not looking at Alex for the moment. "John, take your medicine." Sherlock said in a soft tone but with firmness. He strode into the bedroom and retrieved the bottle returning it to John with water and standing over him with crossed arms until he took it.
"Oh is that so? Well, sometimes you do need to relax and I know exactly what I can do to help you do that." He said with a smirk because he had done it many times, he watched Mycroft closely, enjoying how he turned redder. "All those times when work has you stressed I help you...
"Donovan hurry!" Sherlock shouted as he dropped the phone. He moved over and tried everything he knew to stop the blood and help keep her alive, cursing everything that John wasn't with him. "What's your name?" He asked the little boy as the woman gasped.
"If you're still feeling the nausea you can take something for it now." He said to Victor his attention focused on his water. His body ached, his fever was back, and he felt too much. There wasn't anything he could do, he knew that. Nothing he could say would help Victor through this, but he desperately wished he could. He pinched the bridge of his nose resting his arm on the arm of his chair. Despite not wanting to deal with either John or Sherlock, Victor sighed and walked into the living room. He turned to look at John first, Sherlock catching the gaze before closing his own eyes. He leaned back and let his body relax. If Victor trusted John maybe his being asleep would help him open up more.
"I don't want you to cwy eider. These men are nice. Dere my Uncles and if you wanted dey could be your new Daddies. Dey make the sad go away." He whispered, cuddling closer to Marius. "The bad men are stopped now, 'cause of your Mummy and Da. No oder little kids will get hurted." Mycroft watched almost in awe as the two boys hugged. It reminded him, rather painfully, of the way he'd had to comfort Sherlock when their grandparents passed when he was young. Hamish looked painfully shy but a little happy. "Do... Do you fink we could be friends?" Hamish asked Marius, blushing again. Greg covered his mouth with his hand, trying to keep back the soft cry that escaped his lips. This was adorable and beautiful. He had never seen two small children bond this way before, so quickly, and without judgement. Not even his own girls when their beloved cat died. They didn't grieve together; they all dealt with it alone. But these two little boys were holding on to each other and freely crying, Marius more than Hamish but it was clear a few tears had slipped out.
blushing?"  John asked with utter shock as he turned to register the look on Sherlock's face. He was red and flustered but looked tense like he was expecting someone to pop out of a corner and attack.The brothers were silent as Mycroft came back with the coffee pot and set it down, feigning like he was confused as to why everyone was so concerned. Sherlock crossed his arms defiantly, glaring up at his brother as if daring him. Mycroft simply stopped and placed his hands on his hips, turning his attention fully on Sherlock as everyone else in the room stopped and held their breath. Their faces were unreadable and even their husbands couldn't tell if they were playing or serious. Sherlock refused to eat, primly wiping syrup off his face before crossing his arms again. Mycroft's face settled into a terse grin, quirking one eyebrow.
Outside Baker Street the Victor and John had walked down to Victor's car. He'd had to park a bit of a way down the block so it took them a minute or so to reach the vehicle, which John didn't mind one bit.
"It's alright, it's all fine." John said reassuringly but with the edge of authority. "You're not used to having anyone give two shits, I'm not surprised it seems coddling." John nodded and stepped back. Victor's face betraying some confusion. He wasn't used to having a say in how he was treated. "But I do have to know how you're feeling to monitor which medications to give you. I can't stop all of the symptoms but I can make this a bit easier than it would be if you did it alone." Sherlock went to speak again and John cut him off. "It's alright Sherlock, you don't enjoy being prodded at either." He said with a smirk as he moved over and took Sherlock's pulse. He pulled the ice pack out and took it back to the kitchen retrieving a second one. He was gone for a long moment as he fussed with something noisily.
"Well I really was fine but until you brought it to my attention that I wasn't. I'm cold and I feel very nauseous." Sherlock bit his lip, so nauseous that he would prefer to not talk about it out of fear of vomiting. "Victor may want to give himself the medication, he has... Trust issues." He whispered, trying to distract himself again.
"Do you trust me enough to let me shave you?" He asked with a teasing smile, his voice thick with the tone it got when he was commanding John.
?" Victor asked and Sherlock chuckled. John was watching them with wide eyes, desperate for someone to touch him.
"Greg, hush..." Mycroft's voice was soft, he furrowed his brow. He wasn't sure how to comfort Greg in a moment like this. "Take these lessons forward and make the best of it. That's all you can do. Honor those that fell. Make sure those responsible pay for it. You and Sherlock both will do that. He's just as upset as you are, I can promise you that. He feels like he failed you and made you suffer. He'll never admit it but he does." He gently rubbed Greg's back, holding him tightly. "It's okay..."
"Wait, did you just come out of Sherlock's room wearing only a bathrobe?" Greg asked with a grin at John. Sherlock's face turned a slight shade of red and John just ignored him for the moment.
"I'm fine. I'll be fine." John mumbled grumpily as he moved very slowly to lie back down. He held Hamish close, hating that his son was the one having to comfort him. His brow furrowed in anger as his mind drifted momentarily to Sherlock and worried that he was in danger. He felt the slight shift in Mycroft’s energy though and turned to look at him for a moment. He was going to say something snappish but he seemed to think better of himself and instead said: "Thank you, Mycroft. But I really just need to rest at the moment. Just let me know when the tree gets here. I want to try to help decorate." He insisted. He kissed the top of Hamish's head and gently rubbed his back "My little 'Mish," He whispered softly, smiling as the boy's bright eyes turned up to look at him. "You've been so very good this year. Santa is going to give you everything you want." He promised with a sniff, his tears easing some.
"He didn't tell me. Well not verbally." John sighed and sat down. Putting his face in his hands. He didn't know what to do right now. They were all very ill, stumbling through an emotional minefield, and it was likely going to get harder not easier. "Incline yourself some so you don't cough as much, love." He commanded gently, standing and forcing more pillows under Sherlock's head. "I don't think he trusts me at all really. If he does its only because of you."
"What a child." Mycroft snorted and turned to look at Greg as the door closed on Sherlock and John. "Shall we pull out the bed? The boys will likely sleep through the night. They were both very tired and it has certainly been a long day."
"Sure. Just don't take too long." He curled up on his side while Sherlock pulled John out of the bed.
"I'm sorry that something involving me drove you to drugs. That I didn't figure out sooner..." He was stumbling and he stopped, his emotion threatening to overwhelm him. Instead he focused on explaining what he was feeling. What Sherlock was doing to him. "It feels like tiny electric sparks run through me when you touch me. I hope you enjoy it half as much as I do." He pushed his fingers through Sherlock's hair again, keeping him focused on the sensations of the positive things.
"I'm not a baby, John. You can leave me alone for a minute." He promised his lover with a reassuring smile. Sherlock rested his head against the cool tile shower and closed his eyes as John left to get his things, enjoying the cool sensation of the tile against his skin. But he heard his phone buzz in the bedroom and it made him realize he hadn't checked his phone since the night before. On shaking legs he walked into the bedroom and sat down on the bed to check the messages. His heart stopped once he saw that all the messages he had were from the same person.
"Thank you Mrs. Hudson. Dr. Evans," Sherlock strode forward and shook the man’s hand. "He's in the bedroom. We got into a bad scuffle yesterday. He had to have some stitches in his arm. He refused A&E and had me stitch the wound. He seemed fine last night... But now he says he has a migraine, is cool to the touch, and pale. He's also photo sensitive." Sherlock said all the words very quickly before leading the man into the bedroom. "Our son is with him, just so you aren't surprised." He knelt over the bed and gently nudged Hamish until the boy slipped away from John. "John, love, the doctor is here..." Sherlock didn't know what to do so he just stepped back out of the way and waited for John to wake up and talk to the doctor, spinning his ring the whole time.
"I was being perfectly polite." Sherlock said and leaned back against John. "Once the tree arrives I will go do the shopping." In the silence that fell John’s head began to pound even more but he shut his eyes tight.
"Easy now..." He whispered, holding them for a moment. He walked over with them and pulled out the pirate outfits that Hamish had. "Let's try pirates." He helped the two boys put on the bandanas while Greg cleared away the other toys.
"Oh I'll be fine." Sherlock rolled his eyes but he started eating again. Hamish took Marius' hand in his own. "Daddy?" He looked over at John, ignoring the soft 'aw' noises Victor and Alex made. "Could we go to the park later?"
"Then you've never talked about sex with him. He'll make excuses to get out of talking about it." He whispered with a grin.
"That was what I was hoping you two could tell me." Mycroft sighed and opened the case file, showing them fuzzy surveillance images of what looked like Sherlock and another man talking, exchanging money and something else, and then parting ways. Each picture was labeled with a location and time the picture was taken. Each correlating with one of Sherlock's absences from Baker Street and each taken in a neighborhood that was traditionally considered to be a hotbed of drug activity. "He's been more erratic in behavior and contact with me recently  and he failed to complete a case I asked for his assistance on last week." Mycroft's mouth tightened more, watching as John tensed even more. He was worried the man would snap.
"I...I feel hot." He whispered, hating how childish that sounded but there was no other way to explain the sudden heat he felt. "Or warm-hot-heat..." He mumbled, going through a list of words to find the one that fit the most. "I feel heat when you touch me, John." He said breathlessly.
"My kits still here in the living room, in the top is an oral thermometer." He motioned, not entirely thrilled to hear that he might have a fever. "Damn it, if I have the flu after getting the flu shot..."
"I'll go find him right now; I don't care if I have to search all of London..." John's voice was low, he was half in the room and half onto whatever the next phase of his plan was. "He'll think we're rallied against him if we just round him up and ship him off. Let me try first... Please?" Greg couldn't hide his expression, John was practically begging, and not just begging anyone but begging Mycroft Holmes. He sighed deeply, running his hand over his face. Shite the blogger and the detective would be the death of each other.
person." He let his fingers trace the lines of Sherlock's face as if memorizing it again for the first time. "But the things you do to me don't allow me to hold anything back and I want you to know how important to me you are."
"If you're feeling well tomorrow Victor we can go buy you some more clothes." Sherlock suggested, trying to be helpful. He knew Victor wasn't comfortable in John's clothes. Victor shook his head, not that Sherlock could see. He really didn't want to go anywhere  with Sherlock at the moment.
"You sound like my mother, always says things seem better in the morning." Sherlock stood, nervously looking around the living room. "Where is the bedroom?" He asked and when Victor pointed at the stairs Sherlock took them. "Come on, you know I can't sleep alone." He told Victor once he reached the top. He stepped into the small room with a frown. This room wasn't his sort of place and it wasn't Victor's sort either. He recalled Victor's lavish flat that was more like condo, not this sparse, empty, and barely furnished bedroom. He stepped into the bathroom simply because he was curious and once he caught his reflection in the mirror he frowned. He looked... Old. He touched his face, walking closer to the mirror. "Have I always looked this way?" He asked once he heard Victor enter the room. Was the doctor right? Had he forgotten something? He found a flutter of sadness ached in his chest at the thought of how upset the man had been.
"He's a doctor." Sherlock said moving onto the couch and laying a hand on Victor's foot, trying to comfort him. "He feels like he should take care of everyone else first and himself last. It's a bit mad but I love him for it." Sherlock said without thinking. He bit his lip the moment the words left his mouth, that was really not the best thing to talk about. "I mean... Um... How are you feeling?" He asked, trying to change the subject.
"I said prepare me, you may touch me as you wish. I will let you touch me how you want, but when I say stop you stop. Completely. When I tell you to stop you will bend over that table and present me your amazing arse. Do you understand?" He growled the question, demanding the answer.
"John?" Mycroft asked softly as he knocked softly on the bedroom door.  "Hamish would really like to decorate the tree for when his father comes home. But I wanted to check in with you before we began and see if you would like to come into the living room and watch?" John sat up slowly, trying to ignore the throbbing pain in his head. It actually wasn't as bad as it had been before he went to sleep but it was still rather painful.
"Hamish remembers they were there but he doesn't remember what they look like. It's hard; it's something you'll spend your whole life doing... But he'll be okay. With love he will. Just like Hamish is." Greg swallowed the ache in his chest down and nodded. He could do this. Sherlock and John did it every day. He and Mycroft could do this. Sherlock and John would help. He felt his resolve solidify.
"You fucking insensitive prick." He forced out but his voice was quieter, shaking with his emotion.. "How much did you take?" His rage was not calmed by Sherlock's actions, in fact it was inflamed by them but he tried to calm himself. He rummaged through his medical kit, clearly looking for something. "Could have talked to me," He muttered under his breath, only bits of his inner monologue clear to Sherlock, "No, I'm Sherlock Holmes I don't rely on anyone," A pause as he lowered his breath, "No who cares what anyone else feels..." His hands were shaking, he almost couldn't believe it. He'd faced down killers, bombers, Moriarty, and Mycroft without trembling hands but now he was a mess. Sherlock just barely inclined his head to watch and even he noticed that tremor, but it confused him. What could be going through John's mind that would make him shake like that? "What are you feeling?" Sherlock heard the softness that crept into John's tone. That constant worry that haunted John, especially now. Especially since Sherlock had been gone. But as much as it made him ache to know that John was hurt he also knew he couldn't have gone to John with this. He couldn't go to anyone about his problems. How could he? No one understood his mind. No understood what it was like in his head. He kept his eyes closed as he listened to John rummage around his medical kit and continue to mutter little statements that betrayed just how hurt he was. When John repeated his question asking Sherlock how he was feeling it elicited a low chuckle, which seemed to enrage John all over again.
"I'm sorry," Sherlock whispered as he followed John’s movements. He wasn’t sure the words actually broke free into the room, but he tried to say it. He tried to explain to John that he really was sorry he’d hurt him. As the lights dimmed Sherlock’s eyes relaxed and the burning sensation he’d been fighting eased. He blinked slowly letting his eyes adjust and settle on John to truly observe him. He noted that John had wiped his tears away, but they were still staining his cheeks. His body language was rigid, military like, as he tried to pretend that he hadn’t betrayed any sentiment whatsoever. He was trying to be distant and clinical, things he thought Sherlock would want. It made Sherlock’s heart ache again and he tried to once more to apologize. He tried but the words refused to come out.
He started to text him back, on a whim, he wasn't thinking again but he had to make one thing clear.
