The blocks were tons of fun to play with drawing silly images against the walls. Wiping them away so easily to draw some more wacky ones. It was not only enjoyable but pleasant he didn’t have to think anymore and just had fun losing himself in another world. Sherlock gently washed him from head to toe and they both splashed around the rest of the bath water at each other till there was barely nothing left. He grabbed John's hands and hoisted him up from the bath quickly dashing around him the fluffy towel to keep him warm. In their shared room he massaged John some more and put beautiful smelling oils and lotion all over him. Till his whole body was nothing but a heap filled with good smells. Effectively calming him further down not letting Johns mind to even have a second of embarrassment.
The harsh slap could be hard all across the kitchen walls.
“Sherlock sit down, let’s talk.”
John spent hours upon hours of searching and reading up all about ageplay. Finding the pros and cons and what it all meant to him. He felt just as lost if not more so than before. He still couldn't quite look sherlock in the eye. He couldn’t get over the shame he felt for drinking. He certainly couldn't get over what Sherlock thought of him if he offered this.
John felt like a little caterpillar wrapped in a tight cocoon. Surrounded by warmth and protected in a thick wooly blanket. Coiled deeply amongst himself he felt floaty and light. Falling softly in and out of sleep. A dull tapping on the window slowly brought him back to existence . The life around him began to move. The deep tapping was the steady beat of the rain; it was  strong and smooth, slowly helping him him adjust. The rest of the world was silent, a very rare occurrence in London. He laid there till he was slightly more himself. A deep satisfying stretch finally set him in motion; his mind coming  into an instant focus.
If John were to think about it, doing his normal routine was still the same but there was just a slight difference. It felt nice it didn't feel mundane or some kinda forced type of normalacencey. It flowed with him and got him prepared for the day ahead comforting once again  in it’s familiarity. The only weird thing was Sherlock. For he was in the kitchen with breakfast ready with a hot cup of tea.
A horrible feeling washed over Sherlock like a wave, making his heart pound painfully as though it had just restarted. He gasped a little, incredibly relieved, to the point of feeling boneless. “I'm here,” he replied. “Are you all right?”
Sherlock fixed him with a look. “You love me.”
And because John was so wearied and worried Sherlock struggled to find the right words to tell him of his gratitude and appreciation. “You did the right thing,” he finally said, trying to fill his voice with sincerity.
Certainly that room was at the heart of it all, it was the original, and it seemed this generation was not the first to use it in (non)imaginative ways (what imagination did it require to shut a person in a room to die?), but it hadn't been used for some time. So the killer had moved on, created her own prisons elsewhere, perhaps she had finally realised it wouldn't do to draw all the attention to one spot, for which Sherlock couldn't respect her because it had taken her such a long time to understand it.
Sherlock said nothing. No confirmation, no denial.
“It leaves space for mystery,” John explained. “And since when are you against misleading people?”
Sherlock downed his soup in hurried gulps, while John glowered and fussed and grunted and tidied up in his desultory way. Moving things from one place to another, stirring up dust which only settled somewhere else. John was, in fact, crap at tidying. Sherlock watched him. He always did. His adoration for John didn't diminish the need for observation, or the logical need for distance and objectivity. Sherlock needed to know everything, he needed information to function, and he needed to separate personal from important.
“I was hungry and you don't really pay attention to what's outside your head sometimes. It makes you easy to herd along, like a sheep.” John grinned. “I expect that's why you keep talking to me when I'm gone, too.”
which means ignorant and incapable. Or foolish.”
“Tea's up,” was the next thing Sherlock became aware of. He was still on the sofa, and John was standing by him, holding out a cup of tea. “I think the man wasn't forced to eat that hand, he ate it because he was hungry. That's why he left the hospital in the first place, yeah?”
“Guess I don't.” John shrugged a little and let his hand fall away from Sherlock's face. Sherlock felt ambivalent about this. On one hand he didn't like his face being touched, on the other... John.
“Yeah,” Sherlock agreed, still somewhat perplexed by this transformation. Not that he was going to question it. Was he happy Gibson had been murdered? So actually he was going to question it. “You look… relaxed.”
Sherlock just lay there, propped up against John. On top of the things that had been injured before, now his tongue was a lacerated mess and his arm was cramped up and twitching, the taser barbs having embedded themselves into his skin through the coat and the jacket and the shirt, and he had probably hit his head as he fell. He could have gotten up, he could have told John off and ranted, but he chose not to. He very pointedly chose to stay down and tried not to choke when John (roughly) inspected his tongue with his no-nonsense scowl on.
A more troubling facet of the group behind the doctor was that they knew too much about Sherlock's business. His phone number, for example. And the fact he had been to a strange manor house a month ago, a house that he'd been unable to locate ever since. Satellite images showed no trace of it and revisiting the site had revealed a park in its stead. And Mycroft, usually smug when he knew more than Sherlock, remained quiet. ‘The house that doesn't exist,’ the doctor had called it.
“If by dirt you mean decomposed and decomposing... garbage.” He couldn't be sure without closer examination of its composition. He had a piece of John's notepad in his pocket, the page with all the phone numbers. He bent down to quickly scoop up a sample of the compost (gloves on) and folded it into the paper, slipping it back into his pocket. “Do you see any dates on the papers in the piles?”
“Do you have proof?” Lestrade sighed, giving up.
He sat up and limped over to the desk and waited for John to notice.
“Do I even need to say it?”
“Hey. Hey…” John quickly put his cup aside and snatched Sherlock's away before he spilt it. Then he placed his hands on the sides of Sherlock's face and held him in orbit.
A long silence followed during which John swallowed this explanation, and Sherlock could follow each tick of John's mind. First the familiar denial (‘no, that can't be, nobody dies of madness’), then anger (‘ought I punch you in the face again?’), followed by bargaining (‘I'll give you that if you let off about the hat’), depression (‘why can't I be as clever, the code number was right there on the bulletin board’) and, finally, sweet, sweet acceptance that John released into the atmosphere with an exhalation.
“And then you involved yourself in the matter with poor Edward,” she continued and picked up her cup of tea. The steam rose around her face in vortices. (How was her tea still that hot?)
Sherlock tried to light another cigarette but that was plucked from his fingers as well and then John dug into Sherlock's coat pocket to get the pack. “No,” he said, crushing the pack in his hand and throwing it in the nearest bin.
“You mean while breaking and entering, though I'd like to point out I'm not breaking anything, merely entering,” Sherlock said as the lock clicked open and he stood up. John was about to say something but Sherlock overrode him. “When is a better time? We're alone now. That's when people have these conversations, isn't it? When they're alone.”
What brought Sherlock back to himself was his legs giving out from under him. His ribcage caught him on the sink and his forehead smashed into the mirror. The pain, although uncomfortable, was enough to ground him. He wiped condensation off his face (no blood, mirror unbroken) and took a breath filled with steam, wet and heavy. He pushed off the sink and staggered to the door. Opening the door caused an indraught of cold air which made him shiver and his skin erupt in goosebumps. Even his hair was damp from the steam.
In the previous years Stanley proved to be a good student but he also made moves on Sherlock which weren't reciprocated by the latter for the simple reason that he didn't understand what was going on.
He smiled and kissed my forehead and said, “Not yet.”
student and
"Interesting. Have you frozen in shock or you really don't mind it's appearance?" muttered Sherlock while trying to bend her neck.
“I’ve a few things to tell you about.” said he with a grave expression on his face.
Stanley, who was very silent until now started laughing and shouted, “Me too!” and got a laugh and high-five in return from Sherlock.
“Pretty much.”
“But I want to rest and cuddle with you.” said I, almost whining.
He smiled and said, "I heard you shouting in your sleep. Nightmare?" I seated myself in my chair and nodded. He handed me a cup of tea. I looked at him with surprise but took the cup anyway. It was too cold as if from yesterday "I made it for you last night."
“What in the world-”
“Let’s start simple- whatever that we’re able to see, is it the exact moment in real time or has it already passed?”
His clothes looked like they were taken out from a garbage bag, his beautiful face was battered with something black and he looked even more thin.
Lestrade had barged into our 2BHK, annoying Sherlock who always preferred a quiet atmosphere when he was thinking.
Thankfully I had wrapped myself in my bathrobe and was just opening the door. After I had put on some clothes he said, “Today we’re supposed to do what you’ll say until 5 p.m. After that we’ll be going out for a dinner which I’ve specially arranged,” his smug but subtle smile soon following.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
“No.”
" shouted Sherlock with a huge smile.
I didn’t let him finish that wretched sentence as I put my lips to his and after breaking apart said, “Sometimes you are just the romantic but then again you also fuck everything up with your stupid cold-heartedness.”
“Just go away, Sherlock.”
“Well, one, to tell everyone about us and, two, to shout ‘In your face’ at Stanley.”
“Since when do you care about attires and stuff?”
“You’re only excused for today. So, have anything for us to do together?”
Not that we had never gone out but whenever we had, it was either because I was all over the place or after begging for it a lot.
"Yeah, so I'm coming."
“Now, the other thing.” said he as if whatever I had said went unheard.
"Oh," and after a long pause he said, "Want to know about the bent woman's case?"
“No.”
“I gave you enough time to rest in the plane. Get up and if you want to change then do the same, cause we’re going out.”
“l thought we were again doing the commander thing.” Said he with a smug smile, evidently satisfied with his retort.
"I thought he was going to steal our groceries." said a thoroughly dejected Sherlock.
“I’m bored.”
“Rain soon, right? Not raining. So get up, NOW!” with that he got up and went to his bag.
’ and ‘
He smiled and hugged me.
I smiled as the Sherlock everyone knew had returned. I got up and got dressed. It was almost twelve and he was as annoyed as he possibly could be.
On thanksgiving, we had a big fight of sorts on his usual absence on Christmas Eve. I had firmly told him to be present at seven in the evening on Christmas.
“Well, well that’s enough my little piece of chocolate.”
“Oh, um-”
“No, I mean yes but the word I was looking for was- yes! Abnormal.”
Finally, I put my hand on his lips and said, “You are such a romantic,” with a sarcastic smile to which he said nothing but tried to remove my hand.
John,
I quickly removed my hand from his and put it in his back pocket. Without missing a beat, he put his arm around my waist.
The few days after Christmas were really, really great. Until he had that Watson’s case (no, not me). Before leaving he said, “Guess now I’ll be thinking of some other Watson,” and smiled while I hit him playfully.
“Nice?”
“What is it, brother?” asked Mycroft with his head resting on the table.
“Yes. Now, shut up and let me give you that dessert before dinner arrives.”
I snickered and said, “Nothing.”
“You know since our hearts are in sync and I don’t want to break-”
I said, with face buried into his neck, “What’s wrong?”
“Why don’t you then?” said he, raising an eyebrow with a mischievous smile playing on his face.
It was after two hours of a lot of investigation and thinking, some flirting and rejection that we left the premises for the morgue and Sherlock seemed excited. "Are you happy to see the body again or you picked up any leads?" asked I, adjusting myself in the uncomfortable seats of the cab, to which I got the reply, "Both!"
Well, at least my guy was truthful and open, which always gets confused with too straightforward and rude, but that’s okay as I understood him. I texted him to stay safe to which he, obviously, didn’t reply.
His demeanour suddenly changed. He put his hands on his knees and leaned in my direction. His eyes had a certain gleam in them which I had never seen before.
"I had some newly freed space in my brain” said he smiling.
I quickly made my way to the bag. It had a tux in it, I really can’t imagine how I missed this beautiful thing.
“Let’s go, Sherlock. It would relax you for a while given how disturbed you’re with this case.”
"Why did you buy it for me? To wear, right?"
After about two hours, I had calmed myself down and was ready to confront him.
It was nine now and he still hadn’t even moved an inch.
“Well, then I care about you.”
“Yes, John?” came his reply almost as deadpan as ever.
I stared at him with an open mouth which he closed by pushing it up with his right hand. I thought for awhile before saying anything, “I don’t think you’re entirely wrong but since when do you know about the universe and stuff?”
It was a cold and windy Wednesday night. The howling of wind had woken me up. I went to get some water and saw Sherlock sitting on the sofa, in the dark. I turned on the side lamp and sat next to him.
“I don’t drink,” came a curt reply from Sherlock.
“I was thinking why are we even alive? Why doesn’t the human kind just end? Are my works of bringing justice in vain when man is itself the enemy? Also, given that the universe is so big and still expanding, are all my worries, efforts and talents useless? Isn’t man useless in this so big a space? Taking into account all our tries to study the dynamic universe, don’t people understand that we are just an accident and there’s nothing to really boast about? Their petty problems, reasons and feelings are just nothing. Yet, it seems like it’s everything. Do you follow me, John?”
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
“When? How?”
“You’re crying. Did I do or say something wrong?” said he with still trembling hands and perplexity in his eyes and features.
The next morning, I went to work sharp at seven in the morning and returned only at nine in the evening. I couldn’t see Sherlock so I had my dinner and went to bed. The same thing happened for the next few weeks and I saw very little of Sherlock.
I sighed and said, “Just come back.”
“How do you-”
Well, I guess somebody had played with his brains. I sat behind him with my hands around his waist.
“Sorry but it looks like it’s going to rain soon.” said I, sitting up.
His features quickly changed and he again looked the confident and witty man I knew and liked. He came closer and put both his hands on my neck and kissed me.
“Yes! Make hot chocolate, play some movie and cuddle.”
He kissed me but this time it was gentle and calming.
“Oh.”
"But, you- you-"
“MPD?”
After about an hour, he went out and sat down with his tools to fix the door ignoring my every plea to answer any of my questions. Soon I gave up and went to make dinner, completely annoyed. He was done very soon and then came into the kitchen and hugged me from behind. I didn’t pay any heed to whatever he did next and it took a lot of effort for the same.
“Shall we?”
. "Trust me, John, you wouldn't want to see it. Everyone either fainted or puked after looking at it, except me of course." said Sherlock, immersed in his investigation which involved bending in weird positions to which Stanley kept staring and it further annoyed me. Not even thinking about it, I said, which I thoroughly regret, "I want to see it, well, um while describing the case we need a body, right?”
“Don’t worry. We’ll do things to keep up with it.”
“Nobody told me to get dressed.”
A tear fell on the paper which, was mine. I hadn’t expected anything so deep and vulnerable from Sherlock. He snatched the paper from my hands and I looked up to him. He had confusion and alarm on his face.
“Yes, Sherlock, yes it is completely alright.” said I, trying to soothe a man who I thought didn’t have feelings, until now.
“Yes, Sherlock?”
“Packing is done. All the other errands are being carried out as we speak. You can relax and let me do my work." I nodded and went away into my room, thinking who the hell was the man in our living room.
“It’s just eight in the morning and I’ve called them at ten.
“Doesn’t matter.”
“Almost the same. Again, I don’t keep count.”
“I don’t follow you. If you don’t want me to leave then why do you say so?” confusion evident in his voice.
“The more the merrier,” said Sherlock, only to annoy Lestrade.
I took his hand in mine and we walked out.
And so Sherlock returned to his case and I, at arranging the groceries.
Sherlock looked really pleased at this remark and shied away and then drifted off on the table.
“I’m sorry.” said I, nervously laughing.
“How do you even don’t know how to make a thing as simple as soup?”
I got up to go to my bedroom but Sherlock sat where he was.
“I know the spelling of holiday. And yes, lying about the same won’t-”
He shrugged.
I went away to enjoy a hot bath.
The apology part was scribbled with a pencil. I looked up to him and he smiled. He bent towards me and put his right hand on my left cheek. I slapped it away. Surprised by this he sat there like a child who was denied of his chocolate bar. Taking pity on him I said, “Try again.” with a smile on my face.
I chuckled and got up to take a look at the menu and sat in his lap. He put his head on my chest and closed his eyes.
He looked at me for awhile and made a weird face, “Why in the world aren’t you dressed?”
He asked me to stay with him in his room when he tried to sleep. I got our sheets and everything into his room and made us some crepe which we ate in silence. I brought the book I was reading and sat beside Sherlock on his bed while he tried to sleep. It took him two hours to fall asleep. Thankfully, we had retired to bed early so he could get a good night’s sleep. Or so had I thought.
“Today we’re just going to walk, hand-in-hand or however you wish to.” said he, smiling.
“Well, how do you see a man, with long and equal strides, soft voice but firm manner and not very elegant but neat clothes, and are not able to deduce that he’s an army or an ex-army official?”
And we danced for almost an hour before following the rest of his idea.
“Well, I was scared.” said I, smiling.
I was stopped by his finger pointing to the front door where two bags stood.
“If you were already dressed doesn’t mean that everybody else was.” I smiled at his observation.
“Sorry, I’m so sorry.” cried Stanley while moving his hands all over Sherlock, which maybe was to clean the coffee but, the hands also went where there was no spill.
“Yeah, shut up. Even that gets annoying. You’ve been using it for some 200 years now.”
He returned with two glasses of water. He handed me one and then drank from the one in his hand. After finishing he said, “You remember you asked that if I could see any doubt in your eyes and I replied ‘No, but-?’ ”
“Do you have any knowledge in the field of psychology?” asked he, crossing his legs and leaning back.
“I heard you.”
“I’d rather talk to you.”
I was supposed to exercise everyday, right after I had woken up. He had prepared a daily routine for me and if not followed well, then no Sherlock for me that day. All this was to boost my stamina and immunity, which had really deteriorated. It was really funny, given that I’m supposed to be the doctor amongst us.
“Conducted by Christopher Chabris and Daniel Simons when studying inattentional blindness. Want me to explain it?”
“Before you get all grumpy, I want to make it clear that he keeps trying on you and it makes me angry.”
After a few minutes of me glaring at him and he completely ignoring them, he came in and took hold of my hand, dragged me into the bedroom and shut the door behind us.
He rubbed his eyes and said, “Whatever the fuck happened to waking me up with kisses.”
Sherlock turned to me and whispered, “Now’s the time, my dear Johnny.”
“Yeah?”
After all the avoiding I had missed him.
I didn’t even know our destination. You might think that I’m stupid but if you have a leopard as a companion, you can’t even catch glimpses of your own ticket. After being seated in the airplane, Sherlock elbowed me to my seat and was talking to the air hostess. After a good five minutes he came and settled beside me.
“I know, from before we found each other the world tore us apart and we had to rebuild the pieces. This is bringing up deeper issues you have never dealt with and have hidden away from yourself.”
“Oh! John your-“
Remembering what happened the night before brought an intense blush to his cheeks. For his very first time it had gone surprisingly well. He didn't feel babied at all and just oddly felt cared for the whole night. He was even able to let go a little after a while and truly enjoy the experience. Not only that, he was shocked by the amount of care Sherlock put into all this. Making sure every single step was comfortable for him as well just truly being caring. He didn't have to think for a moment and the world seemed to slow down. All in all it was a weird feeling, maybe it was more odd than weird being cared for in general.
“Sherlock what are those?”
"Hmph haha ah", Sherlock screeched and tried to avoid his boyfriends' infurious anger! He ran around the flat avoiding Johns rath and making a mess in turn. He got through the easy part now the real game was on.
Ok from now on I will be updating once every two weeks on Monday. School is a pain in the butt and it’s no longer summer so I don’t have the most of time anymore. Anyways I’m so glad everyone loves the story so far. I’m pretty happy with this one it is late so please forgive mistakes you see. Wanted to post this one before Monday’s over. I realized writing this has helped me out so much and taught me a lot so far. It’s really cool. Thanks everyone and see ya later.
“John let us fully contemplate on this and I would gladly help, if you let me.”
Never say John can’t be observant.
"Caring sometimes I forget you have such a big heart underneath that genius brain of yours with that sharp tongue."
“Heh.”
John looked shocked for a moment even surprised but then his face cracked and he smiled wide before laughing.
"For as long as I live I will neve- WHAT !! Three times the hell you mean three times."
Slowly mycroft turned to him. Cooly assessing him and knowing which words to help strike his point home. “I know what has been going on lately with the drinking and the fights. How he mentioned ageplay as a healthy way to cope with adult life.”
“Anyway I got it so you could perhaps find a way to distract yourself; should at any point you feel embarrassed.”
“Surely you can handle something as simple as a double homicide or are your lakys just that stupied.”
He didn't know what to say for a few moments. Shocked by the sweetness of it all. He couldn't bring up the issues right now. Not with how happy John was today it's been a while since he saw a genuine smile on his face.
“Why do I want to do this?”
And now, seeing that same pain in Johns eyes?
( I rewrote this so it would sound more like from Sherlocks point of view I think I did good.)
He heard the quick, light, fluttery steps of Sherlock working his way up the stairs. He put down the volume of the tellie and waited. As the door opened with a burst of air automatically being filled by Sherlock presence.
A sharp pitched ringing in Johns ear eventually woke him. The dull throbbing pain in his head kept him down. He peeked underneath his lashes at the stream of light coming from the window, immediately closing them again with force from the sudden shock of light to his eyes. It seemed to strike the back of his brain and rocket to the front. He groaned and fell back into the abyss of sleep and no pain.
He should’ve known nothing good last forever.
"Let it go, John, I only did it three times."
“What if I’m just an experiment?”
Sherlock has to take  a moment to steel himself making sure his emotions were kept under control. He have to do this next part delicately if this was to work.
"I’m going to fucking teach this kid a lesson he’s fucking six! So him shitting and pissing on the bed should be over with I’m not raising some sissy!"
A stiff silence settled between them like a thick and heavy blanket. Despite the pains and aches John felt everywhere, he still squirmed under Sherlock’s heavy gaze.
“Shhh- John it's okay if you're not ready we can still call this off ” he whispered in a quiet comforting tone, a hand cupping his cheek as his thumb wiped off silent tears.
"No!”, placing his hands on Johns shoulders looking him directly in the eye, ”I really need you to be open minded. "
For severely moments nothing filled the room
Pailing slightly he looked at him trying desperately to put on a poker face. “Yes.”
"Hound should be suitable."
“Right.”
One afternoon when he was on a walk after work. A balck van slowly drew towards him. The driver getting out, swiftly opening the door. By now he knew the drill and didn’t even wait for the driver to say anything before getting in. they drove to Mycroft headquarters. The city of London passing by in a blur. He only grew more irritated as time grew. Not wanting to deal with Mycroft's shanganes about his brother. From spying on the cctvs to the occasional kidnapping of John. To update him on the health and well-being of his brother.
Sherlock has an impressive poker face but he could see the hint of sadness behind his eyes. With a touch of something deeper underneath the surface.
“Wow I didn't even know they made stuff like this,” he remarked in a whisper like wonder.
“I don't care if your worried about your brothers well being with me or that lately that we've had a bit of a problem between us. It doesn't matter that you care in your own weird way. It does not give you the right to spy on us on to yell at me when things don't go your way! I am not your little scapegoat! Dont you dare start analyzing me with your stupid patronizing stare, I’m a soilder dammint not your little lap dog!”
He put his hand flat against the door and pushed, it creaked but didn't give. The door was wooden, crooked from damp and sticking against the frame. The lock was old-fashioned and brown and corroded and the rust had ran down in rivulets under it. Sherlock gave it another push, then stepped back. Lestrade stood below them on the stairs, radioing the people behind the wall.
Despite his efforts John's expression went somewhat suspicious, which Sherlock then attempted to dissuade by leaning down to kiss him. “You did the right thing,” he repeated although he disliked repeating things. “Which is what I need you to do,” he added to explain. He had barely moved his head so he spoke from his lips to John's lips.
“So.” John was looking at Sherlock, avoiding eye contact with the walls. Sherlock had to admit he didn't much like looking at it either. “That means whoever did this had access to that house for a long period of time. Maybe the previous owner?”
“We go to the source. Obviously.” Sherlock gave him a look and limped on with the too short cane.
“You're just my blogger.” He couldn't let John have the last word.
Experiments were, in general, something that Sherlock approved of. He was aware that John made a difference between experiments performed on dead bodies, parts of dead bodies, bacteria, sponges, foodstuffs and household items and those performed on living things, humans in particular. While Sherlock saw no need for animal cruelty, he had no reservations about human experiments. They yielded the best and most interesting results. Humans were a very self-interested species and all their experimentation was to benefit themselves in some way, and as objectionable as human rights activists found it, experiments performed on humans gave the most relevant data about humans.
“I called him and we went out into the city to look for you. He somehow managed to wrangle you down once you got yourself into a fight with some bloke, The pub nearly called the cops on you if Lestrade hadn’t had his badge on him. You would’ve went to jail last night and we would have to use Mycroft's credit card to bail you out.”Sherlock’s last line made himself snicker a bit.
“No.”
Do you even-” but I couldn’t go any further for the waterworks had begun and I went into my room and locked the door.
We had breakfast as planned with our three friends but Stanley was surprisingly well-behaved and was even happy for us.
“Other than enjoying the company of my love, nothing much.” said he, in his usual tone.
I couldn't believe my ears.
"What did you say? Wasn't all this a waste of your time and energies and what not?"
“No, it’s fine. But yeah at least tell me what the fuck was really happening when you had broken our door.”
“Well, let me call your mother for the same.”
“No, that’d suffice.” He talked to me in his incisive and cold voice which he usually used around everyone but me. But I didn’t really mind it as I was too absorbed in the conversation.
I quickly got up and went to look for another t-shirt. Soon I heard him chuckling. He came out of the bathroom wearing a blue shirt and previously worn grey pants with black converse whereas I was wearing a checked black shirt on dark blue jeans with white shoes.
’ When he came back up an saw the expression on my face, he frowned.
“Why?” said he, with an unimaginable softness in his voice.
“How so?” said he with a puzzled expression.
I got him some water and tea. He said he wanted to freshen up first and so did the same. He came out wearing black pants and a light blue shirt with his blue dressing gown. With naked feet he came and sat on the sofa, near me.
“Okay, I do like you. But if you don’t, um, understand and feel the same, it’s totally alright.”
He had said that he’d try to return before new year’s eve but that was just because I had made him repeat it after me. I knew very little of the case as he had left so hurriedly but the brief facts were: Watson was being blackmailed with some of his photos with different ladies, just sipping coffee. But the client seemed so scared only by looking at those photos that he couldn’t even utter a complete sentence. Sherlock had only gone there because Lestrade had said that the new evidence is very promising. What the new evidence was, I didn’t know.
I texted both of them and they were already on their way.
He helped me to my room but when we realized that Sherlock had zero knowledge in taking care of someone, I was carried to the sofa.
His soft but robust lips caressed mine as if his life depended on them. His tongue slowly found it’s way into my mouth. His fervor affecting me, I put my hands in his hair and gently pushed and pulled. I felt his smile. Suddenly, he pushed me down on the sofa and I was staring up at him. With one quick kiss, he stood up and held out his hand to me, “Care to finish this in the bedroom?”
“What?” said I drawing small circles with my left hand on his thigh.
“Oh yeah,” he said nervously laughing and I saw him clenching his right hand into a fist, “ I had informed you that something big was going to happen. I had soon found out what it was and who was behind it. As they learned that their secret was exposed they tried to kill me. But they thought you were Sherlock and were making their way to our home when I called out to them and pretended to be sent by their boss. They believed me, pathetic fools, as I said their boss’s name and for a just in case had to put up a little drama to entirely convince them.”
I went near him, careful not to make any sound. He was still in his yesterday's clothes which aroused unknown desires in me. Well, unknown only with respect to him. I knew he had dated no one, which was because he thought it was not essential. It's even a puzzle to understand how he knew that he was gay. I went and sat next to him. Even this did not wake him up which meant I was free to do anything.
He smiled again and said, “The feeling is mutual.”
But soon he took over and now I was following him. I didn’t think that he would’ve been a better dancer than me, not that I was some world class professional dancer, but the man who thought eating is a waste of time must not know how to dance, right?
When I woke up, it was almost seven in the evening. I couldn’t see Sherlock or for that matter, anything. It took sometime but I soon saw that he was in his recliner. I got up and switched on the lights. I guess he was thinking about something because he didn’t even wince when I did the same.
“I’m sorry, John. I didn’t mean to make you cry. I shouldn’t have written-”
“When do we leave?” asked I, to a slightly irritated Sherlock who was trying to read some sheets of paper.
Well, now let’s jump to the present.
“I see. How can I make you to pay attention to me again and maybe happy?”
“No, Sherlock, there are no buts. I trust you and I know you’ll never let anything happen to me. Even if something does happen,” I placed my hand on his right cheek, “I’ll never blame you, nor will you. You’ll get that bastard and kick his ass.” said I smiling, but with tears in my eyes.
evidence was a garbage bag with lots of money which Watson had himself put out. He was simply trying to distract us from something big that’s going to happen. So I’m going to check on it too. I’m sorry if I’m not there when you wished me to be.” And he hung up.
I removed his shirt and saw that the blood wasn’t his but it was being sprayed out from a bag. As soon as I saw it, I fell on the floor while that idiot kept smiling. I stood up and said, “
“Well, as you know that nothing you do would harm me but you’re still scared. It’s the same. You just get caught up in the moment.”
“Sherlock.” I shouted from my room.
He was texting someone, very fast, which was unusual because one, never texted and two, even if he did it was with the speed of 1 word per minute. I wondered who he was texting and as soon as he saw the waiter heading towards our table he put his phone in his pocket and smiled at me.
“Now, time to return all the kisses I got for no apparent reason.”
He grinned like a child but quickly gave it back to me.
” shouted I and almost carried him and carefully seated him on the sofa. “What the fuck happened? Let me take your shirt off and bring the first-aid box.”
I saw him removing a neatly kept formal vest from his bag and frowned.
"I thought I saw an insect." said I, again lying.
“About all the things I’ve hidden from you and have never paid any heed to your questions regarding the same. But now, I guess, I can answer all your questions.”
"Do you want to watch a movie?" asked he, at eleven in the night. Maybe he wasn't able to sleep.
“What do you want for dinner?” said he looking at a small book which I presumed was the menu.
I couldn’t take it anymore and with one hand almost lifted Stanley and threw him out of the apartment. After slamming the door on his face I turned to Sherlock who was sitting with both his eyebrows raised.
I was trying hard to maintain a straight face but when he burst out laughing I couldn’t control myself.
I rolled my eyes. “Have any other ideas?”
I smiled and wiggled out of his grasp while he was staring at the ceiling.
He looked at me as if I had said something really stupid. After all the staring he went out without a word and I followed suit.
“What you looking at my brother for? He’s one of the most manly man amongst us.” said Sherlock, laughing every now and then, “He lost his virginity when he was only thi-”
You all are familiar with Sherlock’s habit, or should I say, hobby of arranging a little drama to prove a simple point.
“Sherlock, that is one of the best things you’ve ever done. And don’t go snatching it like that. I will really punch you hard if it tears up.”
“Sherlock?” I whispered. No answer.
He didn’t say anything but let out a sigh. I thought he’d never reply, as usual, but unexpectedly he spoke, “I love to hear your heart beat. It might sound weird but I want to hear it when I’m sad or happy or angry or just every time.”
“Do you think that it’s-” and he suddenly stopped.
I didn’t release him and spoke in the same position as before, “I don’t know how to explain you this. Huh, consider this. When you think someone is going to harm me would you stay by my side or go away?”
“Why did you leave?”
As he said it, I dropped the sheet and took to the nearby chair. I tried not to think about it and drew in huge breaths to calm myself down. There goes tonight's sleep. He quickly covered it and threw it back in it's place. He looked at me for sometime with that analyzing look of his. "I'm fine. Just- let's just go" said I, trying to stabilise my shaking legs. He nodded and we both went out.
I couldn’t help it as a smile crept on my face. After playing the song once more he put down his violin and said, “Do you believe in ghosts?”
box displayed which Sherlock was just going to click on but stopped when I snorted.
Sherlock was a man who always wore shirts. He always hid his spectacular body (which I thought he had, given his strength) under layers of clothes. I had bought him a number of t-shirts and yet he chose to wear his boring shirts. Last Christmas, I bought him sweatpants and a sports tee but he didn’t wear them either, so I finally gave up. As for me, I liked to be in casuals.
“I’ve told you to wake me up whenever you need me.”
It was a beautiful Sunday morning. I had just woken up when I saw Sherlock making tea. It really was a great sight. Cute butt moving gracefully, hands so fast as if catching fish and mouth uttering countless curses to anything which didn’t behave as expected. I went and stood beside him.
I kept questioning him but soon gave up and you all know why. After walking for about an hour, we went back to our room. It was getting dark outside and we had this spectacular view of the city from the window.
“Just wanted to know. And how long without sleep?”
“If you say so.” said he, smirking.
“It’s open, Locky.” I giggled like a small girl but soon shut up feeling embarrassed on what I was doing.
His white shirt was completely red in the torso region, the bleeding had taken away all the color from his face and he was very weak in his legs.
He told me to sleep but I refused and told him that I wanted to take care of him. He argued that I could look after him even by lying down but I refused. He gave up. He tried to sleep but couldn’t. He soon got up and got his violin. As happy as I was to hear him play, I was equally unhappy with him for not resting. But it was too much to ask from Sherlock and knew I had to be content with his three hour nap.
I had no answer, so I stood up and turned to go but his voice stopped me. "John," the firmness in his voice was enough to stop millions of John. I turned to face him and to respond with a lie, "I was looking at you. I rarely see you sleeping." said I with a smile.
“Yeah as if after last time I was going to drink that.”
Nowadays, it was hard for me to look away when he was looking at me and his words seemed like melted chocolate.
“Nope, 5 minutes and 48- 49-”
Sherlock had this baffling case at hand and he had requested me to come. It was almost nine in the morning and I was completely dressed but, and for the first time ever, Sherlock was late.
“Hmm. So, who was behind it?”
“Shall I call Mycroft and Stanley as well?” asked I.
"What?" said I, not able to catch much other than the aforementioned words. Sherlock glanced towards Stanley clearly stating
"Sure." said I.
I snickered a bit but was crying inside.
“Why?” replied Sherlock with a disgusted expression.
He picked me up and carried me to the bedroom. After throwing me on the bed, he pounced on me and engaged in a battle of tongues fighting for dominance. He was fumbling with shirt buttons when he said something which was quite weird and maybe about himself. I don’t remember it quite well as the next chain of incidents were quite interesting. I replied with, “Bite me.” He plunged down and went and did exactly that. I was feeling somewhere between ‘
Be carful in the beginning there might be triggering words or just the one. Read the authors note at the end.
“Ok.”
"Now before I say anything I need you to be open minded. "
Me and Stanley were the only one sober. Mycroft was used to drinking and was pretty much the same. After Sherlock and Lestrade went unconscious, we concluded our little party.
That shut me up and I slowly explained him the process of how to make soup.
“What are you thinking about now? Didn’t you just solve the Goldman case?”
“What now?” said he with exasperation.
“I’m all ears.” said I, digging into my food.
“Okay. Why don’t we start with a great breakfast?”
As soon as he had seated himself, I kissed him. A long passionate kiss which he returned with equal intensity, saying more than he could ever do with words. After parting, I said “Don’t you ever leave me like that. Even if I say so.” and hugged him. Though he didn’t return the same.
“Um, thanks?”
“You didn’t have your lunch. Why?”
Sherlock was sitting on the sofa with his tea in his hand which wasn't to be drunk until he had made up his mind on whatever he was thinking about.
He looked up at me and smiled, “Well, a lot of doing Sherlock and a bit of doing things.”
“Please move from my left leg. I kinda cannot feel it.”
At 12:15 am, on New Year’s, he called and said, “Happy New Year. I love you.” and hung up. I smiled at his little ways but suddenly realized that he had said I love you.
I put my head to it and screamed and soon was a trembling mess. I locked the door and sat with my head to it. I didn’t understand what this sudden burst was about. I knew I missed him a lot but this was pure rage.
“Doesn’t matter, it’s here for you whenever you wish to hear it even if I’m not there.” He smiled though sadness was somewhat evident in his eyes.
“Apologize for what?” asked I, and drew my head to his chest as another wind blew past us.
“Good.” And he smiled and disappeared into thel livingroom and soon I heard his violin playing.
After about ten minutes, he came out and I was totally mesmerized.
I went into the kitchen and made myself a cup of cold coffee. I was making my way to my recliner when Stanley unnecessarily stretched his leg and I tripped and half the coffee fell on Sherlock.
“Has already passed.”
I smirked and sat on the bed staring out the window while he placed the order. After hanging up, he sat on the chair and took up the newspaper to read. Only in a few minutes he set it aside and looked at me.
“I’m listening.”
“Shall we?”
He said that I should order. I knew some of his tastes, which were very few because he hated food altogether. I ordered the same for both of us and we sat in silence until the food arrived.
“Are you sure you’re really a human?” as soon as I said it, I laughed.
“Recently? No.”
After being forcefully removed from Sherlock by Sherlock, I asked, “But why?”
I woke up at seven, on a hard and warm chest. On looking up I saw him sleeping peacefully to which I smiled. Even when asleep his hand was tightly bound on my waist, prohibiting me from moving without waking him up.
“No, I
This left me speechless. I knew he worried for me but caring was a very big word. I guess I blacked out for a second because when I returned Sherlock wasn’t there.
“Sweet. You guys married?” We broke from our kiss to see an old lady smiling at us. Before I could respond with a no, Sherlock replied, “Not yet.”
The rest of the breakfast, we sat in silence. He drank his tea as if it was water and then later remarked that his tongue felt numb. He seemed distracted with something so I proposed to go out and do some outdoor activity to which he didn’t deny or maybe couldn’t deny.
“Nothing. Just that it wasn’t something I told you to do, I was just replying to your statement before.” I let out a laugh and he got up from above me to perch himself beside me.
“Don’t disturb me.” Said he and kissed me on the forehead and then pulled on his sleep mask which had weird hearts on it which made me snicker.
We were in Amsterdam. It was already three in the afternoon and Sherlock looked in a hurry to get to the hotel. After arriving at the hotel, we were almost dragged to our room where our luggage joined us shortly.
When I moved closer again he kissed my forehead and walked away to the phone and said, “Now let’s order the main course. The dessert is almost ready.”
It was a great room with a large window at the end and a bed facing the same. Decorated with all the essential furniture for a bedroom. Overall, it was a sweet place for a temporary stay.
“Same way, when my emotions are harming me. I want you by my side.” said I and kissed his neck.
I can’t say that my health was getting any better, given that I was in constant worry for that idiot who once had thought that it was fun to blast the kitchen, just because we didn’t use it that much or maybe there was some other reason which he thought was best not to tell me. That was the day since when I had started cooking for the both of us.
“Why are you here then?”
“Fine. You order for the both of us, I’ll go shower.”
“Stop damaging my brain cells.” came a very angry reply.
He had borrowed Mycroft’s bike. “Why didn’t you tell me about the bike? Now, wait here I’ll go bring my jacket.”
I shouted, “
“I’ve these- these visions, these assumptions that you’re sick because of some old villain whom I put behind the bars. It scares me, John, when I think I might be the reason you die.”
“No, it was pretty good.”
“You sleep too much. I’ve waited for 10 hours and 27 minutes to tell you something.” said he, glancing at me from time to time.
“What?”
I informed Sherlock that I was going to sleep, just as I had finished the soup, to which he asked if I wanted to hear a story, which I think was sarcastic, though his expressions were very genuine. I said no, regretting the same.
I haven’t packed. You haven’t packed. And what about all the things we have to do before leaving? It’s already twelve and-”
The next morning, almost at eight, I saw him on the sofa with his head tilted back and hands in the middle of his legs which were outstretched in front of him. Eyes closed and breathing softly. I saw his phone, it had Stanley's unopened
I lifted his right hand and placed it on my chest while put his left hand on his chest and stood there silently. He soon realized that the beats were synchronized and his eyes widened a bit.
While I was a fragile little fellow, the last night’s ‘At your own risk’ was for some reason. I felt very weak in my legs, my head spun if I tried to do pretty much anything and almost the whole time, I felt nauseous.
“Though your little speech made my profession look even more stupid than I thought it was.” said I with a nervous laugh.
, to which Sherlock replied, "Yes, it's so hot in here. Somebody please go and check the thermostat."
which either held a lot of good things or a lot of bad ones.
“Isn’t looking after someone and trying to help them, caring?”
Whatever it might be, it was a lovely morning.
“Yours.”
Hopkins and a few others were already there. The room was too hot and Sherlock was already out of his jacket and much to my disappointment Stanley saw him and uttered
“No.”
“No, I don’t even-”
“Shh.”
“We shall.”
message, which told me that the case at hand was solved and which also explained Sherlock's current state.
“What’s wrong?”
“Then how is it the same?”
“I’m sorry, John.” said he while putting his hands around me.
The room was dimly lit and the light from the screen illuminated his face. I, very badly, had to control myself from devouring him right then and there.
“Sherlock?” said I trying to control the inner rage.
“How long have you gone without food?” asked I while making tea for the both of us.
“Then why did you close your eyes every now and then?” asked he, turning towards me.
brother,
I went to take a shower while only thinking about what he had just said. After finally being dressed, I sat in my recliner to seriously talk about the holiday.
“Well, then let’s eat.”
“I did and a lot. But what just happened, and your ignorant behavior has upset me.” said I with anger evident in my voice.
“You might want to wear something nice for the dinner.”
He slowly raised his eyes to meet mine and in a low voice said, “That’s for dessert, sir. What do you want in the main course?”
“Oh, I made this one.” said he, genuinely smiling after the incident.
“5 minutes and 58…59”
He had popcorn in his hands which were only his, according to him, because they were in his hands. I told him that it was stupid logic to which he said stupid or not, it was logic. It was a horror movie with pieces of comedy here and there.
Mycroft was already present and we were soon joined by a person who looked as if somebody had sucked the life out of him, i.e., Stanley.
“Sherlock, did you eat something funny?”
Are you asking me out?”
Hearing those words made my eyes lit up and I replied enthusiastically, “Yes! Sciences of human brain and it’s functions, especially those affecting behaviour in a given context. I loved it and wanted to become a psychiatrist but couldn’t dedicate myself to7-8 years of studying and decided on settling for a general physician. I don’t really regret it but you know how it is when something you really wanted isn’t with you. I do read a lot about it and still can brainstorm with any psychologist/psychiatrist. Do you have any knowledge regarding the same?”
“Really? You are taking me on a
"Oh, it was when I was someone else." replied a smiling Sherlock.
"Why did you wear it?" asked I.
“Is this what it is? I mean you’re going to propose here, aren’t you?”
“John.”
“Shut up.” And I turned to face the other way and soon fall asleep.
“No. Something’s going on. The Sherlock Holmes doesn’t just take some John Watson on holidays.”
"Quite so."
As our relationship grew older, I realized that love and attention wasn’t something that was absent from Sherlock’s life but it was something which he required in abundance. As for him, the biggest realization until now was that I loved flowers because they had a nice smell and created a romantic atmosphere and not because they helped in the process of reproduction of plants.
“Yes. Dancing with you, then a nice dinner and finally sleeping peacefully together.”
“On the streets.” he said it so simply as if it was his second home. Well, who knew, it might as well have been.
It was three in the morning when I heard Sherlock shouting something in, which I think was Japanese.
That was the last I could get out of him before he went back into his deep thinking. I returned to my room and as soon as my body touched the bed, I fell asleep.
is one able to see doubt in someone’s eyes?”
“So, what’s the occasion?” said Mycroft and took in the whole glass.
I smirked and well, he was doing other things with his mouth.
Sherlock had texted, called and read but no case was of interest so he was pretty much on a holiday which was the ‘worst thing to happen to someone’ and is ‘really boring’.
“Did you not miss me?” said he with a very soft voice which I couldn’t ignore.
“Doc, I guess then I’ll have to shoot the both of us sometime,” said he, his expressions changing back to his cold self.
"Who would want to steal groceries?"
, his pectorals were almost tearing the tee. To easily paint a picture of him for you guys - he looked like Chris Evans from
Almost ten days gone by and I missed him a lot. I had many a times picked up the phone to call him but didn’t want to disturb his focus, so had put it back down. I was sitting in my recliner thinking of how childish he could behave sometimes but then also become the man of my dreams. I remember when we had first met I thought that he had a multiple personality disorder but soon understood that’s just who he is. A witty, innocent and arrogant bastard.
“Oh, nothing so serious. I thought of having breakfast with Mycroft, Lestrade and Stanley. Could you please stay home for that?”
I turned my attention to the crime scene, might as well do some work. In a minute I realized there was no body. "Where's the body?" announced I, not really expecting any answer from anyone. "Trust- no- you- I know-" began Sherlock and Stanley together.
He was wearing the grey sports tee that I had got him, black jeans and brown sneakers. His biceps were visible to me for the first time- which were just
Now all eyes turned to Mycroft except Sherlock’s who was still eyeing Lestrade.
“This behavior will not continue without serious consequences.” Sherlock said, his arms folding over his crossed legs. John stared at him numbly, a tiny hint of  strange emotion flashing behind his eyes. “You’ve been hurting lately, John. However, at this rate you will develop a serious problem! Addiction already runs in your family!” John could easily read the emotion on Sherlock's face, and it was anger.
“Yes, amazing what the modern age can do if only they put their minds together,” A sly smirk playing at the corner of his lips.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Right, that would have been way better especially with you poisoning my tea."
Sherlock quietly ushered him into some pjs. His face flushing with embarrassment as he helped put them on. They were decked out with stars and planets; they were baggy all around his torso. From the fuzzy soft material they were made out of. They were soothing and warm and felt like security agonist his skin.
The slow creak of the door boomed in his head with force as he watched Sherlock come in.
He woke up suddenly, hearing his heart beat a mile a minute feeling just as scared as if his dad was right in the room waiting for him to scream. So he could beat him again for being a wuss, for acting like a baby. He didn’t register he had to go until he was almost bursting. Barely managing to reach the bathroom before he pissed himself. A now common occurrence whenever he gets these nightmares. The sudden feel of a loss of control that terrifies him to no end.
“Lestrade came?”
“You deserve to feel PAIN.”
“What am I, if I do this?”
"In for the case of Baskerville, we let fear and misjudgment guide us into… heated exchange words that still borrow deep; if we were honest with each other and just talked it out things would have been better."
"Ok."
"Not as important as of the issue at hand."
Sorry this was a day late guys.
“What the fuck is wrong with you?”
“Okay would you like to eat something while we watch a movie?”
“Clearly I wanted to talk about this under... better circumstances but I can no longer put this off.
The minute the door closed words were spewing out of his mouth before he could even think about them.
"Mmm.. yeah?"
Be carful in the beginning there might be triggering words or just the one. Read the authors note at the end.
“Wha-“
“Sit down,'' he said with a sharp clip of his tongue. “If your done ranting I would like to speak with you properly like an adult.”
“A smirk lit up upon Sherlock's face, “Don’t worry as long as you feel safe.”
Threw out his little story Sherlock slowly raised one eyebrow up clearly not knowing about my recent nightmare. Usually when my nightmares come about he tries to calm me down either by cuddling me or playing the violin. I have long gotten used to or lack thereof for Sherlock’s need for sleep. So when he wasn’t in the room that night, fortunately I was quiet.
John can you keep an open mind for me?”
“Never stopped me before won't stop me now. Plus now that I have my handy doctor at my side taking  such good care of me. In fact you have done wonders for me already.”
For a long moment John just stared at Sherlock in silence cearly overloaded by the information. Sherlock could tell he didn’t know what to make of the situation or exactly how to feel. John was easy to read at times, at others... You didn’t quite know exactly what he was going to do.
They smiled softly at each other both surprised with today’s events.
"Wh-"
“Ok.”
“My pleasure.”
Sherlock left the room without another word. He snatched the painkillers from the table and swallowed them down quickly. After doing this, he went to wash up a bit before he was required to address the problems he had caused the night previously.
John snapped his mouth shut, shocked. When Sherlock first created the safe word, he never would’ve believed that it would be Sherlock using it because of him.
John looked stressed once again with a touch of anger in his eyes. He clearly thought I was going to tell him to go to rehab. “Huh- yes I can but what exactly are you proposing?” His voice turned stern and heavy, “I’m not going to rehab I’m not that bad yet!”
How was he supposed to bring this up?! He spent the better part of several days in his mind palace. Dozens of thousands of scenarios came flashing through him trying to find the best solution with the least bit of consequences.
An awkward silence fell over the room and neither were quite sure what to do about it.
“Good, I would be more than a bit embarrassed if I did.” A hasty chuckle went along with the glow of his face.
“I don’t understand. You asked me to leave and judging from your tone you seem angry even though I completely followed your instructions.”
He was making lemon water. On asking why, he said that he couldn’t think of any other way to apologize. We drank the lemon juice in the kitchen and then he took my hand in his and walked me to the sofa. He made me sit down and sat down beside me, still shirtless and with that bag of fake blood. He removed the bag and handed it to me and motioned me to look inside. There was a slip of paper which I opened. On it was written:
He looked up and stared at me for an answer but when I didn’t speak for quite a while, he frowned. I smiled and stood up. His face grew pale but when I held out my hand he grasped it in a fraction of a second. I beckoned him to stand up, which he did.
After dressing up we both looked like some model taken straight out of the Vogue. At least he did. He was wearing black pants, white shirt on it a maroon tie and finally a black formal vest. He had folded his sleeves which made it even more great. I was wearing a light blue shirt and on it a beige tux with matching pants.
It’s very different. I don’t keep forcing myself on you.”
"What do you know? Maybe you’re gay that’s why none of the girls stay.” said Sherlock, his voice becoming squeaky from time to time.
“Tomorrow, 7 a.m.”
“As you wish. Do you have anything to say?”
“It’s okay if you don’t want to say it.” said I, looking up at him. He smiled and kissed me and I kissed him back.
What’s taking you so long?” shouted I from the living room.
I knew he’d wake up soon so I decided to think on why was he acting, well, the way he was- in the same position. I didn’t really know much about the big case. Something must’ve happened there. Maybe he was acting and putting up a little show for the villain. Maybe the suspect was in this hotel. Maybe he was going to propose. Or maybe he really wanted to show how much he loved me.
He looked at me with very sad eyes and dropped his head back on the recliner. I almost ran to him and sat near his feet with my hands on his knees.
“Can you, for once, not be staring at me with that weird expression?” said he and I looked away bashfully.
“Hence,
“Know anything about the invisible gorilla experiment?”
I was very annoyed at Stanley, who didn't miss a chance to flirt and touch Sherlock. "Why do you work with that Stanley?" asked I, after an awkward silence, well maybe only awkward for me.
I handed over the file to the diener but she didn't even notice it as she recognized Sherlock. Letting out a sigh, I followed Sherlock. He seemed to perfectly remember where the body was kept and opened it himself. I lifted the sheet off of it's face and understood what the other people went through. My hand just froze somewhere over it. Not that I hadn't seen ghastly wounds but this was, just a ghastly face. It was a woman, in her late twenties or so, eyes still open. The horror was in her neck. It was unusually long and halfway through, it suddenly bent a good forty-five degrees. Her face also had the most wretched expression as if some inhumanly power caused her end.
“You.” Said I plainly and looked at him.
Soon, I was really bored. The seat on the other side of me was empty and Sherlock sat in the aisle seat, preventing me from making any small talk with others. I put my head on his shoulder and draped my left arm around him. I felt him smiling and soon relaxed. I guess I fell asleep cause when I woke up I had an overly annoyed Sherlock looking down at me.
We were about to leave when Sherlock pulled me closer to him and whispered in my ear, “We’ve a lot of fun ahead of us.”
I heard a knock on the door within minutes of hanging up.
He just stared at me as if saying, ‘Did I bring you some 300 miles away to do the exact same thing that we did back home?!’
When we reached the apartment, I went straight into my room and slammed the door behind me. I only came out for dinner and didn't even bother to look where Sherlock was. At midnight, I heard our front door close and therefore came out to see who it was. It was Sherlock, in the grey tee. As soon as I saw him I went back and closed the door. Later that night, I heard him knock on my door but I pretended to be asleep. I felt Sherlock shaking me and shouting to wake up and I suddenly opened my eyes. He said that he needs my help as another murder had taken place, of the similar kind as today's. I argued that I already felt weak in my spirits and body so I couldn't be of much use but he pressed on. Finally, I got up and got dressed. We hurriedly left the apartment and I took my gun with me. On arriving at the scene somebody said that the body was gone and they couldn't find it anywhere in the near abouts, Sherlock muttered something about incompetent allies and made his way to the crime scene. Whereas I was still frozen in my place, not by the news of the missing body but by hearing my name in a street which was almost empty. I tried to move but couldn't as if something was gripping my legs, I shouted for Sherlock but soon the darkness enveloped me and I could hear someone say my name clearly as if from just behind me. I slowly turned and found a woman staring at me with that bent neck. I tried to shout for Sherlock one last time, before I began to give in to unconsciousness, I could hear footsteps and shouting in the background but was too cataleptic to respond.
“What is it?” asked he with his usual grave expression.
He got up from his recliner and sat next to me on the floor. I guess I saw his trembling hands but he quickly put them between his crossed legs. He looked at me for awhile with confusion but suddenly making a decision he said,
He had called a few people and it really seemed that something was wrong but then he walked to his bag and took out a slip of paper. He walked towards me and handed out the paper to me. Before I could open it he said, “I read all your works about our cases and some on our daily life. I wanted to do something really nice for you and I kept trying to find the one thing that’d really make you happy but I failed all the time. If I tried to behave like other men, you thought I was being abnormal, if I took you out for a walk you thought I was being weird, if I said I love you- you lectured me about commitment and a lot of things which I didn’t pay attention to, if I listened to your every word and followed it properly you asked me if I was sick and when I said that we might get married in the near future you got all panicky and threw so many questions at me. I couldn’t think of any other way to please you so I finally gave up but as soon as I did you seemed really great about it. At last I decided to do nothing and wrote you this, straight forward and abstracted. Go on, open it.”
“So you care about ghosts?”
“I asked Mycroft about the changes in my behavior which are: thinking about you when I’m on a case and caring for you. He said maybe in the future I might start liking you.”
"Sherlock, I'm going to get us groceries. Will be back in an hour or so."
“So, what’s up?”
He sat on a chair and was removing his shoes while I was already on the bed, staring outside.
“I don’t want to do things. I want to do Sherlock.”
“Are you not- Oh, when did you record it?” asked I looking at him.
He looked up at me and said, “What?”
“Well, I know that you like me.” As soon as he said the same I was almost choking on my food and coughed a little. I could feel his penetrating gaze on me and he pointed at the glass of water which I gladly took.
“What are you talking about? I’m behaving as a perfectly normal man.”
“Well, all three said that they-” Lestrade was rudely interrupted by Sherlock who said, "Shut up, we aren’t here to listen to your shit. All ears my way-” said he as he took in his fifth vodka shot, “
I couldn’t join him because of my poor health. Even a bit of exertion would make me a zombie. I posted a notice in my clinic regarding the same and was just walking home when I heard my phone ring. It was Sherlock.
I kept the tray on the side-table and sat on the corner of the bed. I slid my fingers on his bare chest to which his eyes flew open and in a fraction of a second he had hands on my waist and had brought me to the other side of the bed, next to him. The next few minutes I was flooded with kisses which made me forget the intention of causing disturbance in his sleep.
“I don’t know.” said he looking up to me.
“What do you want, Sherlock?”
“No, but-”
And then I woke up with a start.
“Shut up. I’ll be out in a minute.”
It was no use as he was already downstairs and I heard the main door close. I followed him hurriedly. He already had a taxi ready and was getting in when I came down. I couldn't take my eyes off him while he was engrossed in his case.
"But Stanley would be there and-"
He was pulling on his pants- well, he was actually quite struggling with them, slipping every now and then. I smiled at him. The great detective who can catch any criminal in a matter of time, the man of my dreams, the little but equally competitive brother and the darling of my blog readers- couldn’t put on pants. I stared at the great sight in front of me for a while and then turned my attention to the newspaper. Sherlock had taken in the breakfast and was eating it when I set the paper down.
“Elaborate on any mental disorder of your choice.”
I saw that a site was loading up and had the
“No, we don’t do that when you run away somewhere or when I’m angry with you.”
“That holiday is the worst thing to happen to someone.”
,” came a curt reply from Mr. Focused.
“What song is this?”
“Then, why were you so scared yesterday?”
“Hey, Sherry!” said I. Sherry were one of the few names that I used to annoy him.
Turns out he knew me better than I did myself, given how immersed I was, in both him and my work.
“I just wanted to spend a few days with you.” Said he nervously smiling.
. I was confused and asked Mycroft about the same. At first he said that you wanted to kill me but I said that it isn’t possible so he told me that you possibly liked me.”
I sighed and smiled at him while fastening my seatbelt. Then bended over to hug him and kissed him, “Aren’t you the cutest!?”
Shaking my head on my own stupidity of expecting an answer, we walked out of the apartment.
"Also why did you put your hands in my hair and neck?" asked he with an expression of a very confused man.
“Does anyone want anything from the kitchen?” said I, as sweetly as possible.
“Did you fall down on your head?”
and it actually helped me sleep.
“You told me to go away but I wanted to stay near you. I couldn’t think of a better place than the streets so I stayed there until you called.”
Then came Christmas and I received my long awaited gift.
After exactly a minute, “
“Yes, clearly.”
"It's nothing." said I and for the rest of the ride stared out of the window. Sherlock looked at me for awhile and then got back to thinking about the case.
, I’ve wanted to say this since I was fifteen and I guess now’s the best time.”
We decided on horse riding. He looked cool in those knee breeches and all whites whereas I looked like a teddy bear strapped in ropes. He readily disagreed with the lowly opinion that I had of myself but also laughed. I had learnt horse riding when I was a kid and the lessons came back to me easily while Sherlock was having a hard time. At first it seemed he was really getting it but then his horse threw him on the ground. After two more tries he picked another horse which really liked him and then he was riding as comfortably as me. After that we visited some local shops and before we knew it, it was already time to return back to the room.
Sherlock flashed his
“It’s about time to put on seatbelts and you were sleeping so peacefully. I couldn’t decide on if I should wake you up or not. When I finally decided on the latter and tried to buckle up your seatbelt myself- I woke you up.” said he, exasperation clear in his voice.
“Why so suddenly?”
“What? Who’s
And I laughed.
We’ve more than an hour to ourselves,” He smiled his mischievous smile.
“Then?”
Something was definitely up now.
He woke up at two in the morning and went to the toilet. Hurt his toe on the way back. I was still in my sitting position and somehow today had become a light sleeper. So even when he moved his leg, I woke up. In the meantime, I tried to tell myself that I just had a crush on him which would eventually go away but when I looked at him all these thoughts seemed mere lies.
“Then what you just did can be said as one John throwing out another John.”
“No fair. You get to look all hot and-” his lips shut me up. After we parted he said,
“Where the heck were you?” said I as I took in his appearance.
I called the clinic and asked to only inform me when there’s any emergency. As such for the last few days, I had had very less patients. I went out dressed in casuals but with the most charming smile I could put on.
“Mycroft also said that if you have any questions you could contact him.”
“Yes, Sherlock wants some iced tea,” replied Stanley.
“Work.” he said without looking away from the screen.
We had a long talk ahead of us.
The rest of the night was pretty fun.
“Well,” said I crossing my hands in front of my chest, “I’m gay too.” All raised their glasses and shouted ‘Cheers!’
“I don’t think that more than five minutes have passed since I left you alone.” said I with my voice filled with exasperation.
“Hmm.”
“Please make me some soup and bring sheets to cover me.” said I.
“How do-”
“No need to. You can stay close to me, as such I’m not wearing one either.”

I let out a sigh and made my way towards the telephone.
“But I guess, I will.” said he walking out of the door.
He stood there for awhile and a few minutes later I heard the front door close. I suddenly wanted to cry. I walked into the living room and towards the door.
I sat there silent. He didn’t say anything further but raised an eyebrow.
“So, what’s up?” asked I, as I put my head on his shoulder.
“Sure.”
, not at all. You showed that you do feel. And as it was for me, it made me immensely happy.”
He stiffened on hearing my words but quickly relaxed and said, “What some John Watson? Also I just wanted to apologize and spend all my time with you, for a few days.”
“The complete sentence was: No, but
“I don’t feel like eating, Sherlock.”
“Well, then try me.”
“I’d rather prefer the streets.” said he bluntly.
“No, I’m not up early. You’re the idiot who’s awake late at night.”
“Aren’t you going to sleep?” said I, with unnecessary softness in my voice for which I mentally kicked myself.
Our apartment was a cozy little place. My room was opposite to Sherlock's on the second floor. The first floor was accommodated by Mrs. Hudson and the ground floor was to park cars, which nobody had.
“It’s almost 10.”
in this month!” said Sherlock laughing as the drinks had taken over him.
“What about my daily routine when we’re on our holiday?” asked I, removing my sweat drenched clothes.
“Nevermind I-”
It was a Monday morning and I was supposed to be at practice early but I had overslept and was now hurriedly dressing up when I heard Stanley’s voice from the living room.
“I did. I was just pondering upon the existence of human life.” said he, slowly opening his eyes and facing me.
He played a very, very sad song which I couldn’t recognize. He usually played with his eyes closed but today they were fixed on me. Observing the confusion on my face he asked, “What?”
"Oh. Thank you." The rest of the day I felt like a criminal and was avoiding Sherlock at all costs.
I got a call from the clinic and was away for rest of the day. When I came back, I saw Sherlock with his laptop,  typing furiously. I decided to freshen up first and then talk to him.
