“Here you are, one coffee, cream, no sugar.” Sherlock was back. He sat down the other side of the bed and handed John the mug.
“Did you do something with your hair?” Sherlock asked, nonchalantly changing the subject in an attempt to cheer his friend up.
Sherlock packed quickly and left the house without saying a word. He didn’t shed a single tear, which half surprised him and half didn’t. He’d spent many long years training himself not to show emotion, and not to dwell on it because it was a weakness that lead to situations like this. John loved him, of that Sherlock was sure, but it also seemed clear John was ashamed and embarrassed by his feelings, why else would he want to hide them? And Sherlock could understand, when he looked at himself he couldn’t find much to be proud of either. He waited outside in the cold for the cab and thought about how lovely it would be if the wind could reach inside and numb his heart, just as it was numbing his fingers.
“What?” John snapped out of his thoughts and finally looked up at his former flatmate at this sudden switch in the topic of conversation. “Er, yes,” he stammered. “I tried to do something a bit… nicer with it, I suppose,” he finished lamely. There had been a time when John took pride in his generally smart appearance and minimalist style. But when he became a single, working father, who solved crimes with his best friend and blogged about it on the side, the effort he put into be fashionable had been one of the first things to slide. He couldn’t remember the last time he’d actually stood in front of a mirror and fixed his hair but, as he was going on a date, he had done so that night.
“I’m human John, of course I get hungry,” Sherlock replied with his usual slightly exasperated tone.
“Yes, that’s right, but that won’t be an issue anymore,” John continued, sounding irritated now, “Because this morning Rosie asked me if this princess was going to be able to discuss life as a foreign dignitary and affairs of state. And when I said no, the princess would probably just sing some songs and play some games, Rosie said she wasn’t interested in a princess that wasn’t historically accurate and if she couldn’t have that she wanted a science party.”
“Ah well, chin up. Happens to the best of us,” the bartender told him in an understanding, good-natured tone. “I’ll close out your check then?”
Rosie thought for a moment. “That’s nice,” she said finally. “I love you both. I’m going to bed now. Will you come tuck me in, Daddy?” She directed this last question at her father who was standing stock still, watching the scene with shock and anger.
With Rosie and Mrs. Hudson departed, John walked over and collapsed into the chair beside Molly, taking his own head in his hands.
Then, however, Sherlock hung up his phone and turned to look at John. They’re faces were so close. John was staring right up into his vibrant blue eyes, getting lost in them. He glanced at Sherlock’s mouth, at the perfect cupid’s bow of his lips, just inches away, and the urge to lean slightly forward and kiss it was almost too much. There was no stopping this, but John knew he at least had to try to hold it in.
“I’ll be going then. I know from experience I won’t be wanted here,” Mycroft said dryly, his voice only just showing his tiredness and relief at the good news.
“You think that went well?” John fumed. “What the bloody hell came over you Sherlock? You just blurted it out! You had no right-”
“This is funny, you know,” John commented suspiciously, as they sat down and picked up their menus, “Because you never get hungry.”
“Yeah seems so,” John replied. “He told me I needed to think about what I was getting into with you or I might break your heart and he wasn’t going to let that happen.”
“Good,” said Mycroft smiling again. “Because I believe this is your stop. John realized then they had just pulled up to the cafe. He got out of the car and as it drove away, he turned and found Sherlock standing before him.
“I thought it would be better if she played in the guest room considering the state of things down here,” Sherlock explained as he walked in after Rosie. John looked around then, and realized that Sherlock’s experiments and research had taken over the whole main floor of the flat. There were chemicals, bones (probably human), a couple of knives and some rather frightening images of corpses, scattered everywhere.
“I’m really worried about him. I think he’s been kidnapped” the woman choked out, tears beginning to leak from her eyes, as she finished her story. As a parent himself, John felt for their latest client; he didn’t know what he’d do if Rosie ever disappeared.
John felt this was all a bit much but Sherlock had whipped out his phone with his free hand before there was time to protest. As he sat there while Sherlock spoke to the operator on the other end, John contemplated his current swell of feelings. He thought about how much he was enjoying having Sherlock take care of him and how he was getting an odd rush from sitting so close to his friend, but he didn’t want to think too hard about what this all meant. He’d been having such strange emotions around Sherlock lately. He thought he recognized the almost electric feeling, but he couldn’t bring himself to admit that it was attraction. This had to stop.
“It’s stupid, I know, but I didn’t know what to get you and I was at the chocolate shop and I saw that and well…”
As a note this chapter is about sex but nothing is described in detail 'cause that is just not my thing, there's lots of other fics for that though lol
“I really am impressed,” John said again, washing off the last bowl. “I had no idea you could cook like that.”
“Because we’re in love, dear,” he told her carefully. “We were going to tell you, but we wanted to wait for the right time.” Sherlock knelt down then so he was on Rosie’s level. “How do you feel about that, Rosie? It’s ok if you’re surprised.”
“Well alright, I suppose we can handle this one, eh Sherlock?” Lestrade said. THen he gave John a pat on the shoulder, “Feel better mate, and don’t hesitate to call if you need anything.”
John Sherlock and Rosie head to the beach for a weekend away... but there's some rocky seas ahead...
“I thought that’s what this weekend was. I thought here, away from the rest of our lives, we were going to be ourselves, together, as a couple,” said Sherlock quietly, almost dejected.
“No, silly that’s only on Fridays,” Rosie said, with the exasperation of someone much older. “These are my Valentine’s for my classmates. There’s one for everyone, even stinky Roger Clemens, because Ms Jones said we had to bring one for everybody.”
God sorry for making you all wait for this, I know that was a terrible thing to do to such lovely readers.
He and Sherlock had been called to a case by Lestrade: a dead woman found in an alley, just off a busy shopping street, lots of blood and two purses so possibly there was another victim somewhere. It might have been a robbery but the fact the diamond engagement ring was still on the woman’s finger and both the purses they’d found had wallets with money (although it wasn’t much) but no ID’s, pointed towards this being more than just a random crime. That was what made the case interesting to Sherlock and it was why he and John were currently in the alley with Lestrade and his team, trying to lend a hand.
“Thank you again for looking after me last night,” John’s voice was sincere and his eyes showed a depth of love and appreciation that blew Sherlock away.
John of course knew Sherlock could be attracted to both men and women, as John himself was. John had always known he was bisexual, but after suffering months of incessant taunting and bullying at university because of his first relationship with another man, he decided to keep his sexuality to himself. He knew this was probably neither right nor emotionally healthy but he got used to it.
“Let’s see if you can guess,” Sherlock replied mischievously as he started to put the dishes back in the cupboards. “Did it remind you of something?”
“Still though...” John trailed off. Sherlock might think nothing of it, but John liked that his friend remembered or at least noticed little details like that. It meant Sherlock was paying attention to him. Of course John knew his friend did pay attention and care but sometimes Sherlock made it easy to forget this. He would keep his kinder observations to himself, seeing them as irrelevant, John supposed.
“No, you’re Sherlock Holmes and you forget about food all the time,” John retorted feeling a bit annoyed himself.
“Daddy, Sherlock look, I’m all ready for the party,” she cried. She was dressed in a bright floral sundress and over that were a child-sized lab coat and a pair of safety goggles that barely stayed on her face for they were much too big. They both melted at the sight of her, so excited, so proud, and God how fast she was growing up.
Now he has the sexy look mastered, Sherlock thought, as he leaned forward and the two of them kissed. Sherlock had noticed that with each kiss they had become less afraid to show their affection and desire for one another. Each kiss became longer and more intense and this was no exception. Sherlock’s hands were gripping John tightly, John was reaching up with one hand to run his fingers through Sherlock’s curls. Sherlock pressed himself against John and John pulled him in harder. They were soon backed against the wall of the front hall, locked in a passionate embrace. Who would’ve pegged a hangover and bacon and eggs as an aphrodisiac?
“Don’t sell yourself short, John,” Sherlock scolded playfully. “After all the time you’ve spent with me I would imagine you’ve become much more observant than you realize.”
“I’ve got to,” Sherlock replied. “Rosie will be done with her bath soon and you’ll have to put her to bed. “Good night, John, I’m glad the party was such a success.” And with that he left.
“Alright, but first, I’m going to say this thing, all of it, and you can’t interrupt ok? And when I’m done you don’t have to respond, in fact just don’t respond ok? Just let me and Rosie go home and you can think about it and let me know what you think later when you’ve had a chance to really mull it over, ok?” John spouted all these caveats out quite quickly. Now that he was talking his nervousness was making him want to say everything that was on his mind.
So Sherlock's alright, he and John have made up and he's promised to kick the drugs, whatever it takes... Also, am I sensing something might just be starting to brew between Mycroft and Greg??
After dinner, which was as exceedingly delicious as a person would hope it would be for the price, they climbed into a cab to head back to Baker St. John would retrieve Rosie from Mrs. Hudson, who had been more than willing to watch her while John and Sherlock were out, then he and his daughter would head home.
“Here we are,” declared Sherlock, as he removed John’s blindfold. The moment the had left Baker Street in the cab, Sherlock had insisted on blindfolding John, so as not to ruin the surprise.
“Thanks,” John said shakily. He turned and walked out of the alley toward the main road to hail a cab.
“Right,” John replied, God this day had worn him out. “Thanks again,” he mumbled with a final nod to Sherlock as he left the flat.
Sherlock looked hurt by this. “Well yes, she gets it from Mary, but I meant you too, John,” Sherlock said sounding offended and surprised by John’s interpretation of his remark. “You’re one of the most intelligent people I’ve ever met,” he added very sincerely.
John looked up at his friend and was struck by another realization: he wasn’t alone. He was here with Sherlock, the man he was falling in love with. If all went well tonight, John was going to be headed down a very different path from the old widower because although he had lost his first true love, he felt sure he had found another. John realized he was, really, very far from alone in this life because he had been lucky enough to be given two wonderful romances, two people to share his life with.
“I know, and I want to tell them, I do. Just not yet,” John sighed. He wished he could make Sherlock understand that this was not to do with him, this was just something John needed to work through. He needed to get used to the idea of their relationship before he was ready to share it with everyone else. After years on his own, this was all felt so new and it was a good new, but it still took getting used to.
John awoke with a splitting headache, feeling groggy. What time was it? He reached for his bedside clock on the nightstand and didn’t find it. He rolled over and looked and realized then that this was not his room; this was not his bed. Shit, what happened last night? He sat up slowly, his head throbbing and looked around, it didn’t take long for him to recognize Sherlock’s room at Baker Street.
“Right,” John sighed. His nerves had been on edge at the start of the drive, he’d speeded the whole way to the hospital, coming straight from the cottage and now was feeling even more worse for wear.
“Oh yes, hello,” Sherlock said, somewhat surprised, as Rosie threw her arms around him, hugging his knees. “You’re daddy’s stuck in some bad traffic so you get to come home with me for a bit, does that sound fun?” Sherlock asked her cheerfully.
“Alright calm down, we can solve this,” Sherlock said, taking John’s hand to get him to hold still. Just then, Rosie burst into the room.
“Excellent observation John. Yes, we are in fact at the London Eye. I thought since we both love this city so much, a spectacular sunset view would be a good way to spend our first Valentine’s together.”
“Yeah, no it was a bit of a mess,” John admitted. “Are you home right now, are you busy? Could I maybe pop by for a bit, just to let off some steam?” he asked, a bit nervous about how his friend would take this question.
John didn’t answer at first and Sherlock wondered if he shouldn’t have brought it up. “It’s not just that,” John said finally. “I didn’t want to tell you this, because I didn’t want to hurt your feelings, but since we started dating, in the last month or so, I’ve spent so much time with you… I’ve never left Rosie with a sitter so often, and I was feeling a bit bad about it,” he admitted.
“Alright, I may have know you were meeting someone here tonight, yes,” Sherlock admitted, sounding disappointed that this was the way the conversation was turning.
They rented a cottage by the seaside for the weekend, and drove out after picking up Rosie from school. On the drive over Rosie excitedly outlined her plans for swimming in the ocean.
“I was listening, actually, and my phone was how I managed to solve the case so quickly,” Sherlock replied coolly, handing his phone to John. John looked down at the screen as Sherlock continued to explain. “I looked Lucas up on social media. He used the name ‘Lucas Riley’, replaced his last name with his middle name, presumably to give himself a bit more privacy, but it’s a common tick among young people these days. Once I’d found his profile it was pretty simple to figure everything else out, it’s amazing how much personal information people comfortable sharing with everyone on the internet.”
“No, you suggested it actually, but I didn’t think the timing was quite right,” Sherlock replied. “And you’d thrown up not long before you proposed the idea so you weren’t exactly at your sexiest,” he added jokingly.
“That’s good to hear,” Sherlock replied, following John’s lead and letting the previous moment pass without further comment.
“Aren’t you going to respond to that somehow? Congratulate me, perhaps?” Molly asked. Slightly annoyed.
“I don’t know what I expected,” John said dully, taking another long drink of his pint. He hadn’t wanted to go on this date exactly, but it had felt like the right thing to do. He hadn’t been out with anyone in the years since Mary’s death and he knew it was probably time to get back out there, if he was ever going to. So when Sarah said she had a friend she thought John might like and had pretty much refused to take no for an answer, he had decided she was probably right and probably had his best interests at heart. He agreed to go out for drinks with her friend somewhat reluctantly. He hadn’t had high hopes for the night but he hadn’t thought he would be stood up.
John’s feet pounded the pavement as he chased after the jewel thief, Sherlock and Lestrade right on his heels. John wasn’t in as good of shape as he once had been so he was running out of breath, but he was also gaining on the criminal. He dug deeper, determined not to let the man get away.
The bartender gave John, who had stood watching all of this with a blank, dazed expression, a knowing smile. “He may be late but at least he’s payin’, uh mate? Not such a bad date after all!” the man chuckled.
“Well, then I think it’s time for lunch,” John said. “Come on you.” He knelt down and his daughter happily jumped onto his back for a piggy back ride.
“There’s nothing to forgive, this was me, this was my being a complete arse and being afraid somehow of what I was finally getting to have. It won’t happen again.” John sniffed and tried to control his tears.
Lestrade ran off out of the alley, after the thief. Sherlock, still holding John firmly, lowered the two of them to a sitting position.
“Oh nevermind,” Molly muttered. “I can see you’ve got something on your mind. I’ll leave you to it, then. Happy Valentine’s Sherlock,” she called as she head into the next room to begin her day’s work.
Feeling bored. Dinner tomorrow? I’ll make reservations. Be at Baker St at 6:30. Bring Rosie. Mrs Hudson can watch her. -SH
“Coffee, maybe?” John mumbled. God, he felt awful. He couldn’t remember the last time he’d felt so awful… He also couldn’t remember what had happened last night, how had he ended up in Sherlock’s bed?
John jotted down the name of the hospital and hung up the phone. “Rosie,” he called. “You need to come right now sweetie, we have to go right now.”
John left the surgery with his nerves on edge. He was already behind schedule because his last appointment had finished late and there was no way he’d make it to his date with Sherlock on time. Damn, what a way to start things off in their relationship.
“No, no,” Sherlock said, almost laughing at the ridiculousness of this suggestion. “I was simply going to, shall we say… vet your date, from a distance, through skilled observation, to see if she was deserving of your attentions,” Sherlock explained coolly.
“So a week ago, Rosie told me she wanted a princess party for her birthday,” John said, conversationally.
“Do you think they suspect anything?” John whispered nervously after Molly and Mike were seated at their table and out of earshot.
“You know,” Sherlock whispered in John’s ear, we still have a couple hours before you’re supposed to pick up Rosie.”
“It is what it is,” they both said softly in unison. They broke their embrace at that moment and pulled away to look at each other, both smiling sadly. The phrase had become a sort of shorthand between them, a way of saying ‘I know life is hard, but I’ll always be there for you’, ever since the day they had made up shortly after Mary’s death.
So now his budding relationship with Sherlock was a ‘serious venture’; it was as if they were opening a business together. Leave it to Mycroft to suck all the romance out of a first date. But John knew Sherlock was pretty much Mycroft’s whole world so if he had even a shred of the older Holmes’s approval, well, that was something.
John’s body filled with a warm feeling at the sight of that smile. He had to admit, Sherlock did have a nice smile, when he meant it and he wasn’t making fun of John, that is. Why had he never noticed it before? Perhaps because Sherlock did spend so much time making fun of him. At any rate, he’d noticed it now. Although his heart was heavy with grief for Mary, seeing Sherlock smile at him like that made John feel a little lighter, and he couldn’t help grinning to himself a little as he rode home in the back of the taxi.
“Oh well,” John replied, thinking back to his own heroic visions from earlier, and realizing perhaps this private moment between him and Sherlock was better in a way. “Maybe being the hero isn’t everything,” he said, as he heard the wail of the ambulance approaching.
“Charming,” Sherlock said in return, feigning politeness, “I’m Sherlock Holmes; I’m a friend of Dr. Watson’s.”
“I’ll drink to that,” responded Sherlock, lifting his glass and slugging down the last of his first pint. And so they did.
“But that that’s what you were going to do,” John said evenly. “Most people would be bothered by that, you realize.”
“That was exactly what I needed,” John sighed as he hung up his coat. “A good breakfast and I feel like a new man.”
John grinned and leaned up to kiss Sherlock again, and this kiss was not a short one. Lips met again and again. Tongues entwined. When they broke apart John had the sort of warm, dazed feeling of waking from a good dream. Sherlock directed a smoldering grin down at him, but then suddenly his expression changed. He frowned and stepped back from John, who turned around to see his daughter standing in the kitchen door.
Sherlock looked at John, should he tell them the truth? But John’s face was so full of fear and nerves. No, now was not the time.
Sorry to ruin you and Mike’s evening, but would you mind if the babysitting lasted until tomorrow? John’s overdone it a bit on the drinks. -SH
“Double homicide-sized favor to be exact. Do you like it? It also comes with champagne, part of the package,” Sherlock said hopefully, gesturing to the ice bucket on the bench. “Probably not very good champagne, but…”
“There were signs of attraction. I suspected for a couple of weeks that you might be feeling something. Mycroft suggested the restaurant as a way to give things a little push in the right direction and although I normally wouldn’t take his advice on such things, it seemed like a good idea.”
Rosie smiled and hurried back down the hall. Once she’d disappeared, Sherlock stood back up and turned to John. “I think that went fairly well,” Sherlock said seeming pleased.
“Sherlock? What’s wrong? Are you on your way to get Rosie?” John asked, sounding alarmed. He was worried both by the fact that Sherlock was calling and by the fact that as he’d looked away from the road to answer his phone, the car in front of him had stopped suddenly and he’d almost crashed into it.
The bartender did look over though, “You boys ready to cash out?” he asked, but it was really more of a suggestion.
“Mmm yes, bed, and you, sir will come with me.” John attempted what Sherlock imagined was intended to be a saucy attractive look but it didn’t exactly turn out that way. “I’m going to take you to bed with me and inspect you all over, detective,” John slurred and then he gave a hiccup.
“Rosie,” John choked. His brain was running on overdrive, struggling to come up with what to say to explain to his daughter what it was she had just witnessed. Or perhaps she hadn’t seen anything, perhaps they had simply been standing there in each other's’ arms when Rosie came to the door.
Sherlock tried to get a handle on his nerves as he headed to the cafe where they’d planned to meet. He didn’t have much experience with romance and none of it was particularly successful, but this time he desperately wanted to get things right. The way he felt about John was unlike the way he’d ever felt about another person before in his life. He cared about John so deeply, and had such an intense desire to protect him, to support him, and to be a good enough person to deserve him. Sherlock had once thought he wasn’t truly capable of falling in love. When he was young, he’d thought perhaps his great intellect prevented him from letting his emotions take over enough to fall in love in the way other people could. But he now knew that wasn’t true because he was in love with John Watson, and he had to get this right so John would fall in love with him in return.
“Oh great, yeah, I didn’t really get a chance to eat at the restaurant,” John said, stepping carefully over a stack of papers and sitting down. “There a reason you’ve decided to set dinner up on the floor?”
“Not sure actually, but perhaps we’ll find out,” Sherlock winked and kissed him, before turning and heading into the house. “Come on, the guests are supposed to be here soon, right?”
Just then John’s phone buzzed on the nightstand. Who would be sending him a text at this hour? He grabbed his phone and flicked it on to read the message:
“Right, feeling a bit better now?” Sherlock asked John, as he came back into the living room. On a positive note, having a night at the pub end with his friend throwing up in his bathroom did take him back to his younger days… Ah to be young again…
“I don’t want to discuss this any further John. I’m getting my things and calling a cab,” Sherlock only had a small shred of anger left and he used it to give this final declaration some defiant dignity. The self pity and self loathing that was filling his heart, he kept hidden to himself.
“Quite alright, John,” a familiar voice said crisply. “But since we’re both here why don’t we sit back down and have another pint? This one’s on me.” Sherlock took the stool next to the one John had just vacated and flagged over the bartender. “We’ll have two more pints of whatever my companion here was just drinking,” Sherlock requested promptly.
“Daddy!” Rosie’s excited voice yelped from upstairs. Then John heard her quicker, smaller footsteps on the stairs followed by Sherlock’s heavier, slower ones.
“And you said you already went to the police so what exactly has lead you to come to us with this seemingly very dull and straightforward case?”
“On a romantic note, I want our first time to be special, and this isn’t exactly what I had in mind, and on a practical note John, I would never have sex with someone as drunk as you,” Sherlock explained kindly.
“What if, what if he doesn’t get a chance to forgive me though?” John looked up and the fear that he’d been trying to avoid thinking about threatened to overwhelm him.
“She thought I was Rosie’s father, and she was a bit embarrassed when I corrected her,” Sherlock explained. He smiled playfully at John and took his hand, “I said she was my boyfriend’s daughter.”
John was about to say no, he was not in the mood for lunch, but something about Sherlock standing there made him pause. Perhaps it was the sheer surprise that his friend had left a case to chase after him or perhaps it was the nervous, hopeful look on Sherlock’s face, but for whatever reason, John acquiesced. “Yeah okay,” John replied in a tired voice, following Sherlock toward the restaurant, still a bit bewildered by his friend’s behavior.
“Thanks,” John replied, surprised but pleased. He was also pleased that once he was able to come up with a response to his friend's compliments “I did try to look nice for tonight so I’m glad someone appreciated the effort, even if it wasn’t the person I intended,” he added with a playful, joking smile at his friend.
“I wanted to tell you,” Sherlock said. “Lestrade brought me a new case. Double murder. Mysterious note. Missing fortune. Intriguing stuff. If you’re interested in taking a look at the evidence, I’d like your opinion.”
“Well not exactly but… I was getting a little tired of waiting for you to say something,” Sherlock smirked. “After I came out to you, I thought it would be a given that you would return the gesture but-”
“Nothing, well, nothing that bad,” John amended. “I just had my second attempt at a date with that friend of Sarah’s. We met for dinner and it didn’t go so well.”
“Hmm? Oh right, yes congratulations, Molly,” Sherlock said quickly. Then he added, more sincerely, “And I do mean it, you deserve every happiness and if Mike brings you that, well he’s a very lucky man to have snatched you up.”
“Excellent, to bed then, I think,” Sherlock lead John to his room on the first floor, John’s old room, the guest room was out as stairs weren’t really an option at this point.
“You know it’s funny, I don’t have much experience in this area but I thought people were supposed to be trying to be charming and likeable on a first date?” Sherlock asked sarcastically.
“Well I never!” Mrs Stevens cried. She seemed too shocked and upset to fight back against Sherlock’s tirade and simply rushed past him and out the door.
“I’m not mad but you did mean it John and whether or not you meant to, it does hurt to hear you say you don’t think you should be spending so much time with me,” Sherlock said. He wasn’t angry; he wasn’t even being cold; he just sounded small and hurt, like a wounded animal. John squeezed his hand tightly but then Sherlock pulled it away. He walked toward the door and started putting on his coat.
“What’s there to explain?” Sherlock asked, as kindly as he could. They were dating, it was a pretty simple concept.
“Well last night you might’ve been, yes, but generally, you’re not so bad.” Sherlock smiled at him fondly.
“Oh, yes sweetheart, Daddy’s fine, just thinking about some things he has to do after he drops you off at school, but you’re right let’s go.” As they headed out the door, John’s mind ran through possible gift ideas and threw out each one in turn; Sherlock was not an easy man to shop for. His only hope was that Sherlock had forgotten what day it was too and, knowing Sherlock’s track record with basic life trivia, it was a possibility. Just as he was getting in the car, John’s phone buzzed. He looked at it and his hopes flew out the window.
This was not the first time Sherlock had let the drugs get the better of him but, he realized, this was the first time it felt like it mattered. Before it had felt like the possibility of ending his life accidentally with an overdose wasn’t that great of a risk because everyone would move on; it might be hard but they could manage. Now though, now he had a family of sorts, and he couldn’t leave John and Rosie alone again.
They cleaned in silence for a moment then Sherlock asked, “Is that why you were so worried about this party? Because you’re on your own with Rosie and you feel like you have something to prove, not just to her but to the rest of the world?”
“No he’s no my…” John trailed off as the bartender went to get their drinks, seeming not to have heard him. John sat down at the bar, not looking at Sherlock. “Mind telling me how you knew I was coming here tonight and why you decided it was a good idea to be here too when I was on a date?” John asked, annoyed that Sherlock was meddling in his private life.
Sherlock was surprised by this news. How had two people he knew started dating without his taking notice? But he had to admit Molly and Mike would make a sweet couple, they were both kind, smart but somewhat quiet people. How had he not noticed it though? Of course the last month or so he had been rather distracted by John. John! He still needed to come up with a Valentine’s gift, think, think!
“Well, thank you for filling me in on that, John, it does make things a bit clearer, but what I actually called to tell you was that Sherlock is in the hospital. He’s overdosed. I’ll give you the address if you’d like to come join us here,” Mycroft’s voice sounded worn out and thin.
“Oh Sherlock.” He crossed the room quickly and hugged his friend tightly. He did it on impulse, giving him no time to rethink his action. John knew he had done the right thing though, as he felt Sherlock in his arms, his tall, thin frame shivering slightly with his sobs. Whatever emotional turmoil John was feeling from embracing Sherlock was unimportant. John had to set aside the fact that his body was pressed against the man, who he was growing increasing confused about his feelings for.
“Well, it’s a lot to ask that I would just say it right then!” John snapped indignantly, but Sherlock laughed and then John did too.
“We’d like a bottle of champagne,” he told the waiter confidently. “I think…” He scanned the menu for something nice but not too expensive. “This one will do nicely.” John pointed out a selection to the waiter.
“And you are mine Doctor Watson.” Sherlock let go of John’s hand to wrap his arms around John’s waist.
“So overall, I would call that a success,” said Sherlock as he helped John tidy up that evening, post party. A dozen six year olds could certainly trash a house.
John returned to the kitchen once he’d seen to Rosie. He wasn’t sure why he wasn’t rushing in and stopping Sherlock from leaving by force, perhaps he wanted to avoid more of a scene in front of his daughter. Perhaps he thought Sherlock deserved some space if that’s what he wanted. Perhaps he felt that the awful loneliness and guilt that was building inside him as Sherlock packed was what he deserved. John went to the cupboard, intending to get himself a glass for some water water, but he found a half empty bottle of whiskey on a high shelf in the and decided this was a more appropriate drink for the occasion.
“I just told you neither wallet or purse had any identification, were you even listening?” Sherlock snapped.
“No, no... We were talking about you... and you love talking about yourself,” John said slowly, thinking outloud. “You’re trying to keep something from me… We’re here for some reason other than you being hungry and you don’t want to tell me what it is,” John finished, somewhat proud of having deduced the motivations of the original master of deduction.
John was surprised to hear the detective back down on his gibe so easily. Not wanting the moment to turn to heartfelt (for obvious reasons) John quickly made a comeback. “Either way, I still outran you!”
“You didn’t save me,” John snapped defensively. He pulled his shoulder out of his friend’s grasp and turned away in an attempt to save face but the fact that this move caused him to wince in pain somewhat lessened the effect of the defiant gesture.
“Right,” John sighed, of course Sherlock didn’t see anything odd in his little outburst. “First off, how the hell did you figure out all that about the son being gay? You weren’t even listening to her, you were just on your bloody phone the whole time.”
Sherlock’s hole body was exhausted, aching all over, but seeing John there, his gaze so full of love, made the pain seem unimportant.
“Pretty much, yeah,” John said, then he added jokingly, “But you know, it was kind of a nice threat when you think about it, shows he cares about you, doesn’t want you to get hurt.” John expected Sherlock to laugh at this but he didn't.
John stared at his friend, who was still directing his gaze and words toward the floor.  John was shocked, not only had he not seen this admission coming but he had rarely seen Sherlock look so weak, so frightened and small somehow, despite his impressive height.
“Oh sweetheart what did I do to deserve you?” John whispered, kissing her on the top of the head. “And this doesn’t mean I didn’t love your mum,” he added. “I did love her, very much and I miss her. You remind me of her a lot actually.”
“Perhaps by the end of the night we’ll have found a good reason to celebrate,” John continued with the calmest smile he could muster. Of  course, if Sherlock responded unfavorably to his admission, John was going to be wishing he’d ordered a bottle of rum or whiskey instead but it was best not to think about that.
“It’s alright,” Sherlock smiled softly. “I know.” Tears began welling up in his eyes too. “Come up here.” He patted the edge of the bed softly and scooted his body over as much as he could. John climbed up and lay down on his side on the edge of the bed, laying his arm over Sherlock’s chest, curling his body close to him.
“Well I am, and if you’ll excuse me I’m late,” Sherlock wanted to leave and cut the interrogation off quickly, but he’d said the wrong thing.
“Well she showed up late, which wasn’t a great start and she didn’t apologize either, just gave the old ‘hope I didn’t keep you waiting’ but when you’re fifteen minutes late of course you kept me waiting,” John said, the frustration from the date quickly returning.
“Yes I think we are, thanks,” Sherlock replied politely. After he took care of the bill he pulled out his phone and shot off a text to Molly.
John and Sherlock met for a walk in the park a couple of days later, it had been John’s idea and Sherlock got the sense there was something specific they were there to discuss. He hoped John hadn’t had any second thoughts about how quickly their relationship was progressing, when they’d made love for the first time it had felt so right and Sherlock had thought John felt the same way. But as the conversation began, Sherlock realized this wasn’t what was on John’s mind at all.
“Alright, love, Daddy’s hurrying,” John called back, rushing down the stairs. Leave it to hs brilliant daughter to actually want to be on time for school, didn’t most children not want to go at all? But Rosie was special and he loved that about her.
“She left a bit ago and the waiters already cleared her place,” Sherlock quickly supplied a clearer excuse.
“Of course,” Sherlock assured her, overdoing it slightly in his attempted pleasantness. He dialed John’s number on his mobile and put the call on speaker. After two rings, John picked up.
“Excuse me,” a young woman called out as she them. She was nicely dressed and had a sweet but very proper, meticulous air about her. Sherlock and Rosie stopped and turned to look at her as she approached them. When she reached them, the young woman introduced herself to Sherlock, “I’m Rosie’s teacher, Ms Jones,” she said.
“I’m glad,” Sherlock replied, taking off his scarf. “Because you were not looking very well this morning.”
Sherlock reached across the table and took John’s hand in his, cutting him off. “I know John, I know. Me too,” Sherlock said softly.
0518. His and Mary’s wedding anniversary. John had not thought this was very easy to guess because who bothered to remember other people’s wedding anniversaries? Most people forgot their own for Christ’s sake! But of course Sherlock, as he had said moments ago, was not ‘most people’.
“Wouldn’t have expected to see you two here,” Mike said. John and Sherlock just looked at each other, neither sure how to respond. Mike and Molly stood there for a moment, smiling, Mike’s arm draped around her waist.
“I’m really starting to get used to the sound of that,” said John, taking Sherlock’s hand, “You are my man now, Sherlock Holmes.”
In the the cab back from the restaurant with Sherlock, John sat quietly, trying not to show that he was overwhelmed by nerves. He hadn’t managed to say what he’d needed to to his friend, hadn’t been able to get the words out of his mouth, even though they’d been running on a nonstop loop in his head. Now his window of opportunity was growing smaller and smaller. He’d already given up the gorgeous, romantic setting of the restaurant dining room. He’d have to settle for a cramped cab… with the driver listening in? No. He couldn’t do it here. He would wait until they arrived at Baker St, but how would he bring the conversation up? THere had been so many clear opportunities at dinner and he’d let them all go. He’d been too nervous, but his apprehension had only grown worse over the course of the meal. How on earth was he going to do this?
“What are you talking about? John you care so much about her and it shows, really, and what’s more is she knows you care, whether the party or the cake or whatever is perfect or not,” Sherlock pulled John into a hug, and they stood their for a moment, before John broke the embrace.
“Or is that how you feel about me, John, not your daughter, but you?” Sherlock spit this question at him bitterly. And of course it is what he thinks, said a cruel little voice in Sherlock’s head. Who could ever love someone like him?
“Isn’t it possible I just wanted a drink and picked this spot coincidently?” Sherlock questioned in an overly innocent voice.
“Mycroft this is only our first date. I’m sure with time we’ll figure out exactly how things will work between us,” John managed to respond, still finding it hard to believe he was actually sitting in this car having this conversation with Mycroft of all people. Shouldn’t he be discussing these things with his boyfriend before he got them all squared away with his brother? Was Sherlock even his boyfriend for that matter?
“John,” Mrs. Hudson threw her arms around him as he approached the group in the hospital waiting room, Rosie in tow. Mike and Molly were sitting side by side, Mycroft was leaned against the wall and Lestrade was pacing back and forth.
“Yes,” John smiled, but he knew he was more nervous than sauve, as Sherlock was being. “That sounds just fine.”
“Fine. I’ll see you then,” Sherlock replied sounding unconcerned. He hung up the call before John had a chance to apologize or thank him again, however, leaving John to struggle through the traffic jam worrying over whether or not Sherlock was annoyed with him.
“Of course dear.” She took Rosie’s hand. “Alright Rosie, say goodbye to everyone, they’ll call when the doctor tells them how Sherlock’s doing.”
“Do you think they’d have good fish and chips here?” Sherlock asked looking down at the menu as if he hadn’t heard John’s last comment. “Sandwich is probably safer though…” he added after a moment.
“Well what word would you use otherwise John?” Sherlock asked coldly. He pulled his hand away and put it in his pocket. Was John ashamed to acknowledge their relationship in public?
“Ah, good you’re up,” Sherlock greeted him cheerily, as he entered the room. “Would you like some tea or coffee perhaps?”
John stopped dead. Could that be right? Was it… yes it was Valentine’s Day. It was Valentine’s Day and Rosie had had to make Valentine’s for every one of her little classmates and she had remembered and he had had to get one Valentine for the most important man in his life and he had forgotten. Damn, how on earth was he supposed to get Sherlock something special and perfect, as he deserved, with so little time?
“It’s sweet how naive you are, John, but with my little brother, as you of all people should know, nothing's that simple. Yes, I’m sure most relationships can be ‘figured out with time’ as you say, but Sherlock is a somewhat volatile individual and he’s quite emotionally needy. He’s grown very attached to you over the years and now that you have returned that sentiment and taken this next step, I just want you to consider carefully what this relationship will require, because if you go don this road you can’t go back or you would break my brother’s heart. You would break his heart and you would break him entirely and I will not allow that.”
“Thanks,” said John, taking a sip, and setting the cup down on the nightstand. “Sherlock…” he began nervously. “Last night, I don’t really remember how things ended, did we…” John didn’t know how to finish the question, he was feeling embarrassed and stupid now for having gotten so drunk and making such a fool of himself, even if he couldn’t remember it he knew he must have acted outrageously.
“Champagne,” Sherlock commented, as the waiter bustled away, his tone and  raised eyebrow displaying his curiosity. “Is there some special occasion tonight that I was unaware of?”
“Perhaps I’d best take Rosie home, eh love?” Mrs. Hudson suggested. “You’ll give a ring when you find anything out?”
“Anyway, I’m just glad you were free. At least I’m still getting dinner,” John said. “I’ve missed our old takeaway spot,” he added with a smile.
“You are,” John agreed. “And you made a much better impression the first time we met,” he added quickly. Then he blushed, realizing this may have been taking things too far but Sherlock didn’t seem to notice.
“Of course it does. She was clearly an awful homophobe and a terrible mother,” Sherlock said. His explanation was simple, but he was clearly somewhat agitated; he took a couple paces toward the kitchen as he spoke, then backtracked a step toward the door before stopping and facing John again.
“I think that sounds like a wonderful idea,” Sherlock agreed. “We can tell everyone it’s for the case, the one for the foreign royal,” he teased.
“Not a problem, you’ve done that for me many times,” Sherlock said, pecking John on the cheek as he got up from the bed. “Now you take your time with that coffee and when you’re done, we’ll go out and get some breakfast. We don’t have to pick up Rosie until this afternoon.”
“Oh, I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have assumed,” the girl said quickly, blushing. “Well… either way.” She then hurried off to pass out more samples.
“It’s a lovely idea,” said John, why hadn’t he thought of something this good? “Shall we go get in the queue then?”
“Oh Sherlock! You can be nice when you try, huh?” Molly teased. “And you’ve no right to be jealous,” she added jokingly, “You had your chance.”
Sherlock was normally quite fond of Molly, but today her questions were not welcome. This was only his and John’s first date and he wasn’t ready to tell all their friends what was going on between them just yet.
“I suppose it was just too close to home. I know-,” Sherlock’s voice broke and he let out a shaky breath. “I know what it feels like to be in Lucas’s shoes. When I was 19 I came out to my parents as gay and they-,” he paused again and collected himself once more.
“Right, ok…” John took a drink of his champagne and scanned the dining room for someone who looked easy to figure out. He normally wouldn’t be so eager to go along with the detective's little games, but this was a chance to impress Sherlock, which John wanted to do tonight. If he could prove he was smart and capable, Sherlock’s equal, that would set things up better for the little announcement he was planning to make. So John needed to find someone who was easy to read because to let his observation skills shine, he needed a less challenging target. “How about that older man sitting alone, behind you?”
“We never got one! After I cancelled the castle cake order we never got a new cake, oh my God Sherlock, there are a dozen six year olds about to arrive at our home and we have no cake.” John started pacing back and forth nervously.
“The average person might know that but me? Never,” Sherlock smiled slightly at his little joke. Then he looked at John and added smoothly, “Anyway, you aren’t really ‘most people’ either, are you John?”
“Oi, John!” A voice called over from across the restaurant, breaking the moment. John quickly pulled his hand out of Sherlock’s as Molly and Mike Stamford walked over from the entrance.
“Well, it’s this relationship you’re starting with my brother,” Mycroft replied matter of factly. “I want to make sure you understand fully what you’re entering into,” he looked at John seriously.
“And you’re the most important thing in my life,” Rosie said, wrapping her tiny arms around him in another hug.
Oh dear, Valentine’s. Sherlock had forgotten, he’d forgotten completely, he was not, after all, used to having to remember this particular holiday. He and John had only just started dating but that didn’t mean he was allowed to forget this day, perhaps it even put more pressure on him to remember and do something nice and romantic. Oh damn, what was he to do on such short notice?
“Why don’t you fill up a bag with some taffy to share?” Sherlock told Rosie. “Make sure you get all the good flavors,” he added with a smile.
“No,” John said, feeling both exhaustion and the sudden desire to cry. But his weak protest did no good, as he knew it wouldn’t. Sherlock left the kitchen, and not knowing what else to do, John went to tell his daughter goodnight.
Sherlock texted back a quick thanks and looked over to see why John had gotten so quiet, only to find his friend slumped over the bar, half asleep. “Alright, let’s get you home, come.” Sherlock helped him up and lead John outside so they could call a cab.
“No,” John said, shaking his head. “That doesn’t make sense. We’ve dealt with some awful people in our cases: murderers, kidnappers, abusive spouses. I’ve never seen you lose it like that before so what is it about this one that’s set you off?” Sherlock wasn’t looking at him anymore; instead he seemed to be suddenly fascinated with his own shoes. The detective’s expression was worried, perhaps even nervous. They were silent for a moment but John felt they were on the brink of something big and he didn’t want to let Sherlock off the hook. “I’m your best friend,” he pleaded, but he said it kindly. “You can tell me.” There was another long silence and John was about to give up, then finally Sherlock spoke.
“Sherlock was teaching me how to do deduction stuff,” Rosie proclaimed excitedly to her father, as she ran into the room.
“Ok,” John said, composed now. “So you knew about my date, but why did you come here? Were you going to try to join us?”
“I read your texts,” his friend replied simply. John gave him a shocked look and Sherlock added with exasperated disbelief, “Oh come on John, don’t pretend your passcode isn’t the simplest thing in the world to guess.”
“But you don’t bring it up! Certainly not as the first thing you say to someone on a first date!” John cried, exasperated. “And stop interrupting me,” he added. “You want to hear the story, let me tell it.”
“Did she? Oh, that’s interesting, because this morning she asked me whether the princess that’s coming to her party, because I was going to get an actress from one of those party companies, you know.”
“Yes, but Sherlock that’s not a funny joke, ok no encouraging the children to eat the slime. This party is not a space for experiments in child psychology, do you understand me?!” John yelled, following him into the house.
“Mrs Stevens I’m going to ask you once: please leave this flat,” Sherlock said, standing up and walking over to open the door for their guest. “Your son is fine. He wasn’t kidnapped as you so idiotically assumed considering the lack of evidence of someone forcing entry to his room. He ran away. He’s safe with friends, but I’m not going to tell you where because he’s probably safer where he is than he would be with you,” Sherlock said, his anger mounting throughout the speech.
“Pick up the phone, please pick up,” John prayed through gritted teeth. The dial tone blared in his ear as he held his mobile with his shoulder in order to keep both hands on the wheel of the car.
“No,” John shot back, his brain was spinning again, trying to comprehend all he was feeling and put it into words that would make sense. The most important thing right now, John told himself, was to make Sherlock see that he did love him. That was not at all confusing. “No Sherlock I don’t think that,” John’s voice was softer now.
John’s head hurt worse as he tried to remember what had happened the night before. He remembered thinking that this could be the night that he and Sherlock went all the way. He remembered hoping a few drinks would give him the courage to lead things in that direction… But beyond that it was a blank. Had he and Sherlock had sex last night for the first time and now John would have no memory of it?
“Did you start this?” John snapped, “Because I had a whole party planned and it’s got to get completely re-planned in less than 48 hours now.”
“No, no, it has nothing to do with the case,” Sherlock said quickly. “Let’s not think about that now, hm?” He smiled at John again and this time it was genuine and warm.
“Oh she’s not my… I mean she’s my… My boyfriend’s daughter,” Sherlock replied. Why didn’t I just say thank you and leave it at that? Now I’ve embarrassed the poor girl, he thought. And more than that why did the word ‘boyfriend’ just slipt out of my mouth? That was what John was though, and it certainly did feel good to say it. It fit, it felt right, in the same way that it felt right that they were here, taking this trip as a family, or at least a sort of family.
“I don’t think most people would characterize it in such a kind light, but thank you, John; I’m glad you find it at least somewhat charming,” Sherlock said sincerely, and there was that wonderful smile again. John felt himself practically glowing with happiness over the fact that he had made Sherlock smile like that. He felt a strange urge too, to reach out and take his friend’s hand. He had this sudden need to have that physical contact with Sherlock to make him seriously understand how  he impressed and captivated John, and really always had. He thought better of it though, and held back. He was nervous about what to say next, not wanting to ruin the moment, but Sherlock saved him from having to find a reply.
“Right. And what did you say your son’s middle name was again, Mrs Stevens?” Sherlock asked, his focus back at his phone.
I had such fun writing this one, hope you enjoyed it! More to come and as always thanks for reading, commenting, etc!
“No you weren’t. You were just being… well you,” John argued rather unconvincingly. “But it’s impressive, that thing you do, and it’s charming, albeit in an odd sort of way,” he added, the attempted compliment straying close to the territory of an insult.
Sherlock smiled and kissed John again, on the lips this time. “You certainly know how to flatter a man doctor.”
“I know… It’s just that I get worked up sometimes, I have to be her mum and her dad, you know? I have to bake the cake and pick up all the decorations and on a regular basis I have to cook and pick up and also go to work and I just worry sometimes that I can’t do it all well enough.”
Was he feeling light-headed? Yes, but not for the expected reason. “No, no, I’m fine, I just… Had a moment… Maybe it’s good you called for help,” John mumbled. Although, he knew no doctor could solve his real problem.
“That would be helpful yes,” Ms Jones agreed. “And put Dr Watson on speaker if you could so I can hear the whole conversation.”
“John? Why are you calling me?” Sherlock sounded genuinely confused when he answered. John chuckled slightly, knowing Sherlock really didn’t understand why his even best friend would be phoning him when there was such a thing as texting. Sherlock’s little social quirks were really quite endearing
“Right well it was pretty bad right from the moment she arrived because the first thing out of her mouth when I stood up to shake her hand was ‘my you’re shorter than I expected’”
“I didn’t say that, that’s not it, it’s just…” John ran out of steam halfway through this retort. He was actually sure now what he thought it was about this scene that would be so upsetting for Rosie. Surprising yes, but Sherlock was right, she’d seemed to have gotten over that quite quickly and at that young age, children were usually not masters of hiding their emotions.
“They kicked me out,” Sherlock continued finally. “My family disowned me. I didn’t speak to my parents for years. I was alone and scared and it was one of the hardest times of my life.” He looked up at the end of this speech and John saw he was crying.
“Oh no, he approved it. I think my dear brother is trying to get in my good graces so he can continue giving me advice on areas where he has no expertise.”
“And you were going to take Rosie home for him, today?” the teacher questioned, keeping her tone light.
“Oh stop it, I didn’t mean it like that,” John snapped. “I thought we talked about this and we were going to take a little time to ourselves before we started telling people,” he continued, more calmly.
John blushed furiously and turned his attentions to his drink, hoping he could pass off his reddened complexion as an effect of the alcohol. He knew he had every right to be pissed at Sherlock and any sane person probably would be pretty upset at this point. But that was not what he felt. He felt flattered that Sherlock was calling the two of them special and similar, putting both of them in the same, above average category. He knew Sherlock hated average people and it felt good to be considered on the detective's level, better than the boring, everyday masses. He also felt… distracted, perhaps, by the sly smile his friend had just flashed him when he made this last comment about John not being ‘most people’ either. He felt the need to not look at his friend but instead have another swallow of his beer because that almost mischievous smile was preventing him from thinking clearly. He realized it was the same flustered feeling from the other day when Sherlock had called him smart.
John laughed. “True, but I think there will be some similar parties coming up, some of those parents looked like they were taking mental notes.”
“Sorry, um... Did you check the wallet for her ID?” John replied distractedly, trying to drag himself away from his upsetting train of thought.
“You’re bleeding terribly John, don’t be ridiculous,” Sherlock argued, but his tone was more caring than patronizing. He took off his scarf and pressed it firmly against John’s injured shoulder to stop the flow of blood. “Tell me if this hurts, if I’m pressing too hard.”
“It was a blind date, John, set up by a work colleague who was being rather pushy about the whole thing,” Sherlock said somewhat pityingly but not cruelly. “Did you really expect it to go well?”
“Lay off, I was nervous ok?” John pouted, but he did so with a smile and they both then. And somehow they both knew things would work out. Perhaps a weekend away would do them some good.
Sherlock smiled proudly. “The thing about being a good detective John, is that you end up with a lot of people who owe you favors.”
“Dr. Watson, this is Ms Jones.” The young woman seemed more embarrassed by the whole situation, than annoyed. “I’m sorry to be bothering you-”
Sherlock grinned at him, it was cute really, how much he cared about making Rosie’s birthday perfect. John really was a good father. “They’re six year olds, John, they’ll eat it up,” Sherlock assured him.
“It wasn’t me!” John cried, his mouth full of eggroll. “She was bloody awful. I have no idea what Sarah was thinking,” he continued, shaking his head, as he dished himself up a full plate of Chinese food.
“Don’t be ridiculous,” said Sherlock, although he seemed a bit less cool and more flustered now. “Where’s that waitress…”
“If nothing else, I suppose I can write it up for the blog and get you some publicity,” John said with a laugh.
Sherlock was at the door when he turned back and said, “Oh and just to be clear, John, I do very much want to have sex with you, just when you’ll be able to remember it the next day.” He winked and left the bedroom.
As he lay in bed that night, staring at the ceiling, unable to sleep, John thought about what he had learned that day. Sherlock was gay. John knew what this meant. It meant that he could admit to himself what he had been feeling toward Sherlock over the past few weeks. What had been growing inside him was an attraction, a love for his best friend that was more than platonic, and now that he knew this could potentially be reciprocated he could truly face this fact. Before he could have told himself that he should keep his feelings to himself because they would never lead to anything; Sherlock was attracted to women, Irene proved this. Now he knew that statement wasn’t true, or at least it wasn’t the whole truth.
