It gets better as he grows older and he is given more freedom. He takes every dare, every challenge that’s given to him and he will do it readily, happily, even. John discovers that he gets the same rush when he back-chats the teachers or makes a particularly cutting comment to one of his peers and soon builds up a reputation as a bad-ass. This doesn't bother him, nothing bothers him, because it doesn't matter. All that matters is the
There was a cough. ‘Master Sherlock? Queen Patricia asks if you would do her the honour of going to her quarters immediately.’
Because, God help him, he meant it.
John shrugged, not wanting to get in the middle of a fight. Jenny was glaring at her daughter. ‘What do you mean, Harriet? They help this country-‘
a new school, I don’t
John shook his head, completely oblivious to what was going on. How had kissing him helped? Why had she done it? What, exactly, would it accomplish-
‘Alcohol’s over there,’ Mike said, his mouth still firmly attached to the girl’s. ‘People everywhere. Don’t bum anyone out.’
Sherlock opened the door and went into his room, seething with anger. John followed, closing the door behind them.
Henry shook his head in bewilderment. ‘Johnny-‘
). Mike raised an eyebrow, but shrugged and said, ‘So…you know Molly Hooper?’
John took a slight step back. ‘I literally met him two minutes ago.’
It was the person he’d thought about every day for the last two years. His first thought in the morning, his last thought at night, and most thoughts in between. He’d imagined this moment so many times, in so many different ways-
‘Thought I’d what?’ John said, still looking incredibly pissed-off. ‘Gone home? If you weren’t so busy almost fucking that bitch, you’d remember I fucking lived here-
‘Since when did ‘me’ rhyme with ‘faeces’?’ Mike said. Sherlock huffed and snatched the piece of paper of his friend. ‘It’s a half-rhyme, Michael, and I think it’s brilliant.’  Mike closed his eyes, sighed, and then opened his eyes and put his hands on Sherlock’s shoulders. ‘Sherlock,’ he said slowly, ‘what I say now I say as your friend. Do not write John a poem. Seriously. Just don’t. It’ll end- I can’t even tell you how it will end, mate, but if someone gave me that,’ he gestured harshly at the piece of paper, ‘I’d probably file a restraining order. Just ask him, Sherlock, please.’
John had stopped trying about six months previously. He convinced himself he didn’t love Sherlock (he didn’t. Honestly. Definitely didn’t). He had stopped thinking about Sherlock (or at least tried too). He started studying again, just about managing to get his degree. He started speaking to his friends, started dating, even. No boys (he'd decided he just wasn’t attracted to them; Sherlock was a one-off) but plenty of girls.
Molly went bright red and shook her head as quickly as possible. ‘God, no, I was just- I mean- you big bully, you did that on purpose.’
Another girl (
‘I’m doing it,’ Sherlock snapped, glaring at his mother, who blinked. ‘I didn’t say anything.’
‘Go down now.’ Irene said, gesturing at the door. ‘You’ll be able to formally greet all your important guests of honour.’
The boys were interrupted by a cough from behind Sherlock. The prince whipped around and blushed as he saw his father glaring at him disapprovingly. ‘Why don’t you and Mr-‘
And Sherlock had a life sentence.
Trevor go to your quarters? Try not to make us look bad in front of the guests.’
Sherlock sighed, looked away and began to speak.
‘Of course not!’ William said. ‘My son, a faggot? Never! John’s his friend. Nothing more. How could you suggest that, mother? Sherlock…gay. Absurd!’ He laughed heartily and the others joined in, as if the majority had no idea about Sherlock’s gay relationship with the Irishman that had cost the lives of seven hundred and sixty eight citizens of the Kingdom and their allies. Trisha laughing nervously, the others with relief. Sherlock plastered a fake smile on his face and John went ever redder.
except that’s of no use to him or John at that moment because all he can think about is this brilliantly simple man, and this brilliantly simple man touching and holding and
There was a shushing sound and then Morag’s voice also floated through the door and Sherlock fake-gagged, prompting a smile from Mycroft. ‘Your boyfriend is here, Sherlock. In your room.’
‘Good on you, son!’ John’s father roared. ‘You serious, then? What’s her name? What does she look like? Is she pretty?’
‘Relax,’ Hamish said, amusement clear in his voice. ‘One-way mirror. We can see them; they can’t see us.’
An eternity (or half an hour) later they pulled up outside Bart’s. Sherlock tossed a wad of cash at the cabby, not even pausing to accept the change, before sprinting into the building. ‘John!’ He shouted as he ran. ‘Come! Let’s go!’ He paused, looking back, Rosie by his side. ‘
‘They don’t have left-handed screwdrivers!’ Christopher moaned, throwing the screwdriver down in disgust. ‘Curse you, right-handed manufacturers! When I am King, everything will be left-handed!’
God, it smelt like Sunday mornings snuggled in the duvet. It smelt like a warm bath in the winter. It smelt like his mum’s baking at Christmas- it smelt
He didn’t concentrate at the premier; it was a pointless movie, something about a dystopian future and a girl who had serious self-esteem issues (a typical teenage girl film, Mycroft had told him) but Sherlock couldn’t even bring himself to say why, exactly, he hated it. Every time he closed his eyes he saw John’s face, so sad for some reason that Sherlock didn’t understand, and every time the girl on the screen did something completely unrealistic he heard himself telling John he would be going out with Irene and why had he said that? Why had he tried to hurt John?
he tells her,
Time is still, and Sherlock has never felt like he feels in that moment.
Mycroft took his hand and shook it once. ‘A pleasure, brother mine. Now go. John Watson will be waiting.’
And just like that John was alone.
Sherlock paused and looked at John for a long moment, seemingly deliberating something. ‘I can…I can tell your life story.’ Sherlock whispered.
And then it happens.
. Don’t judge-‘
John groaned. ‘Frickin’ brilliant.’
‘What are you talking about?’ Sherlock said weakly. John looked through the crack; he was now slumped in his chair, head in his hands.
Sherlock paused and narrowed his eyes at John. ‘Shall we go down?’
been missing, and John
Sherlock inclined his head. ‘A pleasure, Harriet.’ Harry looked annoyed at the use of her full name but John stifled a giggle, so Sherlock considered it a wise choice.
‘Do you want to know how I did it?’ Sherlock asked, his face lit up by the biggest smile John had ever seen. John shook his head. ‘I don’t care, but you were
And more.
John could have wanted.
Hunter sprawled out along the bunk and John sighed. ‘You’re pushing me off my own bunk, you dickhead.’
‘Go,’ she commanded. ‘Now.’
Instead of leaving, though, Sherlock laughed. Again. A deep, throaty, real life that made John smile despite himself. ‘You’re good,’ Sherlock said decidedly. ‘I like you.’
At this point John expected the boy to stand up and piss off, but the bluntness of his remark seemed to please him, for the boy then sat down opposite John. ‘No one’s ever talked to me like that.’
John opened the back door and walked, bare-footed, onto the muddy grass. It had rained for days, though today was beautiful, and the mud beneath his toes felt oddly satisfying. Who was he kidding? He wasn't over Sherlock, he probably never would be and he was an idiot, a blind idiot, for letting him go.
‘They won’t, Sherlock, I just talked to Irene, she said they were bluffing, please, Sherlock-‘
his brain screamed,
‘John Watson.’ The boy said. ‘That’s a very ordinary name.’
life. His doctor-cum-husband-cum-father of three life.
‘Let’s watch, then.’ Harry said, knocking back the last of her hip flask. John laughed. ‘What happened to you hating them?’
‘It’s bittersweet.’
Mary is getting suspicious. John knows that he shouldn't have named all three of his children after Sherlock but he
The chauffeur nodded at John. ‘Pleasure to see you again, Master John.’
He was with some other people, obviously; Mike Stamford, James Sholto and Sebastian Wilkes, but Sherlock didn't see them. All he saw was John.
‘Yes,’ Mycroft said, rolling his eyes in a way almost identical to Sherlock, ‘you take precautions, but you are not careful enough. Both Trisha and I know-‘
‘Hmm.’ Charlotte looked unimpressed. ‘I think Sherlock looks fine as he is. Is that what the youth are wearing now, Sherlock?’
‘I can’t believe this.’ Henry Watson said hoarsely.
‘Oh, come now Molly. It’s plain as day.’ Sherlock stretched his arms and watched his friend carefully. ‘I’m right, aren't I?’
Hamish flopped down onto the one sofa that overlooked the hall, watching the people. ‘God, they make me sick.’
Sherlock turned and began walking towards John, his shoulders slumped. John could hardly believe what was happening; he had caused the heir to the throne to be disowned. This was the worst thing he had ever done by a titanic margin-
‘Ah, Doctor Watson.’ The voice came from behind him, deep and smooth, a voice that haunted John’s days and nights, dreams and nightmares, a voice that he knew he could never hear again. He turned slightly, gripping the gravestone so tightly his hands went bright white from strain, and looked behind him, knowing there could be nothing there, knowing he had finally,
It was only a few minutes longer before their son was delivered into the world, with big blue eyes and a few errant dark curls stuck to his forehead, wailing with a dramatic air that befit a son of Sherlock Holmes.
‘I concur.’
There was instant silence.
Anderson looked shell-shocked; the other detectives looked a mixture of envious, scared and angry; Sally looked like she was going to throw up. Sherlock smiled slightly to himself as he followed Lestrade across the street to where the other body was lying under a blanket, covered completely.
I love Sheriarty but I want to limit it for this Johnlock fic...comment and leave kudos to get another chapter up as soon as possible :)
‘I think it’s adorable.’ Greg wiped his mouth, grinning widely at the scowl that seemed permanently fixed to Mycroft’s face. ‘Look at them.
‘You’re- you’re lying.’ Sherlock whispered. ‘She didn’t-‘
But he couldn't, because he was a King.
John generally chose the former.
‘I am nothing like that!’ Sherlock fumed. ‘I’m the fucking King!’
John picked her up, though he couldn’t seem to tear his eyes away from Sherlock. ‘I- I can’t-‘
could have gone better. Their entire group was reunited, and for some reason (maybe because they were all older and mature, maybe because Sherlock and John’s calm and happy vibe affected the rest of them) everything was totally peaceful. Irene wasn't even bothered when Janine announced she was in love with a boy called Callum from home: Sherlock said that she and Molly, who had been at the resort since early June, had been getting closer and closer. Mike had a girlfriend, a sweet French girl from a small village near the resort called Claudette, and spent half his time talking to her and half his time talking about her, and Sherlock and John were
Sherlock hadn't felt this nervous about a decision for years, if ever. He’d been planning it for so long that he hadn't really noticed that he was running out of time until James had turned to him in Chemistry and said, ‘so what did you decide?’
Sherlock nodded. ‘Of course! He’s always wanted them accepted. The only reason he didn’t was because of Morag. He listens to her; when I’m King, I won’t.’
The cheering was deafening; Sherlock winced as he stepped forwards, glaring at the crowds until his father nudged him and shook his head minutely. The huge screens surrounding the courtyard showed his scowling face and Sherlock rearranged his features to look indifferent. Morag wouldn’t be delighted about that, which was a plus for him, but it wouldn’t get him into as much trouble as the suicidal expression.
John wasn’t really sure what he was expecting when he walked in. It had all been very fast with Mary, a lot of shouting and running and a room full of people, but Lila was lying in the hospital bed filing her nails, with their doctor, Ella, sitting on a chair in the corner of the room reading a magazine. John had to do a double take, looking at them both in amazement. ‘I’m sorry, have I wandered into a spa day?’
‘Why wouldn’t I be?’ Mycroft said far too quickly.
As they moved into the middle of the lake, John tried to tell himself that Sherlock was so much better than him at this only because he had lived here all of his life. While this might have been partially true, John knew a large part of Sherlock’s skill was just that:
‘I am afraid,’ he said, voice cracking slightly, ‘that I am bearing bad news to you today. Yesterday, my family was hit by tragedy.’
Mycroft looked at the ground as he followed Sherlock out of the boy’s quarters. ‘Not of everyone’s lives. And do try and struggle on to the last syllable, brother dear. My-
John didn’t stay in Trisha’s rooms any longer. He left Trisha trying to comfort Morag in her quarters and went upstairs, into Sherlock’s room, where he found his boyfriend crying. John had never seen him cry before; hell, he had barely seen Sherlock portray any emotion like that, despite the eyes that almost always seemed sad. His barricade had never come down enough for him to cry, and John had half-suspected that he would never see Sherlock express such deep and terrible emotion.
Mycroft straightened up, clearly deciding Irene wasn’t worthy of a reply; he pocketed his phone and fixed his pale eyes, the exact same shade as their father's had been, on his brother. ‘I just don’t understand why you don’t find this more important, brother dear. It's the most important day of your life, and you're treating it like it's a massive
so like his own.
William’s mouth was working wordlessly. ‘Wh- but- you have to,’ he said finally. Morag stepped in. ‘If you want to remain at the palace, William,’ she said smugly, as if she as sure that Sherlock would just ‘you will stop your relationship with this pleb.’
‘Sir!’ Jack hurried to the door and smiled. ‘In the front, or the back?’
‘Long live the King.’ Harry muttered, looking almost bored.
), who Sherlock hadn’t even realised was there but magically appeared from behind some ambassador, instantly jumped to Mycroft’s defence, ‘but it’s only a minor role in the British government-‘
It might not have been his first kiss, Sherlock thought as he kissed John, but
He carried John to his bedroom, because it was on the same floor and Sherlock didn't trust his intoxicated self to carry John safely up the stairs, and he laid him on his bed and looked at him for a moment, ignoring his rapidly rushing brain as it tried to make sense of what just happened-
Morag was walking around again. ‘You know, Sherlock, they say that religion is the main cause of destruction. Politics, anger, hatred, discrimination. They’re wrong. People will do anything for love; they will stop at nothing to get the person they want.’
He waves the memory stick, waiting to see him, this man he’s been thinking about, waiting for, and finally found-
William sighed and squared his shoulders. He was dressed in his robe, the purple one with the gold lining and red furnish. Sherlock had always hated the robe; it was the twenty-first century, for Christ’s sake, why did they still dress like medieval dictators? Why not wear a suit like the modern dictators they were?
John laughed (Sherlock quickly decided it was his new favourite sound) and kissed him once more, chastely, on the lips, before opening the door and striding out. ‘I’ll think about it,’ he called, and Sherlock, leaning against the door, smiled so widely it felt like his face was about to break apart.
All John could see was that girl.
‘You had to kill my father?’ Sherlock said slowly. ‘You had to
They belong together, and it doesn't matter that John will break him, because for now they’re infinite.
He supposed it hadn't been as bad as it could have been (he’d spent most of his time with Irene, who, it turned out, was actually wickedly funny and just the girl John would have gone for if she wasn't gay and he wasn’t…whatever he was) but it just wasn't the same without Sherlock.
Unfortunately, at this point, it was too late.
Sherlock saw Jim leaning against one of the gym mats and walked over to him. Sebby Moran saw him first and stiffened (Sebby had a real problem with Sherlock, viewing him as a potential rival for Jim’s affections) but Sherlock ignored him, punching Jim lightly on the arm.
Sherlock made his way back to the throne and sat down. The crowd stood; those in the Royal Box stood; John stood.
happy.’
This is a lie. Sherlock has so much: his work, his brother, his experiments. Sometimes it feels like it’s
‘Thank you for coming.’ Sherlock turned back to the crowd, addressing the square. ‘Thank you for giving us privacy in the last few days.’
Sherlock froze. John went bright red. William looked appalled, Morag furious. Mycroft raised an eyebrow, Trisha smirked, and several of the footmen looked disgusted.
‘Mum?’ John said, suddenly worried. ‘Mum?’ He turned around, following her line of sight, and then he
worth the heartbreak.
The door was thrown open, and Sherlock gestured at them to follow him.
Molly’s younger brothers, Callum and Henry, offered to do the washing up for twenty quid; Sherlock gladly handed over the money and whisked Molly into the living room. They were doing a joint project for their A level English coursework and Sherlock knew Molly couldn't do it all on their own; if they did it as quickly as possible he wouldn't have to constantly pester Molly to get it done.
He must have dropped off to sleep then, because suddenly it was lighter, the sun rising over another Afghan die. It was still cold but less so, and John shivered as he shifted under the blankets, wincing at the throb in his shoulder, before closing his eyes-
‘I liked her,’ Sherlock muttered. ‘She had the most delectable perfume. She gave me a bottle to experiment on for Christmas last year.’
John laughed and crossed his legs. ‘Nah. Nah, we’re not doing that again. I want you to tell me something about
John’s mouth drooped, though he quickly wiped the expression of his face; he couldn’t ruin this.
The next morning Sherlock woke up on an unfamiliar floor, with a name in his head, and with Irene’s voice whispering in his ear, ‘Hate to break it to you, buddy, but you’ve got a little something on your neck.’
Sherlock crossed the hallway, unlocked his door and gently pushed it open.
‘Scratches around the charger, he plugged it in several times whilst drunk. That was a bit of a guess, if I’m honest. Good one, though.’
‘My grandmother is coming down.’ Sherlock replied, rolling his eyes. John laughed. ‘God, you mean…’
‘I have a temper,’ James replies. ‘I have a temper. I’m sorry about that, but I love you.’ Silence. ‘As you love me.’
‘I wouldn’t say that,’ John interrupted, leaning against his door frame. ‘Irene’s alright, but Victor hates me. Molly’s in love with you-‘
‘Not gay.’ John said for what seemed like the hundredth time that week. His parents were desperate to reassure their younger child that being a homosexual was completely acceptable, because they hadn’t with Harry, and she had become so stressed with the thought they would hate her she had turned to alcohol, and look where she was now.
He raises the gun to his head, placing it gently against his temple, before kissing Sherlock’s cold, dead lips and once again taking his right hand.
His mother gasped, outraged. ‘No. Prince Sherlock is so much more…’
John stood up, shaking his head. ‘No. No, that can’t be right. He’d have told me.’ Greg was looking at him with what could only be pity. ‘John, mate-‘
‘Awful,’ Ellie groaned. ‘I’m so regretting taking French. Stupidest language of all time.’
The kiss was his and Sherlock’s friendship,
Sherlock was sitting at the top of the slide and even in the dark John was astounded by his appearance. Sherlock had never been fat, never had even a tiny bit of puppy fat, even when they were twelve, but he was so thin now that the biologist in John was worried every time he looked at him. His eyes had lost their sparkle, his clothes were all too big, and his face was so sallow and bony that John thought it would hurt to touch him.
Mycroft sighed, a martyred expression on his face. ‘John, Gregory has requested your presence downstairs. Some sporting event?’
He could tell Sherlock was trying not to smile, but as usual it didn’t work: the smile broke onto his face, lighting it up, and John started painting the rainbow. ‘I didn’t consent!’ His boyfriend whined, and John touched the tip of the paintbrush to his nose. ‘Don’t whine. You were always going to let me.’
Sherlock was crying now, though his voice remained steady and his face still; tears running down a frozen face. ‘Two people came through the door almost as soon as it happened, holding a long heavy-looking object. They dumped it on the floor and moved the gun from my mother’s hand into the object’s; this was when I realised it was a man. And then they left, and I sat in the wardrobe until I thought it was safe, and then I came out. I was only just five years old; I didn’t know what was happening, so I tried to wake mummy,’ he was crying properly now, doing nothing to stop the tears, ‘and I tried to shout her name, and I tried to shake her and when she didn’t wake up I just sat next to her and stared at her. I thought she was sleeping, so I sat with her and waited for her to wake.’
Sherlock thought the sentence was slightly oddly worded but smiled coldly. ‘Thank you.’
His mother shrugged. ‘That’s what happens, darling. It’s all a part of growing up. You’ll know all about it, soon.’
I am.’ He closed his eyes, and Sherlock’s heart snapped again as he continued to break the only person he’d ever loved properly and truly. ‘John, I swear, I hated myself for it, I couldn't break what we have, I had to make it better. That’s the reason I lied. I regret it now, I regretted it then-‘
‘Was it planned?’ Henry asked suspiciously. ‘What are you doing?’
Violet, who had heard the story of John asking Sherlock out one too many times, rolled her eyes and looked at the CD. ‘Then what’s on the CD?’
The glare was instantly replaced by a sunny grin, exactly like John's, and Mr Watson offered Sherlock his hand. ‘You’re not a twat. I’m surprised. Henry Watson. You can call me Henry.’
‘Then definitely go with the body parts,’ Jim nodded. ‘You don't get much more impressive than a human heart and severed feet doing the Charleston. Or tap. Salsa might be a bit risqué, though. I mean, it is John, and he has even less sexual experience than you. Anyway, I have a meeting to get to.’ Jim smiled and ruffled Sherlock’s hair (why did people keep doing that?). ‘Definitely go with my idea. It’s fault-proof.’
It didn’t matter, John reassured himself. As long as he and Sherlock were together, everything would be fine.
‘Which radio one?’ Mike said. Sherlock sighed. ‘Come on, Mike, let me through.’
Mycroft had been anxious: Sherlock hadn’t been in the least bit worried; in his opinion, most of his staff were spying on him, and it was extremely probable that Sebastian’s boyfriend was simply a royalist who was obsessed with Sherlock.
‘Thanks for scarring me for life there, Myc.’
He actually fell on the ground, onto his knees, and the Japanese boy exclaimed something in a panicked voice. John put his hands over his ears and rocked because he couldn't believe it, that his father had tracked him down and John had just sent him away again. He’d gone against everything he’d wanted and
‘Fine,’ John said. He didn’t care what he said or did; he was just happy that he and Sherlock would be able to go out in public together, lead a normal life. Or as normal as it would be when they were gay and one was the King of the largest nation in the world.
Sherlock sat down next to John, who tried to look unaffected. ‘Not gay. Bi.’
It’s raining but John doesn't care- he just kneels on his partner’s grave, head on the cold, silent stone, and remembers the only man he would ever love. This is all he can do, now, because Sherlock is dead and not coming back. He didn't fake it, not this time, but at least John isn't alone. Not anymore.
He froze.
'You know,' Archie said suddenly, 'I'm fourteen years old. I'm not a baby, Mycroft.'
‘That boy is a heartbreaker,’ his mother said. ‘Look, John.’
They’d been talking as a group for almost an hour, John guessed, but he was far too busy undressing Sherlock with his eyes to properly join in. He’d barely heard a word the other boy said: he’d barely heard a word anyone said. He’d never felt like this before, such a vivid, exotic connection with anyone, and he had never expected to: the fact that it was towards a seventeen year old male genius made it even crazier, but John was past the point of caring.
‘You, ripping my clothes off in a darkened swimming pool.’ John’s taken a step closer, his eyes dark and hooded, and Sherlock feels something flickering in his chest that he hasn’t felt for a very, very,
action, but it may be wise not to watch. Irene will kill you.’
Sherlock had done a horrible thing with a horrible person, and that had been, in John's mind, utterly unforgivable. But when John reviewed it, several months after, he realised that Sherlock clearly hadn’t been planning to have sex with him; there was obviously some deep history with James Moriarty that John hadn’t even stayed to listen too. Originally, John had thought Sherlock had invited Jim there that day, that he had been planning on having sex with him, that he was having a sordid affair, but when he truly thought about it a week later he realised that he couldn’t have done; Jim had greeted Sherlock like he hadn’t seen him for a long, long time. John had stormed off in the first place, over reacting completely when he found out that Sherlock had had sex before him. Why did that even matter? They had loved each other. Why had John been so bothered by that?
we are, how
John stood up so quickly he trod on the dog’s tail: the dog yelped, fixed John with an injured look, and then settled back down. The pretty girl with the dog glared at John mutinously before turning away.
‘Hell yeah,’ John replied, putting all thoughts of Sherlock and gayness out of his head, ready for a good old fashioned dare. ‘Why?’
‘Hamish,’ The waiter supplied. Sherlock shook his head. ‘Liar.’
‘He is.’ Morag said bitterly. ‘Out. Don’t come back.’
Lestrade smirked. ‘No, Myc. It’s tweeting, not twittering.’
‘Hmm?’ His husband (Sherlock still couldn’t believe that, sometimes) said, smiling down at him, Sherlock’s personal sun, and Sherlock smiled back and said, ‘have I ever told you that I love you?’
‘It does,’ John laughed. ‘Do you- do you like it? I mean, I get it’s not really a meaningful present but-‘
And John delivers that last blow, that final blow, that blow he knows will
‘Don’t care,’ John insisted. ‘Do it.’
Sherlock groaned. ‘He already thinks I'm a genius, Michael, and Sonnets are like thirteen-‘
‘I,’ Sherlock said throatily, interrupting the silence, ‘like you, John Watson.’
Sherlock didn’t say anything. Morag continued, oblivious. ‘I did it all for love, Sherlock. I wanted your mother out of the way, I wanted you screwed up and out of the way. I wanted William to myself; I always have done.’
‘Dad, you’re doing your soldier voice again.’ Harry smirked from the other side of the room. John’s father looked surprised. ‘Sorry. Old habits die hard, eh John?’
Sherlock shrugged. ‘It doesn’t change anything. I accepted I was- I was a homosexual years ago. It doesn’t change anything. I will never fall in love. It won’t affect me in any way. I’ll marry some European princess, have a couple of bratty kids, have a secret other life or something.’ He chuckled at the end, though Victor still looked slightly sorry. ‘What about Mycroft?’
John frowned; it was so long ago. ‘Um. Something about…I was worth more than your life?’
‘Brother mine.’ Mycroft materialised next to him, frowning as usual. ‘Nice to see you alone, for once.’
‘Sherlock,’ Mycroft said when his brother didn't reply, ‘I’m sorry if you’re angry with me.’
that I am in love with you.’
John nodded and focused on the television. He could have a meltdown about Sherlock later: now, he needed to watch, though he didn't know why anymore. What was the point? The King was dead, Sherlock was King and John was alone forever.
John lay in the grass as the rain pattered on his back and he cried and cried and cried as his heart ached in his chest.
‘Good looking?’ Harry said from the doorway. She stuck her tongue out at her brother and sank into the soft cushions of the sofa. John rolled his eyes at her. ‘How would you know?’
As much as John hated to admit it, she sounded like she was telling the truth. Plus the thought of Sherlock dead filled him with incredible and unbelievable horror.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. ‘And they gave it to you.’
Well.
‘Is this a flat?’ John asked in wonder. They were in a sitting room; to their left was the kitchen, and leading past the kitchen were a door open to a bedroom. Another door opened just before the bedroom; John guessed it was the bathroom.
‘Your birthday present!’ John dug around in his backpack. ‘I was going to give it to you as soon as we arrived but you distracted me.’
to, and now he must put up with strange looks and angry sighs whenever he announces that he’s going out to see him.
‘Go,’ Irene said. ‘Go to the roof and save Sherlock Holmes.’
‘Good.’ Ellie blushed. John tended to have that affect around people, especially girls: he was renowned for being sporty, academic and polite to everyone, even the younger years. ‘How did- how did your GCSEs go?’
In some countries, the monarchy had been overthrown in the previous three centuries; none of these countries were world powers. The governments had been nowhere near as good as a single ruler, especially when the ruler was good, and William was extremely good. Sherlock might not agree with the near-dictatorship but it kept their colonies, it kept their allies, and it kept them as the single most powerful country and Kingdom in the world.
Sherlock raised an eyebrow. ‘And now I have a name. Tell me, John, do you
‘No you won’t, drama queen,’ John scoffed at the same time as Rosie said, ‘I’ll help him. Come
‘You could do better,’ Sherlock replied, hauling himself up. ‘You do know that?’
‘You know what,’ John smiles, and he takes his son’s hand and squeezes it tight, ‘I think I was.’
Victor fidgeted uncomfortably. ‘I’m sorry, Sher.’ Victor was bisexual and open about it; his family were absolutely fine with it, as was Victor, who saw it as something to be proud of. The other boy was only a few weeks older than Sherlock but had accomplished…feats in the sexual field Sherlock had never even heard of. Not that Sherlock was exactly, ah, innocent. The only thing worse than gay sex, according to Morag, was underage gay sex, and Sherlock was guilty of a hell of a lot of that.
‘Bloody incredible.’ John said. ‘Brilliant.’
‘Really?’ Sherlock whispered, sounding so like the little boy John could see in his head, the little boy with springy curls and blood on his shoes.
syllable of his name as only John seems to do, and Sherlock can remember all the other time he’s heard John say his name: the first day, outside Baker Street, fighting Chinese assassins, watching crap TV, telling him
‘You’re one of them,’ Hamish replied. ‘I’ve been doing this job for years, ever since I started at Barts, and usually I enjoy it: weddings are nice, you know? But occasionally, we get a family like this. Most of the people in that room are aristocrats or loaded – they look down on us like we’re fucking
A mass of black curls shook, before a long, pale face looked up. ‘You found me. Took you long enough.’ He dropped his book and jumped to his feet with an agility that took John by surprise. ‘What do you want?’
The contraction passed and Lila’s face settled into a grin. ‘I know. I will miss Sherlock, he’s so
‘Clever?’ Sherlock was just throwing out adjectives now: he had absolutely no idea, and he’d already forgotten the premise of the game. He just liked seeing John happy and smiling and at Baker Street, away from
: the walls inside are still blue. They sell the same kind of coffee, and they sell the same kind of cake. But now a different teenager sits behind the counter, reading Hemingway and ignoring the customers: different regulars come in weekly, trying to find that one novel that will allow them to escape for seven days. There are now two children who run around, a blonde girl and her dark younger brother, stealing cake and running upstairs to share with their fathers.
The other members of John’s family were freaking out, John could hear them, but he just focused on these children, except none of them were children, the oldest was the same age as his
Smith eventually excused himself, rubbing his eyes before standing up straight, arms held stiffly at his side. Even in grief, he was a soldier, and he even saluted before he walked out into the cold of the Desert night, facing a life without the man he loved, and John had never pitied someone as he pitied Smith in that moment.
‘Hey, Hunty.’ John joked. The soldiers generally called themselves by their first names or nicknames; John was Johnny, Tigger’s real name was Aidan, but Hunter had said the moment he came through the door, ‘if anyone calls me Quentin, I will kick them in the balls and laugh as they writhe in front of me.’
It isn't that Nathaniel doesn't know about Sherlock: on the contrary, they talk about him all the time. Nathaniel is so like Sherlock that it’s scary, from appearance to personality to intelligence, and it breaks John’s heart because he knows just how proud Sherlock would have been of him and Nathaniel will never know that.
At that moment a heavy hand was placed on his shoulder: Mycroft jerked backwards, and scowled at his brother. ‘This, brother mine, is
‘I more than like you, Sherlock.’
John almost shouted, and Sherlock nodded in response. ‘How are we meant to know that whole dance?’
As if reading his mind, Harry said, ‘he sounded like a cunt from what Johnny told us. Right, Johnny?’
‘You don't know that,’ Molly tried to reassure him. ‘He might be saving himself for you-‘
With so many people around, although it gave him a headache, he was finally normal. All the pressure constantly on him was lifted. For a few minutes, he was wonderfully irrelevant, wonderfully average, wonderfully normal.
Sherlock sighed. ‘Fine.’
He was rewarded with the low, baritone chuckle he loved so much. ‘Ah. I see.’ Sherlock gently ran his thumb over the pink I, purple S and blue H on John’s back. ‘Not gay- ish. Very clever.’
‘You’re their sister,’ Sherlock said quietly. ‘God knows I deny it, but all siblings are like each other in some way. People seem to think Mycroft and I are-‘
And suddenly there was pain, horrific pain ripping through his upper left arm, just under his collarbone and John realised that he wasn’t completely sheltered inside the hut just as he started to fall, as he heard Smith shouting and Becca screaming, and he was very, very cold.
Sherlock blinked twice. ‘What-‘
Mrs Hudson was sitting in the kitchen, chatting with the cooks as she baked what looked like cookies. She smiled when she saw Sherlock, giving him a quick hug before saying, ‘look at you, so dapper! Congratulations, Sherlock.’
John. He knows John better than John knows himself, and even if he doesn’t know why John has done this he does know he has no right to judge, and John looks even more broken, if that’s possible. ‘I still want more. I’m not the man you thought I was, but I want to be. God, I want to be.’
And then there was a gunshot, and Sherlock screamed, tearing his eyes from John as he jumped in front of the army doctor but no bullet came anywhere near them, though Sherlock stayed in front of him and John remained crouched down, heart thudding, ears ringing.
Above the till, there is a picture of a blond haired man, younger than he is now and smiling in a tuxedo in front of a wedding arbour, leaning against a taller, dark boy, who has captured the light of the day in his eyes. Next to it, in the sloping handwriting of a genius, it is written:
‘I don’t speak French,’ John whispered back, ‘But I love you too.’
Jack broke through his thoughts with an incredulous laugh. ‘With all due respect, sir, you do. You and your lad are more in love than any other couple I’ve ever seen. You’d do anything for each other, it’s as clear as daylight, and you’d have to do something really, really awful for him to stop loving you, and vice versa.’
‘You know, Sherlock,’ John said quietly, and Sherlock couldn't remember the last time John had called him Sherlock. Usually it was
John wasn’t gay. He made that very clear. What he was…was appreciative of attractive people. Yes. That was it. Appreciative. That was all. He didn’t let it bother him, just tried to avoid males.
John looked helplessly at Molly, but she was already transfixed with Irene, who was sitting so close to her that John couldn’t tell whose legs were whose.
‘regarde’ - look
John looks up, and breaks Sherlock’s heart. ‘How can you not be bored, with me? After all of that? After all those- Oscar Wilde’s birthday party?’
had he remembered his name anyway?). ‘The other boy said it.’
was John’s but turned out to be both of theirs. Despite previous first impressions, Sherlock wasn’t the utter cock John had previously thought, and he was actually quite easy to talk to. Not that he wanted to talk much.
Irene’s eyes flicked up and down his form, a sultry smile on her face as she said, ‘darling. You look ravishing.’
He can’t live without the adrenalin and he can’t live without Sherlock: he knows this now and has no intention of letting go of either of them.
Sherlock didn’t move. Sherlock continued staring at the body, absolutely still. Sherlock was taking quick, shallow breaths, not even blinking.
‘With a woman,’ Morag interrupted. ‘Freya Lucas. She was studying medicine. They broke it off when Freya moved to South Africa, though they stayed in touch until your mother’s death. Can you imagine what would have happened if the newspapers caught wind of that?’
‘I see you know Michael from rugby, though you haven't played for a while due to your shoulder injury…’ Sherlock squinted at the new boy and cocked his head to the side. ‘Did you enjoy Mauritius? Probably not as much as you should have done, considering it was a cadets training camp. I doubt the army will take you now, not after the damage you did to your shoulder. I would focus on getting optimum grades in your A-levels of History, Biology, Chemistry and PE, though try not to overdo it on the PE. Your brother will contact you shortly, I’m sure, though I doubt he’ll be sober when he does. Have a good year.’  Sherlock stood up and turned back to his friends; Jim was killing himself laughing and even Mary was trying hard to hide a smile. They loved it when Sherlock deduced someone, the look on their surprised, ignorant faces as he embarrassed them and learnt all their secrets-
‘Love…find on…I don't know. Translate it for me?’
William’s look of relief faded. Morag’s smirk was gone.
John is everything, and as they give themselves to each other in the swimming pool building where Carl Powers breathed his last, Sherlock is absolutely fine with that.
In every sense of the phrase.’
They couldn’t do this, his brain tried to reason. They couldn’t reinforce this. This was against their human rights. This was-
for each other. John had never seen Sherlock like that with another human being before and he hated it, he hated it, he
Morag was standing up, arms crossed. Sherlock was on the other side of the room, dressed in a dark suit, his mouth open in a strange expression.
When Sherlock was six, he broke his wrist whilst asleep in bed.
‘Positive,’ Greg said. ‘I asked him about it, he told me to shut up and never tell anybody. But he definitely said that his mother killed himself. I asked Mycroft, but he just looked all shifty and said Sherlock had been affected worst by his mother’s death, and he might have been seeing things, or I might have misheard, but I promise you I didn't, and the way Sherlock said it...it was as if he was finally admitting something he'd kept secret for years.’
Sherlock was sweating even more, despite his thin shirt with the sleeves rolled up. ‘Oh- yeah. Ok. We have fun together, right?’
John. It’s disgusting.’
Harry snorted and put on a posh voice. ‘Presenting, Miss Harriet Jennifer Watson and Master John Hamish Watson of nowhere in particular.’
‘No.’
Sherlock looked up from the corpse and sighed. ‘Why the hell are

Sherlock nods, moving closer to the younger man, clasping the back of his neck with his hand. ‘Yes. Yes, you’re right. ‘A pause. ‘But to stop the sounds I’d have to stop doing this,’ he kissed Victor, gently, ‘And this,’ he threads his hands in Victor’s hair, ‘And this.’ He pulled them back together, craving the feel of Victor, every part of Victor, back against him. ‘Do you want that?’
John sat down next to him, sneaking looks at the other boy every now and then, but Sherlock was staring adamantly away from him. He didn't look at him once for the rest of the game, barely even spoke to him, and John was left to ponder his sexuality for the
John stood by the door, looking at Sherlock with eyes that begged him to say something.
John’s mouth fell open as he fixed his attention back on the people on the balcony, and this time he saw more than just random humans blocking out Sherlock. This time he saw William’s eyes, his nose, his cheekbones and thick hair. He saw William’s stature, his build, his height, and suddenly he remembered something Sherlock had said once, a few weeks before they started dating.
Sherlock knew who it was. He leaned forwards a little more and said triumphantly, ‘Am I the current King of England?’
'Why didn't we realise?' Harry said as the television flickered from black to static, signalling the address would start shortly. 'Were there any signs?'
‘Charlie.’ Sherlock smiled, striding towards his grandmother (
Sherlock could scarcely believe how close to fruition his dream had become.
‘Sherlock,’ John said calmly. His bags were packed, resting against the wall outside his room, and he was already wearing his jacket. ‘You have something to say.’
‘Fourteen,’ Mike muttered.
‘Dear God, Lestrade, have you ever seen that film? It’s the most depressing thing I’ve ever seen. John would probably start crying if I started it with
‘Sherlock!’ John shouted. Sherlock whipped around; he took a slight step backwards, closer to the edge, and John stepped forwards, reaching out. ‘Sherlock-‘
Jacob grabbed a hunk of Christopher’s hair and pulled; the older boy retaliated by picking up his brother and tickling his ribs. Charlie held the baby still and Sherlock wormed his way out, staggering over to John. ‘They’re getting far too big for me to do that,’ he puffed.
Sherlock laughed, and John was so close that he felt the warmth of his breath on his face. ‘You’re an exception, John.’ He paused, blinked, and said quietly, ‘You’re an exception to all of me.’
Sherlock grinned at Mike Stamford, clapping him on the shoulder. ‘Michael. It’s been a while. You look…’
’ She pauses and touches Sherlock’s upper arm, in a gesture that has become utterly familiar to them both. ‘Neither of us want it.’
Shut up
Because it was so late, there was no time to explore the resort and they went straight to bed. John was told he could share his mother’s bed but Harry instantly shot that down (
Sherlock rolled his eyes, and darted from the room without a backwards glance, leaving John kneeling on the floor, totally alone.
‘Alright, alright, you can say
‘Prison, Mary Morstan, skip.’ John sat back. ‘What are you studying? Where is your family? Who was that boy?’
Sherlock shuddered. ‘Just because Mike gives you brains doesn't mean you should name yourself after him.'
Sherlock stood up. ‘Maybe so,’ he said, perfectly composed, ‘but I am not going to listen to relationship advice from you, Philip. Unsuccessfully keeping your infidelity from your wife for three years has finally led to her seeking solace somewhere else; personally, I thought it would happen much faster. The baby is his, which you would know if you had paid even the
It was a hard truth, but it
John’s hand moved Sherlock’s head so they were eye to eye, noses brushing against each other. John’s eyes filled Sherlock’s vision, and he said breathlessly, ‘Did you know that your eyes are the exact colour of a springtime sky?’
has occured-‘ Sherlock said through gritted teeth, and John laughed. ‘To be continued,’ he whispered to Sherlock, before turning to his younger daughter. ‘What did you find, Tavvy?’
Sherlock didn’t need to open his eyes to know who it was. Firstly, Sherlock knew that voice better than he knew ash. Secondly, no one else ever came into his room. Thirdly, he could hear the impatient tap of the umbrella (
It had taken John an entire six months to realise that he could forgive Sherlock for what had happened. It had taken John another three months to realise that he couldn’t live without Sherlock.
‘You’re lying,’ Sherlock snapped. ‘My mother loved Mycroft-‘
John sits up, pulling Sherlock with him so they’re kneeling in front of each other, staring into each other’s eyes. ‘How can it only ever have been me? I’ve been alive for a fraction of your life, Sherlock.’
‘You told me,’ John said, jolting Sherlock back to the present, ‘that you had never been in a relationship.’
Jim didn't agree.
And suddenly it
This did not make it easier for John. At all.
‘Wait!’ Mike cried as Sherlock made to step through the gates. ‘I was meant to meet my mate today, at Bart’s-‘
It had taken John an entire six months to realise that he could forgive Sherlock for what had happened. It had taken John another three months to realise that he couldn’t live without Sherlock.
Sherlock rolled over and threw his left arm over his face. He would convince them he had to stay. They wouldn’t make him go. They
The barracks were silent. John knew there was nothing to be done. It was too late, if they'd seen it they'd seen it, and John could only hope that they either hadn't seen it or hadn't understood what it meant.
‘Sirs, I here present unto you King Sherlock, your undoubted King: wherefore all you who are come this day to do your homage and service, are you willing to do the same?’
Sherlock’s mouth dropped open. Mycroft finally turned to look at him, eyes flashing, and Sherlock realised that he was the first person that Mycroft had told about his homosexuality. Who else would he have told? Mycroft’s closest ‘friend’ was their third cousin, the heir to the estates in Yorkshire, and even if Mycroft had seen him in the last year Sherlock doubted he would share something so personal and with so much potential to do damage with a mere acquaintance.
‘Clones of each other?’ Rosie laughed, and in that moment John could picture her mothers laughing as she held their daughter, waving her chubby arms at Sherlock as he walked through their front door, how happy he’d been to have them all together. ‘Yeah.’
Mycroft looked suitably affronted, smoothing down his suit. ‘I don’t see what’s so funny,’ he said snootily. Sherlock snorted before turning to John and saying, eyes twinkling with mirth, ‘Mycroft’s always been obsessed with that stupid philosopher.’
When the surrogate, a pleasant woman by the name of Anthea Bridge, had gone into labour, entire flocks of people had gathered outside the hospital waiting. A young man by the name of William Wiggins (Sherlock had found him at a drug den when he had been going incognito in London one evening a year previously and had moved the boy into the palace as a page; Mycroft had been beyond furious) had gone out, exactly an hour after the birth, and put up a blackboard stating that a girl, born at 7:46 am on the eighth of October 2022, and a boy, born at 8:04 am on the eighth of October 2022, had been delivered and were healthy.
‘Harry!’ John gasped, reaching over to his sister and flinging one arm around her. ‘God, Harry, what are you doing here?’
Sherlock smiled back. ‘Thank you. I’m happy. I’m so, so happy.’
Irene coughed. ‘I told you we shouldn't hide it-‘
Victor was gazing at Sherlock with his ‘poor baby’ face on. ‘Sherl…’
John’s heart is broken.
‘You should have let me go with John, Mycroft, you know that.’ Sherlock replied in a tight, clipped voice. ‘There was no reason for you to forbid me-‘
The moment Henry realised what his son had seen, John found his eyes covered. ‘Don’t look, John. That is

He fell to his knees and looked up at the blue, shining sky. The grass was scratchy, even through his trousers, and the ground felt hard on his knees.
‘My,’ Lestrade had said quietly from behind him, jogging Ezra gently on his hip, ‘what exactly do you think they’re going to be doing during the ten minute drive to Sherwood?’
The tap of a champagne glass broke into their conversation, and Sherlock winced as his father stood and raised a glass. ‘All rise for the groom,’ he said happily, and Sherlock swallowed, glanced at his boyfriend- fiancé-

‘What?’ William managed to say. ‘What?’
Jim smiled evilly. ‘Don’t interrupt, I’m not finished. You pull out the ejaculate and you say (continuing on from the last sentence, of course) so will you come to prom with me?’
‘They don’t speak of it.’ Sherlock said quietly. ‘They pretend they never knew anything. Mycroft and Trisha are fine with it, but everyone else…it’s the ultimate sin. I told them it was an accident, a one-off, and they believed me. I hope.’
Yes. Everything would be fine.
‘I’m not scared,’ John said confidently. ‘Not if you’re here.’

John thought giddily, reaching up with one hand to move the errant curl back into place-

Mrs Hudson nodded (the staff were all deathly afraid of Morag) but lifted up four fingers; Sherlock shrugged helplessly. Clearly, his nanny was trying to tell him something, but for the life of him Sherlock couldn't understand.
head and then kissed his (
Sherlock smiled at the guard (
Nathaniel graduates with first-degree honours in Chemistry and Psychology from Oxford University on his twentieth birthday. He’d gone to Oxford a year early, though it should have been two; he’d repeated year thirteen because he’d ‘not wanted to be the youngest there by several years’. John suspects this was not the whole truth, if not a complete lie: he’d wanted to go to Oxford with his best friends, Charlotte Andrews and Callum Hooper, who were in the year below him. Although Mycroft and Sherlock’s parents had both disliked this decision, John hadn't cared because he loves his son and wants him to be as happy as possible.
But then John heard the words Sherlock was saying every time he breathed out.
‘Is she as insane as she looks?’ John joked. Sherlock laughed. ‘Yes. More so, even.’
‘It was a Friday,’ he whispered. ‘We made a cake in the morning, a chocolate cake, and then we went down to the lake and ate honey sandwiches. I was wearing my bee shirt and my blue shorts, with these blue shoes Mummy bought me. Mycroft helped us make the cake and then he cleaned me up; I splashed water at him, and he laughed at me. He was about to go to boarding school and I was upset, I thought I was going to miss him. My mother told us to go and play together, and we played pirates, but Mycroft wanted to write some notes on some experiment, so I was by myself. I thought- I thought I’d go and see mummy.’
‘John.’ Sherlock spoke first. ‘What-‘
Sherlock smiled back at her, remembering he had to be polite to John’s family, however weird they were acting. ‘Ok…nice to see you, Molly.’
‘I know.’ John shook his head in disbelief. ‘That’s the coolest thing I’ve ever seen.’
‘Good,’ Sherlock mumbled against John’s lips, ignoring Mycroft’s exclamation of disgust. ‘Don’t be too long, Doctor Watson.’
Becca kneeled and ripped off her rifle; she fired two shots in the direction of the eastern huts and said, ‘if you go out there, John, you'll get shot and you will die. Understand? Now answer my question. Why do you have a picture of you and the King? Are you dating? Is he a fag?’
John was thinking of the new King, the young King, the boy King.
‘Come
‘Cheeky?’ Sherlock protested. ‘I sound like one of the seven dwarves.’
Smith was at the front of the crowd, he told him. He had been right next to the helicopter when it opened and the King stepped out.
‘Pervert.’ Sherlock hissed. Lestrade blushed and stepped slightly away from the brothers as if embarrassed and Sherlock’s lip curled and he glared at the detective inspector. 'Oh come on, Lestrade, he's clearly been spying on his little brother having sex, which is both perverted, non-consensual and incestual-'
John shuddered and tried to think of something unsexy, like giant teddy bears and horse shit on his shoe. It worked a treat, though Mycroft was glaring again. John often felt like casually reminding Mycroft that Sherlock was both twenty-five years old and extremely powerful, with a hell of a lot more resources than his older brother. This was one of those times.
‘You know Mycroft doesn't like boyfriend, he prefers partner,’ Lestrade corrected as he waved one of the random DC’s that followed him around over.
‘Brilliant,’ Sherlock said when he was weighed and wrapped and snuggly in a woollen, dark blue sleeper suit that befit a son of John Watson. ‘Absolutely perfect.’
‘I know.’ Mycroft said, wincing. ‘But I didn’t stop it.’
Sherlock frowned, still unsure of what they were. ‘Open it,’ he said curiously. ‘What does the paper say?’
‘It’s different,’ Irene said, still gazing at the television. ‘Mycroft isn’t the King of the most powerful empire in the world, and the kids sweeten the deal.’
Unsurprisingly, Mycroft found out first.
John didn’t say anything, though as he looked into Sherlock’s eyes, he had the same thought that he did every time he saw the Prince on television.
‘Do you realise you swear when you’re angry?’ Irene said, still sitting on the bed. John pointed at her and said, ‘I swear to god if you say another word-‘
the truth. Sherlock wouldn't be broken if it wasn't for John.
Jim sighed. ‘No, Sherlock, you’re not getting it. It could be really romantic. Like, you could give him a head and say,’ he put on a girlishly high voice, ‘oh Johnny, my head says that I shouldn't like you because I’m an incredibly intelligent and unordinary human being and you’re a stupid little pet…’
He was being a freak; he was being stupid. Why did he care so much? Why did it matter to him that Sherlock had moved on?
‘My,’ Sherlock argued, ‘is a lot easier to say, and a lot less pretentious. And as Morag always says, we're meant to seem as common as possible to appeal to the public.’ He wrinkled his nose: even thinking about his father's advisor made him angry.
John, who was long used to the Holmes boys deducing, simply said, ‘Do they know who did it?’
John put his head in the hands.
The club was louder than Sherlock remembered, and brighter, which made his head ache and his eyes water, but at least he was out and around other people and not cooped up, bored out of his mind. There was so much to see here, almost too much (that’s what had gotten him started on the drugs in the first place – he tried to stay away from that), and everyone was
John looked shell-shocked and Sherlock prepared himself to be spat at or slapped.
Brilliant, beautiful
‘Nice of you to show up,’ Mycroft said absent-mindedly. He was shuffling files and shouting into his headset, though he clearly observed Sherlock’s red eyes and John’s hand clutching Sherlock’s so tightly the knuckles had gone white. ‘John-‘
It isn't just these sporting activities that gave him the thrill, though. John regularly taunts the other children, the bigger the better, just so they will chase him round the playground and he can run from them. He’ll pinch and whine and bite just to provoke a reaction and feel that rush of pure
‘You know my favourite word?’ John asked, only slightly surprised. ‘Course,’ Sherlock scoffed. ‘
‘Jacob.’ Sherlock corrected, smiling at his husband.
Mycroft stepped forwards and said, ‘the coronation of my younger brother will take place in the July of next year. He will be known as King Sherlock.’
and Sherlock knew if he was going to die right then he would feel accomplished because he had never, ever been happier than he was right in this moment.
‘Me,’ Sherlock and Christopher said at the same time. Sherlock slid off his chair and crawled towards Christopher's model, picking up the screwdriver and beginning to assemble it as his son muttered profanities at the model and in particular the
‘I’m sorry, John,’ he said softly. ‘I didn’t mean for it to end like this.’
The square was packed; there were twice as many guards. As the balcony doors began to open, Henry murmured, ‘do you think they’ll tell us how he died?’ Harry shrugged and John nodded slowly. 'If they can,' he said, and Henry nodded in understanding. Nobody had said what they were all thinking: that it was an assassination, that someone had killed him. Just like the death of his first wife, King William had perished in very strange circumstances, and John wondered if all was as it seemed for the tenth or eleventh time.
Archie gazed up at him with barely-concealed hero worship. ‘Can I come to your room tonight, Sherlock?’ He breathed. ‘Please?’
‘My name is Mycroft,’ Mycroft said. He looked around the room at this point before sighing and rolling his eyes. ‘The only A.T who speaks English isn't here, it’s his day off, so I suppose I’m showing you around. Right now, we’re in the Quad: this is what we call the Teen Club headquarters. The club is split into three groups: the first group,

and make it up to you. I let you die but I will keep our son from any danger he might ever run into, and he will grow up loved and knowing how much you would have loved him.’
’ he spat. ‘Why are you over here? Your group is on the
The moment they’d first touched had been something different, beautifully and complicatedly different. Sherlock couldn't explain it then, and he couldn't explain it now, six years later. An electric shock, an impulse, the desire to hold on tight and never let go because he had finally, finally found someone who understood him 100%, eternally and entirely.
William swallowed hard. ‘I can’t-‘ and he looked at the floor, seemed to come to some sort of decision, and looked back up. ‘I’m sorry, for not accepting you. It was- it must have been horrible for you. I don’t like it, Sherlock, but I’ll try.’
Jenny Watson, who was sitting morosely on the sofa, hadn’t stopped crying for almost three days.
It was a ten minute walk to Bart’s, the café he had planned to meet Mike at. He hadn’t seen much of his friend outside school over the past few months; Mike had landed one of the highly valued jobs as a guard at the palace, and his schedule was insane. Despite living just twenty minute walk from Buckingham palace, John had never seen any of the main royals; they kept themselves locked up, hardly daring to leave the safety of their palace in case-
Sherlock nodded. ‘One. The youngest bastard. His name is Dean, he lives in Buckinghamshire. He was nice, I suppose. At least, I didn’t instantly hate him.’
Harry opened her eyes. ‘Good.’ She grinned. ‘Right. Well, I’m just going to go now-‘
He reached Hunter and grabbed him under the arms. The other man made no sound, though John detected a low pulse when he put his fingers to his neck, and John started dragging him as quickly as possible towards Smith, who was almost crying. Time had sped up again; John’s arms ached, and Hunter's pulse was slowing.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. ‘But they’re wrong, and we know they’re wrong. It doesn’t matter if they think we’re together; we’re not, are we?’ Sherlock ignored the pang in his heart that followed these words and watched John, who shook his head and sighed. ‘I guess it’s better, doing it now. That way they find out from us that you've been secret best friends with the heir to the throne for the last year and a half.’
‘Vous aviez besoin, ma chérie. Votre père vous veut là-bas, l'organisation de la chose déclaration de la police.’ - You are needed, darling. Your father wants you over there, organising the police statement thing.
If it falls through…’ He drifted into silence, and John bit his lip. This sounded serious.
‘Fuck all.’ Harry said as she stood up and stormed out of the room. ‘Fuck them, and fuck you.’
Our Molly?’
Nathaniel coughs. ‘Papa, I’ve got something to tell you.’
All three of his children looked around the room, before declaring as one, ‘no.’
‘Floor 4, room 2.’ John nodded, grabbed his daughter’s hand and followed Sherlock to the elevator, which was now open and containing a very excited thirty-nine year old detective.
‘That’s right,’ Mycroft said coldly. ‘You didn't. Well done, Morag. You’ve just destroyed any chance of him keeping you on when he becomes King.’
His parents smiled fondly and left with a wave, and Sherlock settled back in his sheets, absentmindedly tracing the red bruises, and wondering just where his soulmate was, and, most of all, if he was ok.
‘You’re impossible,’ John smiles, and Nathaniel nods in agreement. ‘I was so easy compared to you. Papa must’ve been delighted.’ Charlotte laughs and John chuckles with her: he’s come to view Nathaniel’s best friend as a sort of daughter to him. They’ve been best friend’s since they were in Nursery, and even when Nathaniel was moved up another year they stayed firm friends. Together with Molly’s son, Callum, they were quite a force to be reckoned with.
The camera zoomed in on his face, and John's breath froze in his mouth.
And with that, Mycroft stalked away.
‘They’re about to come out.’ Harry whispered, shooting a look at John, who ignored her completely. It was the first time he was going to see Sherlock’s face in almost a year and a half.
Sherlock’s voice softened a fraction as he said, ‘are you really going to do this? Disown me, Father? Just for…just because of who I am?’
but he…he seems to have let it go.’
Or rather, get someone else to think of something else for him.
The small blond man knocked back the tequila he was holding and smiled blurrily. He was highly intoxicated, much more than Sherlock, and Sherlock wasn’t exactly sober at this point. ‘Hey,’ the man grinned, pressing himself closer to Sherlock and pressing his hands on his waist. Sherlock felt a small shock through his clothes but dismissed it as the drink: nowadays, stimulants always had a slightly off effect on him. He peered at the man closely, but his deductions were slightly off and all he could really tell was that the man was training to be a surgeon, was a fan of physical activity and was about twenty-two, which was three years older than Sherlock.
This time, John broke away, and Sherlock just stared at him, his beautiful eyes saying
‘We’ll be ok.’ He reached out and Sherlock crossed the room, taking his hand and bringing it gently to his lips, in an old-fashioned gesture that still took John’s breath away, nine years after he first did it. ‘As long as you’re here, my John, I’ll believe that.’
Except, John thought, it was exactly like him and Sherlock. Every time he looked at Sherlock he didn't seem able to breathe, every time Sherlock talked he was caught, even if it was about the most boring thing in the world (243 types of ash, even), every time they touched John felt those electric sparks.
John’s fault.
Mycroft, who was pacing towards him, frowned heavily. ‘Where have you been, little brother?’
Irene separated herself from John before pecking him once more on his lips and backing away. ‘Sorry, sorry,’ she laughed, ‘I just can’t stop kissing him. Young love and all.’
‘Clara,’ the woman said shyly. She looked about John’s age, so a couple of years younger than Harry, but she didn’t seem that freaked out that he was holding the hand of the King so John liked her instantly. ‘Pleasure to meet you,’ he smiled.
‘Huh?’ John asked in wonder. There were stacks of paper everywhere, a desk with an Apple laptop sitting on it, a skull over a fire and a cow skull. A sofa and comfortable looking chairs sat by the fire, and in the kitchen several test tubes and vials were set up.
Molly nodded hard, refusing to look Sherlock in the eye. ‘Me…too?’
When John was sixteen, he witnessed the London pride parade from the top floor of the house of commons (aka parliament).
Victor didn’t even hesitate. ‘Hell, yeah.’
If there’s one thing that John knows for sure, it’s that he has no idea would have happened if he hadn’t met Sherlock. There was a short answer – one word, seven letters, the most abhorrent and tragic word in the English language – but he didn’t even want to think about that. Not now. Not now-
And now Sherlock thought about it John probably was cheating on him. Who would want monogamy with someone like Sherlock? Sherlock was fucked-up, a freak, a sociopath. He couldn't blame John, not at all.
The crowd were utterly silent. The Watsons were utterly silent.
‘I don’t mind, Lestrade, honestly.’ Sherlock crouched back down and surveyed the body. ‘I don't care what people that much stupider than me think of my intelligence. Jealousy, I assume-‘
They’d spent four weeks together, talking and laughing and playing, and John had had the
‘John Watson,’ the new boy said. It was a plain, normal, simple name that seemed to fit him perfectly and Sherlock’s smile widened. ‘It must be odd moving to a new school halfway through your A levels. It’s a shame about your father but at least you’re happier with him behind bars.’
He walked to the door and slammed it, running away from his quarters and from James Moriarty.
‘I’m not interrupting anything, am I?’ The voice behind Sherlock was sarcastic, angry and dripping with venom.
Molly burst into tears and ran in the opposite direction.
‘Can’t he just say one word?’ Sherlock said mildly. ‘His favourite word?’
Dante shook his head solemnly, black curls falling into his eyes. ‘Sorry, Pa.’
The boy, John, was staring at him in wide-eyed astonishment. ‘That was epic, mate, how did you do that? How did- did Mike tell you about me?’
advisor. ‘Leave you? Why would I do that? Sherlock, that nanny was clearly mentally ill in some way. She abused you, Sherlock, mentally and physically. She abused a five year old boy and convinced you of things that weren’t true. If she had told you that now you would know it was bullshit; you were five. God, if I could see her now…’ John tried to look as threatening as possible, which probably didn't work considering he was wearing military pyjamas and didn’t have any use of his left (and favourite) arm.
‘John-‘
The last thing he remembered before he blacked out was the shadow of a person that he almost recognised, with dark hair and snake-like eyes, sitting on top of the hut, blocking out the sun.
Sherlock couldn't say anything to that. John knew it, and he turned slightly away. ‘You still love him.’
): Sherlock had agreed for him to pay Lila because Mycroft still owed him for sending him into exile fourteen years earlier, and telling James Moriarty all his secrets. ‘Right. Well. Great that that’s going on without us knowing, but…is everything ok?’
‘Just John, Jack.’ John said for the millionth time. ‘Please?’
He felt Sherlock’s hand on his shoulder. ‘John…?’
As a fairly sheltered ten-year-old boy, the most experience John had with the term
‘I’m not your sloppy seconds, Irene Adler,’ Janine snapped. Irene simply raised one eyebrow and held out her hand: Janine hesitated before taking it and following Irene out of the bushes.
.’ John took a deep breath. ‘I got your voicemail this morning, I was out with Sarah.’ Sherlock’s lips pursed and John nodded. ‘I know. I know you don’t like her. The thing is, Sherlock, the moment I got it I knew I needed to see you and I didn’t know why, but I was in the car and we were driving and I was just remembering every time me and you were in the car together, like that time we went to Devon, and then I realised that you would soon be gone for what, a year, and I didn’t want that but it wasn’t that I didn’t want that, it was like, I didn’t
Sherlock talked about a little boy who had been told that he was crazy, a liar, attention-seeking. He had been belittled, over and over, until he associated the memory of his mother with that feeling of despair and loneliness and sorrow.
John didn't realise the music had stopped until Janine cleared her throat and said, ‘Well. That was hot.’
Jacob thought briefly before shouting back, ’19!’
Yes, Sherlock had always been slender. Yes, he had always been thin. Before John had become his friend, he had been underweight, severely enough that the palace doctors had been instructed to start checking him at least once a week (again. God it was inconvenient when that happened).
And then he called John. Sitting at his desk, foot tapping anxiously against the floor, phone ringing in his ear, he felt almost sick. He loved John, he was his best friend, and he didn’t know how he would be able to live without him for that long. They’d been inseparable for four years, and the thought of not seeing John for a month, let alone a year, made him feel shaky-
Victor pushes Sherlock away from him, glaring as fiercely as he can, but Sherlock is so overcome with arousal that he can barely think. ‘Quieter? How am I meant to be quieter? You are the one- you are the one causing these sounds, you are the one making the noise.’
‘And,’ Sherlock said, and John could tell he was working up to something because his voice was almost trembling, the deep baritone taking on a slightly higher edge, ‘I would like to be there, too.’
‘No.’ Sherlock said clearly.
‘John, I need to tell you something.’
John didn’t say anything as Sherlock smiled at his grandmother before making an excuse to leave and then made his way to the stairs, simply following him slowly. As Sherlock navigated the hallways he attempted to talk to the older boy, but John just answered with a single word or ignored him altogether. Sherlock had no idea what was wrong with him: did he think
Sherlock quickly took out a piece of paper, jotted something down on it with the pen Irene had left on the table, and pocketed it. Ignoring Hamish’s curious looks and Mycroft’s querying gaze, he followed him out of the room, up two flights of stairs and into a small room that overlooked the hall: he could see Irene talking to Anthea, Jim sitting next to a huge blonde boy with stupid eyes. ‘Why did you take me here?’ He hissed, ducking down. ‘They can’t see me, I’ll be called down-‘
The thing that Harry didn’t realise, John thought, was that their mother wasn’t crying for William. Not anymore.
Sherlock merely smiled and threw himself off the roof, catching the drainpipe and shimmying down the next two floors.
‘S-sorry?’ Morag stuttered. Sherlock turned around, walking towards John. Pain was evident in his eyes; he looked like he was going to start crying, but he said in a slightly cracked tone, ‘I choose John.’
‘I was busy,’ Sherlock grinned. ‘I have more important things to do than a children's
It was one of those parties where anything is possible.
‘Are you insane?’ John said, momentarily forgetting who he was talking to before remembering and clapping his hand over his mouth. ‘Sorry-‘
‘She has an ulterior motive,’ Mycroft said for what must have been the billionth time, because he ignored everything Sherlock said. ‘She’ll hurt you, Sherlock, and I don’t want to see that happen-‘
James rolled his eyes. ‘You’re being dramatic, dear. As to why I came back, I missed you, Sherly, and I thought it was about time. You’ve certainly…matured.’ Jim licked his lips and raised an eyebrow suggestively. ‘And I’m sure you’ve learnt plenty of new…tricks that I’d be more than willing to try out with you-‘
went to Cambridge, he was even more arrogant than the others. ‘But I didn’t even tell you-‘
John was standing before he knew what he was doing, eager to follow Sherlock, before his brain caught up. ‘Where-‘
Sherlock sighed. ‘I can’t change the rule, John, that would look suspicious. You should be glad I told them that, as a minor, you were exercising your right to have your face blurred out.’
Janine sighed, taking the bottle and taking a big swig. ‘Don’t drink it then, pussies. More for me.’
Sherlock sighed. ‘I suppose…’
‘I know, I’m sorry. After Sherlock threw me out…I swear, I’m not really with him, I just didn’t have anywhere else to go, and I’m so good at being a criminal…it’s no excuse. I’m sorry. I heard the gunshot, I’m assuming you killed Morag?’
and it wasn’t good.
‘He didn’t,’ Sherlock replied, his mouth breaking into an oddly realistic smile. He surveyed John for a brief period of time, just long enough for John to get incredibly uncomfortable, and then smiled. ‘You owe me ninety nine pence. And also coffee.’
‘Right.’ Sherlock nodded. He could see a blond head in the corner and smiled. He had always thought blond hair seemed so much….happier.
‘Uhhh…’ John said. Sherlock appeared to take this as a yes. ‘Technically, my name is William Sherlock Scott, heir to the throne of the Holmes Kingdom, but you may call me Sherlock. Sherlock Holmes.’
John turned to look at the television: the screen was still totally black. He checked his watch; ten minutes.
‘Does Doctor Watson not get a say in this?’ Mycroft looked at John for the first time, eyes reading him quickly, before sighing. ‘Fine,’ he said, not even letting John reply. ‘I won’t cancel it. Be on the balcony at three-thirty.’
It’s a cold winter morning, and John’s knackered from being up and down with the baby all night. He stays in bed while Lizzie entertains him, giving him his bottle, and John can hear them laughing and playing in the sitting room and he’s overwhelmed with guilt. Guilt that his thirteen year old daughter is spending her Saturday morning looking after the child that John cannot love, guilt that everyone seems to be forgetting Sherlock and, of course, guilt that he cannot bond with his son. No father wants to stare at his baby and feel nothing but John can’t help it, and he doesn't know how much longer he can handle it.
They were all looking at him and Sherlock swallowed hard. It had been almost two years since the James incident, and he had reassured them it had just been a one-off, an experiment, though how they had managed to believe that was in not understandable to him. He hadn’t shown any homosexual preferences openly since, though, so maybe he had managed to reassure them, but Sherlock hated hiding, especially about something he was not ashamed of-
‘You have too many ghosts for me to join you in wedlock.’ He laughs at that, because never before has he been so perfectly summed up:
And Sherlock stepped out onto the balcony.
). ‘It’s been too long. How have you been?’
Sherlock was reduced to a crying mess in John’s arms and John couldn't let Sherlock continue like that- he
much. It’s rooms 221, 189 and    852. John, would you come with me? The team’s rendezvoused in the Teen Club Quad.’ When John looked confused, Siger explained, ‘It’s the only room with fully-functioning air conditioning.’
Sherlock bent his head close to John’s and whispered, ‘I can tell your life story just by looking at you.’
John had nodded, though even that hurt. ‘Don’t tell anyone.’
They are running very low on servants.
‘A bit jealous too, I imagine,’ he grins. ‘Didn’t you graduate from shitty University in the North?’
‘Christ.’ John put his head in his hands, cursing the over-protective uncle over and over in his head. ‘That’s not necessary.’
Sherlock slowly turned around, looking straight at his father. ‘Dad?’ He said softly, and John couldn't ever remember Sherlock calling William anything but Father but clearly he must have done at some point because William’s face softened as he remembered some past Sherlock who used to put his arms up to be picked up by his Daddy and he sighed. ‘I couldn’t disown you, son. I couldn’t hurt you like that. Come here.’
The image of Sherlock’s smiling face appeared in front of John’s eyes. John quickly wiped it from his memory; he couldn’t think of Sherlock.
‘You need to be there at six p.m tonight,’ Mycroft said. ‘Irene, dress appropriately.’
Jesus, John. Anyone but the Prince. Seriously.
That’s a lie.’ Sherlock blushed furiously and avoided eye contact. ‘John, I need to ask you something-‘
It was beyond humiliating to be approaching your boyfriend completely naked after cheating on him with the biggest threat to the security of his country since Al Qaeda as the come of the biggest threat to the security of his country since Al Qaeda slid slowly down the inside of his legs.
Sherlock laughed until he thought his sides would split. When had John become so
Sherlock didn’t doubt that James was telling the honest truth when he said that they were two halves of one whole. They were meant to be together, meant to join and become invincible-
His mind was racing, his breathing laboured. Why had Sherlock suddenly got a girlfriend? He had told John over and over that he was gay.
‘I never said she didn’t,’ Morag replied. ‘I said she didn’t originally want him. What else? She had a three year relationship at university.’
‘John!’ Sherlock said excitedly, the rainbow on his cheek crinkling. ‘We need to go!’
Nothing,
‘Why would you think that?’ Sherlock cracked all ten of his knuckles simultaneously, and John winced. ‘Sorry. But can I not just come and see of my…my John, without being accused of an ulterior motive?’
The next morning Jenny woke him up at half past eight because ‘Teen club starts in half an hour, John!’ The resort they were staying at was an all-inclusive deal, where the parents got drunk and slept by the pool all day whilst the children were entertained by the staff, or as they were called here
‘I’m always right.’ She kisses him, softly, and pulls away. ‘You’ll find someone who can handle your ghosts, one day. When human beings can- can fly, can communicate with a man on the other side of the world at a whim, can be who they are without fear of persecution.’
He reached the main building just as the main doors opened and Sherlock sauntered out, chatting happily chatting away with a Chinese boy. ‘John!’ He said when he saw the older boy, saying cheerfully, ‘Did you miss me too much-‘
’Right,’ Irene said, and as John tore his eyes away from Sherlock he noticed that she looked angrier than he had ever seen. ‘He’s overstepped the boundary. That’s
It started off awkwardly, with John unsure where to put his hands, but he’d forgotten that Sherlock was a fucking amazing dancer. Even dirty dancing seemed to be his thing, even when he was only fifteen and as sexually unexperienced as a newborn, but there was something about his long limbs, his blue eyes, his playful, drunken smirk, even the too big shirt on a thin body that made John’s brain short-circuit. He actually got into it, following Sherlock’s lead, and the smirk soon faded into something else entirely-
There was a letter in the letterbox on the Friday morning; John retrieved it himself, opening it on the doorstep. It simply informed them there was a mandatory television viewing at three p.m and anyone not watching would be arrested.
Ella, who was digging through a cupboard in the back of the room, snorted. ‘Not the word I’d use.’
cleaning.’ Violet stamped her foot and glared at her twin sister, who was calmly polishing her father’s skull. ’I don’t,’ Tavvy grinned. ‘Daddy, doesn't Billy look smart?’
Let John go. Full stop, end of sentence, end of friendship, end of life together. He
When John was thirteen, he saw the London pride parade on the news as he sat with a group of his friends in front of the TV after a sleepover.
And thus a friendship was born.
John just stared at him. ‘You know what’s wrong with me, Sherlock. Or have you been tuning me out again?’
‘I have never done kisses in my life and I am not willing to start now. Much too Molly.’
John glared witheringly at Sherlock before continuing. ‘If Jacob is a genius then I will have to hire help. Harry would love to live with us-‘
‘I like
It was magnificent.
‘Everything looks like shit on you, brother
‘No,’ John sulked. ‘I don't know when you’ve been looking but it’s
‘Go out-‘ Sherlock began automatically before stopping, knowing it would piss off John. It was too late, though; John curled his lip. ‘I know. I’ll sneak out the back door and into the grounds, like a teenager, because I’m not even meant to be allowed here.’ He strode to the door and slammed the door.
Sherlock snorted. ‘You honestly think Mycroft is the first of my father’s children? William’s got at least seven other illegitimate offspring. There’s Olivia, in Norfolk; Paul, in Cheshire; Daniel and Lucas in Kent; Isla in Dorset, Annabelle in Inverness, and Dean in Buckinghamshire.’ Mycroft had told him about his half-siblings less than a year before, clearly hoping to shock him; Sherlock had been more surprised that there weren’t more. He had his suspicions about another sibling (whilst reading his mother’s diary, he had come across the name ‘Sherrinford’. He had been just three or four; he had dismissed it as an uncle but he later found he had no uncle named Sherrinford) but it had never been proven, so he didn’t think about it.
'Well, for future reference, apologising for the death of a man who died under suspicious circumstances isn't your best bit. You might be put under surveillance. Arrested. I could do anything to you.' Sherlock raised his eyebrows at John and smiled, and the other boy laughed and Sherlock felt a warm feeling in his chest that he hadn't felt in
'I suppose,' Sherlock frowned as he did up his laces. 'We would be good together.'
‘When I lived here I made it a project to acquaint myself with all the secret rooms. This is one. Now shut up and listen, we don’t have long.’
As if reading his mind, Mycroft said, ‘this feels like a teenage girl’s slumber party.’
And John’s face flashed in Sherlock’s mind palace.
‘You’re not boring.’ The boy mused, leaning back in his chair, and John felt a brief spark in his chest: the boy had said he was not boring, and no one ever said he was not boring. ‘I might as well…if I want to stop being bored…what’s your name?’
‘The first,’ Sherlock whispered, ‘is that King Sherlock William Scott is a homosexual, and has been since he was fourteen years old.’
John gaped. Molly gaped. Sarah looked secretly pleased.
Sherlock smiled. ‘I shall have to help you with that, later, though my knowledge is limited. I tend to zone out when people discuss my family.’
‘I am a native,’ Sherlock said absentmindedly, still looking around. John shook his head as he straightened up, looking around. ‘Nah, Sher. You were born in France, your first language was French, you’ve lived in France all your life. You are
Irene teased, but when Molly plucked up the courage to ask her to be her girlfriend a few days after it stopped abruptly. John was happy for Irene and Molly, really happy, because as different as they were they seemed to belong together. Molly toned Irene down, Irene brought out Molly’s funner side, and they made each other happy. In those three weeks that John saw Molly and Irene together, John saw both of them smile more than he’d ever seen either of them smile before.
‘IT KEEPS YOU SAFE-‘
Irene turned around and did a thumbs up, realising that John had cottoned on. ‘Love you too, Johnny!’
He didn't even think. It was instinct to remove the distance between them in one long step and take John’s head between his hands and kiss him, kiss him like he’d never kissed him before, try to put everything he felt into one kiss.
‘No.’ Sherlock whispered. ‘I didn’t. I didn't, John/'
There were so many words he wanted to say.
This belief had been affirmed for him countless times. When he was three, his father (William Holmes, Snr) went to the supermarket to buy milk: he was killed by an eighteen-wheeler on the way back. When he was five, his mother (Violet Holmes) went out for dinner with her friend Jane: she met a man named Siger at the restaurant, and four years later they were married. When he was six, his brother wrote a lengthy letter to the Prime Minister about the poor diplomatic decisions that were being carried out by the government: the next day, a black car arrived at the door, and Sherrinford was gone forever. When he was eleven, he started secondary school, and he met a boy called John Watson.
Sherlock shrugged. ‘You should be more alert.’ John stifled a smile, turning back to the window and looking at the crowd. ‘They look so happy, don’t they?’
‘And that is why.’ Irene smiles, a sad smile. ‘I wouldn’t have married you anyway, Sherlock. I don’t need that, and neither do you. Both of us need freedom, and both of us are here for Felix. You will be here for him forever, but he needs to be my priority.’
‘Car,’ Sherlock said, and John could hear him moving, sitting up maybe. ‘I didn't want to get instantly shot down when I did this.’
‘You should just ask him.’
‘Why should you go out?’ John said, not liking how Mycroft spoke to his sister. Mycroft shot him an amused look (John hated that look) and said, ‘if I don’t, it will look like Sherlock’s family don’t approve of his relationship with you. Archie and Trisha would go on but we don’t want Archie to react strangely, even if it's a joke; we’re just trying to lessen the media load that will begin the moment Sherlock makes it clear what…what the nature of your relationship is.’
‘Lightweight,’ John teased, though in all seriousnesses he felt far drunker than Sherlock looked. Sherlock scowled down at him and kicked out, missing completely and falling flat on his arse. ‘Shit,’ he swore. ‘Fucking stupid fucking coordination.’
John was totally overloaded straight away.
Sherlock nodded. ‘They do.’
You could have heard a pin drop. John was stock-still, staring in shock at James, who was still looking at Sherlock, who opened his eyes and stared back at him, at that hateful, evil, psychopathic boy who he had once, loved with all his heart, and yet even now, as Jim brought down his and John’s relationship, the best thing that had ever happened to him, Sherlock couldn't hate him. Still.
‘Come.’
Sherlock frowned. ‘That’s very odd. I’d been planning on asking you for months, my friends all had a bet on it-‘
And then Nathaniel is sprinting out of the delivery room, cheeks flushed and eyes shining, and he shouts, ‘boys! Two boys! Twin boys! Safely delivered and perfect, healthy,
John didn’t say anything. Sherlock sighed. ‘I came to apologise. You must understand, I don’t- I don’t do this sort of thing. Communication with new people, talking about my life, what I’ve done.’
Get out.’
‘Ahem,’ John said, wracking his brains before deciding a stab in the dark was the best chance he had. ‘A circle…where people did philosophy?’
That was a big one: Sherlock had turned up, materialized out of the blue, at a time when John was completely alone and afraid. From the moment he had burst into his life, Sherlock Holmes had been there for John Watson, and he wanted to tell him how grateful he was for that.
‘I haven’t tried it.’ John glanced up at him. ‘But…I’d be willing.’
It was like he had some sort of sex radar or something, plugged into that fantastic game of his.
And then, as if by magic, he hears the clip-clop-clip of a horse on his track.
‘Apparently he absolutely adores Sherlock.’ Harry said in a mock-secretive voice. ‘He hero-worships him. No idea why, though I bet it means we have another little cunt in the making.’

Sherlock took a careful step towards his father, then another, until they were face to face. ‘Dad?’
‘Love.’ Mycroft sounded disgusted. ‘Love is the sole reason that humanity have disagreements. Without love there would be perfect harmony and everyone would be content.’
thing, though. Well
Do you want to have a look around the resort and,’ he waggled his eyebrows, ‘enjoy me?’
‘At least there are three bedrooms,’ Jenny said positively. ‘A room each. That’s nice.’
’ She tossed her hair, grabbed John’s hand, placed it on her waist and then stood on her tiptoes and kissed him.
He even seemed more confident as he carried John’s suitcase to his room, jabbering on about something Irene had said or something Mike had done, and John wasn't even listening, just watching Sherlock being animated, talking and laughing and being
John raised his eyebrows but didn't comment, focusing on what Irene had said about Sherlock. ‘But…Sherlock’s here?’
’ He swore, almost falling over. Irene wasn't heavy but John was only four inches taller than her (
even as we watched our family die, the people we grew up with die, our first lives die.’ He pauses. ‘After that, it was easier. I went through the centuries avoiding making long-term commitments to mortals, as friends, lovers, companions. It was easier to face eternity alone, and the first four-hundred years of my existence were easy enough. Until my son was born.’
Of course, it was one thing saying it to a toddler and another saying it to the man you were in love with.
If Sherlock believed in one thing, it was that the smallest things can change your life forever.
‘I DID NOTHING! I OPENED THE DOOR!’ Sherlock reached into the oven to try and grab the biscuits, save them from the flames, but only succeeded in burning his hand, all the way across the palm. ‘GODDAMMIT, MOLLY, WHAT SHOULD I DO?’ He turned around and Molly had gone; he looked around the kitchen and she was nowhere to be seen. ‘THIS IS NOT THE TIME FOR A TOILET BREAK!’ He screamed. ‘MOLLY!’
