“I’m not going to just sit here and not say anything. We’re all thinking it.” Ms Hawkins waved her hand around the table as she leaned back in her chair.
Holmes shook his head before making his entrance. For some reason he hopped over the chair that was a between himself and Ms Adler.
Stamford refilled his drink for the third time as he finished telling Holmes the story of that dreadful day. Watson had moved over to the couch, leaving the desk chair to Stamford. Lestrade was sitting on the edge of the desk, arms crossed, still angry at Holmes.
Watson pulled out the pages he had written a few nights ago and started reading, rubbing his leg absent mindedly. What was most surprising to Watson was how different this new story was. He had been writing romantic scripts for so long that it felt odd, unfamiliar, but Watson couldn’t deny the slight thrill he felt when he immersed himself, slowly discovered this new universe. It didn’t take long until he loaded a blank page into the typewriter.
Holmes knew that voice, he knew that he knew that voice, but it was different. How was it different? It was, it was… Irish? A confused look painted itself across Holmes face when the Irish voice spoke again.
He had been at the Warehouse computer for half an hour already, muttering to himself. John had acquainted himself with the few facilities the Warehouse offered. A small fridge that looked like it predated WW2. A toaster, kettle and microwave were all he had to work with. He should have guessed there wasn’t any milk. Grunting loudly, he sat in the twin of the chair he had claimed as his own in 221b, looking over the file as he sipped his tea. The pawn shop owner who had stabbed John was named Tim Cridley. He had been in debt because of a gambling problem and had gone looking for a high paying side job, quick money for some possible shady work. He had started asking around and one evening, someone had slipped a phone into his pocket. The call he had gotten told him that they had heard he had some dept they could help him with. They had agreed to meet in a coffee shop two blocks from his shop. John frowned when he read that that was all the man remembered. Next thing he’d known, he had had an envelope in his pockets with a burner phone and a pair of latex gloves. There had also been strict instructions to go to King’s Cross to collect objects in a locker with those gloves. Then he had to take back whatever he would find to sell in his shop with a promise that money was going to be transferred directly into his account. It had been going on for the past two years. John was surprised it hadn’t been on Sherlock’s radar before. Then again, Mycroft had said he had been looking into it personally.
They stepped back inside and found Ms Hooper and Ms Hawkins at the table talking animatedly. They turned when Stamford and Holmes came in.
“Enjoying seeing you falling flat on your face you mean?” Lestrade chuckled. “Nah, but I really enjoy seeing Morgan lose it over a little bit of blood. He’s so dramatic, he should be on The Guiding Light.”
John looked confused, a deep blush spread across her cheeks and neck. “I… I thought you were going to ask for a sample.”
“Well,” John started, unsure what to say after the day’s events and considering they were heading into more danger soon. “That was an interesting case.”
Watson enjoyed hearing Ms Adler laugh at that. “But Edward is too caught up in his head to see what’s obvious to the audience, that Jane does feel the same way.” Watson paused, fighting against the lump in his throat. “Edward misunderstands Jane, again, and tries to fix things.” Watson cleared his throat and continued singing.
They arrived at the bottom of the steps and Lestrade turned right. It was a long straight stretch to the studio door, where they could see no one waiting for them, and the studio door was ajar.
“The point is,” Sherlock continued, trying not to focus on why John was smiling at him like that. “Meeting you... meeting you is been best thing that ever happened to me. Even though I am inexperienced in intimate relationships, I promise you that I will do everything I can to do better. To be better. A better man. If it means you’ll stay.”
“Lestrade probably found it during his round and brought it upstairs,” Watson said, and they continued tracing their steps all the way back to the infirmary.
“Who are you and what have you done with Watson?” Murray asked, making the group laugh. “I’m serious. What happened to the guy who stormed into rehearsal because of script notes?”
Sherlock wasn’t surprised to see John had given him most of the leftover sauce. “Thank you.” He made a show of his first bite for John’s benefit and hummed. “Delicious.”
Moriarty must have staged everything from the last movie getting bad reviews, to getting word around about Jimmy Morgan’s brilliant up and coming career as a director so Stamford would be interested in hiring him. This must have taken months to set up. Sherlock had to admit it was a good plan. Not good enough to fool him completely, but still commendable.
Rather than dealing with his erection, Sherlock headed for his computer as soon as he got home. He had research to do.
“Long story. Don’t ask Mrs. Hudson about it, she gets cranky at me for days after.” John smiled at the idea of Sherlock messing up enough to have such a lovely lady pissed at him.
“It’s called The Eclipse.” Sherlock explained, opening the lock just as they heard the door leading to the shop open. “Come on.” He added as he pushed the door open wider to let John out before grabbing the Eclipse and slipping out, closing the exit door quietly behind him.
“You came in yesterday, tried a few paddles, then bought three hundred pounds worth of lingerie for your friend. The next day you came back, talked me into the investigation, then bought more lingerie. So is she really just a friend, or do you have a lingerie fetish?”
“It wouldn’t matter if it was horse manure. The investigation led here, so here we are. Now go shop.” Sherlock manoeuvred her further into the shop. “And take your time,” he added quietly.
“Because It’s boooring.” Morgan sung. “Let me guess, they end up together in the end? Sooo predictable.” Enunciating each syllable mockingly.
“It has come to my attention that the GPS has been tampered with.” Irene explained patiently. This got an instant reaction from Sherlock; he stood from his chair and silently walked to the door leading to the elevator. Halfway there he pointed to it, his back to the rest of the room.
During lunch break, Holmes went through his notes from the night before and transcribed some of them into the script he borrowed from Dimmock.
Holmes paused and frowned. “But you’re currently helping the boss of a drug cartel expand into manufacturing and distributing LSD.”
“Right.” The soldier hesitated a second before taking his knee off him. He knew the man was right. He couldn’t say why exactly, but he knew. Watson stood back, his weapon ready, as the man twisted around, struggling to sit up. “So either you answer me now, or you wait until you’re in a locked room. So I’m going to ask one last time. Who are you and what were you planning on doing?” His voice was almost pleasant, friendly even. But the commanding undertone was present. The man stared at Watson. Watson stared back. When he was about to lose patience and head back to the team, the door they came in opened and in walked two guards. Without thinking, the soldier grabbed the man and pulled them to cover behind one of the work stations before bullets rained on them.
“You keep forgetting where you work.” Sherlock reproached, but John didn’t bite and waited for him to continue. “You already know about Bronzing.”
Cursing at the cold floor, John stood and dressed quickly. Still pulling on his oatmeal coloured jumper, he hurried down the stairs. He was greeted by an impatient looking Sherlock who shoved his coat into his arms.
Wiggins’s eyes met Dimmock’s in the mirror, stunned by Holmes’s first try. Then they both turned to him.
The agent frowned as he looked over his shoulder. He didn’t stop running but explained. “The jade elephant has the ability to absorb and project electrical energy. We’re going use it to absorb the excess tangential energy the artifacts are generating and discharge it onto the metal plate to store it into the battery you’re wearing.  Hopefully, we can stop it from spreading, repair the neutralizing system before the dark vault’s backup system fails and get rid of that bloody GPS. This way.”
Anderson’s eyes followed her inside before his feet did. Neither Anderson nor Ms Riley noticed the rest of the crew watching as they worked.
. When she was home she had her hands down her pants more often than not. Imagining what Sherlock would look like on her knees with thighs wrapped around her head. How her hair would look with John’s fingers buried in her curls as she tugged lightly, or not so lightly. How John would sound as she orgasmed…
Watson scratched the back of his head. “Yeah, that sort of… happens sometimes. So, I thought I’d play- oh!”
John yawned and stretched his legs as best he could in the small space. “Either way, I didn’t really have a social life before I became an agent, so not much change there.”
This time Sherlock didn’t have to wait. It was so sudden he almost gasped in surprise as the length of the paddle struck the width of his arse. The sensation was completely different. Barely any sound, just a dull thud as the hardwood hit his clothed flesh. But the impact was much harder than the leather ones, making the initial pain intense at first, the area throbbing before decreasing in waves, like a stone in still water.
I wish I could have given Irene more time in this one. She will be back, but only briefly, which saddens me because I went a bit crazy and did this HUGE back story that will not make it into the story.
John chuckled softly. It was as much of an admission as he was going to get. “According to my new friend Doris, Barnabas is buying an elephant on the 4
The contact of John’s lips and her threatening voice in her ear made Sherlock a bit light-headed. She could feel a blush spreading up her neck and colouring her cheeks and it had nothing to do with the pain shooting up her arm. She closed her eyes, pressed her forehead against the wall and focused on that.
John looked up as he was snapped out of his train of thought. He looked at her a moment and sighed heavily. “I’m sorry we’ve bothered you so late, if it wasn’t important-” John cursed inwardly and glimpsed at his partner who at least seemed as uncomfortable as he was. “Mrs. Carson, I’m sorry to have to tell you this but-”
Holmes nodded and started walking around again. Once he felt he had found Edward’s walk once more, he spoke.
Although, that was after they had broken into a drug cartel’s money laundering business together. And ran off after having knocked out the boss. Watson didn’t try to fight the smile that came with the memory. It wasn’t the first time Watson had helped Holmes with the investigation. And Holmes had said he was trying to recruit him…
As he followed Sherlock, John’s eye caught the white arch that had appeared over their fireplace. He noticed it when they came home last night, and Sherlock had offered little explanation as to why the flat had suddenly started changing after all this time, and why it would choose to add a bulky white arch of all things.
The window frame was wheeled in on a dolly and propped onto a few wooden crates to get the right height for the camera. Wilder let Watson look through the camera lens. The effect was even better than he had imagined.
Judging by the strain in John’s abdominal muscles, he had thrown his head back to curse loudly. Sherlock swirled his tongue around the tip, tasting the bitter pre-cum before starting a slow slide. He shifted his position, the new angle allowing John deeper into his mouth.
"My, no, before that artifact, before... It used to be lovely in here.” She summed, her eyes looking around the room. “Anyway, he was getting so out of hand that Mycroft insisted I go to my sister’s. It took the better part of three weeks until I could come back. And when I came up to see him, the flat had turned into the office.”
John pulled his eyes away from the mirror and looked at Lestrade, as if daring him to ask what talent he showcased. Sherlock oscillated between hoping Lestrade would, and that he wouldn’t. This needed to end soon, or he would lose control of his fantasies, and he wasn’t about to walk out of here with an erection.
They were greeted by a woman in her fifties, hair pulled back in a tight bun, smiling warmly at them. Molly was wide-eyed and taking it all in. The small shop was so narrow it would have felt like a cramped closet if it weren’t for the high ceilings. Every inch of the right-hand wall was covered with delicates. Brassieres, panties, garter belts, and corsets in every color, shape and size. The left-hand side was for accessories and the cash register. The dressing rooms were at the far end, hidden behind plush dark purple velour drapes.
“You were studying it. What better way to learn then to experience it first hand?” She said as she tightened her grip again, bringing Sherlock to his knees. As much as John was curious to see where this could go, he shook his head; he couldn’t let this go on. He had already waited too long and was probably going to regret it.
Swiftly, John twisted around and aimed his Tesla at the open door, directly at Sherlock lying on the couch with his eyes closed in a pose that suggested he was in his mind palace.
“Mycroft has a peculiar recruiting technique.” Sherlock mocked. Watson turned to look at him, and felt his brain bombard him with questions about how he disappeared in Qatar, but this job offer was the more pressing matter.
Before he could figure it out, Sherlock found himself standing in the center of the new room and slowly turning to look at everything. The previous room was tame compared to this one. It was almost like a historical exhibit of torture tools. The walls were covered with ornamented knives, daggers, metal restraints, even what looked like a medieval torture chamber that could be suspended to the ceiling. There was a pommel horse in one corner and a polished wooden chair with a hole in the seat in the other.
“And now it’s scowling.” He completed, crouching once again to look at the scowling face. “Interesting. Come on, bag it.” He said as he stood up and held out the bag. John took the clock and dropped it in; only nothing happened. They both turned to look into the bag, then at each other. "We need to go back to the Warehouse.” Sherlock said hurriedly.
“For God’s sake.” John said suddenly filled with adrenaline and barely stopped himself from striking Mycroft. His instinct was the only thing stopping his trained reflexes. “If you’re going to appear out of nowhere, at least do it where you’re not in striking distance of me because I swear one day you’ll regret it.”
“That’s a noir name if I ever heard one.” John commented, grasping at the chance to change the mood.
Ms Hooper called the end of the rehearsal and as everyone prepared to leave, Watson nodded to Holmes.
Watson was grateful to finally get the rehearsal studio back. He liked working in Stamford’s office, but it didn’t have a piano, which was rather useful when working on a song. He spent the first half hour just playing, doing scales and basic exercises to warm up his fingers. He then moved on to a few of his favourite pieces before settling down and working on the finale.
? This entire movie is wrong!” He walked onto the sound stage, pulling the scarf around his neck. “I’m trying my best to create something beautiful, something that will blow everyone away, and it’s all
“Yes, it is. Angry or frightened people give more information because they are so concentrated on their emotions they don’t think about what they’re saying.”
“What?” The new agent said without thinking. He turned towards his partner just in time to see a surprised look flash across his face.
“Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut!” The director, Jimmy Morgan, threw his script onto the concrete floor. “I told you this scene isn’t about the words, it’s about your colours coming together.”
. With a last look, he turned and ran. Once he got there, every light on the wall was blinking angrily.
Watson could feel his blood boil. That man had brought the studio to the edge of bankruptcy, almost lost everyone in the room their jobs. It had taken every ounce of his self-control not to shoot Moriarty during his speech in the tunnels.
Only Holmes wasn’t paying much attention to the Press Conference anymore. Because if he didn’t know better, Morgan had just given himself away.
Really Sherlock? A deduction two seconds after getting released? If you want to spend the night in jail so badly, just say so.
Morgan shook himself like a dog. “Ugh, forget it, doesn’t matter. At least we’ve got something to work with now.” He walked back to the table and opened his script. “Might as well do a read-through. If we have time left, we’ll work on stage directions.”
John quirked an eyebrow. “Right.” Well, can’t really blame her for being mad at him, he added to himself. “Call us if anything happens.”
As Watson worked, Holmes found himself relaxing. Being taken care of was oddly… soothing. It felt like there was more to it, only Holmes couldn’t quite say what.
“Over here, dear.” Mrs. Hudson called back, her voice close to him. He walked down two more rows when he finally saw her a few feet down, purple gloves contrasting with her yellow apron.
“Of course.” John answered sarcastically. He was beginning to suspect there was an artifact for everything. “Isn’t there a way to undo it?”
Watson was starved when he got into his flat and started working on some pasta. He poured himself a drink and let the events of the night replay in his mind. He still couldn’t believe what had happened. It felt surreal, as if taken out of a movie. He had seen horrible things in his army days, enough to understand that sometimes reality surpassed fiction in indescribable ways, but tonight had felt different. As if his time in Holmes’s world had opened his eyes to what really lay under the dark corners of the city. It unveiled just how curious Watson was to see what else there was to find when you knew where to look.
“I-” The dark haired man was at a loss for words when the door leading out into the book shop rattled. They both turned towards it and back to each other. “This way.” Sherlock whispered as he silently moved towards the far side of the back store as whoever was at the door started knocking. John picked up his shirt and coat and slid them on as he followed.
“Working for the Warehouse.” Sherlock explained. John looked down at his food even though he could still feel him staring.
“Oh.” John said. He didn’t need much imagination to picture scenes of exploding limbs. “But isn’t there a way to control it?”
With radiant smiles, the leading couple bowed once more. Holmes eyes found Watson’s in the process, making him look away and find it odd that the studio was so warm.
“The pleasure is all mine, agent Watson.” Her voice was playful as she shook John’s hand briefly. “I’m glad you’ve finally found someone, Sherlock.” She commented, but she kept her eyes on John’s, amusement shinning bright in her eyes.
That was when John remembered he had an appointment with a man he hoped never to have anything to do with after this.
“Why? B-because…” She paused, and after a moment smiled at Holmes. “Could you, um, give me a minute? Just, um, do some voice exercises or something, I’ll be right back.” Ms Hawkins stepped out.
“No. It’s been a long day; we know it’ll still be there in the morning. And I’m not breaking into any place without it being absolutely necessary; you aren’t using the same trick on me twice.”
“When it will stop annoying you.” Sherlock retorted. He knew he was being childish and couldn’t care less, especially where his brother was concerned.
There’s a long silence. Amy is wide-eyed, face half hidden by her coat collar. Jake is frowning, hands on his hips, shifting from one foot to the other. Lestrade and Boyle are pacing in the background.
With a roll of his eyes, Sherlock turns around and raises his hands. John does the same, minus the eye roll. Jake moves closer.
The stairs led to what looked like the break area, but at the far end was a storage space, filled with filling boxes, but there was also a stack of twelve brown boxes next to the racks.
Something inside Sherlock stirred at the knowledge that his partner was more concerned by his health than the work.
But this. This was something else. As much as he was sure it was all a joke or a dream, he couldn’t help feeling that there was a reason he was here.
And here was Holmes, who had somehow found a way to embody the character in three days. His quirks, his essence, how he moved; it was all there. The story that Watson had been struggling to write for so long was suddenly clear in his head.
The red light over the studio door was on when Watson arrived at the bottom of the stairs. In case someone appeared, he limped his way down the corridor, and was grateful so see the light turn off when he arrived.
Watson took a deep breath. “Ms Hooper is right, as always. Let’s cut this short. You’re saying this time the plan is
Ms Hawkins raised an eyebrow. She turned Ms Hooper, who looked embarrassed but gave her a small nod. Ms Hawkins looked around the table; no one seemed to have any objections, besides Watson, but he wasn’t voicing them.
“Coordinates accepted.” They heard as the numbers appeared onscreen. “Confirm mission?” The computerised voice asked. Confirm/Cancel could be read on the screen.
John couldn’t help it; he had a point. What could they do besides look at it? And even if they somehow figured out a way to get a perimeter around it, they would most likely get thrown out of the market for it. But they still couldn’t risk leaving it there without supervision.
“Anything, anything you want, tell me.” Stamford took out his cheque book. “I will pay you double the fee you normally charge for a case as private detect-”
Jones chewed the inside of his cheek a moment before he carried on. “You then discovered that Anderson’s death was part of an elaborate plan for the Hudson cartel to expand into drug manufacturing. They needed Stamford Productions because it has a hidden trap door that leads to prohibition tunnels, where they set up the LSD lab we’re currently in the process of dismantling.”
“About a week ago, right after he came back from his last trip. He barely dropped his luggage; he was already picking them up to leave with her.”
Once the glass was put aside, John sat back, hands on the armrests, and stared down at Sherlock. Within the blink of an eye, Captain Watson was back.
Holmes spotted the sign. “Thanks.” He gave her a nervous smile and quickly made his way through the crowd, doing his best to avert his gaze in case someone wanted to speak with him.
He made it look like the words were coming out the top of his head, danced around like he wasn’t even trying. The song ended with Holmes walking off stage whistling the chorus.
John gently placed his hands on either side of Sherlock’s head, and angled it to look at the wound. All Sherlock could focus on was the look on John’s face. Once it stopped being blurry. It echoed the same concern as the day before, but instead of being fuelled by arousal, it seemed… fond.
Slowly, Molly’s shaking hand made it’s way down John’s arm, past her elbow, catching up to where John was rolling her own nipple between her fingers. John’s breath caught when Molly’s fingers intertwined with hers, leaning into her touch, directing her, pulling her closer. Before she knew it, Molly was behind John, pressed against her back, her other hand sneaking around and cupping her other breast. John arched her back, her head falling backwards and landing onto Molly’s shoulder, breath puffing against her cheek. She looked down, saw John’s full breasts in her hands, her brain still trying to understand what was happening. It stopped working when her eyes met Sherlock’s, the only part of her face that wasn’t buried between John’s legs.
Bumping against an older woman as he grabbed a new tin of steel cut oats, he shivered, a chill running up his spine. “Sorry,” he murmured. She recoiled as he spoke, looking up at him with a glare, and moved on.  He frowned back, watching her, then froze.
I packed my pipe and set off, traversing the road that I had arrived by until I found the place where the edge of town met the first dark trees of the forest. As I entered the wood, I was surprised at the sudden change in sound. The trees seemed to drop around me, blanketing the air and keeping the typical noises of the forest dulled as if underwater. No bird calls, or wind, or rustling in the underbrush that I’ve grown accustomed to hearing in the countryside surrounding London. My footsteps were quiet, even, dampened by the plush earth beneath my feet. I walked for nearly a mile when I came across a wooden sign tacked to a birch tree. Carved into the wood were the words for
” the creature asked, drawing out the words. The only part of him that moved was his mouth, the rest of him frozen.
Grieving, angry, devastated and betrayed John sat alone in his awful and boring flat across London, drinking himself to oblivion and writing down every word of hurt and pain that came into his head as a way to
about me. I take in the minute details of his appearance, and the truth is revealed: new, fine tension lines between his eyebrows and around his mouth. Fingers stained from increased cigarette smoking, twitching from too much nicotine and caffeine. Suit wrinkled at the hips and knees, indicating agitated pacing. Eyes bloodshot from little to no sleep. And the tremble in his chin...it’s the most damning piece of evidence on him.
My lips curl at the statement, the beginnings of a small laugh of relief shaking my core. “Oh?” I ask, a hint of humor in my tone. I let my hand fall to my side, leaving the piles in their places on the table.
“Arsehole!” Sherlock slammed his phone down on the desk, taking out more frustration than his brother was worth. It was ridiculous, really, that his parents expected him to exist in such an infuriating environment. There is no reason they could not afford a single room. Perhaps Mycroft convinced them he ought to share for
Bewitched, John stared up into the man’s chalky eyes and swallowed. “Ah dunnae kinn anythin’,” he argued, heart pounding in his ears.
Suddenly all I can hear is my heartbeat pounding in my ears. My vision goes blurry, then black, and I reach out to steady myself on the wall, hand slipping clumsily with sweat. My knees buckle, forcing me to slump. I’m vaguely aware of concerned voices, but I wave them off.
between us. I--I know what I want but I can’t seem to make my desires clear to you. I’m completely ineffectual.” Shame colors his cheekbones a dusky rose at the admission.
it,” he reasserts, his voice losing its usual warmth. He yanks his robe out of my hands and stands quickly, a single eyebrow raised as he stares down his nose at me.
of what I feel in this moment. To know the pain I have, know the relief and anxiety and excitement and anger and hurt, the millions of emotions that are swirling and colliding in my brain. They encompass my entire being and throb with my pulse, filling my cells until I feel like I might burst.
At this, John’s rage overtook him and he whipped his head to the side, glaring. The wild eyed, curly-haired man was crouched next to him, his head again cocked as he stared, unblinking. His eyes shone blue-white like thick, frozen ice on a waterfall--opaque and milky.
Watson moved to stand between me and his cabin, blocking the line of sight, and snorted to himself. “Anderson was an idiot,” he finally said. “He got what he deserved,” he added under his breath.
helpful having the cane for the stairs. John certainly could have assisted me again, but I suppose not relying
He paused long enough to glare at me, then growled, “Leave Germany, Sherlock, and never return. Leave before you get hurt.”
It’s gutting me, hearing him talk like this, choking on his anguish. In my effort to get him contained, I hadn’t noticed Mycroft leave the room. The quiet
“Hello, John.” The kettle whistles in the other room and I move to get it, quickly pouring our respective cups and carrying them over to the living room. He’s already seated in his armchair, fingers toying absentmindedly with a loose thread at the edge of the arm. There’s a quiet
“Yes, or no?” John asks me, an irritated expression on his face. His hand is still on my arm, eyes wide. I can feel the familiar threads of annoyance rolling off of him, twisting in the air between us. It tries to settle between my shoulder blades and deep in my belly, but it’s easy enough to fight off in lieu of my intense hyperfocus on the case. That’s all that matters at the moment. Emotions are fleeting with enough persistence. “
It is amazing how a shower seems to wash even the thickest weariness from my bones, leaving me feeling renewed and relaxed. As promised, there's a new mug of fresh coffee on the side table by my chair, the steam drifting lazily in the sunbeams illuminating the room. Sherlock is a statue, fingers steepled in front of his lips, in his chair. There's some quiet violin music playing in the flat, something I don't recognize. Plopping down, I pick up my mug and meet Sherlock's gaze.
how you taste,” Sherlock crooned, licking his way down the man’s nude stomach. He paused to press kisses to John’s hipbone, his long-fingered hands sweeping up and down his thighs while kneading his muscles.
“Hm,” I respond, waving my free hand at a cab driving by. Seeing it, John puts space between us, yanking the bottom of his jacket down and straightening his shoulders. We climb into the cab, give the driver the address, and settle into the leather of the backseat together.
. It was a nearly silent whimpering just under the dead air of the line, barely noticeable. John’s scalp tingled, face burning and body like ice.
“It hurts, Sherlock!” John would finally shout, the anger at his companion’s disinterest clearing the haze from his mind. He felt as if he was breaking the surface of the water, gasping for air as the rage and pain settled in his joints.
Grumbling, he brought his knees to his chest and reached out of the cocoon of warmth, shocked at how cold the air felt. He glanced around his bedroom, hoping to see some clothing nearby. His typical trousers and jumper were folded neatly on the chair near the door, with his boots tucked underneath. Steeling himself, he whipped the blankets off and dashed over, yanking everything on as fast as he could without stumbling.
,” Sherlock reminded, his head cocked to the side. He stalked closer to John, white eyes unblinking as he watched the man.

Sorry it's taking me a bit of extra time in between updates--each chapter is encompassing so much ground and they are increasing a bit in size to accommodate all of the story stuff that needs to happen. Thanks for your patience and continued support!! <3
. We live in a technologically advanced society. New Scotland Yard should really consider catching up.” Looking him over, I know it’s duty alone that is pushing his harassment-- he’s just as tired and burnt out as everyone else here. He needs to go home. He’ll appreciate my petulance in the morning.
Meeting John’s terrified gaze, I reach out to touch the back of his hand. He whips it away, the color draining from his face. A quick shake of the head and he’s off the couch, fleeing to the bathroom. The door slams behind him and I hear the muffled sound of retching seconds later from down the hall.
He kept a small garden off to the side of his house in the solitary patch of sunlit land in this part of the forest, and it was chock full of overgrown tomato plants teeming with ripe, sun-warmed orbs. The smell of the leaves was comforting and distinctive, wafting towards me as I circled the structure looking for a means inside. An open window at the back of the house was easy access into his bedroom, and I traversed it deftly.
His blood covers us both, ruining my Belstaff, and his skin turns ashen as he dies in my arms over and over while Moriarty whispers in my ear, “You’re not real to him, Sherlock, you never were. Not real,
“What?” John finally asks quietly, his voice tight as he lifts his head off the pillow to stare at me. His eyes darken substantially, face growing weary as he shuts down, closing himself off. The vulnerability he offered me before is withdrawn with the hard set of his jaw and the clench of his teeth.
--with a head full of dark curls and eyes as white as snow, winding his body around John’s like a boa constrictor, suffocating him while whispering deadly secrets and incantations in his ear. The breath on his skin felt real,
The tears threatening to spill over onto his cheekbones glisten in the harsh hospital room lighting, creating the illusion of sparkles around his eyes. It would be beautiful--
The door to the room swings open suddenly, interrupting my musings and pulling my attention away from John. Mycroft sweeps in, twirling his umbrella with a veiled expression of surprise on his face as he surveys the scene in front of him. The warmth in my chest dissipates as I stare at my brother, blinking slowly while he determines how best to proceed. He was never good at hiding his thought processes from me.
The coffee here is surprisingly decent, considering. As I swirl the dregs, there’s an uptick in John’s heart monitor.
I’m the sociopath. I’m the one who hurts people, not John. He may be an adrenaline addict, but he doesn’t need…
Morgan rolled his eyes. “Fine, just do it more like you’re being parachuted in the Himalayas during a rainy fall afternoon. Now let’s make some magic!”
John’s brow wrinkled, clenching his jaw as he considered Sherlock’s words. Whatever sexual tension there might have been had dissipated. But it did nothing to relieve the tension in the room.
“Step, step, sidestep, sidestep, kick ball change, kick ball change, double spin, and pose. Got that? Together then: Five, six, seven, eight.”
“I’m glad to hear it.” Stamford nodded, clasping his hands in front of him, but looked uncomfortable. “To be quite honest, I’m rather starting to wonder if hiring him was a good idea. I know it’s your first time working with him as well, and I was expecting… well, not this. I swear, every time he pulls something like this I wonder if he’s trying to tank this movie on purpose.”
“Thanks again for your help with the audition.” Holmes, no longer talking with his American accent, bent down to kiss her on the cheek.
“Lestrade, what is this charade?” Stamford’s voice echoed loudly in the empty corridor. “Breaking into an active crime scene. If the police get word of this-”
Well, he did, he had a very specific idea. One that was becoming more and more detailed with every minute spent with John. This was as good a time as any to say something. If he didn’t do it now, he probably never would.
He layed back down heavily, cursing his partner for waking him up this way. The clock displayed 7h30 in bright red. At least it wasn’t the middle of the night like last week. He rubbed his face as he heard the cause of his sudden wakening walk up the stairs.
Walking to the couch with his tea cup, he pushed the remains from last night onto the floor and sat heavily.
“Hum?”John wasn’t sure what she was referring to, because he was fairly certain she wasn’t asking about Irene Adler whispering naughty things in his ear.
John liked watching him work; he mostly tried to guess what the brilliant man was working on, which was surprisingly difficult sometimes. John was use to standard science, which doesn’t apply here. The tools Sherlock used were also an added difficulty to the guessing game because most of them were artifacts. And who could blame him for using them to study other artifacts, not to mention that John was eager to use Rosalind Franklin’s original DNA Sequencer.
God, I can’t wait for those two to get their heads out of their asses and kiss already. But it’s no use.
The receptionist doesn’t move. Rosa lays a hand flat on the counter and leans closer to the receptionist with a death glare.
John’s anger had started as somewhat of a distraction to Sherlock, quickly learning the different ways to trigger and disarm it. Sometimes pushing things a bit too far... But John was supposed to become boring like everyone else. Like everyone except... Somehow Sherlock had grown to find John’s anger and many other things that define him... endearing. But the anger he was seeing at this moment was new and he couldn’t grasp what it was no matter how hard he looked. The more he looked, the more he wanted to understand what was making John so... whatever he was at the moment, so Sherlock could never do it again and never see that look again.
The director sighed, crossed his legs, and crossed them the other way, before suddenly springing out of his chair and walking towards them. Holmes clasped his hands behind his back and waited for his critique. Only Morgan didn’t talk, he just… stared at a fixed point between his shoulder and Ms Adler’s head.
John didn’t care about his partner’s reaction. He couldn’t believe it, he was not only holding the title page, he was actually in the novel, he was going to get a chance to live the story that the author had never...
John’s expression turned from confusion to surprise, rapidly followed by concern when he saw at the empty table.
an expert shooter and trained in close combat. He held the front in search and rescue. Gote was responsible of electronics, that woman could hack into anything. Opened safes for fun. Andrews spoke 8 languages fluently, had a Masters in psychology and was a human lie detector. Fighting wasn’t his forte, but he could hold his own.”
With a huff, Stamford turned to Watson, and together they laughed and hugged each other. Stamford then turned to Lestrade to hug him too, making Lestrade laugh and pat his back.
Holmes turned to Stamford. “I thought we were also going to the press conference?” Waving between himself and Ms Adler.
Ms Adler watched him a moment before turning to Lestrade, who nodded at her politely before continuing to watch the room. She sipped her drink and turned back to Holmes. “Ms Monroe could possibly make an appearance tonight.”
This must be why John asked if he was shopping with his partner. He’d been worried about Sherlock’s aftercare. It made his cock twitch at the memory. He had been hoping his erection would wilt, but it seemed his research topic was keeping it interested.
John, a few seconds behind, watched as his partner turned left again at the end of the row, just as a blinding flash of blue light lit the opposing shelves.
Watson felt out of place. This was so fancy, and everyone seem to already know each other. Stamford was right, Watson needed to go out more. Thankfully, Ms Hooper was nice enough to hold his arm as they walked along with the rest of the cast and crew to their booths.
Sherlock and Amy drive into the parking lot. As they approach Rosa’s car, they see Rosa and John laughing together.
“You wished to go back to the Special Forces, didn’t you?” It was true, but John was distracted by the ferret sniffing his hand. “Impossible wishes, wishes that can never be granted, they produce a ferret. Don’t ask me why.” He added when he saw John’s mouth open. “My first week here it took me 3 ferrets to accept the situation.” Sherlock put on purple latex gloves before taking the kettle from John, handing him the ferret and putting the kettle into the purple goo.
I’ll make sure to get checked out when this is over. And so will you. If you need to. Hopefully you won’t. Can we go catch a criminal now?
Watson blushed at Holmes open flirting. They knew this was a safe space for them to act freely as a couple, but Watson still had some getting used to.
Ms Adler was already in her chair next to the camera, Ms Kate at her side, when Holmes stepped out of his dressing room.
“What then? It’s not like we have any openings besides…” Stamford looked stricken before he slowly eyed Holmes. “Say, have you ever-?”
“If it’s that dangerous, why didn’t you just bid big to make sure you got it?” John asked as he moved back into the kitchen to silence the boiling kettle.
He was starting to get Sherlock’s frustration towards the GPS; they were stuck chasing an artifact that had
“Yes. You are.” John said as he worked. “You ignored an officer of the law, then ran off alone after Hank without saying a thing.”
Moriarty chuckled. “Please, if you can’t stomach working for Queen & Country, do you really think I can?”
Anderson’s eyebrow rose and after a beat he looked up into her eyes. “Right, of course. Come on in.” He stepped aside, holding the door open for her.
Ms Adler stepped out of her dressing room, but it seemed more accurate to describe it as an entrance on set; the dress fitted to her body as if it were painted on, the fabric falling loosely around her hips, flowing to the floor. Every sequin catching in the light. The overall effect made such an impression that the room fell silent.
“That’s sweet of you, but don’t worry, it isn’t my first time dealing with that beautiful creature. I know he likes me, he just has his own way of showing it.” She leaned in to whisper into John’s ear, ignoring Sherlock’s scoff. Her cheek against his, her eyes on his partner who was feigning to ignore them, but she could tell his attention was on them. “Has anyone ever told you you’re sexy when you’re angry?” She pulled back enough to kiss his cheek lightly, smiling as she saw the sulking agent flinch at the noise. “Farewell.” She spoke before walking out of the office.
“I want lots of things, but right now, do you know what I really want?” Manning asked the soldier, his eyes spiteful. The man chuckled before whispering into Watson’s ear. “I want you to watch your partner die.” His head moved back and he watched John gasp for air. “Him and everybody else in here.” He added before backing away and loosening his hold on the riding crop. Sherlock’s grip on John’s neck released, his body screaming for oxygen.
Sherlock spent Sunday cleaning. Every time he thought about sitting down, he noticed something else to clean, or put away, or throw away. A lot of throwing away. Sherlock had to go down to the bins twice. By five o’clock, he forced himself to stop scrubbing the cupboards and go shower. At ten to six he walked into the sitting room freshly shaven, wearing a black suit and shirt, with his hair perfectly done.
Sherlock turned, only now noticing John had already put down his bag and hung his coat. He was wearing jeans, and a plaid shirt with a black jumper. Not really what Sherlock had pictured. Not after his visit to the shop, and certainly not after having done research on the subject. Perhaps John had planned to change here. What was that look in his eye? Was he waiting for Sherlock do something? Was there a special greeting? Should he make tea? Or kneel?
Sherlock cursed the tremble in her voice. John blinked slowly, and seemed like she wanted to respond, but only a small breathy sound came out. It managed to twist Sherlock’s insides even more, which made the next words even more difficult to speak.
But the only thing Sherlock was focused on was John’s thigh brushing against his own as he stood next to him. He was proceeding with professionalism, his movements steady, clearly repeated thousands of times, but that didn’t stop Sherlock’s body from being hyper aware of every touch. “How much longer is this going to take? I told you, I’m fine.”
“Then do it!” Sherlock ordered, without thinking. Had he known John was about to take off his latex glove and touch the tattoo, he would have stopped him, but as it was, he had his back turned. All he felt was a cool hand covering his shoulder blade and the pain and fever leave him suddenly. “What did you do!?” Sherlock cried out as he turned to see the image disappear under John’s cuff, clearly growing unsteady on his feet. “You idiot!”
I think with a deep ache of anxiety in my chest. I don’t want to argue with him right now. The idea of slamming my bedroom door in his face and retreating to the solitude of my bed is the only option that makes sense at the moment. I stand up too quickly and the sudden shift in position causes blood to rush from my head, vision clouding with black spots. Before I know it, I’m swaying dangerously forward. My hand slips and I scrabble to stop the inevitable fall, dropping my cloth with a splat. I land on the floor of the tub with a thump, smacking my shoulder against the faucet hard enough to break the skin.
Something behind his eyes softens, barely. His head dips slightly, his cheeks relax, and suddenly the exhaustion he’s been fighting is evident. A deeper sigh from him this time, and he reaches up to run his thumb and index finger along the sides of his nose. “So be it. While you’re here you ought to have your injuries treated. You have at least two broken ribs and there’s a high likelihood of internal trauma and possible bleeding. And...you’re in no state to see Sherlock, nor him you. If this is the way he sees you when he wakes, he’ll be devastated and angry that you neglected to seek medical care. I am sure that you, being a doctor, understand the immediacy of treating such acute--”
The Wood, with it's birch, aspen, and pine trees that swayed in the wind, branches crackling as they rubbed against each other. Inky black crows, their iridescent feathers shining in the anemic winter sun, calling to each other as they took off. Air so silent and thick it felt like cotton in his ears and water in his lungs. He drifted further and further into the forest in his mind, following the whispers of an all too familiar voice as it beckoned him back.
. Nothing compares to you, and I can’t marry Mary knowing that I’m choosing a life of grey when there’s a world of color on the other side of the door.”
His face is set with determination, serious and calm. No evidence of his earlier uncertainty--in this moment, he is absolutely sure of what he wants. My heart pounds, breath caught in my lungs. My chest feels painfully tight, squeezed in a vice of mingling fear and anticipation. Our eyes meet and the barest hint of a smile tugs at the corners of his lips.
“Well, I was drugged. And drunk, and...not myself. I don’t remember much,” I reply, disappointed. “He was large, blonde, and brutal. He seemed to delight in the pain he was causing me. A brute, probably has been a grunt for someone much smarter for most of his life. Different from Moran. Moran was…” My brain takes me back to that night, in the damp warehouse, my pants filthy and torn, soaked through at the knees. The room dark, lit by a few odd bulbs hanging on wires, swinging wildly as my captors moved nearby. Charles, laughing; no,
Catching on, I frown and cross my arms. “Hm. Right. You’re so sure you can do this by yourself, are you?”
those mortals who knew and refused to believe. Those mortals who whispered behind his back and told stories around the fire of the man who returned from the Wood.
entirely. John seemed to think they needed to eat together as their next step. Sherlock didn’t understand how it was such a milestone, as normal people eat every day, but he could feel it in John whenever he mentioned it.
Leaving my hand firmly planted on the pile, I blink and nod once at him. He glances down, nostrils flaring as he breathes slow and deep, his jaw working and pulse pounding in his forehead. He’s clearly still nervous about this, his amygdala flooding his central nervous system with adrenaline. I wish I could tell him how important these letters are to me, how essential to our relationship it is, without sounding like an imbecilic romantic. There are no words that can accurately express the swirl of emotions and thoughts in my head.
knew about it except us. Sherlock Holmes and John Watson, the great London detectives who didn’t even notice how much they wanted to get off with one another.” As he finishes, he dissolves into giggles, his shoulders shaking as he looks down at his feet. We laugh together for a few moments before our gaze meets again, both of us grinning like fools.
I am not a dog off his lead, and you are not my handler. I will return when I do. Do not, under any circumstances, bring Mrs. Hudson into this petty feud.
“And you don’t know how to dance with any semblance of skill outside of whatever one might find at an overcrowded university pub,” I finish with a false grin. When he doesn’t immediately argue, I drain the last of my tea and lean back in my chair.
Turning my attention back to John, I ask, “Did you go through any other areas before entering the main part of the warehouse?”
“Hm,” his captor mused, the sound escaping his throat on the tails of a deep exhalation. “Nothing but
Compelled by my own hunger and curiosity, I grabbed at his arms again and pulled him to me. “Call me Sherlock, please. I am no stranger,” was my plea. “I shall keep your secret, if you shall keep mine.” I brought his enormous hand down between us, instantly relieved at his touch.
,” John bites out through gritted teeth. Sherlock’s only reaction is a dismissive wave of his hand as he stares at me, awaiting my response. His toes are tapping restlessly on the floor, the only clear indication of his ratcheting impatience.
As I watch him rant, I slowly raise our joined hands towards me, pausing to disentangle our fingers and take hold of his wrist. He stops his monologue abruptly, staring at me while I bring my lips down to the pulse point beneath his palm and kiss it gently, the softest brush of contact. Goosebumps bloom along his forearm as he gasps almost silently in shock. Adjusting my grasp I spread his fingers and place another barely-there kiss to the middle of his palm, inhaling his scent as though it were the finest cologne known to man. His eyelids flutter shut as his breathing deepens, steeling himself against the sensations.
For several minutes, we’re just two blokes smoking, avoiding each others’ eyes and keeping painfully quiet. The crackle of the tobacco as it burns on each inhale fills the space between us, electric. My thoughts are circular, sticking to my concern for John.
A flash of our earlier conversation pops into my head--47 minutes until Mycroft arrives. Which was easily 20 minutes ago.
John contemplates the ceiling for a moment before dropping his head down onto his shoulder, breathing deeply through his nose while we lock eyes. He looks exhausted, and just
“John, tell me what you remember about the room you were kept in,” I demand loudly, silencing everyone else in the room. Seems they were discussing a plan of sorts for the (imagined) apprehension they intend to carry out?
Mike nodded, tipping an imaginary hat at John just as their professor started plopping down exam booklets on the first seat of each row with a
I spent the walk back to the village deep in thought, replaying our interaction and dissecting it. Watson is clearly from this area of Germany given his skin tone, bone structure, and general stature, though he is not from this village. He has no ties to the people here, and seems to be a bit of a mystery to them. It is likely that he had a traumatic or shameful event occur in the last place he lived, probably his hometown, and so he needed to cut all semblance of relation from his life in order to continue on. No one need know of him or his secret past, whatever that may be. It is intriguing, to say the least, and puts him at the top of my list of potential suspects for the disappearance of the sportsman.
--and I wish we could escape the reality that’s threatening to drown us. The moment we found some peace together, some level of comfort...it was ruined. We need more time. There is too much left unsaid,
Bringing his face down mere centimetres away from the Scotsman, the creature licked his lips and smiled, revealing sharp canines amidst his gleaming white teeth. John stared up at him, entranced, and felt his body curve up towards the invitation, bending like a sapling in the wind. The man brought his porcelain nose down to brush against John’s cheek, and had John not been so trapped he would have shrank away. Instead, he released his shaky breath through an open mouth and let his eyes slide shut.
When they could take it no more, he let his eyes shut, and when he opened them, the man was gone. He blinked again, uncertain of himself. It wasn’t the first time he had seen such an apparition since his return, though it was the first time it had happened out in the open. He was used to this ghostly visitor in the dead of night when he awoke, sweat slick skin sliding around in his sheets while his heart pounded out of his chest. But not here, not now. Not in this place, full to the brim and bursting with
, as they dart around the room to observe as much as possible before they land on mine. A chill runs down my spin, shaking me to my core while we stare at one another in a vain attempt to communicate telepathically. He stumbles forward, nearly falling to his knees but saved at the last moment by a yank on his wrists by Charles. Sherlock’s face contorts into a grimace as his shoulders are wrenched unnaturally, his knees buckling beneath him in pain.
“Tomorrow night?” John called after him, hating how hopeful he sounded. Sherlock didn’t reply, though he waved a
“There is no threat of danger here. If I fall--unlikely--I can call you. The sooner I get what I need, the sooner we leave,” I insist, peering down at him. “There are over a dozen people here. Even if Moran
I am an impossible man with impossible standards and impossible habits and impossible vices and I am absolutely unloveable, unwantable for these reasons. I don’t blame him, really.

Feeling him

Pinching the bridge of my nose with one hand, I sit fully upright, clutching the phone tightly in my other one. John stares at the ceiling, fists pressed down onto the tops of his thighs and breath whistling noisily in and out of his nose. I watch his chest rise and fall sharply, discomfort pooling low in my gut as I realize he’s fighting off a sympathetic nervous system reaction to my outburst. Channeling my anger outward, I command harshly, “
.” As the soap runs down my stomach and trails along my inner thigh, it works itself under the bandage. The sharp sting causes me to gasp, another muttered curse escaping my lips.
“I remember...”  Holmes appeared to run out of energy very suddenly.  He was near the mantle again and he leaned against it.  I wished he would lean on me instead and so got a little closer to give him the option.  He turned his face away and fixed his gaze to the wall.  “You spoke of our agreement.  You told me to forget it.”
His eyes fluttered briefly.  “Besides the wound itself, I admit that after it was inflicted I experienced a great burst of energy when I thought I might shortly die.  The men in question have all been arrested now, at any rate.  Are you sure you would not prefer to hear how I dealt with them?  No?  Well.  Another time.  In the aftermath I felt rather as if my body had caught fire.  And my arm...”  His voice cracked very slightly.  “I saw your worry, you know.  For a while I too wondered if I might lose the use of it.  And...”
When he was gone, I sat back in my chair.  “That was a stroke of luck,” I said.  “Though of course, once these men
I lifted my head and looked at him openly.  “So I am.”  I rose, stiff and sore from my night in the chair, and crossed to him with hands out.  “Let me see what you’ve done to my stitches.”
I finished my stitches.  I cleaned the wound again and covered it.  All this I performed with perfectly steady hands, as if the battle calm had come over me at last.  I am not sure if the opponent in my mind was Sherlock Holmes or I myself.  I think it must have been me, for it was truly a battle to keep back ideas which it would really kill me to entertain and be wrong.
At first I did not quite understand.  Then I remembered.  Crocker had told us he said those words to the lady when the pain of loving her so without speaking of it became too much for him.
In answer I turned his hand in my grip and, as his sleeve slipped down, kissed the inside of his wrist, just above the bandage I had wrapped around the injury which gave us this chance.  I inhaled the precious smell of his skin- all tobacco smoke, hours-old chemistry experiments, and pine resin- and he made a soft, intensely sweet, sound.  It was not just that reserve I had described, by turns, in admiring and frustrated detail over the years, that was disintegrating.  It was his belief, I prayed now never too strong, that I did not love him every bit as much as he did me.
.  When I caught his lips again he kissed me back with all he could without otherwise moving a muscle.  And so I kissed him until he calmed and softened completely against me.  And then I kissed him until the shape of his lips and the taste of his mouth and the heat of his tongue were things as familiar to me as every other part of him I made a study of over the years.  And then, as he grew drowsier and more pliant still, I kissed him until he slept.
“So, what was causing so many takes?” Holmes looked from one to the other and noted the obvious discomfort his question was causing.
John was concerned with his partner’s excitement. Anything sent via an artifact did not have a pleasant
Dimmock turned to Wiggins, who turned to Watson. “Well, first off we wouldn’t have made it to the end.”
It took a moment for Sherlock to register John’s words. He was about to nod when his head throbbed. “Fine. Maybe a concussion.”
started. They danced around one another, coming close and moving away just before they touched. After the second chorus, they stopped singing and held hands, which turned into couples dancing, until they broke apart, interrupted by closing time. They repeated the chorus as they walked out. On the last line, their hands joined once more.
He had walked from his small flat to the studio, knowing he wouldn’t get a cab at four in the morning. Watson considered trying to write to clear his mind or heading to the rehearsal studio to take it out on the piano but ended up moping on the couch with a bottle of Stamford’s scotch.
John raised an eyebrow and crossed his arms. “Living off an army pension and a store clerk’s wages?”
Sherlock was stunned by the goofiness of the situation, the ease with which they had slipped into a friendly banter. He wasn’t sure what had changed between them, but he was glad it had. He took in the sight of John attempting to catch his breath, his neck and cheeks flushed, one hand on his chest, the other holding the side of the desk and placed it safely in John’s section of his mind palace.
“He’s gone. I don’t understand, he was right next to me, a moment ago, I looked back to see if you were coming as I was talking into the coms, then when I looked back he was gone and he took the artefact. How the hell did he take it without me seeing him? When did he even have the time? I don’t, it doesn’t make any sense!” Watson was looking around for something he had missed.
Watson stood there, staring at the closed door, fighting the nausea, fighting the urge to break something. He turned, hand on his forehead, looking around, unsure what he was looking for.
Watson shook his head and tried not to smile. “Certainly is.” He climbed out of the car. “Thanks for the ride. See you tomorrow.”
“Oh, her. Terrible liar, how could any decent detective not see through her game? Really John, why do you even bother?”
That got Sherlock to grimace before explaining further. “It was in the south of Moscow when we started tracing it. Then it moved to London. Those are the only tangible facts we have. There are two possible explanations; someone just so happened to touch it soon after we had traced it and it just so happened to move to London.”He tried to keep his voice low while they made their way back around to the booth so John could try spotting it again.
He raised his right leg to wrap it around John’s waist, distracting him enough to lay his foot on the mattress and use it as leverage to flip them over. John fell onto his back with a small
With a sharp swallow, I nod and guide him forward, taking the next step with him. He follows suit, allowing his weight to rest against me. After a few more excruciatingly slow steps, we pause so he can catch his breath.
His stomach growled again, so he grabbed a bowl from the dish drainer, set it on the table, and dumped the remaining oats into it. The steam from the kettle rose in front of his face as he poured out the boiling water, covering the oats. A few floated to the top, swirling around the bowl as the water began seeping into them. His chair scraped across the wooden floor as he scooted himself closer to the table, inhaling the familiar scent of the cooking cereal.
“For God’s sake, John!” I shout, startling him. He glares at me, head tilted and eyes narrowed. “Out with it!” The demand fills the space, then dies away just as suddenly, and we are caught staring at one another. I dare not blink, lest the intensity of the moment be lost.
John blinked and looked around him, disoriented and confused. The sunlight had gone out, the trees had disappeared, and--
He stepped up onto the bus and followed Sherlock to a seat near the back, knowing the ride was going to take some time. As he looked up at his boyfriend beaming next to him, John knew he had made the right choice, even if it did make him late for his next exam.
, as he doubled the pressure on Greg’s stomach, eyes darting as he searched around him for something to jam into the wound.
I snatched out my notebook and searched my desk for a pen, throwing the materials down and plopping into my too hard chair.
It took him much less time to cross the distance than I expect it would take most men, his confidence and knowledge of the area a clear advantage. I watched him until he was merely a darkened shadow amongst the trees, barely discernible, then turned away to head back to the path.
She never fails to impress and simultaneously shock me, and my cheeks hurt from the absurd grin I’m flashing her. “Just, be careful, okay?” I ask, snatching a final piece of bread. “And thank you.” I stand, leaning over to plant a kiss on her cheek. “Best loaf you’ve made.”
“I--you--,” John started, irritation mounting. Sherlock’s eyes widened, the edge of hurt creeping into his expression.
Naturally, I was startled by the sudden presence of the short, blonde man I had seen in the marketplace. He had the same piercing stare that I had witnessed previously, though upon closer inspection I determined that his intensity was merely due to the brightness in his eyes and the steel set of his jaw. There was a gruff demeanor about him, something just shy of wild that I attribute to his living arrangements and near constant isolation. It seems he isn’t quite comfortable conversing with other humans, preferring solitude and the beasts of the forest as his companions. As he glared at me, his left hand caressed a worn leather strap hanging from his belt, something that was clearly decades old and held great value for the man. I bit back my tongue, for it burned to ask him about it, and instead leaned towards cordiality.
,” he heard from the corner of the cave. Sherlock’s rich baritone filled the room, clawing its way into his chest and shaking his core.
He drew the Punnett Square, thinking about the genetics that were at play to produce his brilliant, angular boyfriend. He wondered what Sherlock’s parents were like. He knew that he had an older brother, who Sherlock was careful to describe as
“Only when it matters, brother mine,” I reply coolly before he slams the door and does his best to stride away despite his obvious limp, coat flapping dramatically in the wind behind him. As they reach the doorway, John stretches to hand his cane to Sherlock, who keeps his own hands thrust into his coat pockets and glares back. John insists, and finally Sherlock relents and takes it before making his way awkwardly up the steps to the flat while his companion grabs the post from the next to the door and heads up behind him, no doubt positioned to catch my brother should he fall.
. When I last wrote, I detailed my travel by train, my arrival to the village, and the beginnings of my investigation into the disappearance of the local sportsman. Since then, I have some curious updates to share with you.
Yet, I saw the way he licked his lips as his eyes roved over my face, settling on my mouth. His pupils nearly eclipsed the deep blue of his irises. His jugular was pulsing, staccato, under the thin skin of his throat. I couldn’t have imagined that. It
,” he breathes onto my trapezius, resting his forehead on my neck. “You have no idea what you do to me…” John molds himself to me, rubbing his rigid erection against my arse and groaning at the contact. His hands find their way to my hips again to hold me steady while he grinds into me, breath coming in needy gasps. My own hand trails down my abdomen until I reach the edge of my trousers and pinch open the button, then slide down the zipper. Shimmying my hips, I begin pushing my bottoms over my arse and down my thighs, moaning as the cool air kisses my exposed skin, increasing my sensitivity.
“Found it!” Sherlock said triumphantly, his hands still typing on the keyboard. “Here: Beethoven’s clock. It was a present from a piano teacher when he was young. A clock of most exquisite decor it says here. Yes, that’s what I thought.” Sherlock said as a picture of the clock showed up on one of the computer screens in the office. “The bust is missing.” He added as he pointed to the sculpture of Aphrodite sitting atop the clock. “That’s why we couldn’t neutralise it. We need both pieces for the effects to stop.”
John rolled his eyes even though Sherlock was right and tried another approach. “We’re...” He hesitated as his mind searched for the appropriate term. “Friends, right?” And yet that didn’t quite cover it. The work was the foundation of their relationship; if it hadn’t been for the Warehouse, they never would have met, let alone become partners and flatmates. There’s only so many times you can save someone’s life and still try to convince yourself you don’t care about them. And there are only so many times you can wank and try not to think of someone when you come and still consider that someone
John struggles and tries to shake away the hand that is taking off his headset. Suddenly John is released. He turns around, ready to fight, and sees Sherlock smashing the headset.
“Of course it was a good plan. Until you came along.” Sherlock said matter-of-factly. John looked at him to see if he was serious. Probably not the joking type.
When she came out, Sherlock cornered her under the stove lamp to get a look at the result. She held John in place with her body while her fingers combed her hair and singled out individual strands to look at under the artificial light.
John hadn’t noticed Sherlock move until he felt his hand covering his own over his chest. The sensation interrupted John’s words as he looked from their joint hands to Sherlock and stared at him as he felt a soft squeeze. With a shaking breath, John twisted his hand and squeezed back, acknowledging the mirroring of the scene on the bridge. Sherlock eyes smiled softly before closing, his hand going limp in John’s.
“That’s not-” Holmes started to protest before cutting himself off. “The important thing is, I gained her trust.”
Watson could feel himself tense at the thought. Writer’s block was something he was used to dealing with, but not when his failure to provide a complete script meant he’ll need to find a new job. And he doubted anyone would accommodate his writing methods as much as Stamford had. Just the prospect of writing exclusively at his apartment again was horrid, reminding Watson of his first months after being discharged.
Not only did they have a nice evening for the first time since their first case, but they had laughed. Not the whole time, but still. They had actually laughed together. Not because they were high on adrenaline but because they were enjoying each other’s company. John still wasn’t sure what exactly had triggered it, but they seemed to have finally arrived at some sort of middle ground.
There was a brief pause when Small saw them, eyes wide, before he turned to walk away. Without a word, Holmes and Watson followed him.
“Can we just go look at the locker?” He said pushing aside his half empty coffee. Sherlock looked past him, a small smile on his lips. “Look, we could be here on stakeout all week, but we’re going to have to check if there’s anything dangerous in there eventually and I think that with what I’ve seen so far, sooner is probably better.” The soldier hid his discomfort when Sherlock started staring with narrowed eyes. It’s as if he were looking for something he didn’t seem to be able to find. His eyes flicked back towards their destination.
Sherlock bit back a sharp intake of breath. Intrigued, she hunched over John’s thigh, her bony hip digging into the armrest as she gently brushed her fingers through the coarse hair. She hummed, fascinated by how vivid the color was on the dark hair and quickly reached for her flashlight for a closer examination. It was then she noticed the colour was only on the upper region, confirming John had been careful not to affect her vagina’s natural bacteria.
“That’s it.” Sherlock whispered to himself, his eyes wide, scanning something only he could see. “That must be it, there’s no other way.”
John was surprised to see the man walk out instead of disappearing. Sherlock simply mimicked his brother silently.  Watson's mind went through the details he had learned, seeing how this could be a trap. He didn’t notice the woman stand and walk around the office, slowly making her way towards him on the by the experiment table.
“If you could manage to pull your head out of your arse and give her some bloody direction,” Watson taunted, accompanied by the sound of his cane hitting the floor harder than necessary. “She could act out whatever shit idea you have.”
“Huh?” John was startled out of his thoughts. Did he just... feel an artifact? He couldn’t explain why, but he just knew that this artifact was miserable here. “Sorry, what did you say?”
“Okay,” Stamford paused. “Could you talk to her first, before shouting at her in front of the whole crew?”
Sherlock followed him down the ladder to the alley, where he easily caught up. He tackled Hank next to a skip full of broken furniture, a bit too close to a wooden chair leg. Sherlock barely saw the hit coming, and certainly wasn’t expecting Hank to hit so hard. The explosive pain in his skull made him release his grip on Hank’s legs and scramble away, anticipating a second blow that never came.
“Depends on where it leads us.” Even though Sherlock knew that nothing good could possibly come of this, he was itching with anticipation, secretly hoping this was going to be worth his trouble. He was thankful the chase for the GPS hadn’t lasted long. He should probably thank John since it was his babbling that had triggered the idea. Later, he thought as he took out the printed pages of instructions and pulled his chair closer to the table.
There was a lump in Sherlock’s throat. This was probably the stupidest thing she had ever done, or was about to do, and it had the potential to ruin things between the two of them, yet she could not turn away, could never turn away, not anymore, not after seeing John like this. Unless John told her to stop, which, at this moment, did not seem to be the case.
It was the most beautiful thing she had ever heard spoken by John; her name wrapped in a breathless moan.
“Do you really think that could stop me from doing it anyway?” John wasn’t sure if he should separate them or leave them alone. He figured they must have some sort of history together. That would explain Sherlock’s present disdain of her. So, he is human, John told himself. He was wondering if he would be able to separate them without using the crop when the computer caught his attention.
“Hum?” Sherlock said, looking up. “Wait, we haven’t checked that.” He added when the man started to run; taking the bust out and throwing the box he was holding at Sherlock.
A flash of insult appeared on Holmes’s face before he could school his features. “Is there a reason you’ve poisoned me and tied me to a chair other than to insult me?”
John took a sip of wine and leaned back in his chair with a grave look. “Well, Lestrade noticed you were missing about an hour after the day was wrapped. We searched the studio, and I ended up in the infirmary again. And then… I don’t know why, but I remembered your comment about the horrible carpet. I mean, it’s a storage room, what is a carpet doing there?”
“Have you had any work done to the house in the last six months?” He asked as he looked around the room.
“So you just sing and dance and act like that with no prior experience,” Wiggins continued, staring at Holmes, who looked amused as well.
Amy and Jake come out of the building and look around. There are squad cars everywhere and a few pedestrians on the sidewalk. Amy sighs in frustration.
As he finished his plate and Holmes started his, Watson took a step back to contemplate the situation. Everything surrounding Holmes, especially tonight, felt surreal. Yet here they were, eating together in Watson’s flat as if it were the most normal thing in the world. As if they hadn’t just spent the evening breaking into a money laundering business for the biggest drug cartel in the East Coast and knocked out Frank Hudson with a telephone. Watson was almost disappointed there wasn’t anything special about how Holmes ate. Or maybe the fact that he was eating was odd, if what he said earlier was anything to go by.
Mrs Hudson’s hoover woke Sherlock the next morning, the irritating sound hitting a nerve. Why the hell was she cleaning this early in the morning?
“You knocked out a bloody cartel boss.” Watson wheezed as quietly as he could manage. “That was incredible.”
“Damn rubbish computer!” Sherlock swore loudly, making John stumble back, breaking the contact between them and bumping into the table behind him and sitting heavily on it. “I keep asking for maintenance but it always gets pushed back. If we didn’t have so much security clearance required it would be fixed already. Locating the artifact is going to take a moment.” The agent finished explaining as he rustled around his desk, seemingly looking for something that could help speed things up.
Watson frowned as he trailed off. There was something about those words, the way they sounded. Ms Adler had said them earlier.
He could’ve, if he hadn’t been focused on John’s warm calloused hand pressed against his chest instead of deducing Doris’ answers.
The truck was half full of wooden crates filled with large glass containers that Holmes was currently inspecting.
Sherlock held his breath, long enough to give John a moment to take the pictures, before releasing it slowly through his nose.
The Indigo Club was filled with elegantly dressed guests dancing, talking, and overall seeming to enjoy themselves. The lighting was different from earlier. It was dimmer, softer, giving the room a more intimate ambiance. There was a live band playing, tables with long white cloths around the room with a candle on each of them.
Mixed with the new information concerning John’s emotional investment in their partnership, Sherlock’s inability to continue the discussion made him highly uncomfortable, which resulted in babbling.
“What does an Irish immigrant starting a fire in 1879 have to do with the great London fire in 1666?” The man straightened his cuffs smugly before answering.
Sherlock took a deep breath, fighting to keep his focus. He spotted the riding crops, the only familiar items in the room from his brief time horseback riding.
“It’s important that you stay still so I don’t hurt you. The pain won’t be so bad since you’re dressed, but during a scene, it can be very painful, and not in the good way. So don’t move, okay?”
The tone disappeared and sound rushed back in. It felt a bit like getting hit by a bus in your ears.
Sherlock had two simultaneous reactions by two completely different parts of his brain. His amygdala, which got wrapped up in the idea of John being his friend, and his frontal lobe, running different scenarios of what the hesitation in John’s delivery could imply.
“I saw him using his phone to open the door. If he worked there, he should have used his key card. He was after something.”
“What’s stored here exactly?” He asked as he followed him to what he could only describe as the oddest golf kart he had ever seen. It looked as if it had merged with a roller coaster cart with the ramp that would normally be used to hold them in place, only now it just went from one side to the other like a dashboard. Only the dashboard was a 3’’ copper tube.
Only Anderson seemed to be struggling up the steps, looking distracted. They made it to the top, but faltered on the last step. He recuperated quickly, making it seem like it was part of the act, but two beats later he tripped. His arms flew out, hands trying to grab hold of anything around him. He tethered around, trying to find his balance, and ended up against the balcony ramp. His face relaxed, letting out a breath of relief, when the next moment he toppled back and over the ramp, falling sixteen feet to the concrete floor.
I went to the chair across from him, where his clients- our clients, as he always insisted on calling them, even when I had about as much involvement in the case as the chair itself- often sat.  He regarded me with a strange expression, such that I could not tell if he was glad to have me there for his perusal, or if he wished I would take myself off somewhere else- to the other side of the world, perhaps.  It was possible that he could not tell either.
I swallowed.  I knew we had understood each other, and that if I said so aloud he would as I had suggested never speak of it again.  “Yes,” I whispered.
.  In all that time I had myself convinced I only admired him, I should still have cheerfully have given him any physical demonstration of that devotion he would care to ask for.  My problem, I realized now, was not in thinking these thoughts- it was in not carrying them to their inevitable conclusion.  Even with his great powers of observation and his- perhaps even greater- sympathy with me he had missed the truth of my feelings, but he had not missed
It was indeed enough.  When I believed him dead, I thought a thousand times over that I would give anything to have him back.  A few sleepless nights and restless days were nothing.  The dull ache I felt knowing it would bring him no comfort if instead of pressing his hands I pressed his lips instead was less than nothing.  The affection, however distant, in his eyes as he pressed my hand in turn was an embarrassment of riches.
His other hand was in my reach as I stilled, so I pressed it.  I was more hesitant of touching him than he was of me because I knew that he would do nothing more or less than he was comfortable with- and that was as much because I knew he did not always care to have his thoughts broken into thusly as because I feared he would be imposed upon by any baser feelings I might have in me.  But when I did, he always seemed to welcome it, and me.
In that moment, I fancied things which at the time seemed to me beyond the pale.  That all this- from the moment Holmes took the burden of Crocker's secret upon himself onward- had been for my benefit.  So that I might watch someone I must surely see some kinship with enjoy the ending I myself could not.
He looked a little startled, and he surprised me in turn by swallowing heavily before he lifted his glass for me, allowing me to sip without touching it.  My lips were over his as I drank.  He must have noticed.  He was watching me too closely to do otherwise.
Holmes, I knew, would not take it further.  If lying to the police, even by omission, was difficult for him however noble the cause, then to push Hopkins in a direction he knew to be wrong would be much worse.  I said, “If it had been some other housebreakers- these new men or others not yet known to the Yard- at the Abbey Grange that night, it would explain why that crime was committed so close to an earlier one.”
As I watched Holmes, that new flare of light in his eyes sharpened into something bright and reckless, and he leaned closer still- closer and closer until the table between us seemed but empty air, no protection whatever from that keen gaze and the effect it all too often had on me.  “Let us ignore what later transpired for a moment.  Let us say he
John nods and turns to look at the nearly bare living room, then nods again and takes a step forward, then stops. (Oscillation. Curious.) “What...how do you…,” he trails off, gesturing towards the empty space without looking at me.
John blanches briefly before replying, “That’s surprising. I thought I made it clear how I felt about him when I put a bullet in his kneecap.”
Apologies for the delay on this chapter. I had a very busy weekend celebrating Beta_Jawn's birthday! Also, these two were giving me some trouble. I did not expect this to be...what it is. But I'm pleased with it. I hope you are too!
As I approach the door, Lestrade comes into view, his hand clutching his torso tightly as if attempting to hold his chest together. He tests out a deep breath and winces, confirming his internal hypothesis of at least 2 broken ribs. He sees John and I and raises his free hand, trying to stop us. “Wait, I need statements…,” he says with considerable effort. His voice is hoarse, and the beginning bloom of broken blood vessels peppers his throat in the pattern of fingertips.
dead to him for many months? Once we return to Baker street, will he find me irritating once more, barely putting up with me out of a sense of duty? I don’t believe my feelings towards him are a distortion; I have had them for much longer than we were apart. What about him? He never seemed...
Before I can finish, John plants his feet and bends my entire torso over his forearm. It catches me entirely off guard, eliciting a gasp of surprise as my perspective of the living room is upended. He bows over me, chest heaving into my stomach as he remains steady. I know he won’t drop me, so I allow myself the moment to bask in such an intimate gesture from the man I have given my world to.
