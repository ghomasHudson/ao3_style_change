“It doesn't matter Dean. I know you or not. Oh, and it wasn't your mother's but my own initiative. Besides, I want to take care of you, it's my fucking choice. Liked or not.” I refuted his words while I am helping him walk.
His love is far away from here, out of reach.
Fuck- he is crying once again.
“What time is it?” He asked me while placing the crutches besides him. I glanced at my watch.
gender neither female nor male,
They deserved each other just as blossoms need the sunlight.
When... he felt so ecstatic that he lost his balance and fell. He fell into a foreign world. A whole new world full of secrets and a great deal of other things, which he wishes to explore every corner of. He wants his eyes to open and he wants to feel everything with Dean. He wants to... experience
He knows that this might not be helpful in making feel better
‘’You know I love you, don't you?’’ Dean asked with his hurt voice finally looking at Cas. On the contrary, Cas didn't even give him a glance. His pain was too overwhelming.
UNDER A BEAUTIFUL SUNSET
Lisa was still looking at him with a suspicious gaze, until she grasped it. And she decided to confront him
I wrapped my arm around his firm waist and supported him while he was trying to walk. We were both wet but he was slightly more than me.
‘’It's
The melody of the sea was their music. Oh, these waves. How much they missed the sea. They loved it. The sand on their feet, the salty water in the corners of their lips. Shells next to their bodies. So many pleasant memories, so many nights, mornings and afternoons on the beach.
“It feels like you do it because you pity me. The last thing I want is your forced kindness, Cas.” He seemed so cold, empty, helpless, alone.
“No one has ever looked at me this way before...” he confessed, his eyes embracing mine.
‘’I'm just reluctant to tell you.’’
’ Cas replied as they sank into silence. The only sounds in the room were their heartbeats and breaths and maybe some giggles coming from Dean.
‘’Of course, there's no problem Sammy. It will be a chance for me to get to know the girl who blew your mind better.’’
Castiel. It's ok not feeling ok, but I'm begging you if you once again feel... you know, I want you to come and talk to me. You know you can trust me, don't you?’’ She took his hand in hers. He was still shivering, but Amelia's voice and touch calmed him down. He hasn't felt like that for long.
They deserved seeing each other get older day by day, lying on a beach and breathing easy, dancing together along wih the harmony of the waves, travelng the whole globe...
words from him.
I'm waiting for you, my darling.
, so loudly that even the dead will be awoken-
– Eternal Sunshine of The Spotless Mind.
? Maybe it's too early to say so but... If someone asked me to die for you, I wouldn't-’’
He smiled at her, he refrained from looking at Dean, besides they were in public and he had no reason to do so. Silence fell for a short period of time among them, he glanced at the place around before speaking again (it was around 6pm).
When you lose your world you are thrown into an absolute chaos and sit there alone · with agony and tears in your eyes, awaiting another Cosmogony. The Birth of All. Another start.
He was so alone.
Cas felt agitated, he immediately grasped what she meant but decided to pretend he didn't. ‘’I-I don't un-’’
“Maybe one day, years from now, we'll meet in a coffee shop, in a faraway city somewhere and we could give it another shot”
‘’What's up, pipsqueak?’’ Dean asked as he ruffled Sam's hair.
kind Jimmy is.
And in the end, he couldn't take it anymore.
When you lose your home you apparently become homeless. Lonely and void — your hopes sink in the tenebrous abyss.
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean keeps looking at his house and his beautiful lips are starting to form a nostalgic smile. His eyes are tearing up, his chest was going up and down constantly. His unique eyes were overflowing with feelings.
“I'm not, believe me, I'm the most boring person of the town! Sorry if I disappointed you. I am not completely ordinary and-”
‘’ I'm pregnant.’’
Dean knows all about these feelings better than anyone. He knows everything about grief. He knows everything about sorrow and emptiness.
She looked at him in a relieved manner before closing the door, but then she took notice of the red marks on his body, she gave him a broken smile. ‘’I'm s-sorry it's m-my fault.’’ He stuttered in a low tone stepping backwards.
“But, for your information, it's a long story. Maybe not the best but beautiful for sure... Someone I knew would describe it as a story about phantoms...of the cursed
?'' He raised his gaze to his hight and placed the book to the side. He got comfortable on Dean as he attempted once again to peek into what he was writing, but the latter reacted the same way.
Will they come across each other
In my eyes, Dean is like phantoms.
Every touch,
He knocked on his bedroom door but he didn't receive a reply, so he opened it and saw him there. Lying in his bed under the sheets. He was able to hear his sobs and his body? Oh this body he loves so much was shivering, shivering, shivering.
’’ Jack broke his silence, grabbing the children's attention.
We got inside of the café and I chose a table at the depth of the small building. Due to that time, there only a handful of people there.
only a singular number
At least, my sweet love of mine, we are going to be lost together in a glade. You and I, forever happy.
His whole word.
‘’It's okay, feel free to tell me. It's only the two of us, no one is gonna hear us.’’ Dean motivated him while Cas was aiding him to get into the car.
He wouldn't take his eyes off me, neither would I. He examined every feature of my face. I inhaled a deep breath before speaking.
He grined looking at him and bit his lower lip trying to conceal another sigh about to be released.
He lost him.
When I realized it, it was too late? He let a minor laugh slip from his lips. The way he was staring at me made fall into his chaos again and again... In this game he himself had initiated.
p.s. i'll probably post the next chapter around october ( I hope around october ) 'cause my last year on high school will start soon <3
He lost his everything.
After Cas died, after I lost my lover, I also lost myself. I lost every will to live, I lost myself because I lost him. Everyone who saw me the first time – but sometimes I'm still helpless — could tell that something tragic had happened to me, that I'd lost something... My loved one. My support, the only person I loved with my whole heart and beyond that, he was the only one who could banish my nightmares with a kiss, with a smile, with his touch, he was the only one who made me feel worthy, alive. I love him, I still love him, I still whisper the words every night every morning in the hope that I will get a response...
‘’When Dean was your age,’’ Mary stared and pointed at Dean, ‘’he didn't have the greatest companies. I'll never forgive you for what you did to those poor plants.’’
‘’Also. I forgot to tell you.’’ He started saying with an excited tone. "Amelia is pregnant." He stated moved, she stared at him impressed and overexcited on the verge of starting screaming but she remembered that there are people around.
Certainly.
‘’Are you going to stay here?’’ He asked Dean.
Not long after, our tongues started fighting for dominance. His fingers were tracing the skin of my face. We both had our eyes shut.
‘’Do you think we'll manage to make it?’’
And he reached there... The final destination, before the end, before the last goodbye. Oh, this damn word. This damn goodbye.

Castiel followed his lead and took a seat beside him on another chair. He immediately grabbed a newspaper to occupy himself. There weren't any other patients with them in the waiting room. Probably a last one inside the office who kept the orthopaedic occupied. He was able to catch some scattered words from the conversation between the doctor and the patient coming faintly through the door, just as he caught Dean's eyes on him.
this new world provides. He wants to be
And he wants to assume that they are still one. Castiel still loves this special and unique human being. Castiel feels every single emotion he missed out on all these years. He finally feels. - Dean made him to feel, he teach him how to feel, they teach each other many lovely and soft things.

This story is cursed.

"You- you are you!You are the angel of the Lord- God, what I'm even saying- You can't be dead. You aren't dead. No, no... You are strong and a freaking warrior. You know how to survive. You are you Cas." He wasn't ready to continue, he was awfully close to- he was crying, it was too late. He couldn't stop.
"I love you too...maybe more than you do..." he caught his hand, they got old, he thought.
stay safe xxx
He can't stand being away from him. He desires to be close to him, he needs it, and now that he has to stay apart from his for a particular period of time, that he will only recall some memories with him, he is flight to miss him.
I'm lost and nothing can save me.
“No.” He answered with honestly.
Even if
enough to surrender himself completely to anyone, to open up and speak his feelings out for fear of the repercussions. But the tragic truth was that he was scared of the he Fall from Heaven down to Earth.
The difference is that it weren't the Sirens' songs which threw them in the sea, but themselves. Their vice and them.
‘’Cas-’’
‘’Why are you awake?’’ He asked the kid.
Dean started laughing to hide his embarrassment, Castiel glanced at him with the corner of his eyes, his heart was filled with delight when he saw him happy.
‘’Holy cow you don't wanna know how many times she got drank that summer
‘’I wish the same for you Dean, have a lot of kids with Lisa.’’ Mary said.
He satisfied him. Just like Cas did to Dean.
We have been gathered in the living room for ritually two hours. Something happened, I thought. I don't know why I care for him... Maybe because everyone here care so much for him... Maybe because...
The only two words I hear excessively the past few days. All the members of the Winchester family are excited and really anxious at the same time, personally I don't know what to feel for... You know... For him. The reason: their lost son is coming home tonight after years. They are so happy they will finally get to see him. After all these years he is finally coming back. For days now they have been trying to organize everything to welcome home Dean Winchester again. The eldest son of the family. He left his home almost four years ago... and he went to war.
‘’Yes, it does and don't say this word again.’’ Mary cut him off and answered quickly.
He grinned and nodded. ‘’ How long have you two... you know.’’
‘’So that means it is for oldsters?’’ Asked her son bewildered. She then tickled him as her father used to do to her when she said trifles. ‘’No,
And Dean, he was left behind alone, under the hot sun which was warming his face. He was on the verge of collapsing, he had so many questions to ask him. So many hopes. But ultimately he just left him behind...
Just because I'm thirteen it doesn't mean I'm a baby boy.’’
So he left. They took him away three weeks after they had found out that their son had been having a love affair with his best friend for two years- and he got married. Simply. Without going against his parents' will, he didn't even say he loved me, he just let them humiliate me...’’ he stopped once again and locked eyes with Amelia, dry tears on their beautiful faces.
would like it to remain between the both of us though, alright?’’Cas nodded with a broken smile and whipped away his tears.
Try again. Now, for Cas.
care anyway.’’ He said indifferently and sat next to him. He had a cigarette in his hand which he puffed on one last time before asking again ‘’Anyway, want a puff?’’
The time was almost 3am. After he had drunk his water he decided to go back to his bedroom. His fingers touched the doorknob but they never pushed it down to open the door.
They both needed it.
Feeling impotent to do something different or speak, he just nodded his head. How is he going to end it? With what power? He can't...
He looked at the ceiling. ‘’As Mary said, we don't always get what we want. At the moment, you'd prefer to be in Barcelona or in London.’’ He stated.
that they were meant to say the final
Oh Lord, them?
“I can feel you, you know...it's better to be there...find yourself being lost in your own thoughts rather than the real world...” I smiled when I understood that he agrees with me and didn't get annoyed that I had been ignoring him for so long.
“Of course, I am!”I slightly raised my voice, just to break the ice. But, in reality, there was never awkwardness between us. We never felt like we're strangers. Since the first time we lay our eyes on each other, we have felt like we've known each other forever. We didn't need say much... only the things we didn't know about each other.
Dean was afraid that he didn't have much time left. That his end was upcoming and that he didn't have time to live. That he wouldn't get to do all those minor but enjoyable for him things. That he wouldn't achieve his individual goals. That he wouldn't feel free. That he would leave early.
These goddamn mistakes. And sometimes he just stays silent.
. You. I missed being next to you.’’ They were both staring at the road, no eye contact between them. The darkness was embracing a world used to being full of light.
‘’You don't have to know and you're too young.’’ Dean looked at his mother and then at his brother.
“Yeah?” His eyes on me again, I turned my torso towards face him. He did so as well.
Peacefully. They would find redemption, their Ithaca. Their love was their haven.
, just give people a chance to speak and finish their sentence, will you?’’ He asked as he took ahold of his hand. He whispered a gentle "
‘’Nothing important.’’ He answered almost immediately.
single second of his life. Not even a minute away from him. Dean is the most wonderful second and memory of his. He felt truly free for the first time in his life when he looked into those piercing emerald eyes. Dean Winchester's eyes. He broke out of the tower and got a little closer to him. Dean makes him feel free, he makes him feel like himself. Castiel was himself when he was with Dean.
He was making her worry, he was making her sad, he was making her ache for his mistakes and mishaps. He miserably failed to make her happy, he failed...he instantaneously thought before dragging his hurting body put of the bathtub. He was still in able to show love to someone who deserved it. He was gladly receiving the love she offering him and he was destroying it.
We walked towards the car and the short trip to the Winchester House. I was able to smell intense scent of wine and smoke coming from him. He was so drunk; I could see how lost he was on his world. His eyes were closed, and his hands wrapped around his forehead. He was exhausted.
They were not sleepy yet. Their impatience to listen to the rest of their mother's story kept them awake.
And should he be fortunate- which there in no doubt about, for his mother her son would find his significant other, even if he himself was doubtful.
The memory,
And before you say they deserved better, I share your view.
“How do you—”
But I'm being sincere. This story doesn't have on the best endings.
“I'm sorry for making drive such a long way”
“You are cold”
? Maybe everything he touches becomes useless, he destroys it.
At the end of the path, at the end of the world, that's where you'll find me, under a sunset like this one, under a beautiful sunset, beside shore. And grab a cheap bottle of whiskey and let us be lost together.
His love is lost.
“All happened so quickly! The bomb exploded next to him; he was trying to save the life of his friend. He said, he promised to his wife he will be back. And, oh my Lord... My love... He never broke a promise. The doctor said he wouldn't be able to walk normally again. His left leg is in a terrible condition. It is really difficult for him to walk, but...If he is willing enough and gains courage, he will manage to cure! In the end, after the war had ended, he needed some time to be alone with himself. ” Dean's fiancé is really excited about his return. But I can't blame her, if I were to meet the love of my life, I would be in the moon too.
“Dean, be quite-”
And...perhaps he was driving with a low speed to stay alone, with him, to gain some more of their borrowed time. For people in love live with borrowed time. For more pearls to fall from his emerald eyes, to sink in his thoughts and memories.
very substantial,
A deep breath. Then, another one.
What might they be thinking?
And...This? Oh, this was his own moment. His. A moment just for himself.
To breath, and he is this one reason...
‘’Fine, I-I guess... I want to leave this place. No matter how much I love it here I feel like it's suffocating me and turning me into someone I don't like...and I just want a home. Either huge or small, either light blue or lime, near the woods and a lake so I can go fishing. I want a garden, so I can grow my own crops and a spacious yard stepped in plants and flowers. Or near the sea, so I can go there and lose myself into it... I want a home which feels like home.’’
‘’I've seen how you two look at each other-You're both sick, if you think you have a future with Dean, you're terribly wrong. He's mine and always will be.’’
He nodded and without saying anything else he closed his eyes. He could feel those glaucous eyes glued on his figure, staring at him in a persistent way that made his heartbeat accelerate.
I opened the car door and I gave him my hand. He didn't say anything, he didn't say no or anything. He just used me to support himself before he grabbed his crutches and I helped him for one more time, but it was fine... He looked at me for sort moment and I felt my whole world turning upside down. It's really weird how much he can already affect me. And this was only the beginning, later I'm a part of him as he is a part of me. We affect each other with so many ways. Good and bad.
“Let's go home, Cas. It's getting late.” He suggested as he took down his last sip of his tea. He put on his old coat and I supported him on my way to the car. But of course, before we left the cafeteria, I paid for his drink...
But, there's a person, a really special person, a really wonderful person to him who wise up him how to love himself. How to exist. And might Dean taught to this person how to love, how to care, how to feel-
Everything it's beautiful about them.
Their Ithaca.
’ he added, he was on the verge of crying. He missed me, he thought momentarily. He smiled. Of course he smiled, only this is what he can do while he is with him. He was about to speak when he interrupted him ‘’Not you,
“I have time available.”  I said aware of the fact that my words weren't true. Every minute with Dean counted, he smiled as he checked the time in his old watch. Then he moved his gaze to me, if only we could stay like this forever.
“Baby, you need to relax... Just let me help you forget...” I murmured; he took a deep breath as he looked at me.
-- Before he loses him for good, for forever. Before he disappears again. This time - he won't listen to the soft sound of his angelic voice. He won't see his ocean again. He won't see his lovely lips again. That he really wanted to feel in his lips. But he is long gone. He is- on a empty word.
This confined, yet bright and graphic library knows everything about me, every minor and crucial secret. All these books know who I really am. They know the poems I hide behind these thick books which aren't approached by anyone- except for me. They sometimes know me better than my own self. I miss the feeling that overwhelmed me every time I casted my eyes onto that paper heaven-this is how I call it- I miss the sense of warmth.
though, will you?’’ Dean broke out of his silent cell. His voice was filled with hopefulness.
I followed his gaze, it lied upon the small stream of potable water, fairly away from here but you're still able to distinguish slightly details which unveil the beauty of this natural paradise. Then the tree house built by Sam two summers ago.
This person was really close to his goal. Really, really close. But he- he, isn't- he is- he, he is...
Along with his love.

Her daughter's voice interrupted her.
One thing was for sure, whenever he looked at him, his gaze was shouting 'I love you'
‘’About what?’’ He asked almost in a whisper, his gesture was cold towards him.
your brother. ” I said to him as he sat next to me, he smiled.
And afterwards we'll reach the point before the cursed Fall.
The terror of how to introduce myself, how to behave next to the new person I was on the verge of meeting... It's not that I'm unwilling to meet him. Everything begins from the fact that I'm afraid to meet him...
"You know... I still love you..." confessed the now aged man to the man he always loved. His gaze unchanged. When he glanced at him he saw his Ithaca, his home, his redemption.
'“See you later Castiel...” He said with a friendly smile, before he closed the door of the library.
''It's not at all about you know, I just want to see what you're writing'' He answered somehow annoyed, Dean kissed his cheek and Cas raised his hands to place them softly on his bare chest. Cas' heart was beating so fast that it threatened to escape while he felt Dean's hands caressing his skin as he was writing in his small notebook. He was melting under Dean's touch like the snow starts melting once it meets the sun.
‘’If that's what you really want and what's best for you...
"I-I miss you, you know..." he started speaking again, his voice calmer. It was a way to feel better. To feel closer to his lost lover. "I'm really miss you-like- fuck... I'm sorry", he can't control himself.
I guess no one knows
I know it sounds like a cheerful fairy tale. Perhaps intriguing, and in all likelihood, you are going to narrate it to your offspring years from now, for the reason that they will be asking you to tell them a love story.
Hell, both protagonists have a tragic end.
‘’I had forgotten about it, but,’’
! Can't we just skip all these details
It's time for another
Whoever noticing these marks, their initial impression is that he and Amelia have active serial life, even though in reality it's exactly the opposite. She never put pressure on him to do something. Cas knows very well that Amelia desires to have a kid and he is eager to give her one, everything for her happiness and welfare. He cares about her and he wants to see her happy. He knows how much she loves kids and how much she wants one. Regarding his own happiness; He's here, beside him, who's kissing him in such a great manner that he goes insane. Cas is certain that Dean is smiling through his kisses and while moving his thighs against Cas' hips. He can feel Dean's boner touching him.
‘’And…
Cas always returns to Dean. Always. Always and forever. They belong to each other.
They were everything that
‘’I'm so happy for you.
“Let's finally go inside, shall we?” He just processed my sentence for a few seconds, looked at me for a while filled with anxiety and pressure.
“I am... But I know that the man who will walk through this door will not be my brother...He will be someone else and— ”
He has always been and always will be. Always. He will go on being alive, even if life hurts like a bullet in the heart. Even if life hurts like hell. For him. He will keep him alive in his heart. Cas is still alive because Dean is also alive.
He was my soulmate... My other half, my heart and my soul. My whole body, he was me. He was the world to me; he was my shelter... And... I used to believe we were two silly boys who fell in love, but the truth is; we were always one.
Gone.
Certainly.
The night,
was on the verge of crying.
“You know, you have really charming eyes, you should take an advanced of that, I'm sure a lot of girls would die just to look at them...” He said as he stared looking me closely. I laughed with his last compliment. And then, I just I smiled, for the first time after years I smiled with a true smile.
“I hope only good things...” I said as I stop this silly augment. He shook his head positively as he drank a little more of his hot chamomile, I didn't see him worried if we'd be late to come back, and that's what I did, I stopped caring, and I just enjoyed those moments.
“Dean for the love of God – ”
Through his rain of tears he placed his hands on his head in his panic-stricken and crying state, alone, dully, sorrow had devoured his soul, endless tears were running from his eyes while the warm water was falling on him, his whole body was trembling. He was trying to stop his tears but his attempts proved vain. He started biting his lower lip nervously.
His eyes were red due to all the exhaustion and the alcohol. He closed his eyes again. Afterwards, he started unbuttoning the initial bottoms of his uniform.
“You really don't have to; it wasn't that much of a trouble. If you ever need help with anything I'm here again. I'll always be here.” I said in a calm voice when I saw again that he was still concerned about the same thing, maybe he felt remorse, or he was mad at himself.
‘’Dean please stop-’’ Cas whined annoyed, but Dean didn't have that in mind. They once again started heading to the car.
Castiel didn't stay in her hug for long, the pain for his wounds was unbearable and he wished to feel a little... like his home. A tiny bit safe.
Love.

Across the vast ocean. It's waves were quite calm, creating an enchanting melody, almost magical. ‘’

whose song renders you theirs. As our protagonists, they were enchanted by their songs.
‘’You'd better get ready, Sam is already downstairs having breakfast with a friend of his, I think her name's Jessica. Either way, John wants us to go into town and you'll have to go to the harbour in the evening to receive a package sent with a ship.’’ She said somewhat in a hurry and gave him clean clothes.
“I'm sure Dean understood his mistake. He said that he isn't going to do this again. He learned his lesson by sending him in the war”
‘’Why are you still standing here? Food's ready. Aren't you guys hungry?’’
‘’Do you want me to keep you company?’’ He whispered touching the wooden chair. It was probably one of the countless times he'd seen a nightmare. He didn't look at him, he was playing with his sheets as his tears flowed down his cheeks.
He felt incapable of helping and protecting him. He just approached him, lied beside him in the bed wrapped his arms around him tightly. He pulled him closer to his torso and held him there. Their heart had become one. They could feel each other's hearts beating. It had been a long time since they last felt this way.
I heard him whispering while we were looking at each other, his words sounded familiar to me...
. It isn't for oldsters.’’
Perhaps, I'll never be able to put in proper words this wonder of nature. Yet I swear that my soul finds peace when my eyes fall onto this image. If only I knew how to hold properly a brush to capture my memories on an easel...
Hii, sorry for posting this really really late, i know its been months. Many shits are still happing on my life right now, anyway I hope u enjoy this :) <3
“Wonderful idea. You can borrow my car. Please be back soon with him”, John said, and he handed me his car keys. I saluted everyone while getting out of the wooden door and striding towards the small white car.
One hand was on the handle of the car while the other on his cigarette which was still burning there. He bit his lips while he looked at me. He opened the door, his first move was to throw his cigarette on the ground and step on it, and right now I just wish I hadn't said anything. Just sit in silence for even more minutes, maybe forever saying nothing, so silent in the silence of our own chaos.
of everything from now onwards.
“That's a long story.”
‘’Of course I do!’’ He raised the tone of his voice.
And he would always cater for his needs. Or at least that's what he wanted.
Another day that no one missed to inform him how he has changed the last weeks, about his dark circles under his exhausted glaucous eyes, about his weight loss, that he has to try more, eat more and drink more water. He was tired and it's too early.
He didn't search for the sun since it was already beside him. He didn't even try, for he knew. He knew his sun was him. The boy with the thousands of colours.
Me and You. Us. Just us.
“Actually—”
The more I lay my eyes on him, the more willingness overpowered me to get to know him.
"I know" He smiled before leaving a sweet kiss on his lips.
And this is making him sad every now and then, his heart is breaking again and again, because he's taken it seriously. And he misses him and he's only thinking about him and no one else. There is nothing else apart from him. Dean Winchester.
He just agreed with her decision and hugged her once again before starting to walk towards the harbour.
I was already soaked from head to toe. They have already informed me about the place I have to go to. It is a half-an-hour drive. Their house is one the outskirts of the city. When I reached the place, I felt my stress levels increase rapidly once again.
‘’Good
He smiled to me and extended his arm, pointing his cigarette to my place. “U-um no-no thank you. I don't smoke”, I declined his offer as politely as possible, our fleshes were almost touching when he pointed his cigarette to me.
He knew he was in town, he had a slight hope that maybe he would see him, at least for five minutes, at least for a moment. At least for for a mere moment to see those eyes resembling forest... at least for a mere moment to see and hear that sweet laugh, he wanted him close, but the cruel reality was he was far away. What might Dean be doing now? Where is he? Which sea are you in? Which sea are you lost in? Are you alright? Are you safe and sound my sun?

event of Earth. With Dean by his side he would be able to overcome all his fears. He could Fall for him even for a trillion times. Except for his greatest fear, which he will never be able to overcome. And that is living the rest of his life
“You must be Castiel! I finally meet you...” He said to me in a friendly tone. I reassured him.
Maybe she was jealous. Well, for sure.
They deserved everything.
He averted his gaze to the old barn, only few times I happened to be there. It's located a few meters away from the house... all of a sudden, he formed his pink lips into a soft smile, almost like he reminisced a pleasant memory.
“That you know a story about soulmates” Said the siblings in unison.
Ithaca.
Their lips still connected, Cas left a soft groan before saying through the kiss ''Can I see,
“Tell me something new. My father always is upset with me...Anyway, how do I look?” He asked as he smiled at me.
A trace of sorrow made its way to his face.
As soon as I finished my announcement and the waitress left to prepare it, she'd probably be back in a few minutes, he looked at me with an angry look that didn't last long. He broke his anger with a smile, it was like he was surrendering, and he agreed. It's been half an hour since we left that place where I found him drunk, tired and in a bad state -- not that he's better now, hell he is not, I can just see that he's feeling even a little better -- and at least one since I left the Winchester's house and went to pick up Dean. I knew Mary in particular would be worried, but we're entitled to the constant rain that's been falling with momentum for hours.
Because you would be eager to do anything for the sake of that particular person, for them to be safe and sound, for them to keep breathing and staring at you with their mesmerising eyes that you appreciate so much. You would even put risk getting burned from a fire or put yourself in front of them to protect them from a silver bullet.
Castiel said to him many years ago. He was almost saved. They were almost together. They were almost saved. They were almost in love. Angels can't feel tenderness, longing, affection, fear of losing someone you love and many other feelings. This is what Dean is telling to himself years now even now. After-

Cas gave a hurt smile and stood up when he saw Lisa getting close to them (Dean didn't even bother to stand up). When Lisa saw him move away for her to take a site beside Dean she offered him a kind smile and sat next to her fiancé.
Like a little kid annoyed for being scolded for something he didn't do. Dean was like this, he didn't bother to reply to his mother's words.

Maybe Dean doesn't deserve Castiel's love. Maybe he indeed has to put an end in their love affair. But what about their dreams? Those insignificant dreams? They'll drown with them. They have so many dreams. Especially Dean.
The worst distance which two people can happen to be in is the one where they are both able to feel each other's heartbeats. It's true. This is the worst situations, in which you see incapable of doing anything, having no clue what your next move should be. You only stare into their eyes, lost, seeking the right words which have scattered on the ground. But nothing at all, you just keep getting lost in this beautiful chaos.
eyes and Dean smiled at him.

But this never happened, because we're still at the beginning of the story.

‘’I hope you alright.’’ She worries about him, unfortunately a lot, he hadn't gotten in touch with him during all this period of time, he hadn't heard his voice for a long time, three weeks and some days more may not be a big deal for someone else but for him it's lost moments, lost time.
A whole life.

His love is not near him.
‘’You know your father-’’
He was enable to see this beautiful and unrealistic view that the few rays of the sun enlightened. He wished his lover was there with him.
“Your face was funny” I whispered, still not looking at him due to my shyness...He is really adorable.
Castiel will only die for good when Dean Winchester dies. And Dean Winchester has so many years ahead.
He answered him in the same way, he wasn't able to hear his voice and see the pain he felt, the pain lying underneath Cas' broken smile, but he understood it for sure. It was a given he shared this feeling, this pain.
Their destiny opted for different paths. Full of pain.
Like the breeze and the warm sunlight, like the constellations. Waves always return to the coast,

Lisa was about to decline Cas' offer but Dean stepped into the conversation. ‘’Deal, but first want to ask a friend a question.’’He said and without further ado he lifted himself from the bench and approached a sailor who was looking at them, that moment Lisa fixated her look on Cas.
“Headache?” I asked him, as I moved my gaze from the road to him.

What about
Nothing more, nothing less.
“Castiel! Here you are!” Sam said as he was walking to my place, I smiled to him as I put down my drink onto the table.
The other was left behind.
That would be their last moment to spend together. "I missed you" He whispered wreckly.
It must be him.
He state releasing the smoke from his mouth. ‘’Yeah, sure. Your father said you had to go to Mr. Bobby Singer to help you decide on a wedding costume. Today. Don't forget it. Also, you have an appointment with your doctor today to examine your leg. Take a taxi, he's too far away.’’
“Castiel...” he started saying with a soft voice. He stopped, he didn't move his eyes of me, he just started looking me more, like he was trying to understand something... Or as my mother used to say: to read my soul.
Upon the sun's departure for its mysterious journey- the sunlight was touching his pale face gently. And his tears- these tears now resembled gold, and not invaluable stone. And he, exasperated, would sell them without second thoughts to bring his angel back. To bring his love back home. He would sell his own soul to the devil. He knew his lover would love him with every imperfection and perfection. With regard to his broken heart; He knew his angel would offer him his own. He would do anything to come closer to his love
Cas just chuckled.
‘’A cigarette?’’ At first he didn't mind him, he thought he was another passerby asking for a firelighter, he didn't answer indicating he didn't have one. But then he acknowledged that voice. That sweet sound. He turned his head and his gaze fell upon him. His lips formed into an ecstatic smile. He missed him, he missed him so much. Him and is voice.
Silence dominated the room once again. It was approximately nine o'clock and Dean should have been here at least two hours ago.
The sun was hiding behind the immense mountains, which were still decorated in snow, and its rays which embraced the beautiful flowers have disappeared, replaced by the soft moonlight. I looked at the sky, before it turned a mysterious, deep, blue color.
“Thank you, but I don't really care about girls anymore...But yours too...”
Did he ever love himself?
You would notice majestic flowers, villagers here and there, you would be likely to see some beasts in the woods or under your bed.
The tears had dried on his face. He looked at Cas with a broken smile.
“Not bad, considering this is the first time you smoke” He said, grabbing the cigarette from my hands and putting it between his lips again.
He just smiled slightly. “So, you prefer Castiel?” His voice soothing at the beginning of his sentence but switched to childish in the last word in an attempt to imitate mine, but he fell through.
Afterwards, a middle-aged woman approached our table. “What would you like to order?” She asked kindly and I looked at Dean. He completely ignores her as he keeps glancing at me...
‘’My love, I'm not going to the war,
“Do I have something weird on my face?” He said sternly but teasingly at the same time. I just rolled my eyes and averted my gaze.
He continued, placing the cigarette between his lips once again.
''I'm wondering who's the baby here...'' he replied and connected his lips to Dean's, kissing him sluggishly.
He advised him. ‘’It will help, I suppose.’’ Dean followed Cas' words and did what he was told to do. He turned to look at him for a moment.
. Because he is, he stood up to plenty of hardships thus he has to be proud of himself for keeping up fighting and being
‘’It's okay.’’ He replied, coughing at the end of his sentence. His whole body was trembling. He was under the impression that he was playing with fire when, in reality, no one was. There was never a fire. Only the the flame between Dean and him, their passion. It may sound cliché but it's the truth. They're suns.
He denied the fact that he wished to spend the rest of his life with Cas and look what he's been led to...
‘’Cas I-I'm pregnant!’’ Tears of joy rolled down their cheeks. He grabbed her into a hug and kissed her forehead.
‘’At least I wasn't running naked along the beach
It was only the two of us and the kiss no one could break. We didn't need oxygen, time froze. Everything froze around us. There was nothing apart from our now burning soul. Apart from the moment Dean pulled me closer to him. It was like he wouldn't be able to go on without me.
Why should it exist?
He cut her off "Love is never a sickness." He wondered how he found the confidence to talk back to her, but he did.

‘’You ask the greatest questions you know’’ He said asked he left a kisses on his lips. ‘’For you, of course. Don't forget you're my muse’’
‘’He's mine.’’ She stated plainly and calmly.
‘’Then... What do you really want?’’ Asked Dean, not breaking eye contact with the person who makes him feel like... him.
He looked at the flower. It was beautiful, but not so beautiful as Cas. Cas is the most and unique flower.
“It's nearly eleven o'clock. Almost Friday.” I answered.
And he hurts... he hurts
‘’I think I have to agree with your mother.’’ He answered as he sipped his wine.
‘’I remember the day he got discharged from the hospital and walked us to the beach... he talked about his childhood... I wonder how he used to live here for seventeen years and never visited this area.’’ He said and glanced at his surroundings.
I said as I finished my sentence with a little laugh. He seemed speechless, Ι didn't say a word, he just keeps looking at me like he was trying to convince me to talk, to say my story to him, but I didn't answer. If I had anything interesting to say, I'd say it, but I have nothing to say, maybe some other day, maybe.
souls...” The children were intrigued by each and every word of hers. She glimpsed at the clock on the wall, eight o'clock.
Sam, of course, being the generous brother he is, offered himself to accompany Dean, but the latter declined this offer. No, he didn't want Sam in the co-driver's seat, he told him to stay with Jack. ( And about Jack?This kid seems... Different. Sometimes when he looks at Jack he sees Cas. His Cas. His Angel. But no. No, no, no Jack is Lucifer's son. He can't be like Cas. None is like Cas. None. ) He wasn't willing to let his baby brother see him break down once again today, he can't stop crying today. From the moment he opened his eyes - if he even slept - he started crying. He is really broken, more than everyone.
And how many times will they fall? Besides, you have to fall in order to learn how to fly,
Dead.
‘’I wasn't too far you know, only a six-hour trip.’’ He said sarcastically and tasted the spoon sweet Gabriella offered him. She always put a smile on his face. And she definitely noticed his sorrowful smile.
But I can understand that.
“Oh, my Lord! Yes! Of course, and yes, I'd like everything you have from drinks right now... and... and a pie with a lot of—.” he began to say eagerly as he looked at the list.
Will their lips connect once
We will pass by the nymphs and fairies, the land of the Lotus Eaters, maybe Circe and Calypso, and if we are fortunate -or unfortunate- we will pass by the Isle of Laestrigonians. We'll encounter countless hardships.
‘’And... And, I can't imagine my stupid, miserable life without you either.’’ He whispered to him and placed a gentle kiss on his crimson cheeck and afterwards on those soft lips of his.
He rubbed his eyes with his knuckles and answered ‘’Dean's

But their fate was playing a different game.
“I finally found you! Where have you been all day? I searched the whole farm!”
Dean whispered a 'thank you' with a smile. Neither of them grasped how the time came for them to embark on one of their short journeys.
I didn't answer right away, the truth was, I was really cold. It was past time, after all, strong icy air was blowing, it's not summer yet.
The young lady inhaled deeply as she laid her eyes on her children. She had already gotten more comfortable on the

“How come you're calling me Cas?” I questioned and my face formed a curious expression.
He gives a small beautiful smile as he rolled his eyes, “Of course I am!” He said with a very proud tone of his voice.
His heart shatters in pieces once again to this thought. This time he won't return to him.

‘’The doctors say that...you know, he doesn't have much time left.’’
“So...Castiel, tell me something about you?” I felt nervous, for one more time today, more than before. I wasn't able to respond to that I am not an interesting person. I'm still a simple person, same as the others, nothing important, maybe even unusual together. But perhaps stranger. But one thing's for sure, I'm not interesting as a person, but of course he is, I want to know everything that has to do with him. I want to know him.
Cas moved away from Dean. ‘’Dean, stop behaving like a kid, because you're not one anymore.’’ He exclaimed, pulling his hand out of Dean's.
“I love you”
It's been so,
He was nowhere to be found.
“It was Mary... You know her... She is overreacting... sometimes...” I lied.
No, I'm not. My feelings towards her are not erotic, she is only a very generous and reliable friend to my eyes. I smiled to her as she sat next to me, still here. Still in this beautiful paradise full of books.
I stopped him; he was so angry. Completely lost of his mind. Great Castiel. Great. You don't even know him yet and you make him angry...So stupid...
How?! How was he apposed to live without his presence? How was he apposed to smile again?
“Pretty please!” They once again shouted in unison and looked at their mother impatiently. She smiled and wiped away a tear.
‘’I'm actually skilled too. I used to spend whole hours at the beach trying to learn how to fish. I can find a boat for us to go fishing together if you want.’’
" before raising his gaze into Dean's eyes. Dean left a tender kiss on his hand, which sparked weird feelings in Cas and caused his heartbeat to speed up.
‘’I missed you too though. Besides, you know my love for you is greater than my love for the see.’’ He whispered, not looking at him.
His face was scarlet red, resembling a crimson rose in the rain and not only that, his eyes were swollen, oh these little glaucous eyes were unrecognisable from all the crying. Some parts of his body had been burned by the hot water. His face unveiled his mental and physical exhaustion. He wrapped his lower body with a towel- he instantaneously shut his eyes from an intense discomfort and he opened the door, then he saw her. Amelia with tears on her face.
him, in a colorless world Cas found colour only in Dean. Cas is a beautiful and peaceful combination of colours.
Real love for someone.
Cas' heart felt like it stopped beating for a mere second. But when his eyes met Dean's ones infusing hope and confidence, his heart was offered strength to start beating again.
“Are you feeling better?” I asked him and turned my torso towards him. I unbuckled my seat belt and looked at him again, my gaze showing interest.
“Our love...” I said as I dropped a kiss to his
So and Dean.

.’’ Dean stated and headed to the table carefully. The others went to the kitchen to help Mary with dinner preparations. John was busy doing a job thus he was absent.
Forever,
He broke down. He broke, he broke, he-- He fell on the ground crying his soul out and sobbing, expecting his love to return to him.
But it's beautiful,
A beautiful and promising word. Unique and mysterious. It's a sorrowful fact that it is an unattainable dream. A dream unable to be accomplished. For people in love are cursed. We are cursed, my love... The cursed poets who still have hope.
that he would
He can't think anything else than Cas.
He closed his eyes for a moment and allowed the touch of the sunlight to urge him to their romantic place under a beautiful sunset. He just imagined that the sunlight was his angel. Cas. And that they danced together, shortly before darkness covers the Creation. He took pleasure in this touch before it was gone completely.
“Dean, I'm so sorry, I know you enjoy this silence, but we should go inside before—”
Afterwards, they walked towards the harbour, they had parked their car near the train station, close to the spot he first met Dean. Amelia told him that she wanted to trow a visit to her childhood friend to communicate the happy news to her. She also told him that she would take a taxi if she stayed longer.
Dean gazed upon him with a tender smile, while getting closer to him, his eyes still glowing in the dark, so extrextraordinary yet disastrous. Dean's eyes infused Cas with a feeling of safety.
''Maybe he's my everything.'' He murmured as he put out his cigarette, once again he gazed outside, almost dusk. Even though it was June the last few days had been rainy and the coold breeze hits his window. It was late. Around four. He should have been sleeping by the side of his fiancé.
He was exhausted, with tender and careful movements, she helped him put on his clothes. He thanked God once again for giving him a wife with a heart of gold. After a few minutes, Amelia complimented him, ‘’You look perfect.’’ She said kindly with a smile on her reddish lips. He answered with a smile as well.
He slipped his hand through his soaking wet hair. I somehow felt really uncomfortable with his move.
The ocean was one of the greatest things he had ever seen in his life-bigger and deeper than anything he had imagined. It changed its color and shape and expression according to time and place and weather. It aroused a deep sadness in his heart, and at the same time it brought his heart peace and comfort.
No, he couldn't.
Like the Sun, it is shining bright in the sky whether behind mountains or exposed in the sky. And if it runs out of fuel? When the sun stops shining, they will have been already lost, near the stars.
Like tomorrow will never come.
‘’I will try my best to come... It's also
For their souls are cursed.
‘’I'm sorry’’ His voice is whisper, but Dean still managed to hear him. ‘’I'm sorry...’’ he repeated.
, like now, despite the fact that his smile was broken. They remained like this, connected.
You don't think you deserve to be saved?
, not only did they deserve the best but a life together, this supposed long-lasting, joyful life. They deserved to age next to each other, find their home, acquire pets, offspring.
he thought.
‘’I know. But first I have to go the doctor's.’’ The latter replied pointing his face to a low building before them. Cas gulped, he glanced at the building and then at Dean. He nodded and helped Dean go up some steps since he would struggle on his own. He held open the central door for him to enter. Once he did, Dean walked to a wooden chair, the waiting room was lightened by the scant light coming through the narrow window. Nothing extraordinary was seen, just the blurry image of the see which was covered by the curtain.
Dean hoped he would finally hear the words he desired to hear coming out of his mouth, those words no one carries the courage to utter.
Oh Lord, what do I do at this point? Me and Dean? We have no hopes. We are similar to those damn soulmates who aren't able to be together for some reason... In this day and age? If Dean and I... there won't be any happily ever after.
ecause I would never dare to leave you alone. Even the thought is scaring me, what would my
Fairy tales have
The next hours flowed like a river, everyone was in their bedrooms until midnight. The last one to leave was Mary as she wanted to clean the kitchen.
Don't tell me you thought otherwise?’’ He answered him softly and released the smoke from his lungs. He placed the cigarette between his lips again. He resembled a work of art. If only he knew how to use a paintbrush properly to imprint on a canvas every chaotic detail of him. To leave a map of kisses on him to make him his.
“Are you happy?” She asked, I can sense that she is really worried about me. But I don't know. I don't really know if I'm happy right now, I can't put into words my feelings right now.

‘’I wouldn't do it…’’
She kept looking out of the window, as her father used to do during her childhood.
Dean often happens to cry with no specific reason, mostly during his sleep, the answer Castiel receives every time is that he recalls his mistakes.
he knows in this way he will be
His boy.
I will never stop saving you.
.  I was able to hear his curse words due to  his stupidity of not having taken his crutches. He kept cursing and spitting words I wasn't able to fully grasp.
Just tell us what happened in the end!
It's so tragic that our love ended so soon in this horrible and sorrowful way. I still can't get over the fact we split up. But our story, is really beautiful. Steeped in his goofiness and mine. But the way we fell down is almost poetic.
My anxiety vanished but I kept drowning in his beautiful eyes.
But I'm afraid, I'm afraid, I'm afraid... of losing you, and I don't want this to happen. I'm afraid. And these words might save me. But I need you to whisper them so I can find the way back home.
“Yes?” I asked gently and I smiled to him, he is so happy after days!
‘’Sammy, go,
for him.
Some days later, in the morning, alone again, in the same room, everything reminded of him. When he woke up from the painful sound of the door he noticed the place around him, empty bottles which used to contain alcoholic beverages and crushed-out cigarettes spread all over the place. Books thrown on the floor and scattered pages, the room no longer recognisable, just like him. Weary and exhausted.
He couldn't take it anymore, he was tired, for a moment the though of finishing everything crossed his mind, the thought of putting an end in everything... He couldn't go on anymore, he felt awful. Unconsciously, he sat down, the hot water hitting his back, he was ignoring the pain with his cries. His whole body was shivering, he brought his legs to his chest and stayed there, under the hot water not knowing what he was mourning- his crying lasted so long that the hit water had turned cold. Only then did he realise how long he'd been there and heard Amelia's voice calling his name.
‘’It's not that what I'm scared of…’’ Cas gained the courage to utter not long after.
Nevertheless I'm advising you... Don't.
They deserved the ocean and the sun.
“Yes, you are right... I'm happy too. I can't wait to see him. You are going to love him!! He is really friendly and a unique human being. Also, we are planning to marry him with Lisa after the summer period. Dean said he needed some time to become familiar with her before taking such a huge step...”
Castiel.
You will find the path leading to your own “forever” - You will find the way back home.
Everything.
I didn't make a move, I was motionless— frozen, staring at his peaceful face while his eyes were examining every corner of my face. He gave me a beautiful smile that every woman in the world would kill for. He gently touched my face and my cheeks immediately turned into a deep shade of red. He lips moved closer to mine, he knew what he was doing. He knew that very well. He left a soft kiss on my jaw and moved a few inches away from me. He released another smile, his palm still resting on my cheek.
.’’ Period. He didn't go on, that's why Cas grabbed the opportunity to speak.
He wanted to kiss him so badly, he wanted to hug him and stay together forever. He wanted him, he still want Cas, here, now, with him. And alive.
And even if he never tasted them, he knew that they would be sweet like him. He knew that they would tested honey.
‘’Besides, I'm not planning on leaving you alone.’’ His voice angelic.
‘’At least I made it here, I called Meg to come and have an eye on our father. She's a nurse, you see.’’ Meg is a childhood friend of theirs and she's apparently helping Gabriella with their father. The time he has to say the last goodbye to his father has come and the thought of it is making him suffer.
For they were full of vivid colours.
But first, I'd like to hear how much you love me. How much you need me, how much you want me.
Recalling his father, he almost forgot he was ill. He always sounded happy through the phone calls, filled with confidence he would return to that house. Because he had built it. But he never had the courage to go that small, wooden house on his own.
Maybe another time.
kind witches, full of generosity and clemency, the dragon with it's blaze... the castle located far away in the magic world full of elves, nymphs, fairies, mermaids and let's not forget the Sirens.
And that's what he did.
, ''Just give me a second'' he wipped away his forgotten tears and shoved everything he could somewhere dark. While he was striving to tidy he came across a drawing belonging to Dean. It was him, watering some flowers. And that's how he got lost in his memories again.
Cas loves Dean's lips on his body. He loves every little detail on him. He loves him. Perhaps it's too early to say so yet. But this is what love is like, isn't it? He lack courage to tell Dean he loves him, he fears that...he fears.

He talked about the war in his letters. Sam always gave me his letters to read them, he reported only a few joyful moments with a few men he knew. John never wanted to read his letters. To be informed about whether he was fine or not. Even after the accident, he always refused to read them, even one simple word.
“A terrible one. My head is going to fucking exploded...”
‘’He confessed to me that he stayed with me because his parents had thrown him out of home, for a completely different reason. They caught him doing drugs with a friend of his- just a friend- and he had the audacity to blab that… he had a second affair at the same time as ours. One he met that summer. Also, he told me that I was uninteresting to him, that he hated me f-for loving him... that he just stayed with me because he needed a house and money and that we had good chemistry in bed... When my dad learnt about the doings... he was disappointed in me. Not because I had an affair with him... I lost my home and he only caused arguments... After a few weeks later when I stayed with my father, he announced that he would search for a house for me and stuff... A few a years later, I found my home, here.
He's going to talk, so he feels ready. Besides, there's certainly a reason why he chose not to come back right away when he left, and he chose to spend a few months away from his family alone. He lost a lot. He lost not only a very good friend in the war, but also a part of himself. I know what it's like, not from personal experience though.
‘’I'm not scared to admit it anymore... I've been avoiding to say these words for so long because I thought I'd lose you if I did... but now? Now I'm sure I'll never lose you. And I can go on and on and on saying these words.’’ He confessed again.
‘’I don't know…’’ She replied as a tear ran down her cheek and question was born once again.
No one except for the stars.
.’’ He whispered without looking who entered the room and nuzzled his pillow.
“There's a rain pour outside. He will not have been back by midnight” John sounded frustrated.
Dean used to drink wine when he was my age!’’ He protested while Mary was filling Dean's glass.

It seems like he missed the town a lot. He missed his friends, his family, the places he used to spend his time, he wants to visit them again, relive the emotions, the memories. A slight smile formed in his lips, he probably recalled something.
, they're pure and steeped in magic and love. They offer you a thousand optimistic feelings and delight and in the end, the protagonists always reach their destination.
He opened the back door of the vehicle and picked up a small package. I took notice of his difficulty lifting it and trying to maintain his balance. It was passed midnight already and the sky had yet to stop mourning, its cold tears touching the soil gently. Dean was soaked from head to toe.
‘’About what we have done and what we haven't.
beyond their reach...
‘’Thank you... It's just- it's just that it's been a long time since
. Stuff and several items related to the wedding here and there, calls to forgotten relatives to inform them for the wedding. Dean, on the contrary, is distant from this situation and an "outsider", he is counting on his fiancé and soon-to-be wife.
, he is destroying himself as well because can't see stand seeing the love of his life aching alone. If he is in pain, they are in pain together. If he is to die, they will die together.
“I would love to know how many hours you've spent in my library and you know about my poems which I have left there...”
“Want something?”
It took a long time for Dean to fall asleep only for another damn nightmare to shock him awake. He cried, he cried so much, Cas hadn't seen him cry like this before. He didn't know what to do. He started panicking seeing the person he loves cry in pain, shout in his sleep and recall the cruel memories of the war which were hunting him.
I virtually fell off my chair when I heard him say that. “Th-the old diary is y-yours?”
’’ Mary approved of their plans with a smile.
Now, I believe in phantoms as well. I believe in him. I'm waiting for him. I am waiting for you, my lover. Every night, I wait to see him, I wait to see my loved one for one last goodbye, one last kiss, one last cigarette and one last dance under the night palette.
He didn't find the courage to love someone wholeheartedly. He wasn't
Of course, I care about him, we are family. On the other hand, he didn't seem to mind me, I doubt he heard my question. He is so absorbed into staring at his house, the picturesque vast yard, the flowers, the kiosk...the whole scenery. After a few seconds I noticed his intense emotions were soothed, but his stress still evident.
This story is steeped in pain and mishap.
They loved it unconditionally. They weren't st fault for falling in love with the ocean.
’’ Castiel half-smiled softly at her with the gaze he usually received from her.
‘’Thank you.’’Cas uttered without being certain why he's thanking Dean, it just felt like the right thing to do.
They didn't speak again, Dean just stretched his arm towards Cas and the latter held his hand to infuse him safety. He caressed the skin for his upper hand and left kisses on it, making his smile. He wipped his tears away and tried to go back to sleep.
Without his home. Without his...
A chuckle escaped from his lips and added ‘’And when I saw them I was afraid to approach and you- grabbed one of them and threw it to my face.’’ Both of them burst into laughter in the end.
‘’I want… what I really want is…’’ He hesitated to go on, he was afraid of his own self, that he would say something he shouldn't have.
With these emerald eyes, with which he fell in love over and over again. These eyes he never wanted to see tearing up...

She smiled. ‘’ At last, you made friendships...’’ He just nodded, unable to utter anything.
‘’Please don't cry... don't make it harder for me.’’ Dean's voice sounded even more broken after every word he uttered, the pain only seeing Cas cry.
“I don't—”
Like their love.
Cas is the reason why Dean writes and Dean is the reason why Cas still breaths.
Their redemption.
“But-”
It's been a really long time since I found myself in this unique room. A lot of months have passed, and I have an odd feeling that something has changed, not in this room but in me. I can hardly recall the last time I was here, the memories are blurry and few, as the disappear without saying goodbye and leave me behind. Lonely. With fewer and fewer memories for me to narrate about my life, about my dull and insignificant life. Perhaps this is the only place inside this house where

Dean was afraid.
More specifically, he ignored it. As if he had never heard it before, as if it didn't exist. Cas' agitation was evident. His whole torso was shivering under Dean's touch and vice versa. Under their soft touch, under the texture of their lips, under the manner they touched- basically their entire existence.
‘’Dean... we need to- talk.’’ He stated confidently without second thoughts.
Tears ( so many tears ) had been running down his face for hours. It was a miracle that he hadn't had a car crush yet, not to mention the alcohol in his blood. In all likelihood, Cas was looking after him from wherever he was. He believed that alcohol could quench his pain and grief from his heart and lift the weight he felt, erase he voiced in his head, but he was awfully wrong.
‘’Don't you say anything.’’ He said, shooting daggers at him.
“Keep on glancing at me like tomorrow will never come. Go on, don't hesitate. Keep going and so will I, keep on staring at me until the sun ceases and desists casting its light on the land...”
‘’You got drank with those two boys and came up with the brilliant idea to pee on my plants. Whose fault is it, huh?’’
Eyes like the sky.
As always.
? You'll realise eventually that life isn't so easy and we don't always get what we want. Your brother knows better, if you seek advice, ask him.’’ Mary replied sounding slightly frustrated and pointed at Dean, who was looking at his plate, at the end of her sentence.
They've fallen from the sky quite a lot of times but they have yet to learn their lesson.
he had to calm him down, all he wanted was his sake as he kept on touching him, telling him what he wanted to hear. Helping him forget everything except for him.
‘’You don't have to be sorry, my love, I should do so for leaving you alone.’’ He showed him his precious smile at the end of his sentence.

he stopped abruptly, unable to continue, he didn't have the strength, his
That very moment you create a bond with someone, when you connect with someone to the point you acquire a strong empathy for them, feel their pain or happiness...when you form a bond that can be considered as love and something more, you get lost. Void of any hope. And why?
Above it one of their wedding pictures hanged and beside it there was a small, wooden wardrobe containing all their clothing. Somewhere in between a wooden chair which Castiel's books from university were placed on, from when he used to be a student. And this was their bedroom. It was picturesque and he loved it. Like he loved Amelia.
‘’What? You don't want me to spoil your descent image to this tall guy?’’
He would find his so called

"I'm sorry... I'm sorry for not telling you how much I-How much I- I... I'm sorry for everything-" All of a sudden he stopped to look at the sun, which was still there keeping him company. He let a few more tears escape his eyes.
It is about helpless people in love and cursed poets who are still expecting to meet their signification other once again.
No response.
“No.”
singular number,
‘’No one resembles you on this earth baby, not even a bit. You are distinctive and unique. You are mine and I and I am yours.’’ Stated Dean as he kissed Cas' hand once again, his soft lips matched perfectly on Cas' skin. He loved Dean and every part of him. Every aspect, good or bad. He loved him for who he truly was and not for who he made himself appear to be, but in reality, he was completely different.
The Angels... felt sorry for him.
The young woman with the beautiful blonde hair
She knew one indeed.
‘’Nice to meet you... Guess I'll see you around, don't you be a stranger. Shall we go, Cas-Castiel? The doctor's gonna leave soon.’’ Dean asked Cas seemingly in a hurry. The latter remained silent for a second not knowing what his next move should be. He had missed his sister but on the other hand Dean need him.
our saviour.
He closed his eyes trying to keep his tears but he couldn't. He couldn't. "Cas, can you hear me?" He uttered, his voice unstable and tears running down his exhausted eyes, soaking his features. He turned his head right and left, hoping he would see Cas, but no one was there. No one apart from him.
I'll always be saving you.
They started heading to the doctor's office, they passed through a calm alley without many people around. Plain picturesque stone houses were located next to each other. Some kids were running in excitement towards the beach, silence once again. Castiel had to end whatever that was going on between them. For his sake, for their sake. He can't even imagine what is bound to happen if he doesn't-
I'm starting to process the offer he made to me a few moments ago. I was ready to continue but I stopped for another time. I attempted to encourage myself to keep going. I have never smoked in my entire life, even though I was given quite many opportunities to do so in the past. I don't know if this is right...to share the same cigarette.
A story involving
Perhaps he just refused to accept that he was on the way to scatter the ashes of his lover.
And alone again.
That night, they we're smoking once again a couple if cigarettes for hours and Dean was reading some of his poems to Cas. As many as he wanted, that is. Cas had caught Dean writing countless times. But the latter wouldn't show him anything. Not even a word.
I'll be waiting for you.
, his eyes fixed on Cas.
Cas was on the verge of falling asleep on the chair. He was visibly tired. ‘’You can leave if you want to, you don't have to-’’
‘’Yes.’’

That he may be five new the chance to live a life with the person he loves, but his traumas outnumbered his hopes and those sneaky traumas started straggling him, eating him out, the traumas turned into voices. They turned into his worst nightmares.
“I don't feel like eating anything right now, I don't know about you.” He started and threw his upper body on the table to rest once again, but this time with slightly more force as I noticed. He accidentally hit his head on the wooden table... I let out an unintentional snigger when he complained intensely.
For they are in love, the cursed poets who still hope.
‘’Do you mean it?’’ He asked cowardly, his smile fixed.
‘’Then too bad.’’ He whispered and averted his gaze, admiring the sea once again, but at least he was ensured that Dean loved him.
“Nothing.”
‘’I know,
He shut his eyes, trying to make use of all the persistence left in him so as not to cry, not yield, not to let this overwhelming urge to cry take over or do something worse. His jaw was trebling and so did his hands. ‘’Tonight. End it. He said he would stay to his family home until the wedding. If you want the best for him, do as I say.’’
‘’It's better in the morning, I guess.’’
He was worried, really worried, I could feel his anxiety and his negative thoughts. He believed that his brother was dead. His real brother, he understood Dean's decision to stay away from his family a few months more before he would come back from the war, he needed time.
‘’Castiel?’’ Sam's wakeful voice was heard from across the halkway.
But if you're eager to know what happened in this cursed story...
“Chill out, Castiel, there's no problem. It was my fault for leaving my staff there. Little did I know that my cousin's husband would spend time in my place.”
He didn't have to hear him say so so as to make certain that Cas loves him. He already knows, he can clearly see it through that dull and plain look. And let's not forget that a small and plain ‘’I love you’’ can't express nor cover their love as many I love you's as they utter they won't be enough.
‘’Why not’’ he replied and gladly received the ciggarete, placing it between his index and muddle finger and inhaling it, the same cigarette which Dean's lips touched.
Grief.
Cas wasn't sure about Dean's feelings as he was for his own, he wasn't sure if his heartbeat was as fast as his own when they were together but he was sure that he felt something. He knew he meant a lot to Dean and he knew his personality, how hard it was to start a conversation with him.
lives in. A house for the family they would create-
A few minutes later, he reached to his destination, far from the world. Far from everything.
Castiel's gaze travelled to the golden Sun, setting behind the sea. It was hiding into the aquatic sheets and played and hide and seek with the mortal. And they searched for it across the vast world. Yet Castiel didn't run to seek it. The only thing he had to do was turn his gaze to Dean.
said without wasting time, immediately Mary stood up and went over her seat to hug her. Amelia started tearing up due to her overwhelming ecstasy.
Also, he used to say that, “And as the first drops of summer rain touched the ground, something really angelic happened— ” I stopped him.
‘’I know’’ He said slowly.
He grinned at him and lifted his eyebrows with meaning. ‘’Castiel, say something,
This is a tragic love story, the ending of which will break you or even haunt your existence until the ultimate days of your life.
I'll be waiting for you, my love.
ong since the first day Castiel felt alive –
I'm certain I'm exaggerating.
I love you too.
Maybe this is why they're falling constantly, for they are not brave enough to put into words how much they love each other.
Back to you.
He smiled kindly as he kept his eyes on the road. Dean was observing the woods and the meadows trough the car window, on the verge of drifting into a peaceful sleep. The sun had already set.
‘’And I'm going to work at a nearby shop part-time. We also have the money my parents passed down to me... after their death. Castiel's sister will help us as much as she can too.’’
He can't believe he is that kind of person. He can't believe he's taken seriously what they have. He doesn't believe Dean is thinking about him frequently, perhaps every day. He doesn't believe...maybe he doesn't want to believe that Dean thinks and cares about him. Because then they would be lost. The truth is they have already been lost for a long time now.
He is by himself, gazing at a meadow full of plain and beautiful flowers. He knew Cas would admire this place with his whole immortal heart which stopped beating unexpectedly. He knew Cas.
“I know you don't need my forced kindness as you called it, but you know what? My life, my choice. I choose whether I want to be nice or not. It would be so much easier if I were a dick like you are.” I said, this time full of anger.
fault, not hers, all she wants for him is be safe and sound, if everything is alright, if he is alright.
I just wanted him to be safe. Even if I don't know him yet, even if I barely know him. I feel like I had to do this, not only to open only one simple door. But to be so protective.
“No, I'm ok with it.” I said calmly and grinned. He didn't see my smile and I'm dead sure about that. Had he seen it, he would've definitely commented on it.
‘’Why?’’
Silence fell at the table once again. No one attempted to start a conversation, until some asked one more question.
‘’Cas,
placed her hand on the wooden door, preventing him from doing so. He looked at her in a manner which revealed he wanted to be left alone but she ignored him, she's concerned about him and she is right.
A kiosk was standing tall at the end of the yard, under which Mary told John that she was pregnant to Dean, to my knowledge. The vicious forest was visible beyond the yard, a beautiful mystery. I've never been afforded the opportunity to explore it. I have only followed a path which led me to a narrow lake. Prior to this lake lies a hill full of life, steeped in various kinds of wildflowers, butterflies and bees wandering from one corner to the other. And then you come across the exquisite mansion of the family. Covered in white, accompanied by a variety of flowers. Maybe my manner of illustrating this paradise is an understatement.
I will always protect you,
He continued his sentence smiling widely to Dean before wrapping his arms around him and bringing him into an unexpected hug, it was one if those you didn't want to end, which make you feel secure.
‘’He's- Amelia's cousin...’’
happy ending.
The kids averted their attention from him to their mother again.
His lips formed a smile before he opened them. “Wow, easy, tiger.” I rolled my eyes before I wrapped his arm around my waist while holding his crutches with the other and so did I. I was able to sense the hotness of his body, which meant he might have had a fever.
They were from the fortunate ones. They had more than two or three chances. But they were too fainthearted to admit their feelings.
be found in the plainest
No, they aren't. They are innocent. Their hearts are too pure to suffer such a huge amount of pain.
Why does Castiel's heart shatter in pieces every time he comes across the person he loves? Why do rivers of tears escape his glaucous eyes and turn into streams on his cheeks? Why does he make a mountain out of a molehill?
Hades is with Persephone, he won't come for us.
Dean nudged him and signaled him to come closer to whisper something to him.
“Yeah maybe...”
His eyes.
He reassured him of his presence cupping his face. Dean was shivering and Cas whispered to him
much. The weight he feels every time he looks at him and deep down he knows- he knows very well that he is not and will never be his, it makes him want to scream. Scream how much he loves him.
They started preparing the table. Amelia was also there, her ecstatic expression was hard not to be noticed. Dean was teasing Sam about Jessica and Marry was narrating stories about Dean when he was a kid. Cas was feeling free. He enjoyed the night for the time being.
He rubbed his face with his hands to make himself to regain consciousness and follow the flow of the day ahead. He looked out of the window, the spring blossoms were now gone. The tree house was painted green. Then he averted his eyes from outside to the big clock which was placed a little away from him.
My feelings vanished, they've been buried, and they keep drowning and dying slowly as my eyes take a glimpse of an unfamiliar image. Where did my haven go? Why did it vanish? It used to be so lovely a room that I fell in love with it by first sight. The feeling I received when my hand unfolded every single dusted page of the old books or that night when I happened to fall asleep on the small armchair for I had stayed up late reading a random novel from the enormous, in my own eyes, library.
The memory, the memory, the memory.
“Don't be.” He uttered with a sad deep tone.
‘’What I truly want, right?’’
A few seconds later I noticed a boy with soaking wet blonde hair in an old military uniform coming out.
“You don't even know me...” His eyes display to full confusion. I froze again. I couldn't speak or thought something, I felt unable to breath. His emerald green eyes affect me so fucking much.
This moment belongs to Cas and him.
As Lisa started walking away, Castiel managed to catch her last words, ‘’Dean doesn't deserve your love.
“Father wanted me to go to war... to 'discipline' me. I didn't go for him though. I did it mostly for my mother. I developed some friendships there but unfortunately most of them lost their lives. I wasn't eager to return immediately. I was dead. I rented and apartment and worked on a daily basis to make ends meet, despite my wound. It's gotten better now.” He paused and breathed in a gust of smoke once again. He had opened the car window slightly in order to throw the ashes out. He didn't ask me first, not that I would answer no to him. I wasn't able to do this, in spite of being cold. He turned his head towards me with a faint smile.
“I'm sorry...”
Under a beautiful sunset, a hurt, a broken and a lost man in love is mourning for the death of his soulmate, the death of his world, he's kissing goodbye his other half and remains half.
“Mr. Winchester!” I raised the tone of my voice this time. He averted his seemingly exhausted gaze to me with an expression full of confusion. I haven't talked for at least an hour; I was lost in my thoughts. I was thinking... Thinking about the boy who was supposed to come over today.
time.’’ She uttered happily, he nodded. Amelia had a miscarriage in the past, she won't be able to take in so much pain again. She won't take it. She will collapse.
“Good” I lied, and he let out a weak laugh. Oh, my Lord, he has such a beautiful and special laugh for someone I just met.
“Don't mention it” I answered immediately. What I really wanted to say deep inside is that I'd move heaven and earth for his sake... But I didn't say so. It's too early for promises and dreams.
"You can't be gone, man..No, no, no, you can't- Crowley is dead, Kelly is dead. Probably- probably mom and this bastard is dead... But, not you."
Yes, boy. For in his own eyes he is still the youngster he met years ago. That boy who changed his lifeet radically. He's still the boy with the wide, generous smile.
‘’I'm not.’’ He denied with a smile and kept his eyes on
‘’What did she do?’’ Mary and Sam asked in unison.
He was alone.
“It's too late kids. Let's leave it for another day, shall we? I have loads of work tomorrow. When I return home on a week I'll tell you a lot of stories” She had work to do indeed, she would travel to the past, to the house with the beautiful garden. She would throw a visit to the house she grew up in after so many years.
Like those phantoms which taught us to be afraid from an early age. All the phantoms return at night, just like he did. He came back with the moonlight and not the sunlight. All the phantoms have a tragic background, just like him. And I've been told to be afraid of the phantoms...
Him and grief are like best friends. Because he knows everything, he feels everything and everyone died. Every person he ever loved or cared is dead or gone or alive but broken. Really broken. And it is truth, my friend, everyone he loves died. Every single person - including his own self. If he ever loved himself.
. And you are?’’
And, God- The ocean. So long and, and... There's no words to describe the ocean. Same with Cas. Maybe, Cas is, maybe Cas is...The Ocean. He is lost in the sea. Lost in him.
But grief...
And don't be afraid. Don't... You needn't feel fear. You will manage to find a way to return home, to your Ithaca, to the love of your life.
That was when I understood I was already lost.
Every word,
‘’A couple of years ago, you know... I had just finished high school, I had my first serious relationship, if you can call it that.’’ He started speaking, she smiled at him as a motivation to go on, she adored him speaking. Castiel had a flaw or sort of gift of making extended speeches. It helped people get away, something he's trying to do to himself right now.
‘’Maybe...maybe yes…’’ he said timidly and lowered his head. He noticed him with his peripheral eyesight, so handsome, with quick movements he put out his cigarette and approapproached him again, he took a glance of his surroundings and with his thumb and point finger he lifted his jaw and locked eyes with him.
Sam's cheeks became scarlet red
touching.
Without her.
For the first time in his life he has time available to talk about his traumas, his emotional heaviness. For Firth first rime in his life he's not running away from them. But he will confront them and even win this battle.
, aren't you?’’ He tried to hide the disappointment in his voice but it was impossible. Dean. Oh this poor young man, he didn't want lose Cas so early.
“Don't worry, he will come, maybe something came up to him..” I said, even though I am aware of the fact that Mary left my side a few moments earlier. Perhaps I should get going as well. Besides it's getting dark I thought. Before I open the door, I let my eyes travel the whole garden.
Shit.
They knew. They already knew their relationship was cursed, just like them. They knew they wouldn't live the way the desired in the future, but they were eager to do everything to acquire it. They'd do their best to end up and live together.
a chance for us, for the cursed poets.
I'm waiting for your hologram – come here and dance with me. Eventually, we will meet again. We're going to experience what we weren't given the chance to experience. I'll tell you what I didn't tell you.
Dean leaned closer to Cas and kissed his cheeck again, a kiss which instilled faith and confidence in Cas, such as the following words; ‘’Who told you I was going to leave you,
“Please... Dean... I can't let you—I... You are wounded... I can't—Dean—I can't do this...I need to help you, no matter what you are saying” I insisted which make him roll his eyes - again - and eventually give in.
But Dean didn't know. No, he didn't. But Dean never asked. He never asked Cas if he feels anything about him. Like, romantic love. He was scared. So, so fucking scared. He was scared of losing him. But after all, it turns out he lost him. Forever. And forever is a long time for someone in love.
of their love.]
Amelia stopped him, she brought him into a tender hug, Castiel felt lucky that Amelia cared about him. He just got lost into her embrace, the last person who hugged him was Dean and he misses it, just as him. ‘’You'd better get dressed, we didn't want you to go down with the flue, alright?’’
In all likelihood he recalled something unpleasant, judging from his facial expression.“He is going to take advantage of the storm and use it as a justification to excuse himself and stay with his friends. Oh, Lord! What have I done to deserve all of this? If he starts seeing that guy again-” Marry interrupted his load thoughts.
It's mid-June, the scorching hot weather is
Cas interrupted him ‘’Yes, you wouldn't do it because I'm a noth-’’
Castiel and Amelia were lying in their bed. The soft yellowish light coming from a small light bulb kept them company and the cool breeze entering the room from the slightly opened window caressed their cheekbones.
His name will be the last word that will shine from my lips before I leave – before I say goodbye to him and before I see that light that everyone says that when you die, after all, I'll see it? Will I see the light? I'll get to the other side or stay here forever as a ghost – and if I stay, I know what I'm going to do, I'll look for him, I'll look for him until I find him again. I will find you again my lost lover – because that's what soulmates do.
“Yeah... Maybe... ” He said nervously. I kissed him again, oh, my Lord, I will never be bored kissing his lips.
and emptiness.
When this phrase entered my ears, my face changed a thousand shades within seconds. He just smiled again. I moved backwards as fast as I could trying not to look upset.
Cas placed a delicate kiss on his head and then one on his forehead, still holding his close.
Silence fell all of a sudden, Sam had still some salad in his mouth as he stared at Amelia with wide open eyes anticipating her next words. She took Castiel's hand in hers. His smile vanished. Like he knew.
‘’We just- just...’’ he closed his eyes for a second trying to process his thoughts and started speaking again. ‘’We spend quality time together. We're just friends.’’So many months and he never asked Dean what they were. He thought and still thinks that Dean doesn't care. That everything they have is a lie. A dream of those you want to experience again and never forget.
I said panicky- stricken. I have spent endless hours in that library indeed, I have read that diary infinite times... I didn't even think it might have been his, it didn't have a name on it. It had absolutely nothing, it was like it didn't belong to anyone and my heart rendered it mine.
“I finally found you!” Amelia exclaimed as she placed a kiss on my cheek. My wife. We have been married for almost a year. She is part of the family. I really care about her and I feel close to her. She means a lot to me. But... I cannot say that I'm in love with her.
maybe dawn as well, either sober or drunk, emitting the smell of cigarettes and perfume.
His beautiful eyes...
Regarding Cas, His and Amelia's house is ready. They're just staying here for the summer. And for him. To stay close to him. At least for a short period of time.
‘’Of course I do, now that we're talking about secrets... I may have one I want to tell you as well.’’
Saying the final goodbye.
‘’Finally! Long time no see!’’ She exclaimed with excitement. A handful of tears of happiness were on her rosy cheeks. He was on the verge of forgetting what her voice sounded like. Really, it had been a long time since he last saw his beloved sister.
I want to feel like I am
Mary brought a bottle of wine and served everyone except for Sam who was still a minor.
He stopped examining his surroundings in search of a change. I thought that he had finally decided to enter the house, they were surely waiting for us to arrive. The night grew cold, my body was shivering. The car was not warm at all inside and the fact that it was raining exacerbated the situation for me.
A beautiful story, like a novel.
Maybe this is the lesson.
‘’Everything alright?’’ She asked worried, a trace of sorrow engraved on his face. ‘’Yes- yes everything's perfect... It's just... Nevermind, forgive and forget.’’ After the end of his sentence he smiled slightly.
“I- I'm not feeling sorry- sorry for you...”
‘’You're
‘’My sister.’’ Castiel said before her and she grinned in agreement. ‘’What he said.’’
''Do you have an idea of how annoying and childish is what you're doing right now?'' Dean whispered trying to make his voice sound serious and strict but the little smile threatening to be shaped betrayed him. Cas smirked secretly.
Dean wiped his neck and left kisses on Cas' collarbone-
He, as person hopelessly in love, smiled in the memory, a night when they were discussing about everything under the sun for hours until dusk, until the first ray of the sun was casted upom their naked bodies, together, the night he found that drawing.
“Dean you are finally home.” I said as keep my look to the road.
‘’I don't care! It doesn't make any sense, why can't I live my life with the girl that I...’’
They were about to stand up when Castiel noticed a familiar figure from afar. It was Dean. He had difdiculty walking down the slope with his crutches. He greeted an old man with round, brown glasses while the latter entered his shop again. It was possibly Bobby, he thought. His heartbeat quickened when he saw him. He tucked a bill on the table and they walked to his place.
She asked with curiosity and tucked a strand of hair behind her ear, a deed followed by a sip of her coffee. They hadn't talked much the last months and he never mentioned him. He was afraid that he would accidentally reveal something.
Said the emerald-eyed to the young blue-eyed man. Dean's lips formed into a broken smile and leaned down to kiss Cas' lips. A slow kiss which seemed to last centuries for them. Maybe only in their own eyes eternal life is a beautiful and pure thing. The truth is, everything seems pure as long as they are togethe. And this is what they fear, that the moment they split may come earlier than expected, and they're not ready.
‘’But what Dean?’’ Amelia added as she slightly pushed her glass of wine away.
Sorrow
Another broken eye contact, Dean said something which might be right. Maybe. ‘’Besides,...’’ he initiated his sentence with a glimmer of hope,
Tears were still coming out of his glaucous eyes, but more than a few seconds ago, which caused Dean to tear up as well.
