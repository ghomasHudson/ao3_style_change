“I did, yes.” He tried to ignore the bile rising in his throat. It wasn’t fair to Sherlock for him to act like this.
“Come on, Mary.” John’s voice was also close to breaking. Sherlock took another step back. John kept repeating her name, as if he couldn’t do anything else. He couldn’t.
Hand in hand, they set off down the path, pausing only to throw out their containers. John’s hand fit perfectly in his. The height difference wasn’t even as bad as Sherlock was worried it would be. Sherlock made sure they went in the opposite direction as the aquarium, just to ensure that they definitely would not see it. That would ruin what was otherwise a fantastic date.
John chuckled. “True.” He took a sip of wine. Sherlock had had most of his glass already. “So. When?”
John shook his head violently. “You don’t understand. I am. I am. I’m exactly like him. I hurt the people I care about, I hurt you.” He ground his fist into the arm of the chair. “Every time I look in the mirror, I see him. I see you lying on the ground. I see my fists, bloodied and bruised. I see him, staring at me with that hatred in his eyes. And I imagine that look in my own face, and I can’t. I can’t do this, Sherlock. I can’t sit here and see you.” A tear trickled down his cheek. He glared at his hand. Sherlock’s heart broke. He sucked in a shaky breath.
“I don’t care. Your first reaction wasn’t to say, ‘Oh, Sherlock, I’m so glad to see you.’ No, your first reaction was to throw me to the ground. That seems to be a common reaction for you. I get high on drugs and show up asking for help, you throw me to the ground. Forgive me if I can’t seem to move on quite yet. I try and do everything in my power to keep you happy and safe. You don’t take any notice of it.” Another headache was starting to form. He angrily rubbed at his temples. “It seems like you only want me around when it’s convenient for you. Your wife shot me and you went back to her.”
Some upbeat song was playing. John and Sherlock were taking a break from the dancing - god, there was so much dancing, not that he was complaining - when Harry and Clara walked up. Harry was holding Rosie and beaming, and Clara had her arm around Harry. Sherlock was relieved. Their relationship was going strong. Harry hadn’t drank anymore, hadn’t even drank champagne during the reception.
Back at the flat later that evening, Sherlock helped John unpack everything. Rosie’s clothes went in John’s old drawers upstairs. Everything of John’s was put in Sherlock’s-actually, in
Sherlock scrutinised the 23 April. That was today. Today was John’s birthday. And John had failed to mention it. Sherlock opened his eyes and frowned.
He had dismissed it as something said in the heat of the moment, but perhaps there was some truth to it. After all, he was currently with Sherlock and not her.
“Culverton Smith,” Lestrade said, grimly. “Although, really, I caught him.” Sherlock was too tired to argue.
The flat was cold, no fire had been lit. He sat down on the couch, lighting a cigarette. The entire flat would probably smell of smoke later, but that was the least of his worries. He closed his eyes, entering his Mind Palace. And he waited.
The figure chuckled. “So we meet again, Mr. Holmes.” Icy fear ran through Sherlock’s veins. He subconsciously brought his hands to his neck. “Is it a comfortable bed? I tried to get the best for my patients.”
Sherlock stepped inside, shivering slightly. It was cold out, colder than he’d originally thought. He was glad he’d brought his coat.
She gripped his dressing gown and gazed up at him with wide eyes. She wasn’t crying. That was something, Sherlock supposed. It wouldn’t be good if John came back to his daughter crying in Sherlock’s arms. “I got you a present,” Sherlock continued. “To be honest, I don’t know what to get for babies. And now I’m talking to you. Great. You can’t even respond.” The tone of his voice was fond. Rosie beamed up at him. Sherlock decided right then that he liked Rosie. He hoped that John would bring her over more often.
Sherlock slid his glove back on and followed her into the sitting room. It was cosy, sunlight filtering through the windows. Worn furniture, pictures on the wall. The mom and daughter with a dog.
The drizzle fell gently on his face. He tipped his face towards the sky, relishing in the feeling of the cool rain. It was messing up his curls, yes, but it wasn’t strong enough to do any damage. He hoped John hadn’t forgotten, or worse, cancelled on him without telling him. Sherlock didn’t think John would do that, but John was unpredictable. He’d done much worse.
“Can’t what?” Sherlock’s eyes widened and his heart beat a little faster. Typical symptoms of anxiety. His palms started to sweat. Fear, nervousness, or perhaps withdrawal.
“Please, Sherlock. Shut up.” He was secretly very pleased that Sherlock was criticizing the movie. They made it through most of it until the end.
“He’s drunk,” said Wiggins from behind him. Sherlock opened his mouth to protest, but then realised that assault of an officer while drunk would allow for lesser charges than assault of an officer while on cocaine.
“Okay, then. Here we go.” John tangled his fingers in his jumper. “I try so hard every day not to be like him. Sometimes I just-I get so
“So,” John said, after they had finished. “Plans for today? Got any cases?” He looked at Sherlock expectantly.
“Looks good,” Sherlock said. “The table’s sterile, so are the plates and silverware. I did it before you came. Mrs. Hudson insisted on double-checking too, in case you were worried.”
want to get high, and the cravings were nearly unbearable, but he wouldn’t. He wouldn’t. Not now. Not with John finally back. “Or I can come in with you,” he added, and John relaxed.
Sherlock cracked an eye open. John raised his head up and propped his chin on his elbow to look at Sherlock. “Sleep well?” He asked, attempting to keep his voice steady.
“He does,” Sherlock said, shaking his head. “You weren’t there. You didn’t see the way he looked at me.”
The door to the flat opened again. Sherlock whipped his head around. Lights danced in front of his eyes, and he blinked to clear them away. “John?”
“I forgot you were here.” Sherlock raced up the first stairs he could see, bursting out onto the rooftop. Sunlight glinted off the windows nearby and he squinted. His stomach twisted and then dropped. He recognised the feeling, recognised the first signs of withdrawal. He turned away from the body on the ground and pulled the syringe out of his pocket.
Sherlock effectively shut him up by ducking his head and touching his lips to John’s. His hands came up to cup John’s cheeks. His lips were warm and soft. Their noses bumped a few times before they finally figured out the placement. John trailed his hand up to Sherlock’s hair, and he dimly registered how nice it felt to tangle his fingers in his curls before he stopped thinking altogether.
Sherlock was bent back over the toilet, because apparently even though he hadn’t actually eaten anything his stomach was trying to destroy itself. “Are you okay?”
Lack of attraction does not mean that I can’t feel pleasure or even enjoy sex. It simply means I don’t feel attraction. Some people, asexual or otherwise, are sex repulsed. I am not one of those people.”
Sherlock knew that he was relatively quiet the next morning. He couldn’t bring himself to tell John to stay, and what else was there to talk about? His stomach was hollow. The pain in his heart pierced the thick fog in his head, but not much else did. John was also quiet. He made them breakfast like he usually did, but he was just going through the motions. Sherlock barely ate it and only sipped at his tea. He didn’t think the violin would help, so he didn’t play.
Of course it was. He felt so terribly guilty for not telling John. He hated those two years, hated every second of them. And then he’d come back, and everything was different. John was getting married, and then they kept fighting. John didn’t need Sherlock anymore. But Sherlock still needed John. Sherlock always needed John.
Back in his room, Sherlock sat down at the small desk. His bandages were replaced. Someone, somehow, had managed to procure new ones for him. A piece of paper and a crayon had been placed on the desk. He stared at them for a while, trying to erase the cravings. It wasn’t working. He needed cocaine, needed it like he needed to breathe. It was all he could do to stare at the paper and not
John shook his head. “No, a different woman. Her name’s Julia. Anyways. I’m working on my anger issues. I’ll never forgive myself for what I did to you.”
John sighed and settled down in his chair to wait. It was only about one, and his stomach protested at the lack of breakfast and lunch. He stumbled to his feet and managed to make a cup of tea. He pulled out a loaf of bread from the cupboard, and opened the fridge to find something to make a sandwich out of.
A cry from Rosie interrupted them after some time. John flinched. Sherlock immediately sat up and slid off of John. He discreetly wiped at his face with his hand. Not that it mattered, of course. John had seen him break down.
After that, Sherlock turned back to drugs. Cocaine, morphine. He had been desperate for relief, desperate for a break. Cocaine wiped his mind clean, made him forget about John for some time. Until he came down from his high. He cried after every use now, always, shaking and wondering what he did wrong. Why he felt like this. Why John would never feel the same way. The only clear solution Sherlock found was to extend the times that he was high. John never called him. Nobody else bothered to check on him, so what did it matter if he was high all the time? Yes, there was Janine, who distracted him for a while. The only issue was that when she left, he didn’t have John. Drugs helped. They were the only things he could count on in his life.
He didn’t think John would follow him. In fact, he knew John wouldn’t. Not until the morning. It would not be very smart of him if John found him drunk, or high. Sherlock ached for the obliviousness of cocaine. He would stay strong. John would not find him in a drug den again. The disappointment in his eyes was enough once, he didn’t need that again.
has John's birthday in April. I honestly don't know when it is, but since I'm the author I'm making his birthday in April.
John almost dropped the teacups for the second time. His heart leapt in his throat. “You promised,” he growled, forgetting that he shouldn’t be angry.
Sherlock sat up. “If I don’t respond, it should be fairly obvious that I don’t want to talk to you.”
Sherlock tightened his grip on John’s hand. “I need you.” It was the most honest he’d allowed himself to be in a long time, and it was absolutely true.
“I’m sorry. I think I have to. I mean, I still rent out the flat and right now, I’m far from my work. I also don’t want to impose on you any more than I have.” You’re not an imposition, Sherlock wanted to yell at him, but his voice remained stubbornly silent. John allowed the silence for a few minutes before starting to speak again. “Tomorrow would be best, probably, since it’s a Sunday and I have work on Monday.”
John opened his mouth as if to say something. Instead he said nothing. John nodded and disappeared upstairs without another word, leaving Sherlock alone in his chair.
“Amazing,” John finished. He kissed the tip of Sherlock’s nose, loving the way he smiled shyly and blushed.
“London?” Wiggins must have confirmed this, because the officer said, “I’ll call NSY and have them send someone to meet us there.”
He was dragged out of his reverie by a hand on his shoulder. Mycroft. “What do you want?” Sherlock’s voice was low and harsh. His throat burned from the vomit.
Sherlock read it through once, his heart pounding. Then a second time. It didn’t seem real. He read it again. The words sunk into his brain, ripping him apart. Everything inside him screamed in pain. His breath came faster. The cab ride took ages and yet wasn’t long enough. He numbly paid the cabbie. He made it up the stairs before the first tear fell. He took the note, laid it open and pinned it to the mantelpiece. The knife stuck straight up. He was sure to avoid any of the words. It couldn’t be real. John wouldn’t-John wouldn’t say it was over just like that. As if the past years meant nothing.
“To know if you’re okay.” Sherlock laughed. John went to slip his phone back into his pocket but saw the time and stopped. “Christ, Sherlock, it’s past midnight!”
“Yes, Sherlock?” He looked back at Sherlock. He was standing in the kitchen, having traded his suit jacket for a dressing gown. He still had on his button-up shirt and trousers.
“This conversation is getting nowhere,” Sherlock announced. He stood up, or rather attempted to. His head spun and he was forced to sit back down. Mycroft waited.
“I am to blame,” Sherlock said. “But that’s not the point. This isn’t punishment.” Though in a way it was, he supposed. The euphoric high that gave way to crushing lows. John was speaking to him, but when he came down it wasn’t real. The brief escape from reality that only hurt him more afterwards.
“Not at all.” John laid down until he could rest Sherlock’s head on his chest. It rose and fell with his breaths.
Sherlock shook his head vehemently. He needed to tell John, John had a right to know why Sherlock was so obviously rejecting him, but he simply couldn’t work up the courage.
The sharp edge he had been feeling for the past years was gradually lessening. John was here. John loved him. It was almost too much to process. After the confession, he didn’t want a kiss. Later, but not then. Safety and comfort came first.
They made as much eye contact as possible in the darkness, which wasn’t much. Sherlock thought it was infuriating. He was unable to read John like this. He couldn’t tell if John still thought he meant platonically, though John would have to be blind to think Sherlock meant it platonically, or if he finally understood. Saying he wouldn’t leave platonically was one thing, but saying he wouldn’t leave regardless of if Sherlock had romantic feelings towards him was another.
“I didn’t,” Sherlock begged. “Please. You must believe me.” The nurse shrugged and pulled the blankets up over Sherlock’s knees.
Sherlock choked on the next inhalation of smoke and glared at his cigarette. The rain was beginning to seep through his coat, dampening his shoulders. He shivered. He couldn’t bring himself to care. Checking his mobile, he saw that he had a little less than an hour’s walk left. He sighed and took another drag.
The rest of the day passed too quickly and yet too slowly for Sherlock’s liking. He was nervous, but excited, for the dinner. He and John were mostly back to normal. He had yet to receive an apology, but maybe with time. Even though he was growing less hopeful each day about that. There was an undercurrent of uncomfort every time they were alone, and Sherlock strongly suspected that was why John insisted on bringing Rosie everywhere with them.
“It’s not a choice, Sherlock,” she said firmly. “You told me once that England would fall if I left Baker Street. Well, England is certainly falling with you holed up in this flat.” Tears pricked at his eyelids after she said that, but he wasn’t sure why. “Now, get off your couch and come play Cluedo with me.”
Sherlock sat upright in bed. His blankets were all around him, some thrown to the floor. His pyjamas were soaked through with sweat, his eyes wide in the dark. His heart was beating irrationally fast. Just a dream. It was just a dream. A deep, gripping fear overcame him. It might not be a dream. It might be real. John didn’t have to go to the funeral anymore. He didn’t have any obligations other than Rosie, and Rosie was a reminder of Mary. John had a past with suicidal intentions. Now, he’d not only had his friend jump off a roof in front of him, but his wife died as well. Of course it would be too much for anyone to bear.
Archie came up to stand next to Mycroft, tugging at his sleeve. Sherlock didn’t miss the slight nod Mycroft gave him.
He reached up and pressed the hand that wasn’t holding the cigarette to his head, tangling his fingers in his hair. It hurt. He relished the pain. He deserved the pain.
“He wasn’t invited,” John interrupted. His voice cut Sherlock to the bone. Suddenly, he didn’t want to hear anything else. The room had turned stifling, hot and uncomfortable. He turned and left.
There was a warm weight against his chest when he woke up the next morning. He felt constricted and nearly panicked before remembering the events of last night. And then he did panic, just for a second. What if John regretted it? What if John thought it was awkward? Sherlock certainly didn’t regret it. He was warm and content now. John was still asleep. His head was resting on Sherlock’s shoulder, his arm loosely flung around his stomach.
“No.” John pressed his lips together. “You’re not a coward. I can’t believe that I never noticed. How much you cared. How much power I had to-to break you.”
“You sure you want to be here?” Sherlock jumped at the familiar voice. No. No. He couldn’t be here, not right now. He couldn’t see Sherlock, not like this. A hand roughly grabbed his shoulder and spun him around. Dark blue eyes met his. His face was contorted, scowling. Angry.
An hour before the date, Sherlock paced around the room. He’d kicked John out, making sure John had his clothes before getting extremely nervous. He’d never really had a proper date before, unless you counted Victor from uni, which Sherlock refused to. Not one that both people were certain was actually a date.
A firm hand on his arm brought him back to the present. Wiggins was leaning over him, whispering something. “What?” Sherlock snapped.
Sherlock closed his eyes, Wiggins’s footsteps echoing down the stairs. He slipped back into unconsciousness.
“No.” John cleared his throat and took Sherlock’s hands. Sherlock intertwined their fingers together. “I understand. I do. I just don’t like it, because I cared about you immensely, and then you were gone.”
“Do you want to stay?” The words left Sherlock’s mouth in a rush. Maybe his proposition was too sudden. He didn’t know the length of time one had to be romantically engaged (
Sherlock didn’t say anything. He just kept looking at the body. It was John, and yet not. John’s skin was much paler than usual, already starting to retract. Dehydration.
“Mary.” She stopped breathing, stopped moving, stopped talking. Stopped living. John put his arm around her and rested his chin on top of her head, looking straight ahead. Seeing but not seeing. He eased his head down, pressed it against hers. Held on tightly.
“Get out,” Anthea told him. John sighed, stepping out of the car. Making his way up to the front steps, he tried to calm his stomach. It was just Sherlock. He had seen Sherlock so many times.
The sun gradually set and dipped below the horizon. Across the water, lights flickered on in the buildings. When they passed a bridge, Sherlock saw the lights from cars. He privately thought that none of those people were as lucky as he was. He was incredibly lucky. John was with him. John wasn’t alone in his flat. John wasn’t with Mary. John wasn’t drinking alcohol in some pub. John was here, with him, and he was happy.
“I know,” she said. “I’m here if you change your mind, though.” With that she took her hand off his shoulder and faced the door.
Jody Dobrowski was beaten to death by two men who thought he was gay. His body was so badly disfigured that he had to be identified by fingerprints. Both men had attacked another man for being gay before this. He died 15 October 2005.
“Fine,” Mycroft said. “We are gathered here today to witness and celebrate the union of William Sherlock Scott Holmes and John Hamish Watson in marriage.” John smirked at him.
John pulled back to look at him. A smile spread across his face. His eyes were still slightly teary and he had dark circles underneath them, but it was the most beautiful smile Sherlock had ever seen. “I would like that very much.”
Sherlock and John eyed each other. Rosie was in John’s arms, her wide blue eyes blinking at Sherlock. “Hello, Rosie,” he said, his voice unsteady. Rosie babbled back at him. A ghost of a smile flitted across John’s face, but Sherlock was certain it was about Rosie and not him. John wouldn’t even meet his eyes, staring at the floor. “I cleaned up a bit,” Sherlock said. “For Rosie.”
They stayed like that for several minutes. Sherlock kept muttering, “I love you, I love you, I love you.” He never wanted to leave this position. He had to. His flight was going to leave soon. As soon as John’s breath was regulated, he gently lifted his head up and shifted slightly backwards. John looked up at him, tear stains on his cheeks. Sherlock felt his heart shatter at the sight and he had to fight not to cry. “I have to go,” Sherlock said, his voice gravelly.
He trembled and shook and clutched the couch as he came down. He gritted his teeth as reality started to sink it. The few hours of forgetting were nice, but the world felt like it was crashing down on his shoulders again. Somehow the pain was even worse than before. The hollowness returned, filling him.
John almost smiled. “We’re going to, you know. Today. We’re going to go to the shops and buy decorations.”
John sighed again. “She broke up with me.” Sherlock looked puzzled. “She was pretty pissed off that I had to cancel our plans tonight.”
Sherlock shut his eyes tightly. He couldn’t help but wonder if John was just faking it for Sherlock’s sake or if he truly did reciprocate Sherlock’s feelings.
“Yeah? My girlfriend just broke up with me on Christmas Eve,” John said, and the mood shifted instantly. Sherlock released him and took a step back. John shivered at the lack of warmth.
Sherlock rose from his chair, making a split-second decision. “I’ll go pick her up and bring her back here. You both will stay for the night.” John started to protest, but Sherlock held up a hand. “Forgive me, but I don’t believe we’re finished with this conversation. And you’re clearly exhausted. This isn’t negotiable.” John nodded and sank back into his chair, smiling weakly.
“You know I’m not gay.” Sherlock nodded. “I could never have feelings for you.” He nodded again, pressing his mouth into a straight line. He had finally managed to put the papers in order. “It’s disgusting that you feel that way.”
“Wait!” Sherlock called, setting down the violin. John didn’t wait. He walked out the door. Sherlock collapsed onto his chair and shut his eyes. He could feel the cocaine high starting to ebb away. He squeezed his eyes tight and waited for the inevitable. The hollow feeling started to return. His chest grew heavy. When he opened his eyes, John’s chair was gone.
Sherlock hadn’t wanted a huge wedding, and to his delight, John agreed. They decided on a small wedding, held in Sussex near the coast. Sherlock hadn’t wanted to invite many people, but John convinced him to invite a few. Lestrade, Mycroft (Sherlock had tried to tell John not to, but John insisted), Mrs. Hudson, Molly and her fiancé, Sherlock’s parents, and Harry and Clara. A few others. Eurus was not invited, nor even considered, for which Sherlock was very glad.
“Why would you want to?” Now it’s Sherlock’s turn to be confused. He thought John would be happy. Impressed, even. That Sherlock knew, and that Sherlock bothered to do something about it.
I'm going to try to update this once a week, but it might be closer to once every two weeks. It'll depend on how busy I am and how much time (and motivation) I have to write. I don't have a chapter count quite yet, but I think it will be longer than what I've previously written. Once again, each chapter will feature drugs and suicide. It will only get worse from here. :)
“I love it,” Sherlock said. It was his song. The song he composed for them. The one song he had never even dreamed of dancing with John to, and coincidentally the one song he really wanted to dance to with John. Sherlock tugged John closer, and John laid his head on Sherlock’s shoulder. Sherlock held him tight, swaying to the music, moving around the room. Sherlock was certain that he had never been happier. The duo playing the music was decent, he had to admit, though not as good as he was. He couldn’t believe John had done this for him. A contented feeling settled in the pit of his stomach. He rested his head on John’s and danced.
Having decided that the violin was tuned to perfection, Sherlock drew the bow over the A string. The note came out sounding crisp and clear. He thought he’d need a moment of recollection after weeks of not playing, but his muscle memory took over. He played
“Probably,” Sherlock breathed. It would be so easy right now. He could do it. He could lean forward and brush his lips to John’s. He thought John might not even push him away. His face was so close. John’s eyes had specks of even darker blue right around the pupils. They were, without a doubt, the most attractive eyes Sherlock had ever seen.
Sherlock didn’t have the energy to do anything but stand under the warm water, his head leaning against the wall of the shower. He wasn’t sure how long he stayed under the water. He wasn’t even sure what he was doing.
“Whatever you say, mate,” Lestrade said, and pulled Sherlock to his feet. He supported him tightly as he dragged Sherlock back to his cab. “For the record, though, John wouldn’t want you to do that.”
“Something like that.” Sherlock sighed. He had begun to like Wiggins, and that was rare. Wiggins was quiet and respectful and didn’t ask stupid questions. His chest twisted.
“I need a case!” He stormed into the sitting room. Wiggins peered up at him in a haze. “Have I had any clients?” Wiggins shook his head. Sherlock opened his laptop and scrolled through his emails until he found a murder case. “Brilliant,” he mused, grinning at the email. “Would you like to be my assistant?” The case was far enough away that Lestrade, nor any of his associates at New Scotland Yard, would be there.
“Yeah. Maybe, yeah. Before you showed up to my wife’s grave high out of your fucking mind. Maybe there was a chance. Before. But there sure as hell isn’t a chance now.” Anger. That’s all Sherlock could read in John. It was visible in the way he clenched and unclenched his hands, the way his posture was military-straight, the way his face was lacking its usual affection, the way his lips were pressed. Sherlock shivered, John’s cold, hard stare boring into him.
“Me too,” John whispered. “I’m sorry you went through all of that. I’m sorry I didn’t notice. I’m sorry I wasn’t there for you when I should have been.”
Warning: mentions of parental abuse and alcoholism. None of this is happening present-day, but there is still trauma from it.
After it was prepped to begin its reaction, Sherlock went back to his desk. He hadn’t thrown out the pictures of John, nor did he end up throwing out many of their little notes. Things like
Sherlock saw Mycroft reach up and adjust his tie. “A shame my brother couldn’t be here today. I’m sure it was-”
John scratched the back of his neck. “Not sure. I don’t want to look through everything today. I’ll just grab what’s mine and come back some other time.”
Sherlock took a seat in the pew behind the others. Wiggins sat down next to him. He had been unusually silent, and Sherlock had nearly forgotten he was there. In front of him were the sounds of muffled crying. Grandparents. And an uncle. He shrugged off his coat, laying it on the bench next to him. He folded his hands in his lap, suddenly wishing that he had picked up a schedule from the foyer. The coffin-no, casket, more rectangular-in the front of the room was a polished light wood. Sherlock presumed it was handsome, though he wasn’t certain.
It wasn’t a permanent solution, because John eventually would return to his miserable flat and Sherlock would be without him, but he could focus on the now instead of the later. He had to focus on the now instead of the later.
He had promised. He promised to protect them both. He made a vow. He had failed. Mary was dead. John probably hated him. No, John definitely hated him.
“Why would you want to?” He was mumbling, voice thick from sleep. It was a fair point. John didn’t know why he would want to move. He stroked Sherlock’s curls and Sherlock nuzzled into his chest.
“Thank you, John.” Sherlock tugged John’s hand out of his hair and rested it against his chest, holding it with his own. John’s other hand resumed stroking his hair.
“Because you’re here. It’s not a danger night because you’re here,” Sherlock breathed. John’s stomach leapt, and he had to physically restrain himself from grinning. It was such a sweet confession, one so Sherlock-like but at the same time not. “John? Did I overstep?”
, the way he'd always wanted to. John’s body was warm against his own. Sherlock lost track of time. He didn’t know how long they stayed like that, John quivering in his arms, but Sherlock was more than willing to let him stay there.
“That could’ve landed on me,” he said, scowling. “I dressed up just for you, and that’s how you show your appreciation?”
John was still in his chair. “Everything okay?” Sherlock asked, crossing the room to get his violin.
“Putting that aside,” Sherlock said, even while knowing that they would revisit it later, “You’re not your father.”
“How can you not understand? I did everything for you. I jumped off a building and faked my death for two years for you. I was ready to kill my own brother for you. I planned a perfect wedding for you. I wrote you and your wife a waltz. I forgave the woman who shot me
“No.” He gritted his teeth. “I don’t think I will. Anyways, it’s irrelevant. We were talking about drugs. Not this.”
“I wanted to see you.” John grabbed his toast and went over to the fridge to get eggs. Sherlock smirked at him and then took a bite.
Sherlock didn’t see his face, but he could picture his smile. Or at least he hoped John was smiling. “You’ve seen her before, Mrs. Hudson.” He sounded tired, wary of the fact he was back at Baker Street.
He was jumping to conclusions. There was no way someone could be this cruel. His heart pounding, he looked up Old Compton Road. There was a bombing, at the Admiral Duncan bar. His hands started shaking. Damilola Taylor was murdered at North Peckham estate, and Jody Dobrowski at Clapham Common. His palms started to sweat. They were all murdered for the same reason. With the possible exception of Taylor, because he was ten, but he was bullied for the same thing. And Turing, but Turing committed suicide. He slammed the laptop shut.
Mrs. Hudson awkwardly left for her flat, claiming that she needed to pack for her trip later that afternoon. Sherlock didn’t blame her. A thick silence fell upon 221B when she left. Sherlock was watching John. John was scanning the flat. Even Rosie was quiet, her face buried in John’s shirt.
“Fine,” Sherlock agreed, even as something inside of him broke. It wasn’t fine. It was far from fine. Sherlock couldn’t do this. He couldn’t pretend that everything was fine. He couldn’t pretend like John had torn him apart. He didn’t know how to do this. It was so far out of his depth. Laughably out of his depth. He went into his room, shutting the door behind him. He blocked out the world and tried to focus on something else, anything else, anything but the emptiness growing in his chest. Sherlock stayed in his room until he was sure John’s shift was over.
“How what works? Sharing a bed?” Sherlock nodded. “Well,” John said. “Generally, you have to be lying down.” Sherlock flushed.
Later that night, after Rosie had been put to bed (wrapped up in her dog blanket) and the remnants of Christmas Dinner were cleaned up, John suggested that they put some carols on. Sherlock, not in the mood to play the violin, agreed.
John pulled his hand away, and Sherlock’s heart sank. John hated him for choosing Mycroft, even if it was just a dream. How could he not? But then John’s arm was around Sherlock and he pulled Sherlock down so he was resting on his shoulder. “It’s okay, Sherlock. Really, it is. You had to make a choice, so you did. It was just a dream.”
He awoke much later to bright sunlight. He blinked, once. It was midmorning, judging by the position and intensity of the sun. He groaned as he rolled over. Something soft was in his arms. His room didn’t smell like his room at all. It smelled like John. He briefly wondered if John was in his bed with him before remembering that he was in John’s room upstairs. The sheets smelled comforting, and the jumper fit perfectly against his chest.
In his own room, he sat on the edge of the bed and buried his face in his hands. That night had been...a lot. Not necessarily in a bad way, he thought, but it was overwhelming. So John still was angry at him for faking his suicide. That wasn’t too much of a surprise, but he had been hoping he wasn’t.
John licked his lips. “I know. I’m going to try to talk. I’m going to try to sit through the uncomfortableness and answer any questions you might possibly have. I’m going to do my best, Sherlock, but I need you to understand that it’s difficult.”
I didn't mean for this whole chapter to be a case, but it worked and that's the way it went so I left it.
“She did,” John said, and kissed him again. He couldn’t help it. Sherlock’s chest was warm against his own.
“Okay,” agreed John. He kissed the top of Sherlock’s head. Sherlock melted into his touch and made a contented noise. So of course, John did it again. Sherlock’s eyelids fluttered closed. “Tired?”
He waited until he heard John’s door close, and then sat up. The music sheet was carefully replaced in its envelope. Sherlock looked at it. It had been shifted a centimeter to the right. He laughed to himself. John seriously couldn’t think he wouldn’t notice? He was Sherlock Holmes, after all. Unbidden, John’s face as he saw the music came to the front of his mind. His smile faltered, then disappeared. He filed the picture of John in the room of “Things I Never Want To See From John Again.” It was a small room off of John’s wing, and it broke his heart every time. John telling him he needed air. John calling him a machine. John’s voice on the phone when he was on the roof. John’s voice when he was lying on the ground. John’s speech at the funeral. John blaming him for Mary’s death.
“You heard me fine,” Mycroft said smoothly. “I know you did. So, let me ask again: What did you do?”
“I’m not planning on being out long. Like you said, it’s raining and I don’t want to get too wet. I’d normally offer for you to come, but…” Sherlock trailed off, hoping John wouldn’t take offence at that.
Sherlock pushed open the door to John’s room. He was met by the sight of John sprawled out in bed. Enough light came through the window to see that John’s face was pale and sweaty. His legs were tangled around his blankets. His fists were clenched into the sheets. Rosie lay sleeping in her cot at the foot of his bed. He marvelled at her ability to sleep through the noise.
He also thought about his anger at John’s father, and by extent his sister. Clearly, people in his past did their very best to treat John as insignificant. Sherlock’s heart ached at that. John was perhaps the most significant person he knew, and it hurt that John himself didn’t know that.
Night had fallen when he got up again. He was exhausted. He could feel it deep in his bones, permeating him like a thick fog. He dragged himself from the couch, considering playing the violin, but almost immediately dismissed that idea and went into his room instead.
He was transferred onto a bed and hooked up to a monitor. No. No! He had to get out of there. He had to warn someone. He tore off the monitor and sat up, ignoring the pain. He lashed out with his fists, making contact with someone. Garbled sounds rose from his throat. Voices called out around him. And then a needle was in his arm and he was sinking, down, down, down, into the darkness.
He gripped his knees tighter and lowered his forehead until it was touching his knees. He rocked back and forth slightly. John had hugged him exactly once. It was after the speech. After Sherlock made it known just how much he cared about John. The hug was brief. Sherlock wanted nothing more than to reciprocate, but he knew if he did he might never be able to let go. John was happy at the wedding, and although there was a murder, it ended well. For John, at least. Sherlock looked around. Everyone was busy, socialising. He started to walk towards Janine, but even she was with someone. His smile slowly dropped as he felt the cold start to wrap around his heart. Worst of all, John was happy. John wouldn’t even notice if Sherlock left, because he was busy with Mary. His heart heavy, his steps slow, he tucked the waltz he wrote into the envelope and left the wedding. Everyone was happy, and no one needed him there anymore.
“I’ll make them,” Sherlock said, needing to do something. “Scrambled okay?” John nodded his assent and Sherlock pulled out a pan. Soon, the smell of cooking eggs mingled with the smell from the oven. “What will Rosie be eating?”
The cab ride to Olivia’s house was relatively short. The cabbie kept glancing back towards him suspiciously, but Sherlock paid him no mind. He was dropped off in front of a row of houses. Identical brownstone buildings, spaced a few feet apart. He took notice of their similarity. Dull.
The car ride was relatively quick compared to the ride over. Mycroft’s car hummed beneath him and he found himself enjoying the ride in spite of himself. It was easier to focus on the car than to focus on Sherlock, anyways. Before long, he found himself pulling up to an elegant mansion on the outskirts of London. He gaped.
“I’ll make sure to plan something good,” John told him, jostling his arm. Sherlock dropped his food.
A man was running towards him, leaping over the gap and coming closer. Sherlock put his hands up and braced for impact. He didn’t know who it was.
Finally, finally, there was a knock on the door. Sherlock had the door to 221B closed-no clients, not while he was recovering. “Come in,” Lestrade called.
John stared resolutely at Sherlock, eyes taking in every aspect of his expression and reading things that Sherlock most likely didn’t want him to.
Sherlock glanced at the clock. Nearly eight. John should’ve been there by six. They had planned on getting dinner together, maybe going to Angelo’s or something. But John looked exhausted and worn down and not at all like he wanted to go out to dinner.
“Isn’t it obvious,” Sherlock said, scowling. “I don’t want to be best friends.” John’s stomach dropped, and he was so surprised that he let go of Sherlock’s sleeve. “I want to be
Sherlock was sitting with Mrs. Hudson, a discarded card game on the floor. They’d tried to play Hearts, but gave up when Sherlock pointed out that it really wasn’t meant for two people. Sherlock was holding his violin loosely in one hand, staring out the window. His phone buzzed.
This chapter is a bit darker than the first one. John thinks that Sherlock might have turned to drugs again. There are multiple mentions of drugs and mentions of previous suicidal thoughts. Nothing happens, but suicide is mentioned.
He tipped his head back, clasping his hands even tighter. A burning feeling settled in his eyes and throat, an interesting contrast to the ever-present numbness.
Sherlock’s fingers traced over the seams of his blanket as he waited for morning. He lost himself in his mind palace, not moving until the first rays of light streamed in through his open window.
“I can make my own decisions.” Sherlock’s voice was unnaturally tight, even to him. At that moment, he was furious. Mycroft didn’t, and wouldn’t, understand. How could he?
Two days later, Mycroft and Lestrade came back to visit him. The hospital was dull, incredibly dull, and even the telly didn’t distract him. He was also suffering from extreme withdrawal, and as a result, barely slept or ate. He was withering away, and only wished it would happen faster.
He cut her off with a wave of his hand. “Not literally,” he snapped. “I made a vow. I told them I would protect them, and then Mary had to go and jump in front of a bullet that was supposed to kill me. Not her. So yes, I killed his wife.”
“No!” She frowned at him. “She’s never expressed running away, or anything like that.” Sherlock scanned her. Single mom, divorced seventeen years ago. Lawyer, tried not to work long hours. A good mother, very supportive.
Archie held the rings up between them. Thin platinum bands, rounded edges, glinting dully in the light. Sherlock had gone with John to pick them out, and he privately thought that they couldn’t have picked better. Sherlock ached to kiss John, and reminded himself that it was just a few more minutes until he could.
He was being forced to say goodbye, most likely for forever, and he and John didn’t have much time left. Ten minutes at most. Sherlock tried to avoid making eye contact as he told John where he was going, but found he couldn’t look away from John’s face.
“You’ll need to come in for a fine.” Sherlock nodded. The police officer continued talking, but the white noise was back. It filled his ears, and started to cloud his vision. He was pulled off the police officer, his limbs limp and weak.
He quickly showered and then dried his hair, making sure his curls were perfect. Wrapping a towel around his waist, he went back into the bedroom to pick out an outfit. A maroon shirt, black suit jacket and black trousers. No tie. Sherlock got dressed, smoothing out any folds and making sure he looked crisp and controlled. He looked at the time. Thirteen minutes to go. He had suggested to John that they arrive separately, to make it look like more of a date, but John told him to meet him in the sitting room instead. Sherlock frantically wondered if he should’ve gotten John flowers, or something, but John didn’t seem like the flower type and Sherlock hadn’t had a chance to get John anything since they spent a lovely day watching telly and later taking a walk with Rosie.
Sherlock walked away, leaving John’s mind spinning. It clicked into place and despite John understanding it logically, he had no idea how to process this. Sherlock was in love with him.
John hadn’t moved from his chair when Sherlock returned. That was either promising or terrible, and Sherlock didn’t know which. “How are you feeling?” He crossed the room to stand by John’s side. In the faint light his eyes were reddened and tired.
John’s sobs slowly dwindled until all that was left was quiet sniffling. Eventually, he moved away from the window. Sherlock turned to look at him. “Sherlock?”
He reached the Westminster Bridge quickly. He collapsed against the railing in the middle of the bridge, another scream ripping out of him. Nobody else was around to hear it. The clock tower was lit up, hazy but visible through the worsening rain. He panted and sobbed, looking down at the dark river.
“Tonight’s Christmas Eve.” John refrained from making a sarcastic comment only due to the hesitation he sensed in Sherlock’s voice. “And you’re not with Jeanette. I understand that people generally want to spend tonight with the ones they love?”
“No, no, there is something to apologize for.” John kept his eyes on Sherlock, even though Sherlock still had his head down. “I treated you horribly.”
John rubbed at his face. Sherlock saw now that tear tracks were mingled with the sweat. He reached out a thumb to wipe them away. Maybe it was just his imagination, but it seemed like John was leaning into his touch. Sherlock sat down on the edge of John’s bed, and to his relief, John didn’t move away.
“You were on drugs,” he said, softly. “That’s bound to mess with your memories.” He left the room. Sherlock stared at the wall.
Mycroft walked swiftly to Sherlock’s side. “Are you all right?” Sherlock scanned his face. It was the first time he had ever seen something resembling fear in his eyes.
Sherlock tightened his grip on John’s hand, warm against his chest. “I am not, John. I turned to drugs because I couldn’t cope with my feelings.”
He had too many unanswered emails to read all of them, but one in particular caught his attention. It was from Olivia MacDonald, the same woman he had helped out earlier. Simply to satisfy his curiosity he opened it.
Only for a moment, of course, because although breathing’s boring it was quite necessary to living. In this moment, Sherlock was sure he wanted to be living.
Sherlock always remembered, everything, but he hadn’t even checked what exactly he had been injecting. The cab ride was boring. He stared out the window and deduced the passersby. His brain was moving faster than usual, yet he couldn’t seem to make sense of his deductions. A headache was starting to form. Sherlock closed his eyes and leaned back against the seat.
Sherlock’s legs buckled as he hit the ground. He rolled, coming to a stop directly in front of the door. It was open slightly. The lock on the door was bent. Someone had tried to close it, in a hurry, but couldn’t. The killer? Sherlock pressed his back to the door. The angle worked. It fit with the angle of the bullet in the man’s chest.
“I don’t know why I did it. I was just so angry at so many people and I guess I took it out on you.”
He strolled into the living room and turned on his laptop. Cases. New cases. Were there any? He tapped his fingers impatiently while he waited. “Yes!” He grinned broadly. “Yes, yes, yes!”
Once the bread was cooking, Sherlock was hit by a thought. John stood there and watched him play for a few rounds of the song. He had
“That. Whatever you’re doing.” He waved his hand around weakly. “Trying to get to me. You win. It’s over.” Sherlock winced.
He was trying so hard to forgive John. He was trying to mend their relationship. He was trying to do it all on his own, because John wasn’t going to apologise or say anything to make it better. Sherlock slumped back in his chair, ignoring the heat spreading across his face. It didn’t matter. This-whatever was going on between them-couldn’t last.
“You like to aggravate people,” John said coolly. Sherlock fell into a stony silence. The queue got shorter and shorter. The restaurant was full tonight. Happy customers, couples, families. They probably had no idea they were eating in the same room as a drug addict. Not an addict, Sherlock thought. Except maybe he was. He didn’t remember the cravings being this bad before. His body itched for relief.
Disappointment flared once, quickly, then dissipated into nothing. Numb, hollow nothing. He wasn’t surprised, of course, and berated himself for even daring to think it might be John. John didn’t want anything to do with him. Of course he didn’t. Sherlock killed his wife. Suddenly, all he wanted was to curl up in his chair by the fire, John opposite. He hit his thigh with a closed fist, once again relishing the pain.
“John, I think this is it.” Mary sounded so certain, so sure that this was the end. She was right, Sherlock knew. This was the end. John protested. “You made me so happy,” Mary said, interrupting him, her voice cracking. “You gave me everything I had ever, ever wanted.”
John had looked at him, and Sherlock had looked back, and then they laughed, and then Mary laughed, and then Sherlock realized. He was in love with John Watson. Who had just gotten married. Whose wife was actually pregnant. The smile disappeared from his face. John and Mary went off to dance, and he looked around the room. He knew barely anyone. He wanted to go over to Janine-she was boring, but better than no one-but even she was busy. Molly was with her boyfriend and Mrs. Hudson. And Sherlock was alone again.
“When I was twelve, my mum got ill. It started as influenza, but then it turned into pneumonia. She worsened quickly, very quickly. We couldn’t afford doctor’s bills. She was confined to her bed. We couldn’t help her. Without proper care, there was no chance of her living. She died later that month.” John blinked rapidly. “Nobody could save her. My dad was a wreck about it. He turned to drinking.” Sherlock exhaled. “He-he became an alcoholic. He said terrible things about me. About Harry. About Mum. It started out with a beer or two in the evenings. Harry and I learned to stay away from him when he was drinking. We’d go and sit under the tree in the backyard, or we’d go to a convenience store. Harry became the only person I could talk to. It continued that way for almost three years.
John locked his eyes firmly with Sherlock’s. His gaze was intense. Sherlock almost broke it, but found that he couldn’t look away. John’s voice was steady when he asked, “Maybe Rosie and I can come for New Year’s, too?”
After about ten minutes, the doors to the church closed and Olivia stepped up to the altar. “There are no words for this tragedy,” she said, sounding exhausted. Her eyes were red-rimmed. “Dylan was my son. I don’t know how-how I’m going to be able to move on without him. I don’t think I can, he’s-I, I’m sorry, it’s just-” she took a breath, composed herself. “Life happens. It does, and we have to move on, but it’s just so difficult. He was-everything I had.” She continued talking, but a loud buzzing filled Sherlock’s ears. He was reminded, suddenly, of John’s blog post after his death. He had written some bullshit about
He gently replaced the music in the envelope and set the envelope on the stand. John looked at Sherlock sleeping one last time and wondered if he’d ever see him that peaceful again. Then he went up to bed, his mind blurring and feeling very guilty. It was probable that Sherlock hadn’t wanted him to see that. It was also probable that Sherlock didn’t really want John to know about any of his feelings. John felt like he was intruding on something private, something he wasn’t supposed to know about. Suddenly exhausted, he collapsed into bed and fell asleep almost immediately.
John made his way over to the stand. Sherlock had left the music there. His violin was in its case in the corner. The only thing on the music stand was a closed envelope. John reached for it. He opened it. Inside were several sheets of music. He took them out and looked at the top one. It had a note on it. He squinted to read it.
Sherlock crawled upstairs and collapsed into a guest bedroom. John wouldn’t be able to find him here, and Mycroft could keep him out of the house if necessary. He couldn’t figure out which would be worse: John following him and telling him he didn’t feel the same way, or John not following him at all. For a moment he allowed himself to imagine that John would come find him, take Sherlock in his arms, and tell him, “of course I love you, you bloody idiot.” But the thought of that was too painful. He closed his eyes and wished he had his violin.
He didn’t know where in the graveyard Mary was buried. He walked up and down the rows of graves very slowly, searching. Searching. He avoided the area where his grave was. John may have buried her in the same cemetery, but Sherlock was certain he wouldn’t want Mary to be near him. His steps were slow and measured, his stomach churning. Every so often, white spots flared in his vision and he had to stop, dizzy. The sunlight shone, too brightly, too hot. His head ached. This was not a pleasant high.
Olivia showed him up to Madison’s room. The room was smaller, painted grey. The bed had grey sheets and a fluffy yellow comforter. Their dog was curled up on the bed. Sherlock held out his hand and allowed the dog to sniff him, rubbing between its ears. Her clothes were mostly hoodies and jeans. The faint scent of mint lingered in the air.
“I lied.” He turned back around with a huff. John stood up, and in that second Sherlock thought he would leave. His shoulder was suddenly cold and he missed the warmth of John’s hand. Instead, John walked around the bed until he was crouched down besides Sherlock. Sherlock immediately shut his eyes.
Sherlock clasped John’s hand and put his hand on John’s shoulder. John wrapped his other hand around Sherlock’s waist. They waited.
“Right.” John laughed harshly. “Yeah, all right.” He shook his head, clenched and unclenched his fist. “I just thought-when I didn’t see you-that you gave in.”
John was ashamed about those times. His anger had got the best of him and Sherlock had been so good and kind and forgiving. Wait. “Mycroft?”
“I suppose,” Sherlock said, and tugged on his coat. John bundled up Rosie and strapped her into the carrier on his chest, following Sherlock down the steps.
Sherlock levelled his gaze to meet hers. There was no use trying to get out of having a talk. If she wanted to have a talk, they were going to have a talk. He manoeuvred himself into his chair. Mrs. Hudson took the chair he used for clients and set it opposite him and then took a seat. He waited.
“I don’t want to die.” His voice was pitiful, even to him. Smith placed a hand over Sherlock’s mouth. Sherlock’s eyes widened. He thought Smith would kill him with a gun, but suffocation was so much worse. He held his breath, calmed himself. It was an exercise. A breathing exercise. Smith’s hand tightened over his mouth and nose, and Sherlock stiffened. His breath was becoming short, his chest tightening. His lungs burned for air. He began to thrash, weakly, but Smith was stronger and able to hold him down. He started to panic. His head felt light, unfocused.
At the top of the stairs, Sherlock took the bags from John. Their hands brushed. John made no effort to pull away. Sherlock set the bags in the kitchen then walked back into the living room to sit with John. John was in his chair, legs crossed. Sherlock flicked on the light on the table.
“I’m Sherlock Holmes,” Sherlock said, and slipped under the tape. “I was told to come by one of your officers. Would you like to see the email?”
When he finally stopped trembling, he felt very, very cold. The window was open. He shivered. Anxiety attacks always made him exhausted, and he wanted to sleep, but was afraid of nightmares. So afraid. It was ridiculous, he didn’t get scared, but here he was. He allowed himself to lie down on his side, his muscles stiff. His eyes burned with tiredness, but he refused to fall asleep.
John nodded. He climbed in the first cab he could see. “Lauriston Gardens, quickly,” he panted. “As fast as you can.”
Sherlock swallowed and then slowly, very slowly, readjusted himself so he was lying next to John. The bed was very small, resulting in them being pressed together along one side. Sherlock’s heart beat. He hoped John couldn’t hear it. John’s hand slid over the back of his hand and then flipped it over, intertwining their fingers. Sherlock had to close his eyes with the rush of emotion.
The Bible verse I used during the funeral is Isaiah 57: 1-2. I'm not religious nor have I been to a funeral, but as Sherlock explains, I thought Mary would want a pastor to speak at her funeral.
“Rehabilitation, dear brother.” Mycroft stood up and smiled, but there was no warmth to his smile. It wasn’t an empty threat. Sherlock knew that. “I will have the Detective Inspector and Mrs. Hudson keep an eye on you. If you use, I will know.” He straightened his tie and turned to the door. “Afternoon.”
Sherlock decided not to put the kettle on, then. He didn’t need tea, and if John didn’t want any there was no reason to bother. The fridge was stocked with various body parts and little food. John would disapprove. Sherlock wondered for a moment where he was and why he wasn’t scolding him.
Sherlock grabbed at his hair again. It was difficult to tell whether the wetness that seemed to be falling down his cheeks was from tears or from the shower. He twisted his hands into his curls, feeling a burn. He had been
“No, I don’t know what that’s like,” Sherlock said, though maybe he did have a good idea of what losing someone felt like.
“Sleeping,” John said coldly, gesturing upstairs and taking a seat on the couch. Sherlock fell into a chair across from him. “Mrs. Hudson, would you like a glass of water?”
“We’re not really together anymore. I couldn’t do that, not after she lied. We’re still friends, just not...in love.”
“Come in.” Too tired to even snap at Mycroft, Sherlock pushed himself into a seated position, reclining against the headboard.
“No. It’s not. But that doesn’t mean that everything has to be ruined.” Sherlock knew that things might not be perfect again, but the fact that he and John were actually having conversations instead of pushing things away was pretty damn amazing.
“No, you’re not, dear.” She frowned at him disapprovingly. “Mycroft told me what happened. Not to mention the times you hit him.”
After takeaway, John sat with Rosie in his chair. Sherlock was across from them, idly reorganising the room of his mind palace dedicated to different kinds of cigarette tar. Coincidentally, it was adjacent to the room with the analysis of tobacco ash.
“I’m here for you,” John whispered, because he suspected nobody had ever said that to Sherlock before. “You don’t have to pretend around me.” Sherlock blinked again, rapidly. His eyes flickered over John’s face. John took another step closer. “Okay? I’m here. I am. It’ll be okay.” Sherlock nodded, once, and then threw his arms around John, pulling him in. John went willingly into his embrace. His entire body was trembling. Sherlock’s face was buried in John’s hair. John held him tightly. Happiness simmered somewhere inside him. This was good. He liked this hug. Aside from the fact that Sherlock was upset. Sherlock broke the silence by whispering something into John’s hair. He didn’t catch it.
a small voice in his head said. He hit the heel of his hand against his head, then ran his fingers through his hair to clear his thoughts. John not talking to him seemed all the more bearable now. He almost couldn’t remember why he was upset. Everything was good right now. John was...gone. Sherlock was fine with that. Really, he was. He lived without John for way over half of his life. He had been fine then, he would be fine now.
“Yes, but wait.” John stood up and crossed the room. Sherlock sat upright, panicked. But then John was getting Rosie, coming back, and telling Sherlock to lie back down. Sherlock did just that.
“You’re welcome,” Sherlock said softly. John didn’t say those things lightly, which meant that he genuinely meant it. Sherlock smiled sadly at him.
“Don’t say that. Please, don’t say that.” John gripped Sherlock’s hand tightly. Sherlock was stunned. John was touching him. Again. Yes, Sherlock initiated the contact both times, but John was reciprocating.
John laid there for as long as he could, determined to find out more about the song. He watched the minutes tick by on his clock. 10:56. 11:21. 11:47. When the clock struck midnight, he decided he would only lie in bed for a few more minutes. After that, he was going to find that music and find out what Sherlock had written.
He sat down on a bench in one of the cubicles, waiting. To his great relief, the water shortly stopped. Footsteps padded to the sink and then left the room. Sherlock groaned and stood up. He stripped off his t-shirt, wincing. His bandages were dark and dirty around the edges, so he took those off as well. He ran a hand over his ribs. A shot of pain flared through him. He removed his hand and figured he’d need to ask someone for replacement bandages.
“You don’t have to do that,” John said, but looked slightly relieved so Sherlock figured it was the right idea to offer. “Chinese? I’ll order.”
“All right,” Sherlock said absently. He watched as John stood up and walked over to the door. When he reached it, he turned around and faced Sherlock.
“What do all these places have in common? John, you may have solved it. Maybe you’re not so much of an idiot after all.” Sherlock closed his eyes and fell back on the couch, very still, his hands steepled beneath his chin.
“Well, let’s have breakfast and then she can open it. I got her something as well,” John told him, shaking his head. “Of course you’d get her something.”
Sherlock spun around in the chair. He knew he looked terrible. His face was probably drawn and pale, his eyes bloodshot. “Yes?”
He stood up and went downstairs, as slowly as he could. The bandages on his chest were tight, restricting movement. The medication hadn’t worn off yet, but he was still exhausted. An unfortunate side effect. He reached up and touched the stitches next to his eyebrow. It stung slightly, so he pressed harder. His eyes were unfocused, tired from sleep and blurry from the medication. Wiggins was reclining in his chair.
Their kisses were always at home, sometimes under the watchful gaze of Rosie, sometimes lazily on the couch, sometimes in front of the fireplace. John had moved his things down to Sherlock’s room.
“Sherlock?” His eyes snapped open. That was John’s voice. John was standing near him, brow creased. “You okay?”
Sherlock dashed into a nearby alley, trying to buy himself some more time. The man followed him. Sherlock was cornered between a wall and a dumpster, but he couldn’t quite fit behind it. The man pointed the gun at him again. “Enough with the games, Mr. Holmes. I think both of us want this to be over as soon as possible, don’t we?”
Sherlock collapsed to the ground after this. His legs gave way and he fell, slowly, avoiding John and his venom. His heart iced over. Protection. John’s words cut him raw, stripped him open, so he froze himself. Avoid. Lock out the emotions. It was too much to feel. He wanted to sink into the ground, sink so low into the earth that he burned at the core.
Sherlock thought back to their conversation. Somehow, he ended up in Battersea Park, looking at the Thames. His walk took less than an hour, so the darkness hadn’t begun to fade yet.
He paid and stood up, Rosie clinging to his jumper. The walk back to Baker Street was quite quiet, Rosie having sleepily laid her head on his shoulder. He didn’t know what Sherlock would be doing when he got back. Hell, he didn’t even know if Sherlock would be there. Fear gripped at his heart again. He truly was treating Sherlock terribly. First he hurt him for years with his obliviousness, then led him on. It was a miracle Sherlock had even exchanged words with him that morning. Then of course he had to go and piss Sherlock off even more.
His heart clenched as he stepped inside and gave the driver his address. He almost turned to the side, to say something to John, and his stomach twisted unpleasantly. The cab smelled faintly of takeaway, though not any of his usual takeaway restaurants. He watched various people out the window and tried to deduce who they were and what they were doing. His brain moved at a slower pace than usual.
“I killed her,” he snapped. “I stood there and let her take a bullet for me. I let her die. You don’t know a thing about what John wants. He never wants to see me again.”
He sighed again and looked at John’s empty chair. So much had changed. It used to be the two of them. Then it was Mary with them. Sherlock hadn’t liked that. But then Mary died, leaving John to look after Rosie. John moved back into Baker Street with Rosie, and everything seemed to be better than before.
The showers were at the end of the hallway, divided into small cubicles. Running water told Sherlock that he wasn’t alone. He sighed. Showering would be difficult with his injuries, and the last thing he wanted was to be in the company of another person. The nurse handed him a bar of soap, and told him to call for someone if he wanted to shave. He didn’t care enough to do that.
“Oh, no, no,” Smith said, smiling widely. “Not yet.” He sat down on the edge of Sherlock’s bed, and it dipped under his weight. Sherlock clenched his fists into the sheets, grimacing at the sudden movement. “You see, I can’t have you knowing my secret.”
“You’re just saying that to try and deflect,” John said, venom in his voice. “Everyone’s sexually attracted to someone. Unless you’re not even human. Which, now that I think about it, might be true.”
Smith’s hands left his mouth abruptly and Sherlock gasped for breath. “Sherlock!” Someone called to him, loudly, concerned. He blinked spots out of his eyes and looked towards the door. Mycroft was standing there, Lestrade just behind him. Lestrade’s gun was drawn, pointing at Smith. Smith’s hands were above his head, his back turned towards Sherlock.
“Please. For me.” Mycroft never said please, so Sherlock opened his eyes. Mycroft allowed a sliver of emotion to cross his normally cool demeanor. Pain. Sherlock saw raw pain. Guilt flared low in his stomach, an emotion he was becoming more and more used to feeling. An emotion he hated feeling.
Finally, the cab pulled to a halt. John sprang out of the cab, throwing money at the driver and readying his gun. Greg hadn’t gotten there yet.
“This is redundant and pointless,” Sherlock said. “We don’t need to keep discussing whether or not you’re like your father. You evidently believe that you are; I evidently know that that is completely incorrect. Arguing won’t get us anywhere.”
A strange emotion rushed over him. He had to fight to keep his body still, his breathing calm and even. He was about to cry. “Please, leave.” If John didn’t leave, he was going to fall apart and that was the last thing either of them needed.
Sherlock’s phone rang one evening when he and John were sitting around in the flat. He had been working on a particularly tricky case involving more suicides, but this time they were all found with a gun. Only Sherlock truly didn’t believe they were suicides. For one thing, it was the same model of gun found with all of them, and the autopsy revealed the bullet fired hadn’t even been from that gun. For another, they all hadn’t shown any previous signs of being suicidal (Lestrade got all their medical files). The real issue was that they all happened at exactly the same time, all five of them, one per day. Starting with Monday, ending with Saturday. The murderer had left a note with the time of death on it for all of them. Typed, no fingerprints. None of them lived near the locations they were murdered at either. Today was the sixth day, and Sherlock firmly believed there would be another one. He was trying to figure out the pattern of the serial suicides before the next one died.
Sherlock didn’t say anything, but walked into their bedroom. John counted that as a win. He gave Sherlock a moment, and then followed him in. Sherlock was bent over his dresser, poking at the top drawer. “John,” he said. “Do you think Molly would let me keep this in the lab?”
After walking for a few more blocks, he became aware of the fact that his coat was utterly and completely soaked. Ruined. He gripped the fabric tighter, took another breath. The smoke filled his lungs, soothing and familiar. The cigarette was almost burnt out now. He would need to light another one.
Sherlock raised himself out of bed when he thought it was late enough. Twitching restlessly, he put on the kettle to make tea. John would be up shortly. His habit of rising early was something he hadn’t quite managed to get rid of from his time in Afghanistan. He poured a splash of milk into his cup.
“I just wondered. How things were going, you know,” he said lamely. “And if there was anything I could do.”
“Yes. Right.” Sherlock’s skin crawled uncomfortably. Being alone with John was strange. It was once something Sherlock craved, but now he just wanted to be alone.
“I hit you. You came to me, clearly asking for help, high off your arse, and I hit you. I shouldn’t do that. In no way is that okay. It’s something he would do. He was abusive and angry and violent. Do you know how many years of therapy it took for me to come to those conclusions?” John laughed bitterly. “It took me a very long time. Sherlock, I don’t want to inflict that kind of pain on you.”
Taking a deep breath, he ducked out from under the awning. The rain pounded down. His coat would soon be soaked through. Taking quick steps, he set off towards Baker Street. The cigarette helped calm his body, but his mind was active as ever. He almost regretted not taking a cab, not because of the rain, but because the walk home gave him endless time to think about John. He was certain he would never be able to delete that expression on John’s face, not ever. Even if he wanted to, he wouldn’t. He couldn’t. He had to keep it, had to remind himself of all the ways he had failed in keeping John and Mary safe.
He blinked into consciousness again, this time to the face of Mycroft staring down at him. He considered shutting his eyes again, to be petulant, but didn’t have the energy to argue. Instead, he shut his eyes because it hurt too much to keep them open.
“Fine. Fine.” He raised his hands in exasperation. “But if I find that you go back on that stuff, even one more time-and I have ways of knowing-then I’m sending you away.”
they now romantically engaged?) before moving in together. He also didn’t know if the rules were changed if they had been previously living together. Or if one moved out because the other fake-died. Or if the rules applied to their situation at all.
Some time later, John suggested that they stop. Sherlock acquiesced, and they found a bench to sit on.
“Don’t be ridiculous, John, of course I’ll come back,” he said in his usual brisk voice. He swept out of the flat. John didn’t bother to follow him. John knew when he needed space. He needed space now. John called Mrs. Hudson and asked her to look after Rosie for one more night. He briefly explained that him and Sherlock had a row and that they might need to work things out, and that there might be yelling. Mrs. Hudson was delighted to spend the day with Rosie.
and Mrs. Hudson shaking in silent laughter, she told him to take a shower and that she’d be back later. His first instinct was to be offended, but then realised he hadn’t showered in several days.
“I was married to my work. Oh.” Sherlock frowned. “You have to understand, John, I rarely feel romantic attachment and I have to get to know someone before I do. I said what I did because, at the time, I didn’t know how much I would grow to care for you.”
“Prick,” he said fondly. “Come on.” Sherlock slipped under the covers, motioning for John to do the same. He threw his dressing gown to the floor, and John joined him in the bed.
Sherlock stepped into the small alley, Wiggins behind him. The ground was spattered with blood, in places, and the body had not yet been touched. Sherlock knelt to the ground and pulled out his magnifying glass. He swiped at the blood with his finger. It was dry, of course it was, but he held it up and examined it. He didn’t see anything out of the ordinary.
Sherlock was far away, seeing but not seeing. Another house was burning, another family home lost. He didn’t blame John for choosing the movie, not really. If he had known beforehand he wouldn’t have thought it would bother him this much.
Sherlock abruptly pushed John’s arms away and stood up. “I need air,” he said, feeling as if he were suffocating. Best friend. Best friend. John wasn’t just his best friend. John was his everything.
Time slowed to a halt, the echo of the gunfire reverberating around the small room. Blue light danced across the walls, moving much too sluggishly.
“I’m not dead.” John’s voice was soothing. “I’m right here.” He ran his thumb along Sherlock’s palms. “Do you have that nightmare often?”
John snickered, and then started laughing. Sherlock, surprised, scowled but then started laughing as well. Those few seconds of laughter almost made all of the past while bearable. Until they locked eyes and something shuttered in John’s expression. He lowered his gaze. Sherlock fished the potsticker out of the soy sauce and ate it. The moment was over.
“I don’t want to be like him.” John spoke into the quietness of the flat. Sherlock felt as though he was witnessing something John never spoke about. Something John tried to avoid, but it was always there. “I’m afraid that I will be, Sherlock. I’m afraid that I already am.”
“Oh,” John said, and then thankfully didn’t ask any more questions. “Well, let me know if you do want to. I’d be…more than amicable to do that with you.”
He crawled over to the body. It was a young man, late twenties. Stubble dotted his face. The man’s chest was bloody. His clothes had a hole in them. Sherlock slipped on his gloves. He rubbed the soaked fabric between his fingers. The blood crumbled at his fingertips. He gently tore the fabric away from his skin, and looked at the wound. The flesh around it was swollen and red. The blood had dried further away from the wound, but the blood inside was dripping and wet. Sherlock probed it with a finger, and then sat back. He examined the man.
It had finally stopped raining. The sun had yet to come out. Sherlock tugged the coat around his shoulders and knotted his scarf. He picked his head up, held it high. Nobody paid him any attention as he called a cab.
“There may be an issue with your plan,” John said quietly, turning to face Sherlock once they were back in the sitting room.
Sherlock lifted a hand to wave at him. His heart panged at the sight of John leaving the flat. His footsteps echoed heavily down the stairs.
John shut his eyes and allowed himself to relax. He matched his breathing with Sherlock’s. In, out. In, out. John knew Sherlock wouldn’t sleep until he did. As he was drifting off, he thought he heard Sherlock muttering to himself about how he loved John, but John was too far gone to register that.
Sherlock glanced at the time. It really was quite late. No wonder Molly had texted. He probably would’ve done the same thing. It was also, as he said, very understandable. John was upset. His posture in his chair was rigid, his hands clenched together. Giving him space didn’t seem to help much, but Sherlock didn’t trust himself not to mess it up further by saying anything else. One thing was certain, though: When Sherlock returned with Rosie, they needed to talk more.
“Mm. Good,” John said, moving closer to Sherlock and wrapping an arm around him. Sherlock leaned into him.
“Is that truly what you believe I think of you?” The expression on John’s face was inexplicably sad.
“Where am I?” Sherlock looked around wildly before realizing that he was on the couch, in John’s lap. Rosie began to cry. The sky outside the window had grown dark. The light next to John was on.
I quickly googled it and found that black holes can indeed pull planets in. Next update in probably about two weeks, give or take a few days. I should be back on schedule now, but no promises. Once again, I'm not a doctor. I did my best.
“Yes, I realised that after she so kindly pointed it out.” Despite himself, John started to laugh, and after a moment Sherlock did too. “But seriously, are you okay?”
Sherlock heard muttering from the stairs. Lestrade dragged a chair over from the desk and sat down in it across from Sherlock. He said nothing, did nothing. Sherlock closed his eyes and leaned his head back across the couch.
caught in his throat and he wondered if Sherlock would pick up on that. Luckily, Sherlock just smiled and nodded.
But John was thanking him and turning to go to the loo. Sherlock looked down at Rosie in his arms. She looked up at him. “Hello,” he said.
Sherlock shrugged. “Mary’s dead.” His voice sounded strange, even to his own ears. He wasn’t sure of the status of his face, but he assumed that it didn’t look great. At those words, the hollowness spread throughout his entire body and his legs gave way. He stumbled, falling against the doorframe. Mrs. Hudson gaped at him, reaching an arm out. He waved her away, managing to get to the railing at the foot of the stairs without falling over.
The doctor explained that he would need to wear bandages and rest for most of the next week. He’d have weekly checkups until it healed, about six weeks. “I’m giving you enough medication to last for three days. After that, contact me. Don’t want you to get addicted.” He winked. Sherlock didn’t laugh. With that, he left the room.
When it was a quarter past midnight he slipped out of bed and crept down the stairs. At the door to their flat, he listened carefully. Sherlock could usually hear when he was going down the stairs, but he heard nothing. He pushed the door open and paused, waiting to see if Sherlock would come to him. Again, nothing.
There wouldn’t be, of course. John would probably allow him to stay for a few awkward minutes, before Sherlock came up with a plausible excuse to leave. He would stay long enough to ensure that John would live. If he wasn’t certain, he could come up with something else to do. He was counting on John’s politeness to at least see him. He would be angry. Sherlock was fully prepared to go through any and all forms of verbal abuse. He was even prepared for John to hit him again, or do something. He was willing to put up with it, with any of it, to see John. Even if it was probably the last time Sherlock would ever see him again.
John jumped up, praying it was Sherlock. Excitement filled his chest and spread to the rest of his body. His hands shook as he picked up the phone. “Hello?”
John appeared at the doorway, sleep-mussed, wearing only a white t-shirt and pyjama bottoms. Sherlock envisioned himself running his fingers through John’s hair, smoothing it and then messing it up again. He gave Sherlock a small smile when he saw him. Rosie was in his arms, squirming.
Breakfast consisted mostly of Sherlock drinking tea and John trying to get him to eat something. Sherlock refused, noting how John didn’t press him too hard. John’s hand shook slightly on his teacup. Nervous.
Sherlock whirled around back to Lestrade. “Really? We ‘always manage to work it out?’” He spit the words viciously, adding air quotes.
“Why?” John could clearly picture his expression: eyebrows raised, slightly concerned, slightly amused.
John smiled and kissed his head again, letting his lips linger there. They stayed like that, calm, content, until Sherlock finally stopped shaking. When he looked up again, his eyes were red, a tear slipping down his face. With the pad of his thumb, John brushed it away.
“Yes, I thought you’d notice. I don’t think they’re toxic, but you never know, and I didn’t want to expose Rosie to them.”
The door to his room opened. Light from the hallway streamed in. John stood in the doorway. “You all right? I heard something.”
“Let me rephrase,” Mrs. Hudson said. “Sherlock needs you.” Sherlock avoided John’s gaze by looking at his cup.
Sherlock sat up with a cry. He was breathing heavily. His sheets were tangled around his legs, his hands twisted in them. His shirt was soaked through with sweat.
Sherlock sighed and glanced at the clock. He had put Rosie into bed over three hours ago. It was now midnight.
“Oh,” Sherlock said. “I have no intention of actually listening to Mycroft. Our agreement still stands.”
.” Sherlock tried to keep his voice steady, but the look on John’s face told him he was unsuccessful.
Sherlock’s lips were warm against his. John’s hands were clutching Sherlock’s coat. He breathed in the scent of
Sherlock blinked, his expression unreadable. When he spoke, his voice was unsteady. “Thank you, John.” John placed his hand on Sherlock’s shoulder. The warmth of it seeped through his dressing gown. His shoulder was strong under John’s hand, shaking slightly. Sherlock looked at his hand. He didn’t shrug it off. John took a step closer. He didn’t take his hand off.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “I didn’t mean to. You can ask Wiggins. Where is Wiggins, anyways?” He glanced around before remembering Wiggins left him.
“I’m proud to be the first.” John slowly stroked Sherlock’s back. “Today wasn’t a terrible Christmas Eve after all.”
The syringe was prepared. Everything was prepared. Sherlock rolled up his sleeve. He wasn’t entirely certain where Wiggins had gone. No matter, he was irrelevant. He could feel his heart racing, anticipating the feeling. It had been a while since he had last been high. He picked up the syringe slowly, cautiously, making sure not to spill any. He poised the needle above his forearm, then lowered it slowly. The initial prick hurt a little, but he was used to it. He pushed down the plunger, slowly. No going back now.
Sherlock rose from his chair and knelt at John’s feet, placing one hand on his knee and looking up at him. That movement wasn’t exactly planned, and the look on John’s face was one of alarm. Sherlock had done it, though, and now he had to go with it. “John. You made a mistake. That’s all it was. A mistake.” It was the first step to healing. Comfort John now, sort out his own feelings later. Push down the anger and wait. John was more important. “It was a terrible mistake, but it doesn’t make you a bad person.”
“Will you stop being so difficult?” John didn’t mean for the words to come out quite that way, but Sherlock immediately shut up. Shame flushed through him. “Sorry.” Sherlock waved for him to continue. “When I was seventeen, my dad caught me.” He looked at Sherlock, prompted for him to deduce. When Sherlock said nothing, he continued. “It was...with my friend. My best friend, at the time, actually. His name was-is?-Christopher.”
Sherlock entered his mind palace. The hallways were dark and gloomy, many of the rooms barred and locked. Including John’s. He briefly considered deleting John’s wing entirely, but couldn’t bear to erase him completely. Sentiment. Weakness.
Sherlock decided to archive the entire interaction in his Mind Palace. He spent an extra long time on the feeling of being held. He hadn’t been held in a long time. He decided he quite liked the feeling, like he always did when John hugged him.
Smith put a hand around Sherlock’s throat. He wasn’t squeezing, not yet, but holding it in a show of dominance. “Say it. Say you don’t want to die.” Sherlock didn’t comply. His mind whirled, trying to get out of the predicament. He wished for John. “Say it.” His voice lowered, his hand tightening a little.
He pulled out his phone to text them all Merry Christmas, but stopped when he saw the time. Three forty-seven. Too early for anyone else to be up.
“You were quite rude.” Sherlock said this as if it were a fact, which in a way it was. No anger, no emotion. Just like he would be telling John that the bills needed to be paid, or the fridge needed to be cleaned.
The rush took him quickly. His hands quivered, the empty syringe on the table taunting him. His thoughts sped up, flashed in his head. His eyelids twitched when he closed them, racing through the hallways of his mind palace. He was looking for John before he realised it, but the wing was closed. That was weird. He fell to the ground, slamming his fist on the door.
The next morning, Sherlock woke up to John clinging onto him. He was deeply asleep. Sherlock didn’t move, not even a little. He just waited. Soon enough, John woke up and smiled at him.
“Please let me finish,” John interrupted. “Turn back around.” Sherlock did, keeping his spine and shoulders ramrod-straight. He was tense, John noticed. Afraid that John would do something insensitive. “I’m not upset with you in any way,” John added, and Sherlock visibly relaxed. Good. “Now that that’s out of the way. You’ve changed my life, Sherlock, and I mean that in a good way. As you’ve probably deduced, I was planning on ending my life before we met. Then you came into my life and everything changed. You made me feel like I had a purpose, that I was doing something that made everything worth it. I-I don’t know how to thank you for that. And I know I’ve hurt you, I know I have. I regret all of it, Sherlock. Everything I’ve done. You didn’t deserve it, and everyone else hurt you too, and that’s not alright. It’s not okay with me. I just don’t understand why they don’t see you like I see you. Because to me, you’re the most important person I know. Well, you and Rosie,” he amended, laughing a little. Sherlock didn’t move. “And-I know I’m difficult, you’ve put up with hell from me, especially in the last year with what I was going through, and I just wanted to say thank you. Because you, Sherlock Holmes, have given me life again. You’ve given me everything I could ever have asked for. And I love you. So…” John knelt down on his knee and pulled out the little box. He opened it, displaying a slip of paper. Sherlock didn’t move. John’s heart momentarily leapt into his throat before he realized that he had never told Sherlock to turn back around. “You can look now.” John gave a little laugh as Sherlock slowly spun around, taking in the sight. “Will you marry me, love?”
“How? How, Sherlock? How can you be okay? If I lost someone like that, I’d be devastated.” He couldn’t help but think of losing Sherlock when he said that, how broken he would be.
“John, you were alone and grieving and rightfully blamed me for your wife’s death. How was I expected to know what to do?”
Mrs. Hudson answered the door, looking quite alarmed. Her bathrobe was tied tightly around her waist. She clearly had been about to go to bed. Sherlock didn’t care. “What are you doing out here?” she said.
Sherlock hung up, turning to face himself in the mirror. His heart thrummed through his chest. As much as he told himself that it wasn’t a date, he couldn’t help but feel like it was one. At any rate, he needed to look his best.
“I shared a bed with you for a week,” John said. The side of his mouth quirked up. “Was that not clear?”
He sank into his chair, letting his eyes glaze over as he stared at Sherlock’s. After what felt like hours but was probably just twenty minutes, he gave up and called Mycroft.
His head had begun to ache, but the cool air and rain helped slightly. He walked with no real purpose, but eventually found himself near Westminster Bridge. He shook his head and silently cursed himself for coming back here. He leaned against the stone wall overlooking the river. The lights from the aquarium reflected off the black water. He squeezed his eyes shut and ground his hand into his temples, trying to steady himself. He was only moderately honest to John. It was because of him that Sherlock left Baker Street. However, John of course hadn’t done anything wrong by telling him. It was just...overwhelming.
Pity. Sherlock hated pity. John wasn’t gay. John kept telling him that he wasn’t gay. Which hurt more than Sherlock wanted to admit. Sherlock was, in fact, gay. And there was a high possibility - okay, more than a high possibility - that he was in love with his best friend. Who was definitely, positively not gay.
“How hateful,” Sherlock said, and tried for a weak smile. The corner of John’s mouth barely twitched. Sherlock followed John back into the sitting room and settled into his chair. John remained standing.
“Is there anything-anything!-I could have done to stop you from dying?” John’s expression was hopeful.
John shook his head, noting the familiar pang. Of course Sherlock would leave eyeballs in the fridge and not tell him. He rubbed his face with his palm and wondered what exactly he would do.
Olivia bent over her with a sob, placing a gentle hand on her face. Madison’s eyes flickered open. “Mom?”
I cannot stress this enough - the motivating factor for murders is homophobia. DO NOT READ IF THIS IS A TRIGGER.
“I’m not addicted.” He panted heavily. “I’m not. Controlled usage is not usually fatal, and abstinence is not immortality.”
“Is that really what you think?” John’s heart plummeted. He had just come to realize that he wanted Sherlock, and now Sherlock might think it was all a mistake?
Sherlock managed to fall asleep, but awoke to John’s footsteps on the stairs. Not wanting to see him, he pretended to be asleep. He made sure to keep his breaths even and steady, and his eyes closed tightly. His face relaxed. John must not know he was awake. He listened as John’s footsteps paused in the doorway for a fraction too long, and fought to keep up the image. Finally, John walked across the floor. He paused in front of the music stand. Oh, fuck. John was going to see the song, was going to see the title. He was going to know everything. Rather, more than he already did.
John had been very forgiving of Sherlock. They hadn’t moved on yet from him faking his death, and Sherlock didn’t expect that John would. The hurt in John’s voice when he saw Sherlock’s body was something that he never hoped to hear again. It almost made him forget about Moriarty and tell John he was okay.
“I’m wondering if you had a meeting two nights ago, and if I could inquire about someone who’s been to one?”
John swallowed. “Come here.” He pulled Sherlock into a one-armed hug, Rosie pressed against chest. Sherlock held on. He didn’t know if this was the last time he’d ever get to hug John again. Maybe John would meet someone and spend all his time with her. He wasn’t gay, after all. John sniffed quietly in his ear.
“I can’t believe I’m saying this-fuck,” John said, his heart beating quickly, nervously. “Would you like me to stay with you tonight?”
and Sherlock had grinned into John’s hair. Sherlock had tried to stay awake, and had managed it for long enough to put every second of this into his Mind Palace, but eventually he ended up surprising himself and falling asleep. He blamed John.
“As you wish,” Sherlock said, and resumed playing. His eyes met John’s over the top of the violin, and John’s lips quirked into a small smile. Sherlock’s eyes softened.
Sherlock blinked at him. John hadn’t expected a response, not right away, so he waited. “I love you too,” Sherlock said, when he regained control of his voice. John never realised before how much he’d love hearing Sherlock say that. He wanted to have him say it over and over, for the rest of all eternity, but he settled with kissing him one more time. Sherlock glared at him when John pulled away.
John had shown interest in him, and he had-what? Made up some bullshit line about being married to his work. He laughed harshly, the sound loud in the small bathroom. He didn’t know, then, how essential John would become to him. Sherlock didn’t laugh much, before. He didn’t find much to laugh about. Deduce, yes. Insult the general population, yes. But finding something for him to be genuinely happy about was difficult. And then he was laughing, freely, joyfully, with John in the foyer after a long run through London alleys. He knew in that moment that he would never be the same. John would change him. And he had.
The restaurant was warm and noisy. Fish swam in a tank in the wall. Tropical, multicoloured. Sherlock watched them. A sick feeling came to his stomach, and he thought of the aquarium. The fish tank glowed with a similar blue light. He glanced at John. John’s eyes were fixed on it for a moment, before he tore his gaze away and joined the short line at the counter.
No. Sherlock couldn’t think about that. He couldn’t. John was unwilling to give an apology, so Sherlock would have to make do without him. He could do that. He’d done much worse, after all.
“Sherlock had a-a nightmare of sorts. I woke him up, and he seemed really disoriented. Then it got...weird.”
This was brilliant. It was perfect. He couldn’t immediately deduce what was happening from the email. He would have to go to the crime scene. His plan of staying in the flat was immediately dismissed. A case was just what he needed.
It took John months to start acting ‘normal’ around Sherlock in public (though normal was a construct) and even longer for him to get comfortable with anything else. Sherlock worked in little touches here and there, a slight brush of fingers, a nudging of arms. Every touch sent warmth coursing through John’s body, and the spikes of fear that accompanied it were lessening with each time.
And when Sherlock woke up, heart pounding, sweating, hands clenched around his blankets, he had the feeling he wouldn’t be seeing John Watson for a very long time.
The notes flowed out of him. The violin was always a good way to get his emotions out without anyone else knowing, and he found this time to be no exception. Sherlock subconsciously let his feelings for John seep into the music. The lullaby appeared to be keeping Rosie quiet. She stared at him, utterly transfixed. So he played it through a second time, then a third. Her concentration never wavered. He slipped away into his own mind, thinking about John. If he closed his eyes, he could pretend that John was also watching him and loving him. Truly loving him, the way he wanted to be loved.
It had been easy to tell when everything would change. He knew, as soon as he called John from the roof, that things would be different. Even he knew that faking his death (and worse, doing it in front of someone he cared about immensely) was considered a bit not good. He knew it, and he did it anyway. He spent the next two years waiting for the moment he could see John again. When he was being tortured, beaten to a pulp in the underground chambers of Moriarty’s secret network, the thought of John was the only thing that kept him alive. He had this elaborate plan. He would come back to John, surprise him. He was prepared for John to be angry. He thought John would get over his initial burst of anger quickly. It was what he did. Lash out, and then be cold and distant afterwards. He would go to John. He would explain everything. He had a whole speech prepared. He still had it memorised, for God’s sake.
John sighed. “Sit up.” Sherlock did so reluctantly, facing John. “Did I...did I do something to make you relapse? I don’t understand.”
John awoke the next morning to a heavy weight atop him and something tickling his nose. He sneezed. He shifted around for a moment before realising he was completely pinned down. He panicked for a second before remembering it was Sherlock, and then he grinned widely. Sometime during the night, Sherlock had drifted towards the end of the bed so his head was tucked underneath John’s chin. One arm was flung possessively around John’s torso, the other hand tucked beneath his cheek. His breathing was slow and steady. John ran a hand through Sherlock’s curls, marvelling at how soft they were.
“Shut up,” Sherlock growled, and pushed the plunger down. That was better. Now he didn’t have to worry about running out while he was investigating. He tossed the empty syringe off the roof, opposite the alley, and heard it falling down.
They sat like that for a while longer, Sherlock thinking about John. He thought about how much he loved John, and how mad he was at the same time. It was an annoying sense of juxtaposition. The worst part of it was that John didn’t love him back. He couldn’t talk to John about it because John would leave. And John wouldn’t apologise because...actually, Sherlock didn’t know why. He wanted to talk about what John did. He
Sherlock couldn’t move. If he told John not to read it, John would find a way to. He wasn’t going to destroy the waltz. He couldn’t bring himself to do that. Better to let John do what he wanted.
Sherlock put toast in the toaster for himself and for John and was about to deduce how John would like his eggs cooked when the shower shut off. He buttered the toast before turning on the stove and then sat down at the table next to Rosie. John stepped into the kitchen wearing his dressing gown.
Around six, he called Angelo. His heart beat deep in his chest. Angelo answered on the second ring. “Hello?”
When they broke apart, several minutes later, John panted and grinned at Sherlock. Sherlock smiled shyly back. “I love you,” John said.
“Right,” Sherlock said. He walked into his bedroom and flicked on the light. He tugged the curtains shut and pulled a suit out from his wardrobe. Once it was on, he smoothed out any wrinkles in the fabric and sat down on the bed. He clasped his hands together, preparing himself. One last glance around his room, and then he was up and heading back to the sitting room. John glanced him over. Sherlock adjusted his collar as John stood up.
Fourth chapter. I didn't exactly mean for this to be as long as it is, but I got invested in the case in this chapter and made it longer than expected. Which means that there will be more chapters than I’d planned for.
It took him a while to fall asleep, even when reverting to his usual techniques of listing all of the atoms in descending order by atomic numbers. His dreams that night were anything but restful. They were strange and haunting, filled with the blue light reminiscent of both the pool with Moriarty and the aquarium. John was drowning in the pool while Mary lay dying on the edge. Moriarty was pressing a gun to the nape of Sherlock’s neck. The metal was cool against his skin. He was powerless to help them. He could only watch as they died ever so slowly. He couldn’t wake himself up, couldn’t get himself to snap out of the dream. He was forced to kneel there and watch as John finally sank beneath the water.
Sherlock’s eyes widened at John’s wording. Our daughter. John, apparently unaware of what he’d said, was already at the door.
“You know,” John said. His mind was screaming at him to stop talking, just stop talking, but he couldn’t. “You-her-“ he waved vaguely.
“You weren’t alone,” Sherlock responded. John saw through him, knew that he was deflecting because he was uncertain, and decided not to argue with him on that point.
“You don’t want my breath to smell like our dinner whilst I’m kissing you, do you?” He asked. Sherlock rolled his eyes but allowed John to get up. He set his laptop on his nightstand, then slid under the covers.
Sherlock pressed a hand to his wrist, taking his pulse. Elevated. By a lot. He was terrified. Terrified that his dream would become real and John would shoot himself. It would be his preferred method, Sherlock knew. He had a gun in his old flat. Kept it in a drawer in the nightstand. Often took it out and just looked at it. It was one of the first things he’d deduced, but the only thing he’d chosen to keep to himself. He wasn’t sure why he’d made that choice, actually, but it had seemed like something he should do at the time and so he did. Maybe it was because Sherlock knew what it was like. Knew what it was like to feel like nothing and everything was happening all at once. Overwhelmed and at the same time empty.
John looked away from him. His voice, however, remained steady even though John’s hand was trembling slightly. “I never wanted this.”
He was interrupted by John entering the flat. He was so surprised that he fell into his string, tangling it. He cursed loudly and set about untangling it. “What are you doing?”
Maybe he should have moved out of the way. Maybe. But he made a vow, and he was going to uphold it to the best of his ability. If he died, so be it. John and Mary would be safe.
“Mr. Holmes.” The eerie smile was back, and rancid breath ghosted across Sherlock’s face. He shuddered, sighed, took a breath.
He needed to figure out how he felt about Sherlock. John had been in love a few times. Most noticeable was Mary. Another woman before he went into war. And Christopher. He had had crushes, and he knew what that felt like. He knew what love felt like. So why was it so complicated to know how he felt about Sherlock?
Sherlock said. His lungs felt like they were filling with water. He was drowning. He was drowning in his own emotions, and he would never resurface.
“I need to clear my head,” Sherlock told him. “I promise I won’t get high. You can call Mycroft and tell him to monitor me on CCTV if you desire.”
“You were in love with her, or something,” he snapped, jealousy filling the pit of his stomach. It wasn’t fair to Sherlock to be mad at him for that simply because of his own feelings, but he couldn’t help himself. He had struggled with jealousy before, in the past, but he never could quite remember it being this strong.
Finally, panting with body-racking sobs, he crouched down and put his back to the wall. He grasped his hair, pulling slightly, and screamed. Then screamed again.
Next update will be in either one week or two depending on how busy I am. Part of it is already prewritten, but I'd rather it be a day late than terribly written. It will go into detail about Sherlock getting high again.
“Not here,” Sherlock said, addressing Mycroft. “He left. Where did the other officer go?” He opened his eyes, not seeing the officer anywhere.
The ride to Baker Street was silent. Sherlock focused on controlling his breathing and not giving anything away. Anything he was feeling. He could feel John’s eyes on him, but decided to ignore it. John could wait. For the first time since Baskerville, Sherlock was afraid. And this time, he wasn’t drugged. He was truly afraid.
When he woke up, he was lying in a bed. Lights blinked and flickered around him. A monitor was attached to his finger. His mouth was dry. The bruise on his back hurt. Everything hurt. Breathing the most. He wasn’t attached to an IV. He lay there until the doctor showed up.
John entered the flat flustered, eyes blown wide in panic. “Sorry I’m late,” he said. “I couldn’t find a sitter for Rosie, but I didn’t want to bring her, and by the time I found someone I was over an hour late.”
“Ever since I said I was in love with you,” he said dully. “I’ll take it back, if that is what you would like. We can pretend it never happened. I’ve hid it for years, no reason why I can’t now.”
“What would you like?” He asked her. She giggled in response. “Bach? Mendelssohn? Mozart? Brahms?” She clapped her hands together at Brahms. “Good choice.
So here we are. They still aren't talking. I mean, you can't really blame Sherlock. No one wants to hear rejection. And about the song - I sort of envisioned it as a combination of the songs "Waltz for John and Mary" (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Qx3B4T2mw) and "Who You Really Are" (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEFJDnLJrng). It is a love song that Sherlock wrote for John, and he just had to play it. John doesn't know Sherlock was awake. And Mrs. Hudson seems to know a lot more than she let on...
The door to 221 slammed loudly behind him as Sherlock stormed up the seventeen steps to their flat. John closed his book and laid it in his lap, only half convincing himself that he had actually read it. He twisted in his chair to greet Sherlock as he stopped in the doorway. “Oh, hi.” Sherlock narrowed his eyes and scanned the flat, his eyes moving rapidly back and forth. “You okay?”
John came back, breath smelling like mint. Sherlock had to admit that it was a much more pleasant smell. He joined Sherlock under the covers. “So.”
It warmed him up a bit though, and after a while he shut the water off. He got dressed quickly and walked out to the sitting room, flexing his fingers. Mrs. Hudson had left him a cup of tea on the table by the window. He felt a strange surge of emotion at the sight of it. He picked it up, curling his fingers around it, and sat down in his chair. One light was on. The fireplace was cold and empty. John’s chair taunted him from across the room. John should be in it right now, but he was somewhere else in London grieving his wife while Sherlock was grieving too.
He closed his eyes. His breathing slowed down to something resembling normal. “It’s okay, Sherlock,” John murmured.
John looked at him steadily. “It is. Since when have we been traditional? Besides. If I had gotten you a ring now, then after the wedding you’d have two and I’d have one. We match this way.”
“John. Listen to me. You made a terrible mistake. But beating yourself up about it isn’t going to help either of us. It’s just going to make you feel bad.”
because thinking leads to emotions and he didn’t want emotions. He felt the spiral of anxiety start to pick up, and he inhaled deeply. It didn’t help. He set the cigarette in the ashtray on the windowsill and fell onto his bed. He tucked his knees up and hugged them. Whatever was happening with John wasn’t okay. He was upset, heartbroken really, because he had had John. Right there. And then John was taken from him by something, something that made John not like him. Something must be wrong with him, besides, well, everything. Because John kissed him, but then he threw up afterwards.
“Remember what I said, Sherlock. Caring is not an advantage,” Mycroft said, softly. Sherlock said nothing.
Sorry for the long wait. I had writer's block (ugh) and was surprisingly busy and all in all it was not conducive to writing. Sorry again. And sorry some of the updates took a longer time than I would've liked. Thank you for your patience.
“No!” He heard Sherlock’s cry. Almost as a reflex, John shot at the man holding the gun. Almost in slow motion, the man fell over backwards. John raced towards the crouching figure, hearing sirens behind him. Greg was a little late.
he silently added. He wasn’t sure if Sherlock would appreciate the sentiment. He flashed back to what he had heard last night, but he wasn’t certain if it was a dream or not. Sherlock pushed himself into a sitting position. John frowned at him. “Where are you going?”
“I thought we established that I wasn’t,” Sherlock said softly, feeling his heart shatter at the words.
Molly blinked away a tear and reached into her pocket. She pulled out a folded piece of paper. “It’s, uh, it’s from John.” She handed it to him. He took it and glanced down. Interesting. Not what he had been expecting, not at all. He supposed it was a positive sign. Or a very negative one.
“I don’t want your help.” He spit the words at her, but she didn’t move away. Why didn’t she move away?
“I’m not. But you have to come to that conclusion on your own. Sherlock, please. Mycroft told me to make sure you didn’t start using again.” Her voice was stern again.
“You heard wrong,” Sherlock said, refusing to meet his eyes. His pulse quickened and his hands started to sweat.
As soon as Sherlock heard the water start running, he put a recording of his own playing into the radio. He set it to play, and then as quietly as he could, put on his coat and left the house.
“Why? You’re my best friend. Of course I love you,” John said, his eyebrow raising and his mouth pressing into a line.
“Okay. Fine. I can’t believe I’m saying this, but fine. Just...text if you’re not going to be back in the morning, okay?”
When he got back to the flat, he made the decision to remove John’s chair. He picked it up and dragged it up the stairs, setting it just outside of John’s bedroom. He couldn’t bring himself to go into John’s bedroom. Not yet. It was too
“You can be remarkably thick sometimes, you know that?” Sherlock told him, echoing his own words from that night.
Sherlock tried to protest, he tried to say something, but all that came out was a muffled groan. He had the vague sensation of being carried down the stairs and shoved into a car. His vision blackened and he was falling, deeper, wondering if John would come to save him.
Finally, his breaths evened out and Sherlock allowed himself to finally let his emotions get the better of him. “I don’t want you to leave,” he whispered. He manoeuvred himself so that his face was pressed into John’s chest. Then he let the tears fall. They dampened John’s shirt (not good, not good, what if he wakes up) but he couldn’t stop. That hurt. A lot more than he wanted to admit. He hoped, previously, that John would simply move in without a lot of discussion about it.
Sherlock hadn’t planned on sleeping, but to his surprise, he was exhausted. His eyelids drooped. He felt himself beginning to doze, sinking deeper into the couch. The noise from the telly washed over him. “Go to bed,” John said, glancing at him.
“It’s okay, Sherlock,” John said softly. “I’ve lost many people. In the Army. It’s not an easy thing to go through.”
He strode into his bedroom and over to his closet, pulling out one of his best suits. A light grey shirt, black jacket, black trousers, black socks. He smoothed the shirt out with his hands before tugging off the one he was wearing and replacing it. His stomach churned nervously. He hung his dressing gown up and finished changing, then stepped neatly into the loo. He combed his hair, tousling it, all the while thinking about how ridiculous he was being. It wasn’t a date, and even if it was, it was with John. John, who had seen him in any manner of ways and looking like hell.
“I already gave you my forgiveness. That night in the tube. Where you lied again.” That was a low blow, and Sherlock knew John knew that. Sherlock also knew he deserved it.
“If you’ve come to tell me not to go, don’t bother.” Sherlock rolled back over. John’s hand was still on his shoulder.
His tuxedo fit perfectly, and if Sherlock was being honest, it was a much better suit than the one he had worn at his previous wedding. He smiled shyly at Sherlock, and when Sherlock grinned back his smile widened. He seemed to de-age, years lost as he walked up the aisle. Time slowed until it was just the two of them, John coming to join Sherlock up on the altar. He walked slowly, and Sherlock was okay with that, savoring every moment. He would be sure to go back to it later on in his Mind Palace. For now, he stayed in the present.
Mary was collapsed against a low wall, gasping. Blood had spread across her chest in the same position where she had shot him, but there was so much more of it. He rushed to her side, bending over, looking into her eyes.
he had said. And of course, there was the almost death. He would be lying if he said that didn’t bother him. He had been certain he would die, and those brief minutes when he didn’t believe John would come were awful. He rocked back and forth and wished for the moment to end. Anxiety attacks were rare occurrences for Sherlock, but not unheard of, and he hadn’t had once in years.
“He was an alleged sex offender,” Sherlock growled, reaching for the scalpel. “And you are the vilest-the most repulsive-” his hand shook. “The most repulsive human scum I have ever met.” The letters coalesced around him to form the words
Thank you for your comments so far. It makes me incredibly happy to see that people like my work enough to comment. :)
“Why are we here?” He gestured around the room. “You hate going out in public unless it’s to solve crimes. You hate this restaurant.”
“I may have been wrong.” Sherlock raised his eyebrows. “Perhaps caring could be an advantage, in certain situations. You and Doctor Watson may be an example of that.” Mycroft released Sherlock’s arm and adjusted his tie, very uncomfortable. Sherlock was too overcome with emotion to speak, but Mycroft seemed to understand. “Congratulations, brother mine.”
“Yeah. Yesterday. What I said to you, that wasn’t okay.” John fidgeted with his fork. “It was wrong of me to say that you’d do drugs around Rosie. I know you wouldn’t. I just panicked.”
“What?” Sherlock blinked at him. That was not at all what he had been expecting. He did want an apology, yes, but not necessarily for yesterday. An apology for sending him to the hospital might be nice. Or one for blaming Sherlock for Mary’s death (partially his fault, but he didn’t choose for her to jump in front of him so it wasn’t all on him). But he listened anyway, because it was John.
Everything sort of went back to normal after that, with the exception of Rosie. Having a child around was strange, but Sherlock found himself caring for Rosie. She was, after all, John’s child, and anything John-related was good. With the obvious exception of his girlfriends.
The sick feeling in Sherlock’s stomach only increased when John got out of the cab without talking to him, leaving Sherlock to pay the cabbie. Sherlock took his time going up the steps, hearing John say goodnight to Mrs. Hudson. Sherlock slipped into the flat as John brought Rosie up to his bedroom to put her to bed.
“Yeah, right,” John said. “I’ll make something for us to eat.” And maybe there was disappointment in his voice as well.
“I can deduce enough. Based on what you told me, I know enough about him to know that you’re not him.”
“You faked your own death!” John’s voice rose until he was shouting. “You let me grieve you for two bloody years! That’s a lie!”
Sherlock’s ears filled with white noise. He stared at the phone in his hand. John and Rosie would spend Christmas with him? “Excuse me?” Sherlock asked when he could speak again.
Sherlock blinked back tears and held his head high. He opted not to call a cab. He had been walking a lot more than usual. Cabs were painful. He only took one if he really thought he needed to, such as he did after Ella’s.
Sherlock didn’t realise how much he would miss John until he was gone. His urge to be with John was growing stronger each day. He needed John. He sunk to the bottom of the tub, wrapping his arms around his knees. Water streamed over him, flowed down his back and into his eyes. He wanted to crawl into John’s arm, press his face into John’s shoulder, feel safe again. He missed the fleeting touches. He missed the freedom they had on John’s stag night, when John’s inhibitions were lowered and he was feeling braver. Missed sitting next to him on the couch, his arm around John, John pressed up against his side. He needed a hug. He needed to be held. It was quite ironic, really, that the one time he got what he wanted was at John’s wedding.
“Neither did I.” Sherlock managed to sound steady even through the swirl of emotions building inside him.
“Sorry,” Sherlock said, not feeling particularly sorry. “I thought you were someone else.” His head spun. Everything slowed down. It was possible that he had taken too much of whatever substance Wiggins had prepared.
They both lay still in the quiet for a while. Warmth seemed to radiate from John’s body. His presence was, as always, comforting. John’s breath evened out. Until finally, he spoke.
“Please do,” Sherlock said softly. He placed a hesitant hand on John’s shoulder. John didn’t move away from the contact but he didn’t lean into it, either. After an awkward moment Sherlock removed his hand, face burning with shame. “All right. I’ll be back.”
He pressed his lips together. They quirked upwards, once, briefly, his expression flickering. “It’s all right.” He closed his eyes, kept them closed for as long as he dared. Opened them to see Mary looking worse by the second.
John’s eyes blazed angrily. “Wouldn’t you? I wouldn’t put it past you,” he growled. “You’re an addict. Don’t pretend you’re not.”
he wanted to add, but didn’t. Sherlock still looked uncertain, but set his violin down and held his arms loosely at his sides. John took that as an invitation to take a hesitant step towards him. Sherlock enveloped him in his arms, and-oh. That was nice. Better than John helplessly clutching at his shirt. Their torsos were pressed together, Sherlock’s cheek resting on the top of John’s head. It was incredibly intimate. John wasn’t sure why Sherlock was doing that, why they suddenly became the type of people who did that, but he never wanted to leave his arms.
Sherlock flushed. “What? No. The opposite, actually.” His voice caught a little. He prayed Angelo couldn’t tell through the phone. “I need you to not say anything. It’s not a date. It never will be a date. I don’t want to risk his friendship by people assuming we’re a couple.”
Sherlock was at a loss for words. He had no idea John went through all of that. If he’d really tried, he could’ve figured it out, but something always stopped him. It was John’s personal business. Not his. He suspected his restraint might have something to do with the fact that he was deeply in love with him. “I’m sorry,” he said softly, and reached out his hand to touch John’s. He didn’t care what it looked like. John’s entire body was trembling. Sherlock left his fingertips on top of John’s.
“Yes, please,” Sherlock said. He wanted to defend himself, to say he wasn’t that out of it, just surprised. He refrained. John disappeared into the kitchen, then returned with two glasses. He handed one to Mrs. Hudson and the other to Sherlock. Their fingers brushed briefly, and lightning sparked through Sherlock’s hand. John settled back on the couch. Sherlock took a small drink.
Mary could barely speak, ragged breaths being pulled out of her mouth, chest heaving, tears streaking her face. “I think we’re even, definitely even.” She stuttered, sobbing, gasping, holding on by a thread. She turned back to John. “You were my whole world.” John threw his head back, face contorting, grieving. No light left in his expression, just rawness, exposed. John ducked his head. Sherlock couldn’t see his face. Didn’t even want to see his face. “Being Mary Watson…” she gulped, paused. John lifted his head slightly. A vein throbbed in his forehead. “Was the only life worth living.” She choked the words out. “Thank you.” John nodded, once, twice. He breathed deeply, unnaturally. Her head dipped.
“I’m sorry. I should have said thank you.” Oh. “I appreciate you doing this. It’s very considerate.” Sherlock’s heartbeat sped up, so much so that he thought John must be able to hear it from across the table. “I should have started with that, yeah?” John tried for a laugh. It came out sounding more like a choke. “Sorry. I’m sorry.” He removed his fingers from Sherlock’s wrist.
“Go,” John said, finally. “Just go.” His voice was breaking, cracking, shattering. Sherlock’s stomach hardened and twisted. He felt like he might vomit.
He wasn’t certain how long John was going to be away. It could be for the morning, it could be for the day, it could be for several days. He rolled out of bed, changed into pyjama pants and his dressing gown, and made his way into the kitchen. He took his pack of cigarettes from his dresser.
Sherlock walked over and took a seat in his chair. “Kindly refrain from discussing matters you don’t know the full story to,” he said, well aware it was rude.
Back at Baker Street, Sherlock collapsed on the couch feeling worse than before. He scribbled down a measurement and then injected again. Now was not the time to be sober.
Sherlock couldn’t help the faint blush that rose in his cheeks, but he merely said, “I told you, I don’t want to talk about that.”
John raised his head up and Sherlock made a small noise of alarm. He locked eyes with Sherlock, noting that the light from the fire nearly turned them grey, beautiful. Damn it. They were still standing much too close, Sherlock’s arms wrapped around John’s waist. If the hug was intimate, the eye contact was a thousand times more so. “Merry Christmas, John,” Sherlock whispered to him. John’s head swam, and the next words out of his mouth weren’t even close to planned.
“I do,” Sherlock said, and slid the other ring onto John’s finger. A tear managed to slip down his cheek, and he blinked it away, never breaking eye contact with John. John’s expression was so soft, so tender. Sherlock never wanted to look away.
Sherlock fidgeted with his napkin, folding and unfolding it. John seemed unable to meet his eyes, the awkwardness of the flirting catching up to both of them. If it really was flirting. Sherlock didn’t know. He didn’t allow himself to know, because what if John was just being nice? John was usually a very nice person-usually-but would that extend to compliments? Sherlock didn’t want to think about it.
Sherlock stayed as still as possible. John couldn’t wake up. Being vulnerable at night was one thing, but waking up like this would surely disturb him. Rosie didn’t wake up either, leaving Sherlock to be able to feel comfortable being with John, even if it was only for a very short time.
She ignored his request and pulled out a piece of paper. “It says here you have an addiction to cocaine.”
“He’s...in love with me.” John couldn’t help the small quirk of his lips at this. If he was honest, he quite liked the idea of Sherlock being in love with him.
Sherlock sat with a huff, keeping his eyes locked straight ahead. “What is it, then? Thought it over? Figured the kiss last night was adrenaline? That it never should have happened?”
“I’m not high.” Sherlock’s voice was a lot quieter than usual, and John realized that in fact he wasn’t actually high. He was sad. His eyes weren’t red from drugs, his eyes were red from crying. Shame radiated through his body. Again, he was jumping to conclusions about Sherlock’s state of sobriety.
All right. Obviously this is up two weeks late and I'm sorry for that. My laptop broke, and then I was going through some things. Maybe the extra-long length makes up for it? I hoped to have this up around Christmas, as it's a Christmas chapter, but that didn't work. It was also originally going to be part of Chapter Eight but since that would've been long I had to cut it. Even this is a little longer than I would've liked, but there wasn't a good place to cut it so here we are. As always, hopefully the next update will be within two weeks, but life happens so I guess I'll just have to see.
The cab ride to Molly’s was brief. Sherlock locked himself away back in his mind palace to continue filing-there was
“Stand up.” Sherlock stood up and placed his cup on the table beside his chair. John crossed the room in a step, roughly grabbing Sherlock’s hand. His hand was warm. Again, electricity laced through Sherlock where John had touched him. He curled his fingers around John’s hand. It might be the last time he’d ever have contact with John, so he would take advantage of it. John flipped his hand over and pushed up his sleeve. Sherlock wanted to tell him not to do that, not to look and see what he had done, but he could only watch as John sucked in a breath. His forearm was a mess. Small bruises everywhere, the skin broken and bleeding in the place where he’d injected earlier. So he wasn’t as gentle as he’d tried to be. “You weren’t lying.”
All too soon, John stirred from his position on Sherlock’s chest. Sherlock closed his eyes and hoped fervently that he looked asleep.
The bright sunlight woke John up, and he squinted. The sheets smelled familiar, comforting, and with a start he realized that he had actually fallen asleep in Sherlock’s bed. Sherlock would be incredibly angry with him. He turned his head automatically to see if Sherlock was next to him. He wasn’t. With a sigh, John slid out of bed, surprised that he didn’t hear strains of a violin coming from the living room.
“Sherlock, I really don’t know if they actually are murders. It could just be a coincidence.” John sighed. He turned a page.
He hated Sherlock. Those days were the loneliest days he had ever lived through. They were worse than the days after he’d dropped out of University, the first time he became addicted.
Sherlock hung up. “Time to go, John.” John asked asked Mrs. Hudson to keep an eye on Rosie, who was sleeping, then they took a cab to Bromley.
The bullet wound had been neat, carefully placed at his left temple. A cry sounded in the small bedroom, and Sherlock jumped before realising it was him. He rubbed his hands over his face.
John hit him in the face, right above his eyebrow. It hurt instantly. His head cracked against the edge of the table, hard enough to break the skin. He was fairly certain his face was bleeding as well. Nausea rushed over him and he coughed. The cup of water fell off and broke on the ground, soaking into his trousers. John hit him again, this time in the jaw. Sherlock’s jaw was clenched in pain, so the punch itself didn’t hurt too much. The one to his nose right afterwards did, though. He didn’t think it was broken, but it hurt like hell. He crumpled to the floor, resisting the urge to wipe the blood trickling into his eye.
He composed it the night he came home from the wedding. He had come home, alone. He was preparing himself to almost never see John again. Sherlock had known previously that it would hurt, but he didn’t expect it to hurt like this. He had collapsed into his chair and shut his eyes.
Excitement thrumming through his veins, he picked up the needle from the table. He missed this. God, he missed this. With shaking fingers, Sherlock plunged the needle in. He thought he could
John inhaled sharply, then pressed a hand over his mouth. Shit. He glanced over at Sherlock, who thank god, luckily hadn’t moved. John could only stare at the paper in his hand. He didn’t know when Sherlock had even written this. He knew it hadn’t been used to teach
“You’re the best thing that happened to me as well,” John whispered. “I was so alone, and I owe you so much.”
“You bought it for me.” John laughed against his lips. “Of course it’s soft.” His phone buzzed and he reluctantly pushed Sherlock away. Mycroft, John mouthed. Sherlock rolled his eyes. “Hello?”
“I can’t believe you did this to me. Not only once, but twice. Twice you stole someone I loved, made me watch them fucking die.”
“I haven’t the faintest idea what you mean,” he said, and closed his fingers around Sherlock’s wrist. Sherlock’s skin prickled and he twisted, but Smith didn’t let go.
John cleared his throat when the silence became unbearable. “I’m going to go get Rosie’s things settled. Do I need to get a cot for her?” His voice was clipped.
John stared at the ground, wondering what went wrong. What he said. One second, Sherlock’s head was on his shoulder, and the next he was storming out of the house, not telling John where he was going. That in itself wasn’t surprising, as Sherlock didn’t often tell John where he was going - but he rarely, if ever, left like that. The only logical conclusion he could come to was that Sherlock was upset with him for some reason. But Sherlock tried very hard not to get upset, at least not visibly.
He gave her a weak smile. “Please do not mention John.” She nodded. “Oh, and if I get too-too full of myself, or too arrogant, please just say ‘Norbury.’”
After some manoeuvring, Sherlock’s head was on John’s lap and he was stretched across the couch. John was carding his fingers through Sherlock’s hair, his feet propped up on their coffee table next to their wine glasses. “I was flirting with you at Angelo’s,” John said absentmindedly.
He blindly walked to the door, throwing on his coat and grabbing his scarf. John’s voice called to him, but he was already out the door.
“No. I’m sorry.” Sherlock didn’t respond. John walked over and handed him a cup of tea. He took it, but did not drink. John sat next to him on the couch. Sherlock moved further away. “I guess we should talk.”
Sherlock’s sleep was restless, full of dreams about John. Thankfully, none about Eurus. John flitted in and out, sometimes yelling at him, sometimes walking away, sometimes telling Sherlock that he loved him and would never leave him. Sherlock awoke feeling barely rested, his eyes heavy and his brain moving a bit slower than usual. Which was very annoying, he reflected. Feeling too brain-dead to move, he instead opted to stare at the ceiling until Mycroft knocked on his door, hours later.
Sherlock’s stomach sank. That meant it couldn’t have been good. He assumed Molly had read it, or at least had a fairly good idea of what it said, judging by her expression. Pity. She tried for a shaky smile. “I’m sorry, Sherlock.” His stomach sank even further. “He says...John says if you were to come round, asking after him, offering to help…” she paused. Sherlock tightened his hand around the note.
He fell backwards and curled up in a ball on John’s bed. Slipping under the covers felt too intimate and he shivered in the cool air. His chest heaved. Crying didn’t help his already-difficult breathing and he gasped for air. John hated him. He already knew that, of course, but now the last bits of hope were ebbing away. He coughed into the jumper, the damp patch growing every minute. John’s wing of the mind palace appeared, unbidden, and he tried to lock the door. It opened, John’s terrible expression staring at him. Pain ghosted over him as he replayed the fight. He could feel each kick, each punch. It was all so real. What seemed like hours later, but could have been minutes or even seconds, his eyes drooped closed and he fell asleep.
“I’ll be quiet. I won’t even play the violin. You can have my room if you’d like.” Sherlock pleaded with him. John was too tired. He cursed himself for missing it earlier and not telling John he’d call someone else. John was very close to getting fired from the clinic-not that he knew that-and falling asleep during work hours might be enough to cost him his job. And that wouldn’t be okay.
I have a few fics planned out for the future, but they're mostly one-shots. Not all in the Sherlock fandom, either, which I'm looking forward to.
The takeaway was even better than Sherlock had remembered. He told John (who was using Sherlock’s card) to tip them extra, a lot extra, for working during a holiday. John looked amazed at that, until Sherlock reminded him that he wasn’t a complete arsehole all the time. Then he just looked chastised.
Once when Sherlock was very little, Mummy and Daddy took him and Mycroft to Maine. This was during his pirate phase, and he loved all of the lobster boats. He didn’t love eating the lobsters, but he was fascinated by the boats. The Holmes’s had an old family friend there, one who lived on one of the islands, and he allowed Sherlock to go lobstering with him.
They met at a little cafe, a few blocks away from Baker Street. He hugged her. “How’s rehab going?” He asked her when they separated. She tapped Rosie’s nose and Rosie giggled.
John awkwardly cleared his throat. “I need to call a cab.” Sherlock made a noise of agreement. “I’ll see you sometime, okay?”
“Too bad, Sherlock. I have questions.” Sherlock steepled his hands. There really wasn’t a way to avoid John’s questions.
Sunlight blinded him. He held up a hand to shield his eyes, walking quickly. He needed to get away. Needed to be anywhere but here. Anywhere but the dark room, too hot and too cold all at once. Somewhere where he didn’t have to hear John tell Mycroft all the ways he hated Sherlock.
“Sorry, Mr. Holmes, I can’t do that.” His voice was smooth in Sherlock’s ear, and Sherlock vomited onto the table. The substance filled his mouth and he spat, once, to get rid of it. He was in agony. Every atom in his body burned.
The morning of the wedding dawned bright. Sherlock awoke in their rented house, sun streaming through the window. John’s arm was flung across his chest, John himself fast asleep. Sherlock couldn’t help but study John, watching him sleep. The morning of their wedding day.
It’s not clever. At all.” John neglected to respond. Sherlock managed to stay quiet for another moment.
“Visiting Mary’s grave. Obviously,” he said. Shit. The high was starting to wear away. Lestrade would surely notice.
John followed Mycroft up the stairs. He barely had time to marvel at the grandeur of it all because Mycroft was walking extremely quickly. Mycroft stopped abruptly in front of a plain white door. Shut. He nodded for John to go in, and John swallowed.
“You think I don’t know that?” Sherlock struggled to sit up. Pain flared through his body. “You think I’m unaware of what I’m doing?”
“Shut up, I’m trying to think.” The first murder - Maida Vale. The second - Elthorne Park. The third - Old Compton Street. The fourth - North Peckham Estate. And the fifth - Clapham Common. He clenched his jaw in frustration. There was a common factor, he knew there was. He let out a quiet shout of frustration and opened his eyes.
Sherlock could see the back of his head. He was wearing a black suit jacket. The collar of his dress shirt was black as well. It matched with his own. Sherlock wished he could be sitting next to John, comforting him. He stared at John for so long that he almost missed Mycroft, sitting in the very back. Only ten feet away from Sherlock. He squinted. It couldn’t be Mycroft. Yet it was. He sat stone-still, his back turned to Sherlock. That wasn’t great. Sherlock was counting on John’s obliviousness and everyone else’s to be able to attend the funeral unnoticed, but Mycroft would know. Mycroft always knew. Too late to do anything about it, Sherlock sighed and hoped Mycroft wouldn’t say anything to John or to anyone else.
“Can you take her? I have to go to Tesco,” he said. “We need something more to eat than this.” John looked beyond stressed. His eyes were wide and his mouth was pressed in a thin line.
“Yes,” Sherlock said. “I need you.” He thought perhaps that was the most honest he had been in weeks. It was the first time he had admitted to himself how lost he was without John. The first time he allowed himself to grieve over the loss of his best friend without feeling overwhelming guilt. He would not cry. He wouldn’t. He was stronger than that. He stood up and faced John.
He unwound his scarf from his neck and took off his coat. John did the same. Sherlock’s breath caught in his throat, and whatever he’d been about to say died on his lips. John looked, well, beautiful. His hair was cut shorter than it’d been when Mary died-it had been like that for a while now, reminiscent of their earlier days together-but he’d styled it more than he used to. He was wearing a dark red jumper, the collar of his shirt peeking out over it. Sherlock couldn’t get over the John-Watsonness of the entire outfit.
“Yes?” He was so, so close. John dipped his head a little closer and Sherlock stopped breathing. Then-
“Nobody’s been in this flat besides us,” Wiggins said from beside the counter. “It was a hallucination.”
Ever so slowly, Sherlock leaned in. He was tired of pretending that he didn’t want to kiss John, that he didn’t love John. He gave John enough time to push him away, but John didn’t. When at last he kissed John-finally,
up. His best friend, the only person he truly loved, was gone. Hated him. For killing his wife, and now for developing feelings for him. He hit the floor again, pushing himself up. Pain radiated up his arm, and he struggled to push himself to his knees. He clutched at the table.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “John, I have loved you for years. That didn’t change, even when we weren’t talking. It’s never going to change.”
His stomach dropped instantly. He couldn’t do it, couldn’t listen. He wanted Mycroft to shut up. “I’m sorry, John.” Mycroft kept talking, but a buzzing sound filled John’s ears. He had heard enough. He knew. He hung up.
“I don’t want to die.” But he did. He did want to die, he wanted the pain to be over. He hated how dependent he was on John, hated that he was feeling like this simply because of John. He swallowed.
Sherlock didn’t acknowledge it, too deep in his mind palace. He hadn’t been sure of what to expect when he’d arrived at the funeral. He had no way of knowing just how utterly painful it would be. He took a shaky breath and envisioned John’s pain-wracked face. He had caused that. He was the reason John even had to attend the funeral. He should have immediately arrested Norbury, should have done something, anything to avoid her shooting at him.
Mycroft rested a hand on Sherlock’s arm. Sherlock narrowed his eyes at him. He clearly wanted something from Sherlock. “I just wanted to say.” Mycroft cleared his throat. Sherlock didn’t drop his gaze. “I have always believed that caring is not an advantage.”
“I love you,” John said again. Sherlock longed to reciprocate, but couldn’t. Not now. Not in Mary’s house. “I love you so much.” Sherlock held him a little tighter.
“You’re here now,” Sherlock said. “And I’m clean. I want to be clean. I don’t want to go through that again.”
said one, but due to the details in the email Sherlock was able to deduce that he was actually attending chemotherapy and hiding it extraordinarily well by staying overnight at his brother’s house-and the sender was actually the one who was cheating.
“No. But I am your brother. And as such, I will have you transferred tomorrow. I sense your injuries are healing nicely?” Sherlock remained silent. His injuries were, in fact, healing quite well. His ribs had re-broken after the fight with Smith, and the stitches above his eyebrow popped, but they were beginning to feel better. His bruises had mostly healed. “Sherlock.” Mycroft sighed. “I am only doing this because I care about you.”
“Sherlock. Look. Honestly, I’m very angry at you right now and you’re not making it any easier. Just explain. Or leave.”
“John,” Sherlock said, gravely. “The groom is not supposed to see the bride. You’re not the bride, and I’m certainly not the bride. You can see me.”
This was how he was going to die. In an aquarium, of all places. Defending his best friend’s wife. Who was an assassin. Who shot him. He could have laughed at the absurdity of it.
“John wasn’t here, Sherlock,” she said sternly, and he realised it was just another hallucination. Relief flooded him.
“No.” Sherlock sat upright. “I can’t, sorry.” He struggled to sit up, but the nurse held him down by the shoulder. Sherlock pressed his palm against his head.
Sherlock interrupted him. “Please.” Soft, pleading. John couldn’t blog about this case. Not this one.
Sherlock pushed himself off the couch and stumbled into his bedroom. John lowered the volume until Sherlock could barely hear it. His presence in the other room was comforting. Sherlock changed into pyjamas, climbed into bed, and promptly fell asleep.
“Why are you here, anyways?” Sherlock spoke to Mrs. Hudson, figuring she’d be the nicest, but it wasn’t her who answered it.
Sherlock exhaled. He couldn’t be certain John was telling the truth. Things always happened, things he couldn’t prepare for, but he was certain that John meant his promise.
Until neither John nor Sherlock could think of any reason for John to stay. The discussion came about one night whilst they were in bed.
John pulled Sherlock onto the floor. “I’ll try to remember how to dance properly,” he whispered, his breath warm in Sherlock’s ear.
“I think you should see this.” She pushed the door open and he followed her. Most of the tables had been removed, and most of the equipment, leaving only one table. A body was underneath. A little over five-and-a-half feet, judging by the form under the sheet. Molly walked over to it. Sherlock followed. She slowly pulled the sheet back.
Olivia complied. “Please leave. I don’t want to find the murderers. I didn’t invite you hear to investigate a murder.”
John awkwardly stepped in, his hands in his pockets. “Sorry I’m late,” he said. “I had to leave Rosie with a sitter, and Rosie cried and screamed for twenty minutes.” Sherlock’s stomach lurched. Rosie. John used to bring her around. Used to.
“There’s something I want to do,” John said, staring into Sherlock’s eyes. Determination was written all over his face.
John sat down and unwrapped his chopsticks. He broke them apart, the sound echoing through the small kitchen. Sherlock followed suit. As he ate his egg rolls, he eyed John’s potstickers. The smell coming from them nearly made his mouth water. He was feeling okay tonight. He put his hunger down to the past few days of little food.
“I don’t know either.” He wrapped a hand around his coffee and thought about everything. It was time to figure out his feelings, once and for all. It was only fair to Sherlock.
“Maybe it’s not the people,” John said with a grunt, very uninterested. He turned another page in his book.
Molly had taken her seat. There was John, standing up slowly. Gripping the pew behind him for support. He walked to the front of the room and turned around, something grasped loosely in his hand. Sherlock’s heart twisted unpleasantly at the sight of his face. It was drawn and pale, exhausted and grieving. Sherlock could see that much in the dimness. He opened his mouth to say something. His voice was quiet, guarded. “Mary is-was-” his voice broke. Sherlock put a hand on the wall to steady himself. “She was my wife. And I-I miss her.” John swallowed. “The first time I met her, I had just gotten off an incredibly long shift. It was flu season, and parents were so worried. Unnecessarily, for the most part. Very frustrating.” He tried for a weak smile. “Anyways, I walked out of my office to see her. She came over and told me that she’d be starting work here. I was a little skeptical at first, because I didn’t even know we had an opening. In my defence, I had been off for a while. Ever since-” he paused, took a breath. Ever since I died, Sherlock added silently. “Well. We started talking, and next thing I knew, I was buying her dinner.” His smile was a little stronger this time. Someone in the audience chuckled. “We just...hit it off from there, I guess. I don’t know. She made me feel alive, made me feel happy again.” Sherlock’s lips twitched. He used to be the one to make John feel like that. He was the reason John stopped feeling like that. Twice now. “I’m certain that I’ll never forget about her. I’m sorry she had to die. I’m sorry for how she died.” John grimaced. Sherlock almost doubled over, his words hurting, stinging. He was certain John was directing those words at him. He had to force the lump in his throat to go away. John, pausing, scanned the audience. Sherlock pressed back into the wall. John’s gaze settled on someone and he furrowed his brow. He looked away, but then glanced up again. “Well. She wasn’t always the best, but she was-” he stopped again, his eyes flicking back to the audience. Sherlock followed his gaze to Mycroft. Of course. John wouldn’t have expected him to be there. “She was my wife. I loved her.” John cleared his throat and took a seat, after leaving his eyes on Mycroft as he sat down. Sherlock glared at the back of Mycroft’s head.
“I didn’t want to get poisoned,” Sherlock said. The briefest of smiles crossed John’s face. Something stirred in Sherlock when he saw it.
“I used to have it when I was younger,” John said, flushing slightly. “Harry and I would look forward to it every year.”
Sherlock had to tell him. But he didn’t want to put any pressure on John. “John.” John tilted his head. “There’s something I should say. I meant to say, always, and I never have.” He paused. He needed to be careful about how he worded this. “Since it’s unlikely we’ll ever meet again,” that much was true. They definitely would not meet again, “I might as well say it now.” He wanted to tell him. John deserved to know everything. How much Sherlock loved him. How he wished things were different. How it should be them together, not him and Mary.
“Because I can’t, Sherlock. Let me make myself something with caffeine and I’ll be fine until the morning.”
Lauriston Gardens. The first case he and John had ever went on. He was certain that was what the killer was referring to. How the killer knew about his feelings for John he didn’t know, but he would find out. He would find out, and then somehow he’d stop the killer. Then he’d - he’d do something about the situation with John. Somehow.
“Yes,” Mycroft said. “Hence why we need to sit with him. Sherlock, for the next while, one of us will always be with you. To keep an eye on you.”
John followed him into the sitting room. Sherlock sat down. John sat in his chair and hung his head, pressing his hand into his eyes. Sherlock wanted to hug him. He ached to wrap John’s body in his own. Whisper that things were okay. He wasn’t sure John would like that, though, so he didn’t move. Just watched as John slowly came back to himself.
He hardened his glare, but she didn’t look away. “You know that he does.” Fury overtook him, rushing through his body, flowing through his veins and mixing with the cocaine. He stood up, gripping the back of his chair for support. “You told me, after all.”
He left the bedroom, expecting to see Sherlock sitting in his chair, or at the desk, or doing experiments in the kitchen. What he was greeted with was a silent flat and no sign of him. His coat wasn’t on the rack, nor was his scarf. Not for the first time, John began to panic. Sherlock rarely stayed out overnight without at least leaving a note, and there was no note. Whatever John said, it really must have upset him. John debated calling Mycroft, but while Mycroft could have all of the British government to swarm Sherlock, Mycroft didn’t really know Sherlock. Not enough to talk about this. So he called Greg.
“We can handle that, John. We’ve handled worse. You moving back in is hardly the biggest challenge we’ve faced.”
Sherlock thought about it for a moment. John’s gaze was firm, steady. He wanted Sherlock to come. Sherlock wasn’t certain he wanted to. It was still awkward between them, and Sherlock needed time to think things over.
“I didn’t actually die,” Sherlock pointed out, while the irrational part of his brain pointed out that John just said that he loved him.
Sherlock followed him down to Mrs. Hudson’s and knocked on the door. She opened it, beaming. “Hello, boys, how are you?”
“We’re going to keep you here to monitor you for a few hours, then you can,” the doctor said with a smile. “You have stitches in your forehead, by the way. Nasty fight you got in.”
John looked at him. “You should have told me.” He emphasized the last few words. “It hurt, Sherlock.”
“Yeah.” John rubbed his thumb across Sherlock’s knuckles. “I understand. We’ve done a lot to each other.”
Sherlock stopped playing and held the violin at his side. “It is something I wrote,” Sherlock replied. “It is called ‘Rosie’s Sonata.’ When she is old enough, I will teach her to play it.”
Sherlock didn’t say anything else as he left the room. He wasn’t sure exactly what he expected, but nobody followed him. A hollow pit formed in his stomach. Muffled voices from the other room grew fainter with every step he took. Over all the voices, he heard John making those terrible noises. He resisted the urge to cover his head and try to block out the sound, telling himself to listen.
Harry held the door for him. He took a seat at a small table near the window, settling Rosie on his lap. After they ordered, Harry just looked at him. “You never want to meet.”
John would stay for a little less than a week. Five days, to be precise. He’d arrive on the twenty-third and leave on the twenty-seventh.
He stood up, checking on Rosie, before making his way into his own bedroom. He got ready slowly, trying to prolong the time before he had to sleep.
John rubbed circles on the back of Sherlock’s hand and took a drink of his water. “You seem to be doing just fine,” John said. “You’re letting me stay with you with my daughter. In your flat.”
Sherlock swallowed, calming his heartbeat. “Can I...kiss you again?” He held his breath as he watched John. Finally, John nodded. Sherlock leaned in slowly. John’s breath was hot on his face. He kissed him, as lightly as he could.
He repeated this, over and over, until his breathing finally slowed. His eyes burned. There was no going back to sleep now, not with the threat of another nightmare.
-room, and there wasn’t much left after that. A few toys, a few books, and that was everything. Rosie was put to bed.
Sherlock crossed the room and picked up his violin. It was crucial that he played, that Lestrade left. Otherwise Sherlock might start asking him about John. And then Lestrade might start to suspect, or worse, say something indiscreet to John himself. So. Yes. Lestrade needed to leave.
Rosie nuzzled her face into Sherlock’s shoulder and squirmed. He held her just a little tighter and began pacing around the flat. He figured he was utterly useless when it came to children. He didn’t remember much of his own childhood and he didn’t have a sibling nor a younger relative to take care of. Luckily, Rosie seemed content to sit in his arms while he paced.
Sherlock didn’t know what to do. John had apologised and was clearly regretful, but that didn’t change the fact that he’d thrown Sherlock to the ground and broken his ribs. Sherlock clenched the wall, frustrated. He simply didn’t know what to do. And he absolutely hated not knowing what to do. It was one of his least favourite things, not knowing.
John cleared his throat. “Right. Um. Vows.” He adjusted his tie slightly and locked eyes with Sherlock. “Sherlock, when I met you, you immediately deduced everything about me. It was unnerving, maybe, and some people don’t like it, but I was immediately fascinated. There’s something about you, something I’ve always seen, that makes you different. In a good way. You’re the best and wisest man I have ever known, and I am honored that you picked me. You’ve been there for me in so many ways, and I’m so grateful. I vow to always be there for you, to stand by your side, and to never let you go again.” John finished his speech with a slight brush of color across his face. Sherlock was sure he looked lovesick, just staring at John like that, but he didn’t care.
He closed his eyes, willing not to let anxiety bubble up. “Nightmare,” he spat out, finally. John sat on the edge of his bed, and Sherlock swung his legs over so he was sitting next to him.
“We are on a date,” Sherlock pointed out. He gestured to the food, and the bench, and the water. “We’ve kissed, we’ve established that we’re in love. What more is there to it?”
John told him that they most definitely did. Sherlock groaned, but complied, and by the time they were back at Baker Street, Sherlock was laden down with bags. John was carrying Rosie so he couldn’t help. The handles of the bags bit into Sherlock’s fingers and wrists, and he was glad when they got home.
“Sherlock, you’ve been alone.” Lestrade grasped Sherlock’s arm and tugged upwards. He was suddenly too weary to resist. His head swam and pounded, his mind fuzzy. “Come on. I know this is hurting you, but you can’t do this to yourself.”
“This might not be an awful song after all, John,” Sherlock said quietly. John just laughed. Sherlock and John were almost chest-to-chest now. John’s hand was warm in his. His skin was warm through his shirt. Through the dance, they moved closer and closer to each other, relaxed a little more.
A noise came from upstairs, sounding suspiciously like a sob. And not like Rosie’s sobs. Sherlock climbed the stairs, pausing at the top to look into Rosie’s room. It was beautiful. He immediately planned out, then and there, that he and John would redo the bedroom at Baker Street and make it perfect for her.
He couldn’t say any of that. He opened his mouth, intending to make a joke - maybe telling John that Sherlock is actually a girl’s name - but John interrupted him.
The map he’d hung up showed all their locations. Seemingly with nothing in common, he was determined to find an underlying factor. They all must have something in common. He was puzzling it out.
Sherlock thought they were getting better, and to be honest they were. He was just weak. He pressed his hand to the bottom of the shower and glared at it. He could do this. He and John could do this.
It was a mark of how hurt Sherlock was that he didn’t protest. John had expected his anger to take over, expected Sherlock to yell at him or pretend he didn’t exist, but Sherlock did nothing. Absolutely nothing. It broke John’s heart. He sat there and waited, but Sherlock didn’t do anything besides put his head back down. John extended his hand to rub Sherlock’s back, thought better of it, and then put it on his own knee. Neither of them spoke for what felt like an eternity. The silence was stifling in the dimness, dust swirling in the streaks of sunlight coming in through between the curtains.
John’s heart was beating irrationally fast. It was just Sherlock. Just Sherlock. He wondered exactly what Sherlock would do when he saw John.
Sherlock smirked at him to let him know it was fine. “I’m just not. John, you might have noticed I don’t hold many people in high regard. Therefore, their opinions don’t matter to me. Besides, it’s nothing to be ashamed of. You said it yourself, remember? It’s fine, it’s all fine?”
“Can’t we just….meet up?” John awkwardly avoided her gaze.The waiter brought him some tea and he thanked him.
Sherlock must have fallen asleep, because he woke up to bright sunlight streaming through the window facing the street. He arched his back and stretched. It was sore from sleeping in his chair all night. His spine popped as he stood up, unfurling his arms and legs. He yawned and ran a hand through his chair. He needed to brush his teeth. Maybe Mrs. Hudson would make him some tea, or a pastry for breakfast.
She handed him a small piece of paper. His heart skipped a beat. His name was written across the front of it. He unfolded it.
Michael Boothe was an actor. He was beaten to death by six young men by the toilets at Elthorne Park. At the time, these toilets were a popular meeting place for gay men. The men most likely killed him because he was gay. He died 30 April, 1990.
“Forget it. Just forget it.” His eyes were almost pleading, but John could see the familiar stubbornness in the way he clenched his jaw.
“If you’re here to get your stuff, go ahead. Don’t let me stop you. Just please do it quickly,” Sherlock said, sounding absolutely miserable.
“Yes, Merry Christmas,” John said. Sherlock leapt off the bed. John adjusted the pillows until he was in a sitting position.
“Oh, Sherlock.” John moved Sherlock closer so that he was practically in John’s lap. “I never thought that about you. I may have been angry, I may have been cruel and mean and a hundred other words that couldn’t come close to the pain I caused you, but I never once for a second doubted that you were a good person or that…that I loved you.”
He shook his head once, quickly, and raked his hands through his hair. “I don’t expect you to understand. You couldn’t. But don’t tell me what to do when you don’t.”
“No. She can’t-she can’t know,” Sherlock said, looking around wildly. “She’ll tell Mycroft and he’ll take me away.” Mrs. Hudson sighed, but complied and took him to the A&E. The attendant on duty looked at him. Through a haze of pain, he explained what had happened, before his vision spun and blackened and he collapsed.
Sherlock clenched his fist into the sheets. “Oh,” he said again. His voice came out sounding strangled.
The man sighed and bent down to rustle through a drawer. “Sign this, please.” Sherlock took the proffered pen and paper and scribbled his name on the line. He didn’t bother to read the paper. “I’ll get your clothing.”
“I-” John opened his mouth to speak, but Sherlock wouldn’t let him. It was evident as to what John would say. I’m sorry, Sherlock, I don’t feel that way about you. Because how could he? John was perfect, John was everything, and Sherlock was nothing. Yes, he was more intelligent than most people, but beyond that? He had been informed, by many, that he didn’t even have a heart. Sherlock breathed deeply before starting to speak.
His tone set Sherlock’s teeth on edge. A chill ran up his spine. He raised an eyebrow. “The morgue. Your favourite?”
He forced himself to replay the memory, over and over. He deserved the pain, deserved it because it was his fault. John already went through enough, already went through war, the death of his best friend. Sherlock should have known better than to add to it. John’s groan echoed in his mind. He pressed his hands over his ears in an attempt to make it stop, tucking his feet up, rocking back and forth. And then stopped. Forced himself to hear it.
Lestrade exited the flat, dropping a hand on Sherlock’s shoulder as he did so. “I’m sorry,” he muttered. “It’s for your own good.” Sherlock didn’t respond to him, but did soften his glare. He understood why Lestrade did that, he really did. Sherlock wasn’t okay. He hadn’t been okay. Lestrade was just worried about him. Sherlock wished he wasn’t. It was infuriating. Involving Mycroft was annoying and completely unnecessary, but he found himself too distracted to be fully angry at Lestrade.
“Let’s get you to bed.” Lestrade wrapped an arm around Sherlock’s shoulders and helped him to stand up. He guided him to his room, laying him gently on his bed. Sherlock curled under the blankets. The hollowness had increased. Lestrade closed the door. “I’ll be outside when you wake up. Then we talk.”
John wasn’t even sure where the annoyance with Sherlock was coming from. “It’s okay, Sherlock. It was bound to happen sooner or later.”
