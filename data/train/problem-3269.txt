Still, someone was missing for him here in the bunker. Actually, two, he’d love to have Eileen joining them. It would be the perfect nuclear family of the bunker for Dean. Also, maybe he could actually adopt a dog for the bunker. It would be a good time for them to have a pet. Although, he had a strong feeling that Castiel would prefer a cat more, which would be an unfortunate case for Dean since he had an allergy towards felines.
Dean didn’t dare to look to Cas’ direction for the next few minutes, even when he felt the man next to him was shifting quietly. Until Dean felt Cas’ hot breath on his ear.
The hunter lowered his lips to Castiel's neck. When he found the vein that beat rhythmically as Cas' newly heartbeat, Dean started to suck.
“Dean, this dish needs a six-hour time to cook,” Cas showed the package of rendang seasoning, right after Dean had put the meat into the pot.
The older boy chuckled and did as he was told. When Dean reached the dining room, Bobby showed up from the stairs and fresh from the shower. “Hey, Bobby. Still grunt as ever I see.”
Dean felt as if there was a light electricity stroke his spine softly when he saw the look on Castiel’s face. He was still staring at Dean, as if he was the most precious thing in the world, and the smile on his lips was highly irresistible for the PE teacher. He felt the urge to cross over the table and
The Empty shrugged and made a face, "Don't know, don't care. Also, I'm almost on my limit now, Dean Winchester. If you don't tell me what you want here, I would really appreciate it if you just let me go back to sleep."
“What? You hungry?” the human cackled when he saw his little animal blinked slowly to the question, “Okay, I’m up. Let’s have breakfast.”
"I told Crowley about Billie rescuing me from The Empty," Jack continued when he saw Crowley waving his hand in his direction. "How Billie prepared me before she let me explode in The Empty."
Dean quickly turned to his friend and gave him a warning look, that made Balthazar quickly understand the fact that Dean hadn’t tell the kids on the backseat about Castiel. And who
“I think three or four, I forgot. The sea looked frightening for me at the time. A broad blanket of water, that half of it was mysterious and you don’t know where it would end,”
Something in Dean’s head suddenly clicked at the information, and he blurted out, “You wanna have dinner somewhere?”
Dean placed his chin on the heel of his palm, then leaned his elbow to the table. “He’s having his brother and niece over. Not sure they’ll like it if I’m bothering him.”
And that was how Cas was awaken from his own thoughts. “Yes, Dean, I’m sorry. I’m here. So, um, yeah … we could have more or less like five hours before I have to go to the airport.”
Cas knew he was defeated, he smiled sheepishly before answering, “A kid at school. Saw him playing basketball once and I thought it was admiration. He's married with two kids now, that's what his Facebook said."
The more it was mentioned, the more it felt like it was a foreshadowing, a sign that should need more attention than what the brothers were currently working on. That there was still a grand plan of something that was presently brewing as they lived their peaceful life. The reason behind the lack of saying what had happened in their lives
"Oh, shush," Abaddon joined Castiel and Dean as she sat on one of the stools, "By the way, I think Mum and Dad worked on some parts of the house. You should see the bedrooms, Cassie, I
Dean laughed at Cas’ story, “That’s amazing, Cas. Gabriel really look after you when you guys were little, yeah?”
Cas chuckled when he saw the excited look in Dean’s face. Who knew the patient who was so sceptical of his name when they first met turned out really fun to be with? And charming beyond belief.
A new chapter! Seems like my updates getting slower each chapter, yeah? Terribly sorry about that, hopefully I can work faster now it's Hellatus season! XD
Charlie was practically squealing when she heard Dean's answer. They both then quickly were deep in discussion about space sci-fi films and series that neither Castiel nor Abaddon had any experience of.
“I bet. Here it’s just like another city. So, there you go, Dean. Some seasons would be good here, some would be good there,” the dentist shrugged before drinking his beer. When he put his bottle down, he realised that the man with green eyes before him was looking at him while holding his fork. Reflexively, Castiel cocked his head and stare back. After a few seconds of staring contest, Castiel was still completely unprepared of what’s coming.
“Um,” Cas looked down to his naked feet, suddenly blushing, even though he knew that nobody will saw him, including Gabriel and Claire, “what about Saturday? We, uh, we can go shopping first and go back to your place to start cooking. And, uh … and watch that scary movie of yours.”
Cas felt his body trembled slightly when Dean wrapped his hands tenderly with his own. It took him a few seconds to turned and looked at Dean, it was almost as if in slow motion. A definite chick-flick moment. Cas was surprised to see Dean was smiling fondly at him, and his lips made a soundless 'Hey, Cas'.
“Um, yes. Bought it when I was back from England. Had it since. Sometimes it’s more practical to ride a bike than driving a car.”
Dean’s soft voice when he talked with Castiel, and the cheeky glint in his eyes after he said something bold to Castiel, and the look on his face after mentioning Balthazar’s name, and saw Castiel’s reaction. Actually, Castiel enjoyed looking at Dean’s various expressions from their brief meeting last week, and he hoped that he could see more of those today.
“Well, you know, you and Cas have been in this on and off thing for years. I mean, ever since I know you, you two have been acting like, well, like parents to me. It was like you two have so many things to sort out, but the timing and situation were never perfect. Now, things gonna be different, do you have any specific plan to do with Cas?”
Charlie chuckles, “Aw, such an honour. Okay, continue. What about the librarian? You were lucky everyone didn’t actually notice that you were gone for a long time. They were playing this horror game from Indonesia, and it’s terrifying.”
"Sam, I'm gonna save Cas, whatever it takes. He gave his life to save me, this is the least I could do to him."
After each man took a machete that would help behead vampires and a gun for support, they headed into the barn. It was eerie on the inside, empty with stacks of hay placed here and there, along with farming pieces of equipment that could hurt anyone who didn’t use it properly. It was curious why vampires, or vamp-mimes, would make a nest in this place.
Dean smiled and says thank you to the woman, who then continued her Korean drama entertainment. For few first seconds of walking down the hall, Dean wondered why did she looked like a neglected off-a-bad-relationship ex? What had he done to him, except interrupting her watching?
"I know, Cas. Same with me, if I knew you were Abaddon's brother, I'd tell you right away when we met."
The lips that were on him pulled back slowly, and he opened his eyes as he felt the complete vacantness on his face. Dean returned the smile from the young man before him, who also threw a meaningful look. He knew that look, he gave that look often to people who sat on that side of the car sometimes, but he wasn’t in the mood tonight. Somehow.
The former angel was tentative, probably he couldn't believe that he could actually have what he wanted. He could be alive and be with Dean, hold him, kiss him, and
“Nah, rabbit food is Sammy’s area,” Dean shook his head animatedly while answering that, and it made Cas laughed. It was clear on his face that he was proud of himself for making the dentist did so.
Cas knew he just shown Dean one of his best smiles after that answer. Or maybe just one of his creepy smiles.
“Hey, don’t bother. You had cooked dinner and you have beer, the least I can do, man,” answered Dean while carrying two plates to the dining table outside.
To everyone's surprise, Crowley set his attention to Dean in an intense way. "How did you know about
As Crowley started to lose himself in his thoughts, Dean decided to step away from him and walked to Rowena. He came up with a plan to help Cas from The Empty, but he wanted to make sure that what he had in mind could be aided by Crowley and Rowena.
“About the new God, yes, I think I’m ready now,” Jack nodded, “should we do it in the library or somewhere else?”
Dean heard Crowley shouted "Haggis!" and there was a blinding and heated light surrounding them. For a quick second, Dean listened to an inhuman and horrible wail from The Empty's direction. While at the same time, the whispers that they heard around them when they first arrived there place suddenly became louder. The presence of unseen entities was now even more apparent to Dean's senses.
The sergeant was called by his team, and she excused herself. He smiled as a response to her, but after she returned inside the house, the smile on his face was still visible. It was also no longer of politeness, more to an irony.
“Seriously?” Dean wiped a small of tear from the corner of his eye before continued and led Cas to stop at the balcony, far away from the other guests’ attention. He smiled when Cas crossed his arms in front of his chest and leaned on the stone railing. “Your brother is really something. Gabriel’s really different from you, yeah?”
“Thank you. I’ll see you next week,” Castiel slapped himself on the head in his mind, since he remembered that he just said that few moments ago.
"So, The Empty was a place where it was all dark and silent, but somehow this entity could notice when there was a loud noise in it?"
When the dark haired man turned around, he saw that Dean was still holding the door open with his back, and looking far to the city. The look on his face was so divine, and Castiel froze on his spot.
Apparently, Castiel wasn’t the only one who was silently busy finding ways to make his dinner companion smiled throughout the night. Because the simple question from Dean had made him smiled, even if he didn’t intend to, and he really had to give some credit to the other man.
It was eerie to watch how the black liquid flowed smoothly to make an even more solid shape of a person.
As if on cue, right after he said that, a waiter came and Dean quickly gave him a sign that he would like a table in the balcony. The young man before him nodded silently and led him upstairs.
Cas eyed widened at that statement. He didn’t expected Dean to actually do what he said before, but this was really surprising for him. Not that he didn’t believe Dean before, but this still came as a surprise for him.
But this time, with the blue-eyed man who he saw in the canteen, it was definitely different. Although it was only for a few seconds, Dean had had the
Dean had to force himself thinking of something ordinary to keep his mind off Castiel and his hand around his face and mouth. Something like Bobby teaching him how to fix his Baby, or Ellen calling him from the kitchen and told him to sweep the garden. Something trivial like that.
On the other side of the table, Castiel saw two young girls had their just-arrived lunch photos taken, before they did some selfies, and
Abaddon’s eyes widened, and she let out a bark of laughter, “You kidding? So, you just left the house?”
“Why did you want to die that much? Because I didn’t stop you every time you walked away? Were you really that unhappy when you were with us? Were you
marathon, with their adopted siblings, Charlie and Kevin, whenever they stayed over. Some other time Dean would watch late night classic films before going to bed, or Sam played his Xbox on weekends. There were also nights where the boys would spend it binged on Netflix and fall asleep with the fireplace going. And that would be one of Dean’s favourite nights.
The baritone voice sent shivers right to the back of his neck, “Yeah, nothing. I’m, uh, watching Gabriel’s tricks.”
"However," Crowley continued, "you said Billie told you that the Winchesters are destined to be doomed to the Empty. Then you and your brother - and any children you decided to spawn to - will be the only humans in The Empty."
“Everything alright with you, brother?” the tall and buffed man started, while moving his bright blue eyes to Dean.
Crowley looked at Dean as if the older Winchester had a goldfish swimming behind his eyes, just like in an old school cartoon. He then replied, "I gotta be honest with you, Dean, I don't know much about The Empty. Except all Deaths have the special privilege to get in and out of it as they please. I still have no idea how, but I'm planning to find out later,"
When he realised what his brain had created during the short time, his body froze. And also the brilliant pair of sapphire before him. They looked at Dean’s emeralds in awe, as if Dean was the whole world for Cas. Dean silently moved his fingers to the side of Castiel’s face, and when the tip of his finger touched Cas’ stubble, he quickly remember where they were.
Dean smiled when he saw his little brother took a step back from the intercom and looked upwards with hope for a few moments, just like in one of those chick flicks, then when he shifted his looking angle, there was a broad smile on his face.
“Of course I will, Dean. I know how much Cas means to you. Your stories about him were always great, I can see why you’re in love with him, and he was to you.”
The kitten opened its eyes and yawned, then he kneaded Castiel’s chest, made the human chuckled. “Well, we’re still not sure if he’s interested anyway, right, kitty? So, you’re still coming home with me. Not that you won’t if he was interested, though.”
The woman he talked to pauses the Korean drama she was watching and replied to her superior, “Yes, the road was still packed now. I’d rather wait for another half hour.”
“What?” Cas looked up and noticed he was few steps behind Dean, and quickly jog along to the other man. “Dean, why did you called me Peter Pan?”
From the corner of his eye, Cas noticed that Dean turned his attention to him for a quick second, before back to the road. “Sorry, Cas. I was really surprised, that’s all,” Dean said and took Cas’ hand in his and kissed the back of the dentist’s hand, completely oblivious of the blush that crept Cas’ cheeks, “and, uh, this probably sounded hillarious, but recently I had a dream that have a big giant black dog in it.”
“Yes, Doctor Novak?” She quickly stood up, and flashed that smile that made Castiel feels a little uneasy for some reasons, along with her unnatural thick eyebrows, that she had to retouch every
Sam turned to his mentor in witchcraft, "Probably some ingredients to create a crossing spell. Do you mind if we look into your apartment when we managed to make the spell, Rowena?"
month that they haven’t heard from their father. John Winchester just went off, God knows where, left Dean his Impala and vanished. Usually John would be back at least once a month, just to let his boys know that he’s still alive. But now it was only through text messages, and Dean decided that he shouldn’t be expecting him coming home soon.
Dammit, Cas, I’m waiting for another ten minutes. If I don’t hear anything from you, I’m coming over.
“Yes, a Mr. Winchester. His appointment will be at two,” Naomi put down her notes and gave Castiel another smile.
When he heard his name was being called, Cas lifted up his face and once again met Dean’s green eyes, that look back at him with softness and interest. “Yes, Dean?”
"It was a well-thought plan, Sam. He really impressed me," Cas smiled as his eyes moved to see Dean, who was talking with Rowena, then he had his attention on Eileen. "Hello, Eileen, it's so good to see you again."
The question that came from Charlie made Castiel smile and sighed. "Maybe if I took her seriously when she talked about finding someone to go steady, she would tell me about Dean, and I wouldn't think much about him when we met at the park."
For some reasons Castiel’s reply triggered something in him, and his voice got a bit more stern as he continued, “No, Cas, you don’t get to tell me
After Chuck was defeated, the Winchester brothers lived their lives in an ordinary way inside the Men of Letters bunker. Until something came up one day.
Okay, that probably went too far, Cas would be happy if Dean could have dinner at his place again in near time. Period.
He loved worshipping Cas' body. To run his hands and lips all across his body, to see Cas released sounds that would have him cast out from Heaven, again. All because of his doing, that brought absolute confidence in Dean that he could bring Cas to his climax.
"Jack might have a point as well, you know," Eileen continued, "this is our new life without Chuck interfering, so maybe try to keep our family complete for as long as we could?"
Dean felt his face had a certain heat risen from his neck to his forehead when he looked back to the pair of space-blue coloured orbs. Somehow Dean could feel like Cas was looking into his soul and cherished everything he saw in there, even the darker ones.
It was an answer that made both of them felt content. At least for now, everything would be well between them. They had opened up about their feelings for each other, a little bit too late, but it was worth the wait. With Sam and Eileen joining their life in the bunker, they would be a family again.
Dean copied Castiel's smile before moving forward to plant a kiss on the other man's lips. "I am. What about you, Cas? You told me that your true happiness was not in the having, it was just in the being and saying it. You also thought that what you want the most is something that you couldn't have."
Eileen then presented Dean with a plate full of sandwiches and placed it in the middle of them. "I made this for us. I reckon you would be hungry when you woke up and needed some comfort food. I can't make pies, sorry."
Dean zoomed and slide the photo, so the screen only showed Cas’ face. Even through a digital screen, he could see how strikingly beautiful Cas’ blue eyes were. He was beautiful. Dean would love to see Cas with that expression more often.
"Hey!" Dean could swear that he was that close to smacking Crowley's head, but since he was now Death, Dean knew that it wouldn't be wise not to do anything unpleasant to him. "So, how do we meet this The Empty?"
A smile appeared on Crowley's face that could pass as a fond smile when he heard the words that came out from Jack. "You seemed like a decent man for someone who had Lucifer as a father. Did these boys teach you well? Moose, Squirrel, Fea-"
The man with the mission leant forward to the table. He pulled his hand softly from Rowena and started to drum his fingers on the wooden surface before he gave a slow and staccato fashioned answer. "We kind of need a spell that can get us through to The Empty."
steakhouse, and they had the most delicious steak he ever had, but for today his mood was for cheese burger. And mashed potato. And sautéed vegetables. While Crowley was having his steak rare. The young dentist looked out the window, he turned to his friend when he heard a shutter’s sound.
"Yeah, Dean, you might want to brush your teeth first," Jack said as he got up to his feet and cleaned up the back of his pyjama pants.
"Wait," Eileen cut in, "you said that you were made Death a few days ago? We had a new God appointed not even a week ago, do you think it was Her?"
“You have a cat. Okay … um, do you mind if we just sit outside?” Dean broke the silence, and covered his mouth and nose when he let out another sneeze.
“Cas, drop it. That’s okay. I am sorry if I was too hard on you on this. It’s not your fault, I was overthinking it or was getting too excited and completely unprepared for any sudden change,” Dean explained himself to Cas in one take of breath, then after an appropriate pause he continued, “I
The ring and vibration in his pocket made Castiel jumped. Apparently, he moved too sudden that some people around him turned their heads at his direction. He fished his phone sheepishly, and checked the clock on the screen. It was almost one, so that must be Naomi called him.
He placed back the plastic spoon that he had been using to savour his lunch into the bowl before him, then he gave the white porcelain a small turn, until he could see the odd painting of red rooster with black mane of tail, and green grass on its side. He then wondered who had the idea to make a drawing of a particular poultry by the weed at an eating dish.
“So, what is this event about?” Charlie asked, probably she had gave up on the discussion of such serious topic on a Saturday night, “You guys promised to tell me on our way.”
Rowena then poured a glass of whiskey and opened a bottle of orange juice (that Demon No 186 magically brought as she requested) for Jack. The young boy didn't look too impressed at the bright coloured bottle, but one motherly look from Rowena had him accepted it with a smile. Soon, the three of them were engaged in a light talk about how Rowena and the Winchesters used to have a complicated relationship, along with Crowley.
Cas huffed and sat on his sofa, then he heard the familiar sound of Dean’s Baby, the loud roaring engine, “I thought something happened.”
It was like experiencing a flashback, seeing Crowley back in the bunker with all of his regalias that the Winchester had familiar with.
“Okay, okay,” the PE teacher rub the back of his head, while looking for questions that could give him an advantage for his dentist visit later.
“Oh, okay. Thank you, Meg, you can call him in now,” with that, his nurse went to get the patient. And Castiel went to place the kitten inside his private toilet. He made a second turn to throw a ball of paper for it to play.
“Probably. Not remember,” they walked down the stairs that lead to the entrance way, where Dean parked his Baby on the side of the road. “So, how’s everything with Cassie after the cancelled dinner?”
Although, speaking of tables, most of them seemed occupied tonight, even it was still a little past eleven.
Dean was still in awe of Castiel’s muscle movements behind his forest green t-shirt when the dentist took off his jacket, he didn’t realised that Castiel had called his name several times.
Dean paused from taking out the crackers and dips from the shopping bags, “Because I didn’t catch a cold?”
Dean rolled his eyes, but took out the plates from the cabinet anyway. He gave one to Sam, who had sat on one of the chairs on the small dining table in the kitchen.
This time it was Castiel’s turn to burst with laughter, “That was awful, even only from listening to it. However, I could share your sympathy on that, sister mine. One of
It was about his third week living with his big brother, Gabriel, in their hometown, Illinois, when he got an offer to work with his former housemate, Crowley, all the way in Vancouver, and he would need a place to stay if he took the offer. Gabriel told Castiel that their oldest brother, Lucifer, owned an apartment in that city, said that it was a payment from his client, whose case he won few years ago.
“It was better than I expected, Dean,” Cas answered before taking a sip of his wine, then he continued, “you can see that Sam enjoyed it too, he almost demolished the whole bowl.”
“Yeah, man,” Dean leant backon his chair, “I never been going anywhere from this continent. I bet Scotland wasn’t the only country this Novak boy been to.”
Especially, when you had arrived in the waiting room, and your stomach suddenly acting up and starts poking from the inside. Dean walked up to the secretary’s desk and found her brushing her hair while watching Korean drama.
He could feel himself releasing a long sigh, when Cas understood him and moved closer to him, practically leaning on Dean’s side as the bigger man placed an arm on the sofa behind Cas’ head.
Dean could feel himself on fire. It had been a long time since he was this forward with a person who attracted his attention, and it was a woman. He had never done this talk-first-sex-later with a man; it was usually a series of one night stands. But with Castiel, Dean felt like he wanted to know more about the man before going any further.
After some discussions about risks and profit, Ellen let Dean shadowed her at work for three months just so he could learn what to do as an owner of a dining place and how to manage it. Turned out, Dean enjoyed it very much, so he and his adoptive parents started to make a plan on business owning and managing.
There were exhausting days where Dean and John would headbutt about his decision, after a while Bobby and Ellen would join in and give their thoughts on the issue to John, given they also raise Dean as their own (even though Bobby and Ellen weren't married, and merely neighbours at the time). Of course, this only made John even more upset.
But with Castiel … well, Balthazar cornered him during lunch time and started spilling him few basic information about the dentist, without asking Dean if he would like to know or not. Dean was quite sure, had he not stopped the excited blonde, he would’ve known Castiel’s favourite sex position by now.
He almost slide close the door, when he saw a slight movement behind the t-shirt pile. Hoping that it was what they were looking for, Dean lifted up the clothing and there he was. A small yellow kitten was curled peacefully and asleep.
When Dean returned to his desk, the school hour was finished and there were students pacing up and down the halls, meeting their friends for some after school plans or about to go home. He started packing his bag, getting ready to leave, then the message he was waiting for arrived.
"That makes sense," Crowley nodded, "in short, Billie took a peek on her own fate, and decided to create some fun by appointing me as the new Death? Huh, can't say I'm complaining about that. The work has been good so far."
. At least he would get a full 40-minutes of privacy while both of them are arguing about the impossible plot of the medical soap opera.
There was an awkward pause in the air, while both men exchanged look. It was like both men knew that they had revealed more than what they should. That they had noticed each other’s presence in that unexpected place, and they probably should stay quiet. For a little bit longer.
Neither Dean nor Sam took what happened before their eyes as something usual. They both had questions in their minds, but none of them started to throw one.
Is this allowed? Castiel knew that he had sent (probably not-so) subtle messages to Dean today, but a part of him just couldn’t help it. He wanted Dean to know that he’s interested in him, yet another part wanted to get to know Dean more before they’re going anywhere. Yeah, maybe he should take it slow with this one. Enjoying each moment, if there ever be moments. Castiel took his glasses off and pocketed it.
Dean got up to put the beddings on the chair that was on the centre of a demon sigil, before he joined them, "Oh, yeah, they're really nice, thank you. How long have you guys been here?"
someone so much should be,” Castiel pouted to the ceilings. “Ironic, isn’t it? To know that he was named after The Fallen Angel-turned-Devil, yet he was the one who is most religious among us. And Raphaelle ... can't she just be happily ever after with Dad's publishing business? Since none of his
for them, then,” Cas took two more cups and put them inside the cart. “Right, next, the crackers. Come on!”
"Huh. Whoever that was, it was either they made the right decision, or a drunk decision," Dean replied. "Okay, so do you think you know a way to go to The Empty and back? I remember Billie did it freely."
Castiel walked to the kitchen with a protesting kitten on his heel, voicing his hunger all the way to the fridge. Even when the human was preparing the food, he could feel tiny claws were climbing up to his thigh, and jumped to the floor as he put the bowl down on the floor next to the kitchen island. Misha wolfed down his food, while Cas watched from the stool and poking the feline with his toe every now and then. It was futile, the kitten was too hungry to respond his human.
Castiel reached down and started to stroke his cock. He imagined if it was Dean who was pounding him. He wouldn’t have it this way; he would want to face Dean. Castiel would want to see the look on Dean’s face as they do it, to hear the sounds he would make, to touch his face. How Dean would manhandle Castiel down as he fucks him harder. Castiel imagined Dean marked his neck and chest while he fucked him. Then Dean would pull out right before he came, and stripped the condom off before giving his penis several strokes while he aimed Castiel’s chest and mouth, and-
“No, no, Dean, that’s okay. I, uh, it was a surprise indeed. But a nice one,” and there it went again, the unintentional smile. Cas should have his facial muscle checked one of these days.
Then there was that look of fondness again on Castiel’s face, the one that Dean would love to see every morning when he wakes up.
He pushed his glasses to the bridge of his nose and pressed the button on his earphone to skip the song played, when he felt a sharp pain on his foot. He hissed and jerked his foot, only to find a woman standing comfortably on it. Castiel shot a dark look to her, but it was pointless since she was busy with her phone and had earphones in her ears as well. After several seconds, he decided to shake it off.
Dean tapped and played with his glass for a few moments before finally talking, "Cas, I think I owe you an explanation."
Jo never complained about Dean’s protectiveness, and Sam used to say that Jo had a crush on Dean. Which was ridiculous for Dean. It would be like
With that answer, Jack smiled widely, and it practically melted Dean’s heart. It turned out he really care that much for this kid, even though he said that Jack wasn’t family before. He really needed to manipulate himself to avoid hurting so much when they lost Jack due to Billie’s plan.
“Exactly! Beautiful cat, though. Orange with bright green eyes. Rowena can be quite possessive over Lucifer. Last time Lucifer brought a female client home for a hearing preparation, she kept hissing on her. I think the only woman she could bear to see with Lucifer was Claire.”
"So, yeah. I'm sorry if this mission is a bit selfish on my side, guys. I want to rescue Cas so I can tell him that it wasn't one-sided."
Dean dropped to his knees and placed his arms and head down on the chair before he started to break down, and sobbing. Just like a few nights ago after Cas was taken.
Just like most of the other days when he went for a run, Castiel took Misha as well. The miniature panther seemed to enjoy going for a walk with his husky big brother and his human. It might have something to do with the story of how Misha came to Castiel's path at this very park.
He then walked back to his car and drove it smoothly into her usual spot inside, next to a motorbike that seemed like it belongs in the World War II era. Dean killed the engine as soon as his Baby parked, and closed the garage before getting the shopping bags next to his seat, then entering the house.
Then again, she might track his phone and try to find a place close to where he was now. Maybe. Not that it never happened before with her.
The blue-eyed man did actually come to the canteen at four in the afternoon, and Dean couldn’t believe his luck, or
The brunette's smile got wider when she heard Dean's words, "Well, knowing you died by the Hellhound after I did was good enough for me, Dean. Maybe I should trust you guys more, now I understand why Crowley and my Queen here are very fond of you both. Thank you, boys."
Sam chuckled as he approached Jack, “So, does this mean you’re the new-I mean, what do we call you?”
“Yeah, she’s, um, seventeen. Both Gabriel and I were the closest babysitters she ever had since she was little. Even with me in the UK, we’re still keeping in touch.”
Teaching high school kids was less complicated than he thought. Once the students knew that their teacher won’t mess around, or trying to look tough and strict, they will look at them as a friend. Insert a good communication skill, and respect will be earned.
"I honestly thought Charles was a charming, squirrelly man, who was just so awkward," Rowena received another slice of pizza from Dean. "I guess that was because he was weak. Do you think their role was actually reversed? Amara was The Light, and Charles was The Darkness?"
?” she practically jumped from her seat and bowed several times. “What honour do I have to be in Your presence, My Lady?”
The human chuckled as he gave a peck to the kitten’s head before checking his phone. And he quickly jolted back up to sit.
“Sure will, Dean,” Sam grinned and played again with his phone. The rest of the drive was spent in quiet, safe for Dean who was humming softly to his favourite songs.
He paced to his room to get his bag from the side of the bed and his car keys from the nightstand. Dean walked to the garage and meets the large black Impala that he inherited from his father, not that the old man had died, he was only never around, besides an occasional phone call every few weeks.
“Yeah,” replied Dean with his mouth full, “made an appointment for tomorrow. There’s a dental practice near school, I’m gonna go there. It supports the health cover I’m in, so … why not?”
“Uh, yeah, Jack saved me from The Empty,” came the gravelly voice that Dean missed so much, “I, uh, I’m outside. Could you get me in?”
Which reminded him, that it had been a while since he and Sammy visited Bobby and Ellen. How were they doing? Dean missed Ellen’s pecan pie, and cooking barbecue with Bobby, while arguing over football or basketball, or simply over how to grill the meat. Maybe he and Sam should pay them a visit, sometimes this weekend. Yes, he would ask Sam about that.
"No, not at all, come on," Dean got up and waited for Cas to follow him. "I've got extra pillows, so you can leave that here," Dean smiled when he saw Cas sat up on the bed while still holding the pillow in his arm.
, it was even evident in your voice. It was different than when you tell your stories of working on cases.”
A pair of striking blue eyes that had a glint of a smile on them, the perfectly shaped straight nose and a pair of full lips that made a smile. A smirk.
His mouth kept on talking about lifting up the weird air that was currently surrounding him and his brother, ("So, quit being a friggin' Eeyore, and let's get into this!"), but his gestures, once again, betrayed what he was talking about. That
Considered of its location in the room, having sex on this bed would be one fantastic experience, which was quite a shame since Castiel could hardly remember
Cas knew that he could never forget the look on Dean’s face that night, after he shot his incoherent response. The expression of utter
?" Dean turned sharply to Crowley, who then raised both of his hands in surrender after expressing his agreement to what The Empty said before.
"Boys, I think it's time for you both to call it a day. Samuel, I saw you sleeping, and Dean, you haven't moved from that page since an hour ago."
Cas had to look up to talk with the giant Winchester, “No, Sam. We were, uh,” he turned side eyed to Dean, who was smiling meaningfully to him, “talking. Where’s Charlie and Baz?”
It was like all of his body heat just rose up to his face when he heard his brother’s question. “Well, we, uh-”
Claire reached for the bread before she answered her father, “It was a place where you would feel like being catapulted to the past, the time where people have mullets and wear neon-coloured clothing. A bar called Blue Remington.”
Rowena went silent at the idea, that sounded so alien to her, but then she responded. "Okay, have you boys got any ideas where to start?"
He tried to track back on how the wonderful day could give him a one-eighty and landed him in this situation, where he was uncomfortably standing with so many people and could hardly move. Castiel leaned his head on the glass, then he smiled when he remembered that today will be the day to meet Dean Winchester again.
Once again Dean laughed at Castiel's antic, "News flash, buddy, you will need to breathe now. I think we need to give you a quick 101 on how to be human, yeah?"
The British man sat on the chair before Castiel, and from the air he brought along, the taller dentist could base his knowledge from experience living with him, that his friend was not in the brightest mood.
Gabriel looked at Sam from his head to feet, as if he just realised the size of Sam’s physique. “You’re right, Samsquatch. What if we just leave them here, and let them find their own cab to go home?”
“What? What?” the man sitting next to Cas sat up, and actually spilled his beer. Dean looked to Cas, and even Sam and Charlie paused the film to turned their attention to their guest. “Cas, what is it?”
It was when Cas finished with his clothing and turned his sleepy face to Dean that woke him from the silence. As he walked to the chair to put his towel there, Dean asked, “So, which side you want?”
He saw the entity, the man who was once all-powerful of many universes, was powerless and on his fours on the ground. Dean couldn't help to think that it was the perfect punishment for Chuck, to have him crawled pathetically while calling out to the three of them, for mercy. As Dean drove away from the lake, that was practically in the middle of nowhere.
The fuck-and-tell moment between Castiel and Charlie. Also a revelation from Charlie that Castiel might not realise yet.
Mick started by kissing the lower part of Castiel’s stomach, and then he went to the hip bones, intentionally avoiding Castiel’s crotch. He ran his teeth softly on one of Castiel’s hip bones and made a soft bite on the skin, earning a moan that sent a tingling sensation to his spine. He repeated the gesture to the other hip bone, while his hand was grabbing Castiel’s cock and started pumping slowly. Mick maintained eye contact with Castiel’s blue orbs that had eclipsed with the blown pupils. After several strokes that made Castiel’s breaths come in short pants, Mick continued his teasing by running the tip of his tongue on the head of Castiel’s cock. This time the sound that came to his ear was a louder moan that made his dick hardened.
"Shut up, Winchester," Dean muttered to himself when he realised that his brain worked so much more than he had intended. He reached the radio and turned it on, only to have Taylor Swift's
This time, Cas turned to lay on his side, facing Dean with a smile, "Honestly, Dean, it's been a while since I started to wonder if I should live as one. Since I'm no longer fit for Heaven and I don't want to live there anymore. I was thinking of asking you and Sam if I could live in the bunker with you guys. Well, you know, before The Empty happened."
“Toilet?” Dean started to wonder if the lady behind the desk understood English, or perhaps she was a Caucasian-looking Korean who couldn’t speak English. That would be a problem, and not in a racist way.
Dean didn't wait long after releasing Cas from the pyjama pants and had Cas' full length inside his mouth. He bobbed his head several times before he pulled his mouth off Cas' shaft, and made sure that the former angel would hear the wet popping sound he made.
Cas’ words seemed to return into Dean’s mind and made him chuckled in between his sobs. How did that awkward angel manage to string the words that he delivered to Dean before his death, probably will always be a mystery for Dean. But it was clear for him that Cas said it straight from his heart. From his love that was being kept for who knows how long. Out of fear that Dean would reject him, that Dean was the one that he knew he couldn’t have.
Dean narrowed his eyes at the explanation, while having his brain rolled back his memory archive. “No, I don’t think I’m like that, Balz. Believe me.”
“Okay, I’m sorry, that was my fault,” Abaddon nodded solemnly to her big brother, and flipped the menu. “Well, continue, please.”
Then the light crimson shade showed again on Castiel’s cheek, baiting another fond smile on Dean’s lips. “This is delicious, Dean. You want to give it a try?”
"Fuck you. I'm going to sleep," Cas laid down and set his back to Gabriel. Apparently forgotten that Dean was supposed to call him.
got bored and started to nag Charlie to retreat to their room. The geeky girl then rose from her seat and told Dean that they should continue their discussion in the morning. Then Abaddon dragged her to their room.
After he was sure that his pasta was ready, Castiel placed it on the big bowl and brought it over to the balcony, where Dean had sit and (again) admiring the view.
"Yeah, I really do hope so," Cas looked to the rear view mirror, and chuckled when he saw Claire stuck out her tongue to him. "Look, Claire, I'm sorry I abandoned you earlier. I know I promised you that I'll give you a company."
How could he come up with a life story that would match Cas’? He was a nobody, just a regular joe who worked for survival of himself and his little brother.
to me when Mom died, Sammy, I said to him that everything that went wrong in everything we did was because of
“Yes, Claire?” the father turned his head to the daughter, without bothered to get up from the comfort of the couch. As he expected, the son quickly followed behind, and both of them proceeded their bickering. What both children didn’t know was that their father had a pair of earpods inside his ear, so their fight was more like muffled noises to him at the moment.
A loud ring was heard from the loudspeaker near the ceiling, a reminder that his hour with this class was up, then he would have a free period for forty minutes, before starting the next class. That should be his last period for the day, then he could go home, have dinner, and probably watch some television.
That was the moment where Dean finally broke down. He can’t hold his tears anymore. Guilt and fear had wrapped him tightly that he almost couldn't breathe, and couldn't think clearly on the next step to rescue Cas. Dean felt helpless now he didn’t have the angel by his side anymore.
scholars in the subject had landed him many offers in translating tablets and documents from museums and other cultural foundations.
The light answer made Dean groaned silently and bent down to press his head on the desk. It wasn’t a video-call, but Dean would bet his paperworks, that across the line Cas’ frowny face just beamed bright when he said that. It didn’t exactly heard in his voice, but Dean was sure that the smile was wide.
Inside, he took off his jeans, and changed to a worn out Metallica t-shirt before turning off the lights and wished that Friday would come sooner.
The older man smiled at the sight next to him and mentally continued with the list he got from Balthazar about his new dentist.
The two men were talking about possible salad recipes that they can make for dinner through the elevator ride and the walk to Dean’s car.
that his children needed parents - or parent - to raise them. Not only as fund support, and let the elder child took care of the younger one as the father went to work from dawn until dark. There were so many things in life that Dean would love to have his father explained them to him, or experience them with him.
"Glad you like it, Dean. I picked it especially for you, I heard you had a thing for someone's brunette and wearing a trench coat. Unfortunately, I don't have blue eyes," Bela walked closer to Dean in a flirtatious way.
“Well, there was not much about him, Dean. He was a boy who was very well looked after by his big brother, until the day where he received a full dentistry scholarship in Glasgow. And off he went,” the man with the story had his eyes glinted at Dean.
Being the youngest ones in the Shurley family, Castiel and Abaddon had brought cheekiness to the family since they were little. There was quite a gap between their age and their older siblings. The elder twins, Lucifer and Michael, were twelve years older than them. Then the “middle child”, Gabriel, probably was the only one who was close to them, since he was only four years older than the younger twins.
seductive at the same time. His face has freckles all over, and his hair was this floppy haircut that was like it was from the ’90s. It was mad!” Castiel chuckled as he saw the smile on Charlie’s face grow wider. “What? What is that smile?”
Dean smiled at the question; he realised that The Empty was probably not something that everyone familiar with, as many of them probably didn’t know that angels existed.
Dean nodded towards the other group as a sign that they'd be alright searching on the books, and that they can go to do the extraction process with Jack.
He sat in the library, on one of the tables, and opened his laptop, with his faithful pup stationed next to him. The laptop was showing several tabs from the news portal all around the country, and some tabs were recreational. At the moment, he was also reading folklores from other countries and cultures (he just learnt that there was a belief in Indonesia, that when someone died, their spirit would still be around with their family for the next
When the men had taken out everything they need, Dean locked the car and lead Cas to the stairs. That lead to the main room.
“Both would be fine, Dean. I will be sleeping on the sofa bed in front of the telly with Gabriel. Claire will have my bed.”
“So, do you have to return to Heaven after this?” Dean asked as he reached forward to play with Cas’ trench coat belt. “Can you stay here with us? With me?”
“Oh, that!” Dean couldn’t help but roll his eyes at that, “Yeah, Gigantor left his keys at his girlfriend’s house, and he totally forgotten of doing that.”
His baby brother responded with a laugh as he walked closer to Dean, and placed his giant hands on Dean’s shoulders, “Dean,” he started, “you look good. I’m serious. Come on, you told Cas you’d pick him up at three-thirty, right? You have to leave now, or you’ll be late, and that will give an unpleasant impression to him. More than what you are wearing now.”
Right at the second Dean finished reading, the grace was sucked back into Cas' throat and brought a bright purplish light that came out from Cas' neck and chest. The angel let out a piercing scream before he finally fell to the floor, clutching his chest.
Dean knew that he gained even more respect towards Eileen for enjoying the fact that another woman was teasing her boyfriend. She wasn't even sarcastic at all.
Castiel called out the younger Winchester’s name as he jumped back from Dean, and Dean dropped his arms from Cas’ shoulders. “HELLO! I’M HERE!”
The angel probably knew what Dean wanted to tell, and he might or might not be ready to face his consequences. “You don’t have to say anything, Dean.”
“Yeah, yeah, I had checked myself in the mirror. There were no signs of violence whatsoever. I think this man was just post-one night stand
"No way!" Charlie's face beamed, then she bounced to the other side of the kitchen island and tapped Abaddon's arm repeatedly. "Move, woman, I have found my kin. Okay, Dean, which trilogy of
After the two brothers left the room, the other three people shrugged and gossiped about them, especially since Jack asked Rowena how Sam became her unofficial apprentice. Eileen, of course, was ready to listen to the tale.
"Her?" completely missed the vital point of the question, Crowley then turned to the brothers in turn, "what happened to Chuck?"
Eileen’s words brought warmth to Dean; even the rush and chaos inside his mind started to calm after she said that. Not only because of the sweetness of what Eileen told him, but also how her words reminded Dean of what Cas told him the very first time they met.
A suspicious van pulled over in front of a house, just as the two brothers suspected. Then from inside the truck, two people wearing mime masks stepped out and looked menacingly into the house. Or
It was one of the sounds that Dean really longed for, mostly after Castiel fell down to Earth and practically had his wings all broken. He felt hopeful at the sound that just came into the bunker. On the other hand, he couldn’t help but twitch in a slight trauma. It was still evident in his mind how he was entirely deceived by Lucifer, who ruthlessly used Dean’s affection for Cas. He had his hand balled into a fist as he looked up to the sound of footsteps that came closer to his room, followed by a familiar face.
Abaddon chuckled at Castiel’s note, “You’re right. Oh God, I’m sorry, but if you’re not ready to have
“What are you boys yapping about?” Bobby stepped into the living room and found his boys sat side by side on the couch and slightly pushing each other with each argument coming, just like when they were kids. “Okay, break it off.”
The memory of how hard and smoothly Balthazar was trying to take him out for a date back then drove Castiel to a laugh. Indeed that was true, Balthazar used to complain that Castiel was like a puzzle that he had to crack in the most difficult way, but once he got to make Castiel comfortable enough to speak, it was as if he couldn’t stop talking. That was one of Castiel’s fondest memory from his relationship with Balthazar.
"I'm sorry I made you feel like you can't have what you want. But the fact is, you can always have me. I'm always
“You can use my stuffs,” Dean returned Cas’ smile, which the dentist was sure, unlike him, that one was surely one of Dean’s best. “Well, I have fresh boxers, mind you.”
As for the second vamp-mime, his little brother aimed the gun for the leg and forehead. Critical, but not deadly yet for vampires.
" there was a definite tone of surprise at Pamela's voice, a good kind of surprised. "You mean you're
Dean wrapped his arms around Cas’ waist lazily, as the angel was now standing between his legs. “That can be arranged, angel,” he replied as he brought Cas’ face closer for another kiss.
“Dean Winchester. Seriously, Cas. That awesome room of yours can be turned to bedroom? Why are you working out of your house, again? Next time we’re having dinner at your place, I want to watch a horror movie on your sofa,” another chime came. “Dean Winchester. By the way, I just remembered, if you bring Crowley’s puppy over on Saturday, I can make Sammy babysit her for you. He loves dogs.”
“No, the trailer had scared me and I think that should be enough,” Cas folded his knees tighter to his chest. The air was cooler that he thought, even when it’s almost summer. He decided to call Dean from his balcony while Gabriel and Claire was watching a rerun of
“Okay, so this is the teacher’s room, Cas. Most of the habitants are teaching now, I was the only one free for now,” Dean started to explain, “it got its perk, I’ve got this whole room for myself, including the telly. I could watch anything, even if it’s not educational at all. And this is my desk.”
“Awww, that’s a sweet story, Sammy,” Dean cooed, earning a push on the arm from his little brother. “What? I’m serious, you were quite bummed after the grand break-up with Jess, and let’s be honest you weren’t that much in luck with girls after. But, now, you found Eileen, and you guys are cute.”
“It’s weekend, Cas. You don’t have to work on weekend, right?” Dean shrugged carelessly and finished his wine.
Dean’s heart made that speeding beat again. He was holding Cas’ hand. He walked with Cas, holding hand. They walked to Cas’ bedroom. He’s in Cas’ bedroom now. Cas’ bed was so nice. Dean got his breath hitched when he saw the closet. It filled half of one of the walls, and it has large mirror that showed the bed, and
“I’m sorry, I guess I was nervous,” Cas took a sip of his wine, before continued, “So, this is your Saturday night thingy, Dean?” Cas finally looked up to Dean and smiled. “What are the odds?”
Castiel laughed at the question, “Actually, no. I might have to refer him to another dentist if anything further happened.”
The line was cut, just as Dean said. Castiel smiled to the phone in his hand and headed inside, where Gabriel and Claire had now arguing over another rerun of soap opera.
"Oh right, you were here when I was going back home to Alaska," Pamela chuckled before she slithered her toned arm around Gabriel's waist. "Well, this time we're here together. So, who's blue eyes here?"
After he told Dean the name of the building he currently lives in, Castiel almost laughed at the comical way Dean’s jaw fell at his answer.
“Yeah. Claire loves cats, just like Lucifer. They both owned this huge orange tabby named Rowena. And she loves to sit on Lucifer’s shoulder.”
The talk with Balthazar swept into his mind again. If he had to be honest, there weren’t many people that he bothered to know further before he decided to have sex with them. Dean had always thought that he wasn’t the kind that would succumb to a long-term relationship, so he never actually bothers to find out more on his significant other’s story.
The shot made Castiel’s face heated, “Well, yeah, I had told you that my parents named their children with angel names. And they named their first born Lucifer. And this is his apartment.”
Cas almost frowned at the loss of Dean's hand when Sam called him, then he remembered where they were, and what was the occasion. He told himself that from the way he acted tonight when his brother is around, there was a huge possibility that Sam didn't know that much about this part of Dean. Although, looking from Sam's behaviour tonight, he doesn't mind about it.
Dean cocked his head in Crowley's direction, "Don't feel so alienated, you've got loads of friends in that area if you want to gossip about Cas and me."
“You would be too if you get to my age and find that there’s a rodent in the house,” Bobby rolled his eyes before stepped forward to give Dean a hug. “How are you, boy? The bar’s good?”
The offer caught Castiel by surprise, and he quickly stood up to unlock the glass door to the balcony. “Oh, yeah, sure.”
it was that Christmas when Castiel went home to spend it with his family, and it was then when Crowley called him to let him know that Balthazar was in a pub with a freshman and they were getting too cosy with each other. It took Castiel two months until he finally confronted Balthazar, and they had the major talk about their relationship, and decided to end it.
After waiting for the food in his mouth went through his throat, Castiel replied, “He’ll be over later, I made him an appointment to fix his teeth. Why are we talking about my social life, Crowley?”
Eileen's face looked brighter now she could understand where Dean would go with the idea. "Jack, you said Billie could go to The Empty as she liked. What if the new Death can do that as well? And maybe they can help us with rescuing Castiel."
After lined off the phone, he turned his head, and looking for the beautiful man from few days ago in this very place. It was a surprise for Castiel to see him again in this place. But he had gone, and so did Castiel’s second chance to start a conversation with him.
did that happen?” Abaddon finally reacted, her face went from shocked to concern in the counts of milliseconds, “No, seriously, Cassie, was it safe? I mean you were blacked out and all, he could do anything to you!”
Dean saw the dentist had walked back to his chair, then he got up and followed the man to sit across him. More notes on his file, and Dean felt something odd on his teeth. Tasted a little bit like cloves.
“Jesus, Cas,” Dean let out a low growl in between their kisses. Few moments after that, they stopped for the much needed oxygen, while having their foreheads on each other. “Cas …”
“Oh, good, you’re here, Bobby,” Ellen came carrying a bowl of mashed potatoes to the table. “Okay, I know I said breakfast before, but what the hell. Let’s make this brunch all the way, yeah?” she continued as Sammy walked in, carrying a pan with two roast chickens in it.
One of the students, Jack Klein, turned his attention from what he was watching to Castiel, “I thought the tablets were with you? The photos?”
, and the older sister as Raphael (or was it Raphaella? Raphaelle?). He was closest with the big brother just before him, Gabriel, and the baby brother, Samandriel, whom he called …
Even though Cas had seen several versions of Dean from their previous encounters, he really looked forward to learn how Dean would be when he was surrounded by people he loved the most, which is his family, at the place where he felt comfortable the most, his home.
“Yeah,” Cas looked around, probably looked for his big brother, but when he couldn’t find him, Cas returned to Dean. “What about you?”
After reading the message, and gave up wondering how Charlie could type that much in such a short time, Castiel turned to Charlie and quietly gave her a thumb up as a reply. When he turned his head to his laptop again to check on the uploading files, he smiled as he saw that they had all moved to his cloud storage. “Guys, I’ve finished uploading the files, and now I’m sending the link to you, so we can start working.”
Sam replied by tapping the roof of Baby twice, “Thanks, man.” He then walked with his girlfriend to the smaller car in front of the Impala.
“Are you nervous, Dean?” a wicked smile was shown on Balthazar’s face as he lean his body on the desk. “Oh, this is fun!”
Children adored Gabriel and his magic skills that he shown at Sweet Tricks, and the ladies admired Gabriel’s smooth talks when he was at Blue Remington. Dean, on the other hand, found enjoyment in seeing Gabriel walk up the karaoke stage. He would pick up a bass guitar, then started leading the crowd with some classic rock - from Bob Seger to STYX - on karaoke nights.
, instead her becoming my sister,” Dean response made Cas surprised for a second, before he chuckled.
“I’m sorry. I don’t know why my nose suddenly got so itchy,” Dean took another leaf of tissue from the desk. “Yes, you were saying?”
The teenager ran inside with a chuckle, and Cas knew she would definitely tell Gabriel about this, and he won’t have a peaceful sleep later.
"This Death Summoner page was taken from Book of the Damned. How did you boys get this?" Rowena asked with curiosity in her face, that was also combined with excitement. "I noticed a page missing in the book, I tried to look for it, but it was futile. Turned out you boys had it all this time."
The shorter man let out a chuckle at the statement, “Yeah, honestly I don’t think I would ever come to this kind of exhibition if it wasn’t Gabriel’s.”
Why did he suddenly felt like this? They only had dinner together once, and already he wanted to be all possessive towards the dentist?
“It’s not school day, Uncle Cassie,” her answer made Cas chuckled, then she took a chance to shot a respond to Gabriel before turning to the man on her right side again. “What happened to your phonecall, Uncle Cassie?”
Dean left his brother, who was still finishing the rest of the fried chicken, and headed to the bathroom. He took a quick shower, then entered his bedroom to get ready for sleep. As he laid down on his back, staring at the ceiling, Dean could imagine how his cooking dinner date would be tomorrow, hopefully it would be even more amazing than the one they had at Cas’ apartment. Not that it was ugly that time, but if tomorrow’s better than they both must be in the right track.
The blue-eyed man could feel his cheeks started to sore from all the smile he did since he picked up the phone to call Dean. And now he had to bit his lower lip to prevent himself from squealing from Dean’s reply. “Same here, Dean.”
The sharp and lewd groan that Cas released when Dean's hand touched his dick was utterly sinful, it almost made Dean believed that he could come just from that sound. He kissed Cas' chest and nibble on his nipple softly as he moved his hip faster into Cas, and had his thumb rubbing the head of Cas' penis.
Why did the word sounded so alien to Cas? Dean and he hadn’t had the talk about their relationship until today. Yes, they still message each other daily, sometimes call or video call, but that’s it. They hadn’t talk about their relationship since they kissed that night. The most discussion they had was Dean doesn’t have to change dentist, as long as they didn’t flaunt what they have at Cas’ practice.
Dean positioned Cas' legs on Baby's back and front seats so he could position himself between Cas' legs. He ripped the condom pack open and put it on on him. He moved forward to kissed Cas' lips for a few moments before whispering softly to the angel, "Cas, I need you to relax, okay? And tell me if it hurts."
Dean held his smile for Cas after asking the question, but inside he had a major urge to slam his head to the table and hoped he passed out until next week.
Jack put up his puppy face to Dean, the one that he knew would always get a pass from Dean, in any non-life or death situation, no matter how upset the older man is, “I don't like the feel of the hole on my lips.”
Probably it was fate that made the little kitten mewed precisely at the time Castiel ran past him, even with Romeo on his feet. The gentle husky sniffed on the baby kitten and quickly laid down next to him as if protecting the poor creature. That was the time Castiel
“Jesus, you guys gonna wait for it to finish? I won’t,” Sam threw the dirty kitchen paper to the rubbish bin and washed his hands before walking out.
"Still, there was a good feeling to be in a library filled with books that showed how people will snuff it. There's your book and Moose's as well, you know."
"Samuel," as if on cue, all three - Dean, Eileen, and Jack - imitated Rowena's Scottish accent, then they shared a laugh.
“Oh, okay,” the blonde girl called and then turned to Benny, “Thanks for your help, Benny, Dean. So, uh, I leave my car keys to you guys?”
“Claire, this is Dean, and that’s his brother, Sam,” Cas pointed to Sam, who smiled widely at the girl, “and this is Balthazar, and Charlie. Dean’s friend.”
He had took care of Sammy since they were little – since the fire that costed them their house and the boys’ mother – and Sammy had always looked up at Dean as his parent, brother, guardian, protector, et cetera. Showing one’s flaw was never in the plan. It’s enough that Sammy knew one adult in his life who had issues, drowning himself in alcohol and hours of work that he hardly spend time with his sons and sometimes forgot their birthdays. Sammy obviously didn’t need
The cheerful voice next to his ear startled his train of thought and memory. Dean turned his face to meet Sam’s.
"Cas, I need you to let me know if I did something that you don't like, okay? I don't wanna hurt you, angel."
“Hey, Castiel, your phone went off inside. Do you want to get it?” Dean walked out with a handful of paper towel and a slightly red nose, thanks to Misha.
"I don't even know, honestly," she shrugged, "I didn't see him where I was, I mean besides in that alternate universe Hell thing Crowley showed me."
"Don't move," he said before he ran out of the ward, almost tripped on the door, and not long after he returned with a pack of condoms and a bottle of lube. Dean grinned gleefully as he walked to the table where Cas was, and towered over the other man. "Damn, you really didn't move. I might have some thoughts to do with you in the future, Cas."
Dean didn’t know whether Sam knew that he wanted to be with Cas, or probably something else, but he couldn’t help to smile at Sam’s statement.
Cas smiled to the red-haired girl and received the remote that she offered, “That would be nice. Thank you, Charlie. Sam, would it be alright if Juliet stayed in your room tonight?”
“I, uh, what time you’re picking up your brother and niece, again? It’s on Friday, right? Tomorrow?” Dean’s face was looking to his side, and somehow Cas could see that the side of his face had freckles across the smooth skin.
Since it was Crowley who asked Castiel come with him to the place, both men rode in Crowley’s car. When they arrived, Castiel quickly bee lined to his favourite spot, in the corner and facing the entrance door. According to him, he could watch most of the room from that place, and he enjoyed looking around the place, watching people and how they would eat their food.
“I want you,” the talled man confessed, while cupping Cas’ face and kissed him chastely, “but I can’t tonight. I honestly didn’t intended to make you stay before, or anything more than that.”
“No one!” Castiel replied instantly, too quick even for his own good, then he snatched his phone from his brother’s hand. He knew that he
That they had made Chuck practically useless, it should be something to celebrate. But, the job isn't finished, they still have to return the population of Earth. They have to bring back Eileen, and Cas.
Now it was Cas’ turn to laugh. “Yes! I used to think that way as well!” his face flushed, when Sam got up and took few steps to give him a high-five.
Dean took out his phone and dialled the number of the dental practice and waited until someone picks up.
Sammy nodded with his mouth full at that. The two boys were silent for few moments, before Sam started again, “So, is this someone you’d like to know more, hence the taking home?”
He almost jumped from the chair when he heard the low voice, and when Dean looked up there stood the man he was panicking for. “Jesus, Cas! You scared me.”
"That's actually why we summoned you. Well, summoned Death in this matter," Dean's voice softened when he heard Crowley's question. Then he paused dramatically and sat next to Jack before he continued, "Cas was taken to The Empty a few days ago, and I want to rescue him."
“Yup,” Dean answered, at the same time his phone made a chirp. He turned the gadget over to see who sent him a message (though he already had a name in mind).
"Cas," Dean let out a relieved sigh when he heard Cas spoke, that confirmed that The Empty was honest with his words. Dean moved forward and embraced Castiel in a hug. Completely ignorant of the look in The Empty and Crowley's eyes on them.
From their friendship, Dean would admit that Gabriel was actually an attractive guy, although he wasn’t precisely his type. He was cheeky, smart, and always knew how to push everyone’s buttons in a playful sort of way, including Dean’s. But once he was annoyed, it could clearly be apparent, and it would be wise to avoid long conversations with him until his mood lightened.
"I'll call you," Dean whispered so close to Cas' ear, that he almost hoping Dean would give him a peck on the cheek. The taller man gave Cas a light wave, before his presence was replaced by Balthazar, who gave Cas a hug.
. Around three years since the brothers lost their mother, and their father started the cursed hunter’s life. It was a case along Route 77, the information was accompanied by a skull face drawing made by one of the victims.
“Are you telling him about …?” Dean paused his question for a second, as if waiting for Cas to continue.
“Aaw, you’re very loving, my love,” Balthazar stretched his arm over Cas’ face to run the back of his hand on Dean’s cheek, who ignored it and continue eating.
The little brother was sweeping his hair off his face before continued his talk with the dentist. “Okay, okay, I have my reason to pick Gabriel. What about you, Cas?”
Mick chuckled and then pointed to the shelf next to the desk, “There should be a roll of toilet paper there. You can use it for cleaning up.”
It had been three months since Castiel started working on this particular project with the university. He enjoyed the relaxing atmosphere of doing the project with the team, along with the pay. The students and professors whom he worked with were friendly, helpful, and adorable. Along the way, he befriended one of the Masters’ students in the team, Charlie Bradbury, a video game and pop culture geek who enjoyed life and also a fantastic wing-woman for Castiel. Probably as expected with her interest, Charlie took Latin and German for her undergraduates, and now she currently studied Language Studies for her Masters.
Cas smiled reading Dean’s rant on his phone, so he put down the beddings on the coffee table and replied.
“Oh, anyway, I was rude,” Amara stood up and walked towards the host of the house, “thank you so much for doing this, Rebecca. Metatron had filled Me in about you, and I’m sure you can write the gospel of the Winchesters better than My brother when he was a prophet. My name’s Amara, I’m Chuck’s twin sister, and now I’m taking his throne in Heaven.”
It wasn’t an immense interrogation. The brothers were only asking the whereabouts of the children from the case they found, and whatever answer the vamp-mime would give, he would end up dead anyway. At this point, it would be the vampire’s call. Whether he would be dead from the big brother’s machete, fast and clean, no muss and no fuss, by giving him the straight answer. Or he could refuse to provide them with answers and suffered from the little brother’s pocket knife, where he would keep sawing and sawing to get the head off. It was no threat when the younger hunter said that the vampire would feel every muscle and every tendon being cut—
Based on the stories Dean told him when they first get acquainted, Sam seemed like a huge role in Dean’s life, and it would be better for Cas to get closer to Dean if Sam liked him.
Charlie might had already suspecting something, considering she was gay herself. Yes, Dean was being stereotypical here.
Castiel looked up to Dean, there was a hint of surprise in his eyes that was mixed with sadness. He was expecting Dean to start talking about the last time he died, that Cas opened up his whole heart to Dean before The Empty claimed him. But turned out, it wasn’t, it was even more painful for him to hear that Dean was having a miserable time after he was gone.
“So, Jack’s asleep. I think he was burned out due to everything that he’d done today,” Sam walked approaching Eileen, as if afraid to lose her again. “Look, Dean, we’ll get Cas back, okay? We’ll look into the books, and we'll ask Rowena or Amara’s help if we must, we will get him back. You deserved it.”
But, he wouldn’t mind. He loved what he saw. From Claire, who was teasing Dean mercilessly about the food they’re currently having, to Gabriel who kept showing off his magic tricks to Sam and Charlie, and Balthazar … who kept helping himself to more serves.
In between Dean called his name almost soundlessly and the sudden emotional-related malfunction of his body, Cas looks up to Dean. The other man was wide-eyed and panic, he helped Cas to get down and sit on the stone floor, before he knelt next to him.
“To make it fair, your scream scared me. I thought she really about to rip you open,” Cas leaned his forehead on Juliet’s head lovingly.
"I-I thought you told me not to change, Dean," the angel finally answered playfully. An answer that brought a sniffled chuckle from Dean, before he pulled Cas again to a hug.
The words from an angel that was in love with him for a long time. Someone who was always by his side, always had faith in him, even when he made all the wrong decisions. An angel who turned his back from his celestial family, from Heaven and from God Himself to be with Dean.
Cooking had always given him a sensation of peace in mind, something that can make him relax after a long hard day at work, or anything else. Sam used to tell him that Dean had a tendency of stress-cooking and stress-baking. There were days when Dean was having a really rough day, and couldn’t sleep it off, and he would bake cookies that could feed the entire neighbourhood. His brother never complained, but Dean noticed that Sam went to the gym more often for
The first five minutes of the drive was spent in silence, and Cas used the quiet time to return his memory to what happened in his practice before with Dean. He wasn’t sure if he could ever forget Dean’s touch to his face. He wanted to feel it again.
When they arrived at the bunker, Sam helped to open the garage door, so Dean can drive his Baby inside. Once they were inside, Sam closed the door and followed Dean.
Cas felt a familiar warmth on the bottom of his stomach whenever Dean laughed. The beautiful baritone sound of his laughter made the dark-haired man felt like home, like he was relaxing on his childhood bed in the Novak house, the most comfortable place he had ever known. He loved how Dean laughed with his whole body, how the man will shut his eyes tight and bark out a train of laughter, at times he even threw back his head and clapped his hands.
“What?” again, the eye-rolling from Crowley made Castiel laughed, “Not everything should end up in sex, Crowley. We both had a good dinner, talk, and he went home after we exchanged number. That’s all.”
“Misha’s fine, Dean. Thank you for asking,” right after he answered that, Cas quickly understood the feelings of proud parents when someone was asking about their children. Little trivial things really could give a certain warmth to the insides. “You’re working early tomorrow, Dean?”
“No worries, Cas, and, uh, I know we were planning on a dinner for both of us. But, uh, now that Sammy and Charlie knew, do you still want it to be just us or …?”
They started to think of making dinner when Sam began to feel slightly tipsy from drinking too much wine. Rowena once again made use of her demon minion to go and fetch them dinner, which this time came as a surprise to both Sam and Dean.
He stood up (still with Misha on his shoulder) and took out his phone from his bag, then returned to the sofa and searches for Dean’s number. After a few attempts on typing with Misha head-butting the phone repeatedly while purring, Castiel finally could made a proper message.
"Interesting," Rowena smiled while continuing reading the page. It seemed that she had accustomed to reading the puzzling code of Book of the Damned. Or she simply had the perks to auto-translate/decode the book now she's the Queen of Hell. Whichever it was, Rowena seemed to be able to read the page smoothly, compared to when they first encountered the book.
As Charlie asked that, Dean was suddenly got hit with a realisation that his brother is the only one who’s straight in the car, as far as he knows. A thought that brought smile to his face, of the absurd randomness.
“Okay,” Dean answered almost soundlessly, then he slide open the door. The first part was hanging closet. Cas owned a number of suits, most of them are black and dark blue. He also owned some shirts, plain and plaid.
Soon after he said that, Dean shut his mouth tight, it was like he realised that he just repeated the word ‘okay’ in the same sentence. Cas almost couldn’t stop himself from laughing. Again.
“It was a bullet,” the younger brother, who was responsible for the shot, spoke, “soaked in dead man’s blood.”
“Come on, brother. I’m sure that dentist of yours was as upset as you. You didn’t … you didn’t told him off, did you?” Benny asked, absolutely familiar with Dean and his short temper.
Castiel still turned on his heels on his spot while looking around, Claire was standing next to him, taking photos of the room. There were even two giant beach balls in  bright colours that reminded Castiel highly to Tweedledee and Tweedledum. He chuckled at a wide toothy smile decoration on top of one of the small stalls that sell various main course (one of the had “grilled rolling lamb” written in the style of a child).
took you here, huh?” Cas smiled. A different kind of smile that he had before for Dean. The same loving smile, only it was more to platonic than romantic.
He knew that Rowena was one of the Winchesters' worst enemies back then. Yet, somehow things seemed to change after that night when she was furious for Crowley's death and confronted Billie. A weird night that started with her killing people, and somehow wanted to kill Sam, but ended with her and the brothers sharing a six-pack while pouring their hearts out about parenting and being children.
"Okay!" Gabriel clapped his hands together, "I think it's time for us to leave, so the staffs can start on their closing procedures. Samsquatch! Lead us the way!" He slung his arms on Cas and Dean's shoulders, then lead the little group outside.
Dean smiled as he offered his elbow for Rowena to grab as they walked to the others on the centre table. After Rowena went to sit in front of Sam, who looked confused with one of the books he read, Dean leaned his bottom on the table next to the other four people who were sitting on.
A faint chuckle was heard from Dean’s side, “Sure, Cas, you can ask. He’s asked mostly about you, where did we meet and how. You know, the kind of questions mothers usually asked when they knew their child have a boyfriend or girlfriend.”
Sam paused his eating and looked straight to his brother, looking for something he could use as hints. Nothing, so he decided to ask.“You’re inviting someone? Who?”
“H-h-hello, Dean,” he replied almost soundlessly. Little did Dean knew, Cas had his hands fisted his own pants, and hoping that his erection won’t show in an obvious way. Though, it’s probably a lost cause.
He gulped the whisky as the room came to his vision, hoping that the alcohol could help him to function better. Carefully, Dean opened the door and looked inside the room.
Blue Remington probably not the name that you would expect from a bar, it sounded more like a lounge in some cheesy 80’s action film. The one with smokes flowing lazily to the air from the tables, gloomy and noir. Then on the platform, there was a man in a tuxedo playing the grand piano while the singer in a long dress that swept the floor serenaded the customers in her deep and husky voice.
Fortunately, Rowena might have noticed the odd air between the hunter and his angel, she hopped off from the war table and walked towards Jack. “Well, now that you both had found each other,
“Hey, you two, holiday meeting in an hour. Meeting hall, second floor,” announced a man with majestic greyish mane and bush of beard, who stepped into the teacher’s room.
They talked about the moments that were missing throughout the twelve years of them knowing each other, they laughed about the stupidity that happened between them. They also thought that they should give Sam an apology present for giving them a hard time with their bickering.
say anything about it. It was strange that he didn't say anything at all to his little brother, one of the very few people that he could trust with anything, even his own life.
"That was the time Cas chose to tell me about the deal, and told me about his true happiness," Dean paused as he smiled, and he knew his voice started to shake. "Cas found out that he could be happy in just being, in just saying, instead of having what he wanted. So he did. He said it to me. That he loves me."
Castiel turned to find Charlie standing in front of him, she looked fresh from the shower and offered him a can of beer. Or maybe it was Charlie who found him sitting on the swing in the backyard, trying to process what had happened since he and Charlie arrived at this lake house.
"Having a sibling who you can spend a good time with. Even now as you both had grown up," Dean answered,
“Hey! What’s with the shallow remarks?” Dean protested, and Balthazar stepped back with a chuckle. “So, what’s going on here? Exhibition? Or anything else?”
It took him around five minutes to decide which one to wear first, before finally deciding to sit there a little longer. The bed was really comfortable, and he almost fell asleep
“Oh, come on, Dean. You don’t want to make Cas jealous, aren’t ya?” Charlie grinned to Cas, who was blushing furiously.
Bela looked around to the colourful interior in the room. “Well, a pair of artists wanted to make a private exhibition of their latest work. It’s interesting how one’s passionate on candies and sweets and the variations, while the other one was good at exploring mediums for his artworks.”
. We had a quick chat, and he even gave me a glass of water and an Aspirin, then offered me breakfast. That was odd, right?” Castiel took another scoop of the bucket chips before he continued his story. “I mean, it’s like he’s doing this every other weekend to his roommate’s one night stand partners.”
Castiel opened the small wine rack next to the fridge and took out one of the Chateau Bordeaux wine bottles. He knew that his parents wouldn't miss it if one bottle was missing from their collection. He opened the bottle and inhaled the aroma before bringing it to the kitchen island. While at the same time, Charlie practically raid each cabinet looking for wine glasses.
Castiel gave his best smile to the man who was standing and towered behind his chair. “Well, I’m the oldest one here, so I guess yeah, I can go with you,” he then turned to Charlie. “Mind holding down the fort while I help him for a bit?”
Castiel’s chuckle could be heard filling Dean’s car, “I think if I had a car like yours, I’ll drive everywhere as well, Dean.”
“Huh. Okay. So, that was the story of Dean Winchester,” Dean felt another stroke of blush went through his face as he saw the man in front of him was looking back at him with a curious state. He cleared his throat before keeping the conversation going, “Hey, I feel like coffee, you want anything, Cas?”
Cas chuckled as Dean stutter, “It should. Okay, I’ll take my shower now. Thank you very much, Dean.”
Dean took the opportunity and crashed his mouth to Cas' as he started thrusting at a punishing pace. He moved his hands to Cas' buttocks to grip it tightly as he kept on pumping. It didn't take long for Dean to feel his climax building, he let Cas' hair go so the man above him could lift himself up a bit and they looked at each other.
“Ah, I’ll take your word for it, then. I was thinking of falling asleep in the middle, but you convinced me,” Dean sounded so happy when saying this, true the sleepiness in his voice was disappeared.
Abaddon's cheerful voice ambushed the heavy situation between the two men. If Castiel had to be honest, he almost threw the glass in his hand out of surprise.
That was all it took for Samuel Winchester to have a light-bulb moment on his mind, and his expression brightened in mere seconds at the realisation of the critical information. Then he looked to his big brother swiftly before practically jumped from his chair to give Jack a crushing hug. He then dashed with all of his large limbs to the direction that can only be guessed as the car garage.
After the weird morning after, Castiel met up with his sister, Abaddon, who was also on her share of post one night stand morning. They had a nice breakfast over the stories related to their adventure the previous night.
Castiel almost choked on his tea reading the message. Dean just asked him to call? Did something happen to him? Cas tapped Dean’s number on his screen and waited for the other man to answer, while pacing up and down his living room, with Misha’s blue eyes following him.
“Sammy was the one who’s fond of animals. We used to own a dog when we were kids, a golden retriever, they were inseparable. The only time Sammy didn’t have Bones with him was when he’s in school.”
came across Dean’s mind to put it on his bucket list or any list of possibilities that could happen in his life. But having Rowena - the Mother of Crowley of all people! - to hugged and consoled him over the death of a man he loved? Even one Dean Winchester could never saw that coming. He didn’t even know that Rowena still had that much of maternal side in her, that she decided to unleash to Dean at this very moment.
He looked to Castiel’s eyes, that were looking back at him with a tender fondness and smile, that sent warmth to his chest. “Dean Winchester … he, uh, he lives with his younger brother. Probably similar to that Novak boy, only the role was reversed. He was the one who looked after his younger brother, and has been doing it all his life.”
Dean chuckled when he heard what his old friend said, "Well, maybe what you said was right, people around us tend to die whenever they want to help us. Which, I believe an apology is in order, that you had to die when you helped us the last time."
“Great. Oh, here’s the menu, I’ll tell you if there’s anything kale in here,” Dean smiled to the waiter who brought him the menu, and started to browse, “right, so they do have a kale salad, I think there were two kinds of them. And then there’s … kale soup, and uh, here’s pasta. Wow, I never realised they got this much of kale menu, Cas. I didn’t even know how to cook it? Do you know, Cas?”
“What if,” Dean started again, “I pick you up and we have dinner at my place? Leave your car at work or somewhere, then when it’s time for you to go, I’ll drive you to your car? How does that sound?”
Lucifer worked as a lawyer in New York City. Legend has it that he was fierce and ferocious, won almost every case that came to him and he was popular among the big names in the big Apple. Castiel didn’t actually want to know
Dean opened the garage door before he got inside Baby, followed by Cas. When he turned the engine on, the radio blasted the song by Belinda Carlisle,
It was a fight that he and his brother would be familiar with; the dodging, the attacks, the swing of the machete to the head. In a short time, both of them had each downed two vamp-mimes, with two left to fight. Which should be like a walk in the park.
Another reason that he was close to Gabriel because he’s the only one in the family who knew about his preferences. He didn’t even have the heart to tell Claire about this.
The rest of their journey was filled with laughter and teasing from the three other people in the car, and Dean as the one with the grunting and groaning in protest.
Castiel chuckled at his children, “Seriously, guys, do you really have to fight about this? You guys are actually older than you look, you know, and I need some peace on my weekend.”
Dean made sure that Castiel heard every word whispered into his ear while having his hand pumping Cas' cock slowly. Devastatingly slow.
The new Death squinted at Dean before he picked up where the conversation left off, "I assumed this has something to do with that blush on your face and the fastened heartbeat of yours, Dean."
wait. I’m sure of it,” again, she let out a mischievous smile. “I’ll let him know that you’re busy with your companions, okay?” she shouldered her uncle’s arm playfully, before turning to Dean’s group. “I’m gonna get back to Gabriel now. Nice meeting you all tonight. See ya around!”
The insides of his torso were being very busy, with all the drumming in the chest and fluttering in his stomach. Dean couldn’t recall when was the last time he felt like this. He had to lean back on his chair, since he was quite sure any longer he put pressure to the table, it would break.
“So, Cas, Claire is your only niece?” Dean carried on the talk between them while cutting his chicken.
Claire's laughter got even louder at Castiel's remark. It took her a while to calm down and continue the conversation like proper human being until they reached Cas' apartment. It had been a while since Cas felt this kind of comfort, that can only be filled when Gabriel and Claire around. He was on cloud nine and not ready to come down anytime sooner.
“Thank you, Dean,” Jack might have the body of a twenty-something young man, but clearly his aura is of a child.
Dean smiled weakly to Rowena before he got up to his feet, “Nothing. We were just ... assessing the situation. So, hey, how’re y’all doing?” He walked closer to the Queen of Hell to provide her with a warm hug. Dean didn’t even realise that he actually
He walked back to his room and let out a long sigh as he sat down on the edge of his bed. But as soon as his bum touched the mattress, something just hit him. He would have Castiel sleeping next to him on this very bed.
Cas raised both of his hands and looked at them as if it was the first time he saw them, he then slithered them from his shoulder and further to his shoulder blades, as if searching for something. A few moments later, he gasped as if he just discovered something, then he started pawing his own chest.
Dean then placed his forehead on Cas', as he took a deep breath, hoping that Cas would be calmer. After a few moments, he felt that Cas' breathing had steadied and Dean also felt the angel before him was gripping his jacket.
“Yeah, my name’s Castiel Dmitri Novak. I think Dmitri was one of my father’s old relatives’ name, I wasn’t sure. Never asked as well.”
Castiel looked around. He noticed small groups of families in every other table. Some in their casual wear and some seemed ready for their weekend getaway at the mountains or the beach. Some booths were occupied with the kinds like himself and Abaddon — who spent the night nowhere near home and stopped by here to have breakfast before going home.
“Okay, your name, Sir?” the woman on the line asked accompanied by faint sounds of clicking keyboard.
Claire sighed, “I don’t know, Dad. That place just gives you the feel of a safe and cosy place,” the daughter took a bite of her smoked beef sandwich. After a few moments of chewing, she turned to her father, “You know, why don’t you take Uncle Gabe there? I bet you two would love to hang out there and do your … weekly
Gabriel was the one who always stood for Castiel, whenever their father or older siblings started to pick on him for not "following the family values". Castiel admired Gabriel's bravery back then, and now. He told their father that he didn't want any part of the family business if that means he had to live with the suffocating rules and standards of the House of Shurley. He would rather be having a fun time of his life learning the business and start one of his own. He used most of his savings from their mother, right before she passed away.
keep a secret that big and decided to reveal it as your death wish. How long have you kept it? A year? It’s just not fair, not for you and not for everybody else.”
At least he could give Cas a hand sign to stop interrupting him. Dean took a deep breath as he tried to compose himself to continue. It took him a while, but he finally could collect himself before he looked up to Cas again with a smile, although he couldn’t help his tears from falling. “Thank you for loving me all this time, Cas.”
Castiel barked a burst of laughter, "Really, Charlie? From all the mess that happened before, you got time to eye my cousin?"
Gabriel found out about you, and now I’m going to have a nice girly talk with him. About Juliet, that sounds nice, Dean. Please make sure Sam’s okay with babysitting Juliet.
"Yeah, she is," Dean softened when he saw Rowena was practically throwing ingredients into Sam's hands to carry. Then when his eyes caught Crowley, teasing his mother and Sam, he suddenly remembered something. "Oh, sorry, Eileen, I've got something to ask Crowley."
“Huh,” Sam chuckled, “well, maybe if Dean and I didn’t live together, we won’t know much about each other as well. Hey, come on, let’s get something to eat!”
"Well, I can try that," he finally said. "So, maybe we won't need a lot of time, I mean we won't need 24 hours to do that. Could you make it a two-hour window, Rowena?"
“One of these days, Cas, I’m gonna come over to your place and bring great horror movies. I’m gonna make you watch it,” Dean threatened playfully.
"Yeah, the whole Dante Alighieri," Dean smiled. Not a cheeky smile, but more to painful. As absurd as it sounded, but he felt like Purgatory was that one place where he had the most remarkable history with Cas. "It was a lifetime ago where Ca-Cas worked with your son to find it. He, uh, Cas needed some souls to fight his brother, Raphael, and Crowley mentioned Purgatory."
Surprisingly this didn’t bother Dean a little bit, especially if he remembered his past relationship, where he would be the protective and jealous one. Perhaps because it was Balthazar, one of his closest friends, and he knew that he was serious about having great care for Castiel.
“Just saying, brother. Something different on this dentist, then?” Benny copied Dean’s gesture on the chair, waiting for the answer of his question.
Dean couldn’t help himself to laugh when he saw Cas was trying with all his might to stop the giant Rottweiler (yes, still not a puppy) from jumping to the front seat and joining the two men.
It was a man, probably younger than both brothers, tried to gain his consciousness from what just hit him in the head, or forehead in his matter. The young vampire groaned and asked, “What’d you hit me with?”
