“John, I understand a lot more than you give me credit for. We’ve known one another for ten years and yet you’re always amazed at how much I know,” Sherlock told him, slightly exasperated but he endeavoured to keep his voice calm.
“I suppose you’re right,” he said. “None of this is normal, but it’s not as unusual as you think. Loads of people are werewolves. It’s just not common knowledge, like how Muggles don’t know about wizards.”
If anyone had dared to ask John what the worst day of his life was, they wouldn’t have received an answer. That wasn’t because John would have purposely ignored them, or that he simply hadn’t had any bad days, but because he simply couldn’t choose just one bad day to mention.
Because, and the simple truth remained, Sherlock was dangerous. That really was all there was to it.
"Well, it looks beautiful," John smiled. "And you look beautiful, wet back and all." At that, Sherlock smiled, wrapping her legs around John's middle. "So stunning," John continued, carefully reaching round and gently pulling Sherlock's hair out of the bun. Sherlock's cheeks burned pink, and she quickly pecked John's lips.
He shuffled comfortably where he sat, legs tucked underneath him as he sunk further down into his favourite black armchair. From this spot he could just about make out the globe perched on its spindle, but that was only if he craned his neck far enough to peer around the slithers of bookshelves. He chanced a careful glance at it as he flicked over the pages of his latest book, just to check that it was still there, before carrying on with page 372.
“I thought I was. I’ve been looking for my soulmate for years, I’m not about to lose them over the rent.”
“One minute away,” Sherlock replied, sipping his champagne. He handed Rosie a glass of sparkling apple juice. “You look cold.”

“Now, I can escort you to A&E or you can come with me to the nearest first aid kit, wherever that may be.”
The stream really wasn't that deep. Five centimetres in depth in the centre was the absolutely maximum, but somehow both Sherlock and John ended up dripping wet, clinging onto one another as the ice cold water spilled down the back of Sherlock's plain white t-shirt, making her yelp. John grinned, hovering above her.
"Believed to be working for the devil, many women during the medieval period in Europe were hunted, trialled and very often killed under the false accusation of being witches.
Sherlock nodded, and they continued to John’s stuffy flat together, clutching each other’s hands and their coffee for warmth; both uncertain about what the future would bring, but resolute that as long as the other was a participant of that future, they would be perfectly happy.
“Basically, what I'm trying to say is that if you hadn't appeared in my life when you did I wouldn't be as happy as I am now. You’ve given me so much, Sherlock. So much and I can never repay you properly. Sure, you drive me crazy,” at that, Sherlock shrugged. Not even attempting to deny it. “But you helped me to live in a prime London spot. You helped me when Harry was being Harry. You helped me to see the side of London I'd never have seen otherwise. I owe you so much, and I appreciate you infinitely more so.”
Sherlock wondered to himself, just as whatever it was poked the base of Sherlock’s neck with something wet and cold. Sherlock’s breath hitched. The sand paper was dragged against his face once more.
Ordering a takeaway wasn’t a rarity for them. Sherlock found cooking boring and John was terrible at it. Sherlock recalled with some fondness the time John had attempted to cook a roast dinner and managed to burn everything except the stuffing, which remained resolutely sloppy in the oven alongside the blackened chicken.
They sipped coffee in the crowed café as the rain poured down, and they took it in turns carrying Rosie. They saw giraffes and penguins and red pandas, and under the pretence of friends they discussed the mindless things that friends usually talked about. They laughed, they irritated one another, and for the first time in a while they felt comfortable with one another. Sherlock even willingly took photographs of John and Rosie together, and then sent them to John after filtering the good from the bad.
He knew that something was happened, but he daren’t look. He heard a roar. No, surely not. A car engine. A motorbike. Sherlock squeezed his eyes shut. He was delirious. He ached.
John watched the car roll down the driveway from where he stood at the kitchen sink. His shirt sleeves were rolled up to his elbows and the cardigan he wore bunched up around the buttons, staying away from the soapy water his hands were buried in.
“Sorry. I know it’s not ideal,” John added, heaping coffee into two mugs. “But I need the space.” John bustled back into the room and put a mug of steaming coffee next to Sherlock.

“You’ll regret this,” Sherlock said, pushing himself up onto his feet. He was shaking. He fought to keep his voice level. “You will.”
“Sing De.” John remembered Rosie saying excitedly on one such occasion, the eve before her third birthday. “Sing De!”
It was John’s granddaughter’s name, written in Rosie’s handwriting so that John could see for himself.
Sherlock had called her a narcissist and sent her the link to a full-length mirror available in a flat-pack furniture store. Another case came from a man in Bristol. He wrote to complain that his carrots kept dying and that someone was poisoning them. Surprisingly, he was correct.
“I must be going out of my mind,” the man smiled, more to himself than to Sherlock. Gingerly he accepted the book, but Sherlock’s gaze stayed on him, keenly curious about what the Irish accented man was talking about.
“It’s not, I just…” John’s voice trailed away. “I didn’t think that would be the type of thing you’d be interested in.”
“You’d think,” John began, pinching the bridge of his nose, “she would understand that I have more things to think about right now than her bloody stupid girlfriend.”
John rolled his eyes as he came to the conclusion that Sherlock didn’t understand, shot him a glare, then stormed off out of the room.
“You’re such an idiot,” John told him, throwing his head back as he laughed at the sky. The thunder grumbled, chortling with him. “Oh, Sherlock. You’re so stupid.”
“Well, thank you, John and Rosie,” Sherlock hummed, tapping his pocket. “It’ll take pride of place on my fridge.”
"For most, their death was unjustifiable, with no actual evidence to warrant their being a 'witch'. On the off few occasions however, the prosecutors were close to being right. As the women being executed often had a small connection to one of the five Harths, who were the first to posses the gene. It's believed that each of them possessed one of the Wu Xing, an ancient Chinese philosophy regarding the five elements. However, seeing as no one has had an Ability such as one of those within the last one hundred years, and that no direct decedents can be traced, it's most likely to be rubbish.
Sergeant Donovan stood chatting to a curious resident, hiding behind her front gate in her dressing gown, a steaming mug of tea in her hands.
“No. It’s your own fault we’re out here,” Harry snapped. “I don’t care if your legs are tired. You should hurry up and grow up.” She pressed onwards, stepping over a fallen branch. “If we ever find that bloody teddy, I’ll rip it’s head off.”
“It’s not and it wasn’t. You know I’d never lie to you. I merely failed to tell you the whole truth.”
Hello. Just about made it within the next day goal lol. Today has been hectic. This chapter is a little slow, sorry! But it’s the last one tomorrow! :D
He knew they weren’t suited to one another, and he knew that the man would drive him insane if they spent anymore than two hours in one another’s company. A few hours alone in a desperately dower motel was one thing, but Sherlock knew that if they were to spend the night together he would definitely regret it. Because before it actually happened he was free to imagine it. He was allowed to mould scenarios of what his life would be like with Mr Used-Car Salesman, closeted bisexual with three children.
Within the few narrow nanoseconds it took for John to register what had happened and managing to take full advantage of John's stall: Sherlock retook his previous position of pinning John against the wall, hand pressed against his shoulder and pushing the distressed teenager further in to the matt-white, holding him there and rendering him helpless as a result. John wheezed, apparently winded from Sherlock's punch. After ensuring that there were no other possible attempts John could make to harm Sherlock, Sherlock leaned in and opened his mouth to speak, but John beat him to it.
"Nearly there," his Dad soothed, and Sherlock gripped his Dad's jacket tighter. It felt as though they'd been in the building for an hour, but in truth it was barely pushing a minute since the bell had first started ringing.
“You know it was.” A voice floated up to Sherlock’s bedroom, and John stilled. “Bloody hell, what happened to you?”
“That wasn’t a real relationship,” John chuckled. The gingernuts crunched as he sat down. “You were only with her to get to Magnussen.”
The whole building was a maze of long white corridors with grey carpet and water stations, that would bore anyone stupid should they spend too long there.
For around half an hour, he found himself wandering aimlessly around the pristine parliament. Whereas The Houses of Parliament were buildings of intricate detail, full of large rooms and beautiful architecture; The Harth Parliament looked rather like a set of offices both inside and out. Because that's essentially what they were.
Sherlock shrugged. “You tell me. I’m a recovering drug addict who’s being babysat more or less 24 hours a day, and you’re a grief stricken widow with a boring job, a lovely daughter, and a house in the suburbs.”
"Name badge," she repeated, stalking past him on narrow heeled green shoes. Her hair was tied in a messy French plait, her dark brown roots standing out a mile against her dyed blonde hair as it frizzed in different directions, and her grotesquely green three-piece suit was stiff around her as she walked. Sherlock could've sworn he heard the crunch of the material bend as she sat down behind her neatly organised desk.
His index finger dipped into the crook of the letters, carved into the metal and filled in a rich black acrylic. He didn't need to look at it to know what it said. It had said the same thing for the past 11 years:
Their first kiss had taken place on a perfectly ordinary Sunday morning. Sherlock had brought John an anniversary card.
“Which begs the question of how they attained that job in the first place,” Sherlock hummed. He took the stairs two at a time, and John followed him, feeling considerably more relaxed being in Sherlock’s company.
“No, it’s fine, I’ll go up to your room in a minute,” he said, somewhat breathlessly. “I could do with a lie-down.”
"No, John, this is the right book," he held it up for 'John' to see. John sighed and folded his arms across his chest, just for something to do with them. He looked uneasy, but not unsociable to the point that he didn't know how to act in ordinary conversations. It struck Sherlock as odd, at any rate, as John gazed sympathetically at the man before him, who continued talking. "I just... Do you ever feel like you're being watched?"
Slowly, she stood up and picked the tin of biscuits off the kitchen counter - desperate times call for desperate measures – and began her journey upstairs.
Upon reaching the office, Sherlock found the closed doorway flanked by two armed guards. Sherlock nodded slightly, impressed by the fear surrounding the teenager, and allowing theory after theory to run wild around his mind. God, he thought, eyes raking over the two men, what's this guy done?
John started laughing, heartily, and Sherlock laughed too, until they were both fighting for breath that hadn’t been taken from them as a result of covid-19.
“So you deciding to fight off the old age by letting your idiotic barber give you a quiff,” Sherlock supplied, stepping out of the way of a large gaggle of tourists as they chatted to one another.
“Keep your voice down,” Jim snarled, suddenly looking daggers. While John had been talking, Jim’s eyes had been as round as saucers, full of sympathy and kindness. Now however, they were back to the coal; dark and setting alight with anger as John clenched his jaw shut, realising that he had upset Jim.
John chuckled. He wasn’t sure whether it was from the cold or the conversation, but they were both blushing a deep crimson.
"It's not nice, is it?" She beamed, and Sherlock quickly shook her head. John watched as the water soaked through Sherlock's dungarees; creating a dark patch of blue against the rest of the denim. "Cold, isn't it?" She continued, and Sherlock wriggled around madly. John would have thought she was distressed if she didn't know better.
He remembered Mary, informing him as she informed the rest of the church of their daughter’s name. It transpired later that Mary had named Rosie after herself, and while Rosie had taken that name and shirked it of ever belonging to her mother (“were you named after Rosamund Pike?”), John knew that should he have had the option he would have named Rosie something else entirely.
“You can talk to me, you know,” John said later that evening. They sat in front of the fire, Sherlock plucking at the strings of his violin. Rosie was asleep upstairs.
“Sherlock needed to be there to confirm that Sergeant Rose was the man in Karachi,” John thought to himself as he watched Sherlock hail a cab, visibly shaking. John tugged his jumper off and helped Sherlock shrug away the coat. Sherlock pulled the jumper on. It was baggy on him, surprisingly so. He pulled the coat on over it and clambered into the taxi, rubbing his gloved hands in an attempt to warm up.
“John, get back,” she whispered urgently. John either chose to ignore her or simply didn’t hear her. “John, please. Get back.”
Sleep washed over Sherlock in small waves, dragging him under for a brief period before the swash woke him up again. Though-out the night he checked on the wolf, which remained sound asleep for the most of the night.
John yawned, and Sherlock watched in horror as the thick hair began to fall out in his hands. Clump after clump of thick wolf fur simply bunched up in Sherlock’s hands.
“Why would he?” Mycroft asked, a little humour edging into his voice as he looked up at John. “The man won’t even see a therapist, why do you think he’d tell you?”
“If there’s a family signet ring you’re automatically rich,” John said simply. “Those are the rules.”
He had been stupid not to see it, he thought, as the men turned around to face him. Sherlock ricocheted off one of their muscular backs and landed squarely on his arse in the damp alleyway, his hands doing what they could to cushion the fall. He realised his mistake when a sharp slice tore through his hand. He’d smacked his hand directly onto a shard of glass, and hissed in pain.
“How do you feel?” He asked, standing again. He crossed over to Sherlock and while Sherlock all but lay across the armchair, John pressed his hand against Sherlock’s forehead.
John had been told that meeting your soulmate was incomparable to anything. It was supposed to be blinding, all consuming.
“She is facing redundancy, John,” Sherlock mumbled, not sitting up from his slouching position. “She has every right to be a little tense.”
“Is it nice?” Sherlock had asked at lunch, in between mouthfuls of Pici Cacio e Pepe. “Suburbia, I mean? I’ve never asked you too much about your home. Mary owned the house, didn’t she? She bought it before you were married.”
John’s eyes narrowed a fraction, and he released Sherlock’s elbow with such aggression that made Sherlock wish he’d just held on.
The loose root of a tree snaked its way around Harry’s ankle and Harry tripped, falling to the ground with an almighty thud. She held John close, trapping him under her body as John whimpered quietly, trying to get another look at what had followed them.
Sherlock rolled his eyes, veering right into an alleyway between the gym and the student union and marching through it. It was barely wide enough for two people to walk side-by-side, and Sherlock took the lead to make it easier.
“No we don’t. I do look at the cost, Sherlock, and special discount or not you pay way more than me. I’m not stupid. I know that half the time you put the money back into my account.”
“I love you,” Sherlock replied. He took John’s free hand. “And maybe I don’t have to be completely happy in my job,” he said, looking down at his and John’s hands. “Because I know that as long as I have you, I’ll be the happiest man in the world.”
He shook himself, coming out of his trance and going back to glaring at the picture. However, his concentration was lost completely by the sound of the fire alarm echoing around the school building.
“There’s a thunderstorm and we’re by the sea,” Sherlock replied, keeping his voice levee. “I don’t fancy being struck by lightning today, do you?”
“Would you actually just fuck off?” The man grunted, rolling his ripped shirt sleeve up to inspect a long, sweeping graze across his elbow. “I don’t need your help.”
“John,” Sherlock sighed, his head lolling back. “After all these years you still think you can get away with lying to me. Honestly, it’s like you don’t know me at all.”
They’d been through too much together to resort to lying now. Neither of them would stoop low enough. Both of them knew what lying would do to the other. Neither of them had a secret too horrendous to not tell one another. Not anymore. There were no more secrets between them; John had been at the receiving end of far too many lies to stomach anymore.
Standing up and stretching, Sherlock began to glance over the bookshelves aligning the walls. Thickly bound novels of intricately designed drawings and diagrams met his eye,  all depicting far too complicated explanations for what was really an all too obvious fact.
“I am bloody running!” Harry shouted back, the taste of iron filling her mouth as she ran as fast as she could, jumping over a-
"What're you looking for?" She asked, pressing the palms of her hands against the slippery pebbles and rocks in a bid to stable herself. "Experiment or just curious?"
“John,” he found himself saying. “John Watson.” He squeezed his eyes shut, trying to acclimatise them to the colour.
It was only then that John realised that it wasn’t a crime scene at all. Lestrade had been vague because Sherlock would know what was going on. Lestrade had been vague because he thought John would know what was going on. He thought Sherlock would have told him.
They weren’t fine. Sherlock was quite certain John had climbed out of the window and was attempting to board a train, having sprinted to King’s Cross. But that was neither here nor there.
They’d been asleep when Lestrade’s call came through, and when John had entered Sherlock’s bedroom to rouse him into action for the day he had been surprised to find Sherlock wrapped up, snoring quietly with an electric blanket on. A hot water bottle stuck out the bottom of the duvet, but the bedroom window was wide open. John sighed unplugged the blanket, closed the window, and surveyed Sherlock closely.
“Where do you think you’re going?” John murmured, his voice as cold as the North Sea crashing against the rocks behind them. “Running away from your problems? Again?”
"Look," she started, the harshness now gone from her voice in an exchange in attempting to be comforting. "Sherlock excels in everything he does, but I can't have him in Mutation. He becomes disruptive, restless, and an all round nuisance. If not for the sake of the others in the class, who actually need to be taught how to hone their Abilities, then at least let me take Sherlock out of this lesson for his own benefit. It's not fair on him. It's a difficult enough world for children without Abilities as it is, without putting them through two hours of learning about what they're supposed to be. I'm sorry, but it's all I can do."
“I forgot to ask,” Jim started talking again, and Sherlock found himself listening intently, coming out of his musings about John’s clothing. “How did it go last night? You went straight to bed, and when I came up you were fast asleep. Was everything alright?”
Silence stretched out like a clumsy beast, ramming itself headlong into bookshelves as at charged hungrily down the aisles. It tumbled down the spiralling staircases like the water from an overflowing bath on the floor above; skipping and bubbling as it washed over eardrums and landed in a heap in the floor, where it then proceeded to shake itself off; ignoring the cuts and bruises as it clambered back onto its feet, before carrying on its rampage at breakneck speed. It muted out the louder sounds with a hazy drone; amplifying the quieter creaks of cracked floorboards instead.
There were two of them now, the black haired man and another he hadn't seen before. Sherlock trod carefully, desperate not to catch their attention. He watched on as the other man frowned.
Stuffing the walkie talkie into his pocket, Sherlock smirked, keeping an eye on the two men as he raised his right index finger. Within an instant, a small flame had come into being, dancing atop the invisible wick as his finger acted as candle. Still watching them, he stuck out his tongue in concentration as he balanced on his tip toes, pointing the finger at the fire alarm of the ceiling.
Sherlock chuckled and nodded, turning back around to face him. He was smiling, excitement overwhelming his face with such modest glee that for a brief moment John was scared that his soulmate was a complete psychopath, grinning about serial killers. As it was, Sherlock tugged on his shirt collar to reveal a fine silver line at the base of his neck, just before it greeted the shoulder. Without the context of the Beheader, John would have automatically assumed it was a hair or simply not noticed it at all it was that faint. He certainly wouldn’t have noticed it if he was still seeing grey.
It was no understatement to say that Sherlock loved John’s legs. The taller teenager loved burying her face into the inside of John’s thigh and blowing raspberries, making John gasp and giggle; her cheeks would flush, and Sherlock tell her that the pink in her cheeks was the prettiest colour. She'd kiss each stretch mark, each mole and each insecurity that John had, holding her hand the whole time and telling her how much she was loved.
"Are you sure? If they don't have it here we could always try a different library. I know you said you only needed it for one reference, but its dirt cheap online--"
"Never tell anyone about that," he seethed as he recompose do himself. Sherlock raised his hand and drew an 'X' across his chest, and John sighed, leaning against the wall. Then, to Sherlock's own confusion, he began laughing.
A few metres away, a squirrel scarpered down from its hiding place higher up in the tree. It stopped as it reached the foot of the trunk, quickly scratching at the side of it’s face as the tail flicked lightly. Its head tilted in the direction of Sherlock, and then towards John, who was silent under the weight of Sherlock’s words. Neither of them noticed the grey spectator, too focused on one another to care. Eventually however, John’s voice box spluttered back into life. The squirrel vanished back up into the tree.
“I’ll die,” John repeated, taking another step backward. “I don’t want to die. I want my teddy and I want mummy and I don’t want to die.”
Sherlock sighed quietly and slouched in his chair, frowning. Harry had been phoning more and more recently. Between her newest relationship falling into disrepair and her job hanging in the balance, Sherlock could understand her anxiety. But did she really have to phone John every second of the day? She was completely taking the attention away from him.
When he’d found Sherlock on the park bench, he’d been wandering around aimlessly, clutching his walking stick. He’d done nothing with his day except wander, too exhausted to do much else. He had only left the flat that morning to get his fill of what limited fresh air London could off him. Naturally, had had gravitated towards the areas of trees in amongst the terraced houses; the quiet suburbs of university-owned homes which doubled as offices had offered a respite from the chaotic stretch of the Euston road.
“What’s wrong with you?” John’s voice sounded again, but Sherlock didn’t reply, blinking at the collection of haggard green blades instead. “Sherlock? I want to help you, honestly, I do-”
Mrs Hudson turned on her heel, and John knew he’d be receiving biscuits with raisins instead of chocolate chips for a while.
Sherlock closed the door behind him. Downstairs, he could hear as John’s first Skype appointment rang out. He sighed quietly and leaned back against the door.
“We can…” Sherlock’s face contorted, as though he was attempting to eat a particularly sour lemon, “date, but I have some rules.”
John knew it was blood, this time. Once he’d almost given himself a heart attack when his sister, Harry, had fallen off a ladder and spilt paint all over herself. John had run out into the garden at the beckon of Harry’s scream to find her sprawled on the ground coated in a thick liquid that was the exact same shade of blood. It had taken Harry a long time to calm John down.
Sherlock had suggested they walk because he didn’t think he could bear the usual familiarities of the back of the cab with John quite so soon. Somehow the excitement of rushing off to a crime scene with John by his side was unbearable.
Sherlock shook his head earnestly. Of course he hadn't started the fire. Was he really that stupid? Why would he set fire to a building he was sitting in? Daft woman.
It ran wild through the building, barely missing the rich mahogany shelving which stood to attention in sharp lines across the expanse room; stationed in high blockades parallel to the arched windows on either side, filtering through the soft early morning sunlight. Dust particles danced and swam in the air, settling on the books that were more unloved than the rest, waiting for someone to run their finger across the cracked leather spines in search for the subject or story they wanted.
The thrill of the chase was so far away, so distinctly missing from their current lives that Sherlock could only equate the loss of it to the death of a loved one.
Sherlock had made a joke that John was getting old, and John had retaliated with a remark that between Sherlock’s constant noise and Rosie’s screaming it was a wonder he wasn’t already completely deaf.
The cool water of the stream ran past John’s ankles and she wriggled her toes as she looked down, taking a quick picture of the way the water curved around her legs. With the cloudless sky and the searing sun beating down on their date, John was thankful for the coolness of the stream. It ran past smoothly, gliding past her legs and babbling away merrily to itself.
Sherlock’s brows knitted together, not understanding any of what John was telling him. Had he missed out on something crucial? It wouldn't have been the first time. He remained silent, waiting for John to explain properly.
“You are.” John chuckled. “You’re a moron. And manipulating you was so easy, because everyone, and I mean everyone, hates you.” John turned to face him. “It was so easy to waltz into your life and pretend to be your friend, for just a little bit. And you lapped it up. Because you piss off everyone you meet. It’s sad, really.”
"Yeah..." As the Irish-accented man replied, and Sherlock made a quick beeline over to the source, stopping in the next aisle to them as he listened in; his back pressed against various anthologies.
one round monotonous of change; yet even she repeats her tune beyond my range. I never watch the scatter'd fire of stars, or sun's far-trailing train, but all my heart is one desire, and all in vain: for I am bound with fleshly bands. Joy, beauty, lie beyond my scope; I strain my heart, I stretch my hands, and catch at hope.”
Hi. Urm... Anyone have any feedback? Please? It'd seriously help me out. And yeah. These parts will never not be awkward.
So, when John announced that he was potentially interested in a relationship with Sherlock, Sherlock found himself slightly lost for words.
"It means I have control of fire." Mrs Merriweather raised an eyebrow, and Sherlock quickly corrected himself. "Fire has control of me."
“Of course not. I told you when we first met: I consider myself married to my work. Besides, I dated Janine and look what happened there,” Sherlock sat down in his armchair again, and John took his own. "Far too much hassle."
Sherlock watched from afar, and a part of him immediately regretted running off. He wanted to prove John right and Jim wrong. If he’d stayed, Jim would’ve looked like an idiot, and Sherlock really did like making people look like idiots.
“The normal way?” Sherlock scoffed. “None of this is normal.” He glared at the back of John’s head, not sure whether he was more annoyed at John for not telling him, or at himself for not seeing it.
Sherlock yelped and lost her balance, falling backwards into the stream as John tumbled with her. John's firm, small hands were pressed against Sherlock's bony shoulders, and both girl laughed heartily, the water breaking around Sherlock's hair as she sprawled out.
IA: Fine. If your 30 second relationship with John hasn’t worked out: do you fancy going for dinner? X
“She’s cheered up now,” Molly explained, tugging the baby carrier off herself. She sighed once she was free. “And she doesn’t have a temperature anymore, either. Hi, Sherlock.”
John nodded, squeezing Sherlock’s hand gently. He knew that Sherlock was aware of this technique, they’d used it on victims before.
The wolf sat down next to the bed and Sherlock watched in part total fear, part amazement, as it carefully bit Sherlock’s trouser leg and tugged it up his calf. His leg was bright purple, and it was only when the wolf showed it to him that Sherlock realised it was definitely broken. He was surprised he hadn’t realised how much it hurt before.
"I dare say it will," he muttered, intrigue still plaguing him as John gulped heavily - the guy certainly knew how to act. "So what's this? Hostage situation?" He continued, and when he felt a distinct shrug from John under his grasp, Sherlock loosened his hold on him slightly.
“John!” Harry gasped, making to grab John again from her position of the ground but John was out of reach, making his way over the wolf with surprising calm.
Stealing himself and working out most of the potential outcomes, he made his way slowly over to them.
“I’m not sure,” Sherlock replied honestly. “We had a few words. John and his self-diagnosed victimisation is going to be his downfall.”
“You forgot the bag. And you don’t sleep very well at night, so your decision must have been something you were mulling over during the night to get here at…” he checked his watch, “9 o’clock in the morning during rush hour on a Monday. The jubilee line is closed for engineering works, too, so you’d have had to catch the circle line which is absolute dedication. Here,” Sherlock strode across the room and extracted a USB memory stick from his laptop. “Some of my more relaxing compositions.” He handed the small silver stick to John. “Plug it into your laptop and download them onto your phone. If you need help, there are tutorials on YouTube. I know how inept you are at technology. I know you like background noise while you sleep.”
Sherlock nodded, putting his chopsticks down. “Good, as always,” he said, then: “John, I’m sorry. I should never have read it. It was private, and I –“
The police officer was a tall man, around 6 foot 2 and incredibly lanky. With a face marred by acne scars and scabs from a bad shave, for a moment John thought that the police officer was a teenager in fancy dress.
Sherlock rolled his eyes, trying to sit up again. “Sound carries too easily from my room. Your patients won’t want to hear someone dying in the background, will they? It would destroy your credibility. And I need to sleep. Your room has a bed.”
“Tommo, Timmo, make sure we’re not disturbed,” Todd said. The two men standing at Sherlock’s 12 o’clock and 6 o’clock departed. One went to the opening of the alleyway behind Sherlock, the other, to the one in front. The other men shuffled to fill the gap. Todd, the man Sherlock had initially been chasing, now stood directly in front of him.
Sherlock would surely run, or act like he’d never read it. John couldn’t decide which was worse, losing Sherlock forever, again, or have Sherlock know and know that it wasn’t reciprocated.
Sherlock blinked. There were only four pages worth of scribbles, but the revelations they possessed made the hairs on the back of Sherlock’s neck stand up. He skimmed through each one, his knees drawn up to his chin with his nose almost flat against the pages, reading impossibly fast, drinking it all in.
No, it wasn't with any of their permission that Sherlock's Ability was announced. It was his formidable teacher who'd phoned the press.
Sherlock hadn’t been proud of that relationship. Not because of the man’s job or even because the man had a wife and four children at home, but because Sherlock had wished it could have become more.
Of course Sherlock wasn't going to go to the paramedics. Instead, he made a swift detour, skirting past a collection of policemen and across the now blocked streets. The smoke from the toilets had now been spotted, and a surge of firemen were rushing into the building. Sherlock took one last glance at the unfolding scene before ducking into an alley way opposite, John still pressed against his chest.
He had to keep reminding himself that no matter what pit he fell down in life, there was at least an attempt at a rope that he could use to pull himself back up again. Occasionally that rope came in the form of the urge to have a shower, or it sounded as the cry of his beautiful daughter. Sometimes it was an outstretched hand promising adventure, but that hand mostly left him alone now.
“I didn’t punch him,” Sherlock clarified. “That was partner, Doctor Watson. And we’re here to talk to you about another matter though please, don’t run. He’s quite excellent with a gun and I assure you a bullet is far faster than you could ever be.”
Hiya. Sorry this has taken so long - but I have FINALLY finished university! It’s been three stressful years, but it’s done. So now I have no excuses for updating fics so slowly than my own laziness.
“Don’t look at me like that. It’s from before. I tried to send over the toys and clothes you left here too, but you didn’t want to talk to me.”
“Undercover operation in Russia which went wrong,” Mycroft told John as he poured himself a cup of tea from a China pot. “Extraction wasn’t an option. The British government interfering would have been enough to start another war. Sherlock…” Mycroft’s voice cracked a little from its normal concrete hardiness. “Sherlock spent four months being, er, questioned. He’s still got the scars.”
. He realised that his current case (a standard 6) had found its something when he rounded the corner of an alleyway in Aldgate and collided head first with seven rather large, (and Sherlock couldn’t pretend otherwise), scary looking men.
“Something to do with energy transference,” John said, “I studied it, briefly, at University but there’s not much research done on the subject and with well over half of the population not knowing anything about werewolves, there isn’t really room for much research.”
“Well that’s not very nice,” Mrs Hudson huffed. She stood at the bottom of the staircase, arms folded across her chest. “I was only trying to bring your food up to you.”
He didn't hear what was said, but a few moments later the woman was striding past, head held high and heels clicking as she walked. Sherlock watched her pass, keeping a look out for the boy until-
Sherlock had his head rested on John’s shoulder now, his eyes closed as he breathed heavily, his hand squeezing John’s tightly.
“John won’t spend nights here,” Sherlock told Mrs Hudson quickly, watching Rosie while she slept. “And John’s going to continue seeing this new therapist of his. Oh, and I’m going back to see Ella.”
“You want me to tell you how I know you were lying so that you don’t have to say what you were originally going to say. And I understand. It’s tricky. It’s difficult. Sometimes, and I believe I speak for both of us here, our feelings overtake our thoughts and sometimes, against all rationale, we find ourselves grappling with our imagination pertaining to the wondrous opportunities of what could be and the dire consequences of what is more likely to happen.
Today however, that idealistic schedule had changed entirely. That boy, whoever he was, had the most sincere desperation in his voice that Sherlock couldn't help but be intrigued, no matter how many past events warned him to avoid the kid as much as possible. Which is why he ran to the stairwell and straight back to Mrs Merriweather's office, the moment the whirring of the lift sounded.
But John could still see the fear. He could still sense it, even with Rosie held between them and her tiny grunts as she tried to grab onto John’s hand, John was fully aware of how tense Sherlock had become since their conversation started.
In response to her question, he grunted, shrugging his shoulders and folding his arms, sliding further down into the plastic chair.
His jeans too revealed slightly too much about him. They were well worn, and although dark several patches glistened in a dark bluish silver. But he certainly didn't look poor, his jumper definitely didn't look cheap at any rate. So he liked comfort, then. Why walk around in a pair of stiff, brand new designer jeans when there were plenty of more broken in jeans available at home?
“I didn’t know you smoked,” Nate said, sliding the cabinet behind the counter open and retrieving the cigarettes. “Very bad for your health, and the pictures are gross. Do you want the black lungs or the woman with no teeth?” Nate held up two packets for John to see.
“So, you two know each other then?” He asked haughtily, interrupting the conversation with his arms folded across his chest.
The pair stared at one another, and Sherlock noted how incredibly tired the boy looked. He was muscular, Sherlock could tell from the force of his hand's trying to push Sherlock's hand down and out of the way. Yet he was short, only coming up to Sherlock's chin as Sherlock glared down at him. Sherlock could feel the boy's lips beneath his hand, parted - he'd been about to shout when Sherlock grabbed him.
Sherlock moved easily, and from the position of his hand John could feel Sherlock’s heartbeat race a mile a minute.
“But if you want to get her home that’s okay,” he cut across his own thoughts. John needed to make up for lost time with his daughter, mourn the death of his wife in a healthy way, and not be in charge of babysitting a junkie detective he evidently didn’t like very much.
“Oh, one other thing,” he said, turning to Mike. As he spoke a smile broke out across his face. “John is my soulmate.”
“You know when you have a really good sneeze and it kinda feels like you’ve had an orgasm?” Harry asked when John had broached her on the subject after school one day. Harry had met her soulmate, Clara, when they both began working in a local computer shop.
Deciding that he'd heard enough, he scrambled up onto all fours and twisted himself round, leaning his back against the door and glaring at the abyss of a corridor that lay before him.
He bit his lip. It was a struggle to not drift into the realms of unconsciousness as the men who had been beating him up two seconds earlier scrambled around one another, yelling instructions and shouting words Sherlock couldn’t make out.
“Are we really going to keep doing this?” He asked. “Because I’m bored of it, John. I’m bored of you tiptoeing around me like I’m a bomb that’s about to go off.”
He was roughly the same height as Jim, but the two couldn't have been more different. While Jim's hair was the colour of the dark night sky, John's was the fading grey of the moon. Light, bright, with the same discoloured white. Yet there were still traits of blond leaking through.
John’s hand caught Sherlock’s elbow. He gripped it, hard. In this position John could easily manipulate Sherlock into an armlock and Sherlock felt his bones scrape as John tightened his grip. It hurt, a lot.
John shook his head quickly. “No, no. Sherlock, no.” He took the seat opposite Sherlock. “I read what you wrote. Pass the prawn crackers?”
“You were holding a prisoner,” Lestrade said. “You stood outside the cell, every day, for three months.”
There was that laugh again. Sherlock really needed to get that under control. The small chuckle he did when he was in disbelief; telling people he wasn't taking the situation seriously when in actual fact he was doing the opposite. Yet the ill humoured chuckle still rolled of his tongue as he stared past John and towards the sky where the grey clouds tumbled over one another, being pushed around by the wind. It was going to rain again soon.
Sherlock and Rosie’s relationship wasn’t awkward, and it wasn’t forced. Rosie doted on Sherlock and Sherlock had swept Rosie into his whirlwind of a life with surprising ease. John had been quite taken aback to find how much Sherlock cared for Rosie.
In any case, Sherlock had broken their dysfunctional relationship off when he returned to the UK, and it was around that time that he realised that he deserved more.
Sherlock’s hands were stuffed deep into his pockets and his cheeks burned pink from the December cold, reminding John that he was very much alive as a shiver ran through the detective, the wind picking up. Sherlock’s scarf was drawn a little tighter than usual, and John noticed that he’d chosen the thick woollen one which Rosie had gifted him for Christmas.
Sherlock frowned while he read. While John hadn’t said anything, Sherlock knew that Ella had suggested writing the blog at one of the lowest moments of John’s life. That he had chosen to take it up again, though privately rather than online, made Sherlock’s stomach knot.
“In the garden, love,” John called, walking around the perimeter of the cottage to greet his daughter and her husband.
Harry jumped a mile as John, now facing the brook, shouted and gestured wildly at something, something huge, hurtling towards them from behind.
“Well,” Nate tapped something into the till “let whoever you’re buying them for know that they’re no good. I ought not to sell them but I like making money.”
Images of Sherlock curled up in John’s bed drifted into his mind and he had to mentally shake himself. The thought of a lazy Sunday morning filled with cuddles, wrapped up in one another’s arms, warm, content, happy.
Harry leapt over a small brook and turned back to John, who was watching the brown water uneasily. For Harry with her longer, grown-up legs the width of the brook was barely a problem but for John, who was already deathly frightened of the dark forest and the thought of never seeing his beloved teddy again, the brook was a raging river with a roaring current which threatened to drag him under. He shook his head.
The virus had swept across the UK. The economy was a mess, but everyone was excited to get back to normality. Offices had begun to reopen, and the moronic panic-buying had almost completely fizzled out. John was exhausted. As soon as their self-isolation had ended he was back in the surgery, and Sherlock had even started volunteering in their postcode, taking food to people who couldn’t go out for themselves. He also began a YouTube channel, posting videos of various science experiments for children whose schools had been closed because the pandemic.
Sherlock slouched again, breathing hard. He reached for the glass and spilled most of it down his chin and t-shirt as tried to drink as quickly as possible.
"You're so beautiful," John sighed quietly, looking at her in complete awe as she tucked a lone strand of hair behind Sherlock's ear. "Did you know that?"
When Sherlock became ill, John found that he was house-bound for 14 days. However, his GP was one of the rare few in London which enabled Skype appointments. They had given him the option of continuing to work while in self-isolation, and he had leaped at the chance. He could look after Sherlock and work at the same time.
Of course, this wasn't in the least bit surprising for Sherlock. From the moment he'd been kicked out of the office he'd already had it set firmly in his mind that he wasn't going back. He had better things to do with his day. Admittedly, that had meant slipping down the alleyway between the Madiha restaurant and the Happy Valley take-away to give someone a right hook, win a few fights and then sit in a local coffee shop, possibly nursing a bleeding lip while checking his emails for a good case.
There came another huff, but the mattress sprung back as the heavy wolf jumped off the bed. Sherlock allowed the wolf a moment before he opened his eyes.
Coat pegs lined the walls; one peg for each person in the two classes. Sherlock scanned them where he sat, scowling as he flickered over each picture, name, and Ability.
Sherlock sat bolt upright. Every muscle in his body screamed in protest, but he didn’t care. He needed to find John.
However, his blackened bruises had largely faded and his eye was improving all the time, but his body still ached. He was tired a lot, and his teeth felt strangely gritty after the about of sugar John had offered him.
“You don't seem mad,” Sherlock began, recalling the different forms of madness he'd read about. Not that it was the right terminology, Sherlock knew; yet, the newcomer’s demeanour did nothing except draw Sherlock towards Alice in Wonderland, and in doing so the famed Cheshire Cat. Despite having only muttered nine words in total, Sherlock was forcibly reminded of the fickle feline. It made his stomach jolt.
Sometimes, Sherlock felt that things were finally beginning to work out for him. Sometimes, those moments were when he found a packet of biscuits in the cupboard, or sometimes they occurred when a particular juicy case squeezed it’s way into his letterbox.
“Hi, Dad.” Rosie grinned as she hugged John, and John was only too happy to have his hug impeded by a large, swollen bump.
“Identify yourself!” He shouted, clinging onto the headboard for dear life as whatever it was huffed once more. “I’m warning you! I have a very strong boyfriend and when he comes back you’ll regret ever coming into my flat!”
“Bumped into each other?” Sherlock repeated, gaping, though it wasn’t difficult to see that he was doing his best to contain a smile. John noticed with some warmth the way the corners of Sherlock’s eyes creased as the smile broke free and filled his face. “John walked over to me and started to bully me into going to the hospital.”
Yet despite the tranquility of the day, she still felt a bit odd. Her legs were never her strongest feature; the way her thighs shook when she walked caused her no end of humiliation; she’d always avoided showing off her strong, unwomanly calves. Then Sherlock had happened, and everything had changed.
Rosie was barely a year old when John had moved back into Baker Street. He’d taken his old room on the top floor, but there were two other rooms up there in which Sherlock had shoved everything he’d ever owned. A mass clean-up began, but with Mrs Hudson’s permission to decorate Sherlock and John had taken a week off and soon enough they had the created perfect space for Rosie to spend her fast-approaching toddler years.
Two men grabbed Sherlock by the arms and forced Sherlock back. Sherlock thrashed around, trying to free his arms as he kicked out wildly. Both men were far stronger than Sherlock could ever hope to be, and while Sherlock was an excellent fighter, he knew that in a situation where he was restricted he was essentially powerless.
“Oh why is heaven built so far, oh why is earth set so remote? I cannot reach the nearest star, that hangs afloat. I would not care to reach the moon,
"What, Sherlock?" John quizzed, turning around to face Sherlock with his fists clenched at his sides. Even at this distance Sherlock could see that the tips of his ears were burning red from the cold, or possibly the anger.
“Because she shot you and I forgave her. I stayed married to her. And then she took a bullet for her and I blamed you! I still blamed you! Even though it wasn’t your fault!”
“I said we’d tell you as soon as they arrived,” John chuckled as he poured them all a drink. “She’s out in the allotment with Paps at the moment. We’re having real issues keeping her away from the bees; she keeps trying to eat them.”
"I was looking for you." He said quietly. Sherlock frowned. Through all the shouting John had originally done, Sherlock would have thought there would be a bit more enthusiasm around finally meeting him, yet John continued to look at the floor instead of Sherlock, tapping his toes on the ground with his hands clasped behind his back.
“But you’ve spoken to Mycroft,” Sherlock stated, finally meeting John’s gaze. “You know what happened.”
For the most part, Sherlock was amazed at how quickly they fell back in step with one another. They were silent for a while, walking alongside one another as they cut through Marylebone High Street.
Sherlock turned around and walked back to his bedroom, the now assembled cot easily visible through the open door.
When John had originally bought the soft pink Polaroid camera, Sherlock had scoffed. According to her, John was simply trying to blend in. John decided not to point out that as an 18 year old girl, it was perfectly acceptable for her to follow the reprised teenage trends. The moment it had come in the post she'd immediately become latched onto it, which is how she came to be standing a short way down the stream from Sherlock, peering through the lens and smiling at a rather magnificent view.
Sherlock, after all, would form his own opinions. Neither of them would be able to deny that they were soulmates, but there was always a possibility Sherlock would turn his nose up at the concept. It had been known to happen to other people John knew, where one decided they weren’t in the right place to begin that stage of their life or they were simply scared.
“Yes,” Sherlock confirmed, a little confused. “I do have magnets. John, you know I have magnets. You used to rearrange them to spell out rude words.”
“He really did get ready in a hurry,” Sherlock thought to himself, watching John from the corner of his eye. “He’s even put mismatched socks on Rosie.”
“Fascinating,” he agreed, nodding slowly. “Serial killers always are. There is something about gore and distinctly inhuman things which generate a fascination. There are those who turn away from violence and death, disgusted by it, but they suppress their natural, human curiosity in doing so. They’re scared of what they are, or what they have the potential to become.”
“This is okay,” he said, “because I know that the moment I open my eyes you’ll be gone and this will all be a bad dream. Or, you’ll be real, and I’ll be hallucinating in some alley somewhere, where my corpse will be found by someone taking out the bins.”
“Well it's hardly my fault you're such a good looking chap,” Jim teased, and John’s smile widened, head bowed as he leaned on his partner’s shoulder.
"Sherlock," John warned, putting one foot in front of the other as he glowered. Sherlock could feel himself crumbling under the sincere hatred in John's gaze: those warm blue eyes he'd come to love becoming more difficult to read. When had he stopped being able to know what was on John's mind? When had that happened? His eyes were the same warm, Mediterranean Sea blue, yet the pattern of the tides were different. The currents had changed. What Sherlock once regarded as having the utmost beauty was now a complete mystery to him. Mesmerising, but with the distinct fear of wanderlust.
'Local Primary School Blaze' was the initial headline. That one wasn't so bad. Sherlock had only had a small mention, as more of the attention was directed towards the unknown events that had started the fire. However, someone then let slip that it was him who had caused the flames, and Sherlock's world fell on it's head.
The cottage itself comprised of a cosy kitchen, a lounge, two bathrooms (one en-suite), a dining room, a second lounge, and four bedrooms.
The wolf jumped back onto the bed and deposited it on Sherlock’s lap, using his snout to nudge it closer to him. Sherlock picked it up.
Sherlock frowned, his heart hammering as he investigated the strange creature. His hand stopped as it reached a sharp incline, and Sherlock paused. He had an idea.
"Meaning I'm dangerous." He finished quickly, desperate to change the subject. "Can I go now?" He asked hurriedly, jabbing his thumb over his shoulder towards the door.  His meetings with Mrs Merriweather took place on the first Tuesday of every month, and they were always the worst Tuesday's in existence. Therefore he always attempted to make them as short as possible.
“Bridget Jones’s Diary?” John laughed. He took Rosie back off Mrs Hudson and sat down on the sofa at the far end of the room. He balanced Rosie on his knee, bouncing her gently. “Did you enjoy it?”
“There’s just so much pressure. It’s alright for you, you know what you want to do. I have no idea; I have never been this uncertain about anything in my entire life.”
“Both,” Sherlock replied slowly. “John, I can’t help but think we might kill one another if we tried to stretch our friendship into…” his throat felt strangely restricted “into romance.”
15.	“I love the way we worked so hard. Yeah, we've come so far, baby, look at me, you're my superstar. When I'm afraid, when the world's gone dark, come and save my day, you're my superstar.” Superstar, MARINA
Sherlock crossed over to him, but as soon as he bent to sit down the front doorbell rang out through the flat.
“So this is why you’re so angry with me lately?” Sherlock asked, feeling the relief flood through him. A small robin hopped out onto the path not far away, and began chirping away merrily. It was soon joined by another, harmonising the song they were singing. John nodded.
He hoped Sherlock had remembered that John cared for him while he was prisoner, then tried to remember the last time he’d told Sherlock that. If he’d ever told him that.
The man couldn’t close the door without slamming it, particularly when he was in a mood. And despite not hearing the conversation that had warranted the slamming of her front door, she resigned herself to an inevitably foul-tempered Sherlock filled evening.
“That you don't know what goes on in my head,” Sherlock replied shortly. “That you have no idea what I think, or who I think it about. I know where you go, John. When you vanish without a word. And I don't mind. Why should I? I mean, it's not like we’re together, or anything. You can date whoever you'd like. Why should I care?”
Now it had vanished. It had faded out of existence like mist across a pond; one moment it was there, so prominent and so undulating, and the next moment it was like it had never there at all.
"Since then, the mutations have been able to flourish, and there's more cause for concern when a child is born with no Abilities."
"I'm sure you'll manage without it," the man on the right said, offering Sherlock a friendlily false disposition, which Sherlock immediately noted. He was a large man, with dirty nail brushes for eyebrows and a matted knot of grey Velcro for a beard, which ran up the sides of his face before retreating into a band around the back of his head; although missing the top entirely where a few short wires stuck sharply upright from where the man had missed them while shaving. As he spoke, he shifted his stance, readjusting his grip on the gun in his hand. Sherlock surveyed him closely, paying particular attention to the man's own badge, which read 'Bear 2'. Upon a quick once over of the man standing next to him, Sherlock decided what he was going to do.
Sherlock nodded. “I’ll pay,” he said, but made no attempt to move out of bed. “My wallet is in my dressing gown.”
“See? Now pull yourself together. Someone will be here in an hour to pick you up, and that book had better be a bloody good one.” He turned around, leaving John still standing transfixed in the same spot. A few rows away, Sherlock exhaled loudly.
“Well, urm, it’s Baker Street,” he said, opening the taxi door. “221B Baker Street. I think you’ll like it there.”
Everyone had an Ability. Everyone it seemed, except him. Isabelle, of course, could turn invisible. She took great pleasure in stalking him without him knowing, and then quickly running up behind him and yanking his hair. Sherlock would yell, kick, and punch the air behind him but with no prevail. Mrs Merriweather never believed his accusations of it being Isabelle, because no one had ever seen her do it. It was infuriating.
He’d always liked John’s room, though he rarely had cause to venture there. It was quiet, and while John’s bedroom window faced the same direction as Sherlock’s beneath it, he had a better vantage point of the trees behind the slightly smaller flats which sat behind their’s. While Sherlock could look out of his window and see into other people’s homes, John could look out and see the sky.
“Oh, we’re completely ridiculous,” Sherlock hummed. “But I’m fine with that, and I know you are too.”
His mother rushed over then, pushing him into sitting and rubbing his back. Next to him, his father rolled over, blinking, coughing, and propping himself onto his elbow. While both his parents fussed over him however, rubbing the soot off of his face and out of his hair, Mrs Merriweather still managed to keep up her fierceness.
Hello. This fic is now three chapters instead of two because chapter 2 was becoming a smidge too long. Chapter three will be up on Thursday :)
Please do your best to stay safe! If you’ve been told to social distance, social distance! Don’t shout at retail workers!
Since then, she'd managed to worm her way into an office in the Harth Parliament (the main organisation that dealt with all the political aspect of people's Abilities), and there she had stayed for an annoyingly long amount of time. The Holmes family had had to up sticks and move to London, but that really wasn't a hardship on Sherlock's part.
The punches rained down on Sherlock and Sherlock was powerless to stop them. Pain erupted in his stomach, his chest, his head, his gut. He knew he was bleeding, but he wasn’t sure where from, and he could feel the tendrils of unconsciousness beginning to pull him asunder.
John genuinely thought he might burst. The few weeks since he and Sherlock had gone to the zoo were some of the happiest of his life.
The first page was easier to scrunch up. John threw it and it landed with some success behind the photographs.
“And it’s not like I can continue living at home,” Sherlock went on, turning towards the steps leading down to John’s accommodation block. John followed him. “And even if I do manage to find somewhere even remotely affordable to live in central London, I’d still have to have a flat-share. Or several flat-mates.” Sherlock shivered. “I could find somewhere outside of London, I suppose.” His nose crinkled in disgust. “Birmingham.”
“You’re getting so big!” John said, pulling away to examine the bump properly. Rosie held out her arms, her Transport for London ‘Baby on Board’ badge glinting in the sunlight. John sighed happily. “I remember when your mother…” he drifted slightly before recollecting himself. “Did you try that foot cream?”
Still slightly confused, Sherlock turned around again to check that the corridor was clear. However, when he went back to face John again, he was greeted by John's fist colliding squarely with his cheek.
John ran a hand through his hair, tilting his head towards the sky for a breath of fresh air as a weight pressed down on his shoulders. He felt like his heart was trying to claw its way out of his throat. His chest hurt. Colours were exploding across his vision like paint thrown at a white wall.
“I have. I’m the most selfish. When you jumped off St Bart’s Hospital I was a mess. I mourned my best friend. I didn’t know what I was going to do with myself. I was so lost and so numb and so angry that I didn’t follow you. That I couldn’t follow you. That I wasn’t strong enough to jump off that building immediately after you.”
"No one else has come out of the building harmed in any way. If we come out late, they'll know somethings up. Fire doesn't hurt me: I can't burn, but you can. So if I start a fire here, there'll definitely have been a fire in the building and they can't blame me. It'll take them a while to work out which fire alarm was set off, but I doubt they'll bother checking. So," he turned around, crouching down next to the heap of paper and gently nudged it. A few moments later, smoke was billowing and a fire crackling. "Technically it shouldn't be that ferocious, but I've managed to help it a bit," Sherlock told him. "Come here."
“If I ever make it through this pandemic I’ll die at the hands of Mrs Hudson anyway,” he thought to himself, then took off back up the stairs with his and John’s takeaway.
“Mrs Hudson!” Sherlock shouted. His voice cracked and he felt a tickle creeping into his throat again. “Go away!”
Lestrade had been vague on the phone and all he and Sherlock had talked about in the cab was how to trick Rosie into eating more vegetables.
Again, John squinted, but there really wasn't anything of significance. Shingle, a bit of green slimy stuff and a few rounded pebbles. The angular one was still lying there, but John really couldn't see the significance. She sighed and bent down, trying to get a better look.
It was a simple statement, and there were plenty of cases to back it up. Such as the time he'd gotten annoyed and set Mycroft's hair on fire, or (more recently), when he'd accidentally let his emotions get out of hand while chasing someone who he knew had done something unforgivable.
Sherlock nodded in agreement, and the pair of them hurried down a flight of stairs towards one of the buildings many fire escapes.
"The select few's 'magical' Abilities were mainly owing to the fact that mutations within the cells began to occur within certain genes, causing more supernatural elements to become a natural human trait. Supernatural elements that have since been proved by science. In some cases, anyway.
“Urm,” Sergeant Rose scratched his head. “I was on holiday in Krakow, with the lads.” He grinned guiltily. “I think. Don’t remember much of the holiday.” He shot a wink at John, which was greeted by John’s stony, unimpressed face. John had definitely had some good times in Poland, but this wasn’t the time or the place to discuss such things.
“You know you’re not a burden, right? I mean, I’m not spending time with you because we’re worried about your drug habit. Well, that is part of it but I think…” he faltered, looking away, catching himself before he voiced the unthinkable. “Doesn’t matter.”
However, it wasn't Mrs Merriweather who'd died, and the agreement had been made when the woman had announced to the world that she'd discovered a Harth Heir.
The fight had been heating up, with lots of half formed insults pouring from the criminals mouth as Sherlock planted a firm right hook on his cheek. The man scarpered, and Sherlock somehow found himself chasing the bloodied up man himself. He still maintained that he'd have been able to catch him if he hadn't caught sight of a gas canister instead. Although secretly, he was pretty damn pleased with the resulting explosion. The man had died in hospital a few hours later from severe first degree burns, and Sherlock had been banned from anymore of his "silly adventures."
Each sentence was a gift to him, each character was a new best friend, and each ending was a new beginning.
“Mycroft knew?! How many of you are there? You and Mycroft had a bet? At my expense! How did I miss this? This is unacceptable.”
"Just shut your eyes and pretend you're asleep. I'll say you were knocked out by the fumes," Sherlock responded, and John sighed heavily before tilting his head back and shutting his eyes. As Sherlock ran, he couldn't help but shake his head and smile. Who the hell was this kid?
“You… know?” John asked. His mouth felt dry, like his tongue and throat had suddenly become sandpaper and someone had just given him a teaspoon of ground cinnamon to swallow.
“Moving?” John asked, side-stepping past a large cardboard box blocking the doorway into Sherlock’s bedroom.
"I know that you're Sherlock Holmes, that your Ability is Fire, and that you're really good at punching," at that, Sherlock smiled apologetically, but John shook his head and brushed away any sympathies that Sherlock may offer him, not that there were any. "I also know that you're one of the best detectives London has to offer, which why I came to find you."
His curiosity captured, Sherlock reached over and picked it up, letting the pen roll off and fall to the floor.
Mrs Hudson decided that John was a very petty man who definitely didn’t deserve Sherlock, and next time she saw him she would tell him exactly what she thought.
He leaned backwards, the top of his temple brushing against the underside of particularly high shelf. Maybe Jim was always a bit rude; he was a ‘boss’, after all. Did anyone really like their boss?
Sherlock’s flat was small tightly packed. He shared the space with five other blokes. One was a university student, two worked on Fleet Street, and another was interning at the British Museum. The fifth was a sex worker but Sherlock wasn’t supposed to know that, so he saw no need in relaying the information onto John. After all, he’d only picked up on it by identifying the consistently changing cologne lingering around them. Detective though he was, Sherlock didn’t consider himself a snitch.
“And I’m a Doctor,” John added. “I know how to look after him and I know what to do if it gets worse. Now please, stay away. I’ll get him to phone you later this evening.”
"It's a long story..." He offered, shrugging. But Sherlock remained solid, not backing away from finding out what exactly it was that John wanted from him.
John had heard the lullaby several more times after that, but it was only when he was eavesdropping, hanging behind the door.
20.	“I wanna be, wanna be where you are, I wanna feel, wanna feel twenty-one, going straight to my head like you used to. Wouldn't change anything that we've been through.” Straight to my Head, You Me At Six
And sometimes they disintegrated entirely, when he realised that despite everything, John still saw him as the sociopath he always pretended to be.
His mouth was dry. He felt like he was choking on sawdust, but the man with dark curly hair and piercing blue eyes held onto him tightly.
He sighed quietly as memories of what had happened drifted to the edges of his mind like a corpse in a lake, washed up amongst the reeds and almost invisible to everyone except unsuspecting dog walker, for who it was the most startling part of their day. Sherlock’s stomach churned.
“Pay attention when I talk to you!” Sherlock snapped, though he was smiling. “Everything I have to say is of the upmost importance.”
Sherlock handed them over wordlessly and watched as John tore the bag open and dipped one straight into the curry sauce.
“I’m not even sure you are a wolf,” he said, scratching the wolf’s ear again. “Maybe you’re just a big dog.”
Annoyance at John was the first thing to hit her. She had always liked the doctor and been very tolerant of him, even after he abandoned her when Sherlock ‘died’, and after he had stomped over Sherlock’s naïve and damaged heart. Again. And again. And where was he now? Always jealous of any attention Sherlock received, Mrs Hudson watched as the man always pointed the finger at Sherlock and rarely took the blame for his own actions.
“Yes… I was,” he said, putting his hand against Sherlock’s forehead to check his temperature. “Are you feeling okay? Did you hit your head?”
If you want more, I wrote a small fic a few years ago that involves Sherlock and John hiding on their wedding day. It wasn’t written with the intention of coming after this fic, but I think it works quite nicely. I’ve also written another fic (a while ago), that centres around Sherlock and John’s retirement. I’ll try to add them to this fic as a series.
“You needed the adrenaline. You needed something to take your mind off everything that was going on inside your head. You needed to be cured of the boredom rattling around your brain. You’ve never wanted to help me. Never,” his voice shook with the last word, confidence breaking down to be replaced with the self-doubt spilling through, like a dam that had remained standing for such a long time finally giving way.
They reached the main entrance to John’s halls and Sherlock pulled the door open. He held it for John, and John mumbled a quick thanks as he went through. John and Sherlock didn't live in the same halls; Sherlock resided in the larger, more modern accommodation on the other side of the campus. They rarely went there, though. John doubted Sherlock knew his room number.
“Mary shot you and I stayed with her. You said it was surgery but I read the files, Sherlock. You died on the operating table. She meant to kill you!”
With a painful twang of guilt he remembered splitting his knuckles on Sherlock’s cheek, pushing him against the wall. Throwing him down. Kicking him, over and over.
Through a crack in the door he watched as the men pondered the situation, running through it in hurried whispers. In an attempt to stop himself from laughing, Sherlock began chewing his thumb knuckle. As he watched however, it quickly turned into a gnaw as he watched on anxiously. They weren't going to move. So perhaps they weren't so easily fooled.
But the thought of two further generations named after Mary made John’s heart ache. Not for the loss of his long deceased wife, but for the realisation that the assassin still had a hold over the family she had once sought to destroy.
John chuckled and nodded. “Oh yeah. Why do you think Mrs Hudson has so much ketchup in the fridge?” He asked, standing up again and patting Sherlock’s shoulder. “If you were to taste some, I think you’d find that it’s a bit more, er, metallic than ketchup ought to be. Drink your hot chocolate and I’ll take you to hospital.”
Sherlock had enjoyed reading Bridget Jones’s Diary. He thought that the characters were somehow far-fetched and boring at the same time, but he had always enjoyed the film and therefore decided that he also enjoyed the book.
“John, all you’re doing is looking for a reason to be angry at me and believe me, if it was my intention to piss you off you would have already left. Sorry Rosie.” He looked down at the baby, who was looking out of the window with benign interest.
Slowly, he began searching for the mystery man who had been too rude to offer so much as a 'sorry' or a 'thank you'.
Sherlock watched him, too exhausted to do much else except listen and sit in a quiet strop that Harry had taken up so much of John’s precious time. These were unprecedented times. The NHS was quickly becoming overrun and John spent all of his time either at the GP or volunteering at the hospital.
“That means shit, Sherlock,” John chuckled, ignoring the broken lift and shoulder barging the doorway to the staircase open. A cold draft greeted him, tumbling down the ten flights of stairs.
Mrs Merriweather placed the workbook on the table, with the almost ineligible handwriting facing the two confused parents sitting opposite.
