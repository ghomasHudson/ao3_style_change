“Dean…”
“We would love that,” she added as she looked over at Jo, who nodded in agreement.
Castiel smiled. “Yes it is. I um, I need to ask you something, and please don’t deflect” he asked her seriously and watched as her carefree expression changed to confusion and concern.
Before anyone could reply, the water’s currents alerted them to an unannounced presence as a senior Cecaelia Omega drifted towards the center of the council's room. Her name was Lorraine. She, too, was a victim of Merfolk Zachariah.
“Dean… Dean.” He couldn’t stop the ecstasy that overpowered him as Dean latched onto his neck and started to lick and suck in a bruising mark right under his ear that made his knees weak. They were so wet and slick and Dean tightened his fist as he stroked them faster. Castiel was helpless as his climax crashed over him. Thunder roared outside as rain never ceased in its descent. The winds slammed against the windows but all Castiel could do was shiver as he spilled all over Dean’s hand who joined him a moment later.
“Please...please have mercy,” Naomi started to cry, as Dean circled her.
thought he had before. Meg swallowed her own fear of the Cecaelia and moved forward carefully.
The elder brother groaned. It wasn’t the food. Dean actually quite enjoyed the dish the humans called ‘bacon cheeseburger’ even though it made Sam hurl and stick to fish and shrimp dishes. No,Dean knew this feeling, this need that started to get to him, only this time it was much stronger. Mating season was to start in another moon cycle, but his body, the Alpha in him, was calling out to his mate. He had done the same in the past mating season, only this time…
“Sam, I think you should have Jody or Alex check him over instead,” Dean insisted as he subtly moved Sam a step back with a hand on his shoulder. Sam looked at him, confused at first, until he took in Dean’s stance and Castiel’s body language. The Omega was scared.
going in the right direction. Cas was this way. He was close enough for their bond to vibrate. Even though it was faint, he felt the tendrils of his lover, a silent song caught in the winds of the sea. It lured him.
Dean pushed Castiel towards the building as Benny followed. They were greeted by Jody and Sam as they entered.
“You must be the homewrecker,” She found herself growling out as she stayed across the room, almost crowding the far corner as if to help her from physically lashing out. She hated this, hated that after four years, she still felt desperate for Dean and so hateful towards the younger Omega.
“Oh! Um, well, I completely approve.” Castiel giggled and smiled at him as another blush caressed his cheeks. “I am the Head Omega of the Blue Moon pack.”
The statement made Castiel’s eyes narrow, as if he were studying him. “May I ask-and please forgive me if I am overstepping my bounds-yet you stated before that you are a weapon,” he started.
Pam patted his arm once again and turned to wake Castiel.
“Charlie?”
“Joanna, this is Jack, Dean and I’s seven-month-old son” Castiel introduced them as Jack turned his head to look at Jo. He was a perfect mix of Dean and Castiel. The Alpha’s light hair, freckles, and lips with hazel green eyes while the shape of the eyes and nose were most definitely from his Omega mama.
“Jimmy?” He quickly turned to look at Meg, who was looking at him with concern. “You’re crying.”
Pulling himself from his thoughts, Castiel watched Dean, his muscular chest covered in ancient warrior markings, smiling bright as his sharp canines gleamed in the light of the moon and torches. He looked larger than life. He looked like the leader of a massive army, powerful. His broad shoulders and toned biceps made a shiver roll down Castiel's spine, and the Omega blushed as he looked away. He chastised himself for his inappropriate thoughts and reminded himself of his place.
As he watched his pack members take the wounded out, including humans - at least the ones that weren’t attempting to shoot them - he couldn’t help but wonder what the hell had lured Jeepers Creepers to this bunker. It had caught someone’s scent it clearly wanted. Dean was pretty sure it wouldn’t stop hunting for what it wanted until it got it.
“Where is Jimmy,” Rufus asked again, as Sam came closer.
When Dean turned back to the bed to give Castiel a power bar, the Omega was sound asleep, wrapped up in the bed. He was stunning and beautiful… perfect, and Dean had never felt so content in his life. He made his way to the bed and caressed his lover’s cheek. This was a huge step for them and he was beyond words as his heart soared.
“We have to go into the ocean. Recharge the glamour spell,” Sam voiced, as Dean pressed his watch to stop the annoying sound.
The alarm on his ‘watch’ beeped. He still didn’t understand why it was even called a ‘watch’, but it was useful for this one thing at least.
“Please,” Crowley added as he motioned for her to stand next to Castiel, who was looking a bit scared.
Cain sighed. Despite the sweet name, Buttercup was a pretty aggressive horse. Which was why Castiel stayed away from the Haflinger, and whenever he was out, Hercules, Galaxy and Wizard tended to shelter Castiel with their bodies to keep the wrathful horse away from him. “He’s in his stall. He bit Doc Donatello during his check up.” The Alpha looked worried.
“No. Their name has been lost over the many tellings. It never seemed important before,” Charles replied truthfully.
The stories twisted from there. Some believed that Asa had kidnapped Anna, while others depicted a story of forbidden love where Asa and Anna had planned to run away, since neither kin had been welcoming to the interspecies union. War erupted, Anna had been killed in the midst of it all, and Asa had been accused of her murder. Before the Cecaelia could  intervene, the Merfolk had killed Asa in an ambush. The war was assured, yet Zachariah had never been found. The war ended when it became clear that it was senseless, as the Merfolk sent out young and inexperienced sentries that could barely hold their spears. Cecaelia were indeed monsters of the deep sea, but not heartless ones. The war had ended as abruptly as it had started.
“Do you mind? I don't know who the hell you are to Castiel but you need to leave.” Anna growled out yet Meg completely ignored her as she addressed Castiel once more.
The Head Alpha nodded. “Yeah, it’s why I’ll need your help. I wanna make sure he’s at least physically alright, and the pup too. He has a few bruises that I saw and his left arm is in a cast.”
“Thank you, Alfie,” Dean whispered between them. The young boy had never said a word. Dean had only learned his name from other Alphas around the wooden cells. Alfie was the one that tended to all the wounded. From his nose alone, Dean could tell the boy was solemn, yet he was clean and clearly well fed. He had no idea what else Alfie did, nor what his role was in the pack beyond cleaning wounds, but he never sported any marks or bruises and Dean had to hope the young boy was okay.
Such a blue… there was nothing on earth that could compare to the shades that danced in his eyes, like the sky meeting the ocean’s depths within a sapphire jewel. Intense, intelligent and they pulled you in to drown… especially when filled with lust.
As they stepped outside and into a vast courtyard, Dean’s eyes landed on the stunning tree at its center.
The Blood Waters were a chilled and eerie graveyard of multiple sunken human ships. The area was infested with great whites, tiger sharks, sea snakes and great barracuda. It was vast and hauntingly frightening with the remains of structures left all throughout, with fierce and dangerous creatures lurking about.
Dean swirled around in the cabin. The heaviness of the darkness of the night had somehow evaporated, and he wasn’t going to wait any longer. Dean shoved the book shelf to the side, closed his eyes, counted to three, and bolted out of the cabin door.
Castiel stayed in the kitchen as he tried to calm his racing heart. He couldn’t quite remember the last time he had been home when Dean hadn’t already been in bed behind the closed bedroom door and something in him hoped that wouldn’t happen tonight. He quickly shut off the lights in the house, made sure the door was locked and found himself all but running to the bedroom.
“Hn” She smirked and he hated when she gave him her ‘knowing’ gaze as she nodded in agreement if only for his sake. “Whatever you say Cas, but Alphas are prideful knotheads, all of them, even your husband and one way or another, that side always comes out.” She hummed as she sauntered out of the office leaving him feeling a bit rattled and annoyed.
Castiel looked up at his brother, whose eyes widened in shock as he looked at him. “Your eyes…”
Dean nodded his thanks as he kept his eyes on the picture. So much had changed in the span of a few days, and it was about to hit home when they arrived and he would have to explain to his Omega of five years the massive change. She wouldn’t be happy. He knew her well enough to know that Bela wasn’t going to simply shrug it off and be fine. However, he did hope that once the shock wore off, she would come around. Dean slipped the sonogram picture into his pocket and it suddenly felt like it was a symbol of the
“Mating season--” the Alpha started, only for his brother to interrupt.
“Great; look at this video. It’s from a security camera at a marine zoo. You see that one tank here?” Benny pointed to one of the two tanks that were across a pathway from each other as he angled his phone for Jimmy to watch.
“Where is this ‘house’?” Sam asked the female, as Dean stood and picked up Cas bridal style, who was still unconscious and moaning.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Hey look, it's ok Castiel. The adults only see Bobby and the kiddos all go to Garth. Besides, you working here is none of their business. I doubt Dean would be upset, I mean, didn’t you say that your leaving your old job was to help you move out of a toxic environment?”
“W-what?”
Dean leaned back into the seat and licked his dry lips as he looked at his brother with a seriousness that made Sam’s eyes go wide. “The Styne pack. Because Adam passed, leaving Castiel a widower…” Dean sighed deeply. “When I got there to get Adam’s body, the Elders of that pack were getting Castiel ready for that surgery.”
The lovers kissed desperately, as if they needed to convey how much each had missed the other. Dean cradled Castiel’s head and mapped out his mouth in a possessive and pleading kiss. Castiel moaned into him, and met all of his Alpha’s demands with his own as he buried his webbed fingers into Dean’s short hairs. Slowly, the kiss stopped as they leaned forehead to forehead and simply basked in the feeling of being in each other’s arms once again, both relieved and euphoric in their union.
“You volunteered to come with me, Sam! You wanted to fill your curiosity of the world of the land! I’m not stopping you from going home, at any time,” Dean called out over his shoulder as he continued forward. He scented the air, letting the mother sea guide him as the curling winds of the north brought a cooling breeze to caress his skin.
Lily barked as her tail wagged eagerly as she moved about the crib on her furry paws.
“Castiel!” Michael turned in time to catch him as he watched in horror as Dr. Hess still pointed her gun.
The Omega nodded and Jody took over pushing the chair and disappeared down the hallway, leaving Dean, Benny and Sam to look after them.
“A blanket fort, Dean?” He questioned softly, as moved to crawl into the fort.
“Yeah…” He was still trying to process what he had just remembered. He had never had such a vivid memory before. All of his previous flashbacks over the last five years had only been of snapping shark jaws and tentacles, but now…now he had remembered the sensations. He had remembered actually
He zipped up his orange parka as he looked over the ocean. The massive storm hurtling towards shore was still far out to sea. Sinister dark clouds gave sneak peeks of flashes of lightning and intensified the electricity in the cool air. He buried his toes into the damp, soft sand, eyes lost in wonder and fear. For the millionth time in the last five years, he tried to understand what it was about the ocean that haunted him. He couldn’t get close to the water. He refused to. Even with its clear blue shorelines, the sight of the grey whales dancing over the waves, and smaller marine life such as turtles, tiny squid and starfish that made it seem  so peaceful and welcoming, he just
Neither were able to fully think as their lips met again, desperation and need driving them. Dean lifted Castiel, who wrapped his legs around the Alpha’s waist. The kisses were frantic as hands groped.
“And use her to cause everyone attending to be putty in his hands,” Pam laughed. “Come on Cas, that pup is a damn charmer.”
Slowly, Cas had started to seem more relaxed and not as stiff in his posture and had started to really come into his own as a human. Both Dean and Sam had helped him become more secure with his body’s strengths and shortcomings as they sparred with him regularly to get him. Cas was impressive as always, a quick study and had learned to use more strategies during fights. Strength wasn’t everything and he had soon enough started to accompany the Winchesters on regular hunts.
he had seen.
His bond with Michael had been forged in the brotherhood of being two pieces of a working weapon…but with this extremely new and vibrant bond with the Healer, Dean found himself conflicted about leaving. Yet the urgency of it called to him. Until the war was over, Castiel and Winter Peak could very well become casualties, and Dean would give his life to keep that from happening. For the first time, he found himself
Dean watched numbly. His heart ached because the man he had considered his best friend for so long, had happily stated this was his new purpose. That he was looking forward to this new chapter in his life and felt this would be the most effective and valuable use of his endless knowledge and inept curiosity in learning.
Blue eyes wide with surprise glanced up at him. “Um, yes next week, the 18th.”
“I remember you carrying me…”
As Dean continued to read on, the handwriting itself had started to change. It was rushed and a bit erratic as the pages went on. Things around the farm had taken a seriously sinister turn.
Dean’s bond with Michael was strong, built on wrath, a thirst for bloodshed, and a hunger for praise and pride. With the fear they instilled in everyone around them, the respect they commanded came easily. Michael was viewed as the commander that wielded the most powerful weapon that ever existed, which was Dean. In return, Dean was praised and rewarded constantly for the destruction he left in his wake.
Dean snorted as he sat back on his haunches and waited. The only one that still stood with Michael was Cole Trenton.
Dean took a step back, a moment to breath and sigh as the cabin drowned out the monsoon going on outside. He wiped at his face and turned around to look at the small one room cabin, with what looked to be a small door that led to what he guessed was the bathroom. Despite the horrific outside conditions of the cabin, the inside looked pristine, only covered in dust and spiderwebs. It was incredibly odd, and Dean raised his brows as he turned around to take it all in.
They stayed silent for many moments as the candle on the far wall flickered, twisting the shadows on the walls along with their features.
“Crowley, too,” Dean quickly added, which made Castiel nod in confirmation.
“Thank you.”
Dean turned Zachariah’s tail into a scale sack that held nothing but powdered bones. And as the blood flowed all around the victims now, everyone in attendance went into high alert. The Cecaelia roared, and it was deafening and powerful in its rage. Within seconds, Dean and the other Cecaelia Warriors rushed Castiel and the others towards a side cove, and they covered the whole of them with sand, their tentacles going into overdrive. They were all completely hidden as a great school of barracuda torpedoed right towards Zachariah and Naomi. One opened its jaws and went straight for the Alpha Merman’s screaming face. Seconds later, three massive great whites started to circle the feasting barracuda, who had been gorging themselves on the seven prisoners. There were no longer any sounds in the water. There was only blood and chunks of flesh, scales and meat floating around, making the sharks close in until one decided it was hungry enough to snap its jaws onto Hester’s torso, and it tugged her from the pole to swim off with.
He nodded in understanding. He hadn’t felt attraction to anyone, and had thought he simply didn’t possess such feelings or reactions…until now. Perhaps this simply meant he was a loyal lover, and that his body and mind only craved whomever had enchanted his heart? He didn’t know.
“That’s not true!” Castiel yelled back. Dean was everything to him and their beautiful five year old daughter Ellie was the best and most important thing in his life.
Bela sat up and straightened her shoulders as she took a deep breath once more. She could do this, nothing had to change.
Bela hummed to herself as she took some final notes and started to collect her things. “Too bad for me Alpha Winchester isn’t into Alphas, he’s quite a catch.”
“Battery operated. I came prepared,” Dean teased as he winked at the pharmacist.
“Thank you for the blanket fort. ” Cas voiced softly, as Dean reached up to caress his face.
“He’s always good. He had his bottle” Claire said as she smiled at the little pup and placed his baby bag on the chair behind Castiel.
“Hey Cas, baby sleeping?” Dean asked, stacking the pastrami and tomatoes on his sandwich.
“We are here to collect the ones responsible for the murder of
They didn’t do this… They had never flirted… The heaviness of the intimacy between them… Perhaps this showed him his feelings weren’t one-sided and… Dean's stunt made warmth and butterflies dance wildly in his stomach. Castiel beamed in the darkness of the dimly lit kitchen and leaned back against the wall. Dean had shown him he was receptive to his feelings.
Surprised, Castiel looked up at her with worried eyes as she took his hand in hers. “Adam’s death wasn’t something anyone could see coming.” They sat in silence for a moment. The death of his late mate, mere days ago, felt like a harsh reminder that he was still functioning on autopilot, still felt a bit scared despite the recent change in circumstances. He knew no one, was moving across an ocean to a pack he knew nothing of, besides secondhand information from Adam boasting about his brothers and nothing else. “Dean and Bela have been an item for some time now. Many in the pack view her as the Head Omega.”
Castiel pulled back slightly to look at his mate, and shook his head. Dean’s own tortured gaze mirrored his own, and the merman kissed his Cecaelia’s cheeks softly. The Alpha retrieved his seaweed hackensack and brought it forth to offer it to Castiel. The Omega looked down at it and gasped as Dean’s tentacles carefully took out the three items it held. With trembling hands, Castiel took the two pieces of egg shells,sheer rust colors with a rough exterior, while the inside curve was smooth with multiple light bluish dots. Castiel let out a cry as he held the only two pieces of their offspring against his chest. Dean held Castiel tightly against him as the Omega cried and mourned the little ones taken from them before they even had a chance.
Dean smirked and stood to put his bowl in the sink. He could feel through their bond how happy and relaxed Castiel was, and it soothed his wolf like nothing else. He loved the feeling, loved being right here, at ass o’clock in the morning, just sitting in the kitchen with Cas. The Omegas scent wrapped around Dean and made him want to just grab him and go snuggle. He turned to face Castiel, who was humming into his hot tea. “Isn’t your birthday coming up?”
Sam had no idea how to react, but he knew Dean wasn’t going to listen to him or Bela, and truly, the right thing to do was to go and collect Adam. Dean could send someone else to do that, but Sam knew all too well that Dean would never let that happen. Adam was their baby brother, was family, was pack, and Dean was a good Head Alpha and he would go because it was what was right.
“Smells great” Dean stated as he placed the large candy bag on the counter and took a seat next to Ellie. Cas quickly served everyone and as he settled down to eat, he took all it in, took in his beautiful pup’s every word as she told him about her and Dean’s adventures tonight while they had been trick or treating and all the costumes she had seen. His Alpha’s smile aimed at their daughter, the easiness between their bond, the way she looked up over at him, so eager to tell her mama all her thoughts and Castiel couldn’t stop smiling throughout their meal.
The nurse at the reception desk had informed her of Dean’s room number. As Jo hurried towards the room with her emotions wild, she noticed that she hadn’t spotted either Claire or Emma in the waiting room. They were most likely by their father’s side. She couldn’t help but wonder and feel a fierce need to know what the hell had happened for Dean to have a stroke. Granted, the man didn’t exactly have the best diet in the world, but a stroke?
“It's a whole moon cycle away.”
“Castiel is a widower now. I’m sorry about your brother. Adam was well liked among our pack members and was a clear asset to this hospital. He helped us like no one ever has. While we make due with our ‘old school’ ways as he would say, we truly benefited having him here. You have my sincere condolences, Alpha Winchester.” Dean nodded his thanks to Ishim as the older Alpha continued. “However, with Castiel pregnant and now left without an Alpha, it must be terminated,” Ishim said as Dean’s vision started to tunnel, focused solely on Castiel and yes, he could see the round stomach… the Omega was clearly a few months along, how could they possibly terminate… “Castiel is now considered, how should I say, undesirable and unwanted by any Alphas or Betas in the pack, so he will become a servant to one of the higher families.”
Lily took to being a big sister like a duck to water. The twins, Claire and Jack, were two rambunctious little shifters that made life a wild affair of running feet and giggles filling every corner of their home.
“Ah I hate to be a downer, chief, but we have business to attend to,” Benny sheepishly interrupted.
“Dean?” The Healer seemed worried, and looked over Dean’s form to try and understand his sudden discomfort. It was a confirmation for the Dragon once more.
“Hello Dean.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Bela could feel the truth in his words and she nodded in understanding, not trusting herself to speak. Too many emotions swirled inside of her and she hated this. She was better than this, nothing had ever rattled her like this and it was terrifying because she knew within the depths of her heart, as she silently watched Castiel clean his mess and waddle away to his bedroom, that this would be the greatest challenge of her life.
“Yes, hello!” Castiel shook the woman’s hand and smiled in return.
“So? What do you think?” Dean asked carefully as Castiel stood in the open doorway, his eyes fluttering as he covered his mouth.
Dean’s eyes widened as the shock hit him, and he couldn’t find the right words. This beautiful and gentle Omega was the Head Omega…and his true mate. He was in awe.
The Alpha followed Bela out of the bathroom to come face to face with Benny and Crowley. “What’s going on?”
Dean growled as his blood red eyes looked over the ones behind Michael. He could see their convictions starting to waiver as they looked at him, fear evident on their faces.
Castiel looked around the farm. “Where’s Buttercup?”
“Yeah Cas, thank you.”
“Look, I can’t help but feel like I’m overstepping, with Adam—"
Castiel pulled back after some time to look at his love and smiled through his pain. How could anyone deny how the Cecaelia Warrior felt about him, when he had searched endlessly for him? The Omega caressed his mate’s face tenderly and then nuzzled himself all over him.
“Daddy sleeping, shhh.” Castiel whispered to his son who was grinning wildly as he started to bounce on his tiny feet. The Omega was endlessly amused with just how excited their pup was whenever he was near Dean. It was too adorable for words.
“I’ll distract the girls while you talk to Dean,” he volunteered as he started towards the trio.
“I’m worried. I know he’s not telling me everything, and I respect that, but-”
Winter was coming. The cool air of the rainstorm that was rolling in made Dean wish he was anywhere else but here. He had become so accustomed to the random beatings and his back being a mixture of stinging and numbing pain, that he didn’t bother to move when he heard the wooden door being pushed open, followed by the silent small steps of the person coming to mend his marred back. The young male Omega knelt behind Dean and started to clean the wounds. Dean closed his eyes and clenched his jaw.
The Merman’s eyes went wide with shock. The monster he and the other offspring were forever warned about, and the reason his kind forbade his mating with Dean…was her son?
Dean had no idea what to say, or how to respond. He had always been a weapon, a ‘sword’ of his rider Michael, meant to stir fear in their enemies and bring them to ashes for standing against King Cain. Dean had always followed the orders and the teachings all taught mainly by Michael. Dean had always sought out the praises and rewards his obedience and cooperation had brought him.
Dean closed the door and made his way upstairs to shower. He had just slid on a clean pair of jeans and towel-dried his hair when he heard multiple voices downstairs. He quickly put on a shirt and headed down to find Castiel, who looked ready to go into labor at any moment, smiling at him while Pamela and Charlie argued over something Dean couldn’t quite make out.
“I know, I’m sorry. I know this won't be easy… I’m sure Castiel is pretty scared too, being a world away from what he has always known,” Sam added as he tried to keep Dean calm and watched him carefully as he added, “He’ll need you.”
“He will Cas, but you have to make serious changes. You have to prove to the both of them that you do love them and that they are a priority.”
“Okay, I’ll get Jody okay? You stay right here,” the redhead ordered and turned to make the call on her cell.
Castiel unrolled the tiny parchment and gasped. He grabbed hold of his garments and took off at a run toward the clearing, ignoring Crowley’s calls after him to know where the bloody hell he was going off to.
“You do realize once the dual starts, no one will be able to stop it until one of you has yielded or stopped breathing?” Rowena pitched in, a bit too amused for the current circumstances. Dean smirked. She may have been older and Sam’s mate, but she had a twisted darkness to her that his brother was able to somehow keep a lid on. Dean had always liked her.
He had started t collecting pillows and blankets, and had built some kind of nest on his bed. He kept masturbating in his bathtub, only to feel lonely and unsatisfied during and after. Jimmy had never felt aroused in the years before. The memory of his lover having him kept replaying in his mind, and even though he couldn’t remember their other times, he knew there had to have been many more.  The sensations and the feelings that soared inside of him at the thought of a mere kiss from Dean made him feel as if he was mourning something that was meant only for him.
“Brother,” she said. “I was exiled for  falling in love with a human. I had assumed ‘Castiel’ had done the same, being exiled. I knew almost right away he was like me,but the amnesia was, and is, something that was done to him, I truly believe that. It’s not a natural occurrence,” Meg supplied. Sam nodded. “I assumed he had been exiled for the same reason,” she added again, as Dean wrapped his arms around Castiel while he continued to whisper into his ear.
“Thanks Cas,” Dean basked in that happy gaze for a while longer before he stood. “I have a lot to do for all these hostings happening, so I’ll get going. I’ll be home later to play with Lily, call me if she shifts again, but her tiny body should be resting for a few days, it takes a lot out of us when we’re just pups.”
Once dinner was done, Ellie had already started to yawn and rub at her eyes. “Come on Pikachu, bath time and then bed” Dean announced as he took off his baseball cap and vest.
“But you are Omega…” He said in a whisper. He had never heard of an Omega being a bodyguard.
“Adam was my best friend. We met at the clinic where he was helping my pack. I was getting a check-up for a small cough. He um, he was the kindness Alpha I had ever met. He was caring and took his time explaining things to me… treated me like no one had before, like I was a person and not just another un-mated Omega… My home pack, the Stine Pack… well you’ve met Alpha Ishim…”
Alfie pointed in the direction, and then he was standing. Silently, the boy made his way to the wooden cell door and pushed it open. He stood there looking every which way before he looked back into the cell at Dean and tilted his head to follow. The Alpha frowned, but he was going to take his chances. Alfie had no reason to help him and for all he knew, there were guards right there just waiting for him to make a move. Carefully, Dean inched forward, his bare feet cold on the stone ground as he peeked outside of the door.
Castiel looked up at him. His eyes kept switching from cerulean blue to gold and back again as Dean reached for him.
at the claim. Everything in him knew he had done the right thing. He was honoring Adam by stepping in and making sure his widower and pup were safe and taken care of. The only complication was the claiming… And in truth it was already messing with the Alpha a bit.
“Yeah, mom wasn’t a shifter, so Dad used to shift with us and show us how to use our abilities.”
“Um, thanks, man. How much do I owe you?” Dean scrambled out of the car.
Rowena smiled. “A lady never tells all of her secrets. However, I did seize the opportunity, during her shocked and weakened state, to visit her, shall we say? I sensed her outrage, and then she left herself wide open for me to break her.”
Castiel frowned. Meg had never liked Dean, had never even referred to him by name and as her own personal rule, she wasn’t a fan of
“Bel...” Dean had no idea what to say. His heart broke at the sight of her so resigned to the truth, and he admitted that maybe he’d known the moment he sank his teeth into Castiel’s mating gland that things had changed beyond repair. But Dean was nothing if hard-headed, and he had convinced himself that his relationship with Bela would survive, when his wolf knew the moment he tasted Castiel’s blood that it was over.
“Let me ask you something as a doctor,” Dean started, which gained him an eye roll from his brother before he nodded. “If an Omega is five months pregnant… how likely are they to survive a surgery removing the pup?” Dean asked, his voice strained and deep.
“Y-yes. It's Halloween and I don’t want to miss Ellie in her costume” Castiel voiced as he smiled at the thought. If he was fast enough, perhaps he could go with Dean and Ellie trick or treating.
Jo reached out and took her forearm, where a jagged scar was hidden by her sweater, and brought her hand to her lips to kiss it as she looked at her troubled wife. “I’m sorry,” Jo whispered against her hand. Meg smiled and wrapped her around her lover. “He’s lucky to have you. You only had me,” Jo tried to tease, and Meg nuzzled her neck.
Meg was looking up at Dean with wide eyes, frozen in place until Ketch placed a hand on her shoulder and turned her, making sure not to look up at the furious Head Alpha on the porch. “Might I suggest you refrain from wandering away from your family? You are not on your pack’s territory, and guest or not, you might come out it missing a limb.” Ketch said, eerily calm.
“You… you would claim me as one of your Omegas?” Castiel asked in awe.
He wondered if he could convince Benny to make him a burrito and wondered if they had any more avocados. Just as he was about to reach the fence, Wizard raced forward and blocked him from where it led out to the forest.
was. It was almost like magic, fate or kismet, whatever the fuck you wanted to call it. His body, his heart hummed as time stood still. He watched him smile, have polite conversations, and bestowed those eternal cerulean blue eyes upon them.
“Brotha, listen to me. This is not ideal, but there is only one way to save that pup and Castiel,” Benny said as the burly man sighed and wiped at his face. “Bela will kill me for suggesting this, but we both know this is wrong and the only person that can help Castiel is you.”
“Cas, which ones am I missing,” Dean asked, as he kept his attention on the struggling five Merfolk.
Meg’s eyes stared at the Alpha. She was shocked, and felt incredibly exposed and vulnerable.
Benny and Pam made sure to keep her at bay and let their leader choose when to engage. The woman’s eyes glared for a mere moment and then awaited Dean’s response, seeming to know her place.
Dean sat up when he heard her turn off the shower. He growled in annoyance when he still couldn’t smell a damn thing and he felt a headache was coming on. He hated it beyond words.
“So… I mean… You had to claim him as your Omega for him to leave with you?” Sam asked and Dean nodded. “Did they hold a gathering of witnesses?”
Sam ‘paid’ for their food, and the brothers were back on the beach and continued northbound.
“But he did not,” Castiel supplied, now immersed in the conversation.
“I’m a bloody idiot! I never made the damn connection. Well to be fair all of the Winchesters come here and- damnit Cassie I’m sorry, I should have told you that the Winchesters came here.”
“She’s right Cassie. Dean is an Alpha who is quite sought after… not that he has actually shown any interest in anyone else at all of course, but at the very least, let him know you are trying to get him back. Being left in the dark isn’t a good idea for either of you” Balthazar added.
(See the end of the chapter for
“De-” He couldn’t form the words as Anna caressed his back and shoosed him as she whispered she knew. His sister knew how much he loved the Alpha and their daughter. A part of him wanted to scream and yell that he hadn’t seen this coming and that he didn't know why. But another part of him knew that was false, that he knew but he sure as hell didn’t agree with it.
He had stayed with Rufus after the doctor had checked him out. Physically,aside from the multiple livid scars that marred his torso, Jimmy was fine.Most were clearly bites, while others were slashes and tears as if someone, or some
The Elders, John, Henry, Bobby and Rowena were all in agreement. However Dean chose to proceed, they would support him. Karen had just settled herself upon her rock as Dean swam into the meeting cove, his Omega Castiel holding on to his left arm. The pretty Mermaid was flushed. It being Mating Season, the Elders had been quite surprised when Karen had come to fetch them for this impromptu meeting requested by the Alpha Warrior. None of them had imagined he would want to leave his cave with his mate anytime soon.They knew if Dean called this conference, it was of importance.
“Michael, are you sure you wish to pursue this challenge?” Cain asked once everyone quieted.
Day 43: Roaster is missing.
“Castiel has named seven Merfolk responsible for our eggs’ destruction. Zachariah, Hester, Naomi, Anael, Alistair, Gordon, and Ruby. Three are Elders, and Hester is their Sorceress,” Dean started.
The plane finally stopped rolling forward and Benny stood from his seat. The burly Alpha nodded at him before he tapped the dozing Crowley on the shoulder. Dean glanced out the windows and could see Sam and a few others awaiting them under vast black umbrellas. There was a black hearse parked and ready to transport Adam’s body.
They were safe, despite the challenge for the title of Head Alpha and the small faction that opposed Dean, and therefore Cas. Especially since he was the cause for the divide in the first place. A part of him believed he should be worried, yet he didn’t feel scared at all. Somehow, his bond with Dean made him feel incredibly secure in his and Lily’s safety… Absently Castiel touched Dean’s bite mark on his neck, tracing the scar of his Alpha’s sharp teeth. It sent a tantalizing chill through him.
“The Black Dragon is the only title I hold,” Dean replied.
Jo closed her eyes as she gathered her thoughts. Dean having a stroke was terrifying and painful. She wanted to run to the hospital, be by her Alpha’s side and make sure he was truly okay and very much alive…but Dean wasn't her Alpha anymore. He hadn't been so in the last three and a half years, and she was sure his new Omega, his much younger Omega, was there. Anger and hurt boiled in her stomach. She couldn't stop her devastating feelings of rejection and desertion even after all this time. She still loved Dean desperately, and before she knew it, she was already out of bed, dressed, and headed towards her front door.
Jo was already shaking her head no at the realization before her.
He had had a similar reaction for the first time about three years ago.  Meg had commented on it, and as he thought about it, and though it didn’t fully make sense to him,  he felt as if it were somehow connected to this most recent flashback.
The Merfolk were in full cry. Disbelief and outrage swirled in the waters as the community tried to understand that one of their own, one that had been elected to protect them, had caused a war that had resulted in too many of their brothers and sisters perishing over his wounded pride and bruised ego.
Cain watched on with a smirk and his hands on his hips as Wizard rubbed his nose against Castiel’s back shoulders and neighed at him. The Omega laughed and held out his favorite, a yellow apple. Galaxy carefully moved forward, mindful of Hercules’ bulk as he tenderly nibbled at Castiel’s shirt around his massive stomach. “Galaxy,” Castiel giggled, “that tickles.” Hercules had finished his banana and Castiel was able to give Galazy his carrots.
“Cas, Dean is the bees knees of Alphas. I can’t even begin to tell you how many Omegas, Betas and even Alphas would love to get some of that Winchester attention. Hell, I may prefer females but I have eyes, Dean is a sexy beast—”
“I think you and Castiel should be making more babies.” That… hadn’t been what he’d expected his friend to say. Dean stopped in his tracks and turned to look at his friend with a glare. Benny lifted his hands up in surrender to placate him and sighed. “Dean, all I’m saying is that if you want that chance with Castiel, at least give him a sign that you’re actually interested. I understand you wanting him to make the first move and yeah, it's the way to go, but at least show him you are receptive to it.”
“I’m Dean, and you are?”
Pam and Dean were the last ones to reach the wet asphalt as Castiel watched a large Alpha hug Dean tightly. “That’s Sam,” Pamela informed the Omega.
“That’s not… I was the one that wanted the pup. You don’t know anything about my marriage Meg.”
“Hey Cas, just in time!” Dean announced as the Omega waddled down the hall only to stop short in excitement.
Her soft baby smell soothed him, the jasmine and pine scent making his whole body hum with contentment. His wolf was beaming with pride at having this little perfect pup, howling in joy at how safe he felt here.
“Dean said something a few weeks ago at the meeting with the Lawyers…” The pain filled tone in her brother’s voice made Anna stop and listen. “He said he was never what I really wanted. How could he ever think that? I feel so lost and empty without him Anna. His scent is slowly fading from our bedroom and I can’t take it… it hurts so much. How could I have made him feel this way? I’m a horrible Omega! How can I ever make him see what he means to me? I fucked up so badly. I think he hates me, I,” Castiel’s words mumbled together as he started to hyperventilate and Anna grasped his hands and reminded him to breathe as his insides felt as if they were twisting and breaking into sharp piercing shards.
The thought of seeing his lover in nothing but swim shorts that clung to his perfect behind and thick thighs had Dean readjusting his jeans. He and Castiel Novak, a shy pharmacist with a dry sense of humor, had been together for the last three years and this was their first official vacation together.
The surroundings were filled with stone structures with beautifully carved cave entries. Every single carving was covered in multiple types of coral that gave the territories a bright, yet dangerous, outlook for any unassuming prey to wander through.They would never see a Cecaelia coming. It was unassuming, and gave a false sense of safety that the Cecaelia easily used to their advantage. Castiel was impressed.
Dean rubbed at his eyes, feeling the tired ache in his muscles as he glanced outside the oval window of the plane. A light rain sprinkled over Germantown, Ohio, and the grey mournful skies somehow felt right in that moment. Beyond the drama Dean was hoping to avoid, or at the very least minimize, this gloomy and solemn weather fit the mood of bringing Adam home.
“Cassie…” Balthazar came around the desk and hugged him tightly. Castiel hugged back just as tightly and tried his best not to cry. “Listen to me Cassie.” Balthazar started as he released him but something around his neck caught Castiel’s eye and reached up to clasp the necklace and what was at the end of it.
“Will she shift back?” Castiel was genuinely worried and curious, especially since he himself wasn’t able to shift.
“She had to settle a dispute between Virgil and Edger. Their neighborly spats are getting ridiculous,” Charlie informed him before leaving to take the clothes back to Castiel.
There was an array of light scents that reminded him there were quite a few others in the large estate, yet none seemed to be anywhere near his location as he scented the air around him. Castiel found himself staying in the many tall halls, yet peaked into every open room he came across, momentarily forgetting himself and giving into his exploring need. He found a sitting parlor, a music room, a grand library and a drawing room, a study, a gallery and his favorite of yet; a conservatory. He made a note to return to see the conservatory in the daylight.
Sam lifted a bag he had with him and started to open it, revealing what was inside. “This is a butterfly machine, a portable ultrasound. With your permission, I’d like to take a quick look.”
“I’ve called you, many times over the years, just to say hi, see how you are. You’ve never picked up, not once, and yet you’ve told the girls you never heard from me.”
“How about you keep those away from me, and we’re good,” Rufus gruffed out, which made Castiel laugh as Dean smiled and nodded.
Charlie, Pamela and Cain glanced towards them before they moved to help disperse the people still gathered on the lawn.
“You don’t have to follow through with this son, no one will think less of you,” Bobby added, not wanting a needless death to happen.
Jody gave him a warm smile and Castiel felt at ease as her fresh bread and cotton scent swept over him, and he couldn’t help but smile back. “I'd very much like to see my pup,” he found himself whispering as a fierce eagerness coursed through him.
“Well shifters are very rare. I’m still a bit shocked that Lily can.” He beamed, ridiculously honored to have given birth to a shifter.
Castiel sighed as he removed his cloak and dusted his skirts from the chilled snow. A slight knock startled him as he spun around to find an older female Beta with a tray of hot food, followed by two large Beta men that brought in a bathing tub. Castiel’s heart sang… if there was one thing about the privilege circles he truly appreciated, it was the warm baths. The two males didn’t pass him a glimpse as they set the bath close to the fireplace and Castiel could see the steam coming from it.
“Heya sweetheart,” Dean whispered as he gently picked her up. Lily gurgled and babbled at him, and her happy scent swirled around them. The tiny Winchester princess had quickly shown that she only liked two people. Of course she loved her Mama Cas, and Dean was the other one lucky to have the pup’s love. If anyone else tried to even hold her, she would have a complete meltdown. Both Jody and Sam had said that she was impressive for a baby only two weeks old. Her senses were awakening much quicker then other pups, and the two doctors theorized that was why she was extremely selective about who could hold her. Yet that theory made Dean wonder: Sam was a Winchester too, and had their distinctive pine scent, but Lily wouldn’t let him hold her. Oddly enough, Sam and Jody didn’t have anything to say to that.
“I don’t care,” Bela found herself growling out as the male Omega’s scent reached her. Every ounce of her hated that it was all over Dean, and she couldn’t stop the tears that threatened her eyes or the anger that simmered inside of her. She was better than this.
Months later and multiple hunts in the bag, Sam had started to get calls from other hunters for help or information. It had become abundantly clear that the hole Bobby Singer had left in the hunting community had been much greater than the brothers had realized. Bobby had been a center point for hunters in need of help. From lore to dispatching others for help to taking the roles of FBI, CIA and any other law enforcement superiors when the hunters were on cases, it had left too many in the wind from that true service and comradery Bobby had done and represented.
“I have. I can honestly say I have never been around anyone that practiced the faith of the Old Gods. I’ve only seen these in books in the Maesters Athenaeum that King Cain has.”
Charlie sighed and bit her bottom lip as she looked all around the nursery. “One of the Alphas in the pack decided to challenge him,” Charlie started. Her voice was low and Castiel could smell her unease.
Claire turned abruptly and her eyes went wide when she saw her mother. “Mom? What are you doing here?”
Everything looked outdated, only it was clear it had once been made with pride. As Dean walked around the room, spotting the simple mattress in the far corner by the still whole window, his boots clanked against the wooden planks, and the silence of the place felt incredibly unsettling.
“Jimmy!” Meg watched as some stranger barreled towards them, and just as the large man touched Jimmy, her best friend passed out. His body went limp, much too heavy for her to catch, but the stranger caught him easily and laid him down gently.
Bartholomew glided backwards to get away from him. Its right arm was mangled up from Dean’s claws, and it laid limp at its side. One of the MoL members was too damn close, and Dean didn’t have time to get the hunter out of the way when the monster grabbed him. Within seconds Bartholomew had yanked the poor human’s arm clean off and was…Dean was going to be sick. He watched in grossed out horror as Bartholomew’s jowls opened impossibly wide and it ingested the arm.
Helplessly and without wanting to crush his friend’s new found dream, Dean had watched him go with a forced smile and a ‘see ya later’ wave that hurt much more than Dean had ever been willing to admit.
“Cas…I’m right here. Open your eyes. Let me see those pretty blues looking at me...please, Cas.”
Dean warned the female to stay back, and turned his attention back to his beloved. Castiel twitched in his arms. His eyes were closed, his skin too pale and pasty, while his plush pink lips looked dry and trembled. The Alpha caressed his mate’s cheek gently as he tried cooing at him. “I’m here, Cas, I’m here…”
“I, um. Well, this wasn’t how I was hoping to introduce you two, but Sam, this is Cas, my pretty mate. Cas, this is my little brother,” Dean introduced, as Castiel’s cheeks pinked.
“Yeah? We can do that. How about I make you a bacon cheeseburger too?”
Now the cycle had come full circle, only this time with Dean and his chosen mate, Castiel.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Got it, what time are we leaving?” Pam asked.
“I volunteer to witness the death of the murderer who killed our sister from the south clan.” Everyone turned to see Gabriel, Castiel’s favorite brother, swim forward. Gabriel locked eyes with Charles, who nodded his approval, before he looked over to Castiel.
Castiel held onto the railing. The cool metal was freezing as the winds whistled loudly. His hair danced in shocking flows as he closed his eyes and let himself feel the storm's power against him. It all felt like caresses, just like when the man he loved, the humorous and thoughtful man he fell in love with was talking to him, touching him, sweetly, passionately, always with such care under his strong hands, his luscious lips…
Dean looked up with a frown on his face. “What?”
“So you and Crowley are...?” Dean pressed, a bit eager to understand.
In three days they would be off and Dean could imagine it already. He would spend the flight nice and medicated and would likely snore pillowed upon Castiel’s shoulder while the other man would read one of his favorite books. The brewmaster put the pamphlet down and turned to the laptop and out of sheer habit, checked the weather. It was going to be nice and sunny for all of Asheville, NC for the next seven days. As he clicked to check on the more outer rays of the weather towards Mexico, it looked just as great, except for a Tropical Storm dancing over towards Jamaica. Dean clicked on the weather report and looked at the dozens of projecting pathways outlined for the Tropical Storm that was predicted to turn into a Hurricane.
“Cas,” the Omega heard his Alpha’s soft voice, his strong scent of pine and bergamot was so close and Castiel couldn’t stop himself from inhaling deeply. He heard Dean huff a gentle laugh at his actions. “Cas, someone here would very much like to meet you,” the Alpha coaxed softly, and as the words reached his ears, the faint scent of jasmine caressed his senses, quickly followed by the undeniable scent of ‘baby’ and a grunt. Castiel’s eyes fluttered open.
Lily cuddled into his neck and sighed as she fell asleep. Dean licked his lips and looked at the two people he trusted most. “My ‘feelings’ aren’t important. I don't think it's right for me to expect anything from Cas… I don’t want him to feel like this is what he has to do because I'm his Alpha. I need this to be his choice, if I push or make a move… I just need it to come from him.” Dean explained. He wasn’t oblivious to how Castiel had started looking at him, or how his scent changed around him… But he wouldn’t make the mistake of hoping there was something there, not until the Omega himself made the first move to change their dynamic.
With every day the sun rose and set, he felt as if something was calling out to him, that something was simmering just beneath his skin. Every year around this time, both he and Meg would have feverish spells and wouldn’t be able to leave their beds. Rufus had explained it was just some kind of seasonal illness the two of them were susceptible to, but something told Jimmy it was much more than that. Right now, he was feeling the beginning tendrils of it, but they felt stronger than the ones before. There was an electricity in the air, and it felt as if the whale’s calls were making his body recall something his mind couldn’t. He trembled harshly against Meg.
He could hear his brother yelling and arguing through his pounding headache. He tried to sit up, only to find that his wrists were tied down.
“Benny—”
Dean watched his Omega’s reaction as his rose water and ivy scent whirled around him, filled with arousal, it embedded itself in the Alpha’s nose and senses. Within the next breath Castiel was in front of him and had pulled him in for a kiss. It was desperate and wanton and despite all of their struggles Dean had the same overwhelming need to be close to his husband. He loved the Omega and his scent was driving Dean wild as he dropped the towels, gaining a groan from his husband as he deepened the kiss and pushed him towards the bed.
“Bela—”
“Yeah he’s fine, but he thinks Buttercup has an ulcer, which might explain why he’s getting more aggressive.”
“Castiel.” Michael was beside him now, and he did his best to open his eyes, the brightness in the room painful to his eyes.
Dean came to stand next to him and leaned on his hands against the counter, looking at the beautiful Omega. “What do you want for your birthday?”
Benny was a burly Alpha, built like a damn tree trunk. He was fiercely loyal to Dean, who gave him a second chance ages ago when his life was thrown into turmoil, and was Dean’s second-in-command and highly respected among all pack members. While Sam had once upon a time occupied the title, Benny had taken over the role when Sam became the official pack doc. Dean regarded Benny as a brother and vice versa, and even though Sam didn’t always see eye to eye with Benny, he too trusted the Alpha. Neither had ever let the other down and because of their trust, Benny went wherever Dean did.
Castiel sighed as the tension he had been holding onto left him. He brushed some of Dean’s stray hairs from his forehead and the man grabbed his hand delicately and kissed his palm as his emerald eyes burned into his, showing him he was very much alright and Castiel couldn’t stop his smile as Dean gave him a beaming one.
Dean laid on his back as his body started to calm down from his high. It had been weeks since he and Bela had been intimate, and hell if it wasn’t over due. Not for lack of trying, but his Omega had a hard time with his scent now… He hadn’t realized just how much of Castiel’s scent mixed in with his own as a mated Alpha. Bela tried, he knew she tried. Dean changed his soap hoping it would mask it, started to wear scent blockers and had gone back to Missouri four times before they found the right recipe to be strong enough to dull Dean’s scent almost completely. It messed with his senses and his wolf whined in irritation, but it
However, Castiel would now be a permanent presence there, and soon there would be a pup… Despite the consequences of his actions that awaited him with his girlfriend, a smile tugged at his lips at the thought of a baby in the house. Little feet padding down the wooden hallways… the sounds of a pup’s laughter… There was nothing that made the Alpha’s heart swell with happiness more than children.
“I’m not with him! Yes he and the pup are claimed as mine but in name only—”
“And you have been struggling this whole time and said nothing? You haven’t even tried to spend time with Cas yourself.”
“I don’t know what you are going through because you won’t tell me, and it’s your right, but I’m here.” Meg hugged him as he nodded against her denim jacket. He had no idea how to explain any of the emotions he felt or any of the few clear images he saw, only that they all played into his past and were all important, yet he couldn’t reach them.
“I don’t understand…” Inias was now next to them, along with Kevin as they stood silently watching the events in a daze. “Why are the Werewolves helping us?”
“For now. Let's see how we can live with this... If
“The name of the Omega from the south clan was Anna. Anna fell in love with a Cecaelia Alpha Warrior, just as I have,” Castiel started, as he floated slightly closer. “His name was Asa. The Alpha Mermaid that Anna had been intended for was our very own Zachariah.” Suddenly the water was teeming with gasped and shocked murmurs of the Merfolk, all in an uproar. “Zachariah wouldn’t and couldn’t accept that his intended had broken their union to be with an Alpha she loved instead, an Alpha of a different species. Zachariah had them both murdered, blamed Anna’s death on Asa, and the war started.”
Hushed whispers spread among the people in attendance, and Dean raised his hand to gain silence. Those present from his own pack—Crowley, Benny and Sam—all shared a knowing look with Rowena and Missouri, and Dean refused to acknowledge its meaning. Bobby, Cain, Donatello and Rufus grumbled between themselves, confused as to what Rowena was insinuating. Dean rubbed his face tiredly.
“Thank you Alpha,” Castiel whispered as he teared up. He closed his eyes and reminded himself that today, he would say goodbye to Adam and embrace his new life as a Winchester.
Dean’s mind swirled with his insecurities and his self loathing lies as the creature continued to call out to him until it slammed itself against the door once more. The sound was mighty and broke Dean’s clouded despair once more. Dean growled out in frustration as he shook his head, wanting to stay clear minded as he yelled and roared “NO!!!” in reply to the creature.
Dean jolted as the truck driver slammed down the Impala's hood. “You’re all set, brotha!”
Sam was shocked and wasn’t even sure what to say.
Dean fished in his jean pocket for his cell phone, only to clench his jaw and resist the violent urge to throw the useless thing. There was no fucking cell service, and the last gas station he saw was over thirty minutes ago. Dean shoved open the car door and jumped out as he popped the hood to try and see what was going on with his baby. The rain had calmed down to a gentle drizzle, and he took out the small flashlight he had in the glove compartment to investigate the problem.
Castiel frowned. How could they see his pup? Then he remembered what Adam had told him about this machine… His late mate had tried getting one from a border pack while negotiating the temporary exchanges of equipment between remote and rural packs. Adam had been sad that during all of those months his Omega was with pup, they hadn’t been able to get this machine. Now this ultrasound machine was in front of him and Castiel wished Adam could be here for this moment.
“Hey, so get this,” Sam started as he walked into the war room and dropped at the table in front of Dean while he nursed a new beer. “You remember a while ago Garth mentioned that Cas wanted to reopen a bar, kinda like Roadhouse 2?”
“I’m so happy for you Balthazar, I-”
Jimmy closed his eyes and let that memory return. It had to be a memory,  there were too many sensations. The feel of those soft lips on his, the taste of salt and...mint? He wasn’t sure, but he did  relish the taste. Jimmy gave himself over to the memory. He was too exhausted to fight it and the overwhelming passion that made him tingle down to his toes as the memory coalesced.
his abdomen was, and a smile graced his face as he caressed his bump. He had caught again after only a few nights of mating. His joy bloomed and gained a curious frown from Gabriel. The brothers had barely had a moment to catch up, but both knew with Castiel’s return, that they would have plenty of time after Mating Season. The Omega shook his head for him not to worry as the sounds of crushing bones sounded from Zachariah.
Dean made a gesture, and seven of the Cecaelia Warriors each brought the prisoners forward and secured them to wooden poles that stood straight up out of the sand. There were quite a few of them, and most had clean bite indications all over them. Dean swam around each of them. He radiated rage, and Castiel wondered if it was why the other dangerous creatures that resided in the Blood Waters kept their distance. The Cecaelia’s tentacles could suddenly strike out at alarming speeds, and Castiel noticed Dean had stunned Anael, Gordon and Ruby with his poisonous suckers. The three of them screamed, the sounds echoing and luring other predators. The Omega watched as Dean did the same to Hester, Naomi and Alistair, and witnessed it as their scales started to darken, as if they were rotting.
Dean’s jaw flexed and Castiel couldn’t help but let his gaze wander to the Alpha’s. “Wait… your friendship was
Meg could feel it. Something was going to happen, something involving Jimmy. The air was filled with too many warnings in the last few weeks, since the day in Rufus’ clinic when Jimmy had that massive intrusion on his mind. He was constantly fighting between his mind and his heart. She couldn’t begin to comprehend such a constant desperate, desolate feeling. She looked at Jo, who was her beautiful, feisty and loving companion; her lover, her heart, and the one that regarded her with nothing but strength and devotion. She had been one hell of a lucky female. Yet how could she even explain to her about her troubles, when she herself wasn’t sure what to make of her
It had been a long few days since the challenge. Dean continued to feel uneasy, like he was waiting for something else to happen, and as much as he hated to admit to himself, the only time he felt remotely relaxed was when he was around Castiel. The Omega had asked him about the baby’s room and Dean dove headfirst into re-purposing the room across from Castiel’s. He had spent the last two weeks renovating, getting covered in paint and sawdust as he built the nursery. It was almost a mini vacation: he didn’t have to think, didn’t have to bother showing up at Michael’s burial. His challenge was viewed as traitorous, and so would be buried on the outskirts of the Winchester Pack lands. Dean didn’t have to deal with that, the Elders and Benny were more than capable. This left him to take care of something he felt was much more important, a safe and cozy room for the newest and first Winchester pup to grace Dean’s life.
“Talk to me. I know I can’t understand everything, but I’m here. Don’t shut me out, ever, about him. I want to help,” Jo pleaded, as her dark-haired wife nodded.
“What’s happening?” Kevin whispered, as he looked over the hillside of the bunker’s roof they all stood on and Castiel gasped. Werewolves. Werewolves were running into the bunker’s doors and they could all hear the roars, gunshots and screams happening within the chaos.
“Yeah… Look, I need you to understand that this was not something I did lightly, and none of it was about you—”
Castiel closed his mouth and kept his eyes down. Several tense seconds passed before he dared to speak once more. “I can’t imagine, and I won't pretend to understand, how Alpha claiming me feels for you. But I can promise you that I am only his in name… He only did so to save us, and I will do everything in my power to never cause him or you any problems. I am grateful beyond words to him and to you. You are the Head Omega of this pack, you are Alpha’s one. I am only a part of this pack, lucky to be able to raise my child here in the safety of the Winchester Pack. I will do anything to deflect any attention to me, I don’t want it. I just want to care for my pup, nothing else.”
The Omega’s eyes however quickly flicked over towards the man that walked in behind her. His soon to be ex-husband was dressed in dark jeans, a white shirt and a light grey plaid blazer with its sleeves rolled up. Dean was clean shaven and despite the dark circles under his eyes that matched Castiel’s own, he was handsome as ever.
“This is so disgusting and yet it’s delicious…” the Omega murmured to himself as he sighed in contentment at the first bite of his chocolate pudding dipped pickle. Castiel settled himself on one of the stools and indulged in his odd craving.
The Elders started to clear out as their guests were leaving, which left Dean to walk home with Benny and Sam in tow, while Crowley and Ketch took care of any final details.
“Well, yes actually. I’d very much like to explore if that’s alright.”
“It was the only way to save them. They were going to terminate the pup that’s our blood, and if Castiel survived the surgery, they were going to enslave him to some entitled family. I couldn’t let that happen.” Sam slumped back into the leather of the car seat, completely deflated and floored by the information.
Meg had tagged along as Jimmy went to a small boutique just off the small town harbor. The woman that tended it made beautiful quilts, and he had felt the
“Mercy? Is that what you did for our eggs? Mercy,” Dean growled out, outraged at her hypocrisy. “Don’t worry, I’ll make sure you and Zachariah see your attackers coming.” His words caused her eyes to go wide as she trembled in the restraints, and she looked over at Zachariah who was just a few feet away from her. Then Dean’s tentacles came up and secured another seaweed around her neck and the wooden pole to keep her head from slouching down. Then one tentacle wrapped around Naomi's tail and started to squeeze, making her scream. She was immobile as he turned her tail into a crushed heap. She continued to scream and cry at the pain as Dean drifted over to Zachariah.
There wasn’t a single soul.
Yet as he stood in the shade of the apple blossom trees, he watched the bustling and lively farmers market. His eyes skimmed over.... and there
“Poor Garth worked his ass off all night to make sure the second was ready,” Pamela added as Dean looked at the collars with wide eyes. Garth Fitzgerald IV was the town’s best seamstress and tailor. He was an odd yet incredibly kind Beta.
Castiel looked up at him, and a flash of pain slid over his face before he smiled again. “Yes. Adam used to love calla lilies. So I thought I would name her Lily.”
He’d dreamt about Dean… Castiel flushed bright red in embarrassment and looked around his bedroom as if someone might have witnessed his improper dream…  His nose wrinkled and he groaned in annoyance, the scent of his arousal and the uncomfortable wetness between his cheeks evidence of his naughty imagination.
Dean sighed and rubbed his hand over his face. “Right, I forgot. Okay princess, I’ll come see you in a little while,” he told the pup as he gently handed her over to her mama. “Sorry Cas, I'll make it up to you both, I promise.”
“Yeah of course. Castiel, I’m sure you would be much more at ease with an Omega doctor as your physician. I’ll see which of the two is on call.” Sam smoothly excused himself and rushed ahead of them as Pamela turned Castiel’s wheelchair towards the door.
Castiel looked back down at his ravenous little one and nuzzled her, her jasmine and pine scent making his heart swell. “How long was I out?”
“Careful baby, daddy is hurt,” Castiel told their pup who was much too young to understand. Dean snorted as he placed his son on his lap as the pup smiled up at him and babbled on while he grasped at the Alpha’s hospital gown.
“Oh?” Ishim radiated annoyance at being so casually addressed.
“Your union with Dean is a precious thing. I’m sorry for what happened to your eggs. I was in the meeting circle when Dean told the Elders, and said how he needed to find you,” she started, and took a deep humming breath as her trembling hands clasped in Castiel’s squeezed his slightly. “Dean is Alpha. He is one of this clan’s most prized and loved Savage Warriors. If you truly love him, you must respect the monstrous and furious side you have yet to witness, because you will, child. You will see it and feel it when he takes his revenge against Zachariah and the others that have hurt you and your offspring. Embrace his protective and vicious instincts.” Castiel nodded at her. Both Omegas had tears slowly falling down their cheeks. “I don’t know the details of what happened to you, or who did it, but I know it in every ancient part of this old body that Zachariah is behind it. I very much look forward to Dean destroying him. I’d like his severed head at the end of Dean’s halbert before I take my last breath. I deserve my revenge,and Dean will avenge your little ones that never got their chance. This is our way, Castiel.”
“Very much so,” came the sleep-husky voice of his Alpha, and Castiel glanced up quickly to see him slip in from the stairs and go directly for bacon.
