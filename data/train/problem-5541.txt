No, he can’t.
“I wouldn’t say—”
“You’re going to give in eventually. Or I’ll make you. Either way, I’ll have you, your cunningness, your ruthlessness.”
“What ‘we do’ is up to us, and this is a whole ’nother kettle of fish.”
Steve doesn’t have to live on the helicarrier any more, which is just as well, since his room there was destroyed during the crash, and living quarters aren’t a high priority for repairs.
Classic Steve
“I’m sure I could introduce you,” she goes on. “You’re just his type.”
we can’t actually DO it yet
All of this should be familiar. He’s been tortured before. Arguably worse than this. He should know how to handle himself.
“‘I hope you never have to read this, old friend,’” Steve begins, and wishes for his mind to sever him from reality as fully as it had before. His awareness of the courtroom is dim, but not dim enough.
He gets back to his feet and nods toward Steve and Tony. "Farewell. I haven't forgotten Stark's betrayal. I am interested to see how he might make it up to me."
In which Steve and Tony consult with friends and family. Then they actually end up in the same room and say things to each other! Do those things involve one asking the other out? Read to find out! (Yes. Yes it does.)
so the alien steve was talking about
Reed and Strange exchange a look. “Let’s wait for the others.”
When Steve turns back, the finefied man in white is gone.
.” Tony clutches Steve’s arms. “I’ve always wanted you,” he whispers.
“You didn’t see the expression on your face,” Tony says, hearing the strain in his voice, “when you got to Attilan. I broke us, don’t pretend I didn’t.”
The creature is like a horse in most ways Tony can name; it has the shape of a horse, the size of one, the coat of one, even the dull, sweet face of a horse. The long tail swishing at phantom flies rivals that of the finest Arabian.
playing marco polo across dimensions probably isn’t a good idea since it could attract all the things that want to kill us
Tony snakes a hand down Steve’s side to his ass, curling his hand so his fingers are in Steve’s crease. Steve shivers. “No,” he promises.
“Captain! Where’s Iron Man?”
“You seriously stayed up the rest of the night?” Sam asks, though he sounds more incredulous than concerned. “You’re lucky you don’t need sleep like the rest of us.”
“And now you’ll do anything for me.” Tony grins. His teeth are porcelain-white. “What do you want today, Steve? Maybe we want the same thing.”
to beat me to within—”
“Yeah, like what?” Steve scoffs.
Doom stands and replaces the armor on his hands. Without a word he strides to where Wormseed, Mugwort, and Slovenwood were. He removes a glass vial from his robes and carefully fills it with the red sand they left behind.
For all his wit, Tony’s stumped. He stalls, wracking his brain, before giving up. “Who, then?”
Steve clears his throat. “We were on Steve and Tony terms,” he says.
Steve wants to yell Tony’s name until he’s hoarse. Instead he holds Tony in his arms, counting each breath he takes.
Tony’s eyes dart away—Steve’s caught him staring across the table. Tony swallows and tries to focus his attention on Sam. Sam, who is Captain America now, and team leader, and will notice if Tony's not paying attention to the team meeting.
scrawny ass. Now can I go back to sleep?”
sorry. I’m on the astral plane with Stephen and the Ancient One
“You should’ve changed my overrides. I could’ve—I can’t—” Steve closes his eyes. “Please.” He’s speaking practically into Tony’s mouth. “Don’t make me do this without you.”
This man. This impossible, reckless, single-minded man loves Steve so much he’d rather die than live with Steve believing he’s an agent of injustice. And he antagonized Steve anyway, threw himself close and personal into their battles. Steve remembers how hard Tony hit him at the chemical plant once his armor rebooted. He remembers that awful, brain-shattering sound that gave him the kind of headache that only being punched in the jaw might cure him of. But did Tony ever even fire a repulsor? How many times did they go at it with Tony’s jet-boots on the ground?
When they want a less open-ended game, they pull a piloting simulation for a spaceship the shape of a pineapple. Then a collaborative murder-mystery-solving game, followed by a game of scrabble played on the surface of a holographic moon. Tony insists they try the oil-painting simulator, even though it just ends up being him watching and praising Steve as he makes messy underpaintings on a holographic canvas. The NMAT provides hot drinks and sweet sticky rice buns, and they play and explore until they can’t lift their arms and fall asleep piled together on Steve’s bed, surrounded by the calls and flights and fiery breaths of dragons the size of songbirds.
“Stark—watch the back door!” Rogers shouts.
“That's right. You can be my deputy,” Red Wolf says with a wry smile.
“Can’t say that I do, I’m afraid.”
you know, for sunbeams, they really were
A week ago, Steve would’ve said that Tony’s actions were unforgivable. Now…
and here I am right
so what was this physics stuff?
?” Tony knows he sounds desperate. In this moment, he’ll beg and bleed and split himself open for Steve’s cock rather than listen to this.
“So. When you say you like me, you don’t mean that you don’t like me?”
Steve’s eyes landed on Natasha’s across the dining table. “I keep saying the opposite of what I’m trying to say.”
“You’re not Steve. I’m on his side. Not yours.”
“No.”
The painting Steve saw a reproduction of is Édouard Manet's
They leave with more than enough evidence to arrest Lukin. It’s not as satisfying as if Steve had gotten to crush Red Skull’s neck with his shield, but it’s more than they had before. And Stark Industries is safe.
He nearly sobs when Tony touches him again. A hand in his hair, gentle at first, then gripping, tugging his head back.
Getting to know the different types of lies and the motivations of liars is like getting to better know someone with whom you are already deeply, childishly in love: every time you think there is nothing more to learn, a new surprise sweeps you off your feet.
A part of Steve wants him to, but he doesn’t know what he would say. He lets the back of his head fall over the back of the couch, remembering Tony’s profuse thanks from earlier in the night. If only Tony would let Steve make him that happy all the time. Or try to, anyway. Steve would try so hard, and sometimes he’d get it right, and Tony would be that much happier and taken care of. He’d bring Tony meals when he was lost in a project, help him clean up after lab explosions, and fall asleep squashed together. Just like this.
Steve nodded.
what’s up?
"Let me put you to bed and promise me you'll get some rest and eat a proper meal."
I seem to make him mad a lot
“I’m afraid Mr. Stark is unavailable,” JARVIS says again.
Tony’s been asking himself that question. But now he’s on his knees in front of the Hydra Supreme Leader, hearing it in Steve’s voice.
, Tony had said, because he'd learned the hard way what it costs him to lie to Steve.
Maybe that's why Tony has the courage to say, "Steve, I want to be with you. I don't know what I did that might've—that hurt you. But if you'll let me, I want to try again. To have a real relationship."
nah, the doctor made a day-long truce with them
“I meant to say that,” Steve said desperately.
“Can you phrase that more simplistically?”
“You said it would help with public perception of the new Captain America,” Friday says helpfully.
“And this is for how long?”
you know rhodes
“Don’t think I do.”
Tony waved the thought away. “I’ve had this in storage for nearly a decade. Pepper’s assistant found it and brought it out for the party.”
“You think I killed Bill. And, and, you’re right, I was responsible for what happened, and you’re just, what, letting go of that?”
"C’mon, just get it over with."
“I don’t mean

“And what’s that?”
“Sure thing, Steve.”
“Stark? What the hell are you wearing?”
Steve's eyes, blue as gemstones, are locked on Tony. Steve takes a breath in a deep gust. He leans in even further, but he's still waiting for something.
This struck her—both in the moment and in the years that followed—as the single most truthful statement she had heard in her life.

“Security,” Spencer replies.
oh hi sorry wanda it’s clint
His laughter batters him until he folds over and sobs.
what happened?!
When Tony looked up again, Steve was crouching next to Tony’s bed. “What about—everything with Bucky?”
“Man or woman?” Parker asks sternly.
Now Steve will laugh. Or knock Tony to the ground and bring the edge of his shield down on Tony’s neck. He’ll leave, or stay just long enough to tell Tony what a fool he is. Or, worse, try to be kind. In the spirit of his promise to compromise, he’ll tell Tony that he’s flattered, but he’s never thought of Tony that way.
James—she was reasonably sure—understood what she meant.
watch out for robots!
When someone says to you, "I'm not going to kill you," do they mean in this moment, or ever? When someone says something impossible, like, "I'll always love you," do you accept their intent or suspect that they are lying to keep you complacent? When someone says, "I'm not going to shoot you," do they mean that they will torture you instead, perhaps by coercing you into listening to their relationship problems? If your lover tells you that you're beautiful, that the scars don't matter, that the wounds you have healed from are over, that no matter what was done to you or you have done yourself you are not a monster, that you should wear a bikini anyway, if he says all of that and more, do you believe him? What if you feel the same way about him—that he is more than his history, more than a weapon, more than violence, that his survival is the most beautiful thing about him, that the best revenge is to live a happy peaceful life, that there's no need to wear long-sleeved shirts all the time, that really a speedo is the best look on him—then, do you believe him?
,” she repeats, seeing the look on his face. “Dead or no, he’s going to be a character witness for you.”
I think it’s a bookshop. Or maybe someone’s house. It doesn’t seem to be organized like a library, and we keep finding empty cups of tea, but there aren’t really prices on anything.
“Riddles, then,” the gatekeeper says. He clears his throat—or whatever he has. It sounds like a mechanical bull with a penny stuck in the gears. “Outta the eater came sumthin’ to eat, and outta the strong came sumthin’ sweet.”
“No worries, Cap,” Tony said.
He picks up where he and Steve left off: talking to people who might have seen or heard something. He speaks with Missus Knight, Miss Jones, and young Rick Jones (no relation), who know a few things about that accursed book. The next evening Tony walks into Nodding's saloon and smiles at Neppie. She smiles back and flounces up to him, murderous rumors apparently forgotten. Good thing, too: she and the other dancers pick up more about Timely’s comings, goings, and goings-on than you can shake a stick at. They'll know more than anyone else what's happened since the night Red Wolf was almost killed. They point him in the direction of one Thornton Tillard.
“Ta da!” Tony takes his hand off Steve’s eyes.
right so MOVING ON FROM THAT
“With Tony’s pain,” Natasha explains.
Tony frowned. “So—”
right of course! hi
. Except that one entire wall is clear—it looks like glass but it’s probably another one of those forcefields. On the other side is a larger room, about the size of the Avengers’ gymnasium, an assemblage of computers and metal arms in the center. The time machine, then.

“I believe you’ll find that I don’t.”
That’s what a friend should do, right? Enjoy seeing his teammate so thrilled, so awestruck. There will be plenty of time, later, to deal with the consequences. Too much time, really.
Tony pauses the show. “Oh, I mean, it probably won’t. I have it under control.” He’s not meeting Steve’s eyes.
what is THAT like
unacceptable pun count: 1
The gatekeeper’s featureless face caves in near the bottom, creating something that is not recognizable as a mouth, but a concave curve that can form words. The curve smiles and says, “Good evenin’ to you, Mister Stark.” The gatekeeper's voice is warped like the sound played on a wax cylinder that’s been left too long near the fire. “I’ll happily letcha by, if you best me in a contest.”
“I want. I just. I care about you, alright, and I, I always say the wrong thing, and do the wrong thing, and now I’ve done the worst, and—”
"Steve," he says before he can hold onto any other thoughts.
Honton’s eyes flick quick-as-a-wink to Stark before he says, “Just a friendly disagreement between old friends..”
The hands retreat. Tony knows Steve is far from finished, but his body is already sagging in relief.
Tony can’t deny it. He’s been given more chances than he deserves.
“Daisy here’s thrown a shoe,” Steve says.
“Who’s replacing Tony Stark?”
hey how’s my favorite social media legend
together, and that reason swells in Steve’s chest, welling up in his throat. He’s almost choking on it as it makes its way upward, squeezing tears out of his eyes.
“Oh, shut up. You don’t have to say anything about the most important part?”
Really? You’re not just saying that?
“Do you ever train in your uniform?” Tony asks.
Also we need to meet back up again so we don’t leave anyone behind.
interplanetary journeys, and had retrieved the book—cover falling off, pages curling with damp—from the collection he kept under his bed. The neon marquee of the Jewish delicatessen on the ground floor climbed alongside his window, and its scant saffron light was just enough to read by.
“What am—you had third-degree burns covering—”
Steve takes a steadying breath and turns off his treadmill. “Thank you for telling me,” he says finally.
“No,” Stark sighs. He scrubs the heel of his hand against his eyes. “I was engaged to his sister.”
They reach Stamford. Somehow, that topic doesn’t last them long.
you may ask, midgardian, but I make no promise of my reply
She hangs her purse across her body, puts on her backpack, and lifts the upright bass without any visible effort. When the train grinds to a halt at the 24th Street Mission station, she shoulders her way out of the car, against the opposing floor of boarding commuters, her dark hair lustrous and glossy even under the harsh fluorescents of the train.
Tony doesn’t. He socks Grizzly in the jaw through a cloud of flame. When the man falls, Tony crouches down to shield Red Wolf from a hail of bullets.
“Let’s play a game,” Tony purrs. “It goes like this: I’m the powerful lord of an opulent island prison, and you’re my captive.”
He’s right. Tony’s bombarded with so many sensations—the hurt all over his body, varied in intensity and form, the chill air against his bare skin, the sound of Steve’s heavy breath and furtive thrusts into his own fist—that the hot tears escaping his eyes barely register.
“Right,” Tony says, his gaze dropping down to his hands.
No one is standing over their game making side bets, though plenty are crowded round the other tables.
Next is Steve’s present. He both wants Tony to open it right away, and to put it off until the end to stave off his own embarrassment. The gift is wrapped a little messily, and Tony rips through it messily too, a gleeful expression on his face. There’s a custom wooden box Steve commissioned to hold the knives, made of walnut and lined with crimson velvet. The little sound Tony makes when he sees what’s inside is one Steve will treasure forever.
No one commented on this clear deception.
Victor stands so still his armor could be empty. “I have the Darkhold, yes. As you will see.”
Steve blanched briefly at the words. Then, as the implication unfolded in his mind, a smile broke out over his face. “Yeah?”
Getting to his feet is easier than he’d expected. Affecting a drunken shamble toward Rogers' window is even easier. “Oh, Danny boy!” he calls.

—and the last Gem grasps onto Tony’s reach, settles into place beside its siblings; Tony holds Infinity. He tries not to imagine. All that power, cosmic power, contained in the ethereal light of the Infinity Gems. Small things. And small is how he keeps his thoughts. Parker Robbins stirred all this up—so he’s gone, back to the Raft. A nuisance eliminated. What next?
“Is Steve okay?”
isn’t that wild??? :) :) :) :) :) :) :)
This was a lie, in the sense that it was not James, strictly speaking, who had shot her. Had James been himself, he wouldn’t have even been present to do so. It also suggested that James had only shot her once—while the truth was he had shot
If you know stuff about guns, I welcome polite corrections.
“I’ll just be a moment getting everything set up. I’ll come fetch you when it’s ready,” Ensign Sindrison says. “Make yourselves comfortable.” He indicates the couch, armchairs, and screens around the room. Then he’s gone.
The decorator, Alicia, is tall and severe, wearing a black silk jumpsuit with a white belt and white boots. Her blonde hair is almost as pale as her hands.
Steve missed his chance. He thought he’d have time. He’s a coward, and he thought—he’d hoped—that it would be Tony’s idea. They’d go to their favorite diner, the one with the weird omelets named after the Avengers, or a new restaurant Tony wanted to try. Tony would order dessert, and offer Steve a taste: a kiss once removed. They’d walk back to the mansion together, too absorbed in conversation to notice the cold or the passage of time or the clouds obscuring the night sky. And then Tony would take hold of his hand and smile that soaring, sky-high smile, and—
When Klithua and Brickenn are trapped on a damaged star cruiser on a collision course with a white dwarf star, he divulges to her that Earth’s solar system was the first to disappear, and that he is a galactic fugitive from governments and criminals alike because he possesses singular knowledge of the forces behind the culling of the stars.
The knocking at Steve’s door grows louder. “Go away,” he grumbles, trying to hide under his covers. If someone’s come to visit him, it means the battle against AIM is over. Steve’s missed the entire thing and it didn’t even matter.
Steve’s phone buzzes. He pulls it out of his pocket and checks it without excusing himself.
“What if I have plans for you at home?”

They say little on the flight to the space station. Steve doesn’t bother to ask why Tony’s in the armor. Maybe he’s going to fly back to the

Tony grins, puts on his helmet, jets into the air and calls, “Watch this!”
The fridge was impressive, sure. It gleamed and—like most of the things in Stark Tower—was comprised a lot of polished metal and glass. He’d loved seeing Tony’s excitement as he explained about the different temperature controls for hard cheeses versus soft ones versus fresh ones. And the Gruyère and the sheep’s milk brie really had been delicious. To this day, Steve’s not sure whether Tony had been joking about sending one robot to San Francisco for sourdough and another to Paris for baguette, but he’d managed to enjoy the food and company, mostly.
except he said it all british
Last autumn, Jim Rhodes came and spent a fortnight in Timely. They’d gone to a market a train stop away and Rhodey’d brought back one of those big jumpin’ jack pumpkins. It’d sat in front of Tony’s forge long after Rhodey returned to his steamship, until it began to grow soft and rotten. The thing folded in on itself, a wide crease curving up like a smile.
Well, of course she’s noticed. “Do you think he’d like a set of cheese knives?” Steve asks. Tony’s birthday is less than a month away now. But Natasha doesn’t need anything so pedestrian as context: she knows exactly what Steve’s talking about.
Most of the people he overhears at the beach seem to be locals. They bring tote bags of blankets and shawls and express nonstop surprise at the warm weather and how they didn’t even need the jacket they brought. They play music on their little waterproof speakers and don’t seem to care when the sound is overwhelmed by the waves.

Everything goes smoothly at the knife shop Steve had found online. His custom order will be ready just in time for Tony’s birthday party. He makes his way down the crowded sidewalk toward his bike with a smile on his face. Tony may not feel the same way Steve does, but they’re friends. If Tony’s caught on to Steve’s—let’s call it infatuation—he’s been polite enough not to say anything. They hang out nearly every day. And, hopefully, Steve’s found a good birthday present for him.
“Of course,” Tony finds himself saying. “Of course. Anything you want.”
Tony’s on his feet now, eye level with Steve. For a moment, Tony looks blank, thoughtful, almost bored. Then he laughs, a bright, uncanny sound. Steve’s not sure the last time he heard Tony laugh so fully and loosely, free of bitterness. “That’s what you came here for.”

“Lukin is—”
Steve shrugs. “Don’t see as how one follows the other.”
I won’t let that stop me, Mr. Barton.
When he sees an arsenic-green cloud rising over the dam, Tony entertains the idea that he and Red Wolf might live through the day. Though he suspects Bruce and Missus Barnes haven’t.
Tony is put to rest among the stars. Steve doesn’t know if Tony had asked for this, but he thinks Tony would’ve appreciated that his funeral service involved a rocket being shot into space.
Two days after the battle against the Asgardian sorceress, the Avengers held a team meeting.
“Can’t fool me,” Steve says easily. “Brimstone’s just some hot iron an’ rotten eggs.”
But a single set of footsteps enters the room, and Tony knows it’s Steve alone.
But this is what has to happen and fuck, Tony doesn’t believe in any kind of life after death but if there’s nothing then that means there’s no pain and if there’s no pain—maybe it’s like being drunk. Maybe it’s quiet there.
Natasha would probably not ever entirely recover from James not recognizing her, nor the times James had shot at her. But she had completely forgiven him—to the extent he was even responsible, which is to say not responsible at all—so she meant to convey to him how much she
A voice without sound murmurs at the edges of Steve’s mind, like catching movement out of the corner of his eye. The voice is yearning. It wants to be free. It wants to help.
“Okay,” Steve says without conviction. He’s going to be a jumble of nerves until tomorrow night. Natasha’s still watching him with that inscrutable expression, which only adds to his disquiet. “You’re probably right.”
Tony’s breath is hot on Steve’s skin. “Steve,” he says, speaking so quietly Steve has to strain to hear, letting more and more of his weight fall into Steve, lips close and wet. He wriggles, like he can go deeper, like he can make this even more intimate. “Don’t be silly.” He sounds amused. His thrusts are leisurely, dragging slick and hard in Steve’s hole.
“Tomorrow night.” Steve scrubs the heels of his hands over his eyes and pushes himself to sit upright. “We’re hanging out at the Tower. Going to watch more Star Trek.”

conversation.
There's an ache behind Tony's eyes that threatens to manifest as tears. He clenches his fists, then forcibly relaxes them. His gaze falls on the symbols written onto his skin. All he has on is a thin hospital gown, and the cuff on his left wrist covering his soulmark. It's plain, old-fashioned in style—nearly a twin to the one Steve had been wearing the day Tony's dreams had come true. The last day he remembers.
It shouldn’t be a relief to feel Tony’s cock drag in and out of him, he shouldn’t relish the burn each time Tony withdraws far enough that his cockhead catches on the rim of Steve’s battered hole. But Steve understands what's between them now: this isn’t the first time one of them has enacted violence on the other, and it may be the most truthful.
“Any requests for lunch?”
Tony matches Steve’s smile with a relieved one of his own. “Oh, good. And the color scheme’s okay?”
The small smile on Steve's face reaches his eyes this time.
The longer he holds it in his bare hands, the surer he is that the book is breathing. It throbs minutely against his skin, the pages inflating and emptying like a bellows. He wonders if it’s readying itself to speak.
we’ll keep an eye out I guess
“We’ll depart as soon as you’re ready,” Victor agrees, tracing one metal finger down the book’s spine.

Tony’s hand makes contact with Steve and instead of standing on the scuffed linoleum of the town health-food co-op under the fluorescent lights listening to Gene Kelly through crappy speakers he’s in free-fall, his stomach swirling, white dots like snowflakes dancing in front of his eyes, and Steve’s dressed like a 4th of July mascot and he has Brian, wearing a gaudy red and yellow costume, pinned against the wall of a skyscraper.
“How long did you know for sure?” Tony asked.
They’re still laughing and smiling as they waft down and land simultaneously on what is apparently the floor, the gravity returned to normal. Tony’s pulled his helmet off, further mussing his already tousled hair. He pushes it out of his eyes. The wrist and thumb of his metal hand graze the skin of his forehead, and Steve wonders what it feels like—not Iron Man against his skin, he knows that, knows it from handshakes and flying together and crowded news conferences—but to understand oneself through the barrier of a metal shell. The question is joined by memories of reaching for Tony with gloved hands, and he wants nothing more in this moment than to run his bare fingers through Tony’s hair. To hold him close and breathe in the joy and glee sparking in his eyes, the bow of his smile, the crinkles of his crow’s feet.

“You play the lyre?” ask all three heads, tilting their question toward him.
“So,” Tony plows onward, “I wanted to tell you that, even if you’re stuck like this, without the serum, there’s lots you can do.”
If she is, would you put her on, please?
okay fine
“Dreadful sorry, I seem to have the wrong room,” Tony says.

As he crosses the room to reach Tony, he catches Sam saying, “Have fun!” in a sing-song voice Steve doesn’t know quite what to make of.
Furthermore, it is often said that apologies are for small things, mistakes and errors in judgment you have learned from and will never repeat, like using a teammate's throwing knife to slice a cantaloupe or replacing a friend's quiver with a plastic toy designed to market the film "Brave." People who believe such things will tell you that there are no apologies for things like shooting someone with whom you have previously been romantically involved, using a teammate's curling iron to perform an experiment on gamma radiation, or stalking you through the Siberian taiga. These people will tell you that apologies are only meaningful if you will truly never perform the offending action again—actions like doing unspeakable things while brainwashed, when one doesn't exactly choose to be brainwashed in the first place.
“Why?” Steve asks. Tony’s already reaching for his bag of toys, the big leather one with the silk rope and reinforced cuffs—Steve’s opinion is irrelevant.
tweeted that you’re America’s new favorite couple,” Spencer says, sounding as if this level of publicity offends him on a personal level.
“How’d you know to come here, anyway?”
He can’t indulge in anger right now, Tony tells himself. He can do this. Steve is listening, he said he’d listen. So what if Tony sounds desperate; they can’t keep going on like they have. Something needs to change, whether Tony survives the rest of the day or not.
“Are you having some kind of moral panic about lying?” Tony asked. “You can fucking save it, I’m used to being lied to by now.”

The truth about the Avengers is—well. Natasha prefers to keep her opinions close to the chest.
Tony stops in at the saloon now and then to chat with the ladies of the line, or sometimes to buy a general treat for all company present and eat the free lunch that comes with a man’s first drink order of the day. Thurlow’s good enough to take his money and fill glasses with water without comment.

Days pile up behind him. He gets through the week. He wonders when the outrage will hit. Or maybe the shame will come first.
Soon Steve fucks him again, though this time he opens Tony up slowly, fingers slippery, like this injury alone is a line he’s refusing to cross, and when he leaves, Tony is still picking himself up, come and lube sliding down his thighs.
so I could end up in an l-field that’s one of the ones they might be in but it might be a long time before or after they’re there
He wishes he could just talk to Tony himself. Ask him what’s wrong, how he can help. But he and Tony aren’t like that anymore—if they ever were. The camaraderie they’d shared before the Civil War feels like a daydream. Tony has every reason to be wary of him, Steve reminds himself. Of course, the thought does nothing to alleviate his worry.
That’s what he thinks, anyway, until the latter gallops in and shoots Fisk in the head.
“I’ll stop coming here,” Steve says.
Steve knows what he’s supposed to do. He’s supposed to talk about how he’s feeling—which is impossible, because he can’t talk about what’s not there. But Sam’s been trying to get in touch with him, and, well, if Steve can manage a week working at SHIELD, he can reach out to his friends—what friends will speak to him, given his work these days.

Tony’s mouth snaps shut.
One of the women rides Steve’s thigh while she waits for a more active partner, and a couple of the men jack off onto his chest. Three people come on Steve’s face; one of them is Tony. A fourth takes hold of the gag, bending him back and getting to her knees like she’s going to sit on his face, but Tony catches her at it and yells her out of the room. The surge of gratitude Steve feels is distinctly out of proportion with the action, but he sinks into it, imagining that Tony’s is the only scent in the room, that Tony’s is the only mess cooling on his skin—that the hands in his hair are Tony’s, the grip on his bicep is Tony’s, the hand snaking up the inside of his thigh and the fingers searching his crease and finding the base of the plug—the grunts, the high-pitched moans, the smacks of a palm hitting taut skin, the wet sounds of mouths and genitals and skin and lube—all Tony’s.
“You're gonna have to tell me what you were arguin’ about,” Steve says, not for the first time.
in addition, we are currently on the 9th floor
“That’s it then? I just—we’ll never work together again?”
“But right then,” Steve says, forcing his voice steady, “how could I have stopped you?”
Deals 1480 damage, plus 105 for each Team Cap Escalation tile, 120 per tile if target is Team Iron Man, or 135 per tile if target is Iron Man.
Sam gave Steve’s shoulder a shove. “What the hell, man?”
“If they want me to look like I think this is a good idea, they’re going to be disappointed,” he’d said.
“Oh,” Tony says again. “I want that too, Steve. Of course I do.”
“Well, you don’ need a devil’s bargain to spin your own gold.”
“Hey,” Steve says, opening the door and then ducking back into his room. “Sorry I’m not ready, I can’t find my workout clothes, and I wasn’t sure you were going to make it.”
So he’d left early and headed back to the Avengers Dorm to spend some quality time with a punching bag. A reinforced, supersoldier-proof—and it was, Hulk and Carol had tested the prototypes—punching bag designed by Tony Stark. Even at home, he couldn’t—still can’t—escape being reminded of Tony.
Steve visits Tony at the garage. Tony recognizes his booted footsteps and the smell of Chinese takeout and emerges from under the car he’s working on, wiping his hands on a rag.
Natasha’s journey to the Forbidden Zone had been a quick and direct one from Moscow. “Quick and direct” is a phrase which here means that Natasha had stolen only one vehicle more than the official mission plan, and strangled only three unanticipated men with her thighs.
it didn’t have any tentacles it was just eldritch
“Right, of course,” Steve replies, finally finding a clean pair of sweatpants and stuffing them into his gym bag. Of course, of course Tony doesn’t want to talk about being sick. He wants Steve to pretend he doesn’t know he left the lecture earlier that morning.
definitely not Ultron
“More’n you’d think, I reckon.”
Tony has to fight through a haze of pain to take in what Steve’s saying. He believes Steve immediately. It’s not that Tony’s pretending Steve’s someone else. It’s not that this man speaks with the voice of the one Tony loves. No, Tony knows it’s true because he has no doubt of Steve’s eagerness to hurt Tony himself.
Steve stops what he’s doing and straightens up, actually looking at Loki now. She preens.
“Nice o’ you to say, Sheriff,” Stark replies, and slings back a pull of his flask as if to illustrate his point. “Who would it be then, I wonder?” he muses, scratching at the shadow of stubble on his chin.
Converts a chosen basic yellow tile into a 2-turn Countdown tile, then stuns the target. The target remains stunned as long as the countdown tile is on the board. The tile deals 240 damage when it reaches 1 and 510 damage when it reaches 0.
– Unexpected happenings after an event is supposed to be over
Tony strides forward and wraps an arm around Steve’s back as tendrils of silver-white armor circle toward Tony like satellites losing orbit. The armor crawls over him, a snake shedding its skin in reverse, and when his jet-boots kick in he lifts Steve with him. Steve dangles in Tony’s grip, a dead weight, as Tony locks his mouth onto Steve’s and forces it open with his tongue.
how’d you get on this chat may I ask?
Tony suggests they go for a walk and before he’s prepared for it they’re outside, in front of the memorial, and he can’t put this off any further. “It could’ve been me,” he says, plain as he can. “Stamford, the New Warriors. That could’ve been me.”
“It’s
he can't even finish the question in his own mind. "Are you okay, Steve? It sounds like it's been—difficult."
Steve’s rhythm finally speeds up, but Tony doesn’t have it in him to be relieved. Steve will stay hard. He can keep fucking Tony’s face for hours, if he wants.
“I know," Steve says.
Delighting in Tony’s confusion puts an ugly grin on Steve’s face, but at least it masks his own desperation. Anger is safer. Anger is all Tony deserves.
there aren’t italics
“Never saw the appeal, myself.”
but thank you
What is special is certain lies from certain people. Sometimes the right lie, at the right time, can mean the world.
“Whassat?”
Steve ducked his head. Neither Tony nor the surveillance cameras could see whether his eyes were wet. “I don’t appreciate that at all, Tony.”
Steve says so, and when Stark turns to smile at him their faces are close enough for Steve to count his eyelashes. A familiar strain twists in his chest, catching his breath. It’s not the first time Steve’s thought of leaning in and planting a kiss on Stark's mouth, but it's the first time he’s thought Stark might have the same idea.
Steve cocked his head. “Wanna run that by me again?”
“Stop actin’ like you dunno dung from wild honey and fess up. I’m gonna help you, ain’t I?”
She is currently revising the list of who she holds dear.
However, the truth is that Tony has—from time to time—been known to tell lies.
“Maybe,” Tony says, laughing a little. He takes a sip of his coffee. Steve made it perfectly, like he always does, with as much sugar as Tony wants, rather than the amount he says he takes.
“How’d you find out?” Steve asks. At her glare, he adds, “If it’s not, I don’t know, against your spy code to tell me.”
Is it weird to wish that his hearing were even more powerful, strong enough to hear Tony’s heartbeat?
Tony’s not going to ask.
The way Tony meets his gaze leaves Steve no doubt that Tony knows he doesn’t mean just now. “You could’ve told me the truth. You know, before a bad guy blindsided me with a video of my mom being murdered.”
Evening is on its way, but there’s light enough to work by. Tony pulls out the armor gauntlet he’s packed and spends a blissfully carefree while tinkering with the wires inside. He checks the main fuel canister, then the spares. They’re all full up, which is good news for all his plans except having a back that doesn’t ache from lugging the weight around. When the sun sets behind him, he takes out his hoofpick and cleans Apple’s hooves, not that she needs it.
“I didn’t kill him.”
They need Tony for something, so Tony has to get out of here. Now.
playing dumb doesn’t suit you
“I still don’t like the call you made,” Steve starts, and Tony feels dread building from a distance, the way he feels, at high altitudes and in freezing weather, phantoms of the ice that doesn't form on his armor. “You and Xavier and Reed and the others. But I understand why you did. It’s not just personal, though. I need to know these things to do my job, and I didn’t.”
Before Tony can reply, Steve goes on. “Those posters people made were something else, huh?”
Yeah, that’s too bad.
No one’s wanted to claim Steve's horse, Apple, so a fortnight after her owner’s passing, Tony does everyone a favor and rides her out toward the mountains, the Book of Sins packed into his saddlebag.
Tony sighed. “No.”
OH omg the librarians!
“Oh, don’t let us stop you,” Parker says.
The floor of the bowling alley is a black and white checkerboard. Tony watches the people in line to rent shoes or waiting for their turn to play and assigns them all to chess pieces. He thinks of the white reflector lines separating lanes on a highway, the way they flash by in his peripheral vision on long drives, caught in a road trance, black, white, off, on, one, zero.
Sunlight streams through the destroyed roof. It hits the room like hail against a canvas tent, pounding down too-bright for the warped wood floors, the mess of wires and pipes and splintered beams—the debris and disarray that remains of their home.
The truth is that lies are everywhere, like snow in the Siberian tundra. Sometimes it’s the shape of the lies that tell us what we need to know, much like how the shape of footprints in fresh snow can tell us whether we’re being pursued by a musk deer, a Manchurian wapiti, an Amur tiger, or a brainwashed, biochemically enhanced sniper. Other times it’s the absence of certain lies that give us the most information—like a friend who chooses to say nothing at all instead of offering up a platitude like, “It’s going to be fine” when you embark on a high-risk project to destroy all traces of a clandestine fascist organization, or a team leader who, despite a great amount of pride in the matter, doesn’t bother denying that he hasn’t had a full night’s sleep in five days and should, therefore, be scrapped from an upcoming scheduled mission.
The address is that of an empty industrial building. Inside he finds Strange—still in a nonphysical form—and he’s not alone.
“Are you,” Tony begins, speaking into the mattress, letting the thorough embrace of Steve’s weight buoy him. He wants this, he wants Steve’s touch, his attention, the press of his body, just like this. He wants it. His strained legs twitch from exertion. “You’re angry with me. Because of whatever I did that I can’t remember.”
definitely
“Is that all you’ve seen here?”
Steve lets himself be led, feeling a bit lost. It’s not long, though, before he forgets to worry, because he and Tony are bickering over a racing game, and then they’re laughing, and then Tony’s hand is over his, trying to wrest a joystick out of his grasp, boasting about how he’s going to kick Steve’s ass in the next round, just wait and see, Cap.
“Just gonna give way and let yourself get strung up, is that it?” Steve asks, furious. “‘N what about those who’ll come to prefer that to seein’ you souse yourself like you’re brinin’ a pickle?”
“Parker, no,” Hardison interrupts.
and sunbeams
“I…” Tony blinks snow out of his eyes. Steve’s limned in fuchsia light, like he’s standing in front of the sign of the PH Diner. Pine trees shift in the wind behind him, rendered into dark silhouettes by the sinking sun. “Steve, I see this girl—and sometimes—the snow and—aren’t things just, just
Loki’s gift is a framed photo collage of herself, portraying at least two of her genders and a variety of elaborate costumes. Other than that, the remaining presents are blocks of cheese or bottles of alcohol, and Steve starts to feel self-conscious that so many people got Tony cheese-related presents, too.
you just eat when you’re nervous
Tony wants to turn away. He forces himself not to, and if he can’t quite maintain eye contact, Steve’s the only one to see him. He tells Steve about fighting Machine Man when he was drunk. His voice doesn’t waver or crack. His face is the faceplate made flesh, a blank cutout. “This close.
Tony's made a lot of promises to himself lately.
“Of course not!”
Steve comes twice more like that, buried inside of Tony, cutting off Tony’s air just to feel Tony shudder and clench around him. When he finishes he showers alone, dresses, and leaves Tony there, messy and naked and barely clinging to consciousness. Steve doesn’t bother with restraints. He doesn’t need them; Tony can’t walk on his own.
Tony nods.
“What?” Steve straightens up, setting his textbook down. “How so?”
Yeah ::blushing face::
“What—why are you agreeing to this? Why now?”
It's like falling from a great height. Tony's heart is in his throat. As much as it feels like they did this only yesterday, it also feels like Tony would never get to do this again.
“That paparazzo’s lucky Hammer punches as bad as he does everything else,” Spencer says.
“Yeah, last I checked, why, why wouldn’t Steve be okay?”
I mean even if he is I wanna take him out to dinner and stuff first
He does his job and little else. Once a month, he goes to San Francisco.
He should’ve been able to catch himself, at least. To roll to his feet. Instead he pushes himself up and finds his arms slow and heavy. His vision tilts and whirls and he shakes with the effort it takes to sit. His body looks as young and strong and ripe as ever, but his muscles feel sore, spent.
Tony takes a silent, shivering inhale. God, why won’t his brain catch up? “That’s… I’m glad to hear you say that, Steve. We can work through this. We always have in the past.”
Steve’s spent a long time miserable over Tony: over Tony’s actions and inactions, and now his absence. During the war, his anger turned Tony into a traitor and a villain. Now, Steve’s nostalgia and longing have created another Tony in his mind, as fictitious as the Skrull impersonating him. A Skrull who died protecting his Captain America as surely as the real Tony did—it’s another distorted echo, like landing in the Savage Land. Steve’s memory is perfect as far as objective reality goes, but his memories of the subjective truth of Tony lose coherence the longer he goes without being in the presence of Tony himself. What’s clear is that Steve bears the blame for his own misery. And if he
of course not!!! i just thought you might y’know know who did it and why
It ended with James—mental programming intact once more—pursuing Natasha through the forest for two days straight before she was able to rendezvous with her contact. She considered herself fortunate that the bullet James had fired at her in the moments before her escape had left her with only a graze.
“Stand aside,” Victor commands.
okay so
Distracted by thoughts of Tony—Tony, meeting him at the pretzel cart, still covered in glitter from a night at Club A; Tony, putting on pajamas, wrapping himself in blankets, and sitting right next to Steve to watch TV, even though there’s five other couches in the room; Tony, as Steve imagines he looks in the morning, comfy slippers on his feet, rubbing his eyes, demanding coffee and a cheese omelette—Steve almost misses the flash of yellow and black ducking into the crowd.
Steve had promised not to tell anyone what Jan told him, but. “Well—”
“Oh,” Steve says. “Not right now?”
What started out as a welcome thought lurches and stutters in his mind as Tony imagines regaining consciousness to find his body littered with marks and stains he can’t remember Steve leaving on him. He pictures waking with blood running down the inside of his leg, with bruises in the back of his throat, with handprints on his skin, and not recognizing the violence done to him.
right
“What? Why?”
or a lot of ants I bet
“Okay, first of all,” Sam says, all exaggerated aggrievement, “how the hell do you have an action figure of a starship? It’s a model. Hand-painted and hand-assembled. Second, I
Seeing Steve’s shake of the head, Winter Soldier nods knowingly. “Thoughts of my love keep me awake, too.” Natasha pats Winter on the back without looking away from Steve’s face. Well, his hands and forearms, and the bits of his face that peek through his fingertips, which is all she can see.
“Unhelpful comparison, then. Okay, so, there’s nothing actually blocking my airway or in my lungs or anything like that—nothing more than usual anyway—but when it gets bad, it’s like, this pressure, digging into me. I can’t actually feel the reactor, inside me. I mean, there aren’t nerve endings there. But when it flares up it’s this—this spiraling pressure, like, like a whirlpool, and the centripetal force is making my ribcage curl in on itself, pressing more and more until it’s pushing all the air out of my lungs and just trying to inhale makes everything hurt worse.”
“What sorta contest?”
“No more so than usual,” Steve teases. Seeing the serious expression on Tony’s face, he sobers and adds, “No, not like what you mean. Like Robbins did something we missed? Some side effect of you having the Gems? No, I don’t get that feeling at all.”
Grizzly’s dropped his gun. “Now, hey, wait a minute,” he begs. “God doomit—wait!”
The injury to his feet is painful and vast. The hurt of it doesn’t so much swallow him whole as slurp him down its gullet. It’s part of him now, and while it grows more excruciating each time he wobbles and stumbles on the balls of his feet, trying to keep the weight off his arms, it doesn’t ebb and flow like the pain in his side. The welts and bruises on his back and thighs sit on him like insects with needles for legs, but they’re a kind of hurt so familiar they become inconsequential.
“Yeah. Okay. I have a place or two,” Tony says, confident and tentative at once. “No one will think to look for us there. Untraceable too, even if we make a few calls to let people know we’re safe.”
Tony keeps surprising him. It’s not the apology Steve might’ve wished for ten minutes ago, but he means it. “Stop. Damnit Tony, just stop.”
UM is that seriously how orangutang is spelled
Steve had chewed on his lip, hesitating, then said,
“I keep
“So tell me,” Steve says, and he makes it sound like a command rather than a plea.
chiik chikk
but I mean he’s captain america he’d protect anyone
Hearing Tony say his name shouldn’t feel like such a big win, but Steve savors it. “I’ll be there.”
my intel indicates that Fury’s bugs were disabled at the same time
Synergy Between the Characters
Steve should second thoughts, Tony thinks. After what Tony put him through. The betrayal, the fighting, all of Tony’s lies. Steve’s memories—
though both types aspire to eliminate humans, they are also in conflict with one another
“Only here as a favor to Mister Kellerman, are you?”
The Asgard crisis dealt with, the public reaches for comfort and familiarity. They look to Steve. Steve has nothing to offer them.
Steve presses his advantage. He knocks his double on his back, pins him to the ground. He ignores the world-tilting sense-memory of having Tony in exactly this position—
It is. It really is. There’s no reason for Steve to be upset. Of course Tony is enjoying this more than he is; Tony’s the futurist, after all. Steve’s the one who’s already woken up decades in the future.
He does the job. He gives orders, he replies to questions, and he says little else.
so what would work better is if more of our reality were physically connected to the building
“Have you ever met the man who settled this valley, Mister Stark?”
Panic wars with denial as Tony races down the corridor.
part is implied.
“Okay, let’s approach this illogically.” Tony winced at his words. “And anything we say or imply right now, we will bring up repeatedly and tease the other about mercilessly forever.”
Tony watches him, head cocked. The skyline glitters beyond Steve’s window. It paints golden highlights on Tony’s skin, layering over the faint blue gleam that radiates from his implant. “I don’t have to stay here. It’s okay, I can—”
Steve was important to him once, too. Or, Steve thought he was.
“Thank you,” Tony says after a moment.
Tony laughs, delighted. “Well, maybe not. But I have fond memories, let’s say.” He’s holding a collar now, a narrow band of metal with four D-rings evenly spaced around it. “Being in love with you wasn’t
“Yes,” she says, a knowing smirk playing on her face. “But don’t get regular cheese knives from a department store or something like that.”
do you think it means something?!
a big deal, Steve—god, this is perfectly clear, I am completely sure of what we’re trying to say right now—”

Steve sits on the floor, face pointed, unseeing, at the window, and lets a sob escape his lips. Each heavy breath wracks his shoulders.
The nightmare will be over. His part is done. Registration will only gain more support after his death. Dying was always part of the plan. He thought it would be in a fight; Steve doesn’t kill, after all. No, he leaves that to his friends. In the confusion of battle, maybe no one would be sure how Tony died, who was responsible. Maybe no one would have to bear the burden of being his executioner. But Steve volunteered, and maybe it’s better this way. Steve will be the last thing Tony sees.
“Okay,” Tony says slowly. “Have fun?”
Once Steve is settled on the couch, Tony connects to the line designated for the Leverage team. “Alright, we’re all set up. Looks like they’re not on the call yet.”
Steve’s naked, flat on his back in one of Tony’s huge minimalist beds, Tony straddling him. He tries not to let any expression show on his face. This isn’t the first time Tony’s said something like that. Steve’s not sure what the point is; is he supposed to believe that?
Natasha’s gift is presented with utmost precision, like the hospital corners equivalent of giftwrapping. Steve’s sitting right in front of it and can’t even see where the tape is. It’s decorated with beautiful papercut designs, which, given her skill with knives, she must have made herself. Tony opens it carefully, leaving all the paper as intact as possible.
Don’t worry, Jan. I’ve seen Young Frankenstein. I think Tony and I can handle a creepy German lady and ominous violin playing.
you better be okay and just ghosting me to mess with me
“Yeah. It’s me.” Tony searches Steve’s face. “It’s complicated. Extremis, or what’s left—”
Rogers comes back to town with the man who they say tried to blow up Roxxon’s dam; seems he’s found someone else’s life to save. Tony drinks his whiskey and tries to leave well enough alone. He almost manages it, too, until he sees a band of Fisk’s boys heading for the sheriff’s station, Turk leading the way; four on one just isn’t sporting. Tony knows he’s not much of a wheel-horse these days, and lord knows Rogers deserves better than Tony when he’s loaded to the gunwales, but it’s what he’s getting tonight.
"Promise me," Steve says, one arm going around Tony's shoulders, pulling their bodies closer. "Promise you'll stand with me."
Steve figures no response is necessary to a sentence like that, and they fly the rest of the way back to campus with barely another word exchanged.
His new apartment is in Bed-Stuy. There aren’t as many memories there.
None of this is meant to imply that the Avengers didn’t spend time together, which would have meant few opportunities to observe the change in their teammates and a plausible excuse for failing to notice it. In fact, in addition to team meetings, there were weekly team movie nights, frequent impromptu hang-outs in common areas of the compound, sub-meetings regarding the team’s PR and news appearances, meetings with government liaisons, and regular training regimens in flight, hand-to-hand combat, agility, and marksmanship.
This, to Tony’s great relief, seems to baffle his opponent. Furrows form at the top of the gatekeeper’s head, as if he’s frowning absent eyebrows. “Well, what is it?” he asks at last.
“Is it worse than bein’ hung for murder?”
There’s Iron Man, who Steve has been fighting, and Tony Stark, who unmasks and winks at cameras, and there’s the man who came here alone—who never doubted that Steve would do the same.
Instead, Steve wouldn’t even give Tony the chance to explain why he believed in Registration.
“And I’m in place for the denouement with Hammer,” Spencer goes on as if Hardison hadn’t spoken.
what language are the books in?
“I could be,” he answers, recovering quickly.
“Look. You can’t see from my perspective because it’s predicated on the premise that superheroes don’t make mistakes. And you’re Captain America.” Tony meets Steve’s eyes. “You don’t make mistakes.”
Wong’s in Chinatown when Tony finds him, talking with a man selling hot rice from a cart. When he catches sight of Tony, Wong drags him by the shoulder into a narrow alley in the thicket of tents and shanties. “You here about that book, Stark?”
“Sharon, the shooter—” Tony is cut off by the sound of a rifle being fired, loud and close, and Steve doesn’t know who’s been shot or if the bullet hit its target but there’s no sound of it hitting the suit or anything else, and then there’s another shot, another, another, and the full weight of Tony and his armor pins Steve to the ground, hard and cold and then warm and wet—
hey guys is this a prank?
What else can you tell us about them?
"Let me try. Let me show you."
Tony gives a jerky nod, his eyes catching and reflecting the light from his chest.
“Oh, Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling!”
unknown. the children tackled the creature and overpowered it so we made our exit. however evidence suggests it was the librarian
“Tony,” Steve says, raising his voice. “I didn’t mean it like that,” he goes on, more quietly, speaking carefully and over-enunciating as a result. “You have every reason to not want to see me. To be angry with me.”
Steve knows how to do this; this is a challenge he can meet. His thoughts sharpen, honed on the siege of bodies and movement around him. He springs forward shield-first.
PASSIVE:
There’s supposed to be another Avengers team. All sides of the war over Registration, cooperating. Steve’s supposed to be in charge. Of the team, of what’s left of SHIELD, of restoring people’s faith in heroes.
He’s gone for hours. Steve’s thoughts deteriorate into a tangle of counted breaths and suppressed thoughts.
with the gold embossing, a housewarming present from Tony—are still in the tower, as far as he knows. Maybe Tony got rid of them.
Then Loki showed up, and even though she hadn’t been invited there was plenty of bread and cheese and crudités to go around. Steve had still been harboring unformed hopes about how the rest of the evening might go, but Loki’s arrival finally put them to rest.
The hand disappears, and he tries to blink his eyes clear. An arm wraps around his back, pulling him close. A distant part of him notices that it’s trembling.
Steve pants and turns to Tony, who hovers beside him, eyes gray and dark, the color of clouds swollen with rain and thunder. His veins bulge out of his flesh in lines of silver. The metal breaches his skin most densely on his face, splitting into craggy branches from the corners of his eyes.
As a result, by the time of their encounter, his mental programming had begun to deteriorate and glitch.
“Can you tell him I stopped by?” Steve asks.
I just don’t think steve’s that kind of guy
“So I hate you, it’s not a big deal.”
Even without context, Steve knew Tony was talking about his parents’ murder. “Not too long.”
“You’ll what? You’ll what, Steve? Take your invisible jet out to give me a hand? Teleport over?”
I don’t do that *in front of Tony*!
Steve, who had—much to Peggy's amusement and teasing—spoken almost exclusively of Tony, replied, “You didn’t come up."
Steve grabs Tony by the hair and jerks him up, forcing Tony to face him. In his other hand is a Cosmic Cube.
Tony musters up a placid mask of polite interest. “Is what true?”
Something alights in the creature's eyes at the word
“‘Stark truths divulged by Hammer, Stone,’” Parker continues. “‘End of the Stone age: Iron Man is Target of Stone, Hammer.’ ‘Sticks & Stones, Hammer & “nail ’em,” Stark & Rogers.’ Etcetera.”
Another option is JARVIS. He probably has enough data that he’s already manifested a low-level L-field at the least, if not a full L-space node. So maybe you two can get him connected to where this multiverse’s L-space network has intersected with the physical location of the Timeless Archives
“If Earth was being invaded, right now, I’d trust you to have my back.”
What’s more likely is that Tony’s suspicions are true, and Steve is in an impossible situation, trying to shield Tony from the truth of the danger they’re both in.
“You’d better. Lotta people say I’ve got more’n just hair under my hat.”
A tingling sensation tiptoes up Steve’s spine. Tony’s eyes remind him of pouring maple syrup onto a stack of challah French toast.
What does the library where you encountered them look like?
The silver mask nods. The voice that replies is deep and dark as the bottom of a well. “What brings you to my home, Stark?”
Deals 2900 damage or 3500 if the target has dealt the most damage on the enemy team.
: Wilson and I have been doing flyovers at regular intervals and taking readings
“Hi Tony,” Steve replied, trying to keep his grin under control.
He could mean
Apple, of course, does not reply.
“I’ll take your word on it.”
Steve’s jaw works. This is ludicrous.
On the fourth day, Tony fights through the haze of drugs and pushes himself to his feet. He collapses from pain seconds later, and hours later Steve finds him groaning on the floor. He hauls Tony up, tosses him on the bed, and beats him with his belt until the marks from the knife and cane are red and raised once more, and Tony bleeds with fresh cuts.
“You haven’t been asking me any,” Steve pointed out.
James shook his head and followed after her.
so I had to cover for this guy like “oh I was just working on some armor upgrades when we started traveling through the multiverse”
sorry sorry i’m here now i just spilled coffee on my phone and then i had to change my clothes and then i went to get a new coffee but they ran out of everything except decaf
—but he may as well have.
Steve’s jaw clenches. “It doesn’t matter.”
“It’s me,” the thing—illusion, LMD, Skrull straggler—says. The voice is just right. “It’s Tony.”
Steve and Tony, the only others left in the room, were bickering about the film, and didn’t notice James and Natasha’s conversation in the slightest. Tony, who secretly loved the earnestness and drama of musicals, claimed to hate it. Steve, who was secretly bored by the songs, underwhelmed by the set, and taking only the occasional interest when there was a particularly good dance routine, claimed that Tony was just being negative because it didn’t have any robots or explosions in it.
“Want to try again?” Natasha asked.
I plead the 5th
The harder he strikes, the sooner this will all be over. Tony fires every repulsor he’s got, dealing 965 damage to the target, plus 69 for each Team Iron Man Escalation tile on the board. If the target is a member of Team Cap, deals 78 damage per tile. If the target is Captain America himself, deals 102 per tile.
Brickenn takes Klithua in his arms, the first time he’s touched her voluntarily. His blood, ruby-red, mingles with hers, bone-white.
Steve tries to return his attention to his notes for the essay he has to write for their class on 20th Century Germany and the Unification of Europe, but his eyes keeps finding their way back to Tony.
And, y’know, otherwise?
“Thanks,” Tony says, and forgets what they were arguing about.
Steve lifts his hand to the back of Tony’s head. The undersuit instantly dissolves from Tony’s neck up. Steve tugs off his other glove with his teeth and combs Tony’s hair between his fingers.
Repulsor Blasts (Red)
“Tony.” Steve’s tone of voice, at least, didn’t lie.
Satisfied with Tony’s work, the creature stands aside to let Tony pass. Tony hands over an apple and, in answer, is nudged toward one of the pathways ahead. The way from there is much the same as before, if perhaps less winding. The rounded walls of the passage glisten with moisture and pulse gently, and slope distinctly downward.
The fight is over quickly. They must have orders not to shoot, because they don’t even draw their guns. In a different time and place, Tony could use that to win, or at least escape. But he’s drained. He just learned that Steve, the best of all of them, is gone, and Tony’s been sleeping with the monster who replaced him.
“Wake up, old man,” Tony says, and his smile lights his eyes so bright and blue that Steve forgets for a moment to hate himself and everything that’s about to happen.
“S’alright, for a Scottish song.”
Doom crouches down beside them. Steve tenses.
“So, great work on that ass, then,” Parker agrees. “Everything’s on track.”
Natasha raised an eyebrow. “Call me a ‘girl’ again and
In retrospect?
I didn’t write these riddles. And I think Tony’s last one is more of a logic puzzle. But his opponent accepted it, and I think that’s what counts.
Steve grins and kicks off, catching briefly on a vertical wall to launch himself off it. In moments he’s close enough to grab Tony by the ankle—which he does, or moves to do, but then repulsors flare and Tony is soaring away, calling, “Catch me if you can, old man!”
That part of it doesn’t seem to have sunk in for Tony, yet. To him this is still a wonderland, a dream come true. Literally, probably. Steve’s dreams—well, Tony’s here, and there the similarity ends to the most recent and vivid dream he can remember. At any rate, Steve is going to let Tony live his dream, try to enjoy how much Tony is enjoying it, and put off reminding him what this means for them.
“What are you doing here, Tony?” Steve's voice sounds clearer than his head feels. Whatever hit he took, it must’ve been a big one, for him to still feel it like this.
Tony makes a face. “Well, yeah, I mean. There’s a hunk of metal embedded in my chest, Cap. It isn’t exactly comfortable.” He starts, as if something’s just occurred to him. “It’s not a big deal, though, I mean, I’m fine to fight, obviously I am, I’ve done it a ton of times, I just meant—”
Thirty-six hours before Dr. Strange was scheduled to return to his home dimension, Steve turned to Tony and said, “Wait, so, do you know where Dr. Suresh went?”
Wormseed’s eyes are light blue, like they’ve been left out in the sun too long and all the color has faded out of them. They lock on Tony’s now and Wormseed says, “You think your sheriff friend—”
Bucky is there when Steve and his team arrive. “What the hell are you doing, Barnes?” Maria yells when she sees him. Bucky slips away once it’s clear that Zola has escaped, and Lukin, if he had even visited recently, is absent as well.
And now they’re in—a very stylish cruise liner? The room is huge and there are no windows, but it has the sleek, efficient curves Steve associates with boats and submarines. Not that there would be any reason for such a big, mostly empty room like this on a submarine.
More importantly, Wormseed, Mugwort, and Slovenwood are gone; Tony’s liquid silver and arcane words have twisted and unmade them into nothing but crimson sand that spills into the desert like blooms of a claret cup cactus. Doom's been knocked to the ground, slowly pushing himself upright as if it pains him. The ground is strewn with strands of metal like ocean waves frozen solid and made miniature.
The rest of their company pass away one by one, until the ship is crewed only by the pair of them—he muted and solitary in his bereavement, she obscured by her own lies and reaching for him nonetheless. He reluctantly reveals memories at each of their stops—New Laurentia, the vaniium refinery on Mauti III, Citadel of Meni on Charybdis Prime, Draconis IV, the ice hive of Petbe.
so not doombots or a.i.m.bots then
Is Tony speaking that softly too?
“I know.”
And then it’s time for desperate measures.
Tony could ask Red Wolf the same question, though he doesn’t; Steve’s star suits him. “My coffin.”
“Better than me, but that… it depends. He’d probably need a photostatic veil. What kind of role?”
SO try not to go there
“Sure don’t,” Missus Knight agrees. In altogether another tone of voice, she says, “You see Mister Stark, you tell ‘im I’ve made some improvements to the arm.” She taps at her mechanical prosthetic with her flesh hand. “Off you go now, Sheriff. I don’t want any of that trouble showing its face here, nor the rumors we’ll be hearin’ about if you’re seen goin’ in and out of my home on your lonesome.”
