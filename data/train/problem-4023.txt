Cas nods miserably. “They took them,” he says. “Before they took me to that room and...” He closes his eyes, turning his face away.
“No worries. I’ll stay here, have a few more drinks. Enjoy the view.” Dean gives him a small smile, laces their hands together and squeezes Cas’s before letting go. “You’ve got my number.”
What is his place of inner peace? He’s not sure he knows anymore. Before Sam died, Cas liked to imagine them all together, his family — Sam, Ann Marie and the kids — on one of their beach vacations, tanned and happy and monster-free. Since Sam died he’s struggled to think of any memory that doesn’t feel tainted. Broken.
“Fuck!” Dean curses and Cas concurs, using the door frame to leverage his weight as he pulls them both upright.
Dean’s bloodshot, confused eyes focus on Cas for only a moment before Michael is standing in front of him, blocking Dean’s view of the destruction surrounding him.
The room falls into silence. Cas sits next to Andrew, chest heaving, eyes shut tight, and Dean looks to Sam and Eileen for help but they seem just as stunned as he is. Then Cas suddenly bends over, gasping, tears leaking out of the corner of his eyes.
The words fall like a guillotine, severing that tension and spilling out Dean’s blood-red, disappointed anger in a rush.
They were together for a month. It might as well have been a year in Dean’s eyes. Sleeping in her bed almost every night, scrounging up real work as a bartender, getting to know her friggin’ neighbors — it was an almost dreamlike reprieve from his previous life of motel rooms, monsters, and one-night stands.
The voice isn’t Anna’s, and the figure in the dark doorway isn’t Anna, either. Dean steps into the room. He looks around, takes in Cas’s massive California king, the marble floors and thick bearskin rug, the gilded chaise lounge that’s likely worth more than his studio apartment. Cas’s eyes start to prickle. He wants to cry. He’s embarrassed, ashamed, angry and heartbroken, and all those feelings are at war.
Dean pushes Cas’s hair around, admiring the way it springs back up when he tries to push it flat. “Mmmhmm?”
not straight,” she says simply, nodding to the bouncer as he holds open the door to the gold-gilded elevator. “I thought you’d know.”
Dean’s mouth opens and closes, and Cas can see the gears in his head turning as he processes Cas’s admission. Cas could explain, should explain —
He holds the business card Lisa handed him up slightly so it catches the light from the hotel sign as they pull into the parking lot. It’s plain. It has Lisa’s name, her cell phone number, the address of the gym she works at, somewhere in Michigan. Cas turns it over.
“You could do it?” he suggests meekly, and Anna laughs even harder. He’s lost track of the number of times he’s tried to get her back in the field. This is her reaction every time.
Mary looks at her sons — Sam, calm and composed, so willing to make compromises for the people he loves, and Dean, a little more raw and bruised, clearly afraid of her answer. And she knows what she needs to do.
Dean knocks his boot against the side of the hull, a nervous fidget. “It’s not like I knew who you were.”
“Are you all right? What were you thinking about?” Cas asks, and Dean wishes the burr of his voice weren’t so comforting. Wishes it were saying other things, not trying to convince him to open up about his myriad of personal issues.
Cas said he’s here to stay. Dean knows he needs to take him at his word. He’s trusted Cas with his life these past weeks. Time to trust him with his heart.
“Sorry,” he says, sleepy, once the yawn ends. “It was more emotionally taxing to tell you than I thought it would be. But I — I needed you to know it had nothing to do with you, and if I could take everything back I would call you myself, liability be damned.”
“Dean, Dean.” Seth sighs, and the static burst it causes across the line grates in Dean’s ear. “I’m really just letting you know as a courtesy. I don’t take orders from you.”
Bobby goes home early, and Cas doesn’t tease him for it. The old man keeps most of his cards pressed tightly against his chest, and today he revealed his whole hand. Bobby meant well by it, but it still must feel a little like losing for a man who prides himself on his sharp, unflappable exterior.
The next half hour feels like swimming underwater, every motion blurred and out of focus. Dean can’t even appreciate Cas changing, or listen to the phone calls he’s making as they drive, or feel his own legs as he walks through the automatic doors of the hospital’s main entrance. Every thought in his mind is
“I don’t—” He doesn’t have any words left. His mouth is filling with blood. He closes his eyes against the blinding light surrounding him. The other person is screaming, but he can’t hear them. He hears nothing but the ringing.
“Uh, well,” he says, trying and failing to think of how to describe the complex mechanics of grace to a being who lives on a singular plane. “Sometimes the injury is simply too great.”
Dean blinks at him, and Cas blushes. “It’s— It’s stupid, but when I was a kid and I got upset my older sister used to make me put my head in her lap and she’d rub my head. It helped me sleep… I just thought maybe you’d need some sleep, too, because I know last night was a lot and— I’m being weird, aren’t I?”
Dagon’s screams are ferocious and never ending, and Cas watches the smoke around her dissipate as Hellfire’s power courses through it. Her human form is coming back into view as the Corruption flails around her, Dagon desperately trying to call it back in a vain attempt to save herself. She’s doubled over with her hands grasping at her cheeks, pulling down her lower eyelids to show the redness around her pupils as her blood vessels burst, her mouth locked open as the fire let loose by Hellfire pushes her own ruined Corruption back inside her body and consumes her.
Careful to avoid looking directly at James’ battered face, Sam checks on Dean in the rearview mirror. His brother still clings to James, looking down at him almost tenderly. Sam’s never seen Dean look at anyone like that. It worries him, this change in Dean, this affection that sprang up overnight for a man they should dislike just on principle.
“Hello,” he says to no one. The mountains all had Enochian names, once, but it’s been so long and he’s been through so much he can’t remember what they were. He doesn’t know what their new names are.
“Find anything?” he asks. Dean, clearly focused more on Lisa than Cas, swallows at the sight of her and shakes his head mutely. He walks over to stand between them, stepping back to face Cas and Lisa as they lean against the car.
But Lucifer was an archangel. Castiel is a seraph with only a glimmer of grace and a love for Dean Winchester.
“The battery died,” Cas repeats, more dollar signs floating in the air around him. He’s upset enough at the thought of an additional unplanned expense he forgets to be offended that Garth doesn’t think he knows how to jumpstart a battery. “Yeah, Dean’s in the kitchen with Bobby.”
“Mmm?” Cas mumbles, stretching and causing more papers to fall to the floor. He blinks languidly, eyes bleary and hair mussed. “Dean?”
“If you guys are going to diss me the entire time I’ll just hang up,” Sam says in his most long-suffering voice, but Dean knows he’s still signing out the conversation to Eileen because she laughs again.
He’s not sure why he’s here, either. He’s gathered that this branch of the Men of Letters detests anything non-human, so perhaps it was only a matter of time before they turned on him. He hadn’t expected them to use Mary to get him here, but, then again, this is not the first time he's been blindsided by someone’s deceptive kindness.
“Yes.” Cas puts the menu away so he won’t tear it up anymore, smiling at the waitress who’s materialized to take their order. He gets an omelette, though he knows he won’t enjoy it. Once she’s gone, he continues, “He wants to make amends.”
Cas wants to ask Dean more questions about himself. After all, he’s bared his soul to this man and yet Dean himself is still shrouded in mystery. The scars, the foreign travel, his newfound career — Cas wants to know about all of it. But he remembers the look on Dean’s face when he caught Cas staring at the lines criss-crossing his chest and arms. It was near panic. What could be so terrible in Dean’s past he feels he has to hide it from Cas of all people? Wouldn’t he understand better than most what pain and trauma do to a person?
Charlie and Benny exchange a loaded look. They think he’s losing his control. After he killed Dagon, after he blasted Cas and the others away, he saw Charlie staring at him from across the beach. She didn’t need to take her helmet off for Dean to picture the disappointment on her face.
The elevator opens and Leahy walks out at a fast clip, leaving Jody and Cas to follow behind her. A nurse, seeing three people in uniform walking around outside of visiting hours, points to a door at the end of the hall without a word. As they approach the closed door, Cas rubs his sweaty palms on the legs of his pants.
“Promise me that whatever it is it’s not something stupid. Not something you shouldn’t be doing alone.” He looks back up at Cas, who nods solemnly. “And you will tell me eventually, right?”
“No, he’s staying with a friend. I promise I’ll fill you in as much as I can as soon as you get here. He’s really okay, Mary. He’s really alive.”
“Ma,” he whispers, and in two long strides she’s in his arms and they’re both falling to the floor, on their knees and holding each other tight, Dean’s coffee cup dropped and promptly forgotten. She sobs into his shoulder and Dean rocks her, pressing kisses into her gray hair. “I’ve got you. I’m okay. I’m okay.”
Dean picks at his sandwich, wondering when they’re going to eat through Andrew’s food and need to go out for more. Eileen still looks tired, though she’s happier now that Sam and Dean have finally stepped up to help care for Cas. She leans over and rests her head on Sam’s shoulder, looking at his laptop with him.
“We know that. It won’t change how Dean feels.” Cas thinks of how tense Dean’s been for the last week, wound so tight it looked like the faintest breeze could cause him to snap. He’ll be worse now. “I don’t know what to say to him.”
Cas pauses at the street corner and looks back over his shoulder at the motel. The door to their room remains closed, the Impala sitting snug in her tight spot between two much less well-cared-for cars. Dean isn’t coming after him to apologize.
And he realizes they’re being baited. “Wait—” he starts, but Dean spins the chamber and pulls the trigger. Even Alastair flinches.
Not that long ago, Cas had felt fairly certain Dean didn’t care for him much at all. He reminds himself for the thousandth time to feel grateful for all he has, for the relationship he has with Dean as it stands, to not push for anything more.
“This wouldn’t be our first fight,” Cas points out. “And she’s recently experienced a revival, Dean.”
Dean looks at the remainder of his sandwich, almost tempted to give it to James, he looks so small and sad.
“All right, let’s go up top.” Dean scans the symbol they’ve painted, a circle with a star in it. He rolls his eyes again. “Pentagrams? Really, Krissy? So basic.”
He walks down the closed side of the highway, gun drawn, and the light disappears again. Dean steps off the roadway and into the gravel, moving through the equipment scattered along the side of the road and looking for it.
But Dean keeps looking. Entering the room where he found Cas is difficult, and he tries to keep his eyes away from the massive bloodstain in the center of the floor. When he pushes open the closet door it’s like he can see Cas there for a second, broken and bleeding out on the ground. Dean closes his eyes and counts to ten to get together. When he opens them, there’s nothing there except more dried blood.
The rest of the night passes in a blur. Dean doesn’t wake up, and Cas lets him sleep. Dr. Tran said he might find himself exhausted in the days following his release, and Cas doesn’t have it in him to drag Dean out of bed and away from his needed rest, not even for dinner. He feeds Gracie and then himself, cleans her litter box and drags around her pet mouse, and sweeps the hall and living area free of cat hair. Then Cas retreats to his room and reads until lights out, head hitting the pillow with Dean on his mind.
Dean walks over to the Braedens, feeling his heart pound with a completely different fear than the one he felt when they were carrying Cas back to the car. This is it. This is likely the last time he’ll ever see them, and he has no clue what to say.
“You were angry, I know,” Cas rushes in. “We didn’t part well, after Sam and the cage and the archangels. I didn’t perceive the complications my departure would cause at the time. But you didn’t have to pray directly for me to sense when you were, um, longing. For me.”
Sam doesn’t want to think about the rest. How terrified Dean looked as he choked out his goodbyes (“Take care of yourself, please. Go have a real life for me, Sammy. Find a girl or something, go back to school. Live for you. And tell Cas I’m sorry. Jesus, I’m so sorry. Take care of him. You gotta take care of Cas for me. Take care of each other, and take care of my baby”). How Sam begged Dean to just let them do the spell. How Death watched it all, an unreadable, blank look on his face.
“There’s no grave,” she says, and her voice shakes, “because he might still be out there. But sometimes I need a place where I feel like I can say hello to him.”
“Cas,” Dean repeats, and he shakes Cas a little harder. He starts, halfway sitting up before his cuts make themselves known and he slides back down onto the bed.
“Okay,” Dean says, putting the Volvo into park. “We can’t just drive in, guns blazing, because we’ve only got one gun. We can’t sneak in because you can’t walk that far, and we can’t just waltz up because they’ll kill us both.” He sighs. This really seemed like a good idea — no, never a
“Cas, do you —,” Dean starts, then stops. His phone is ringing. Dean pulls it out of his pocket and groans. “It’s goddamn Deputy Mouthy.” He levels Cas with a stern gaze. “We are not done talking about this.”
And they do. They talk about when they can see each other next (a week and three days from now), whether
He tenses, ready to go after Balthazar and demand an apology, but Anna stops him with a gentle hand on his arm. “Don’t. He’s been in a real mode lately. It’s not worth the fight.”
Dean doesn’t have a good response to that. The first thing that comes to his mind is, “I think we just need to leave because it makes me feel bad to see her,” but that sounds like something a ten-year-old would say. And then Sam will say, “Dean, people are dying.” And Dean will feel guilty and selfish, and Cas will still be silently alternating between looking at his hands and then back at the brothers with that wide, fearful gaze that indicates his own pure panic.
“That’s funny, because I have a great memory — as you may recall from the last time we saw each other in court, when my attention to detail put your client in prison.” Dean keeps his voice even, icy. “And I recall you telling me my friendship with Cas was over, ‘effective immediately,’ that he did not want to speak to me or see me, and I should leave him alone or you’d be tempted to file a restraining order. But Cas didn’t know about any of that. When I asked him why he sicced his guard dog on me, he said he told you to tell me the truth. So. What’s the truth?”
Cas is getting so heated he forgets only minutes ago he’d worried Dean was right about the Shurley Foundation board misappropriating funds. “Why the hell did you leave me your number?”
Dean sees her for the first time in nearly six years in some no-name town in Idaho, and it’s panic at first sight.
“It worked much better than I hoped. As it turns out, the grace of the other angels he’d imbibed didn’t take to him so well. It must have emerged to fight against him, because that explosion was caused by far more than the power of one seraph.” He pauses. “In the end his greed is what really killed him.”
The sea cave entrance is easy to find with Anna’s map, though Cas can see how people would miss it from the ocean. It’s hidden behind a foreboding clump of rocks that seem too close together to navigate around. They manage anyway, anchoring the boat just outside of the rocks and swimming in toward the small, waterlogged beach in front of the cave before high tide hits.
He goes through the motions of helping Cas wrap his feet and take his painkillers, mind on that flash of a memory, disturbing in its realism. For a second Dean really felt like he was with Cas in the bunker, and now he can’t get the fear in Cas’s eyes out of his head.
“Mary,” a voice says from behind them, and she pulls back reluctantly, hands still on his shoulders. “Could I have a turn?”
There’s something familiar about this storm, though — the way it sprang up so suddenly, the way it’s building and building, stretching from Nebraska down into Kansas, the way it seems to hover in place over the Midwest. Sam feels like he saw something like this once, years ago, on a smaller scale, but he’s not sure if he’s forgetting something or if this is just deja vu.
There’s a particular tale he especially enjoys, one he asks Cas to repeat one day after they’ve finished season one of
“I come to ask for your help, brother,” he says softly. “I even rescued these two from the clutches of demons as a sign of goodwill from Heaven.” He glances briefly over his shoulder at Sam and Eileen. Sam reaches for his wife’s hand and tugs her closer to the porch, wanting to be near his brother if this meeting goes south.
“Why’d you say the feds are interested in this case again?” Dawes asks, with a slight drawl that definitely doesn’t come from growing up in Idaho. Texas, if Dean had to guess.
They arrive home at dusk. Gracie is walking along the ledge of the living room window, her tiny body pressed between the blinds and the glass, meowing at them in outrage. She hates being left home alone all day. “I’m coming, I’m coming,” Cas mutters, fumbling with his keys at the door. He hears Dean come up the porch steps behind him, lugging the cooler in his arms. Gracie continues to whine.
The tree trunk starts to crack as Lucifer squeezes it, grace beginning to seep out, running like sap to the ground where it pools together — pulsing, waiting. Dean hears Eileen whisper, “Sam,” frantic and strangled. Cas stares at the grace, surely about to do something stupid enough to match Sam.
So Dean is also upset because he feels it would be wrong for him to pursue Lisa now. That makes sense, Cas supposes, but it still hurts him that Dean’s thought about it at all, even though he knows it’s a ridiculous thing to hope Dean wouldn’t still love her. She and Ben meant so much to him in a time in Dean’s life when he really needed someone, needed a family.
Sam runs to the bathroom to throw up the bottle of vodka he’d chased with shots of tequila the night before. When he goes back to the room, he’s relieved to note it’s empty. There had been a woman he only vaguely recalls at the bar last night, leaning into his space, breasts proudly on display, but at least she was smart enough to not follow him here and try to sleep with him.
Cas nods solemnly in understanding. Dean turns off the safety and cocks the gun, keeping the muzzle just beneath the window, out of eyesight.
There are several moments of awkward silence before a waiter stops by to take drink orders and set a basket of breadsticks down on the table. Dean is the only one who grabs one, biting into it immediately.
He watches his brother practically sprint out of the room, a hollow ache in his chest. Dean doesn’t know what the hell is going on here, but then again, why should he be surprised? Of course Cas and Sam want some time away from him. He’s overbearing and needy.
“It doesn’t look too bad. Do you know if Andrew had a heating pad?” Cas shakes his head. “Well, I think a warm washcloth will do in a pinch. I can bring one back in, and you’ll need to keep it pressed to that area. What else do we need to take care of?”
happening around here, not to give me some spook story and tell me to call off a multi-million dollar job.”
of a small explosion leaves both James and Dean curled around each other on the ground as the after-shock dies away.
“Maybe Dagon will, then.” Cas doubts it, though. She’s not interested in him right now. She made it clear the Demons are back to take on Hellfire, and he’s not even the real Halo to them. Dagon will hold her knowledge of his identity over his head as a sort of bargaining chip, the way Azazel tried to with Chuck before his father murdered him. “I just— I can’t.”
“But he also wrecked our lives. He gave Dean this inferiority complex that’s about the size of the Grand Canyon, made him feel like he was never good enough or smart enough. There were a few times when Dean was literally dying and Dad didn’t act like he gave a shit, and... Dean was probably the most scared of Dad. He’d hardly ever cross him unless Dad turned on me. He still talks about him like a solider talking about a commanding officer, not a son talking about his father.”
Dean rolls them, pinning Cas beneath him. He looks at the will-o’-the-wisp, watches it sweep up stray branches and pull up clumps of grass as it calls to Cas and attempts to immobilize him. And he knows what he needs to do.
There’s no way Sam can speak around the lump in his throat, so he nods jerkily. Cas isn’t really paying attention to him, though. He looks thoughtful as he gazes down at the jacket in his lap.
As the first heaving sob wracks his body, a large, trembling hand sets itself on his shoulder blade, rubbing gently. Dean falls apart, face to the floor, while another Castiel tries to hold him up.
“Well if you’re so above all this, why are you here?” he asks, miffed. Now he’s taken note of Zorro’s suit, and it’s cheap and ill-fitting. The Zorro mask probably is a literal Zorro mask from an old Halloween costume. “Come to think of it, how did you get on the list? It’s a $1,500 ticket.”
He drums his fingers on the table as he stands, considering. “But he doesn’t know Cas Novak is after him.”
"I loved it,” Cas says earnestly, small smile growing slightly wider. Fonder. “I heard you in every verse.”
Cas waits in the hallway, pacing a short path between Dean’s door and the next room. He doesn’t feel the same urgent sense of danger Dean does, but then again, he doesn’t know what Dean knows. Cas meant what he said — he can take care of himself — but he worries over whether he can take care of Dean when he doesn’t know who or what he’s protecting Dean from.
”You don’t have to anymore.” He hugs Dean back fiercely, holding him in the way he always wants to but never seems to be allowed to. “This is not real, Dean. I’m real. I’m alive. I came back to you.”
“Okay,” Dean sounds ragged, like maybe he’s been crying. Sam doesn’t understand his sudden, intense attachment to James Novak, but he does understand the fear of knowing someone you care about is in danger, just outside of your reach. “Okay, I’m at that abandoned fruit stand.”
Bobby says, “My wife made the most incredible pies.” His voice is softer than Dean’s ever heard it, light and fond. “She’d go crazy on Thanksgiving. Pumpkin, apple, pecan, blueberry, chocolate. Even though it was just the two of us and she’d end up giving most of them away to the neighbors, she’d spend all day baking up a storm. Said it relaxed her.” Bobby coughs, but he can’t hide the thickness of his voice. He starts picking at his quesadilla, done talking.
“You could have just told me your name the other night, you know,” Cas says. He’s not feeling charitable right now, even if the sound of Dean’s voice sends a pleasant shiver down his spine. “Instead of leaving a note I might not find and bashing my family’s charity live on television in front of all of Purgatory.”
“Yes,” Cas says. Through the window, a bird sweeps across the yard, headed out toward the water on swift wings. “I suppose so.”
Pa forces the door open with a bang, and Dean has to scramble to get out of the way or be slammed into the wall. He crawls backward on his hands and feet to the middle of the room. Pa looms over him, face expressionless. But Dean can see the anger in his eyes, knows it doesn’t bode well for him.
Bones make a cracking, splitting sound when they break. Dean knows this. He’s broken many — his own and others’. He’s taken lives before, felt the splintering of the structures that hold a human body together, watched the flesh rupture and blood flow. He’s never heard a more satisfying sound than the grunts of pain Alastair lets out before he falls silent, never been happier to hear the crack of bone turn into the sound of mush as Steve bashes Alastair’s head in, pounding it like so much meat until it’s unrecognizable.
“Have you ever told Sam he was dead to you?” Cas snaps, sure of the answer. Dean can call him brother all he wants, but at the end of the day, Cas knows what he truly is — expendable. Not like Sam at all.
“Your son’s name is Benjamin James. He loved baseball as a kid. He would do this weird little dance to ‘Born to Be Wild’ whenever it played on the radio. When he was six, he broke his arm after he fell off the monkey bars at school and the scar from the surgery is right here.” Dean points just under his left elbow. “You used to worry he was colorblind, he mismatched his clothes so much.” He laughs faintly. Lisa just stares. “Neither of you can sing worth a damn, but that never stopped you from trying.”
“Look,” Tran takes the glasses hanging from a chain around her neck and puts them on her nose, “I’m not a detective or an ME. I’m an ER surgeon. I can tell you the symptoms, and you work out your conclusions from there. But I can say that although we have our John Doe on the suicide watch that’s standard for hanging victims, I wouldn’t be opposed to a deputy posted outside his room, either.”
Before he can tell her again, the door to his room swings open. Cas lifts his head, expecting to see a nurse come to check on him. Instead he sees Ellen, eyes wild.
Cas squints at him, confused, and moves to stand up. Dean follows suit. They both turn to the spot on the road where the light vanished. Dean doesn’t see any sign it was there at all, but Cas abruptly reaches out and grabs his hand, pointing to the center of the road.
“Mom,” Sam says, and he at least has the grace to appear chagrined, “no one blames you.” Dean doesn’t miss the way his brother’s eyes dart to him for a second, as if daring Dean to challenge him on that. “We just need to talk about….everything. This can’t be a rehash of my childhood. I’m not doing this brushing-shit-under-the-rug shtick for another decade.” He looks at Dean straight on for the first time since they were introduced at the station. “Look, you don’t know us at all, and this is a fucked up situation. But I think it’s better for everyone if we just get everything out in the open now and stop talking about cars and work and food. We’ve all been through hell, and pretending like you’re back and everything is fine now is just putting a bandaid on a bullet wound.”
On the last night Claire and Jody spend with them, they order pizza, which Claire and Sam pick up to bring to the bunker. Dean methodically picks his slice of cheese apart while Sam and Jody talk about how Alex is doing at nursing school, ignoring the occasional scoff from Claire. Jack sits between Sam and Dean, too afraid of the angry blonde sitting across from him to say much, but he eats half a pizza by himself in about two minutes, sauce and a pleased smile on his face.
“Yeah, and I investigate petty theft, not the supernatural. But you’re the one with the fucking notebook!”
Unfortunately, Lydia was the best lead they had. Sam wants to drive straight to Kuna, where Lacey Parks’ killer resides in prison, to see if the guy really is as innocent as he’s claimed for the past eight years.
“It’s different,” Cas says, and Bobby’s not the only one he wants to convince. “This isn’t the same situation in the slightest.”
“And you’re going to solve world hunger and live in a tent in the wilderness, yes, I’ve heard it all already.” But Balthazar smiles, just slightly. “I do kind of love it, just thinking of what Chuck’s reaction would have been. I bet he’s rolling in his grave right now. Halo retiring, his company disbanding, his money disbursed to a bunch of poor people while I still get to keep my allowance.” Cas gives him the stink eye. “Hey, I’m saying it’s brilliant! If it were up to him, he’d have it horded forever, and I would get none of it. So, cheers.” Balth punches him on the shoulder. “You’re a self-righteous lout sometimes, but you’re also a better man than him, Cassie.”
Not Mom, Mary. Mom is the ghost who cut the crusts off his sandwiches and tucked him into bed at night, the woman who loved her sons more than anything, who had a beloved husband and a beautiful home and a chance at a life without monsters. That woman died three decades ago.
That’s all. Big and wonderful and scary, and no matter what happens between Dean and Cas tonight, there will still be a cloud over them because of the highway and the accidents and Dean’s lost job and friends and nearly a year spent angry and apart. Dean wipes the condensation off the bathroom mirror and stares at his gaunt face.
Dean jolts up with a gasp, head and heart pounding, and when he spots Sam and Eileen next to him, alive and stunned as well, his next thought is
“Why would he say that?” Dean asks, not wanting to push Cas too much, but struggling to understand. “How did he know which angel you were; how could he know about any of your ‘crimes?’”
“You ordered it online?” Dean’s impressed. He’s never shopped online, wouldn’t know how to. They don’t keep personal computers at the compound. Pa doesn’t trust new technology. “Where… How did you get a credit card? And where did you send it?”
Dean wishes he could shove the words back into his mouth the moment he says them. Gwen’s face falls, and she stares at him like she’s never seen him before. Like he’s someone she doesn’t even know.
The moon and stars are hidden behind clouds tonight, and the road is empty save for the occasional trucker rolling up to one of the stoplights and waiting their turn to move on. The woods seem darker than usual, more menacing — the branches of the trees twisting down toward Dean as if to ensnare him, the unblinking animal eyes following him. If he felt afraid before, it is nothing compared to walking into the woods, armed with a handgun and a flashlight, knowing what might await him.
“You know what Cas means to us, and you...” Sam doesn’t want to talk about it. Sometimes he still looks at Cas and sees his bruised, battered face, and he feels nothing but gut-wrenching guilt and blinding rage. “You don’t know how family works.”
“Dean,” Sam says again, with infinite patience that is clearly beginning to wear thin. “How else were we going to get rid of him?”
He’s got a list of potential fairy expulsion spells written down, and he bought a one-pound bag of salt at Wal-Mart earlier today. Maybe he’ll go out to Highway 9 and sprinkle salt everywhere for the rest of his life. It would be better than doing nothing.
Dean sucks his lips in between his teeth and scrunches his eyes up in an effort to hold back a fresh onslaught of tears. Claire cries silently, her tears dripping down her cheeks and drying before they reach her jaw, an angry scowl on her face.
Sam’s heard the whispers, muttered by everyone from close friends to the nurses. “It’s a pity,” they all say, or some variation thereof. “He’s not even that old.”
There’s a wrenching sensation in Dean’s chest, and it’s nothing like the gentle pull of Cas’s grace drawing him to it. No, this is like someone has clawed through his rib cage and latched onto his heart, grabbing it and twisting, hard.
Dean lifts his head from his hands just enough so his mouth isn’t pressed into his palms, but Cas still can’t see his face clearly.
Cas spent last night looking up basic signs, and he recognizes the forceful gesture Dean makes as a “no,” every bit as pointed as the “no” he wrote with his thumb on Cas’s palm.
Jody says, “You know what I mean. And I’m asking as a friend, not as someone who’s looked into Dean’s case.” Silence. Cas isn’t sure he can speak. He watches Dean, his legs twitching under the thin throw blanket, brow furrowed even in sleep. He wants to hang up and walk over there, give Dean another blanket, take all his burdens away from him.
Dean’s exhausted — mentally, physically and emotionally — and he wishes he could’ve stayed at Cas’s forever.
The sun is directly overhead when the coffin is finally lowered, and Cas tries to concentrate on the sweat pooling down his back to keep his mind off the fact that his best friend is about to be swallowed by the earth, that Sam’s family has lost a husband and a father. They all cry, if quietly. Even Winchesters break eventually.
“To Sam, I think talking about Dean meant we were upset — we’d bring him up when Sam complained about not being allowed to do normal kid things, and Sam came to associate his brother with rules and sadness and fear instead of love,” Mary says. “It didn’t help that John and I were divorced at the time, and he figured out once he was old enough that the reason why we weren't together anymore was because our marriage fell apart after we lost Dean.”
Cas lets loose a primal and deafening yell as he releases his Grace. It bursts from him like a geyser, flooding the smoky air and breaking every pane of unbroken glass left in the hallway. The fire is flung back against the walls and ceiling as his Grace barrels down the center of the hallway, a bluish glow emanating from his hands and mouth and swallowing everything in its path.
Cas is sorely tempted to say “no” and be done with this conversation. “What is it?” He creeps down to the edge of the hallway while he waits for Jody to respond, sticking his head into the living room and checking on Dean. He’s still sleeping in the glow of the television light.
Dean rubs at his eyes, angry he’s started crying but too upset to stop. “I still got no clue what he was trying to tell me.”
Cas watches them from the doorway, silent, heart wrapped in a coil that’s sure to spring loose at any second now, taking the whole organ with it, plunged out of his chest and into the open air.
“I’m gonna go check the perimeter,” Dean says, and before Cas can argue or insist he accompany him, Dean is stomping through the brush at the edge of the campsite and into the woods.
Jack hobbles around the massive island, heading for the walk-in freezer. Dean stares at Cas with eyes screaming
”Bring me back?” Young Dean says, and for a moment he flickers — Cas’s Dean stands before him, brow wrinkled, eyes lost — and then he’s back to this past version of himself. “Sam’s with you?”
His nose smarts, his head aches and he feels the imprint of Cas on his lips. Dean’s not in a position to think beyond this second.
“I can’t believe I didn’t see it before,” says a voice from within the storm. It’s Dagon’s voice, but deeper, layered as if there are a hundred voices speaking at once. The Corruption speaking through her.
“Um,” Sam says, while Cas says, “Partially, yes.” Dean hears them shuffling behind him, likely communicating to each other with hand gestures and eye movements as they settle on some version of this story they think will make him less pissed. Dean keeps his eyes on his so-called mother, who’s still cradling the sobbing woman but looking directly at him. She looks sad. He very valiantly tries not to care.
“Okay,” Anna says, clapping her hands together as Cas takes a seat. She’s still trying to hold them all together even now. Cas lets her try because he loves her. He wishes they could all get along, make her happy. “Cas, what happened in there after I lost you?”
“Ben. His name is Ben. Anyway, I just wondered if, in your professional opinion, maybe I should go ahead and go get him? Just in case there is someone out there in the woods or something... Although he’ll probably hate me for it. He’s seventeen, and I’m just so embarrassing to him.”
“Are you hurt?” he demands, pulling her into his arms. Claire presses her head into his chest, and he feels something wet through his shirt. She’s crying. “Claire!”
Dean waits until he’s sure his husband is gone, tucked safely in their bed in the room just down the hall from the kids’. Then he opens the trunk.
Dean’s breath stutters. Henriksen glances up at him before he says, “Hi Mary. Sorry to call so early.”
Sam had explained to the kid on the way back to the car that monsters are real and that their job is to hunt them. Lisa had simply affirmed that they’d already told her the truth behind the FBI ruse. She didn’t mention the mind-wiping, which Dean took to mean she’s sticking to the original plan. Ben isn’t going to find out who Dean really is.
Anna holds up a hand to silence Balthazar’s retort. “It’s possible Azazel brought him back for some reason. We know he had the ability.” She takes a deep breath, centering herself. “But it doesn’t matter now. He’s alive, and he’s here for revenge.” She turns to Cas. “Tell me you didn’t tell Dean that Chuck is still here.”
“You know, it’s so much easier when you walk into the light like you’re supposed to,” he says. “It keeps me from having to walk through the filthy muck of your world to gather a sacrifice.”
“Do we have a plan for this ass-kicking?” Cas asks an hour later, sitting with his legs hanging out of the open door of the passenger’s seat, watching Dean pump gas. The rain thankfully let up right around the time they left the motel, and now the sky is almost entirely clear. The storm dissolved as fast as it emerged. Dean knows he should be suspicious, but he’s taking all the good he can get right now, and that good includes the sun shining behind Cas as he stares at the wrapped sandwich Dean bought him inside the gas station.
Dean touches the photo, moving it aside to look at the first still again. He furrows his brow, then coughs. “Right,” he says, looking back up and directly at Leahy so she can read his lips. She can’t hear the tremor in his voice, but she blinks in shock.
When he opens the door, she lets a particularly loud screech of displeasure before bolting toward the back bedroom and her food bowl. Probably hearing the yowl from a quarter-mile away, the neighbor’s bloodhound starts howling. Dean drops the cooler onto the porch with a
“We’re not splitting up,” he'd said, jaw twitching. “Not when we don’t know how many of these fuckers we’re dealing with.”
Michael enters the bunker with ease, the angel warding long faded. He teleports to the kitchen, where Castiel sits alone at the table. He glances up, startled, and stands so fast he knocks his chair down.
. Cas was never going to kiss him, never going to follow Dean to his room in the dark. They’d never fall into bed together, never wake up next to each other. Cas thought it was shameful, he thought it was unwise. Cas towered above him — super intelligent professor with a small family fortune beats low-paid detective with a shitty apartment — but at that moment Dean knew how unlikely their friendship was. How it would never go any further.
Dean didn’t see Alastair stab Gabe, but he saw the aftermath. He watched Gabe stumble backwards in pain and shock, clutching at split and shredded skin, holding in his guts with his hands as blood soaked through his shirt. He watched, heart in his throat, as Alastair swung the knife wildly at Steve’s throat, watched Steve duck and bring up a perfectly timed punch to the gut, then a perfectly aimed kick to the groin. Alastair went down, and Dean watched. That was his assignment, this time around — to be the lookout. To watch his tormentor stab his friend and almost slash his husband’s throat.
The pressure holding Dean against the tree relents and he falls to the ground once more, gasping for breath, head throbbing. He rolls onto the dirt, disoriented, looking up just in time to see the girl angel lunge toward James.
A disquieting silence fills the car — not the strange silence of the previous nights when the woods held their breath, but a natural, unsteady silence born of an emotional bomb dropped between two people. Dean feels, oddly enough, almost as frightened and off-balance as he felt when they faced the light.
“What does that mean?” Anna opens her mouth to respond, but Balthazar pops up behind her and puts a stilling hand on her shoulder.
CW for an "on-screen" suicide attempt in this chapter, which I realize might be especially upsetting to some. If you'd prefer not to read it, skip the section titled "8:01 p.m." I'll summarize what happens in the end notes.
“Okay,” Leahy says, and Cas puts his hand on Dean’s knee again. This time he doesn’t pull away. “Good. That’s— Well, not good. But it’s something. Dean, I can’t do much else if I don’t have your cooperation. I can’t find an address for this guy that isn’t an abandoned post office box, and without your testimony none of my digging means anything. So, this is me laying all my cards on the table and asking for the last time — do you want to tell me what happened to you?”
It’s counterproductive, maybe, but it’s the dance they’ve been trapped in for years.  Dean will only ever tell Cas he needs him in the barest of words and gestures, and Cas will always come back, but never in time to satisfy Dean.
That’s pretty much exactly what Dean is afraid of. He isn’t going to admit that out loud, though. He’s not going to sound jealous or insecure, not to Sam. He’s going to be the model of a trusting... partner? No, too work-ish. Lover?
He offers it to Lisa without thinking, and she pulls two pretzels out slowly, her eyes slightly narrowed in a way that reminds Cas of Hannah, too. He doesn’t know why.
He drives through the vast emptiness of Kansas, and the stars unfurling across the night sky remind him somewhat of Heaven. Jack loved the stars.
Cas stares at the pixelated screen, thinks of the older man Jody mentioned, the one who went to the pawn store and the grocery market with Dean. The date on the tape is about a week after Dean’s assault.
The demon leader steps forward, leaning her head to the side in a way that seems totally unlike Cas’s curious head tilt. She waves a hand, and Ronnie lets up the pressure she’d been holding on Eileen, who gasps in relief.
“I thought he was dead,” John says, voice angry and raised, and Dean finally looks up. No one is looking at him anymore. They’re all staring at Mary. She’s gone white in the face, one hand clutching her husband’s with a grip so tight it most be painful. “Mary, you said they were dead!”
Of course. Dean told him these cheap motels “draw johns and hookers like moths to a flame,” but he’d almost forgotten humans constantly have sex without any love involved.
“Ten minutes. I was about to go get Sam…” Cas presses his palm to Dean’s forehead as if checking his temperature. “Dean, you can’t do that. You can’t force it. Wait for Joshua to do it for you.”
“The angels sent a legion in after me. They pulled me out to become a vessel.” He can’t help it if spits out that last sentence angrily. He still hates how Heaven manipulated him and Sam for years, trying to mold the brothers into their perfect puppets for the coming apocalypse. “Uriel and Balthazar were our main contacts. Assholes, both of ‘em. Uriel bit it pretty quickly. Balthazar died in the civil war in Heaven that followed us putting Lucifer and Michael in the cage.”
Balthazar shrugs as if he could care less, but Cas sees through it. “We’re still family. A fucked-up family, but…” His lips quirk, and he nods toward the kids, still practicing. “The next generation might be better.”
Jack’s mother Kelly was ill for a long time before she passed. He sat with her in hospital rooms and chemotherapy halls for months on end, holding her hand while ten-year-old Jack slept in the chair next to her. “You’ll take care of him,” she’d said to Cas with complete faith, faith he didn’t deserve.
Azazel.” The passengers collectively shift at this. They don’t know. Cas made sure no one knew, because Halo doesn’t kill. It’s part of the mystique. And it’s a lie. Chuck ripped Azazel apart, and Cas watched with a relish he never wants to feel again. “For over a decade we’ve been forced to hide on other continents, hitch our rides to lesser criminals. Not anymore. We’ve been invited back in, and Hellfire’s arrival has made it clear this time there’s no
“Option B,” he says, “I make dear Castiel relive that moment again and again — make him relive all his worst moments, the ones involving you, the ones involving the angels, the times he was tortured, the times he was lost and forgotten — until he wants to die. But I’ll never let him.”
He glances behind him. Dean is slumped on the living room couch, wordlessly staring at the unopened box on his lap. Bobby’s standing in the doorway to the kitchen, frowning at them. “I’ll be in in a minute,” Cas tells them, but Dean doesn’t look up. He closes the front door and the screen and takes a seat on the step. After a moment’s hesitation, Leahy sits next to him.
The paper covers a small velvet pouch. Sam feels it, notes something hard inside of it. Something about the weight of the object seems familiar. He looks at Cas, who nervously upturns one end of his mouth in a very slight smile. Sam reaches into the pouch to pull out whatever is inside.
Agent Leahy texts two days later, while Cas is at work. He’s setting up a trifold display on animals native to the Appalachians for an incoming class of third graders when he hears his phone beep.
“That’s unfair,” Jack whispers, his breath hot next to Cas’s face. Cas can’t cringe away in the tight space. “You gave this mission to us, and now you’re taking it away!” Claire nods in agreement.
“I’m sorry,” Cas says, even though he hadn’t known. He’d been there, in Greece hunting down Demons, and Dean had been so close. If only.
She hunts on her off days, meets with Sam in between shifts while she works. He talks about Eileen and she finally feels a faint pulse of happiness in her chest. He skirts around the subject of Dean and she doesn’t know what to say.
“I don’t think I’m going to be able to talk.” Dean looks at the door to Pam’s practice. “I could barely talk to Eileen and she can’t even hear me.”
He’s not sleeping when his door creaks open much later. Dean tries to control his flinch, tries to keep his body still as soft footsteps echo across the floor.
At that thought, he begins walking forward again, crossing the street and starting to put some distance between himself and the Winchesters. That’s what he does, after all — he moves away from them when he’s upset or in trouble, so they won’t see him struggle, all the while wishing that for once they’d ask him to stay in one place, with them. That Dean would ask Cas to stay with him.
He decides to interfere. “He’s spoken to me before. It’s just a sometimes thing. When he’s comfortable.”
There’s something there under the concern in Sam’s voice, in that last question, something Dean can’t quite read. He doesn’t like it.
With a firm shove, Dean sends Cas sliding through the mud in the opposite direction, turning to make a leaping tackle of the figure he can barely see inside the light.
Dean grits his teeth and leans harder into the Continental, putting all of his weight into it. He promised Cas they’d get his car back from The Bend, but he had no idea it would be this much work. His feet slip through the mud in an attempt to gain any sort of traction, and in the driver’s seat Cas continues to press down on the gas pedal.
“Cas!” Sam rushes to him, shakes his shoulder. Cas rolls over, and Sam is surprised to see his eyes and nose are red, though he’s not crying now. Sam’s never seen Cas cry, not in the seven years they've known each other.
“Well, I don’t remember, but you have told me,” she says, and even attempts a small smile. Dean can’t help but smile back, thinks
They stare at each other for so long it’s uncomfortable, and not in the way that makes Sam shift and glance knowingly between them.
“You don’t forget a mother begging a stranger to give her baby back,” Henriksen says. “Or the picture of said baby all over everywhere for months. I could describe to a tee what Dean looked like at age four, and that’s not just because it’s my case. It’s because his face was on the back of milk cartons at my school for years.”
“I still don’t know how I feel about him,” Sam says. “I can’t — He saved our lives, you know? If he hadn’t forced us into hunting we never would have been prepared to do what we had to do in order to save the world.”
Sam pulls out a chair next to Dean, now looking concerned. Dean grimaces at him. He wishes he hadn't asked.
Mama steps into the room and closes the door behind her, then crosses the rug to him. She grabs the amulet, twisting it in her palm as she inspects it from every angle.
Cas wants to say both no and yes. Yes because he would like to put her mind at ease, would like to help Lisa in any small way he can. She deserves that from him. And no because how dare he presume to try and offer this woman any advice or even friendship, and what if that invitation was a flirtation...
His mom. Mary. The perfect figure, dressed in white, who loved him unconditionally in his dreams, the few times he did dream of her.
“They weren’t there,” Leahy says by way of explanation, stopping on the bottom porch stoop. “No one was there. They’d cleaned camp and left. He doesn’t know where they went.”
Eileen signs, just one word, and suddenly Sam feels like he’s in the Impala, driving through another massive, unforeseen downpour.
He exits the car and walks up to her slowly, scanning the playground and the tree line. He senses no one else.
Dean doesn’t remember the last time he hit Sam. He’s done it more times than he’s proud of — a slap to Sam’s shaking hands when he was coming down from the demon blood and trying to claw at his own skin, a punch to the face when he tried to force Dean to talk about Dad’s death. Dean almost punches him again — his shoulder tenses, his fist clenches, and Sam rears back on instinct.
“Well, as, uh, lovely as it’s been to meet you Mrs. Braeden, we probably should get back to discussing our case.”
“Well, unlike you, I happen to like women, too.” Dean can’t believe he made out with this guy, drunk off his ass on his 21st birthday, just before he met Lisa and everything changed. He’s known since high school he was into men, but he never acted on it until this year. Samuel hasn’t explicitly said he
Cas looks at Dean, tired and earnest. “Dean, I cannot tell you how sorry I am. If I had known how you were suffering due to my absence, I would have come back.”
“Now he’s threatening you, so you come to Cas to take him out,” Dean snaps. “Yeah, sounds like angels, all right. Assholes sitting in clouds, letting everyone else do their dirty work. Tell me,
Dean laughs. It’s a light sound, a quick spurt of breath, but it confirms two things Cas already expected — one, Dean isn’t completely mute, and two, he looks beautiful when he laughs. Cas quickly turns back to his hands.
Before, he believed the slow death of his angelic nature to be a curse, a thing to be feared. Dean needed him with full power. Dean wanted his “mojo.” Without it, what would Cas be to the Winchesters? But now, now, Cas can see that what’s most important to Dean is simply that he’s well.
He put this song on Cas’s mixtape, number thirteen of Dean’s Top 13 Zepp Traxx. It had to be the last one, didn’t it? It had to be the final swing in the last inning, two outs, bases loaded.
“I see.” Mills starts to pace, clutching the folder in hand. “Well, it doesn’t make this any less complicated, that’s for sure.”
Silence falls heavy. Sam, who hasn’t said much at all for most of the meal, is the one to break it. “I can’t do this small talk anymore.”
Dean turns to walk back to the Impala, and Cas doesn’t bother to call out “You’re welcome to ride with me,” though he wants to. Cas’s mission is to watch over the Winchesters. He doesn’t want Dean to have to worry, to think he needs to be the one to watch over Cas. Cas is a warrior. He’s used to battle wounds.
“Hey Cas,” she says, face grim. She’s holding two cups of hospital coffee, black and smelling slightly charred. She hands one to him. “My deputy told me about the attempted suicide. Thought you might still be here.”
Dean blinks in shock and the man disappears, leaving nothing behind but Dean’s gun sitting in an empty seat.
“Castiel,” his sibling said, “Our Father need not consult you prior to showering His wrath upon the unrighteous.”
He winks lasciviously, trying to make it all a big joke, but Cas is smiling — softly, seriously — and Dean’s own stupid grins falls a little flat.
are comically wide. It’s clearly his I’m Trying To Communicate How Uncomfortable This Is And Silently Offer You An Out face.
“I’ll sleep when this is over,” he says. Claire tried to get him to sleep last night, too. At least that’s better than trying to get him to talk. The kids are in bed now, but only because Cas promised Claire would get to take any calls from Jody with Jack as remote backup in place of Anna.
Belatedly Dean realizes what he said, and as he attempts to clarify, “Hey, what I meant was —” Cas’s cell phone rings. It’s one of those pre-programmed ringtones, extra annoying because there’s nothing personal behind it, no thought or feeling. Dean’s relieved when Cas reaches for his phone to silence it.
But he can’t deny Dean. So they end up with a large buttered popcorn and two Cokes, sitting on suspiciously sticky seats and watching a film Cas can only generously describe as “silly.” Dean shrugs when Cas asks whether he enjoyed the movie, but he’s smiling, so Cas takes it as a mixed success.
She holds the cigarette a while before speaking, idly watching cars pass by on the highway. Her clenched jaw gives away her nerves.
He enters at the far end of the corridor, illuminated by the moonlight streaming from the large, open windows and the lamps lining the hall. He’s in all black, but there’s no mask this time. Two people step out from the darkness behind him. A man, thick and burly with a dark beard, and a woman, slight with short-cropped red hair a shade brighter than Anna’s. The barista and the librarian. Hellfire’s teammates.
“I—” Cas finds himself at a loss for words. He’s often wished Bobby would retire — for the Bobby’s sanity and his own — but, truth be told, he loves his boss. He wouldn’t know what to do without him.
The last time he was in the hospital it was him in the bed, tubes sticking out of his nose and veins, staring at the ceiling and waiting for Cas to visit. He wonders if he looked as small as Gwen does. She’s asleep, curled on her side, dark hair fanned out on the pillow behind her. His breathe catches in his throat when he sees her, and his heart seems to stop when he turns toward the basinet in the corner of the room and sees his mother.
Jack says, “We know Roman’s been using that tunnel from his warehouse for most of the deliveries, because the MacLeods were talking about how Hellfire cut off the ‘sea route’ and how they’d have to worry about you catching them if they tried to send another shipment to the docks via the streets. Gavin MacLeod made it clear his family is pissed about Hellfire stealing the shipments, and Roman said, ‘Don’t worry, I’ve hired protection for our the rest of our stock.’”
Dean swallows. “Fine,” he manages, though he’s shivering from more than the cold. Eileen is watching him carefully. He signs a hello and she responds in kind, adding, “Victor just texted me. They should be right behind you.”
“I don’t know if I’ll be able to hear you in there,” Anna warns him. “Signal’s getting spotty, and I doubt I can reach you in the ducts. Be careful, okay?”
“Sorry,” Jack says, guilty. “I wanted to talk to you after Sam left, but you were already asleep. I didn’t want to wake you up.”
He turns to leave, mind whirring, and she stops him with a quiet, “Hey, Ranger.” Cas turns, hand on the knob. Jo says, “Take care of him, all right?”
“Well I know that it’s useful to you, me having my powers, and I need to tell you that they... They might not come back this time. I’m practically human.”
“We’re leaving,” she says and also signs, which is sweet of her but her hands still move too fast for him to catch everything. “I’ll be here tomorrow morning with the results and Henriksen if he’s needed. Okay?” She doesn’t wait for him to nod in response. “Try to relax.”
It’s easier, Dean discovers, to be around Jack when they have a common goal to work toward. When Dean feels in control of the situation.
Somehow they end up stumbling down the hallway, drunk off serotonin, Gracie howling behind them. When Cas shuts her outside his bedroom door, Dean raises his eyebrows.
He feels Claire staring at him, but he ignores her. She knows about the Demons as a crime syndicate, but she doesn’t know what they did to him. What they made him watch. What they turned him into.
Eileen hasn’t said anything about Andrew, but Dean feels guilty all the same, looking at the wet sheen in her eyes. She doesn’t blame Cas, but he knows how terrible it feels to come to someone for help, only for them to wind up getting killed because of it. He knows if he turns his head he’d be able to see the small pile of dirt covering the hurried grave he and Sam dug for the doctor. Dean’s stomach turns.
, something Dean’s not really comfortable poking at. “Can we hold off on telling Claire about him? I just — I think we need to check him out more.”
“Yeah, you were.” Dean shrugs with one shoulder. “So Balthazar and I were gonna do that move where you would vault off his knees to do a spin-flip over your opponent, but we didn’t have it down ‘cause I’d never done it before. I ended up not getting high enough to clear you, and instead of just ducking like a normal person, you vaulted me higher in the air by shooting Grace at me. When I landed I broke my wrist.” He wriggles it in front of Cas. “I’ve got a surgery scar because none of you were good enough healers to fix it, and nobody wanted to tell Chuck what happened.”
So Cas knocks Claire off her feet in a whirlwind of Grace, and a moment later he thinks of her and pulls the hurricane back in.
Sam is still looking at her like she’s far more beautiful than a sunrise viewed from atop Mt. Everest, but Cas is tired and would like to go back to the motel. He thought he knew what it meant, to be the third wheel — he was always the backup to Sam and Dean, never quite a complete part of the team — but after spending just under five hours watching Sam awkwardly flirt with Ann Marie, he’s now fully aware of how Dean tried to include Cas any time he was around.
“You know,” he says over the music, “I was getting real sick of that top 40 crap, but this isn’t half bad.”
“I already talked to him, Sam.” Dean pulls out his phone to take a picture of the print. “I’m not as incompetent of a friend as you think I am.”
Dean stares at him, mouth open slightly. “Why does my opinion matter to you?” He sounds stunned, lost. It’s maybe the most sincere Dean’s ever sounded, and they just finished a very sincere conversation.
He sees an exit sign glowing in the headlights and directs the car to it. They can’t drive any further, not with the visibility this poor. Not when his head aches this much.
Daddy is already turning away from him, pushing the cart toward the vegetable aisle, which has to be the most
His own child.” Her voice wavers, but she keeps going. “Everyone started wondering, started talking behind his back — what if he killed Caleb, too? What if there were more bodies out there? Samuel tried to intimidate us. Kept guns on us, marched everyone deeper and deeper into the woods. But Gwen — she knew where you’d hidden the weapons for your escape plan. She was eight months pregnant and ready for war.” Mama almost laughs, but it sounds more like a sob. “We acted complacent. Beaten. And two days ago he finally let his guard down just enough for Max to sneak away from the group. He found your stash, and he brought back a couple of handguns.”
Anna and Jack have a rudimentary map spread over the conference table in Headquarters, and Anna is in the middle of marking something on it when Claire and Cas walk in. Jack grins at them, standing up on his new leg braces and waving hello.
He pulls off the road and onto the shoulder next to the Impala, and Dean’s heart rate speeds up as he watches Cas get out of the Continental, a dark blot moving against the backdrop of the night. He’s not surprised when Cas opens the passenger door and clambers inside, but Dean jumps nonetheless.
“I’m going, too,” he says, forced cheer in his voice. “Might be good to get the old gang back together again after all this time.”
Dean grimaces. “I don’t think she’s my wife. That just feels… wrong. And people can’t see the future, Gwen.”
When the checks come, Cas freezes in fear. Sometime during the first apocalypse Dean explained to him, after picking up a girl’s bar tab and disappearing to the bathroom with her for ten minutes, that to pay for someone’s food or drink symbolizes a sexual interest in them (Cas did not point out that Dean always paid for his food and drinks because he knew Dean wouldn’t appreciate that).
,” he writes on a scrap of notepad paper, then he resumes drawing on the map. This little unnamed road branches off like the one he drew for Bobby, one branch running along the creek at the base of the mountain, ending in a dead end, and the other crossing over what must be a bridge, climbing the mountain into the neighboring county. Dean’s little road follows the rise in elevation, snaking just below the peak before plunging into a valley where it ends. Dean draws small boxes around the end of his road — buildings, Cas realizes.
When he’s finished, Dean stands to take the bowl to the sink, but Cas stops him. “I’ve got it,” he says, not looking at Dean as he takes it. Dean sinks back down into the couch, listening to the sound of Cas turning the water on, rinsing the bowl out and then drying it. He wonders how long it takes to clean one bowl, but figures Cas has earned the right to avoid him as long as he can. In the distance, Dean hears the burbling, rolling sound of an approaching thunderstorm. He glances out the window. The sky is darkening out over the bay, and clouds are building on the horizon.
“To talk,” Dean says simply. “I’m willing to let you set the record straight, Mr. Novak.” Cas doesn’t miss the newfound formality. “Meet with me for an interview, and I’ll gladly listen to the Shurleys’ side of the story.”
“I watched over you,” Cas says, slower this time. “At the Braedens. I’m sorry, I know how you hate spies, but it seemed like the best way to keep you safe.”
It’s been two fucking days, and they’re only 50 miles from the Wyoming-Nebraska border when Jack pipes up from the back seat. “I’m hungry,” he says. Again.
There, in the passenger’s side, sits a man. He looks like a normal, elderly gentleman — almost bald, delicate glasses, bushy grey eyebrows he raises at Dean. And he appeared out of nowhere.
Which is why he quickly adds, “I just thought it might be good to grow the family.” Cas says it so Dean knows that he understands what’s most important to him, that trying to fix Cas’s mistake with Lisa is no small offer. It’s a chance to give Dean back what he once had, a family beyond Sam and Mary, a life without monsters. Cas wants Dean to know he could have that again, maybe. If he wanted.
“Guys!” By the time Sam speaks up, Cas and Dean are glaring at each other, Walkman forgotten. “Listen — Cas, if you’ve gotta go, just keep us updated, okay? No forgetting to text for weeks, please.”
” He practically spits the word. “If you want your freedom so bad, I hope you’re prepared to run for it.” Then he and the crowd move aside.
Sam stares at him in shock. The Winchesters don’t tell just anyone about the bunker. It’s a hard-earned secret. Eileen knows about it because she lives there now. Charlie visited a few times before she died, and of course there was Kevin. They let Crowley in when he was still alive, but only on occasion, and they had to break wards to grant him entry every time. The bunker is still warded against angels, which must mean —
“Since when has there been a road there?” Bobby asks with a snort. “I was up that way not a year ago, droppin’ by the Roadhouse, and I’ve never seen another road.”
“What is this place?” Dean asks, eyeing the rusted chair dubiously. “Are you gonna give me tetanus?”
“You can go back to work, Cas,” Jody says. “I’ll have you and Bobby run by the office later for official statements, but this—” She gestures around the waiting room, encompassing the tired looking woman slouched sleeping on a chair in the far corner and the bored nurse at the check-in desk “—is a waiting game.”
Leahy pauses. “I— I don’t know how to tell him,” she confesses. “He’s barely speaking to me, and he’s already so upset they were gone. Cas, will you go with me when I talk to him?”
“Please,” the woman says, and her voice cracks. “If you’re out there and listening, please bring Dean home. He’s just a little boy.” Tears roll down her cheeks, and her face contorts as she struggles not to cry. “He loves his brother and cars and playing with his friends. He’s sweet and gentle, and he should be with his family. He needs his mother. Please—”
“There’s no way that spoke took off his head,” Sam continues. “Look how rusty and dull it is. And the river hasn’t been high enough to move the wheel in years. Why would it turn only on the night a kid sneaks into the mill to get high? And look at the blood, I mean the splatter markings... It’s inconsistent with how the police say he died. This, this is the one that gets me. This one doesn’t seem like an accident.”
“Who do you really want to be with here? It isn’t me, is it?” she’d pressed, still gentle and kind in her questioning. Of course Cas knew the true answer to that question, but he didn’t think it was the correct one, so he didn’t say anything.
Michael hasn’t spoken since Cas let Gabriel out of the car, and he’s silent still as they park the car in the garage. Cas is not one to push him — that’s not the way their marriage works, because it’s not a real marriage — but he can’t help but say, “I’m sorry.”
“Nobody’s gonna miss that old codger,” Tanner says, just as they’re pulling up to the mill. “One mean son of a bitch, I’ll tell you that much.” He gets out of the car, pulling out a set of keys and heading toward the mill. Dean and Cas share a look, then follow.
She sighs. “If I hadn’t gotten hurt and made you think you had to erase my memories to keep me safe. Would you have tried to make it work between us, tried to win me back? Would you have tried to stay with Ben and me?”
He throws his truck into park and jumps out, leaving the engine running. A light mist coats the parking lot in an eerie glow under the sodium lights at the pumps as Cas weaves between trucks, ignoring the curious stares tracking his progress. He never changed out of the sweats he slept in. What a sight he must make to these truckers, filling up on fuel and coffee before they hit the road, watching the strange man in sleep clothes trot through the rain with desperation in his eyes.
“He’s been here for days,” Sam says, and Cas nods because he’s woken enough times to the sight of Dean lying rumpled in the chair next to his bed to tell that Dean never really leaves his side. “Are you healing okay?”
It’s been around as long as Dean can remember — not that John ever took him and Sam to any type of hunting community. The man was nothing if not distrustful of anyone without the last name Winchester. But Dean’s heard the stories about the place since he was a kid, and he saw it in person for the first time a few years ago, when Seth Lucas showed up and started a revival of sorts. Whereas hunters used to just visit The Bend to share war stories and informally swap supplies, now there’s a whole sort of compound going — they organize attacks on known monster colonies, bring in military grade weapons, have a collection of lore to rival even the bunker’s. There are rumors going around that the hunters who are really
followed by a dial tone, letting Dean know the jackass hung up on him. He curses as he steers the Impala out onto the highway. He’ll call someone else to scope out the vamp den later. He’s got to get to Nebraska now.
“Well, your mother was my first choice, but unfortunately you’re right. She’ll never help me without the Book, and I don’t have it, so you’ll have to do. What a pity.” Cas sighs dramatically. “You’re really a third-rate witch when compared to Rowena.”
Cas tells Dean that Sam is convinced Jeffords was telling the truth, which Dean agrees with. Whatever killed Lacey Parks is dropping other bodies in near identical fashion, but there are a few things that still don’t stack up.
“Nuh uh!” Gwen only laughs at him, and they wrestle in the dirt like the wild children they are until one of the adults yells, “Cut it out you two!” Laughing, competition forgotten for a moment, they sprint behind the mess hall to wash up in the big outdoor sinks.
queer people, but Dean can read between the lines, can see the emphasis on pairing up and breeding that Samuel pushes on the group. He just wishes he’d risked his one gay hook-up on a guy with some semblance of a spine. “You can’t do this to her, man. She really loves you. It’s not fair to her.”
“But, that thing you said about companionship... Cas, wait, you’ve lost your siblings? I thought you were the one that convinced them to help God nuke Amara! Cas, what... what happened with the angels?”
“You now!” he yells, grabbing Dean’s shoulders and pushing him out the door. The police and the paramedics are running down the street, and Cas urges Dean toward them with a hand on his back. “Go, Dean!”
Cas closes his eyes tight for a second, and tears squeeze out and fall down his cheeks. Sam can feel the moisture starting to pool in his own eyes.
It’s not like him to have this much trouble explaining himself. Cas is always so blunt, so steady, always says what he’s thinking unless he’s afraid Dean won’t like it.
But he lets the rest of that sentence die on the tip of his tongue. Sam looks at Dean, eyebrows raised, like he’s waiting for Dean to man up and say what he’s really thinking. Luckily Dean’s used to disappointing both himself and Sam.
It is, in fact. This is the best place Cas knows in town to get plates for $50. “Well, it’s swordfish and not bluefin tuna,” he jokes. It falls flat. “Dean, this is the best place I could think of for a business meeting. Unless you’d rather get tacos from Mis Buenos Amigos.” Cas does love their tacos, but he was hoping (foolishly) to impress Dean with a good meal. That’s shot to hell.
He sees Lisa walking back along the trail to the campsite, her arms drawn around her body protectively, actively avoiding looking at him. Seeing her gives Cas the jolt he needs to stop thinking of himself and Dean, and to start thinking of Lisa-and-Dean once again. Cas might have felt heartened in the mill when Dean declined to say yes to his offer to tell Lisa the truth. But now Dean’s begun that story himself, and Cas knows that changes everything.
“No, of course not,” Dean hurries to say. “I meant like we pull over in a field somewhere, do it Kansas style...”
“He clearly wanted a date, but he wasn’t able to get the question out,” she says, shrugging and nearly upending the wine glass in her hand. “I let him stumble through it until I basically gave up. I thought, ‘If he can’t just ask me out, then forget him.’ It’s really thanks to Cas that we even got together at all. He practically forced Sam on me.”
Dean’s face is buried in Cas’s shoulder, but he tenses as soon as he hears the voice. He knows that voice. He feels the light at his back before he manages to wriggle out of Cas’s arms, turning around and putting Cas behind him with his back to the Impala.
“Don’t make me come at you with this,” it says, shaking the blade in Dean’s direction. “You’re in no shape to make any sudden moves.”
The last number makes him ache, causes an unprecedented wetness to rise in his eyes. It’s Hannah’s, from the phone he made her purchase when they were traveling together, rounding up the rogue angels. That was two years ago, now. She’s been dead for one of those years.
He gives it one last shot, standing alone on the bottom step, head bowed and eyes closed. Official. He puts everything into it, all his longing and regret, and hopes,
“What?” a voice slurs from the other end of the room. Sam. Dean wonders when they got back, how long he’s been out. He only vaguely recalls going to sleep sometime in the late afternoon, after his headache started up again. Thank God it’s gone now, or this fucking alarm would be splitting his forehead right down the middle.
“Yeah,” Dean says, maybe a little impatiently, confused and flustered. “If you’re him, I know your daughter.”
But Sam doesn’t want to talk to him. He remembers Cas’s accusations all too well, how hard his eyes looked when he told Sam that he was the one to make Cas leave the bunker. Sam wonders if Cas told Dean something similar, if that’s why his brother is walking around unnaturally quiet and cowering under his covers. Dean’s not afraid of storms, but he’s terrified of letting people down.
“Sorry,” Dean mutters, rubbing at his eyes with his knuckles. “Sorry. I, uh — I have some weird tendency to kind of space out sometimes. Sorry.”
“Maybe if the fish doesn’t try to drag you to your death,” Dean mutters, but he’s stopped trying to glare the lake into submission. “I have no desire to be Mr. Limpet’d.”
“I already sold my fucking soul,” Dean snaps, scrambling to his feet. “You don’t get to walk back my deal, Constantine! If you’ve got a problem with it, take it up with your lady friend!”
He’s quiet when he gets up, careful to step over the floorboards that creaked when he walked into the room last night. Dean gathers up his duffle and heads down the hall to the communal bathroom, ready for a shower. He smells like the road — dried sweat, the leather of Baby’s seats, and fast food.
