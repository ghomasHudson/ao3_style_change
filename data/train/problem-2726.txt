Castiel is prepared for this. He has a lock picking set in his pocket and it doesn’t take him more than a few moments to get the handcuffs unlocked. Sam all but throws himself out of the bed and wraps Castiel in a hug, burying his face against his chest to hide his sniffles. There’s no need for Dean’s instructions here. Castiel hugs him in his place.
Of course he’s more than willing to suffer through them for Cas and the chance of getting to kiss him again after nearly six years, but Dean didn’t want to take the chance with the latest Iron Man release. Which is why Dean was here at midnight last night for the premier. He’s been waiting months for it and he wasn’t going to risk Cas picking a different movie. And even if, by some stroke of luck, Cas
“Are you injured?” The Dragon’s voice is deep and pleasant, but Dean still bares his fangs at him. “Where is your flock?”
The laugh Dean gives is bitter and cold. “Dad didn’t care enough for that. It would’ve cost him money. Too bad, though. It might have saved my life if he had.” He sighs and Castiel feels the tingle of his touch against the top of his head. “Never mind about that, Cas. Get some sleep so you can be ship shape for finding Sam in the morning.”
, Dean.” Sam says softly. “Just take it slow. Do what's comfortable. Don't push him for more than he's willing to give. And for the love of God, if you
“I didn’t know you owned something with colour.” Charlie pipes up behind him and Dean would kick her if he wasn’t trying to wrap his head around Cas’s shirt.
at the sight of the red liquid inside. Blood. That’s fucking blood and Dean’s lips part on their own, tongue darting out to lick them. He wants it. He actually fucking
A rock bounces off the boulder Dean is laying next to. Cas is somewhere doing his Satyr-y things and Dean’s been lost in thought for a while now, trying to decide how many shoulders he would have to stand on to get over the wall. When another rock nearly hits him, he sits up to and glares around, determined to find the culprit. Sometimes the children like to throw stones at the freaks and Dean has never been afraid of giving them a piece of his mind about it.
“I won't say yes just yet, Dean. But I give you my permission to court me.” Cas pulls him down against his chest and Dean folds into the hug, his legs stretching out to tangle with Cas's. It's been a long time since he slept in here – not since they first arrived and a terrible storm had scared both him and Sam into Cas's bed. This is nothing close to the same as then and Dean rests his head on Cas's chest, listening to the beat of his heart.
The fizz of the cappuccino machine catches Castiel’s attention and he turns to find one of their employees, Garth, glaring at the levers. As he fetches the bills that need to be delivered to their tables, Castiel grabs the instruction manual and hands it to him with a smile. Even he sometimes has troubles with that machine.
Castiel’s smile grows and he leans across the seat between them. His sniff is over exaggerated before he sits back and catches the blush on Dean’s cheeks. “I think you smell very nice.”
Before the sun even reaches the lips of the canyon, they're already in the sky. Dean keeps Sam in front of him, caging him between his arms as he holds onto the feathered scales along the back of Cas's neck. The beat of Cas's massive wings can be felt all through his back and Dean can't help but be hypnotized by it. He barely takes his eyes off the flex of muscle and sinew for the entire flight.
After a brief chat with the building manager, Dean is not at all happy to hear that it could take anywhere between thirty and sixty minutes for a repairman to be dispatched to get them out. At this point, a fire crew would be better and Dean contemplates calling Sam at the library to get him to call in a tip or something because this isn't going to be fun.
gonna do? Sam’s been gone for too long, Cas. I watch shows and shit. I know what happens to kidnap victims.”
And leaving would mean saying goodbye to Cas. Thinking about that makes something pinch tight behind Dean's ribs and it gets hard to breathe. It feels like his entire torso locks up, no matter which of his forms he's in, and he hates it. There are a ton of reasons why he doesn't want to leave here. Some of them are a kick to his ego, but others – others are things Dean's not even sure he
He waits with them for their sister to return with three others and he looks to her in surprise at the young warrior she brought with her. His sister has always had good judgement and if she believes this wide eyed youth to be a good fit for their team, than he will trust her choices. Of the other two, he recognizes another, not much younger than himself, that he knows to practically idolize him. The dark haired sister next to him is one that Castiel has often considered as someone who could take his place whenever he should ever choose to step down as clan leader.
“Are you satisfied, Castiel?” His red-headed sisters asks, gesturing at the gathered group. “I assumed you wanted a team who would fight well together.”
The orb shatters when Cas closes his hands over it, squeezing it between his palms until it breaks and disperses. “Be that as it may, It wouldn’t sit well with me to leave the both of you on your own out here. And you wouldn't have to stay with me for long. Just until your brother is old enough to hunt on his own. That won't be for a while yet and a growing Wyvern needs much more than you would be able to provide for him.”
Bitter. Resentful. Hurt, and more than a little angry. Yeah, that’s all Dean Winchester right now. All of that and a little bit of sulking while he’s skulking through a mine shaft with the heavy potential of housing a pissed off and hungry wendigo inside. Which is, in reality, a horribly stupid idea. Any hunter would say so. Bobby actually did when Dean told him where he was going and what he was doing.
That hurts more than Castiel thought it would. Even though he expected it, there was no way to prepare himself for Dean not remembering him. He chokes back the lump in his throat and forces himself to nod. “I’m one of the detectives who was looking for your brother.”
Cas’s counting stops and he puts his head back on Dean’s shoulder, eyes closed. “I was ashamed.” When Dean doesn’t say anything, Cas continues. “There was nothing I was afraid of when I was an angel, and you - you relied on me so much. For everything.”
Dean can’t be bothered to lift his head from Cas’s chest, or even to articulate a proper answer. He merely hums and rubs his cheek against the smooth skin of his sternum, a poor nod but one nonetheless.
Oh. Dean pulls his radio off his hip and holds it to his mouth. “Sam, I think I found the monsters. Over.”
Without hesitation, Castiel steps off his perch and drops to the terrace below. Three of his most trusted clan members are there, stretching and shaking out the stone dust from their hair and wings. He touches the shoulder of the red-headed sister who led the clan before she made him their leader.
Yeah, Dean really doesn’t want to hear those. He reaches across the table and grabs the front of Cas’s stupid sweater. Cas shuts up right around the time Dean pulls him forward and meets him over the table for their first kiss.
you here. Don’t you dare leave me again or I swear I’ll lose my fucking mind.” The sheer thought sends his mind reeling, and the next words come without thinking. “I love you, Cas. I do. I
“Last time we spoke about you, he said that you’d be here eventually. Said he’d just wait here, then.”
He feels a hand on his shoulder. Bobby is looking at him, as always understanding what Dean cannot fathom himself.
He checks the rearview mirror and feels the sting of disappointment when the backseat remains empty.
The funny thing is, he has never imagined anything beyond their usual banter. He’s never pictured him the way he’s pictured Cassie, or Lisa, or anyone he’s had before. But now that he does, it’s weirdly – right.
say, even more that he’s afraid to say. He wants to pull his friend close and still he fears if he touches him he’ll vanish into air.
He knows it because how else could one explain the heartache he’s felt, every time he watched him die; how could one explain this monumental feeling of loss, that gaping, dark hole in his chest aching with every unexpected memory of those better days. How could he feel so alive and whole and
The Roadhouse greets him with the familiar scent of wood and smoke and a tinge of motor oil. Dean steps around the corner, and stops. For a second, he stops dead in his tracks, and then Bobby turns his head and just stares, mouth slightly open, eyes wide and disbelieving and suddenly filling with tears.
It’s not even his fault that Cas died, deep down he understands that. It’s just such as Cas thing to do, sacrificing himself for the one he loves – a Winchester, through and through, for being a Winchester has never been less about blood than it has been during those last years – and with or without God’s help, there’s nothing Dean could have done to stop him. He’s been down that road before, and it’s not the worst way to go actually, saving someone you love.
“This Heaven is magnificent,” he finally says, gesturing vaguely at his surroundings, the open street and the starry night sky that cannot quite be drowned out by the street lamps. “I’ve met the others, too. It’s awesome.”
He crosses the short distance between him and Cas with one step, and then he has his fingers curled around the fabric of the familiar coat and his face buried against the crook of Cas’ neck.
How could he allow himself to feel that way about a man when it’s so much easier to hide behind his issues and push him away, again.
It’s a stupid greeting, and it doesn’t sound right, but then he’s got Bobby’s arms wrapped around him, feels his shoulders shaking ever so slightly, and something falls into place.
“Heaven don’t work like that anymore. It’s not like a collection of memories playin’ on a loop. It’s for new memories. Your mom and dad – they’re just down the road.” He chuckles softly and points at the Roadhouse behind them. “There’s darts inside and pool. Your mom’s leading the champions’ lists for both. Poor John.”
, who cared about the whole world because – no, he can’t go there, it’s a dangerous memory, it’s a kind of hurt that he’s kept stored away, safe in a corner of his soul unless he does the wrong thing and talks about it. That loss is still too raw, too overwhelming, and this is Heaven, he shouldn’t have these memories here.
“Can you – can you see what’s going on… back there?” he asks, a question that he didn’t know he had.
“I guess so. It’s a mysterious place we’re in. There’s just a vague sense of time, and it changes constantly. It’s hard to explain, but you’ll find that out for yourself.”
He looks over her shoulder and smiles at Ellen, a rag stuck in the pocket of her jeans, a glass of beer in her hand. She just nods courtly, not wanting to interrupt the moment, but he can see the tears glistening in her eyes and feels his own eyes burning again. When they part, the music starts again. There’s a small stage that he only spots just now; there are instruments and a long-haired guy trimming his guitar with a riff that sends shivers down Dean’s spine.
It’s such a Jo thing to say, and Dean lets out a shaky laugh. He takes a beer from Ellen. He’s aware of the fact that no one is asking him what happened. He’s grateful; there are things he cannot say out loud, not now, maybe never. He doesn’t know how much time passes, it could be minutes, it could be days. It’s good to be home. It really is.
This isn’t right. The air feels wrong in his lungs, but he can feel his heart beating, so that's something.
Suddenly he feels restless. He loves this place, these people, but he should be somewhere else. He needs to find Cas, he knows he does, and even though he understands, rationally, that he has all the time in the world and more, he needs to leave now.
He feels his skin tingle as he recalls the last time they touched, Cas’ hand on his shoulder, so brief, so desperate; deep down, in his subconscious, he remembers the first time, too, amidst the blood and screams and horrors, a lifeline out of Hell that has stretched across a decade.
“Damnit, boy,” he can hear him muttering, voice muffled against his jacket but heavy with grief nonetheless. “You shouldn’t be here. Not now. Not now.”
Bobby’s voice startles him. On the wooden floor, there are tiny pieces of paper that he has nibbled from the bottle. Bobby looks at him knowingly, and Dean can feel his stomach clench and his chest ache in a way that has nothing to do with his phantom injury.
Love is love is love, people say, and it’s true, but where is the line between one kind and the other?
The two words are so unexpected that Dean lifts his head and narrows his eyes. He almost laughs. The hand leaves his shoulder.
He stills, slowly lowering his hands from their defensive position, and it is then that he realizes he can’t feel the burn on his forearm anymore, from when he hit the hot stove making pancakes, and didn’t he bump knee first into the door frame just this morning when he played with Miracle?
Dean can feel his eyes starting to sting; the corners of his mouth twitch, his chin starts to tremble. He blinks once, twice, he won’t cry, not here, not now.
And suddenly the music stops, the room is silent; the words sink in and drown out all the rest as understanding almost pulls the earth from below his feet. Bobby stands there with a smile tugging at the corner of his lips, raising one eyebrow as if it that was enough to confirm what Dean doesn’t even dare to ask.
“And it’s okay if you don’t feel the same way. I’ve accepted that long ago. This is your Heaven, not mine. If you want me gone –“
It’s a realization that almost pulls the ground from below his feet; he lets out a shaky laugh which might be more of a sob. He’s made it to Heaven.
For a moment they just stand like this, and maybe they’re both crying, because he’s right, as always Bobby is right. It’s okay, it’s how he always wanted to go, but it’s a little too much and a little too soon, it’s okay, but it’s not good, either.
And so he walks, it’s not that far, and he tries as hard as he can to push aside those other memories. Sam’s forehead pressed against his own, his touch the one thing keeping him from breaking apart; the Empty and Death and Castiel,
“Hey baby,” he mutters, the words leaving the tip of his tongue the same way they always do, and he can almost see Sam rolling his eyes. Something warm shifts inside his chest and spreads through his body all the way to his fingertips; he tears his gaze from the car and lifts his head to look at the front door of the roadhouse.
“Do you lovebirds need another moment?” Bobby asks, raising his eyebrows in mockery, and it’s Dean’s turn to roll his eyes and follow the older man into the house.
Dean watches the people at the bar, listens to the band that has started to play. He really has lost all sense of time.
And he needs him back. Needs him, because ever since the Empty took him, he hasn’t felt whole, the world has been off-balance, the universe a little unhinged and he hasn’t stopped falling since.
He tries to sound as calm as possible, and if Bobby detects the urgency in his voice he doesn’t comment on it.
But he remembers now. The Kansas City motel, the phone call. And he remembers the girls at that school, many years later, the musical, the smirks and raised eyebrows and annoying arguments with Sam about a stupid nickname and two girls holding hands, foreheads touching, feathered wings made of wire and duct tape and, beneath his annoyance, barely there, this warm feeling in his chest upon listening to the story of the angel who waited.
“Cas,” he rasps, barely breathing, and for a moment he just stands there, leaning into the touch on his shoulder as if Cas’ hand was the only thing keeping him from falling. It surely feels that way. Blue eyes lock with his own, looking at him and right into him, too; it’s too much and Dean averts his gaze.
The thought hasn’t even crossed his mind, and Dean feels his cheeks burning with shame. Of course he should see them, it’s the logical thing to do, they’re family. He misses his mother, has missed her all his life and then some more after her second death.
They sit down on the bench eventually, side by side, Bobby and Dean, and he might as well be fourteen again and waiting for Dad to come back from the hunt.
But neither of them moves. After more than a decade, they have all the time in the world. They just remain where they are, foreheads touching, hands clasped tightly, finally home and just
He’s 41 years old. He’s had two big loves in his life, and ultimately, he’s driven them both away, different circumstances, same outcome. He’s often wondered if he’s simply incapable of loving someone as his dad loved his mom, and Sam loves Eileen. He’s had his fair share of women, but between Cassie and Lisa, no one has ever given him the desire to quit, settle down, do what lovers do when they grow old. He’s not cut out for the white picket fence life; it’s a life for those who are at peace with themselves, and inside him, the silent war has never stopped raging. There’s a pretty decent chance that he’ll turn his love away just because he doesn’t trust himself, and how could he possibly do that to anyone?
And it occurs to him that Bobby probably doesn’t even know what happened. He may have talked to Cas, practical discussions about how this new Heaven works, probably asking for him and Sam, but anything else?
He steps over the threshold, and for a split second he thinks he’s jumped back in time. He remembers, from the jukebox in the corner to the pool table and the collection of single malt whiskies on the shelf, right below the mirror with the crack in the lower left corner.
The world vanishes beneath his feet. For a moment he’s free falling, for less than a blink of the eye, then the earth is back, he stumbles, fighting for balance –
“I should have tried to get you back,” he murmurs, “I should have looked for you, and I wanted to, Cas, you gotta believe me, I wanted to, but I was – I was afraid. And I – I shouldn’t even say that, it’s so cheap, and you deserve better. I need you, but I don’t deserve you.”
He leaves the bar just as the band starts to play. The Impala is still in its spot, key in the ignition. The inside smells of cheeseburgers, gasoline, fresh earth; he can even detect Sam’s aftershave lingering subtly in the passenger seat.
He’s scared. Part of him would love to slam the brakes and go back to the Roadhouse, because underneath the anticipation, there’s the lingering fear of facing his failure again.
“You can’t leave here, can you?” Cas shakes his head. “But you would send me back? Even if it meant – even if we – if you –“
The road opens up before him, endless and empty, wide slopes lined with pine trees and the occasional signs that blur as they pass. They don’t matter. He’s pretty sure there’s no speed limit in Heaven and he doesn’t even know where he’s going. All he knows is that he needs to get
“Dean… he’ll be here. Soon. No, wait, here me out,” Bobby says when Dean opens his mouth to object, “See, time works differently in Heaven. You’ll see. 40 years on Earth can feel like four weeks in here.”
One long moment he can only stare at Jo, smiling and young and just so alive; there’s a twinkle in her eyes that hasn’t been there before. Images play inside his mind, of blood and tears and the howling of beasts; the lump in his throat grows to the size of a football.
His breath hitches at the last words. Yes, this Heaven is a wonderful place. But he can’t help thinking that he shouldn’t be here. Not yet. His friend died to give him a life, and he wasted this golden ticket.
There’s no pain. Not even the slightest ache. And it should be there, loud and omnipresent and fucking hurting because he died.
The lights of a small town appear in the distance. There’s something vaguely familiar about the street here, too, though Dean can’t quite put his finger on it. Those small towns all look the same, after all. The night sky is illuminated by neon signs that mute the stars that are still there, even in Heaven. There are a few people up and about as Dean lets the car roll down the street. He tries not to dwell on the fact that they are all dead. A sign on one of the houses catches his eye. It’s a motel, the letters on the sign a little weathered, the curtains still closed in most windows.
Suddenly there’s music from inside the house. It startles him. He knows that song, though he can’t remember the name. Bobby claps his shoulder.
It’s such a sincere statement, and yet there’s love in every syllable, so palpable and real that it makes him ache to the very core. He thinks of the past hours at the roadhouse, of the car ride that took him to this place, and then he allows himself to look at Cas, really look at him, and if someone asked him what home feels like, he’d say,
Dean knows that his friend would like to ask more, find out what happened, but it’s Bobby. Bobby who always just
The memory hits him like a shockwave; suddenly Dean finds himself on the ground, hands shaking, automatically wandering to his chest where the phantom pain of the metal rod is flickering like a broken lightbulb in a window that is a thousand miles away. It’s not real, this aching, just a memory.
Cas raises one eyebrow. In the moment before he smiles, there's something that shutters behind his eyes, but then he's smiling and almost looks like he's amused. “Did someone at Dragon Falls catch your eye this year?”
Dean should have known better than to upset a gypsy. They have more myths and legends surrounding them than most folk do and Dean
He’s been hiding his own desires for years and it came as a rather nice surprise when Dean asked him on this date. Castiel knows he’s moving a little quickly by arranging to sleep over at Dean’s house directly after their first official date. But he wants to talk to Dean about this. If they’re going to make this a continuous thing - if they’re going to move past being simply
“Where would you be most comfortable to have the mark?” Cas asks, eyes focused on the scarred expanse of Dean’s chest. “You will have to show it to every dragon you face to gain their trust.”
.” Cas's coat hits the floor too and sweat is starting to prickle all across his forehead. “I don't feel – I don't like this. I want out, Dean. I want
Cas gives him an odd look and the light flashes in his eyes again. “I can see more than just your physical form, Dean. Every creature has a soul light. Some shine brighter than others and the brighter the soul, the greater the good within the person.” His tail curls behind him as he smiles. “And you are very bright.”
His shirt is tucked up around his hips, covering what Dean is extremely interested in. The fabric is tented slightly with Cas’s own arousal and Dean bites his bottom lip, looking up at Cas and waiting for his permission. A slow nod is all he gets and Dean leans forward, edging the hem up slowly as he presses kiss after kiss across Cas’s hips. He follows the crease of his thigh to his balls and Cas’s hips twitch when he runs his tongue over them, laying a wet path along the length of his prick.
As soon as he’s free, Cas’s arms fall around Dean’s shoulders, squeezing tight as he gasps into the kiss. He can almost feel Cas’s heart beat through their shirts, pounding hard against his ribs. It’s almost delirious to be able to feel it again after months – no, it’s been more than a
Good. He knows Cas has a varied library at home, but he wants him to feel comfortable here too. When the engine rumbles to life and the dash lights up, Dean makes sure the volume isn’t loud enough to discourage talking or something. Usually he prefers playing it so loud that Sam doesn’t try to talk his ear off about boring shit. Cas gets the special treatment because he’s a guest and this is the first time they’re meeting and all that goopy shit that has his heart still playing like it’s a trapeze artist.
As Cas follows under Sam while he works out the mechanics of getting a good rhythm with his wings, Dean spread his own arms and closes his eyes. It's not nearly the same in his Human form as it would be in his natural Wyvern body, but for a little while it almost feels like he's flying too and he doesn't feel so bad about the problems the world has given him.
That blue eyed glare follows him around the room as he sets out on a mission to light the lanterns swinging from the ceiling and close the curtains. No one needs to be given the chance to catch a peek at what will happen next. His captive is strung up in the center of the room, his back to a post and the rope binding his hands currently stretched over a hook well above his head. The young master’s shiny, heeled shoes barely touch the floor and he’s clearly straining in the position.
“Hello, princess.” Dean lifts one of the girls into his arms when she runs to meet him. “Were you waiting for me? Where are the others?”
“This is going to be a problem.” He puts Dean’s wallet next to his hip and stares at him. This is definitely the same guy Dean’s pretty sure he saw in the cave. Those eyes aren’t easily forgettable. “My name is Castiel.”
It’s too much of a strain on Dean’s patience to stay there for long. He’s missed Cas too much to spend their first moments just like this. He gropes across the sheets for the dagger again and amuses himself with Cas’s gasp of surprise as he brings the cold blade to his belly. Dean sits back and slices Cas’s shirt open in one smooth slide as he crawls higher up the bed, forcing Cas’s legs up around his waist. He kneels between them, his knees framing Cas’s hips.
He must be lying. Dean squints at him in the bright light. Why is Cas making himself all comfortable here with the light orbs? Does he think he's going to spend the night in the cave with them? His plan is probably to fatten them up and eat them during the night and Dean isn't going to allow it. “You're not allowed to sleep in here.”
Cas's smile grows and he strains forward, meeting Dean for another kiss. This is far less desperate than before. Dean bends his knees and wraps his arms around Cas’s hips, lifting him up enough that he can unhook himself. Sam gave him just enough slack to make sure that he wouldn’t be
something about it. Really, this isn’t the first time that he’s thought about the possibility of kissing Cas. Seriously, who doesn’t entertain those fantasies about their close friends every once in a while? But Dean
None of that bothers him, though. He kind of enjoys talking to Cas about everything he doesn’t know. It gives him something else to focus on other than how unhappy he is with his current situation. And it gives his brain a rest from constantly trying to come up with all the possible ways he could escape.
On the day Dean chooses to leave, not having stayed more than a week, the children circle around him and his horse. The youngest cling to his legs. “Don’t go!” “You’ll come back, right?” “Stay, stay!” And the oldest tug at his arms. “Teach us how to use the sword!” “We want to protect Cas too!”
“Good. I would hate for anything to happen to you.” Cas pauses, looking away as his tail twitches. “The children would be devastated.”
But Sam isn’t listening anymore. He shoves his way around Dean and flares his wings, the long membrane still too thin for him to fly. His horns and tail are short and stubby but he still hunches his shoulders to look fierce. “Dean didn’t do anything! He was just born different and they didn’t want him anymore!”
understand from it is that things are not going well for Mr. Keltainen’s company. The Winchesters are days away from sealing the deal and frankly, this would be the perfect way to try and distract John from his business. This is something that John should have told them the day that Sam went missing when they sat him down and asked who he thinks could be behind it. The fact that he didn’t point fingers is both intriguing and confusing.
Everyone turns to Cas then, searching for confirmation. At first he seems surprised by the question. He shrugs and scoops up one of the little ones, turning away as if he has no care for their curiosity. “Do what you want.”
After a while, Dean presses his nose into the hairs at the base of Cas’s skull and takes a deep breath of the scent he’s been craving for a year. “Are you sure you’re ready for this?”
As they finally turn towards home, Castiel doesn’t like the bitter taste of worry twisting on the back of his tongue. There is doubt about the safety of his clan. It sits at the back of his mind, overshadowed by the untrustworthy eyes of the young king’s chief counsellor. He had seemed far too eager for Castiel and his team to leave the keep.
Contrary to what Dean thinks, it was Sam’s panic button that saved his life. The police were on scene within minutes of him receiving the blow to the back of his head. There are a few theories about what happened after that. Some of the investigators believe that the kidnappers didn’t have the time to carry a fully grown, unconscious, nineteen year old to their get-away car. Others think that Sam went willingly to either keep them from hurting him (or Dean) any more, or possibly so they would leave Dean behind.
Whenever that happens, Dean can always find Cas sitting in his corner with his furry knees drawn to his chest and his droopy ears drooping more than usual. Dean always feels a pang of regret behind his ribs when he sees Cas looking like that. He’s an attractive young man and Dean has thought, on occasion during his time here, that if either of them were fully human, he would act on that with his usual enthusiasm. What he wouldn’t give to be not
This is the first time that he’s allowed to touch. Dean has always been tactile with him. They’ve shared the bed during every sleepover and Dean has never been shy about throwing an arm around his shoulder or grabbing his wrist to tug him along. The more that Castiel thinks back about it, the more he realizes that he should have known about Dean’s attraction to him before.
. The slap from before is making his ears ring and there’s not a whole lot he can do when his damn feet aren’t even touching the ground or without knowing what happened to his bag and all his supplies.
Dean allows himself to take quite a bit of pleasure from the way the young master’s eyes go dark and his arms tremble as he strains at the rope keeping them above his head. As he slides his knee between the young master’s legs, Dean carefully slips the blade under the gag covering his cheek and stretching between his teeth. “I’m going to have
Castiel snarls, flaring his wings. He drops to all fours when the guards storm the room, bounding out of the way of their spears. There is no other choice for him now. Either he takes his vengeance and risks what few of his clan remains, or he gets them to safety and a new home. It’s their survival that is his top priority now and Castiel refuses to fail them as he did the others.
“I may be kind to children, but I am still a dragon.” He shrugs and smooths out the blanket on the bed. “We like to hoard shiny things. Is that a problem for you?” Dean shakes his head and Cas nods, pleased. “Good. Now lay here. You will need to remove your shirts.”
curse, but should he really have trusted Dean not to get in trouble? A cloak can cover his legs, but cobblestone streets give away the hooves. And not even a hood can hide the curling horns arching out from the sides of his head.
The dragon helps him carry the horn to his horse. Even she doesn’t seem fazed by having what should be a threat so near. She even allows the dragon to pet her neck while Dean ties the horn behind his saddle. He swings up into the seat and looks down at the dragon.
It takes them well over an hour to find anything useful. At first glance, it’s merely a personal email to a close friend detailing the events of John’s week. What catches Castiel’s attention is a paragraph nearly lost in the middle of the entire email.
Dean hasn’t been shy about discussing his romantic (and often sexual) exploits before, but this new revelation of his feelings is making Castiel reevaluate everything that has happened between them for as long as he can remember. Has Dean told him
Carefully, Dean removes his helmet and holds it pinned to his side under his arm. He runs a hand through his hair and looks in confusion from the children to the dragon. It looks like all the children that went missing are present and, for dirty orphans, they all look very clean. Even their clothing has fresh patches sewn in over tears and holes. This is an unexpected development.
useful as a ghost, if Castiel can disregard the annoying things he uses his ghostly powers for. (He’s lost track of the number of times Dean has nearly given him a heart attack by coming through a wall.)
“I thought you were sleeping.” Dean sits up in his bed at the sound of Cas’s hooves on the wood floor of the cabin Sam had found for them.
It takes almost a whole forty minutes for someone to get the elevator moving and the doors opened. The first moment the elevator shakes, Cas damn near breaks Dean’s hand with a nervous squeeze. Dean winces, but he still stands and pulls Cas to his feet.
“And this is a problem for Wyverns?” At the flat look he receives from both Dean and Sam, the Dragon dips his head. “I apologize for my confusion. I did not know it would be so different for a Wyvern. There are plenty of Dragon breeds who have no wings and never fly.”
“That’s my serial killer.” He stops Dean with a hand on his shoulder and leans in to kiss him on the cheek.
for, rather than something that caught his eye. He shrugs and runs a hand through his hair and looks down at the gift as Cas unwraps it slowly, revealing a small mirror with precious gems embedded in the frame.
Dean wonders who the author is and flips to the first page again, before the writing even starts. The only thing there is a; “If found, please return to…” box with Cas’s name written in it. Dean’s heart just about stops when he reads over Cas’s name a half dozen times or more, written in the same neat script as the rest of the book he’s been reading.
That is all that they need. Together they follow Gilda through the portal she wove into the air and soon after, they sleep in a circle with claws and fangs bared. Even here, they want to strike fear into the hearts of those who would dare to approach them in their vulnerable stone sleep.
to sleep.” He muffles a yawn under his hand and pulls the blanket higher over his shoulder. “There are better, older, and more experience detectives than me that you could be bothering right now.”
Days pass this way and Dean doesn’t bother to count them. He’s too busy doing his best to catch canyon rats and fat toads from the creek that cuts along the canyon floor. Every night, when he takes his Wyvern form and curls around Sam to keep him warm, Dean is too exhausted to think about how long they’ve been on their own.
It’s no surprise that the only ones who follow are the six he had with him. Sunrise is fast approaching and he has no idea if the betrayers will follow. He knew that many of the humans were never comfortable with his clan living so close, but he never thought it would come to this. So many have died and already the sky is brightening in the distance, a smear of red on the horizon to mark the blood spilled.
Cas is probably the nicest creature in the whole world, and Dean doesn't want to leave that. He'll be fully grown soon and Sam won't be able to carry him for a long time yet, if ever. Chances are, if he and Sam do leave, he's going to have to travel by ground and that's not safe for either of them. Why would he want to do that when Cas has opened his home to them and doesn't seem like he's ever going to ask them to leave.
Dean nods and holds his hand out to Sam, not even needing to look to know that he’s probably got his gun out. It’s already going to be hard enough to explain one damaged firearm, let alone
“For what?” Cas turns his head to look over his shoulder at him. “A life of high seas and adventures with you? I’ve been waiting for this day for a long time, Dean.” A smile plays across his lips and he wiggles back against him, settling comfortably and lacing their fingers together over his stomach. “I’ll manage.”
“I’d hate for you to waste your breath.” He sneers, holding the shield in front of his body should an attack come. He can easily duck his head behind it to hide his eyes, and the reflective metal should hopefully deflect the weaker attacks. If the dragon chooses not to play, there is nothing Dean can do to stop a focused attack.
It’s a question that catches both Dean and Sam off guard. They share a confused look before turning back to the Dragon as he stands to his full height again. “If I’m not mistaken, Wyvern are normally aerial hunters, yet neither of you can fly. Have you been able to get enough food?”
Dean’s smile turns sad. “Make sure Dad gets what’s coming to him and take care of Sammy, okay? Tell him it was my last wishes or something if he makes a fuss and let him know that he can have my Impala.”
“I need to discuss this with my clan.” Castiel turns from her to look at the few remaining members of his once large family. “What do the rest of you think of this?”
As they drive home afterwards, Dean gives Castiel a curious, almost excited, look. “So, is it a go? Are we gonna get this guy?”
“It's never been a goal of mine. But I wouldn't oppose it –” He looks back at Dean, his eyes and smile warm. “As long as they were the right creature.”
.” He continues, speaking softly and gently tapping the flat of the blade against his captive’s cheek. “What’s the name your daddy was calling out again? Castiel, was it?”
It’s just a one story little square of a building; tiny little living room that barely fits the four piece furniture set in there, itty bitty little kitchen with everything shoved together on one wall and next to no counter space or room for a table. Cas’s dining room is out on the
Cas's breathing doesn't even out, but he does look a little less panicked. His hand shakes a little when he taps the spot next to him and Dean immediately shuffles over to sit there, making sure to leave as much room as he can so Cas doesn't feel like he's being boxed into the corner. After a moment, Cas reaches out to take his hand. It hurts a little with how hard he's squeezing it, but Dean rubs his thumb over the back of his knuckles anyways.
Dean gathers Cas to his chest, sliding his hands up and over his chest until he can turn Cas’s head to face him for a kiss. Cas breaks it the moment Dean lines up and pushes in slowly, his head falling back against Dean’s shoulder with a shuddering moan. He wraps his hand around Cas’s leaking prick, rubbing his thumb under the head and lightly pressing his nail into the slit, doing whatever will give Cas the most pleasure now to distract him from any pain.
“I did, thank you. Depending on this meeting with the council, we may very well be leaving the castle tonight.”
Dean wrinkles his nose at the name. He’s fairly sure that he won’t be able to pronounce it. “Alright. Thanks, Cas. But, uh, why’d you do it?”
Dean’s stomach twists and sinks to the general vicinity of his knees. Suddenly his throat feels very dry. “If I’m understanding you correctly… You’re
piss off the merchant who had commissioned the vessel to take him across the seas – and right through Dean’s territory. But that is something he can save for later. “We’ll be taking the booty now, sir, if y’don’t mind. Don’t fret your little lovely wigs off, I’m sure someone will be by before too long! A day, maybe two. Y’should be just fine!”
“I was thinking that I would take them on a trip, Raphael.” Cas answers smoothly, straightening his shoulders and standing as tall as he can. “Wyvern are naturally nomadic and these two have been living with me for the last year. Rather than leave them alone, I brought them with me to satisfy their desire for travel.”
As fun as teasing Sam is, Cas's plane is due any minute now and Dean is on the verge of pissing his pants. “What if he doesn't like me? Like, the way that I smell or something? What if we're too awkward together that we can't even kiss? What if –”
Dean shakes his head and winces. “No. Are you a cop? You’re not dressed like a doctor. Not even like Dr. Sexy and he breaks
He pretty much melts on the spot and rubs at the back of his neck. “Should – uh – should we go get your luggage or something?”
Kissing his knuckles most definitely got across to Cas exactly what Dean had hoped it would. He smiles at him, bright in the moonlight through the window, and brings a hand to Cas’s cheek. “Yeah, Cas, I’d like that too.”
His eyes get a little wider and Dean definitely sees a blush in his cheeks as Cas nods. “It was fine. Have you been waiting long?”
“Thanks, Cas.” Dean floats back again, a warm smile on his face. It lasts only a few moments before turning salacious. “I kinda wish I was alive right now. Then I could show you just how grateful I really am.”
The Dragon tilts his head, glancing from Dean to Sam. “You’re too young to have a hatchling of your own. Is he your brother, then?”
Castiel frowns and catches Dean’s wrist as he moves to plunge the knife into his chest. “It’s my turn, Dean!”
He shouldn’t be this wound up. This is just another night out with Cas, but it holds the very real possibility of ending with a goodnight kiss and Dean hasn’t kissed Cas since they ten years old and hung blankets up around his bunk bed to make a fort so they could practice kissing in secret. Dean’s had lots of practice with other people since then and he knows he’s good but what he knows isn’t the same as Cas knowing. It’s getting to give Cas firsthand knowledge that’s giving him the nervous sweats.
Dean finds himself unable to look away from the scene. It sets a warm glow in his heart and he’s content to stay on his horse, watching from under the cover of the trees until one of the children spots him. They call for Cas’s attention and Dean waits to be summoned forward. This is their home now and he refuses to enter it before he has their permission.
“Enough!” The dragon hisses, stomping its paws and digging its claws into the hard dirt of the tunnel floor. Before Dean can say otherwise, the light from the glowing design covering the dragon intensifies.
Cas comes to a stop right in front of him. Less than two feet away. Dean can't help grinning, even though he's not sure he can keep himself from reaching out to crush Cas to him or something. He's just
. He always wrote his messages with actions and their video calls just gave Castiel the impression (and the expectation) that Dean would at least
The flap over the mail slot creaks behind him and Cas’s voice comes through, only muffled by the flap on the inside and under Dean’s back. “Before you reach the point where you’re too embarrassed to ever talkme again, I would just like to say that there
Dean can feel a blush starting to creep up his neck and he tries hard to ignore it as he takes the book. “I did? Silly me!”
At the next red light, Dean chances a glance at him. “I wasn’t sure how comfortable you’d be with all the touching.” He admits, ducking his head. “I figured maybe we’d talk about that at home or something.”
me. Things that, rationally, I shouldn’t be afraid of. I can tolerate you knowing that the possibility of you being injured in a hunt upsets me - but this fear is… this is a
Cas living with them and sharing Dean's bed is actually one of the easiest things they've had to adjust to with Cas's new found humanity. His inability to heal with a touch or exorcise demons is pretty missed. But Dean likes that Cas can't zap out whenever he wants. He's gotta
“It’s not a lie. We’re doing both.” He laughs and holds out a hand. “Rock, paper, scissors for who gets the graveyard and who gets the church?”
Cas looks back at him, tail twitching behind him. “Are all humans nice?” When Dean does not respond, another smile pulls at the corner of his mouth. “There is your answer. Some of us deserve the fate you bring them, others do not. You should make your choices wisely next time, dragon slayer.”

Dean shoves the book at him again, pointing at the cover. “I didn’t write that for show, idiot. You’re
“Once. During my first meeting as the Scribe.” Cas's smile falls and he looks down at his hands and the basket forming in them. “I though it was what was expected of me. I didn't enjoy it.”
Sam is big enough to fly and hunt on his own. Every day he's teaching himself all the best tricks for catching something to eat. He doesn't need Cas to do it for him anymore and he definitely doesn't need Dean. Watching him take off to fish in the inlet or hunt in the valley on the other side of the hills makes Dean feel sick. How long is it going to be before Sam wants to leave altogether?
He does not bid Dean farewell and Dean doesn’t wait for it. Now he must return to town and tell them a lie. Dean already has it planned in his head. The townsfolk will only ever know that the dragon is dead and the children were nowhere to be found.
“Like shit.” His smile falters and he glances around the room. “Are you an angel? Is this Heaven or a hospital?”
Dean picks up one of the knives laid out on the table and taps the flat of the blade against Marv’s cheek. “You liked my pies but didn’t want to pay for them? You should’ve made better life choices. Bet you didn’t know that the fee for that would be this steep, huh?”
Cas slants another little smile at him. “Oh, really?” He holds the book out to Dean with another raised eyebrow. “How does it end, then?”
“I was caught at a young age.” A blush burns in his cheeks and Cas ducks his head slightly. “I haven’t actually
“CasCas smiles softer when you’re here.” She holds the doll out, making it dance on the saddle in front of her. “He doesn’t look so lonely then.” Her small hands catch at Dean’s neck guard, pulling him closer as her voice drops into a whisper. “And we like having both our papas home.”
Dean stands to the side of the concession counter trying for an air of indifference when really he’s nervously twisting his bracelet around his wrist. It took him
Dean can't remember the last time he's been this happy. This isn't the first time that he's been thankful that his flock left him behind. If they hadn't done that, he never would have found Cas. If it weren't for Cas, Dean probably wouldn't even be alive – let alone actually accepting himself, wings and all.
That’s the one that Castiel believes. Sam’s panic button had been left on Dean, making it easier for him to find. It’s entirely possible that Sam either dropped it on purpose or he let the kidnappers know that it was activated and they needed to leave immediately if they didn’t want to be caught. Castiel hopes they find Sam soon. He would like to get the truth from him.
Dean is exhausted when Cas pulls away and he sags back into the bed, uncaring about the curious hardness tenting his pants. With the confusing mix of feelings from the marking, he isn’t surprised by it and he chooses not to acknowledge it. Cas takes a deep, shuddering breath through his mouth. Maybe he was as affected by the marking process as Dean was. His nostrils flare and Dean can see his pupils dilate in the light from his own glowing designs.
When people start coming out through the doors, Dean's stomach gets to the point that it's doing somersaults so hard he's pretty sure he might throw up. As excited as he is to see Cas – to get to hug him and touch him – Dean is still terrified. His worries are still bouncing about in the back of his head even when he picks Cas out from the crowd the moment he comes through the doors. At that exact moment, Dean's heart is probably two seconds away from beating right out of his chest.
Fire hits it from behind. Dean squeezes his eyes shut at the bright light and wishes he could close his ears to the inhuman wail. He can feel the heat of the flames as they scorch through the wendigo, it’s skin the best fuel for the fire. In seconds its a pile of ash on the floor and Dean’s quickly losing the ability to pay attention to it. Blood keeps dribbling down his chin and his clothing is soaked with it. He can feel the hot slide of it going down his legs through his jeans.
“Yes, well, half an hour ago I felt like my trust had been horribly betrayed. You’ll have to forgive me for wanting to tease you a little.”
“You’re very calm for a kidnapped teenager.” Castiel crosses the room to the window and pulls open the curtains just enough that he can claim he saw Sam through them later. It might be enough to save his job. “I’m Detective Castiel Collins. We’ve been looking for you, Sam.”
Dean watches from a short distance, sitting under one of the many trees that line the edges of the cliff. Below them, the sea froths against the stone wall. He'd complain that this is a dangerous place for Sam to try flying for the first time, but in the month they've been with Cas, he hasn't let any harm come to them. He's made sure that they're kept warm and even showed them the proper way to build a nest, including which materials are the best to use for it.
“What do we have to lose?” Sam asks, crunching a bone between his teeth so he can suck at the marrow. “Do you really think he’s just going to eat us?”
. He whips around to find her and Sam both with wide grins and arms full of popcorn and drinks. “What the
His golden haired friend snorts in surprise, tail lashing behind him. “Leave the castle? Why in the bloody blazes would we do that?”
Tonight, with the laptop balanced on his knees in the bathroom, Castiel looks up the dine-and-dasher from this afternoon. And the facts were these…
For the first time in his life, Dean returns from a hunt before it is finished. His reputation helps him get quests, but it does him no good when he attempts to
“You took me and Sam in when we had no where else to go.” Dean whispers, filling the silence. “You gave us a home and a family again. You don't treat us any different just because we're Wyverns, and you don't treat me like I'm any different.” His hands squeeze into fists and he looks down at the edge of the bed. “You're the first creature who made me feel alright with just being me. And – and you're the idiot who made me fall in love with you.”
“You’re expecting too much from me, Cas.” Dean sighs, gesturing at the computer. “I’m lucky if I even saw Dad once a day, let alone more than once a week. I know fuck all about his life.”
Marv Ex is forty-seven years, eleven weeks, six days, fifty-five minutes and twelve seconds old, and he is not a nice man. He has been reported for dine-and-dashing at various restaurants all over the city and has been accused several times of petty theft. A renowned cheapskate, narcissist, and all around unpleasant man. He even has a data crimes file and upon further investigation, Castiel finds that Marv Ex also goes by the online alias
Slowly, Cas sits up. He folds his legs awkwardly and stares down at his hands in his lap. Again he won’t look at him and it’s sending a nervous flutter through Dean’s chest. “A curse won’t work on me, Dean.”
, Dean.” He hisses, glancing up and down the pathway to make sure no one is coming. “Do you know how hard it was to find you? I left you alone for
not appreciated right now. “Come on. Just breathe and really think about it. How long have you and Cas been doing the online dating thing?”
“So…” Cas clears his throat and Dean looks up from trying to fish the keys out of his pocket. “This is Baby?” He gestures at the freshly washed Impala – cleaned up nice, just for Cas. “She looks better in person.”
Dean tries not to show the pain crawling through his chest as he watches everyone he’s ever known take flight from the wide ledge in front of the cave. They beat their powerful wings and rise up into the sky, and not one of them looks back. This would be harder to bear if he was alone, but Dean curves his long neck and looks under his belly where his young brother is sleeping. He’s the only one who refused to leave Dean when the flock decided he was too big for them to carry anymore.
But he’s not ready to die. Dean doesn’t want to disappoint Dad, or leave Sammy behind, and Bobby is going to hate himself for not stopping him. He can’t leave just yet and not like this. Not in some stinking hole in the ground surrounded by complete strangers who may never tell anyone what happened to him. The man in front of him goes in and out of focus when Dean shakily lifts his head to look at him. He squints and tilts his head to the side. Is this bastard really going to just stand there and watch him die?
Dean shakes his head, his nose crinkling. “No, I don't want a Wyvern mate. Their flock would never accept me.” He spreads his arms as wide as they'll go to show exactly
“I’m fine.” He hushes them, leaning forward to lick the tears gently from their cheeks and smooth his claws through their hair. “I told you to stay in the cavern.”
Great. Light dragons are always difficult. They’re tricksters with their magic and they always play dirty. If they’re not trying to blind you first, they they’re focusing their light into blazing hot beams that can pierce through armor. Dean would rather deal with fire, to be completely honest. A good shield can protect him from the worst of the flames. The best he can do to protect himself against a light dragon is make sure his shield is as reflective as possible and hope this one doesn’t try to blind him straight from the start.
Cas shrugs again and reaches up to touch one of the fading orbs of light. At the prick of his claw, it flares to life again. “I haven't asked for anything in return, and I don't intend to.”
“Oh, one more thing.” Cas ducks in close and whispers again. “I would like to apologize if I happen to get excitable during this movie. I’m a very enthusiastic about these movies.”
“No, Sam, I'm serious. What if he doesn't like me in person?” Dean runs a hand through his hair and turns around at the wall to pace away from the baggage carousels. “What if I breathe too loudly or I fart too much or –
“Iron Man, duh.” She shrugs and grins at him. “You’re wound tighter than C3PO’s golden ass. You need to chill the hell out before Cas gets here.”
It's kind of awesome, sometimes, not to have things expected of him. Cas never assumes that just because Dean's wings are malformed that he can't do things for himself. He'll give Dean a task – like fetching water or helping in the garden and they're the same kind of things that he has Sam do. He doesn't offer help and waits for Dean to ask for help if he ends up needing it.
The third day is slightly less confusing than the first and second, but Dean still can’t look at the bookshelf without going red in the ears. Something about it keeps digging itself deeper into his head and it’s not just about how bad he feels for going through something so personal to Cas and finding out something he wasn’t exactly willing to share.
Good. That relieves a little of Dean's worries. “And what about me? You taught me a lot too since you found us. Am I the same?”
He looks over his shoulder at the other patrons of the restaurant and drops his voice into a whisper, leaning over the table for Castiel and Dean to lean in too. “It’s my job to look into their disappearances, but I don’t want to because it’s a
He takes two more steps and something hits Dean hard in the back ofhis thighs before his whole world tilts violently. One minute he’s staring at a bunch of monsters that
makes him interested in it is great, sure. But it’s also leaving Dean confused the whole way from the luggage carousel to the parking garage. If Cas was into it because he was into it, then how come he’s not making any moves to touch him right now? Doesn’t Cas want to hug him? Or kiss him? Is he just shy? Dean needs some kind of
to do – was go to Sam and see if he’d be willing to come hunting again now that Dad isn’t in the picture. He’s the whole reason that Sam left in the first place. Maybe he’ll come back now that Dean is alone. But first, he has to prove himself. If Dad took off because he thinks Dean is only going to slow him down with the hunt for whatever the hell killed mom, then Dean’s going to prove him wrong. He’ll take this wendigo down on his own
Dean isn’t expecting the blue-eyed Gargoyle from to dive off after him. He stretches his wings out and flaps them, boosting his fall and reaching out for Dean. Call him crazy, but Dean would rather go with the monster that looks like it’s trying to save his life than get first hand experience at why gravity is such a bitch. He doesn’t think twice about flailing both hands out, trying desperately to grab the Gargoyle’s hand.
. He wishes he could, at this point. That would help alleviate part of the boredom that comes with being trapped here.
The moment it’s presented to him, John Winchester asks for a lawyer. Dean remains silent the entire time he hovers at Castiel’s shoulder, watching through the two-way mirror. Castiel wishes there was something more that he could do for him, or anything that he could say, but nothing comes to mind. He can only stand and watch Dean’s form flicker with rage.
He squeezes Dean’s hand again and all but beams at him from across the seat. The conversations that follow that feel easier – the ice broken. Dean’s hand is warm in his for the entire trip and Castiel mourns having to let it go when it’s needed for the steering wheel as they navigate through the parking garage under the apartment complex. Castiel wants to hold it again the moment they’re out of the car and his luggage has been removed from the trunk.
This isn’t much of a surprise, really. Dean always wakes up early to take care of Sam and he works hard in all his classes. He’s allowed to be tired every once in a while and if he’s comfortable enough to fall asleep with Castiel here, then that’s fine with him. If he had to admit it, he’s pretty tired himself. Just enough for him to rest his cheek against the top of Dean’s head and muffle a yawn into his hair.
Great. Dean didn’t expect to leave Cas’s house confused beyond all reason with the hopes that a bottle of jack will be enough to get his mind off matters. That doesn’t work so well. When he goes over the next day, it’s with a hangover. He’s got a few more day until Cas gets back and he
Cas shuts the door and gives him the same kind of smile that Dean’s been thinking about for the last few weeks – soft and fond and reserved just for him. “You want to kiss me, do you?”
He glances Dean over from his head to his toes, his eyes never lingering as he stands. “Tend to yourself. I will check on the children to make sure you didn’t rouse them. You may stay here the night if you prefer.”
But Castiel can barely focus on the movie. He’s caught up in the weight of Dean’s head on his shoulder and the warmth bleeding through his t-shirt against his side. Dean’s fingers twitch in his sleep and Castiel rubs his thumb over his knuckles, more fascinated with the calluses he can feel on his fingertips and palm than the movie.
The mayor had contacted him through messenger nearly a fortnight ago, begging for his assistance when they first noticed that the children who frequent the streets had gone missing. No one noticed it
While he’s reaching up to get the potted plants on the top of the bookcase, one of the bound books on one of the shelves catches his eyes. It’s a neat leather thing with some kind of gold filigree twisting along the spine. There’s no name, but Dean can’t resist taking a peek. Cas does, after all, usually have pretty damn good taste in books. He’s the one who got Dean into Vonnegut and those practically changed his life. This one is new. Dean hasn’t seen it on the shelf before and he’d like to think that he knows Cas’s collection pretty well. It’s ridiculously big and it’s only the new things go on the shelves upstairs. All the others are downstairs on the cases lining Cas’s bedroom walls.
weird. This might be about more than just money. He resolves to get started with looking into John’s business dealings in the morning. Maybe Dean can help him out with that too.
He can’t see the man’s reaction, but he does lean in closer. His hand comes up and covers Dean’s throat, squeezing lightly. For a moment, Dean thinks he’s going to choke him, but he stops. “How badly do you want to live?”
Getting on that plane and flying across the country was quite possibly the most nerve-wracking thing Castiel has ever done. Even more so than when he realized he was falling for his online friend and confessed his feelings. That had been a harrowing day and required practically every ounce of his courage to send the message he’d been writing and building on for
being a Satyr, but they don’t mind me hoarded together and mocked. It’s an easy life, certainly, but it’s not a
Cas reads the message probably a hundred times over before he takes a deep breath in through his nose and out through his mouth. Dean grins and pats him on the shoulder. “That’s right, Cas. Just keep breathing.”
He wonders if someone would think him crazy for not being scared of Dean right now. There is every possibility that if he pushes Dean’s buttons too much, he could be the next one on the table. And yet, Castiel knows that Dean would never hurt him. He knowsthat Dean loves him too much for that to ever happen. And this isn’t the first time over the years that they’ve had this fight before. It always works out in the end. Castiel just needs to remind Dean that he can’t be so selfish. He can be rather childish sometimes. Now happens to be one of those times and Dean refuses to hand over the knife.
When they have their cure, Dean will have to ask. Dean likes Cas and enjoys spending time with him here. He wants Cas to be safe and free and he’d very much like that Cas be all of that
Sounds are getting duller and the room is getting darker, despite the flames licking at the remains of the wendigo. He can barely make out the shapes getting closer across the room. People, from the looks of it. A half dozen, maybe more. Only one of them keeps approaching, stepping over the wendigo pile like it’s no big deal that part of it is still on fire or something. Dean can only make out bits and pieces of the man – a trench coat to his knees, stubble, and sharp blue eyes that spark with something almost inhuman. Although that could just be him on the brink of death and all.
necessary. Long before Cas is actually ready, he starts rocking back against Dean’s fingers and muffling unrestrained noises into the pillows. Dean endeavors to draw new ones from him with every stroke and stretch of his fingers and hands, raining kisses across his lower back.
A ridiculous little laugh bubbles up in Dean’s throat and he knocks his head back against the door. “God
There’s a pot of oil hanging suspended from a nail in the wall next to the bed. Dean knew this day was coming and he made sure that he was well prepared. He knew – Sam knew –
He’s not sure which of them sighs with relief when he rocks back on his heels, giving them both room to breathe, but Cas’s eyes are warmer now and there’s a smile on his swollen lips. “I was beginning to wonder if you were ever going to come for me.”
Cas tucks his hands into his pockets and leans in closer, eyes narrowed in a squint that manages to be both suspicious and curious all at the same time. “What is it about you, Dean Winchester, that made me save your life? I’d very much like to find out.”
“You’re not seriously going to wait, are you?” Dean whispers in his ear on the way to the car. “I can whip in and find Sam in a heart beat. If he’s in there, you can’t just
“I would rather take the stairs.” Cas doesn't meet Dean's eyes while he tries pulling his arm free. “For the exercise.”
“Flattery will not get me out of this bed sooner than my alarm.” Castiel yawns and rubs his knuckles into his eyes. “And
Fine. If Sam won't believe him, Dean'll pull out the big guns. “Of course I'm sure. You should've seen how he blushed the first time we jerked off on camera together.”
“I am a protector of the realm and slayer of dragons.” Dean slashes the air with his sword and points it at the dragon. “The people have summoned me to end your thieving. I won’t let you take another of their young.”
Frowning, the Dragon takes another step. “Why? To my understanding, Wyverns are community creatures. Did you do something terrible? Were you exiled for it?”
At dinner that night, Castiel excuses himself from the table. He doubts his brother-in-law knows that he detours to the office on his way to the bathroom, snagging his laptop in the process. Dean knows all of Sam’s passwords and it has proven to be very useful when looking up their potential targets.
In fact, the more work to keep him occupied, the less time he’ll be sitting in this apartment, loneliness consuming him.
Dean let’s out a breath he’s been holding. It’s nice not being thought of as a fuck-up by a parental figure for once.
Castiel is looking at Dean’s tee with a confused stare. He brings his eyes up to meet Dean’s, who struggles to hold contact. Then, sincerely, he determines, “no, it suits you, Dean. You look handsome.”
“I had heard of the film and the original musical, but to be honest, I had no idea what it was actually about. From what Charlie’s told me, she’s really piqued my curiosity about it all.” Dean grins at the other boy; Castiel must
Dean stands for a moment, watching as the van grows smaller in the distance, then turning left out of sight. Dean turns on his heel, back to the impala, and phones for a takeaway pizza.
Dean isn’t really a fan of the song, but he’s in high spirits so he sings along in a low voice while he takes more drink orders.
Glancing at the clock over the office door, he notes that it’s 5pm and starts closing up, humming Enter Sandman as he goes. Once he’s satisfied that the place is locked up and organised, he scribbles down a note for Garth – Dean’s colleague who works weekends, giving him duties Dean never got round to (probably due to his afternoon with Castiel on Thursday).
For the first time since meeting him, Dean registers how magnificent Castiel’s smile is. Two perfect rows of straight white teeth, the smallest hint of forming crows feet at the outer corners of his sapphire eyes, making Castiel appear a little older than he probably is. Dean no longer feels intimidated by him, now he’s seen something other than an intense stare.
“Wow, so enthusiastic. Save some of that energy for church,” his older brother responds sarcastically.
The bar is warm and cosy; illuminated with the soft glow of yellowish-white fairy lights. It takes a minute or so of Dean searching the place for Charlie – Castiel doesn’t know what she looks like so he just kind of stands there.
He thanks Sam for his concern, and again apologises for being rude to John – for Sammy being the messenger for him.
The three chat briefly about the band’s song choices before Gabriel jokes that his brother can’t shut up about Led Zeppelin at the moment.
“I’m sorry for you both, Dean. Although, to tell you the truth, it’s probably for the best. I may have only met her on a small number of occasions, but I don’t think you brought out the good in each other. There was one time you brought her here and
to meet Jo. He doesn’t mention his 2 year relationship with Lisa which ended less than 24 hours ago.
Dean could see Jo trying to choke back tears, she was always so strong, never let anyone see her like this if she could help it. The older Winchester brother sympathised with her over this, she tries so hard to put on a brave face for Ellen. Similarly, Dean has always prioritised Sammy, sheltering him as much as possible from the aftereffects of their mother; Mary’s death.
He clenches his jaw and is met with another worried stare from Jo’s mom. So he slowly recounts the event of their evening at Cosmo’s.
He rubs his face with one hand – trying to stimulate some sort of awakness in it. With his other hand, he checks his watch.
Sam quickly zips opens his schoolbag which is wedged between his feet and pulls out a folder. He take out a study timetable which is annotated to the point where there’s more black ink than white paper, and waves it comically at Dean, “and besides, I have way too much studying this weekend to even think about go out! Although, if you’re free Sunday, Dean, I could do with some help emptying Jess’ apartment? She’s moving into a new one closer to the hospital so she won’t have to pay that ridiculous bus fare.”
“I suppose I’m eating into your shift now with all this drabble. Go on now – get!” She half points to the entrance to The Roadhouse and chuckles.
Fifteen minutes later, Dean is sitting in the Impala, outside the residence of Castiel Novak. It’s a charming little townhouse, with oak coloured wood panelling, and a garden bursting with colourful blooming flowers. He turns the engine off, leaves the car, and rings the doorbell. Dean’s taken aback when the front door swings open wide.
of me not to,” she murmurs with a patronising tone of voice, shifting to look out the passenger side window.
Jessica isn’t required back at the hospital until Tuesday, so she works with the brothers to pack up the remaining boxes and furniture into the transit van. Sam gives tiny Jess a boost into the vehicle, before jumping into the driver’s seat. He and his girlfriend give Dean final thanks, and set off to Jessica’s new place – which thankfully is ground floor, so additional assistance won’t be needed for the moving-in process.
“It was so great meeting you, Castiel! Don’t be a stranger, ‘kay? Dean – promise me you won’t let him be a stranger!”
Dean knows that Charlie will be disappointed if he doesn’t put any effort into his appearance – she will most likely be in cosplay after all; and so, Dean has bought a graphic T-shirt, depicting Tim Curry sitting cross-legged on a throne, dressed in his Frank N’ Furter costume. This way, Dean can sport some merch, without totally embarrassing himself.
The wooden panels which make up the exterior of the structure are painted a soft lilac, with the front door baby blue in colour - unusual for a church. Dean’s eyes are drawn to the right side, on the lawn – where a sign has written in bold black lettering;
“Actually, yeah. They’re doing a performance of ‘The Rocky Horror Show’ at The Folly next month and I was wondering if you’d be interested in that kind of thing?”
Dean Winchester is never one to abandon someone in need. What’s an extra hour a day? Yeah he has work at The Roadhouse, but if Dean wakes up an hour earlier, he can get the extra workload out the way. That way, he’ll still have time to unwind before his evening shifts at the bar.
The man dashes to the bathroom where he keeps his clothes and throws on a plain black t shirt and jeans. He doesn’t have time for his morning (soon to be afternoon) coffee; he decides he can grab one at the record store. Dean Winchester thanks his lucky stars that Benny is still away visiting family. He just hopes none of the locals phone Benny, curious as to why the store is still closed.
piece of music Dean Winchester has suggested. He would say he especially loves this song due to its Christian symbolism. In actuality, it’s because Dean stated it was one of his favourites. It’s a far cry from Bach and Chopin.
Lisa gestures to herself then Dean, “-is just not working. It hasn’t for a long time and you know it too.” Her deep brown eyes connect with Dean’s finally.
He groggily throws on a black leather jacket and ties his boot laces before heading out the door. He considers going straight to the Impala, but Dean thinks he’ll walk to dad’s instead; he can’t bear John getting onto him about something he’s overlooked. On one occasion, John made Dean feel guilty about forgetting which type of break fluid the car took.
And so, Dean takes Castiel’s money, thanks him for his purchase and says goodbye to the two brothers. Castiel offers himself a final glance back at the store once outside and smiles genuinely at Dean.
“Castiel was actually looking for inspiration, sick of the same music he’s listened to for years,” Gabriel interrupts. He looks to his brother and nods, a cue for him to explain.
Bela has light caramel coloured skin, and sandy hair which rests against her collarbone. Dean learns she works in real estate and has known Gabriel for a long time.
“So you’re not gonna talk to me. Do you still wanna go to dinner?” Probably not the best thing he could have come out with.
‘Hey Lis baby. I’m so sorry I haven’t been talking much this last week, work has been so hectic. Dinner at Cosmo’s Wednesday night?’ He thinks for a moment, figuring out when he’s not required at The Roadhouse.
“Dean!” John sounds... Chipper? It’s been a hot minute since Dean’s felt happy to be seen by his father.
“No really, it’s okay! You’re welcome. It’s nice when someone shows interest in music I’m passionate about. My little brother’s more interested in early 2000’s stuff. Can’t be doing with that really.”
Dean’s eyes have shifted to look at the floor, he’s peeling off the paper label from his beer bottle. He does sometimes think of guys, but he assumed most guys did? He loves women, everyone knows that about Dean. It’s just sometimes, he finds himself getting off to the odd picture of a hot guy – big deal.
Dean scratches the back of his neck, and tells his father he’ll take a coke. His hands are beginning to feel a little clammy so he hopes the coke will cool him down. He’s surprised when John even puts it in a glass with ice –
Ellen rolls her eyes. She’s as much a workaholic as her only daughter is; Jo gets that from her. Dean supposes she immersed herself into her job even more after her husband passed. Dean understands that; when he and John were at their worst, he would throw himself into various projects for Bobby – fixing cars here and there, deliveries, etc.
He knows that the relationship has been a little rocky recently, but Dean blamed that on both of their busy schedules. Him working two jobs, and her; a full time nurse. He isn’t entirely sure what his girlfriend is saying.
Jo’s expression turns to a thoughtful one, before she decides, “yeah, you know what? I will, maybe Las Vegas did me some good, ‘eh?” She pulls out a basket from under the bar and rakes for a moment until she finds a red feathered duster. She thrusts it to Dean, “you can be an absolute
When Castiel exits the bathroom feeling a lot lighter and comfortable, Charlie is leaning against the theatre’s lobby wall; waving to get his attention. “’Ya feeling better?” she asks.
Dean gulps anxiously, “look, dad; I believe that you believe you’ve changed. I just don’t know if I can trust you again – I know I don’t deserve to be put through any of that same old crap. Sammy doesn’t either. But I’ll give you a chance; one chance – not for you, but for
He awakes to a clatter. His eyes blink open, Dean groans when he discovers he’s kicked over an almost full bottle of beer; its contents slowly creeping across the floor.
you ain’t stopped since you took over this joint!” He waves his arm dismissively round the building’s interior. “How about you take the rest of the night off, it looks like it’ll be a slow one, no need for us both to be here.”
Castiel’s heart skips a beat when Dean casually throws an arm around his waist, pulling the three of them into a tighter hug. He wants to remain in this moment forever, but it ends as abruptly as it began. They wave Charlie off and begin to walk towards the Impala.
“-and as for Lisa... I sound like a broken record; but me and Lisa just ran our course, right? So, can we please just leave it and watch another movie?”
Jo props herself up and sits cross-legged next to the boy, “hey, it’s okay you know? If you do. Is that why you broke up with Lisa?”
The search brings up only 2 or 3 profiles – the first one he’s certain is the boy from the store. He clicks on the page, and surely enough it’s him. Castiel's heart warms at the profile picture and enlarges the image. The picture is of Dean, smiling sheepishly, sitting in a bar, sitting next to a stunning dark haired girl, his arm around her. On his other side, is a younger boy, who bears some resemblance to Dean... His younger brother, Sam perhaps?
“Ah- you’ll love Charlie, Cas! Just be prepared to be exhausted by the end of the night with her limitless enthusiasm,” Dean jokes as he holds the door open for Castiel and follows him inside.
The brothers say their goodbyes, and Dean gets up to make a coffee. Maybe a dose of caffeine will keep the tiredness at bay.
This ground the boy back to reality. He opens his mouth and blurts back, “I’m not gay! I mean... I had a girlfriend, we broke up not too long ago. Not that there’s anything wrong with being...”
Wolfing down his dinner, Dean manages to catch the last 15 minutes of the latest episode of ‘Doctor Sexy M.D.’ When he’s finished, he carelessly throws the plastic food container in his kitchen trash can and heads out to Ellen’s bar.
“Yeah, no worries Dean-o. Oh, and another one for my lady friend!” Dean does a double take between Gabriel and the frankly
He’s thought relationships with girls is the only kind of relationship he can have. The last few days though, Dean has been finding himself thinking about boys more than girls. Ladies man, Dean Winchester – crushing on Patrick Swayze, and Castiel –
Ellen had finally had enough, and decided to split the cost with Bobby on a non refundable vacation.
He’s taken away from Robert Plant’s powerful vocal chords by the loud vibration of his cell phone. Castiel doesn’t bother to prop himself up, lazily he reaches for the device in his bed-side table, and squints at the caller ID before accepting the call.
Jessica shows up at her apartment sometime in the early afternoon; she was working an early morning shift at the hospital’s trauma unit. Dean liked Jessica from the moment Sam sheepishly introduced her to him, a bubbly, smart, and beautiful girl – he wonders how his little brother got so lucky.
cosplay – you won’t be embarrassed to be seen with me?” Dean loves Charlie, she’s not afraid of having a good time.
“Likewise - I like your shirt, very fitting,” Castiel points at Dean’s tee. He’s beginning to feel a little self-conscious about his baggy shirt; when the other boy looks so carelessly dapper. He looks down at the top, stretches the bottom of it to look at the design, and mumbles,
He doesn’t want to appear too eager to talk more about Cas, so he doesn’t press Gabe further about his brother.
“Okay, okay. What does everyone want? Charlie?” Charlie and Castiel have sat down, while Dean offers to get a round of drinks.
Dean tells the men to ‘wait right there’ while he checks the stockroom. He reappears, clutching David Bowie’s 1977 masterpiece, ‘Low.’
He leans over the passenger seat and opens the door for her with an apologetic smile. “Baby, I know I’m late, I’m sorry! There was this fuckin’ mis-hap at the store – and Benny left me in charge, it just threw my whole plan off, Lis!”
Dean is the colour of beetroot by this point so he promptly excuses himself and stresses to the couple to have a good evening.
He learns that although Castiel is the youngest; he was protective of Anna in their childhood years. He tells Dean about her wedding to Abel, who runs a neighbouring church choir.
He doesn’t necessarily want to go home right away, so Dean makes for a nearby delicatessen as his stomach is growling now that his nervousness has subsided.
He doesn’t charge Castiel for the last record (another thing he won’t be admitting to Benny). He’s very appreciative of this, and keeps thanking Dean for the ‘gift’.
Castiel is lying on his bed on Thursday evening, eyes closed, tapping his foot to the rhythm of Led Zeppelin’s ‘Stairway to Heaven.’ He loves this one. He likes
The rest of the morning is relatively quiet – it is a Monday after all. Dean checks his watch; it’s now 11:55am so he locks up the place and takes a walk to the corner store where he usually buys his lunch. Settling on a turkey sandwich, a small cherry pie slice, and yet another coffee; he makes his way back to Benny’s.
“Not much really, I couldn’t help but notice that you took a liking to my good friend Dean the other day... Did you go back for seconds?” Gabriel is always teasing his little brother with suggestive tones, it’s a running joke that Gabriel is a womaniser while Castiel is...
He half expects the other man to decline his offer, he’s only here for the vinyl records after all. He’s pleasantly surprised when Castiel accepts, with a request for 2 teaspoons of sugar.
As soon as he finished work last night, he crashed on the sofa. He stayed there until he woke this morning at 9am. After groggily throwing on fresh clothes, Dean brews himself a strong black coffee. Slumping back down onto the couch, he hears his phone’s message tone.
He answers, “Hey Dean, apologies for callin’ you so late. I’ll cut to the chase; I’ve had a bit of bad news today, my dad’s had, what’s assumed to be a heart attack... I need to head down to Nashville and see him, you understand? So I need someone to take care of the store for the next week or so. I know you’re there for your usual 8 hours, but I’d
Dean, who is still watching the two men walk away into the distance, is interrupted by a loud text alert; making him jolt. He checks his cell phone.
Dean matches his baggy, burgundy t-shirt with some black skinny jeans and a black leather jacket. After styling his short, sandy hair, and patting some aftershave over his jawline; Dean Winchester thinks he’s looking pretty decent.
Dean has somehow made it to Sunday. He and Jo didn’t fall asleep until after mid-day on Saturday, and he spent his evening shift at The Roadhouse in a state of murder. Jo – being the superhuman that she is, doesn’t get hangovers, so she spent all of Saturday ripping the shit out of Dean for wearing sunglasses.
day at the record store, and it’s Friday, so he just has tonight and tomorrow at The Roadhouse before his day of rest.
Charlie, Dean, and Castiel are finally seated slap bang in the centre of the theatre. Castiel feels that he
His heart sinks when Castiel makes the connection between the pretty boy and the girl at his side in his picture. He scrolls a little further and surely enough, there’s tagged photographs posted by Lisa Braeden, starring Dean Winchester. If Castiel had any doubt; there’s even one of them
” Castiel has left his phone on his bed while he goes to tuck Led Zeppelin safely back into it’s sleeve.
The two men arrive at The Folly a little later than Charlie; she texted him to let him know she'd be sitting in the theatre bar.
“Lis? Lisa?” Again, no response. Lisa is staring ahead, refusing to even sneak a glance in the man’s direction. Dean racks round his brain for what to say next.
“Sam?!” He takes notice of his brother’s vacant expression. Or what Dean assumes is a vacant expression; the dude is facing the window.
When he returns from the kitchen, he jumps slightly at the figure standing by his desk. It’s Gabriel’s brother, Castiel. He didn’t hear him enter.
“So that’s why I’ve been so damn busy, I got the phone call from them telling me I got the job when we were in Vegas, so it was a fucking great place to celebrate!”
The blue-eyed boy chews his bottom lip a little and closes the laptop lid. Gabriel was right, Castiel can’t get his hopes up. And yet... He had never felt a connection – an
“-and... I suppose, I was looking to get into something different. These ones look... intriguing,” Castiel glances over to where he was standing a moment ago.
“You work here too?” Gabriel points at the desk which is currently occupied by Dean’s unfinished lunch, “It’s Dean... right?”
Lisa has been unhappy for months. Dean knows this, and yet; he still can’t quite believe she’s gone. Outside of Sammy, Benny, and the Roadhouse Crew; Lisa was a constant. No matter how shitty or neglectful he could be – she was always there. There for him when it mattered. He can’t say the same for himself. He fucked it up, and there was nothing now he could do to fuse the broken threads back together. That rope had snapped.
Dean cracks up when he realises the other man is serious, “Cas, not for nothing, but your taste buds must be shit, because this coffee is the worst. I should actually apologise for brewing you a cup.”
After a painfully tense car ride, the two are seated at Cosmo’s; the reservation held long enough. Dean is two fingers of good scotch down, tucking into his calzone. His paycheck doesn’t quite allow for extravagances, but he definitely needs the whiskey tonight. Lisa is pushing pasta salad around with her fork, with a tired, absent expression. She’s barely said a word to her boyfriend since they entered the restaurant; and now she gently lays her cutlery down.
Dean takes in the rest of Castiel’s appearance. He’s wearing a pair of black skinny jeans and a thick, white turtleneck sweater. His composure leads Dean to believe that Castiel is shy.
“I figured. My brother referred to it as ‘pretty gay,’ I thought he meant it in a derogatory way. But no, I guess he was right.”
. I was saying, I could take you down for your first beer with me? I mean I know you’re only 18 but jesus Sammy, when I was your age I had built up a tolerance enough to rival a bull.” Dean doesn’t know why he bothered asking Sam. Truthfully, he just missed how close he was with his younger brother when they were still living under the same roof, hell, Dean even missed his rancid farts and his bitchy whining about his studies. He knows the answer he’ll get from his younger brother.
“Hmphf,” Castiel grumbles, adjusting himself to lie on his side, he puts the other man on loud-speaker, “what can I help you with?”
The man laughs; if he finds the conversation awkward, he ain’t letting it show. “Actually, my family and I moved here in 2005, but we were all home-schooled and never really mingled with anyone outside the church. Having such a tight family unit your whole life can smother you; so I decided to moved to St. Louis when I was 17, stayed there until last month, doing cash in hand work here and there, ya know? Back now though... “
Dean keeps himself busy pulling pints of beer, and mixing the odd cocktail on occasion. His mood has improved again since he’s the only guy on duty. No offence to Jo, or Ash; but sometimes Dean just likes to do his own thing and get into a rhythm while he works. He can’t exactly do that when he’s yelling over music to gossip with his co-workers.
At least Dean can look forward to Castiel coming to the store hopefully this week, surely he’ll be itching for more records. Hell, it's so
“We settled for each other. Goodbye Dean.” With that, she leaves. He assumes she'll probably call a cab home.
– Dean thinks. He worries that he’ll put his back out with the effort he and Sammy are putting into this.
“Looking forward to it?” Dean is nudging Castiel’s right arm. They’re waiting for the stage curtains to open.
Castiel likes to move around when he’s on the phone, he doesn’t even notice he’s doing it. He closes his bedroom curtains and thumps back down onto his bed. “Well, I actually went back to the record store today, and I bought a couple more vinyl.”
Dean’s head is again filled with white noise; he thought this guy had calmed down a little on the intensity. He was wrong. “Uhhh... Sammy! He’s 18 – Sammy’s 18.”
Dean remembers all the neglect he suffered as a young boy in that house. It looks like a warm and welcome place now that John has apparently gotten his act together – peeling wallpaper has been replaced, kitchen is actually stocked with groceries, and it doesn’t stink of booze and cigarette ash anymore. The memories are still too strong to feel any comfort there, but maybe he could one day.
Dean promptly responds with a time. He’ll get Lisa around 6pm. Maybe after dinner she’ll invite Dean to stay the night. Beats watching crappy TV at his house.
Around 10pm, a scruffy looking man with sandy brown, floppy hair waltzes in. He orders a scotch on the rocks and since he’s the only customer currently in the premises, he sits on a stool right by the bar, hoping to spring some conversation into the barman.
The rest of Dean’s week passes, the days intertwining and merging together. Come Sunday, he’s huffing and puffing, carrying one end of a heavy brown fabric sofa down 4 flights of stairs, while Sam takes the opposite side.
“Yeah, we’ve always been close knit. Dad wasn’t around much when we were younger so I think I felt a lot of responsibility for him. We don’t see each other everyday like we used to though, I live on my own now, and Sam is busy with his girlfriend whenever he has a second free,” Dean realises he doesn’t discuss his personal life with anyone he doesn’t consider family.
Apologies for my grammar sometimes, I'm in the UK so some words are spelt slightly different than the US, but I try my best.
“Jesus, man, gimme a second! We just talked about the usual. This doesn’t mean I’ve forgiven anything yet, Sam, okay? He let me – ‘
“Dean, you know how I feel about drink. Dad is doing so well nowadays and I’m really proud of him. I don’t think he wants to see his past behaviour mirrored in his son.” Sam must see Dean’s face fall. Dean thinks that Sam is having a dig at him for his own drinking behaviour and obvious strained relationship with John.
Walking back to the table with a tray of drinks; Dean watches as Charlie and Castiel are engrossed in friendly chatter, he’s glad they’re getting along.
Dean moves further across the store, checking for empty spaces as he goes. He notices some records are out of place; picking one up he flips it around and reads the cover.
Its roughly 10 minutes later and Dean has opened the store to the public for the day. Slight hangover creeping upon him, he takes a couple Oreos from the office hoping sugar will help, and slumps down at his seat by the store counter.
future. I can’t sit around and wait for you, Dean – not anymore. I’m tired. I should have said something sooner, I’m sorry about the dinner.”
“Well I suppose I better head off. Was nice meeting you, Dean-o. Until next time!” Gabriel slaps the table with his hands to push himself away from the empty bar.
even stop to look at this place, it’s a very cliquey establishment – not that we’re not friendly here! Love a fresh face!”
“Sex on the beach, a-thank you.” The only folk who order those type of drinks are either young women, or gay men.
After a multitude of wardrobe changes and enough swearing to make a nun sweat, Dean is outside the apartment of Lisa Braeden – and 20 minutes late. As he pulls the car over, he feels a pang of guilt for not texting her beforehand – letting her know he was running behind.
“Ahhh, rock and progressive rock?” Dean is glad Castiel shows an interest in these genres. Most people who come in are looking for the newest releases. Not that Dean doesn’t enjoy some Taylor Swift now and then. It’s just nice to have his extensive rock knowledge come in handy once in a while.
Walking to the kitchen’s island, Dean picks up his phone and checks to see if either Castiel or Charlie have texted. Charlie has;
“Hi, sorry. Did I frighten you?” The blue eyed man’s face is primarily blank, aside from a hint of concern at Dean’s reaction.
They walk Charlie to her car and she throws her arms around the two men; bringing them into one big embrace.
“I’ll let dad know you didn’t mean it. Although, you really should talk between yourselves. I think you’d be surprised.”
Dean’s mind fog clears as he takes in what Blue Eyes is asking. “Oh! Yeah, the music! Well lemme think... I reckon since you enjoyed Low, you’d enjoy the other two records in his Berlin Trilogy. You could start out with Heroes, then move onto Lodger? Both are great also – and Heroes has a few good instrumental pieces.”
Finished with his sandwich, Dean is about to tuck into that delicious looking pie when the shop door bell rings; alerting the man that someone has entered the premises.
A couple of minutes later Dean’s cell rings; it’s Sam. The man grumbles under his breath - he texted Sammy, why can’t he just text back like a normal teenager instead of phoning? He begrudgingly answers,
Dean waves the man off and because of how quiet The Roadhouse is tonight, he gets ready to close up early; grabbing himself a small beer can to drink as he does so.
I expected, but I love it so far,” Castiel smiles. He’s taking his time on the staircase, being careful not to let his feet disobey him.
Dean chuckles and promptly texts her back, letting her know all is good, and he’ll meet her at The Folly at 6pm. The show starts at 8pm but Charlie is insistent that she meets Castiel properly beforehand, so they’ll meet her in the theatre bar. He glances at the time on his cell – it’s now 4:30pm, plenty time since it’ll only take him roughly forty minutes to drive to Kansas City.
Dean isn’t sure about Castiel, something about that blue eyed boy sets something in motion within Dean.
“Yeah. We’re just not enough for each other anymore I guess,” Dean tries to hide the sadness in his words. He knows Sam means well, but he can’t have his baby brother thinking he can’t manage.
. The vacation was for two people, so naturally Charlie was my plus one. It was good; we went to the Natural History Museum, had a few drinks at the Bellagio – Dean that place is sooooo expensive, we spent almost a quarter of our holiday cash on one evening there, I could have
“Yeah, well... Nothing better to be doing on a Friday night when you’re single is there?” She says dismissively. “Just - don’t tell mom I was here, ‘kay? She thinks I work too much.”
It’s Sunday 21st of July, the show is tonight, and Dean will admit, he is nervous to see Castiel. He had hoped the boy would have popped into the store over the last couple of weeks, but he never did. It’s not as if the two hadn’t been in contact – they text almost every day – and Dean is often the one to instigate the messages; which surprises him as that was one of his vices when he was with Lisa. Dean understands that Castiel has been busy helping his father at Celestial Hope, but he misses his company during those long and sometimes quiet shifts.
Jo and Danny had been high school sweethearts, they went to prom together, graduated together, they even shared an apartment together. That is until Jo found Danny in bed with Ruby a little while ago. Dean sympathises with Jo; it’s got to be hard carrying on without who you thought was your soulmate – even if he did cheat.
“So what’s your plan for the rest of the night?” Dean allows a sideways glance in Castiel’s direction, but he’s sound asleep – head tilted to one side, leaning against his own shoulder. Dean feels his heart go soft for the man.
. His hair is still a little scruffy, but he thinks the boy suits it; matches his character. Dean can’t help but feel the corners of his lips betray him as they creep into a grin.
Castiel’s voice is like being engulfed in a warm wool blanket on a winter’s day with the crackle of a roaring fire. It's soft, comforting, but also a little rough and raspy. Which is probably why Dean’s stomach flutters a little at him using his vocal chords to shape and sound Dean’s own name. “Wait, what?” Is all he can muster.
The bulb goes out completely, and Ellen descends down the ladder, “it’s a new one but it looks like Ash ain’t installed it right.” She faces Dean and gestures to the problem, “you do it, please. I should’ve just gotten you to fix it in the first place, would’ve saved me the hassle.”
Once Dean has washed his hair and scrubbed his body, he allows himself a few minutes to just stand and embrace the hot lashes of water bouncing off his shoulders and down his torso. Skin reddened from the roasting water, and satisfied enough, the man turns off the shower, dries, and opens the bathroom drawer which is filled with his day to day attire.
The older Winchester boy may not have noticed his choice of words, but Jo certainly has. She slowly turns to face Dean, cocks her head to the side and does a full-blown grin. “You jealous bastard! You totally have a thing for Swayze!”
Sam is a little hesitant, “I know, I know... Still it’s so fucking great I don’t need to worry about you guys strangling each other to death. Means you can actually come inside the house whenever I need a ride.”
She cuts him off, “no Dean. This isn’t about work. This is about us. We are on autopilot. We’ve been together two years and you haven’t even given me a key to your apartment? You never want to discuss the future,
“So, Castiel was telling me how you two met; you corrupted him, you bastard,” Charlie puts on a dramatic voice. “Dragging this poor Christian boy to a show about-” she whispers, keeping up the comedic act, “-sinners!”
“Ha! Womaniser are we, Dean? You can’t butter me up, buttercup; I know you too well. Besides, you forget mom left
“She’s a great girl, Dean. If you don’t wanna buckle down and make some sort of inkling that you’re committed; she’ll find someone who will,” Jessica is poking mindlessly at her pasta salad with her fork. The conversation moves to a lighter note. Sammy discusses his plan to apply to Stanford before he graduates, and Jessica, a year into her nursing course, can’t wait to work at the hospital full time.
know. We make it work Lis, I know we struggle – but I can take some time off – we can go away! Ellen would understand-“
Gabriel can sense Dean’s blatant surprise that he’s scored such a stunning lady, and he introduces them.
Whenever Dean brought Lisa along with him to meet his friends, it was more often than not, a painfully awkward experience. And that was with Jo, he couldn’t imagine introducing Lisa to Charlie, talk about chalk and cheese.
Lisa is standing by the mailbox; wearing a body-confident short, black dress which, in Dean’s mind; hugs her figure in all the right places. Her arms are folded, holding her elbows tightly. She’s obviously upset.
which would let him know she thinks he’s an idiot for letting Lisa Braeden go. He gets none of that. Instead, she nods;
He pats Ellen on the arm before ascending the ladder, two steps at a time, “you flatter me, Ellen,” he says enthusiastically.
“I knew you both will have been working hard, so I’ve brought lunch?” Jessica opens her large leather satchel and pulls out 2 brown paper bags containing sandwiches for Sam and Dean.
Ellen Harvelle is a kind woman, but she isn’t a sap. Her gentle tone slides into something a little more stern.
The band have finished up their take on ‘Wagon Wheel,' and have moved onto a slowed down, acoustic version of ‘Roxanne’ by The Police.
Dean was grinning one of those full blown grins which nobody often saw nowadays. He was cruising down the road, Black Sabbath blaring, tapping his fingers on the steering wheel. He turns right to look at his little brother.
The blue-eyed boy pauses, lost for words for a moment. Although born into a pretty religious family, Castiel knows that his siblings wouldn’t
“Uhh, thank you, man. I’m not the owner though, I’m just the dog’s body.” Castiel’s eyes squint slightly, as if attempting to read Dean. Dean feels slightly intimidated.
Dean in turn decides it’s only fair to open up to Castiel. He details his oldest memories of his mother before she passed. He touches a little on his strained relationship with John. He gushes about Sammy and how proud he is of the kid, and strains that Castiel
Dean fiddles with his glass of cola. “Yeah, Lisa. I really thought she was the one, apparently not.”
Dean laughs at Jo’s horrified face; one of his favourite hobbies is shocking the girl. He turns on the television and searches for the movie on Netflix. He’s a self-confessed movie buff and owns the 4K Blu-Ray collector’s edition of Dirty Dancing but he’ll never live it down if Jo knew that.
“You don’t think you deserve happiness. That never gets old. I thought what I said to you before I left was enough to make you understand.” He lets his gaze drift to somewhere beyond Dean’s shoulder for a moment before his eyes settle on Dean again. All mockery gone, it feels like Cas is staring right into that jagged, crudely stitched-up thing that’s his soul. “I meant every word I said. I hoped that someday you’d see yourself the way I see you. It’s all I want for you.”
There’s a burning in his eyes as Dean forces himself to get off the ground, his legs like lead, his heart hammering in his chest when he starts to understand. He perceives the house somewhere up the road, and he starts to walk, slowly, treading his worn-out boots into the pavements and feeling his heartbeat echo in his ears. He knows that house. Even from far away, when he can’t really see it, he knows that he’ll find a bench outside that house, the door will creak just a little because no one ever remembers to oil the hinges, the floorboard next to the flipper machine will be a little bit lose. There’s knife marks on the counter.
There’s a shimmer in his eyes that has nothing to do with the neon light of the street lamp. Suddenly he looks much younger, like he did back then, and it makes Dean wonder how long Cas would have waited here if he hadn’t been so utterly stupid to get killed by a damn piece of iron and vampire clowns.
Of course he will. If anyone should get to Heaven, it’s Sam, but he also deserves a long, happy life so he’ll probably have to wait. It’s okay, he’s got more of his family back than he could ever dream. It’s alright.
It’s that fact that he cannot forgive; although he knows that it was, logically, the right thing to do, the thing Cas
Instinctively, his hand goes to the waistband of his jeans. No weapon. He’s defenseless, alone; it makes the hairs on the back of his neck stand up. He trains his eyes on the nearby hedge; he swears he can hear the leaves rustling. His breath catches in his throat, he can feel every muscle in his body going taut, and then –
The Impala screeches to a halt in a parking spot when the song interrupts his thoughts. Female voices, high notes, moving light spots –
Maybe he’s wrong. Maybe this isn’t the time and place, maybe Cas never meant to wait, how could he, after everything; maybe it really is a closed chapter of a finished story.
For a moment Dean just stands still, absolutely rigid, focusing on his surroundings, the gentle breeze rustling the trees, the distant sound of a humming motor, the cawing of a bird. There’s something eerily familiar about the scenery, and it’s weird because something still feels completely off, yet he can’t put his finger on it.
