“I can’t take care of anybody,” Tony admitted quietly, eyes cast on the cars driving past many feet below them. It was rare he allowed himself moments of vulnerability, but when he talked to Steve...it just slipped out, “I can’t take care of-“
Reluctantly, he pushed the covers off of himself and swung his legs over the side of the bed. With a put-upon, shaky sigh he forced himself to stand, making sure to send Pepper a look that matched as he walked past. After a moment, she cocked an eyebrow and snapped in the direction of the bathroom, speeding Tony up.
long. Getting to let go with Steve was actually a little therapeutic, whether Tony liked it or not, but nothing was as soothing as his Pepper. Even with his still-stinging ass, this was the calmest he'd felt in months. He didn't have shit to worry about it and it was lovely.
Figuring a little coddling couldn’t hurt anything; Steve perched on the side of the bed next to the weeping, mostly-hidden Tony. He’d curled up under his thick duvet, his back shaking pitifully as he cried into his pillow, which he had a death grip on.
“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” some part of Tony’s brain managed to lie, even as his heart started to beat out of his chest. He didn’t know why he was lying; it was clear he was caught. Unfortunately, though, admitting his wrongdoings was never one of his strong points, even in the face of danger.
“We’re done with it,” Steve settled on his decision, giving Tony’s back a few firm pats with the hand resting there, “It’s dealt with so there’s no reason for me to go tattling on you to Pepper; not for something so small. Is that gonna be okay with you?”
The words and the fearful look in his eyes had the anger bleeding out of Steve almost instantly. He couldn’t help it; Anthony was wrong and he deserved to be checked for his behavior, but that didn’t make staying angry with him any easier. He was just too adorable to stay mad. The poor thing just had a lapse in judgment was all, but unfortunately, it was enough for Steve to have to make a tough choice. This was a lesson he rather Tony learned quickly; he wasn’t going to put up with a submissive hitting him in the long run, no matter how cute he was.
was not about to wake him up. The poor thing needed as much as rest as he could get; he'd leave it up to Pepper to wake him when she was ready. With that in mind, he moved very slowly and deliberately as he stood up, keeping a close eye on Tony to assure he stayed asleep.
"I missed you so much," Tony spoke into her chest, voice full of emotion as he gave her a squeeze, "I don't like it when you're gone."
When her face first appeared on the screen, her expression wore concern, but when she saw the submissive's smile she seemed happy to return it, "Hi, my sweet boy. What's going on?"
“Now, thank you for doing as you were told for me, Anthony. Good boy,” Steve made sure to praise first because he honestly was expecting more of a fight when he put Tony into his bed. He pouted, of course, but he didn’t argue or just make a break for it, which Steve figured was a small miracle. Once he was done with that, though, he continued to scold, “I understand you don’t want to lie in your bed right now, but I did give you a choice. You made a bad one, so I chose for you.”
a put upon sigh, but that was the only sound Tony made before he tilted his head up and closed his eyes, silently giving Steve permission.
“Mm-hmm,” she hummed her confirmation as she took a sip from her mug, leaning against a countertop across from him, “He’s gotten himself used to sleeping, or not sleeping, whenever he pleases. I’m sure he hated being made to actually lie down last night, which explains the tantrum. Usually, though, when I’m here, I try to keep him on a schedule. If it’s routine, he doesn’t fight it as hard and the nightmares aren’t so bad.”
Tony tried to brace himself for them, but it was no use. When Pepper started in with her hairbrush, Anthony lost his little slivers of composure. What was once just wiggling toes turned into kicking feet and noisy cries very quickly, "Pepper,
in a way - Tony had pretty much associated the feeling with the end of his punishment; absolution, "We're all done, now. You can get up whenever you're ready and we'll lay up on the bed."
He considered grabbing an orange or something small for Tony, but he decided not to push. Technically, he didn’t really know how much Tony ate that day (or, well, the previous day) so he just decided to hope that it was plenty. If Anthony was as finicky about food as Pepper implied, it wasn’t going to end well, anyway.
Steve was thrilled to see that the sub didn't even stir, still letting out soft little puffs of breath against his pillow. Steve took a moment to admire him, much like he had the night before, before deciding to go looking for Pepper. He wanted to meet her without Tony's company, especially with the mood he knew Tony would wake up in.
“Uh…” he couldn’t stop himself from stammering again, pulling his duvet back up some to cover his exposed legs, “…What other thing?”
“I know you’re sorry, Anthony,” Steve informed him, giving the back of Tony’s neck a squeeze. When he relaxed further under his hand, Steve continued, “I understand how hard this is, buddy, I really do. But you
A familiar lump formed in his throat as he realized it was almost time.  At least using the bathroom would give him a few minutes to stall. Plus his morning wood was tight in his boxers, so he knew he needed to take care of that, first, anyway.
A flicker of excitement and hope forced him to bite back a goofy smile. As good as it all seemed, he had to remind himself that this was not, nor was it ever going to be that easy. He had to slow himself to Tony's pace, however slow that may be. And he knew it would be a while. As much as he loved the side of Tony he was getting to see, he would be back to bratting and pushing and fighting him at every turn by morning.
"You need to be sleeping instead of watching movies, y'know," Steve offered nonchalantly, pressing his fingers firmly against the submissive's scalp and he pulled him against his chest. Tony’s eyes fluttered shut as he leaned into the touch, but he just made a
"Uh-huh," Tony agreed quietly, now blushing slightly and avoiding his eyes. The grip he had on Steve's shirt hadn't changed and despite his shyness, his nerves weren't getting any worse. Once he was done observing the submissive for any signs of a breakdown, Steve pushed the tight pants down his thighs.
“I love you, more,” she responded like it was second nature before playfully adding, “You’re ready for bed, huh?”
“Mhm,” Tony allowed himself to answer, trying not to purr in response to the touch. Yeah, he was definitely touch starved and it definitely felt better than he remembered. At that moment, he hoped Steve would never stop touching him. He didn't care if that made him needy or not.
"I'm going to talk to Steve to make sure he can take care of you as well as possible because I know you don't like to make that too easy on people," Pepper explained truthfully, lifting the camera to show her not-so-pleased face as she continued, "Anything we've said about you or will say about you in the future when you're not listening is just us talking about what's in your best interest. You know better than to think anything otherwise."
"Thank you, attitude," Steve said, taking the phone from the sub's hands. His tone was calm, but Tony didn't like the look he was giving him.
"I know," Steve quickly appeased her, tone soothing as he continued, "I know he's not. That isn't what I meant. I'm just saying; don't beat yourself up when you're doing the best you can."
It hurt Steve's heart to think someone could do something like that to Tony, or anybody for that matter. It hurt Steve's heart even more to think that Anthony
“He, uh…apologized, too. For the way he’s been acting,” Steve continued once he realized Pepper wasn’t going to speak, only shocking her more. He understood; that part was the most stunning for him, too.
acceptable, but thankfully, Steve refrained. Not only did he not want to end up on Pepper’s bad side for daring to touch her sub, but he wasn’t comfortable with it. He would be one day – and hopefully, that day would come before he tried to hit him again – but for the time being, he had to take a different route. Even though he’d lost his temper, he was still as fragile as glass and Steve knew he didn’t need to swat him to get his point across.
he can not properly consent to right now, if there is a single hair out of place or a mark on that boy, so help me
and he couldn't wait to spend the rest of his life avoiding him. Well, once he got him out of his house, that was.
“That's what you think, Anthony?” he pressed once he was sure he wasn't going to explain any further, keeping his tone as calm and gentle as ever. He didn’t want Tony to spook and push them three steps backwards, "Why do you think that?"
and be a good boy. Unfortunately for him, pleasing and being a good boy meant getting ready for bed. So, he did.
“No, buddy, not yet, not if you don’t want to,” he stopped to face Tony, giving him a soft smile, “You can sit with me as long as you promise to try to get some sleep. We can’t stay up all night watching Star Wars, no matter how appealing that may seem to you. It is bedtime, Anthony, okay?”
"Good. I'm just making sure is all," Pepper stated before pulling away from Tony and standing up from the bed, "Did you eat last night?"
did, but an actual infraction. Despite Pepper’s absence, he’d actually considered himself doing well. Was his behavior good? No, not in the slightest. But, he hadn’t done anything
Pepper seemed pleased to hear that, moving to grab two mugs from a cabinet. It was clear that she knew the kitchen well, “He didn’t give you any problems, then?”
As long as Pepper never found out, he was content. Before he could say anything, though, she was giving him a concerned look, “But he didn’t hurt you, right?”
"For the most part, yeah," Pepper sighed, confirming Steve's suspicions, "He...has a lot of trauma, to say the absolute least. And he almost always refuses to talk about it. If he does have a bad one, just make sure he knows he's safe and try to distract him. And you need to ask if he wants to talk about it. He won't, I'm sure, but on the off chance that he does, you should ask. If he actually wants to lighten whatever's going on in his head, then he needs to."
For the first time since he broke down, Tony peeked up enough to look at Steve. It was just so he could look at him like he was crazy, but it was better than nothing.
"Not Rhodey," he finally answered after a few moments of silence, eyes flicking back and forth nervously from Steve to Pepper. He didn't know if that's the answer either of them wanted, but he was sure it's what he wanted. Rhodey was his friend, and he didn't think he should have to deal with this. Granted, he didn't think Steve should either, but he'd rather it be him than Rhodey.
“Oh," Tony was surprised to hear that; Steve liked to annoy him, so he figured he would want to stick around do so for a while, "He left?”
,” Steve paused to squeeze Tony to emphasize how he was being cuddled before he explained what was next, “And then it’s time to go to sleep. It’s time for bed, buddy.”
It had obviously startled the poor thing - something that was clearly very upsetting to the submissive in his current state. Steve cradled him even closer, shushing him softly out of reflex alone. It did the trick and Tony ate it up, burying his face into the man's chest and trying to squirm impossibly closer. Steve's hormones were going nuts; he could feel them bonding, intentionally or not. If the way Tony just kept breathing him in was anything to go off of, he was feeling the same way.
From what Steve could see of Pepper’s face, she looked absolutely dumbfounded. Steve figured that this wasn’t typical behavior for Tony so he predicted that there would be some initial disbelief, but he didn’t really expect her to be so shocked that she was speechless.
"Not just yet, honey," Pepper responded, but her face wasn't in the camera anymore and she sounded distracted, "Why don't you let me talk to Steve for a minute while you go do that? And then we can say good night."
Instinctually, Steve grabbed Tony before he could make another destructive move towards himself or any other property. His grip on him wasn’t too gentle as he pulled Tony further up into his lap, but a gentle touch wasn’t going to get the flailing grown man into his arm. He knew Tony wouldn’t like it, but he figured that his safety took precedence over everything else.
He tried not to dwell on it for the rest of the time they had to talk. Pepper easily took his mind off the subject after he nodded his assent, asking about what he wanted for breakfast the following morning and then stressing to him that he
"Yeah, yeah, I know. I know you say that won't happen but...There's just still a lot you don't know. And he's been hurt more than enough. The more time you spend with him, the further you get over his wall, and the more he's going to care about you. So, if shit hits the fan and you decide you can't handle him...well, where does that leave him?"
Steve chuckled at the Submissive, shifting just enough to reach in his pocket and pull out his phone. Honestly, he was just as thrilled as Tony was. The Sub looked the happiest he'd ever seen him, and Steve wanted him to be happy.
“I know you don’t, Tone,” she comforted softly, even as she tugged his briefs down to his knees with his pants, “I don’t either, but unfortunately we have to because of some decisions you made while I was gone.”
As they waited for Pepper to answer the video call, Tony was still antsy despite Steve’s constant touch. The Dom noticed, giving the nape of Tony’s neck a gentle squeeze. When he felt him relax under his hand, he began to firmly massage the same spot.
Trying not to spend too long marveling at the technology, Steve closed the distance between him and the cabinet and swung it open. As expected, there were plenty of neatly folded, ghost-white cloths on the second shelf. Thankful he didn’t have to ask any more questions, he snatched one out of the pile and went to the sink to wet it. Once he’d completed that task, he headed back into the room to a pouting Tony.
Tony was still fast asleep next to him, only his head poking out from under his covers. It hadn't even been a full two hours since they'd dozed off, so Steve
“Everyone leaves me,” Tony responded in what was practically a whispering tone, sounding utterly miserable. Steve didn't know how to describe his demeanor besides that of an abandoned, scared little boy. He couldn’t help but hug him tighter while he continued. He wasn't sure who the
"This behavior is unacceptable, Anthony Edward, and I will not tolerate it," she followed up with a few more swats before pausing, ignoring his begging, "Just because I'm not here does
And it felt right, too. Despite the fact that he barely even knew him. Tony just fit so perfectly into his arms and loved the attention just as much as Steve loved giving it to him. Steve hadn't had very many subs, not of his own, but he'd done a lot of working with them before and after he came out of the ice. None of them had ever felt so perfect in his arms before, and he knew it
to keep cuddling with the oddly gentle behemoth on the couch and talk to Pepper. It didn't matter what he wanted, though, not then and not to Pepper. She was adamant about him getting enough sleep, something he tended to ignore until he couldn't anymore, but he couldn't fight her this time. It was late and he was stuck in a fuzzy and floaty headspace where he just wanted to
“I think I forget what he’s capable of sometimes,” Steve stated soberly, glancing around at the layout of the floor (or what he could see of it, at least) as he leaned back against the stool, “Or I mean, what he
He just shrugged in response, but he allowed his eyes to stay shut for a while this time. The both of them knew that anything besides a flat out 'no' was a big, fat 'yes'.
"I'm not gonna hurt you, I promise," Steve assured him quietly even though the submissive didn't seem to need it. He was trying to force as much eye contact as he could, wanting to be sure Tony understood what was going on. He'd obviously been through a lot so Steve wouldn't be surprised if he got the wrong idea from the gesture, "I'm just helping you change. That's okay, right?"
going to hurt him. I'm aware of what I'm doing, and I'd appreciate it if you'd allow me the chance to work on him. Is that okay with you?"
When Steve sat down next to his head, Tony tried his best to ignore it. He tried really, really hard. But he felt alone and sad and all of the time he'd spent pretending to be someone he wasn't was finally catching up with him. He needed touch. He could talk to Pepper on the phone all he wanted, but that wouldn’t change the fact that she was on the opposite side of the country. And he
Tony didn’t hesitate to whimper in response, sending a wary look at his bed before looking back towards Steve with a distasteful expression, “Do I have to?”
sick of waiting. He was happy that she was happy, that was for sure, but he would be lying is he said he didn't miss having her to himself. That was selfish, even Tony could see that, so he usually refrained from sharing that information with her. That didn't make it any less true.
Steve was about to offer up the next best option, which was to call Rhodes for him, but stopped when Tony launched his phone at a wall. Before Steve could even react to that display of aggression, Tony began to sob.
Wow so it seems a lot of people actually like this! I really wasn't expecting such a reaction over night, but luckily for you guys I've got the next few chapters outlined and will be able to update fairly quickly.
And once it was happening, nothing else mattered. His eyes had been wet for a while but genuine tears began as soon as she started to spank him, even though it didn’t really hurt yet. It would soon enough, Tony knew that much, and it was already hurting his feelings; he didn’t like upsetting Pepper. It was never in the front of his mind while he was misbehaving, but the fact that he disappointed her always came rushing down on him like a freight train eventually.
“I gave you a choice, Anthony,” Steve told him firmly, despite the overwhelming urge to pick him back up. With a heavy heart, he gently pushed Tony back down to sit when he tried to get up before he continued, “And I think you just made your decision. Go ahead and lay down, please.”
“Okay,” Steve breathed out after reveling in the moment for a little longer, figuring he should get the show on the road before the sun came up, “Do you think you’re ready to get changed?”
“Kay,” he whispered, beginning to both feel and sound utterly miserable. The emotional roller coaster he was riding was beginning to take a toll on him, and he felt like he was about to crash again, “‘m in trouble?”
anyway, this chapter is over 16k words so i hope that makes up for it. :) I won't promise a short wait for the next one, but I can assure you it'll be around as long as this one lol. hope you enjoy!
"Okay, okay," he soothed quickly, embracing him again, "I won't leave, but you still have to change, buddy. Do you need help?"
One thing was for sure, though, and that was that Tony didn't want Rhodey to have to babysit him. He wished he didn't have to inconvenience any of them with this, honestly, but he did, and it wouldn't be Rhodey. It was just...different with him, and they had a different relationship, and he didn't want to change that, so he knew what his choice was going to be.
favorite emotions, and being doomed to a trip over Pepper’s lap made him feel just that. He could cry and tantrum, but that would just make it worse. He could try to run; he’d probably get away, too, but only for so long. Whenever he came crawling back to his Domme’s feet, it would be
Steve knew she was joking, but with some of the behavior he'd already exhibited, he figured there was a little truth to it. He didn't doubt that Tony was hard-headed as hell, red-bottomed or otherwise. The kid was going to need a lot of work.
"Right." Steve confirmed, not realizing that she was expecting an answer for a moment, "He’s just had a few beers, I think. He didn’t seem impaired."
"No, he can't. He tries, but..." she trailed off with a sigh, running her fingers through her hair and giving the tresses a frustrated tug, "There's no way you haven't figured out by now that he can be a huge brat, but for the most part, he's just a big baby.
"First time since you've been back?" she asked, amused, "Because I think that may classify as more than just
“Ms. Potts tried to get through on Mr. Stark’s phone, but it seems he’s smashed it. I explained the situation to her and she’d like to call your phone so she can speak with Mr. Stark immediately. Is that okay?” Jarvis asked, causing Tony to beam.
Tony grumbled a little about how he wasn't tired again but still huddled against his chest as they walked. He did make a noise of protest when he was set onto the bathroom tile, and once Steve stepped back from him he began to whine, "
visibly more upset after Pepper's digital departure, but Steve definitely expected worse of a reaction than he was receiving. If there was going to be a tantrum, it wasn't unlikely that it would be delayed, but at least it wasn't immediate. Preparing himself for the worst, he pushed it to the back of his mind and tried not to fret. He would have to ride out Tony's moods as they came. For now, he seemed fine, so Steve acted accordingly.
He was nodding vigorously against his pillow without a second thought, "Yes'm, I promise! I'll be good!"
Pepper couldn't quite lift Tony, but she did move her hands under his arms and gently push him forward, urging him to crawl up onto the bed. He whined a little more as he slowly pushed himself up, even though he was getting what he wanted. It was just so
"Are we sleepy?" Pepper asked him softly, cradling his head to her chest and resting her chin atop of it, "Do you want to rest for a little bit?"
Much to Tony’s dismay, Pepper shook her head sadly, “Sorry, honey. She can’t get away this time. She misses you, too, though. We'll both be back for good in a few more weeks; you can show her everything then.”
That was much more than what Tony was asking him, though, and Steve surely wasn’t about to pour all of it out.
"She says I'm..." he paused for a moment, obviously trying to force the words out before he just shrugged, "She says what you say."
He eyed him for a while, fresh tears leaking out of his eyes as he considered the option. Steve prepared himself to give it up, ready to accept one more
Steve already knew what the answer was going to be, so he wasn't surprised when Tony whined and forced himself back against his chest, "Noooo!"
"Thank you," he breathed out, sounding much more grateful than he intended to portray, "I don't take that lightly."
"I won't be leaving, Pepper," he assured her quietly, patiently. He was hardly even able to hear her out without cutting her off. A lot had changed while he was in the ice; there were a lot of things he found himself unsure of anymore. However, he was
Steve bit back a smile, rubbing a hand up and down the sub’s back before releasing him from the hug, “Okay, buddy. Let’s go in your room and get you covered up, okay?”
Pepper couldn't stay mad at him about anything that wasn't life or death most of the time, even when he really deserved it. Even when she was she didn’t express it very much, so when they got to a point where she sounded angry, Tony had a bad tendency to work himself up about it.
"I think he's more like 100, actually," Pepper allowed herself to laugh before becoming more serious, "And why aren't you his type, Tony?"
Steve felt his resolve slip even further at Tony’s whimper; he knew he was upset, but not only did he need to behave, but more importantly, he needed to sleep. Steve had to stand firm on that, but he figured he could soften up in other places. After all, this was the closest thing he’d ever done to punishing Tony and if the sub’s reaction was anything to go off of, he was genuinely upset about it.
Steve chuckled and nodded his head as these empty thoughts continued to spill out of my mouth like toxic waste.
As soon as they heard where he was coming from they quickly figured out how long they would be stuck together. At least 8 hours.
"Why do you remember all this Steve, we've been separated well over year, I think you need to move on." Tony responded while fumbling about his breast pocket for his tablets, "I mean I certainly have."
Steve figured the best thing to do was return to the sketch book and continue trying to hide the tear-stained sketches of Tony he had.
“You can’t be alone can you Tony? You bounce from person to person as if its nothing more than money you can squander on coffee. I see it everywhere you just jump from person to person hoping each one will fix the whole left by the last. Left by Howard. But you just blame your failing relationships on everyone else without taking time to realise you’re the common factor. With Pepper, her commitment to the Industries was to blame. With us, Bucky was to blame for you not looking after yourself after everything. You need some self reflection Tony.”
Hi Peter, how was school today? You'll need to get the subway home today. Your parents are in a bit of trouble today. Stuck in an elevator on the way to you know what. How are you feeling about that? They should be out by midnight but its a bit up in the air at the minute. We can speak when you get home tonight. Be safe, I know you will be but you know what I mean.
"Steve do you have any idea how inappropriate it is to kiss me! Thats a violation of my rights! I was completely unaware of what you were doing and its not appreciated at all. Totally, completely, insanely inappropriate. I am one of the few who does not want the great Captain America to push his lips against mines! Do not do it again, capeeshe!" Tony yelled at Steve. "Hey, you understand? Or have you hit your head!"
"Bullshit! You could have asked someone to move, everyone faints at the sight of Steve Rogers, where as everyone runs at the sight of Tony Stark. That's why we're not together anymore!"
"Sorry Tony, it won't happen again, completely forgot my boundaries." Steve whispered. All Steve wanted to do was grab this asshole of a man and kiss him again. Yet the reaction Tony had was like he'd kissed a man back when it was unacceptable to be gay. It made him feel tiny, as though he'd just outed himself back in a time when 'being out' wasn't even a phrase. Kissing Tony made Steve feel, invincible. Like he was going to solve every problem with the world. Even that kiss felt like that, even though the immediate reaction was anything but.
It was also the moment that the heart of the man who was frozen in time, shattered like the ice that surrounded him for 50 years.
After school study support was the worst. Although Peter could get the subway home his Dad insisted on picking up. It was nice having a private driver, but he'd never learnt to drive, and it always drew attention to him. Peter was good at sciences, maths and PE, but English and French absolutely murdered him. His sciences didn't need revision, although French and English took over his life. Considering he'd spent his life listening to his Dad speaking Japanese and Chinese and Spanish, and his Pops speaking some basic French and German, he was atrocious at languages.
It was Tony who suggested a separation. He could see that his moods were beginning to affect morale in the tower. Steve would constantly be in the gym, or visiting Sam. He thought that Steve didn't care for him so much anymore. Yeah he tried to help him stop drinking, but it felt like he only did because they were married. It was a horrible thing to think but in the last few months Tony was almost diagnosed with depression and social anxiety. Tony Stark, the great billionaire, had to sit down in a quiet room after company speeches and get his mind back to normal. When Tony slept he often woke up sweating buckets, with evidence of him being restless. There had even been a few times he'd woken up crying and screaming. But because him and Steve were in different rooms no one knew except him. He wished he could tell Steve, and he knew he could, but Steve was the worst when it came to cheering him up. He resorted to old fashioned jokes about the war, and spoke about how "back in the day". Yes they were married, but sometimes it didn't feel that way. Although Tony still loved him like his husband in these moments, he still loved him till through the separation, but at this moment, being confined in the elevator with him, alone together for the first time in almost a year, Tony wasn't sure if he'd ever loved him more.
Also actually getting back into writing this again. Had a bit of a gap there. But anyway I hope you enjoy, and again, comments are always appreciated!
"Well I guess we'll be here for a while then, its a shame you didn't bring one of those tin suits" Steve mentioned while lowering himself to sit on the elevator floor.
Nothing was helping, his panic attack was getting more and more dangerous. Tony could lash out and start throwing things to help himself, but it wouldn't help anyone. Steve could feel Tonys reactor pumping through his suit, even when on a dangerous mission Steves heart never went this fast. If Tony didn't calm down quickly his reactor could stop working, then they'd have a massive problem. A panic attack was manageable, a heart attack? Not so much.
As soon as Steve heard the voice he tried to close the elevator doors quicker, but it was too late. Tony stuck his hand through the door to get in without realising who was on the other side. As soon as he realised he tried to back out, but was unsuccessful. As cocky as Tony was he was quite timid when it came to uncomfortable situations such as this. Although after a while, he begins to get more than cocky, and he starts arguments to make himself less uncomfortable.
"Sorry Tony, it won't happen again, completely forgot my boundaries." Steve whispered, before looking up from the ground to meet my gaze.In that moment, all I wanted to do was grab him again, and kiss him, although after a year of not speaking I couldn't do it, along with the fact I'd just ranted about boundaries.
"Shit Steve, we can't get out! What if the chains snap and we fall down, we're 7 floors up!" Tony yelled, getting to his feet and frantically looking for a way out.
When I met the super soldier I would one day call my husband though, I instantly saw what my father saw. I was in complete awe of him. The stories, photos and reports of him were nothing compared to actually seeing him. He was one of the most beautiful men I'd ever seen, and still had the charm that so many men lack in the 21st century. He was polite, but forceful. Calm, with a fire inside him. I was instantly infatuated with him. But I was with Pepper, and he was from the time when homosexuality was definitely a no go. I'd come to terms with the fact that the idea of Captain America and I was just a fantasy. Until the celebration party after the New York situation. Pepper had to leave early as she had a meeting in Hong Kong in the morning, so I had the tower to myself and decided to throw a party. I was still uneasy about almost being trapped in some odd galaxy, and being asked about what it was like definitely set me off. But the whole night I felt like Steve had been watching me, I mean I'd definitely been watching him, who could't! As he was leaving I walked him to the elevator. I'd started feeling more comfortable around him then, and as though we could be friends, despite my hidden feelings for him. But as he was leaving the party he leaned in to give me a goodbye hug, me being me though, I totally misinterpreted and planted my lips on his. I instantly realise the mistake and pulled back, but with Steves arms still around me he pulled me back in tightly and picked up from where we left off. One thing led to another and I asked him to stay the night. Not long after I broke up with Pepper, at first she didn't take it well, and it took quite some time before she was fully okay with the fact I was in love with America himself.
Tony was obviously shocked by this, he didn't expect Steve to want to be friends, but he had to keep up the facade that he was over him. Tony knew that if they were friends after the separation he'd make a move again, and it would kill their friendship.
On his way to Korea town he stopped by the river where his familys ashes were scattered. He still wasn't entirely sure if he'd be scattered there, buried in the Stark allotment, or just be buried anywhere like Pops. He was just glad that he didn't have to deal with it, he just had to leave it to his next of kin.
Even with Steve my walls weren't fully demolished. He saw through the gaps, the parts that we'd managed to destroy together. I suppose the remaining bricks were why we fell.
Yet the last five years, when Tony became increasingly aware of his impending death was the ultimate nail in the coffin it seemed.
Yet Steve ruined it, he'd just given his addiction the boost it needed to last another ten years. The kiss was electrifying, it was the kind of kiss you would remember for years to come, all because of the feelings, emotion and passion behind it. Even Captain America got scared sometimes and thinking about the love of his life having a heart attack in an elevator before being able to tell him what he felt, one last time - well that terrified Steve. It made him feel as though he was having a panic attack himself. Watching Tony shivering, struggling to breathe, when his heart was already physically fragile enough, that made Steve emotionally fragile. Thinking about all this brought Steve close to tears, even while Tony was yelling and cursing him, all he could think about was how close he kept coming to losing him. First New York, then the Avengers Civil War. He'd lost Tony as a friend, but losing him as a co-parent, as a partner was more than he could bear. By hell was he losing him completely.
I was obsessed with dying and had actually come to accept it. Although I think the idea of death is toughest for Steve. He'll have to live to see his own son get old before his eyes and bury him. Thats something no parent should ever have to do. Despite the fact I always felt unlucky that I wouldn't be able to live with the love of my life till the end of his life, I always felt lucky in the sense I'd never have to deal with his death, I'd only see him again in whatever afterlife we end up in. If I don't go to Hell that is. Steve has had to see everyone he loved from his old life die, and he wasn't even there to see them grow old. It always hurt to join him at funerals, especially when people would ask who he was, and how he knew the person that had died. Of course they recognised him, but not many people knew that he'd been the subject of an experiment that slowed down his ageing.
"It's not going to be an easy future, Steve," she stressed, calmer but still firm in what she was explaining to him, "I see what you're doing and I am
There was no ‘if you don’t mind me asking’. They’d barely broken the ice before he got straight to the question. Tony couldn’t do much but blanch and stutter in response, causing Steve to chuckle and tell him he didn’t have to answer him. Tony was glad because he didn’t know how to answer him. Nobody had ever asked him that before; he just figured it was obvious.
Shielding his newfound sympathy for the submissive from his expression, he slowly stood up with Tony in his arms. The position he carried him in was awkward, but it was only a few steps before he was dropping him onto his bed. Tony whined once he realized what was happening, reaching his arms up for Steve in a way that broke the super soldier's heart, “No! I don’t wanna go to bed! I–I, I’m sorry!”
The quicker he got all of the bad thoughts out of his head, the better. Steve knew that he wouldn't be feeling too giddy no matter what, but he still wanted to lighten the load as much as he could.
Oh, yeah; Jarvis. Steve was originally worried about how Tony would react to waking up alone – he didn’t want the poor thing feeling abandoned – but he forgot that he could always just ask Jarvis about their whereabouts without even sitting up. That was…nifty.
“All we did was talk for a little while," Steve assured Pepper when she continued to give him an unimpressed stare, clearly not believing a word he was saying despite his sincerity, "That's all. He pushed at me like he always does, so I was going to leave him be and give him some space. But, he wanted me to stay with him. So, I did."
"I will do my absolute best," she promised him with a laugh, despite the fact that there wasn't actually much she could do, "And I expect you show Steve what good behavior you can have. That means no sneaking to the lab or anywhere else, tonight, doesn't it, sweetheart?"
“He’s not always so bad,” Pepper repeated her words from the previous night, crossing the kitchen to the island where Steve sat to hand him one of the mugs, “Cream or sugar?”
he did great with him and that was part of the reason this felt so right. Being able to have Tony almost completely calmed down from his previous fit before even getting Pepper on the phone was a feat, and Steve didn't care if it made him sound cocky to acknowledge that.
much, and I am so proud of you. You're doing such a good job. If I get a good report in the morning, we'll discuss rewards. Okay, sweet boy?"
Tony had no idea how to handle someone not being scared of him. Despite his status, he was a billionaire in a position of power with a bad attitude and a bad reputation for bad behavior. He was just bad in general. Only Pepper saw him for who he was, and sometimes Rhodey...but he was still
"Oh, I'm sure," she agreed lightly before continuing, "My point is, he's a huge sweetheart, and he's the best boy in the world when he wants to be. He's worth every single headache he'll undoubtedly cause you. I can assure you of that. I just... don't want whatever he does tonight to spook you."
"It's okay, I get it," Steve chuckled, amused by what Pepper had told him. It seems sneakiness was definitely one of Tony's best-practiced skills. Unfortunately for him, Steve's enhanced senses made his stealth practically useless around him. It was likely the submissive would be incredibly disappointed whenever he figured that out.
With the way he’d seen Tony behave prior to their moment on the balcony, it shouldn’t have been such a hard pill for him to swallow, but it was near impossible to believe that the sweetheart who’d just been curled up in his lap could possibly be such a brat that offering a simple apology was so far out of his character. Steve supposed there was even more of Tony to learn than he originally thought. Still, deep down, Steve felt good and proud of his ability to get a scared and untrusting submissive to want to connect when he was hardly even trying.
Steve ignored the resulting whine when he turned his back, headed towards the side of the room with the entire bar area, “I’m sure you have some water over here, right kid?”
, though. His brain only granted him a few moments of peace before it forcefully reminded him of what there was to be afraid of. Steve seemed different, but that didn't mean he was. That didn't mean he didn't still want to curl up and fall asleep against his chest, because he most definitely did. He just wished he didn't.
He felt his lip twitch partly in anger, partly in shame at the response he'd been given. His grip on his beer tightened and he stiffened, trying his best not to sound hurt when he spoke, “I don’t need taken care of.”
“Well, I think both you and I could do with some time together," she began, "So, I'll be on one of the jets in about an hour. I should be there by the time you wake up."
. Tony was impressively stubborn, Steve would give him that, but he knew he could outlast him. It just wouldn’t be all that fun.
For the first time since he'd been on the phone, Pepper seemed to actually look at him. Not glare in an angry or accusatory fashion, but just actually take a look at him. After a moment, her features softened further and she smiled, "You know, I've heard a lot about you, Mr. Rogers."
!” Tony argued pitifully into Steve’s neck, beginning to cry again. That was his argument and he clearly was going to stick to it, Steve realized, logic be damned.
Steve was perplexed. Tony probably needed a dominant who was more experienced with his needs. However, he clearly wasn’t going to consent to that. He was sure that if he ignored his wishes and called Rhodes anyway, it wouldn’t be forgiven nor forgotten by the submissive anytime in the foreseeable future. If the plan was to get his on his good side, that would put a damper on it. Tony would be more upset with him for forcing him to drop for a Rhodes when he didn't want to.
The gesture made Tony swoon. This new and oddly vulnerable moment was something Tony definitely didn't mind. Steve was taking care of him, and he loved the feeling of being taken care of. Although, he didn't quite remember ever loving it this much. Steve had the best touch he ever felt.
'A moment' lasted forever in Tony’s mind and he was just beginning to wonder if Steve left him when he heard voices in the hallway. After a moment, the sound became clearer and Tony made out Pepper giving him directions to his room. Personally, he didn't think the layout was too confusing, but he'd also lived there for a while. Another beat passed and Steve poked his head through the doorway of Tony's room. It didn't take long before his blue eyes landed on Tony's red-rimmed brown ones and he was shooting the sub an amused smile.
Tony usually wouldn’t admit that out loud. He knew it was selfish and he hated putting her in that position, but it was true. And he was too caught up in himself to care how it sounded. It was true.
"I'm just not..." there was another long pause before Tony finally forced himself to say it, "I'm just not
“You say it’s not my fault,” Tony muttered out the answer he knew so well, sending Pepper a pleading look before he quickly added, “I don’t wanna talk about this right now. Please? Not right now.”
“I want to talk to Steve for a minute," she announced as Tony began to try and sit up, voice soft, "Go and get ready for bed and then he’ll give the phone back.”
Tony nearly sputtered because well, yeah...that’s exactly what it was. Nobody wanted a submissive who didn’t know how to submit, especially not one who was Tony’s age. All he could manage to do was glare at Steve and give him a pitiful shake of the head. He didn't trust himself to speak.
Much to his surprise, a look of confusion covered his Domme’s face before a smile tugged at her lips, likely without her permission. She crossed her arms over her chest, feigning a stern look, “Uh-huh…sorry for what, Anthony?”
a specific thing; nobody changed Pepper's mind but Pepper. Whenever Pepper did let him off easy, it likely had nothing to do with his dramatics.
Still, he didn't miss the way Tony's eyes lit up at the praise, nor did he miss how he seemed much more eager to obey Pepper afterward. He nearly skipped down the hallway towards what Steve could only guess was his bedroom. He was still quite teary, but he was eager to please. Steve figured with some encouragement and some time, that could become a common trait of his.
Blinking away some of his tears so his vision would clear, Tony began to remove himself from Steve's lap. He hated having to leave the comfort almost as much as he hated leaving Pepper with Steve, but he wanted to obey. Besides, the quicker he was done and in bed the quicker he could talk to Pepper again. Maybe Steve would even go back to petting him while they talked. He figured he was being hopeful at that, but he wanted something to look forward to.
"I know," he appeased softly, quickly locating the neatly folded pile of clothing on an empty counter near the bathtub, "We're gonna get you into your pajamas so you can get some sleep."
He squirmed a little, forcing himself even closer to Steve as feelings of both regret and shame seeped into him. Now she was mad, and he never wanted Pepper to be mad at him, “I'm sorry, Pep. Don't be mad at me, okay? I promise not to say it again. Just don't be mad."
“None of those, either,” Steve didn’t hesitate to quell her worry, offering another soft smile, “He slept like a baby, it just hasn’t been for very long. I don’t think he dropped off until almost five, if not after.”
Tony’s voice sounded so desperate and he hated himself for it, but he couldn’t stop himself. For whatever reason, he didn’t want to be left alone with his thoughts. He wanted Steve to stay.
"Yes, I've been starting to notice that part, too," Steve chuckled, noting how far Tony had regressed just since he started slipping down at the party.
"It's no problem, Pepper, honestly. I would never just let a shocky sub roam around a party on his own," Steve assured, mildly annoyed by the fact that what he did could be considered anything besides basic human decency. Even if he wasn't interested in Tony, he would have helped take care of him or found someone who could.
Tony let out a breath he didn’t know he was holding, relieved. There was no room to complain about that, "Yes, ma'am."
“I don’t want you staying by yourself tonight,” Pepper tentatively explained, walking on eggshells in a way Tony had long become accustomed to when she was about to tell him something she thought he would oppose. Luckily for both of them, this time she thought wrong.
Tony tried to remind himself that Steve wouldn’t do that, though...At least he didn’t think he would. He may try to force his way through Tony’s guard (and apparently succeed) but he never made it seem like
"Thanks, Steve," she told him quietly before changing the subject, "And thank you for taking care of him. He would have tried to get through this alone if you wouldn't have, and that just does more damage than anything. It seems like you’ve done really well with him. So just...thank you."
i proof read this as well as i could with my cold, tired, dead eyes. i'll be back to do it properly soon.
she was being told. It seemed like the perfect plan and since so long had passed since Tony executed it, he was sure it
It wasn’t often Steve found himself lost, but this time he was. He wasn't ashamed to admit that he had been trying to get at Tony since he met him. It started off as a challenge, but the more time he spent with him and the more he figured out, the deeper it got.
"I meant what I said, Steve," Pepper repeated without acknowledging what they'd been told, a hint of steel residing in her tone and her eyes still boring into Steve through the screen, "He's been through enough."
Steve looked smug when he turned back around, almost like he was expecting it, and that made the brat in Tony almost flare up again. He wanted to turn around and say never mind, to snap at him and tell him to just go away. And he fully intended to, too, but then Steve spoke.
“No, you shouldn’t have,” Pepper answered shortly, letting her arms fall to her sides. Tony had to fight the urge to roll his eyes; although she did lighten her tone, that response was much less encouraging than he was hoping for. Clearly, she was taking this pretty seriously. Tony knew that was bad news for his behind.
With the number of tears Tony managed to shed over the last few hours, Steve figured he needed to get him to rehydrate before he fell asleep. Once he did that and got the tears to stop, then it would be lights out.
.  Stupid Steve fucking sucked and he never wanted to see him again, but he was just...expecting him. Who cuddles someone to sleep and then just wakes up and leaves? It was an asshole move, in Tony's opinion, but he wasn't about to tell Pepper he was feeling this way. That would only make things worse.
It took the words a moment to register, his mind still stuck between being threatened by Pepper and pining over Tony, but once they did, he blinked hard a few times and replied, "Yes?"
far out of his way to do. Those were the ones that always made him feel way worse; he could never understand
sound but otherwise ready to comply. He moved his hands up to scrub at his eyes before he finally dropped them and stilled completely.
He was honestly confused as to why Steve staying was even an option. Pepper was insanely overprotective of Tony, so letting a man she'd never even met in person before spend the night with him seemed out of her character.
“I miss you,” he finally sobbed, deciding not to respond what she'd just told him. His chest ached and he was longing for Pepper and the way things used to be, “Miss having you here with
New York was different 70 years ago. The buildings were taller now, the roads were quieter and the people were friendly. Now the buildings were 15 storeys - minimum -, the roads were packed with cars, and the people glared at you as though you'd kill them. Steve was still unsettled by the changes, but he'd learnt to deal with it. After loving Tony Stark you could deal with anything.
"You know you can ask me anything Tony, I feel like thats a given considering we were together 20 years." Steve responded,lifting his gaze from his drawings. Suddenly he felt move uneasy than earlier. What on earth could Tony want? He'd just yelled at him for intruding on his boundaries. Maybe he was going to ask if they could put it all behind them - Ha, who was Steve kidding, Tony hated his guts.
"Tony, we're going to be stuck in here together for a while unless God blesses us with a miracle, it would be nice if you didn't ask so hostile towards me. Just because we're going to be divorced doesn't mean we can't still be friends"
As soon as those words slipped from Tonys mouth Steve could see he regretted it. Steve had no plans to act hostile towards Tony, after all, they'd shared a happy life together for years and raised a son. But, if he dared criticise him or insult him, he wasn't going to stand there and take it. Steve began to think about their life together and their milestones, New York, the wedding, the adoption. It all had to end so horribly with a divorce. In the last year their marriage really began to fall apart when they realised Steve would outlive Tony. Although they still had years together it caused arguments. Tony wanted to leave the Avengers and travel the world with Steve. Although Steve had traveled the world he never really got to see the world, only fly over it or run through it. Tony however had been everywhere, and had a variety of favourite places to go.
Yes we’d had our issues and fights. My parents death of course being the breaking point. But after the snap, after wielding that gauntlet, after me almost dying, it all seemed so... minuscule. I wanted nothing more than for Steve to grab me and tell me loved me once I was awake again, but there was nothing. The way Steve spoke to me was the equivalent of a pat on the back from Fury, and it almost destroyed me again.
Then I met the man my father held me against all these years. And well... I really wanted to be held against him then. I still remember the first time we met, clear as day. I thought he was cute, he thought I was a narcissist. He wasn't wrong. Captain America was everything my father had made him out to be and more. At least I knew that there was one occasion he hadn't lied to me. Watching Steve across the table, he was mesmerizing. The way he spoke about taking down Loki made me shiver with fear, yet the bravery had me hot. I even had to excuse myself at one point for the bathroom. I remember telling myself that I was acting like a teenage again, stupid and naive, but jesus, that was just the start.
"Shit, I need to get Peter at school, Pepper will kill me and Fury is making me go to some shitty birthday party. This is your fault Steve, its your weight that made us get stuck! Why do you have to be all muscle."
He hoped he'd be buried near Gwen. He loved her so much. His dad found it gross, Pops found it adorable. Without Gwen, Peter would never be who he was today. Without her he'd be dead, Electro would have gotten to him and he'd be more of a fried spider than Spiderman. Peter spoke to Gwen everyday, he never missed an opportunity to speak to her. Even on Christmas day he'd sneak away from the tower to speak to her. He wasn't sure if his parents actually knew or they thought he was asleep. Either way, a day without speaking to Gwen Stacy was like trying to out a fire with more flames, it only added to Peters love for her.
I felt something crash against my lips. Something so incredibly soft but with so much energy behind it. My breathing was rapid, and my heart was pounding, but this object smashing against me was like an antidote. It stopped everything. For the first time in god knows how long even my thoughts stopped. I was in a moment of complete peace. None of my hopes, dreams and worries were an issue in that instant. It felt like watching 100 fireworks go off at once, all while feeling like I was in Steves arms again.
Yes, their relationship had its bumps, although perhaps their bumps were more like mountains for them to overcome. Yes, they'd gotten together after New York, but when Tony found out that Bucky had killed his parents, well, it wasn't just an Avengers Civil War. Tony and Steve had been a relatively new couple at the time, yet they were still living together. Tony had bought an apartment near Philadelphia so he could easily travel between Avenger duties at SHIELD in DC and Stark Industry in New York. During that time Steve would just hang out in Philly, he'd learnt where to get the best cheesesteak and pizza - although it did not beat Brooklyn in the slightest. He spent his weekends wandering around all the civil war sites, visiting the Smithsonian in DC or travelling up to New York to see what the team was up to. That was when he wasn't sent away on missions around the world. When Tony found out about Bucky, their worlds came shattering down around them. The idyllic lifestyle they had created for themselves shattered like snow globe hitting the ground. Steve loved Tony even then, but he knew he had to walk away from him, and Captain America to help his friend. He probably should have guessed then what their relationship would come to, but after the Infinity War they both realized how much they meant to each other. New York was bad enough but watching some of their closest friends be slaughtered in front of them was enough for anyone to reunite, no matter how big the wedge that drove them apart was. It was then that they decided to get married. And shortly after Peter joined their family. After that, you never would've known their family had been anything but perfect. Even when Steve and Tony fought, the battles they'd faced together - parenthood included was enough to make them forget what had happened.
That hit home. After today he was Steve Rogers, part of his identity was about drop off, he'd no longer share a name with his son, or his husband, well, soon to be ex. It also hadn't occurred to him that Tony was upset about people 'fainting' (which wasn't accurate). Sure people seemed to take more to Steve, but he'd never assumed it was hurtful, he thought Tony just ignored it, and passed it off as the fact that Steve was the national treasure now, a stay at home, gay dad? Most of America loved it. But then he remembered, Tony sold weapons to the government that were used in wars, and sometimes against American citizens, chances were Tonys weapons had killed more than a few Americans.
"You know you can ask me anything Tony, I feel like thats a given considering we were together 20 years."
Yep, Tony, out of the park, you’re going on dates for a cleaning husband, stop talking you’re making it worse.
We spent the night together, exploring every area of each other - physically and emotionally. I felt so safe around him, maybe because of all the stories I'd heard, or maybe because even then I realised this was the man I wanted to spend my life with.
Yo creeper, meet any pretty ladies today? ur idiot dads are stuck in a lift. Get home and we can laugh at the media reports, try not and die please, ur dinner will get cold if u do
Hey, I'm finally trying that Korean place you told me about! With the meatballs!?!?!?! Anyway, see you tonight, love you x
Why did I say that, fuck fuck why did I say that. All the noise and brain in my head and that was the best thing I could say? I’ve moved on? From the love of my life, from the man who held me as I cried even though I wanted the reason he made it to recruitment and not end up dead in an alley dead? The man who made me feel like there was no one else in the world... Come on Tony Stark, you’re smart enough to save this!
"Tony breathe! In through your nose, and out through your mouth!" Steve said soothingly, repeating it several times while rubbing his back. "Breathe in the bag, it'll make it better. Come on, we can get through this!"
Without a seconds hesitation Tony got up to speak into the microphone, demanding that he be rescued from the elevator, and if he wasn't he'd sue the company so much their childrens children would still be paying for it. Clearly Tony was more uncomfortable than Steve first assumed. And then the voice came, telling them both a message they did not want to hear.
Although their marriage was the best years of Steves life, and there was a lot of life, it was also the worst. Loving Tony Stark was like living in a constant state of fear. Fear that he would kill himself from drinking too much, fear that he'd severely annoy the president and fear that he'd have a nervous breakdown. But most of the time, for Tony, the fear was a thrill, only encouraging him to do more rebellious and dangerous actions. While Tony found this exciting, Steve watched the TV with nerves, worrying about what he'd do without him, and how he'd raise their son Peter. Yes, Peter was 17, but he was still only a child in their eyes.
Tony was refusing to look anywhere near Steve, but all Steve could do was look at his face and try to remember all the details that he loved. He knew that after the papers were signed he'd only see him at parties or in the news. He studied the stress lines on his forehead. They started to appear after New York, once Tonys nightmares began, his anxiety worsened, and he began to get claustrophobia, scared that he couldn't escape, just like he thought he couldn't escape the galaxy that he'd visited that day. He studied his eyes, the brown making his grey hairs stand out. Technically Steve was older, but he only looked 30, where as Tony was 50.
Do I really want to ask this? 8 hours in an elevator. Thats a long time if he says he doesn't care about me anymore. Imagine how awkward it would be then, you'd end up wanting to shoot yourself with your lasers.
As Peter was walking towards the subway he realised that none of his uncles or aunt realised what time he got home, so he could take his time today. He could walk through Central Park, visit that fantastic pizza place in Brooklyn then eat it at his Pops place or finally get round to that Korean place that Gwen had told him about. After several minutes contemplation, he decided on Korean food. There were no paparrazzi in Korea Town, and it wouldn't leave a greasy smell in Pops apartment. Now it was just a question as to whether he'd get the subway there or web it.
He'd been standing waiting for half an hour. Dad was never late. He looked at his phone to see several texts from his family
And in that moment, maybe it was the adrenaline, maybe it was the heat of the elevator, or the moment - we were always good at making it up to each other after a fight - but words fell out of me again, like a boat tipping over a waterfall, nothing to stop them.
"Don't blame that on me, you were there first with Pepper, you could have kept me a seat, all you had to do was put a coat down. Even Pepper agrees. I had to sit over there, it was you that made Peter wave in two different directions, not me."
Peter sent a group text to them all with a simple "OK." It was nice how much they all cared about him. He could remember when he was young that they all took him under their wings, he'd had a tough childhood until his Dad and Pops adopted him. They didn't like to speak about it, but he knew the story. His biological parents died in a crash, then his Uncle Ben was shot, with his Aunt May dying soon after since she took it so hard. He didn't forget about them, he visited their ashes and had photos of them. But his Dad and Pops did the best job they could to act like his biological parents. He knew he had another family, but after growing up with the Avengers, they were his family.
Now though, with the divorce finally looming, it was up to Steve to try and raise Peter. Steve had always been the one to help Tony make the right choices concerning their child. Tony wanted to spoil Peter rotten, but Steve tried to give him a proper, middle class childhood. Now they'd be competing for the best parent. Steve had to be fair though, Tony wasn't a terrible parent, in fact, he was brilliant. He'd gotten Peter into science, although it wasn't the scientific branch either of them wanted, it was still science. He'd always make sure he could pick Peter up at school. It was a rare day when Pepper was sent. He'd built a tracking device into Peters phone, so they always knew his stats, and Peter still hadn't figured it out. Tony Stark was the best parent Steve had ever known, although he always needed encouragement when it came to the more practical situations like curfews and relationships. Tonys natural parenting skills were a surprise to Steve after learning about how Howard had treated him. Even though Howard and Steve got on well, he wanted to hit him due to the mistreatment of Tony.
“No! Not him!” Tony snapped at him yet again, causing Steve to be taken back. He hadn’t expected that; Rhodes was his best friend, wasn't he?  Why didn't he want him to be called? Especially when the only other option he had was Steve?
"Most definitely," she agreed with a chuckle, "So keep him off of any electronics until morning. He'll probably want to turn his TV on and that's fine. He can go ahead and watch whatever he wants, but nothing beyond that. And for the love of God, please don't let him end up in his lab. He knows he's not supposed to be in there at night, but he will have no problem locking you out and dealing with the consequences whenever I get there if he catches the chance."
“Yes, ma’am,” he answered quietly, shooting Steve a quick glance before looking back towards the phone, “I’ll be good.”
The action required what Steve imagined was a lot of trust for Tony, but if he had a problem with it outside of being sulky, he didn’t show it. Instead, he just offered his dirty face to be cleaned off.
His eyes were visibly drooping as he nodded, but he still argued with a shrug, "'m still not tired, Pep..."
Tony gave a low chuckle, but he didn’t sound all that amused. Steve was expecting a response, but one never came. Instead, he curled a little closer into Steve, took a handful of his shirt, and let out a little sigh. For a moment, he wondered if he managed to upset him again, but when he nuzzled his face into his chest he figured they were still good. He repeated the same actions as earlier before he turned back to the movie. It was back to silence for a while after that.
Tony squirmed to help them fall down to his ankles, reaching up to rest his hands on the Dom's broad shoulders to steady himself. Once his slacks hit the floor, he quickly grabbed Steve's shirt again. He glanced up to give him a small smile in return, "I'm not going anywhere. Don't worry."
It was much easier with Pepper. There was nothing to be afraid of with her. He didn't have to worry about her randomly deciding that he was too much to handle. She was the only person he trusted not to give up on him. She'd seen his best and his worst moments and she'd loved and cared for him through it all. So, that’s whose presence he was yearning for. She and Helen were working on something for the submissive’s practice in Los Angeles, and Tony was
"Mama, no!" Tony howled, quivering at the thought. His Pepper didn't paddle him very often - only for big stuff, but he figured this
"Brat," Steve chuckled quietly, looking towards the restroom. The water was still running and he could hear a little movement so he knew Tony was doing what he was supposed to, but he also knew it wouldn't be long before he was done, "I'll be sure to keep an eye on him. I'm a light sleeper, anyway. It won't be hard, don’t worry."
She cupped his face with her hands in a way that made Tony feel so angelic, so delicate. He rarely felt like that, and he knew by the way it made him feel that the answer to her question was no, he wasn't quite back with her. He still felt a little floaty, but it was in a pretty good way. He settled on a shrug in response, giving her a dopey smile with his eyes closed, "Sure."
Once Pepper finished with that, she crawled up onto the bed beside him. He was facing away from her, but she just hugged him tightly from behind and kissed his cheek, "It's okay, baby boy. C'mere."
“Why do you think that?” Steve cut in, completely ignoring the glare being sent his way. Tony wasn't sure, but it seemed like he was trying to save him from some of Pepper's scolding, “Why do you do that to yourself?”
"Oh, trust me, it doesn't take much to do that,” Pepper informed him with dry amusement, clearly accustomed to this behavior, “You wouldn’t be able to tell by the way he may usually behave, but he is
Tony just nodded. He knew once he was punished, they were done with it. It was comforting, and even though he couldn’t always stop punishing himself, it felt good to be forgiven by his Pepper. It still made most, if not all of the guilt go away.
Tony thought to himself. It did make more sense like this, as opposed to waiting further into her trip, but he still didn’t like it. He hadn’t even gotten a proper cuddle yet and he was already about to get his ass blistered. Had he have saw this coming, it would have been easier. But unfortunately, he didn’t figure out that she knew until it was
It wasn't long before a movie started, the sound of the opening credits booming from somewhere Steve couldn't see. If he didn't know any better, he'd say it was simply coming from everywhere. One thing was for sure, though: it was painfully and unnecessarily loud.
Tony always promised to do better; the promises were often broken but he kept them for as long as he could remember to. And when he said it, at that moment, he definitely meant it. He wanted to be Pepper's good boy, and even though she claimed that he always was, he did have an idea of what to do to make it
, she knew. She just wanted to see if he would tell on himself, first. She was usually less upset if he did that, and it often showed in his spankings, but admitting to any naughtiness was not (nor did Tony think it ever would be) easy for him.
While they sat, Steve played in his hair and with his ears, gauging his reactions and hoping it could get the job done, but all it ever managed to do was get Tony to close his eyes for a little while. They always popped back open after a minute or so, though, staring up at Steve for a few moments before returning to the screen.
“The laundry chute’s to the right of the bath, Sir,” Jarvis informed him after a moment of him just standing there, awkwardly holding Tony’s pants, “Have you located it?”
To that, Steve nodded. He would be lying if he said he didn’t underestimate her warnings, even if just by a little bit, “He’s definitely stubborn, that’s for sure.”
"I'm sorry," she offered her apology after another stretch of silence. She made eye contact again, and this time the fire-like-rage that previously resided there was gone, "I shouldn't have assumed you did wrong. Its just...it wouldn't be the first time, and he's not always the best about..."
I believe that you won't hurt him, but you listen to me, Steve Rogers," Pepper spoke after a stretch of quiet, her voice deathly serious and her facial expression matching it perfectly, "If I find out that you even
to as it did with Tony's issues with vulnerability, but he did understand. However, Steve couldn't help but wonder if this was really the time to listen to Tony. He was distraught and wasn’t in a position to make decisions for himself. Unfortunately, the person who was supposed to make his decisions when he didn’t have a clear head was not available.
Despite himself, Steve supposed it wasn’t, “I just haven’t met anyone yet, is all. There’s no big explanation for it. Why do you ask?”
And God, did he want to stall. Or just run. There was a window, after all, and he could have Jarvis send something to catch him.  But eventually, he’d have to come back. Back to square one, except this time, square one would be on fire. There had been plenty of moments where Tony was far gone enough to take off, anyway, but this wasn’t one of them.
Steve kept his tone soft but firm, making sure his face portrayed the same so Tony knew he wouldn’t sway. That didn’t stop the sub from fixing him with a pitiful, tearful look while he squirmed his way under his covers, sniffling all the way. Steve had to bite back a smile at how hard he was trying to be convincing but fought it off. He didn’t want to encourage any manipulative behaviors, nor did he want Tony to think he’d forgotten what just happened.
"Doesn't matter," Tony answered through a horribly hidden yawn. He peered up at Steve again to see if he saw it. The knowing look he received must have let him know that it hadn't gone unnoticed because he diverted his gaze again, "Something good."
"Sorry, sir," the A.I. interrupted their moment as the volume of the movie dropped drastically, somehow sounding apologetic, "The volume was never adjusted from the last time you used your viewing area."
Fortunately, he didn’t seem to have an argument to that and just closed his eyes with a huff. Steve was thankful – he was ready for some shut-eye his self, by then. If Tony was finally going to give it up, they could both rest for a while.
"I'm not t-...huh?" Tony was about to continue to protest before he realized the question he was asked. Someone was gonna stay with him? And stupid Steve was an option? He wasn't really expecting that.
Tony bit his lip as he nodded, eyes rising from the phone's screen up to meet Steve's. He was still skeptical, Steve could see the slightest hint of it, but besides that, his eyes almost seemed...trusting. Steve didn't take that lightly.
Steve sighed before he could help it. He didn’t want Anthony in any extra trouble, but he also wasn’t really comfortable hiding things from Tony’s Domme. In the end, he decided to just tell her
The frown Tony wore only deepened when Steve laughed at him, and it got even worse when Pepper denied his request, "I know you can, but I'd like to speak with Steve for a minute. Did he keep the phone from you before, or did he give it back?"
Her smile didn't falter but it became more sympathetic as she added, "It’s okay. Thank you for trying, sweetheart."
Jarvis went ignored. Tony chose to keep his face pressed into the muscular chest presented to him instead. Steve continued to hold him tightly, cradling his head with the same hand he was using to play in his hair. He wanted to coo at him and praise him for how well he was doing - how easily he was allowing himself to be taken care of even though it was scary. He was relaxed, practically purring in his lap and Steve could tell that the contact and the fingers in his hair had him floating again. What he absolutely was not about to do was ruin that by overwhelming him with too much, too soon. So, he settled for a simple
“Why don’t you stay put for a minute?" Pepper asked in a way that let Tony know it wasn't actually a question. Her demeanor was different than a few moments prior, and Tony felt a pang of anxiety hit him, "There’s something we need to talk about.”
the last few weeks of Pepper’s trip, Tony had been downright horrible to almost everyone around him. Not to mention the part where he was barely eating or sleeping. From the looks of it, she wasn’t punishing him for that stuff, too, though, and that helped Tony bite down on any further argument for the time being.
Tony didn't love surprises. He liked to be in the know or it usually threw him for a loop that affected his mood. This one, however, wasn't too bad.
"From what I'm seeing, you're doing your best," he assured her, "But you can only do so much, especially from across the country. And he's not making it easy."
Steve deduced that was the case already, but before he could inquire any further about Tony's sleeping habits, she was beckoning him to follow her, “Coffee? I’m sure it was a long night.”
The nickname took Steve by surprise, but he bit it down before it could show on his face. He'd never heard him call or refer to her as that before, so he figured it was something that happened when he was deep in his space. If Tony ever regressed far enough to actually be considered a little, he was sure Pepper would have mentioned that to him. As long as she was in his life by then, and considering the fact that they'd never been sexually or romantically involved, he probably did look at her as a motherly figure even though they were nearly the same age. Steve would have been lying if he said he wasn't curious to learn more, but despite his curiosity, Steve reminded himself that it wasn't his business. Not yet, at least. When it was, he would be sure to bring it up to Pepper.
“Really?” Tony almost squeaked, not bothered by how childlike he undoubtedly looked and sounded. This was
When Steve began to manhandle Tony until he was pushed far back enough for them to make proper eye contact, the submissive tensed in preparation for his response. Steve still didn’t hesitate to grab both of his hands in one of his own, holding in front of him as he almost growled, “You do
“Steve?” Tony almost whispered after a few minutes passed, eyes opening and looking up at Steve with the same puppy dog look he’d been rocking for hours (give or take a few petulant moments). Once Steve glanced down at him, he averted his eyes and shyly continued, “Are you gonna tell Pepper about…earlier?”
