“Absolutely. And it’s not like you’ll have to do many public appearances after things die down. JARVIS and I will handle all the data gathering, and you can meet with a couple members of the PR team, people we really—”
“Pretty positive I’m the one who should be thanking you, Clint.” The archer ducked his head, just close enough to the remnants of his submissive headspace to allow shyness to overcome his natural displays of bravado. And Steve could appreciate how beautiful a picture that made, even if his appreciation felt more akin to the distant admiration a viewer might have toward an art object than the visceral attraction he should feel toward a man he’d just spent a very pleasurable evening with. “You were beautiful and perfect for me. Are you sure you had enough to eat? Is there anything else you need?” Clint grinned and knocked their shoulders together.
Content Notes: This chapter contains Tony trying his hand at Domination. The actual scene is not that extended, and it cuts away before anything sexually explicit, but if you want to skip it, just avoid the section section of the chapter. I don't think there's anything else to warn for in this one, but as always let me know if you have questions or concerns.
So the last couple weeks I sort of wondered if the Doctor would be getting any more questions as the story wound down, so colour me absolutely delighted to have gotten such amazing prompts! Thanks, team!
They find Steve on his feet, holding the shield. Given the violence of their entrance, this is probably unsurprising. He can’t meet anyone’s eyes, though. That’s when Peter knows for sure that what—who—he heard.
“If anything we are doing or that is being said makes me feel coerced, manipulated or is in any other way negatively impacting me. I can also say yellow if I need a break or to slow down, but not stop whatever we’re doing entirely.”
“What happened to her?” Steve heard himself laugh, a humourless, agonized sound that tore at his throat on its way out.
Eventually a coffee grinder whirred to life, and pots and pans started being banged together in the kitchen. He gave it a few minutes just in case Steve was trying to make himself something quick and head out before Peter was up and about. Just the opposite proved to be true. By the time Peter made his way into the kitchen, there were stacks upon stacks of thick, golden-brown pancakes and still more on the griddle, a sizzling pan full of bacon, and a heaving bowl full of fruit salad on the breakfast bar. Steve was wearing an apron patterned with what Peter belatedly recognized to be the Starship Enterprise. He must have caught Peter staring at the apron, because he looked down at himself and chuckled.
Tony had almost managed to forget about the debacle that had been that morning’s breakfast; Rhodey trying to murder him by making him run with gods and soldiers had turned out to be, if nothing else, extremely distracting. Even moreso had been Rhodey’s praise afterward. He’d been so comfortable claiming Tony as his own, and he’d turned Tony’s grudging participation in their run into a gift he’d given himself and his partners. He tried very hard not to grin on the walk back into the house, because Rhodey’s commitment to exercise should not be encouraged, but he’d had to fight his traitorously twitching lips more than once.
Tony had promised Natasha no more hiding, and despite his reputation to the contrary he took his promises seriously damn it. So when he woke up the morning after the floofy Bruce incident curled up in the other man’s arms, fuzzy socks still on his feet and mouth still tasting faintly of artificial fruit flavouring and sugar, he didn’t bolt. He’d even agreed to make an appearance at dinner later that week to talk with the team about potentially re-negotiating boundaries and ‘exploring submission in a more experiential way.’ (When he thought too much about that one, Tony always wound up functionally useless for at least an hour while his system struggled between an anxiety and arousal responses, so he had shoved that into a deep vault in his mind.)
This was a hard compliment to accept at face-value. From everything Tony could tell the same amount of time had passed here as in his own world, but this version of the team so often seemed much younger than his own. This version of Clint in particular had a kind of boyish energy that his counterpart had either lost or never possessed. He laughed easily, and wore silly t-shirts with internet memes on them, and could almost always be found with some kind of bandaid on his body (usually Avengers printed.) All this combined with the killer arms and perpetually tanned, golden skin? Yeah, Tony was kind of out of his league here. But there was also no need to make a show out of his pitiful self-esteem first thing in the evening, so Tony flashed his best press-ready smile.
“Like I said. Not interested.” Domen didn’t look disappointed, or angry. She didn’t even glance up from her screen. He peered down at his watch. (One hour, fifty-eight minutes to go.)
Bruce used those powers of…well, not quite distraction, but redirection, that he’d showcased to such positive effect during their aftercare as they made their way from the shop to the penthouse, quizzing Tony about the work Coulson had him doing and trying to sneak ‘hints’ about how to win at the exercise he was designing. And hell, it was nearly impossible not to relax when this unexpectedly playful side of Bruce came out; before he knew it, Tony was chastising the guy as they exited the elevators into the penthouse.
“Of course I do. Honestly in a lot of ways this is easier. When I thought you were a Dom, that meant violating your most basic and primal instincts. It would have been hell on your system.” There’s several assumptions built into that statement that Pepper doesn’t explicitly address, but Tony isn’t a genius for nothing. She had expected him to play at being the other Tony. It’s just not immediately clear, well, why, or if this changed things.
some form of subspace, Tony. And then you were pushed out of it suddenly and somewhat traumatically, which led you to drop pretty hard. It’s why it feels so good to be touched right now, and why a candy I know you don't usually even like tastes like the best thing you’ve ever eaten. Sugar is good for drops. But the best thing for it is aftercare.”
“Permission granted,” Natasha declared grandly. Her feet were up on the kitchen table again, which normally Steve hated. But Thor had brought the Asgarsdian mead again and Steve was an utter horndog when he was drunk, so he was too busy with his transparent admiration of Natasha’s thighs to bother protesting her lack of decorum.
“Because I didn’t fucking know I could!” Tony had finally snapped back on the third day of back and forth on this exhausting topic. That, at least, took the righteous wind out of Steve’s sails, though seeing the heartbroken look on his face as he all but collapsed into the nearest chair was hardly much better. For once, Tony didn’t fight the instinct to curl up at Steve’s feet, leaning his body against his Dominant’s with a heavy sigh.
What Tony hadn’t counted on (although he damn well should have, he’d been through enough check-ins by now to know better) was his own reaction to Bruce’s presence. He wasn’t sure what it was about the sessions, because he maintained that the check-ins themselves were kind of the worst, but Tony walked out the majority of them half submersed in subspace. If it was a normal day he could usually tug himself back out of it fairly quickly by focusing on work, but today…today was different. Today Steve had been there to watch Bruce examine his most intimate places and ask invasive, personal questions, and now Steve was drawing water for a bath. Tony half wanted to crawl after him, just to be on his knees for Steve again, and because he didn’t like being left alone right now, not even for a second, even though Steve had asked and Tony had told him it would be okay. (Yeah, okay, he was more than a little bit back down in subspace then.)
Tony’s mouth snapped shut, and he quickly reached out and investigated Thor’s arms as he’d been instructed. Steve grinned; for all his worries about being Dominant around Tony, Bucky’s tendency to be a fair but demanding teacher was winning out by a mile. This was going to be fun.
that’s so good. I could fuck your throat for days, do you know that?” Thor moaned in enthusiastic agreement with this plan, and the heavy vibrations against Steve’s cock spelled the end. He came with a shuddering cry, fingers roughly settling into Thor’s long blonde hair.
At first, Bucky tried in vain to clean the mess up, as if scrubbing away at the paint with his coat sleeve or collecting the pieces of crumbled marble might remove the stain of the guilt Tony knew the other man would always struggle with. Eventually, Tony caught Bucky’s hand in his own and pulled him back up to standing.
“Which one? There are no Gods I am aware of specifically concerned with your Midgardian orientations,” Thor interjected. That drew a grin out of everyone in the room, Coulson included.
Content Warnings for this chapter: Nothing major that I can think of. Tony contemplates his scars at one point, so allusions to canon-typical (and indeed MCU canon-compliant) violence. He also responds positively and with relief to the fact that the Rhodey in this universe is not wearing bracers. This is not intended as an expression of any form of ableism on Tony's part; he's just happy Rhodey wasn't injured and doesn't struggle with chronic pain issues.
“Not at all. Kinks and interests here vary as much as I would imagine they do in your world. If a Dom is with a sub who needs or desires heavy pain play or orgasm denial then providing that is just as comforting to their instincts as praise or body worship—with some exceptions, of course. Everyone has their own limits, and if something is too far outside of a Dom’s personal interests then they mostly aren’t going to be fulfilled by providing it. But dominin
Then Spider-Girl rounded the corner nearest to where he and Tony stood. Peter flashed her a thumbs up, because even though he had about a hundred questions, he was hardly about to go against Team Spidey! Even standing so close, Peter wasn’t sure what happened next. Even with the improvements he felt could have been made to her webbing, there was no visible reason she should have fallen out of the air and landed with a thud on the mats below. He stepped forward, eager to make sure she was alright, but Tony held out a restraining arm.
“Will you stay? And maybe can we—I mean this bed is fine for a short term stay, but three days on it has been a little much.” Thor hoisted Tony so easily into his arms that it would undoubtedly have been embarrassing if he hadn’t been almost asleep already by the time he was set down on the larger mattress in the centre of the room.
This chapter was particularly challenging to write, partially because it was such an important one plot-wise, and also because I have a vicious cold that's kicking my ass. (But hey, did you catch that pretty important information Tony dropped about the events leading up to his entering the D/s universe?)
“I used to wonder, a lot, what would have happened if the other Coulson had lived. If he could have stopped us from disintegrating the way we did,” he said in a voice just louder than a whisper. On screen, the smarter of the two mice was attempting to build a mechanical human suit in an elaborate plot to avoid work and plot world domination instead. It was just similar enough to the Iron Man armour that the resemblance had to be intentional, which meant Phil had not only chosen a date involving cartoons, he’d personally curated the collection. Tony pressed a secret smile against Phil’s shoulder, then hummed when Coulson’s hand found his hair and started toying idly with his curls. (The team all had such a thing about his hair; it wasn’t that Tony minded it longer like this, but it was mainly the fact that none of them could seem to keep their hands away from him that kept him from ever doing more than trimming it.)
“But the truth it’s not always easy to tell the difference. Sometimes we make mistakes. And the water is muddied further by the fact that regardless of the source of a person’s stress, going into a healthy and safe headspace is usually the first suggested method for managing it.”
Content Notes: I think it's possible that there is no material that merits a content note in this chapter! That feels kind of remarkable, and if it's just that I missed something please do feel free to let me know.
“Carol helped out with the photon energy. For the shield,” he clarified, because Tony’s access to his faculties became almost non-existent when Bruce started massaging his feet. He knew how to press hard enough to avoid tickling, and he even got in between Tony’s toes and manipulated the arches. Tony tipped his head back and made an aborted sound that would have definitely been a moan. “No, you're good sweetheart. You can make any sounds you want or need to. Aftercare is all about helping both the Dom and the sub to stay steady after a scene is done. It keeps me steady to know you’re feeling nice.”
mean that non-consensual violence by dominants towards submissives, especially when both are in headspace, is virtually non-existent. A Dom has to fight back all of their most basic instincts to do it, so most of them couldn’t manage it, even if they wanted to for some bizarre reason. Scenes can still go wrong, of course, things happen, but it’s exceedingly rare for a Dominant to cause intentional, non-consensual damage to a submissive.”
“Perfectly normal. It sounds like you’re starting to settle. I’d be willing to bet that your cortisol is beginning to level off, maybe even drop a little.” There was a pregnant pause, and for a few seconds the only noise in the room was the quiet hum of the water circulation systems. “If the process is anything like what happens with kids in our world it’ll still fluctuate for a while. You’ll have good and bad days, and the highs will feel really high and the lows will feel really low for a while yet, but it’s very possible that you’re through the worst of it.”
As anxious as he’d been, though, Tony had also been filled with the kind of joyful, boundless energy that usually only the shop brought out in him. From what Steve had gathered, Peter’s Tony-less life in this universe hadn’t been the sunshine and roses Tony had expected, and while none of them would ever have wanted the kid to suffer, Steve thought that they couldn’t have asked for a more concrete and meaningful demonstration of Tony’s worth. He felt hopeful they’d be able to build on this beyond just in his bond with Peter.
“Well which one is the best one?” Tony demanded, impatient. Magic had screwed him over enough, was it really so much to ask that it simplify his life just one time? Strange smiled, and Tony noted with irritation that there seemed to be a fair amount of sympathy in it.
“Oh is THAT what he told you? Pfft. Rhodey likes to play innocent little dove, but he got us into at least half the scrapes we ever managed to find ourselves in. In college…”
These replies include some details about how Dom and sub drop work in the D/s universe. If you want to skip that, stop reading after the first reply.
“And I…he, I mean, wouldn’t do it. The other me wouldn’t sign, wouldn’t even discuss it. He left, and somehow he, their Bucky, and Tony ended up in Siberia. Where—” Steve halted, and Bruce smoothly took over.
Natasha was falling, and then she wasn’t. And while she’d anticipated a lot of cruel endings to her life, the mindfuck of that after the cliffside battle for Clint’s life seemed like a little much. She waited for upwards of twenty seconds with her eyes closed, praying that the next part wouldn’t be too horrible. (Her sacrifice had to have counted for something, didn’t it? It must have wiped out at least some of the red still left in her ledger?)
While the peacekeeping efforts were officially being led by the UN, it became clear very quickly that the small force from Wakanda was effectively in command. This not only made sense, given that they were tracking a band of rebel troops who had stolen loaned Wakandan technology and were attempting to sell it on the black market, it also meant that Steve mostly got to stand back and listen rather than stepping into a leadership role himself. Again, not his usual preference, but right now taking orders instead of giving them felt like a godsend.
“Are you telling me,” she said slowly, as if measuring and choosing every word with care, “that he’s subbing for all—or most—of you, and there are no daily elements to that? It’s all isolated scenes?” The blue Iron Man armour turned to stare at the team, too, and even though Steve knew it was empty, he still felt the weight of its disapproval.
“The ring goes around your cock, making it harder or impossible to reach orgasm depending on the person. It’ll lie on top of this,” she gestured to the fake penis, “which I can make vibrate if I wish, or use to fuck myself . And these,” she pointed to the ears, “are designed to vibrate and rub up against my clit.” Tony remembered with a thrill of fear and excitement that one of the only things Natasha had ranked at the high end of the spectrum were related to controlling, even denying, her partners the ability to orgasm. “One way or another, I’d like to make you desperate tonight. I want to try to bring you out of your head and keep you there for as long as I can. But I’d like you to tell me how you wish for me to take you there. This can include any one of these toys, or none of them if you suspect there will be a more effective method.”
None of it had worked. Because Steve himself didn’t want to be down here. It was unbearable to be surrounded by such a dearth of evidence that Tony had been alive so recently—the open holoscreens, the dunce hat he’d left on Dummy that morning, the half-diassembled upgrade to a piece of War Machine’s left shoulder that lay on top of one of the long tables. (Tony would never finish it. Would never complete any more projects, or go to that gala next week on Steve’s arm. Wouldn’t ever fight alongside Steve, or kiss him when the battle was over and both of their systems were still surging with adrenaline. He’d never
Said song had also proved to be a useful distraction from Flash, who, unlike his teammates, was not even trying to mask his annoyance at Peter’s presence.
“Did your guys get him? Maximoff?” Tony sighed, running a frustrated hand through his hair and then letting his hand fall, as if out of impulse or habit, to the lock on his collar. Now that Peter was looking at him without the distorting haze of anger, it was impossible to miss how utterly exhausted his mentor appeared. His hair showed all the signs of frequent application of dry shampoo in lieu of actual showers, and Peter would be damn surprised if the man had slept more than a few hours a night since this whole thing with Maximoff had started. (And why did that name sound so familiar, anyway?)
“I, uh, that won’t be a problem. That is, I’m not seein’ anybody at the moment, and even when I have in the past, it’s a standard part of any contracts that I offer that there will be a single exception even to strictly monogamous relationships. I wasn’t trying to be presumptuous, and I never named Tony specifically, but I was his first Dom. I couldn’t handle the idea of him needing me somewhere down the line and me having to say no.”
The thought of Tony in any kind of altercation with Natasha was an alarming one, but before Rhodey could panic about it for too long, another message popped up.
manage to tug them over his saggiest parts, the pants suggested Phony must have had a pretty spectacular ass. Enough of Tony’s life was going to involve constantly being measured against that bastard and found wanting, dammit, his ass was not going to be included on that list.)
to soothe those kind of hurts, to provide guidance and care and comfort of whatever form a submissive (
No, he needed a gesture, something that Tony would instantly understand, that could convey the depth and severity of Steve’s regret. He took several long strides, coming to rest a foot in front of Tony. And then he sank, in a single, fluid motion, to his knees. It was an old-fashioned move, just like Steve himself. Dominants nowadays tended to avoid even the most glancing reminder of power dynamics during or immediately following arguments. And most of the time it made sense; it avoided exactly what had happened that morning, with Steve unintentionally abusing his power over a submissive because of his own anger.
I also want to note that this is a fictional account of therapy. I try to remain as realistic and respectful of the process as possible, but this is one occasion where what happens in the session is not ideal. Domen doesn't think Steve is ready to have this conversation yet, but she's faced with the difficult decision of letting him likely drop out of therapy, or making it clear to Steve that they still have work to do. She chooses the latter, but that's not a decision I am necessarily endorsing or claiming would be right for everyone.
“It is no bother,” Thor chuckled. He helped Steve rearrange Tony on his back, a pillow under his hips, and then fed him his cock slowly, letting Tony adjust both to the new angle and to Thor’s size. Tony’s own cock visibly spasmed, a prelude to an orgasm he wasn’t permitted to have yet, and Steve chuckled.
To their credit, the Spy Twins took the rejection well; by the time he got back they had turned on the television, presumably to cut down on the awkward silence, and they had made ample room for Tony at the end of the couch rather than forcing him to choose between filling the space between them or sitting across the room. And Phil still came up with bagels less than five minutes later. Agent was dressed down today, in jeans and deep green thermal. (Had he ever seen his Phil out of a suit?)
If the team were here, Tony thought, they would also be doing all the things that were wonderful about them like holding his hand during the blood draw (as if that kind of pain even registered anymore) and attempting to assure him that they would be there no matter what the results were. He envisioned it with no small amount of longing: Bruce, quizzing Dr. Chimva on the procedures she was using and stealing Tony’s chart to read for himself; Clint and Thor keeping things light with jokes and stories; Natasha and Phil’s support would be quieter, but they would be the reason a perfectly-sweetened cup of coffee or Tony’s favourite granola bar would suddenly appear as if from thin air. And of course, there would be Steve; Steve would be everywhere, the immensity of his frame matched only by the force and intensity of his affection, which he wore so openly that it was difficult, sometimes, to even look at him.
This somewhat morbid and highly depressing thought was probably the earliest sign of stage two: angry, depressed Peter. He didn’t become aware that his mood had shifted, though, until several minutes (maybe? drunk time was weird) later when he and MJ were discussing Tony—more specifically, how Peter and Tony had met. He’d forgotten she didn’t already know the reality behind the ‘internship,’ at least until he’d made passing reference to his involvement in the Civil War. MJ sat up straighter, looking far sharper and more sober than she had seconds before.
Harley laughed, chastened by the reminder of his plans to rob Strange. He was still crying, too, but Peter could hear the relief in it, could easily tell how much comfort his friend had drawn from learning that Tony was alive and well, even if it was elsewhere. Peter recognized some of his own feelings in the sound. It was good, truly, to see Tony happy, to know that he wasn’t trapped in some kind of hell dimension or pocket universe filled with bees or something.
this to be true more than anything. He wanted to be exactly what Steve needed, for as long as he possibly could. So he laid his head back against Steve’s broad chest, feeling the vibrations of the pleased little rumble that produced in his Dominant.
“So what are you saying, exactly?” Tony asked. “Because I’ve been, as you noted, extremely wrong about a lot of shit in the last 24 hours, and I am not interested in a replay.”
It had been the perfect way to begin wrapping the vacation up. There had been weeks of shopping and decadent meals and sex and games and lounging by the pool and every other form of relaxation Tony could have dreamed of. He’d learned a hell of a lot about the rest of the team, and even more about himself. He really, really like exhibitionism; he loved being on display in front of the team, knowing they were hearing and watching and taking notes (sometimes literally—Coulson had brought an actual notepad as a prop to one scene and Tony had come in about five minutes); he loved anything to do with having his hair played with or pulled; he liked being restrained, but he preferred soft tools, leather and silk and rope, over chain or manacles. (He also did not like any kind of bondage that involved being suspended.) Other things Tony really liked but also felt conflicted on; despite the fact that he always waited for the team’s permission to come, actually asking still made him squirm, and the day Coulson had made him tell someone every time he got hard had been…overwhelmingly hot, and also just plain overwhelming. The non-sexual stuff was pretty awesome too, but he felt conflicted about nearly all of it. He treasured everything he and Rhodey had brought home from their shopping trip, but it still went against every instinct he had to let the team spend money on him. Food was still a big challenge, but he’d settled into a routine of cooking at least one meal with someone (usually Rhodey) every couple of days, and between that and the barrage of snacks that Bruce had resumed leaving around the house, his worst episodes of either refusing to eat altogether or wolfing food down out of fear were growing fewer and farther between. When Phil had set a blank copy of the exploratory contract down in front of him several days prior, Tony had been happily stunned to realize how much of it he could fill out now. All that had been left had been settling things with Bucky. Well…almost everything.
child…Steve marvelled at the very fact of his survival. And then realization hit Steve, and he was as sure of what he said next as he had ever been of anything.
Tony seemed entirely unaware of the harmony of effort and care that went on all around him. He had only eyes for Steve, at whom he stared as if even blinking might set him adrift. Not that Steve was much better; he gazed right back, one of Tony’s hands clasped within two of his own. He stroked the back of Tony’s hand with one thumb and crooned soft reassurances every time Tony seemed to want to get remotely agitated. For the first few minutes, Steve waited on tenterhooks for those moments of disquiet to work themselves into more sustained annoyance or at least confusion at Steve’s presence, but they never did. Tony softened all over again every time Steve did pretty much anything, which pressed every button his Dominant instincts had.
“Please accept my submission, Sir,” he added. It was simple, nothing poetic or complex, but Tony was surprised by how much he meant it, how deeply he needed confirmation that it was time to put himself in the team’s hands. The hand Bruce put on his cheek was so tender that Tony could barely stand the touch.
When he entered the living room again, Steve hesitated a half-step when he found the team’s eyes all on him. Then he nodded sharply in that way he always did when he’d come to a decision and crossed the room in the four long strides. When he reached Tony, he slid to his knees.
The language of warfare was one Thor had had centuries with which to become intimately familiar. He straightened in his seat, eyes reflexively seeking out Mjolnir the same way Steve’s had found his shield when he’d first heard the news. If Tony was at war, then so were the Avengers. (He’d be damned if they lost him again.)
“Yes, we’ve established that. Where the hell is my kid, Rogers? He was supposed to be safe with you, you’re the goddamn responsible one.”
A number of glib responses, filled with Tony’s usual mixture of sarcasm and brutal, self-deprecating honesty, nearly passed his lips. He was the very last one that anyone, let alone someone as fundamentally good and decent as Peter Parker, should have been asking for advice about balancing all the complexities of superheroing with regular life. But he couldn’t quite bring himself to meet Peter’s desperate plea for some kind of guidance with any degree of pessimism.
Your gratitude is much appreciated. While I am unable to share all of the events that landed the so-called MCU Tony in the D/s universe, this glimpse should prove to be particularly enlightening.
“So, you seem to have a bee in your bonnet about this whole Stark thing, and while I sort of get where the other two are coming from, I’m not really sure what’s up with you.”
Steve truly had needed to get work done, but neither he nor Thor had been in a hurry to wrap things up when they’d returned to the tower. So Steve had stripped Thor down to the rope once more and settled him at his feet while Steve drafted a proposal he hoped would answer a lot of the questions they were getting about the workplace orientation pilot program. It had been incredible to have a sub so casually nearby while Steve did something mundane. But…well, he dared anyone with a pulse to have a naked, desperate Thor kneeling in front of them and remain entirely focused on business. When Thor had pleaded to suck him for the third time in half an hour, Steve just hadn’t been able to deny his sub again.
The atmosphere in the penthouse when Phil and Steve entered was utterly bizarre. Pepper and Tony were sharing the couch, petting a bot Steve had never seen before and which appeared to be some kind of sheep or something. Every time Pepper pressed a finger to a sensor pad between its ears, the thing made a low sort of humming noise and tipped its head back like a cat. Next to her, Tony muttered his usual stream of affectionate insults to the bot as he wrapped a blanket tighter around his own shoulders and swiped between several open holoscreens floating in front of them.
Thank you all so much as always for your wonderful comments, kudos, and questions. I love and appreciate hearing from you in any and all forms.
“No, it’s not that.” Well, that was mostly the truth. Sure the idea of sitting at someone’s feet or maybe being hand-fed lunch was starting to feel pretty appealing, but Tony could recognize when he was approaching…well, not dep, he didn’t think his system had enough of the bio-chemical elements of submission present yet to respond that way, but he knew what it felt like for his desire to submit to be edging towards ‘need’ rather than ‘want,’ and he wasn’t there yet. But how could he communicate the vague sense of unease and discontent that had crept its way into his mind lately, especially when so much of his life was closer to perfect than he ever could have hoped? “Really, I’m good. Let’s just get this done.”
The MCU version of Tony, the team agrees, enjoys being touched at least as much, maybe more, than his counterpart, but is far less likely to instigate such exchanges. He also demonstrates greater sensitivity toward most stimuli, including light, sound, and smell.
“WHAT?” at increasingly loud volumes. Natasha didn’t even pause before breaking into a series of hand gestures that even Tony’s relatively untrained eye could recognize as fluent sign language, and their bickering formed a relatively amusing spoken and gestural accompaniment to the meal.
“Yeah, we’ve talked about your reactions to pain too. Natasha said you seemed to enjoy it, but also feel kind of conflicted about your response.” As he spoke, Steve traced little patterns across Tony’s chest with the crop—at least, Tony was pretty sure the thing was called a crop. “The thing to realize is that while it can be used for punishment, it doesn’t have to be. Pain is also just another kind of sensation. In this case, one that might be just distracting enough to help make it easier for you to do what I’ve asked you to do.”
Peter exhaled explosively, petting absently at Butterfingers who had been circling him anxiously for the better part of the last half an hour. (Just like You, who remained a steadfast stan for Rhodey, Butterfingers had apparently imprinted solidly on the kid.) He’d taken off his mask and peeled the suit down off of his arms and chest. It hung bunched at Peter’s waist, and the half-Spidey, half-regular-kid look combined with the lingering remnants of fear on his features made Tony feel impossibly fond.
He was off the bed and on his knees before he’d even consciously planned to stop feigning sleep. By the time Steve seemed to catch up with the sight in front of him, Tony was halfway done unlacing the first boot, and was urging Steve to lift his foot .
Mostly, though, Tony’s focus wasn’t on the big show-stopping moments, but on tiny and often boring details. He would rewind and replay footage where small nicks or tears appeared on the team’s suits, attempting to determine both cause and fix. He was forever tweaking the training modules in the gym and making minuscule adjustments to the Quinjets and dozens upon dozens of other acts of what was essentially maintenance. It was necessary, critical work. It was also hella boring to watch.
But then, if Tony been in some kind of terrible dark plane, he’d have been there because of some kind of magical mix-up, not because he wanted to be there, because he’d
to at least consider the possibility given that the universe he’d found himself stranded in was basically built around it.
“You sure ‘bout that? You didn’t seem to want much of anything to do with him last night, and then decided the best way to go this morning was to scream at him for wearing a shirt that he chose, not to hurt anyone, but probably because it brought him comfort after the hell it sounds like he’s been through. And to top it all off, you screamed at him in a tone that could have, probably
Realizing there was one face he hadn’t seen as he’d stumbled in, Steve peered around the room until his eyes fell upon Tony, who lay half asleep on the other couch, his head pillowed against Bucky’s chest. Bucky, in turn, lay sprawled out with his head in Phil’s lap, not an ounce of the forced submission he’d so often fallen into before the trip about him as Phil idly traced patterns on his back. Clint followed Steve’s gaze and grinned.
“For now it’s an extension of the original contract. She wanted to make sure that what we had still worked for us outside of Wakanda since we’ll be going back and forth so much. But she said that no matter what happened going forward, our time together had been important to her and she wanted to honour that. You put one back around Stark’s neck yet, Sir?”
Steve was silent for several seconds. Peter braced himself for the well-meaning but largely empty platitudes that would come. Then he almost laughed aloud as he pictured the Captain America from the videos at school sighing heavily and sitting down on a backwards chair.
thing, Steve. It means that you have met the goal you established in one of our earliest sessions: you have learned to honour the memory of Tony Stark without being consumed by it. I am, if you’ll permit me to say so, immensely proud of everything you have accomplished in these sessions.”
Peter was laughing before he could inform his brain what a terrible idea that was. It definitely made his head feel like it was splitting open, but it was almost worth it to realize that he could still find momentary amusement in anything, even just the mental image of Captain America making an ass out of himself.
Peter, however, was still recovering. He fell asleep at nine, midway through his assurances to Sam that he was wide awake. Bucky and Sam decided to follow MJ home to smooth any ruffled parental feathers, which left Steve alone. He called May first. It was his third update already that day. It was also the first time Peter had ever been ill in his care, and Steve damn well wasn’t going to keep anything from his parent. They’d agreed, though, to keep May’s knowledge of what had happened a secret for now. Steve wouldn’t lie to Peter if directly asked. However, both of them hoped he would decide to come clean on his own terms.
Tony’s mood was darkening by the second, and being in the shop with nothing to do was only making it worse So he regretfully made his way back to the penthouse, a half-formed plan to take a sleeping pill and have a long afternoon nap in the back of his mind.
“My point, whippersnapper, is that we need to find whatever your equivalent of brushing your teeth is, and maybe a big meal like that was more of a third or a fifth step. I’m going to keep going to the dinners in the meantime. They’re…it was good, I think, to get some adult interaction outside of the hospital, and they seem like a genuinely decent bunch. But maybe for you it’ll be better to spend some time with Tony one-on-one first, especially since the internship will mean you’ll have something besides your personal lives to talk about. Eventually, when you’re ready, whether that’s two or five or fifteen weeks from now, you’ll join us for dinner too.” After a couple of sniffling sounds that May studiously pretended not to hear, Peter straightened up and glanced toward the kitchen.
As always, your questions, comments, and kudos are a bright spot in a dark, weird time. I hope you're all hanging in there!
It wasn’t actually the first time he’d had a reporter come to him like this, feeling the pangs of conscience and begging for forgiveness. In the past, he’d always been able to spin the situation to his advantage, leverage their humanity into something favourable for himself or the company down the line. Doing so now, promising Everhart an exclusive if they broke the news first, or maybe having her come out ahead of the story claiming she’d forged the proof she’d found…the options occurred to him, but it was like having the equivalent of an out-of-body experience in his brain. He registered these thoughts, knew they were the smart and practical things to do, but they felt distant and removed from the terror and utter fury that were dominating all of his more immediate mental processes.
“No, not me. And maybe not you either, Phil. He was pretty quiet when it came to you. But he said something about Sokovia, and some airport in Germany—he was gettin’ really hard to follow by this point. But between that history and the fact that he knows you all are still grieving the other him…well, he’s making a lot of noise about not sticking around the Tower for long.” Steve had already thought of at least seven objections to that plan that had nothing to do with his personal life, and from the mutinous expressions on the rest of his team’s faces, he supposed they were right there with him. Rhodes halted all of them with a raised hand and a glare. “I know, alright? I know. But he’s not thinking clearly right now, about anything; I tried to ask when he’d last gone down and he looked at me like he was just…completely lost. He finally agreed to let Banner get a look at him. If Tones will permit it, Bruce’s gonna give him a sleeping pill when he’s done, knock him right out and let him get a decent night’s sleep. After that, I don’t know. But I’m not leaving until he’s a little steadier on his feet. I’ve now lost this man twice already and I’m sure as hell not planning on goin’ for three.”
“What good am I here?” he asked hopelessly when the latest wave of temper had burned itself out. “I was already lost before. Now, the battle’s over, the world is saved…Peter, I’m
“I’m not going to promise that. If it comes down to a choice between pissing you off and saving your life, then I know what I’ll be picking. But I promise not to call any of them in unless I feel like we’re reaching that point, okay?”
, a category-3 submissive, was unwell for some time due to the absence of orientational dynamics in space. However, he now returns to the planet when necessary, and hopes that his current partnership will develop into a long term contract that will involve his partner travelling with the Guardians.
And, well, the prospect of designing something capable of surprising the unflappable Agent Coulson was one of the more intriguing tasks Tony had been set in a long while, so after that the day had pretty much disappeared in a haze of sketches and programming and simulations. Tony didn’t realize it was closing in on time for dinner (or rather Dinner, because fuck that was today) until JARVIS announced Bruce’s arrival in the shop. He was wearing a flattering set of grey slacks paired with a deep purple button-down which fit Bruce far better than any of the clothes Tony had seen his own version in. While Tony ogled him, Bruce’s attention was on reading the open lines of code on the screen in front of him. Much as it had with Coulson, it felt reassuring to have confirmation that Tony hadn’t been reduced just to a potential romantic partner. Bruce was still his science bro, no matter what else did or didn’t happen between them.
Which, okay. They probably missed other-Tony (he’d have to come up with a snappier way to refer to the guy—Phony would be funny, but they’d probably be pretty pissed if he ever accidentally said it out loud). But then, when he had realized this Clint was using hearing aids (more Stark tech!) and asked if the guy wanted the closed captioning on, it had happened again.
.” This drew a harsh, bitter laugh which never should have emerged from someone as young as Peter. Steve winced.
“Shh!” Her reached out to throw a hand over her mouth and then winced, drawing it away as if burned. If waiting for Kamala on her usual route home was a little suspect, trying to cover her mouth was way more so. He was going to have to get some tips from Steve or Coulson when it came to this whole recruiting thing. “Sorry. But seriously, you gotta be quiet, kid. It’s kind of a miracle I got here without tipping off any press.” Kamala nodded, her eyes wide with fear or excitement, or maybe both. Probably both. From everything he’d been able to find out, the kid really did love superheroes.
He shivered, wishing he’d taken the suggestion to put on one of the other Tony’s old flight suits that he usually wore under the armour. To be fair, when JARVIS had sounded a localized alert not for the Avengers but specifically for Thor, Tony had reasonably assumed their date was on hold. Instead, the demigod had beamed.
Other than that, the only warning I can think of is that Tony remains somewhat at odds with himself about his submission, and especially about his relationship to the concept of punishments. That comes somewhat to a head in this chapter, and while I would firmly classify everything that happens as Risk Aware Consensual Kink, I again recognize that sometimes what readers feel constitutes adequate negotiation/discussion can vary.
Along with the weird compliments came what seemed to be a team-wide concern for his every comfort. He shivered exactly once, mainly because this version of his Black Sabbath t-shirt had even more holes in it than Tony’s other one; Coulson was on him in seconds with a thick, heavy blanket. When Tony complained idly about Rhodey’s shoulder being too hard, mostly to try to give the guy an out if he wanted to stop cuddling Tony, Thor fetched a large, squashy pillow, helped Tony lift his head, and slid it atop Rhodey’s chest for him to rest on. That was the last straw.
The problem was that it was a lot easier to take in information about this universe than offer any about his own, even the seemingly innocuous stuff. Nat and Clint had been generally willing to accept that without a lot of pushing; Tony could barely remember what all he'd babbled to Rhodey his first night here, but the team did seem to have a general idea that his version of the Avengers had not been able to pull off the happy-family shtick they did here.
No content notes I can think of in this one, beyond a semi-explicit start of a scene between Nat and Tony. If you're sex-repulsed, don't enjoy het pairings, or just don't want to read it, just skip the last section of the chapter beginning "Unlike with Clint..."
“You’re not just Iron Man,” she breathed, and at least her voice was close to a whisper, so Tony was going to go ahead and take the win. “You’re going to the Director of SHIELD, it’s on all the chatboards. Am I in trouble?”
Today the directions didn’t feel annoying, they felt stabilizing. The rules were clear and simple and Steve was telling him precisely what they were, leaving no room for Tony to worry he’d screwed up somehow. Once they were arranged on the couch to Steve’s satisfaction (both still naked, but covered by Tony’s heavy blanket and surrounded by a wall of pillows)  Steve hand-fed him tiny sandwiches on gluten free bread and what felt like an endless selection of fruit.
pour a bowl of cereal. And then I’d brush my teeth, pour some cereal, and make some coffee. Eventually, I was making it through whole mornings, and then whole days. But I had to start by brushing my teeth.”
It took some convincing, and more pleading than Tony would ever admit to, but eventually he was permitted to dress and depart the bedroom, Dummy hot on his tail. Having company turned out to be a plus because navigating the kitchen was…challenging. Tony certainly had a new appreciation for the deviousness of that genre of pranks where each item in a room was moved just slightly, because everything in this version of the penthouse was exactly the same…except for minor distinctions that left him constantly looking in the wrong cupboard or bashing into the island (two inches off of where it had been in the other Tower.)
This will of course include standardized mitochondrial DNA testing, which focuses on regions of DNA referred to as micro- or mini-satellites and compares repeating sequences within those regions. This process is commonly referred to as creating a ‘DNA fingerprint.’ While Wakanda still chooses to keep most of the details of the practice a secret, their identity-testing is considered second to none because they also utilize a procedure involving the exposure of human genetic materials to small quantities of vibranium. Each unique sample supposedly responds to this process in ways that are slightly but measurably distinct, allowing for a more precise analysis.
He glanced to his right and smiled fondly at Bucky, whose nose was dotted with drying pink paint as he knelt in front of a power outlet, changing the cover to one of the new gold-plated ones they had ordered. Bucky and the Soldier had both been instrumental in putting the room together; the Soldier, especially, had been full of unexpected insights.
There were pages and pages of experiments that grew increasingly desperate. And then Howard had apparently cracked the case…by taking a nap.
Thor’s surprise at the invitation was evident, and even if it sort of broke Steve’s heart a bit he couldn’t really blame the guy. He was just starting to realize now how much his relationship with his teammates had been on autopilot while he’d mourned Tony. It would take time before they really believed that they had Steve back.
“You are welcome to see the Bifrost at any time. I did consider bringing you to Asgard this evening, but the Son of Coul reminded me that you are still growing accustomed to one new world and may not appreciate being exposed to another quite so soon. My Mother does yearn to see you, however, and sends her regards.” Thor offered it just like that, like it would be nothing to just take Tony to Asgard, and to bear the thousands of questions Tony would undoubtedly have after a journey like that. After that even the comment about Thor’s mother, who undoubtedly was referring to Mark II, could’t do more than sting faintly.
“So wait, that purple thing yesterday, that was for me, wasn’t it? I was supposed to kneel at your feet?” Bruce didn’t smile. He didn’t laugh at their cultural incongruences the way he had been all day. For  just a few seconds, he was visibly and totally wrecked, his grief for Phony (ugh, that was starting to sound callous even to him—Stark Mark 2, maybe?) an almost palpable thing. Tony stood, frozen, trying to determine whether leaving Bruce alone with his sorrow or trying, somehow, to comfort him was the best way forward. Ultimately, he edged closer to the other man and took a long, deliberate inhalation, definitely loud enough to be audible to Bruce’s enhanced senses. Then, as they locked eyes, he released it. Bruce smiled, bittersweet and pained, but still a smile as he joined Tony on the next set, and they stood there and breathed together until Bruce could manage to speak again.
Helping Barnes felt like something solid to hold onto, so Tony grasped it with all his might and pulled, both figuratively and literally. He seized Bucky’s hand in his own and stood; he had no illusions that he would have actually succeeded at moving Bucky if the guy didn’t allow it, but Tony chose not to think about that much just now.
This is an excellent question. Had the conversation about Stark returning to his original universe proceeded much further, this is undoubtedly an avenue that would have been investigated thoroughly.
“I guess it’ll be good training for college dorms, right? I mean, if you can negotiate a chore chart with literal superheroes, a 19 year old who hogs the common area and eats all the good chips is going to be a snap.”
Getting back in the armour for real had been less traumatic than Tony had imagined, but he hadn’t seen that much consecutive action since the Infinity War. He was tired. He was thoroughly annoyed. And he did not want to spend the morning completing more training, regardless of how helpful it might be for Steve’s anxiety. So he played it just slightly dirty, sliding to the edge of the bed and hooking his legs around Steve’s absurdly narrow hips and burying his face against Steve’s neck.
“You should ask that question not just of yourself, but about your loved ones as well. Because if I do show you the things I could show you, your next demand will be to have their Dr. Strange deliver messages. Mr. Parker and Mr. Keener, correctly believing you not to be deceased, have been seeking out methods of contact since the battle. Fortunately they do not yet have the skills or knowledge to succeed in their efforts, and my other self suspects they will exhaust their time and resources before they pose any real danger. However, you might consider whether or not it would be kinder to let those around them continue to persuade them, as they are now trying to do, that you are and have always been lost to them.”
“You’re going to spend today with me. You’re going to stay in those cuffs for the morning; I’ll feed you breakfast, maybe we’ll watch a movie or something. And when Tony comes up, I suggest the two of you make plans for another date. My impression from what he’s let slip about the other universe is that on top of the choking, the other Thor spent a lot of his time off-world. So even though the other Steve hurt him too, for instance, he presumably has at least some pleasant memories too. He doesn’t have that with you, or at least not as much. So you two might need to put a bit more work in at the beginning just getting to know each other.”
Tony felt, honestly, like a little bit of a creep, emerging from a dimly lit part of an alley in Jersey City to talk to a young girl. But sneaking into her home the way he had Peter’s back in his old universe was not an option. He watched as Kamala jumped, saw the effort and control it took for her to reign in a reflexive use of her powers to defend herself against an unknown foe. (The girl was good.)
But damn it was just so hard to exhibit even a hint of respect for men like Richards. He had all the arrogance of someone who had never known or expected anything but power, but yet no clear reason to feel so eminently proud of himself. From all Tony had gathered and confirmed with Pepper so far, the guy was never one for ideas, or vision, or risk of any kind that might harm the bottom line. He was all about short-term gain and never rocking the boat, even for the sake of longer term benefit. Yet here he sat, legs splayed so wide that he claimed an entire long side of the coffee table they were seated at to himself, and a grin so smug and self-satisfied that he might have been announcing how he had single-handedly kept SI afloat in Tony’s absence. (He wondered absently if it would be worth paying one of the staff to ‘accidentally’ pour coffee on the guy if Tony needed a quick out, but discarded the thought almost immediately. Richards would definitely be the type to try to sue a minimum-wage employee into personal bankruptcy.)
“Live not for Battles Won./Live not for The-End-of-the-Song./Live in the along,” Gwen agreed. As Peter stared at her with the mix of fascination and utter confusion that was becoming far too familiar in his interactions with her, she laughed. “Gwendolyn Brooks. I’m named after her, actually.”
“I think we should probably talk, sweetheart. Is that alright with you? Did you get what you needed from your quiet time yesterday?”
“I mean if you want the wedding to be more formal I’m happy to wait as long as you need to plan it, sweetheart. But there’s food we actually like at all these carts, and Rhodey is on leave for a couple more weeks, and since I know you already have most of the paperwork filled out, I’m betting we could have someone out here in half an hour. Maybe less depending on traffic.”
“So you’re bleeding from your cheek here. Anywhere else I need to know about?” Tony rolled his eyes with a hint of a playful grin, forgetting for just for a moment to be guarded and scared and whatever else he was feeling; witnessing this scene, one that had played out a hundred times exactly like this, was almost worse than the moment when Tony remembered where he was and brought all his walls back up.
“In his case I’m betting they’re a bit too connected for that.” This, at least, was news to Steve. He wished suddenly that he hadn’t drank the last of the Asgardian mead Thor had on Earth during their vacation. “I think part of the reason he’s clinging to superheroing so hard even though it’s practically tearing his life apart is that it’s the only outlet he’s getting for his Dominant urges. He doesn’t have a sub or a Switch to care for, so he’s taken on a whole borough.”
!” Steve shouted. His voice echoed through the cavernous living room, his own anger and hurt and fearful hope bouncing off the walls and furniture and back at Steve. Perhaps he was a terrible pseudo-parent for being unable to put his own reactions aside. It certainly wouldn’t be the first mistake he’d made with the kid. But he couldn’t move a single foot away from his spot until he knew for sure just what this meant.
“Ever since our Tony died, the board has been making every possible play to move us back towards weapons manufacturing. It started with stuff fairly above-board, just sneaky—lobbying for contracts to make things that, while not technically weapons themselves, could easily be weaponized in very few steps. We’d have clauses in the paperwork forbidding that they be used that way, of
(Author’s Note: I am so delighted this question got asked! I had a version of this scene written ages ago, but couldn’t make it work with Tony and Steve as our only POV characters in the main verse. Thank you, anon!)
No one would even tell him if Steve was planning to attend, which undoubtedly meant he was still holed up in the gym.  This suspicion was confirmed when Tony stepped out of the elevator and into the penthouse living room to find the rest of the team gathered, with Steve’s spot on the couch conspicuously open.
Whelp, this is another one of those chapters that has been living in my head for so long that it feels almost surreal to have it actually down on screen. I really, really hope that the payoff for those of you who have been waiting on Peter since the beginning was worth it! It was, of course, much more the beginning of something than any kind of definitive resolution, but it's a start!
Tony stood up. As he straightened his spine, the black gouge the shield had left behind in the suit began to repair itself, infinitesimally tiny pieces of metal weaving and suturing their way across the damaged portion.
The gauntlet. Pain beyond any he had ever experienced. Pain that deconstructed him where he sat slumped the battlefield, the Infinity Stones glowing eerily at his fist. He’d worried that the power would be appealing, that he’d be intoxicated by it the same he felt after a few rounds of good scotch or a conversation about science and the universe with Bruce. It felt nothing at all like that. The world lay, quite literally, at his fingertips, a tremendous, horrible weight that Tony couldn’t possibly hope to carry, had never wanted to carry.
