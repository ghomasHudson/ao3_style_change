Sherlock swore inwardly. He mustn't talk, it's safer. He felt a hand rest gently against his cheek and Sherlock plunged into the contact without thinking. The
"Go ahead, I'll wait for you."
Sherlock closes his eyes to fight back the tears of shame that want to escape when he hears John's oh-so-sweet, surprised voice.
As promised he waited for him until he got home and smiled when he felt a dip in his mattress followed by a body he cherished pressed against his back and arms keeping him in place around his waist. The jumper, meanwhile, is back on John - he picked it up when he was in Sherlock's chair on the way home - and Sherlock turns between his arms to bury his face in it and smell his scent, John's scent. But this time, there's the one carrying it with him and it's better than he thought.
Sherlock hates John's jumpers. They are seen as tasteless, with dubious patterns. There's also the fact that they draw women's attention to John, showing a "lovely" and "sweet" side according to some, but Sherlock refuses to admit this to himself.

"Are you okay?"
-You're going to be late.
"Hey! Sherlock, look at me.
Sherlock is startled, and immediately pulls the jumper from his face. He tries to hide his embarrassment by avoiding John's gaze. Probably a look that means he thinks he's weird. Everyone does. He knew John would do it at some point.
It's John's turn to be petrified with surprise, but soon he folds under the caress of Sherlock's lips. They don't go any further than mouth to mouth, as a promise to continue later what they started. Sherlock intends to keep his promise for the rest of his life.
He brings it up to his face, smelling tea, the clinic and cheap cologne. It's a mixture Sherlock would have considered repulsive but there's something indefinable about John's smell, it's like finding something you've needed for years without even knowing it. It's better than drugs and Sherlock is already addicted. He'll need more than a cure to get rid of it. His brain stops working to just feel.
John pulls back because of the breath and his back suffers from being bent over but remains inches from Sherlock's face. He looks for confirmation that all is well in Sherlock's eyes. Sherlock smiles slightly at him, reassuring John.
hand pressed firmly, a finger caressing his cheekbone. The second hand rested on his lap, to keep John's balance but also to bring him back to earth. Sherlock opened his eyes and John was still standing before him with the same adoring expression.

(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock remembered a "Pub with Graham" -or was it Geof?- in one of John's sentences while he wasn't listening. He sulked even more when he realised he was going to spend the evening alone. What he didn't expect was for John to take off his jumper in front of him, putting it on the small table next to his chair. It was early summer in London, which might explain why John preferred to leave his jumper on and just be in his shirt and jacket -it wasn't yet warm enough to go out in a single layer- and he liked having pockets, which his jumper didn't have.

Sherlock pointed to the object in question, hidden by Scotland Yard papers and files on their desk. John thanked him half-heartedly. But when Sherlock expected him to leave without saying anything, he was confused to see him standing before him smiling.

Sherlock attempted to navigate the flood of dread that was suddenly unleashed in the vicinity of his navel.

“You saved me- not from the world, Sherlock, from myself.”
John was aware that his hand was moving, his body twisting as he pulled aside his jumper. But he could not follow the motion with his eyes- they were locked on Sherlock’s face, captivated by the words written in the sharp plane of his cheeks, the slant of his eyes, the curve of his lips:

He swallowed the rest of his words and waited for the rising tears to recede. Through the blur of saltwater he watched Sherlock sit motionless across from him, his narrow chest rising and falling too rapidly.

The clink of glassware drifted from the direction of the kitchen and John abandoned the newspaper, placing it warily on the side table. He tried to leave his dread there, too, beneath the folds of the paper, but it didn’t work. So he looked away, straightening his legs and glancing at the flecks of dust adorning his shoes. He wondered what Sherlock had read in the pattern of soil and concrete that was incomprehensible to his own eyes. Sherlock was always reading things, sensing things, knowing things as if the universe broadcast the answer to its mysteries on a wavelength normal people were not equipped to receive. Sometimes John had the feeling Sherlock was reading him, too. Tuning in to a secret transmission he wasn’t aware he had authorized his body to give.

But the matter-John was off limits.
“There was about to be an especially marvelous murder on Andre Street.”
“Lestrade!”
“He wears his heart on his sleeve, that one,” an old woman was saying, stirring her coffee primly. Sherlock had wrinkled his nose at the phrase. It made no sense, just another example of sentiment bleeding into imprecise idioms. He knew, of course, that the woman meant her acquaintance was far too forthcoming with his emotions. But one’s heart had nothing to do with feeling; sentiment was nothing more than the nuanced shift of neurochemicals. Besides, why would one display such whims on the sleeve of one’s garment? It would be much more effective to communicate with one’s face, as John did so effortlessly.

Sherlock covered his ears.
And that meant Sherlock had gone horribly wrong, somewhere in the last few days. The last few months, maybe. At some point he had replaced the real John with the one in his mind, the one who had kept him company during his years of dark places and dark thoughts. Because he had kissed John, the one he’d thought was real, three days ago- yet there had been no consequences. There had been no silent explosion, no forced smiles or “goodbye Sherlock,” and the real John would never have let that happen.
John clenched his teeth. Why did Mycroft have to make everything sound so bloody
Sherlock closed his eyes again, slowly, and then opened them when the last of the silver spots had danced away from the edges of his vision. He cleared his throat to offer a perfectly rational explanation for his behavior, but John beat him to it, apparently satisfied that Sherlock was alive enough to be chastised for whatever it was he had just done wrong.

This time John cut him off.
Sherlock was quite certain he had been impaled. He realized suddenly that it was possible for words to be more painful than a collision with concrete, and only managed to keep breathing because he knew John would become even more distraught if he failed to do so.
John stood there for a moment, staring at the man who had been so broken
John barely heard him. He was staring at the space by Mycroft’s side, usually occupied by an umbrella but now conspicuously empty. The taller man looked… somehow deflated without his usual companion, and John had to wrench his gaze back up to Mycroft’s face. He was met with a look of unfiltered disdain.

John was not sure if it was his breath or Sherlock’s that was coming in ragged gasps now.
Not from a rooftop, no- he jumped in his chair, flinching away from the blurry shape that hovered before him. He blinked, squinting against the sudden brightness until the shape solidified into a short, compact figure in a maroon jumper.
John looked down at him, his face shattering into a thousand fragments of emotion.
“Shh,” he whispered, and Sherlock trembled at his touch. He resembled a

Mycroft spoke again, interrupting his thoughts.
He swayed a moment on his feet, as though his body were trying to resist the destination towards which his mind now raced. Pulled by invisible strings, Sherlock teetered forwards, then back. A gossamer thread, woven from names, tugged him gently away from the edge—

Only it was not flawless, not anymore. The crimson streak that stretched across Sherlock’s temple- the mark of his most recent rooftop dance with death- drew John’s gaze like a bloodstain on bleached paper. The glaring evidence of Sherlock’s humanity, of the fragility he tried so hard to hide, snapped the final unbroken pillar of John’s resolve and he leaned forward. The planets had surely swung round in their orbits by the time John’s lips met Sherlock’s brow; the celestial spheres had come into alignment, tugging with invisible strings to bring these two bodies together in the kitchen of 221B Baker Street.

John laughed, the way he did when there were no words to express what he really wanted to say. But he tried anyway, stringing together the syllables like a necklace of broken beads.
Sherlock spun around, whipping his coat behind him in a vicious rejection of the possibility that John was actually dead. He began to pace, willing his mind to precipitate a more coherent explanation.

John waited for the dizziness to pass, settling into the silence that followed. Before him, eyes contorted like a wounded animal, Sherlock waited for his condemnation. Sometimes John was shocked by the detective’s resemblance to something wild, untamed. If intelligence was the measure of humanity, Sherlock was as far from animalistic as any man could be. Yet in moments like this, he moved with the raw grace of a beast not quite socialized, not quite domesticated… at once dangerous and beautiful and now poised to flee like a great cat confronting an uncertain threat. There was something vulnerable in his eyes, a yearning to be touched, and yet it was shadowed by the constant fear of rejection.

It was Sherlock’s turn to look away. He let his eyes settle on the microscope again, feeling his pupils dilate in response to the harsh white glow. A reflex, his brain adjusting ocular muscles to save him the pain of looking into such brightness. Automatic, just like the tightening in his chest, the hitched breath he stumbled through as his ears registered the agony in John’s voice. It was Sherlock’s body trying to protect him again, but this was a light from which he did not want to be sheltered. He did not want to hide from John’s incandescence- not when

He broke off for a minute, closing his eyes, and Sherlock drank in the new pattern of lines that appeared around the man’s mouth. This was a novel one, this expression. A combination of John’s “I don’t want to talk about it” and his “I wish I understood you” and something of his “I’m regretting even asking this question.” Sherlock filed it away for future reference, trying not to think about that fact that the images in his mind palace would soon be all he had left of John.

Folding in on himself, he allowed the emptiness to spread through his veins like anesthesia. The breath left his lungs in a sigh, carrying with it the agony and fear and desperation that had torn through his body at the thought of John’s departure. It was easier, this numbness, than than suffering through the internal lacerations of grief. So Sherlock surrendered himself to the void, giving in to the blackness closing in over his head.
For that is what he had been- irrational, insane- when he stepped forward to the edge of the roof and realized that there was
When John regained awareness of his feet on solid ground, he realized Sherlock was looking at him intently, eyes narrowed in that delicate way he sometimes looked at an especially puzzling dead body. Only there was something different about his gaze, about the way his slender fingers had locked around John’s wrist. It was like he was holding onto something incredibly fragile, something that might evaporate if he let go.

Sherlock rubbed his eyes, taking a step away from the edge of the roof. Three minutes, 180 precious seconds left before someone arrived to berate him for his recklessness. He knew Lestrade had set up cameras on the rooftop after he’d returned. In all likelihood Mycroft had been a part of the operation as well, and would arrive along with half of Scotland Yard to ask for a list.
John’s voice seemed to travel through Sherlock’s bones, through his metacarpals and carpals and radius and ulna and humorous until his sternum was vibrating with the sound of his own name and—
He paused, waiting for a reaction, but continued when there was none.
Somewhere in the distance a door was slamming. Footsteps echoed on the tiled hospital floor, the light patter of a woman’s feet and the louder click of a man’s stride. John stirred against the sharp edges of the plastic chair he had occupied for the last three hours, pulled up as close to Sherlock’s bed as he could manage. The man hadn’t stirred since he’d collapsed and been hauled back onto the blank white mattress by no less than five nurses. Apparently his attempt at escape had triggered an alarm in the nurse’s station down the hall, and half the floor had come running.

He looked down at John,

Sherlock didn’t look away, but his expression had changed. Fear had been abandoned for the unbridled honesty of a man facing death- or rather, the far more painful punishment of being left alone with his mind.

In the same moment that Sherlock felt his fingers rejoin the physical world, his vision cleared and a hospital room materialized around him.
Did you see, John, did you—”
Upon further analysis, John was quite sure his knees were no longer up to the task of supporting his body. He drew up a chair and collapsed onto the hard wooden seat, letting his head fall forward onto his hands.
Sorry for the suspense… but never fear, the resolution is here!  Thanks as always to everyone who’s sticking with the story, and my wonderful beta-reader :)
gently across Sherlock’s lips.
John realized it was pointless to resist; evasion was not a tactic that worked with Sherlock. He would press on, delving towards the answer he sought like a heat-seeking missile. He had hunted down John’s birth certificate just to discover the man’s middle name- if he wanted to know something, he would find a way to make John tell him. Better to be up front with him and avoid the collateral damage.
But these were not the eyes of John Watson. In their place was only—

“You can’t just end a conversation and then start it up again whenever it suits you,” he said, slowly, pretending that he was imagining the annoyance seeping into his own voice. He had asked Sherlock about Mary to distract him- to reassure the detective that he was not alone in being haunted by nightmares and specters. And now Sherlock had managed to make John the subject of another interrogation completely.
Apparently this irrational hope disappeared when his eyes flickered open again to find Sherlock seated peacefully in the milky white glow of the microscope. John started to turn away with a little half-shake of his head, but then seemed to think better of it and squared his shoulders again in Sherlock’s direction.

He felt his mind begin to scroll through possible responses to his present situation, but there was no protocol for providing emotional comfort. All his programmed reactions felt suddenly inadequate, fake, the empty motions of a robot who had been hastily taught the rules of human interaction.
“You say there’s a sequel to this?” Sherlock asks, taking John’s hand in his own.
“I really don’t know, Molly. John’s a tough man but you’ve got to have some strength to come back from that.” Molly shook her head slightly as a gasp escaped her lips. She was rather fond of John. “And as for Sherlock…honestly? I have no idea. You know how he and John are… I can’t imagine what he’s going through right now. The drugs can’t be helping him.”
"Yes, John. Mmph." John angled his hips, pushing deeper and deeper, wanting more and more. He needed more. He needed to give Sherlock as much pleasure as possible.
couldn't overlook either. Neither one of them knew how much time passed between them, both men remaining silent as they digested what had been said. Eventually, John found his voice again.
“Mycroft, Molly and Lestrade are in the waiting room.” Sherlock said whilst tapping the tips of his fingers to the tips of John’s. He avoided mentioning that they were with him due to the events of last night. “I already know that you’re too tired to want to see any of them, which is why I’m still here and they haven’t been in, because I wanted to see you for longer.”
As Sherlock is calling the ambulance John leans back against the sofa with his head resting on the cushion that smells so much of Sherlock that it manages to calm him down immediately. Christ, if he could just stay in this spot forever, with Sherlock by his side, John would be content. Music is coming from a stereo in the corner of the room and John immediately recognises it as a recording of one of Sherlock’s own compositions and it’s relaxing. It’s the most relaxed he has felt in weeks and he wants to stay in that moment. He wants to stay there on Sherlock’s sofa without a care in the world.
The crying subsides and Sherlock stands, making his way over to the light switch to turn it off. He returns to the bed, takes his shirt off and flings it to the pile of clothes in a heap on his floor. John does the same and Sherlock climbs into the other side of the bed, dragging the duvet up over them and snuggling down next to John. It’s never gone further than this but John thinks, even if it doesn’t end up going further, he’d be fine with that.
"I. Mum. Sherlock and I... we...mmm... we're..." He knew what he had to say, the words just wouldn't come out!
Harry ended up in the hospital. The police had been informed that Harry was victim to a mugging and the officers didn't suspect anything further. It made John and his mother sick to their stomachs but they just couldn't say anything. His sister was old enough to leave home and the only time John was allowed to see her was when his father was on business trips. Even then, his father detested the idea of his son going near her. He didn't want him to be 'influenced by her vulgar choices.'
John had been sleeping on the sofa all day, exhausted from his most recent chemotherapy session. At the beginning of his diagnosis John had agreed to go through with the treatment to prolong his life for as long as he could. The sound of the door creaking shut woke John from his sleep. "Sherlock?" He called out, rubbing the sleep from his eyes. The red beanie (Sherlock's favourite beanie, although he was reluctant to admit) had fallen from his head and landed on to the floor, beside his oxygen tank. "Sherlock?"
It is as if we are both scared of what could happen tomorrow. I am. I've no idea about him. Even the mere thought of the coming months makes me want to scream at the top of my lungs.
"Don't." It is a warning. We remain in silence for around five minutes before Lestrade dares address the situation again.
I cannot seem to stop shaking. I am unsteady as I reach the car and sit in the passenger seat, the seat that John was in not ten minutes beforehand. I ball my fingers into a fist, the skin of my knuckles turning white, but even that doesn't seem to stop my reaction. Shock, my mind supplies. I am going into shock. The DI straps himself into the seat beside me and I turn to face him, noting his reactions.
Sherlock stopped eating and put his fourth bourbon back on his plate before lifting his head and looking at Mrs Hudson. “I am worried.”
Mycroft exhales, repeating his sentence again. "When you began your acquaintanceship with John Watson, I did not believe it would be at all beneficial to you, Sherlock."
“Really?” Sherlock nodded.
John turned his head and kissed Sherlock. “I’m so thankful for you. More than you’ll ever know.”
His body was sprawled out on the floor, right next to the front door. His right leg was higher than the rest of his body-it was elevated by the final steps on the staircase. The left leg was awkwardly twisted, his kneecap being back to front. Sherlock's eyes scanned to higher up his body. The bruises on his ribcage were a menacing black, contrasting remarkably with the pale pigmentation of his skin.
“Now that he’s seen John, yes but-“
"Is there much hope for improvement?"
“Swan.”
His moan was filthy as he released himself into my body, gasping out my name. I squeezed my legs around him, pulling him down so his body was resting on top of my own. My fingers made my way to his head and I scrunched my fingers into his hair, smiling as I adjusted him so his forehead was pressing against mine, our breaths mingling in the air between us.
of bones breaking. A jaw, a skull, a nose. His actions are futile, for the man sprawled out on the pavement is already dead. There is not a brain left in his head.
I'm getting tired now. Lethargy is carefully dancing around me, occasionally holding onto my skin and tugging at it.
"John?" Sherlock turned the corner from the kitchen into the living room, two cups of coffee held firmly in his hands. When he saw what the other man was looking at he immediately set the mugs down on the coffee table, striding over to John and removing the hair from his hand. "Do you want to go through with it?" John didn't need to question what Sherlock was on about- they had already discussed it.
"I know something's bad." I am taken aback by how abrupt he is but, then again, John Watson never fails to surprise me. He isn't an idiot, no matter how many times I tell him he is. "Please, Sherlock." I know what he's asking.
“He is going to be ok though, isn’t he?” Molly asked, arms folded as she spoke to Lestrade in the hallway. “John, I mean. I suppose Sherlock as well.”
"I love you, you know that?" He asks me, his voice breaking slightly on the last three words. I nod and feel tears threatening to spill from my eyes. Ridiculous emotions. "I know you've been dreading this. Shit, I've been terrified too. Bloody hell, I still am." He chuckles but I can tell that he does not mean it. He is trying to disguise what he is really feeling, hide himself to pretend that this really isn't happening.
He silently cried beneath me, his whole body shuddering as he released sob upon sob upon sob. "I'm being so fucking pathetic." John muttered, pounding his fist into the mattress. I knew that he struggled with expressing himself, that he always tried to put on a brave face for his mother.
“How long ago did you have a drink?” His voice takes on an air of seriousness and John feels another pang of guilt, the second time this evening. It’s not fair on Sherlock.
"What the hell happened to you?"
If you want to shout,
Sherlock's voice was so quiet when he said the next three words that I almost missed them. "Marry me, John."
The detective took tentative steps towards the bed in which John was laying, white blanket resting gently against his abdomen and chest tube inserted on his left side, and sat down beside him in a rather uncomfortable white chair. He carefully reached his arm out to encase John’s considerably colder hand in his own, entwining their fingers together in a touch that was reassuring to Sherlock.
We made it up the seventeen steps to the flat and within a second of the door slamming shut, Sherlock was pinning me against the wall of 221B Baker Street and kissing me fervently, grabbing my hips with his hands and pulling me into him.
“I didn’t even know that the earth revolved around the sun until a few weeks ago.” Sherlock smirked and followed John’s finger as it drew through the air.
"Is Dad home?" John asked as he released Sherlock's hand, nodding at him slightly as he did so. His mum replied immediately, a small smile plastered on her face.
John’s thumb brushed over Sherlock’s cheekbone before entwining his fingers through Sherlock’s hair and pulling his head down until their lips met. “You’re so beautiful.” Sherlock manages between gasps, revelling in John. Every movement creates a rhythm that flows in perfect harmony and they’re lost entirely, lost in another world created just for the two of them. Sherlock cannot help but smile. This, right now, is everything he could have wanted. Everything he needed.
John sighs as feeling returns to his body, and he is suddenly overcome with an onslaught of agony.
“We are having this discussion now and you need to listen to me!” Mr Watson snapped. Mrs Watson flinched.
They had been together for five months now. Five months of secret kisses and subtle glances, of always sneaking Sherlock into the house late at night when he'd been having trouble at home. It really had only started off as that, just two teenagers discovering one another. However, over the course of those few months, things began to grow and feelings were developed. Now, the two were practically inseparable: trapped in their own bubble, secluded from the outside world.
"John, it was your decision if and when you were going to tell me about you and Sherlock. I wasn't going to say anything until you felt comfortable enough to tell me."
“Let’s get you cleaned up.” The detective inspector led him away to the nearest bathroom and pressed his blood soaked hands under the tap, scrubbing them with his own hands. Sherlock stood still, the severity of the situation taking its toll on him. Lestrade had taken some paper towels from the dispenser and was now holding them under the stream of water as well, before he took them in hand and wiped it on Sherlock’s forehead.
“Hello, Mrs Hudson.” John smiled, albeit feebly, but it was a smile nonetheless. He then smiled at Sherlock. “Hey.”
She flopped on the sofa before bursting in to tears. “I miss Clara.”
They didn't mask their sadness at all. No one did.
Emma Louise Watson was thirty eight years old when she lost her only son, her beautiful, loving, extraordinary son.
"No, you don't understand. You have never shown any interest or concern about John before, and now that he's dead you feel the need to have to speak about him like he was your bloody best friend. You have never fucking cared for him so stop pretending like you did just because you've fancied him for the past year and a half. He didn't care about you, you knew nothing about him so just stop fucking acting like you knew him! You didn't, none of you did!" Somehow I had managed to stand up and I was shouting at them, cursing.
"He's
“Why are you doing this? What satisfaction are you gaining?” He was shouting now, his voice barely suppressing the anger that had been slowly building ever since Mycroft had arrived at the hospital. Lestrade knew this wasn’t going to be pleasant, which is exactly what he had feared.
Someone calling for John's name brought his attention back to the real world and he opened his eyes which he hadn't realised had remained closed. "John!" The voice was distinctly male although whoever's voice it was, he couldn't identify. "John, I need you to stay awake for me. Can you do that?"
“What do you mean
“Greg, it’s fine.”
the car had smashed into him and sent him flying up and over it. I could see him in the air and it felt like a century before he touched the ground but he did, eventually. He finally collided with the concrete of the road with an awful cracking sound.
“What does-“
"I should hope so," Sherlock chuckled, but it was without humour. There wasn't going to be any humour for the foreseeable future, as far as Sherlock was concerned. Before John could continue speaking, Sherlock carried on. "How long?"
I would get to be with mum, with Kaylei, with James because they were the three most important people in my life and they had gone and surely I should have been allowed to be with them?
“John?”
“You need to come down-“
"He will never walk again! How can he be doing well when it hasn't even been two days since his whole life has changed?" I am furious at everything. How can this have happened? Why him? Why does he have to go through this?
“Evening, John.” Mr Holmes says from across the table.
"How much do you remember?" I ask him, careful not to reveal too much until Dr Pace can explain it properly. He will understand it all already, of course. He's probably spoken the exact words to his patients which Dr Pace will say to him. I inwardly cringe at the thought.
She insists that they don’t buy her a wig. It’ll only be itchy, she says, so she doesn’t get one. Besides, it’ll grow back eventually.
"No." A choked sob escaped John's mouth as the word came out in a scared whisper. Manoeuvring round, Sherlock twisted John so that he was facing him, legs on either side of his hips, foreheads resting against one another.
and that was all that mattered. Moriarty was gone. Mary was gone. There wasn't anyone to stop us.
"If you want me to stop..." John let out a shaky breath. "If you want me to stop all you need to do is tell me. Just say it and I will stop. I promise."
John remained silent as he witnessed his remaining hair fall from his head. Never once did he say a word.
He squeezes John’s hand before letting go.
We return to the room and I take my place beside John again. His eyes have fluttered closed and I am reluctant to wake him. "John," I whisper, my voice not quite there. I clear it before repeating his name again. On the fourth time I say his name, he startles awake but the supports prevent him from moving. He starts to panic, his eyes frantic and searching around the room.
But I cannot. I will not.
I do it to protect his modesty aswell, although he probably doesn't care for that at this minute. In the background an alarm is ringing out and I can smell burning rubber. A group of people are forming around us but Lestrade is hollering at them, telling them to stay back. I can still hear screaming.
Are-"
John's smile turned into an all-out grin and laughter bubbled from his mouth. Was this really happening? Making his way to the bottom of the stairs, John was about to join Sherlock but before he could step foot on the first step, his mother called out to him. "John? One more thing." He turned to face his mother, noticing that she had pulled out a chair from underneath the kitchen table and placed it next to the cupboards. She stepped onto the chair and reached up, rummaging on the highest shelf, in the teacups that were more for show than for use. Confusion swept over John. What was she doing?
When he tells me that I am now a paraplegic, that I will never walk again, I am emotionless.
“They were all morons. Besides, I’m fine now. Since rehab didn’t work Mycroft has upped the surveillance on me. Won’t be getting in to any trouble any time soon.”
"Thirty three. Eleven fatalities. I made a senseless mistake and now look where we are." Sherlock clenched his jaw tightly together, frustration building up inside of him.
"I can't." He replied, his voice laced with a pain that I myself had never experienced. I could see him trying to hold back some more tears but without success. Lifting my arm up, I used my free hand to brush away one of the droplets of water using my thumb and pulled him close to me so his head was resting underneath my chin.
Snivels and sobs escaped mouths as Sherlock spoke his eulogy. Mrs Watson requested he speak for John.
Sherlock looped his fingers with John's and slowly dragged him down so he was perching on Sherlock's lap with his back tucked closely to Sherlock's chest. They sat with one another in silence for precisely two minutes before Sherlock spoke up.
"What?"
“My mother and I, we were walking Redbeard together.” Sherlock fiddles with a thread of cotton on his coat. “Redbeard was my dog- I couldn’t have been much older than six when we first got him. He was a silly thing, inquisitive and always getting himself into mischief. Anyway, I was walking him and he managed to pull out of his collar and ran into this opening. Thankfully we caught him before he could get any further but ever since that incident we walked him here. He loved it.” Sherlock smiles to himself as he remembers Redbeard, remembers all of the memories they shared together in this location.
In one of the moments that he is awake, he calls me over. I perch on the floor beside where he is laying on the sofa, resting my head on the same cushion that he is resting his on. Our noses are touching slightly and I lean forward, touching a kiss to his cheek, careful not to jolt his oxygen mask.
I need to say goodbye to him and finally I am able to do so. Just the two of us again, as it should be.
The next thirty minutes went by in the blink of an eye (two birds flew by!). “I’ll see you tomorrow. If you’re in pain let someone know. If you want to speak, I’m only phone call away and if the signal doesn’t work I’ll get Mycroft to do whatever it is he does and I’ll come back.” Sherlock leant down a pressed a kiss to John’s lips.
Sherlock stood, holding his hand out to the doctor for another shake. “Yes, thank you. Thank you very much, Dr Holden.”
“He’s a prick.”
I always thought it was ridiculous. Could one person really mean that much to you? I've always been quite sceptical about those sort of things. Perhaps I shouldn't have. I didn't know what was to come.
Mycroft." The elder Holmes knows in an instant what he means and immediately he is grabbing his coat and getting into one of his cars. Sherlock needs him, more than ever.
“It was a slight miscalculation on my part, though I can assure you that I am fine.” Sherlock sunk back into the bed and sighed. He knew what was coming next.
"I'm not sure I understand why-" The girl who was leading the conversation started to get defensive as she pulled her shoulders back, looking me directly in the eyes. I cut her off before she could finish her sentence.
Leaning forward, I pressed a gentle kiss to John's lips, touching mine to his for only a few seconds. Once we had parted, I guided him towards his bed and we laid down together on top of the duvet, his hand in mine.
"To be like what, exactly?" John grimaced in pain again but kept his eyes levelled at his dad. "I'm not-" His voice caught on the words he was trying to say, his emotions getting the better of him. "I'm not doing anything wrong."
is what he wants to say, but the moment John moves his lips is the moment that all of this suddenly becomes
“As ever.”
the two of them can sleep, fingers intertwined in the darkness, knowing that whatever is to come, they’ll still have each other.
We stand on the other side of the ICU doors. I hate the fact that I am away from John but I know why we doing this. "Mr Holmes," She begins. "As I told you yesterday, John has an extremely severe injury and it may be difficult for this information to be passed on to him without the presence of a loved one being there. Either I can tell him or you can tell him but I would personally advise you to be there with him, whether you relay the information or not." I take no time to contemplate the decision.
John can’t quite comprehend what has been said to him, and he’s not quite sure whether he realises that Sherlock has left.
they holler and I zone out. No. That's, no, that cannot be right. I am trying to remain calm but it is not working and suddenly I am hyperventilating, panicking and
I don't know what to say. What the hell am I supposed to say? I've self destructed- the pain of it all is becoming so blindingly real. And it hurts. So. Bloody. Much.
"John?" I manage to mumble out, my speech slurred. I dread the answer.
That morning was the same as any other. The limp was there, the nightmares, the screaming. He looked at his gun again, like he did every other day, before putting it back in the drawer.
John holds me tighter against him, a reassurance. Lifting my arm up, I press my palm against the back of his neck and push his head lower so it is beside my own, but slightly higher. I tilt my head and touch kisses to his jaw, slowly manipulating my body around so I can sit facing him.
Sherlock’s lips were moving again, the words were spilling out and he tasted blood and—

Mrs. Hudson stepped forward. “He’s such a dramatic, that one,” she started,

Or perhaps he was regretting the events of three days before, his momentary lapse into sentiment: the press of his lips against John’s.

John wasn’t sure he had given his lips permission to form the damning word. Then again, Sherlock seemed to make John’s body do all sorts of things he hadn’t given it permission to do. Squaring his shoulders forcefully, he grabbed the carton of milk with his free hand and turned to face the detective.
“You’re not real, John. I know you’re not.”

All of a sudden John was struck by an echo of the words Sherlock had spoken not long ago in this same room- his last words to John before he had disappeared to chase a sinister vision on the rooftop of Bart’s.
John coughed, glancing back over towards Mrs. Hudson, but the woman was

John let the newspaper droop, peering at Sherlock over a headline declaring that half of Andre Street had been leveled in an explosion. Through one silver eye, Sherlock watched the thoughts flicker behind the darker blue of John’s irises. Frustration, confusion, resignation- affection? The emotions spun themselves out across the doctor’s face, so unlike the brittle mask of serenity Sherlock was holding together with 93.6% of his willpower. The remaining percentage was engaged in recalling an expression he had heard once, while lurking under-cover in a coffee shop.

Will Sherlock wake up from the nightmare that had plagued him since Sherrinford?
Luckily the concrete barrier at the edge of the roof jammed into his knees before he went tumbling into space. Some part of his brain attempted to make an ironic comment about this incident, but he threw himself on the brakes of that thought and turned his attention back to the critical question:
“This is real, too.”

John’s voice echoed in his skull, and suddenly he was back on the pavement below.
“Yes, let’s cut to the important part, shall we?”
Mycroft turned back to John, finally, and continued.
He was surprised, actually, that his brain had enough tracks to run this calculation alongside the 27 other locomotives barreling through his skull. They raced along iron rails of logic, each with its own separate engine of deductions spewing forth a whirlwind of steam.

But no- no, there were things in his mind that he couldn’t let John see. Not even this John- he’d just disappear that much sooner.

Sherlock watched in slow motion as John realized the implications of the abrupt quiet. His eyes were no longer unreadable, the specter of fear flickered into life as John looked towards the silent heart monitor. His eyebrows lifted, his lips parted, he was turning towards the solid line flickering across the screen and each movement seemed to take a century. Meanwhile Sherlock could feel all the blood he still possessed racing towards the point on his chest where John’s fingers still brushed against his sternum, drawn inward by an unfathomable gravity.
“Sherlock?”
John paused. He was suddenly unable to force the words past the barriers of his teeth and tongue. Aware of Mycroft’s gaze on his tired face, he squared his shoulders and continued.

Suddenly aware of John’s gaze, still focused intently on his contorted limbs, Sherlock willed his body to still itself. He forced his blood to slow in his veins, his breath to stop leaving his lungs in tiny fluttering gasps.
“No. I’m sorry, John. I made a vow, a vow to protect Mary and—” his voice
“SHERLOCK!”
His lips were still moving as the air rushed past, the water surged up to meet him until all at once it was not water but a pair of dark eyes. A maniacal laughter filled his ears and he reached out for something, anything to stop his fall.
