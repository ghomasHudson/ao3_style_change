Sherlock was already walking away. He waved his hand. "Don't be grateful. It's my job." John felt oddly full. He walked away, but he didn't get any farther then the sunlight peeking into the doorway of the library before he had turned around and was running back in between the book stacks. By the time he found Sherlock again, he was panting. He put his hands on his knees and held up a finger. Sherlock looked at him with absolute puzzlement.
Once inside, John had Sherlock sit on the kitchen counter. He got out a small flashlight, checked Sherlock's pupil response, and cleaned out his wound with rubbing alcohol. He then got out his sewing needle and boiled it in hot water for a bit. Sherlock watched everything silent but curious.
"Sycthia Holmes and Jenneth  Watson. By order of the Clave and Council, due to your transgression against the sacred city of Idris, and your betrayal of the vows you took when you joined the order of the Iron Sister, you are hereby condemned to execution. Do you wish to argue your case?" The woman on the horse stared out from beneath her caped hood, the supposed  righteousness of what she was doing evident in her eyes.
John didn't live on campus. He still lived with his mom and slightly younger sister, Harry. He didn't have the money for a cab, and he lived so close that it was unnecessary to take the tube, so John usually walked. He didn't mind the walk, and usually enjoyed the fresh air and the exercise. The forecast for today called for rain, so John had worn a plastic poncho that was a plaid green, and big knee high yellow rain boots. John tucked his khaki pants into the boots, bundled his red jumper into the poncho and hunched his head. The rain was hard and pelting, so John decided to wait underneath an overhang on a slightly damp wooden bench. He stared out at the green grey haze of the falling rain and inhaled, letting out his breath in a sigh. He closed his eyes and tilted his head back, listening to the hard rat-a-tat-tat of the rain. The mist rising off the pavement kissed his skin, and his hair felt heavy, so he ran his hair through it, coming away with a wet hand, and his hair spiking every which way. John was tempted to open his mouth and taste the air. He was about to, when he was slammed from the side by a dark blur. John's air huffed out from his cheeks, and the hard concrete came up to meet his side in a harsh embrace. A heavy panting pressure lay atop him, and when John shifted to look, the breath he had caught slipped through his lips again.
The queen sat back. "That is of no concern of mine. But, if it is a deal that you desire..." The queen lifted her hand and an ornate dagger appeared, floating in front of the Shadowhunter pair. "All deals must be made in blood."
He knew Mrs.Hudson held some of these answers, but despite all appearances, Mrs.Hudson wasn't a toddy old woman with a gossiping problem. Sherlock knew that his caretaker was one of the most feared and respected warlocks in all of London, perhaps in all the world, and that if something was being kept from him, it was undoubtedly because his ignorance was to play a part in some greater plan.
The stele arched through the air, its glow leaving a streak through the night as Sycthia again brought it down on the children.
Some way down the street, there was a huge monster with tusks and a pink snout. Thick brown hair protruded from the even thicker skin, and the giant beast snuffled about, his small beady eyes watering from the dim light.
"No, Sherlock. I, no. I'm not a spy." John breathed heavily and tried to contain the constriction of his throat.
"Oh! Hello mum." John cleared his throat. "This is Sherlock. He hurt his head a bit and I was just going to sew him up." John laughed nervously.
After the initial shock of seeing her wore off, Sherlock was able to swallow the stinging lump that had formed in his throat to take a closer look.
John found that if he limped, he could take the pain in his leg. Figuring that it was something like a knocked joint or bruised bone, John set off looking for Basker Avenue. He hadn't a clue where he was going, but he had always had a good sense of direction and he usually ended up where he needed to be. He followed the niggling sensation that told him turn right, go left, continue straight ahead. He was moving at a moderate pace, but soon he was finding it hard to catch his breath and the world spun around him. Sliding his backpack off his shoulders and onto the ground, hoping Bluebell was okay in there, John leaned against the glass window of a cafe. He stooped and rolled up his trouser leg.
John thought himself nothing of particular interest. He was begrudgingly short, with dusty hair of an indeterminate blond-brown. His skin was lightly tanned with a soft fresh pink layered over his cheeks from recent sun exposure and his own well-humored disposition. John was in shape, but not obviously so. He enjoyed bundling himself in clothes that even middle aged men dare not touch. John disliked his big ears that turned pink when he was embarrassed, and he disliked his round button of a nose that he thought rather made him look like a hedgehog. The only thing John loved about his face was his eyes, which were a deep deep blue when the sun hit them just right.
"At first I had thought that perhaps it was Mycroft, but then I realized that he wouldn't have hired someone so incompetent, especially to keep an eye on me. So I deduced that it must be a lessor organization that had it in their best interests to keep an eye on my activities. I must applaud your acting skills. Most convincingly friendly. I didn't even suspect anything until you accidentally handed over the book of notes you had been keeping on me. Initially, I was unsure what to make of your little book." Sherlock drummed his fingers on the cover, and John could feel each small fingertip beat a spear of ice into his heart. " But then, you rather gave yourself away with the bit where you saved me. It was so obvious that you had been following me, I was furious with myself for not catching it sooner. I quite enjoyed the time we have spent together, but some new personal  developments mean that I must put a stop to this little game."
Nightmares always hold similar themes, and for John, it was always that something precious and dear to him was being ripped away, leaving him all alone in a dark and dangerous world.
Around their wrists and necks glinted demon wire, and in the irises of their eyes burned a ring of heavenly fire. Jenneth, a stouter woman with long braided back hair of a mousy auburn colour and a smattering of soft freckles across her round face, was the one who had spoken. At her knee clutched a boy of four, who had tufts of blond hair sticking out of his small scalp that were so golden, they could be mistaken for waving stalks of ripened wheat. Her partner, Sycthia,  was a regal woman of considerable height, skin like cream stretched over a crystal bone frame, dark hair cut short to curl like a halo around her pretty face.
Interest undeniably peaked, Sherlock approached the crime scene with an equal mixture of caution and curiosity.
Sherlock stared into the swirling brown of his tea, chewing on the inside of his lip. It has been a puzzle that has plagued him all of his life. Why is he able to see through magical shields of concealment? Where did the scars on his arm and chest come from? Why did they hold similarity to ancient runes? Why was he raised by a warlock?
When he woke up, he found himself handcuffed to the desk, and Sherlock looming over him with a terrifying expression on his face.
John inched closer towards Sherlock, "Listen to me, the next time someone says, or does, something to you, you come and tell me and I will deal with them. Okay?"
“Well Sherlock Holmes, I think you just solved your first case as a Consulting Detective. Shall we go and celebrate?” John beamed, glad to have shared this moment with Sherlock.
As Sherlock exited the room he took one final look at his Biology teacher, who had returned to tidying the class room, and felt a slight flush as he watched John bent down to pick a few discarded pencils up from off the floor.
"Yeah, right." John rolled his eyes at Sherlock and shook his head. Why would anyone fancy him? Okay he wasn't the ugliest person in the world, to some he could even be attractive, but to himself he was just plain. 'The safe option', that was what Mary had reduced him to in one of their numerous arguments. Reliable. Boring. Dull. So it was a mystery to John as to what anyone else could see in John.
In any other context, waking up alone in a city you had only been to twice (this time included) would have been daunting, even for a Holmes. But tomorrow Sherlock would turn 18–  by all accounts that made him a mere 24 hours off of being an adult. And whilst Sherlock viewed age as just a human construct, he was determined to show maturity. Besides, Sherlock wasn’t alone, not really, John was only the other side of the bed and breakfast. Perhaps this was why he wanted to appear grown-up. Despite his dismissal of age as a simple human construct, Sherlock couldn’t ignore the seven-year age gap between himself and John. This in itself didn’t bother Sherlock, he had never really felt like a normal teenage and regarded himself as an ‘old soul’. He felt as if he had more in common with John than with any one else his own age. However, Sherlock was aware of the social implications of age-gap relationships – the insinuation of one party taking advantage of the other. Truth be told, Sherlock couldn’t give a damn about what other people thought, but as he had come to learn, John did. Moreover, it had only taken one nosey colleague for doubts to appear in John’s head. The memory of the time he had felt shunned by John entered into his thoughts. Although, Sherlock was quick to rationalise that of course John would be the warier of the two – he had more to lose as the older one. Not to mention he was Sherlock’s teacher. It almost made Sherlock sad to think that people could view his relationship with John as anything sordid. The more time Sherlock spent with John, the more he found himself genuinely falling for him. He thought back to the kiss they had shared outside the pub and then again just before they said goodnight. A wide smile broke out across Sherlock’s face, he was determined to steal a few more kissed off John before they returned home. Speaking of which, Sherlock didn’t want to waste any more time in bed, he still had a lot of London left to explore. A quick glance at the clock told him he had an hour to get ready till he had to be downstairs for the breakfast John had booked for them.
John had been hoping to use this trip to show Sherlock that he was more than just a science teacher. He knew that it shouldn’t bother him but there was only so many times he could be called dull and boring before it got to him. Especially when it came from his now ex-wife. It didn’t help John’s insecurities that he found Sherlock so bloody brilliant.
"Don't be silly Sherlock, you are far more interesting and much better company than Helen and if I'm being a little honest I think she may have a small crush on me."
Sherlock snorted, "You could say that, yeah." He paused, slotting the test-tube into the rack and turned back to face John. "I'd go to the music room; they let me practice in there."
“Okay, please don’t think I’m over stepping here John,” Helen was trying to be as polite as possible, “but I just wanted to make sure that you weren’t feeling uncomfortable with the attention shown to you by some of the pupils”.
Richard de Somerville stares into John’s eyes for a long moment. John doesn’t move a muscle, his eyes shine bright and focused. Richard’s brow crinkles and his hands clench into fists in his lap. He glances at Sherlock and looks back to John with an almost pleading gaze. “Do you remember the day his body came home? Were you here?”
Sebby laughs. “That is one I will have to read. The rise of the great James Moriarty.” He slings the strap of his satchel over one shoulder and smiles at his friend. “So don’t be boring.”
“You will figure this out. You always do. Just remember these people are frantic with worry. Empathy will get you farther than rudeness.”
He rubs his thumb across the edge of the coin for perhaps the thousandth time before slipping it safely into his satchel with his journal. Moriarty is dangerous, especially where John is concerned; Sherlock knows that. He must ensure John stays safely out of harm's way. But that doesn't stop his pulse from racing with excitement as he makes his way to the west courtyard to summon a carriage. If Moriarty's first pawn on the board is a centuries-old obscure language, what other magnificent enigmas might he have in his arsenal? It is a seductive prospect, just as Moriarty intended it to be, and Sherlock would be lying if he said he could resist it.
“Sherlock?” He hasn’t seen a Muscadet blossom in years. The late harvest apple it produces creates an exquisite cider, and the grafting techniques required to grow it are a highly guarded secret. They only grow in one orchard in the entire kingdom.
He takes a deep breath and focuses on the hallway before him. If anyone suspicious should pass by he is to raise the alarm. At least until his relief shows up in an hour’s time, at which point he will be free to wander the palace.
She puts her glass down on the windowsill before reaching a hand out to him. “Let’s see what I can do about putting you right again.”
John hears the others dismounting behind him and turns to catch Sherlock looking at him fondly. “You were good with him.”
As they ride back towards Baker Street, Sherlock is quiet and distant. He has turned inward, searching for whatever it is that he saw but did not observe. John knows his role in this part of a case well, that of the silent caretaker, and reaches over to lay his hand gently on top of Sherlock’s. Sherlock doesn’t turn his head from the window or shift his gaze from the passing city streets, and he doesn’t speak or make a sound, but he does slide his fingers between John’s and wrap them around each other. It is a solid point of contact, a brightness connecting them to each other even when Sherlock is wandering far away in his own mind.
“Thank you.” She flashes a big smile and Sherlock laughs. “Could I steal John away for a dance? I could very much use a break from – well. All of them.” She motions vaguely towards the rest of the room.
“How long do you plan to go on pretending you're all right?” John looks out the window to the street to avoid Lestrade's worried look. “And don't tell me you're fine. You were all over the place today. If those swords had been sharp you would be dead.”
John lets go of the saddle and turns towards Sherlock. “You wouldn’t be asking me that if I were. I will be all right.” Sherlock just looks at him, love and worry flaring in eyes already bright from the night’s excitement. John puts a hand on Sherlock’s cheek and gives him a small smile. “I will be. I promise.”
Lestrade looks at John for a long moment before a small smile curves the corners of his mouth. “So you can. Here.” He hands the paper to Sherlock, who glances at it before passing it to John. The address is uncomfortably close to Baker Street.
John lies back against Sherlock’s chest and is quickly wrapped again into his arms. He lets the steadiness of Sherlock’s breathing lull his mind and slides his hand up and around Sherlock’s neck, mindlessly running his fingers through dark curls. Sherlock makes a contented murmur in his sleep, and John is moving before he fully realizes what it is that he wants. He turns his body to face Sherlock, straddling his leg and pressing into him. His lips find pale skin just above Sherlock’s collar, and his free hand grabs tightly to a slim hip bone. He clings to Sherlock, desperately kissing his shoulder, his neck, his jaw. Sherlock moans and moves his hands to John’s buttocks to pull him closer. John grinds his hips into Sherlock and grabs his head in both of his hands.When Sherlock’s lips find John’s they are fervent and needy and most definitely awake. Slender fingers slip beneath John’s shirt and slide up his back, taking the cloth with them. John sits up and pulls it over his head quickly, leaning back towards Sherlock as soon as he is free.
John looks out the window of their bedroom, watching clouds move across the moon in the sliver of sky he can see from the bed. Sherlock sleeps soundly next to him and most likely will for several hours yet. John envies him. Being home is remarkably comforting, but he has only been able to sleep for a couple of hours. Inevitably, the healer’s words filter into his dreams to worry him awake. If not her words, it is her eyes glazing over, or firelight shifting the shadows on her wrinkled face, or the way her voice filled his skull as she spoke, powerful and feeble all at once.
John tilts his hips up towards Sherlock’s hand, uncharacteristically impatient. He whimpers and looks up with heavy-lidded eyes.
James watches from an alley as his quarry climbs into a carriage. Thankful he’d taken time to change out of his beggar’s costume, he hails one for himself. He could of course hire someone to do all of this footwork for him, but where is the fun in that? It feels good to actually be an agent on the ground again instead of signing off on orders for other people to do the work. So far today he’d participated in morning guard drills, met a priest of Elua, and even made a bit of coin sitting on his corner. He is learning much about the city and its people, and about Sherlock and John. He knows he needs time to sort through all of the day’s observations, preferably before drills in the morning, but he can’t quell his curiosity quite yet.
Sherlock's words catch John off guard. He glances away and swallows. “I'm well enough. Don't leave me out of this because you think I'm not.”
He feels John’s hand on his shoulder and looks up from his work. John smiles sleepily at him in response, but he looks more rested than he has been in weeks. Sherlock doesn’t know what has been worrying him – John insists there is nothing wrong at all – but he is glad to see that it seems to be getting better. As John reaches to pull out a chair at the table, Sherlock catches a glimpse of a thin pink line running up his forearm, just to the side of the vein. Sherlock knows it follows the vein up to the inside of his elbow where it curls delicately into sensitive skin. Memories of John screaming as he made it two nights ago flash into his mind and make him flush with desire.
Molly is leaning against the back of the couch watching the door when they come in. She is dressed in only a loose silk dressing robe and her hair is up in a high, messy bun. She looks worried.
“I don't know.” That's not a complete lie, at least. He doesn't know which cipher language it uses. Not yet. “But my guess is just a trinket to see how we react. We've nothing to worry about yet.” He forces himself to set the coin and note casually on a side table and lean back in his chair.
The carriage pulls to a stop and the driver hops down to open the door. As James steps out, he glances up at the signboard at laughs. It seems he will be spending his night in Marsilikos at The Lamplighter’s Inn. A fortuitous beginning, perhaps. Either way, tomorrow he rides to the City of Elua to see what type of man Lord Sherlock Shahrizai might be.
His body screams at him to drop to his knees, to lay his hands and head on the dirt between them, to cry out in his grief. He takes a stumbling step forward, clutching at his center to keep himself standing.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. "No, that is my job. I work in the library." Sherlock gestured to the slightly rumpled t-shirt. John noticed for the first time that it had a picture of a happily dancing book on it, the same book that was to be found on all the posters that hung in the library.
John finally snapped out of it when Marianne sat down behind him and began pulling his short blond hair into tiny ponytails.
Pulling on a pair of rubber gloves, Sherlock ran his hands over the little girl. Ignoring the disconcerting feeling of her stiff little limbs, he processed that her hair was damp. The stake that was holding her pinned to the wall, Sherlock realized with some shock, was made of bone. Her skin was also oddly hot, considering that her body held no blood and it hadn't been sitting in the sun.
Lestrade sighed. "The Proctor Lupus doesn't bother with cases like this,we are strictly werewolves and vampires and you know it."
For as long as John could remember he had lived in the Land of Faerie. It is an enchantingly beautiful place, so long as one is welcome there, and though the seasons and layout of the land have a tendency to be inconsistent, John loved this land. He knew that he was a mundane, a human, but plenty of changeling  mundanes lived here, and John figured that he was no different then any other.
Well. Its supposed to be a laughing face, like an animated one, from a cartoon. I do wish you hadn't cut you hair though. I liked you hair. It was pretty.-J.W.
"It worked! Oh, Thank the Angel!" Sycthia scooped up Sherlock and stood, turning to Jenneth to see her face contorted in weeping, the tears evaporating into steam as she came out of her spellcasting state and her eyes settled back from a fiery blaze to a simmer.  Sherlock, however, had immediately broke out in tears, struggling away from his mother, arms reaching towards the other boy. John seemed appalled at having Sherlock ripped away from him and, letting out an angry screech, kicked and pulled at the bottom of Sycthia’s robe.
Sherlock froze as if someone had pressed the pause button, mouth open, hands raised. He blinked, rapid-fire, eyelashes making an audible sound against the cream of his skin. His eyebrows turned up in puzzlement, and the corner of his mouth crinkled. His nose twitched and his hands dropped. His head tilted and he stared sat John. He sipped his tea and stood.
Coming upon her destination, the women pulled a set of keys from the pocket of her pink pencil skirt. She bustled herself and the toddler into the building of flats, and letting  the child go, she watched as he bobbed in midair with a very curious expression on his young face. Sighing, she went to make herself a hot cup of tea.
The door swung open and Mrs.Hudson stood there with an alarmed expression on her face. "Sherlock! What are you doing, beating down my door? It's past three in the morning!!"
" Drop pistolen!" John shouted. Sherlock's eyes locked on him in surprise. The man behind Sherlock charged and John didn't hesitate to shoot.
Beyond the flashing lights of the police cars and the flock of grey-clad detectives, there was what appeared to be graffiti. Upon closer inspection, Sherlock realized that the brick wall of the alley was, in fact, covered in blood.
By the end of this lengthy paragraph, the Shadowhunter's face was quite red because the rules of making a deal with the fey state that it must be said within one breath and must be confirmed in the giving of blood. The fact that fey are known for being tricky business partners, however, explained away the precise language of the offer.
The back of a panting man, dressed in some kind of uniform, was pressed up against the window. Sherlock saw, with some surprise, that this man was covered in an invisibility glamour, and Sherlock carefully arranged his facial features so it looked as if he was simply staring out the window and daydreaming.
His Mum smiled. "I know, dear." She held out a spool of her medical-grade stich thread, the kind that dissolved as the wound healed. John smiled and took it from her.
"What's got you down, John?" The old man behind the counter asked. John shrugged and bit his bottom lip.
Harry came in and flung herself on John's bed. She grabbed a pillow and hugged it, sitting cross legged.
Capturing that personality with graphite took practice. At first it was just quick sketches that would invade the margins of John's notes, his meticulous bullet points being overtaken by twirled curls and the pinched pout of displeasure, morphing into entire days of study lost, with only a hand full of passable sketches that held Sherlock's essence within their lines.
She let him go roughly. "And for god's sake, try not to make it so obvious how much you get off on this sick stuff"
John pushed aside the fabric and entered the room. A blow-up mattress was pushed into the corner, and on it was heaped toy dogs and a bumblebee blanket. A desk was next  to the bed and it was cluttered with chemistry equipment. A music stand was laying on its side and folded piles of clothes and scattered letters made a carpet against the hardwood. A lamp with an orange shade and bright pink stand cast the light in the room.
Sholto was the faerie who had originally stole John away from the human world. He had helped raise John, and trained him to be skilled with a sword and a bow. He also taught John healing magic, which John had had quite a talent for. Sholto was a Seelie Knight, and so had duties to protect those of the Seelie court from those from the unSeelie. From what John could see, this mostly meant that he made lots of deals with unsuspecting humans, and often granted their wishes with an ironic twist.
Gee whiz you guys sorry for the super long hiatus. I was going through a bit of rough real life things, but hey I'm back now! enjoy the new chapter! Sorry that its so short, but I promise the next one will be on its way soon! Thank you for reading!
John swallowed. He could feel the dryness of his throat, of his tongue, feel the heaviness of his teeth as they were weighed down by the words he couldn't say.
"Bullshit, John. You've been acting really weird lately." Harry smiled and tilted her head, her blonde hair falling out of her braid. Her eyes sparkled. "So, tell me. Who's the lucky lady?"
She swallowed and tapped a finger on John's sketchbook. “This boy here...he seems like he needs a friend. Why don't you start there?" With that she took her tea, kissed John's head, and left John to his thoughts. The next day, John was sitting in the back of class, dozing in and out of sleep, thinking about the irrational hurt he had felt when Sherlock hadn't acknowledged him that morning in class, when a small rectangle square had plopped onto his desk. Across the front in beautiful-if jagged-script was written his name. He stared down at it a moment before looking around to see who could have possibly written him a note. Molly Hooper was timidly waving back at him. He frowned in consideration before he reached down and opened it.
Over Sherlock’s heart she again made a mark. The white fire of the steele burned through the clothes the child wore, and as he let out a shriek of fear, the mirror image of it glowed into undeniable existence on John’s thin panting chest. The black rune stayed upon their skin much longer than the first mark, rippling on the surface of the skin like oil on water and though Jenneth did not pause in her chanting, both mothers stared at their children with eyes shining and dancing with anxiety.
The disgusting smell of rotten sulfur seemed to cover everything, but underneath Sherlock could detect a whiff of cologne. There was also the tang of brick-warmed blood, but since that smell was easily explainable, Sherlock dismissed it. He could also smell something sweet and cloying.
John entered the café to the sound of a bell. He walked over and ordered his usual (strawberry sherbet with rainbow sprinkles), threw  some money on the counter, took his order, and slumped in the booth by the window. He scooped up the sprinkles with his spoon and rolled them around on his tongue. He sighed.
With a shrug, Sherlock resolutely ignored this monstrosity. It wasn't the first time that he'd seen a creature from a fairy tale, and he knew it was unlikely to be the last. he was used to seeing things that no one else saw.
Sycthia kneeled next to the children. The younger of the two, Sherlock, whimpered and rubbed at his tired eyes, wobbly legs forcing him to lean into John, who gripped him tight about the waist, and watched as his mother rolled up the sleeves of each of their pajamas.
"Run!" Sherlock tugged on John's hand and then they were running, running through the rain, feet splashing, and shattering reflections over their shoes. Sherlock was a blur through the downpour and the cold, and John was smiling so hard his cheeks hurt, the humid air burning his lungs. Sherlock led him up and around, leading him through a labyrinth of streets and shadows. John's whole being felt alive, and when Sherlock turned into a small alcove, pulling John in beside him, John met Sherlock's eyes and Sherlock's irises were dancing, blue green oxygen flames. Breath came heavy and harsh, naked chests straining against cloying fabric, and John's laughter came, unbidden, high pitched and raspy. His giggles sounded down right girly and when Sherlock joined in with his chuckle, deep and creamy as chocolate mocha, John's knees went weak. A crack of lighting overhead made John's hair stand on end.
"So, it's true what everyone says then? That you can tell everything about a person with just a glance?" John's heart was pounding in his chest. He didn't want Sherlock to know how badly he wanted that sharp gaze piercing him, digging out his truth. He was also terrified as to what secrets he could be giving away. He tried to put on a neutral mask as Sherlock's eyes dragged slowly up his body.
The rabbit raised itself onto its fore-legs, and hopped away. The wind blew, the reflection on the pond rippled and all was silence.
"Of course not, your highness. All Shadowhunters know of the fey's inability to lie. We simply ask that you take care of the situation. More then one mundane has seen the loose troll, who is not bothering to use a glamour to hide himself. We simply do not have the resources to spare in london to track him down and prosecute him, what with the war in Alicante and the surge of demons in the north. He's killed and eaten a whole party of mundanes."
It was a blustery dawn, the sky still clasping to its navy shades although the night had already given up its clasp on the world. The tall metal buildings gathered the meager light of the awakening sun and turned it into sharp, earthbound stars on steel. Most of the living in the city were still wrapped in warm beds, drowsy dreams hanging over them. Those who walked the streets rubbed the tiredness from their eyes and left steamy streamers of coffee behind.
“I really wanted to see the Old Bailey court, it’s a three-minute walk away but...” Sherlock answered, pausing to check something on his phone. “But yeah, it closed about an hour ago.”
Fuck it. John decided that he was going to be the bigger person and make real amends. “Sherlock, if you don’t mind. I’d like a quick word”.
Once he reached the breakfast area, John became worried as he discovered that Sherlock was not there. Had he been stupid to leave Sherlock alone. John thought he was doing the right thing by booking separate rooms, but what if something had happened to Sherlock? He cursed himself for forgetting that technically he was still Sherlock’s guardian in this situation. However, John’s worry quickly dissipated at the sight of Sherlock hurrying over to him.
“Well after being cooped up in this small town my whole life, it was like a breath of fresh air. Although maybe not a literal one – it will be very interesting to study the effects of pollution levels on the minds of criminals.” Sherlock noted.
“Well that was all really John, but if it does get... out of hand, shall we say, you know where to find me.” Helen gave John a forced smiled and exited the classroom.
“Why wouldn’t I want a brilliant doctor by my side to help with my cases?” Sherlock chimed, later concluding that his giddiness from being in the city was what gave him the confidence to flirt with John so forthright.
“We could always go back to Bart’s. I know you’ve already been but they have a museum inside that we didn’t get to see last time. If you fancy, it?”
John cocked his eyebrow, was that Sherlock's way of flirting with him? No, he must have misjudged the younger's tone. That didn't stop John, who was currently feeling more eighteen than twenty-five, from blushing and scratching at the stubble on his face.
Sherlock rolled his eyes and snatched the signed paper. "It's a science trip. To London. What part of doesn't sound like something I'd want to do?"
“Oh I think they might overlook it; given that they probably be more concerned with you whisking me away in the first place.” Sherlock decided to leave it there, not wanting to push John into doubting their trip. He was thankful that their food arrived before John had time to think too much about what he had said.
“Sorry about that. I just needed to explain that it couldn’t have possibly been the defendant. I mean did you see his fingernails?” Sherlock said, as if John ought to know why that proved the defendant’s innocent.
Mycroft paused briefly as he tried to remember the other boys in his brother’s year. “Not John Dun by any chance? His brother Tyler was in my Law class.”
Sherlock sat in his last biology class of that term, technically he had biology classes on a Friday too, but on the last day of term his school allowed their students to take the day off. This meant that this fifth period biology class would be the last opportunity he had to see John before they broke for the holidays. Sherlock was aware that he was exhibiting the same behaviour that John had when they had met after the London trip, but Sherlock just couldn’t bring himself to look him in the eye. It hadn’t really shocked him that he was so hurt by John’s earlier signs of withdrawal from him, Sherlock guessed that maybe he had been too full on in London and that John was starting to regret befriending him. Consequently, Sherlock was feeling more than a little upset and frankly, a bit pissed off. He vowed that in order of saving John the trouble of making some half-hearted attempt to excuse himself from meeting him, which would just embarrass the both of them, Sherlock would just exit the class without saying another word. Which is exactly what he did and when the class finished he forced himself not to look at John – he feared if he did his resolve would break and he would find himself drawn to John once again.
"Sherlock Holmes?" The sound of Mr. Watson's voice drifted back into the front of Sherlock's mind. "Yes, Sir."
"What happened? Your self-pity suggests that we're probably talking your average drunken night out? Possibly a one-night stand?" Sherlock inquired, somewhat hesitantly – he didn't know if he truly wanted to hear about a possible one-night stand John might have had.
“Hello to you too Mycroft, how are you? Lovely day.” Sherlock retorted sarcastically as he climbed to the passage side of Mycroft’s Mercedes.
John reached Sherlock and passed over a form, resting a hand on his shoulder he bent down and whispered, "You can kick start your Consulting Detective business". John continued on to the rest of the students and watched out of the corner of his eye as Sherlock grinned at him.
“Wow, that was fascinat -…” Sherlock trailed off as he saw the accused’s defence lawyer entering the near-by male toilets. “Actually, will you excuse me a second.” He added and shot off behind the lawyer.
John smiles softly and placed his hand on Sherlock's arm. "Well then, it's a good thing you have me. Anyway, you should be heading back to lessons; the bell should be going soon."
John found that last one a little too hard to believe that Sherlock has deduced that just by looking at the elderly lady. He said this to Sherlock and was quite amused when he admitted that he had actually overheard the lady on the phone, thanking her grandson, whilst John had been in the toilet. The rest of the journey followed in a similar manner with the Sherlock explaining to John some of the more complicated deductions. John brought them a drink each and was pleased when Sherlock accepted half of his sandwich. They discussed their plans for the day ahead. Sherlock was keen to see the real side of London and not just the tourist attractions – he did hate overcrowded places. John suggested visiting one of the smaller, more specialised museums like the Anaesthesia Heritage Centre or the Kirkaldy Testing Museum. Sherlock didn’t seem too enthusiastic, which led John to his only remaining suggestion.
John smiled as he watched Sherlock take in his surrounding, he had never seen anyone look so taken with busy streets and a few old buildings, it was quite frankly cute as hell, and these days nothing rarely struck him as ‘cute’. “Yep. This is where I trained, I was practically your age when I first started.”
“I’m sorry to hear that, I did always like Mary, but anyway plenty more fish in the sea – speaking of which, anyone new?” Harry asked with a mixture of teasing and genuine curiosity”.
“Here, I got you something Sherlock. I know you needed new one.” Mycroft said, handing Sherlock a small parcel.
Sherlock took his chance to pull out the postcard and pen his thank you letter to John. He was fortunate that he made sure to always have a pen on his person.
“John, I’m just going to run to the toilet, be right back.” Sherlock lied. In actual fact, he was heading for the gift shop, determined to find John a suitable thank-you present. This proved to be quite the task given that Sherlock only had a £20 note and about 5 minutes before John got suspicious. Sherlock settled on an intricate keyring in the shape of the royal crown and a postcard depicting a map of central London. Sherlock was able to pay the cashier promptly and stashed the keyring and postcard in his coat pocket. He would have to write his note to John on the train, he had already been gone well past the five minutes.
John laughed at Sherlock's expression. "Sherlock please, don't look so worried, you're welcome to call me John when we're out of class. That's what friends do right?"
Sherlock groaned, he had thought that Mr. Watson was going to be an alright teacher, he really wasn't in the mood to be told off.
The contents of Sherlock's satchel included his nearly full, but not just yet, A5 notepad –to record his favourite deductions; his 5x 30mm magnifier – a recent birthday present from Mycroft; a print-out titled 'How Not To Get Lost In London' – his mother had insisted; the second packed lunch he's ever bothered to make himself; his iPod; £20 and a packet of spearmint gum. It would be the first school trip Sherlock had ever been on, not to mention the teen's first time in London, and he wanted to be prepared – despite his brother's insistence that 'the most fun you'll get up to on a BSC trip is getting lost and winding up on the other side of London'. Screw him, Sherlock had come to the conclusion that he could be forced to listen the drivel Sally Donavan spouts on a daily basis, and as long as he was with John he knew he'd find a way to make it enjoyable. But he wasn't going to be listening to Sally Donavan all day; he was going to be at the Science Museum, and he was certain he would enjoy it, with or without John.
"Not quite" John started, "My ex-girlfriend Mary, the one you deducted, showed up at my apartment last night and we ended up arguing quite a bit. Well, arguing is a bit of an understatement, we ended up smashing up my apartment and then I threw her out."
“So Sherlock, we’ve spoke a lot about your future plans, but you’ve mentioned very little of your past. I can’t help but presume that the incident with Charlie Magnussen, back on the day we met, may not have been a one-off?”
“Brilliant, now bugger off, we all have homes to get to” John teased and pretended to shoo his friend away.
Back in the Holmes household dinner was an amusing affair, at least it was for Sherlock and Mycroft. In actual fact, Violet and her sister had started arguing after only an hour and a half of being in each other’s company. Their back-and-forth insults were a welcomed highlight to what was usually a tedious day for the Holmes brothers. Whilst this had improved Sherlock’s mood a little, it hadn’t been enough to fully distract him from missing John. He had made a promise to himself that for his mother’s sake he would remain present until his aunt and uncle had left. Sadly, they had hung around for a little longer than Sherlock, or anyone else really, would have liked. By the time they had actually left the Holmes’, Sherlock had grown quite tired and was thankful of being able to excuse himself to bed. As his mother said goodbye to their guests and waved them off at the front door, Sherlock too his opportunity to slip away upstairs. He was just too tired for the ‘goodnight’ formalities. However, his restlessness (a result of missing John) had surpassed his tiredness and he was unable to drop off. After fruitless attempts to fall asleep Sherlock gave up and turned his bedside lamp on, if he couldn’t sleep then he might as well read. He picked up the nearest book, The Buzz and Bees: Biology of a Superorganism, and started to read. Sherlock had only made it through one chapter before his mother knocked on his door, he was always able to tell his mother’s knock – soft and polite.
John took note of it all, filling a small hand held sketch book with image after image of Sherlock. Knowing Sherlock was nothing without his words, John had even scribbled in some of his most favorite phrases he had ever heard formed by Sherlock's perfect quip of a mouth. John's only regret was that he was unable to capture Sherlock's voice in his drawings.
"Wait, what just happened?" John said aloud to no one in particular."I'm sorry..did....did she just..?" John retracted his pointing finger once he realized that no one was paying him any mind. Scratching at his blond hair, John left the courts and went about the rest of the day with a furrowed brow and a preoccupied mind.
Pretty soon, John began to take note of not just Sherlock (who by now had made a name for himself for being the biggest prick on campus) but of the people he surrounded himself with. There was a sweet girl john had rarely ever seen talk to anyone without stuttering (Molly was her name, John thought) who followed Sherlock around like he was a god. Sherlock and her seemed to get on well but seeing her stare at Sherlock always made John uncomfortable. It made him anxious, but the reason why was something he didn't know. John drew her into the book anyway, with a small smile that lifted her cheeks and her hair pulled to the side, an overlarge scarf wrapped around her neck.
John faltered for a moment, checking that his glamour was still up. It was and, reassured that the man couldn't see him, John took a moment to observe his features. It was an odd face, not immediately recognizable as beautiful, but after a moment it dawned upon the viewer that it held within its confines otherworldly allure .  He had high cheek bones and a delicate, hairless jaw. His bottom lip was full and plump, and the top lip was a strange pairing for the bottom because it was small and seemed to strain under the arc of a cupids bow. Both lips were pale, except for the parts of his lip that were closest to the opening of his mouth, where the softest and sweetest hue of pink was held. John tore his eyes away from staring at the man's lips, feeling awkward. The man's nose was an upturned snub with an adorable little dimple in it. John laughed at himself for thinking such a thing about a stranger, but even as he turned away he couldn't shake the feeling of familiarity he felt for the man. Rubbing at his scars, which had suddenly started to burn, John continued on his way.
It was obvious from looking at the girl that the blood used to write on the wall around her was her own. She was shockingly pale, her small face frozen in a look of rage. She wore a pajama set covered in small unicorns, and her hair was pulled up in ponytails.
Sergeant Donovan marched up to Sherlock with a disturbed look on her pretty face. She grabbed onto the front of his jacket and pulled him down close.
The odd thing is that despite the impact that Sherlock made on John, the world around John just absorbed him into it. John still went to rugby practice. He still had late dinners and worried over his future. Life went on, but somehow now it was different, as if John had been living a monochromatic existence until ink curls and ice eyes stained his universe in mystery and smirks, firing neurons and gun smoke.
"Promise I'll think about that, mate."  John said, and turned back to the window. The café owner went in the back, and John heard the grinding of machines and the splash of dishwater. John turned back to the window to watch the wind as it shook the leaves from the trees. Their patterns of yellow and red, tumbling through the air, made a patchwork quilt that showcased John's favorite season. He sighed again and idly ate some more sherbet. Then a familiar shape caught his eye and he sat up, his sherbet momentarily forgotten.
"What are you laughing about?" John's mum came in the door with a weary smile. John startled, almost dropping his sketch book.
"I will accept the lack of prosecution, but I need more. I will take your dog, Simon." The queen smiled at the silent Shadowhunter.
"The Angel, John! Are you alright? That was quite a fall, although I'm sure you saved Billy's life." Sarah flew over to John and hovered over Billy, checking his head for wounds.
John came home later than usual last night, and a little drunk. Sherlock must remember to thank Lestrade for that. Alcohol doesn't solve anyone's problems, of course, but it made John less guarded. More himself than he has been. Sherlock can often be remarkably single-minded when working, but this was an opportunity not to be wasted. John smiled at him, and he led John to their bed weaving prayers to Naamah into every touch.
Sherlock watches the green fields of Azzale move by through the carriage window. Now that he is back in Terre D’Ange, far from the case and the strange shores of Alba, his body is demanding payment for days of neglect. His eyes drift close and his mind wanders from one thing to another, still trying to process information. White seaside cliffs and John’s face in the moonlight. Otherworldly howls in the night. Dark woods, magic, fearful wonder.  An entire world of new things to study.
“Hello, Richard. I’m sorry for waking you.We need to discuss something that can’t wait till morning. Can we sit?”
So... here's a chapter. It's neither beta'd or kushiel-picked, and honestly it could probably be better but I've wrangled with it for long enough. I'll try to not let the next one take two years. :) If anyone is still reading I would love to know what you think!
“I am.” It does his resolve some good to say that and honestly mean it again. He is calm, vigilant, and ready for this fight. “You?”
“Of course. Thank you.” Sherlock glances at John with a crinkled brow and anxious eyes. John takes his hand and they follow Édouard down the hallway.
Sherlock thinks for a moment, taking in every detail of the defeated man seated before him. He thinks of the five younger children who have already lost a brother. “I think your family has suffered enough, but it will be a swift thing to incriminate both of you if it has not.”
Sherlock scoffed, “No. Quite tediously, I was a favourite of his to tease – although it never was anything more than the odd shove or unintelligent insult”.
English had always been a subject Sherlock enjoyed, and even though he’d already read King Lear at least three times, and had written a number of academic articles on Shakespeare, he still threw himself into the lesson wholeheartedly in an attempt to keep himself busy until his next lesson – biology.
“Twenty-five and shut up, we’re here now” John teased and in an effort to distract from the current topic of conversation, dragged Sherlock by the hand threw the foyer of St. Bartholomew’s Hospital.
The waitress scribbled on a small notepad and turned to John. “And for you hun? Will it be the same as your boyfriend?”
Sherlock quickly placed the postcard back inside his coat pocket as he saw John retuning down the aisle. John began to tell him some funny story about an argument that broke out between this couple up ahead. The pair carried on in comfortable silence for the rest of the journey. It was as they pulled into their penultimate stop that Sherlock handed over the postcard and keyring.
“Right, where would you like to go first?” John asked an honestly ecstatic Sherlock “I can show you the science labs or the tech rooms. I can even show you the morgue if you’re up for that.”
“Yes, emergencies.” John retorted. “I can’t imagine your parents would be best pleased if I lost you in London.”
"Ah, most likely I'll still be here in Baker Street; nowhere else to go for me. No exciting adventure." John looked a little forlorn.
"What do you want Magnussen?” he sighed, “were the holidays so dull that you just couldn't wait to see me again?"
Sherlock rolled his eyes, he had picked up on John’s behaviour relaxing a little and this eased his own apprehension. “Boring. As usual and quite obvious when compared to the day I had on Friday.”
Neither of them wanted to break contact, but it became almost impossible to maintain when the time came to pay entry to the Tower of London. Sherlock bit his lip as John paid for them both. He couldn’t help but feel a bit guilty, this trip must have cost John a fortune. Sherlock vowed to find a way to repay him. They had decided to get the 4:00pm train home, so that Sherlock could catch a lift of Mycroft on his way home from work. This gave them around an hour before they had to set off for the train station. John suggested that they go and view the Crown Jewels and Sherlock was more than happy to agree. Sherlock wasn’t particularly interested in the royal family, but he loved the history the surrounded the jewels. After walking around the exhibit they decided to go and find the Tower’s café, so that they could grab a quick lunch before the journey home. Sherlock tried to protest as John bought them drinks and sandwiches, but John ignored him.
Sherlock was desperate to hide how upset he was from John, he didn’t want him to think he was being ungrateful. They had had a great day together but coming to London was such a rarity, he did know when he’d be able to come again. As it turns out, Sherlock was awful at hiding his emotions and it was clear to John just how much he wanted to see more of the city.
The previous night has set the record for the third consecutive night Sherlock had missed dinner. He was certain his mother thought he had an eating disorder, but it wasn't that Sherlock deliberately skipped the meal – he just ended getting so wrapped up in his research (or whatever experiments he could manage to conduct in his tiny room) that he forgot stop for food. He knew that it was hurting his mother though, so he decided to just listen to some music on his iPod until it was time for dinner. Sherlock threw himself onto his bed, plug his earbuds into his iPod and closed his eyes.
"Of course we can, I could do with some fresh air anyway." John stood up and threw his coffee cup in the bin; surely there was nothing wrong with showing Sherlock around some parts of London? After all, it would be a lot better than Sherlock choosing to leave by himself and getting lost in the process.
Mr. Watson exhaled deeply, "Sorry for the overshare, ignore me." He forced a smile and started again, "It's getting late, and you really should be heading home soon. Before you do though, how about if you teach me a bit of how you do that deduction trick, say lunchtime tomorrow, then maybe I won't report what you said about your previous teacher. Deal?"
"Oh er, thank you, I-" Sherlock started, only to be interrupted by Mr. Watson, "You did get one thing wrong though, well not wrong entirely. I was in a long term relationship. Only, 'was' being the operative word. We broke up, me and Mary, about 2 weeks ago. And yes, we were together for seven years. I'm rambling now and I don't really know why I am telling you all of this".
"Holmes!" Dimmock shouted. The young teacher did not dislike Sherlock per say, he definitely admired the boy’s flare for his subject, but rather he did not always have the patience for him.
"Given the lack of illuminations and ventilations, I would say the hermit of the castle perhaps, or maybe a troll or two" i aid.
"Let's go Saxon, it's not the right night to get away, come I'll take care of your lodgings" he finally exhorted me with a calm smile, and I only managed to follow him in silence, just worried just by the fact that in all probability I would not be never managed to get back to Frank.
"N-no, of course not. I was with my mind elsewhere, "I tried not to sound too surprised at the visit. Victor handed me the bottle of port.
"Can I ask how many glasses did you drink?" Asked Holmes curiously, who obviously had noticed my state of non-sobriety.
"Oh ... well! In this case, come with me, find something to eat and clean clothes, "said the old woman a little reluctantly.
When I was dressed and washed, I went to my clinic. By now it had become my routine. I was good at the task I had been given. The healer before me possessed herbs and powders, which could be very useful for me in the future. I also studied some of his notes on some plants that I did not even know existed.
"Very well then", he made his usual presumptuous smile while pointing to a sheltered place where I could change the bandages.
"Well... here too I like the beautiful stories of ghosts that's all," the reverend turned red with embarrassment.
It was decided in their last class together before the trip that they would meet at the train station so that it would look like a coincidence that the teacher and student happened to be travelling together. Sherlock had thought carefully about which family member to ask for a lift to the station that Saturday morning. He went for Mycroft, in favour of him being less likely to ask probing question than their mother. To Sherlock’s delight their conversation was minimal.
John’s smiled widened to a grin, he loved the way Sherlock’s mind performed, like he was always working. As they sometime did, John let Sherlock set up a small experiment whilst he continued to mark the results of the last biology test he gave to his year eleven class. Thankfully it was a comfortable silence that the pair fell into, they just always seemed to click, no matter what each other were doing.
As he'd planned, Sherlock visited the three exhibitions he wanted to (Computing, Medical History and Psychology) before wandering round to see what first took his fancy.
Sherlock found the idea of John worrying cute, but could also tell it was a bit more serious for him. “Look, I understand that this… I don’t know what to call it... that us has greater implications for you if people found out. I respect whatever precautions you want to take. But please, John, stop feeling guilty as if I haven’t wanted to kiss you from the moment you pulled Magnussen off me.”
“Go on love, I think he wants to treat you. I wish I had a handsome man taking me out on a date.” She winked as she took John’s card, not noticing the blush on both of their faces.
Sherlock quickly glanced over John, “I know. Your fingers are slightly shorter in proportion to your palms, consistent with playing a musical instrument that places pressure on your fingertips at a young age."
Sherlock turned to look forlornly out the window, grateful that it was only a few minutes left of the journey. It just didn’t real right to be leaving John. He understood why they had to be careful, but it didn’t make his departure any less upsetting. Perhaps it was the suddenness of it all. Sherlock closed his eyes and replayed the memory of the last two days over in his head.
“Sherlock you can call it part of the birthday treat.” John justified, adding with a smile “and if it really bothers you my birthday is the 7th July”.
Instead of a cocky, arguably borderline flirty remark from John, the latter seem to consider the proposal seriously. This, in turn, led Sherlock down the same train of thought. Surely there was no way it could work; this schoolboy crush on John was one thing – but the possibility of reciprocated feelings? No. There wasn't a chance. However, before the pair could voice their thoughts, the bell signaling the end of lunch rung out.
They ate in a comfortable silence, broken occasionally with easy small talk. Once they had finished they thanked the waitress and promptly departed the bed and breakfast. They were both eager to get back to exploring London. As promised, John took Sherlock to the Old Bailey. John found it very adorable to watch Sherlock become increasingly excited the closer that they got. It wasn’t overtly obvious, but John could tell how Sherlock’s speech sped-up as he was telling John the history of the courthouse. To Sherlock’s absolute delight, when they arrived at the Old Bailey they learnt that they could sit in the public and watch an actual trial. John could almost feel the ecstatic energy that Sherlock radiated as they slid into in one of the public viewing galleries. The case followed the fatal stabbing of a young woman at party. It seemed pretty straightforward. Especially as the accused was found with the murder weapon in his hands. However, when the prosecutor displayed an image of said murder weapon something clicked in Sherlock’s mind.
"Okay, so you're in a long term relationship – I'd say roughly seven or eight years, you met at university – but not married. You used to own a black cat, although not your choice, you wanted a dog. You're a younger brother, but you don't get along with your older broth- no, not brother, sister. You wanted to be an army doctor but, presumably, the injury you sustained on you right leg put you out of action. Probably why you became a teacher, you didn't want to waste the training." Sherlock let out a long breath. "Was I close?"
John tried not to consider the possibility of being accosted by Sherlock’s older brother. “Hmm. I think from now on maybe we should be careful. I mean if that is what you want. I’m not trying to pressure you into anything.”
John relished in the adoration Sherlock wore on his face. It was such a beautiful look on the younger man, and a rare one at that – so often John saw boredom or disdain cross Sherlock’s face that seeing him in adulation was delightful. “I must admit; I am quiet jealous Sherlock. Life in London can be overwhelming but I’m sure it’s going to be as exciting as you imagine. You’ll have to send me regular updates of your adventures.”
John frowned slightly, “I am sorry to hear that Sherlock, I can sympathize somewhat, I didn’t exactly have the easiest schooling experience either. In my first year of college I had this on-off relationship with a classmate, but they weren’t ready to be open and when the relationship came out… well he turned nasty”.
“I’m not bisexual, at least I don’t think I am. Emotions can sometimes be beyond me, not usually my own – but it can happen. I do think, however, that I am gay”. Sherlock paused, he’d never actually said those words out loud. Mycroft knew, but then Mycroft knew everything. However, Sherlock did not regret confiding in John, if anything he felt as if their recent display of honesty with each other had brought them closer together.
John kissed Sherlock properly this time and stood up to move over to the next carriage alone. “I promise we will see each other again soon, and not in class. I mean properly. We’ll think of something.”
“I got you something too, just to say thank you for always having my back.” Sherlock cut his brother off before he tried to make an attempt to explain his new found kindness.
John took a moment to read over Sherlock’s words. “Thank you Sherlock, but honestly it was my pleasure.”
“And this is where you actually trained right?” Sherlock replied, still in awe of his surroundings. He knew that no one could truly fall in love with a city but he had a hard job telling his brain that.
Sherlock was caught up in the moment, his anxieties falling away. That was until John stopped smiling and stood still. Sherlock panicked, he had let himself get carried away. He dropped his head, not wanting to look John in the eye and waited for a rebuffal that never came. Instead John lifted Sherlock’s head up with a gentle push of his hand. John closed the gap between them by softly pulling Sherlock towards him. And then they kissed. Neither knowing who moved first as they both rushed to meet the other lips. It wasn’t until a group of teenagers walked by wolf-whistling that they realised they were making out in broad daylight in the busy streets of London. As they broke apart Sherlock bit his lip to stop himself grinning like an idiot. John straightened his coat, ignoring the teenager that were still jeering and held his hand out for Sherlock to take.
By the time Sherlock arrived at the Biology lab there was only a handful of seats left, despite the smaller class sizes in sixth form, biology was a popular subject. Sherlock believed that this was down to the teachers of the class, Mr. Dior and Mr. Johnson, who both took a very laid-back approach to teaching – an attractive aspect to the more care free students at BSC.  Sherlock decided to take a seat next to one of the only friendly faces in the class, belonging to a small, sweet girl by the name of Molly Hooper.
"Good. Okay. So, I'm John Watson, but to you lot it is Mr. Watson. I’ll introduce myself properly in a second but let's get registration out of the way…"
Violet sighed and leaned over to straighten Sherlock's tie, "Okay Sherlock, I'll let you run off to your room, I know you're dying to get away. But Sherlock, maybe you could actually show up for dinner tonight? For me?"
I’ve been an arse, a complete arse. I let other people’s judgments influence my behaviour and for that I’m sorry. I hope I can have the opportunity to apologise to you properly. Merry        Christmas,
Sherlock gave no vocal reply, and instead just nodded. He waited for the class to vacate the classroom, consciously ignoring Magnussen’s taunt, “You’re in trouble Holmes”, before walking over to John. He noted the similarities between his nervousness at present and the nervousness he felt the first day John had called him back. “I… er, I got your card… Thanks?”
Sherlock awoke to the sound of The Neighbourhood and pulled out his earbuds, he checked the time: crap, it was quarter past ten; he hadn't realized how tired he must have been. Sherlock stood up, stretched and opened his door to see if anyone was awake. The house was pitch black – save the soft glow from Mycroft's room but that was to be expected, it was rare his older brother went sleep before one am. As Sherlock took a step forward his foot nudged the edge of a silver tray. His mother had left out a little note that read, ‘I’ve kept a plate of diner for you in the microwave, Love Mum x’, Sherlock felt a pang of guilt. He tiptoed into his parent's bedroom and kissed his mother's cheek, whispering "night mum" as he left to go brush his teeth and crawl back into bed.
Magnussen grabbed Sherlock by his collar, "You think you're everything Sherlock, just because big brother Mycroft is always behind you backing you up. Well you're not. You're just a jumped up little shit who-".
John looked like a child about to find out how a magician accomplished his trick. "Come on then, spill. You said you'd teach me a bit about how you deduct."
John arrived at the station with two minutes to spare, not that it mattered – even if you promise a bunch of teenagers a day out of classes, to go to London no less, there will always be one that rolls in at the last second, nearly making the whole class miss their train. But not to worry, they had all made it onto the carriage in one piece. John left the students to pair up with each other and find their seats before he took his own, ensuring it was as far back as he could go that without abandoning his students completely. John thanked fuck for the two substitute teacher that had agreed to accompany him and help manage the students. Without them, John was sure he would probably have lost at least two students by now.
As the pair left the café, Sherlock couldn't decide what he was more excited for, actually getting to explore a part of London or spending some time alone with John out of their usual school environment. Oh who was he kidding; of course it was the latter.
Sherlock bit his lip, feeling a little foolish for being so mad at John. Of course their relationship must look odd to the outsider and the risk of such implications would be worse for his teacher. As smart as he believed himself to be, he had a habit of missing the obvious.
“Honestly mother you worry too much,” he chided, before adding, “but thank you for today, I know how much time and energy you put into making today happen. Dinner was lovely”.
"Uh, uh" Violet teased lightly. "Firstly, Sherlock Holmes, you can tell me which brilliant soul has actually managed to get my elusive son to participate in a school run event."
John realised that taking Sherlock to his old medical school, St. Bartholomew’s Hospital, was not so much about fuelling Sherlock’s appetite for science, but more about impressing him. When he had suggested taking Sherlock around London for a quick whistle-stop tour, making the most of the last few hours they had in the city, St. Bart’s was the first place that crossed his mind. John wanted to show Sherlock the more interesting side of him, beyond being a biology teacher in a local town. John had been a doctor, an army doctor at that, he had seen more than his fair share of bloodshed and trouble and if he was honest with himself he bloody missed it. So why he felt the need to prove to Sherlock that he could be just as interesting and impressive as the latter could be was nearly beyond him. Nearly, but not quiet. As much as he would have protested if you asked him at this moment, John Watson was falling for Sherlock Holmes. He was brilliant and a genius and he reminded John of what it felt like to be alive, before he was shot and sent away from the front line. John knew that he was towing a thin line with his relationship with Sherlock and he knew he should feel guilty or wrong. But he didn’t. In two months’ time Sherlock would turn eighteen (John had shamelessly looked up the younger’s birthday on the registration system), that made him seven years younger than himself which should’ve turned John away, but Sherlock was like no other eighteen-year-old he had met before. Furthermore, in just around six months’ time, Sherlock would no longer be John’s pupil and their relationship would be free to blossom into whatever it may. John snapped himself out of his trail of thoughts, six months was a long time ago and better still, for the time being Sherlock was his pupil and John had promised himself that he would not take advantage of his friendship with Sherlock. How did he know that there was even a small possibility that Sherlock would ever reciprocate feelings for him? John really did need to get a grip, he reminded himself that he was the older one out of the two and pulled himself together, god forbid he get them lost in London and risk missing their train home.
John was left to reflect on the conversation he had just had. He knew that Helen was not threatening him or coming from an accusatory position, if anything she seemed to think that Sherlock was the one showing feelings for him – not the other way around. Even so, Helen may not have been warning him, but that did not mean that John should not take this as a warning sign. Sherlock still had five months of classes left at Baker Street Comprehensive and John did not want to put either of them in any awkward situations. But at the same time John did not want to have to pull away, if he had to cut ties with Sherlock, even for a short while, it would really trouble him. John hoped that the Christmas holidays would give them a little breathing space and that when they came back they could return to just acting as friends. John could no longer kid himself that he was attracted to Sherlock, and even more he had some gut feeling that Sherlock must be at least a little attracted to John – his behaviour earlier that day indicated that he wanted to spend more time alone with John. That was why John took it upon himself to promise that he would ensure that they both did not cross a line that might ruin what they could have.
"Oh and Sherlock," John added as Sherlock gripped the handle of the door. "Feel free to come by any lunch time."
After finishing up with the register, the young teacher spoke to the class "Right, well formalities over and done with, maybe I should tell you a bit about myself." He took a moment to survey the room, glad to see they weren't drifting into boredom, but rather listening to him quite intently.
If it wasn't the way that she kept twirling her hair and looking at John, what annoyed Sherlock the most was the way that she put on a false and frankly patronizing tone to talk to him.
"I'll be there to help out the police with unsolved cases, see to private clients who need my deduction skills, that sort of thing." Sherlock answered proudly.
"I think Sherlock is alright here Helen, if he wants to sit here I have no problem with it." John gave Sherlock a reassuring smile and turned back to his colleague, who finally got the hint and left the pair alone, somewhat annoyed.
As for Sherlock himself, he was trying his best to convince himself that his feelings for John were purely platonic, or at least were no more than a school boy crush. It wouldn’t do to start falling for his first and only close friend. He was only just adjusting to having a friend in his life and he didn’t want to risk scaring John away. Sherlock tried to ration that maybe he was just confusing affection for attraction. Emotions had always thrown Sherlock a little out of his comfort zone and he had decided long ago that they were best observed at arm’s length. He kept himself busy by focusing on what he wanted to see most in London and set about creating a very detailed itinerary.
After she let there was a brief pause, both worried what the other was going to say. Sherlock was the first to laugh, but it was more of a giggle really. This was quickly picked up by John and the pair laughed in unison as the exited the pub.
Sherlock quickly changed the conversation onto how terribly they both thought the family Christmas dinner might go. It wasn’t a secret that Violet Holmes and her sister had more than a little sibling rivalry, it clearly ran in the family, and when together for longer than a few hours, the two sisters usually ended up bickering about something or other. Sherlock suggested that that they might last three hours before an argument broke out, Mycroft argued two and a half. As conversation eased away from the subject of Sherlock’s mopey attitude, he lightened up a little and even found himself enjoying his time with Mycroft. The brothers took their time finishing their coffees before heading back to Mycroft’s car, both because they actually were having fun and as a way of prolonging having to go home to a list of chores.
Sherlock just rolled his eyes. "Your jumper is on backwards and, deduction skills or not, I can tell you're hungover."
Sherlock let out a laugh as soon as the waitress returned to her station. “I didn’t take you to be easily flustered John.”
"Just a friend." Sherlock answered, ending the conversation by getting out his iPod and popping in the ear buds. He missed the look of confusion, followed by concern that crossed his brother's face.
Sherlock started copying down the information from John's presentation, not that he didn't already know that receptors are groups of specialized cells that can detect changes in the environment called stimuli, or that they are often located in the sense organs, or that each organ has receptors sensitive to particular kinds of stimulus. But he had promised John that he would at least try and participate in the class. Not to mention, Sherlock wanted to get further into John's good books so that when it came to the date of the trip he might be able to sit next to his teacher on the train – giving him even more time alone with John. The lesson ran by relatively quickly, Sherlock never felt as if he had enough time with John and certainly not time where he could be his usual self, not with Magnussen ad his friends around in the class. As always Mycroft would be picking him up after class in order to drive the pair home, his older brother worked in the local council building and so could get Sherlock on his own way back to the Holmes household. Normally Sherlock would find small amusement in wanting to make Mycroft wait for him, however today Sherlock was eager to get home early and get his mother to sign the form for the school trip. When the bell signaled the end of the day, he decided to pack up with the rest of his peers and actually leave on time for once. However, he still made sure to say goodbye to John, smiling at his friend as he left the room.
Hefty creative liberties taken with guild history, how libraries work in Terre D'ange, and how ciphers work in general.
John leans back against the headboard of the large bed and watches her as she moves about the room. She drops resin into lit braziers on the wall and the rich scent of opium slowly fills the air. She gathers vials from a cabinet and drips various sweet-smelling oils into a bowl, picking it up a few times to swirl it gently in her hands as she does. She walks over to the bed and smiles at him when he catches her eye.
His mind fills with images of the three of them laughing in a carriage or walking through the gardens, of hunting parties and chess games and late nights reading in the archives. Of afternoons alone with Seb in his rooms, and nights in desert tents when war called the army away.
She glances up at him, intrigued, and then her gaze takes in the bright pale line below the scar, etched skillfully into his skin. It is one of Sherlock’s favorite paths down his chest and stomach. Her fingers follow it lightly, and a moment later she sees the lighter ones curling across his torso and arms. She whispers something in Cruithne before looking back up to him. “Someone is trying very hard to keep you together.” She kisses him softly, her tongue lingering on his lips. “If the sword were meant to end you, it would have. You are alive, and you are here, exactly as you should be.” She smiles and the world grows bright. “Go lay down.”
“Possibly. I'll keep this one for a few days,” He motions to the ledger now on the table next to him.
“Small graces, at least. Anything that can lead us to the murderer?” Lestrade scrubs his hand across the back of his neck, looking defeated.
Elua, he is jumpy today. John usually handles other people when he's working; he is no longer used to giving attention to the outside world.
Sherlock is in the small bath that is separated from the rest of the room. He walks out of it holding something in his hand. “I found it on the windowsill, in plain sight. He had to have come back after everyone left. Even Lestrade’s men would have seen it.” He holds out his hand, and in it is a large ornate key attached to a slip of paper with a ribbon.
John walks out to the street just as the sun slips beneath the horizon, taking autumn's warmth with it. It is pointless to attempt avoiding this conversation. Lestrade is concerned, perhaps even rightfully so, and he will have his say whether John wants to hear it or not. If he'd said no to the tavern, Lestrade would just find him at home and not care that Sherlock was there to hear it as well.
John watches the Alban coastline fall away as their ship’s crew opens sails to the winds of the Straights. These last weeks had been interesting in ways that John would rather not think about, and he is glad to be going home. Was it really only a month ago that the Cruarch’s messenger had arrived at Baker Street? The attempted political coup at the surface of it all, the case Sherlock was meant to solve, was merely a stepping stone. Almost as soon as they set foot on Alban soil, they fell into a world of monstrous wolves, primal magic, angry spirits, and too many truths. Sherlock was fascinated and solved the case with his usual veracity. John slept fitfully, with his blades close at hand.
His move tonight will shift them into the final act, if Sherlock is at all observant. It is a momentous occasion. It is also one that will occur mostly behind closed doors, but he doesn’t mind. He could accomplish the night’s goal in a handful of different, more observable ways. He only needs expose the smallest end of a thread. But Sherlock cares deeply for Molly, and when the path to your enemy’s defeat could include using the anguissette that he loves, you don’t say no to that. It will be both entertaining and educational to observe his arrival, and James will be out of Mont Nuit before Sherlock sees her and finds his thread.
