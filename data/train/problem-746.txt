‘John!’ he cried as I began to spurt against him. I heard myself growling, unable to stop it, and pushed and pushed and pushed against him, wanting to be nearer, ever nearer, and was surprised to feel him pulse and arch and, with a long, almost high-pitched whine, he came against me. The moment was prolonged, carried us outward together, until my limbs became heavy and I collapsed once more (carefully) to his side.
I nodded and leaned my head into his palm, setting my chin on his knee as I looked up at him, imitating a suppliant, and it was never more accurate.
Holmes had been here nearly a month, he had said. It seemed he had finished his business in Paris, where he had read the papers and discovered he could only return to England to risk imprisonment or worse. But that was in Paris. Why had he immigrated to Berlin? I knew of his French heritage, had heard him speak French on multiple occasions; but when had he ever expressed any interested in living in Germany? I had deduced he was knowledgeable of German, from various infinitesimal comments he had made in our habitance together, but for the life of me I couldn’t recall any comments about visiting Germany, much less living in Berlin. I would have to ask him when he awoke. Perhaps a family secret? Or possibly — could a case have brought him here?
I was not sure how that sentence was meant to be finished, but I wouldn’t let him have an excuse not to eat. ‘Holmes, we must find you something to eat.’
‘Your brother said you go by Sigerson now.’
I was making my way to my luggage, abandoned still in the entryway, to fetch my shaving materials when Holmes emerged from the other room. He was a bit red in the face but was otherwise dressed as I had often seen him, albeit in more loosely fitted clothes and without his long coat. I thought better than to ask after it, or to comment on his reddened face, and decided to offer my arm wordlessly. He smiled, the movement not reaching his eyes in the way it had multiple times earlier, and he made no comment on my own appearance. I was not sure he would feel comfortable telling me if I were indeed not dressed as I should be, but I knew better than to ask, to save ourselves an awkward moment. I realised then that perhaps I was too concerned; my feelings, suddenly brought forth from the aether into which I had lain them, were blinding my good sense. Realising this, I tucked it all away and focussed on Holmes before me, alive once more.
. I gripped his unmarked thigh and thrust against it as I sped up the pace of my fingers.
‘Oh?’
Holmes & Watson share a bed non-platonically.
He said the last just a bit louder, as though testing me, testing the world, the crowd, and I looked around, panicked. Some heads from other tables looked up in our general direction, but just as soon lost interest and returned to their own worlds. Could we really be so safe? So invisible?
His hands travel gently from my hips to my chest, my pectorals, my shoulders, and I sit up straighter on his cock, my exhales shaky. He seems content to let me have this moment, and I appreciate it. I move my hips just so from side to side, feeling him move within me, and let out a whorish moan at the feeling. So full, so wonderfully…
He stood up again, leaning on his cane more than he had the entire day. I reached a hand out in response, wanting to say
I lay back and counted two breaths, waiting for the silence I knew was coming. When I looked up again, he was looking at me, puzzled, and dare I say even emotional, even be it so hidden from the world save my intimate knowledge of the man.
“John,” I start to moan. His arms rush around me, his knees bracketing me closer, and his hips buck upwards harsher than before. “
,’ he gasped, and I latched onto his jaw, his neck. ‘John.’
To whom it may concern: next chapter might go up in rating (and if it does, the fic's rating will be changed). Here's the warning in super advance.
He informed me that my belongings had already been packed (I ruffled at the thought of someone rifling through my things and Holmes’s, but I suppose I would have to be grateful for the expediency of it) and that my practise was already sold. My return to London, by the looks of it, was to be carried out for two reasons: to keep up appearances with the story Mycroft had crafted, and to personally fetch my savings and the money from the sale of my practise. I was fine with a quick trip — the weight at the thought of being so separated from Holmes again had begun to settle in my stomach. Mycroft handed me an envelope and finished our conversation with a speech that left me quite perturbed.
Holmes sniffled wetly and looked at me for a moment. ‘And Wagner.’
A grin broke out on his face, more joyful than I had ever seen him, and I felt the muscles of my face stretch to match his. The bed was ours, and I feel we had deserved it.
‘Holmes, have you not eaten anything today?’ I admonished.
Mycroft stared at me a moment before speaking. ‘My brother is a dead man. In the eyes of the law right now, and in the future, if ever the present situation were to be found out.’
‘Holmes, you needn’t stay,’ I rasped after a moment, realising this was probably dreadfully dull for him.
‘You are a marvel,’ I hushed, and it came out more hoarse and heartfelt than I meant it to. There was a sharp intake of breath next to me. I felt Holmes’s eyes on me but could not meet them, only settled for closing my eyes and kissing his hand, then holding it to my chest. When I opened them again, Holmes pulled his hand from my grasp and wrapped his arm around my shoulders, and the two of us leaned back on the couch, my hand on the knee of his bad leg, gentle but there.

Sherlock rolled his eyes but allowed John to lead him to the bathroom. “You know, I could’ve solved the case at least two days sooner if it weren’t for the incompetence of Scotland Yard.”

She told me that as long as I’m not expecting a response, it’s a ‘perfectly healthy coping mechanism’.
He clicked hesitantly. A light grey screen popped up, asking for the letters and word limit.
Breaking apart so that John could kiss Sherlock’s neck, he experimentally ground his cock into Sherlock’s. Both men moaned, Sherlock’s hands gripping John’s arse and pressing his closer. John pushed against the detective again, the friction just enough to satisfy him. It was like they were teenagers all over again, rutting in the basement while his mum was cooking dinner.

untrue.) The combined efforts of a slightly altered diet, carefully timed bowel movements, and the best air fresheners that money could buy all worked very nicely to keep John Watson in the dark about his bowel movements.
He was sure he had typed it right. He'd double checked, triple checked- hell, he'd even typed it out one letter at a time, like an imbecile.
, didn’t he?’
With three fingers inside Holmes, he changed. His stomach tensed, his prick began to drip, and his whimpers became almost higher-pitched. When I struck that place in him again, he began whimpering my name under his breath, as if unaware he was doing it, and I leant over him to kiss him, to feel my own name against my lips.
My world went black around the edges, my mouth opened to speak; I heard only a distant gasp and shuffling, and felt myself disappear. I came to most likely only moments later, when Holmes — was it Holmes? Dear God, please tell me it was — was walking me, supporting me, to a chair inside. I heard a door shut and slumped in the chair, gasping, and raised my hands to grasp his arms. He knelt in front of me, this man who so resembled my dear friend, save the darkness in his features and the look of pure concern on his face.
I lay on my right side, facing the wall, with Holmes in front of me in the same position. My right arm was somewhat above our heads, on the pillow, his under him. I pressed my face into the back of Holmes’s neck and let out a bone-deep exhale. In front of me, Holmes hummed and pulled my left around around him and slid himself back so that we were pressed together chest to knocking knees. I shuddered and splayed my left hand low on his stomach and kissed the back of his neck. In that sad excuse for a bed, with Holmes pressed against the front of me, our chests rising and falling together, I felt I was finally home. Within moments, I was asleep.
Luckily, I was provided this option and even encouraged by the man himself. While Holmes happily drummed his fingers on his thigh along to the music, my arm stayed around his shoulders through almost the entirety of the performance. When an especially poignant moment occurred in the opera, a moment which had been building for the entire movement, which even my unmusical ears could pick up on, Holmes took my hand and held it to his chest and even, briefly, brought his eyes to mine. The depth of feeling in them in that moment took my breath away. I squeezed his hand and looked back at him, hoping my gaze did not give away how much I was just barely holding back tears.
He smiled one of his royal smiles. 'She… knew.'
‘Nearly a month,’ he replied.
Holmes led me to what seemed to be a pharmacy and bid me to wait outside. I nodded, frankly thankful that I would not have to be faced with even the slightest chance of being expected to speak a language I did not know. He appeared a minute later with a glint in his eye and a pack of cigarettes. When he offered me one, I accepted, and we continued our walk, puffing wordlessly as we went. After a few steps, he began to hum good-spiritedly what I imagined to be a prelude to the concert; I was not able to prevent my chest from puffing up at the sound of Holmes in such good spirits.
He shook his head. ‘You are exquisite,’ he murmured, and took the hand I had placed on his stomach and kissed it. ‘Do continue.’
I realised, as he placed the contents of the sack on the table, that he was rolling his own cigarettes. It was something I don’t remember seeing him do before, and I admit I watched with hungry eyes, eager to see his long, thin fingers work the tobacco and paper just so.
My heart in my throat, I whispered back unsteadily, ‘I wouldn't have missed it for the world.’
I have long since given up on attempting to diminish or eradicate my secret desire for Holmes. In the more fanciful days of my youth, I would have thought the love, settled as it is now deep in my chest, would devour me from the inside out. And I would have let it. But now, as a middle-aged man, I know otherwise. It sits more like an aethereal presence near my heart, always there, a touchstone of truth. I feel it acutely when I awake, when I am eating, when I look at Holmes, when I speak to him, when I fall asleep, when I stare out the window of our carriage and know Holmes is contemplating beside me. This deep-seated love has itself become my companion, and I would not trade it in for anything in the world.
‘Neither have you, old chap.’ I let him have that one. ‘The food here…’
Holmes shook his head. ‘A house. A family estate. My dear grandmother’s home.’
‘Oh?’ I rasped around a thick tongue.
We stopped in the foyer, our arms once again separated.
I thanked him again and exited the room and the club as quickly as my legs could muster, my head still spinning. Holmes was, as promised, sitting on the bench across the street, and did not look up at me when I walked over to him. His eyes did, however, follow the envelope in my hand. I handed it to him.
‘They compared you to Oscar Wilde,’ I whispered, aghast at Holmes’s words.
His hands trace my spine lazily as I lift myself up -- with a gross noise between us of my seed drying and sticking to each of our chests -- and kiss him softly. His moustache tickles, but I lean into it. He hums and pulls me closer to him, and I close my eyes and kiss him and kiss him and kiss him. A thousand kisses would not be enough.
‘I have wanted you for so long,’ I whispered back, moving my hands under his shoulder blades so that I was flush above him, our chests pressed together and my hips never stilling. I felt his good leg hitch higher around me and knew I was still aiming true; his moans were constant now, and I felt his hand between us move quicker on his own prick.
Holmes, I thought obsessively; I was closer to him than anyone else ever had been, both body and spirit; closer to him, to the man I loved with everything I had and am. I moved within him, feeling my end approaching quicker now, and submitted to it. Holmes was in my arms, making soft noises as I stroked that spot within him with
He nodded and kissed me, his hand and hips moving to drive me to completion. I could only kiss him as much as I could manage and thrust into his grasp, and I could still feel his hard prick pulsing against mine, his breath stuttering against my lips, and I closed my eyes and fell quickly into my end.
‘Oh?’
My ears piqued at Holmes's words, and soon I found myself on the streets of Berlin again, arm and arm with Holmes, the sun just beginning to set. Holmes clearly had a destination in mind. He was in a hurry too, it seemed, but his injury kept him from moving his usual speed. I knew because he was holding onto my arm more so than he had earlier that day. I was more than happy to give him the support he needed and knew better than to comment on it. Holmes’s pride (or perhaps rather, his self-worth) was a dangerous, fragile thing.
Mycroft continued, his voice heavy with foreboding, very nearly a schoolmaster scolding a young boy.
‘Sherlock,’ I repeated.
He opened his mouth but only a soft whimper came out as I bit on his neck. I watched him lick his lips and try again. ‘For the love of God, John, I believe you can call me my Christian name now.’
‘Watson,’ he whispered, and I lost myself to his eyes and fell forward, pressing my lips to his. He was waiting for such a movement; our lips met, parted, and in a moment our tongues were brushing alongside each other’s and I was straightening myself and he himself so that I was fully atop him.
He cried out and then his hands were between us, shaking, frantically pushing my nightshirt up and gathering his to push it up as well; I stilled and backed off only enough to let him get our erections together with nothing between them. Finally, our nightshirts bunched up around our chests, I lowered my hips once more and rutted against him with nothing at all between us. His hand came to his mouth and I watched him lick it, understanding, and stilled my hips as he reached between us and held both of us in his hand.
I swallowed again, the words sitting heavy in my chest, my heart thudding around them. Yes, I wanted to say,
The moment passed, so I continued, ‘And you sent a telegram to your brother to send for me?’
‘Good afternoon, Doctor Watson.’
I hesitated, unsure.
‘John,’ he whispered, and I pulled away to look at him and nearly spent myself then. His eyes were clearer than I had ever seen them, not stormy but instead peaceful, and there was a look of such devotion in them that I balked.
He sat up then to look at me. ‘Are you?’
‘Stay here,’ I murmured, patting his knee. Even if he were asleep, and it looked like he was, mostly, I knew he would still hear me. ‘I’ll make tea.’
I cry out each time he thrusts now, and his thrusts are getting more frantic. His breathing is getting shallower, his chest heaving, a line of sweat along his forehead. I sit up a bit more to watch him and also to gain the leverage to rock myself back onto him, to meet him thrust for thrust. That makes him cry out, an animalistic grunt, and I begin to lose myself to my oncoming crisis.
. I sighed, exasperated, and stood up slowly, leaning on Holmes’s good side so as not to anger my own bad leg. ‘The bruises are fine, just extensive. But what of your leg?’
As I watch him lick his lips, I begin to rise off him only to fall back just as slowly. My thighs shake already from the feeling. His hands hold my hips once more, one traveling to my arse, and he tilts me forward. I lean my hands on either side of his head, gasping, and let him control the pace now.
Holmes.
I smiled and let myself brush his shoulder briefly. ‘He knows you.’
He chuckled and shook his head. ‘It is not that.’
Beneath me there is fumbling about, but I know what he’s doing: moments later there is a slicked finger at my entrance. I nod immediately and cup his jaw to kiss him properly again, eager now and impatient for him to prepare me. He does so as he always does: nearly coolly perfunctorily, that is until he brushes upon that spot inside me. He can always find it, some hidden talent of his for which I thank the stars above. One finger turns into two -- I have to leave his lips to pant and catch my breath.
‘Holmes…’ I started, without really an end in sight.
He hummed and shifted a little, pulling me closer, closer so that he was on his back and I was above him, his legs on either side of my hips. The position, the intimacy of it, made me hot; I felt sweat begin to accumulate at my hairline. He was kissing me, and it was all I could do to kiss back, to match him lip for lip, and keep breath in my lungs and some intellect in my head.
‘It is nothing to do with luck, dear fellow,’ I whispered against his lips, feeling as though I was holding the very world in my grasp. I felt his eyes on mine, even as mine were on his lips. I kissed him once more, a chaste peck, and continued, ‘It is all to do with love.’
I sat up on my elbows on either side of his shoulders, my own shoulder be damned, to look down at him. His hair was wild, his cheeks a beautiful rouge, his eyes remarkably bright even as pupilly black as they were. I captured his lips again, once, a quick pull, my heart pounding as he groaned again and fully arched, pressing his torso against mine, his head against the pillow. He was a sight like none I had ever seen, and I have never wanted anything more fiercely than I wanted him in that moment.
I looked at him as I brought over his tea; he had slept. His eyes were a bit red, his hair sleep-mussed. He looked very handsome, and it occurred to me that I could think that now, perhaps even express it to him. In all my years of knowing him, and thinking it, I could say it now.
My mood began to sour as I thought this through. Holmes had gone on a manhunt while I believed him dead. I mourned him harder than a man my age should have, and now, knowing better, I wondered if I could have assisted him. This was a case like the others were, and Holmes went through it alone, and got irreparably hurt. Could I have helped him? Could I have prevented any of his bruises, his injuries?
Then I thought of the years we spent apart, and Holmes looking down at his lap, not only ashamed but withdrawn, almost sad. I thought of what he had put himself through to protect me from what he thought of as his ruin, and I moved my chair forward and bent over the table, making sure my dear friend was watching as I lifted his hand, carried like a gem between mine, and kissed the back of it.
I brought his hand to my lips. This was a man who had sacrificed everything to keep his country safe, who selflessly let go of his life with his one companion, with no certainty of surviving, in order to protect him. This was a man who now had no home and a broken body. I kissed his hand, willing myself not to shed a tear, to be the brave one as he expected me to be.
It was over then, I was sure. I was only too sick in bed to pack and leave him, lest I spoil his reputation, or corrupt his innocent regard for me. Perhaps if I left immediately, some part of our friendship could be salvaged… Ah, but I could not even sit up in bed, I was in no state to leave him, not even to leave this bed. (I couldn’t leave him anyway, not to survive afterwards.)
I watched him, his eyes on the floor, as he made his way to me a bit slower than usual (another infinitesimal fact I chose to ignore). Once he reached my side, he took my arm, which was quite a good sign and made my heart soar. I smiled at him and patted his hand, and he let me lead the way out.
I frowned. I was never one to be so controlling that I had to know where Holmes was and what he was doing at all times — Holmes was his own man, something everyone who ever met him understood — and so he didn’t need me to peek into his personal affairs any more than he allowed me to. But his vagueness now, in this foreign city, after so soon a reunion (and just after last night’s rather intimate activities), cut me the wrong way.
Arm in arm, and accompanied by the soft taps of my cane on my right and Holmes’s on his left, we left the poor digs once more. I let Holmes guide me to the address to which Mycroft had bid us, content to rely on his inner map, which I am sure he had built within hours of setting foot in the city. The streets were busier than the day before, the people not altogether more foreign than the crowds in London. The sun was high in the sky, hardly a cloud in sight, and a nice, light blue; the wind was pleasant, and Holmes’s arm in mine was warm and comfortable. It all left me with an overall feeling of pleasantness, so much so that I felt that no matter what would come tomorrow, Holmes and I were together today, and that was more than I could have said for the past two years. Once again, a feeling of intense gratitude at my luck and the past day’s turn of events overtook me. I squeezed Holmes’s arm in mine. He hummed and patted my arm in his.
smile. I did not allow myself to bristle at seeing it directing at me, not in this moment. ‘It is a phenomenon treated quite differently here, my dear fellow, than in our old England.’
‘Yes, Watson.’ The words were hushed against my head; our foreheads were aligned and touching, and without thinking I was cupping his face. ‘I could ask the same of you,’ he whispered, and the depth of feeling in his words swelled my heart to bursting.
‘I will not have you die with me,’ he said adamantly, and looked at me, fire in his eyes. ‘Mycroft will give you some story to tell everyone. That’s his job to iron it out; I have given him a few ideas, but he knows … better. He will send you back to London today, I am sure.’
‘Holmes.’
‘Is it safe?’
After I finished my beer, of which Holmes himself even drank some, Holmes and I left the club. It was dark in the city now, and fewer people on the streets. A few people here and there were pouring out of the pub we were just in, including the two (possible) sailors, both of whom nodded at me with matching smirks before we each went our separate ways. I caught Holmes’s eye then and was surprised to find a dark look on his face. If I hadn’t known better, I would have guessed that look was one of jealousy; as it was, and especially with a smallish smirk on his own lips, it seemed a knowing, appreciative glance more than anything else.
Just before the performance began, Holmes turned to me, a soft expression on his face. ‘Thank you for accompanying me,’ he whispered.
I was limited in my movement in this position, but it also allowed me to penetrate him deeper, and I felt the effects of it within the first half-dozen thrusts. I was
He settled and reached backward to grasp my thigh, and I came closer to him and pressed inwards once more. He gasped.
‘Ah,’ I said smartly.
I nodded, unsure what I was allowed to repeat and what Holmes had already deduced.
‘Would you like a drink?’
I followed Holmes into the bedroom as we wordlessly prepared for bed. It was still quite early for both of us, but it seemed we had silently agreed it was time. The bed was small but loomed over us as we undressed and changed, our backs to each other. It was as though the coming change to our relationship — whatever might come of sharing a bed in love, a change even beyond the multitude kisses we had shared throughout the afternoon and evening — were an added weight in the air.
As promised, rating goes up in this chapter. Nothing plotty happens (other than romantically & passionately) -- so can be skipped if need be.
Holmes & Watson return 'home' after a pleasant evening out.
‘Do not pity me, Watson,’ he said in a chilled voice. ‘I am not to be pitied, that is the one thing I will not be able to stomach. Any care, any affection, yes, but not your pity. Never your pity.’
, and when he turned his head at an awkward angle and kissed me, I gasped and felt myself begin to spurt inside him.
‘The flower, three years ago, Watson, this is that flower.’
‘The odds that we would be arrested are abysmally small.’ His voice was tight, but I couldn’t fault him for it. I felt a flash of shame to even think of the possibility, but it was a possibility, wasn’t it, and especially for Holmes’s kind and the sort of relationship I had with him.
He sighed and turned his head to the side. ‘The fight was a little over a week ago. I— I sent for you as soon as it was safe, Watson, please believe me—’
The music was intense, just how Holmes liked it, I think, and I travelled the ambient journey with him by his side, as I always ought to be. This time, however, was even more intimate, and not only because we remained touching some way or another the entire time. It was also because of our closeness, the fact that I was so close to Holmes I could smell him, the fact that I could feel and hear his breath, his steady (if a bit heightened) pulse, and the fact that such closeness brought to mind our nocturnal activities once again. I chastised myself for a brief moment: I was obsessing now on the carnal. I had to remember that there was a chance such an encounter would not happen again, or any time soon, at the very least. I forced myself to remember this, until Holmes himself reversed this notion of doubt.
He lowered the newspaper and turned to me, a smile in his eyes. ‘Have you any plans for today, Watson?’
His eyes were closed, his face strained, his head thrown back against the pillow. It looked painful, nearly, but I understood it: it was years and years of desire and want culminating in this moment, in this shared movement, coming together like this, pressed together in our most intimate of places. A mark revealed itself on the side of his neck, a mark my mouth had created. I could feel his heart pounding in his chest and felt my own match it beat for beat.
I was led by a lad into some back room, and there waiting for me, sure enough, was Holmes’s elder brother. He stood at a desk which was sat in the middle of the room, a largeish window the only source of light. He looked the same as he had a few days before, when he had sent me here in the first place. It was strange to see him again here, and stranger still to realise that it had been only a few days, not years, since we last saw each other.
, but I couldn’t muster the words. He must have seen it in my face, my eagerness to explore this foreign side of him, because he held out his free hand.
‘Please,’ Holmes said, his eyes boring without pause or hesitation into mine, and he pulled me ever closer by my hips. Then he added, shamelessly, ‘I have wanted this for so long.’
‘Things would have come out, and I— It would have been dangerous for you, as well.’
‘I don’t wish to ruin your favour of me, Watson, although I daresay that would be a trick, given the hero’s welcome you accorded me just minutes ago.’ His hand was on the table once more, so I grabbed it, covered it gently with my own. If we were closer, I would have lifted it to my lips to kiss it.
He shook his head. ‘Some supplies in the washroom. There is hardly a thing around here…’
I had fallen ill, bedridden, fearing that that dreadful 'flu had returned to finish the job it attempted all those desolate years ago. For an entire week, I was worth nothing more than lying on my back in bed, having Mrs Hudson flitter about; and after the fourth day, even Holmes made an appearance at my bedside. He did not tickle my foot awake, but instead hovered over me like a villain until I awoke. When I did open my eyes, groggily and hardly sentient, he narrowed his hawklike gaze and stared me down until I blinked and closed my eyes again. I heard some bustling about; when I opened my eyes again perhaps ten or twenty minutes later, Holmes was sat in the chair near my bed, which he had moved closer so that his knees were nearly touching my blankets, and was fiddling his fingers on his thighs and looking all over my rooms.
I nodded.
‘Signed
It was from Mary, then. An old letter from his dead wife. I was unsure about many things in his life during my absence, but there was one thing I was immediately sure of the second I came back: he had loved Mary with his entire heart, and her illness had taken her away from him, and his heart with it.
I stood there, one unending moment leading into the next, and watched Holmes read the newspaper he held in front of his face, his head moving back and forth, and knew those grey eyes were passing quickly back and forth over the text. I ached to reach out for him, just to touch him, for in that moment he seemed untouchable, even aethereal. And I thought of last night, how he had arched under me, how he had given himself over to such intense pleasure and how I had done the same. Did he wish for that sort of activity to repeat itself? And if so, how soon? Previously, I had assumed Holmes had no interest in such activities or even in any romantic entanglement. Now, on the other side of such a night, I wondered what his appetite might be, and if it were possible that it might match mine. I was no longer a young man, I admit, but I had wanted Holmes for so long, I think my body would be up for anything, if I only knew he wanted it too.
The morning after; a knock on the door.
I looked over at him, wanting to touch him, his shoulder, his hair, anything, and found him instead with a ‘cat found the cream’ face. The rest of the somewhat bulky envelope appeared to be money. I was not acquainted with German money, but by the rigidity of Holmes’s shoulders, it must have been quite a lot of it.
Watson meets Mycroft; Holmes & Watson attend concerts.
My thumb brushed his cheek rhythmically, left right, right left, as I watched his eyes change with my pronouncement.
I said nothing, just looked at him.
I set the kettle going once more and ventured a guess where he kept the tea, and there it was, the cabinet above the stove, in fact the only cabinet, in a jar covered in unreadable German. I smelled it; it wasn’t a bit fresh, or even my or Holmes’s favourite, I noted, but it would have to do. I wondered if there were any good British tea in the city, and if so, how I would ever manage to find it or even afford it.
I nodded vaguely and looked at him; he was hopeful; I could see hope in his eyes, along with timidity and an interesting sort of shyness. I shook my head. Holmes had brought me here; what sort of joy could seeing such a place bring him?
‘You’re alive,’ I said, but instead of shouting it like I wanted to, like the feeling in my chest bid me to, it came out on a shaky exhale. ‘Holmes, by God, you’re alive.’ My voice broke and I watched a tear rush forward and slide down his cheek. Holmes, crying! I wiped it away quickly with my thumb and leaned back just to look at him, look him in the eyes, in those verdigris eyes which were searching my own, and with a soft noise I broke and leaned forward, pressing my lips to his.
I sat up a bit, separating our chests but not our hips, and rocked forward. I watched his face and rocked forward again. Even through our scant clothes, I could feel the head of his erection against mine; the feeling was heady, and overwhelming, but not as overwhelming as the sight of Holmes underneath me, overcome by pleasure.
I smirked at the attempted detachment of his command, but I knew better: his cheeks were flushed, and his prick wasn’t exactly soft, although it was without a doubt spent for the night. I pressed closer and rocked my hips once to see his reaction: he hummed and thrusted his hips back, forcing me inside deeper. He seemed very interested in continuing, and I knew Holmes rarely did anything he didn’t wish to, so I took him at his word and began to move.
‘There’s tea on the table,’ he said and turned back to his newspaper. I released my hands of him and hobbled over for some lukewarm, medium-grade tea, which should have been a lousy thought, but I couldn’t find it in myself to be too irritated. For it was tea in the presence of Holmes, and I think I could have withstood drinking sour milk if it meant I could watch Holmes work.
I could have hovered there for an eternity, bent awkwardly over the sofa and Holmes’s shoulder, if it meant I could continue kissing him. However, reality unfortunately set in after only a few moments; my shoulder and leg twinged in unison, and Holmes pulled away with a soft hum.
Watson is hungry; they attempt to figure out what to do next.
And I do so, his moustache, as well as some stubble, tickling me. I feel him smile into the kiss and feel myself returning it. My God, to think that I could allow myself this, that I could have this at all with the man that I love…
I moaned against his neck, my hips moving slower now as my thrusts deepened.
I eyed him. ‘Truly, Holmes?’
(See the end of the chapter for
He turned his head to my shoulder, mouthing at it, and moments later I felt a hand to my own arse, giving me a start, but I quickly understood the request of its placement. I thrust into him faster, then harder, snapping my hips as best as I could, fucking him with my prick as well as I knew how.
, Holmes. Anywhere you like.’ I reached over and put my hand on his, the two of our hands on his thigh. ‘Whenever you like and wherever you like,’ I hushed.
‘My dear man, I would never—’
Holmes & Watson attend a pub in Berlin.
‘Yes, John,’ Holmes whispered, his cheeks tinted. ‘There are several things I would like—’
'I can't, Holmes,' he whispered.
‘And?’
His head was arched to the heavens, his eyes squeezed shut; he moaned my name and what sounded like a garbled declaration of love, then let out a string of whimpers and even a few curses as he shook apart under me. I slowed my hips so as not to overstimulate him, but kept moving as smoothly as I could manage, as he spurted across his chest, his hand still on his prick. He was beautiful, aethereal, so real I thought I could cry; I kissed his face, every inch of him I could reach, until he caught his breath and pressed both hands to my shoulders.
‘And a bigger bed,’ I ventured, and was rewarded with a small, delighted laugh and a deeper blush. He stroked my cheek and thumbed my moustache; I gathered his hand in mine and kissed it. Together through anything, no matter what, I wanted to promise him. I could not leave him now; surely he must understand that. Holmes the great Mind must see that I could not possibly live without him now. And if he didn’t see it, I promised myself then that I would show him, every day, every minute and hour, until he believed it as strongly as I meant it.
— and retracted myself, breathing heavily, trying to backtrack and save myself, save our friendship. But he held my good shoulder with one hand and clasped the back of my head with his other and brought us back together, our noses touching. He closed his eyes and I did the same and breathed him in, and he whined, I would swear it to the day of my death, Sherlock Holmes whined against my lips before pressing his lips to mine, continuing the kiss which I had started.
I looked over at him on the couch. He hadn’t moved; perhaps he really was asleep. In the time since I had first entered this place, he had not seemed the Holmes I knew and recognised, the Holmes on the hunt. There was no hint of that great Detective in him, that I had seen. Had he possibly given that up, now that he couldn’t be in London? Now that his condition was… what it was? I found it hard to believe, damn near difficult to imagine, but I also doubt I could have ever pictured him in the state he was now. Moriarty had changed a lot of things, it seemed. Holmes had had to adapt. He would have to adapt.
I looked at Holmes. He looked sheepish, almost, as though Mycroft had said something or promised something that Holmes didn’t care for. I nodded, awaiting another comment, but got none.
(See the end of the chapter for
‘I’ve loved you for so long,’ he whispered brokenly. Panting, I kissed his neck, licked at the sweat there, and felt him start to tense around me.
‘Brooding, it sounded like,’ he replied and brought the newspaper up to his eyeline again, opening it. I knew he wasn’t paying it as much attention as he would have liked me to believe. I leaned over the sofa, over his shoulder, to kiss his cheek. The angle was terrible, but that close I could see him blush and smirk. Finally he turned his face to mine; his eyes roved over my face quickly, before falling on my lips, then rising up to my eyes. I smiled at him, bit back some sentimental drivel that seemed out of place in this moment, and when he leaned into me, I kissed him.
I had savings from my fruitful practise and from not paying rent at Baker Street (per Mycroft’s insistence after Holmes’s funeral). But those savings were rather safe in London, and I had no way of getting to them unless travelling back there. And the thought of leaving Holmes again — even for two days’ time — was devastating.
He stroked my hair as I panted, trying to catch my breath and waiting for him to continue speaking.
That conversation died out, and we finished our dinner and strolled for a bit before going to the concert house. Holmes had left our conversation behind him and must have moved on to anticipation for the concert, as he was nearly radiating with pent-up energy beside me. I had to keep myself from making smug faces at passersby: The man beside me was mine, he had chosen me, he was still alive, he was very much the man I loved, and we were going to a concert together. Walking with him, our canes on opposite sides, we limped together down the streets of Berlin, and I knew I had never felt happier in my life.
“And who are you inviting?”
"Pointless, you'll never find him, but I know a man who can," Sherlock replied.
"Why would you do this to me? To us? When I first came here you said you wouldn't force me to join but I chose to join and now you do this? It's a bad thing to do you must know that."
"Raoul killed her."
"That," Sherlock leaned over with a smirk way too big, "was my last act as a detective on this case."
It went to the time before (y/n) came to the restaurant, when Sherlock was looking at him instead of the waiter. And to when they talked and Sherlock made himself vulnerable. It was so unlike him John's whole world centered on the detective, and it didn't stop until (y/n) arrived.
"So Janus cars was in on it." You realized out loud." A company named after a two-faced god who's related to beginnings and endings. Is it possible that-"
Feel free to leave kudos, comments, and feedback if you have any. Thank you so so much for reading and I really hope you weren't disappointed by anything.
"Yes John, more likely. That'll be borne out by his backside."
John considered his words and Sherlock hoped they were doing their job properly. John's shoulders relaxing confirmed that they did.
"What for?"
"Oh she was adored," the man continued. "I've seen her take girls who looked like the back end of Routemasters and turn them into princesses," He struck you as very old-fashioned and you worried he didn't care about girls beyond their looks.
"Raoul is my rock, I don't think I could've managed without him." He said. "We didn't always see eye to eye but my sister was very dear to me."
The text was oddly brief. You’d think he would show some emotion but he might’ve been one of those people who sound really dry on texts. The text itself was interesting. It said the blast wasn’t a gas leak and that you were needed in 221B Baker street. The man responsible for it wasn’t planning on stopping now.
"So he made his move." She continued, "trying to scare me, I guess. Alright, what now? I'm scared, he got what he wanted, and I very much don't want to go back to my place, which you both probably guessed what it was on the note."
‘I want you inside me,’ he whispered after a moment, taking my breath away altogether. Before I could form a reply, he added, ‘I have everything we need. I have … done it before, not with another, per se, but I…’ He did not continue, but I understood all the same. After another moment which I spent forcing oxygen back into my lungs, I lost it all again when he said, his voice low and husky, ‘I want your prick inside me.’
fervour. It was as such that we spent several minutes, before I was beginning to become so heated I felt sweat form at the back of my neck; moments later his fingers brushed through it on his way into the back of my shirt, at the same time that his sharp hips found mine, and I broke the kiss.
It is almost as though he heard it, for just then he starts to shuffle awake. First his arms stretch, then his brow furrows, then he purses his lips briefly before licking them, and finally his eyelids flutter open and he squints. His arm and eyes find me at the same time, and I shuffle closer when he grumbles a wordless
‘You’ve not finished,’ he murmured. He sounded sleepy. I shook my head; I was still very hard and very much inside him. ‘I have an idea.’ He shuffled a bit, dislodging me, and turned over to his good side. I took his hint and lay behind him, just as we had slept the night before; I held one hand to my quite angry cock, willing myself with all that I had not to spend prematurely.
I fear, however, that however internalised this love has been cultivated, it seeps outward in ways others can detect. I know there would not be an intuitive person alive who would not suspect my love for Holmes, be it brotherly (as I try to simulate for everyone's sake) or much more (which it truly is). I try to keep it in check always, so that no harm would befall Holmes or his reputation upon its reveal, but I wonder sometimes whether I am truly capable of keeping such a roaring passion in check.
I watched a pleased smile spread across Holmes’s face. ‘Good. And tonight is Wagner.’ The newspaper was raised once more, covering his face. I wondered if he had the money for two concert events on a Sunday in this city; I wondered if that was the real reason Holmes had come here. Even I had heard of Berlin’s renowned reputation for music. I thought of Holmes, defeated in Paris with no hope of returning to London. Had he come here for solace in the music which was so important to him? If Holmes could not be the great Consulting Detective, would it not make sense for him to turn to music instead?
‘Your cousin is buying my practise?’
and hoped his Holmesian mind would translate and reply in a timely manner. I had an idea what he would suggest but prayed it would not come to any kind of separation between Holmes and me. We had only just been reunited; I was not sure my heart could take any further strain, and strain it would if I were to part with Holmes ever again.
I held the base of my prick and felt for his hole, angling it to line up. ‘Are you sure, Sherlock?’ Words were difficult to form, but I had to be absolutely positive that this — that this was wanted, because it felt, to me, like crossing the Rubicon.
I smiled, the strength of it growing as Holmes smiled back at me, even as he looked down. He held his lit cigarette in his mouth and began to roll another.
‘The ruffian’s.’ He took another sip of his tea then stood, walking across the kitchen to a ripped cardboard box sitting on the dirty floor. I could tell he couldn’t kneel, for he was bent over awkwardly, rummaging around in it. I left him to it and listened.
‘The risk?’ I asked, confused.
‘This is not an official business,’ was his reply, and so I took the next evening’s train to Berlin, my curiosity sufficiently piqued.
Holmes nodded and patted my hand. ‘I was told I had an ear for it. I still have most of the costumes.’
‘Treated differently?’
It was too intimate to read in whole. They had been wedded, after all, and I had been pretending to be dead. I skimmed it, taking care to school my face into no reaction, as this was not the time for my own possessive feelings regarding my companion.
I let out a surprised laugh and kissed his forehead. He leaned against me and closed his eyes. ‘Tomorrow,’ I murmured into his hair. ‘It is Sunday, Holmes. I’ll board the train tomorrow. If that’s even what Mycroft has planned for me.’
‘Telegrams?’ I had finished the beer and felt the weight of it sit on my empty stomach.
Setting the folder letter neatly on the arm of my companion's chair, I focussed my full attention once more on the man I loved.
He hums in understanding, a small grumble, and withdraws his fingers. “Sherlock,” he says as he hands the jar to me. I lean back and smear my hand, knowing what he is asking. We’ve done this enough times that no words are necessary anymore. I understand exactly what he wants, because I’ve done it dozens of times now.
I swallowed. ‘What do you mean?’
Holmes looked down, somewhere in the vicinity of my shoulder. He held the newspaper he had picked up in his hands, crossed in front of him. He shook his head.
‘Yes, Watson,’ he hushed. I thrilled at the sight of his full attention, those dark, wide eyes boring into my own.
He stared at me a moment longer, then set the flower delicately -- I have never seen him so gentle with anything before -- back in the book, and stood.
I nodded.
His eyes found mine, searching, and I continued to gaze at him, willing him to understand the length to which I was committed to him. Anywhere, wherever he would be.
him, made me nearly furious with passion.
, whatever that meant, fall to the side. Still, in the back of my mind, I knew I was and would always be on alert. But that was life with Holmes. At least I would not have to use the foreign moniker to his face.
‘We have time for a walk before Wagner, now,’ Holmes said next to me. ‘But first…’
The letter was written before she had died, but not too soon before, judging by her slanted, shaky writing. Skipping every other sentence, I understood what the purpose of the letter was: it was a blessing, an allowance, that Watson love with his whole heart whosoever may come after her. It was more than an admission and awareness of the good doctor’s full heart: No doubt she knew about me, and no doubt she knew how he loved me. She had seen his heart carried away once before, upon my false fall, and she had witnessed that same heart coming to love another, herself. It was a testimony to her own knowing, kind heart to hope he had yet another love in him, as he deserved. I agreed with her wholeheartedly. She couldn’t possibly have known I would be next. I am glad I was.
‘My brother told you things,’ he said ominously after our first course.
'Read it to me.'
The pain overruled after a few moments. I kissed his hairline and squeezed his hip, mindful of the bruises I knew were there. ‘Holmes,’ I hushed against his skin.
‘There is a man I must see,’ he answered surprisingly cheerfully, sparing me a quick glance before looking straight ahead again. ‘He has been researching something quite revolutionary indeed.’
‘Would you dance with me, Watson?’
I nodded, my blood boiling at the thought of being inside Holmes. He spread his legs then huffed in annoyance: his gown was in the way. It took us only a few more seconds to divest him and then myself, and then once more I was kneeling between his scandalously spread legs, salve on my fingers.
I smiled, trance broken, and walked over to the back of the sofa as he picked up the newspaper to his right. I placed a hand on his right shoulder and bent to kiss the crown of his head.
My own cock is trapped between our chests, rubbed with each rock back onto my Watson’s cock within me, and I know that even without that friction I would be close.
All I could manage was a gruff-sounding, ‘Y-es,’ and he pulled me by the hand towards the throng and into it. Bodies seemed to move around him as he went, the public clearing space for this very moment, and my heart leaped hard in my chest when he turned to me, hooked his cane over his elbow, and grasped my good shoulder. His posture and hand placement was one of a lady’s, and I realised slowly, my mind hazy not with smoke but desire, that Holmes was bidding me to lead the dance. Luckily the song, albeit jubilant, was slower in nature, and a sort of waltz would do; I doubted I, or Holmes for that matter, could quite muster anything as fast as a Viennese waltz, nor did I quite know the intricate steps of anything fancier. But I could dance, for the most part, or at least I could fake it well enough. I hooked my cane over my elbow, matching Holmes, took his hand and waist, and led.
‘You kept it,’ he murmured. He sounded awed. I had kept what?
He stood again, and with a quick glance to him and a hasty nod on his part, I unfastened his trousers and pulled them down enough to find a trail of ugly bruises from his hip bone down the outside of his left thigh. They were so fearful looking that I wasn’t able to restrain a gasp this time; my heart thudding in my chest, I rested my forehead on his stomach, holding him by the waist, careful not to grasp him too hard. Those bruises were deep; he must have been beaten to a pulp.
I withdrew my fingers and reached for the salve once more to slick myself up, but was surprised when Holmes sat up and took it out of my hands. I knelt before him, feeling a suppliant although our postures were equal. He kissed me once on the lips, then proceeded to focus all his attention on preparing my cock. I bit my lip and grasped his good shoulder so as not to lose it all then, counted to a dozen and then he was lying back against the pillow, pulling me to him by my prick, spreading his legs as wide as they could go, which happened to be fantastically, gorgeously, scandalously wide. I knelt between them and he lifted his hips up and shifted himself down, so that his arse was in my lap. I was not sure how long I could last in this position with my leg bent as it was, but the idea of it — of being inside Holmes, of being closer to him than anyone else ever had — overruled any concept of pain I could possibly conjure.
It stayed there that day until he picked it up again, using it as some explanation in a deduction of his, and he set it down again carelessly on the small table by my chair in the sitting room. It stayed there until it wilted, and before Mrs Hudson could bin it, I snuck it to my room when Holmes was sleeping and pressed it in my bedside book. It has been there since, going on three years now, and I am positive Holmes did not know about it before this winter.
‘It is from Mycroft. He will expect you there post haste.’
After a minute or so walking, Holmes stopped off to the side of the sidewalk to light another cigarette. He offered me one, which I wordlessly accepted, and even lit it for me, his hand cupping around the flame, our faces very close. I watched him intently from this close, unable to help myself. As it was lit, I took a drag and let him rake his eyes over my face as much as he liked, enjoying his thorough attention and affection. I watched him lick his lips, his eyes I am sure on my own lips, and then he turned with a small smile and curt nod and led the way again.
He handed me my drink, which I sipped. The beer I liked from earlier, of course. ‘I have something better in mind.’
‘It is true, my dear Watson. Every word of it. I am what they call an — an invert.’
He nodded, and his eyes opened and caught mine. There was a twinkle in them, just as there had been before all this, and he had a naughty look to him. ‘Very good, Watson. Yes, the blood was all my own.’ Even I could deduce the pride in his voice at what to him must have been a simple, even obvious, observation.
‘Watson,’ he whispered, moving to my cheek, my jaw, my neck, kissing me hurriedly or otherwise pressing his lips and dragging them about. ‘Watson, Watson, Watson,’ he chanted, and my heart broke again as I could only lay back and pant, eyes closed, holding in my arms the man I had wanted for so very long.
I blinked and overturned my hand in his, not able to grasp it well given my strength. ‘You know, Holmes.’ I coughed once more. ‘You must know. This is it.’ If I were to die anyway in this forsaken bed, he would know my feelings. I could deny him no longer. 'You know,' I whispered.
Eager to see him again, to make sure he was alright and — I admit I had to be sure this wasn’t a dream — to see if he was indeed alive and here with me, I rolled out of the cot and dressed quickly in the trousers from the day before and a new shirt and made haste to the sitting room.
Watson and I had been sharing rooms  -- and I mean beds, too -- for years, and it seemed with each year, I only grow more enamoured by him. It would be preposterous to say my love never faltered: I myself faltered at times, even I must admit, to which Watson himself can attest. My love for him felt, and still feels, like my veins themselves, constantly flowing, constantly pulsing throughout my entire body. He is in every part of me, in every molecule of my being; I have grown so accustomed to this that to lose his love would be a loss inconceivable. Through such grief I would surely cease to exist altogether.
He nodded, looking at his pocket watch, the movement finalising his breezy demeanour. ‘Doctor Watson, now that some truth has come to light, I must discuss with you some … trivialities.’
I smiled into the cup. ‘Oh?’
This is three weeks late and not even finished -- I am still cranking out the first major Sex Scene I've written in ages & thought 1) it'd be better to update to not lose you dear readers & 2) give you dear readers the option to skip smut easier if needs must.
Once at the café, I stayed silent as Holmes ordered for me (
‘Do you have a kit?’
,’ he exhaled several moments later, and it was all I needed to hear before I kissed him again. My heart was in my arms, all the love and light I ever had in my life, alive once more in my lap; if I never moved from that chair, I would die the happiest man on earth.
He tried for a quick smile in my direction but failed.
We were nearly late to the showing, the man taking tickets only soothed by Holmes’s apparently flawless German. He let us in, and I followed Holmes to our seats, rather far back from the stage. It wouldn’t be easy to see the actors, but going by the way Holmes was a solid ball of energy next to me, I could tell that the distance did not bother him in the slightest.
, there!’ I watched his hand on his cock again as it began to pull, and I matched my thrusts to it.
,’ he whispered, and thrust back as I thrust forward, and he stayed utterly still as I came to completion inside him, the moment lasting longer than I ever remembered. ‘Oh, Watson,’ he hushed, and I stilled finally, still trembling, and kissed him.
His eyes grew large, unbelieving; he nodded, squeezed my hand, lifted my hand to his mouth and kissed my upturned palm, each of my fingers, his eyes still on mine. There was a quiet yet sharp inhale, his hands trembling against mine, and his voice likewise shook as he whispered, in apparent reverence, ‘
‘Sherlock.’ I lowered myself onto my elbows once more and kissed his lips. I fed every desire I ever had into him, through my lips to his, and felt him respond to me with a whimper and a raised leg around my thigh. I felt his erection swell below mine, against mine, and let off the kiss to pant against his lips and thrust harder.
‘We couldn’t possibly be.’ I looked up to find a sad smile on his face. ‘Your readership is not so strong here, Watson.’
This fact about Holmes’s life before I met him did not surprise me; I held it close to my heart and kept it and let it feed into the image I had of Holmes as a younger man: spry and lively, but with some hint of sadness, a tint of loneliness. I saw it in the lines on his face whenever I returned from a trip which separated us. I recognised it in the wrinkles on his brow when I arrived in Berlin; they were the very same I noticed when I first met him in that laboratory those years ago. I wondered how long loneliness had haunted Holmes before I had found him.
‘I haven’t been able to afford my usual tobacco,’ he commented apologetically, drawing me out of my rather deep fantasies, watching his fingers work. He went on, and I forced myself to listen now, ‘This place is so drab, Watson! The tea is rank and my brand of tobacco is too expensive.’
My hands drifted up and down before resting, one on his shoulder, the other in his hair, as I took his lips over and over and over. He was humming, then moaning, then began to squirm under me, until I sat up a bit for air.
‘To Mycroft and Mrs Hudson.’ He took another bite. I blinked at him, his words catching up to me slowly.
(And to the commenter asking about Magnus Hirschfeld -- can't say what exactly he was doing in 1901, and trust me, I googled it, but we're eighteen years short of his Institut and still seven years short of Edward Carpenter's The Intermediate Sex. Hirschfeld was doing research for his Jahrbuch für sexuelle Zwischenstufen in 1901 I'm fairly positive, so perhaps... somewhere ... H&W are included.)
I nodded.
, Sherlock. Tell me what to do.’ I bit his neck gently and he keened again.
We sat on the couch together until I began to get a twinge in my back. Sitting up, I felt him stir beside me and realised he had fallen asleep. How little did he sleep now that he could doze so easily?
I nodded again and kissed his chin. I was aware: that much I had been aware of, from the army and from whispers spread within the medical field.
Something occurred to me then. ‘So the blood on your doorstep?’
This is still going -- reworking the next chapter as we speak. Some plot will happen, if we're lucky. To the readers who comment every chapter: You do not understand the strength you give me to continue this.
The men and women were separated, but that wasn’t terribly surprising: what was surprising was the way they were separated. Or rather, the… intimacies … between them. Men danced with men, and women danced with women. Men were draped across other men’s laps, women had arms around each other.
I dropped his hand and he stood then, eyeing me as he leaned closer. ‘There is only one bed.’
I could not take my eyes off of him. Even though he was looking down at me, and it would seem for all the world that he was leading, he yielded to me at every turn, every step, his eyes never leaving mine, coquettish under his lashes, his cheeks a warm, becoming shade. He was lovelier than I had ever seen him, and after that song ended and a slightly quicker one took its place, I pulled him a bit closer, not worried at all about impropriety, as there were couples beside us who seemed only to be embracing each other and rocking back and forth to some other beat. But he went as I pulled him, and he went as I led, the power he was allowing me humbling me above all else. That Holmes would yield to me in this moment meant more than I could say; for I had no doubt he was more than adept at any kind of dance man ever knew, and no doubt he knew I was rusty at the even simplest form of dance. It was an intimate submission, an even more intimate embrace. In the back of my mind, I wondered at the situation: I was holding Holmes in public, dancing with him even, among other men who undoubtedly felt a similar passion for their like-sex partners. A week ago, I woke up crying from a dream I had about Holmes. Now, I gripped him tighter around his waist and pulled him even closer until our chests were touching.
He was looking at the table, his hand on his leg. I knew he was in pain, but did not know what to say or do, especially in response to the look of shame and defeat on his face, so I blurted, ‘This chanteuse is quite talented.’
I sat him down at the table and walked around to sit across from him. I blinked; that wouldn’t do. I did whatever I could to move gracefully around the U-shaped booth to sit next to him.
‘John.’
He lost it within seconds; I felt him tense and cry out my name and I sat up just a little, my breath coming in fierce pants, to see his
'I love you,' he murmured into my hair, kissing it again. I sighed, kissed his knee, and allowed him to embrace me -- reciprocating everything I could -- as much as he wanted. We were impossible, I knew, and beyond blessed.
(See the end of the chapter for
‘None whatsoever, other than you.’
He nodded, letting go of the envelope so that I could keep it, and replied, ‘Open that with my brother, and no sooner.’ I nodded. He straightened and, in a move surprising to his character, clapped me on the shoulder. ‘Safe travels, Doctor.’
He was beautiful like this: wanton, and shameless, and somehow exactly like himself in this intimate moment. It was still Holmes before me, but a quivering, pleasure-seeking Holmes, lost not in himself but in this moment
By this time, Holmes had just finished rolling a fourth cigarette and put out the one he had been smoking. He didn’t reply for a moment, as he put all the accoutrements back together and closed the sack. I expected him to carry it back, but he didn’t, just left it on the table, and I wagered he was too sore. My suspicions were proven right as soon as I thought them; I observed his hand travel to his leg, rubbing up and down his thigh absentmindedly, and then he spoke.
Watson cleared his throat, the corners of his lips curved in a poor imitation of a smile, and with the fingers of his other hand combed through my unruly hair. (There'd been no reason to slick it back to perfection today. Never mind how I knew he liked seeing me just slightly unkempt while in the privacy of our own quarters.)
It lasted the span of a breath, our lips pressed together hard, then, as Holmes pulled back or else simply relaxed into the embrace, it immediately turned delicate. He pulled away before I would have liked him to, and then I chastised myself for wanting more when I realised again where we were, the thunderous cacophony of applause roaring back to my ears. I opened my eyes (had I closed them in the span of an instant?) to see Holmes inches from my face, his cheeks ruddy, his hair slightly unkempt, and a pleased, if small, smile on his face.
All in all, his German lodgings were barely furnished, cold, and about a third the size of our lodgings in London, and I had the feeling he had not been here long enough — or at the very least had not had the energy — to make it any homier. I assumed Mycroft was paying for it in some small way, and as I leaned against the counter, watching Holmes set about quite slowly to make tea, he murmured, his back to me, ‘It’s not Baker Street, but it’s all my meagre allowance can afford. And at any rate, it is one of the best in the area, and quite livable.’ Mind read again, I daresay.
He looked at me under his lashes again, then looked at his left leg. I stood up.
He was hot inside, and tight, and I couldn’t think any more about it when he clenched around that finger
‘Holmes, whyever not?’
I lean my weight on the pillow on either side of his head and lift myself up; our eyes meet and I nod and he pulls me down onto him, breaching me. I gasp at the feeling, my arms threatening to buckle. Every time, no matter how long we have done this, it is still overwhelming. His eyes are dark as he breaches me, and I let him control my lower half, pulling me down, seating himself within me. When my hips have reached his, I sit up a bit and pant, cursing under my breath. Gods above, the feel of him inside me always derails me utterly; I am laid waste to him.
‘He told you that we were to be
and moaned outright.
Our kisses blurred into each other after that, and I believe we fell asleep again, pressed together as such.
Holmes smiled. I turned it over in my hands and kissed his palm, smiling myself.
He took in a deep breath and exhaled loudly, a stone’s throw from a harrumph, but he spoke. ‘The fight with Moriarty was… involved. He…’ He was silent for several moments, his head turned to look at the wall, and finally he just shook his head. I knew then I wasn’t going to get any specifics. I nodded, trusting he would tell me in time. And even if I never learned of it — I would still take care of him.
He was unbelievably tight inside, and hot, and I bit my lip to force myself to last and not spend just then as I so wished to. The end was coming sooner than I meant it to; watching Holmes react like this, wanton, needy, and so responsive that I wanted to give him more, I leaned down as best as I could, one hand above his shoulder, and held his hip with the other.
I stroked his cheek and kissed his neck, his hairline, his ear, and held him closer. ‘I swear to it,’ I replied, and followed him soon thereafter into slumber.
‘I have a flat in mind,’ he said after a moment. I grinned at him as he blushed, his eyes flicking to my eyes and down and back to my eyes, a smiling growing on his lips.
He tutted. ‘You mustn’t talk, dear fellow. Here.’ To my surprise, he picked up my bedside book, a different one after three years, but one into which I had moved the flower-cum-bookmark. I attempted to sit up a bit for half a second, then dropped the notion as pain took me under. Holmes continued his thought: ‘I shall read to you.’
With just the tip of my cockstand inside, I groaned and Holmes bit his lip, his hand leaving bruises on my hip. I pressed slowly forward, in and in and
I nodded and kissed his hair and wrapped one arm around his shoulders, wanting to hold him. He went willingly, clutching my sides, an action which warmed my chest. Gods above, he looked heartbroken, melancholic, as though he were about to face something he had dreaded for a long time. Maybe he was. A part of me was somewhat pleased at the evidence that Holmes felt something so strong but most of all that it was tied to me, to him missing me when I had to leave. It soothed something deep and thorny within me, for it showed that his feelings matched mine; for I imagined my heart would rip into shreds when we parted again tomorrow. But then again — what an ever sweeter reunion we would have on the other side of it.
A sad smile crossed his lips. ‘I find myself disbelieving—’
— and the man himself tilted his hips up. ‘John.’
‘I’ll make tea,’ he said, and I followed him out of the foyer and into a small kitchen. I took the moment to calm my nerves, which I admit had been badly shaken upon seeing him again. I looked around instead of at the man himself; the house was cold but not damp and a bit smaller than our rooms on Baker Street. There were cobwebs in the corners, and as I peeked into the sitting room as we entered a room which must have been the kitchen, given the existence of a small stove with one kettle on it, I saw the telltale sign of Holmes’s inhabitance here: papers were strewn about, on nearly every surface possible. There were not nearly as many as he had in our rooms, but the style — if one can attach ‘style’ to such disorderliness — was quite the same. Had I not been overjoyed, nearly exuberant, at his being alive, I would have twitched in annoyance at the state of it all.
I grabbed his hand, wishing I could kneel but knowing my knees better. ‘I do not pity you, Holmes,’ I said firmly. Looking up at me, his eyes searched mine frantically. ‘I could never. As long as you give me no reason to.’
‘It is the only logical thing,’ he replied sullenly. ‘You have affairs you must attend to.’
The rays only serve to accentuate his golden features. To me he has always been a ray of light -- even, as he has recorded, a conductor of light. His greying hair still has traces of gold in it, and when he smiles at me, nay, when he merely gazes at me, he seems to shine like the sun itself, nearly too bright to look upon. I love him at all times, and I especially do so right now. My heart beats with it, every drumbeat seeming to resonate his name.
He shook his head.
Immediately I realised my mistake —
I felt him hum more than heard him and watched a small smile change his face. It was beatific; I grinned back at him. The next song was even livelier; I felt my spirits lift with the melody until I saw just a hint of a grimace on Holmes’s face. He did not falter his steps, but I knew just from that smallest eye twitch that he was in pain, had even felt his shoulders tense with it ever so briefly.
'I had forgotten she had written that,' he said, and this time his smile was real, as my hands cupped his elbows and my eyes fluttered shut. 'At the time, it seemed impossible.'
, but I bit my tongue.
I smirked. ‘Quite.’
Smirking, I bit harder then sucked harshly on the skin. ‘Sherlock.’
He looked up at me through his lashes, and I fair caught on. The papers.
Further: I was saddened to learn that the foxtrot wasn’t a thing until 1914, which is far too late for this Holmes & Watson. Even sadder to realise the fun dances of the twenties and thirties wouldn’t be an option for them either… For the love of fanfiction, can’t someone write an AU that places Holmes & Watson in that era and have them dance their hearts out? Or does someone have a fic rec thereof?
I led us in the direction of an empty corner table, my arm around his waist, giving him possibly more strength than he required, but all the same he was leaning on me heavily. I berated myself; had I pushed him too far? Would he be able to stand if I let him go?
After several minutes of silence, Holmes said, without lowering the newspaper held in front of his face, ‘Hamlet is playing this afternoon at the Luisen Theater.’
My things sorted, I wandered back to Holmes, who still was sat in the entryway, staring at the wall and seemingly deep in thought. After a moment, he looked up.
Holmes looked the other way. I tried setting his trousers up again, but he stilled my hands.
I watched his eyes flicker and dance, a smile toil at his lips before spreading into a grin, and he said back to me, apparent wonder in his voice, ‘And I you, my John.’
He nodded. ‘They do not raid these pubs like in London. There is only the trust that nothing overtly inappropriate occurs in the… front rooms.’ I looked around, taking in all of the touching, freely displayed in the open. It was, admittedly, rather a shock to my nerves. Perhaps I could no longer hold to any purity of soul in regards to the direction of my affections, but to see it in front of my face openly, shamelessly, rose a blush to my cheeks. I felt a volt of panic course through me, but Holmes took my arm and spoke. ‘If you feel uncomfortable, we can of course leave…’
I nodded dumbly, his words cutting me deep. Reality set in, as though I had been living in a dream the past two days (and in some ways, I feel I must have been). What Holmes and I did last night, even our very sentiment regarding each other, was illegal. In Germany and in England. Our love was undeniable and all-consuming, I knew, but there was a fragility to it as well. One mistake, one false move, and it could fall apart in our hands. I could lose Holmes in it as easily as he could lose me; the law could ruin either or both of us sooner than we could prepare. Modesty and due diligence would have to be forefront in our relations to each other, even when alone; it would always be there, following us, haunting us. We would have to learn to live with it, else it consumed us and separated us. To continue with each other, with our sentiment, we would have to be overcautious at every moment. It was a promise I made to myself then: that above all, Holmes’s safety must be put first.
‘Holmes,’ I said, and I felt myself begin to shake. His hands, those hands I’ve yearned for, with those long, thin fingers, clutched my shoulders, and I buckled forward. ‘Holmes, is that really you?’
‘Have you no faith in me at all?’ I muttered, mostly to myself, as I reached across the table and placed my hand on his wrist, feeling his pulse thump against my skin. ‘Holmes, we have already discussed this.’
‘You’re no less of a man to me, Holmes,’ I whispered into his hair. ‘I didn’t want to believe those rumours, the nasty gossip they were spreading about you—’ He huffed against my neck. ‘But I am very pleased that they are true.’
when I was
He let out a low hum, almost a purr, and arched into me. The movement freed my arm briefly; I sat up a bit and flexed it, then propped my head up to look down at Holmes, who had turned more on his back and was looking up at me. He looked sleepy, as though he had indeed slept a little (a fact for which I was grateful), and he had an ornery twinkle in his eyes. My heart pounded as he turned more and lifted his left hand to cup my cheek.
I could not be convinced of it; but to press any further would be to draw a wedge between Holmes and myself. My promise would keep — I would not put any unnecessary danger between the two of us and the rest of the world — but I let the severity, the undercurrent of panic at being
He continued finally, but somewhat out of breath, ‘I was looking for a fight, in a pub I’d passed on my way to get a newspaper. The man — a working class Berliner — offered it up to me in the form of some snide comment; even in German, Watson, I knew if I didn’t fight, my dignity would have been tainted.’ As he continued rummaging around, I was grateful he couldn’t see my face grimacing at his blasé commentary. ‘I slung, and he slung, and within two punches we were each of us rather kicked out.’ He stood up finally, a small drawstring sack in his shaking hands, and limped back to his chair.
‘He a far more successful one than I,’ he said with a bitter laugh.
This time he seemed to have gathered himself, and I still kneeling, cupped my cheek and spread his thumb across my high cheekbone.
Holmes gave me an indulgent smile and a pat on the knee, and as the curtain was raised, he shushed me (needlessly, as I was struck silent), but most importantly he neglected to remove his hand. Looking around, seeing all other eyes focussed only on the stage, I covered his hand with my own and laced our fingers together. They stayed like that for the remainder of the performance, even after Holmes once laughed out loud and raised his hand to his mouth to cover the noise; even after that, his hand meandered back to my own, waiting still on my knee.
We doddered back to his digs slowly and, for once, not arm in arm. There was a heat to his very presence that hadn’t been there before, as though he were burning from the inside out, his chin tipped upward as though floating on high above the rest of us. I wondered at him; his moods, as I have transcribed, have always seemed mercurial at best, and it seemed he had not changed so much in that respect.
His head fell between his arms, and for the first time since I set eyes on him that day, I realised how exhausted, how downtrodden, this man was. I let go of his arms gingerly and stood up, mindful of the tea, and put my arms around his shoulders. All the tension in his body released, and I was able to pull him out of the chair and hobble us both into the adjacent sitting room and onto a stiff, battered-looking old couch. The furniture was set up in almost exactly the same formation as our rooms, which was something I would think about more in depth at a later time. For the moment, I reclined against the arm of the sofa and let Holmes naturally relax against me, his head on my chest, our legs tangled. I wrapped my arms around him, content now to just hold him, hoping this affection was welcome and that I was not overstepping my bounds.
‘They could never know what you really are,’ I replied, trying for bravado but it only came out hushed and awed. ‘Not to me.’
‘Indeed,’ Holmes replied with a smirk. The tension was lessened when Holmes chuckled beside me, I joining in.
Holmes chortled. ‘Yes, when I require an alibi, I am somewhat Norwegian,’ he said in a very convincing foreign accent. He slipped back into his posh lilt: ‘But no one here knows, or cares, about Sherlock Holmes and his companion Dr Watson.’
I grunted. ‘
In what could have been an insult to my livelihood turned out to be a more than welcome statement.
“You’re a rascal this morning, aren’t you,” he hushes against my hips, bringing my hips into a slow, leisurely roll. My faculties fail me when our erections press together: I can only gasp and nod. My Watson always knows how to break me in the end, to turn me into a feeling creature instead of a thinking machine. Only he can, and it is only him whom I allow to see me like this.
‘Anything by Havelock Ellis? J.A. Symonds?’ I shook my head; those were names I had never even heard. He nodded and went on, ‘Of course not. There is… There has been research done here in Germany about such a condition, did you know?’ Once more I shook my head. He smiled; it was his
He groaned at the stretch, his hips twitching minutely off the bed, and with one quick look at me, one of his hands flew to his cock. I swallowed thickly. There was a stillness in the air, as though we were caught in this moment, suspended in it, in its intimacy; I inside him and watching him pleasure himself. He stared at me, his hand still on his cock, just holding it almost comically, until I swallowed again and nodded.
It wasn’t a roast cooked by Mrs Hudson, but it would do.
I swallowed against a dry throat and rasped, ‘Then I will do it, if I must.’
Anderson and Sally stared at Sherlock, waiting for a scathing response. Something sarcastic. Something witty. That was the script. But Sherlock was frozen, face completely, scarily blank.

“I see your new boyfriend prefers your N°5 over your Chance Eau Vive,” Sherlock replied in place of a greeting.
A small, gentle smile crinkled the corners of Sherlock’s eyes, but it was short lived.
"You have your own laptop. Look, on my laptop, I even made you a guest account! There's no need to log onto mine," John snarked.
Sherlock smiled reassuringly, leaning down so his face was even with John’s. “You.”

“I mean, I’m no Sherlock Holmes, but I think I might’ve noticed if there was an extra bloke at the breakfast table,” John pointed out with a smirk, trying to seem nonchalant. Sherlock swallowed, his Adam’s apple bobbing. “But I agree. Beards chafe and make intimacy very uncomfortable,” John finally added.
Because I need to see you in person to tell if you’re lying to me, and if you aren’t, I need to kiss you.

Sherlock rolled his eyes and bit back a sarcastic remark, stepping aside to let the doctor into the tub first. Once he had settled, Sherlock climbed in as well, nestling between John’s spread legs.
The flat was dead silent, heavy with unspoken words.
He grabbed the lamp and plugged it in, reaching for a scrap of paper and a pencil. The light flickered on and he set it near his chair, the blacklight reaching just far enough to illuminate the entire keyboard.

John flushed, surprised by his own audacity. He, of course, thought that Sherlock already knew, but there are some things that he never thought he would need to say aloud. “You didn’t deduce that I’m bisexual?”
You broke into my flat? I didn’t hear you come in.
Coming down from his high, John sighed as he rested his slightly sweaty face on Sherlock’s chest, their legs intertwining. “That was… interesting,” Sherlock finally stated, one hand idly stroking John’s hair.

Why wouldn't it-?
So he was listening.
Sherlock strode over John and bent over, carefully shielding his hands as he typed. With flourish, he tapped the enter key, and the home screen sprang up.
John laughed, one hand carding through Sherlock's impossibly soft curls. "Funny, I'd just come to that same conclusion."
Too many people would be expecting it. Prepared to stop it.
"Sherlock..." the doctor started, pausing to choose his phrasing carefully, "how the hell did you work out my computer password?"

"That's not fair," John huffed, smacking Sherlock playfully on his blue vest. "My phaser's only dead for five seconds, so I'd run if I were you."
Sorry. I had to make a phone call.
Sorry.
For one heart-stopping second, John thought he had a horrible, gaping wound on his forehead that was bleeding onto the carpet. Before he could ask what the problem was, he realized—he’d forgotten to take his razor to the conference and the front desk at the hotel he'd stayed at was out of them.
Having finally caught on, Anderson raised his chin and crossed his arms, seeming to dare Sherlock to speak. God, he really was an idiot.
We only got out to walk and get gas
He could no longer leave body parts out in the open or store them in anything used in either food preparation or consumption. His assorted drug paraphernalia which he kept for strictly medicinal and/or scientific purposes had to be meticulously hidden from his new flatmate. He could no longer walk around the flat completely starkers (while John was home, anyway.) All these changes were annoyances, yes, but nothing that Sherlock would lose any proverbial sleep over. None except one.

Sherlock’s eyes fluttered closed as the cold, burning ointment was smeared across his temple by expert fingers. John carefully cleaned, disinfected, and bandaged the cut, finishing the ritual with a kiss to the covered wound. “There. You’re free to go.”
She fluttered away, muttering to herself about the state of the flat (“The mess Sherlock leaves! You’d think he was raised by animals.”) and John trekked to the bathroom, finally able to rid himself of the apparently offensive scruff.
Having both said their parts, Anderson and Sally stared at Sherlock, waiting for a scathing response. Something sarcastic. Something witty. That was the script. But Sherlock was frozen, face completely, scarily blank.
Then John nudges his flatmate playfully, smiling conspiratorially at whomever was forced to hear this story. “But he has to put up with smelling my shit every day since I don’t bother hiding it because I’m not a posh git who pretends he doesn’t even fart.”
Of course, Sherlock already knew this, but he also knew that the doctor found comfort in taking care of him. “Well, you’ve finished washing my hair, so can we get out now? You’re exhausted I’m sure.”
HE really jusy wants to keep us apart
"Yes?" he pressed, clicking the tongs he held. "I'm on a time crunch. I don't have time for chatter."

One of Sherlock’s arms dangled over the edge of the sofa, the other bent awkwardly between John’s leg and the back of the couch, long fingers splayed possessively across John’s hip. For several minutes John simply laid in silence, basking in the fact that Sherlock Holmes was laying on top of him. Of course it was only an accident, and Sherlock would leap up the moment he woke, but that didn’t mean he couldn’t enjoy it while it lasted.
‘We are safe in this city,’ Holmes replied softly. ‘I have done research. I have felt around; there is nothing here. We are invisible here, Watson. And even if we weren’t… We are, in the German eyes, foreigners. They would merely bid us to leave.’
I awoke again in what must have been in the middle of the night, a sharp twinge in my shoulder. I looked over Holmes’s shoulder: he was awake. I had to move my arm or risk a useless limb the next day, but it was still under Holmes’s head, and I didn’t want to startle him.
He nodded. ‘I was on my way to see you again. Mycroft had been giving me updates, short coded messages. I— I was on my way to see you again, Watson, and as soon as I saw the papers, I knew I couldn’t ever possibly return to England again, or else risk ruin.’
“Naked,” he says simply, and I fulfil his request swiftly and with no hesitation. When I return atop him, he is bare as well, save sparkling eyes and our jar of salve in his left hand. “You want more, don’t you?” he grumbles, a warm, knowing timbre to his voice, and I shiver. “I know you do: I can tell, you know.”
‘You merely miss my irritating presence,’ I rasped, then coughed. Speaking was not well to do, but I was afraid he would leave, bored, if I were silent.
The walk to the café was more than I could imagine was comfortable for him. This wasn’t London, and even in a setting in which I knew no one and no one knew me, I didn’t take Holmes’s arm like we sometimes used to walk. He was quiet, and I could tell his mood had changed. There was a stiffness in him. It took all of my effort not to believe the rigidity lay in his regard for me. I held my tongue — we had talked about emotions enough for one day. I pushed forward and let my hand briefly touch his as they swayed while we walked. It was a brisk spring day, or rather evening, and the wind did much to clear my moody thoughts. Holmes was once more by my side, and I let his presence fill me for the entirety of our silent walk.
‘Why couldn’t you have told me, Holmes?’ I wanted to reach out and touch him, to understand why he thought he had to keep this all from me. But then I saw the look in his eyes as they reached mine.
I found Holmes sat on the sofa, his bad leg stretched out, his other bent at the knee. Newspapers flooded the room; a newspaper was in his hand, more discarded on either side of him on the smallish sofa, and seemingly dozens more all along the floor and even behind the sofa, as if he had thrown some over his shoulder in dismay or carelessness. His back was me, as I was behind the sofa, so I was able to take it all in without interruption: his charmingly sleep-mussed hair, his wrinkled white shirt, his hauntingly upright posture, his intense focus on the task at hand.
