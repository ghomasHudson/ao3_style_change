, it said. With a heavy thump, Dean let himself slide back from the bed and landed on his knees. Cas hadn’t had a second to adjust or process what was happening when Dean pulled off his trousers in one sharp gesture, leaving Cas slightly taken aback in his briefs and now fully hard. “So”, Dean teased and pressed Cas thighs down with his hands, leaning forward to nibble on the bone right above his waistband. Cas wanted to sit up, telling Dean to come back on top, but Dean’s tongue started playing with the skin under the elastic now and all willpower left his body. He fell back, softly moaning in anticipation of where that tongue would travel to next. “Dean”, he cried. Dean continued playing with the briefs as if it were his favourite thing in the world, ignoring Cas twitching dick. He tugged at the elastics, letting it snap back into Cas’ leg and nursing the redding skin beneath. Excruciatingly slow he made his way to the bulge, tracing the outline with his lips. Hovering over it and breathing against the fabric, he tested and applied more pressure with his hands on Castiel’s thighs. In return Cas moaned, every shift of Dean made him want him more, his touch burning on his skin. “Mmh”, Dean hummed, his mouth still right above Castiel’s cock. “What did you want me to do again?”, he asked sheepishly. “Dean.”, this time there was a warning in Castiel’s voice, he knew Dean was toying with him, but the strain in his loins was getting more than he could handle. “I forgot what it was, why don’t you remind me?”, Dean asked his tongue darting out and licking an inch away from the bulge, driving Castiel insane. “I told you, you should have me”, Cas pressed out, his breath was short, forced. “Aah, yes. However I want?”, Dean asked, his own voice was getting clipped, even he couldn’t keep up that façade any longer. “Dean.”, Cas growled he couldn’t control himself for much longer. But just before he could say anything else and without wanting to, his hips jolted upward, thrusting in Dean’s face. “Na-ha.”, Dean chuckled and pressed down harder, keeping Cas in place before him. “Dean, please”, Castiel whined, his hips were still thrusting into Dean’s hands, begging for friction and unable to stop. “Ah, the magic word.”, Dean sighed and with that he kissed Cas’ cock through his underwear, catching it in his mouth. Castiel almost howled and his back arched upwards, relieved by the touch and the hotness of Dean’s mouth on his dick. Dean’s tongue slivered over the briefs, wetting it and Cas moved his hips again, pushing his cock further into Dean’s mouth. “You want me to have you, huh”, Dean murmured but Cas couldn’t answer, wanting nothing more than Dean to blow him. “Lucky you, that I promised to take care of my husband.”, Dean smirked, and Cas almost answered that in fact, this hadn’t been in Dean’s vows, but bit back the snarky comment. Hot and bothered Dean yanked down Cas’ briefs and wrapped his hand around his cock, his thumb pressing into the vein underneath, keeping it upright. Without any more teasing, he bent over and swallowed Cas’ cock, pushing past the tip and as far down as he could. He was quite skilled at that, now. Taken by the sudden wet heat around his cock, Cas gasped and gripped the sheets. Dean bobbed his head a few times to test out how far down to go, covering the rest of Cas’ dick with his hand, even though there was not much left when he leaned into it. His mouth closed tighter around Cas and his tongue twirled a few times rhythmically with his head moving up and down. Having lost the last bit of command over his own body, Cas toes curled, and he pushed himself further into Dean. Thrusting and moaning he fucked into Dean’s mouth until saliva ran down Dean’s chin dripping onto the bed. Lips pink and a sore sensation in his throat, Dean sped up his pace, his free hand wandered up to Cas hip to regulate the grinding and guiding them into a unison rhythm. Cas panted and moaned, calling out Dean’s name from time to time. Teeth and tongue scratched over the thin skin and Dean’s lip had swollen from the friction. Nothing came close to the taste of Cas. With Cas’ breathing getting more erratic by the second, Dean pressed his lips together tightly one last time and then tore away from Cas altogether. Confused by the sudden coldness, Cas cried out in irritation. But Dean was already up, sliding down his own trousers and boxers, kicking them away carelessly. Naked and his own erection growing steadily, he leapt onto Cas, pressing their mouths together. His tongue broke through Cas’ lips, licking hungrily at the insides of Cas mouth, searching for the other's tongue. One hand pinned Cas arm up, the other found his hips again, keeping him in place as Dean thrust their cocks together. He let out a hiss, the feeling of skin on skin vibrating through his body. “God, Cas”, he groaned through gritted teeth as Cas hand gripped Dean’s side, his eyes were shut and heat rolling through him in waves. Sitting up straighter, Dean straddled Cas again, rubbing their cocks together more vigorously, he was so hard by now it hurt. A constant stinging tore at his insides, aching to be released and he knew he had to fuck Cas square, he couldn’t keep dragging this out any longer. Through his lashes, he glanced down at Cas, who had his eyes still shut and a raw expression on his face. He looked utterly beautiful. Dean breathed in sharply. He knew how to touch him; he knew what to do to get Cas on the edge and over. Knowing that only he could get him there made his heart wrench. He could make Cas hitch and pant and lose control. He could make him cry and moan with lust and thrust into him like there was no tomorrow and as if only they existed in the entire world. Dean gripped Cas hand and intertwined their fingers. He could make Cas come and yell his name while doing so. Cas fingers curled around his until his fingertips turned white. “Cas”, Dean whispered, his voice cracking, he kept thrusting for a few moments then he broke their touch and guided Cas on his belly. Dean grabbed the lube from the side stand, rubbing the thick liquid between his hands before he pressed two fingers against Cas hole. Instantly, Cas spread his legs wider, giving Dean more space and Dean leaned over him, his fingers still massaging Cas. Placing kisses on his neck and base of his hairline he kept the circular motions, working his way in. When he pushed through, Cas’ body curved up and into him, a ragged breath escaping his lips. “Yes, please, Dean”, he croaked, fingers feeling forwards to find his hand again. Dean felt his own hips spasm, thrusting into Cas’ back, needing friction and skin. Lowering his head, he brought his lips to Cas’ ear, moaning into him. “I’m good, I’m good, Dean, please”, Cas whined next to him, urging him to finally get in and Dean happily obliged. Grabbing the lube again and pouring the cold fluid on his hand he smeared it all over Cas’ crack and then continued slicking his cock. The touch of his own hands already making him shiver. He placed a hand on Cas’ hip while the other kept himself steady, slowly surging forward, pushing deeper and deeper into him. Feeling Cas wrapped around him made him dizzy and he threw his head back in an attempt clear his head. Underneath him, Cas hitched and cried soft yesses. “Jesus, babe”, Dean roared, fingers digging into the fleshy side. He found a slow rhythm, rolling his hips forward and back, wet sounds coming from beneath as he pushed in and out. As he sped up, Cas moans grew louder and his words less intelligible. He whimpered and groaned when Dean’s thrust became more ferociously. His own movements were harder to control now, growing more erratic with each thrust and as he felt coming nearer to the edge he bent over Cas, reaching around him to catch his cock. Pumping him in strong, quick strokes Cas’ mumbling rose again and now that Dean was closer to his face, he heard the strange words falling out of Cas mouth and it took him a moment to realise that Cas was talking in another language. Suddenly it dawned on him. Shaking and panting, Cas moved with Dean, pushing back into him, longing for his touch and the feeling of him inside. The Enochian words rushing out of him sounded pleading and needy. Dean swallowed, grinding harder. Somehow, Cas talking in his native tongue turned him on. His hand fastened around Cas’ cock, and his thumb rubbed over the tip every time he went down, making Cas quiver. “Yes, baby. Come for me”, Dean was close, sweat gathering at his temples. Driving Cas into his hand with every push, Dean quaked and shivered, moaning louder and his whole body was tense. Cas lost his thoughts as he fucked into Dean’s hand, feeling him pushing inside from behind. His eyes were shut but still, white freckles appeared as he neared his orgasm. Hot and cold flashes ran through them and when Cas’ finger brushed over Dean’s hand and felt the metal band under his tip, he buckled up. “Dean”, he cried and with that he spilt into Dean’s fist, numbly tumbling over. His hand wet from Cas’ cum, Dean pushed in one last time, his whole body screaming at him and then a warm rush rolled through his body and he came with Cas name on his lips, echoing in every corner of his body. Dean slumped over; Cas was still shaking from coming underneath him. “Baby”, Dean repeated over and over as he came down, placing lazy kisses on every inch of Cas that his lips could find. Cas had rolled onto his side and Dean curled around him; their hands entangled. “I love you,”, Cas whispered as he rested his head on Dean’s upper arm. “I love you too babe.”, Dean answered into the black mess of hair in front of him, brushing his thumb over Cas' as he drifted off. Cas felt Dean’s heartbeat on his back slowing down. The air was still, and they could only hear their own breathing. “Now and forever”, Dean murmured into the tussled locks and they fell asleep in clean white sheets, the moon bright above them and their wedding bands glistening in the white light coming through their window. Soon a new day would begin. They had all the time in the world.
to feel Sam’s heart beating against his hand again.
Mary managed to keep her head above water half the time, calling him every day to hear from him, to which Dean responded with as many reassuring words as he could. Everyone knew that most of them sounded empty, but they could only
was more complicated to understand and even after the third listening, Castiel was still not sure if he had grasped the main message. When he picked
Castiel shook his head, a bit stunned. Meg resumed.
However, although he had so far moderated those moments of lounging to prevent Sam from laughing at him anymore, Dean had always dreamed of being able to spend whole days literally doing nothing. Don’t get him wrong, he was a man of action and he needed his quota of monsters and adventure within a week. Nevertheless, he certainly wouldn’t say no to weekends holed up in the bunker to worry about nothing but eating and sleeping from time to time.
" and Castiel loved the sound of that sentence, because he already knew that he wanted to explore every possible and imaginable existence with Dean until the end of his very long life. It would probably be a bit silly if he confessed it aloud to his companion, but he would not hesitate to let Dean know it just to see him blush and mumble two or three swear words under his breath before kissing him gently on the lips.
Cas started wheezing, and another cough wracked his frail body, but this time it didn’t stop. Not until Cas fell back onto the ground, unmoving and silent.
"Um..." Cas swallowed visibly before he shyly looked away. Dean could see he was breathing harder when his finger reached up to his tie, trembling slightly as he opened it. "I... we can do whatever you feel comfortable with."
“Christ, why can’t it ever be simple?” Dean shook his head again before pulling into the parking lot of a Rite Aid. When he pulled into a stall, he took out his own cell phone. “There’s gotta be something…”
For some reason that didn't sit right with Cas. He really didn't want to miss out on it. "Oh, no, we will do that! You said something about an adventure, and I am in."
It was funny to see how Castiel immediately dropped his expression and returned to his own personality. "Thank you," he replied with a bright smile. "It's really a lot of fun to work with you. You make it very easy."
It wasn't in the script, but Cas rubbed his thumb softly over Dean's cheek before he reluctantly let go. "Um, good. You need to be careful with what you eat."
To say that Cas was surprised by Balthazar's words was the understatement of the century. He would never have thought he would get an apology. Not that it changed three years of betrayal, but it was a lot more than he had gotten before. He shook his head, sighing before he said, "I won't let that affect me working with you, but… three years, Balthazar… I wanted to marry you…"
Castiel stared at Dean, unable to find the words to express how he was feeling. In his wildest dreams he never could have expected to hear that from Dean, and he didn’t realise there was a tear on his cheek until Dean lifted his hand to his face and gently wiped it away.
"You have to ask?" Cas replied with a soft chuckle.
Balthazar nodded. "I look forward to it."
Dean shook his head. “Take me back. Right now.”
Even more peculiar was the fact how much he had liked having sex with Dean. Not that he had a lot of experience in that area, but he was still very sure that what he felt had been extraordinary. Dean was a mystery to him. He could feel something connect, echo in his essence when they were joined.
“I’m sorry that happened to you. Despite being a ‘player’, I think cheating is fucked. And no wonder you don’t date guys.” Dean leaned in close. “What’s your type?”
That was met with an arched brow. "You're lucky you know how to fuck," Dean said before he sucked Castiel's girth into his mouth, hands braced at his hips as he swallowed him down.
Cas's eyes widened. "Dean... why did you push me away?"
Dean chuckled as he leaned back in his chair. “You want me to be honest?”
Cas's heart felt like it was about to jump out of his chest. He couldn't help but smile as he draped the blanket closer around his body, leaning his head against the frosted glass. He just wished he could see Dean now. "I feel the same. I can't believe how well this is going. I... I really wish I could just... meet you in person."
Dean moved to sit next to Cas, flashing him a sad smile. “What’re you doing, Cas?”
"Dean," Cas gasped out as he slid closer. The arms covering his face snaked around Dean's shoulder to hold on. Cas's face was tinted red, his eyes glazed over in lust. It was the first time he’d seen Cas in such a state, and it was breathtaking. "Yes, I can... I can take more."
Cas cleared his throat. "Um, nice people, adventurous, funny. Freckles… What's yours?" he said before drinking half of his beer.
“That’s grand. He’s ready,” she said to demon dee.
As they left the room, Crowley returned to his chair, and waited for the show to begin.
Out of the darkness a shape emerged, a shape that turned into a mirror image of himself.
"Um..." Okay, that was disgusting. “Why would they put up a painting like that? Your brother doesn’t have very weird tastes, that you know of, right?”
Dean chuckled. “Good. And I’m dying to know what this almost porn flick was…”
Charlie touched his shoulder again and the scenery changed. They were in the bunker and Dean was standing in the kitchen next to Eileen and Sam. It looked like they were about to kiss, but Sam pulled away with a sigh. “I can’t. I’m sorry. I… I should try to find Dean. I’m worried about Cas. He hasn’t answered any of my texts.”
"Fuck," Dean hissed, ignoring the fact that he hadn't been lying, that under any other circumstances… He used the momentum to get part of the bind against that rusted metal. He also ignored the fact that all eyes were on Castiel.
“You think you have control of this situation,” Dean said and…
"Ride you and go from there."
Dean grabbed Cas by the elbow and pulled him over to the little loveseat, dropping himself onto it before pulling Cas into the space next to him. He jostled them around, arms and legs creating friction, they were pressed so close. He flashed him a small smile and said, "Then neither will I. Mean girl solidarity and all that."
"Mhh?" Castiel gave him another puppy eyed look as his fingers went to his own mouth, rubbing the wrong side.
And Dean meant it.
He started humming again, but this time it was an actual tune. Then he added some vocals.
"Bad strange?" Dean stopped moving his finger, but he didn't pull it out.
“Try it,” the demon said, stopping perfectly still. He was no longer struggling, just held Crowley’s gaze with an ire that made it even more apparent that he may finally have found
Cas closed his eyes and groaned, his hips angling towards Dean's finger. "Oh, the good feeling is back, Dean."
Cas laughed and nodded, although Dean couldn’t see him. “I’m sure we will get a real drink if we complain to the crew.” He smiled softly as he stood up from the ground. “See you tomorrow, Dean. I’m looking forward to talking to you again.”
“I never get sick like this in Black Beauty,” he complained between heaves.
With a dawning realization, Dean opened his file and looked down. “You, uh… you must be…” As his character took a moment to remember how to pronounce the weird name Bobby said, he simply shrugged and finished, “Sandy.”
Dean chuckled and took a swig of his beer. “And you don’t do no strings, or playboys. Two ships passing in the night, huh?” He held his beer up in salute. “Here’s to friendship, then?”
Cas gasped, his lips parted as his breathing turned faster and more shallow. "Dean... uh, that feels... um... strange."
“I don’t need a new partner, damnit!”
Dean flipped around to face Charlie. “Make him get up. He’s gonna freeze to death.”
"What?" Dean asked, voice dark and dangerous.
Dean scrubbed his hand over his face as he stood over the craft table, willing the keurig to brew faster as he stifled a yawn. They were getting a way too early start to the newest season of
"An adventure." Cas grinned as he crossed his arms on the table and leaned closer. "Aren't you curious what we will get? It's probably disgusting, but maybe we’ll find something unexpected and new that we would never have tried otherwise."
“Maybe we can run lines together,” Dean suggested before he finished his coffee.
Dean furrowed his brow and shook off the weird comment. “I can probably tell you what’s going on. Save us some time.”
Castiel flipped open the file, looked over it for a second before closing it again. "I now know everything that is in the file. We would be quicker if I fly you there."
When Castiel leaned back, his eyes fell on a mark on Dean's forearm. He gasped when he recognized it. "Dean... what have you done?"
Dean let out a soft sigh. “I know. And I’ve come to tell you I’m sorry.”
Dean moved to sit on the bed, almost diagonally from Cas. “Do angels… self-lubricate?” He knew it was probably a stupid question, and he would probably get a grade A bitch face for it, but he had to ask.
“I’ve got a classic car - my baby - and a box full of classic rock tapes, and I love to hit the open road with her. It’s even better when there’s someone in the passenger seat.” Dean hoped Cas understood this as the invitation it was meant to be.
“What’re ye looking so pleased about, Fergus? I only just managed to get out of there by the skin of my teeth. I thought he was going to smite me.”
Cas watched him turn around and walk back to the set, and he needed a few deep breaths to calm his racing heartbeat. He tried to think about something unsexy to will away the almost erection, before he walked back to the set.
demon.
Dean nodded and quietly departed, flashing Cas a look he couldn't decipher before turning and walking away.
Dean looked around and nodded to the painting of an eviscerated calf on the wall behind Cas. "I mean…"
He met a nice woman called Lisa, but she was a little too bland for his tastes. Her son sounded super nice, but… Cas was always the one he kept coming back to.
"Lube. What is that?" Cas asked after a moment, wondering why Dean had parked in front of a pharmacy.
Balthazar barked out a laugh as he approached. "Hiya, Cassie. Long time no see."
There was this decidedly delectable rush Dean felt whenever he wielded the blade, like the build up to the top of a rollercoaster, or the climax of an orgasm. There was a reason lab rats, when given the choice between pleasure and food, starved. Dean wasn’t cocky enough to believe he was somehow better than a rat. Deep down, at the end of the day, every creature shared one thing in common, the penchant to submit to their base, animalistic instincts.
Cas leaned forward to grab the fruity looking cocktail. He wasn't really good at dating, and he really hoped a little alcohol would help him loosen up and relax. "I'm Cas. It's a shortened version of my name. Um, Castiel." He gulped down a very huge amount of that drink before realising it was something with pineapple in it. He grimaced and put it back on the table, grabbing the water to get rid of the taste. "I… I fear I'm not very good at dating," he confessed. "I… I don't know what to ask first. This is such a weird situation."
But he had also lied to him. "So what about now? When you find someone new… Do you tell them?"
The woman inclined her head towards the cage, more specifically, the angel trapped inside. “Him.”
Castiel chuckled, and it was probably the sexiest laugh Dean had ever heard. "Yeah, that will definitely make history then. I'm glad I'm going to be a part of this."
Dean had never taken anything so big before. The angel must have been at least ten inches. A fucking Godzilla dick.
He couldn't argue with that.
"This is not…" Castiel ran to the edge of the cage, slamming his hand against the bars. "Crowley!"
Should he ask Cas again, for real? Was it too soon? Dean discovered that he wasn’t panicking at the thought, even though he should be… surely?
When the moment finally came that the door was about to open and he would finally meet Dean, his heartbeat was out of control. The door slid open in a way too slow pace, and when Cas lifted his head he froze for a second.
His co-star gave him a quick crooked smile. "Um... thanks. It's not really... Look, long story short, I had some experiences in the past with the same gender, and then decided to not ever have anything with a guy ever again."
Dean nodded as he sucked on Castiel's earlobe. "No good having a dengel if it won't survive." He wrapped his legs around Castiel's waist as he hopped into his arms. "When they open the door, we charge." Dean let out a soft groan into his ear.
Dean turned to Crowley and barked, “Take me back already.”
“Someone had the audacity to cheat on you?” Dean asked, sounding genuinely perplexed by the thought.
"Crowley… our captor, is trying to cross our species to create a 'perfect' creature," he explained, using finger quotes to underline his words. "A demon that isn't vulnerable to heavenly light."
Dean extended his arms out with a smirk. "See? Pioneer."
Castiel didn’t reply; instead he smiled and carried on singing, deliberately out of tune.
There was a storm raging inside of him and Castiel thought he was going to be sick. The thought alone that he had sex with a demon…
With the new cue to start the scene, Dean exhaled and started storming into the library, physically bumping into Castiel, as the script instructed.
"I have nothing more to say to you, other than what I already have," Cas growled.
And it wasn’t fair how bad that made Dean feel. Brushing off the strange emotion, he let out another cry of pain. He looked up into fiercely concerned blue eyes. “No, it’s… I’ve never felt this.”
Cas scrubbed his hand over his face, feeling incredibly tense. "Yeah." He knew he needed to get comfortable with the thought of creating a life. He had never wanted that or even thought about it. He was a soldier. He was prepared to die to save the world.
Dean shoved the file at Castiel, pushing it against his chest. "Then how about you read the case file?" He pulled away and whipped out the keys for Dan's iconic Pontiac Firebird Trans AM. "I'll drive."
Charlie sighed. “That would have been the moment Sam would have finally taken a path towards his own happiness. Sadly, he was too worried about you to take that road.”
Cas looked up at her in shock. "You're kidding… What kind of restaurant has things like this on its menu? Is that even legal?"
Before Dean could reply, Castiel thrashed his wings against the bars. “I will rip you into pieces… and I will get out of here.”
Cas shot him a surprised look. “Who is this?”
Stopping himself from laughing at the coincidence, Castiel answered, “Lebanon, Kansas.”
As the head of his cock got swallowed in, Dean couldn’t contain his own gasp. An explosion of pleasure almost whited out his vision. He wanted to tell Cas it wouldn’t change anything, but shit… that simply wasn’t the truth.
The Empty squinted its eyes at him. "No," it replied slowly before it tapped its finger hard against Cas's head. "Because there is nothing you could do that would deter me from my plans to torture you."
There was a beat of silence before he heard, "Uh, Cas? It's Dean."
Dean let out a deep chuckle. “You fucked up,” he said to Crowley, still not moving from his position, seated on Castiel. “When the Bond villain reveals too much in his monologue, it usually leads to his plans getting foiled.”
Whatever power the witch possessed, Dean could tell this angel was beyond powerful. Which meant he was a Seraph, or possibly a higher rank. Dean turned his head, lips grazing across the angel's. "Well, if you're gonna fuck me, at least call me by name," he whispered, "Dean."
There was no harm in trying though, right?
As they held each other's gaze for the script-suggested twenty seconds, Dean said, "Uh, Sandy… we discussed this. Personal space."
“Yeah,” Dean said as he pointed to the screen. “It, uh… it says you should be clean first.”
Cas was really happy to hear that. "I'm very okay with that. And I could really use a boys’ night to clear my head."
His feelings were in chaos. On one hand he really wanted to give in and plan on enjoying his one chance of having sex with Dean; on the other hand... he knew it would make everything more difficult. But when he looked over at Dean, trying to tell him that he wasn't going to enjoy it, he froze. Dean's expression changed his mind, because he couldn't bear to disappoint him. "I... I will try," he said instead.
It was so weird saying it out loud.
Cas shook his head. "No, seriously. Thank you for making me laugh." He shook his head and stared at the ceiling. "Don't worry, I won't let the drama influence my scenes with him, but… I will try to avoid him, so don't be surprised if I don't hang around."
"So instead of going through all your shit together, your answer is to push the person who loves you more than anything in the world, away from you?" she asked before she punched his shoulder. It hurt even though she was an almost transparent ghost.
Dean took a deep breath, trying to get into Dan’s mindset. They were shooting the first meeting between Dan and Sandalphon, the angel character Castiel had been hired to play.
Dean was surprisingly obedient for a partial demon, and quickly moved to all fours, wiggling his ass as though to inspire enticement, action.
“You and me both.” Dean got out of the car and met Cas on the other side before they started making their way toward the entrance. “And we’re gonna have to explain it to Sammy too.” Dean’s eyes widened then and he flashed Cas an insecure expression. “Maybe we should find a motel.”
Castiel melted into the hug, enjoying the way it felt to be held by the man he loved, as he murmured into Dean’s collarbone. “I’m glad to be back. When The Empty threw me out, I landed in Iowa; it’s taken me hours to get here.”
Dean gave him a sidelong glance. “Shit… we probably need to… pick up supplies.”
"Oh, that is really amazing. You two were really lucky then." He smiled as he leaned a little closer. "Tell me about yourself."
“Yeah, okay,” Dean breathed out as he gently pulled his fingers out and slid on top of Cas, waist settling between his best friend’s legs. Dean sank back on his haunches to grab the lube and quickly slick up his dick. He groaned, his dick almost painfully hard.
Cas gave him a barely there smile before he nodded. "Yes, let's go." He touched Dean's shoulder for a second, hoping the action looked like a concerned mother hen, before he started walking up the road.
Charlie shook her head, giving him a sad smile. She touched his shoulder and, like before, the scenery changed for them. He found himself standing at a frozen lake, looking down to a pier. It was snowing, and it was freezing cold.
"Oh, Dean," Cas moaned deeply, his eyes pressed shut. "I... uhhh, I think I'm ready for you."
"I've not thought about sex in general. It doesn't matter for me if it's a man or a woman. I had thought about it when I was human... but no... usually I don't," Cas admitted. A few times he had thought of Dean when he had been human. But it had left him frustrated and sad, because it was something he couldn't have.
Dean nodded and pulled off his jacket, wrapping Cas in that as well. As they made their way through the forest, he was surprised to find Kumail still waiting for him.
Nodding, Sam started walking through the bunker, leading Castiel to the wing where they slept. Stopping at Dean's door, his friend gave him a reassuring smile and rapped his knuckles on the wood.
Cas didn't sound too sure about it, so Dean quickly backtracked. "Nah, I'm only pulling your leg. But, dude… pie. You'll have to let me taste some one day."
"Welcome home, sunshine," Dean uttered in his ear, voice cracking with vulnerability.
“How the hell am I supposed to fix things?”
Cas felt torn. On the one hand he was happy that he only needed to do this... have sex... once. On the other hand... Dean was his best friend. And although Cas's feelings for Dean were deep, he suppressed thinking about him that way. He knew it was something he could never have, because Dean was only interested in women.
I remembered hearing it on Baby’s radio, and you didn’t like it so much either.” He grinned, then put his hand over Dean’s and squeezed it gently.
Dean let out a disgusted scoff. "What? Am I breakfast?"
Merry Christmas, and I love you all. 😘😘
"I..." Cas furrowed his brow. "I have no idea what you're asking of me. Do you want me to google how two men have sexual intercourse?"
Cas gave him a weak smile. "Yeah. I mean, it's not like we have a choice. I really don't want another apocalypse."
Dean smirked. “I’m what’s gonna get you the chance to rip that asshole’s vocal cords out.”
Crowley’s expression turned angry, and when he spoke, he didn’t have that irritating note of confidence in his tone, “You forget that you’re my pets. I hold all the cards, and you will do as I command.”
It felt right. It didn't matter that he had never seen Dean. In their talks he had seen his heart. Sure there was still a lot to discover, but Cas just knew he wanted to be close to Dean and go on this journey of discovery together.
When he turned around he was met with the bluest eyes he had ever seen. A man with messy, raven hair, and a five o'clock shadow framing lips that were just sinful. Blue eyes widened for a moment when he looked at Dean, followed by a surprised hitch of breath.
“Didn’t you get the memo? The Scrooge storyline is tired and should be put to rest with its author.” Dean folded his arms over his chest as he shrugged Crowley off.
Dean let out a nervous laugh and rubbed the back of his neck. “You, uh… you heard that, huh?”
Dean nodded as he reached out for a box of Trojans and then pulled his hand back. "Guess we only need the lube."
"I'm pretty sure that's not a thing," Cas said. He thought about it for a moment, and although he didn't know Vancouver that well, he couldn't imagine there being anything remotely similar to Vegas.
"You can, I friggin' pinky promise, but don't you wanna get outta here?" he breathed out, trying to get the angel to shift him against the door, if Dean could just get some of the bind against the rusted metal of the handle.
The angel seemed to hesitate for a second before he suddenly jumped Dean, and grabbed his throat in an iron grip, pinning him against the metal bars. He nudged his nose against Dean's cheek and inhaled deeply. "Human," he whispered hotly before he licked over Dean's cheek.
He rubbed his hand over his neck and looked out of the window. "Yes," he breathed out after a moment. "Angels don't have a gender as you know... We can't reproduce with our own kind, but with a human... it's different. I have full control over the process. When we have... sex... I can choose to take your seed inside of my essence, my grace will mingle with your soul, giving it the power to create a new soul inside of my essence."
The moment they left the abandoned warehouse, where they had been held, Castiel squeezed his hand. “Tell me where to. I’ll fly us.”
Dean stared at him. “This is your fault.”
As young Dean pulled out a string of Trojans, Dean cringed as his doppelganger said,
“Oh, um, yes. I… I really hope I can make one for you.” Dean couldn’t be sure but Cas almost sounded a little disappointed. “Um, Dean… so there is something else I wanted to ask you. About the whole marriage thing… It’s a big commitment. This isn’t just a dating show. They really want people to get engaged, unseen and… what are your thoughts about that?”
“You’re creating the perfect offspring for me, aren’t you?” Crowley’s voice was filled with glee at the prospect, and Castiel was itching to turn him into a smoldering pile of ashes. “I knew this would work.”
Dean stepped aside to let Castiel into the room, and he sat himself in the chair opposite Dean’s bed.
“I promise I’m not going anywhere. And, I don’t think The Empty would take me back, even if it was possible.” The memory of The Empty’s face as Castiel sang to it was one he wouldn’t forget in a long time, and he got the feeling it wouldn’t forget either.
What possessed him, Dean would probably never know, but he grabbed Cas’s hand and held it. Taking his cue from Charlie’s suggestion, he said, “I’m sorry that I put my grief before yours. I’m sorry I tried to kill our son. And I’m sorry I made you think that you aren’t one of the most important people in my life.”
Somehow this angel could replicate that sensation, that deliciously addictive sensation.
Dean chuckled, ignoring how good his co-star smelled, and whispered back, “I don’t think there’s anything you can do.”
Dean braced an elbow next to Cas as he took himself in hand and made his way forward. His heart was hammering against his chest. This was it. He and Cas were about to cross a line.
As Dean was about to reply, Castiel grasped him by the shoulder and he widened his eyes right before Charlie yelled, "Cut!"
"Still, thanks," Dean said, flashing Cas a hint of a smile, a quick up turn of the lips.
“I just wanted to get back here and see you. Both of you.” Castiel smiled at Dean, relieved that he didn’t seem to be upset about the ‘I love you’. “I think you’ll like the story of how I got out.”
Cas gave him a look like a puppy caught pissing on the rug. "I'm really sorry for this. I promise I will try to pay more attention and concentrate on my mission. I... think it... was because this was my first time having sex... with you and it was... it felt a lot better than I anticipated."
I just noticed that I write "mugglerock and I" a lot cuz for me it feels like we are one unit. lol. So just a few quick words to my writing partner: We started writing in 2016 and since then we accomplished so much together. My word count on ao3 is at 2285506 now and it's all because you found me and kindly offered your time to help me out as a beta. Which quickly resorted into us writing together and also quickly spoiled me soooooo much that it's just super hard to write on my own now. I love you, my little creative muse, demon and partner in crime.
Castiel bit down on his lower lip. "Sit down… Maybe… I didn't hurt you the last time?" There was a shadow of guilt on Castiel's face.
Dean's eyebrows shot up, and when his brother flashed him a bemused look, he waved him off. "You gonna take him up on it?"
They hadn’t spoken in a couple of weeks, and Dean couldn’t stop himself from approaching Cas. As he reached out to grab the guy’s shoulder, his hand went through him, like Dean was a ghost too.
“I’d say I watched it for the plot, but those cowboy boots…” Dean had no idea why he was telling Cas his secrets like this, but it was surprisingly easy to talk to the guy. Plus, if he kept him talking, he’d get to hear more of that deep, gravelly voice.
He wasn't sure why he suddenly reacted with amusement seeing Dean's playful side. Castiel licked over his own fingers, spreading Dean's cheeks apart with the other hand before he circled his hole. When he pressed two fingers inside he could feel that Dean was still filled from their first time.
"Yeah..." Cas swallowed dryly, his heart skipping a few beats. "I... I'm afraid, Dean. I don't know anything about raising a human child."
Castiel shrugged, looking slightly uncomfortable. "It's just an acting job. I mean, I also played a serial killer once... you know? And it’s not…" He shook his head. “It’s not completely outside of my sexuality,” he added quietly.
Charlie stepped beside him. "He’s paralyzed. Everything on his mind is about you."
As he pulled away, just a fraction, Dean whispered, "Cas, please tell me you're here to stay. No more deals. No more sacrifice. No more leaving me behind. Please-" His voice broke, and he licked at his bottom lip, breath catching.
In an almost dazed, hypnotized state, Dean nodded and worked in a third digit. His own erection leaking, smearing against Cas’s hip.
Cas froze. He couldn't believe it. He had no idea Balthazar had a job on this show. He had hoped he would never see him again. Cas squinted his eyes at him. "Not long enough if you ask me."
"Ready for what?" Dean demanded, the Mark aching with his need to kill.
On the far side of the cage huge black wings were spread out against the metal bars. Fucking angel wings! They belonged to a bare chested angel, his head hanging low, leaving Dean only with the sight of a messy mop of dark raven hair, and a hint of five o'clock shadow along a strong jawline.
“How about we each say ten things about ourselves?” Dean’s voice asked, then continued without waiting for a response. “I’ll start. My parents are both dead, so my family consists of my annoying little brother, Sam.”
Dean moaned outright, sucking Castiel’s bottom lip between his teeth before diving in for another kiss. He liked kissing, but this was… on a different level. The sensations reached deep, causing the Mark to tingle.
She was powerful. Too powerful.
A hearty and deeply attractive laugh came from Dean’s pod. “No way! Sam forced me to be here too. He said he was fed up with my whining. Can you believe that?”
Cas raised his arms in defense. "Um, no. Why? Have you been a notorious bad boy?"
"Oh." Castiel nodded, taking another sip of his coffee with a low moan. "That I can work with. My last director was a serious asshole. I had a female partner and he was such a sexist prick. Every day I wanted to punch his dumb face."
"Well… word then," Cas said. "And I do care what you think. I want you to be my friend."
His eyes suddenly flashed to a very human green and he straightened his stance. "Buddy, you picked the wrong guy for whatever
Not anymore.
Cas couldn't help but nod. He had seen the situation and he knew Naomi was right in her assessment. "I agree, but why would you kidnap Sam? If you’ve found a solution to fix this… of course I would help." Especially because Cas felt partially responsible for this mess. He had killed a lot of angels.
Cas groaned and kept on kissing him in desperation, and on instinct Dean reached between them, starting to stroke Cas's velvety, hard erection. It didn't need much to push Cas over the edge, making him come all over Dean's hand.
Immediately Castiel let go of the iron bars, next to him in a matter of seconds. His face was contorted with worry as he grabbed Dean's shoulder. "Dean, are you alright?"
"You think Sam won't approve of it?" Cas asked in surprise. Now Dean had added an extra worry to his plate. What if it caused a fight between the brothers? He didn't want to be the reason for that.
Charlie's image flickered before she disappeared and Dean was back, standing next to his car.
Dean didn’t know what Sam was thinking when he’d put Dean’s name down for this ridiculous dating show. He’d grumbled something about “I’m sick of your whining about being single, and you’re doing this whether you like it or not. Okay?”
She was wearing her usual nerdy clothes, but was wearing a colorful flower crown. She held up her fingers, making the vulcan greeting. “Hey, Dean.”
“Dean,” he whispered, leaning into Dean’s touch as their eyes locked.
“Sex with a guy? Have you, uh… thought about it?”
"But..." Cas shook his head. "Why did you have sex with them? If you didn't love them. I thought what we had… was a very fulfilling sex life. Or did… didn't you like it with me?"
"We need the energy of a nephilim. A strong one," Naomi explained. "You're our strongest seraph left… and Dean is the Righteous Man. We need a nephilim created by the two of you."
Dean shrugged. “Or just… how to have gay sex. Seems shorter.”
Castiel remembered one Christmas when he’d switched the radio to a station that was only playing Christmas songs. When
Cas clinked his bottle against Dean's. "To friendship… that might soon be over." He chuckled as he noticed the waitress coming, balancing their order on her arms.
"I love you, Castiel." Fingers intertwined with his, and Dean squeezed his hand.
“I would say likewise, but I’m still in shock, I think. I didn’t think I would see you again.”
Balthazar Fèvre as the angel Raziel
"I wasn't dating him. None of those men meant anything to me."
Getting to know this side of Dean... it would be torture.
Castiel laughed at that. “I actually hadn’t thought about the impact that could have before you just mentioned it. It’s not the first time I’ve played a gay man. But the other show I was on wasn’t a prime time soap, and also, it was full of gay characters. So, I was just one of many."
"Well, when you lose a great guy…"
“Shit, sorry, I…” and Dean stopped dead, finding it not even a little difficult to act like he was in awe of the beauty in front of him.
Cas looked up at him like a deer caught in the headlights. “Yes, much better.” Cas bent his knee so that it was easier for Dean to reach him. “I don’t know why.”
“There ever a reason they open the cage?” Dean asked as he picked up a handful of ash.
Even Crowley sucked in a breath at that. "Brutal, my friend. I may have always favored you over your brother, but even I would have been appalled at that bit of delivery, right there."
“Let me make this
"Yeah," Dean said as he grabbed a couple of bags of chips and a six pack of beer as well. At Cas's bemused head tilt, Dean shrugged and said, "For after."
That was met with a deep groan as Dean reached his other hand back and doubled down on his ministrations on Castiel's wings. "Won't take long," he groaned.
Her deep green body length dress hugged her so tight that Dean wondered if it was another type of restraint. Somehow, despite the dress, she stood up as he was dragged forward.
“Shit, man,” Dean breathed out through a laugh. “This should be nothing, right? Considering everything we’ve had to face down.”
Wide blue eyes, a genuine deer caught in the headlights look, was not distracting enough for Dean to not catch Castiel licking over his own lips, giving him a light, embarrassed smile. "Um, thanks," he murmured before he followed Dean to the set.
he read out loud. "That could be good, right?"
"Cassie, don't be like that. It's been a year now. Don't tell me you're still pining for me?"
"Sure, that would be helpful." He stepped closer to Dean, right into his personal space. "You didn't answer my question. Is the coffee any good? Because I really had a rough night."
He felt the way the fabric ripped, which means he must have gotten one of the sigils. The spellwork released the strangle hold with an almost yawn of an exhale. Dean shook his arms out and started unraveling the fabric. He pushed himself to his feet, and held the douche-nozzle’s gaze. “But you don’t,” he said as he held the binds loose in his hand.
Dean flashed him a small smile. "Good. Ready for our next scene?"
His face was etched in sorrow as he ignited the timber, then stepped back to stand next to Eileen. She took his hand in hers, as tears fell down his cheeks. “Goodbye, Dean. I hope you’re at peace now.”
The tweedles would be coming in in three minutes. It was clockwork. The only difference today was the witch was nowhere in sight.
Cas nodded before he sighed. "I will need your help finding a man, Dean. I need you to be my ‘wingman'." Dean had offered to be his wingman so often, and Cas had never been interested. But now… he needed a sexual partner to prevent the end of the world.
Castiel rolled his eyes. If he had needed any confirmation that Dean was a demon, that would have been it. "I have no intention of having sex with you again. I'm talking about our escape from this cage," he whispered, hoping the camera wasn't picking up anything, and it looked like he was sexually interested in the demon.
Dean pulled out his cellphone and drew it to his ear. The beat of silence that passed heightened the tension in the hunter's shoulders. And then he visibly relaxed, lips curling in a relieved smile. "Sammy. You okay?" He nodded and said, "Yeah, we'll explain when we get home."
Cas is speaking Russian again. Dean mentally curses – because if Cas’s voice is something Dean can get off on, it’s probably going to happen when he’s speaking in a foreign language. Dean definitely has a kink (or well, he’s got several, but this is one he knows about), and Dean’s
his brain unhelpfully supplied.
“I sang him a Christmas song. Apparently he didn’t like it.” Castiel watched the confusion spread over Dean’s face.
Dean didn’t waste a second. He pulled out his cellphone and put in for a Lyft. After getting a driver to agree to pick him up at the nearest cross street, he made his way down the road.
Dean shrugged. "Why not?"
Castiel tapped Dean’s shoulder a second later with a growled, “The witch teleported away.”
Dean nodded. "Why doesn’t it surprise me you have a big heart?"
(See the end of the chapter for
"What? No hugs or kisses, Squirrel? It's like you haven't missed me at all."
Cas started to squirm on the bed, covering his eyes with his arms as he pressed his lips together. Dean wasn't sure if he was in pain or if he was holding back expressing the pleasure it might bring him.
He could practically see the moment it clicked. Fucking finally. Castiel rolled his eyes before he nodded tersely. “Crowley!” he yelled again towards the door before he wrapped Dean in his arms. “I’m ready,” he whispered in Dean’s ear.
Cas stared at Dean, his eyes never leaving his as he slowly nodded and breathed out, "Yeah... but, Dean... please go slow."
He could hear Dean saying he was being taken outside too, so Cas followed the crew member through the corridor to another door, where he was asked to wait. A cameraman and another member from the crew, who had interviewed him on several occasions, asked him a few questions about how he was feeling, but it was hard to concentrate on the conversation when all his mind was filled with Dean, and the sheer amount of emotions running wild through his body in that moment.
When Dean settled into the driver’s seat and started the engine, he braced his arm along the backrest and looked at Cas. “So… how’s this whole thing gonna work?”
Dean licked his lips as he started working a second finger inside Cas. "Like this?"
"Me too."
this guy was all kinds of cute. “You know what, this is the best date I’ve been on in years.”
“You could still do with an attitude adjustment.” Billie crossed her arms and gave him a withering glare. “Maybe an eternity in the Ma’lak box would have helped you consider your actions.”
“Now!” Dean barked out. “Trace his cell phone and text me his location.”
Dean let out a scoff. “Guess that makes me the bitch.” He drew even closer, looking at the bars Castiel was slowly breaking down. “Any luck?”
Well, Cas wasn’t messing around, was he? Straight to the point. Dean thought for a moment, wondering if he should go with something cheesy like ‘someone to share my hopes and dreams, and long walks in the moonlight’, or just be honest and be himself.
And oh, that octave sent a shiver down Dean's spine. "Gotta give respect to earn it, cupid."
And there it was. The patented bitch face. "No, my body is like a normal human male body, Dean. Except that I don’t need to bother with food and other things to maintain it.”
"All I could think of after The Empty took you was how there was going to be this hole inside me without you. Every time I've lost you, it's like you take my heart with you." Dean knelt in front of him and leaned in, pressing their foreheads together. "I'm just better with you, Cas. I don't know if I'm all those things you said, but I want to be. I want to be the man you see when you look at me. I want to be worthy of you."
Dean flashed a smirk in their captor’s direction. “What he said.”
“Shit,” Dean breathed out, “Lube? I… have no idea. Maybe you can, uh… look it up?”
Cas was in Kansas, and his location was somewhere close to a lake. When Kumail pulled up in his land rover, Dean held out a wad of cash and said, “How much to drive me to a Walmart and then another location?”
“You okay, Cas?” Dean asked, but he didn’t stop moving, he started to pick up the pace instead, his hard cock now dragging along Cas’s bare hip.
Suddenly Cas gasped out, his hips rocking up on Dean's finger. "Oh," Cas groaned as he gave Dean a wide eyed look. "That... that felt good."
“For some reason, I miss you too, Boris.”
future.” Billie waved her hand and they were no longer by the side of the road.
He wasn't sure how to interpret Dean's expression until he started speaking. "I love you, too. I felt so hollow, knowing I'd never get to see you again. Knowing I never had the balls to tell you…" Dean rubbed his hands on his pants legs. "Look, I know I've been in fucking Narnia, but I'm not gonna risk it again. We lose each other too much, and I don't want another minute passing with you thinking I don't always want you at my side."
Dean remembered this. It was right after he found out Sammy was plugging that bitch Ruby.
With a quick goodbye, and a promise to bring pizza, Dean disconnected the call with his brother and turned to Cas. "Naomi kept her end of the deal."
"Of course," Cas replied immediately, feeling relieved and happy about Dean's answer. "I would like to have another date with you tomorrow."
“You’re right. That probably would have been the better option. I get it, okay? My best friend is gonna die, and I… I can’t let that happen.” Dean rifled a hand through his hair. “Stupid Scrooge message received. Please, Billie. Take me back.”
Cas nodded. "I won't fail."
In all his life he had never experienced a kiss like that. The angel licked inside of Dean's mouth, plundering as if he needed Dean to breathe. His whole body tingled in pleasure as the angel seemed to know the exact way to make his body sing, starting to fuck him harder and faster, driving his big, hard cock even deeper.
Dean swallowed dryly as he read the next step. He turned in the chair to face Cas. “I, uh… stretch you. With my fingers.”
Cas licked over his own lips as he walked past Dean. "That works for m–"
Castiel nodded before he raised his eyebrow at Dean. "I would like that."
"You said before that sex between two men isn't that different from sex between a man and a woman. And you have a lot of experience with that. Can't you just apply that knowledge?" Cas asked after a moment, feeling frustrated that he couldn't contribute.
“Sir, we’ve captured a new demon.”
But first they needed to get out.
"I sure don't! That's what makes it an adventure."
Five cars and two trucks ignored his waving, before a car stopped next to him.
When the world stopped spinning, he was back in the bunker. It could be any number of incidents here. And that’s when he saw Cas. Dressed in a hoodie and jeans, making love to a microwave burrito.
"Well, when you put it like that…" Dean chuckled and patted Cas's knee. "And get it right.
Dean started to laugh out loud as he leaned back to look at him. "Cas, I really hate to say it, but..." He chuckled and shook his head in obvious amusement. He looked really happy, relieved, and almost hopeful. "This song might have just become my new favorite Christmas song."
Cas couldn't believe it. Was he really trying to change? "Because of me?" he whispered.
He missed Dean’s smile and his silly jokes, the references Castiel hardly ever got, riding in Baby while Dean sang loudly and enthusiastically.
Balthazar's eyes raked over Cas's form in apparent appreciation. "It's been really good seeing you again."
bullshit you’re spouting.”
Cas seemed to be aware now of his state of undress, and he looked away with a shy expression before he slowly approached the bed. He swallowed visibly before he turned around on all fours, staring at the blanket under him as if it was the most interesting thing. "Um, like this?"
Dean swallowed Cas’s whimper as he continued to kiss him. He stroked Cas until the last pulse painted them both. As Dean drew back for a moment, in an attempt to catch his breath, he couldn’t help but look at Cas in amazement. “Fuck,” Dean breathed out through a laugh.
Castiel gave him a puppy dog look that took his breath away. "Are you sure?"
"I know just the place," he said as he pressed a quick kiss to Castiel's lips. It was hidden. And large. And had countless bedrooms. Which meant lots of places to fuck.
Crowley grinned and shook his head at the demon. “Oh, I don’t think so. I think you’re perfect, and if you’re not… all there’ll be is a scorch mark on the floor.” He really hoped that that wouldn’t happen again, but he wasn’t about to admit it.
He pulled back just enough to be able to look into Castiel's eyes, then shook his head. "Y'know, never mind. You're here. That's what's important."
With an eye roll, Dean turned away from Bobby and Charlie yelled cut. After they situated the new setup, changing the camera angle to catch “Dan” walking into the library, Dean winked at Castiel before he assumed his serious face.
Dean gently patted his cheek and took a step back. "I can respect that."
Cas's lips were parted and he was breathing fast, before he bit hard down on his lower lip, stifling a suppressed moan. A tear ran over his cheek that he blinked away before he grabbed Dean's biceps with both hands to hold onto him. "Dean... oh... you're so big."
Cas needed a few moments to understand what Naomi was insinuating. "You're asking us to create a child just to give it up for Heaven?"
His new co-star held out his hand with a smirk. "Nice to meet you."
In the end it took closer to twelve hours, and it was two a.m. when he finally arrived. Five different people had stopped and driven him a few miles, and he’d also walked some of the way too. By the time he knocked on the door he was exhausted, but delighted to be back.
He still had one eye on the angel, who seemed to be frozen in place. Now that the guy was free of whatever spell had been cast on him, Dean hoped Castiel wouldn’t decide to attack him. The angel was staring at him, his massive wings twitching, and clearly if Dean made one wrong move, it was over.
Cas's heart skipped several beats and it was hard to catch his breath. Was this crazy? Was he really agreeing to marry someone he had never met? Just from the connection he was feeling? His brain screamed at him for being crazy, but his heart was so much louder.
“Are you saying I’m annoying?” Castiel put on a fake offended expression and shook his head, before smiling at Dean.
But this time Dean had registered as a human by his instincts. Castiel squinted his eyes at Dean and he could clearly see a human side in that demon. It was all very peculiar.
Cas had to laugh at that. "A boys’ night?"
"You know kissing number one's ass won't get you a raise, right?" An almost infuriatingly familiar accent rang out.
"I don't see why not." Cas replied with a shrug. "He, um, apologized and explained everything to me. Things I didn't know. And he said he hasn't dated anyone since we broke up... so maybe I should give him a second chance."
Cas gave him a confused look over his shoulder. "You want me to turn around? Did I do it wrong?"
"Are you sure, Dean? Because there's one more featuring yours truly," the black-clothed jerk said, small smirk gracing his smug face.
Dean released his grip on Cas’s ass. “Look, I know we have to do this, but I… I don’t want to if you aren’t even… a little okay with it.”
He and Dean would create a life together, a person. Someone they would love. Someone who would change their lives in a massive way.
had started playing, Dean had screamed something about Whamageddon and turned it off.
Cas swallowed visibly, his gaze settling back on Dean's eyes with hesitation. "Why are you here?"
Maybe it was the fact all he could hear was the
The angel dragged his lips over Dean’s cheek towards his lips, before he softly bit his lower lip, licking over it to soothe the bite. Castiel groaned deeply and Dean could feel a second finger pushing into him. “Breeding… Spell,” he gasped into Dean’s ear. “Can’t stop… myself, human.”
Crowley smirked. "Still cranky when you're sleepy. Good to know some things never change." The former King of Hell and current pain in his ass, approached and casually slung an arm over his shoulders. "We're going to revisit some of your greatest hits, Dean Winchester. Hold on, it's going to be a bumpy ride."
"Of course!" Cas said, feeling a lot better now. He had a feeling that Dean didn't really approve of him going out for coffee with Bee. Maybe when he had some time alone with Dean he could explain his reasoning better, but with Sam and the whole crew standing around, he didn't want to get too deep into his personal life.
“It’s fine, Cas,” Dean said, voice monotone. Because the reality was Dean was damn happy this wasn’t going to be the last time they had sex.
He was done with romance. Although he missed it.
The charming smile was back on Castiel's face. "No, don't worry about that. It has never been a problem before. And I did that gay 'can't believe it was not porn' thing after my decision. So, I'm good."
He could hear Cas's breathing hitching before he said, "Burgers make me very happy. And I love music in general. Classic rock and classical music the most. I... I... this is a surprise."
"Don't ask stupid questions. Of course I am," Castiel growled into his ear. "How do we get them to open the door?"
"Cas?" Dean whispered it, like a prayer, then looked quickly at Sam before shifting his gaze back to Castiel.
Castiel knew he had been rough, but knowing now that Dean wasn't human, he wasn't worried about that anymore.
Dean looked impressed. "That right? What was it? The petty whiny complaining? The vomiting? The insistence on personal space when most of the time…" Dean said as he stepped close to Cas, "Dan's the one invading the personal space first?"
Castiel wasn't sure where Dean was going with this. He had thought the plan was to tell Crowley they had been successful, so he would open the door. He nudged Dean, giving him a questioning look, hoping he would get it.
When the little plastic mug filled with the caramel macchiato pod, he drew it to his lips and gently blew before he took his first sip. Dean groaned and closed his eyes.
There was a gentle summer breeze carding through his hair as he shrugged out of his black leather jacket, folding it over his arm when Dean and him walked along the pier to a restaurant that Dean had said was new and he wanted to try out. The sun was hanging low in the sky, painting everything in red colors, seagulls flying over them, screeching at each other. The light was highlighting Dean’s freckles and the golden flecks in his green eyes. He was really attractive and Cas knew he was crushing hard on his co-star. That guy ticked all of his boxes.
“Yeah. You, uh… want me to come in with you?” Dean visibly swallowed.
A couple of moments of silence followed, before Dean spoke up again. “I’m a mechanic. I like getting my hands dirty.” Cas could practically sense the eye waggle that accompanied that statement.
Swallowing the lump in his throat, he said those words again, but this time with more feeling. “Cas, will you marry me?”
“Cool. And hopefully there’ll be less pineapple next time.”
“Sammy’s got his own car now… some hybrid thing.” He shuddered at the thought. “So yeah, it’s mostly just me and my music.”
Damnit, now Dean really did feel bad. To stop himself from breaking his cover, he captured Castiel's lips in a kiss.
Cas whimpered and bit his lower lip, his body tensing under him. "That… is… uncomfortable."
“What about Crowley?” Castiel asked as he intertwined their fingers.
The tweedle demons came in, on the freakin’ second. Dean groaned even louder, rocking back and forth for good measure.
When Dean was out of earshot, Balthazar stepped closer. "Look, all I wanted to say is that I'm sorry how things ended. I was never brave enough to come out to you as poly, and I should have done that from the beginning. I just hope you can forgive me and that we can get along on this gig."
Chuck seriously had no imagination. “Billie. Isn’t Death being the Ghost of Christmas Future cliche?”
"Kinda? Every chick I've had anal with, was… uh… already ready, you know?"
"Yeah," Dean said as he nodded, bringing his lube drenched digit to Cas's hole. The heat radiating was intense. Inviting. He gently started rubbing the lube over the puckered flesh.
There were moments in his life where he wondered what it was that he found so endearing about Dean. He gave him a long look before he dryly replied, "No." He sighed as he scrunched up his nose, trying to explain it to Dean, "My vessel won't be affected by it.  It's me who will get..." He looked down, having a hard time wrapping his head around everything. He had never thought that he would create a life; it was incredibly daunting.
Dean narrowed his eyes at the demon-ghost-whatever-pain-in-the-ass. “What’s your point?”
Dean Winchester as Daniel (Dan) Losechester
Bobby Singer as Bernie Dancer
"What about me?" Cas asked, before he looked out of the window.
Cas couldn't help but chuckle. Dean was really funny. "I wish." He pursed his lips and sighed, leaning against the table. "He was my last boyfriend. One I bought a ring for… And on the day I wanted to ask him to marry me, I found out he had been cheating on me basically throughout our entire relationship."
Castiel tried to focus on the human side. Something must have happened to that man, because he clearly had been human at some point. This wasn't a possession.
"As you wish," he relented, whisking him back to Baby's side. "I truly do miss you, Squirrel." Brushing a wispy hand over Dean's cheekbone, he added, "Give my love to the queen."
Dean smirked, hating the warmth he felt from the gesture. "Didn't anyone tell you revenge is a dish best served cold?"
It made his heart jump, which was the strangest sensation. He hadn’t felt something like that since…
Dean couldn’t believe what he was hearing. He didn’t really know why Cas wanted him, but he felt exactly the same.
The tingle of an almost electrical connection, Dean was briefly overwhelmed, and as he delved deeper into the kiss, he could feel the coiling of pleasure. Dean moaned into Cas’s mouth before it turned into a whimper and he came, filling Cas with each shuddered pulse.
“Can I kiss you, Cas?”
“Fine,” Dean growled as he snatched the file out of his hands. “Where is he?”
Cas smiled brightly at him before he leaned forward and drew Dean into a tight hug. One he really needed in that moment. He pressed his face against Dean's throat, inhaling his aftershave with a soft hum.
Cas forgot everything around them, lost every thought in his mind. His lips tingled from the contact and it just felt like they were made for each other, his body perfectly fitting in Dean's arms. "Dean," he murmured breathlessly. "I can't wait to spend the rest of my life with you."
Cas was tense under him, his body trembling softly, his voice almost a growl, "Well, the goal is for you to have an orgasm inside of me, so that shouldn't be a problem."
for you, Dean.” Charlie grinned as she lifted her arms. “I’m the Ghost of Christmas Present, and I’m here to show you what’s going on right now. Just without any muppets.“
"I apologize," Cas gasped out. "I have never done this before."
There went those damn butterflies again, but if Cas wanted to know about him, he might as well start at the beginning. "My mom died when I was young, and my dad, he… he couldn't handle the grief. He hit the bottle pretty hard, and-" he stopped himself before he started talking about something more painful. "And I... well, I raised Sam myself. I know I give him shit, but he's a good kid. Smart, like you."
"Please, Cas," Balthazar stepped closer, followed by damnable puppy eyes. "It's important."
"How do you know where to touch me?" Castiel wondered out loud as one of his hands slid around Dean's throat, the other down to Dean's erection. The head was wet from precum and Castiel used his fingers to spread it over the satiny flesh before starting to stroke him at a measured pace.
Sam Winchester as Simon Losechester
Cas whimpered softly under him, but it sounded more lustful than distressed. His arms slid up around Dean's neck as he looked up at him. "Is it good for you?" he asked, sounding insecure. "Do you think you're able to come inside of me?"
"I don't have a phone," Castiel replied before he started to fuck him even harder, pushing Dean’s legs higher and further apart. Dean was completely at the angel’s mercy as he rammed his cock even deeper.
He rubbed the back of his hand over his cheek to wipe away the tears before he opened the door for Dean, letting him in. He quickly closed the door behind him again. Just in case.
Dean shook his head as he stepped out of Baby, seeing as sliding off the road into a ditch from the black ice meant he wasn’t going anywhere, anytime soon. Dean rubbed his forehead, feeling for any head injuries as he approached the alive looking former King of Hell.
"Money." Castiel shrugged before giving him another smirk. "You still haven't told me why that one director is not nice." He took a sip from his coffee, a low moan rivaling a porn star falling from his lips. "Oh, this is just what I needed."
Sam shook his head. “Just… just stay here, alright?” He left Eileen alone in the kitchen, and Dean could see the worry lines on Sam’s face.
The words were caught in his throat, so instead of answering, he grasped Cas’s hand again and squeezed. He finally managed to nod.
Castiel stepped in closer, right into his personal space. And fuck, he really smelled good. There was fire in his eyes, an authority and strength that almost made Dean believe Castiel could smite him. "You should show me some respect, boy."
Could he really be this lucky?
“Fuck, fuck…” Dean shivered from the way the pleasure made the Mark throb. “My address then,” he gasped out as he succumbed to the brutal fucking. If he’d known angels fucked like this...
Cas couldn't help the chuckle that escaped his lips. "I think... our child will be in safe hands." He sighed and looked out of the window, the trees swaying and blurred, a rhythm in time with his thoughts. It was all a lot to take in, and Cas tried to concentrate on the here and now instead of the would be’s and if’s.
Cas looked back at the picture skeptically before his gaze returned to Dean. "He’s a vegetarian and eats in a restaurant with a painting of a murdered cow?"
Dean pursed his lips, an attempt to contain the smile threatening to come out. It was a helluva compliment. “So, uh… do we need to do it again?”
She waved her hand once more, and the scene changed again. They were standing in a clearing next to a funeral pyre. A body wrapped in cloth was lying on top of it, and Sam was holding a lighter ready in his hand while Eileen stood back, watching.
“Sammy traced your cell phone,” he answered simply as he leaned over to turn Cas’s attention back to him with a gentle grasp at his chin.
Dean shrugged as he leaned back against the couch. "Gambling, strippers, a
Dean quirked his brow. If the bastard who put him here was another one of those collectors… He shuddered at the memory, causing demon dum to yank him upright. They brought him to a stop right in front of the woman. “You gonna give me my nice, shiny collar?”
And then the angel began to perk up.
The heated look Castiel was giving him, showed him that at least on some level he still seemed to have control. He pulled out his fingers and used them to spread Dean’s cheeks, lining up his cock. Dean could feel a very big blunt and slick head probing at his entrance before Castiel pushed it in slowly, and with a deep groan.
Dean took a taste of each cocktail, and yep… there was pineapple in every one. He couldn’t help chuckling before he answered Cas’s question. “Yeah, and I’m not really a fan. I’d prefer a nice cold beer.”
"I have a night shoot Friday, so go for Saturday?" Dean said as he opened the trailer door for Cas.
The smile he received for that was beautiful. "Yeah, thanks. I would like that."
“Oh, don’t be so dramatic, mother.” Crowley rolled his eyes, and leaned back in his chair. “Now, I need a tracking spell. We’ve got some fugitives to catch.”
Because… fuck. Dean really liked it.
Cas hummed as he found that the first picture on the site was a cherry. "Considering popping the cherry," he read, wondering if he clicked the wrong link, because its content looked fruit related. He squinted his eyes as he read further. The author had written about sexual identity, which wasn't particularly interesting to Cas because that wasn't what he was looking for. He was looking for a manual. "First things first: Make sure you can easily and safely access medical treatment. That may mean waiting until you’re eighteen." It was the first one of the tips he read aloud. He looked up at Dean. "I think that one doesn't really apply to us."
"I'm trying, okay? It's not exactly easy," Cas grunted back, sounding a bit pissed, but at the same time nervous.
Cas couldn't help but laugh again. "He is the life of the party, do you really want to trade that for me being a sad heap of broken heart shards?"
“Shit, man. I’m sorry.” Dean was weirdly excited at… the thought of trying something like this, and Cas was just… not even wanting to be there. It was fucked. “I haven’t had sex in a while, so it probably won’t last long.”
Naomi shook her head. "I'm not a monster. Your child would only need to visit Heaven and donate her energy. The child would be human after that. I promise no harm will come to your child."
He hated how perfect Dean was in every other category. Maybe Balthazar being here was a good reminder of his promise to himself. To not date another guy.
The bark of laughter that earned was sharp. "Pity."
And then Dean realized he was probably wording the search badly. When he typed, “how-to prepare for anal,” finally some actual guides popped up. “Finally,” Dean breathed out and opened the first link.
Dean rubbed at his shoulder and sighed. “Like I said. He left. I didn’t kick him out.”
Dean let out a surprised laugh. “The best fucking Lyft driver in the country apparently.” He opened the back passenger door for Cas and climbed in on the other side. “I can’t thank you enough for waiting, Kumail.”
"Shit." Dean shook his head. "Then I guess we're making a baby announcement when we get home."
Balthazar didn't even flinch, but Dean's brow quirked.
“Me too, Cas… me too.” Dean’s voice sounded light and hopeful. “If my other ‘dates’ go as well as this, I’ll eat my hat.”
Realising he should probably say something about the other stuff Cas mentioned, he quickly added, "Sorry about your childhood though. That sounds rough."
Cas looked down at them before his eyes met Dean's. "Your semen is on my leg. Please hold on until you're inside of me."
And in a blur of images and color, Dean was back, next to Baby, trying to get his stomach to stop lurching. When he looked up, Crowley was gone and Dean couldn’t contain the sigh. He let out a mirthless laugh.
Castiel had been consigned to The Empty once before - no, twice - and it was just as dark and filled with nothingness then as it was now. He wanted to get out of there just as much this time, even though he’d just confessed his love to Dean and didn’t know if Dean felt the same.
He was squinting his eyes as if he was in pain, before he growled deeply and stalked towards Dean. "Demon," the angel growled, his voice sounded like he had gargled with rocks.
Cas nodded under his arm before he gasped, "Yeah, it just feels... so... unexpectedly good." A quick look at Cas's erection told him his angel was enjoying this. He was finally hard.
"Dean? Dean, you awake?" There was a muffled sound that could have been a groan or, more likely knowing Dean, cursed insults. "Dean, I know you need some space, but this is important."
“Hello, Sam. It’s good to see you.” Castiel hugged him back, then pulled away slightly to watch his reaction. “Is-is Dean here? Is he okay?”
"You're proud of him," Cas replied softly, "And managing that... I think you should be proud of yourself, too."
Cas gave him a wry smile. "Put 'way too trusting' on top of it, and you get the perfect idiot that keeps falling for other people's bullshit. Like, 'I had a late work night' or 'I was just out with my mates'."
When Kumail pulled up to the stretch of road that came to a dead end at the mouth of a small forest beside the lake, Dean handed him the wad of cash and clapped him on the shoulder. “Thanks for everything.”
“Wait,” Billie said, pointing towards Sam.
"Oh, that's... um, good then." Cas swallowed dryly, looking away from Dean. It had looked painful in the video, and for some reason, he felt even more nervous and terrified of everything ahead now. "Can we buy that here?"
Cas was sitting at the edge of the water, snow surrounding him, like he had been sitting there, unmoving, for a very long time.
Dean gently touched Cas again, this time his first digit slipping in with ease. He could feel Cas's heated breath against his skin and couldn't help but get a little lost in a sea of unending blue.
Dean approached, and when he reached the angel, pulled out the fleece blanket he had bought from the store. He wrapped it around Cas’s shoulders.
When they entered the pharmacy Cas followed Dean, who pretty much immediately seemed to know where they needed to go for the lube. Cas looked at the shelves and the bottles, picking up a purple one. "Astroglide. Real pleasure lasts longer. Gel. Personal lubricant," he read. "Is that what you were looking for?"
She flashed them both a pained smile. “Uh, okay,” she said as she started laying out the dishes. “Our five least ordered items are… sweet breads, monkey brains, bull penis, balut, and cuy.” As she stood up she said, “Maybe don’t google what some of those are.”
Dean had to think about that for a moment; maybe force wasn’t quite the right word… it was more like Sam being underhanded and sneaky. “He signed me up without telling me, and said nothing about it until I got accepted. What about you? How did your brother force you?”
Dean nodded. "Okay," he said as he slipped his finger in deeper, wiggling it around as he did so.
Castiel rubbed his nose against his cheek, his breathing hot against Dean's skin as his finger mercilessly drilled deeper. "Tight, little human. Why do you smell like a demon, too?"
Dean couldn't stop himself. "Are you gay?"
Cas felt sick, and all he wanted was to storm off. Seeing Balthazar brought up all kinds of emotions, and none of them he was ready to deal with or face. "Well, if you’ll excuse me," he murmured before a familiar strong hand held him back.
Fixing him with a glare of her own, the witch stepped towards him. “Ye watch your mouth, Fergus, or I’ll turn you into a frog. I don’t know how you expect me to work under these conditions; I don’t even have all the ingredients.”
Cas froze at that. "Um, no. I'm... I'm grateful it's with you. Especially because I’ll only need to do it once." He looked away then. "But I'm not..." He shook his head. "It doesn't matter. It's not like we have a choice. No matter how much I want to disagree with Naomi... She is right. I saw the state of Heaven, and this is the only option."
He gave Dean a soft smile as he walked past him into the restaurant, which looked very cozy and new age-y. Dark brown wooden tables and benches, accentuated by lush green plants hanging from the ceiling and green pillows on the benches, were standing in front of big windows with a view of the ocean.
He waved Dean off. “I can stay here, if you’d like.”
“Good intense,” Dean said as he cupped Cas’s cheek, turning him to look at him. “Did… did it work?”
Oh, that was a dangerous revelation, and one Dean was not quite ready to address.
A gamut of emotions crossed Dean's face, ending on something that looked painfully like hope.
Demon henchman number eleven came in with a tray of tea for the witch every four hours when she was in the room. The tweedle demons came to get report from the witch every six hours. And Crowley managed to mosey his way in any time he and Castiel did the horizontal mambo.
A few seconds later a text came through, telling him Cas's whereabouts. He shot Sam a reply that simply said:
"Pretty sure I only got the role of Ghost of Christmas Present because I have red hair," a familiar voice stated behind him. When Dean turned around, he nearly choked.
In that moment, like a bad dream, Dean was rushed through the air, too fast to make sense of anything around him. And then it all stopped. Dean shook his head to reorient himself. Crowley had taken him to… he had trouble being able to tell. So many of the motel rooms had this exact layout.
The man on the other side of the hallway… Dean… He was the most gorgeous man Cas had ever laid eyes on. Like a supermodel or actor is beautiful. His breath caught in his throat as his feet carried him forward without thinking, walking turning into running before he was finally standing in front of Dean, only a small gap separating them.
After he grabbed the Walmart bag, Dean made his way through the small patch of woods before he reached the lake's edge. Snow was starting to fall, and thanks to the white blanket, he easily spotted a familiar tan coat. Cas was sitting on the ground, back towards Dean as he stared out at the slowly freezing lake.
"Cas?" Sam reached forward and hauled him in for a tight hug. "How? What…"
Castiel knew now that he had to try his plan. For one thing, it would be fun to see how a cosmic entity would react, and also, he knew that Dean would be so proud of him. Even if he never found out what Castiel had done, the thought of it was good enough.
Crowley stared him dead in the eye. "Don't you, though?" And they were spinning off again to what Dean assumed would be another grand fuck up.
For a brief moment he wondered if there was still a part of Dean’s humanity calling out to him, surging from deep within the darkness, trying to reach the light. “Dean,” Castiel moaned as his fingers slid up to Dean’s throat again, then to his chin, turning his head so he could press his lips to Dean’s.
“Definitely,” he breathed out as he squeezed Castiel’s wings.
Not this one though. Especially the junkless part. Castiel was gasping out Dean's name against his kiss-swollen lips as he leaned back and searched his eyes for something. For a moment, Castiel looked like he had much more control over himself, yet never faltering in the rough, hard pace. "You feel... feel so good."
Dean's dick twitched in response and he had to stifle his own groan. He started fucking the digit into Cas's hole, itching to know how that was going to feel.
“Well, are you gonna get swollen feet, morning sickness? You gonna get cute and chubby?” Dean’s lips curled in a teasing smile.
“Worth a shot.”
Cas swallowed dryly before giving him a shy smile. "I'm glad to hear that. I think a relationship can only work when everyone is honest."
"Where is Sam?" Cas growled, twirling his blade in his hand.
"Did I hurt you?" Dean pulled his digit away just in case.
Dean nodded. "Done. We're gonna have to figure out when we can both get the time off for a weekend in Vegas. Unless you want to find the Vancouver equivalent of Vegas?"
Cas frowned as he looked at Dean. "Are you telling me... we should..." He rubbed his hand over his neck. "Try to enjoy it?"
Cas looked over at Dean, trying to give him a reassuring smile. "I... just don't want to make things weird between us."
fantasy you're trying to pull off." The words were growled, but his voice never wavered.
The angel growled as he let go of Dean's throat in favor of grabbing him and lifting Dean into his arms, back now pressed against the bars. "Can't," the angel gasped roughly, and Dean could see fine glowing purple lines branching across the angel's neck. Clearly the spell. "Need to breed you."
He leaned back in his spot, grabbing the iron bars he had worked on for days now. He resonated his grace within a low frequency, slowly wearing the metal down until it started to corrode. He wasn't sure how long it would take. But it was a start to work on getting out of the cage in an undetected way.
Castiel gave Dean a soft peck on the lips, just because he could. It felt even better than he’d imagined, and he was glad it was no longer just a fantasy. “I approve of that plan. And hopefully it will help me to forget that song.”
She folded her hands and smiled. "Sam is fine and we won't harm him. You have my word. We will return him to you if you listen to me and do as I say."
"Getting me knocked up is the goal, right?" he asked as he licked a swipe along Castiel's jaw.
Dean patted Castiel’s shoulder. “Don’t worry, your secret’s safe with me.”
"I will make you forget about that song," Dean said with a raised eyebrow. Although it was worded as a threat, Dean looked very playful in that moment before he drew him into a deep kiss again.
An uncharacteristic smirk played over his conterfeit's features as he sneered. "Well, well, well. Finally had your happy moment. I hope it was worth it."
Dean gave Kumail an address near the bunker and held Cas’s hands in his to try and warm them up.
"Good ol' Wings. Except he was rather wingless here, wasn't he? Powerless, homeless, just… less. But you've always been a man divided." The bastard just stared at the broken version of Cas, pity and something more in his eyes.
When Dean was close enough to touch him, Castiel grabbed Dean by the hip and pulled him right against his own body, nudging his nose against Dean’s ear as one of his hands slid up to Dean's hair to hold him in place. He lowered his voice, "Do you have a plan?"
As the closest demon opened the door, Dean grabbed Castiel's wing and squeezed before he jumped up and charged the guy. He slammed through the door and held the demon against the nearest wall by his throat. "Cas, now!"
Instead of pulling them on, Cas buried his hand in Dean's jacket pocket with a sigh. "I didn't even realize it was snowing," he breathed out, white fog coming from his lips before he looked up at the sky. Snowflakes landed on his eyelashes and hair, decorating his angel in white fluffy stars.
Cas was surprised by the gesture, but took Dean's hand. His hand felt strong and warm and not for the first time that day Cas realized that he really missed sex. "I think it's a shame. I like your freckles. A lot."
“I promise,” Dean said, sounding serious for the first time. “But seriously… it would have to be Dr. Sexy himself for that to happen. And you’ll tell me if you find someone better?”
“Oh, I’m sorry, don’t you like it? Of course I’ll stop.”
"Heya, Cas," Dean said, flashing him a concerned smile. "You okay?"
Cas knew he had lost. He looked over to Dean with an apologetic expression. "Would you give us a moment?"
"You're an idjit." Bobby leaned back in his wheelchair and opened a drawer to throw a file on the desk. "This is your new case. You’ll take the angel with you and see what he can do. And I want a full report on how it works out."
“Yeah. That’s, uh… that’ll make the sex less painful. Unless…” Dean shook his head. “Nevermind.”
That goes for all three of you! I LOVE YOU SO MUUUUUSSSSSHHHHH!
“That’s exactly what I plan on doing, sweetheart.” Crowley lifted his hand to the demon’s face and ran his finger down his cheek. “Castiel’s going to love you.”
He could hear shuffling from the other side of the frosted wall before Cas replied in a deep and raspy voice, "Yeah, me too." His voice was closer, as if he was sitting right behind the wall. "How did your brother force you into this?"
“I’m not talking about that. I’m talking about the fact that Cas lost his son. No matter what Jack did, it doesn’t change that he was Cas’s family. And he died right in front of him. And all the words you had left for your best friend… were accusations.“
“Oh yeah, tell me what you’re wearing.” Dean cringed at how dirty that sounded, but the way Cas laughed it was totally worth it.
Cas wasn't sure if Dean was flirting with him at that moment. If he was, that would have been a pretty bold pickup line. He nodded shyly at him. "No strings attached, hm? One night stands or casual sex never really worked out for me. I fall so easily for people. And always end up getting my heart broken. Especially by guys."
“Bite me.”
But one coffee wouldn’t mean anything…
It was strange how straight and serious Castiel was acting. Impressive, honestly. The antithesis of his real personality. “Yeah, well, I don’t need your assistance. Just… stay out of my way.”
To the readers, I fully realize that you're probably reading this fic because you follow one or more of my coauthors. As you should! You have no idea the fics that are heading your way in the next year! I'm so psyched to see what you all think of them, and am only slightly bragging about getting to read them first. X'D
Young Dean didn’t stop Cas from leaving, and Dean himself couldn’t. He swallowed down the lump in his throat, an all too familiar departure. All too recent.
“Fuck,” he breathed out before he groaned again, dropping to his knees as he clutched his abdomen even harder.
"Dean, may I introduce you to Castiel? He’s your new co-star. Castiel, this is Dean Winchester."
“Well…” Dean said, “it is sex. I mean, if we’re being forced to do it… I’d rather try and enjoy it.”
Dean couldn’t piece together what it was about Castiel. The angel was… a quick study for one. And then there was the whole thing with… the way he could make the Mark sing. That pleasurable sensation Dean assumed he could only get through the act of murder.
"Great," Balthazar said as he chucked his chin. "I'll text you."
Castiel had no idea where he was, but he needed to get back to the bunker, back to Sam…
"That's okay," Dean said, trying to hide his disappointment. "I like when actors play outside their sexuality."
They had the highest rated show in their timeslot, and Dean and Sam were getting a pretty penny after the most recent negotiations. He was sure that was why they took the show in the direction they did; separating the brothers in the show to branch out. To introduce new characters, and specifically to take a huge step in representation.
Castiel couldn’t agree more with that sentiment, and as he reveled in the feeling of Dean’s solid warmth pressed against him, he began humming absentmindedly.
“Oh, I love how spirited you are.” Turning to his minion, Crowley said, “Take, ‘bite me,’ to Castiel.”
Castiel suddenly flinched away from Dean, pushing him off, which caused Dean to land on his ass, right into a pile of dust. And considering what their captor said, that meant said dust covering the cage floor was clearly a bunch of roasted demons.
"And I would have said yes. I hope you know that," Balthazar said with a soft sigh.
Dean gently grasped his shoulder. "Maybe take it slow."
Castiel had a strong grip, warm fingers wrapping around Dean's as he shook his hand, his eyes never leaving Dean's. "Charlie said you would show me around, and you would be the best person to make me feel welcome."
"Fuck you." It was the only thing he could press out, before he pulled his arm away from Balthazar and walked back to his trailer at a fast pace, not looking back. A tear ran over his cheek the moment he closed the door behind him, his heart beating a million miles a minute.
TV series - drama, fantasy, horror
Cas’s head slowly fell forward until his forehead leaned against Dean's shoulder. A soft gasp escaped his lips before he hummed. “I think I get why we needed the lube.”
"Ain't my first rodeo," he said, "just keep me against this door."
Cas was breathing heavily, staring at Dean with wide eyes. "Dean... promise me, this won't change anything," he begged quietly in between hiccupped gasps as Dean's cock bumped against Cas's hole.
Damn, he really liked the guy. His nervousness was adorable as fuck, his voice was doing things to him, he also had a meddling brother who’d made him do this, and now they had the same favourite show. “If you tell me you also love classic rock and burgers, I’ll have to marry you.”
Dean rubbed the back of his neck. “Shit, Cas.” He looked over at Cas when they came to a stop at a four way intersection. “You trust Naomi won’t hurt our kid?”
Crowley stood and walked around from behind his desk to examine the demon. He looked murderous as his black eyes glared at him furiously.
Dean chuckled. “You lucked out. Charlie’s one of the nicer directors. Be grateful it’s not Gabe.”
“I annoyed an ancient cosmic being. Again,” he started, holding back his laughter at the memory of what happened.
A witch.
Dean nodded. "For like, my part. Your part, we um… we can figure it out." He had never seen Dean so… unconfident before.
“Oh crap,” Dean exclaimed suddenly, a startled expression on his face. “Does this mean our brothers were right?”
"Thought you liked adventures?" Dean challenged.
"Fuck yeah," he groaned as he started massaging the part of his wing he was touching.
And there had been a lot of ‘em over the years. Then his younger self stormed into the room. Young Dean had grabbed one of Sam’s bags and ripped it open. Throwing every single item he pulled out of it to the floor.
Dean widened his eyes.
Castiel groaned at the tightness, before he pressed his lips against Dean's neck, breathing hard. "I'm not sure, but... I think it's... it's your soul reaching out. It feels really... nice."
His fingers slipped into Dean's hair as he watched him, stretched lips around his fast growing hard member, and green eyes looking up at him. He moaned as he rubbed his thumb over Dean's freckled cheek.
Dean had only been joking about
Well, that was interesting. "So you like being single?"
to feel…” Dean shivered. Whether from the cold or the confession he couldn’t be certain.
Dean moaned outright. "No idea… just wanted to touch you."
When Charlie called, “Action,” Dean stepped forward and slammed his fist on the desk in front of Bobby.
Dean barked out a laugh. He shook his head as he started walking again. “We’re about to try and have a kid together. It’s definitely gonna be different.”
Any, Frankie, Ruk… and you - yeah, you reading this - I wish you the happiest of holidays and hope the new decade is full of love, laughter, and lots of entertaining fics! 💜
It was really annoying because he had sworn to himself to never start anything with a guy again. Men were assholes. Every one of his exes had cheated on him. Not that he had a lot of luck with women either, but all of his life he had fallen for guys a lot quicker than he had for women, and it always ended up with him left being heartbroken.
“We should go,” she said, softly.
That was not instilling a lot of confidence in Cas. “But theoretically you know how to use this?”
He practically whined. “Can’t you make Wayne do it?”
Cas turned to Dean, feeling apprehensive. "Try calling him."
Dean chuckled and looked at Castiel. "Not bad."
Eeeek! We hope y'all like the way we ended it Thank you for all of the love! This was a blast to write! <3<3<3<3
And with that she vanished back through the portal.
Dean smiled and handed Cas the mug. "That's kind of you. Have I seen you in anything?" Besides the wet dream Dean absolutely knew this man would star in later tonight.
Cas breathed out a relieved smile. "Yeah... Please," he replied as he leaned in closer, closing the gap to Dean's lips with a soft kiss. A kiss that quickly turned more heated as he wrapped his arm around Dean, sliding his other hand into Dean's short hair. He just knew he would never want to let go of Dean again.
As Dean watched his younger self continue to berate and tear down his little brother, who sat silently and took it all, not once interjecting, Dean shook his head and waved his hand. “Alright. I get it. I don’t need to see anymore.”
"I'm gonna take a wild shot in the dark here and say… he owes you money?" Dean's lips were curled in a smug grin.
And the only reason he was even in this position in the first place was because some black-eyed bitches just so happened to run into him while he was fucked up on ayahuasca.
Cas closed his eyes, enjoying the feel of Dean's strong arms around him and the way he was stroking over his back. He wanted to feel his hands everywhere on his body. "True… the really fucked up part is that I still… think of him sometimes. We were together for three years."
Dean swallowed against the lump in his throat. He had to consciously stop himself from closing the gap between them. Cas didn't even want this.
Dean nodded and shut off the engine. “Fuck. We’re really doing this,” he breathed out in a laugh, looking at Cas in amazement.
Once he was completely under her control, she changed her incantation, and waved her hand at the door, which swung open uninvitingly.
He was mildly grateful that his mother had made it out of there alive; mostly because she’d been able to announce the news of the pregnancy. A pregnancy that the creatures involved were apparently unaware of, if their actions were any indication.
The guy didn’t look as concerned at Dean’s dismissal of the bindings as he’d hoped. “Don’t think you’re getting out of here anytime soon. It won’t be quite so easy to break the spell on the door.”
There was a selfish voice inside of him; one he tried to ignore, but it had gotten louder. A voice reminding him that this was his chance for a life with Dean. A life that he had secretly wanted. Not this scenario of course, but being with Dean and making him happy. It was hard to smother the hope that Dean and him would grow even closer by sharing this.
“Heya, Cas. How’s your day been?” Dean crossed all his fingers, desperately hoping that Cas wasn’t going to tell him he’d met someone better.
“Knocked up?” Dean supplied as he put the vehicle in reverse and started the journey home.
We fucking love you, t-rex. <3<3<3
There was a soft sigh on the other side. “Okay… um, no judgment, but I have this guilty pleasure… There is this series I watch and my brother threatened to delete my recordings of all my favourite episodes if I didn’t go.”
Cas wasn't even subtle when he looked at Dean's ass, as he was bending over a bush, pretending to puke. He remained stoic and in character though, deepening his voice as he said, "Dan, I’ve told you a few times now, your nausea has nothing to do with my flying abilities. You probably just ate something that went bad."
The man nodded and Cas couldn't help but feel extremely excited, happy but also nervous. What if Dean didn't like him when he saw him? "I'll see you in a moment, Dean. They’re letting us meet."
The Empty rolled its eyes. "Dean, Dean, Dean. You're like a broken record. But I tell you, a few years with me and you'll forget about those pathetic feelings." The Empty slithered closer and smirked. "I'll make you wish you could die exactly as much as I want to sleep."
Cas stepped into Dean's personal space, close enough to smell his aftershave. All he wanted to do was to bury his nose against Dean's throat, and enjoy the scent. His eyes never left Dean's as he reached out to gently cup Dean's cheek.
The red lines guided his eyes down and over a flat stomach, sharp hip bones peeking out of low hanging suit pants that had seen better days.
“Yeah.”
He’s glad he talked to Cas that first night at the Roadhouse, though, because that kickstarted their relationship. At first, it was friendship, then it morphed into
“Wow,” Cas eventually manages. He slips out of his coat and hangs it on the coatrack before moving closer. He kisses Jimmy on the cheek, but Jimmy can tell that his focus is mostly on Dean.
Jimmy is careful to set up his equipment way before Dean and Cas come into the living room. The lighting will be beautiful, he’s sure of that, but he’s got to figure out the best angle again, and he’ll be distracted if he does so while Dean and Cas are in the room. He loves them, but they’re both way too hot for their own good.
“Sure, why not. If I get a whiskey, will you join me?” They made eye contact and Dean felt like he was going to turn into a puddle.
The beep sounds, and for a little while, Dean doesn’t really hear a lot except for breathing, and then the noises kick in. Dean’s ears are suddenly filled with moans, whines, and groans, and it takes him a few seconds to place it, but then he
Besides, he’s got his own secret that he’s almost ready to tell them, and he’s been planning the perfect way to open up. For their own fifth anniversaries, he’d recreated their original first date, but the first date with all three of them isn’t something he wanted to recreate for this occasion. No, it needs to be something better. He’s been torn between two venues, and he’s finally decided, so when Cas, Benny, and Dean all have the same day off, Dean asks them to join him for dinner at the Roadhouse. Yes. He knows. The Roadhouse again. But it’s where he’s comfortable
“No, Dean,” Cas said, closer than he was before. “You tell me what you’re doing. How do you want to get off tonight?”
himself? Dean’s hand had slipped lower and lower while still keeping a grip on his phone so he could answer the second Cas called – because he knew that was exactly what Cas would do.
Jimmy nods. “The idea is you worshipping Dean, which probably isn’t too difficult to do because he looks like a fucking
when the twink is penetrated by the bear, and when the other bear silences the twink by sliding his cock into his mouth… and Dean can’t help but get turned on. He wants to put a hand on his cock, but remembers just in time that he’s still tied up to avoid straining muscles. His cock is hardening, though, and it’s strangely arousing to feel that happening so consciously, without any other input whatsoever. He’s missing his eyes and hands a lot – and Cas. Cas is probably watching him. Dean moans, muffled through the gag, at the thought of Cas watching Dean’s erection come to life.
“You’re all prepared?” Cas asks. He wants to tease Dean, make him feel as much anticipation as he is currently feeling, but Cas also thinks that he’s probably not able to keep it up for very long because he’s so nervous. Masking his nerves is something he learned early on as a human, because everyone kept flocking towards him the second he showed his insecurities, and Cas didn’t like that, so Dean probably doesn’t see that he’s nervous. But it doesn’t mean the feeling isn’t there.
“Castiel Novak, Benjamin Lafitte… would you do me the honour of becoming my partners?” He pops open the two ring boxes he’s got with him, and only then he looks up at Cas and Benny.
Dean, flushed, nods, and allows Cas to come closer. Castiel’s fingers run over the golden straps covering only a few parts of Dean and he eventually draws back again, taking in all the small details of the lingerie.
When Cas is finally naked, he sinks down on his knees in front of Dean. His eyes meet Dean’s, and Jimmy can see the clear love in both of their eyes. He feels a little left out but knows they will make it up to him after the photo shoot. Cas presses his lips against Dean’s cock while keeping eye contact with Dean, then takes his cock into his mouth. The pace must be agonizingly slow for Dean, but Dean only throws his head back in ecstasy, moaning loudly. Jimmy takes pictures of Dean, of Cas, of Dean and Cas, and he loves being able to capture his partners in bliss. He doesn’t focus on shooting porn. No, Jimmy’s focus is on capturing the raw sense of love that he can see on both of their faces, on showing the
They’re in the middle of the second
“I’m Castiel,” the man said, “but call me Cas, please. Did your friends set you up?”
his phone is.
“You don’t like fancy stuff, I don’t like fancy stuff.” Dean looks at Cas just to see his eyes twinkle. “Plus, I’m nostalgic, as you know. So yeah, we’re at the Roadhouse.”
Dean lays his hands on Cas’s shoulders, draping the gold chain connecting his cuffs across Cas’s shoulders. It’s a gorgeous shot, and it’s one of the last ones Jimmy takes before the worshipping session turns into Dean furiously fucking Cas’s mouth. It doesn’t take either of them long to come after Dean’s set a punishing pace. Jimmy has mostly given up on taking artistic shots at this point, but he loves the final shot he takes: Dean coming over Cas’s face, with Cas looking blissed out.
“Do… do you want to put it on? Or how were you picturing this?” Dean is nervous somehow, and Cas wants to explore that further, but he picked this one with a specific goal in mind.
in this specific piece.”
“Good to hear. I’ll keep checking in occasionally, okay?”
“But I thought your friends already knew you were poly,” Cas says. He’s frowning, looking confused.
Cas’s smile is sheepish. “Yeah,” he says. “Apparently there’s this setting that allows you to listen to a voicemail as it’s being recorded, which is exactly what I wanted here.”
“Yeah,” Cas breathes. “Oh, wow. I… I don’t have words. Dean… Dean, may I touch you?”
“Describe to me what you’re doing.” Cas was always commanding Dean around and Dean liked it, but now it sounded like he was further away. Knowing Cas, he was probably ensuring that he wouldn’t be disturbed. He never wanted to be caught with his pants down and his dick out; as a billionaire, that was fodder for the rags and that always brought more problems than it was worth.
This time (as Dean tends to say whenever Cas brings up something new), it’s blindfolds. He doesn’t quite remember where he first saw blindfolds, but he’s been intrigued. Cas knows some people sleep with them on, but he’s also seen some corners of the internet where they are used for sexy purposes, and he’s
Look, his secret isn’t a big one, but it’s still something he’s hidden from Cas and Benny, and they might not like that he’s hidden it, but it’s something
“I love you, too,” Cas said. “Although…” Dean heard Cas grimacing. “This isn’t optimal.”
my orgasm?”
“Good, but I couldn’t wait to see you,” Dean answers, a similar smile on his face.
Dean nods again, unable to speak, and then Cas puts the headphones on, and Dean also doesn’t hear anything except for the soft static that comes through plugged in headphones. He knows they’re linked to something, then, although he’s not sure what he’s going to hear,
“With regards to…?”
But as soon as it’s the two of them, Benny’s sole focus is on Dean, and Dean is surprised at how intense it feels, even after five years of them dating. Benny still has an effect on him that no one has ever had. While Cas is the punk, still bedecked in many many piercings and even more tattoos, by now, Benny is their teddy bear. He’s soft and squishy, and Dean loves him so much. Now that he’s formally told Cas, he feels like he should tell Benny as well. The words always felt a little meaningless to him, but now that he knows how nice it is to hear it be affirmed out loud, he burrows deeper into Benny’s embrace, and whispers in his ear:
Dean’s moans and whines increase the longer Cas continues, and when Cas stops for a brief pause, clears his throat, and takes a sip of something, Dean feels a surge of disappointment. Somehow, he’s still there, still ready to come, still
When Dean deems himself
“Did you like the picture?” Dean asked, pretending that he hadn’t heard what Cas said.
(Three weeks later, Cas receives a message during work. It’s a long voice memo, and a line just below it says “I just masturbated to your voice”. Cas doesn’t open the voice memo, because he’s relatively sure it’s payback. And it is – the message is Dean dirty talking to Cas, with the voicemail Cas recorded for him playing in the background. Dean doesn’t get off easily after that one…)
“Fuck, Cas…”
“Anything in particular you want?” Dean asks, slowly drawing his phone from the pocket in his lounging pants.
“And that’s why we’re at the Roadhouse?”
“Only if you want to.”
When Dean managed to support Sam through university, he’d never thought he’d end up there himself too. Sam was happily practicing as a lawyer when Dean finally got the chance to go himself. He always said that, if he ever won the lottery, he’d also go to college or university and figure out what he wanted to do in life that wasn’t supporting his brother.
It was a low-key affair – Dean didn’t want his friends to know that he was dating not
“Hello Dean,” Cas says, a smile curling around his lips. “How was work today?”
aware of it. His cock twitches and the low rumble of Cas’s voice washes over him. Dean doesn’t know what it is Cas is saying, but it’s sexy as fuck, and only a few minutes into Cas’s monologue about whatever, Dean comes, long and hard, all over himself, covering the latex and ropes in his come, and Dean sags in relief as soon as the call appears to cut and hands follow a slow path over Dean’s shoulders, untying him, then taking off the headphones and blindfold, and removing the gag. Dean falls into Cas’s arms, and Cas helps him to the bed, where he sits him down and strips the latex suit off before pulling Dean under the covers. Dean keeps his eyes closed while he gets used to the fact that there’s light at all, and Cas remains quiet, but it’s clear he wants to ask Dean what he thought. Dean just wants to snuggle, though, and come down, and
“You… Wait,” Dean said, after Cas’s words finally processed, “you’re threatening with denying
“Gorgeous,” Cas says once more, before turning to Jimmy. “You… wanted a series?”
I liked the picture, you asshole. I’m currently stuck in the bathrooms trying to make my erection go down.”
“That’s why we’re at the Roadhouse,” Benny says. He nods. “So, how do you want to do this? Make out during dinner until Jo catches us all at it?”
“Of course,” Cas says, squeezing Dean’s hand. Dean loves how the dimness of the Roadhouse plays with shades across Cas’s face, how some of his piercings seem to be more prominent than others.
“Yes, sir,” Dean whispered. There was no easy way out, now, and he took a deep breath before he described the movements of his hands. It didn’t take long before his nipples got a little too sensitive, and he moved on to tracing the outline of his erection through the cotton of his panties. He heard Castiel getting impatient and sped up without having to be told explicitly, taking a hold of his cock through the panties and jerking himself slowly. He could hear Cas getting closer and closer, and when Cas came with a soft moan, it only took a few more pulls on his own cock before Dean came.
“Ah,” Cas said, sounding like he knew all about annoying, meddling friends. “Well, they’ve done a good job, I think. Let’s drink and see where we end up?”
without the literal dressings of life, and Cas cherishes every touch.
“Yeah sure.”
Cas nods and leans into the comfort of Dean’s fingers. “I know,” he whispers. He doesn’t need to say anything else, doesn’t need to say that he’s still nervous, that he’s curious but also feeling jittery. The knowledge that Dean is there for him is enough to calm him down for now, and so he relaxes on the chair. Cas closes his eyes in anticipation when Dean comes forward, and he feels his muscles relaxing further as Dean slips the blindfold over his eyes. The world turns a little darker, but it’s soothing, nice, and Cas sighs softly.
Dean nods and kisses Cas quickly before he slips from the living room into the bathroom to comply with Cas’s wishes. He’s curious to see what Cas has planned for him, but his thoughts are weirdly dominated by his phone. He’s still not sure why Cas needs his phone, but he trusts his boyfriend slash partner a lot.
“I think that might get us a ban, regardless of who I am,” he says, shaking his head. “No, I want to come sit with you and when she comes over… well, I’ve got a surprise for you.” He’s subject to two pairs of narrowed eyes that are bordering on glares, but he soldiers on. “And I’m not telling you what it is. So, scoot over so I can sit with you.”
him to succeed, and while it was difficult to not see each other almost daily, it was probably good for their relationship. It did leave time for contemplation and consideration about where they stood after a few years of dating (Cas didn’t convince Dean overnight…), but it also left Dean horny most nights. He was very much used to Cas taking care of him whenever he could, them touching whenever they could, or at least sleeping in the same bed. Now, he was sleeping in his own bed in a dorm he didn’t particularly like, and he was already looking forward to asking Cas to share an apartment next year. He felt ready to move in together (they’d spent so much time together already, and not being together made it sting all the more) and Cas could do his job anywhere… Yeah, Dean was a little excited to ask his boyfriend if they could go apartment hunting together once he’s settled a little more and knows what he wants to study.
Dean was proven right just a few minutes later, when his phone buzzed in his hand. Not just once, but several times, so it was a call. Dean swiped to answer, not bothering to check who the caller was (and secretly hoping that it wasn’t Sam), his voice a breathy mess already.
“Thanks for waiting, Dean,” Cas says, dropping everything on the bed and pressing a kiss to Dean’s forehead. “I’ve got something planned today that’s a little out there, but I think you’ll enjoy it, okay?”
His very first date with both Cas and Benny went something like his first with Benny. They’d been comfortably together for a few months, which more or less happened accidentally. They fell into it like this relationship had been waiting for them to embrace it, and when Cas made it official, they decided to do four types of dates: Benny and Dean, Dean and Cas, Cas and Benny, and all three of them together. Just to keep some things for themselves and not to feel like they had to share everything. Dean loved it, but it was stupidly difficult to find an evening or day that worked for all three of them.
Dean nods. Usually Cas tells him exactly what’s going to happen, but after last time, Dean requested he did a surprise scene once every while. This must be the first of those.
Then, the headphones come to life, and Dean’s peace and quiet is suddenly shatters. He startles but is held in place by the ropes wrapped around him. He can hear his phone ringing, ringing, ringing… and he realises that the headphones are plugged into his phone. But he can’t answer, because his hands are inside the latex suit, and he doesn’t even know
, he moves over to the play room and sits on the edge of the small bed to wait for Cas. The temperature in their little play room (which isn’t actually very small, just cozy) is set exactly to Dean’s comfort level, and he’s glad for that now, especially because Cas is taking a little while to arrive and start their scene.
“That’s nice to hear, but that’s probably not all, right?”
“Dean…” Cas gets up and comes over to sit next to Dean in his booth, kissing him hard and long, with an urgency that he’s barely ever displayed before. “I love you too.”
As soon as Dean had shimmied his way into it, he walked over to the mirror to admire himself. He smiled at himself as he turned around to admire himself from all angles. He looked amazing if he said so himself, and he was sure Cas would love it too. Dean lit a few candles to set the scene, then adjusted himself so the tip of his cock peeked over the edge of the panties. He was going for a tasteful dick pic, so his cock should at least be visible. But he also wanted to tease Cas, hence the panties. Dean struck a pose and then relaxed again. No need to do that, he just needed to get a good picture of his lower body… so he did. He didn’t look at it too long before he sent it to Cas with a short message warning him of the contents if he was in public, and then he settled on the bed, phone to his left and right hand slowly circling his nipples. While waiting for Cas to reply, he had to do something, right? And why not just…
It was also completely Cas’s idea to pay for Dean’s tuition and whatever else he’d need for whatever studies he’d like to pursue. No strings attached, except the occasional sex, because Cas
“Oh Dean,” Jimmy says, allowing his eyes to stray over Dean’s beautiful body. “You look gorgeous. Cas won’t know what hits him…”
“Fuck, Dean, you’re going to be the death of me.” Cas groaned. “
They spent most of the weekend in bed, and they didn’t leave the property at all that weekend, preferring takeout when they didn’t want to make dinner, but it was a very successful ‘date’, at least.
“The scene. How do you want me? I’m assuming you know exactly what you’re going to do with my phone and its voicemail settings, so I’m asking about my preparations.”
They didn’t stop there – there was clearly chemistry between them – and when Dean left Benny’s apartment the morning after, he was still in a bit of a daze. That first date had been very successful indeed.
“Did you change your voicemail settings like I asked?” Cas asks, strolling casually into Dean’s living room one Saturday afternoon. They had a standing appointment on Saturdays to meet up, but Dean never quite knew what time Cas would be coming over because Cas works most Saturdays. Him strolling in unannounced thus isn’t so unusual, but what is, is the question.
Cas had slept through the night. Tenderly, he reached out a finger and brushed the black hair to the side. How stunning he looked. “What?”, Cas asked quiet, struggling to wake up. “We slept through, we have to get up now, sweetheart.”, Dean’s voice was soft and warm. A smile danced on his lips and was mirrored in his eyes. With his index finger, he stroked Cas’ cheek, feeling the tiny stubble on his jawline. “Come on. Up you go.”, he bent down and kissed Cas’ dry lips. The other kissed him back, fingers clinging to his shirt. “What time is it?”, Cas asked confused and yawned. “Too late, for Mr Samuel Morning Run.”, Dean replied, cynically. Cas propped himself up and leaned against the wooden bed frame. Then, like a cloud that had lifted, his eyes went wide. “I slept!”, he exclaimed, in shock. “Yep.”, Dean said, slipping into his jeans. “But I don’t sleep.”, one could almost see the wheels turning behind Cas’ forehead. “Why was I asleep?”, he asked irritation growing stronger with each syllable. “You tell me.”, Dean raised an eyebrow as he threw Cas’ jacket on the bed. Cas sat up, crossed-legged on the bed, contemplating. Was this just another aspect of his changing powers? Like the cold, he could feel now. Cas felt the mattress give in as Dean sat down next to him. “Hey, listen. We don’t know what
“Can you promise me that at some point you will go for the things you really want? Go for the turquoise when you feel ready.”, he said with a levelled voice, so nonchalant and yet it pierced through Dean, hot and cold.
Dean has thought this through. Well, sort of. It was more of a sudden realisation, a chick-flick-moment probably caused by watching this damn rom-com marathon with Jack. But when he stood in front of the sink, washing up the dishes from dinner, arm-deep in soap water it sounded like a brilliant idea in his head.
anything couple-y since. Maybe, because being around each other was so ordinary to them since they had been living with each other for so long, it felt weird to start doing things they hadn’t done before. Cas felt the urge to hug Dean more often but didn’t want to do anything prematurely. Maybe they just needed time to get used to the idea of them both as a couple. “Want a beer?”, Dean stuck his head in Cas’ room. Cas was tidying his things. He nodded and followed Dean out into the kitchen. “There is a Dr Sexy M.D. marathon on, wanna watch?”, he said casually. “Sure.”, came the short response. Cas’ shoulders tightened. They sat down; the series was already on. Dean opened their beers and held one out for Cas.  Their fingers brushed against each other, as they did so often the past couple of years, but this time it felt like an electric jolt went through Cas’ hand. He swallowed, his tongue feeling thick. Dean leaned back, settling into the couch, eyes fixed on the screen. Cas glanced at him, guiding his beer towards his lips and took a sip. He was beautiful, even in the most mundane setting. Dean Winchester, the man that loved him. His eyes flickered to the television. He had no idea what that series was about, the characters were foreign to him and their dynamics confusing. Trying to relax he nuzzled himself against the cushion. It was a start. When they finished their first beer, Dean got up and got two new ones from the kitchen. Cas watched his every move, his heart racing. He breathed in deeply to steady himself. Dean returned and set the bottle in front of Cas and sat down again. His arm came up on rested on the backrest of the couch. It looked inviting, but Cas didn’t dare to move. A few minutes passed and then Dean cleared his throat suddenly. “Well,”, he said the insecurity only barely hidden in his tone, his face still glued to the screen, “do you want to stay pressed to the corner all night. Or do you want to come here?” Cas’ eyes widened for a second, then, as if on autopilot, he moved closer to Dean. Carefully, he leaned against him, testing, feeling his way toward the warm body. Dean’s arm came down and curled around Cas, his hand landing on his hip. Breathing out, Cas surrendered completely and put his weight against Dean, pressing his cheek against Dean’s shoulder. It felt so strange, and yet as if he had always leaned against Dean like that. Hours past and Cas was now snuggled up against Dean, feeling safe and sound in the other man’s presence. He heard Dean mouthing some of the dialogue and smiled quietly to himself. Dean Winchester, his beautiful Dean.
He left the store and the town at once that day, the ring heavy on his finger.
. His first bite of bacon was heavenly and the pancakes didn’t disappoint as well. As he dug in, not minding how he looked, Cas shifted uncomfortably on his red-leather seat. “You okay, Cas?”, Sam asked attentively. “Mmm”, Cas answered, barely able to part his eyes from Dean’s plate. Dean, who heard the conversation, looked up at his boyfriend and saw the look in his eyes. Irritation washed over his face, but then it dawned on him. Hastily, he swallowed and held his fork towards Cas. “Are you hungry?”, he asked, examining Cas’ face tentatively. “I think so.”, Cas said slowly and took the fork from him. His head tilted like it always did when Castiel couldn’t place a thought or feeling. Carefully he pierced through some of Dean’s sausage. It tasted good, still like a million molecules, but different. Fulfilling. Warmth spread in his belly and with every bite he felt stronger, more like himself again. In admiration and wonder, Dean just watched his lover eat, getting more confident with every bite. It was weird, to see Cas wolf down his food. And yet, it was the most adorable sight. Cas ate like a child having cake for dinner. Sam and Eileen looked worried and perplexed but didn’t interrupt. “Better?”, Dean asked when Cas had finished almost the entire plate and put his fork down, sheepishly looking up at Dean. “Yeah. Sorry”, he mumbled, realising that he ate Dean’s food which he knew was a no-no, usually. “That’s ok”, Dean reassured him, voice gentle and calm. Sam raised his eyebrows at this statement,
, he thought,
“I see”, Basir just nodded and bend down again.
This was supposed to be only three chapters long, to be super poetic and keeping it with the Truly Madly Deeply theme but now there will be a fourth chapter, well, it is what it is. Have fun!
. Something is up with you guys.”, he said eyes squinting at them both. Cas, as unaware as ever, just looked innocently at the three of them. “ You pregnant?”, Dean just blatantly asked, turning to Eileen, since it was the only thing that came to mind. Sam almost spit out his coffee and Eileen laughed at his reaction. “NO!”, Sam blurted out and Eileen shook her head, still grinning. “Then what?”, Dean laughed. “We”, Sam composed himself, “We were just wondering if you guys might want to join us on our trip on the weekend. There is this hiking spot in Vermont and a new Bed’n’Breakfast opened up, which offers these packages…”, he started to explain, but Dean interrupted him, shaking his head. “Nope”, he said resolutely. “Dean you didn’t even let me-”, Sam got worked up, but Dean wouldn’t let him explain. “No, I know what this is. You two saw some sort of offer somewhere and now you try to make us come with you to share the price.” Sam looked angry, but before he could say anything, Castiel gently touched Dean’s arm and looked at him with those giant blue eyes. “That does sound fun, though.”, he said shyly. Dean stared at him, incredulously. “You are joking? Right?!”, he yelped. With a smile creeping back on his face, Sam leaned back looking triumphantly at the pair. It was over for Dean. “Well, no. I mean, we are here most of the time, and I know the town now by heart and maybe a change of scenery wouldn’t be so bad.”, Cas shrugged, his hand still on Dean’s arm. Eileen watched them with warm eyes. “It’s just one weekend, Dean.”, Sam said, and Dean threw him a soured look.
Now, five years after their first date, Dean has partially recreated their first date. There’s no baseball on tv, so Dean has picked a few movies that they’d both enjoy. Cas is babysitting his brother’s children for the night, promising to stay over to give them some privacy, and they kiss him goodbye when he leaves.
know, I’ve just never come out for it to friends and family. I think they’re all thinking I’m mad for not picking one of you, but I want to be with
“Yes, Dean,” Cas mumbles. “This is… relaxing, is all.”
Dean’s getting better and better at the posing thing, and although Jimmy sometimes has to direct him to move his hands or to move a little in this direction or that, it feels natural.
. And you know that, right?” He looks at Benny, who nods, and then at Cas, who follows suit.
“Shut up and kiss me already,” Cas grumbles. “I’m not sure why you’re waiting for permission. You can take off the blindfold as well, but I like the darkness for now. I enjoyed it, we can talk later, but
Dean looks a little taken aback but nods quickly after. He puts away the other blindfolds and puts the one Cas picked on the bed. “Do you have any other preferences for what you want to do, or…?”
what was coming but couldn’t do anything about it.
Dean nods, most of the movement he can do at the moment. Cas falls quiet for a little bit, and then continues. “Let’s test this hypothesis, then.” He clears his throat. “It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife...” Cas starts reading – Dean recognises the book but can’t quite place it – and Dean moans as the words flow into one another. He’s still on the edge of coming, but he’s not sure if Cas reading a book is enough for him to tip over the edge.
All of a sudden, it’s way too quiet in the Roadhouse, and Dean swallows compulsively, unsure whether he’s made the right move or not. But then there are arms around him and Cas is crying and whispering
“Good. So, I’ve got a full-body latex suit here, and you’ll have to put that on. I’ve also got a blindfold, a gag, and headphones, and they’re going to figure into this too.” Cas hands over the latex suit and helps Dean into it. The hands are a little uncomfortable, as they’re like mitts, and Dean can’t use his fingers anymore, which is… unsettling. The weirdest part of the latex suit is the fact that his crotch is left open, but Dean shrugs it off quickly. Castiel then helps position him on their St Andrews cross, tying Dean to it spread-eagle.
“No,” Cas says. “I think you can come up with something amazing if I don’t give you any directions, so I’ll leave it up to you. Just allow me to be the one blindfolded.”
man but two, and so they stayed at Benny’s apartment, watching a baseball game while drinking beer. The one thing that set it apart from them just being there as friends was the fact that they were sat closely together, and that halfway through the game, they started making out.
they can talk.
Dean smiled as he ended the call, and he forced himself to get up and clean himself off, soaking the panties to get the worst of the semen out. It had been fun, and his sugar daddy would be satisfied for the night, at least. Dean knew he was at Cas’s beck and call, but lately, it felt like it was something that went both ways. They couldn’t do without each other, and Dean was as happy as he could have been. When Dean went back to bed, he was clean and still smiling, and he knew today had been a great day even though he disturbed his sugar daddy while at work…
“Sorry,” Dean said, not sure if he really was feeling sorry.
Cas snorted. “Sure you are.” His tone became more serious, though. “I don’t have very long, Dean. So if you want to get off, you’d better get started quickly, because the board meeting is not going to wait for me forever, and I need to get Zachariah off the board as soon as I can. Being late won’t work in my favour.”
He allows Dean to undress him slowly, casually, without much fanfare. It’s familiar by now, to be naked near each other. Sometimes it’s even comforting to be so close and to just
“I’m Dean,” Dean replied, then rubbed a hand over the back of his neck. “They didn’t exactly set me up, but I only recently came out as bi, and they’ve been attempting to get me to open up a little more about my attraction to men, and they usually just push me over to people I maybe wouldn’t dare approach on my own.”
“Oh, I can do that,” Cas says, voice dark, and Jimmy sees Dean shiver and flush. Cas focuses solely on Dean, keeping eye contact as he slowly but surely takes off his suit jacket, then tie, then shirt. The striptease isn’t as sexy as it could have been, because both Dean and Cas are impatient to get to the main event but it still turns Dean on. Jimmy documents the striptease and Dean’s reaction as well as he can, but he has to pause too to adjust himself.
Jimmy positions the couch just so, then makes sure that the light isn’t too bright or too soft so his pictures will be perfect. His subjects will help, of course, but the light might still ruin the best pictures. Moving a few more pieces of so that he’s got a nice light backdrop to make he can take a few pictures of Dean in the amazing Playful Promises lingerie, he finally looks up in satisfaction. Everything is exactly as he wants it, his camera is ready to go, and now he’s just got to wait until Dean is dressed (or undressed) and Cas gets home.
“Um...” He shyly glanced away. “Yeah, okay.”
"Yes, please," Cas replied, sounding a little embarrassed. "I can do the same if you want."
“You need to help him!” Castiel yelled at them. “Something is happening to him.”
“I just wanted to tell you,” he says cheekily.
Their session lasts another fifteen minutes or so, and Jimmy is on the verge of tackling Dean to the couch for a good make-out session when Cas finally comes home. He’s late – later than Dean and Jimmy expected, at least – and he’s also just as shocked as they both thought he was going to be. Cas spots Dean right away and Jimmy is quick to capture Cas’s surprise. Cas doesn’t seem to be able to pick his jaw up from the floor and Jimmy wants to laugh but he
In the end, they went with taking a weekend off, and drove to a small property Dean had rented where they could stay for the entire weekend. Maybe it wasn’t as much a date as it was a full vacation for the three of them, but Dean pampered both Cas and Benny all weekend, making sure they were enjoying their stay and their time together.
With that, Dean hums and runs his fingers over Cas’s bare chest, just touching, nothing interesting yet. Cas doesn’t know how Dean is positioned or where he’s moving next, which makes for an interesting experience because he can’t see what Dean is about to do. It makes relaxing both easier and more difficult. He’s both not in control and dreads the fact that he isn’t, that he’s not sure what’s coming next. It’s… new but exciting, like the time Dean tied him up and he could
The first few minutes, or whatever amount of time passes, nothing happens, and Dean slowly relaxes into the quiet hum of electricity and nothingness. It’s surprisingly easy to let go once there’s nothing for him to focus on, and like the meditating he did before Cas walked in, it seems to come natural to him to just… drift. Vaguely, Dean feels surprised at how easily his mind quiets and calms down if there’s not external stimulants, but it’s only a vague and floating thought, although he should probably talk to Cas about using this as a way to calm him down if he’s overwhelmed and on the verge of a panic attack or anxiety attack, or just when he’s a little too stressed.
“Time is ticking, Dean. You’ve got five minutes, max. And I want to come too.”
The cuffs are of course Dean’s idea, too. He notices Jimmy looking at his arms and hands, which are bare save for the glitter and then brings out the golden cuffs they bought on a whim a while ago, and Jimmy helps fasten them, adding a few rings to Dean’s bare fingers. Jimmy’s fingers linger on Dean’s wedding ring, the one silver note in the entire set. He presses a soft kiss against the metal and then steps back, directing Dean into position again.
“Sure, dear,” Dean teases. “So… do you want to move this to the bedroom instead?”
They did talk, though, and it morphed into more. And here they are. At the Roadhouse again, years after their initial meeting. Dean is less shy when he moves into the booth from across Cas and takes his hand after ordering a beer and wings for the both of them.
movie, chèr?” Benny asks. He groans softly as Dean simply kisses him back. The kisses turn forceful and they’re rutting against each other soon, but then Dean pulls himself out of their embrace.
“I love you,” Dean blurts, and then he swallows. He’s never said that before, although Cas probably knows anyway. Cas has taught him how to love himself, but he’s still not quite as comfortable with the big declarations of love, so he’s shocked himself there too. He’s not sure what he expects Cas to say or do, but Cas’s eyes filling with tears… well, that isn’t at all what he expected.
Dean comes into the living room, and all Jimmy can do is gasp. Dean has foregone any of the panties Jimmy had laid out for him, instead he has chosen to just wear the harness. The golden straps compliment Dean’s freckles and flushed skin perfectly.
“Uh, hi,” Dean said as soon as Charlie had left him at the bar next to the blue-and-purple-haired, pierced man. Dean could admit to himself that he liked the look, but he wasn’t sure if he liked the personality too.
, while Benny just nods against his shoulder, and then there’s confetti being popped over them, and Dean looks up to see Sam looking surprised but happy. Jo is barely holding on but she looks less surprised than Dean expected, and well… maybe more people guessed the truth about Dean and Cas and Benny’s relationship, but here they are. Happy. In each other’s arms. With friends and family near. Because when Cas and Benny register that there’s clapping and more confeeti around, they actually look around and see their friends and family (as much as they were accepting, of course) in the Roadhouse, all applauding them, and that’s it. Dean knew they were the ones for him, but they’re happy, and so now he’s happy. He doesn’t even care that he can’t legally marry both of them, but he’ll settle for them being married in spirit, for them calling each other partners. All of the first dates leading to this moment have been so worth it. He wipes the tears from Cas’s eyes and helps push the ring onto his finger, and then he does the same for Benny before kissing the both of them.
"Uh… I can’t say I do, no. It always seemed rather complicated to me when I saw you playing that during parties." Castiel replied slowly, his blue and curious eyes fixed on Dean.
Castiel did not pay attention to the comment and watched Dean pour the last shot with special attention. He seemed to be much more focused than he wanted to appear until then, and Dean restrained a smile. Castiel had always been a competitor.
Fortunately for him, the opportunity had almost presented itself when Castiel came to live with them. Definitely, of course.
"You still have your socks. Why didn’t you take them off first anyway?" He asked, tilting his head one more time to the side.
"Strip poker works for me." Castiel cut off.
"Are you cold?" Castiel inquired, raising a curious eyebrow while the computer played a series, forgotten between them.
Meg’s research had still not yielded anything even a month after Castiel left the hospital. Although he was now alone again in his large apartment, there was something exhilarating about being able to live normally as if he had not nearly died a few months ago. Finding a job at the florist in his town had been the first step in his new life as he slowly resumed a normal social life with his friends and family.
Finally, after several minutes of silence, the nurse sighed dramatically.
"Okay
Castiel was still in hospital and in the recovery phase, but he was doing well and could be out very soon according to his doctors. He had seen the scar on his chest last week and he couldn’t help but cherish it. This mark was the sign that he had survived. The sign that he had the right to live longer and to continue to build his life away from the health problems that had accompanied him all his life.
Castiel closed his mouth in a discreet snap before taking his friend’s last words into consideration. Finally, he nodded again.
The arm that did not hold the blanket, for its part, went on a wander in search of a very different source of heat. When his fingers finally came into contact with warm and familiar skin in front of him, he smiled a little more. Castiel was sitting next to him, leaning on a pile of pillows against the headboard and staring at the computer between them. He was not much more dressed than Dean, but unlike his companion, he did not feel the need to cover up. Angels were not affected by temperature like humans. Also, Castiel was always temperate and, when Dean felt too chilly, he would snuggle to him in search of a human — or almost — radiator. Although, of course, Dean did not always wait to be cold to cuddle with Castiel.
Quickly, he arrived in the kitchen and began searching in the cupboard just below the central island.
"I hope so!" Meg said, setting up his lunch tray with a small smile." But at least it has the merit of giving you a little adventurous side. Did I ever tell you I have a thing for guys with chest scars?"
