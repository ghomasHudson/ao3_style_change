“It’s not a game, Dean. I’m so sorry, I really don’t know what came over me. I’ll let you go. I’m just- I’m so, so sorry.” Cas said, his face a picture of distress and regret.
Jacob plonked the container on the bench Cas was sitting on so that he had both hands free, and he started signing the word ‘share’ at them.
“So, what did His Excellency do this morning?”
“It’s the first anniversary of when I lost my brother. He was my twin and best friend. I guess I’m just struggling with that a little more than I anticipated. But honestly, I’m fine, you don’t have to waste your time with trying to talk to me,” the voice responded.
(See the end of the chapter for
“There were just… things. I wasn’t allowed to date, but there was more to it. I was told that he… No, It’s not my story to tell. I don’t hold it against him, and I know he would have done.” Cas scowled to himself briefly. “I honestly thought that with what I actually did, he would just hate me for a bit and then move on. How the hell was I ever that naïve? Dean is different.” Cas paused, dragging a finger up his mug to wipe up a drop of tea. “I should have known he was different. That
Charlie:
Once they had built the aquarium, Charlie asked Jacob to show her more of his PODD book and he patiently showed her each and every page while she listened to him with rapt attention. Charlie always took everything Jacob said very seriously. The things he talked about might seem like little things to other people but she knew that to Jacob, those little things
It’s not that Dean hasn’t been doing laundry, because he absolutely has. The issue is that he was only planning to be away from home for about four days, so he only had enough clothes for four days with him. Even with doing his laundry frequently, he felt like he was wearing the same three shirts over and over (because he was).
careful about not spilling his breakfast on it. At the time he’d thought Jacob was just protecting a shirt he loved, but clearly the teen had other ideas.
Cas is stone. He couldn’t move for anything right now, and he can’t tear his gaze from the stunning man in front of him. Dean is no longer the beautiful boy that he once knew, but the man he has become is somehow even more breathtaking to look at.
As he lay there waiting for his breathing to slow, he wondered why he’d had such an explicit and intense dream about Dean. Cas was pretty used to seeing Dean’s face in his sleep, but it hadn’t been since they first met that he’d had dreams where they’d each stripped the other naked and worshipped each other like that. With a frustrated sigh, he realized that his body was probably craving closeness with Dean, and his dreams were the outlet it was using to protest their continued distance.
Dean packed up his stuff, tossed his bags into the trunk of the car, then placed his guitar carefully on the back seat. He then headed straight on over to the coffee shop. It was a pretty short drive but somehow Charlie was already inside and had claimed a table for them. She waved him on over.
“I, uh- yeah, he lives with him. He- uh, yeah. He does,” she finished, somewhat lamely.
“Okay. Well, thank you so much for tonight. You were amazing as always! I’ll speak to you soon,” she said with a smile.
Dean:
“Well… okay, honestly I didn’t think you’d mind seeing him. And with Cas, I just thought it would be better if he didn’t have the chance to freak out about it and get inside his own head. I figured he’d be fine once he got over the initial shock. All that stuff happened so long ago, and you’re both in such different places in your lives now.” She glanced back towards the door. “But, Dean, I really can’t get into this. I’m worried about Cas and the way he just took off like that. I haven’t seen him get so worked up over something in… I don’t know. A long time. Fuck, I feel like such a dick.”
The song Dean sings is called No Witnesses by Keaton Henson. It’s absolutely stunning and if you haven’t heard any of this precious human’s work, I highly recommend you go do so! He’s breathtaking.
“Okay, I saw him having breakfast with Jacob earlier and I kind of gave a waitress my number on a note and asked her to give it to Cas,” he admitted.
“Deal,” she concedes. She then turns around and marches through the bar towards her apartment upstairs, not even checking to see if Dean is actually following her.
“You’re right. I get it, and I’m sorry. This is a disaster and I really should have seen it coming. But... I have to go find him, Dean. I’m really sorry to leave you like this, but please stay and have a drink or whatever. I’ll see you later?”
“Oh, for fuck’s sake, I’m getting all misty eyed over here! I love that boy so damn much!” Her voice did sound a bit thick as she said the last part. “He melts my heart, Cas.”
“I can’t really leave the street. Jacob is in bed and I need to keep the house in view.”
He saw when Cas picked up a napkin and shook his head in a half-adoring, half-exasperated way. He saw him lean across the table and take Jacob’s face gently in one hand. He saw when he tenderly and lovingly wiped syrup from Jacob’s face.
” from a song near the end of his set that it hit him he was looking for Cas. He knew Cas wouldn’t be there, he had made sure of that when he told Charlie he wouldn’t play unless that was the case, but he couldn’t help the twinges of disappointment that filled him when he couldn’t see those brighter-than-the-sky blue eyes staring back at him from the crowd.
A voice broke through the silence of the night around him. It wasn’t loud, but it was unexpected enough to startle, and it sounded quite familiar.
snark at me!” Cas exclaims while pacing the living room, one hand twisted into his hair in exasperation. He had eventually managed to convince Jacob to get dressed, but not before he’d stunned Cas into silence with his cheek, quickly followed by Cas abruptly leaving the room so he could laugh without Jacob seeing and thinking it would be funny to carry on being stubbornly defiant.
He didn’t bother even trying to slow down or hold back as the heat pooled in his stomach, and within moments he was panting through his climax, whimpering Dean’s name into the dark.
Dean is going to perform here this one time, then he’s going to run from this town and never look back.
“I gotta take a drink over to the performer, I think he’s a bit nervous. He’s never seemed nervous in any of the videos I’ve watched of him online, but maybe he’s just good at covering it or something because that boy is
it strange to offer to buy someone else’s kid a shirt? He hadn’t seen Jacob in years… but at one point he’d been pretty close with the kid, so it couldn’t be that weird, right?
“Doctor who?”
Dean had been playing around with a melody for the lyrics he wrote earlier. His eyes were red and puffy, and his face was stinging from the salt of his tears. He was finally getting somewhere though, and the music and lyrics were slowly coming together.
, he thought.
They laugh together for a moment, and Cas is once again struck by thankfulness toward his best friend for always being there when he is having some kind of panic. He has a tendency to panic, so it’s happened a lot and she’s never once made him feel like a burden to her. He thanks her for reassuring him that it’s okay to laugh sometimes, says he’s looking forward to seeing her later, and gets off the phone.
“Theme nights? Dean interrupted. “Oh God, Charlie! Please don’t tell me you host karaoke nights. Please. I don’t think my soul could take it.”
“You know what, Charles? I’m really fucking proud of you.”
“It took me a lot of years and a lot of pouring my heart out into songs while buried at the bottom of a bottle to realize that it said more about you than it did about me. You’re the one who lied to me. You’re the one who claimed you felt things that you clearly didn’t feel to lead me on. For what? Huh? Was it to pass some time before you went to college? You know what, don’t answer that. I’m done. I’m fucking done,” Dean scoffed.
“Cas! Look, PODD book helps! It’s good!”
“She talks about you a lot too, Dean. Always goin’ on about how proud she is of you for doing so well. You can see how much she cares, and how much she misses you. Honestly I can’t believe I only just met you ‘cause I feel like I’ve known you for years with how often she goes on ‘bout you.”
The first time it happened, Dean was embarrassed. He couldn’t help it! His neighbor had heard Dean singing and had started humming along with the song. Dean could hear him humming with near-perfect clarity, and his heart just about dropped out his ass. He wasn’t aware that the walls in his new apartment were so damn thin that his neighbor could hear EVERYTHING through them.
His phone was silent for a good while and Cas wondered if he’d screwed up enough this time for even Charlie to despair of him. He moved over to the couch and slumped into the cushions, crooking an arm over his face and trying to drown out all thought.
Dean thought.
Cas thought for a moment, obviously weighing up the pros and cons of having an extra pair of eyes against having to spend time with Dean.
“Of course it did, Dean. You loved him. He was your first love and it ended badly. It’s okay that it shook you, and it’s okay that you still have some empathy for him when you see him unsettled. Kinda shows what a big, soft heart you have,” she said with a kind smile.
“I don’t know if you saw but there was a man sitting by the window,” she said, holding a piece of paper in her hands. “He was real pretty with green eyes? He just left, but he asked me to give you this.” She put the paper on the table and Cas eyed it warily.
“It’s not your fault. None of it is your fault, and it never was. It was all to do with me and things that I was going through.” Cas said, trying to keep his voice steady. “If you want to talk about it, I would really like to do that. I want to be honest and tell you everything, truly, I do.” His eyes were wide and shined with sincerity.
~Blucifer
“Okay, I’m not going to ask anything, but is it okay if I sit with you for a while? Just until you feel ready to talk or want to leave or whatever?”
Pain doesn’t hurt any less if you choose it yourself. When the only choices you have are bad ones and you make the one you think is best for everyone, the knowledge that you did what you could doesn’t stop your own heart from breaking. Especially when you know you caused so much destruction in the lives of others... in the lives of people you loved.
“Okay, go do that. I’m gonna get Benny to announce the live act. It’s only two minutes before he’s due on, so get him to down that quick.”
He was still mulling over what Charlie had said but was undecided about whether or not he wanted to give Cas a chance to explain himself. On the one hand he might finally get answers to questions that have been plaguing him for years, but on the other, he wasn’t sure if he was ready to face what those answers might mean. They could end up hurting him even more, raise more questions, or they could even make him feel some kind of sympathy toward Cas. He didn’t want to be in a situation where he was tempted to forgive Cas, not just yet anyway. There were also many questions that had been raised since his arrival in town and getting some answers to those would be great too. Ugh. His head started spinning again. Okay, he really needed to stop thinking about Cas for a bit. He had a plan and he was going to stick to it. First breakfast, then work.
As the caffeine flooded his system and the ibuprofen kicked in, he began to feel a little more human. He could even look out the window without hissing at the sun like a vampire from a 60s horror movie.
. Not in this life,” Dean insisted.
“I have a joke,” Jacob announced once he had demolished his way through his food. “Knock knock!”
“It felt a lot like it does with you, actually. The ease of it, I mean. It’s was a lot more natural and comfortable than it is with anyone else, except maybe you.”
Jacob screwed up his face in concentration as he slowly and carefully picked up the sopping wet bread and transferred it to the pan. “Look, Cas! I did it this time! No splashes!” His face was lit with an ecstatic glow, and Cas’s heart melted a little. All annoyance from having to take a second shower today instantly dissolved. Jacob had to work a hell of a lot harder to reach his goals and learn new things, so when he succeeded there was so much more to celebrate. Learning to cook French toast was absolutely fantastic, and despite his teasing he was really pleased that Charlie had caught the whole thing on video. She continued to film him until the entire stack of bread had been transformed into the finished product. It looked a little messy, and some bits were more cooked than others, but Jacob made the entire thing himself with only minimal adult input.
“My other concern is if Dean takes it badly, which is likely - because let’s face it, I was a dick - he’s going to end up leaving town again… so while I think it will be awesome if it all goes well, I don’t want to tell Jacob
people.” She threw an exaggerated glare at Dean so that he would know she was ribbing.
Jacob opened the book to a page near the beginning and pointed at the word “I” before flipping a few more pages over. Charlie caught on immediately and said “I” out loud. The next word Jacob pointed at was “want,” and again Charlie said the word. By the time Jacob got to the section on activities and places, he almost had a full sentence created. When he pointed at the last word, Charlie grinned at him.
“’Kay. Later, Red,” Dean said. He then hung up the phone and went back to work on his song some more. If he kicked his ass into gear, he knew he could finish it before bed.
“You want your character to build an aquarium?” She asked. “Should we build a big pool made of glass and put some fish and the squid in it?”
“Yes, please!” Jacob enthused.
It’s only in the early hours of the following morning that he allowed himself to admit that he was now actively looking for excuses to stay in town a bit longer; but he had to hand it to himself that as far as excuses go, this is a pretty damn good one.
Charlie:
He sees the small café that Ellen and Bobby used to run before they’d packed up and left town to retire, before even Dean himself had left. It was still open and running, but with faces he didn’t recognize in the place that he’d known so well. He walked past the bakery where he and Cas had once bought eclairs, only to make such a huge mess eating them that they’d dissolved into having a frenzied make-out session while they licked each other clean. There was the record store he’d dragged Cas into after discovering his abysmal taste in music. The place was now half record store, half coffee shop which Dean thought was kind of a cool venture. He makes a mental note to check it out on his way back past.
the big things, and that made those things big to her, too.
Dean was stunned by what had just transpired. He had been so caught up in how it had felt to catch sight of Cas when he wasn’t expecting it, and how it was going to affect him to see Cas properly after all this time, that it never occurred to him that Cas himself might find it difficult to be in the same room as him. But he worked here, so he must have known that Dean was the one performing, right? Or had Charlie hidden it from him too? Gods, this was already a mess.
“Wait. Why would he blame himself?”
“Yeah,” Dean said, awkwardly. “Is everything okay? Do you need help or something?”
He waved to her as he backed up toward the door, then he turned and stepped out into the cool night air. It really was a beautiful night. Cold, but not too cold, and hardly any clouds so the stars were in view for Dean to admire as he walked.
They order Chinese food, grab a couple of beers, and Dean asks Charlie how things are in her life. She tells him how she ended up with the bar, explaining that originally she’d just been working there but began instigating all these theme nights and was made manager for her efforts.
“Hey, Benny! Goo’t’ see ya,” Dean forced out, grinning around the huge mouthful of food. He swallowd and then tried talking again. “Have you tried this? Because you wouldn’t be making fun of me if you’d had it. It’s like angels dancing on your damn tongue.”
“You’re preparing yourself though, right? Dean is a forgiving person, but like I said, you made a choice that hugely affected his life and didn’t consult him on it. Whatever reasons are behind that, he’s not gonna be happy about it, and he’s likely going to be pissed off with you because it just wasn’t your choice to make. Not for him.”
“YES!” Jacob burst out, sliding down the bench of the booth a little as he lost himself to a giggling fit.
“We should be looking for this
“Have you thought more about what you’re going to say to him tomorrow? You don’t have to tell me, just- I’m here to listen if you need me.”
As he got closer, he saw Cas crouched next to a bush. On the other side of the driveway from where Cas was bending over, a very visible “Novak” was painted on the mailbox.
And for a moment, Dean wondered, as he had done many times over the years, if he meant that. Did he still wish he could burn away the sight of Cas? To burn away the memories of the time they had together? It would be easier to live with and he had definitely wanted that in the past, sure, but is that what he genuinely wanted now? Dean didn’t know.
“He’s such a little star.” Charlie said with a grin. Then her face took on a more serious expression. “Hey, Cas? Can I ask you one more question?”
Anyone else want to hug the crap out of Dean and Jacob? Just me?
“No... He can’t be that oblivious to the fact that I was completely gone on him! You don’t just move on from a love like that. He might not have felt it or whatever, but he must have known that I absolutely
“Pull up a chair and order this fucking burger, Benny.”
gotten some stuff written, thank you very much. I’m just a bit behind because of all the mental distractions. Also, I’m expecting a pizza any second and I’d much rather be eatin’ that than gettin’ shit from you,” he grumbled.
He headed out into the bright sunlight, thinking about the pancakes and bacon he was going to have in order to fuel his day of writing. Once he arrived at the diner, he seated himself at a table by the door and placed his order without even having to glance at the menu. While waiting for his food he read through his emails, saving the ones that were requests for him to perform so he could respond to them later.
“Ahhhhhhh! I love you, Charlie!” He yelled, flinging his arms around her waist. She pressed a kiss to his brownish-blond curls and hugged him back as tightly as she could. Jacob wriggled free and ran out of the room, mumbling something about telling Jack.
Castiel’s dreams were often about Dean. The ones he could remember had always filled him with pain and guilt. He had relived the way Dean’s face fell and the tears he cried during the moment of their breakup so many times over the years, and the last couple of weeks had increased that number exponentially. He’d heard Dean screaming at him in anger and betrayal, the hurt strewn across his face and marring his otherwise stunning features. He would wake up damp from sweat, the screams still echoing in his ears, clutching his chest, and wishing with all his heart that he could go back to that night and change the way he’d left things.
(See the end of the chapter for
The third, fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh times it happened, Dean had initiated it and even picked well known duet songs to make their weird little ritual work even better.
“And you’re just as easy to annoy as ever,” he retorted. Then he smiled at her, his eyes going soft. “I’ve missed you, kiddo.”
As Cas kissed him, it was exactly as he remembered their kisses feeling, only this kiss was filled with hunger and desperation. Cas moved his tongue gently across Dean’s lower lip, and Dean opened his mouth to allow their tongues to join. The languid dance between their tongues was sending sparks of fire throughout Dean’s entire body. The taste of Cas was intoxicating, and Dean would have sworn he could feel himself becoming dizzy from the flavor alone. He wound his hand tighter around Cas’s waist, if only to gather some strength and stop his knees from buckling.
“I love how sociable that boy is. I’ve never seen someone with so much sunshine in their smile. Ya know, it
“And I’m in there?”
He decided that going clothes shopping was a necessity if he was going to stay here much longer. Seeing as how he kept finding excuse after excuse to not leave town, well, clothes shopping was what he was going to do.
“Putting it in the pan is hard. I did it too quickly the first time, but Charlie is really clever and showed me how to do it properly. You were in the shower. She’s so smart,” he proclaimed.
Cas laughed with him and told him that was a brilliant joke, but inside he was trying to stop himself from crying with happiness. Jacob was able to remember the entire thing and was able to tell it to Cas. He was telling real jokes now! It thrilled Cas, and he was completely overcome with pride in his little cousin. He managed to hold himself together and when Jacob’s head reappeared from beneath the table he pointed at Jacob’s chin.
you! He’d be super heckin’ thrilled.”
He cried as he wrote out the words. Crying while writing was nothing new to him, he often teared up while writing songs. It’s just he hadn’t had one that caused him to cry like this since about a year after he and Cas had broken up. Back then he used to want to smash everything in sight as soon as he read over what he’d written and was confronted by his own lyrics, but this was different. There was no anger, no rage... This was a hollow, aching emptiness. Seeing Cas again, seeing him be so sweet with a child, had ripped Dean open without him even realizing. It was like he had been sitting and watching the life he’d wanted but would never have with Cas being performed right in front of him. It hurt more than he ever imagined it would.
With each word, he felt his heart accepting and embracing the events of the night. He was crying, but allowed himself that, knowing that he always wrote his best pieces when his emotions were raw and unrelenting. Anger layered on top of heartbreak and confusion had wrecked him to his core, and this time it felt like there would be no coming back from it. He had spent so many years trying to push the memory of Cas as far from his mind as possible, and in one night he had effectively torn the seal on those memories. They weren’t just from the distant past, now they were blended with fresh ones. He could still smell Cas on his jacket, could still feel Cas’s hand on his face, could still taste him on his lips. And the part that hurt the most was how
“What’s funny?” Cas asked.
Charlie pulled him into a hug.
He was definitely curious about the man behind the (shower) curtain, but was a little worried that if they met face to face, this tentative arrangement they had going on might feel too awkward to continue. Putting a face to the voice could make it a bit too real, and Dean wasn’t ready to give it up. It had weirdly become quite important to him.
“Yeah, yeah. I’ve missed you, too. So, what do you think? Wanna play another night for me?” She said while batting her eyelashes in an over-the-top way.
to get ahold of himself or he was going to start spiraling. He picked up his Mindfulness rock that he stored on his desk, focused on it,  and continued to breathe steadily.
Charlie playfully smacked his arm. “Dammit, Dean! You haven’t changed at all, have you? Just as irritating as ever.”
Leaving Jacob to play LEGO Marvel Heroes, Charlie waited until Cas was seated with a cup of tea before bringing up the idea of Dean playing for Jacob’s birthday.
“I’ve gotta say, I was wondering why I kept getting texts from you saying you were extending your visit,” Sam said, a teasing lilt to his voice. “So tell me, how are you feeling about Cas now?”
Charlie:
“Could you please text Dean on Saturday morning to make sure he’s okay after hearing everything I have to say? I’m more concerned for him than I am for myself if things don’t go well.”
Dean finished his shower with a huge grin on his face. He had to admit that it was kind of fun. He wasn’t even sure which neighbor it was, but he loved the sound of their voice. Slightly raspy, but deep and had a bit of power to it.
A silence followed for a few moments, and Dean worried he’d pushed too far on this. He really didn’t know the guy, and maybe he should rescind the offer or...
“I get it, Charlie. You don’t have to say anything you’re not comfortable saying. To be honest I’m more confused than anything, but that’s not really anything new when it comes to Cas. I get why seeing me after so long might have struck a nerve with him, but I don’t understand why he looked so upset. It’s been seven years and he left me. I just- I keep seeing his face in my mind. Even after all this time and everything he put me through, seeing him distressed like that? It hurt.”
“Absolutely. You know what he’s like. Any excuse to get his hands on a controller.”
it felt. It had always felt incredible to kiss Cas, but after 7 years of pining for it? It was like air to a man drowning.
“Well, we talked about his birthday which is coming up really soon. I asked him what he wanted for it and he told me that he wants a
“Hey kiddo, I gotta take off. I’m tired and to be honest I’m feeling a little emotionally exposed right now. Is it cool for me to leave my car here and grab it in the morning? I think I’ve had one too many to drive so I’m going to just walk back to the hotel.”
Seriously, the more I write of Jacob (even if he’s not in the scene and is just being spoken about) the more I want to hug him 😅
After his chat with Benny, Dean felt like he could do with some more socializing because being around other people was feeling pretty fucking great. It wasn’t something he usually allowed himself to do, and at that moment he couldn’t think of a single reason why he should continue in that way.
“I always knew you were a good human underneath it all,” Cas sighs in relief.
Cas looked at her and nodded.
He was becoming more able to keep his emotions near the surface in a healthy manner, too. Dean was very familiar with needing constant access to his feelings as it helped him as a writer, but often it meant that they spilled out when he was least expecting. Sometimes they were suddenly unloading at inopportune moments. Because of this, he often avoided conversation with others in case things got deep enough to scratch the thin surface. He was much better at talking about them than he used to be when he was younger, though. Writing his feelings so often had caused him to not be
Charlie:
“Sure. Later, Charlie.”
this whole unending conversation about Jacob’s favorite singer and respective merch. Now he was going to have to wait until after the bus came before he could finally sit down for breakfast and take care of his own needs. Such is the life of a parent, biological or otherwise.
He bit into his burger and couldn’t help the groan that followed.
“I promise, we can listen to as much Danny Gruff as you want once you get home from school, but for right now you really need to put your uniform on. Your bus is going to be here within the next ten minutes.” Cas knew they were going in circles and couldn’t see a way out of it. His brain wasn’t performing at full capacity thanks to the lack of sleep. He wouldn’t be surprised if Jacob’s head suddenly turned into a giant coffee cup with how badly he was craving caffeine to give him a little boost. He’d woken up with barely enough time to grab a cup as it was, and that was
“Maybe we should try the next street over?” Dean suggested. “It’s not like a cat wouldn’t stray too far, waiting to get picked up and taken home.”
His phone pings almost immediately.
They were both smiling into the kiss, neither daring to stop or speak lest this moment come to an end. Dean’s fingers moved to the hair at the top of Cas’s neck and he continued moving his fingers in soft circles. His hair was exactly as soft as Dean remembered, and Dean felt crazy with the need to keep touching it.
know that Jacob lived with him? If he already knew, then all Cas had to do was explain how it came about and the reasons behind it. It might be a little less shocking for Dean if he already had an inkling.
“Yes, I know about Rowena. Sam and I don’t talk much anymore but he still checks in once a year or so. Unlike
Dean moved over to the bed so that he could lie down for what he was about to say. He didn’t want to say these words out loud, but he knew he really needed to so that Charlie could better understand why he was so panicked.
He poured the boiled water into a mug with a tea bag and took it over to his kitchen table. Staring at a small crack in the wall, he forced himself for the first time in years to consider how much he’d affected Dean. He’d always assumed that Dean would have just eventually moved on and fallen in love with someone else, and even though he occasionally listened to Dean’s music, he had
Charlie sat down next to him and wrapped an arm around his shoulders.
“You really need to talk to Cas, Dean,” she said finally. “This isn’t my story to tell, and the rest of it absolutely needs to come from Cas. Give him the chance to explain and ask him all the questions you’re bursting to ask me right now. You want to talk to him, we both know that, so let all of this come from him instead. It’ll help you both, I’m sure of it.”
Cas.”
“Charlie, how long has Jacob been living with Cas?”
Once he’d relieved himself and ascertained that he wasn’t going to puke, he went and sat back down in bed to drink a bottle of water and take some ibuprofen. The water settled his queasy stomach, and he began to feel like he might be up to taking a shower at some point in the near future.
Dean orders a coffee, and while he waits for it to arrive, he powers up his phone to see who might have been trying to contact him while he’d been living in his own little world. The first thing he sees is a message from Charlie that had come last night asking him if he was okay and saying she was there if he needed to talk. Judging by the timestamp, it must have come while he was in the midst of his rage-induced writing incident. Hmm. Cas must have said something to her. Wanting to put her out of her worries, he responds to her message.
“Fuck you and your bullshit apologies. You can’t possibly understand what my life has been like, Cas,” he bit out. “I was broken when you left me. It wasn’t something I ever thought I would get over, and if I’m honest the pain is still there. I’ve just learned to live with it. You broke everything about me!” Dean was no longer nearly crying; Instead he was filled with seven years of anger that had never before been directed at the right person. “I don’t date. I haven’t even bothered trying. Sure, I tell people it’s because I’m always on the road and I don’t have time, but the truth is that I don’t fucking trust anyone anymore. I don’t even trust myself to be good enough to hold on to anyone. I don’t trust myself to be someone that someone else could love”
Jacob’s face popped into his mind and he immediately knew what he was going to make. Cas moved around the kitchen, grabbing ingredients and a bowl as he went. As he reached into the cupboard that contained the waffle iron, he heard the door to the kitchen open.
Cas all but fell through his front door with Gabriel tucked precariously under his arm. He’d found the cat curled up and asleep inside a tire swing in someone’s front yard, and while he was filled with relief that his cat was okay and he wouldn’t have to have an upsetting conversation with Jacob the following morning, his heart felt heavier than steel. Gabriel jumped down and headed on over to his food bowl, completely unaware of the mess Cas had gotten himself into thanks to Gabe’s bid for freedom.
He remembered how it felt to be wrapped in Cas’s arms, dreaming of the future life he hoped they would have together. They would talk about what that future would look like, sharing kisses and holding each other close. Cas would teach their children art, and Dean would teach them how to work on cars and play guitar. They had even spoken about how it was ridiculous to be having conversations like that given that they hadn’t even been together for all that long, but had both brushed it aside as inconsequential in relation to how they felt about each other.
Dean:
Okay, this was kind of awesome. Dean decided to throw caution to the wind and sing along with him.
“Okay, fine. I’m still struggling with Dean being around, but at the same time it feels pretty good… and honestly, that’s scaring the crap out of me,” Cas admitted, his voice low and his eyes staring at the edge of the mug where the string from the teabag was dangling over. “I know my reaction that first night was over the top, but that was mainly because it was a surprise I wasn’t expecting. It was a lot to handle. I’m better now though, I promise.”
He was tempted to just leave, but the waitress brought his food over and it smelled so damn good. Dean was strong, but not strong enough to walk away from bacon. He thanked her, then went back to watching Cas and Jacob who had seated themselves over in a booth and as far as Dean was aware, hadn’t noticed him.
“I’d like to see you resist that kid. His smile is made of sunbeams, and you’re gonna be hit with it so damn hard. A singer he loves handing him a shirt with things he loves on it? Ha. You’re so screwed.” She laughed, but her face was shining with adoration over the teen.
“Oh yeah? How’s that?” Dean asks, humouring her.
He couldn’t very well just keep standing here, and he was too close to the hotel to want to go back for his car or to call a taxi. Plus, it sounded like Cas was looking for some kind of animal, so he didn’t really have the option of just standing here and waiting for Cas to go inside. It was likely that Cas would come this direction in his search for the animal, anyway. Defeated by his own logic, Dean took a deep breath and kept on walking.
Images started flashing through his mind before he could get a firm grasp on them or stop them in their tracks. The police coming. The social workers. The doctors. The lawyers. The background checks. Those
“I know,” Charlie agreed. “I swear it was just yesterday he was this tiny eight-year-old who insisted on sleeping nude and never allowed a door to be open for longer than the time it took someone to walk through it. Now look at him.” She let out a contented sigh. “What are the plans for his 16th birthday, anyways?”
“Can it with the sarcasm, Winchester. I might smite you. Now, get off the damn phone and go sort your shit.”
Seeing Cas being so nurturing and loving towards a child had him doubting himself and whether what he’d written in that note was the truth. Was he actually ready to talk? He thought about the hurt he’d experienced when all the dreams and hopes for the future had been ripped from him. If he was honest with himself, that’s what caused the loss to be that much more excruciating, turning it into something he’d always struggled to move past. It wasn’t just the love of his life that he’d lost; he lost his best and most trusted friend, an entire future they’d been planning together, and he lost someone he never thought he could lose. His trust in others and in himself had been shattered to pieces in the process.
“We sure are,” Charlie confirms. “You know he has a loyal fan club of like ten people now. Which is pretty impressive when you consider that we don’t post online or anything. Can’t let them go on waiting forever, can we?”
She smiled at him sympathetically and reaches out to grasp his hand.
“I didn’t know whether to laugh or cry, Charlie,” he bursts as soon as she’s done with greeting him. “He was upset with me because I wouldn’t let him wear that Danny Gruff shirt to school, which of course, in Jacob’s opinion, was the meanest thing in the entire universe. He was arguing back and forth, we were running late because I’d overslept, and I snapped a little and told him I didn’t want to hear another word out of him until he was ready for school. And this ridiculous kid, he starts
“What?” Cas asked when he noticed where her attention was, his eyes wide and his head tilted in confusion.
Dean turned off the water with his face so red that a tomato might be jealous, and went to get dressed to start his day.
“Sure, Dean,” Sam replied. Dean could almost hear the teasing eye roll.
“You have got to lay off
He would offer to play for Jacob’s birthday if that’s what they want.
“It’s nothing like hearing them performed by him live and in the flesh,” she gushed, her eyes almost dazed with passion for her friend’s art. “The way he sings his lyrics with so much emotion behind them? It’s like you can tell that he’s truly feeling everything he’s singing about. He doesn’t just remind you of a time you felt those things, he forces you as the listener to experience the emotions with him.”
“Dean - I don’t - I didn’t mean,” Cas began.
“Awww c’mon, Sammy, don’t do this to me.” Sam responded with silence. “Ughh, fine. Honestly… it was really great talkin’ to him last night,” Dean rushed out, clearly nervous about admitting such a thing. “I haven’t felt that kind of easiness with anyone else. But that’s just how things always were with Cas. We always just kinda got each other, y’know? And it’s nice… havin’ someone get you without explaining yourself all the damn time. But I’m not stupid enough to let a little easy conversation make me wanna relive the heartbreak.”
He had also seen them red, swollen, and with tears clinging to those preposterously long lashes on the night he had told him he was leaving. He had felt the guilt in his gut, knowing that he had been the one to cause that anguished look in them.
Dean spent the next half hour spilling to Sam about pretty much everything that had happened since he got to town a couple of weeks ago. He told him everything, even the parts that didn’t make him sound too great. Sam listened to Dean’s explanation with genuine interest, and as always was understanding to Dean’s plight. After hearing the entirety of Dean’s story, he let out a long, slow exhale.
While waiting for the mask to set, he busied himself with clipping his nails down, making a note of what toiletries he was running low on, and organizing his music and lyric notes. He separated them by which song each of them corresponded to, and kept the notes that could really only be described as prose off to one side. They might end up in a song one day, they might not, but some of them were nice to read so he wanted to hang on to them just in case.
Thinking that it would be completely fruitless to point out the fact that at school he would have no way of playing any of the songs for his friends, Cas kept quiet about it. Jacob wasn’t a fan of logic that didn’t fit his desires.
as my boyfriend. I actually shouted it at him,” Cas finished. The look on his face continued to betray the remorse he felt over the reprehensible act he had committed in his efforts to do what was right in an impossible situation.
Cas stood up and put his hands in his pocket. He turned his entire body to face Charlie, and after a few moments of looking at her in silence, he simply nodded.
He stepped out into the fresh air, cursing himself for not having sunglasses with him, and heads to the diner that he’d been to nearly every day this week. He didn’t even have to look at the menu anymore and was able to give his order to the waitress the moment she made it over to his table.
“Would you like me to read it with you and help you with any words you get stuck on?” Charlie asked Jacob.
“No. He doesn’t. I know Dean well enough to know that he would have fought for us. He would have said that it didn’t change how he felt about me, that we could raise Jacob together, that he would stay away but wait for me until the two years were up and I could be in a relationship without risking residence. I couldn’t do that to him. I couldn’t ask that of him and telling him the truth was as good as asking him, because he’d have done it without hesitation.” Cas took a deep breath, his face twisting into an expression of regret and self-loathing. “I uhh- I kind of told him that I didn’t want him at all. He asked me if I just didn’t want to be tied down while I was getting my art degree, or if I thought he would be a distraction. He thought I was trying to get space because I was 21 and only just starting college and wanted to take it as seriously as I could. But I needed him to back down, not fight, and not ask questions... so I told him that it wasn’t that I didn’t want a boyfriend, it was that I specifically didn’t want
Jacob had been in a bright and wonderful mood the whole way through breakfast so far, and he was unaware of the internal struggle that Cas was experiencing. He talked about his friends, his school, and about a YouTuber he loved. Cas listened to Jacob, hung on to every word to keep himself in the conversation and not halfway across the room. Jacob made it easy. He was able to convey so much passion in his words that eventually Cas found himself interested in the plot of some of the YouTube stories, purely because they gripped Jacob so much and he wanted to be a part of that. He wanted to be involved in whatever had sparked Jacob’s imagination, even if it did happen to be Minecraft characters that he didn’t even know existed.
Dean:
“You’re definitely human. You’re even under the ‘people’ section in Jacob’s new PODD book.”
Much love
“Fuck!” He was going to have to go buy a new charger today. Apparently during his drunken rage, he’d tried to plug in his phone with just a tad too much vigor. The cable was almost completely ripped open near the end, and the wires within were exposed and frayed. The phone, of course, was completely dead.
They worked on their project for about twenty minutes before it was done, and they had just started discussing what the next thing should be when the first signs of Jacob getting frustrated began to hit. He was repeating the same word over and over, getting more and more worked up when Charlie couldn’t understand what he was saying. He tried signing the word to her, but Charlie wasn’t familiar with the sign he was using.
Dean:
He pulled his phone out of his pocket and erased at least six messages before figuring out what he should say to her.
Yes, his dreams were often of Dean. He had dreamed of him several times since he’d first seen him again, but mostly these ones had been hazy and difficult to place. The dream that had just woken him up, however, was vivid and so different to the ones that had come before. They were filled with soft touches, Dean’s hands raking through Cas’ hair, and Cas pressing his fingers into the curve of Dean’s hips. He could almost smell the scent of Dean’s shampoo, and it left him hungry for more. The room in his mind was brimming with quiet moans falling from Dean’s lips. Those lips would then abruptly be colliding with Cas’s own, causing an electric current to run through Cas’s body. Every pause in their kissing resulted in shared breaths, which only heightened the intimacy of the moment. Dean’s kisses moved over to the bolt of Cas’s jaw, then pressed their way down his neck. He lightly sucked at his pulse point and Cas felt his body shiver from the sensation. As Dean moved his hands lower, trailing his fingers through the hair on Cas’s stomach, Cas was needy with anticipation. Cas moved his hands to the front of Dean’s boxers and tugged them until they were pooled at his feet. Dean followed suit, and soon Cas was divulged of his clothing too.
“I don’t know, Charlie. I get what you’re saying, and I trust you to not ask me to do something that’s going to end up with me in a worse place than I am right now… but I’m honestly chicken shit. Seeing him last night was so fucking hard. It was hard because it was so easy. Yeah, it was a bit awkward at first but we fell back into our old patterns of talking and teasing so quick it was like being slapped back into being twenty-one and in love. I can’t afford to feel or think like that.”
Draining the last of his tea, he realized that Dean was likely upset, angry, and alone. The thought sent him into a mild panic, and his breathing became fast and shallow.
Dean awoke in his hotel room after a restless night’s sleep. Images from the previous night had wormed their way into his dreams, and the clearest of those images was the haunted look on Cas’s face before he had turned and left the bar. His mind’s fixation on that look was bothering Dean. He wasn’t the one who walked away. He wasn’t the one who broke what they had; that had been all Cas… so why the hell was Cas the one who couldn’t stand to be in the same room as him? Why did he feel so much hurt seeing Cas looking – for lack of a more fitting word - distraught?
“Can it with the smug looks or I’m gonna go drink in that corner over there.”
“Oh yeah? Didn’t feel like that at the time,” he said.
Bracing himself, he picked up his phone and opened the messaging app where Cas had texted him earlier. After a couple of minutes of typing out messages only to delete the entire block of text and start over, he finally hit send.
more stressed than usual. How is that even possible?” She asked him.
There was the park where they’d fallen asleep side by side on the grass. Cas had declared that he could find as many constellations in Dean’s freckles as he could in the sky and then pinned Dean down so he could attack him with a pen to prove his point. They’d both laughed until they were breathless, then fallen asleep clutching one another. He walked through, assaulted by memories so vivid he could almost feel Cas’s weight against him.

~Blucifer
“Oh, God. Thanks for the reminder, Charlie! I had successfully wiped that part of the day out of my brain.”
“That’s right, Jacob! Now flip it over to the other side, make sure that side has just as much batter on it, then toss it in the pan!” Charlie says, with pride evident in every word she uttered.
“I know he’s not, Charlie. That’s the part that kills me.” He moves over to the couch and throws himself onto it. “So, can we do that thing where we don’t have to talk about Cas or the kiss or the yelling, now?”
Dean:
“You could play at the bar again on Friday night? Please? You were so great, and I got incredible feedback about you. Plus, you made a few people cry and that made them buy more drinks. It’s good for business.”
Charlie:
“Charlie, that’s such a great idea! Thank you, really. He’s going to be so thrilled.”
Noticing that someone had refilled the selection of drinks packets and added a hot chocolate to the mix, he made one of those and sighed as the drink warmed him from the inside. He dried off, pulled on a pair of boxers to sleep in, brushed his teeth, and climbed into bed.
so closed off with people, and for the first time he was really seeing the benefits to that practice as long as it was around people he trusted. Opening up to other people, even in small ways, was helping Dean keep his head on straight. He also just loved having genuine friends in his life, ones that weren’t just people he had to be around because of his job.
“Your neighbor’s dog? That Nula?”
He finished his speech and turned to face Charlie, his eyes imploring her to understand.
“I already ordered drinks. Figured you’d still be a strong black coffee kinda guy,” Charlie said with a grin that didn’t quite make it to her eyes.
His nostrils flared slightly as he turned to glare at Charlie, then he dragged his eyes back to Dean’s for one last glance before doing what he knew he had no choice but to.
As the song ended, Dean looked up at the crowd one more time. He locked into a stare with the tall, dark-haired man in the back, and they held each other’s gaze for a small eternity. The crowd clapped, completely unaware of the time-stopping moment going on between two people who once meant everything to each other.
Dean was a little shocked by the ease and openness Cas spoke about Jacob with. It made him want to start asking the questions that had arisen during his talk with Charlie, but ultimately he knew it would be better to wait until they could really talk it out. There were too many related questions he needed to ask, and even just bringing that one subject to the surface would send them down that path that was way too deep for their current conversation. Dean had waited years to figure all this out, he could wait a few more days. The subject of Jacob in a casual way, however,  didn’t feel like it would be too bad of an idea to discuss. He had adored that kid back in the day, and Dean really did want to know how he was doing.
“You’re worth it, and I know it wasn’t personal. Plus, I’m basically a goddess and a goddess has to forgive her worshippers for their misgivings and transgressions, duh.”
“Oh,” Cas said, stunned. He rubbed his hand down his face, opening and closing his mouth a couple of times like he was trying to find the right way to word what he wanted to say. “Is that because you think it’s better for me and my mental state to not see him, or has he requested that I not be there?”
another word out of him,” Charlie said, barely able to construct a sentence through her laughter. “You’ve gotta give the kid credit, that was a pretty genius move. Definitely worthy of wearing his chosen shirt to school,” she teased.
he thought, with no adequate answer to give himself.
His heart felt like it could beat straight out of his chest with the speed it was approaching while he waited for a response. Luckily, Cas didn’t keep him waiting too long before he sent a text back.
“No,” Dean interrupted him. “You don’t get to tell me what you did or didn’t mean. You don’t get to try anything like that with me! Are you trying to see how much more you can hurt me? What the fuck kind of game is that, Cas?”
Cas jumped up in surprise and then stood opening and closing his mouth for a few moments.
“Okay, sure, he’s not an idiot. He’s an exceptionally intelligent boy who just doesn’t know how to not make a fucking mess of a drink, that’s all.”
“Doctor.”
Dean felt a pang of guilt at that, but allowed Benny to continue talking about the epitome of kindness that is Charlie.
Jacob started pointing at various spots on the menu and asking loudly if he could have one of everything. Dean hung his head, smiling at how much he related to what the kid was saying.
“It’s on my fingers!” Jacob giggles, holding his hand in the air. That’s when Cas realized that Charlie has her phone out and had been recording a video.
“Share! You have to share,” a frustrated sounding Jacob told them, tossing a few more seeds to a duck on the edge of the group.
“Cas, no. Please don’t. Please don’t do this to me,” he begged, tears threatening to overflow.
He sat down for a couple more minutes, trying to slow his heartbeat a little and thinking of what needed doing around the house that he could put this extra time into.
Dean texted Charlie to ask if she was free to hang out, and after receiving a resounding “yes” he went to the bar. He headed up the stairs to the apartment over it that Charlie lived in, thinking about how much he loved being there. The bar was cozy and felt like a family home, one that he’d been welcomed into with open arms. His heart felt full at the very thought.
“He still insists on sleeping nude most of the time. We’ve come to a compromise that he has to at least wear boxers, and he has to put a t-shirt on before he leaves his room in the morning.” Cas said in exasperation. “And as for his birthday, I haven’t actually gotten that far yet,” he says, scratching at the back of his neck. “I want to do something really special for him and have a celebration with everyone he loves, but it wasn’t all that long ago that he had his Bar Mitzvah. As much as he loved being the center of attention during the service, the actual party itself was really overwhelming for him. There were just too many people around. I’m sure you remember how he was feeling by the end of the day. He just wanted to go home and listen to music. I just worry that it will be much the same now.”
“Charlie, I can’t handle seeing him. I can’t do it. I know everyone thinks I’m fine but… I don’t – I haven’t ever -” Cas held back a sob and pressed his palms to cover his face. “When I saw his face, it was like I was right back there, breaking both of our hearts.”
“Oh my god, no way! Really? You’d do that?” She asked, practically bouncing on the soles of her feet. “Jacob absolutely
“I want yellow! I love Danny Gruff and yellow,” Jacob announced stubbornly with a frown on his face.
Later that day, Dean came through the front door in a bit of a grumpy mood. He had spilled soda on himself during the ride home and was eager to rinse off and change out of these sticky-ass clothes as quickly as possible.
“Damn. You really have got it all sorted. Seriously, when I’m on tour and actually
Dean growled in frustration at his own thoughts, furious with himself for liking that kiss so much. He could try to convince himself that he was just focusing on a tiny part of how he felt because he needed to let things flow freely so that the words could come out on paper, but even that was a weak argument with himself. He knew that he had loved having his hands in Cas’s hair, and that his entire being had wanted to curl towards him when he let out that quiet, breathy moan. A moan that had been caused by Dean’s fingers teasing at the soft skin on his back.
Charlie and Dean finally have a catch up
Cas watched as Dean turned and walked away, his heart breaking for all the pain he’d caused the man he loved.
to talk to me. I had absolutely no idea that you were still hurting so badly. Do you really think I would ever have put you in the situation I did tonight if I had even the slightest idea of how you were still feeling? I love you, dude. I wouldn’t fuck with you like that.”
“Latest thing is her closing down the bar for a night to host Jacob’s birthday. She’s putting in all these rules and special measures to make sure he has a good night.”
Then, like the chicken-shit he had already told Charlie he was, he fled the scene before he could change his mind or before Cas could read what he’d written.
“That’s so great to hear. He’s crossed my mind a couple of times over the years,” Dean said. “Actually, I did a tour the year before last where I donated all the profits to a charity that supports people with Down Syndrome and helps them with work training and stuff. They also do this thing where they pay for accommodations for parents whose kids are in hospital wards where parents can’t stay with them overnight, so that the parents can stay close by and not have to commute so far to be with their kids.”
a waste of time.”
He wrote and wrote and wrote. He crossed out words and reorganized lines. He added more lines, and moved them around until the words on the page reflected what was happening in his heart. When he was finally done, he moved his hand to the top of the tear-splattered page and wrote one more line; the title.
Thank you also to PrettySin who was on hand to assist with smut, and to DarknessBound who checked for speed, clarity, and reality. Without you, this chapter would probably have sat staring at me for another month.
Jacob was standing by the lake while Cas sat on a bench nearby. It was a beautiful day, and the sounds of the excited ducks made Jacob smile with glee. He was holding a Tupperware container of seeds and cut-in-half grapes, and he was showing Cas how he could hold so many more seeds in his hands than he used to be able to. Every couple of seconds he would toss a handful for the ducks, and then would laugh hysterically when several would go for the same piece of food.
As he slept, his dreams were filled with blue eyes, soft lips, and the feeling of home.
As he was going through the T-shirt’s, he came to one that had the Death Star as a Pokéball on a black background. Dean immediately snapped a photo of it, and before he could think better of it, he sent it to Cas.
Charlie is waiting for Dean in the parking lot and flings her arms around him enthusiastically. He can’t help but smile into her hair as he presses a kiss to the top of her head.
“No, you can’t, but Charlie is going to find someone to play live music for your party,” Cas announced. Jacob immediately started jumping up and down in excitement, with his arms flapping and a huge grin on his face.
Dean rolled his eyes at that. Yep, that was Cas. He could have twenty people telling him to not do something, but if he’d decided that what he wanted to do was the best way to do a thing, that thing was getting done.
“Always,” she huffs into his chest. She then takes a step back from him but keeps a firm grip on his arm. “Okay, so, we are absolutely going to get all the talking about Cas and what the hell happened last night out of the way first so that you won’t be stressing about it for the rest of the night. We can just rip the bandaid off and then spend the rest of the night doing whatever the frick we want, and it’s going to be better without a weight hanging over you.” She looks up at him, her face set and her eyes daring him to argue with her logic and reasoning.
He stared some more, allowing the meaning to sink into his whiskey-addled brain.
Cas threw on some clothes after his shower, marvelling at Jacob’s ability to cover him in French toast batter even when Cas was sitting five feet away. He should probably at least be relieved that none of the mess made it onto the drawing he was working on, but seriously, Jacob? The hair? Did it have to go in the hair?
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean was having a pretty good morning. He’d finished a song he’d been working on, and that was always enough to put him in a good mood. He knew it was a bit angsty, but seeing as that’s kind of his aesthetic, he figured it was okay.
Castiel’s soul leaves his body.
They ate their waffles together, talking about everything Jacob was hoping to do at school. Cas was once again hit by the overwhelming sense of rightness. Whatever other personal and relationship issues it had caused, there was no way he’d ever regret having this incredible little human enter his life.
“Ditto. It’s kinda great having you around again,” she beamed. “Now, back to my story. I’d been working at the bar for about three years when the owners wanted to sell. Everyone said I was nuts but I used all my savings, borrowed money from my parents, and took out two loans so that I could buy the place. So, I got the bar and it was all running pretty well when I realized something; I literally have no idea how to deal with my own finances, let alone those of a frickin’ business. That’s when Cas came to the rescue. He’s the manager, but he also does all the accounting. He’s great at it too, which is a relief considering he went to college for that. It’s been two years since I bought the place, and I get to do all these great things that I love, and I hardly ever have to wake up before 11am.”
Benny thanked him with open sincerity and they continued to talk for a while. They talked about how long Benny had been working for Charlie, and he told Dean his favorite part of working for her is how generous she is. Dean could understand that. Her heart was pure gold.
“I know, I’m thoroughly looking forward to it. It’s been a long time since I heard his voice. I don’t count the time that caused me to have a meltdown,” he joked.
He walked down the hallway and back into the kitchen, a towel still being rubbed against his head trying to dry his hair off enough that it didn’t drip all over everything. He could hear Charlie’s words of encouragement and the musical sound of Jacob laughing with glee.
Dean:
Now with something to look forward to, Dean felt better about shutting himself in the hotel room for the day. He took a deep breath and got to work on making sense of the jumbled sentences and fragments that drunk Dean had left for him the night before. If only he could stop the painful twangs that kept happening when he saw Cas’s name scrawled across the pages where he’d poured out his heart.
“I don’t know if you made the right career choice, Dean. Sure, hell of a singer, but hot fucking damn, the boy can act, too!”
His phone buzzed with Charlie’s response.
Thinking that was probably for the best, he got out of the shower and set about getting ready to leave his hotel room. He should probably go check in with that Garth kid and tell him he was going to stick around for another day or so. There was no way in hell he’d be able to drive anywhere else today.
“I wrote on the note that I was ready to talk if he was, but now I’m not so sure. I want to, but it hurts so fucking much, Charlie! I literally spent all day writing a song about how fucked up my feelings are right now. I’m scared of it hurting more. I’m already struggling so much and I don’t know how much more I can cope with.”
“Oh, right.” Dean was puzzled by this revelation but brushed it aside. Inias was probably out for the night and had left Cas to babysit. “How is Jacob doing these days? God, he must be so grown up now. It’s been such a long time since I’ve seen him.”
“That’s what I like to hear,” Dean grinned at her, helping himself to a beer. “Benny mentioned Jacob was a fan and that you were looking… so, yeah. Let’s do this.”
Truly, I hope none of you get this!
“Yes!” Jacob repeated, nearly shouting this time. He tucked back into his food and had to be reminded to slow down while he was eating so that he didn’t choke.
They sat there talking for way longer than the half an hour that Dean had originally agreed to. They ended up ordering lunch, and it was right around their fourth cup of coffee that Charlie asked Dean if he really had to take off today, or if he could stick around for a while so they could spend some more time together, and so that Charlie could introduce him to Dorothy.
Putting his energy to where he felt it belonged, he went onstage and played his heart out. He performed songs that he hadn’t played live in years, but that felt fitting due to all the emotions that were bubbling up inside. Charlie would catch his eye occasionally, and it helped keep him grounded while he sang.
The two men sat together and scarfed down their burgers at top speed, with Benny conceding that yes, it’s worth all the groaning and that he’s going to have to insist to Andrea that this burger counts as his version of the special diet.
He wandered around the store grabbing some standard and basic underwear, socks, jeans, and a couple of flannels to go over the top, but wanted to get T-shirts that he’d genuinely wear again.
“The one and only,” Cas chuckles.
“You like eating food without having to do any of the work, is what you like,” Cas countered. He carefully measured out the chocolate chips as he spoke, but then dumped another cupful into the batter. They both liked extra chips, and Jacob loved watching the melted chocolate pour out to cover his strawberries. Ah, strawberries! “Jacob, you can get the whipped cream and strawberries out of the fridge. There are still some in the bowl and they’re already cut, so just put them on the table.”
Cas headed into the kitchen to make some tea, and while he waited for the water to boil, he took a few deep breaths in an attempt to quell his shaking body. Too many thoughts were swirling through his mind, and the one that stood out in blinking red lights was guilt. He couldn’t believe he’d kissed Dean. He couldn’t believe how selfish he’d been with his own desires, and how he had neglected to think about how Dean might take it. He’d wanted to kiss Dean, so he did it without a second thought.
After he waved goodbye to Jacob and the front door closed, Cas sat down at the breakfast table and pressed his head to the surface in a mixture of exasperation and a fair amount of guilt for not being the most responsible adult earlier. Laughing at something he should probably have been chiding Jacob for wasn’t sitting with him well, but he couldn’t help it. That child was about 96% sarcasm and sass, and honestly at times he was just so cute while being an absolute little shit that Cas wasn’t capable of doing anything more than chuckle. To be fair, he had at least left the room before breaking down into silent laughter.
“I know what he said to you. He told me, and I’m not going to say that what he did was okay because it absolutely wasn’t, but at the time he didn’t see another way to handle things. He made a snap decision, one that he thought he’d thought through, but that should have been dealt with differently. For what it’s worth, he’s been so different since Jacob moved in with him. He properly thinks things through now and carefully evaluates what the consequences are to every damn thing he does. It actually gets a little infuriating at times,” she chuckled lightly. “He can get a little
Dean arrived back at his hotel room and decided to have a shower before worrying about the rest of his evening.
“I’m still angry. I’m still feelin’ a lotta hurt. But I’m tryin’ real hard to do what Charlie asked me and make peace.” Dean said with sincerity. “Well, maybe not complete peace, but I’m gonna hear the guy out.”
“I loved him, you know. I loved him so much, Charlie. He’d only have to smile and I felt like nothing could ever go wrong in the universe. Even the way he said my name made my heart race, and it never occurred to me that there was a chance I could lose him. The thought just— it never entered my mind. He understood me better than anyone, and he taught me things about myself and about love that I never even knew I needed to learn. I would have actual daydreams about waking up in his arms for the rest of my life. I would think about slow-dancing in the kitchen in the middle of the night rather than going out to clubs, and it being perfect because we were together. He was everything to me, Charlie. He was my home.” Cas twisted his fingers in his lap and swallowed hard, trying to keep his emotions in check. “Walking away from him was the hardest thing I’ve ever done, even if I count dealing with the aftermath of the accident and taking Jacob on. It just never even compared to what it felt like to walk away from him the way I did.” Tears started to spill and run unchecked down Cas’ cheeks. “I just- I never…”  He paused to regain control of his voice, ignoring the tightening in his chest that was seven years of unexpressed hurt.
The minutes ticked by, and gradually Dean was able to get his breathing under control. “It’s just another gig,” he told himself.
She was visibly upset but still tried to pass off a little smile at Dean as she reached out to hug him.
Dean shrugged it off. It’s not like he has any idea who this person is or what their schedule is like. They’re probably running late, or out of town, or at a friends house or something. No reason to let it impact his day at all.
He was homesick and he was pining.
Charlie found Cas perched on a wall outside the library down the road. His feet were crossed at the ankles, his hands were resting on the wall behind him, and he was staring up at the cloudless sky.
He pulled himself into a sitting position and waited for the dizziness to pass so he could make his way to the bathroom.
“You have chocolate syrup all over your face,” Cas said while reaching for a napkin. “You’d probably get more food
“I swear, this kid is going to keep every local performer in business when he grows up,” Charlie commented, not bothering to hide the smile on her face.
He remembered how angry he was that Cas had lied to him and led him on when in reality he obviously didn’t want that future with Dean. Did he want it with someone else? Was Dean just someone to pass the time with and give Cas a bit of an ego boost? He couldn’t imagine a world where Cas would be that cruel, but nothing makes sense. And why would Cas have kissed him like that? The way he’d kissed had felt like he’d been starving for it and had finally found something he’d been seeking desperately. Could Cas have felt he’d made a mistake and regretted breaking up with him? If that was true, then why hadn’t Cas sought him out any time over the last seven years?
“That would be really great,” Cas relented. “I really do want to get him found as fast as I can so I can get back inside.”
“Let’s go ride the steam train,” suggested Cas, hoping to cheer Jacob up. The small train ran on a track around the lake and Jacob always loved being able to see the entire thing without having to put too much energy into it.
“No, you don’t understand! His
“Well, technically you didn’t
Charlie:
Dean:
“Well, when you put it like that, I don’t think I will stay,” he says, laughter shaking through him. “I’m not looking to get punched in the face my first week back in town!”
He laid there trying to catch his breath, wishing with everything he had that Dean was right there with him as they came down from their high together. He knew that thoughts like these were dangerous and would likely lead to pain, but he couldn’t bring himself to care. He hadn’t come like that in longer than he could remember, and it was definitely the hardest he’d ever come from jacking off. He was almost dizzy from it, and his legs had all but turned to jelly. The dream itself was enough to cause some unsteadiness, but an orgasm that powerful within minutes of waking up had kind of floored him.
Charlie:
“Fuck. I just hope it goes okay. I need to be able to start putting my brain back together at some point.”
of it!” Jacob announced to the waitress.
Cas waited. He would step in if Jacob seemed like he was in danger of having a meltdown or becoming overstimulated, but he knew he had to give Jacob the chance to remember what his new system was. Jacob picked up the controller for a second, then something clicked in his mind and he set it straight back down. He disappeared from the room for a few moments and came back with a chunky book in his hands.
“I am, Charlie, I really am. I know things aren’t going to just be fine and fuck knows I’m not expecting him to want to be friends after this. But I meant what I said, and however hard it is and however much it hurts me, I owe him this. For the record, even though at the time I couldn’t see a way to tell him the truth without either dragging him down and having him waste years waiting for me; or having him think it was all his fault outside of just thinking we were incompatible… I would do things differently if I could go back and do it again. I truly would.”
“I’ll just take another coffee, thank you,” he said to her. He turned back to Jacob, shaking his head a little. “You’re going to turn into a chunk of chocolate one of these days.”
At that moment, Jacob came stampeding into the room.
“I know how you could make it up to me,” she says with a slight sing-song lilt to her voice.
During the course of their conversation, Dean filled her in on his talk with Cas, and about the shirt he got for Jacob.
Charlie:
been a while, so I’m gonna have to come get my Jacob fix sometime soon. Do you think he’d like to kick my ass at Rocket League in the near future?”
“Meg was going to be with him, but he got invited to a sleepover at his friend Jack’s house. He loves it there. Pretty sure it has something to do with how good Jack is at Minecraft and his willingness to play it until their eyes bleed,” Cas chuckled, his voice shaky after crying so much.
Dean needed a distraction. He turned on his heel and marched back out of the park, heading towards the record-slash-coffee shop. He’s greeted by a young guy who does a doubletake when he recognizes Dean’s face. Dean smiles at him and starts browsing through their music collection.
Cas shook his head and looked toward the ground.
Cas woke up gasping, already on the verge of coming. Without pausing to think, he reached his hand into his sweatpants and fisted his hand around himself. A groan escaped his lips at the contact and he ached for more. He replayed the events of his dream, and the image of Dean taking his entire length in one go had him inching closer and closer to release. He was desperate as he fucked into his own hand, so much precome having dripped down his shaft that lube was completely unnecessary.
Each play through was better than the last, and he could feel his heart opening more and more with the passing hours. This was always the way with his music when he was writing about life; once a song was complete, he felt like he could accept and move forward from the strong emotions he was feeling about whatever the situation was. It was what had kept him strong for the last seven years. He always had music as a way to confront the things in his mind, and in doing so he could make sense of them better. This particular song felt like a balm to the ache caused by knowing he and Cas would never be parents together. They may both become parents at some point, but the together part of that had been destroyed a long time ago. Dean hadn’t realized he was still carrying so much of that pain around with him until he saw Cas being tender with a child. That pain had been soothed to bearable levels by the beauty he was creating through his music.
“Don’t like rules. I like Danny Gruff.” Jacob sank onto the sofa with his arms crossed and a defiant pout on his lips. He stroked over the lettering of Danny Gruff’s name on the bright yellow shirt he was wearing. He’d worn the shirt to bed last night and Cas figures he should have been suspicious when Jacob was
Cas laughed, and when the waitress placed the muffin in front of Jacob, Cas laughed again at how wide the boy’s eyes got.
“Hey! I’m not that bad, I just like what I like,” he responded with a shrug.
Charlie was quiet for a moment, clearly deep in thought.
“Are you eating that thing or should I be clearin’ this place out so you can make love to it?” Dean heard a gruff, teasing voice call out from across the room.
The song Dean sings in this chapter (that also gives this story its title) is by a band called Blue October. I do not own these lyrics, nor do I have any rights to their music.
“We didn’t actually talk or anything,” he clarified. “He was just in the diner when I was having breakfast with Jacob. But he left his number with the waitress and asked her to give it to me.” He picked up his mug and took another sip, the smile appearing back on his face.
“Are you going to put me out of my misery and tell me what you talked about for so long?”
He comes across two of his own albums and chuckles to himself. No wonder the guy working the register had recognized him, he was selling his stuff here. He didn’t want to end up in a discussion about his music right then, so he wandered over to the coffee shop side of the building and settles himself into a comfy looking armchair.
“Okay, okay. Genius move, and I’m sure you’ll see the funny side of it even more later, but I shall try to contain myself.” She said in a faux-solemn voice. “You sound like you could use a break and some adult company that doesn’t consist of just work chat. Are you guys free tonight? I could come over and make dinner with Jacob, maybe even see if I can convince him to do his homework or something? Then you and I can be grown-ups once he’s in bed. Watch a movie with some wine and discuss adult things like taxes and Star Wars.”
Dean thought.
Cas confesses a few things to Charlie.
“How in the hell did he think it wouldn’t affect me?” Dean asks, completely stunned.
Dean:
“Sure,” Cas responded after a beat, warily and with minor trepidation.
Cas could feel Dean’s eyes on him and Jacob, watching them while they were eating. He tried to keep his attention solely on Jacob and mostly succeeded, but it was still incredibly distracting knowing that every time he looked up, he would be able to see Dean. He looked beautiful. He was relaxed back into his chair with the sunlight streaming through the window, casting a golden light over Dean’s hair and making his eyes shine. Every time they accidentally made eye contact, Cas would have to quickly look back to his food, knowing that if he really started to look into those eyes, he would never be able to pull himself away. It had always felt that way.
“I can help if you’d like,” Dean said. “I mean, if you need it and you’re okay with…” he trailed off.
“Well… okay, yes, we do karaoke nights, but it specifically has to be Disney songs or theme songs to sci-fi movies and tv shows,” she said proudly.
“I- wow, Dean. That’s amazing. I don’t even know what to say,” Cas said, his heart fluttering at the kindness and beauty that filled Dean from the inside out.
Dean:
“Tell me about it!” Cas bursts between the laughter that he felt better about letting out now that Jacob had left the room. “Do you see the issue? It happens so often. I should be giving him advice or trying to set a good example, and then he comes out with something like that and I’m reduced to a mess just from the effort of not laughing!”
The waitress appeared back at their table to ask if they wanted anything else.
Dean hoped that his message didn’t come across as too strange.
“Okay, okay. Yes. Are you happy?” He reluctantly admitted. “There’s just
Dean:
somethin’ about being back home that feels really good, like it’s where I’m meant to be right now. I’m not pushin’ it, I’m just following along for as long as it feels right.”
It was 5:40am, and he had to be up in twenty minutes to get Jacob ready for school. Definitely not worth it to get back into bed.
The prose at the end is a piece by Benedict Smith. I truly think he’s one of the most underrated writers of our generation, and I’d sell my soul to live in his mind forever.
“Here, boy! Come on, we’ve got to get back inside. It’s cold out here and I have treats waiting for you. Don’t you want some treats?”
“Gabriel? Where are you?” The voice asked.
It doesn’t matter how briefly; Dean knows he’s an idiot for having kissed him back.
Tapping gently on the wall a couple of times first so as not to startle the guy, Dean asked, “Hey, dude, are you okay?”
He reached for it, wanting to know what Dean had sent him, but waited until the waitress had walked away again before opening it. He read the note, his pulse quickening.
Once he was settled, Cas continued working, noticing that he was much more efficient now that he’d had a chance to voice some of his concerns. He heard his phone vibrate but chose to ignore it in favor of getting as much work done as he could to make up for the time spent talking to Charlie earlier. It’s only when he heard it vibrate again that he reached for it. Whoever it was had sent two messages in such quick succession that Cas was concerned it might be important. Instead, Dean’s name and an icon showing he’d sent a picture message were visible in the notifications. Without even realizing he was doing so, Cas smiled softly as he clicked to open the message thread.
“Awesome. I’m in 14. I’ll be over in a few,” promised Dean. “And Cas? Looking out for someone when they’re hurting is
“Yep, I totally understand and I’m telling you, Cas, you gotta stop beating yourself up for laughing. He’s getting older and his sense of humor is developing more each day. It’s okay for you to let him know that you find him funny. As long as he’s not causing himself or anyone else any harm, I don’t see the issue with it. You explained that it’s probably not the best idea to do it to people outside of his friends and family, and he acknowledged you. Seriously, you’ve got nothing to worry about. Let the boy hear you giggle!”
Charlie.
It was all completely unnecessary and he was well aware that he didn’t even know how long he would be staying, but keeping himself busy was helping to keep his panic in check.
Dean thought to himself as he awoke the next morning. His head was pounding, and he was pretty sure he could actually hear colors. He rolls over as slowly as he possibly can, gingerly testing his muscles and assessing damage. Rolling over didn’t help his head any, but nothing else felt too out of sorts aside from his stomach churning with the movement.
Dean snorted and then buckled over laughing. His eyes were scrunched shut, his hand was covering his forehead like he was trying to hold himself together and failing miserably. As the laughter continued, Dean’s face filled with a flush of the most stunning color. The freckles that dusted his nose and cheeks popped against the red, and they were even more prominent than usual. Cas felt breathless. Watching Dean laugh had always been something he’d loved, but in that moment, he remembered exactly how much he loved the sound of it, too. He loved the way Dean didn’t ever hold back a single chuckle. He loved that he was completely unapologetic, and Cas was convinced it was the most beautiful thing he had ever seen. He couldn’t take his eyes from Dean, who was now trying to stand upright. He reached out to steady himself using Cas’s arm, and Cas instinctively pulled him closer, one hand flying to Dean’s face to cup his cheek.
Dean stood in front of his little brother who was to be officiating his wedding in just a few moments. Dean’s cheeks were flushed with excitement and his freckles were more prominent than Sam had ever seen them. Happiness radiated from him and lit up the room around them.
“What’s a PODD book?”
A cursory glance in the mirror showed that outwardly, not his was different. He looked good, his hair wasn’t the bucket of sweat he was expecting, and the sudden rush of adrenaline had given his cheeks a bit of a flush, which actually didn’t look too bad.
“Don’t even, Char. I can’t deal with this right now, and I don’t want to talk about it,” Cas said firmly, but with slight tremor to his voice.
Cas stood up from the couch and went to get Jacob’s swim bag. He checked that he still had his goggles in there, then grabbed his bathing suit and two towels from the linen closet to add to the contents. He also put some extra change in Jacob’s wallet in case he wanted a snack or drink after swimming, then set the bag by the front door so that it would be ready for Jacob to grab in the morning.
(See the end of the chapter for
Charlie laughed at his enthusiasm. Live music at the bar happened a lot and Jacob was always just as eager to hear it, regardless of who may be performing that week. His love for live music was such a precious and infectious thing.
Dean laughed out loud at the image of Cas, who had always been just on this side of too uptight, hosting contests involving poop. He also noted that the quietly adoring way Cas spoke about Jacob was genuine and filled with endearment and pride. Dean could feel the warmth from that love spreading through his entire body, and was surprised to find that he actually enjoyed the sensation. They continued texting back and forth for a little while, both carefully sticking to superficial talk and gentle teasing. When the time came for them to say goodnight, Dean’s cheeks were hurting from laughter rather than stinging from being stained by tears, and his heart felt lighter than it had in a long time. With a smile on his face, Dean drifted off into his first peaceful sleep since his arrival in town.
“It did help, Jacob. You used it perfectly. Well done! I’ll be sure to tell your teachers how brilliantly you did,” Cas beamed.
Cas smiled back at him. His eyes crinkling at the corners.
Collapsing into bed seemed like a really good idea, but Dean decided that this flurry of emotions could be put to better use by fuelling them with some more alcohol and sitting down to write.
“It’s not a waste of time - uh.., what’s your name? I’m Dean.”
Cas could hear her dissolve into a fit of cackles. She couldn’t talk for what felt like ages, which actually made Cas feel a lot better about his own laughter earlier. Clearly this was just a situation where laughing was the only response, and with the guilt removed, Cas allowed himself to smile.
He thought about the fear that Dean projected as he’d backed away from Cas after breaking their kiss. Cas scrunched his eyes up, trying to block the visual out, hating the anguish he’d caused… but it was pointless. He hated himself for making Dean think that he was in any way unlovable. He hated himself for not just having the courage to come clean right then. He hated himself for kissing Dean and driving the knife in deeper. Most of all he hated himself for loving the feel of Dean pressed against him.
Dean’s hands were shaking. It wasn’t that unusual for nerves to get the best of him right before he went on stage, but right now he felt like those nerves were constricting his chest to the point he was convinced he’d just forgotten he was wearing a corset. He emptied the rest of his water bottle, shrugged, then downed the double whiskey that had been sitting on the dressing table.
