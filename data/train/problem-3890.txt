Castiel could smell that bullshit from a mile away. "Dean, please be honest with me. What did you mean?"
"Well, he's facing charges for a lot more than kidnapping, rape, and endangerment. He hasn't paid taxes in at least seven years. The DNA we got from him is connected to three murders in other states and two rapes a couple of cities over. The guy is an absolute scum bag. When you put all of these charges together, you're looking at an extremely long, if not life-long, sentence."
The omega nodded. "I, uh... I wasn't ever supposed to be a..." He shook his head and let out an angry huff of breath. "I wasn't supposed to be an omega. Went most of my life thinking I was a beta." He sighed and turned to look at Cas. "When'd you present?"
Castiel couldn't help but laugh. They ate in silence apart from Dean's squeal when Cas told him that he could get more food. This time, the omega filled his plate with berries and toast. He didn't look too happy about the berries, but he ate them all the same.
Castiel took a shower with scent-muting body wash and made himself look as casual as possible. He was sure that this omega was tired of all of the hospital staff checking on him every five minutes. Hospitals were like invasive hotels to Castiel. Sure, you got some free movies, but at what cost? So, he decided to wear some dark wash jeans, a light blue sweater, and his trenchcoat.
“Oh, I’m sure. In fact, they’re calling for it to be back this afternoon. No thunderstorms or anything. I checked. It’s just so wet.”
Dean shrugged. "Whatever." It was clear that Dean wanted Cas to tell him what to do, or to agree that he was weak, but that was not Cas's place and it was not true.
"Well, right now, as you can imagine, he is not talking at all. He screams if someone comes close to him without gloves or anything to use as a barrier between them. Poor kid, they probably found some sick way to condition him into thinking touch would hurt him. He did eat at the hospital, but after that he's been sleeping most of the day. I don't want you going there until tomorrow, but it sounds like you've got your hands full with him. I don't have to tell you, though, that until he gets touch and forms a bond with someone- literally the most basic of acquaintance bond will suffice with this kid- his mental and physical state is just going to get worse."
Roche rolled his eyes and stormed out of the room. Castiel narrowed his eyes and realized he had let out a snarl. He immediately calmed himself and looked to D. The omega was wide-eyed and breathing heavily. "D, I am so sorry that you had to see that. That was not how I should have behaved in that situation." Cas picked up the bee from the table and set it on the omega's bed. "I am so, so sorry that I did not handle my anger professionaly. I can assure you that that is not how I usually behave." The omega quickly grabbed the bee and squeezed it against his chest. He rubbed his cheek against it. He let out a deep sigh.
When Castiel finally managed to tear his eyes from the beautiful man in front of him, he saw Charlie dabbing her eyes, MacLeod with a satisfied grin on his face, and Roche with his jaw on the floor. "Better close that mouth of yours, Roche. You'll catch flies."
Cas chuckled. "Well, I do not want to put you under any stress. Thank you for offering, though! It's very thoughtful of you."
Castiel laid back in his spot and dried his eyes. "Oh, Dean. That was hilarious. I am so proud of you. You really are the best patient I could have ever asked for. Please don't say anything else if it causes you pain. You did so well."
“I’m a nice guy, cause I…” There is a literal perfect penis in front of his face and he can’t have it. Motherfucker! “Cause I always open the door for the old ladies that live in the building,” Yea, talk about old ladies. Make your own dick go down. “I make pies for people when they’re sick, and I, uh, I volunteer at the animal shelter sometimes.”
Dean held out his hands and help Cas stand. "Yea, but, maybe we could take a nap before we do anything else? I really just... I just need you to hold me for a while." Cas nodded and led them over to the bed. He smiled as Dean took the clothes he had picked out and sat them on the nightstand. "Later, okay, Alpha?"
When Cas shut the door to Dean’s room, Dean nuzzled down further under the covers. He was so happy. Whenever his mind went to this safe space, he was cared for and so, so content. He was happy with Castiel leading him in the direction he should go and the feelings it stirred inside of his heart. It was beginning to rain again and for once, Dean didn’t feel so scared. The constant sound was peaceful. Hopefully thunder and lightning would hold off for today.
"Hey, Bobby." Dean gave a small smile. Cas guessed that this sign of friendship made Dean feel special.
Castiel's eyes darted back and forth around the room as he tried to think of any other reason that his scent may have been lost. There was no way a person could go that long in a slave-trade business without being touched. "But, Alastair was in the sex slave--"
Cas let out a quiet growl. He pulled Dean down by the back of his neck and kissed him again. "I love you, sweet boy."
"This week has been quite hectic, as I'm sure that you gentlemen can imagine. Maybe we just keep in touch and figure something out for next week when things slow back down?" Cas tried to nonchalantly intertwine his fingers with Dean's. The omega eventually relented his hold on his pants leg and let Castiel hold his sweaty hand.
"Wow, that is amazing! I knew we had sent some uniforms into that building on Seventh Street, but I had no idea they had actually found something. Please, spare no details! I can't wait to hear how you coordinated a sting on that bastard." Castiel was absolutely beaming from the news, but he was a bit confused as to why Gabriel wasn't celebrating. This was a huge win. Not only for the Omega Defense Team, but also for omega civil rights groups, eqaulity initiatives, and really, all alphas and omegas throughout the country.
Cas continued to stare. While barbaric, it wasn't unheard of for people to remove scent glands from their victims to keep them from being as easily traced. Gabe dealt with this type of thing all of the time. "I'm still confused as to why you need me. If they cut out his scent gl--"
As Dean turned to walk away, Roche tried to grab his ankle. Castiel stomped on his wrist. He heard a loud snap. He may not have had his full strength, but Roche was fading fast. The beta groaned loudly in pain, but Castiel just smiled. "I told you the day I met you, Roche. He is my only priority."
With one last look in the rear view mirror towards the Wesson home, Castiel pushed the gas pedal and left the picture-perfect home behind them.
Cas's eyes followed the omega as he walked the length of the kitchen and back again. "At 11. We will leave here in about an hour."
Gabe gathered their things and they drove in silence to the Omega Defense Team station. Gabriel tried to commend Dean on being resourceful enough to use a stray paperclip to get out of the cuffs. Dean just gave a noncommittal grunt. Hand in hand, Cas and Dean huddled close together in the back of Gabe's mint green nightmare. They were safe. They were safe. There were a few rooms in the back of the ODT for omegas and families who needed immediate protection. Castiel never envisioned himself as needing one of these rooms, but as they pulled into the station, he had never felt so grateful.
Shakily, Dean reached his hand up and tried to stand. He was still covered in cum which wasn't as enjoyable as one may think and he was sure that Cas could feel his whole body shivering. Man, at least one of them had their senses. Cas was going to even be a gentleman before walking Dean back to his room and getting himself out of this mess. Dean knew it wasn't going to be long-term... how could it? One three-day weekend was enough and well, he wouldn't have been able to continue this without feelings getting in the way. At least Cas was going to let him keep his dignity.
Dean turned to her slightly, but he was absolutely rigid. He tried to look confident and Cas was certain that everyone else in the room bought the act. He knew better. He knew that his sweet boy was scared to death of what this woman was about to say. "Yes, ma'am."
Castiel held his palm out for Dean to take. Instead of holding his hand, Dean gave a quick yelp and huddled closer to the opposite side of the bed. After doing this job for so long, Castiel knew an omega scared of their alpha's retribution when he saw one. While he was not Dean' alpha, he certainly was the only alpha with whom he had an attachment.
After all the intense, almost urgent touches from earlier, this was like a bucket of ice water. Dean realized in that moment all of the care that was behind Cas’ touches. As Cas’ lips melded against his own, Dean moaned quietly. He wrapped his arms around Cas’ neck and pulled him closer. Cas allowed it as his own hand ran down to take Dean’s cock out of his boxers. He adjusted himself so their erections were beside one another and began jacking them slowly.
Gabriel smiled weakly in return and shook his head. "We've been doing this for a combined seventeen years. I've never..." He took a deep breath and continued. "Cas, man... It was so horrible. I went in after the initial sweep and I can't even put into words what all I saw."
Cas didn't realize that he was crying, but the wet spots on his shirt let him know just how emotional he was being in that moment. He took a sobering breath, looked up at the ceiling, and held up a finger for the other men to allow him a moment to think.
"Yes, but it shouldn't have progressed this quickly. You are truly breaking records with your recovery time. Might get yourself in a medical journal if you're not careful."
"Of course, baby. Daddy always wants to play. Let Daddy lay down under you. I want to be as close to your tight little hole as I can." Dean moved temporarily so Cas could lay underneath of him. He was eye level with Cas' monster of a dick and he knew Cas was getting an eye full of his ass. Dean shivered as Cas lightly brushed over his balls before holding onto both of his hips. "Touch it for Daddy, baby."
The omega didn't open his eyes. "I think there is some yogurt with honey on here. You know, bees make honey." D cracked his good eye open enough for Castiel to see some green. Cas smiled. "Yes, they make the honey and it is so important to our world. Would you like me to get you some yogurt and honey?"
After a few more moments of hugging and celebration, the doctor gently reminded the trio that he needed to go attend to other patients, but they were welcome to continue their celebration in the parking lot. Castiel had forgot the other man was in the room. A beta, of course, like Sam. No scent. The brothers looked a bit shocked, as if they had forgotten he was there, as well.
“Okay, Daddy.” Dean hugged him back just as tightly and then walked back into the room. Of course Cas wasn’t mad. He understood. He was such a perfect Daddy. He didn’t need to mention how long he had slept.
Cas found his seat beside of Dean and pressed their knees together. Cas could see the tension leave Dean's shoulders out of his peripheral vision. "So, Bobby, you needed me to sign something?"
It was a lot worse than he expected. The omega's left eye was swollen shut and a dark purple. His lip had a cut and there were a few stitches on his cheek. His right eye was was surrounded by a yellowish-brown bruise that was healing. His nose had a large bandage covering it from his eyes to its end. The thing that made Castiel freeze for a moment was just how frail this young man appeared to be. He was tall, Cas could tell that much. He should have had a much larger frame, but it appeared that he was severely under weight. Cas could also see that he had green eyes. That was all. "Are you okay?"
Two rapid thunder strikes startled him to the point of yelping. He covered his head with the blanket and immediately stuck his thumb in his mouth. Ugh, why did he have to be such a baby? He was a 23-year-old man cowering under his covers because of a noise. He was so stupid.
"Mm... you have such a big cock, doctor. Think you can gag me? I want my eyes watering over your dick, daddy." Dean's eyelids fluttered despite the blood slowly drying around them.
“I’m sorry.” Dean looked down at the ground and shuffled his feet. Great, Cas had made this gorgeous human being feel embarrassed.
Cas walked over and rubbed his wrist over the oblong pillow that Dean was holding. "Get some rest, sweet boy. I love you."
When Dean woke up, it was to silence. Complete silence. The fan had shut off. “Freaking short in a wire, I guess.” Dean though. However, he noticed he could not hear the fridge running or the heat… “Fuck.”
Castiel shook his head. "Of course, not." He shook the boy's hand. "Are you attending college locally?"
For a moment, Cas panicked, but when he turned to look at the omega, he saw that Dean's face was covered in bubbles. He couldn't help the laugh that he let out. "What in the world are you doing?" He laughed through his words and Dean's smile grew.
Suzanne let out a quick laugh and squeezed Dean's hand. "Thank you, sweetheart, but really, all of those challenges just led us to make the decisions that we needed to make. We submitted our adoption forms and waited for months on a response. We received a call one evening asking to confirm if we would be willing to adopt siblings." Dean's eyes shot to the floor. "We said yes without hesitation." The omega froze.
"Well, I'm going to go read again. Just give me a signal if you need anything. Clap, tap the bed, anything will do. Get some rest, D."
"If you must know, he is the most perfectly sculpted creature on Earth. But, that is not relevant to your case."
"No, no, it does. You originally found comfort in my scent alone and it calmed your nerves. Now you're getting used to having it around you, so you need something different to comfort you. That makes sense to me, sweet boy."
Castiel gave a quick nod. "Thank you." Ankle cuffs? Were these people insane? This young man had been in shackles for at least two years and they were just going to put him back with that same treatment? It was sickening to think about it for too long. He went into the restroom to cool down, once again.
"N- I don't fucking know!" Dean grabbed Cas by his collar. "All I know is that you could have any fucking person on this planet. Why are you settling for a broken douche-bag like me?" At this point, Dean's words were weak and his grip was weaker.
Moans escaped from Dean’s throat as Cas’ fingers pushed in even further. Dean looked back to see Cas jerking his cock with dilated eyes and parted lips. “You want Daddy’s cum, boy?”
Cas wrapped his arms around Dean's shoulders and rested his cheek on his forehead. Sure, he had seen Dean cry, but this... this was different. The omega was heartbroken. He was mourning. The fact that someone had rejected him added on top of everything else broke Dean's heart completely in two and it fueled Castiel's rage. The alpha knew that he needed to keep it under control, though.
Cas continued his assault on Dean. “Yes, it was. You’re wrong, though, baby. You know why you’re wrong?”
The ride home was silent apart from Dean tapping his knee and the occasional sound of the turn signal. Cas knew better than to press for details about why Dean's mood changed, but at the same time, he needed to know so he could prevent it in the future. He figured the least he could do, though, was allow Dean some quiet until they got home. So the silence continued.
“Yes. I do.” Cas continued kissing his neck and worked his way up to his earlobe. “You’re thinking that Daddy is going to send you back to your bed. Leave you alone. Never want to play anymore. Am I right?”
"Enough stalling, lover boy. You can tell me about the folks later. Right now, I need to know that you're not actually Fabio in disguise."
Cas sat in his usual spot and pointed to Dean's chair which he had moved to directly beside himself, rather than across the table. High chair? It was just
"So, when's the appointment, again?" Dean had clarified this multiple times in the days leading up to their test.
It angered Cas to know that memories of his own family made Dean have just as much of a visceral reaction as his time he was held captive. He must have not had as much control over his scent as he thought, because Dean was starting to kiss his hand. It helped bring him back down. "I apologize, Dean. I need to better control my emotions around you."
"I-I mean... I think my likes are pretty obvious. Do we seriously need to have a discussion like this? I thought you meant like you were gonna call out a random thing for each letter of the alphabet and I would say if I liked it or not."
Dean couldn’t help the laugh that came from his mouth. “Seriously? You- you have a problem with how it fucks with my oral health?”
"Shit... never came up did it?" Dean pulled Bee close. "Dean Winchester. I'm 23. I like sunsets, long walks on the beach, and possessive alphas name Castiel."
Cas breathed out loudly. "Yea, but no... 'poking' me, okay?" Both men chuckled. "Just use it to relax, okay? Don't get more worked up, sweet boy."
With a quick peck to Cas's cheek, Dean turned on his interior decorator skills. "When I was a kid, I always wanted my own room to decorate. I thought I would call it 'The Dean Cave.' Now, I don't need neon letters and an arrow like I wanted back then, but I would like something with our initials. I want everyone to know it's ours. Like, have a big letter D and C over the bed. Or on little letter tiles for coasters on the nightstands. Or... something." Dean paused and looked over to Cas. His smile fell for a moment. "O-or is that lame?
The beta stared at the wall and nodded. "I suppose you're right. I just remember this one night as if it were yesterday. I could not get Sam to sleep and I had tried everything in the book. Walking, driving, bouncing, feeding. None of it worked. He... he began saying 'bean,' over and over again. I just thought it was some toddler babbling. Now I know he wanted Dean. He missed him. He knew that he was missing someone important." Her perfect smile was gone. "I have a wonderful son, but I should have two. I should have raised Dean. I should have kept him from the horrors he has faced. Sam hasn't given me details, but he told me that he has had a tough life. I just... I wish I could have made a difference."
"Until I see more evidence that this patient is improving, I think that you are too personally involved. I am going to ask MacLeod to request a new ORS for this patient first thing in the morning."
Dean looked at Cas through hooded eyes and realized that Cas owned him. In this moment... in every moment... Cas owned every part of him. Cas kept staring as Dean pushed up and groaned loudly. He began picking up momentum and slammed himself down over and over on the toy. "D-daddy! Need more... needa cum..."
Cas would never use his "alpha voice" on Dean, but he did feel like his omega needed some support and structure after the day that they had had. "I can do that. Will you please walk over to the shelf with me, though, and keep me company?"
The three men walked out of the building and remembered that, while they have much to celebrate, Sam's car was still on its last leg.
D nodded once and pointed to his bee. He gave a highly exaggerated frown. "Oh, was Bee upset that we didn't get any honey with the meal." D kept the frown and nodded. "Well, I will go fix that." D kept eye contact with Cas, but dipped his head towards the door as to say "then get on with it."
Cas furrowed his brow and nodded slowly. "Well, I supposed I will go there tomorrow. Do they know of any possible identification? Anything I could use to connect to his old life?"
Dean continued to stare. His eyes darted from the chair to Cas over and over again. He was acting so damn nonchalant. This was the biggest dildo Dean had and he was supposed to eat dinner while he was impaled on the damn thing? Well, in theory it was hot as fuck and he didn't want to disappoint Cas, so he turned and faced the table. He slowly made his way down until the head of the dildo touched his hole. He whimpered and looked over at Cas. Cas wasn't looking back. He was simply eating his dinner and sipping his wine. So, Dean continued to lower himself, despite the growing burn in his thighs from holding himself in such an awkward position for so long.
"It's okay, baby boy. Remember, if things don't go exactly as you want, I'll cause a scene and we can leave."
"No problem. You can head on up." She smiled and returned to her computer. As Castiel was walking away he heard her call him again. "Hey, ODT-man! The doctor added an order that all visitors need to check in at the nurses' station before heading in. Right now, it's for every visit."
Dean half-expected Cas to come knocking on the door and try to talk through everything, but he didn’t. After another hour or so, Dean heard the front door shut. He was glad. He didn’t want to talk even more about his tendencies. Let Cas go somewhere else and leave him to his own thoughts. Dean supposed he had always had a bit of an oral fixation. It was just oddly comforting to have something in his mouth. Chewing on a pen cap, biting his nails, eating pie… Those were all comforting things. So what if he needed something else comforting him when he was scared? He didn't want to have to rationalize a basic part of his psyche tonight. These thoughts continued for quite a while, and then before he had even stripped for bed, he was drifting off to the sound of a soft, gentle rain hitting the roof.
"Cas, baby, I love you with all of my heart, but I hope you know that I will be sharing this with every person that I know."
Dean groaned and laid his head back on Cas's shoulder. "Yea." Dean turned his head and kissed Cas's cheek. "Breakfast?"
D looked up and gave a soft smile. He nodded. "You'll help me?" Castiel tried to act surprised. D squeezed his hand tightly like he was the one comforting Cas. "Thank you, D. I know other patients will benefit from this." D wiggled himself further into the sheets and held onto Bee and Castiel's hand. He seemed to be quite proud of himself.
As Cas laid there willing his biology to calm down and thinking about the events of the previous night, a thought that had been tucked away in the back of his mind pushed its way forward: what if Dean was just scared? What if he didn’t really want this? It was entirely plausible, understandable, and probable. So, Cas decided to give Dean a choice. He was not going to make this one choice for him.
"Come on, baby boy, it's time for you to go to sleep. I'll go to bed, too. It's already 8:30. We'll try getting into an actual routine tomorrow."
"Of course, Bobby. So, what are you two up to today?" Cas signed over his signature from the day before and handed it back to Bobby.
His phone vibrating shook him out of his trance. Cas saw it was Gabe and answered quickly. "Hey, Gabe," he whispered.
"You're so smart. Maybe you should be the specialist, huh, kid? Which one do you think you're at today?"
"As of now, no. He can't tell us his name and Alastair claims he got all of these omegas legally. I seriously doubt that, but it does make me wonder if a family member was upset with the kid's designation and sold him off. He doesn't match any missing person's report. Alastair says that his name is '67.'"
Cas shook his head and looked back at D's room. "Also, our patient has a request for some yogurt with honey. Is there any way we could get that for him?"
"I like pretty much anything on a burger. I even had one once at a carnival with a doughnut on top."
A quick nod. Dean wasn't about to waste energy opening his eyes, though. "Is it okay for me to get some things from my house while you're taking your nap? I need to change my clothes and I would like to get a couple of blankets for us. It gets a bit chilly in here and I hate those scratchy things that they give us." Castiel could hear the heart monitor indicating that Dean's pulse was increasing. "I will be back as soon as possible. I'll be back again today, but if I stay in these clothes too much longer, I'm going to start smelling."
Cas hummed for a moment as he thought. "Dean, you're an intelligent man. Do you mind if I tell you about a case that I helped with while I was a graduate student?"
As Cas moved the car into the garage and sat their bags on the couch, he felt knots literally tightening in his stomach. This perfect omega, who had been sexually abused, wanted Castiel to be with him... sexually. Ugh. How in the world was he supposed to know how to provide Dean with what he needed to feel comfortable? Having sexual encounters with your True Mate who was also still kind of your patient was not something most training courses covered.
“Baby boy, I know you’re overthinking this. Daddy knows you so well; known you for so long. When you’re scared, you need your Daddy. That’s all there is to it. That’s not complicated. When you’re not scared and you’re a big boy, I’ll just be Cas. But when you need something filling your little-boy mouth and to be held, your Daddy is going to take care of you.”
"Yes, if you could just sign this quick little form with your statement on it." Bobby gave Cas a quick wink. Cas had signed this form the day before. Apparently, Sam wanted to see Dean, too.
“Excellent, baby.” Cas leaned down and kissed Dean’s forehead. “Give yourself a sexy compliment, baby. I’m so hard looking at those pretty lips. I wish they were around me. I need you to help me, okay? Help Daddy cum.”
"Burnt toast it is. Oh! And then can we listen to music or watch TV or something where we can cuddle in an actual bed?"
Dean grunted his understanding. Cas grabbed his chin and made Dean look at him. "Understood, baby boy?"
"Ready for breakfast?" After their little spat earlier, Cas wasn't about to bring up Dean's behavior towards other people today.
He nervously waved back. "Hi." Castiel could tell that he was nervous, but he always knew Ellen was wonderful in these situations. Everyone warmed up to her eventually. They were much quicker to make nice once they had some of her food warming their belly.
“Yea, seriously. It’s not even a thing. Happy to help.” Dean smiled and waved as he walked out. It was only then that he realized his mistake.
Cas gave Dean a moment to respond, but the omega did not seem interested in filling the silence. So, he spoke up himself. "Yes, thank you for such a warm welcome, Mrs. Wesson."
The omega kept his eyes trained out of the window, but reached over and squeezed Cas's hand that was resting on the center console.
Cas was sure that Dean already knew what he was about to say. "We could get a purer form of my scent if I were to..." he breathed out. "If I were to have an orgasm."
"Alastair gave us a name. One of his hush-hush guys that took care of things for him on the down low."
He gently wiped down Dean’s back and kissed the clean skin. “Beautiful, baby boy. Absolutely beautiful. Tell me, what do you need? I know what I want to give you, but now is your time to talk like a grown up.” Holy hell, how was he this perfect? How did he know how to make Dean’s worries disappear? Cas removed the paci and laid down on his back beside Dean, waiting for his response.
Charlie gave a small smile and gestured for them to go into the hallway. Cas looked back at D who had his head craning to see what was going on. "I'm only going to borrow him for two minutes, okay, buddy?" Charlie gave D a thumbs up and he gave her another angry growl. Charlie turned to Cas, "Well at least he didn't throw anything at me this time."
Dean pulled back a bit and grinned a mischievous grin. "Oh, now I gotta know, Alpha. What's one stupid thing that you've said? Or done? Any awkward moments to share?"
"Well," Sam gave a small smile. "Those are the two articles that I found. So, clearly, I found your parents. Maybe... I don't know, Mr. Novak? Mr. Singer? What do you think?"
"You're my perfect boy." They stared at each other for a moment, smiling wide, before Cas decided they both needed to be cleaned up.
At this point, Castiel knew the drill for getting Dean to wake up safely and without throwing a punch or two. The alpha lifted his wrist to Dean's nose and remained still. After a few seconds, Dean's breathing slowed and his head stopped turning. His nose settled onto Cas's wrist and he took in a shaky breath. Cas moved a bit closer and cupped Dean's cheek in his hand. "Hey, D. Wake up, sweet boy. It's just a nightmare. You're here. You're safe."
"Shh... it's okay. We'll figure this out tomorrow." Castiel took Dean's hand. Dean gripped it as tightly as he could.
Bobby gave him a knowing smile. "I understand. It's horrible what happened, but it's good that he's going to pay."
Unfortunately, all good things must come to an end, and Bobby's watch alerted them all that it was time for he and Sam to get back to righting the world's wrongs. Castiel nodded and shook their hands again as he walked towards the cash register. He left Dean and Sam by themselves while he and Bobby paid.
Dean grinned and playfully shoved at Sam's shoulder as the three of them walked out of the living room.
Castiel sat on the bed. The thought of leaving Dean and never seeing him again made Cas shiver. He would rather spend every moment of the rest of his life trying to figure out what was going on between the two of them than to walk out of the room. He knew Dean was it for him. Why was he even surprised when Dean confirmed it? He had never once treated a patient- or anyone for that matter- the way he treated Dean. He never let a partner tease his mating gland with their teeth. He never let a patient hold his hand for hours on end- even if they did need touch therapy. He certainly hadn't dreamt of a patient's gorgeous eyes before.
Cas dropped the food onto the nurses' station desk and held up on finger to the nurse on duty. He jogged into 327 and found D screaming while Dr. Roche was putting the stuffed bee onto the nightstand beside the kid.
Gabriel was right. D was so conditioned to think that touch would cause pain that he completely dismissed the thought that it could heal him. "I promise you, D. I will not hurt you by holding your hand." He paused. "The doctors will be here in five minutes. I wish I could give us more time to talk about it, but your health is in danger, D."
"Holy fuck." Dean whispered to himself as he got his sippy cup down and filled it with milk. Work was going to be tough as shit.
"Of course not. We have plenty of omegas willing to testify that will put that bastard away for multiple life sentences. If he can just talk by the trial, I'll be surprised. You've got your hands full, but I know you can do it."
"It's your choice, D. From here on out, everything is your choice. If you are willing to hold my hand for even one minute, it could keep you alive. I'm an alpha and our DNA helps us--" he was cut off by the most wicked snarl Cas had ever heard from anyone of any designation. "I'm sorry." He took a moment to remember his training. "I'm Castiel and you're D, right? You like me, right? And you know that I like you. Since we both like one another, since we are friends, it's okay for us to hold hands. It won't hurt-" the kid stopped snarling long enough to scoff at Castiel's suggestion.
According to the GPS, they still had a couple of minutes to go before arriving at the Wesson household. Dean took advantage of this and snuggled his nose into the crook of Cas's neck. The alpha leaned his head over and let it rest on his omega's. "I love you, baby."
"I see that. Now, Mr. Novak, I am fully aware that Dean does not need to go on the stand. However, I would like to ask you if Dean has shared any specific information with you regarding his abuse or his abusers. Again, since you received this information as his rehab specialist, you can share that information."
Cas smiled and wrapped Dean up in his arms before rolling onto his back. Dean settled into his spot and let Bee rest on Cas's stomach. "Ugh, one stupid thing that I've done..."
Dean chuckled and rolled his eyes. “Cas, I want you so bad right now.” He lifted his hips to prove his point.
He didn't see Dean in the kitchen or living room, so Castiel assumed that he was in the bedroom. Sure enough, he heard the sound of Dean stripping out of his jeans, so he left him for a few more moments. When Dean didn't come back out of the bedroom after a full two minutes, Castiel walked in quietly.
Dean had already begun dozing when his bedside lamp turned on. “Scoot over.” Cas left no room for argument.
He thought about the way Dean’s mouth would feel sucking marks onto his neck, among other places, while he chose his outfit.
The alpha shook his head and furrowed his brow. "You won't go to a shelter, baby. You can come home with me. I have enough space for us both and I have gotten used to you, as well. I need my Dean." Cas smiled and kissed the top of Dean's head. Then he nosed along Dean's hair and enjoyed the feeling of the short strands tickling his nose and lips. "Always need you."
"D... I'm gonna..." Cas tried to warn the omega, but instead of moving away, Dean positioned himself on top of the alpha so when Cas came, it covered his chest. Cas's hips jerked and he felt himself cover his omega.
Dean could honestly feel tears wanting to form in his eyes. He wanted Cas so fucking badly. It was torture. He had to give the man credit, he was pretty fucking creative. Sadistic, but creative. “Open your mouth and start, baby. Genuine compliments.”
"Got bacon. Got pie. I'm fine, alpha." Dean smiled and stood. Gabe shot Cas an impressed look. Cas shrugged and smiled up at his omega.
"You foiled my plan. Fine. Well, before I left home for that date, Gabe met me outside. He lived a couple of houses down from us growing up. He asked me a lot of questions about the date and the girl and his last question was 'do you have protection?'"
"Well, in all honesty, I was just assigned your case." Dean's shoulders dropped a bit. "But, I am so glad I got your case. You're a fantastic person to spend time with, Dean."
Suzanne chuckled. "No need for that here, Dean. Well..." she took a deep breath. "As you know, I am a beta. Betas have a much smaller chance of conceiving with alphas or omegas, but David and I were destined to be together. We fell in love on a field trip in the fifth grade and have been together ever sense."
Dean continued to suck and keep eye contact and he turned on his side, facing Cas. He wrapped his leg around the other man’s hips and began grinding. He just needed that little bit of friction. His ass was still nice and sore and sticky with cum, his mouth full. He just needed some friction and for his Daddy to tell him it was okay. As his cock caught on Daddy’s jeans and touched the bare skin above the waist, Dean looked up and whimpered around Cas’ fingers, hoping to signal that he was close. “Cum, baby boy. Cum for your daddy.”
Roche shook his head. "It's unprecedented because no one has ever been in his condition, not because you're some miracle worker. You know, I hear that you're the best at what you do, but until I see more progress, I'm requesting that you are off of this case. You seem to be too personally involved."
Dean washed his hair and body strictly from muscle memory. He wasted no conscious thought on cleaning himself. Instead, he focused on Daddy. It would be this hot if Daddy was in here, even if they used cooler water. It was easy to slip into the fantasy. He put the pacifier in his mouth and sucked.
Cas' eyes turned dark as he looked up at Dean. "I'm not going to help you, Dean. I'm going to make you."
"Yea, man, me too. Like I said, I found some newspaper articles, but I don't know if the dates are accurate or if it's actually even them. If I am right, then they both died in Kansas. Mom died on November 22nd, 2001, and Dad died on September---"
Dean sucked the digit as hard as he could. Licking, sucking, massaging, begging Castiel to let him taste his cock and cum. He understood having to compliment himself… That made sense. It matched the rule that he broke. But not being able to have his mouth full of Daddy’s cum? That wasn’t fair. He only tasted it twice but he was addicted. It was so fucking filthy and yummy at the same time. Cas caught on to his little plan of seduction. “You disobeyed me, love. Your reward was going to be to have me feed you while you sat on one of your toys and you were going to have Daddy’s cum for dessert. It’s a shame you won’t be getting that tonight… Maybe next time.”
"He's never gonna stop." Charlie and Castiel said in unison. They laughed and Cas shook his head. "Thanks, Charlie. I really appreciate it."
"Oh, no." Dean sat up and looked down at Cas. His eyes were almost shut because he was smiling so hard.
Cas laughed and wrapped his arm around Dean's waist as they walked back to their temporary room. "Yes, you did, D. I'm so proud of you. It seemed like you two had a lot in common."
"I guess you're right." Bobby lifted up slowly to look out of the window again. "I think we're in the clear. Unfortunately, as much fun as this is, I do need to go over some points of the case with you, Mr. Novak."
Ah!! I couldn't fit everything I was planning into one chapter. I will update ASAP! It will be no later than Wednesday.
“Fuck yes, I want to be in an official relationship. I’m not ready to tell any of our friends ‘cause can you even imagine how much they’re gonna mess with us now? But, yea, Cas. I want a relationship. I want to be your boyfriend,” Dean drug out the last word in a taunting way, almost singing, “and your lover,” he continued the pattern, “and your baby…” He laughed as Cas hit his arm again.
Dean pulled him down by putting both of his hands around the nape of his neck. "I guess that's okay." He smiled and carefully touched their lips together. It was still all so new, so... special. Neither one of them wanted to ruin what they were feeling. "But, I've got a problem Cas, and I can't think of another person who I would want to help me with it." Before Cas even had the chance to comment on Dean rutting into his leg, he flipped them over so that he was on top.
For a moment, he panicked because he couldn't see Dean. The omega had closed the black-out curtains and the bathroom door so it was completely dark in the room. He wasn't in the bed, either, which concerned Cas. The alpha breathed a sigh of relief when he saw that the closet door was ajar. His experience in rehab reminded him that victims of abuse often sought out environments similar to the ones they were held in. It made him sick to his stomach to think about, but it did keep him from thinking that Dean had completely lost his mind.
Dean clapped once. "Yea, great plan. Okay." He scanned the tops of the aisles looking for different signs. "Okay, I want to look at the posters, pillows, and the entertainment section. I don't know if I've told you this, but I love westerns. Like, I love them."
Thank you for the kudos and comments! I get so much dopamine when I get one of those notifications. Thanks, guys!
Cas didn't realize it, but by the time they were in their room, he was squeezing Dean's waist tightly. "I am so glad that you have so much in common with him, D." The alpha smiled, but he knew that it didn't meet his eyes.
"If you go, there are two outcomes. You find out that they didn't adopt you because they didn't know you existed or that were brothers. If that happens, I'm sure that they will sweep you into their family. If you find out otherwise... that they did know... then I'll knock out the dad, call the mom a fat, ugly bitch, and we leave."
"What? That you'd be served by the most handsome man in America? I know. It's shocking." Ash laughed to himself and gave Bobby his card back.
Dean leaned back and gave one of his rare full body laughs. "Hell yes, absolutely." He looked up and down until he found a flat, obscenely yellow pillow. "How cute would Bee look on this? Huh? How freaking adorable?"
"Yes... well... my parents are, but they earned it. I haven't earned it yet so I don't feel comfortable using it or the perks that come with it. I decided to make an exception." The beta continued scuffing his feet along the tile.
"Do you want me to hold you, sweetheart?" Castiel thought he would spontaneously combust if Dean said no. Those sick bastards. They stole his omega's innocence and happiness. He needed to protect and comfort his omega. Or, the omega, he should say.
"Well, there's plenty of space in our room. I spend most of my time, or I spent most of my time, in the living room."
Dean looked down and thought for a bit. Cas thought that he may have gone to sleep, but the omega asked, "So, what do I do about today?"
The first pacifier he tried was a light lilac color. It was a little larger than the one Dean had been using. He sucked it for a while and calmed down his earlier thoughts. It was comforting to have something this large in his mouth. It was a little shorter than his thumb, but it felt enormous. It was so wide. It felt right. The next pacifier was a in a little clear box with a different store name. It was very different than the other two. It was for adults. Fuck. Dean could tell. The part that he sucked on filled his mouth completely and if that wasn’t a giveaway, the navy letters “Daddy’s Boy” on the outside sure was. This was his favorite. It labeled him as his Daddy’s.
“Baby boy, your job was to finish those tasks. I am happy and proud that you were honest with me, but you have to have a consequence for this. Understand?”
Dean continued pointing to the three of them several times in a random order. Every time, Castiel would respond with their name. He didn't know how long they sat there with Dean pointing and Cas responding "Cas, Dean, Bee, Bee, Dean, Dean, Cas." Dean eventually rolled his head to the side to look at Castiel. He held out his hand and Castiel took it in his.
"Shut up, man, people may hear you." Dean smiled and kissed Cas on the cheek as they walked. "I do, but I love westerns more. I noticed your DVD collection was lacking in both. Shame, shame."
The feeling of his boxers moving against his neglected cock and the warmth of the blankets made him whimper. He laid down on his stomach and rutted against the mattress some more. Daddy had never mentioned this game of theirs turning into something physical, but it was so easy to make that jump in his mind. He knew himself too well to think cuddles would be enough for forever. Dean stayed on his stomach, gently moving his hips, as he thought about what it would feel like for Cas to push into him from behind, running his lips up and down the side of his neck. Whispering dirty praises into his ear for being filled up so good.
Dean walked to the bathroom, wanting to drag this part of the list out as long as possible. He got his favorite fluffy towel, washcloth, and his paci. The towel was a light pink. He told Cas that it was a white one that got screwed up because of a red cloth in the wash. Nope. Not at all. Dean liked pink. It was such a soft color, and it looked so pretty when pressed against his tan skin.
“Sleep if you need to baby, but remember, you have a to-do list to finish today. My baby has to take care of himself on his day off work. Understand?” Dean nodded. Cas could see his smile playing at the back of the toy. Cas removed it. “Understand?”
Castiel couldn't help the quiet growl that he made. At the end of the day, he was an alpha. A good alpha, he believed, but an alpha nonetheless. He was beyond thrilled to have his omega pliant and begging to taste him. "Of course, baby. I'm close. Open your mouth, sweet boy."
Cas opened the door to the garage and quickly grabbed their jackets from the backseat. He let out a sigh of relief. They were safe. They would be fine. As he turned to go back inside, he felt a sharp pinch in his neck.
Cas could practically hear Dean's mind screaming at him that he had fucked everything up. "Nothing is wrong, baby. I just want to do something a little differently. That's all."
Castiel didn't need to stop at the restroom to calm down prior to this visit. He wasn't even fidgety when he was in the elevator. He was looking forward to seeing D today. He wore a slight smile as he walked over to the nurses' station.
"Of course, it's no trouble at all." Cas smiled and turned to Sam. "Sam, it is certainly nice to see you again, as well."
Castiel's heart felt like it would burst. "Everyone here knows that you're my omega and that I'm your alpha. I won't let anyone forget that anytime soon." He smiled as Dean continued rubbing his wrist over his scent and mating glands.
Castiel would have never guessed that Sam's family was well off considering the too-big suit he fashioned at their previous meetings and his run-down car. He admired Sam for his integrity and work ethic, but also felt elation that Sam wanted to know about his family as much as Dean did.
"Excuse me, I'm here to see the patient in room 327. I am from the Omega Defense Team. I am his rehabilitation specialist."
"Gentlemen, I believe it is time for us to take our leave. Castiel, I will let the night shift know that you will be with D tonight." Charlie smiled as she shut the door and left.
He didn't know any of the details of Dean's imprisonment, apart from the abuse that Gabriel had described. He didn't know how long Dean had been tormented. He didn't know where Dean came from. He didn't even know the kid's last name. Cas found himself, for the thousandth time, doubting his ability to help Dean. He was healing so rapidly that Castiel found himself more confused than anything else. How could this omega heal so quickly and completely? How could he be so comfortable with Castiel after experiencing such extreme abuse? Nothing made sense in the early morning hour.
When Dean opened his eyes from his nap, he was pleasantly sore all over. His paci had fallen out at some point and it was just him and his blanket in bed. He sat up, listening for where Cas might have gone off to. He could hear something in the kitchen and hoped that Daddy was cooking.
"Fuck 'em." Dean laughed and pulled away from Cas. The alpha just smiled and stared as his mate walked to the other side of the room to put on his shoes. How did he get so damn lucky? "Fifty seconds, alpha."
As he opened the hospital doors, a chime buzzed to alert the staff. He didn't even notice that yesterday. He briefly wondered what he may have failed to notice about D, as well.
Cas relaxed and pulled him in closer. "Always, sweet boy. Always." Cas kissed Dean's neck and pulled back to look at his face. "Do you want to take a shower now?"
Thankfully, Cas decided to move first. He broke eye contact with Dean and walked over to the side of the bed that Dean was currently glued onto. He didn't say anything-- he simply held out his hand and gently nodded towards the bedroom door.
For some weird reason, the term of endearment did nothing to Dean other than force him to cuddle closer. He didn’t feel strange. He didn’t feel awkward. He felt loved. But, something was missing.
He looked at his phone and saw it was 2:50. Daddy would be home any minute. Until then, Dean refused to move… consequences be damned.
"Yes, love?" Cas tried to continue massaging Dean's feet, but the omega moved so that he was sitting with his knees to his chest.
"Not too terribly long. It was a small dose of a fast-acting sedative. Comes in handy for rowdy Alphas when I'm on call. I happen to appreciate its function much more in this line of work, though. Knocks out the target, metabolizes quickly, and leaves just enough time for you..." Roche paused, "and I to find our own little piece of paradise. I'm looking quite forward to it, aren't you, my dear?"
So, he decided to do the one thing that helped him calm down. It worked when he was four and it still worked like a charm.
"Well, we are putting together some different witness statements on your case and I believe Sam is doing some school work."
"Best song?" Dean was now sitting up instead of lounging on the pillows. He looked optimistic and excited as he tossed the ball back. Cas was surprised that this much conversation hadn't sucked out all of Dean's energy. And the fact that he was throwing and catching the ball so well on his first try? Truly astounding.
"Oh, you're gonna make me? You're so big and bad." Dean smirked and nuzzled into the crook of Cas' neck and shoulder. How was it possible for a person to even smell this good? He smelled like his spicy aftershave, a little bit of his citrus laundry detergent, and a lot like sweat. It was yummy. Dean loved a challenge as much as they next guy, but how he was supposed to not submit to this perfect specimen of a man was beyond him.
"Yes, Daddy?" He was never going to get tired of hearing that name come so easily from Dean's soft lips.
"Could my dear omega possibly make it two minutes without bacon? Or is the situation just too dire?"
"When you..." Cas propped himself up on his elbows. "When you came..." He licked his lips and rubbed the back of his hand over his mouth to get rid of some extra lube. "When you came, you called me 'Cas'. You didn't call me 'Daddy.'"
With that, Dean gave a small smile. He looked over at Cas and gave his hand a strong squeeze. Cas felt it was his time to speak up. "Please let your lawyers know that they have the full support of the ODT. Any resources that we have that can support this cause will be happily provided." Cas knew the world of shady adoptions all too well through his job. The overwhelming majority of adoption agencies were excellent and helped children find perfect homes. There were a few out there, though, that saw children as price tags. They would split up siblings to get multiple adoption fees. It was sickening and he knew that people were working on shutting these down. It made his gut sink to the floor to know that the love his life was a victim of theirs, too.
Sorry I took so long to update. In case you didn't know, teaching in a pandemic is literally the worst. Anyways, I will update a lot this weekend!
Cas brushed his teeth quickly, just to erase the after-kiss breath. He enjoyed it, but he doubted that Sam or his parents would be too keen on the scent. When he stood up from rinsing his mouth, Dean trapped him against the counter with both arms. He could see the omega was smiling wide behind him in the mirror.
"No, babe..." Dean took a deep breath. "You have been so great to me. You have stuck your neck out for me more than once and we just met last week. I'm just some kid who fucked up. I messed it all up. Made the wrong choice. And you're my, ya know..." Dean waved his hand around, hoping for Cas to finish his sentence.
Dean smirked and nibbled Cas' ear lobe. "Hmm, really baby? What you got planned for me to do to you?"
Cas felt the hard tile under his knees as he lowered himself beneath the omega's height. D was in charge here. "I don't want to see you hurt, D. I want to see you better. I want to hear your voice and see your smile. Please hold my hand when the doctors come in. Please?"
“You have three rules that you have to follow. If you do not follow them, then you will be punished when we get home.”
"And... maybe we could celebrate the day, huh, alpha?" Dean slipped Cas's earlobe between his teeth and nibbled teasingly. "Because I've got this adrenaline in my system and I need to get it
"Why chance it?" Gabriel joined him in the living room and sat with one leg draped over the arm of the recliner. He loved making himself at home.
"I haven't checked it recently. I just wait to take it when I get it serviced when the sticker tells me to go." Ah, another people-puzzle-solver, Cas discovers.
Cas knew that regardless of what the situation felt like that he had to address what he had done. "Dean, sweet boy, I am so sorry. I will never forgive myself for leaving you. I should have been in that room with you. I should have never--"
This shirt was only part of the nirvana Dean found himself in after he and Daddy had finished their… “playtime.” The blanket Cas had bought him was gripped in one hand, the toy squirrel tucked into his elbow. He knew he wasn’t supposed to suck his thumb anymore, but it just felt right. It felt right to lay down, hold his soft toys close, suck his thumb, and drift into unconsciousness as he waited for Daddy to come back.
Cas looked over at Bobby and was met with a shrug. "Well, Sam, first of all, I'm very impressed with your research. I'm sure that was not an easy task given what little information you had to begin your search."
"Babe, no!" Dean fell back on the bed and covered his face with the hood of his jacket. "No, you did not!"
“What are you good at in bed?” Cas turned his head and nibble at Dean’s jaw before sitting back on the couch; perfect dick still red and begging for release right in front of its victim.
"Dr. Roche, may I ask why you took this patient's therapy aid away?" Castiel felt like ripping this man to shreds.
Dean yawned again and hummed. He tucked Bee under his arm and walked back into the bedroom. Cas busied himself with putting the dishes into the dishwasher and sending a quick email to Singer as he allowed Dean some privacy for his nightly routine. He heard the toilet flush and figured that it was safe to go into the bedroom.
Castiel tried to keep his composure. He wasn't sure if he was sad that he couldn't smell Dean, angry that Dean had kept this from him, or absolutely elated that this perfect man was (apparently,) his. "What do I smell like to you?"
Dean shrugged. "I'm not making promises that I know I can't keep." While Sam tried to seem stern, Dean tried to seem carefree and confident. Castiel knew otherwise, but Sam seemed convinced.
Cas turned on the documentary, which was something about coral reefs, and ate his sandwich as well. Slowly, the sandwiches disappeared, the plates moved to the coffee table, and, somehow, Dean's feet ended up in Castiel's lap. Cas was happy to slowly massage the stress of their day out of his omega.
Dean looked up and saw Daddy was looking down as him with a happy smile on his lips. Without realizing he was doing it, Dean opened his mouth and stuck his tongue out. Cas chuckled and shook his head. He brought his hand up to Dean’s mouth and moaned as Dean began cleaning their mess off of his hand. “G-good boy, Dean. My good baby boy.”
“Um… I need to take a shower and come back in here with nothin’ on ‘cept my toys if I need them. I need to… I need to sit at Daddy’s feet when I get in here.”
Of course, it was a big deal, but Castiel was concerned that people were going to start expecting too much of Dean. And of himself. Once Dr. Roche had left the room and the quiet laughs and hushed words had ceased, Dean quickly fell asleep. Saying those few words completely drained him. Casitel also felt pressure on his job performance because he really couldn't quite take credit for anything that had happened. It was a natural result of Dean receiving touch. He was expecting to hear that Dean needed to be up on his feet, or to form complete sentences, or to care for himself at any moment. Cas may not know some things, but he knew that those ideas were just fever dreams. What if Castiel was blamed and taken off of Dean's case? Cas couldn't let himself think of that.
"No, I need to just get out in the air. Then it won't just be living inside of my fucking head." Neither man moved from their hunched over positions around the other. "There were a lot of other omegas down there. The smell... It was awful. I knew Alastair was a bad guy. We all were. But, I never... I never knew about them. Not until I was one of them. And that started the cycle. Whoever... visited the downstairs... would wear gloves and a condom. They never undressed. Well, not for me. For the other omegas they did. I had asked for it. I told him that I would rather--"
Dean shook his head and hit his forearm with his fist. Castiel calmly wrapped his hand around Dean's wrist. "Hey, now. None of that, okay? You don't need to punish yourself. You did nothing wrong, honey." Dean's eyes flicked up for a moment at the pet name. Fuck, that habit was far from being under control, huh, Cas?
Finally, Roche's belt opened and he pulled his zipper down slowly. He made some movements and Castiel knew that he was finally exposed.
"Well, gentlemen," the doctor started, "I will submit these to the lab. Usually these results take a few days, but we received notice that this is an extremely important case and needs to be rushed to the top of the list. Give us about half an hour." The doctor nodded and headed out of the room.
"I'm sure he does. I don't know of anyone who would be disappointed to have you in their life." Cas frowned at the small huff Dean gave. He walked over and lifted Dean's chin.
Dean's eyes crinkled as he smiled. "I guess. Or I could just wear these pajamas all day and stay in bed with you. I really like this whole lazy-day thing we've had going."
“You know, since we’re going to be with other people, it might be best for me to drink from that.” Dean laughed at how Castiel jumped and turned around with a wild look in his eye.
Dean ran his hand under the water and checked to see if it was warm. It was comfortable for him, but Daddy said to make it hot. Naturally, Dean had to listen so he turned the handle a little more. He stepped into the shower and placed his pacifier on the soap ledge. That was for later. For now, he needed to get clean before he could pleasure himself in any way.
Castiel thought for a moment and tried to choose his words very carefully. "Well, there are some more ways to help. Obviously, mating and having a close bond with someone would help, but we both know we need to wait a bit on that." Dean nodded in agreement. "The other way that I could think of is... getting a more potent sample of my scent."
Charlie covered her mouth with both of her hands. She regained her composure quickly, as nurses have the ability to do, and looked at Dean. "Well, it is a pleasure to meet you Dean. I'm Charlie. I hope that we get to be very good friends."
"I told you, sweet boy. Whenever you are ready, then you let me know and I will be more than happy to put a bite on your neck." Cas rolled onto his side so he could see Dean's face.
Dean held onto his hand and looked down. "Protect you." Castiel could hardly hear the whisper, but it hit him like a freight train. This omega, who had experienced God only knows what, wanted to protect this alpha. What a truly extraordinary creature he was.
"Um, obviously I'll need those as soon as possible. And why the hell not? You have a garden tub, man! Those things are friggin' fantastic." Dean kept a smile on his face as he sat on the edge of the tub and began running the water. He tested it with his fingers a few times before plugging the drain.
Castiel parked his car in the first row of parking spaces in front of The Roadhouse. It was a staple burger-joint in the community and Castiel felt a special connection to the place considering that Ellen had worked there for some time before moving over to the ODT. He spent many childhood birthday parties and awkward, acne-filled dates in one corner or another of those four walls. He thought that it would be a great place for Dean and Sam to hang out. A couple of pool tables and arcade games would give the two space to feel some independence without letting Dean wander too far from the alpha's sight.
That tiny sound triggered Castiel to quickly undress and and make his way over to the walk-in shower. "Hey, 'mega." He stepped in and shivered, despite the warm water.
The two sat in silence for a few miles before Dean spoke up, "Oh, actually, before anything, I need a good shower. Get the hospital 'ick' off of me."
He looked through the tiny window in the door and saw the omega look in his direction. Then he rolled his head to the other side to look out of the window again. Castiel took his acquiescence as a good sign. Before settling into his chair for the day, Cas began placing some items on the nightstand where the omega could reach them. "I thought that you might like something to hold or entertain yourself with today. I have some stuffed animals," Cas placed a plush bee, cat, and giraffe on the table. "I also got a couple of puzzles and a coloring book. You can use any of these at any time that you like." He put the two block puzzles down and hoped D wouldn't be offended by the 2-4 years of age notice on each puzzle. If he could read it. However, it seemed that the omega wasn't going to look at anything that Cas had brought. When he looked at the omega, his eyes were closed.
"He also seems to have plenty of connections. Lawyers, police officers, hell, there's probably even a judge or three up his sleeve. He already seemed to be familiar with the layout of the precinct, which is strange considering he doesn't even have a juvenile record."
I know this sounds like the end, but it is most definitely not. It is just the end of Dean's panic :)
Next chapter is going to be a.... who knows chapter? i've got a couple of ideas. Let me know what you think! This thing could go in any direction.
Dean went down as far as he could. The taste of strawberry almost overpowering the taste and scent of his Daddy. He sucked as hard as he could, but he knew that he couldn't move his head up an down. Not with the dildo ramming into his prostate with every fucking move he made. So, Daddy was generous and held his head where he wanted it as he fucked into his mouth. Or, as Daddy called it, his other hole. Soon, Dean could feel Cas' pumping come into his throat. He was so out of it that he didn't even realize that he was greedily swallowing every ounce and grinding on the dildo. Cas pulled out and sighed. Dean was a wreck. His face streaked in tears, cum, and a little strawberry filling. His skin was flushed and his body was shaking.
"Yea, of course. That's fine." Sam's bright grin lit up the office space. Cas sincerely hoped that the test would yield the results they all wanted. Dean needed this positivity so badly.
"It certainly sounds like you know what you're doing. Just keep it up and send me a report once a week and I'll stay out of your hair." Gabe took a big sigh. "So... I'm assuming that you're as anxious to hear about my interrogation as I was to hear about yours." Gabriel finally put the candy wrapper down. He put his elbows on his knees and began tapping his foot.  "Well, you said you don't want any details about the crime scene yet. I can't say that I blame you for that. So, let me tell you about Alastair. This asshole." Gabe gave a humorless chuckle. "For starters, he's a beta."
Cas waited for just a moment. enjoying his omega's touch, before bridging that small gap and pulling Dean closer to him. Dean immediately went lax in his arms as they began slowly discovering the taste of one another. The feel of their tongues. The soft, yet chapped, touch of their lips. There was no rush. Everything they had done so far- the way they met, the therapy, the time at the hospital- all felt rushed. This was different. This was slow. Unhurried. They had all the time in the world.
A pillow hitting the wall shook him out of his thoughts. D's head was no longer covered, but he staring straight ahead with bloodshot eyes. No emotion in his face or tremors in his features. Everyone in the room was looking at him. Slowly, D turned onto his back and laid his hand, palm up, weakly to his side. "D... do you want me to hold your hand."
Castiel calmed his anger. He knew that Gabe and MacLeod wouldn't allow this, but he needed to keep the peace and not cause a scene in front of Dean. "Very well."
Castiel flipped over to the next page and clicked his pen a couple of times. That's how you make sure that they still work, right? He knew his handwriting would be sloppy, but that was fine. He didn't have the patience to write down everything that happened with neat penmanship in mind. He was excited to record D's progress.
"Dude, we just found out we're brothers and you're already making me deal with your dirty laundry?" Dean sounded irritated, but his smile and wink showed he felt differently. If Cas had to guess, the omega was most certainly on cloud nine.
"Dean, the human brain, especially a child's, is extremely impressionable and malleable. It is not uncommon for children to suffer from memory loss, especially after traumatic physical and emotional events. There is no reason that you should feel guilty about your relationship with your brother. For one, he was three, and if his speech was delayed at all, which I'm sure it was, he probably hadn't formed many memories yet. Secondly, you were only seven when he was adopted. It was a perfect storm. Your age and situation were a dangerous combination. Do not blame yourself for your brain chemistry."
Castiel had never had problems with professionalism before. In fact, Gabriel had told him on more than one occasion that "life would be a lot more enjoyable without that stick up your ass." Something about D's fierce, yet gentle, spirit resonated with Castiel. He never wanted that smile to leave D's face. It was then that he remembered he had signed a two-year contract to take care of this young man.
Cas was shocked to think that Dean was under the impression that his designation dictated anything about his childhood. "Absolutely, not. The girl I told you about, her name is Ruby, and she recently presented as an alpha. She was one of my first cases so I was very involved with the family because I couldn't work as much with the actual patients. So, her mom and I kept in touch with her progress."
Castiel took a deep breath himself. "Thank you for sharing that with me. You are so incredibly strong, Dean. I am so proud of you for finding the strength to share that with another person, but also for how well you managed your speech. I'm so proud of you, baby. So, so proud of you."
The alpha couldn't say how long he sat there trying to make sense of what Dean told him. He knew the omega was expecting an answer, but he really couldn't give him one at this point. Regardless, he knew he had to say something or Dean may lose his mind. That was quite the confession and he needed to know Castiel wasn't going to abandon him. "When..." Cas cleared his throat. "When did you know?"
"Shh... sweet boy. We won't do that tonight. I think I know of something that you may like, though. Will you trust me?"
"Yea, that's fair. But first," Dean looped his arms around Cas' middle and spun him around. He barricaded him against the kitchen counter with his larger frame, "I love you and I hope you had a wonderful day."
"Oh, darling, he'll be fine. Unfortunately, we have to get going. We have somewhere to be. People to see. Services to provide... I'm sure you understand how your absence has impacted the company. With no whore to relieve stress during Alastair's detainment, life has been quite... tense." Roche's voice sounded even more irritating than normal. The beta loved hearing himself talk and Cas wanted to rip his throat out.
"Oh, I'm sorry. 327. He is in 327 and he has been marked as an aggressive patient. He has on ankle cuffs, but he will try to fight if you get close."
The chihuahua ushered them all into a small exam room. Sam and Dean sat in the two available chairs, leaving Cas to find a seat on the actual exam table. The nurse gave them all a quick smile before handing Sam the form she had mentioned and leaving. Considering that the nurse had no idea what type of DNA test that was going on in that room, Cas was 90% certain she thought they had all potentially knocked up the same person. Oh, well. Let her think.
"I was not j--" Dean cut off the alpha by pulling him close and kissing him hard. It wasn't even really a kiss, it was just his mouth pressed tightly against Castiel's.
Castiel had seen many of his patients over the years hesitate over using a toy or therapy aid that he provided them. Especially if it was something that was "for kids." So, he figured he would give the omega a chance to bond with his new friend. "I've got to run to the restroom. I'll be back shortly."
Cas turned over to turn off the bedside lamp. When he turned back, Dean was already in his space, ready for some serious cuddling. Dean arranged himself so he was right beside Cas. Head on his chest, leg securely around his hips. “Goodnight, Daddy.”
"You have." Dean's voice startled Cas and Suzanne. The omega walked over, sat, and took Suzanne's hands in his own. He cleared his throat a few times and Castiel appreciated the woman's patience. "I grew up too fast. I was never really just a kid. I never had that luxury. You... you gave that life to my little brother and I will always owe you my life for that. But maybe..." he paused as Mrs. Wesson choked back a sob. "Maybe we can be a part of each other's lives now." Dean's voice trailed off at the end of his sentence. Castiel knew that those walls were strong and fortified. It would take a lot to break them down completely.
The next week passed almost exactly the same as Dean's first "talking day." Meals, short therapy sessions, Cas showering and changing at home, cuddling, and some scenting from Dean. It was very monotonous and Cas would tell that Dean was getting antsy. The only thing that had really changed was the fact that Dean and Castiel couldn't seem to stop the growing bond between the two of them. They let pet names slip and cuddling to be too intimate. Cas knew it would eventually blow up in his, but for fuck's sake, when he looked at Dean, he didn't care.
Mrs. Wesson pushed him back and laughed as she dried her eyes. "Now, I believe that's enough crying for today." She took a breath and looked around the room. "The pizza will be here soon. Why don't you and Cas find us a game to play after lunch while I freshen up, hm?"
"Dude, I know. Same thing as a couple days ago. I've already gone through all of this. Gimme a minute."
As if by magic, the fear Dean was feeling was burned away and he felt his smile return. After Cas had climbed off of him, he retrieved his blanket, and cuddled into Cas' chest. He closed his eyes and sighed. The contrast of the soft blanket and the hard lines of Cas' chest soothed him.
"That... no... that aggression seems to be too extreme for Dean's behavior. Was there any trigger? Anything to explain such a change?"
Dean knew that he was supposed to be focused on the screen in front of him. He knew he should be laughing when Charlie, Cas, or Benny laughed. Act surprised when Sammy gasped. Something along those lines. No matter how hard he tried, he just couldn’t. It was thundering and lightning. He couldn’t ignore that.
Castiel let his thoughts wonder to Dr. Roche. He was still angry at him but he really couldn't blame him for his behavior. No one in recorded medical history had survived this long without touch. It was more likely for a person stabbed through the heart to survive with no complications that for D to come out of this hell he was in.
"Dean... we... not here... I..." Before Castiel had the chance to make a coherent sentence, Charlie burst through the door.
"The only update that the doctor included is that he seems to have nightmares. Heart rate spikes, sweats, the works."
The look on Dean's face was nothing short of elation. He kissed Cas quickly on the cheek and poured himself a large glass of milk. Before Cas could even grab a coffee mug, Dean was sitting at a booth and quickly ridding the plate of bacon. Cas chuckled to himself.
Dean blushed a bit. "Uh..." he flipped Cas off and he and Sam began laughing again. It was good sound. Cas couldn't help but smile at their interaction. He was man enough to admit that he was jealous of Sam to begin with, but seeing the two playfully punch each other's shoulders and snicker about profane gestures, it was clear Dean needed this friendship. Sibling. Whatever the tests results would say, Cas didn't see Dean leaving Sam behind.
While Cas was quite tired from the day, it seemed Dean was ready to stay awake all night and grow closer to the Wessons. The alpha understood, but he was a bit worried. It seemed that since he and Dean's relationship began, happiness was like a sugar high. It was fantastic and beautiful in one moment and swept away in another. He found the way that Suzanne and David ushered Dean into their home a bit unsettling. Cas knew they were wonderful people and he didn't worry about their intentions, (Gabe's full background check on each of them took care of that,) but he was concerned that something dark was waiting down their path. After all, every good moment that they had shared so far in their relationship was threatened by Roche, nightmares, self-doubt on both of their parts, and trauma that was not going away because of one good visit with new friends.
"My full name is Castiel James Novak." When Cas said the word 'full,' Dean's mouth turned into an "o" in understanding. He must have forgotten that term.
Dean could swear that Cas growled. "Mhmm, baby. Daddy loves that, too." He moved his hand back up so Dean could suck a little more. "Next is letter B. Blindfolds, begging, bondage..." Dean was certain that he shivered at the way Cas' voice dropped at the last item on that list.
The next chapter will be up within the next two weeks. I have had a lot going on with family and with work, so, it may be longer than my usual updates.
“You really like talking Daddy… Show me.” Dean smirked and looked up as innocently as possible through his lashes. He didn’t expect the… well… growl that came from Cas’ throat. All at once, his head was jerked backward by his hair, hot breath was in his ear, and a hand was around his leaking cock.
Dean was staying close to his side and his eyes flicked to various points of interest around the living room. The TV, piano, and a floor-to-ceiling bookshelf with board games kept his attention for the longest periods of time. Sam seemed to pick up on Dean's uneasiness and ushered him over to the board games. Cas could hear him suggesting different games to play after lunch. Sadly, Cas knew that Dean was still building up walls and was not about to agree to play a game. The question of why he was not adopted was still nagging at the omega and Castiel could see it written all over his face. He couldn't blame it for it, either.
"Oh, well, if you want. The doctor will be in soon to look over his stitches and bruising. I hope you have a nice morning." The nurse didn't think too much before power walking through the door. Clearly, Dean had left her feeling unsettled.
He could see their reflections in one of the windows of their home, but it was like he was looking at two strangers. The sirens were no longer blaring, but the lights gave the usually quiet street an eerie glow. The lights in combinations with the blood on Dean's head and the dizziness than still spun behind Cas's eyes made for an unnerving experience.
Dean leaned over and gave Cas a quick kiss before sauntering over to the front of the building. For a kid whose life was filled with loss and tragedy, Dean sure could fake some confidence.
Fuck. Suddenly, Cas was gone and walking to another room. As warm as he had been, that's how cold Dean was now. He took it to fucking far! FUCK! Why the hell had he said anything? He knew he was going to fuck this the fuck up.
Cas followed the gesture and saw Sam give Dean a quick one-armed hug. Dean stood in shock for a moment before patting Sam on the arm. Castiel knew that that kind of touch made Dean nervous and he was so proud of him for pushing himself out of his comfort zone. The omega gripped Sam's suit jacket and looked at him. He said something before giving a tight smile and walking over to Cas.
"You're welcome, Dean-O!" Gabe smiled and dug into his pie. "So, you guys want to watch some TV until the lawyer gets here?"
Dean's confidence drained from his face. "I think you're jealous. I won't... I won't hang out with him if it makes you uncomfortable, Alpha." Dean put his head and tried to pull away from Cas.
"Yea, yea. Dean's asleep, so, I want to stay quiet." Castiel looked over at the omega sleeping and all he wanted was to be able to sleep right next to him. He loved his warmth and the way he rubbed his chest. The way he bit his neck.
Dean closed his eyes and took a deep breath. He absent-mindedly scratched the top of Bee's head. (Bee's permanent home was by Dean's right side.) As he exhaled, Cas could notice the tremor in his breath. "Okay, well, I guess I need to start from the beginning, huh?"
"My apologies, Dean. Please, continue." Cas willed himself to control his voice and his scent, but he knew that he was failing miserably at both tasks.
Dean froze and knitted his brows together as his cock jerked and he came all over Cas’ hand. He blinked twice before he saw Cas’ mixing with his own. Sounds of their heavy breathing filled the room. So much love surrounding them and the evidence of their love covering them both. Both men were too afraid to move and break this trance or give either one of them the idea that this love  went so much further than the bedroom.
"Mmm..." Dean's eyes were closed and his breath was coming faster as he worked two fingers into his hole. He loved the burn.
"Novak. Castiel Novak. I was wondering if you could tell me anything specific about the patient's physical condition. Specifically, do you think there is anything physical hindering his speech or communication? Any evidence of hearing damage?" Castiel was sure that there was neurological damage- that's why he was here- but it was necessary to understand D's complete status before he brainstormed treatment options.
Cas calmed himself and willed his blush to disappear before following behind his omega. "I'm sorry, Dean. That was inappropriate of me."
Dean's smile confirmed that some guidelines were appreciated. The omega rubbed his nose along Castiel's mating gland. "Tell me what I need to do, Alpha. Please."
When Castiel returned, he was extra quiet and looked through the door window. The kid was holding the bee right at eye level with both hands. There was no emotion on his face, but he shut his eyes and touched his forehead to the plushie. Castiel could see bruises around his wrists and cuts on his arms. What the hell had been done to this omega? Shaking his head to refocus, Cas knocked on the door. D immediately put the bee down, but he didn't hide it. He squinted at Cas as he walked in and growled low in his throat. Cas could see the grip on the bee tighten.
Sooooo.... not really sure where this came from? I sat down and it just kind of happened? Okay, then. Well. Enjoy.
With the moment spoiled and the reminder of where the hell they were at, the two men looked at one another and burst out into laughter. "I.. I definitely forgot about that."
He glanced at the picture books, but decided he didn’t want to read them. He wanted Daddy to read him bedtime stories. He felt of the blanket and rubbed against his cheek. It was so soft and perfect. The squirrel plushie was his new favorite thing, though. For sure.
"It might as well be. I was thinking since you like seem to like dirty talk so much, I would see just how desperate I can get you by talking about all of your favorite things to do in bed."
