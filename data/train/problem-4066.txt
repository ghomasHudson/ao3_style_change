A consummate professional, Naomi takes this information in stride. “Then we can loan you something. I have four boys, surely we can put something together that will fit you.” When Dean just stares at her in confusion, she sighs. “I have behaved poorly in the past. Since Castiel seems to think that there is…” She pauses, then waves her hands between the boys, “a future here, I would like to try and make up for that indiscretion.”
"I want to paint," Dean whispers without thinking. Cas leans forward, squinting slightly.
With the way heat works, Dean tends to forget about his cock in lieu of attempting to fill the emptiness in his hole. It’s heavy and angry red, leaking onto the bed, and since presenting clearly hasn’t broken through Castiel’s impeccable self-control, Dean lays himself flat on his stomach and starts to grind against the blankets. The friction against his sensitive cock is heaven, and Dean pants, his free hand fumbling around until he finally,
“What’s going on?”
He’s pretty sure they won’t hate each other. Lisa is sweet and sunny and laughs at Dean’s jokes, and while Cas is more dry and kinda quiet, sometimes he laughs at Dean’s jokes too. They both like Dean, at the end of the day, so there’s really no reason they won’t like each other.
He’s a surprisingly affectionate alpha, Dean discovers, as they wait for the knot to go down. Dean usually likes this part well enough, the conversation and getting to be close to someone, but Castiel takes it to an entirely different level. He grooms Dean’s hair and scents him and kisses his skin and never asks for permission, but Dean doesn’t really mind. He’d say so if he did. He’d think it’s some weird sort of alpha instinct, except none of the other alphas Dean’s been with have been like this, so maybe it’s just Castiel.
So Castiel sighs. “Can we just play tennis?”
“Because it’s not important,” Cas answers, trying to sound soothing. “It’s completely irrelevant to our friendship, and not that big of a deal.”
“What?”
. He’s afraid of having Dean. Afraid of losing him. Of hurting him, or being hurt by him. Of getting too close, and not being able to be close enough. Castiel wants Dean but he has no idea what he wants from him, and that makes him afraid as well. He’s so conflicted by Dean, and no matter how much time he spends on his own, he can’t sort this out. It’s too much. And all of this on top of what’s going on with his mother and Michael, and Castiel feels like he’s about to burst from his own overwhelming confusion.
In his defense, he’s been around Pam longer than Victor has. He’s not sure if he believes in all her fortune telling methods, but there have been some pretty creepy moments. Like a couple years ago, when Pam read his palm and announced that he would only ever love one person. Ever since Lisa dumped him, Dean thinks about that a lot.
That mural always leaves Castiel feeling unsettled. He’s well aware that Dean has self-worth (and other) issues that he’s seeing a therapist for, but that strange, dark painting is like a glimpse into Dean’s head, and it’s terrifying. Castiel doesn’t like to think about how this is what Dean was going through back then, that he felt so lost and alone and only continued to isolate himself instead of talking to anyone. It makes Castiel concerned that Dean could fall back into that space, and no one would know until it was too late.
Why is he having sex dreams about
“You mean they’re boring.”
Castiel freezes, and makes a stiff attempt at an apologetic bow, but Mary just laughs and shakes her head, reaching to touch the alpha’s face. “No need for formalities, Cas.” Her eyes briefly dart to Dean, a smirk on her lips. “You’re family now.”
Castiel smothers the chiding voice in his head chanting
Everyone turns to stare at the newcomer, a short boy who hasn’t gotten rid of his baby-fat yet and is attempting to cover it up with a trim-but-impressive beard. One hand is stuck in his pocket, while the other leans against a black umbrella as he smiles at the table. “What are you guys doing here?”
, isn’t that funny?” Anna pulls her hair into a ponytail as she stands, coming to join her brother at the breakfast bar. “Not to mention, Dean is kind of awesome. I was pretty pissed at him for what he did to you a few years ago, but now I’m just kind of mad at you for not jumping on it while you have the chance.”
“His family gives him quite a boost, I think.” She smiles at Castiel, and for a moment he thinks that fawning gaze is real. “His mother is part of the Adler family, you know, that preacher that comes on TV sometimes? But his father’s where it gets interesting.”
to his chest, and loosens his grip, embarrassed. Dean doesn’t seem to have noticed; he’s turned back to his sketchbook, dark lines creating circles and squares, the outline of another masterpiece.
Dean opens his mouth to argue, but stops short when he remembers his birthday earlier this year. Mary had taken the day off and baked him a pear pie, before taking him to meet his friends down to the arcade in Seaside. On the drive home, while Dean had still been happy and full, he’d told her about Bobby’s promise, that he’d start working in the garage that week, and he wanted to give her half of each paycheck.
Cas hanging out with some faceless, rich asshole his parents probably love, watching all the movies Dean wanted to introduce him to. Spending time with people of his own station, people who won’t tell him all the important behind the scenes things, who won’t engage him in a discussion about the cinematography or the animation or the music.
Finally.
“‘What do you think about in the shower?’” mocks the dark-haired boy who takes the seat on Castiel’s other side, just close enough that Castiel has to scoot away, almost into Charlie’s space. Charlie snorts, taking a stick when the new boy shakes a few at her.
Dean has made good use of the extra time he was given. He’s found candles from somewhere and lit them, casting a lovely golden light around the room, though Castiel has the fleeting, panicked thought that Dean’s poster- and sketch-covered room is a complete fire-hazard and now he has to worry about flailing limbs knocking something over and setting the whole house ablaze.
i haven't finished the summary for part four yet, but i'm hoping to get that done by the end of the week. i hope it's helpful!
“Did Sam finally make a move?” Charlie sounds delighted, and Castiel glances at her, frowning.
Correction:
“And what the hell does that mean?” Castiel snaps. His shoulders and knuckles hurt from the tension of trying to keep his anger under control.
“She’s not scaring me!” Castiel protests, drawing himself up on his stool, only to curl back up again when Pam sends him a flirtatious wink. Even Dean laughs at him this time.
“You’ll mess up the energy,” Pam chastises, and Dean laughs again.
“I’m gonna guess from the use of the word ‘tempestuous’ that you haven’t tried out much of Dean’s experience yet, “ Aaron continues, like he has no idea the hot water he’s already in. It’s strange that Castiel can be furious at Dean, and so furiously protective of him at the same time. “He’s a giver, not a user.”
He can feel slick dripping down the backs of his thighs, and he switches to three fingers, knuckle-deep. It’s not enough, it’s not
“Dean?” Castiel whispers, but Dean can’t respond, too caught up in the intensity of his heat. All he can manage is to keep fucking himself back on his fingers, forward against the bed, gasping softly and clumsily pressing Castiel’s hand against his face. The touch is cool on his eyes and lips, but mostly he wants that smell. Unlike any other sweaty, greasy alpha he’s smelled before, this alpha smells
Castiel rolls his eyes, but this actually seems to please Naomi. She brightens, as if she had been the one Dean was complimenting, and says, “Would you like another opportunity to dance?”
!” And Sam sounds so scandalized that Castiel can’t help laughing, earning himself a kick from the backseat. “Don’t you start!”
“D’you wanna drink?” Dean yells over his shoulder. He’s sweating, a little short of breath, because there are too many people here and most of them are already drunk, and he doesn’t want to leave Lisa alone and unprotected but at the same time, he’s not going to make it through this without a drink or five. This is his third party since his fight with Cas. He’s gotten into the routine now.
Castiel shoves his hands in his pockets as he steps through the front door and goes to stand at the curb. One of the valets asks him which car is his, but Castiel waves him away, clarifying that he’s just waiting for someone.
“Fuck you, nobody’s hurting Cas.”
“Let’s go out into the hallway,” Dean suggests to Cas, and when Charlie starts to stand as well, he shoos her back to her seat and gently brushes Cas’s bicep to direct him out of the theater.
Meg smirks, pushing away from the wall to knock her shoulder against Dean’s ribs. “I’m not all kittens and butterflies, y’know. I like a little dark creativity every now and then.” She shrugs, pushing dark curls out of her face and holding them back as she takes the painting in from this new angle. “It’s a little amateur, sure, but the emotion still comes through. Loneliness, pain, despair…” Meg drags her hand out of her hair and over her face, then presses it to her chest, a little smile playing at her bright red lips as she continues, “It’s like an emo kid vomited his poor little heart all over this wall, and I love everything about it.”
But Naomi is still speaking. This must be something she’s been holding in for a while. “Apologies are overdue to Lucifer and Gabriel too, and I can only hope I’m not too late for Anna. But Castiel,” she turns to look at him, that soft, concerned look in her eyes, “I won’t lie to you. I’m not sure how I feel about Dean, and if you are going to pursue an…” She pauses, searching for the right phrase: “an alternative lifestyle, then I wish you would at least choose someone more fitting to your station.”
,” he says, leaning back in his chair. “We got in a few weeks ago, the Lafitte family. My father thought this would be a good way to separate me from my girl Andrea, so that I could meet more people of our station.” He rolls his eyes. “Better people, he said.”
“So,” Chuck says after a long silence, “tell me about Dean.”
“I want to declare my intentions for Dean,” Castiel says. His voice sounds louder than normal, echoing against the high-ceilings. “Is there a tradition for this in Winchester?”
There’s an enclosed garden at the castle. It’s in full bloom right now, pinks and purples and blues, and plenty of bees. Castiel would probably like it. Maybe he could even build them a swing or a gazebo, like he built the cottage.
Leaning forward over the steering wheel, John peers up at the overcast sky like he’s expecting the answer to present itself to him in the cloud.
While they’re speaking, Castiel heads silently for the desk, pulling open the top drawer and rifling through it to find a marker. When he locates one, he pops the cap and looks back at Parker and Dean, standing now beside the couch. He raises a finger to his mouth, then draws a wide, looping sigil on the wall.
His previous three landings had been obviously wrong within milliseconds, but when he’d seen the books he’d paused. Perhaps this was Sam’s heaven; perhaps it was Dean’s. They’d both spent enough time in libraries for it to be a possibility that they had good memories of one like this, and despite Dean’s claims to the contrary, Castiel knew for a fact that he often read for pleasure.
_______
“Bah-tlo-mee,” Castiel repeats carefully, and when the man nods Castiel gestures to himself. “Castiel.”
“My point is that you, objectively, have a beautiful singing voice. I’d like to hear it more often, if you’ll let me.”
But he can’t ask. Can’t make this about himself. He lost Cas and he’s going to be mourning him for the rest of his life, but Jack did too. Dean refuses to be like his own father here. Won’t try to bear this pain like it's his alone.
Dean almost upends the coffee table he leaps up so fast.
“I never thought we’d get here,” he breathes.
“Only a little,” Hannah says. “You understand, even before the war, there was prejudice. Pagans were not looked on kindly by any side. Matka showed me how to protect myself, how to unbind, some small blessings. But only a little. Nothing was written, you see. Just taught by talking. Too much fear.”
“You might not want me to leave, but a part of you—a big enough part that it overwhelmed every other feeling you were subconsciously projecting toward me—wished that we’d left this alone.” He shoots Dean a smile, hoping that it comes across more comforting than it feels. “I don’t know if it’s wise to ignore that, especially considering the strain that this is already putting on your relationship with Sam.”
“Lung cancer,” Dean clarifies. Castiel frowns even more, still holding the unlit cigarette between his lips.
Pushing to his feet, Dean turns to find Cas out of breath and wounded.
“You’re still incredibly talkative,” Castiel says, tilting his head to look at Dean with a frown. It certainly seemed as though Dean enjoyed himself, but— “Was the fellatio satisfactory?”
“Yeah.”
So he wonders now--did Jack choose him, as well? And if he did, did he make that choice because of what he learned first-hand, or did he just take on Cas’ viewpoint when he’d decided to make himself in his image? Did he consider Dean his father because Cas saw him as good, and worthy, and selfless, and full of love?
Castiel snorts, and shakes his head, leaning back to return his gaze to the sky.
“Yeah,” he says, then, taking in Castiel’s stance, he steps a little closer. “Are you cold? Should we call my mom for a ride?”
“When you need each other, this will be your way home.”
Sam doesn’t let him finish.
i mean obviously it’s bad but is it BAD bad?
Dean seems genuinely unsettled by the thought that so much time had passed. It’s almost sweet, Castiel thinks, to see the furrow in Dean’s brow at the thought of having left Castiel to think he might have just imagined him.
“Well, good. Keep an eye on each other for me, okay?” Mary laughs. “I’ll talk to you soon, Dean. Love you boys.”
When Dean answers, he sounds drunk. He also sounds like he’s smiling, and that thought makes Cas' own lips twitch up at the corners. Even if he can’t be there to see it, it pleases him to think that Dean is in good spirits.
“Want you like this forever,” Castiel breathes against his skin, and Dean’s chest feels tight. He touches Castiel’s wrist as he moves his hand.
“Your sweetheart,” Bartłomiej tells him, and Agata smiles as she explains that she has sewn good luck into his coat. If he is lonesome, she tells him, he needs only complete the circle to find his way back to his sweetheart.
Though it’s still daylight, he crawls under sheets that still smell of Castiel and goes to sleep.
“You asked.”
“Alright,” Castiel agrees, and risks a quick glance away from the road to look at him. His eyes are closed, his head tilted back against the headrest. “Do you want to choose another tape to listen to?”
“One? It’s not. And B? You’re not asking.” He sighs. “I’m probably gonna screw things up a dozen times before the week is out, but you’ve gotta believe me when I tell you I’m in this. I’m with you. Don’t let me fuck this up with my knee-jerk bullshit, okay?”
The expression on his face is so alight with love that Castiel isn’t sure that Dean even needs to open his soul any further to show him how he feels.
Cas laughs, dizzy with love.
“Have you eaten?” Castiel asks, then frowns. “Come to think of it, what time was it for you when you came here?”
If he's being honest with himself, spending a couple of hours pressed close to Cas' side in the dark is half the reason Dean loves horror movies so much in the first place. Sometimes, Cas leans fully into Dean’s space until their legs press together. Sometimes he grabs Dean’s wrist and squeezes. Sometimes, he tilts his forehead against Dean’s shoulder, and Dean can’t breathe for the love of it.
He’s already down to his last three protein bars, but though he knows he can stretch those out over another week if he really has to, it’s rapidly becoming clear that no amount of rationing is going to make the remaining few inches of holy water last more than another day or two.
Holding still under his attention isn’t easy.
“Good.”
Beneath them, the pew creaks with the combined weight of their bodies, and Castiel’s foot slides against the wooden kneeler, bumps into the rack that holds a red-covered bible and a few stubby pencils. They clatter across the floorboards.
John glances over at him sharply when he speaks, several hours into their directionless journey.
Dean has always struggled to define what they have—
“I think I fell asleep,” Dean admits.
Dean nods, and for a while they sit in silence. It’s enough, just being here. It’s been a couple of minutes when Castiel thinks he hears the sound of a nurse approaching, and he looks away from Dean’s hand in his to watch the door. The footsteps recede, and he exhales, slow.
“We just need help to track someone down,” Dean cuts her off.
Food is a comfort to Dean. He wants to share it. And maybe, just as Castiel has come to realize that he likes being witness to Dean’s satisfaction in any form it takes, Dean also likes seeing Castiel enjoy himself. His reaction to learning that Castiel likes driving certainly gives credence to the theory.
John parks in a gravel lot adjacent to a closed farming supply store so that he can rest for a couple of hours, and they sleep in the car—John in the front, Dean in the back.
no they’re fine
“It was love,” he says simply. “That’s what made him happiest. Letting himself feel love.”
His neck is tangled in the cord, his hands limp and dark with blood at his sides, and when Castiel gets close enough he can make out scratches on his neck where he must have been trying to break himself free. In the dirt below Daniel’s feet, his gloves lay beside his pocketknife, useless and bloody where he must have dropped it in his desperation to free himself.
Castiel gives no response; just heads over to the window, sliding it open before climbing out onto the fire escape. Dean follows. He sits beside him on the cold metal grate and watches as Castiel pulls a thin, dented tin from his pocket. He flips open the lid, tapping it against his knee until a cigarette slides free. Watching him, Dean can’t help but notice how nice his hands are. Graceful, almost, in the way his long fingers move.
Castiel squints at him.
to stay without me guilting you into it, or—“
“I’ve wondered about it,” Castiel tells him, ignoring his comment. “Whether it would be as enjoyable to give as to receive. If you’d be amenable to try it sometime, I’d—”
wtf why are you at the zoo?
, pack a bag?” Dean asks.
“Looking for something to eat,” he lies through pain-clenched teeth, and gasps when John’s grip tightens. “Dad, you’re hurting me.”
He swallows against the nausea that follows the movement. Swallows again when it doesn’t pass. Realizes, too late, that he hasn’t taken a breath in several long seconds, and sucks one in with all the desperation of someone who’s just burst out of the ocean.
“Hey Cas, I’m making a fresh pot. You want a refill?”
he’s trying to tell him, then maybe, against all odds, Castiel’s got a chance.
“Is that how you—“
It’s still tempting to deflect. Habit formed is difficult to shake loose, no matter how damaging, how foolish. Castiel pushes past the urge.
As he pushes open the creaking door of the room he’s rented for the night, Cas comes to realize that there are three things wrong with the name of the Great Blue Budget Palace. First, the building is squat and dilapidated. It sits close to the roadside opposite a football field and is flanked on three sides by a gas station, a greasy spoon, and a barely running river. The exterior is painted an obtrusive shade of puce.
Part of Dean envies them for that. Another part pities them.
But even after they drop Jo off outside the house, and she heads inside to help Ellen and Bobby start to clear out the spare room, Castiel finds still can’t get the words out. He needs to—he knows—but they’re sticking in his throat.
“Yes, I’m sure that’s exactly the phrasing your teachers used,” Castiel says, unable to suppress his smirk at the way Dean snorts in response. “Do you really think you’re not smart enough?”
John had told him, carrying on a conversation that Dean hadn’t truly been a part of.
He holds Dean’s gaze as he adds; “By you. If that wasn’t clear.”
“I wasn’t,” he says, bristling a little at Dean’s description. Not that he isn’t right about it—Castiel
In the decade he has spent tethered to this body he has never felt more connected to it. Even while he was human, he’d felt slightly out of place, off center and wrong. With Dean’s hand in his own, he feels something within himself click into place, and knows, without doubt or reservation, that
He’s still watching when he hears a twig snap behind him, and with nothing but his pocket knife to protect himself he jerks upright, ready to confront whoever is there.
This particular instance, however, is tempered by the specifics of the topic.
By the map table, Sam pauses, resting his fingertips atop an empty section of the Pacific. Jack keeps walking, heading down the hallway towards his room, and Sam’s eyes follow him for a moment before he pulls out a chair and sits.
Ellen lets out a low breath, and Castiel understands her relief deeply. If Dean had hurt someone in his moment of confusion, the guilt of it would eat at him. It’s the last thing he needs.
His hips stutter and lock, and for brief a moment Dean thinks he’s about to come, but then he lets go. Shifts his hands to push lightly at Dean’s chest, making him back up on wobbly legs.
Castiel snaps a photo anyway before he answers.
“I got it.”
Maybe that’s the point, he realizes, and feels like an idiot for not figuring it out sooner. Cas is making Dean’s desires his own so that Dean will have to address them. He’s so turned on that the aggravation of realizing he’s been thoroughly outmanoeuvred only makes his blood run even hotter. He doesn’t stand a chance.
“That’s what I like to hear.”
“You did, but Dean…” Castiel weighs his words carefully. “Do you know how prayer works?”
Though he knows that the man who did this to Dean was damaged in ways Castiel couldn’t possibly fathom, that he was suffering, confused, terrified—it’s difficult to reconcile that understanding with the sight of his best friend so broken before him.
The nephilim isn’t exactly on the loose. It hasn’t been born yet.
, if you don’t mind,” she’d said, “I don’t care to be skyclad in front of just anyone.”) along with a handful of ingredients that won’t arrive until morning, so with the townspeople preoccupied there’s really nothing left to do but wait and hope that Belphegor’s failing barrier will hold long enough for them to make it permanent.
“Do you need help to find something?” he’d asked, evidently under the impression that this was his workplace, and Castiel shook his head, trying to dispel his disappointment.
The house is warm inside, and the shock of it makes his hands tingle.
“Just…” In the dark, Dean’s eyes flicker over Cas' face, searching for something before he pushes out a heavy breath. “Fuck. I don’t wanna wait.”
Regardless of whether or not Dean can ever stop hating Jack for what he did… Cas might never forgive him for that. He wishes he could take it all back.
Before the war, he’d been training to be a commercial pilot. Now, the thought of flying another plane is enough to make his hands start shaking. Perhaps a chef, he thinks. Cooking is certainly something he enjoys, and he knows that others enjoy his food--Dean had been particularly impressed with the way he’d prepared the potatoes they’d eaten when he was last here. In fact, Dean had--
Sam huffs without humor, lifting his brow.
Dean feels bile rising, and it makes his throat burn. His mouth floods with saliva. He wills himself not to vomit, and cracks open a window to let some fresh air into the stuffy car, but all that drifts inside is the smell of stale exhaust fumes, and it makes his head ache. He’s hungry and exhausted and he wants to be sick and he wants to scream and cry and he wants to strangle his father and he wants to run and run and run and he wants, more than anything, to go home.
“Mom’s just checking in,” he says, typing out a reply before he locks the phone. “You sure you don’t mind driving overnight?”
“Kinda surprised you even wanted to see this,” Benny says, glancing back in Castiel’s direction as they near the side door to the theater. “Dean said you hated Halloween 5.”
Dean kisses him as they move together. It’s unhurried at first, deep and luxurious as each roll of their hips, but every moment that passes makes the need for release grow more urgent, and any desire to take their time is replaced by an insistent need for more, faster,
, he’d said the last time they’d spoken, earlier in the week.
Because yeah, maybe Cas was originally engineered by Chuck as nothing but a plot device, but maybe… maybe he wasn’t. Maybe it’s just like Cas said all those years ago, when Chuck had told him
Even worse, Dean seems to laugh more when they’re hanging out with Benny, and since Dean’s father was diagnosed with some barely pronounceable form of brain cancer—
“What do you see?” Castiel asks quietly, keeping his voice low so as not to scare off any fish, and Dean glances over before coming back to sit beside him. He’s near enough that Castiel can feel the warmth of his arm, pressed close, and it’s difficult not to react.
. Never even wanted to,” Dean laughs, bitter and sharp. “Maybe I should’ve taken the hint in Purgatory.”
to save,” Sam cuts in, the facade of calm he’s been attempting to maintain finally breaking. “Everybody’s gone.”
“But I can’t focus,” he admits. “You know I’ve been looking forward to this, it’s just...”
The way Dean smiles at that has Castiel feeling a little weak at the knees, and he’s glad that he’s already sitting.
It doesn’t take long for him to wonder if he’s really been spared at all, because as it turns out,
Dean rubs his hands on his jeans and pushes away from the wall when Cas climbs out of his truck. He smiles. It’s a nervous looking smile.
And… there had been something humming under his skin, in the graveyard. Something pushing, making his muscles twitch toward the weapon he’d dropped. A pulse, an electric buzz that made him feel as though it would have been easier to just
“Walleye, I think,” Dean murmurs back. “Maybe Saugeye? It’s still a little dark to tell, but they’re pretty big.”
Dean takes the one that Cas always preferred, and tries to keep himself from asking Jack to complete his thought, to tell him what else it was that he chose. But he
There’s a new synchronicity to them as they rise together, dusting themselves off in the pink light of dawn before starting back toward the bunker’s door without a word between them. Dean walks slightly ahead. Castiel watches him move with an interest more open than he’s ever allowed himself before. He’s beautiful—that much isn’t a revelation—but there’s something easier about him now. Less tense. His shoulders are lower, his muscles loose and sinuous, comfortable in a way that Castiel has never seen.
From: Sam 11:14pm Are you still up?
Cas said that knowing Dean changed him. Well, knowing Cas changed Dean, too. He thinks for the better. He wants it to be for the better.
Dean doesn’t ask any more questions--he just grabs hold of Castiel’s arm and drags him inside past his laughing mother.
“You sound incredibly certain for someone who supposedly isn’t even convinced that we’ll make it out of this world alive.”
“I’ve got more on here if you didn’t like the other one,” he says eventually, and Castiel tilts his head as he considers it. Eventually, he gives a tiny nod.
“Oh.”
He sees Ellen tighten her grip on Bobby’s hand.
“The roots extend down into the earth, but they do not draw up water. Power coils down, down, down through the rock and dust, and when the roots end the power continues. Spreads out and out forever. This tree brings life to every living plant, every living tree on Earth.”
“It’s still not healing, but it’s not any worse. I suppose that’s a small comfort.”
Castiel doesn’t know how there can be any doubt, but somehow Dean still looks worried.
“Yeah,” Dean says, and his voice is thick and rough until he clears his throat. “I guess.”
—and turns it in his hands.
Sam just shrugs.
Dean shifts even closer then, and the denim of his jeans is rough and cold where it brushes against Castiel’s thigh. It’s just distracting enough that the feeling of his hand settling fully over Castiel’s rapidly filling erection comes as a complete surprise, and Castiel draws in a sharp breath, one hand lifting to grip one of the rungs of the bedhead behind him.
A huge tree, weighed down with Spanish moss, stands in the centre of the horse-shoe shaped building. John uses it as a shield to hide the car from the road. He makes Dean wait while he goes inside. When he comes back, almost twenty minutes later, his hands are smeared with something dark.
“I suppose Heaven isn’t all it used to be.”
“Why don’t you find us something to listen to?” he says, gesturing with his chin toward the shoebox in the passenger side footwell. From anyone else, it might seem like a brush-off, an avoidance of their previous conversation. From Dean, it’s just further confirmation that he meant it when he said
It doesn’t matter that his own family is a formless mess of people without any real connection, or that he spent more of his formative years in the Winchester house than in his own. It doesn’t matter that for the past five years he’s been just as much a part of the Singer-Harvelle clan as Sam had become after this drawn out nightmare began.
It’s only been half an hour since Dean left, and already Castiel is counting the minutes to their next meeting. It’s a foolish thing to do, considering that they clearly established
“Dean, I need you to breathe, okay?”
?” he asks, and he sounds incredulous. As though it’s the fact that Castiel would be interested in him specifically that’s surprising. “Douchey king of the v-neck? That Balthazar?”
“He is. I’ve actually been thinking about telling him.”
To his credit, Sam does seem sincerely apologetic. Castiel just can’t quite fathom how someone could spend their entire life living in close quarters with someone and be unaware of such a fundamental truth about them. He does know that Dean tries to hide his interest in men--he’s not completely oblivious, no matter what some might say—but he’s always assumed that Sam saw through the charade as easily as he did. It’s disconcerting to learn that he was so wrong.
“They’re like prayers,” Castiel says. “They’re more to do with faith than physical reward.”
“It’s roo—“ he yawns explosively halfway through the word, bringing up one hand to press over his mouth before he tries again. “Roomy.”
“Honestly, I’m just impressed that Sam didn’t tell you.”
Castiel wants to. He’s just trying to figure out how.
“You knew, though. Didn’t you? That’s why you wanted to drive me back tonight.”
Dean shoots off a message—brief and impersonal, if the speed with which he types and sends it is any indication—and starts the engine.
“My grace is still regenerating, but the wound has healed. Thank you for asking.”
“Uh, yeah it is. Unless you’re counting the whole peacocking thing you did with your wings that time.”
“No,” Castiel says. “I haven’t set foot in any forest at all since I was in Poland.”
But maybe they won’t. For once, he has hope.
“I do.”
“Takes one to know one.”
Castiel lets out a low huff of a laugh as he recalls the joke he’d read aloud from a copy of
Before he can make the suggestion himself, Dean nods toward it.
His hair is damp at the edges, as though he’s just washed his face. His eyes seem dull; his expression drawn.
“Not that smart?” Castiel repeats, and Dean groans, covering his face with his hand. “I’m sorry, which one of us skipped a whole school year?”
“You really think my dad took us on field trips? The man barely tolerated us watching cartoons.”
She doesn’t say anything else, just shuffles slowly forward to the car and climbs into the passenger seat. Castiel watches the car pull away, and watches six other cars come and go, and finally lets his guilt win out against his fear.
While Dean waits, Castiel walks the rest of the way across the river to dump the bag on the bank before slowly moving back, stepping carefully on the slippery rocks under the surface.
Castiel lets out a quiet laugh. Dean grins over at him.
Castiel squints at him, tilting his head to one side, and Dean’s knees go a little weak.
, and Castiel sinks down onto his haunches with a pitiful laugh. Dating someone else seems ludicrous right now, and really, what is he thinking of? A rebound for a relationship that never was? He knows that could never string someone along like that without the guilt of it eating him alive, and anyway, it’s entirely possible that he’s never going to get over Dean at all.
“People don’t wear suits to the zoo, Cas. They sure as hell don’t wear creeper coats.”
“Not much yet, but she said to call her in half an hour.”
During the apocalypse that never came, Castiel met a man whose heaven was a vast library.
“Good?” he asks.
Miraculously, Dean understands exactly what he can’t seem to say, and he slides Castiel’s underwear down and away. His breath is hot against Castiel’s skin. His tongue soft when it flicks at the head of Castiel’s cock.
“Okay, fair.”
“So after eating fruit from any tree—” Castiel begins, a wrinkle forming in his brow as he makes the connection, and she nods.
do, given the proper motivation,” she says, then falters, mouth tense as she glances back past the barrier to where the ghosts are amassing like a vast, spectral army. “That said, patching up a hole in Hell isn’t the kind of thing I’ll be able to just throw together.”
Watching him work, Castiel wishes he knew some way to show Dean this—the way Castiel sees him, as someone profoundly capable and resourceful—without embarrassing himself in the process.
But they’re not real. He’s safe. The sigils are meaningless. The warding is useless. Anyone could cross the line. He’s a sitting duck.
“Sam, it took everything I had to draw those ghosts into the crystal.”
“No. Cas checked it over a few minutes ago. It’s the same as before.” Sam pauses, chewing on the inside of his lip for a moment before he seems to make up his mind about something. “He couldn’t heal it.”
Henriksen says their names by way of greeting, and he and Ballard shake each of their hands before gesturing toward the meeting room on the left and following them inside. Castiel feels a strange combination of relief and dread when they don’t question his presence.
“I know the feeling,” Castiel agrees.
When they end the call a few minutes later, Dean folds the jacket in half and drapes it over the empty side of his bed before heading for the shower.
“Let’s just get ready to go. If he gets back before we leave, fine. If not…” Dean shrugs.
Camping cots and folding chairs fill the open space, and a handful of people are preparing a mountain of sandwiches and what smells like  instant mac and cheese in the kitchen. Trying to look more like the seasoned professional he’s undercover as, and less as though he’s moments away from completely losing his mind, Dean glances around until he finds his brother, talking on his phone over by the window. Sam looks up as though he can sense his gaze, and Dean heads over to meet him, leaving Belphegor to his own devices by a tall stack of sandwiches.
Before Sam can get any ideas about driving to Illinois, Dean clings to the first lie he can come up with.
“He told you,” Jack breathes, and Dean’s heart stutters a moment before he realizes that he’s only talking about the deal. Of course he knew—he must have been there when Cas made it.
Her lips quirk at the edge, though there’s little humor in her voice when she speaks.
“Leave it!” he shouts when Dean steps out from behind the tree and moves toward the house to grab his backpack. “They’re coming!”
“Good,” he agrees.
“I gathered,” he says instead of paying attention to the impulse, and picks up the cooler, walking backwards for a few paces so that he can look at Dean a little longer. “Come on. Let’s get lunch over with so we can get in the water while it’s still hot.”
Something about the mental image feels like home.
•	A thief who got caught (but is exceptionally good at hiding?)
Frowning, Sam pushes the door further open.
Dean moves, heading toward the Elantra, and John follows closely behind. The car is already running, and the doors are open wide. Most of the owner’s possessions have been turned out of the glove compartment and the seat pockets and strewn on the ground. The interior reeks of cigarette smoke and Juicy Fruit chewing gum. Dean’s stomach lurches all over again.
“The first time was years ago. The raising of Samhain,” he explains, surprising even himself with the revelation. “I told you then that I had been praying for you to save the town… but I didn’t realize at the time that it wasn’t God that I was praying to.”
The music is louder here, and Dean edges forward to peer into what should be his own open plan living room and kitchen, and though the layout is the same the furniture and wallpaper are not, and more importantly, there’s a man there. He’s turned away from Dean, and he’s dressed in tan pants, belted at the waist. His feet are bare, and the sleeves of his white t-shirt are rolled up a little, the outline of a zippo lighter visible under the edge of the sleeve on the right.
“I should have asked you first.” Dean’s gaze darts around the restaurant, stubbornly refusing to meet Castiel’s eyes. “I’m sorry. This doesn’t have to be a date or anything, if you don't want it to. I just wanted to get to talk to you before everyone else started fighting for your attention."
"That's what you think," Dean shoots back. Between his confidence and Castiel's immediate blush, Bela's gasp is almost overkill.
“A little bit?” Benny scoffs. “
“Alright, cards on the table here,” he says, and takes an unsteady breath. “I’m pretty sure I started falling for you as soon as I read the story about you in Sugarman’s autobiography. I was up all night, just waiting for another sentence about you. Now that I’m saying that out loud, it sounds kinda messed up, but… man. I think I started loving you then. I don’t even know what to call how I feel about you now. I just know I want you with me. I want to see you frowning at me before you’ve had coffee. I want to find you on the fire escape pretending not to smoke. I want to hear you laughing at me for being a jackass.”

“Smartass.”
,” he grinds out through gritted teeth, his fingers clenched tightly enough around the marker to make the cuts on his hand and his arm throb. If he has to think about anything other than what’s right in front of him, he can think about the past. The past is
Castiel is too lust-drunk to notice.
“Let me do this for you,” he says, and Dean just nods.
Castiel nods, gripping Dean’s shoulder.
“I don’t understand how you expect me to ‘blend’ when I can barely bend my knees.”
“Uh, verily,” Dean says, not entirely sure that he’s using the right word. He’s too tired for this. Garth just blinks at him. “Wouldst thou, um...” He sighs and leans a little closer, dropping his voice and his character. “Can I take over the stock guard gig for a bit?”
Castiel doesn’t believe that he’s encountered a worse liar in all the years he’s been interacting with humans. With a glance at Dean, whose expression is just as dubious as his own must be, Castiel leans forward to capture Parker’s unsteady gaze.
The rest of the fish, they gut and fillet on top of a flat chunk of limestone by the water’s edge before putting them on ice in the small fishing cooler on loan from John.
His voice comes out harsh and accusatory. Castiel can’t help but flinch a little to hear it.
“Mary said she kicked the ghost’s butt,” Jack tells him, proudly.
“Where’s Sam?” Cas asks, hesitating by the passenger door as Dean slides behind the wheel, and Dean answers automatically, feeling as though he’s only got two choices moving forward: blunt and aloof, or openly hostile.
, and he has to tell them. He has to tell Jack.
He trails off, throat going dry, because the man looking up at him is the spitting image of Castiel Novak. He blinks.
“I appreciate the advice, and your concern,” Castiel tells him.
“Cas?”
Dean sneers the name like it’s a curse. It’s unfair—Castiel is certain that under different circumstances, Dean would have liked him just fine—but he understands it. The way jealousy and hurt can twist together and turn everything to poison. He still can’t quite fathom that Dean feels it, though.
Dean’s voice floats down toward him, singing
is healthy. They didn’t exactly make it a secret that they see her as a walking incubator. She’s probably safe for now though, right? At least until she delivers?”
“Fuck, fuck,
Crossing the room, he picks up the coat and shakes it out before slipping it back over his shoulders, then unlocks his cell. He types out a hasty message as he walks down the hall.
Castiel’s eyes sweep over the omega prince in his arms. High-spirited and stubborn and generous, maybe a little spoiled but certainly not unkind. For a moment, he allows himself to think back to Cielo, to picture what Dean would have been if he had grown up there.
Dean reaches for his phone.
But a voice tugs at Dean’s brain, whispering softly,
“The first time I left Sileas after meeting you, I was afraid you would forget me. That we’d fall out of touch.” He can’t look at Dean as he says this, staring intently at the painting in his lap instead. “I treasure every drawing you send me, and that one year where you didn’t send any because I was angry at you, that was…” He takes a shaky breath, “Every month that went by without some new sketch of Batman in my mailbox, hurt a little more than the last.”
Lisa stops walking. She clings to Dean’s hand, tugging him back when he pretends he doesn’t notice, and he tries to smile cheerfully at her, but she just looks so stricken that his smile falls.
Castiel is so preoccupied, he doesn’t even notice where they’re going until they’re well past the tree line. “Um,” he starts, but Bela shushes him. She’s carrying her strappy black heels in one hand, moving forward in a pair of flats, and Castiel doesn’t even remember her stopping to change her shoes. Up ahead, he can hear laughter, shouts, and glass breaking. “Um,” he tries again, but Bela just turns and glares at him until he bites his lower lip and watches the ground instead.
“Yeah, there’s a public restroom right up there.” She points up ahead, then turns to Castiel. “We’re just beyond there if you want to change and meet up with us.” She lowers her eyelashes and leans in close to him, until his cheeks turn pink. “Though I’m sure no one would object if you wanted to change at the party.”
But that’s what they’re going to talk about. They
“Yeah,” he says, averting his eyes. Her grip tightens. “It was a guy, though. If that helps.”
, and I’m done caring what other people think about my relationship with Dean.” Now he rolls his shoulders, sighing as his muscles relax. “The past is the past, and I think I’m finally ready to start moving forward.”
When they arrive at the theater, Dean’s stuck parking near the back, but no one seems to mind. He’s a little surprised by the line of kids around the venue (most of them, like Jo, with brightly colored hair and heavy eyeliner). He never expected a band of teenage crooners singing about broken hearts to get this much attention.
“Jack, he came into the empty and got me. But my grace is gone now. He didn’t want me to end up there ever again.”
“Doc,” Dean interrupted with a small smirk, “you’re about to be up close and personal with my ass, you can call me Dean.”
“I said I’m sorry Dean! I didn’t mean to run into you!” Sam protested, looking at Dean with his puppy dog eyes.
“Sounds good, doc,” Dean said grimacing in pain. The sooner he got the glass out the better. Damn did his butt hurt.
Dean thinks he might be gay. It’s been a week since he kissed Cas and since then they’ve gotten a little more touchier than normal for them. Dean doesn’t mind it though, he quite enjoys cuddling with Cas while watching a movie or doing homework. But he doesn’t know if that makes him gay. He tries looking at other men but it’s boring and he doesn’t get interested in them. Women either. Dean decides he just must like Cas, and proudly declares to Cas one night that he’s Cassexual which sends Cas into a fit of laughter. Dean finds he quite likes when he makes Cas laugh like that.
“Alright, Jess, if you could numb Mr—Dean up, I will be right back,” Dr. Novak said with a smile before leaving the room.
Dean sinks to his knees against the wall, starting to sob again. This isn’t fair. Dean should have said something—should have done something—but deep down he always thought they would have more time together. That all of this would finally be over and Dean could retire with Cas somewhere warm. He thought they would have more time.
Dean nodded. “Hey it’s cool, not all my curveballs work out,” he said with a laugh. “Alright, this last cake is peanut butter cake with a three berry filling and again with the Italian meringue buttercream.” He set down the cake and watched both of them take a bite.
Suddenly Cas was striding towards him, pulling him out of his seat and having him get down on his hands and knees. Dean wasn’t sure what was going to happen when the guy playing Rocky sat on his back for part of the song.
don’t need him,” Dean says, crossing his arms. Sam stares, a smile on his face. “What?” Dean asks defensibly.
“We could do that. It’s not odd?” she asked.
“Dean? You’re back already?” Sam asked, coming over to him. “I figured you two would be making up for awhile.”
Dean pulled into the parking lot of his bakery and turned off his car. He should have known that Cas wouldn’t forgive him. He was an idiot.  As much as Dean wanted to just go upstairs and drink, he knew he couldn’t.
“You’re fucking right what you did was wrong! God. You’re lucky that finding another baker this close to the wedding is basically impossible.” She said with a glare. “I would have tried, but Cas insisted I not do that to you. God only knows why.”
“I think what you mean is that you assumed he was my fiancé, and because you two are apparently both useless and never actually talked about anything,
Dean nodded, “right of course. Well if you guys wanna take a seat over here, we can get started with the cake tasting. Anna, I believe you said you were looking for something simple but with a fruit flavored filling?”
“But...Chuck got Lucifer out,” Dean points out. He wants to cry again, the thought of never seeing Cas finally sinking in. If not even Jack could get him out...what chance does Dean have? “So...he’s just...gone forever,” Dean mutters.
Dean sighed and pushed his face further into the pillow. He couldn’t believe this was happening.
“Okay, pick a virgin and stand behind them! You’re going to be popping their cherries!” the lady said with a big grin. Oh fuck. Cas came and stood right behind Dean, grinning. “Alright, virgins! Place the balloon in between you and your partner!”
What if Cas was single and had just happened to come into Dean’s bakery. They could go for coffee and laugh about how they met, and get to know each other.  Maybe Dean would be brave and kiss Cas at the end of the date. They would go on more dates, and learn about each other’s likes and dislikes. Maybe they would break up down the road, but what if they didn’t? What if they fell in love and got married and adopted cute little kids that would grow up and become doctors just like Cas.
Hours later, long after the whiskey is gone, Dean gets up and heads into his room. He frowns when he sees a lump in his bed. Why is Sam sleeping in his bed?
He heard a small cough and looked up to see his newest employee Hannah. “Um... there is a lady here for you, Dean? She said she owes you money. I mean, the bakery money.”
“Okay, Dean. Have a nice night, I’ll text you later.” Cas said, leaning forward and hugging Dean.
Dean smiles back, leaning forward and kissing him again. “Forever then.”
He’s eleven when Castiel comes over for the first time. Dean’s thrilled to see Cas open up more now that he’s not surrounded by other people. Cas tells Dean he’s really shy and that going on stage actually terrifies him but that he does it for his parents. Dean thinks that’s bullshit but he doesn’t tell Cas that since it’s a bad word and he doesn’t want to get in trouble.
Dean felt Cas move in closer so the balloon stayed in place. “Don’t worry, I’ll be gentle.” He heard Cas whisper in his ear. Dean let out a strained laugh. Fuck.
“We need you to come, everyone...they’re all gone Dean. The sigils didn’t work. All the people...they’re all gone,” Sam says and Dean can hear his brother sniffling, clearly upset.
“It’s okay. You’re here now and you’re not gonna go anywhere.”
Dean got out of the car and ran up to the front door, knocking loudly. After a moment passed with no answer, Dean knocked again. “Cas! I know you’re home!” Dean called out. “I need to talk to you!” He added when still no one answered the door.
Dean is nine when another boy joins the class. He’s weird and awkward and always carries around a tan blanket. Dean thinks he should befriend the weird kid but he doesn’t really talk enough for Dean to actually become his friend. Despite the other kid’s weirdness and attachment to his blanket he’s a fairly good ballet dancer, nearly as good as Dean.
. Dean had obviously been mistaken when he thought the doctor had been flirting with him back at the hospital.It’s not the first time, won’t be the last time, Dean can move past this, he’s used to it. Dean didn’t even know anything about the guy. Maybe the guy hated pie.
“Cas!” Dean shouts, shaking the angel’s shoulder. He has no idea why or how Cas is in his bed but he’s definitely not complaining.
can barely dance on his toes like he’s supposed to. Castiel tells him not to get upset because it can take trained ballerinas years to master the art of pointe. Dean smiles, leans over and kisses Cas without thinking about what it means. Cas blushes and smiles back.
On the screen Janet and Brad were standing in front of the elevator when Frank N. Furter was coming down. Dean noticed everyone looking to the aisle and that’s when Dean saw him. Oh fuck, Cas was playing him? Shit. Dean wasn’t going to survive tonight.
Soon they were ushering them on stage. It was fairly simple, he just had to walk with the other person arm in arm. He watched as she threw the bouquet, and then they got to go sit in their seats.
“Anna, hi,” Dean said, sitting down from across from her.
“12:30, I’ll see you here tomorrow,” he said, standing up just as Anna came back from the bathroom. “Ready to go?”
“Alright, I’m going to go get the required equipment and supplies and I’ll be back to take care of your ass,” Dr. Novak said, standing. He stopped, and Dean saw a blush spread across his cheeks. “Uh... I mean the glass. Not... yes, okay,” he muttered, brushing the curtain away to leave.
“Okay,” Cas says, just as soft. “I can come over.”
“Anna picked my outfit, so blame her,” he whispers back, loosening his tie and starting to pull it over his head. Naomi stays quiet, thoughtful, as Castiel starts to unbutton his dress shirt.
“I’m not sure I could handle more than a mouthful,” Castiel admits. His honesty surprises Dean, and he’s almost ready to offer to guide Castiel through it, when Castiel’s grin stretches and turns mischievous. “But I can give you something else.”
The sound is muffled, but Dean laughs anyway, singing, “
“Dean!”
They head out into the sunlight, and Dean buries his face in Castiel’s neck, not-so-subtly scenting him. “Cas,” Dean says, “I don’t know if you’ve noticed, but we’re both pretty naked.”
Dean’s eyelids flutter, his lips parting in surprise, before he lets out a joyful noise and claps Castiel on the back. “Holy shit, Cas! Good for you!”
Jo nods and turns her attention to Anna, while Castiel greets Charlie far more warmly, petting her head as she tucks her face into his neck.
So Castiel smiles. “Do you think the others are still waiting for us?”
“Thanks, Cas.”
When the first opening band comes on, they’re the exact opposite of what Dean expected. A pretty blonde girl plays piano and shares singing duties with the ginger man on guitar, and it’s closer to folk rock than emo. Dean catches himself bobbing his head, and when he notices Anna singing along, he asks her about the band.
-----
When Dean calls and invites Castiel to see a movie with him, he almost says no. It’s been a few days, but he’s still feeling bruised and tender from his conversation with Aaron, and his instinct is to push Dean away again.
So why the hell is he having these dreams about Cas?
Castiel squints at Dean, watching as his face turns pink and makes the freckles on his neck more apparent. Part of Castiel believes that this sort of thing is all that Dean knows - his only experience with a relationship is Lisa, who probably would have been sufficiently wooed by classic romance like sunsets over the ocean. And once they arrive, who knows? Maybe Castiel will be wooed as well.
Silence falls. It’s awkward, palpable with all the unspoken words between them, and neither one willing to re-open the wound. So they stare at each other, at the floor and the walls, until Dean finally has enough and clears his throat and says, “So, Batman?”
“You’re asking after an omega refugee, after living out in the woods by yourself for years.” She smiles brightly, the candlelight reflecting laughter in her pretty eyes. “It’s easy to assume.”
Charlie cringes. Jo clears her throat and looks away.
So Dean clenches his hand into a fist and drops it to his side, gritting his teeth. From the corner of his eye, he can see Jo shuffling awkwardly; she’s aware of the tension, at least.
movie to begin. As he surveys the theater, still filling up as the line slowly makes its way inside, Dean is grateful that his friends decided to get in line early. Their group is a little too large, and if they hadn’t been among the first ones inside, they might have had find separate seats.
“Probably,” Castiel whispers back, kissing the freckle-covered junction of neck and shoulder before tucking Dean tighter against his chest. “But we’re just going to lay like this for a while. Okay?”
“Promised Lisa I wouldn’t,” Dean responds, almost whining. “Only way I got her here was promising I wouldn’t drink anything and look at me now.” Spread out on the floor of an unfamiliar house, surrounded by unfamiliar faces. His knuckles are bruised and his nose is still bleeding, and maybe his lips are bleeding too - he can taste copper when he runs his tongue over his teeth, and when he sniffs, a ringing pain shoots up into his head. Why does he do this shit? Why has he let this deal with Alastair escalate to this point, to the point that he can’t even take his girlfriend out without getting drunk and beating someone up and hating himself for it? “Cas, I’m a fucking mess, why do you even bother with me?”
Bela rolls her eyes and shoves him playfully, though he barely shifts under her touch. Sometimes it’s funny to think about the year they met, how skinny Castiel had been, and still small enough that he could meet Bela’s eyes when she wore low-heels. She’s filled out a little more and has decided to try having bangs, but otherwise looks mostly the same. Maybe that’s why it feels so weird to look down at her, to feel like he has to be careful not to crush her when they exchange a warm hug.
“I love you,” Castiel says, trailing kisses down Dean’s forehead to his nose, pleased when Dean shifts up the bed to kiss him properly. “I love you so much.”
“Joanna Beth Harvelle, does your mother know what you did to your hair?”
you,” Castiel counters, rubbing his hands over his face. “I feel like we’re speaking different languages, and I don’t know how to make you understand.”
After a moment, Castiel continues, “Still, dragons can be condescending, and they do like to claim things that aren’t necessarily their own. I’d prefer your company any day, Dean.”
This is definitely a step up from Cielo.
“I know,” Dean chuckles, “they’re not quite on her level. But I’m pretty happy with them. This one,” he flips the green portrait around for Castiel to see again, “is how I think people see me. The other one is what I feel like inside.”
Castiel takes a shaky breath of cold air, and allows himself to dream.
“This place is more for kids than for us,” Castiel replies, tossing another fish at a pretty seal resting against the wall. “Might as well help make it memorable for them.”
Pam’s smile stretches when Dean nods for her to go on, and a grumbling Victor gets up to try and derail Charlie and Bela’s continuing argument, which now seems to have evolved to include pros and cons of the different wizarding schools.
That's a surprise. Dean blinks at him, frowning. "Lisa does."
“Hello?”
“I’m really not a fan of Ed Norton,” Castiel offers, but is quickly humbled by a triforce of angry glares. He holds up his hands in surrender and sighs. “Alright, alright, alright. I get it. Dean is all sad eyes and freckles like a beagle puppy, so you feel bad for him.”
“This is so good,” Cas muttered, taking another bite with a moan. “You are very good at your job, Dean.”
Dean blushed at the delighted (and distractingly erotic) sound that came from Cas.
“Dean, I...I’m sorry. I need to make this up to you, please tell me....” Dean marches up to him, deciding it’s now or never, and cuts him off with a kiss. Cas is shocked and unresponsive for a few seconds before letting out a small moan and wrapping his arms tightly around Dean. Slowly, Dean pulls his mouth away from Cas’, resting his forehead against the angel’s as he attempts to catch his breath. “
“It’s not like I didn’t try, Sam. He doesn’t want me in his life.” Dean said, waiting for the toaster to pop up with his food.
“That’s pretty dark, what if we did azure instead?” he suggested.
: I love you.
It’s their sophomore year when Dean and Cas get in the biggest fight in their relationship. Cas goes to stay with a mutual friend for an entire week. In the end Dean stops being stubborn and apologizes to Cas for staying out all night and making Cas think he was dead. Dean goes out the next day after Cas moves back in and buys an engagement ring.
“Here we go!” Dean said with forced enthusiasm. “So this first one that you will be trying is a lemon cake with a strawberry filling and Italian meringue buttercream,” he explained, placing the cake slice in front of Anna and Cas with two forks.
Anna let out a snort. “Jesus, fuck no. My fiancée is a woman.”
: You gave him my address.
“I mean he didn’t want to see me. He doesn’t want to talk to me, Sam. I screwed up, I lost him forever. It’s time to just move on.” Dean said as he washed his hands. He had orders to get to.
. Pulled into the Empty forever, never to return again. He can’t get the image of Cas’ face out of his head. How happy he was. Just to tell Dean that he...
Dean followed the lady named Bela and the other winner into the back. “Alright, for winning that contest you get to be in the show! So you’ll be Ralph.” She said pointing at Dean. “And you’ll be Betty.” She said pointing at the lady beside Dean. “They are the couple who gets married in the beginning.”
Carefully and slowly, Dean carves in Castiel and Jack, occasionally taking sips of the whiskey. Once that’s done, Dean stands and whiskey bottle in-hand, heads back into the dungeon.
Anna took a bite of the cake, letting out a pleased sound. “This is so good, Dean!” Cas nodded as well with a small smile.
Dean finished cleaning up and locked up the bakery before climbing into his Impala. Tomorrow wasn’t a date, it wasn’t.
It had been a week since everything had gone down with Cas. Logically Dean knew he could slow down on baking, but every time he tried, thoughts of Cas came to mind, and it was just too much for Dean to handle.
Castiel is quiet and weird, but Dean finds himself drawn to the odd boy. At home Dean goes on and on about Cas, about his every trait and how weird he is but how much Dean actually really likes the weird things about Cas.
He drove to the theater, and went inside to pick up his ticket. A lady walked up to him once he had it in hand..
“Sounds great. Okay I think I have what I need from you I can get this sketched out and have it sent over for your approval and we can work out the cost, sound good?”
Dean is thirty-five when he becomes a dance instructor. He had loved the broadway life, but with his two babies, he had soon tired from being away from them all the time. Castiel writes a bestseller and decides to stop working at the current company he works for. Instead he starts to teach seminars
want to see you again.”
“I...what? You...Dean...” Cas stutters, lost for words.
“I don’t know, Jess. It’s like he’s completely given up. I tried to,” Sam was saying into his cell phone when Dean walked up. “Yeah, I mean I get it I guess. He’s been off since then? Wow. Yeah, I bet he is.” Sam said turning around, noticing Dean standing there. “Oh, Jess. I gotta go. Yeah, he was behind me. Yup. Okay, love you too.” Sam said putting the phone down.
When Dean turns fourteen he begs him mom to let him try pointe. After days of begging Mary finally says yes and they go to get Dean pointe shoes. Dean doesn’t even care that the shoes are pink and have ribbons that he has to wrap on his legs. When they get home Dean takes his shoes and runs to Cas’ to show him. He knows Cas doesn’t see the point of pointe but he acts excited for Dean to have the shoes. That’s how Dean knows Cas loves him and he loves Cas, cause even though they don’t agree on things they are always excited for each other and Dean figures that has to be love.
“Cas is your brother!?” Dean practically shouted, standing up. Oh fuck.
“How did Cas end up summoning the Empty anyways? Did you guys find a spell?” Sam asks, looking over at Dean.
“I really want some edible flowers, kind of flowing down the side? I want them white, and I want them to be cascading down? Does that make sense?” Anna asked, watching as Dean sketched.
assumed he was cheating and
“Okay,” is all Dean says, hanging up the phone and finally standing. His legs hurt from being on the cold concrete floor for so long. He can’t stop crying. His tears are mostly silent now, but they won’t stop.
Sam simply shrugs, “because it’s Cas,” he says, as if that answers everything.  And maybe, once, it would have.
“Last year, Sam, you came back there and what happened?” Dean paused waiting for an answer, but none came. “You tripped and fell, and wrecked the order of four dozen cupcakes!”
: I love you too, Anna.
A big part of Dean hopes they will reach the bunker and Cas will just be there waiting for him, waiting for them to come back and everything will be good again...but as they walk into the bunker, Dean can feel the silence.
, so you know what? Screw him. We don’t need him.
“Yeah, Sammy?” Dean croaks. How is it possible for his voice to sound that bad already?
“C-Cas, please,” Dean begged.
: I hate you.
In Sam’s junior year of college he proposes and gets married to his girlfriend. Castiel and Dean cry, although both deny this. The next year Mary gets married as well. Dean has long been retired from being an instructor at his studio. Instead he mostly does the business work that comes with owning a business and spending time with Castiel.
“God can't control the Empty, remember?”
: uhhh well i went with a girl and we were making out and then we left to you know....have sex in my car so....
Two dick archangels, a fake spell, and a powered-up nephalim later, they manage to defeat Chuck, the world is returned and then....Jack is God.
“Five,” she said with a nod. “I like odd numbers.” She shrugged.
“There’s nothing that needs to be resolved. I needed him and he left me. End of story. Clearly he didn’t - doesn’t feel the same way I do,” Dean says, looking down, and biting his lip. He doesn’t like where this conversation is headed.
“Hmmm, we could make that work with either four or five tiers. Do you have a preference?” He asked.
Dean can’t believe when it hits their last year of college. Dean has been in several off-broadway plays, and Castiel has spoken at many language seminars. Cas learns he also loves translating old texts to English, and has an interview with a company that focuses on translating. He gets the job. Dean and Cas celebrate at a fancy restaurant. This is where Dean finally gets the courage to ask Cas to marry him. Of course Castiel says yes, pulling out the ring he had been carrying around himself, presenting it to Dean. The two laugh over the fact they had both been so nervous to do something they both clearly wanted.
Dean was having fun watching the movie and the cast members, listening to the audience yell things out. He tried to think of who was on the stage and who wasn’t, trying to figure out who Cas could possibly play.
Cas is
“Makes perfect sense, it’s pretty simple,” he said cheerfully. “Did you guys have a cake topper in mind?” He asked looking up at the two of them for a moment before sketching the flowers.
“Dean?! Finally! I’ve been calling for twenty minutes!” Sam says quickly into the phone. He’s been sitting here for twenty minutes, staring where Cas once stood. “Dean?”
“I...” he shook his head, what exactly was he supposed to say anyway? Sorry I got a boner? It’s not my fault Cas is unfairly hot. “Right, I understand.”
School finishes and before they know it Dean and Cas are moving to a one bedroom apartment in New York together. It’s hard at first, they only see each other at night, their schedules too conflicting and both of them too worried about school to figure out a way to see more of each other. After the first month things slow down some, and they work out a schedule for the two of them that works. They’re mostly poor, and living paycheck to paycheck, but they love it more than anything because it’s theirs.
Dean knows he should get up off the cold floor, but he can’t move. It’s like he’s frozen. Stuck staring at the spot where...
Sam blushed his shoulder came up, almost to his ears as he stared at his shoes instead of making eye contact with Dean.
Anna was sitting at his desk, tapping her nails on the surface. Dean took another deep breath, walking in all the way and shutting the door behind him. Okay, time to face the music.
“I... I made a huge mistake.” Dean muttered. “I thought.... I mean...” He shook his head unsure of what to say.
“I”m going to kill you,” Dean muttered, looking over at Sam. His younger brother was sitting on one of the plastic chairs, trying his best to avoid looking at Dean’s exposed butt.
Cas put his phone down and took another sip of the whiskey. It was hard to really be mad at Anna. She had only been doing what she thought was best.
“Yes he’s my brother. What else would he be?” She asked.
“I....” Dean starts, stopping when Sam gives him his signature bitch face. “Fine,” he groans, leaving the room to go and find Cas. It’s not too hard considering Cas hasn’t moved from the main room of the bunker.
A bunch of warnings came on the screen about swearing and being offensive and to leave if you didn’t want to participate in the yelling, etc. Dean laughed, this was going to be interesting. After that finished a lady came onto the stage.
: You should have talked to him. But I will respect your choice.
“Like hell you’re going anywhere! Cas..what you said to me...”
He needs to push it all down. He can’t be a mess right now, not when he needs to help save other people. He grabs a handful of napkins from the glovebox to wipe at his face. They need to figure out how to kill Chuck and then Dean will focus on how the hell to get Cas back from the Empty.
“Because it’s Cas? That’s not an answer, Sam. He’s betrayed us more times than I can count! And he left. He left us,
“Whatever we want, God is gone. I was thinking...maybe take a trip. You, me, Sam and Elieen. Go to a beach. Just forget about hunting and monsters. Just...relax for once in our lives, you know?”
Dean goes to wake up Sam, kick him to his own room, only...it’s not Sam.
He needed to get up and text Cas and apologize for his actions. Just as Dean was thinking about reaching to grab his phone, it pinged with an alert.
Dean let out a sigh, that was probably Anna. “Sam can take care of it,” he told her with a small smile.
“Dude, if anybody else-I mean
Even though Dean knew the invitation for coffee meant nothing, it wouldn’t leave his mind, even as he prepared his dinner and sat down to watch an episode of Dr. Sexy, MD. It wasn’t a date, but...what if it was?
Getting in the Impala, Dean wipes at his face. He needs to be able to drive after all. The roads are empty as he drives and for a moment Dean wonders if Sam meant that everyone on Earth was gone too. But if that was the case why wouldn’t Chuck have taken them as well? Dean almost wishes for it at this point. Take him away from the pain he’s feeling, the loss of Cas.
“But...” Sam started to say, stopping when Dean glared even harder. “Okay, Dean.” He said with a shrug, going back up front.
: Anna.
“Alright, Mr. Winchester, Nurse Jess here is going to numb the area with lidocaine, it should stop you from feeling anything as we take the glass out, and any stitches — if required”, Dr. Novak said, setting medical supplies on a tray in the corner.
Going over to wash his hands and pull on some blue gloves, he pressed gently across Dean’s skin feeling the area around one of the pieces of embedded glass. Dean let out a small whimper. Damn Sam. After pressing around some of the other pieces, Dr. Novak took off his gloves and came to sit in front of Dean.
Cas leaned against the door, not moving until he heard the roar of the Impala’s engine. Sighing, Cas pushed off from the door and went to the couch. He couldn’t believe Anna had given Dean his address.
Dean sighed, pushing off the counter to clean up from the cake tasting. It obviously wasn’t a date. A nearly married man didn’t ask someone out on a date. That just wouldn’t make sense.
The bakery had been kind of slow that day, which he didn’t mind but it did make the day lag. All they had left to deal with was a tasting. The couple would be coming after they were closed, which meant staying back late for Dean, but the potential of selling a wedding cake made it worthwhile. He needed to be sure to make a good first impression though, and Dean wanted to be sure that the bakery was looking its best. Glancing at the time, Dean decided to start packing up the pastries that didn’t sell for the day before the couple arrived.
With another sigh, Dean went to the fridge to grab the cake slices that he had prepared for the cake tasting. He put them on a tray and walked out into the front of the bakery. He frowned, looking at how closely Anna and Cas were sitting. Which was stupid, of course they would be sitting close together.
