“What do you mean your magic doesn’t work?” Sherlock’s voice wasn’t cruel, merely curious. “You’re not
John huffed a laugh. “Right, then. Give it over.”  Taking the tube from Sherlock, he squeezed a dollop onto the first two fingers of his left hand and then used his thumb to spread the ointment across his palm. It warmed quickly and became more liquid in his hand. Sherlock watched him, his breaths becoming more shallow and quick.  He reached for the tube, but John refused to relinquish it.
Mike leaned forward, his meal forgotten. “The first time I met him,” he said, “he told me that my grandfather was dying. And he was right - granda had pancreatic cancer. Mum and Da knew, of course, but they hadn’t figured out how to tell me yet.” Mike let out a heavy sigh. “They were shocked when I asked them about it. And, mind you, all I had said to Sherlock was, ‘Hi, my name is Mike.’ That’s it.”
John didn’t have a place in the wizarding world. But he felt like he knew right from wrong, and he knew that Potter was right and that Voldemort was the worst type of bully.
When John pulls away, Sherlock’s eyes are closed, and he remains frozen for a few heartbeats before his eyes languidly drift open. His gaze is piercing. His eyes are more grey and green in this lighting. They were more blue this morning. He licks his bottom lip and continues to stare at John, but there’s no expression on his face.
Like John, Sherlock’s already removed his shoes and socks, and his suit jacket has already been primly hung in the closet. This means John only has to get through the dress shirt, and he puts all of his energy into gently releasing the buttons. He doesn’t dare to look at Sherlock’s face because Sherlock is staring at him with wide, adoring eyes, and if they make eye contact, John suspects he’ll lose fine motor function.
John shook his head, feeling more than a little shell-shocked. “Wow,” he finally managed to say. “Molly told me you did this, but seeing it - wow.”
They’ve missed the last train back to London, but John doesn’t care because Mycroft has been paying their expenses. They book a suite in the poshest hotel in which John’s ever set foot.  They ride the elevator up to the top floor, and Sherlock is still talking and laughing the entire way. John doesn’t feel like Sherlock’s light makes him dimmer - he feels like it feeds him and makes him glow.
Still, the old hurt in his chest waned. He remained an outsider but - he was surprised to discover - it felt different when you were an outsider with someone else.
It turned out that Sholto really didn’t care if John’s spells were just as likely to crumble like sand as listen when John waved his wand. The senior wizard only cared that John was thoughtful and steadfast, not scared of the dragons, and didn’t become sickly around blood or claw injuries.
John collected his things from the locker room and prepared to start his journey home. He dragged his feet, knowing that he was acting like a lovesick idiot and hating himself for it, but also feeling helpless in the face of his all-encompassing misery.
could see the jewelry store scenes, I'm sure I could figure it out. There's no way the perpetrator could have covered all of his or her tracks. I can see things other people can't."
Anderson’s eyes were ablaze with anger. He glared past John. “This isn’t over, Holmes!” he said fiercely.
Sherlock’s imperious façade melted away. His eyes remained open, albeit unfocused, and he stared at John with an expression of wonder. He began to pant heavily, little gusts of air escaping his mouth like they were being wrung from his lungs, and as John began to move his hand quicker, he began to softly vocalize:
Most of their mixed emissions had landed on their hands, but some of the mess was on John’s shirts and pants. John glanced at Sherlock and was both amused and irritated to see that somehow the other boy had avoided the worst of it.  After carefully pulling on his school jacket, Sherlock combed his fingers through his curls and became the picture of academic innocence. The only sign of their activities on Sherlock was the pink color high on his cheeks.
Sherlock was not fighting. His head was hanging down and his face was obscured by his curls. His shoulders drooped and his posture broadcast defeat.
Roaring, Sherlock kicked his legs out and was satisfied when his feet hit metal, creating an echoing din. The room was smaller than he had thought, and it wasn’t a wall across from him. It was a door.
John didn’t give Anderson time to back off. He skipped forward, jabbing out with his left fist. It connected with Anderson’s nose with a satisfying crunch. The other boy didn’t fall, but he stumbled back several feet, his hands pressed against his face as a litany of curses fell from his mouth.
The boy John had punched in the gut had managed to regain his feet. He remained awkwardly hunched forward with one arm wrapped around his lower abdomen. He pulled up his friend and then began to tug at Anderson’s arm. “Come on, Phil,” he said. “Let’s go.”
Sherlock was studying his face, his expression filled with suspicion and a not small amount of fascination.  Finally he simply said, "I see," and he returned his gaze to his phone. John didn't miss the splotches of pink on his cheeks.
“John, this is Sarah Sawyer.” Molly weaved her arm under the other girl’s. “She’s planning to apply to med school as well.”
It took Sherlock all of thirty seconds to pick the cuffs, and even less time for him to slip away into the confusion of the busy street.
An acrid smell tickled his nose. Sherlock slowly sat up. He saw that at some point in the night, he had been incontinent of urine. Every single one of his muscles ached, even his eyelids. There was a sharp sting in his mouth, and as he moved his tongue, he became aware that he had bitten deep into this muscle.
“It sounds to me,” she said carefully, “that this is a kid who doesn’t have a lot of friends. He probably doesn’t know a lot about social interactions. It sounds like he feels something for you. When he saw you flirting with a girl, which is what you do - you flirt, Johnny, you are the absolute worst - it hurt his feelings. He doesn’t know how to deal with that, so he’s super pissed off.”
“Ah,” John swallowed and winced. “Yeah, that was my fault. There was a robbery across from my bus stop and I mentioned it to Sherlock. He got excited. I guess there’s been a spree and he thinks he can solve it or something.”
. John thrust his hips upwards and grinned into Sherlock’s mouth as the other man’s groan reverberated through both of their chests. John reached down, finally able to put his hands on the arse he had been trying (and failing) not to stare at for months.
Sherlock’s eyes narrowed, and it looked liked he would respond, but then he buried his nose in his chemistry book. The gesture was rude, but as John took in the slightly hunched shoulders, the way Sherlock worried his lower lip between his teeth, and the sharp movements of Sherlock’s hands as he turned the pages, John revised his earlier opinion.
With Sherlock, John spent hours investigating illicitly cursed items, trolling through the magical nooks and crannies of magical London, and interrogating humans and the more advanced magical creatures alike. As the months went by, John grew more comfortable talking to other wizards, but he still felt like an interloper amongst them.
“Hey!” John stumbled forward. “Wait a second!” He stepped on something that made an ugly squelching sound.  Glancing down, John saw that it was their used condom, neatly tied off but left on the floor by Sherlock. Embarrassed, John snagged it off the ground and shoved it into his back pocket with the tissues. He then hurried out of the closet and into the dark hallway, just in time to see Sherlock slip through the door that led to the dance floor.
to be kissed before, and he was pretty sure he didn’t want to be kissed now. Kissing had always seemed like an unsanitary practice, highly illogical and therefore beneath his notice.  But as Victor’s soft lips lingered on his own, warm and with just the right amount of give, Sherlock was surprised to find that the sensation was not unpleasant.
John has no idea what he’s talking about - did anyone even mention a dog walker? - but he can’t stop himself from smiling back at Sherlock. Sherlock squeezes his shoulders once and whirls, stepping over the body and striding away, his dark coat flaring around his feet.
Sherlock raises his head and glares at John, but his wild hair and blushed cheeks blunt its effect. “I bought condoms and lube. I put them in your luggage. Do try and keep up.”
Sherlock reared back, and in the sudden cold air where his body had been, John shivered. But then Sherlock shuffled backwards awkwardly on the bed to rid himself of his pajama bottoms as well, and John found himself mesmerized. Sherlock seemed to be sculpted from miles of pale skin, and despite his thinness, his arms, legs and shoulders were lined with lean muscle.
John’s fingers spasmed and tightened their grip. His partner raised his arms over his head and leaned forward, his body curling like a snake’s, and his smooth cheek slid close to John’s temple. He smelled like mint and sweat and something else - maybe whiskey? - and definitely a little like sex, and he followed John’s movements with an unnatural sense, like he knew how John was going to move before John himself did.
There has been a multi-car pile up on the M25, so Sherlock is triaged as a lower priority. His patience, tenuous at even the best of times, has long since snapped, and he finds a reason to argue every medical invention. He declares the taking of vital signs unnecessary and bares his teeth when the nursing student tries to start an IV. He concludes that the hospital blankets are unsatisfactory and petulantly throws them to the floor before he demands to talk to the charge nurse about the harshness of the overhead lighting. He is cruel to the registrar who takes his history, and he snips at John, taking exception to his tone of voice, his recitation of the events that have led them to the A&E, and even the squeaking sounds his shoes make on the lino.
“I’m not complaining.” John felt a sudden need to defend the other boy. “It was amazing how he knew all that. He’s … well, he’s remarkable, isn’t he?”
Last night, John had thought Sherlock was maybe a few years older than him, but now he could see that they were the same age. In his school uniform, Sherlock looked years younger, smaller, and somehow fragile. No glitter graced his fine jawbone, and no product tamed his hair. His dark curls fell messily over his forehead, half obscuring his eyes.
After dinner, Harry offered to do the dishes and badgered John until he agreed to help. For a few minutes, they worked quietly in tandem. Harry washed and he dried, his mind a million miles away.
Their lips meet again. Their kisses are gentler this time around but no less passionate. John slips his lower arm between Sherlock and the bed so that he can pull the taller man closer. His upper arm pets down Sherlock’s side. Sherlock rests both palms against John’s chest. Their lips move slowly, and then the heat begins to grow again. John pulls Sherlock closer and their erections press together, only separated by two thin layers of clothing. Sherlock gasps into John’s mouth, and John thrusts his tongue deeper, fucking Sherlock’s mouth.
“Shit,” John repeated, and he raised one shaking hand so that he could run his fingers through Sherlock’s tumbled dark curls. Sherlock’s eyes drifted closed, a look of peace falling across his face, and he pressed his tongue against the underside of John’s cock.
“John,” Sherlock murmured, his cheek pressed tightly to John’s, his morning stubble rasping against John’s own, and John madly thought that his voice should be outlawed by the Ministry like an Unforgivable Curse. No one should have a voice like that.
As the minutes ticked away, John knew with increasing certainty that Sherlock’s reaction had been his fault. The knowledge dug into his skin like a bur. He had just been talking to his friends, he told himself - well, his friends and Sarah.
John rubbed his hands over his face. “Look, I think we’re getting off track. I think you’re mad at me because you saw me … talking to Sarah Sawyer and you jumped to the wrong conclusion.”
In a few moments, he would need to stand. The vending machine was not far, and there he could purchase a chocolate bar. This would have to keep him until he was able to reach his dingy apartment on Montague Street. Surely there was something edible in the fridge, and not just the tonsils he had brought home last week.
Peevish pale eyes locked on his for a moment and a single eyebrow rose arrogantly. Obviously, the eyebrow implied. The boy then returned his attention to the lock, and in another moment, the door swung open.  He stood and disappeared into the darkness beyond.
At first, it wasn’t bad, exactly. But it was so much, and how could Sherlock respond to the touch on his right cheek when Victor’s hand was then moving to his belt? How could he answer what he wanted when he wasn’t even sure what Victor was offering?  It had been years since the last time too much sensory input overwhelmed Sherlock’s calm, but now there was too much to taste, smell, and feel. He was unable to deduce what Victor would do next, and he did not understand how his own body responded.
John realized that he was staring at Sherlock’s lips. The other boy’s expression had become guarded, and again John wondered if Sherlock thought about their night in the club. He wanted to say something, but wasn’t sure how to even approach the subject now.
In Sherlock’s experience, these syncopal episodes were self-limiting, lasting only a handful of seconds. Although he couldn’t be certain, when he opened his eyes to peer at the ceiling, he was fairly sure he had lost only seconds.
Molly nodded. “On the first day of Year Two, he told our teacher that her husband was having an affair. The rest of the day was, uh, exciting, I guess?”
In the space of an hour, London had gone from a whirligig of light and color and charm to a complete and utter drag.
Since the other men weren’t paying attention to him, John peered around the large pool area, unable to shake the feeling that he was missing something. It nagged in the back of his head, and made his eyes blur and blink, but he could feel it - he could practically
For the next twenty minutes, John was provided a haphazard tour of the campus as Mike pointed out important landmarks, random factoids (“Never use that loo - you don’t want to know what happened there two years ago”), and lazily quizzed John about his personal life.
To recover from his concussion, Sherlock is prescribed brain rest. His lingering headache blunts his manic energy, but it is hardly enough to keep him sedentary. John splurges on expensive headphones and fills Sherlock’s phone with rare recordings of classical concertos from online music libraries.  He spends more money on digital music in those three days than he has in his entire life, but if it keeps Sherlock from harrying off to injury and second impact syndrome, John decides it’s worth it.
Their kitchen table was covered in the dried remains of various plants, just half of which John recognized, and Sherlock was finely chopping their roots, making small piles in a pattern only he knew. John was in the living room, ostensibly enjoying the heat of the fire, but actually keeping watch to ensure his flatmate didn’t accidentally poison himself.
Sherlock hums and his shoulders hunch, as though he’s going to try and sit up. John catches his right shoulder and pushes down. “Uh uh,” he says softly. “Stay down.”
Sherlock’s smile turns soft and lovely, a delicate thing. “Yes,” he agrees, his voice a whisper. He rolls toward John, and John turns on his side to meet him.
John felt a flush of pleasure. Sarah wasn’t playing games. She clearly found him attractive. She looked at him, not at her phone. Her smile was freely given, not a rare gift. Her body language was open and inviting.
John wraps a hand behind Sherlock’s skull and pushes with his other hand against Sherlock’s pectoral, just over his heart, gently settling the other man on his back. He settles into the space between Sherlock’s legs and rolls his hips, swallowing the moan out of Sherlock’s mouth. Sherlock’s erection waned during their conversation, but as John licks into Sherlock’s mouth and continues to thrust his hips lazily, he feels it plumping up again. He reaches blindly until he manages to snag the lube and he opens it with one hand. He squeezes a bit too much onto his palm and then he elbows Sherlock’s left thigh.
His mind was sluggish as he considered the events of the previous night. He had taken his regular 7% solution - no more and no less - with careful preparation. And yet he had experienced a bit of an overdose.
“You broke my nose!” Anderson finally managed to shout, his voice sounding even more nasally through the damaged cartilage. Blood was trickling through his fingers and dripping down his chin.
Third period was about to end, and John was rushing down the hallway. He had dawdled in the library, and he was almost late for physics. He snuck a peek at his wrist watch - he had two minutes left.
in Sherlock’s eyes, the expressions he covers up so quickly. He thinks about the hurt he just saw in Sherlock and how he seemed to deflate.
Sherlock’s headache fades by day four, just in time for a private client to bring them a case. It’s only a four or a five, but John suspects Sherlock is not quite feeling one hundred percent, and he takes the case with surprisingly little complaint. The client works at the Natural History Museum and the problem is a missing artifact, which Sherlock suspects never left the museum. John thinks Sherlock should still be resting at home, but he recognizes a pipe dream when he sees one, so he decides to be grateful that the case at least keeps them off the streets of London.
“And if it makes you feel any better, Sherlock,” John went on, his voice now taking a conciliatory tone. “They weren’t very competent criminals.” His smile was crooked and he seemed almost embarrassed for the counterfeiters’ failures..
Now Harry leaned over the table, her eyes no longer glazed but stony and ferocious.  “Now look,” she said, and her voice cut like steel over the loud music.  “You are John Watson. You are my little brother, and you are amazing. What’s the worst that could happen? He tells you to bugger off? Fine! His loss! He’s lucky to get your attention!”  Just as suddenly, she leaned back, her face still furious, and even Clara looked flabbergasted by the speech.
John blinked at Sherlock’s description of his hand job before shaking the thought away with a toss of his head. "I tried to follow you, you know," he said.  "If you hadn't run away so quickly, I thought we could have, I don't know, exchanged numbers or something. But then you were gone and I didn't think I'd see you again. I couldn't believe it when I saw you in biology on the first day of school. Come on, Sherlock, you've got to admit..." Under Sherlock’s expressionless gaze, he felt his words dry up. "It ... it's got to mean
Sherlock started, and his eyes dropped to his desk. The pink of his cheeks spread, and John saw that when he blushed, the color went to his long, pale neck, the one that John had kissed the night before.
Afterwards, John wouldn’t be able to remember what had made him turn his head. There were plenty of other people around him - spectators and players, students and teachers and parents. There was no reason for his gaze to be drawn away from the girl at his side to a single figure just on the periphery of his vision. But still John looked, his attention drawn by some unknown gravity.
They came to the edge of the dance form, and the other boy led John around the dancing crowd until they reached the DJ’s set up. There, in the shadows, there was a door, and the other boy began to tug John towards it. John glanced over his shoulder once, wondering about the wisdom of following this stranger, no matter how good looking he was. He couldn’t see Harry and Clara. Still, he knew that his hesitation was only pretense. There was no way he wasn’t going to follow this boy..
Clutching John’s hand, sweating with pain and nausea, and feeling like his skin was on fire because it was all too much, Sherlock could do nothing more than close his eyes tightly and nod.
They found a bench, and John bullied Sherlock into sitting down. He remained standing, stationed just in front of Sherlock’s knees so that the taller boy wouldn’t get it in his head to flee.
But John could only shake his head, and he felt his heart begin to race as an uncomfortable twist began to form in his stomach. He shook his head stubbornly, pinching his lips tightly together.
“You always get your way, don’t you?” John asked, leaning forward and speaking almost directly into Sherlock’s lips. “Posh name, posh clothing - you’re all public school.”
John grabbed Anderson by the shoulders and yanked hard, side stepping so that Anderson fell on his rear a few feet behind John. Now John was between Sherlock and the other boys, exactly where he wanted to be. Keeping his back to Sherlock, he bounced on the balls of his feet, his fists up and ready.
Yet in some ways, John felt like Sherlock was as much of an outsider as himself. Sherlock flitted through the magical community, never staying long enough to lay down any roots. Wherever he went, dragging John along, he was a visitor. Lestrade’s team of Aurors peered at him with suspicion, and while Sherlock had a great many acquaintances, he had no other friends, as far as John could tell.
Sherlock looked at him, and in the moment that their eyes met, John could swear he saw a flicker of some deep emotion.
“You’ll figure it out,” Harry said. She leaned a bit so that she could bump his shoulder with her own. “You’re a good guy.”
Harry came over for dinner on Thursday. Mrs. Watson made spaghetti, and Harry downed two beers in quick succession. She then dominated the dinner conversation with stories about her classmates. Mrs. Watson laughed and Harry preened under the attention. John robotically shoveled food into his mouth and tried to remember to smile.
“Oh!” Sherlock stands suddenly, and John’s hand falls away. Sherlock spins. His lips are parted in a wide expression of revelation and his eyes are bright when they meet John’s. “The dog walker!” he says, grabbing John’s shoulders in both large hands. His goofy smile, the one John has begun to think of as his own, is back.
John moaned and grabbed Sherlock’s shoulders, reversing their positions so that Sherlock was now pressed against the wall. His hands were clumsy and Sherlock’s jeans were ridiculously tight, but with a bit of help from the other boy, John managed to snake his left hand into Sherlock’s pants. His fingers closed around Sherlock’s hot length, and John gave two experimental tugs.
“Wow,” Mike said. “I mean, you’ve been sitting with him in biology every morning, but I didn’t know you were … friends?” He said the word cautiously, as though unsure.
“Yeah,” John said, and to his surprise, he found that he was. He ached, and he was sure that he could sleep for three days. He felt both nauseous and absolutely starving. But he was alive, and so was Sherlock.
A litany of observations run from Sherlock’s mouth, half-formed thoughts cut off as he interrupts himself. The frenzied pace of his words is too fast for anyone to follow. Lestrade crosses his arms and frowns at Sherlock.
It’s the please that does it. John feels his cock give a twitch. He rolls off of Sherlock, tugging his jumper over his head and then working clumsy fingers over the buttons of his shirt. He falls awkwardly on his back, tugging jeans down and off, and he spares a glance at Sherlock, who is also pulling off his trousers. Their eyes meet, and suddenly John’s overcome with the absurdity of the moment. He and Sherlock Holmes are lying in a giant bed together, in the penthouse suite of a luxury hotel in Scotland, and they are both starkers except for their pants.
By the time Mycroft returned, Sherlock was sitting up against the trunk of the tree. His face was pinched and white, and he was holding his wrist to his chest. But he was upright, looking around, and he was alive - whole and alive. Mycroft, had he possessed the ability, could have wept for joy.
Sherlock sneered and jerked his shoulder out from under the constable’s friendly hand. Without another word, he turned on his heel and stormed down the sidewalk, moving quickly away from the flashing police lights and yellow tape … and then cut into the small alley between the bodega and high-end hair salon. He climbed the chain-link fence on the other side, and then slithered up the gutter. It was not dignified, of course, but it worked.
“What makes you think I have one?” he asked, his voice a smoky whisper. “Plenty of wizards can’t cast the charm.”
His heart had started to pound, and he could feel sweat soaking the back of his silk shirt, making it stick uncomfortably to his spine.
John blinked at his teacup.  “I don’t know, Sherlock,” he said, turning around and deciding that if he was going to do this, he’d face the other man.
Wincing, John closed his eyes. He wasn’t a virgin. His previous experiences, however, had been what he thought of as typical for a teenager: a quick handie from his current girlfriend after their date ended but before her curfew started. Furtive over-the-clothes frottage in the basement of the library during a free period at school. Those times with James - no. No, that wasn’t good to think about right now.
“That’s not-” John moaned, sucking on the tongue in his mouth. “I mean-” Deft hands yanked his jeans down just below his hips, and a clever finger began stroking the wet spot in the front of his pants.
“I’m not a total idiot, you know.” John crossed his arms and frowned heavily, watching Sherlock mix and measure with practiced ease.
Sherlock didn’t look up from his notebook, but he stopped writing. He stared intently at the pages of his notebook, his pen frozen above the paper. John made no attempt to hide the fact that he was studying Sherlock’s face as he slowly ate his sandwich.
. His body was in his dormitory bed with Victor. His lips and tongue and cock were there, and they were moving and slipping and sucking. But Sherlock’s mind had simply slipped away.
. This man, this ridiculous walking contraindication, had again shocked Sherlock. The detective thought he had seen all there was to see of the human race, both cruel and ordinary. And now, again, one man stood before Sherlock with bloody knuckles and a gentle face and eyes so filled with …
Sherlock had no compunction against testing cursed items on his unsuspecting flatmate, and John supposed he was lucky that Sherlock only did so when he was sure - mostly sure - that they wouldn’t cause any permanent damage.
From anyone else, it would have been a boast. Granted, John thought, it was a boast for Sherlock. But it was also true. Those pale eyes saw everything.
Sherlock takes a few shaky breaths and raises an unsteady hand to his mouth, wiping his lips. “I beg to differ,” he says. He is clearly trying for haughty, but the waver under his voice gives him away.
Blackmailer and detective are fished out by a passing tour boat, filled with thrilled tourists snapping photos. John is reunited with Sherlock on the banks of the river and he internally debates the medical appropriateness of punching Sherlock so soon after his head injury. Sherlock, looking not unlike a drowned terrier, grins madly as Lestrade reads him the riot act.
Moriarty was not looking at him, having eyes only for Sherlock. Sherlock was angled away, but he must have seen something in John’s body language, because he stopped muttering spells, and his head cocked. He turned to stare at John.
John swallowed against his dry throat.  “I don’t even know your name,” he finally managed to stammer.
Smiling down at his own hands, John dared to lean towards Sherlock - just a little - and gently knock their shoulders together. "That's cool," he said. "You should be a detective."
Sherlock lets out another long sigh, and John lets his hand drift lower. His touch slips down the bony knobs of Sherlock’s back, and he thinks about what he’ll feed Sherlock the next day. The man’s lost half a stone during this case and it’s not weight he can spare to lose. John’s hand settles between Sherlock’s shoulder blades and he begins to rub the tense muscles. The air from the open window is cold, but Sherlock is warm.
Sherlock made a huffing noise, halfway between annoyance and amusement, and he gently nudged John’s notebook to the side to reveal the piece of technology. He handed it to John with a smirk, and for the briefest moment, his index finger trailed across John’s palm when he handed it over.
, however, have a healthy sense of outrage, especially when Sherlock noted his impotence. The man charged Sherlock with his machete raised high, and it was only by employing a fancy bit of bartitsu that Sherlock was able to escape any serious harm.
“Hey,” John said, forcing himself to keep his tone light. “I’d like to see you again. Maybe I could get your number?”
John shrugged and squared his shoulders. “Well, there’s no reason for the three of us to fight for table space while he works alone.  I’ll see you two after class.”
John licked his lips, and the other boy’s gaze briefly flickered down, and then returned to meet John’s stare. A single dark eyebrow lifted, but the face - the beautiful face, John thought absently - remained cool and impartial as glass.
There was a rustling to his left, and Sherlock turned his head, slowly in case of nausea. Thankfully, his stomach remained settled.
John had never thought himself handsome, but he knew he wasn’t bad-looking either. Sure, he was a little on the short side, but despite that - or more likely because of that, he reasoned - he had learned how to project a confidence that he didn’t always feel. He knew people listened when he talked, turned towards him when he joined a group, and he had never had to struggle to find a date. He thought he had a nice enough face, and more than one girl had commented on the deep blue of his eyes. A summer on the pitch before the big move had left him dark with a tan and leanly muscled.
Ignoring the pounding in his heart, John turned and made his way across the room. He took a few fortifying breaths and squared his shoulders.
Sherlock’s hips buckle - he’s trying to get up again - but John holds him down easily. He wonders idly that if there were other consulting detectives in the world, would they be as stubborn as his?
“Want to do it again tomorrow before we leave for London?” he asks. “If you’re not too sore, of course,” he hurries to add. It feels cowardly to ask this way - to hint at whether Sherlock wants this to be a one time thing or not. John doesn’t think it will be, but he can’t help the whisper of doubt in his chest.
“What Mum doesn’t know can’t hurt her,” Harry replied. She sipped her gin and tonic, leaving lipstick stains on the straw when she leaned back to study John. Even though her eyes were glazed with the effects of her third cocktail, Harry had a way of looking through him as though she could read his thoughts. John looked away.
did you get in here?!”), and Sherlock found himself being marched from the building in handcuffs so that Constable Lestrade could take him in for disturbing a crime scene, or some other rot like that.
John   ignored that last bit and focused on the other things he wanted to   know, now that he felt he was allowed to ask the questions.  He liked   carrying on a conversation during foreplay.  It was, in some ways, more   intimate than the actual sex.  He pulled his mouth from Sherlock's   collarbone. "So you have before, with women?"
John   shoved the wet towel onto the floor with his foot before the moisture   could leech into the bedding.  "But you didn't lose on purpose."
Sherlock   laughed, then twisted to drop his cigarette in the abandoned plastic   cup.  Then he was back and snogging the life out of John, tasting   vaguely of tobacco and Coke.  It wasn't a very long kiss, since they   were surrounded by spectators and a camera crew and neither was fond of a   spectacle, but it held a definite promise that once the event was  over,  there would be more.
e dealt with those   feelings the way he dealt with most other things, by keeping his eyes   forward and soldiering on.  Of course, if not having feelings was a   matter of will alone, none of it would have been an issue in the first   place.
He   took a step forward, chasing Sherlock's withdrawal right back into the   man's personal space.  John hesitated for a split second before making  a  grab for Sherlock to prevent a further retreat.  Sherlock looked   startled, his eyes darting to where John's hand was clamped around his   wrist, then back up to John's face.  John pulled him closer to his body   and set his hand lightly on Sherlock's neck, a fair warning of what he   was about to do.  When he was met with no resistance, John tilted his   head and pushed himself upward.  He brushed a feather-light kiss over   Sherlock's lips before pulling back.  Sherlock followed John's mouth for   a second until he caught himself, his eyes snapping wide open.
Sherlock was fiddling with a ring stand and he looked cross. “The police have not been terribly forthright with the information they’ve collected.”
John’s gaze dropped to the ground, and his lips twitched as though he was trying to hide a smile. “Yeah, well, next time criminals hold a wet rag to your nose and mouth, you should try holding your breath. They thought I had passed out like you, and after they left me alone in my cell, I got out of my ropes, waited for someone to open the door to check on me, and took him down.”
The conversation - if it can even be called that - between the Holmes brothers has been minimally verbal. Mycroft’s contributions are short sentences that could have three or four meanings, and he punctuates each one with a raised eyebrow.  Sherlock, for his part, is creating truly awful warbles from his violin that sound not unlike a dying cat.
If John spends several nights alone in his bed trying to remember the softness of Sherlock’s curls around his fingers as he fights sleep … well, no one will know.
“Yes, it is,” John said, his voice low and filled with barely checked fury. “If you want to come for Sherlock, you have to go through me.”
John’s mum took another extra shift at the hospital that night. John made himself ramen and ate it in his room, reading through his chemistry lab notes to make sure he had understood every step.
John jumped. He realized he had been drying the same plate for five minutes. “What are you talking about?” He wasn’t looking at his sister’s face, but John could practically hear Harry roll her eyes.
John’s hand slips into Sherlock’s hair and, for a moment, both men freeze. And then as if a button has been pushed, the fight goes out of Sherlock, and he relaxes in his bed. Eyebrows raised in disbelief, John begins to gently run his fingers through Sherlock’s hair. Sherlock lets out a giant sigh and his body becomes loose and willing. The ferocious intensity evaporates, and Sherlock’s countenance grows peaceful. It’s not the peaceful mask he presents when he doesn’t want someone to see what he’s thinking, but true peacefulness. He’s become, John realizes with a shock, tranquil.  And all John had to do was pet his hair.
John rolled his eyes and chased after the detective and into the windy streets, Sherlock’s spell keeping him dry and warm.
Under one of the spotlights, no more than fifteen feet away from the table at which John nursed his beer, a slender body was moving with the music. At first, John couldn’t tell the gender of the dancer, but then thin hips swiveled in his direction, and John could see the masculine lines in dark jeans so tight they seemed to be painted onto the body beneath. The club was beyond crowded and so people kept moving between John and the subject of his perusal, but those other bodies became nothing more than background scenery.  John couldn’t tear his eyes away.
Sarah had a sweet face and pale greyish eyes that reminded him of Sherlock’s. She was biting her lower lip and looking at John under her eyelashes.  John felt himself perk up at the attention.
John would stand just out of touching distance with the other man, and Sherlock Holmes, who had once been known to be a clever wizard but not a particularly powerful one, would spin spells with magic deep and powerful, and John would close his eyes and feel that magic throb through his veins.
,” Sherlock said, and he made it sound like this was the best thing that something could be. “I detest being bored.” He then looked up, frowning, as though surprised to find John sitting next to him. “What are you doing here?”
“Honestly, Mike, you and food,” Molly said good-naturedly, and the group started to make their way through the crowd of spectators and players. John found himself next to Sarah, which gave him a small thrill, especially with the signals she was throwing his way. It felt nice, comforting even, to know where he stood with someone - to be sent clear signals that he could interpret and didn’t make him lie awake at night wondering.
Granted, they hadn’t spoken since that night.  John was pretty sure that Sherlock watched him during biology class, but he had never been able to catch him in the act. He was also positive that he had seen tousled dark curls in his peripheral vision once during a study period when Molly, Mike and John had sat outside, sunning themselves in the courtyard. But when John had turned to look, there had been no sign of Sherlock. After that first day of school, whenever John had tried to make eye contact, Sherlock had been furiously studying a book, or his phone, or anything else that wasn’t John Watson.
John had known it was bad, but he hadn’t realized how bad. The entire building was covered in explosive spells. They weren’t complicated, but there were so many of them, each one overlying another, and the air in the room was thick and cloying with potential magic, all held on a hair trigger by Moriarity.
Sherlock insisted to John that he wasn’t a hero, that caring wasn’t an advantage. But John thought of how Sherlock never made him feel less for having unruly magic, how Sherlock had spelled his robes to keep John warm, how Sherlock sometimes stared at John with a surprisingly gentle gaze when he thought John wasn’t looking. He thought of how when the flat had been infested with imps two months ago, Sherlock had refused to call the exterminators and instead spent hours perfecting the charms that would drive the creatures away, annoyed but unharmed.
John can see it before it happens. He only has time to open his mouth for a warning before Sherlock raises one arrogant eyebrow, cocks his head, and then leans forward to messily vomit on Lestrade’s shoes.
Sherlock’s spell, suddenly and cleanly, caught. The fire under the pewter snapped out, yellow smoke raced downwards like running water into the cauldron, and the deep purple potion paled to a pretty lavender, smooth, viscous, and inert.
Molly shrugged and spoke hesitantly. “He’s Sherlock. It’s hard to describe. He’s usually pretty quiet. I mean, when he’s not being…” she drifted off.  “You know.”
John felt like his lungs were on fire. His heart was pounding madly in his chest, his calves were burning, and he was growing what promised to be a truly spectacular bruise on his right hip - and he was having the time of his life. The game was in its final minutes, and his team was just barely in the lead. Their opponents had been good, but John’s team was better.
This time John does laugh and he reaches out to Sherlock, snags him under the armpit, and tugs. Sherlock lets out a sound of protest, but he allows John to pull him until his head is resting on John’s lap.  He grumbles nastily under his breath, but then he rubs his cheek against John’s jeans. John finds a large curl right behind Sherlock’s ear and wraps it around his index finger. He releases this lock and searches for another, twirling Sherlock’s hair lazily. Sherlock says something under his breath that sounds like it could be an insult, but he relaxes into John’s hands. He doesn’t sleep, but he’s still and quiet, and they remain that way for the rest of the evening until John excuses himself to bed.
him. This was why it had felt like his own heart had been ripped in two when his older brother had left him for school. Mycroft had left him for debate club and fencing and philosophy and Latin and
After hands had been shaken and backs slapped, John gathered his things and made his way over to his friends, Greg at his side.
Sherlock was suddenly at John’s side, his graceful fingers running across John’s face. His right hand pushed hard into John’s chest as though to feel the heartbeat beneath.
Sherlock continued to play with his phone. He was pulling up a website that seemed to be for a neighborhood watch. John had the impression that he was stalling before answering.
John felt his shoulders tense, and he turned back to the kettle. He didn’t want to have this conversation. He didn’t want to see Sherlock’s face when he found out that his flatmate was little more than a glorified Squib. It had happened before with other friends, and John hated it every time.
Their eyes met, and for a moment John could forget the peril and near-certainty of their deaths. For that heartbeat, it was simply he and Sherlock, the two of them against the world.
.” Sherlock tried to infuse his voice with steel. For once he was glad of MacKinnon’s unobservant nature - the other man did not notice Sherlock’s precarious state. He startled, realized who was threatening him, and fled the toilets.
Sherlock wasn’t the most powerful wizard that John had ever met. But he knew more spells than John, had memorized the most archaic charms and hexes, and his understanding of plants and potions bordered on encyclopedic. His power was not vast, but sometimes it seemed to John that he
Sherlock blinked, and his eyes sluggishly focused on Lestrade’s face. The other man wasn’t worried, at least not yet, but his brows were drawn tight and the lines around his eyes were more pronounced than usual.
For several long seconds, it seemed like the other boy would remain a statue, and John wondered if he had been mistaken about the twitching lip. Then, quite suddenly, the taller boy rolled his hips and began to mirror John’s movements.
Sherlock’s interest in the chemistry was infectious, his knowledge boundless, and John found that he learned more under Sherlock’s absent-minded tutelage than he had the previous night, when he had spent an entire hour reading over the textbook in preparation.
John swallowed roughly and moved back another step. “Don’t? Don’t what?” He tried to meet Sherlock’s gaze, but the other boy was looking away, and John could feel him retreating even though their bodies remained close.
“All right,” John says and the doubt in his chest is gone, flushed away by a warm swell of joy that grows and grows, threatening to spill from his lips in incredulous laughter or from his eyes in happy tears.
Didn’t criminals have any sense of originality, Sherlock wondered crossly, as he picked the lock of the back door.
The words are devastating, and John’s brain is overcome by white noise. Sherlock is moving against him, but John’s thoughts have become soupy slow, and he has to open and close his mouth several times before he can get the words out. “You .. want…”
John’s heart breaks, just a little, and he drops the supplies onto the bed so that he can crawl to Sherlock. He reaches for Sherlock’s head, cradling his jaw with both hands. “No,” he says. “
Panic began to seep into his veins, but before it got too bad, his stomach rioted and he coughed up a mouthful of vomitus.
As though he sensed John’s perusal, Sherlock looked up, and for several long moments, they could only stare at each other. Their hands continued to move. John was struck speechless. Sherlock’s beautiful eyes, usually so cool and assessing, were filled with emotion. John was suddenly struck with the thought that maybe there was no school-Sherlock nor club-Sherlock. Both were constructs, and he was seeing something raw and real right now.
Sherlock stares into John’s eyes but doesn’t say a word, and John forces himself to stay still and look back. It’s uncomfortable to be examined so closely, but he wants, no, he
Mycroft attempts a few more digs, but Sherlock no longer responds. The bureaucrat stares over his younger brother’s head, eyes intent on John’s hand and mouth shaped like he has swallowed something sour.  John then discovers that this method of quieting Sherlock has the added benefit of making Mycroft uncomfortable enough to make his excuses and leave, and soon the flat is peaceful.
… With that thought, John forces himself to pull back and Sherlock whines at the sudden space between them. His eyes have been shut and he opens them now. They are glassy and unfocused. His lips are swollen and he has love bites on his neck. He looks wrecked
But once he arrived at Hogwarts, he found that simple spells took weeks for him to master. His diction and wand-work were perfect, while the magic slipped away like water. If one in five of his charms actually stuck, he was lucky. He understood the theory behind the magic, the motions and the words, and everyone agreed that when John performed a spell, it should work.
“There you go,” John said softly. “I’m sorry you woke up alone. I should have been here.” He signed heavily. “It’s okay. I found you.”
Plenty of jobs in the wizarding world didn’t require N.E.W.T.S., he told his friends. He had a world of opportunities at his fingertips just being a Hogwarts graduate, he told his professors. He pretended not to notice the pitying looks.
Lestrade had rubbed the area between his eyes for a good thirty seconds, grumbled under his breath, and then taken his handcuffs and muttered, “Go. Just … just go, Sherlock.”
But Mycroft would never forget the look in his brother’s eyes when he had returned. Mycroft’s own lips had stretched into a grateful smile to see the boy awake, but Sherlock’s face was so still that it could have been carved from marble. His eyes, grey and blue and green, were pinched in pain, and they had flickered with an emotion so deep that Mycroft had almost stumbled and fallen. This emotion would disappear just as quickly, and Mycroft never did identify it.
Sighing as though he were terribly put out, Sherlock spoke slowly, as though John was a small child, “To which institution are you hoping to matriculate?”
“You have no idea how long I’ve wanted this,” Victor told him before he surged forward, covering Sherlock’s body with his own.
Victor began to run his tongue along Sherlock’s lower lip, and after a few heartbeats, Sherlock tentatively opened his mouth as well. He had not yet closed his eyes, and so he was free to study Victor’s countenance up-close. Victor’s eyes were closed and his face was relaxed in a mask of bliss. Sherlock’s sharp gaze flitted about, categorizing the twitch of Victor’s right eyebrow, the flare of his nostrils, and the humid breath from Victor’s nose to his own cheek.
“And yet it’s happening,” Lestrade responded cheerfully, pushing the file across his desk so that it rested in front of Sherlock’s right elbow.
John had discovered the mark that morning while brushing his teeth. With eyes wide, he had studied the purplish bruise as toothpaste dripped from his mouth. The mark was safely hidden from unfriendly eyes by the collar of his school shirt. It would fade in a few days, but for now it served as a reminder of the previous night and the beautiful boy with whom he had danced.
He usually left the campus through the main entrance, which was closer to his bus stop, but at the last minute, he decided to go out the side exit near the gymnasium. This route would take him past Sherlock’s favorite place to smoke. John knew this made him a glutton for self-punishment, but he couldn’t stop himself.
Greg looked like he was digesting a complicated bit of maths. “I didn’t think Sherlock Holmes had friends,” he finally said. His tone wasn’t cruel, but it rubbed John the wrong way. He thought of Sherlock’s soft and hesitant smile.
One dark eyebrow arches, but with his eyes still tightly closed, Sherlock’s expression lacks its usual arrogance. “Where are we?” he asks.
Sherlock’s gaze locked on his own. It was a strange and heady sensation to be the sole attention of Sherlock’s focus. His eyes were almost burning in their intensity, and John fought the urge to shudder.
John shrugged and thought of the boxes still piled high in his small bedroom. He thought of the worry lines around his mum’s eyes and the club and Sherlock. He felt his cheeks redden.
John considers how to best explain his methods. He wants to point out the practical utilization of such a discovery, explain that it’s hardly something tawdry - rather it is something remarkable he’s discovered that can calm Sherlock’s raging mind and body.
“That it is,” Mike said, nodding wisely.  He gestured with his thumb.  “Well, here we go. Biology class. Come on.”
John raised his shaking left hand and covered the one that Sherlock had rested against his chest. “I always thought there was something wrong with my magic,” he said. “I thought there was something wrong with
Sherlock leaned forward as well, and for a moment their foreheads touched, but then John saw something flicker across Sherlock’s eyes, and John had a moment to pause and peer more closely into Sherlock’s face before the other man tilted his head, and then their lips were touching.
Pale eyes glared at him.  “If you’re not interested…” The other boy tried to step away, but John refused to let go of his hands.  A small voice in John’s head yelled at him to stop, told him to let this stranger have his wicked way with him, this was new, this was different, this was
The music changed, and a song with a faster tempo began to play. The boy turned again in John’s arms, resting his forearms on John’s shoulders and his forehead against John’s, his long spine curling. John felt surrounded by his body. The boy moved with the music, his hips rolling with the bass, and he took the lead. His unusual eyes locked with John’s and a laconic smile crossed his lips. John wrapped one possessive arm around his waist and rolled his other shoulder back and away.
John came so violently that little sparks of light skirted the borders of his vision. He banged the back of his head against the wall at his back. Tomorrow morning, he’d find a small knot there, which would both embarrass him and turn him on, but in his current state, he felt no pain.
Sherlock’s tongue disappears and his breath catches in his throat. His fingers splay against the headboard.  John moves his hands to Sherlock’s hips and grips them tightly.  He pushes forward slowly, watching himself enter Sherlock’s body, centimeter by centimeter. Sherlock’s thighs are quivering and he’s taking deep breaths, his stomach hollowing, but he’s also pushing back against John, accepting him into his body.
He had survived. He wasn’t sure how. He supposed he was glad he still lived. Sherlock didn’t want to die. Not exactly. It wasn’t quite that he wanted to be alive either, but he was fairly certain he didn’t want to die.
“A moment,” Sherlock said. He set down one bottle, grasped another, and with a soft “aha!” began to tap its contents into the cauldron. He held his wand high and Latin words spilled from his lips like poetry.
John then winced when Harry punched him hard in the shoulder. “John Watson,” she said, her voice suddenly fierce with outrage, “I’ll not have you talking down about yourself. You are just as handsome as the other guys here, and they’d be lucky to shag you!”
John frowned, “Lost it?”  He glanced at Molly and saw that her face had turned red. She caught John’s eye and gave a minute shake, her lips pursed tightly.
And then they were dancing, their lower halves so tightly pressed together that John could feel their jeans rasp. The other boy radiated body heat like a furnace, and John’s veins ignited.
Anderson’s face turned incredulous. “Are you kidding me? You can’t be friends with him. He’s nothing but a
His bed was suddenly pressing against the back of his thighs, and Sherlock wondered if he was supposed to remain standing or if he should sit. Then Victor pushed him, and Sherlock found himself on his back, blinking up at Victor with wide eyes.
John’s failures sat in his chest, forming a thick knot of hurt. He got through his O.W.L.S. on sheer stubbornness, but he didn’t bother to sit for his N.E.W.T.S. He knew that he could never pass the practicals. And so while his classmates studied late into the night, took potions to keep themselves awake, and moaned to each other about how much there was to learn, John kept his own counsel.
“All right?” he asks Sherlock, speaking softly into the dark curls that smell sweet and sour of sex, shampoo, cigarette smoke, and something else underneath, something that’s deeper and darker and just Sherlock.
Sherlock blinked blearily, noticing first that he was in a quiet room, no longer the noisy A&E bay. The sounds of the hospital were muffled - a private room then, with the door closed. The overhead light was dimmed.
There was a sound very much like someone had raced by his head too quickly on a broom. The air in the room shifted.
Yesterday, after slipping away from Mummy during her afternoon tea, he had tried to explore the Bodleian library, but the harridan from the front desk had stopped him. She had turned him around and marched him right back out the front doors.
The third time Sherlock startles himself awake, John reaches over and tugs on his arm. Sherlock is too surprised to fight, and he slumps against John, his right cheek coming to rest on John’s left shoulder. John shifts a bit to relieve the pressure on his bad shoulder and glances down. Sherlock’s eyes are wide, and he’s staring up at John, but he doesn’t move.
John winced. “Okay, fine, yes, I flirted with her. I like to flirt.”  He grabbed Sherlock’s drink so that he could take a fortifying gulp, and then he set the bottle on the ground.  He steadied his shoulders. “But flirting with some pretty girl at a rugby game - that’s just a bit of harmless fun. I don’t feel anything for Sarah Sawyer like what I feel for you.”
The night was cigarette ashes in his mouth, and Sherlock’s clothing was sandpaper against his skin. On the floor of his grey apartment, Sherlock lay limply on his back. He lifted his head and let it drop. He barely felt the pain. Awful boredom had seeped into his bloodstream, and now it raced through his vena cava, to his right atrium, out the right ventricle and into his lungs. Now it was picked up again, pumping through the left heart to invade the rest of his tissues.  Nothing would ever be interesting again.
Harry did have a point, he thought. Tomorrow at 8 AM, he’d be sitting in biology class, surrounded by strangers. The next several months would be filled with prep for his A levels. For now, in this dark room with the thrumming music and flashing lights, he was anonymous - just another body in the club. He could return to being boring tomorrow.
the DI was in over his head. Bradstreet felt differently, of course, and had forbidden Sherlock (or “the obnoxious prick,” as he preferred to call the young detective) from entering the crime scene.
John dropped his hand.  With that movement, Sherlock turned sharply to stare at John. His eyes flickered across John’s face, and John wondered if Sherlock was expecting something from him. He didn’t know what it could be.
With their hips locked together and their breath hot in each other’s faces, John could imagine it was just the two of them on the floor. The other dancers were little more than scenery, an oscillating mass surrounding them and walling them off from the rest of the world. Strobe lights and pounding music added to the sense of unreality. Alcohol buzzing through his blood and into his brain, John felt his entire world shrink to the lithe body in his arms.
“Do you think you could cast a protective shield around this? To contain potential fallout?” Sherlock asked. His voice was neutral, which John appreciated. He wasn’t judging John’s ability (or lack thereof) - he simply needed to know if John could manage the spell.
Molly rested her chin on her fist and looked up at John, her eyes contemplative. “You were looking at him the first day of classes. Do you two know each other?”
Three other boys were with him. Anderson, still wearing his rugby gear, had Sherlock backed up against the brick wall. His forearm was across Sherlock’s upper chest, and he was leaning forward so that his body weight kept Sherlock in place. Two boys that John recognized from around the school were behind him. They weren’t touching Sherlock, but their body language radiated violence.
Sherlock’s face took on an expression John knew quite well - it was the one he made when he thought that John was being particularly dense and he was eager to enumerate the reasons he had come to this conclusion.
Sliding onto the bench next to Sherlock, John reached over to grip Sherlock’s chin. Sherlock’s eyes shot open and he started a little, but he didn’t move away. John directed his chin one way and then the other.
Did Sherlock think about the night at the club? Did he know how often John thought about it.? Even now, snapshots of those memories paraded through John’s brain - the dance, the supply room, the most amazing blowjob of his life... John felt his cheeks turn pink.
“So that’s why you disappeared on us.”  Harry nodded wisely. “It happens. Sometimes the fish gets away.”
Eyes narrowed, John peered closer, trying to identify what was missing. And then he saw it. The spell was solid, but the power just wasn’t there. Sherlock, as clever as he was, didn’t have the sheer might to cast this particular spell.
It feels like forever, but it’s probably only been fifteen minutes when two men maneuver a stretcher into the dank little room. John feels like he can finally take a deep breath. “Over here,” he calls. “I have a 34 year old male status post contusion to the right temple. LOC was approximately twenty minutes. One episode of vomitus, and he’s suffering from vertigo.”
But it wasn’t just his physical beauty, John thought, that had caught his attention. The others on the dance floor danced with the music. This boy
Their shared dance had been a hot and heavy foreplay, and so John knew it wouldn’t take much to push him over the edge. Sherlock could have been awful at blowjobs, the absolute worst, and John was pretty certain he would have still managed to have an orgasm.
Rolling his eyes, John took another sip of his drink. It was the winter holiday, John’s last at Hogwarts, and he was staying on campus like he always did. The castle was empty, but somehow still felt warmer than home, what with a dad who had set aside his wand for a bottle of whiskey and a sister who had never forgiven John for receiving an invitation to Hogwarts when she hadn’t.
Harry cut him off with a dramatic wave of her hand. “I’m not Mum - that’s not going to work on me.” When John opened his mouth to argue, she talked over him. “I may not be future-doctor smart like you, but I’m not
“We’ve got another thirty minutes,” John says and he yawns. “Close your eyes. I’ll wake you when we’re back at Baker Street.”
Sherlock looked doubtful, and John was reminded of what Molly had said - that Sherlock’s deductions had made him rather unpopular.  John understood this. Having the details of his life spit at him from a total stranger with eyes that saw too much was certainly uncomfortable. Sherlock was not polite, and both his tone and bearing lacked humility. His words came at John like a deluge that did not inspire reciprocal conversation.
White teeth flashed in the dim light, and the boy spoke for the first time. “Probably not.”  His voice was deeper than John would have imagined, and John felt his mouth go dry with lust.
John touched the wand in his pocket and tried to shape the magic. Power began to flow from his fingers, pounding through his arteries, and he felt it begin to move… and then it slipped through his fingers.
Sherlock’s grey-green eyes flicker across John’s face, a smile playing at his lips. He is still, as he so rarely is, and he studies John. His lips shape John’s name, but the whisper is too soft for John to hear. John can’t stop himself from reaching out with one hand to run his index finger across Sherlock’s full lower lip. Sherlock’s pink tongue emerges to lick at the pad of his finger, and John groans as he slowly presses his hips forward.
John, who had seen the gruesome dead at the Battle of Hogwarts, who had lost the full dexterity of his wand arm there, and who still sometimes felt an ache that did not exist in his leg, hated every moment of Moriarty’s game.
Sherlock meanwhile began to thumb through an ancient book, one eye still on the smoking potion. He found the page he was searching for, set it down open on the table, and began to root through his jars of supplies.
It works, John thinks giddily, and he can’t contain the grin that takes over his lips.  He glances up, wanting to share his spectacular discovery with someone - Sherlock’s not the only one who can propose a hypothesis and run an experiment after all. He locks eyes with Lestrade, who is staring at the both of them with his mouth gaping like a fish.  John becomes aware of the marked quiet from the Yarders around them.
a dad, John who had friends he’d known since primary school and a steady girlfriend and who furtively snogged James Sholto after rugby practice and hated himself for it … that John never would have guessed that John from today would be in bloody London at a bloody nightclub, a
The air at the pool thrummed with magic and it made John’s bones itch. The hex Moriarity had placed on him, set to explode if John tried to make a run for it, was stifling, almost as much as the compulsion spell that made his mouth form words that weren’t his own.
John searched Sherlock’s profile, trying to see some hint of the boy from the club. Sherlock worked swiftly, his movements graceful but quick. Sometimes John thought he saw something familiar - first when Sherlock licked his plush lower lip, and then when he stretched the graceful arch of his neck.
Sherlock begins to slowly draw his bow back and forth, forcing his violin to emit a ghostly, crying note that lingers on and on. It drills into John’s ear, and he begins to wince.
When the case is over, Sherlock is exuberant. He’s been brilliant, shining brighter than the city lights, and everyone else is the dimmer for not being him, John thinks. Sherlock’s high on his own cleverness, talking a mile a minute to the police chief, and John can’t decide what he wants more: to watch Sherlock be brilliant or watch those around them be blown away by how brilliant his Sherlock is. John has punched three men, two of whom were planning to harm Sherlock, and his knuckles are bruised, but he feels like he could fly.
“Quiet down,” the professor called, his attention more on his own briefcase than the students in front of him. He pulled out a piece of paper and waved it in the air. “We’re going to start with attendance.”
But John’s blue eyes were clear and warm, and they met Sherlock’s own with such clear love that Sherlock’s breath was taken away.
“Sherlock…” he managed to say, his voice little more than a whisper, and Sherlock surged forward.   Their mouths crushed together, Sherlock licking into John’s mouth, and John doing his best to remember to breathe. Their hands continued to move with increasing frenzy across their cocks. John felt a familiar heat build in his groin, and he pulled Sherlock closer. He began to whisper in Sherlock’s mouth - half-spoken promises, ridiculous endearments, and almost prayers.
John had never danced like this before, with a partner who seemed to predict his every move, who didn’t just follow John’s actions, but reciprocated them. It felt like they were one body with two parts, winding around each other. It was categorically the sexiest dance John had ever shared with someone else. A flash of joy spread through John, and he couldn’t stop himself from laughing out loud.
As he entered the room, John heard the click of a pull chain and smelled the sharp tang of cleaning solvent. A single overhead light bulb weakly flared to life and illuminated in dirty yellow light what was clearly a supply closet. There was a mop bucket in one corner, and the back wall supported a rickety set of shelves, filled with toilet paper and cleaning products.
improved when he caught sight of Anderson’s bulbous and bruised nose that morning. But the moment he saw Sherlock’s curly head, John’s nerves began to grow.  What if Sherlock had re-thought his decision to forgive John?
“We’ll have more time later,” Sherlock said between kisses. “We’ll have all the time in the world. Right now, I need you.” He braced himself up on his left forearm, holding his body a few centimeters above John then, not quite touching. John heard him mutter a few words. Suddenly the hand that held both of their cocks was coated in slick.
"It's just..." Greg hesitated, and John saw him look to Molly for help. "I've never seen Sherlock fight like that with someone before.”
A man pulls a knife on Sherlock and holds it to his pale throat, shouting at the surrounding police to back off. Sherlock rolls his eyes and deduces the man’s erectile dysfunction. Things get impossibly more tense - John wouldn’t have thought that possible - but luckily the criminal becomes so enraged that he lets the arm holding the knife drift a bit, so John tackles him from behind. Lestrade spends ten minutes shouting at Sherlock, jabbing one finger into Sherlock’s chest, while John stands off to the side with his hands on his hips, breathing slow and heavy so that his heart will stop trying to pound out of his chest.
The look on Sherlock’s face was indescribable. He was staring at John as though he had never seen him before. He was staring at John Watson as though he were a wonder.
Another dancer, there one moment and gone the next, hip checked John, who stumbled two steps forward, colliding with the dancing boy. Because of their differing heights, John’s forehead bumped into a pointy chin.
This was the other reason John had been so drawn to the Weasley boy. Charlie had never cared if John’s magic obeyed him, only if John could stay atop his broom and beat the bludgers away. He cared about what John could
Sherlock looked away again, frowning fiercely. He bit his lower lip, an oddly hesitant gesture in juxtaposition to his words.  "It's not a big deal," he finally said, his words oddly stilted. "It's not like you were pining for me. Or at least not so much that it would stop you from flirting with Sarah Sawyer."
“What’s wrong?” Molly whispered, making John jump. She was leaning across Mike, her eyes bright with concern. She glanced at Sherlock, frowned, and then stared more intently at John.
When John didn’t look convinced, he let out a heavy sigh, and then began to explain: “No, see, look here…”  With rapid-fire speech, he explained to John why his methodology was superior. When John asked another question, he rolled his eyes so hard that John thought they would fall from his head, but he answered readily enough. Soon his previous reticence evaporated, and he continued a running commentary on the chemical reactions as he worked.
Sighing inwardly, John returned his attention back to Sarah, who was chatting about her older sister. As she spoke, she slowly drifted closer to John’s side. Every few steps, her upper arm would brush John’s.
“What’s up with him?” John frowned at his sandwich and wondered if he was pulling off a nonchalant air. The way his friends were peering at him, he was pretty sure that he wasn’t.
Sherlock nods only once, but it’s decisive. “Okay.” He then surges forward, and his lips clash against John’s.
Harry dropped the pan and water splattered both of their shirts. “What?!” Her voice was shrill. Both siblings froze and looked over their shoulders to verify that their mother wasn’t going to come into the kitchen. Several seconds passed before John felt his heart finally calm down.
It was like standing in the narrow space between two buildings on a windy day. It was like jumping into a fast moving river, finding the current and shooting along with it. It was like flying on a broom with no hands.
Anger began to overtake the uneasiness in John’s stomach. "Oh, so we're acknowledging the club then? We're admitting that we-" he cut himself off and looked around furiously to make sure they were alone "-you know, had sex?"
John fights the urge to throttle Sherlock. He reminds himself that Sherlock is simply overwhelmed. Sherlock isn’t complaining about the hospital blankets because he’s a snob … well, John amends, it’s not
So Mycroft made the decision to run for help. He arrived at a nearby road within minutes and was able to return to his brother’s side within the quarter hour, this time followed by a good Samaritan who had been out for a Saturday drive.
Molly dropped her giant pink backpack on an open table and then turned to look between Mike and John.  “Maybe he’ll let us work as a group of three...”
The sensation was exquisite. John felt his back arch off the bed. “Sherlock,” he managed to choke out, “I want this to last but if you keep doing that-” He gasped, words catching in his throat as Sherlock’s large hand moved up and down.
I don’t desire you despite those things, Sherlock.” He ducks his head so that Sherlock is forced to meet his eyes. “Yes, you can be arrogant and sometimes you are a bit of an arse. But you are also amazing and a genius and you care so much - no, don’t argue with me. I may not be a genius, but I can see that, Sherlock.  I am feeling very fortunate that you want
Sherlock muttered something, and Anderson snarled in response. With his free hand, he reached up to smack Sherlock’s forehead. The back of Sherlock’s head connected with the brick wall with an ugly thunk. Sherlock made a soft sound. A cold fury swept through John, and for a moment he felt paralyzed with rage.
the music. He moved like the music was in his veins, his hips swiveling and turning with a grace that John would never come close to emulating.
Unmoving on John’s lap, Sherlock groans. “John, really, you’re being unreasonable. I simply require some rest.” He raises his voice. “Lestrade, we shall be returning to 221B, of course, provided my instructions were not so complicated that your lot allowed the counterfeiters to escape.”
They slipped through the door and entered a long hallway that contained a handful of closed doors. The music was still pounding, although softer than before.
John groaned and resisted the urge to pull at his hair. "What's that supposed to mean? You’re saying that what we did meant nothing in one breath, and in the next you’re acting like a jealous tit!”
dancing. He wasn’t a skilled dancer. He didn’t know a waltz from a fox trot, and he had spent more than one school dance rocking back and forth blandly with a girl under the watchful eyes of his teachers. But the type of dancing this club encouraged - thrusting hips, movement that was just a little less than sex,
Why had Sherlock looked so angry? Why had he even come to the game to begin with, only to rush away like that?
Sherlock knew he was beautiful. He had no interest in the plebian mating rituals of his classmates - not the public hand-holding in restaurants, nor the private fellatio in the dusky corners of the university. But objectively, he knew that others found him striking. He knew he turned the heads of men and women alike, and he knew that this was because of the graceful line of his neck, the set of his blue-green eyes, the sharpness of his cheekbones.
“Yes,” Sherlock nodded, gesturing in a way that suggested get-on-with-it. “From Chelmsford. Moved here this summer after your parent’s divorce.”  His teeth clashed as he closed his mouth forcefully, as though stopping himself from speaking further.
“Our first game is this Friday,” John announced as he sat down next to Sherlock on Wednesday morning.  “Rugby, I mean.”
Bradstreet then called for quiet, and John smiled to himself, something warm growing in his stomach.
Quite suddenly, Sherlock squared his shoulders and spun in place. Suddenly he was crowding into John’s space. His face was no more open, but it was so close to John’s own that John could see a small spot of brown in the right iris of Sherlock’s otherwise pale eyes.
John hissed in frustration. “Shit!” He jogged down the hallway and burst through the door, remerging into a world of music and moving bodies and heat. This assaulted his senses like a physical force, and the strobe lights exploded against his retinas.
The roaring in his ears was so loud he worried that his eardrums would rupture. John’s body was singing. He didn't think about trying to control the magic - he let it run through him, and he felt like a bottomless well. The power was unending.  It flowed into him, pumping through his veins and flowing through muscle and fat and blood, and then it moved on, beating in time with his heart, out of his body and away ..
Something deep in Sherlock’s gut turned over and squeezed. He slowly curled into the fetal position, an animal protecting its soft underbelly.
John snuck a look at Mike, but he was looking away, an uncharacteristic frown on his open, friendly face.
John looked up. Greg was standing a few feet away, his lunch tray in his hands. He shifted on his feet uncomfortably. "We were going to join you, but it looked like you and Sherlock were having a pretty intense conversation." Molly stood behind him, her brown eyes wide with concern.
“I’m glad we’re here,” John says. “Not in Glasgow, I mean, or even in this bed. I just mean I’m glad you and me - we’re finally here. Together.”
By Sunday, John’s mum complained to him over dinner: “I don’t know where your head has been this weekend.”
Worried about spinal cord injuries, and knowing that time was of the essence, Mycroft had considered his options. He could wait with his brother another moment or so and see if he awoke up. Or he could run - Oxford shoes be damned - as fast as his portly body would allow. Mycroft hated to run, hated the way it made his stomach sway and his cheeks turn bright pink. He knew the other boys at Eton whispered “piggy” behind his back when they saw him run. Those words hurt him deeply even if he never let anyone know.
magic - he knew it deep in his bones. He didn’t know the exact nature of the potion Sherlock was mixing, but he could see the barebones of the spell within it, clear as though it had been written in a glowing script from a quill.
For the first time since Romania, John felt like he was truly living. He didn’t get enough sleep, and he rarely got to actually finish a meal before Sherlock pulled him away for an errand. He was on first-name basis with several vampires, and even more Aurors.
Touched, and more than a little startled by his sister’s savage affection, John took a deep breath. He snagged his half empty beer bottle and chugged the rest of it. The alcohol hit his stomach, and he felt the chemicals explode through his chest and down his arms and legs. Maybe on any other given day he was average. But tonight, in this dark club, he could be whatever he wanted to be.
me?” If his voice hit a particularly high (and painful) note at the end, Sherlock would not admit that in the future.
clever-” John rolled his eyes, even knowing Sherlock couldn’t see the expression. “But you’re hardly stupid either. You should have been able to memorize the spells and wand motions. And you are almost overflowing with magic - it’s quite loud when you walk into the room. Your skin almost pulses with it.”
The current song began to fade out, and a new one began. John didn’t recognize the tune, but he knew it must be something popular - the crowd cheered and began to dance with a rejuvenated vigor. Bodies spun around bodies. Spotlights attached to the ceiling roved across the crowd, painting the dancers with color and light.
They don’t speak. Sherlock finishes his cigarette, and he stubs the end on the sill before flicking it to the street below. John doesn’t chastise him, and Sherlock doesn’t light another.  It’s another twenty minutes before Sherlock sighs, deep and heavy. His face is still as marble and there is nothing gentle about his lips or eyes. But his shoulders are a little less tense and John knows he’s touchable now. He reaches out and gently strokes Sherlock’s hair, flicking the fringe from his forehead, and then running his palm over the back of Sherlock’s neck.
This time, Sherlock smiled outright. He peered at John from the corner of his eyes and his gaze swept from John’s head to his feet. He muttered a few words under his breath. The wetness of John’s robes evaporated, and although the rain still fell, it did not stick to his hair or clothing. He felt toasty and dry.
Slowly, knowing that if he moved too quickly his head would throb off of his neck and roll away, never to be seen again, Sherlock looked towards his right and then his left. He had to close his eyes, for the sight of his wrist bent at such an unnatural angle was genuinely disturbing. Making sure to keep his face skyward, he opened his eyes again.
Sherlock didn’t move, and John began to get nervous, wondering if he had pushed too far. Then Sherlock blinked and slowly picked up his mobile again. He hunkered over the device.  John felt his heart drop.
Sherlock’s face could have been carved from marble, it was so cold. His eyes, always intense and penetrating, bore into John’s with a fervency that was almost painful. John felt caught in their beam.  Deep emotions, fury and betrayal, radiated from Sherlock and slammed into John like a hammer to his chest.
Sherlock was reading through his textbook - no, John thought, he was correcting the textbook. He held a red pen in his long fingers, periodically marking up chemical equations.
Sherlock grabbed John’s tee in tight fists, his fingers tangling in the cloth. Delighted, John chuckled and then proceeded to work Sherlock with sure and steady strokes, twisting his wrist every few tugs, and circling his thumb around the glans.
Mycroft had watched his little brother fall with an overwhelming sense of helpless fury. He had dropped his book and taken a single step forward when he heard the crack of the branch. In the time it took him to perform these two actions, Sherlock had hit two other branches coming down, breaking his wrist so badly that surgical pins would be necessary to reset the bones, and then landed in a limp heap five feet from where his horrified older brother stood.
When he got home that evening, the flat was empty. There was a note on the fridge in his mum’s neat handwriting: “Called in for an extra shift. Leftovers in fridge”
Harry let out a dramatic groan and slowly slumped across their small table.  “If you leave it up to him,” she said mournfully, “then he’ll still be sitting here tomorrow morning.” She gave John a beseeching look. “Come on, Johnny. One last night. One last chance to pull. You can do it. You can go back to being boring tomorrow.”
“Look, mate, you can’t keep doing this. I don’t know how you find out about these cases, but it’s not your job, you see? Why don’t you let us handle this?”
John began to gently move his hand and Sherlock followed his lead.  The smooth play of skin against skin, frenulum brushing against frenulum, made something in John’s brain skitter and go offline. His eyes drifted shut.
The sun was still there, as was the warm summer breeze, and he thought probably the goshawk was still there as well. But otherwise he was alone. And no matter how much he liked to think himself beyond silly childhood trivialities - he couldn’t even remember the last time he had cried, and had he ever believed in Father Christmas, the great imposter? - he was caught in an intense wave of fear and cresting panic.  He had fallen, he had been knocked unconscious, he had clearly hit his head, his wrist was broken,
John’s fingers closed around Sherlock’s wrist and his magic, which had been riotous only a moment before, grew still. Then it surged, as though fleeing from John, and although John’s attention was entirely on the cauldron before him, for a moment - just a moment - it felt like his magic was moving
The lady nodded and sank into an armchair with a great sigh. “Thank you, sir, I’m heartened to hear it, it’s been a most unpleasant –”
And   so there John sat, in the darkened poker arena with two-hundred or so   other spectators, family members, and real-time bloggers, watching in   disbelief as Sherlock held his own against four other men -
John snorted into his drink, but finished it quickly and then left   to go back to the room.  It was probably as close as Sherlock would  ever  come to acknowledging the reason for John's departure, and John  hoped that to be the end of it.
Sherlock   swung one impossibly long leg over John's, straddling his thighs.    John's hands automatically went to rest just above Sherlock's bony   knees.  Sherlock leaned forward and planted one hand next to John's   head, the other smoothed over John's arm.  There was a moment when they   held eye contact, and then Sherlock finally dipped his head and kissed   John.
So   when the case that had brought them to Las Vegas in the first place  turned out to be centred on a high-stakes Texas Hold 'em  tournament,  John thought Sherlock would have finally observed  enough to realize  that it wasn't all just luck and manipulation.   They both entered the  first round (a $25k buy-in, bankrolled by the  casino; that was  only a fraction of what they'd stand to lose  if the media ever got wind  of the fact that such a high-profile game  had been thrown) with  fabricated identities to find the parties  involved.  Sherlock read a  quick primer on the basic rules of the  game and watched a few hours of  Final Table footage from a few World  Series tournaments, declining  John's offer of playing a couple practice  hands (which hurt, if John  were completely honest, as did all the  other times Sherlock had deemed  John's various skills wanting) in  preparation, and away he went.
"And   who says I'll be cheating?" Sherlock asked with a smirk.  He   plucked the sunglasses from where they'd been resting on top of his head   and slipped them onto John's face.  One of the cameramen moved closer,   his curiosity piqued by Sherlock's actions.
John's   brain was by then fully engaged in all things sexual.  "That's fine, I   can work with that."  For someone John had thought of as asexual just   the day before, Sherlock was turning out to be full of surprises.
John   had long known Sherlock didn't hold anything sacred and that he   certainly didn't respect other people's privacy.  He'd probably long-ago   deduced the depth and breadth of John's sexual experience and   assumed John amenable to playing along -- after all, it's not like a   threesome with another bloke was something John hadn't ever done.
Sherlock chuckled.  "I've dressed up as a woman before, more than once.  I didn't lack for attention."
Sherlock raged at that, not understanding how it could have happened.  John   was sure that if the case had already been solved, the man would have   entered into an epic sulk in their hotel room.  As it stood, John was left in their room with a stack of files and discs containing   security camera footage to vet the rest of the suspects based on   movement and interaction with the other players and casino staff.  It   was tedious work, even for him, but he was able to make a connection   between a security guard and one of the floormen as a source for the   marked cards, so it wasn't all for naught.
For   the next round, Sherlock made John keep the sunglasses on.  John   had always been a purist when playing - no good luck charms, no rituals,   no hats, no hoodies, no sunglasses.  Just
John   wasn't in the business of lying to himself, not in the past, and not   then.  He'd harboured strong feelings for Sherlock practically from the   first day he met the man, and those feelings had grown into something   he didn't want to admit the depth of to himself, mostly because   Sherlock was
John   could feel the mood shift to something headier, more serious.  They   were doing this.  It had been a long time coming and now it was actually   happening.  Neither had mentioned love, but the intense, reverent look   on Sherlock's face said more than any number of declarations could.
Sherlock   walked out of the bathroom stark naked, still towel-drying his hair.    "You may as well have a lie-in.  I've got a few things to wrap up with   the head of security, and I've been told they want me to give some   god-awful soundbite about losing gracefully for the highlight reel.  I'm   tempted to tell them I lost on purpose because I was tired of waiting   to shag my flatmate."  He tossed his wet towel onto the bed and  rummaged  through his suitcase for clean pants.
With   Sherlock's clarification, John's ardour dampened slightly.  He didn't   want to admit that he'd been half-infatuated with the man from the   moment he'd realized Sherlock had cured his limp, especially when he'd   been under the impression the feeling wasn't reciprocated.  Hell, it   might not have been until a few hours ago, which raised a whole other   set of questions and possible complications that John didn't want to   dwell on.  Being secretly in love with his flatmate for the last year   seemed like some kind of betrayal of trust, and also quite pathetic.
"Yes.    Good to know you're amenable to accommodating any proclivities I  might  have, though," Sherlock said with dry amusement as John levered  himself  up and away.  Sherlock toed of his insanely expensive shoes and  they  each hit the floor with a thunk.
Sherlock   buried one hand in his hair and rested the other on his hip, elbow   akimbo.  He stalked to one wall, then turned sharply.    "So sometime after you'd consummated the relationship with Sarah, but   before--"
Sherlock   lounged back against the table looking well-pleased.  His voice held a   hint of amusement when he asked,  "So you're admitting luck is an   important factor in poker?"
John   set about unbuttoning Sherlock's shirt, kissing a trail from the  hollow  of Sherlock's throat to just below his sternum.  He pulled the  shirt  fully free of Sherlock's trousers, then slid his hands up over  miles of  pale skin.  He'd seen Sherlock in various states of undress  before, but  he'd never let himself actually look.  He traced defined  muscles,  dragging his fingers down through sparse chest hair and up  again over  Sherlock's collarbones, his touch light enough to make the  man  underneath him shiver.
Sherlock   shook hands with Roylott - who was already out of his chair and  jumping  around like a football hooligan - and made his way through the  swarming  crowd to John, a smile on his face.
John let out a whoop and punched the air.  Sherlock's mouth twitched up into a tiny smile as he raked the pot toward himself.
If   you were to ask Sherlock how he ended up at the final table in a   high-stakes, no-limit Texas Hold 'em tournament being filmed for   broadcast on American television, he would simply wave you off and tell   you it was for a case.  If you were to ask John, he'd tell you it was   because his flatmate was an ego-maniacal twat that would go to almost   any length to prove a point.
The   hand on John's jaw migrated to his chest.  Sherlock used it to gently   push John back, then he shrugged out of his shirt and threw it  somewhere  in the vicinity of the foot of the bed.  He leaned forward  and his deft  fingers made short work of the buttons on John's shirt.   "Cuffs," he  said.
Sherlock   hummed in assent.  "A few.  You've never had sex with a man before   without a woman being the focus of the encounter."  He skimmed his   fingernails lightly up John's sides.
"I   did," Sherlock said, beginning to dress.  "Roylott tongues the inside   of his teeth when he's got risky hand and contemplating a bluff, and  his  nostrils flare when he's confident the odds are in his favour.  I  knew  before I went all-in that he had the winning hand.  I could have  dragged  the game out for hours, had I wanted to."
“My dear John, I’m afraid our job isn’t yet done.” Holmes said, holding my webbed fingers against his. “We have an eldritch abomination to exorcise and a photograph to retrieve. The game is still afoot.”
Ms Talbot leaned forward, and I tried to keep my voice steady. “Your Gina and you are meant to be married soon, aren’t you? She told me you’ve been working ever so hard to plan it all, she sounded so proud.”
Since I was still cradling her head, she did not fall to the ground, and I was able to manoeuvre her onto one of the less bloody divans with little difficulty. From there, I took the least filthy throw blanket and covered her naked body. It was the most dignity I could offer her under the circumstances.
“Sherlock –” I yelled, or at least I tried, for it seemed as though the ocean wind was robbing my lungs of the air I needed to call for him. I tried again, my gills fluttering helplessly, but I could make no sound. I pounded my webbed hands against the sand in desperation, trying to alert my friend.
As we stumbled along, I turned back to look at Holmes, but instead I saw the creature, straight as an arrow, pelting towards us. It was still bridled in chalk, but the muzzle keeping that many-layered, many-fanged mouth at bay was gone. It was clear that there would be no surviving its bite.
Mrs Hudson shook her head. “I’m afraid she didn’t say anything specific. She was in a quite a state of agitation and kept repeating that she needed your help.”
There are few things more painful than watching someone dear in pain and knowing there is nothing you can do to help them.
I saw the scales marring my face, the fins jutting out over my ears and under my hair. I saw the malformed slits of my gills peeking out from my shirt collar. I saw the way my own eyes bulged slightly, and I watched, horrified, as a transparent eyelid slid across my distended pupils.
We stayed sitting in silence, watching the dark street outside slowly wash itself clean of night as weak sunbeams slinked across the bricks and flagstones. We must have sat for eons, with no companions save our tea and each other, before our landlady knocked at the sitting room door.
It came first through my leg, a sucking, grasping presence that pulsed in time with my heart’s throbbing, but once it had its hooks in me, it dragged itself throughout my body, diving into my veins, sloshing into my flesh. It pushed the fins it had once given me through my skin, dragged up my forgotten scales, sliced at my neck until gills grew in. I felt the newly grown webbing between my fingers brush against Holmes’ skin, cold against his warm flesh.
Holmes still hadn’t moved by the time I returned with the tea, but he did not protest as I removed his hands from beneath the blanket and wrapped his cold fingers around the teacup. It was only when I took my own teacup and sat beside him that he finally turned to face me and stared.
I tugged at Holmes’ sleeve and informed him of this news, in a soft whisper as to avoid detection, and watched as those incredible eyes narrowed and his mouth grew sharp. A moment later, his wide-eyed look of innocence had returned and he was smiling sheepishly at our hosts.
“They found his body yesterday. He’s the first one we’ve found, and his throat was ripped out, like it was bitten, and his skin had these horrible lines slashed into it and –”
Holmes spent the meal staring at me with those incredible, unworldly eyes, forcing me to watch my own tiny reflection morosely finish off a bowl of soup as he shredded his bread roll.
I had been doing my utmost to alleviate his suffering through little actions, by leaving interesting newspaper articles in his path, by making sure he had enough chemicals to experiment with, and even by spending some of my paltry funds on some sheet music.
A small laugh escaped my lips, and Holmes’ arms tightened around me, gently rocking us back and forth. “But that was of little import,” he said. “Just as obvious as the ocean’s marks was your nature, clear as day.”
Holmes shrugged. “It doesn’t matter overmuch. We can still banish it if it’s upset, it’ll just mean more running and hiding on our part.”
They turned to us, and that mathematical growl reverberated from their chest, rippling the pool of blood around them.
“If there is no other choice…” he said. The words came out with perfect diction, as though each were selected by hand. “I will take Ms Talbot, and you must find the photograph.”
“It is our duty to ensure that no further harm comes to Ms Talbot, both physically and emotionally.” I reasoned. “We can return after we have ensured her future care.”
Holmes laughed, but I recognised the knife-like slant to his smile. “I daresay most people wouldn’t chance wandering these woods, the trail is rather demanding. That doesn’t seem to be an issue for you, though.” Holmes gestured at the stuffed deer hanging on the wall. “Your pursuits must demand some time spent outside.”
Holmes shook his head. “That photograph will only grow more potent the longer it goes unchecked. It must be recovered as soon as possible.”
“Before you castigate me, my dear Watson,” he said, “I will ask you to recall what I said over lunch. I have no intention of perishing here, so I doubt gravity would dare do me such a grave discourtesy.”
We avoided the front door, instead seeking out less obvious points of entry. The servant’s door we eventually uncovered was locked, but Holmes miraculously still had his lockpicks on hand, so it presented no obstacle. The servants’ quarters beyond were likewise simple to navigate, as they were empty save for heaps of dust.
Holmes kicked a leg over the arm of the chair. “Most useful. Now, secondly, why have you come to us for help? Are my friend’s stories so compelling that you would trust an unlicensed layabout?”
“And I was not merely climbing for the sake of the view. I did find this,” he said, and pulled from his pocket a blue handkerchief. “If you will recall, it is the near twin of the one Ms Conliffe used earlier in our sitting room. I have reason to believe that her brother tried to escape up the tree, but was caught regardless.”
I obeyed his directions, and once I was positioned at the back of the pantry, Holmes joined me, one hand on the doorknob and the other holding the now soap-covered broom. The moment I realised his aim, he had already raised his arm, and it was too late to stop him.
“I’m so sorry I forgot to inform you,” Holmes said, “but I’m afraid my companion cannot eat meat. It’s a medical problem, you see. I do apologise for not mentioning it earlier.”
Holmes waved his hand imperiously. “Certainly, we will do our best to aid you, but first I must insist on both proper introductions and a proper cup of tea.”
“You have two minutes to get a head start,” one of the Hambleton sons said. “You’d better start running. Don’t worry, we’ll keep track of where you end up.”
“Janet is not the kind of woman to run off,” Ms Conliffe said, “she has more self-control than anyone I know, and she wouldn’t let her baser impulses overtake her.”
But inevitably, each one met the same fate, and I could not put down the photograph. I could not look away.
The bedroom door slammed, and Mrs Hudson and I shared a look of fond exasperation before I made my own journey to the spare bedroom. The fiction of our separate sleeping arrangements is thin as the paper on which I write this. However, the military demands that men such as I can not marry, propriety demands than only married couples share a bedchamber, and so the lie of the spare bedroom was necessitated.
“A client?” Holmes said. His tone was a far cry from his monotone words earlier. “Give us a moment to dress, Mrs Hudson, and then send her along.” Holmes was off the window seat and halfway across the sitting room before I could react. “And send your wife up with some more tea for our guest, we seem to have run out.”
I wouldn’t be much of a detective if I couldn’t figure out your feelings for me, but it seems that we must work on your deductive reasoning, my dearest, for if you can’t tell that I love you as well, then I’m afraid you’re something of a lost cause.
The ocean withdrew briefly, then surged forward in a swell that landed just shy of our resting place.
It was human at the base, or rather humanoid, for it had four limbs and a head. These limbs were long and rangy, covered in sparse tufts of thick fur, whereas the head had a full set of locks, though this hair stuck out at strange angles. It was muzzled not with iron or steel, but rather floating circles of chalk, which swirled in lazy cycles and pressed into the creature’s face, forcing open its mouth and revealing numerous rows of sharp fangs.
When Holmes slowly hauled himself to his feet, I attempted to do the same and found that I couldn’t move. Looking back, I saw the waves clinging to my legs, dragging at me, beckoning me back towards the deep, trying to pull me out with the receding tide.
“Well, my dear Watson,” Holmes said, his face breaking out in a grin, “it seems we have a new case.”
The door was opened by a young man just as stolid as the house and with red hair that rivalled the brickwork. Surprisingly, he wore a gentleman’s suit, rather than the clothing I would expect of a butler or servant.
Then she swapped out the photo plates and removed the lens cap before leaving the room. There were no sounds left in her wake save for Holmes’ ragged breathing, so when a noise emerged from the hall, there was no pretending I hadn’t heard it.
“Dearest, I have always known what you are.” Holmes said. “I knew it from the moment I first laid eyes on you. You were not so long gone from the ocean’s clutches that I could not see its marks on you.”
With Holmes' hand in mine, we sprinted across the lawns towards the cliffs. This must have been the path that the previous victims ran, but in my panicked state I could think of no better place to go.
I could not compromise our concealment by shouting my surprise, but my expression must have conveyed just how shocked I was because Holmes brought a fist to his mouth, only barely concealing a grin.
Holmes was silent. His eyes closed, and his mouth pressed into a frown that dragged the rest of his face into it. I was about to ask what the matter was, but his eyes opened and fixed on me with an intensity that almost frightened me.
Perhaps I should have realised it earlier, but the photograph did not depict Holmes’ terrified face, but rather him standing at the Hambleton’s dinner table. But now he was moving, pushed back by the monochrome image of Mr Hambleton, who wrapped his hands around Holmes’ neck and squeezed.
Perhaps noting my silent panic, Holmes leaned back in his chair and sniffed. “I don’t see what that has to do with us.”
The water churned, and the desperate pleas of the waves grasped at me, trying, trying to drag me back, they wanted me back, they wanted me so badly.
We were forced to stop there, just barely out of the water, for our strength had deserted us after our last fight against the sea.
Eventually, the cliffs grew less steep, tapering off into a low rocky beach. As we swam closer the ocean’s song surged around us, louder, more cloying, more desperate to keep me within the confines of its water. When my webbed feet first touched the rocks sloping up to land the undertow wrenched at me, but Holmes set his own feet down and with the two of us pushing, we managed to crawl to the tip of the shoreline.
“It has everything to do with you two.” Mr Hambleton said, “Nobody is willing to perform the experiments necessary to uncover the mysteries of our world, so I am afraid I must enlist your help in this grand project of mine. I can promise you, it is a noble calling.”
The Hambleton’s parlour was not a handsome sight, for it had the singular effect of forcing its multitudinous trinkets into your vision with no regard for reason or decency. It was a mess of hunting trophies, framed photographs, and glass figurines that assaulted the senses and quite disguised the fact that there were people located somewhere in the disarray.
When you inevitably read over this script of yours, please do let me know when you reach this endnote. I should very much like to tell you how unobservant you are, and kiss you as you so rightly deserve.
“Surely there is something we can do to calm it.” I said. “If what you say is true and those lines aren’t here on their own volition, then shouldn’t we permit them some measure of respect?”
I looked back at that gruesome photograph just in time to watch Holmes dash himself on the rocks of the beach, coating them with his blood. Holmes, the real Holmes, placed his fingers under my chin and moved my head so I could no longer see it.
The chalk muzzle stretched as the creature strained forward, and though I could not tear my eyes from the atrocity being committed before me, I was suddenly aware that I was no longer pinned to the ground.
Ms Conliffe’s voice cracked, and she covered her face with a blue handkerchief. I leaned forward to pour her another cup of tea, and when I lightly pressed her shoulder, she took the glass from my hand in silence.
After mere seconds, I turned away, unable to bear its distorted appearance, and instead found Holmes standing by one of the utensil-cluttered tables, leafing through a thick tome.
“Yes, my dear fellow. There was a human somewhere in there, but those lines are not of this world. I fear that they might do some great harm if they are not returned to their place of origin.” Holmes’ shoulders slumped, and he closed his eyes. “Just like that photograph of me will certainly do some great harm if it isn’t burned.”
Holmes looked at me, and in his eyes I saw myself reflected, with scales covering my face like freckles and fins sticking out from behind my ears. But though all I could see was my own monstrous appearance, Holmes must have seen something else, for he sighed and waved his hand lazily.
“I am sure I told you over lunch,” he said, “that I sincerely doubted there was anything here that could harm me, and that was no hubris on my part. I know for a fact that I cannot be harmed here, nor back home in the city, nor at sea.” He looked down, presumably towards the photograph. “I have paid for that assurance dearly.”
Holmes’ diversionary tactic moved the conversation away from me, for which I was grateful, but did necessitate listening to an explanation of the local hunting scene that seemed to last for an eternity. By the time Mrs Hambleton announced that supper was ready, I would have accepted any excuse to flee.
Eventually, silence descended. It was more terrifying than any noise could have been, but not nearly as terrifying as those first steps out of the pantry.
“That was already obvious from the grass,” Holmes replied. “If you will look closely, you can see the scorching follows a pattern.” He placed his arm around my shoulders and leaned in close, directing my gaze with his hand. “See how the lines moves as one? They avoid the trunks, and only move at right angles. The only exception is at this very tree, which is the only one growing straight up.”
The broom swished through the air, wiping away the chalk muzzle and slicing through the spiral on the floor. Holmes dropped the broom and closed the door immediately, but not before I saw the lines on Ms Talbot’s body leap forward, dragging the rest of her behind.
I will begin with the facts I know. I was once a ship’s surgeon. I was very skilled at my job. I assisted all those who needed my services, and in doing so touched the lives of nearly every sailor I encountered. It was through this that I unwittingly became a locus, a fixed point upon which the powers of life and death circled, and as I continued my work, saving patients and failing them, this cycle transformed me, just barely, into something occult.
“A good guess,” said Mrs Hambleton. She must have left the room during our altercation, for she had in her hands a covered box that was not previously present. “But not accurate at the moment. First we must have recordings, for the sake of posterity. First,” she said, removing the covering with a flourish, “we must have photographs.”
Mr Hambleton smiled at me with a mouth full of straight, white teeth. “I’m afraid that your friend is not the only one to forget to disclose certain information. For you see, I am something of amateur occultist.”
She went on to explain that the second disappearance was of a local miner, the third a milliner, the fourth a carpenter, all deeply entrenched in the community, and all gone without a trace.
The Hambletons had already taken their seats, leaving the two of us no choice but to join them. The rich, oily smell of cooked human only got stronger as Mrs Hambleton removed the cloche at the table’s centre, revealing a glazed cut of meat.
“Don’t you find me repellent?” I could not conceal the tremor in my voice. “Now that you know what I am, you should be running for the hills.”
“Oh thank you ever so much,” Holmes simpered, “I was afraid we’d be stuck wandering the forest for years.”
“But right now, you can’t get married, and you can’t run free.” I said, “This place isn’t good for either of you. Neither of you deserve to be trapped like this, and we want to help you.” I swallowed around the growing lump in my throat. “Please let us help you.”
The woman introduced herself as Gina Conliffe, an antique dealer from a small town near the sea. The reason for her visit was a spat of mysterious disappearances, beginning with her fiancé, a local woodcutter by the name of Janet Talbot.
It was not less disturbing at rest than it was in motion. The chalk muzzle swirled in lazy cycles, pressing into its flesh with grating precision, and the lines speeding up and down the body forced its form into a horrific half-state of flat angles and rounded depth. The only barrier between it and us was a twisting circle of chalk on the ground, a great spiral that looped in on itself in ever smaller turns, with the beast pinned to its centre.
The Hambleton’s parlour, once a mess of hunting trophies, framed photographs, and other such knickknacks, was now more akin to an abattoir. Viscera coated the better part of the room, and the carpet was sodden with blood, resting in pools broken up by the occasional chunk of unrecognizable human flesh.
“Ah yes, hunting is a passion of mine, you see, it is a most engaging pursuit for the country gentleman…”
In the close confines of the pantry, the dark presented us no other option than to listen. We had no choice but to hear the Hambleton’s laughter turn to screams, hear the loud, wet slap of torn flesh turning into meat, hear the echoing crunch of bone becoming shards.
I had no plans. I had spoken from my heart in the kitchen, and but I truly had no idea what to do, and it dawned on me that my failure to do so might just result in our deaths.
I thought I was dead, but the ocean had other plans for me. Even as it broke me down, it changed me, made me its own. I would have stayed there, lost in the pressing void, if not for the timely intervention of a fishing net, which scooped me up, sailed back to land, and dumped me at the navy’s doorstep, set to be court martialled.
“We certainly don’t want that,” Holmes said, “the police are wont to mess with everything they touch, I find.” He flicked his hand to the side. “If this is the case, miss, you have the two of us at your disposal, and we will do everything in our power to resolve this awful situation.”
And so now I must return to my original tale, to the moment when I breached the churning ocean water for the first time in eleven years, with no protection save Holmes’ hand in mine. When he and I plunged into the waves, subsumed in an instant by the bitter water, I realised that the depths had never forgotten me, and that they wanted me back.
“Well, that’s a shame,” Mrs Hambleton said with a sniff. “I suppose the rest of us will just have to eat more to make up for it.”
The cliffs were approaching. The beast was bearing down on us. Below, the waves crashed, and I could hear them calling, offering escape. And in that moment, with Holmes half-conscious beside me and a monster behind me, the choice was clear.
And then I was gone, ripped from my ship, torn out into the storm and under the waves, dragged downwards until my lungs were crushed and my bones broken, until I wasn’t a man anymore, but rather something forgotten, something distant and faint.
“You previously deferred to me in my handling of the chalk circle,” he said, “I suppose I must return the favour now.”
When I was sure no further collapsing was to occur, I glanced over and saw how wet he was, saw the brine stuck in his hair and his clothes sodden around him. But what was truly concerning in that initial glance was his paleness. Holmes rarely has any colour in his face, but in this moment he was so white as to be faintly luminous.
But more pressing is what Ms Talbot’s impending nuptials brings to my own mind. Namely, what force might compel two people to spend the whole of their lives together.
I met his gaze, and for once, I could see past the reflection of his irises. Whether it was the strange magic of the photograph or his choice to be vulnerable before me, I do not know. What I do know is, in that endless moment, I saw him.
And so I write this as I have written every story about Sherlock Holmes: as a love letter. As a confession. As a gift to you, the most incredible person I have ever had the honour of knowing. I know now that you can never see yourself in a photograph, so I hope here to record you here in all your glory, with all your foibles, showing you all the ways in which you shine in my eyes.
How can I describe the feeling? The body was warm and hairy, but occasionally the lines crossed under my fingers, bearing the shocking chill of uniformity. The constant shifting between depth and flatness was vaguely nauseating, but I kept my hold gentle as Holmes approached, tome in hand, and began to chant.
It was late at night by the time we reached the Hambleton estate once more, and this time our approach was far more stealthy. I’m afraid that both my aching leg and my webbed feet slowed our progress, but by the time we had crept up to the servant’s door, my more obtrusive fins had receded beneath my flesh, and Holmes was no longer quite so deathly pale.
Ms Conliffe looked off to the side, before she slowly said, “The local woodcutters found him by the cliffs, right along the edge. There aren’t any houses near there except for the Hambleton estate, but even that’s a ways off from where he was discovered.”
I have seen Sherlock Holmes face down armed cultists, pacify enraged monsters, exorcise lingering spirits, and punch a police officer in the nose. He approached every challenge with a devil-may-care nonchalance that has vexed me for years, but has always reassured me, in my heart of hearts, that he could look after himself, and that he could face any problem and come out the victor.
“I’m sorry to have neglected you, dear visitor, I meant no slight by it. I’m not sure if you know what a wedding is, but Ms Talbot, the woman you’re inhabiting, is planning one.” I wracked my mind for any way to explain this to something so alien. “I suppose for you it must be like a set of parallel lines. I wonder, how do they choose to travel together, never touching but always close? That must involve a lot of planning too.”
The train ride out to the country was uneventful, and I must admit I spent most of it catching up on the sleep I had missed this morning. Our journey to the coroner’s office and inquiries about missing individuals were likewise standard, but that is not the reason I am omitting them now. At the time, I was distracted by the proximity of the ocean. Though the town was situated inland from the white, chalky cliffs, I could still hear the waves pounding against rock if I closed my eyes and focused.
I find myself able, at long last, to express those words I have hidden away for fear that they would be unwelcome. I can face that beast that stalks me. I can name that nameless thing that touches my every interaction, our every interaction, and exorcise my doubts.
We were silent until we reached the lawn, and then Holmes leaned against me, resting his head on my shoulder, which, I only now realised, felt clear of scales.
The two of us remained silent as Holmes lit the fire, as the photograph crumbled and burned in the flames until it was nothing more than ash. We stayed silent as we trailed the oil past the kitchen’s flagstones and onto the wood beyond. We stayed silent as the house slowly caught on fire and the two of us departed the same way we had arrived.
I will do my utmost to describe the creature which crawled into the room, but I doubt that the appearance of that tortured animal can ever truly be described in any language from our world.
It felt like I’d been watching forever, that I would be watching forever, but as the photograph reset and Holmes drowned by my hand once more, I felt a pressure on my arm. I startled, turning to see what had touched me.
As I sit to write this account, as I have written so many other stories of the occult detective Sherlock Holmes, I find, for once, that I have no idea where to start.
“When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, no matter how improbable, must be the truth.” Holmes said with the flat tone of rote quotation. “And that is what you see before you now.”
“Firstly, I must ask you where your brother’s body was found, and whether there are structures of any kind located in the vicinity.”
I could feel my cheeks growing hot under the few lingering scales, and I turned away so I wouldn’t have to see myself reflected in his eyes. “You exaggerate. I’m merely doing what anyone would.”
I leaned forward and kissed him, right on the bridge of his nose, then pulled back and clasped his shoulders.
“The wonderful thing about amateur occultists,” Holmes said in a whisper, “Is that they cannot tell what information is important and what is not, and so insist on recording everything, no matter how irrelevant. Here –” he turned to pages towards me. “– this entire half of the book is on the spirits they’ve enslaved to keep the grounds clean.”
At the reveal of the camera, Holmes let out a punched exhale of air, and started to fight again in earnest.
One of the sons, I cannot recall which one was holding me down and which was standing, came forward and clamped his hands on both sides of Holmes’ face, forcing his head upwards and holding it firm before the camera.
Holmes tilted his head. “I’m afraid you’re not going to like this much, dear fellow, but we do have to check the scene of the crime, and that means going over by the cliffs.”
The sound of the ocean, once an omnipresent piece of my life as a ship’s surgeon, was a source of disquiet for me now. I do not like to dwell on the events that lead to my discharge from the navy, but there, with that crashing, ceaseless noise lurking on the edge of my mind, I found I could not banish the siren call of the depths, nor the memory of the ways it had changed me.
“Then what do you suggest we do?” I asked. “I refuse to leave her here while we burglarise the house.”
I had never seen a photograph of my dear friend before, nor had I ever seen a photograph in colour, so I held it close for examination, which is why I saw the exact moment it started to move.
“You are remarkable, you know.” he said to me. “It is to my eternal shame that I cannot tell you so with my every breath.”
That scene played out again and again. I am not sure how many times, but the beast caught him in the woods, on the estate grounds, within the Hambleton’s hallways. Once, he even made it all the way back to town before he lost his life. It was never the same scene twice, nor even the same Sherlock Holmes, for sometimes she was a woman, stumbling over her skirts as she ran, and sometimes they were neither male nor female, losing their scarf as they tumbled to the ground.
“Is it not normal for us?” asked Holmes. “I had thought that eleven years of escaping death by the occult presented something of a recurring trend.”
He said nothing, but as we placed the photograph amongst the logs, I knew that the Hambleton estate would be gone before sunrise.
There was no means for us to fight back. Mr Hambleton’s robust physique was not merely for show, and it seemed that his sons had inherited his martial skill to devastating effect. It was an embarrassingly short time before I found myself pinned to the floor by one of the sons, and Holmes was trapped by Mr Hambleton’s impressive grip.
Her voice cut out, and before Holmes or I could ask her to continue, Mrs Hudson’s wife, Mrs Turner,  brought in the tea. Ms Conliffe remained silent as her drink was poured and did not speak again until she had taken a long, slow sip.
“That’s out of the question.” I said, “We have no idea what happened to all those missing people, and the only one who’s been recovered was gruesomely killed. I’m not risking you going off on your own.”
Looking up, I began to panic for an entirely different reason. Holmes had, in the brief moments I was surveying the scene, climbed to the very top of one of the surrounding trees and was perched between two thin, flimsy branches that should never have held his weight.
Ms Talbot’s body was still, but the lines infesting it were moving in fits and starts, forcing the skin flat and moving in terrible angles, so I moved to address them.
I couldn’t bear his light tone, and I tried to turn from him only to find that he had wrapped me in his arms and was dragging me back against his chest.
I thanked him, but in truth I had no idea what could be done to calm Ms Talbot should she and her alien possessor still desire violence. I pushed the thought from my mind as we left the kitchen, following freshly scorched lines down the hallway to the open parlour door.
Our guest had startled at Holmes’ explosive entrance, but she regained her composure quite quickly. “Yes, yes, I am, please, Mr Holmes, I’ve read all your stories in the magazines, and I know you’re the only independent detective who works with the occult, and I’ve no one else to turn to…”
It happened very suddenly, but I can recall every moment. The great creaking behind me turning into a crash, the frigid rush of water flooding in, the feeling of something hard and soft, something hot and cold, grabbing at my leg.
I very much disagreed, but I had no wish to argue with Holmes at the location where a man had died, so I nodded my acquiescence and Holmes removed his hand.
Holmes pressed a kiss to my forehead. “I mean it was obvious that you were lonely, and that what you desired most in this world was a friend. I needed no deductive reasoning to see that, and I found it no burden at all to offer you my companionship.”
Holmes emerged from the pantry, carrying a broom and a damp cake of soap. “I appreciate the faith you have placed in me, and to that end, I will ask that you join me in the pantry, for I am about to do something extremely foolish.”
Holmes and I readily agreed, and Mrs Hambleton departed to prepare dinner. It once again struck me as strange that a house of this size did not seem to have any servants, especially since the grounds were so well maintained and the rooms dust-free.
Holmes must have noticed, for he tried to draw me into his investigations, introducing me to every person we spoke with, pointing out landmarks of interest, and insisting that we stop for lunch at a local pub, which, to his credit, did provide a reprieve for my knee, which was aching by the time we sat down.
He had been sliding into one of his grey moods since he completed our last case, which was not unexpected. His brilliant mind dulls without stimulation, and his last investigation had been a rigorous affair, already detailed elsewhere in “The Case of the Blue Bonnet Mine.” But though I had the reprieve of writing to turn to when the adventure was over, without further direction Holmes’ manic energy deserted him.
“Save your gratitude for after we’ve solved this mystery,” Holmes said, “We’ve got to earn it first.”
When we were not immediately set upon by teeth or lines, Holmes’ shoulders lost a rigidity I had not heretofore noticed, and he walked over to the table to collect the Hambleton’s tome.
The tremor in my voice had spread to the rest of me, and my shoulders were shaking as I spoke. “If you knew that I was a monster, then why share your home with me? For all you knew I could have murdered you in your sleep and thrown your corpse into the sea.”
He did not reply, but as he turned back to the window he slid his toes under my thigh, and I knew my presence was welcome there.
Certainly I can remember Holmes’ words to me throughout the day, but my memory tends to be better where he is concerned.
The form I have heretofore described was similar to a human body in that it had mass and dimension. The lines which infested the body, however, were nothing of the sort. They ran up and down the creature in two-dimensional streaks, forcing the skin it touched into flat abstractions that hurt to look at. It was a horrifying imposition of unworldly, eldritch mathematics on something so fragile as a human being.
“Do come in, my good gentlemen,” said a matronly woman in a practical, lace covered gown. “I am Mrs Lavinia Hambleton, and I see you’ve already met my son, Wilbur.”
I called again, and this time he started to descend, and it seemed as though the entire tree was descending with him based on all the falling twigs. When he alighted on the forest floor, he smiled at me and, before I could speak, placed his fingers over my lips.
The noise just barely concealed the gritty scraping of the creature resting beside the pantry door on our right.
We both lingered there for a long time. And feeling the warmth of his palms in mine, feeling it heal me, I thought once again,
Yes, that was the word. We had survived. And someday, I would let him examine all the scars upon my heart, and perhaps he would let me do the same.
After feeling my knuckles, his hand drifted down to my wrist, as though to feel my pulse. After a minute or two of this, he let go of my left hand, which dropped into my lap unexpectedly, and I realized that I had relaxed my arm completely in his grip.
One long scar across the back of his right hand I thought I recognized, courtesy of Joseph Harrison and his knife. As for the rest, I could not be sure which were from villains and which were from Holmes’s own carelessness.
"...Well, old man," I finally said, patting his hand and releasing it, "I'm afraid that's all I can fairly deduce. Even when I first moved in, I couldn't peg you as a consulting detective."
out of it. Today, you came home from the club far later than usual, with chalk upon your left hand and a grave look on your face, and you have since been so preoccupied that you still have yet to wash off the chalk. I could only fear the worst for your friend Thurston. But you need not confirm or deny,” he added quickly, seeing my guilty countenance, “for I know that would put you in a false position. Forgive me, perhaps I should have kept that last deduction to myself.”
"I am afraid that I fall short in that respect," he continued quietly. "I examine things like problems to be solved and made sense of. I do not like to think of pain, because pain is senseless. And so I fear that I have treated yours like an inconvenience that will go away with time. It is not, and it will not."
Holmes rolled his eyes, but was still smiling as he continued. “Your hands are extraordinarily well cared for, which suggests that they are essential in your work, but that work is not manual labor. Your nails are kept trimmed to the quick and yet you still clean under them frequently— so frequently that I can see traces of you having dug too far and drawn blood fairly recently. Your skin is also quite dry in places, most certainly from having to constantly wash your hands. The great pains to keep your hands clean imply a medical profession, which becomes a certainty when I observe the callouses between your fingers consistent with holding a surgeon’s knife, and the scar on your thumb that is likely from holding the knife a little too close to the blade and paying dearly for it. The scar is very old and faded, which suggests to me that it is from the early days of your medical training, and that you have been in practice for some time since.”
On one such day, sitting in our armchairs by the fire on a cool winter's night, a letter from our friend Dr. Mortimer prompted a discussion about about the failings of phrenology and other pseudosciences until we landed upon palmistry.
I suddenly thought. I wasn't sure why I thought so, with how poorly he had treated them. But the thought came to me nonetheless. I felt my palms tingle again at the thought of his light, fleeting touches. Almost like those of a ghost.
Holmes opened his mouth as if to say something, then shut it again, apparently thinking better of it. When he continued his lecture, his voice was still just as level, but I noticed his hands had started to fiddle with his dressing gown pockets along with his pacing.
He repeated the process for my right hand, occasionally letting out little hums of interest or satisfaction. Throughout the entire examination, I thought with some surprise that although he seemed to completely forget my presence and regard my hands as if they were some fascinating piece of evidence, his touch was incredibly gentle. I had noticed many times before the light, careful touch with which he handled all precious and interesting things, but it was quite something else to experience it. I felt oddly soothed as he traced the creases of my palms and massaged my fingertips.
For a while, we were both silent. Maybe he thought that I was still conducting my little investigation, or maybe he was waiting for judgment. For whatever reason, Holmes was quiet as I held his injured hand in mine and felt the sting of old wounds. All this time, and we still bore the marks of those three lonely years.
Holmes bit back a smile, fingers tapping against the bowl of his pipe. "Well, perhaps not always. But to my credit, I could have been far
I thought, suddenly feeling a little embarrassed for reasons that even I couldn’t explain. I remembered the soothing effect that his light touches had had on me, and tried my best to mimic them, gently stroking and massaging the skin as I examined, but it only seemed to make him even more tense, for I thought that I heard him swallow.
Again, he looked as if he wanted to say something, only to then change his mind. He puffed on his pipe in silence as I sat back in my chair and picked up a book from the side table, and for a while he remained silent, his expression obscured by the cloud of tobacco smoke. But I could see his hands, one tapping restlessly on his knee, the other clutching his pipe in his long, slender fingers.
"My dear Watson, I would be delighted." He leapt from his chair, clearly eager for a chance to occupy his mind. He knelt down beside me and held out a hand.
“It would be a safe assumption that you are a writer,” he went on, “thanks to the callous on the second finger of your right hand, consistent with how you hold a pen rather than a knife.”
Holmes smiled. “You could, that’s true. But I’m afraid the notes that you’ve scribbled on the inside of your left shirt cuff in a burst of inspiration rather betray you.”
I smiled and stretched out my hands. Holmes’s eyes took on that familiar dreamy gaze as he took my left hand in both of his and began his examination. He bent quite close over my palm, his fingers restless in their strange ministrations. He bent and stretched my fingers, one by one, examining the nails closely and feeling for callouses. Then, he moved down to spread my palm and run his fingers lightly over the skin. Once satisfied, he turned my hand over and once again bent and stretched my fingers, though this time he seemed to be observing the muscles and tendons of the hand rather than the fingers.
“Ah, but I’m a doctor, remember?” I chided him with a twinkle in my eye. “I could be an author of monographs, not popular literature.”
Holmes squinted at me across the fire. “It would be hard to say for sure, even for myself,” he admitted begrudgingly. “I have some difficulty retracing my steps, so to speak.”
“There are traces of a nodule at the base of your first finger of your left hand, suggesting that you once had a rather nasty case of trigger finger. Another reason why you were wise not to use your right hand for firearms, as that would have severely damaged your ability to wield a knife.”
I laughed ruefully. “You’re right, though that happened after I came back to London, old fellow. After you—”
Holmes did not seem to have a response. He nodded tersely, his face still very stiff, but I thought that I felt his hands trembling in mine. I squeezed them, and he squeezed back. Proof of life. Proof of us.
I did not, however, imagine him lingering in the doorway. "Watson?" he said quietly, his back to me and one hand resting on the doorframe.
And then, suddenly, his hands pulled away, leaving the skin of my palms strangely sensitive from overstimulation.
I clicked my tongue at the jibe, but we were still both smiling and chuckling as I crossed the room to sit on the arm of his chair. He held out his long, pale hands to me, and I took his left one, holding it close to my face as he had done with mine.
“...You do not take particular care of your hands,” I said quietly. “Or rather, you take normal care of them, but not at all proportional to the ordeals you put them through. Which tells me that you are of an excitable sort of personality, throwing yourself head first into whatever you do with little thought for the strain it puts upon you.”
“Ha! I’d say that’s cheating, but I suppose it would be hard to miss with my hand right in front of your face.”
I resumed my examination, already a bit stumped for what else to look for. His hands were plenty scarred, but where he got each one from, heaven only knew. His finger tips bore the marks of him having drawn blood many times for his chemical experiments, his palms had undoubtedly been scratched up repeatedly from climbing up rough walls and rooftops and searching for clues in the dirt, and on the backs of his hands and even down his arms, I could see countless battle scars.
"I suppose you would. You could tell more from one brief glance at your client than any palmistry book can tell you."
It was a minute before he continued, but I waited patiently, for he seemed to be struggling to put it into words.
doctor and... and a good friend is even more so. You always examine me like a doctor, seeking to find what ails me and how to heal it. That is because you are kind at heart."
“No no, it is no indiscretion on your part,” Holmes assured me, “simply nosiness, perhaps, on mine. I have told you before how I noticed that you use chalk between your left forefinger and thumb when you play billiards with Thurston, yes? Well, last week you asked for the key to the drawer to fetch your pocketbook so that you could lend Thurston some money to take his wife to dinner. I can only assume that his little investment in South African securities went belly up and his wife was sore with him, and you, in your infinite kindness, tried to help him smooth it over, since you were wise enough not to invest but not quite convincing enough to talk
He did not move as I approached him. He did not react as I leaned down to kiss his cheek. He did not react as I left to prepare some much-needed tea.
The words, though beautifully pronounced, seemed to have no effect until he reached the final sentence, whereupon all the lines on Ms Talbot’s body simultaneously stopped moving and, as one, veered into a right angle and disappeared.
I cannot describe how it felt, in that moment, to have all my fears, every anxiety I had nursed for over a decade, be washed away by the simple balm of Holmes’ words. He had known what I was the whole time, and still he singled me out for friendship, gifting me with affection and intimacy for the sole reason that I needed it.
“I don’t believe the blame can be rested on her shoulders,” Holmes said. “If these notes are to be relied on, she is merely a vessel for another being’s intelligence, something which itself is bound by chalk to the Hambletons. It seems her role in this experiment is simply as a meat suit for our foreign visitor to wear.”
“So what’s to become of us?” Holmes asked, seemingly indifferent to his compromised position. “Are we to become your test subjects?”
I love you so dearly, and I have loved you for so long, that I find I cannot speak the words to you. I beg you to forgive me for this cowardice. I will instead leave this manuscript on the coffee table, where you will thumb through it the next time you are bored.
His eyes have always been his most striking feature. It is impossible to tell their colour, for the most apparent aspect of Holmes’ eyes is that they reflect far too much. Some reflection on the eyes’ surface is to be expected, especially in areas with large amounts of light, but to look at Holmes’ irises is to gaze into the world’s smallest mirrors. I could see myself perfectly, unshaved stubble and rumpled nightshirt on full display, as he met my eyes.
“Only one of your sons, mother,” said a young man nearly identical in appearance to our guide. “My name is Curtis, and that’s my father Jonas Hambleton over there.” He gestured to the corner, where a robust-looking older man was reclining. “Now that’s us all named. Who’re you two?”
It was only as we entered the kitchen that we first heard the sounds of habitation. Through the half-open door resting on the far wall, light voices and heady laughter echoed along the hallway, no doubt from the family’s quarters.
Holmes can be singularly charming when he puts his mind to it, and my familiarity with his tactics did not render me immune to the widening of his incredible eyes, the quivering of his lip, or the slight inward turn of his shoulders. It seemed that the man at the door was similarly affected if his pink blush was anything to go by.
