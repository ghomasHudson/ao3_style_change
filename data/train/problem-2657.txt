John dragged him down and kissed him. It was strange, all those people who said that John was the one who had the way with words. On a computer screen, maybe. But somehow Sherlock had known exactly what John needed to hear and had said it despite their audience, despite his 'reputation', despite every single factor raised against men who want to be sentimental.
“May I walk among them?” he asked Jamiarty.
John laughed. "Together," he promised, and kissed him.
He turned and went running down the hall. Molly stood to go after him, but Janine restrained her. “Just a minute. I think I know what he’s getting.”

"Of course you can," David said gently. "This is the good place, after all. You can do what you like."
Ireni’s eyes sparkled with delight.
Sherlock nodded. “They’re married.” That was all,
That was all he ever said, “as you wish.” No matter how unreasonable the request. He even wrote the name of the flower when he presented Sherlock with the bouquet.
“Sherlock!”
When Stan was thirteen his father died. He was twenty-two before he stopped looking over his shoulder for the next blow.
“Oh no. You beat me fair and square. I just had some magic up my sleeve.” Ireni looked at Sherlock. “Hello, Princess.”
Birth announcements had to be written by one of the parents.
“You have another brother?”
Mycroft needs to get one thing perfectly clear. John understands a whole lot more.
“I never will.”
"I'm not a Miss." The voice was quiet, shaking. John turned to get a better look at the officer. Shorter than John, fair hair falling into brown eyes, Hopkins (from the nametag) looked desperate to run. "I'm not, I already told you."
, it can be difficult for Stan to realize that Kitty is genuinely angry. He learns after a few nights on John and Sherlock’s couch. (Yes, she was
Kitty smiled. "Well, Stan, did we?"
Alone again, Mary looked into the glass. Her plain face seemed out of place surrounded by bridal finery. She was no beautiful bride, but she would be blushing. A sudden, wild thought came to her—of Sherlock Holmes made female,
Now...there will be a sequel, but it'll probably take a couple of months to go up, because I don't post unfinished work. I'll give updates on my progress (when there's any to speak of) on tumblr, so keep an eye out!
"I want him gone." There was a terrible hollowness in her voice now. "I want him gone from my life, from my memories. I wasn't happy before we met, not really, but I had some idea that I could be happy someday. Now I don't believe that. So I want him gone. I want him to suffer."
Some headcanons I've developed for the Victorian era. If anyone wants me to expand on any of them, let me know!
Sherlock didn’t flinch, he was too cold to do that. He just bowed his head.
The large room was crowded with people. Molly spotted Grezzik and Ireni, and moved to stand with them. Janine tapped her arm.
********
King Lotharon nodded. The grief he’d shown earlier that day was gone, replaced by calm certainty. “How many troops have you? This is not an assault on the Castle, I hope.”
“Sherlock?” John sounded utterly surprised, and Holmes didn’t blame him. He’d never done that before. He did it again, and John placed his hand over Holmes’. “I slept well, yes.”
“He only tried. And he tried to kill you too, you know.”
Mycroft had always suspected his little brother was different. Removed as he was from the idea of love and romance, particularly with his size, he never even considered that he was different in the same way.
“Her sister,” Moran replied. “Sally’s child is fine. She is safe with her mother. But the dead girl…that was unfair.”
The book was called ‘Have Fun Storming the Castle.’
Grezzik took a deep breath, cleared his thoughts, his mind, his body, and pushed all of his energy into his mighty arms and
It took Billy a little longer to come in. He sat on the bed and fidgeted with his shirt, looking down at his lap, his lip caught between his teeth.
"It's him I have to see you about." Her voice rose. "You have to stop him!"
“Which one do we talk to?” John hissed to Anderson.
In his mind, Sherlock came to him, and explained that it had been fear and fear alone that sent him away. “Of course I love you, John. Of course you’re mine, and I’m yours. I’m free now, I got away, all on my own. And we’ll go away and have our own adventures together, I promise. Let’s talk about them, shall we?”
Next chapter (along with the epilogue) will be up Wednesday!
(See the end of the chapter for
“Conquered?” John asked, alarmed.
"We haven't done anything you didn't deserve, the both of you," Hopkins replied. "Thank you, for everything."
Stan knew who Kitty was long before she told him; he did, after all, read Dr. Watson’s stories. He thought she was awfully brave, and he made sure to double-check all cases of vitriol throwing for extenuating circumstances.
Sherlock sighed. "Because even I only have so much pull. Because there's no witnesses, not even when witness protection is involved. Because his name is Bertie Gruner."
“No, Kitty had the receipt sticking out of her purse.” Sherlock’s gaze unfocused, and John sighed. He got up and sat on Sherlock’s lap. “Sherlock Holmes, don’t ever say something like that again.”
Watson's head was spinning. "I believe we should go to our room, Holmes. I may not know much about this...method, but if it's anything like the other a bed is infinitely more comfortable."
John felt the gun press into his back.
Also, I have an email dedicated to this account. You can reach me at acme146@gmail if you want to send prompts, ask questions, or just chat, I'd love to hear from you.
Mycroft didn’t say much, but when Watson went to his practice and found that all of his patients, including those he did not charge, would be taken care of by any available expert at the usual price, he knew what his brother-in-law had done.
“Sounds interesting. Wait, a village? So he’s a commoner?”
And if they both wore those particular sets as often as they could, and certainly every Christmas day, no one thought anything of it.
“Maybe.” Kitty went quiet again. An awful, lonely, wailing wind started up outside. John was on the verge of telling Kitty to spit it out when she finally did.
“You were wrong about one other thing too,” Sherlock whispered.
John glared at her, but his eyes shifted to just behind Stam. “What is that?”
So Holmes continued to talk, deducing without thinking about it. In between strangers, he observed Watson closely.
Holmes buried his face in Watson’s shoulder and wept.
"Oh, I'm rather used to that," Stan answered. "I read both your blogs, after all."
“Who is that, Sherlock?”
John reached out, alarmed, and Kitty shied away like he was going to hit her. John immediately raised his hands, leaning away from her. "It's alright, Kitty," he said as gently as he could. "You're safe."
Sherlock paced the halls of the castle. The library couldn’t hold his interest for long, but Jamiarty had suggested he stay inside. “I don’t want anyone else to take you, darling,” he said.
"Right, you two didn't have the telly!" John looked rather excited. "I wonder if we can watch what we like, there's so much I think you'd enjoy!"
Mycroft’s carriage was deep black, and the driver wore a mask. She tied the white horses to the back, and the whites stood patiently and let her do it.
"Seems little Missy here's got her paperwork mixed up, and we're helping her out."
“Yes, indeed.” Watson's lips twitched. “How dare he? You only saved the life of two of the Queen's granddaughters, after all.”
"What did Mummy say?" Billy asked.
John shrugged. “That’s the third. It’s listed; they won’t tear it down.”
Why the hell, then, was it utterly Victorian?
"You can have the order you like," Stan replied, kissing her forehead. "I suppose it does sound a bit better."
“Thank you.” The man in black sat down against a rock. “You’re fair, for a thief.”
The King swayed. “What?”
Sherlock's phone buzzed in his hand. “Mycroft, someone else is calling—I don't recognize the number.”
Kitty stared at him and then threw her head back and laughed, setting her mug on the table. "Wow, Doctor, you're surprisingly non-judgmental. But that's not my problem, I could have gotten out of that years ago. I just don't know what else to do, you see. I'm good at this."
He pressed a kiss to Waverly’s head. “Whenever you need shade, think of me,” he whispered. “I will be there.”
There will be another chapter of this before the New Year, and I hope to post a few little oneshots as well.
pays by the word.”
“We can’t do that. There are twenty-seven female Carriers, and twelve male. Well,
Well, our story has nearly reached its end. Tune in tomorrow!
“But honestly…”
“Molly!”
(See the end of the chapter for
But life goes on in spite of that.
Kitty bowed her head. "I suppose it's better...better that you’re together, isn't it?" Stan took her shaking hand in his.
"And I fail to see how you call it anything else."
“Do you want us to do some background checking?” John asked. “I’m sure we can hack in—”
They’re both careful about going too fast; there are too many scars to uncover them all at once. Nevertheless, by their first anniversary they’re looking at a flat together.
Kitty was due in the middle of December, but John and Sherlock got a frantic call from Stan the last day of November. “She’s in labour!” he gasped. “And she thinks the baby’s coming now!”
Watson was looking around the room. "What on earth—it's our flat, though it's...it's not, really."
That was the most foolish thing Watson had ever heard. “It’s
“How did you get through the town looking like that?”
“No one noticed,” Ireni muttered under her breath.
"You're welcome, son," Holmes replied, because he did.
He and Sherlock were sitting and having a nice, quiet, late supper. Their blogs were updated, their phones turned off, and there was every indication that this was going to be one of the nights they spent making love together and falling asleep without nightmares.
At long last, Sherlock sees the truth behind Jamiarty's eyes.
Like right now, apparently, because he wasn’t here as his wife gave birth to his child.
“You see?” Grandfather Sherlock sounded miserable.
“Did something happen?”
“Is that not a good reason?” John asked lightly. “After all, you can have love without marriage, but after all the work Mycroft did—yes, Sher, I know, your brother’s terrible at keeping secrets.”
“We’d get out.”
"Of course you have," Holmes croaked. He placed the baby back in Kitty's arms. "You've done me a great honour."
“Yes, Ma’am.”
“This is her fourth?”
“Magic or poison?” Ireni said bluntly. She pulled up the King’s sleeve and gasped. The flesh looked normal to Sally, normal for an older man.
“Thank you. If you’re a friend of John’s you’re a friend of mine.”
“To fight? Darling, you won’t have to fight if you don’t want to.”
“Impossible,” Sherlock said at last. “The way it moved isn’t possible with robots; it was too fluid. I know how dogs move.”
“Finish him? How?”
“In the altar chest,” the King replied. “Over there.”
That was the plan, then a man—security, unmarried, sadomasochist—came running into the room.
"That's what I call him. Me and all the living Blossoms."
Moriarty chuckled. “Known about what? Your fuckbuddy's little plan to make me dance to his tune, to make me think I'd won then bang! Snatch the game away?”
Watson raised his eyebrows. “And why is that necessary? Are we condoning a felony tonight?”
Janine stared at her until Molly huffed.
“You are wonderful!” Maria exclaimed. It was all she could do to keep him from cutting her, all she could do to keep her blade moving. It was
"You're a bit old to be playing games," Sherlock said thoughtfully. "Who were you trying to convince?"
"Come off it." Donovan was smiling now, and there was a pity in her face that John decidedly didn't like. "How long have you two been together now, hm? Three months?"
“I tried to love them,” John whispered. “More than anything. But I just couldn’t.”
Mycroft attempted to bring him out of it by bringing him into village meetings, but after realizing how amazing John was, the problems of petty idiots were even more dull. No, Sherlock resigned himself to being gloomy and sitting in the stables with Skull until John came back.
Sherlock turned around and forgot everything else.
“And those who would?” Mycroft’s expression darkened. “Those who live to create scandal, who brandish insinuations like swords against the reputations of good men?”
“Inconceivable. No one in Guilder knows what we’ve done, and no one from Florin could have gotten here so fast. Why do you ask?”
Kitty, despite loving kids, doesn’t think she’ll be a good mum. Stan doesn’t think he’ll ever be a father. They’re both wrong.
“Are you sure he’ll be working this late at night?”
"Then I suppose there's the important matter of my being in love with you." Sherlock's voice had gone softer, deeper. "And I'm not under any false illusions, John—I see who and what you are, more so than most people, wouldn't you agree? I'm in love with the person you are, for everything you are, even the parts of you that you despise." He put a hand on John's cheek, caressing him. "How could you ever be boring?"
“I am waiting for Ireni!” she screamed as the latest staggered away bleeding. “I will not be moved!”
Cheers,
“The Prince will catch you,” Sherlock said. “And he’ll hang you all from the tallest tower with the shortest rope.”
“Waverly is alright.”
Watson heard the wistfulness in the lad's tone, but didn't quite understand.
“That members of three different royal families were here?” Ireni rolled her eyes. “This isn’t the most wise, Princess.”
It took a long, intense year, but Domingo fulfilled his vow. He slaved all day and most of each night, long after Maria went to bed.
From the outset Maria was delighted. The man in black knew how to counter, knew how to thrust—he knew how to use the rocky terrain to his advantage. She leapt up on the rocks anyways; he wasn’t much taller than her, but that inch or two might make a difference.
Oh, but it had been so long since he had fought one person at a time. And he was using the wrong moves. He just had to adjust his strategy…
Lord Moran shook his head. “I had no fucking idea she was a witch. This wasn’t the plan—”
Sherlock kissed him, just as he used to.
I've got another request coming up next week--apologies for the delay, but I've been sick the last week or so.
The End
Maria drew her sword and held it out. “This,” she said bitterly. “This, and a man with six fingers on his right hand.”
So I'm experimenting with first person, let me know what you think!
Once Riley was gone, Mycroft looked at Miracle Max. “Is that possible?”
Holmes’ eyes were soft. “You know very well that I agree with him. You’re pushing yourself too hard, John. You’re nearly sixty—that’s not young.”
Sherlock inspected the wedding ring. “Very clean.”
“We have people working on the diplomacy part,” Molly interrupted. “Princess Janine and Duke Mycroft are contacting their foreign allies as we speak.”
Janine’s eyes widened. “I haven’t—”
“I don't like this. Can I see you?”
“You killed my love.”
"Yes." The word was forced out through barely open lips. Sherlock's forehead was covered in a thin sheen of sweat.
Grezzik brightened. “I have one!” He pulled it off his back.
“I’m sorry, Father,” Maria whispered. “I tried.”
It was; their old kitchen, the refrigerator full of both food and toes, their sitting room with their old familiar chairs, a low hum of traffic outside. But there was something a bit...odd.
“I will. We’ll all be home, and we can sort out all this mess.” Molly squeezed her lover one last time, smiled at Sally and Anderson encouragingly, and turned to Grezzik.
Anderson shook his head. “It’s not that—it doesn’t hurt so much. But I…I’m going to be King, and I have no idea how to do that.”
The King’s eyes widened. “Kidnapped? You must have quite a story.”
Also, I am not a doctor, so I'm fudging things a wee bit.
John gave the cabby twenty quid and grinned at his lover. “Well, not the inside.”
"What?" Sherlock asked, stilling his hands. "I thought you weren't ticklish there."
and Molly and Mike brought fresh flowers from their garden, strewing them everywhere in the room. Stan had gone shopping with John to find the perfect suit…and Greg had taken over, which meant that Stan looked halfway decent. Sherlock hadn’t said anything about Kitty’s dress, just that it was taken care of.
“So what? You're going to shoot me, and...throw me over? Seems a bit dull, for you. And messy.”
“That’s really what we’re doing.” Sally looked away. “We have proof, Father.”
“Come outside, Sally. Let’s get away from all this.”
“No, I don’t want to do that. My plan’s a lot more simple.”
After supper they went into the sitting room. Billy deliberately took one chair and threw his feet up on the other, barely managing to reach. It left his grandfathers on the sofa. Billy sighed as they sat on opposite sides of the sofa, doing everything they could not to touch.
“Trap?” John murmured.
“Scotland Yard has done some very competent work lately, and there are some, such as Wiggins, who will continue to raise the level of skill in that outfit. Hopkins is well placed as Deputy Commissioner, and with Mrs. Hopkins and Billy to consult when they are out of their depth, it is an ideal time for us to bow out.”
the Cliff, finding footholds and handholds where there weren’t really any, certainly not big enough for his hands, but they were there…
Sherlock's vehement shake of his head didn't fool him for a moment.
“She died when the Prince was two,” Max replied. His forehead creased. “The King didn’t marry her Highness until the Prince was nine. Why do you ask?”
“Well, he normally does it with books. He insisted on reading outside so Mummy wouldn’t fuss at him for exercise—he needed it even then—and the sun was his constant enemy. He kept trying to make the light fall differently, but he would always end up holding the book the same way without even realizing.” He sighed. “Should have known then he was going to be a controlling, stubborn…”
Moriarty sighed. “I knew you were going to be difficult. Well, time to pull out the big guns.” Surprisingly, he didn’t take out his gun.
“No one’s as clever as my Sherlock.” John raised a hand to Sherlock’s face.
(See the end of the chapter for
Holmes raised his eyebrows. “Explain.”
“That’s alright, I’m still getting used to you.”
"I'm just going to get a bowl and some Cinnarizine," John said soothingly. "I'll be right back."
This is for Arvi, apologies for this taking so long, but by necessity it had to follow the Victorian wedding and that chapter was being annoying, I hope you like it!
Anderson joined Sherlock, and suddenly they were separated, all of them, into three groups. Three chances, three quests to bring Jamiarty to justice for good. Sherlock could almost see the delicate balance between them, the knowledge that failure meant not only the death of their hopes, but possibly the death of the group. The deaths of people who were family now.
Moriarty raised his eyebrow. “No?”
“I’m…I’m fine.” It was the rain, of course. The rain pouring down outside, the rain that had soaked through Watson’s shirt…that’s all it was. Making him hear things.
“What?!” That put some fire back in Anderson’s eyes. “You try that and I’ll—”
on John’s laptop. That was all they could do, because the Internet seemed to be down. Sherlock explained that he didn’t feel like fixing it, and they had all of those discs, so why not?
John looked closer. Sherlock's jaw was tense, his entire body was held stiffly, and his eyes were unfocused.
Ireni groaned and sent the horse running. “The country across the Channel. It’s the sworn enemy of Florin! Once the prince sees it, he’ll think that his precious Princess has been stolen by Guilder. And when he discovers the corpse on the Guilderian frontier…well, the war will be glorious.”
The man didn't seem offended. "The name's...well, might as well call me David. I've got rather too many names, several that don't mean anything to either of you. I'm your guide, so to speak; I do the introductions."
“How long have you known?” John asked, his face tense.
Mycroft never told them if he was in any danger, but with a job like his…
When everyone had finished cake (even Mycroft had a piece—both Mrs. Hudson and Lestrade insisted) Lestrade got to his feet and tapped his glass. It wasn’t really necessary; there were only ten people in the hall, but it did get everyone’s attention.
“If you need persuading…” Molly started to snarl.
Molly was white and sick looking, and she stared up at Sherlock in horror.
The reception, the speech and the song.
"Right...so why hasn't anyone stopped him?"
“It's the only way.” Mycroft's voice was gruffer than usual, and John wondered if the Iceman was actually moved. “Moriarty won't rest until he's destroyed Sherlock completely. Once he believes that done, he won't suspect our next moves. You must keep up a strong act, John.”
"Well, we..." Watson stopped speaking. Holmes put his arms around him.
He got out of bed and went for a walk. It was a windy, overcast day, and the bees were buzzing. Perfect, in other words. Holmes closed his eyes and took a deep breath. They’d been so worried about the visit, unable to write to Kitty and Stan properly about their concerns. Kitty had just told them that it would be alright. Holmes shook his head. What had he done to deserve such a wonderful daughter? Truly, the folly of thinking all women were like his nanny so long ago…well, perhaps the bitter taste of being proven wrong, no matter how happy an occasion, was penance enough.
Holmes laughed as he swung Rachel into his arms. “How was the train?”
“Goodnight, Kitty.” Holmes continued to stare at Hopkins even as Kitty patted his shoulder.
“Why all the secrecy, brother?” Sherlock asked once everyone was inside.
“MI6,” the man replied. “Formerly.”
Miracle Max swore. Molly raised her eyebrows. She’d never heard that one before.
“Or childish.”
He would stand there, and try to give people a show, and they would boo. His mother said they were afraid of him, but Grezzik didn’t understand. He’d never hurt anyone, not on purpose. He loved people, and all they could do was boo.
The song began in a fit of pique with a new flatmate. How dare the doctor move his books? They were, perhaps, all over the chairs, but hang it all he had been looking for something. A quick trill, a twang of string, on the master’s finest violin.
He and John had been as blissfully happy as an irritating older brother, infuriating Yarders and an overly-indulgent landlady could allow a couple to be. Nearly two months into their new relationship, they had yet to have a ‘couple-fight’ (This was established after John had pointed out that the domestics they had before they were a couple didn’t count as their first fight, no matter what. Sherlock had lost that argument—“which isn’t a fight either, love”—and had been careful ever since.)
“What an interesting name.” Queen Bella rocked Waverly, smiling at her. “You have your grandfather’s face, little one.”
“They’ll see that at the castle,” she explained to Anderson. “Come on. Let’s bring your baby home.”
The King stared at them all. “You’d make efficient conspiracists,” he murmured.
There was a time when Grezzik didn’t think he would be a war starter. Hell, there was a time where he didn’t think he would be a fighter at all, and certainly not end up in Greenland.
“That’s a pretty story, Doctor, but I’ve no living family, and I don’t need to be asking more strangers for charity.”
Mycroft held out his hand. This time, when Gregory took it, he raised it to his lips. “I do care, Gregory Lestrade,” he said solemnly. “I care more than I know how to express.”
He made one last funny face, heard her little laugh one last time, and closed his eyes.
Watson nearly reached out to take Holmes’ hand before he stopped himself. “Mrs. Hudson,” he said as gallantly as he could, “thank you for your assistance, but I believe that Holmes and I can manage from now on. I simply need rest.”
“We’re thinking about having a child,” Stan interrupted.
When Mary Morstan was nine, Jacob moved into their house. He built Mary a beautiful doll house and painted her pictures. He gave her a new name, with Mummy’s permission. “Mary’s a grown-up girl’s name,” he said with a chuckle. “Why don’t you be Molly while you’re little?”
It probably had something to do with the fact that he'd slept apart from Sherlock the night before. It was tradition, after all, and John had let Sherlock get away without a lot of traditional thing, he didn't like them much himself, but the fact remained that this was one simple, easy thing to do. Sleep apart from the man he loved. Who he hadn't slept without in over four years, not counting one or two days here and there, but those were ordinary days. Not the night before their wedding, with all the qualms and worries that came with that.
The worst night wasn't the last. The worst night was when Watson didn't recognize his husband and shouted for him, sobbing about the Falls, and Holmes was too weak to even reach a hand over, too weak to call out.
(See the end of the chapter for
Then Greg forgot about it, and a year later he and Mycroft got married ("I went to all the trouble to legalize it, Gregory, why not take advantage?" "That is the least romantic proposal I've ever heard. "So it's yes?" "Of course it's yes, I was just pointing that out.") In a gesture of goodwill, he asked John to be his best man.
And now the witch was only a hundred feet above them. She was looking down at them and Grezzik took one second to see the bundle in her arms.
“Hello Gregory.”
“Those are common signs of fear,
Watson drew him close again, his own arms shaking with the force of his fear. “I’m here, Sherlock.” It was all he could say. “I’m here, and I love you. Let me feel your pain, let me take it on myself. Let me give you comfort.”
I'm sure some of you have caught this, but Jamiarty's first murder is inspired by Moriarty's first murder in the show, when he was ten.
The barmaid was shorter than Molly, and she said she was sixteen, seven years younger. But Molly wouldn’t have believed that, for the girl had the face of a woman old with suffering. When the stablemaster came in and shoved her aside, knocking her to the ground, she knew why.
“Ah. Sound reasoning.”
“Man and husband, say man and husband!” Jamiarty snarled.
Sherlock smiled. Then he heard a wail through the dungeon door.
Sherlock didn’t speak, just buried his face in John’s neck and cried. He didn’t make a sound—rarely did when he cried. He just shook and breathed in John’s scent, because John was still here and that was
"I had to hurt him," Kitty whispered. "I had to. Show him roses…roses have thorns."
"I don't think that's a good idea," John said. "Sherlock probably wants you handy." He left out the part where he thought the less time Kitty spent in the same place as Gruner, the happier he would be.
“Yes, but you’ve got to be there first, remember?”
“I am a doctor,” Watson gasped as he sank onto his bed, hand pressed to the wound. “And I am fine, Holmes, stop fussing about.”
“Sherlock?” John repeated, ignoring Mycroft.
“But that’s just it!” Anderson burst out. Sherlock cast a quick glance around, but they were still alone. “How the hell can I figure that out? I don’t know how to do anything right!”
“Told you. It’s a surprise.” John took his hand. “Come on.”
“You can’t mean that, love. We can’t kill him.”
Warning for frank discussion of child murder (not gory, but some ugly thoughts).
“How long have you two been together?”
“You invited us!” Sherlock roared back.
“Why wasn’t that listed among our assets?!” John snapped. “That will do. And…well. I don’t know where we’d get a holocaust cloak.”
Grezzik fell to his knees. The burns on his arms and legs were bad, but nothing compared to the agony in his heart.
“John?”
But Molly looked interested. “It’s Molly. And perhaps…but you did say you were bored.”
Of course, life isn’t fair. Everyone in that room knew it, down to the bones that had given them frames for their trouble and the hearts that had broken more than once. Even stories aren’t fair.
The Count didn’t recognize her. “Kill the giant and the woman, leave the other two for questioning.” He glanced at Stam. “You’re really going to throw away everything for this?”
“Mawwiage is what bwings us togethuh, today. Mawwiage, that dweam within a dweam.”
Sherlock hated calling their dates 'dates'; he'd do it if pressed, but 'rendezvous', 'outings' and 'time together' were his preferred terms. It was only after one too many glasses of wine at Angelo’s that he’d confessed that he thought those words sounded more ‘romantic’. John never let on that he knew.
Sherlock heard the catch in John’s voice. He took John’s face in his hands, saw the pain, the strange hollowness in his eyes. “What did he do to you?”
“Go to sleep, darling. Everything’s alright.”
“You’re sure no one’s following?”
Sometimes in times of trouble, you need a hand from a little further away.
Sherlock stopped taking drugs after he and John started dating. He didn’t need them anymore; there was plenty of rush from being in love.
Stam turned to go upstairs, but Seb’s voice stopped him.
“Look at you, getting smarter.” Ireni let Waverly grab one of her fingers. “Yes. By the time I found you both again, you were in London. And you were…well, you were happy. I didn’t want to spoil that.”
“I hope so,” Watson replied. “It’s strange—I’m sure some people would call this quite an ordinary day.”
“You’ve already tried that with both of us,” Sherlock said. “And yet we’re here. Forgive us if we aren’t terrified.”
Ireni was sitting cross-legged on the grass with two glasses in front of her, with a bottle of wine and a small plate of cheese. Princess Sherlock was next to her, bound, gagged, and a knife to his throat.
"Shut up," Sherlock ordered, his voice muffled in John's hair. "Shut up, don't you dare...don't you DARE say things like that."
“Don’t say that Ireni, please.”
“There was a duel here,” he said, tracing the footprints. “Both masters, they fought hard.”
“Oh. Very well, then.”
Greg waited,  grinning at the lack of response.
And for now, this story comes to a close. If I ever get any prompts or inspiration strikes, I may add something new, but for now, goodbye to the world of Dreams and Visions. It will always be there to welcome back its readers :)
Molly snapped out of her stupor. “Yes, of course. Hello, Janine.”
Cheers,
"Keep Kitty safe. She's right about that book—my informant knew about it too, but apparently it's not widely known, especially among the women. It seems like it might be enough to put him away for life, as well as save Kitty's friend. We can get started on that tomorrow."
“Apologies for keeping you waiting so long, gentlemen.”
Cheers,
Sherlock keeps his wedding ring almost obsessively clean. He’s delighted to realize that John does the same.
She needed to eat to keep her strength up, to make sure she had enough milk for Waverly. But what if it took days for Grezzik and Molly to return? Or weeks?
“Really? Show us. I’m not comfortable leaving you here anyways.” Maria glared at Stam. “I do not trust you.”
“Let me loose,” Cerise said. “I want to see my niece crowned.”
“Then I’ll give you the Potion and explain it all, and then you can decide. I can give you a few batches, so you can have as many as you like.”
When the man in black came around the corner, he had just enough time to see the rock before it crashed…into a tree, two feet from his head.
David's eyes twinkled. "Me and a few friends. We’re incorrigible romantics, and everyone thought it was a brilliant idea. Anyhow, that's not really what we need to talk about right now. So, here's the standard bit. Yes, you are all dead. No, there's no real tribunal, we sort of see all, know all...except the more, ah, intimate details. The people you love are all here. I do love saying that, it's not always true."
I'm surprised we've found a place to stay."
“Anderson’s from London,” Mycroft explained. “I needed someone inside the palace, and he volunteered. He wasn’t…well, he wasn’t meant to father a child, but his advice has been most helpful.”
“Sally!” It was Philip, and when Sally looked up he was there, Grezzik carrying him, Waverly in his arms.
Jamiarty laughed. “Come now, Sherlock, don’t be predictable. I’m not going to hurt you.”
Billy shook his head. “I can do it, Grandad.”
The wind was coming up, and the roofs of the neighbouring buildings were coming clearer in the early dawn light.
John got to his feet shakily, looking around with growing dread. He was on the roof of an all-too familiar building. He and Mike had come up here to smoke sometimes, in brash defiance of their teachers, their own
“Fine. Just remembered how—how to get it out.”
"Call him. Stop him from going inside."
“The guard on duty yesterday,” Janine said at last.
“Shall we rejoin them?” Mycroft asked.
Kitty protested loudly when she was told the plan.
“What’s wrong, Molly?”
Introducing Prince Jamiarty, and a proposal is made.
"Apologize, now," John snarled. "Say you're sorry to—sorry, what's your whole name, Hopkins?"
Kitty didn't come downstairs until nearly noon, which proved Sherlock right about her lack of sleep. John was just starting to wonder whether he should go check on her when he heard a faint thumping from the stairs. He went out to see Kitty sliding down the stairs sitting down one step at a time, taking care not to jar her ankle.
“No,” Billy said, grinning as he took his suitcase from Grandfather John. “Rachel sends her love, so do Mum and Dad. If Dad hadn’t been ill…”
"Because Bertie Gruner is a...I believe the term is weeaboo? He's obsessed with Japanese culture, at least the parts of it that appeal to him. He shows a particular fondness for Naruto. My idea was to set you up as a collector with first editions to sell of the manga, but you need to actually know what you're talking about."
In a moment of sentimentality, Mycroft buys Greg a sculpture of a goldfish. Greg doesn’t get it until Sherlock explains.
John glanced over his shoulder and watched Moriarty take out a phone. He tossed it to John, who caught it with nearly-numb fingers.
“Well…” Sherlock was struggling. “I’m all for saying it’s our anniversary so long as we’re awake, but most restaurants are closed by now…”
“I told him I was coming to visit you, Uncle John. Stanley—I mean, Mr. Hopkins is a good friend to me at the station. We often talk when it’s slow.”
“Well that’s not very nice. What have I ever done to you?”
“You can’t see—right, of course you can’t.” Ireni looked up at Sally’s father. “You’ve been poisoned, your Grace. And I recognize the magic.” She reached out for Waverly and touched the baby’s cheek. “It was the witch who stole Waverly.”
Holmes drew him close against his chest, face buried in the crook of Watson’s neck. “I love you,” he whispered fiercely. “I love you so,
“You are a war starter! You don’t have to be fair!” Ireni yanked the Princess up the hill, and Grezzik picked up a rock.
“Thank you,” Watson managed.
Holmes shook his head fondly. “I’ll let Mrs. Hudson know.”
"How much longer do you think he's going to let this go on?" Donovan challenged. "I'm sure you're a nice little distraction for now—I don't think he's ever managed to keep someone into his bed for this long—"
“They’re called lesbians.”
Two hundred feet from the ground, he caught up with her. He drew her close to his chest, curling into a ball as much as possible.
“Then they’re safe…but where are they?”
“The Count broke it,” Stam volunteered, pulling John up and wincing when he stumbled.
John looked around to see Holmes, tinkering busily with Sherlock’s instruments. Watson was out for a visit with their Kitty, and Sherlock had gone with him.
He’d meant it as a joke, but Anderson’s face crumpled.
So this is set in a nebulous time in both worlds, but definitely before the events of chapter 44
“Of course.” Maria paced away, but came back a few seconds later.
Of course the test didn’t solve anything, and there were several more arguments before it was eventually settled. John did have to fight hard to convince Sherlock that Kitty and Stan would prefer actual baby clothes to the…physical proof of John’s donation.
“You’ve been doing a brilliant job of making sure I know you’re going to stay with me this year,” John continued. “You’ve been wonderful, and I wanted to make sure you knew it too.” John tried to smile, but his lips were trembling. “I’m with you, dear. I always will be.”
“Faithfulness, sir, your enduring faithfulness. Now tell me the truth, did you get engaged the moment you knew he was dead or did you wait a week out of respect?”
“We should, yes. Anderson, is your leg bothering you?”
John took a deep breath, forbidding himself to throw his phone across the room or shout; anything that might frighten Sherlock. He knew about dozens of hallucinogens and their varieties, but this was…this was something different. This was just for fear, a horrible, maddening fear. Henry was just a kid, for fuck’s sake, barely twenty two. John was going to find the monster who thought that was okay, and he was going to dose the fucker with his own poison and tie him up in a room with an endless loop of horror films in the background.
"You can call me Kitty. That's the only name I've ever liked."
“That’s in—”
“I don’t want to marry him, John.”
“Anderson—Philip. Don’t be stupid. We’ll get this sorted and you’ll be right as rain.”
“Well, then…we still need a first dance song. I want to have one, at least. Sherlock loves dancing…” John looked dreamy for a minute. “I want it to be perfect but I have no idea how to go about choosing one.”
Will Grezzik and Molly make it in time?
John had been fine, all the way to King’s Cross Station. He was fine when he got there, minus one moment of customary panic as he ran full speed into what was clearly a solid brick wall  - he was going to die, he was going to die, oh god - with a great thrill of exhilaration when he appeared on the other side, triumphant at having cheated death yet another day. He was fine up until the Express pulled into the station, bigger than he’d ever imagined, big like he thought of grand elephants and airplanes and gods were big, and he forgot how to speak. He had to be reminded to hug mum and hug dad, and then he was bustled onto the train with his new owl (
the special broadcast reminded all citizens - children, especially - to obey curfew, and to lock their doors at night.
"He needs your help, their was a murder in Dartmoor, he's asked you to come," Sherlock gasped and sat up straight, eyes glowing bright, cheeks flushed with excitement.
"One moment."
“I did?” Sherlock said, voice soft and small. John nodded and caressed his cheek with his thumb.
Sherlock shook his head, “No, no, he’s not old, and he’s not like that, he’s a good man.”
," Sherlock waved the card in the air, even though he really only wanted to tuck it into his breast pocket, feel it next to his heart, breathe in that safe, warm, musky smell... "I don't ever want to be married." Sherlock declared, letting the card find it's place next to his plate. Greg's lips quirked into a sad smile, and gave Mycroft a pinch, as if to say
Was this some sort of sick hallucination?
Sherlock looked back down quickly.
“Watch your language, little one,” John tutted, petting the tuft of curls poking out from under the covers. “Who’s Mycroft?”
"I was thinking we might get away early," John whispered, breath hot in Sherlock's ear. The omega flinched and looked up shyly. He blinked, struck dumb by the radiant man who was sitting close...so so close...Sherlock swallowed, cheeks flushing, mouth open ever so slightly. John growled and moved to kiss him when they were interrupted by a loud voice beside them.
”Hut 8,” he said with a kind smile and the girls exchanged glances.
"Because I want to?"
"John, why are there so many army planes?"
Neither was John.
"s-sorry, daddy," He mumbled, swallowing the cavalcade of tears that was threatening to spill over. He needed to be stronger.
"Watson residence,"
“Yes, Jawn, much better.” John smiled and reached into his pocket, pulling out a chain of metal with his dog tags dangling at the bottom. He unbuckled Sherlock’s collar, ignoring the whine at the absence and sliping the tags over Sherlock’s head, the cool metal resting on his chest.
John was riding out his high when he jumped, there was someone at the door. His eyes flashed with fear but Sherlock only grinned and stood, pulling on his pants and trousers before he opened the door, the hallway empty, before looking down to see a gaggle of corgi's, butts wriggling and tongues panting.
"I thought you liked your alphas loyal, Lieutenant,"
"Goodnight, John."
"I, uh-"
"Mmm," He mumbled into his pale smooth skin, "long day. Long, long day," Sherlock's collarbones were dipped in pink blush, and John ran callused thumbs through the curls that hung by his ears. Sherlock yelped as John pulled the omega over his shoulder, holding him by the inside of his knees.
"But-" Greg cut him off, pushing him by the shoulder out the door, closing it behind them before Sherlock could protest. A hot ball of emotion was climbing up Sherlock's throat, and he felt tears welling in his eyes. He pushed Greg's shoulders, glaring up at him.
"E minor,
"No, no you must stop that at once, no wonder you seem ill. You'll have those days off, I will see to it." Alan said quickly, looking back down to his drawings as if nothing had been said.
"Ah ah," John growled and put a hand up and Sherlock froze, feeling so
“Good morning, Sweetheart,” Sherlock’s nose scrunched sillily at the name before he came to rest at John’s feet, already finding it his favourite place to be. John chuckled and ruffled his hair. “Sleep good?”
(See the end of the chapter for
He hit the heel of his palm against his forehead, the voices getting louder and louder. Shut up, Sherlock,
Sherlock was not rubbish at dancing, it turned out.
"So I'll see you tomorrow then?" He smirked, hand resting on the small of the omega's back.
Sherlock was passed out and tucked into bed, hydrated and cleaned up when the phone rang. John glared to the sitting room as he sat on Sherlock's bed watching him to make sure he was okay. He grumbled before stomping over to the phone and picking it up in a huff, angry and protective of Sherlock's much needed rest.
“Enjoying the party, princess?” A low voice came from nearby and Sherlock looked up quickly to see one of the honored RAMC officers looking at him like he was a cut of steak. He blushed nervously. He was very aware of how tight the trousers he was wearing were, and how he had elected to wear knickers instead of pants, and that this man was too close. Too close. Sherlock closed his eyes briefly and shook his head.
also- very mild drug use
"You do, don't you?" John grumbled, giving Sherlock's arse a firm slap, sitting back, pulling his own shorts down, purpling cock springing free, Sherlock's eyes widened peeked over his shoulder, John was... he'd never seen anything like that... he must've been at least 9 inches long and so so wide. Oh God. Sherlock kicked out in horror, caught between craving and genuine visceral terror. John pet Sherlock's flank softly, "We're going to go slow, darling," He murmed, dark and a bit hoarse and Sherlock nodded, his sweaty dark ringlets smooshed into the bed.
Sherlock was going to puke. He was going to puke, he was going to puke, he was going to-
The phone clicked and Mycroft sighed, groaning and dropping his phone into it's craddle. Sherlock Sherlock Sherlock. Forever and always a thorn in his side.
The smile didn't last long, and a tremor began to shake through Sherlock, he could feel her fingers around his ankles, and he was numb. He killed her, he could see her eyes, frantic and wide and he had kicked her down. He'd saved his own life and taken hers. It was a calculus he could not understand.
"That's not something I like to say, you know this, and besides, what does it matter? Sherlock is not like you and me, he's- he needs someone to keep him in line, they all do."
"India or Australia?" Sherlock said softly, watching the captain's cufflinks that poked out of his jacket sleeves with fascination. The captain looked down at him quizzically, but not angrily.
"Sherlock, please, calm down," Martin sighed as he pushed the ring onto Sherlock's tiny thumb. "This is an important day for you, you have to look nice."
"What?" Sherlock's eyes glowed and he adjusted the rough bag on his shoulder, mouth hung open, eyes glimmering with excitement, "really?"
"Sherlock... what're you doing here?" She smiled sadly, embarrassed, and looked over to Gregory.
AHHH I have been dreaming of this chapter for so long and here we are at last!!!
"And he supports this?" Alan looked him up and down, and Sherlock felt so exposed, as if the kind man's eyes could see right through the fabric.
"What John does or does not allow me to do is none of your concern,"
"At ease." Sherlock knew what that one meant, relaxing his feet to shoulder width apart, "I see we have some new faces, I'm Commander Mortimer," Her eyes found Sherlock's and he swallowed nervously as she looked him over, unsure if he should look away, look forward, look down? His cheeks flared pink and she gave him a chuffed smirk. "Your role in the Teritorial Army is one of support, but you are in no way unimportant." She looked at Sherlock seriously. "Alright, let's get to it, ladies,"
“Nah, I just brought chips.” Ross laughed audibly and caught both their gazes before blushing again and licking his lips. Strange smiled slyly. Ross had no idea how those two would have met before but the subject didn’t come up. Soon the two Americans were alone again as Nakia made the rounds. Suddenly, the red cape that this man wore moved, the corner of it coming and delicately wrapping around Ross’s wrist in a kind gesture of sorts. He stuttered and looked up at Strange. He gave an apologetic smile before batting the edge of his cape down and shushing it... um, that was weird.
"I suppose so," Sherlock whispered, leaning his cheek on his shoulder, closing his eyes. His mind was screaming at his body to stop.
"You're shaking, Sherl, what's going on?" She soothed, rubbing up and down his arms, "I know it's hard to lose a friend, but she's in a better place, and it was probably painless."
"So This Is Love" by Irene Woods
"But- the p-planes, Jawn,"
"Right. Well. Gregory's liable to be awake soon, he's taken his day off to be with you. Try to be nice." Mycroft stood, wiping the wrinkles from his trousers and retrieving his umbrella from the foot of the bed. He turned the doorknob and made to leave.
"Mr. Holmes," John said, eyes still slightly on Sherlock as he made his way to the sofa next to Greg, eyes glued to the floor. He shook hands with the ginger alpha and they shared a curt smile.
"So bossy now, eh?" John pushed two fingers up inside, and Sherlock gasped, crying out in relief, hips pressing himself further impaled on John's hand.
"That Hitler's a loud fellow," The poor omega, the young Louise Trevor, meekly added. She was being thrown at Mycroft by her elder brother, both alphas hoping to pawn off a sibling to the other. She wasn't ugly, she was rather pretty, he supposed, all big blue eyes and sandy hair, and to someone who was interested in females probably a good catch.
"Overdue for a brotherly chat," Mycroft tucked his notebook into his inside pocket, "does John know?"
"Yes, Jawn," Sherlock whispered, pressing back into John's chest, pulling his arm up to hold to his own chest, examining each strong finger with intent. He placed John's dry rough palm agianst his tummy, heart fluttering with guilt and sadness and he turned to look at John, icy grey eyes lined with tears. "I'm sorry,"
"Continue pressure and I'll stitch him closed, you did good," There was a pat on his back from one of the onlookers and Sherlock pocketed the bullet before pressing down again, his stained hands leaving bloody marks all over the torn shirt of the Captain.
"It's not important. What was he like,
"Mycroft will need to imprint soon, so you should phone him first, have him fudge the paperwork," Sherlock mumbled, eyes watching protectively over his new niece.
He arrived back at the office, rushing into his own office and shutting the door, dropping his briefcase on the floor, leaning his arms on the desk and shuddering. He'd done this, he really had. He shook his head and gathered himself. He had work to do- he would not allow
"John! It's Greg, I- uh, I need to talk to Sherlock,"
"I am so so sorry, Esther," Sherlock whispered, throat constricting, heart heavy in his chest, "I should have- I should have done something, I should have fought for you, I am sorry," His eyes were blurry with heavy tears, and he reached down to grasp her hand, which was horribly cold. "I'm proud of you, Esther,
“Careful, Sherlock, it’s hot!” His eyes grew wide as he looked down fearfully at his cup, blowing harshly at the sweet liquid, a few drops dribbling over the side. Sherlock very cautiously sipped at the cocoa, finding it was indeed quite hot. He set it down despondently, blowing at it impatiently. “Would you like me to get a piece of ice?” daddy said with a laugh, rubbing Sherlock’s back. He nodded and daddy fetched a cube that plopped into his mug, floating like an iceberg in his beverage. He poked it with his finger, watching it dissolve in a puff of steam. He poked his finger into the cocoa and found it alright to drink.
"Go on, you're hell of a lot brighter than I am."
. Hudders was next to him, humming as the cab screeched to a stop. Sherlock shook like a leaf, and Mrs. Hudson pat his knee reassuringly as she opened the door, and Sherlock stepped out after her. She brushed off his shoulders and pulled up his collar over his bond bite. He gave her a smile of gratitude as Lestrade paid the cab.
"M'not,"
"I'll be in a minute,"
"Can I help you?"
No! No, John needs me to be this, I can be this for John. Anything for John. John loves me.
"India- Calcutta, how'd you know, love?"
Sherlock. You belong to me and you will obey me,” John paused, placing a calming hand on Sherlock’s shoulder, feeling the shivers of his beloved beneath him.
do that again, or there will be consequences."
“I like your beard, daddy,” He mumbled, running fingers through the rough and scratchy ginger hair. John growled dangerously.
The shutter clicked and Sherlock gasped. His eyes flashed up to his own in the reflection, timid and amorous and his skin glowed diaphanous with the remnants of his enjoyment.
"They're sitting ducks!" John growled, "Where the hell is the bloody Air Force?"
“What is it, Sherlock?” Sherlock whimpered and tossed his mobile onto the duvet frustrated, watching it bounce slightly.
"I- uh, I'm married, actually, to John," He mumbled, rolling the ring around his finger, and smiling in spite of himself, "His name is John,"
"I SAID ENOUGH, Sherlock! You may live happy and free in your own little fantasy, but the rest of us live in the real world. I love my alpha, I love my husband, and our private matters are none of your business. Now go. Get out of my house."
"Nooo Jawn," Sherlock mumbled with a silly grin, finger lightly tracing around the mangled and red scar tissues of his shoulder, "not because of
Then there was a shout above decks, that horrible roar of a plane overhead, and John looked up briefly before there was a flash of light. The world lurched forward, the explosion flooding the cabin with darkness water in an instant, and John could barely cry, "SHERLOCK!" before everything went black.
"The cabinet office is going to pledge our support of Poland tomorrow, if Germany should attempt their sovereignty, we will be at war." Mycroft stated, bringing his cigar to his lips and pulling in a puff, coughing a bit through his nose.
“Oh- erm, no sorry daddy,” John chuckled and pressed a kiss on his forehead.
"God, I wish I could hate him as much as he hates me," Mycroft scoffed, stiffening beneath Greg's fingertips. The silvery younger man knit his brows and leaned back to look directly into Mycroft's eyes.
"Oh good. Had me worried for a moment, go on then, love, it's right through there," She pointed to a set of double doors and Sherlock bit his lip, trying his hardest not to be himself. How he wanted to give that woman a real tongue lashing, how her beta husband was cheating with at least three omegas, two male, if the scent of heat was anything to be going on. He turned and pushed open the door, revealing three benches, glass beakers and flasks, burners, goggles, bottles labeled with all sorts of chemical names along shelves to the left, a periodic table to the right. Sherlock already had memorized it, there was a picture of each element in Mycroft's old book, which he knew by heart.
"Mauled by an animal," Came a soft female voice, and three heads turned to look at the small brunette lab tech, who stepped forward to point to the body. "Bites, pretty obviously made before death," Sherlock watched her incredulously, eyes wide and mouth opened into a small 'o'.
"But it's 15 degrees John!"
"And so you decided to fill my head with fanciful nonsense of an omega detective to make me feel better after someone drugged me and induced me into heat? Really, you're doing so well at this brother-in-law affair," Sherlock snapped bitterly.
"I vow my protect, brother mine, to cherish and to guide you, under my house, until you are bound in marriage,"
“Sherlock, darling, that one won’t even fit through the door, much less in the lift” Sherlock pouted as he pointed to the biggest tree they had, it was easily 4.5 metres tall, and John shook his head. “How about that one,” Sherlock looked over. A perfectly boring tree. He sighed, tucking his hands deep into his pockets. So frustrating and exciting and wonderful all at once. It smelled like pine and cinnamon and
"I shave everyday." John smiled, splashing his face with water and toweling off. He patted himself with aftershave and Sherlock's nose went crazy, sniffing the air to understand the strong scent. Sherlock reached out hesitantly, and the Alpha seemed to understand, offering his face forward for Sherlock to examine.
“Brilliant,” John chuckled. Sherlock blushed. That wasn’t so impressive. “What are you studying at school, love?”
“Wh-What are you doing with that?”
Somehow, somehow he didn't mind it. Somewhere inside of him was glowing with warm, golden pride at that mark, as if a way to prove that he was wanted.
“I don’t know, I just,
"Now, My, please, don't say anything you don't mean," Greg said softly, placing a gentle hand on his arm, eyes wide and soothing. Mycroft huffed and shoved Greg off, glaring at his little brother.
"Yeah, an accident."
"no?" Miss Adler almost choked at the amusing gesture of dissent.
This was the flood of horrific chemicals in his bloodstream talking. Fuck John, fuck John and his fucking teeth and his fucking cock and his fucking legs.
"Well, if you're so hungry, why don't you get on those knees and we'll see what we can do?"
He waved it away and strode into the front room, feeling Mrs. Hudson wrap her arms around him and squeeze.
2 June 1940 23:45
"S-scissors," Sherlock whispered, eyes shut tight, gooseflesh all over his buttocks and thighs at the cool air of the exam room. Dr. Morgan's eyebrows raised and he reached across to a tray with a speculum, warming the metal with his gloved fingers.
“Si-Daddy is that your car?” Sherlock said, his voice soft and high.
"I hate you. I hate you, Mycroft, you're not my brother, and I HATE YOU!" Sherlock bit down on Mycroft's hand, and hard, before running, running as far away as he could.
"Fine," He gave her a fake smile, eyes glassy and dark.
look up the old WLA uniforms they are so fucking adorable
"I've been designing this as a recruitment exercise. Have you ever solved a Crossword Puzzle, Mr. Holmes?"
His John. The thought sent a shiver down his back, adjusting his legs to account for the arousal and excitement of his alpha's scent.
Silence. John sighed and shook his head, hating himself for doing this, but he said it anyway.
"That's alright, dear," She helped him up onto shaky feet and bent down to sweep up the shreds of paper, "the biscuits should be cool by now, if you'd like some with your tea?" Sherlock nodded mutely and stumbled into the lounge, dropping onto the sofa in a ball and facing the wall, his back turned against the world. The black leather began to grow hot around his face, sticky and damp with tears he didn't want to fall. Mrs. Hudson soon brought tea and set it on the coffee table before turning on the wireless and moving to wash up some dishes before she stopped. Sherlock's ears perked and he sat up on the sofa, shivering and shaking.
"Alright...step back a bit, stand up straight," Sherlock instructed, looking intently into the viewfinder. "Salute!" John grinned and raised his hand. Sherlock snapped the photograph and looked up with a smile. John strode over, placing the camera on the vanity and pulling Sherlock into a kiss. It was warm and soft and wonderful and Sherlock whined as he pulled away.
“Good boy, using your manners,” John unbuttoned his trousers and pulled Sherlock's cock out, gripping it tightly in his hand, his pet left a muttering trembling mess. He slowly ran along his length, Sherlock’s legs trembling and fighting to stay open. His whimpers were perfection, gravely and low yet so sweet and small. John smiled as he quickened his pace, Sherlock was so hard, so desperate, his words coming to him slowly.
Moran didn't argue and they continued on.
"I'd say it gets easier but then I'd be lying," Sherlock nodded, smiling to himself as they walked, tucking his hand into his pocket, slipping on the ring that he kept there and feeling it- cool and silver and perfectly fit, with the initials
"Sherlock, darling, I'm so sorry about last night," John started, but Sherlock ran past him, mumbling  about the neighbors and Cassidy, Kirsten? something like that. John turned around quickly, watching sadly as his mate avoided his eyes, following after the chase.
"Emilia," He whispered.
Sherlock listened with intent, holding his fingers to his headphones, scribbling out the messages tapping through with his pencil, frowning as the words formed and pulling his headset off. His pencil clattered to the floor as he pushed back his chair and strode down the row of radio transmitters, girls in headphones with a variety of colours of pinned curls before finding his commander. He tapped on her shoulder, his eyes glowing with purpose.
John's teeth ground together as he marched down the pavement, his alpha reeking, the crowds parting. He growled as he walked, feet hitting the ground with punishing force, fingers grasping his briefcase with whitening knuckles. Fucking hell. Fucking hell! Seriously, beta women were granted suffrage
"I can see that much. Whatever for?" Mycroft and Gregory shared a look, and the newly appointed sergeant reached over to rub a circle into the arm of Mycroft's jacket. "And why are we all having breakfast like this, don't you have a government to run?"
"Am I doing the right thing?" He whispered, his entire body numb, eyes locked on his shiny brown leather shoes. Mrs. Hudson tutted and pat his cheek.
Mycroft ordered, but they weren't unified and the room was tense.
"Hush, Louise, here, why don't you refresh my drink," He shoved an empty glass her way and she blushed, rushing off to fill it. Greg scrunched his eyebrows and threw back the rest of his whiskey. He was going to be pissed, and soon, if he didn't watch his liquor. "Now, where is that pretty little brother of yours, I haven't seen him since his presentation. Hope he isn't primping too much on my account." Mycroft burst out a gasping laugh, hitting a fist to his chest to keep from choking.
"You've no need to worry. Your claim is secure, he'll be alright with me and Gregory."
“Yes, love, you may, but I want you wearing safety gear.” Sherlock nodded and nuzzled John’s thigh.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Are you on drugs?" He said suddenly, hands on his hips, breathing a bit laboriously through his nose. Violet only smiled a little more harshly, glaring at her son, who only smirked in return. Back on the tablets again, it seemed.
Greg could only nod mutely, swallowing thickly and turning to get on it before he remembered the baby. Sherlock quickly snapped off his gloves and cradled his arms, Greg gratefully depositing Emilia into his arms, who stirred, not liking the new scent, especially the smell of an Alpha who wasn't hers.
omega was going into heat, all his, every heartbeat chanted a mantra of
“Surprise!”
Sherlock wanted to disappear. His cheeks were a bright crimson and his eyes seemed to constantly be fighting tears as he sat, staring at his shaking hands.. and the ring. It fit perfectly, John had known his size without asking, which was a strange kind of impressive. Sherlock slipped it off, holding it in two hands and looking closely at the initials inside, deciding as to what shape of graver was used.
"f-fine," He whispered, his powers of spoken word quite gone. Sherlock was still shaking, and Captain Watson had a bit of concern still on his face as he watched him intently. His sharp gaze pinned Sherlock, his heart racing. What the hell was going on? He needed to get in control. Now. His omega was begging him, to do something, kiss this man, anything for those hands to touch his skin once more.
Raz dropped the book. “Good evening, ma’am. I didn’t see you come in.”
“Do you remember when I first found you?” Ireni asked her.
Also, for those of you who don't know who Kitty Winter is, she was a character in 'the Adventure of the Illustrious Client'; she was horribly abused by a sadistic monster...and threw vitriol in his face. She's basically so much better than Irene Adler. Stanley Hopkins is a young detective (similar to Dimmock's character but much more polite) who idolizes Holmes. Together, they are my new OTP.
But he couldn’t swim back even though he wanted to, because an Eel was charging him, and there was nowhere to run, and the wail nearly pierced his eardrum—
“Your Grace?” One of the bannermen from Prumpt stepped forward. “Do I have your leave to send word of the verdict to my King?”
The King was looking at her with a gentle, worried expression. “Sally?”
Sally heard that loud and clear, but that was only because Max was a loud man. Sally suspected he was going deaf, because he hadn’t started the shouting until after Waverly was born.
But with her mother dead and her aunt quiet on the subject, she’d never been able to ask.
And it was that simple. That was the one part of being the Dread Pirate Roberts John actually missed; the instinctive way people followed the orders of their leaders. It was clear from the near instantaneous clear up that the inhabitants of the castle loved their King as much as they hated their Prince. A few protested, and they were put in the dungeons as well, but everyone else pitched in to clean up the mess, tend to the wounded, and took themselves off to bed without a murmur.
That bought him a few seconds of Sherlock panting, hands gripping onto John’s so tight that it hurt.
Grezzik picked her up and slung her on his back. “We’re going to run,” he warned her, and took off.
Miracle Max moved to stop him, but Molly grabbed him. “No, Max. Let him.”
“Hello Rachel,” Sherlock answered. “Now, what’s your latest adventure?”
As long as his father was in good health, Prince Jamiarty lived a happy life. He was free to create war strategies that weren’t useful in a time of peace, spend time in the dungeons, listen to any minstrel who could play the latest tunes, and, of course, hunt.
"Then let's go to bed," Sherlock said, his deep voice carrying a new note, the same promise from the party but made much stronger. "There are many ways of showing love in the…
A bright, happy set of notes on the higher strings joined the tune when their first story came out. Horribly inaccurate and sentimental, but...it was nice, after all, to be thought so clever.
When it finally grew too dark to see, they began walking back to Baker Street. As they were nearly alone on the street, Holmes decided it was safe to confide his deductions to Watson. “Your face is very expressive, my dear Watson,” he finished. “Perhaps it would be safer to…control it, somehow?”
"Hello," she said cheerfully. The twins ran to John, who picked them up and slung them over his shoulders. "How's everything going?"
“It was fun!” Billy said enthusiastically. He pushed down the slight worry he’d felt, pulling out of the station, watching Rachel try to run and catch up. A whole week without Mum and Dad…but he had his grandfathers. This would be fun!
John’s eyes were brighter now. Holmes knew that was the stuff of romantic fiction, but it was true. His gaze was sharper, looking at everything as quickly as possible. The crinkles by his eyes were deeper now, more practiced in the art of smiling; the lines around his mouth were the same. His forehead still had worry lines, but it was smooth most of the time. His cheeks had lost their worrisome hollows. Even his ears seemed more intent, more keen to pick up the clues in conversation.
“He told me about the man he loved, gorgeous beyond compare and enduringly faithful. I assume that was you?”
“To your face, pig. To the pain means that the first thing you’ll lose will be your feet at the ankles, then your hands at the wrists. Next your tongue, which will be a relief to everyone.”
Cheers,
“What the hell?” Maria said. She was looking down.
“All of you need to lie down,” Grezzik scolded. And he wouldn’t hear of anything else. He laid Sherlock and John together on one bench, and sat with Molly on the other as Grampy and Nana treated her wounds. Anderson and Stam got the ship moving, and they were off.
The reactions to John and Sherlock’s relationship were as varied as they were passionate. When people found out about Mycroft and Greg, on the other hand, there were only two. It was either “didn’t know you were gay,” or “you two match”.
“If I’d seen you,” Sherlock interrupted, “I would have explained. But we can’t live on ifs, John. We’re together now, and everything’s going to be fine.”
“Oi!”
“You’re wrong about the first,” Moran said. “But there is no reason that people have to believe either story.”
“Need a good tailor?” Greg joked.
“The Strangers Room at my Club.”
John grumbled under his breath.
“Indelicate.”
Once Kitty and Stan were seated, Rachel crawled onto Sherlock’s lap. “Hello, Grandda.”
"No. But he did. And he told me that she was his now, and I better not interfere. He'd just tell her that I was jealous, that I stalked him and I'd threatened to kill him and
