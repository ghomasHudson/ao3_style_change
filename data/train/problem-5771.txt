Tony’s actually surprised to find Wade easy to talk to, and he enjoys their conversation as they clear the table and take everything back into the kitchen. ‘Don’t think I haven’t noticed the way you look at him,’ he says as he fills the sink to wash everything that won’t go in the dishwasher. Out of the corner of his eye he sees Wade tense from where he’s filling said appliance.
Tony let out an appreciative noise and rolled his chair back to the desk. He opened a drawer and rummaged through it, ending up with a jar of Vaseline in his hand.
Caught by the suddenness of it, Steve found himself having to concentrate on not climaxing himself just because of how sweet Tony’s euphoric moans sounded. He didn’t want to finish inside of Tony, because with Tony’s tired state the clean up would most likely just be an unnecessary hassle.
”This is exactly what I mean”, he says then, grabbing Steve’s jaw again and turning his eyes back to the mirror.
”Yes. Thank you.” The therapist smiles, glancing at Steve quickly before turning his eyes back to Tony. ”I usually start by asking Steve how his week has been, but I’d like to start now by asking the question from you. How has your week been, Tony?”
”Aw, you started without me. Rude”, Tony had said lightly, throwing his jacket onto the empty seat next to Bruce and sitting down to eat.
He could lie. He could say that he was afraid that either of them would get seriously injured in battle, die even. But Steve has lied before, and that, at its core, is the reason why he’s sitting here now.
”Oh, for fuck’s sake, Steve”, Tony says, sounding both relieved and frustrated. He sits on the bed and looks at Steve pointedly. ”Fuck you.”
Steve pulled his mouth away and placed a kiss onto Tony’s stomach, knowing that the sound Tony had made wasn’t at him but Tony himself. After five years, Steve had a pretty good grasp of how to please Tony, but sometimes things just couldn’t be helped.
”Just talk to me.” Bucky is calm, his voice reaching to him from a respectful distance, and with a little bit of forcing from himself Steve manages to gather up something to tell his friend. But the thing is, him and Bucky have been apart for a long time, and while the friendship between them was never going away, things like these weren’t something they were faced with when they were younger. Bucky’s been too far from the life Steve’s been living for the past couple of years, and now he feels too far for the thoughts he’s fighting against. Steve tries, but loses his strength to talk in the end.
”All right”, he says determinedly, leaning his forehead against Steve’s. ”This Friday, you’ll come to my place and you’ll bring your toothbrush with you.”
”Steve”, he whispers tightly, his own voice sounding pathetic in his ears. He doesn’t really care, though.
The whip touches Steve’s back lightly, the tip of it traveling down his spine until it reaches his tailbone. Tony uses the whip to push the skirt up so that it isn’t covering Steve’s ass, leaving it bare again.
He’s pleasantly surprised when he hears Steve’s moan turn into a growl of his own. Omegas rarely let out such noises except when they feel extremely possessive, and Steve swallows the sound as soon as he realises he’s making it.
The saint is obviously pleased when Steve lifts his head and makes it easy for him to tighten the strap around his neck. He tries the fit with his finger, his eyes landing on Steve’s.
”Shut up”, Steve croaks. Tony pulls him closer and kisses his forehead, then presses his own forehead against it.
As he hears Thor patiently explain what happened, the memories start coming back to Steve. He shortly remembers the curse, the indescribable pain and the feeling of air being punched out of him. But he’s too tired to stay awake for longer.
”I did. I slept in the car, then went to see Rhodey. Spent a couple of nights at his place drinking beer. Then I drove back here, planning to come home. But for some reason I couldn’t, so I spent the rest of the week in a hotel. Didn’t do much, tried to work. Missed you and the twins.”
Weeks go by. Tony had hoped that it would become easier, but it doesn’t. He can feel the bond almost constantly, disturbing him, pulling at his heartstrings when he just wants to forget.
He keeps massaging Steve’s scalp, his touches light and tender just like Steve’s, his hips moving ever so slightly along Steve’s strokes. They continue like this, the only sounds Tony’s unsteady breathing and the water dripping down from Steve’s hair, until Tony takes notice that Steve’s gotten hard too. He wants to reciprocate, but he’s hesitant to do it since the last try didn’t end up too well. Besides, what he’s thinking of would be much better done somewhere else than in the bath.
Steve is still complete putty when Tony begins to steady his breath, placing a few kisses to Steve’s throat. As the haze begins to clear, he notices that the bond feels alert and looks up to see tears streaming down Steve’s cheeks.
”You’re so good, baby. So good”, Tony continues in a hushed voice, so close that he can feel Steve’s breath on his face. He wants Steve to believe him. Steve’s always been struggling with these kind of things, with the dissonances in his body and sex, and it seems so unfair that he’s now been damned with another thing to feel insecure about. It’s Tony’s job as Steve’s mate and lover to convince him to feel otherwise.
Steve’s also under the impression that Peter’s family isn’t exactly swimming in money. He hasn’t forgotten what that’s like and guesses that it would probably be nice for someone like that, especially a teen of Peter’s age, to get spoiled a little.
”Try to sleep, honey”, Steve mumbles sleepily, his thumb rubbing Tony’s shoulder lightly. Tony knows Steve’s only half awake, and just as he expects, the finger stops moving against his skin soon, Steve’s breathing turning heavier again.
‘Alright I’m stopping you right there,’ Tony gives him a small shake, to prove his point. ‘Peter why do you think I insist you finish school when you could just work at Stark Industries if you wanted to earn some money?’
Tony let’s out a bark of harsh laughter, and can’t hold back his next words. ‘You didn’t seem to care about whether or not I could trust you after Siberia, why the sudden crisis Cap?’
‘Oh now you want to still be in recovery?’ Rhodes says. ‘When we’re telling you to take it easy and not do so much work we’re being overbearing and fussy, but as soon as we start joking around you want to be all “I’m too ill you have to be nice to me”? Not going to happen, Tones.’
Ororo returns it. ‘We have. I am more grateful than I can say that she was the one to find us and take the time to speak to our tribe; we have become firm friends she and I, and she is always welcome to visit our tribe. No small feat to be so accepted as I’m sure you can appreciate.’
Tony thinks as Bucky finally exhausts himself and slides down a wall to the ground, his head in his hands.
‘Can you teach me how to fight with staves? The Doc has this awesome one in a cabinet and I don’t think I could fight with it like a normal weapon, but it’d be cool to learn. Could you teach me?’
Ned huffs from behind him. Peter shoves his friends into the first classroom they find and he opens his backpack for his web shooters.
‘True,’ and now Agatha’s in front of her again, tone more curious now, ‘but you didn’t. Instead it amplified what, otherwise, should have died. And your magic, Wanda? It’s chaos magic.’
‘No I already know who it is, and I’ve already sent orders for them to be detained. Nat’s going to have a lot of fun getting to the bottom of things with them,’ he pauses to take in Hammer’s appearance. ‘It seems Clint had all the fun with you before she got a chance.’
‘I must admit I’m looking forward to seeing how close you really are with them,’ Betty pipes up as the engines start. ‘Because from the stories Ned and MJ tell it’s like you’re actually one of them, you know?’
Sam is quiet for a while, and Peter wonders if the man is actually going to help him or just watch him suffer. ‘I think,’ he says eventually, ‘that you’ll know when the best time to bring it up is, Peter, and I’d suggest waiting until you know it’s not something that’s going to fizzle out soon afterwards if you’re so worried about his reaction. I’d also suggest you get him alone and you tell him about being worried that he’ll be disappointed, as well as how you feel about this guy. I’d also say maybe explain to him how you two ended up together. It might surprise you how accepting he can be, especially when it comes to you.’
It's the first day of the trial, and Wanda has some reassuring words for Tony. Meanwhile Fury's problem continues to get worse.
‘What is it?’ he hears a familiar voice snap and looks over to where the Cloak is now trying to get Doctor Strange’s attention.
‘I just didn’t want to hear something on a patrol and phone Tony and not know I had to let you know first,’ he mumbles into the material. ‘If something had happened to you because I hadn’t warned you-’
‘We’ve been looking at individuals who’ve made big changes in modern history,’ he answers. ‘We don’t have to stick with someone in modern history, but we’ve got to do a presentation on someone who has had a big impact on the world in some way and explain why. Some people have already made their choices and we’re not allowed to do the same as anyone else.’
Suddenly he can’t be near the other man, the sight of blood and brains on his eyelids when he closes his eyes against the burning in his throat.
‘We’ll let the little witch go,’ Francis pats Wanda on the shoulder, ‘on one condition: you beat one of our soldiers.’
Valkyrie salutes her then starts jogging over towards the commotion. ‘Hey Big Guy!’ she calls out, taking a running leap up and off one of the broken logs and onto Hulk’s back, hugging him round the neck, letting herself hang limply down his back.
‘You sure?’ At Tony’s question Steve nods. Tony takes hold of Steve’s hand in his and gives it a squeeze. ‘I’ll warm you from the ice, and you drag me from the water,’ he murmurs, pressing a kiss to Steve’s lips.
‘I know,’ he admits, ‘I’m sorry I shouldn’t have jumped to making a decision but… it was the reaction the people he’d grown up with had when they saw what he really was. Even though he’d just apparently been prepared to sacrifice himself to save them they just wanted to let him die because he was something different to what they thought. It wasn’t his actions that were forming their opinion, it was something he couldn’t control. It…it reminded me of how people reacted to Wanda and Bucky when they first came back, and how people used to be about Bruce and the Hulk.’
‘Well I was thinking more spending time just the two of us outside of the facility, but if you want to do more stuff in Central Park then sure,’ Tony responds with a shrug. ‘Although…I’m not too keen on not being able to hold your hand.’ Currently said hands are thrust deep into the pocket of his hoodie to stop him from being tempted to reach out.
‘I’ll look into it, I hadn’t done much testing in a quiet place so I wasn’t sure how much the noise would be noticeable.’
The father looks at him gratefully. ‘Please. We may have been a bit overambitious with the size of our one this year. But with everything that happened…’
Strange continues to instruct him on breathing until, finally, he doesn’t feel quite so much like a new born fawn, and is able to breathe regularly again. ‘Alright?’
‘Asshole,’ he mutters with a small smile. He makes his way out of his room to find Natasha and Sam, hoping one of them would have some news of how T’Challa’s call had gone. They’re sat on some sofas, looking out over Wakanda and talking about home.
‘Sam no!’ Scott shouts. It’s one of those moments where time seems to slow down, but you can’t move any faster. He watches as the metal contraption spins over and starts falling down as Steve appears on the tree line.
‘Well Rogers we’ve got two super soldiers and a kid with an enhanced metabolism to feed before the rest of us even get a look in. Plus we’re going to lose the equivalent to half a bowl to the floor as people throw it at each other. No matter how delicious Nat’s dinner might have been we’re still going to need all of this.’
‘Wait you’re just letting me do what I want?’ he asks, sounding surprised. ‘I thought I’d have to be under surveillance or something until we know I’ve got the brain washing under control. What if something happens?’
She smiles at him. ‘Sorry, getting distracted by my thoughts,’ she answers. ‘Come on, let’s go.’ She slings an arm around his shoulders when she reaches him, pressing a kiss to the top of his head and wishing she could bottle this one moment of peace and keep Peter this young, strong and loving forever.
”Alpha”, Steve half whispers, half sighs, and Tony growls just for the sake of it, letting his teeth bite into the earlobe in his mouth a little.
The baby is still crying. Steve works on autopilot as he gets up, picking up and pulling on a pair of boxers on his way towards the noise. It’s not far – the babies are still so small that they sleep in the same room with them.
“One”, Steve says after Tony’s palm lands on his flesh. He’s still gripping Steve’s corset, holding him in place, and Steve’s body sort of wants to struggle against it. Wants, but doesn’t. Tony’s palm hits him again.
perfect, and he’s said it a thousand times, but Steve is not stupid to want this – Tony is stupid to be in a rush, to make it seem like this part means nothing to him. He doesn’t need it like Steve seems to do, but that’s not the same as it meaning nothing to him. And anyway, it doesn’t matter, because if his omega wants to kneel in front of him for the first time in almost a year, that’s not really much asked from Tony, is it?
Steve struggles against it for a while before slumping down defeatedly. He has no chance and no will.
”I told you”, is the first thing Tony says with a soft grin two days later when he manages to start breathing on his own and is able to talk. ”You don’t know how much I hate your singing voice.”
”I love you”, he says, and it’s meant for Tony but through him, for the twins too. Tony has to swallow a couple of times, his expression defenseless, before he can answer.
”Stark”, Tony answered it, his voice collected and professional, and all the time he kept moving his hips and Steve was positive that he would lose his mind.
The most likely explanation was that Tony had deliberately left it out. Stuff like that had been happening for a week now. Tony would make coffee, but when Steve showed up for it, there would be none for him. Tony would go through the house and collect the dirty clothes into the washing machine but leave Steve’s dirty socks laying on the bottom of the laundry basket. He’d promise to fix Steve’s headphones (from experience Steve knew it took Tony approximately five minutes to do that) but keep “forgetting” them despite Steve’s several, polite inquiries about them. And when Steve would try to cuddle him in bed, or warm things up, Tony would turn his back to him and say something about feeling too hot, or tired, or having a headache.
Steve huffs at his words but leans in to kiss him, and Tony feels power rushing into his veins at the thought of being able to make Steve feel good. Wasting no time, he snakes his hand around Steve’s cock, making Steve whimper a little into the kiss.
”Perhaps –” he tries, then pauses to gather his spine. ”Perhaps I thought it’d be easier to keep Tony’s affection if there was a child involved.”
Steve didn’t want to keep him waiting, so he pushed Tony’s underwear off and started to caress his ass and thighs, slowly progressing to Tony’s perineum and starting to massage it with his fingers as Tony pushed his leg forward to allow him better access. After a moment, he brought a finger into his mouth, letting Tony hear how he wet it, and then brought it back down to tease at Tony’s hole.
Steve expects to get another hit onto his ass or thighs, but Tony moves to his side and the whip lands on Steve’s arm instead, making him whine painfully. A few more slashes follow the first, and it stings so nastily that Steve’s arm almost escapes the whip against his will.
Hearing the word from between Steve’s lips after so long, too long, sends primal, vicious pleasure down Tony’s spine, and he sighs, his fingers pressing more tightly into Steve’s neck.
Tony wipes the tears from Steve’s face, and when he’s done, Steve gives him a frail smile, catching his hand between his own. He brings it to his mouth and starts planting kisses on it.
”I don’t know but I’m your alpha and I should’ve been there.” Tony sounds frustrated. ”I should’ve been there for Kieran too”, he adds quietly.
Being forced to speak with the gag on puts the cherry on top of Steve’s humiliation. He sucks, trying to swallow as much spit from his mouth as possible.
”Do you want to feel that, honey? Feel my cum filling you?” Tony keeps going, because it seems to be working. It’s working on Tony himself, honestly, his cock starting to beg for attention between his legs.
Then a hand was cupping his balls, caressing the soft skin tenderly, and Jesus Maria and Josef, Tony mewled, his hips demanding to fuck Steve’s face, but he held himself off. After a while, the hand moved lower, pressed against his perineum, and Tony’s legs moved invitingly even more apart on their own volition.
It sounds exactly like something a person trying to gently break up with someone would start with, and Steve’s heart skips a beat, his throat feeling tight. When Tony doesn’t immediately continue, Steve cannot take the silence.
But then again, Tony was alive now. Steve had saved him from a certain death once, and he’d do it again if necessary. He just didn’t want Tony to have to suffer anymore; he wanted his alpha to be able to recover in peace and get to continue his life without the constant threats and grief that had shadowed their lives for years now.
Then he’s running again, and as soon as the door comes down and reveals Tony standing inside Steve nearly falls to his knees. But he doesn’t, because Tony looks frail and Steve has to catch him as he wobbles down the stairs to his arms.
Pepper comes and gives him a hug, then looks at him in that supportive way of hers that would be annoying coming from anyone else.
At some point, it dawned on Tony that he was drooling. Still, it took him a few more minutes to lift his head and dry Steve’s shoulder into the pillow as was practical. When he did and then turned to look at Steve, he found the omega with his eyes closed, no distinguishable expression on his face. The long, strong legs around Tony had eased their hold of him and fallen to support themselves against the mattress.
”Honestly? I couldn’t care less about the Avengers.” Why would he? Even if he cared, Tony’s status as his alpha is still probably the only thing keeping him from being taken into questioning. He cares about the people he used to work with, but the initiative? It’s gone. Fucking Accords, he thinks, catching himself feeling spiteful towards Tony.
Steve got a feeling that it was best to give Tony the space to continue, so he just hummed in response.
”I’ve never been the easiest one, and you know I’ll never be. But I regret causing you so much pain, I regret it every breath I take, and If I could I would do things differently. But I can’t go back in time. If that was possible, I would have left this century the second I woke up in it and would have never met you. I’m not trying to justify what I did, but I keep telling myself that there has to be something good waiting after this too”, he says, breathing out shakily. His fingers squeeze Tony’s hand, and Tony realises he has squeezed back without even thinking.
Steve lets her in. Mid-hallway she turns, showing the package in her hand. ”Oh, right! This was at the door.”
Deep down, Tony knows he shouldn’t do his relationship’s dirty laundry outside like this, especially to his ex. He doesn’t even mean it, at least not in the way his words make it sound like. But the words have just bubbled out of him, and he’s not one to cry over already spilled milk.
”That’s fucking hot”, he says huskily. Then he kisses Steve tenderly, the knot twitching inside of Steve slightly. Tony hums, nipping at the tip of Steve’s nose playfully after they part.
”Absolutely fucking not”, Tony answers sternly, and he’s not talking literally. Although, he doesn’t let Steve’s wrist go either. “Listen to me, Steve. We are getting you help.”
Tony shuts his mouth. He stares at Steve, first confused, then defensive. Steve stares him right back, expression pained with the weight of the truth. Finally, Tony tears his eyes away, looking at his hands instead.
Their life becomes delightfully mundane. They hold a small dinner party for Tony’s birthday, inviting their closest friends. Many are missing, due to the Accords or otherwise, but the rest come and Tony beams with pride as he gladly allows the twins to steal the spotlight from him.
will be perfect for our children. That’s a promise, Steve”, Tony says one night after they’ve made love.
”Yours”, Tony rasps, and Steve didn’t even ask it but he wants to hear it again, so he bites his jaw, working the muscles inside of him to create as much pressure on Tony’s cock as possible. He wants his seed inside him, needs it.
”Please”, he begs, curling himself into a ball. He doesn’t know who his plea is meant for; for God perhaps, or the universe. ”Please give him back to me.”
”Mm-mh, baby. Need to feel you clench around my cock while I fuck you so good you can only think of how much you want me to come inside you.”
Tony hums, starting to talk to Emmett quietly. Steve goes to take a shower, and when he returns, Emmett’s fallen asleep. Tony’s petting his hair lightly, his eyes resting on Emmett’s peaceful figure.
”Smells good”, he comments on the garlicky, spicy scent of food. It does, even if he’s just making conversation. Tony’s a surprisingly good cook, especially compared to Steve. He’s done his best to learn, but it’s still a work in progress.
Giving in, Nat texts Rhodey and soon Steve’s holding Emmett in his arms. It soothes him, but only a little.
”I never meant for you to”, Steve says, not accusingly. He lifts his face and Tony searches his eyes, searches for the light behind all the pain. ”Never. I’m –” Tony can guess that he stops himself from saying that he’s sorry again. ”I’m here.”
”I want to come on your face”, he continued, his breath hot in Steve’s ear. And with that, Steve was turned around again and coaxed to his knees to the floor. Tony laid one of his hands into his hair, taking himself into his other.
”Tony”, he calls instinctively, but it doesn’t seem right. Tony’s somewhere else, something’s happened, and there isn’t time to think. He rubs his ass against the sheets, not caring how uncomfortably wet and sticky they feel against his skin. He needs something inside of him, now.
He can’t. Tony’s tongue begins to fuck him and his muscles spasm, his body simply unable to resist the stimulation.
”You washed it. Just didn’t rinse it, but it’s rinsed now”, he corrects gently. Tony hugs him, feeling tired.
Steve has no desire to risk anything like that happening. He has already lost Kieran. Still, the thought of not being able to be with his only remaining child for days and care for him makes him anxious.
”Sorry! Sorry,” Tony says guiltily, stopping immediately. He looks vaguely confused when Steve shoots him a look over his shoulder.
Peter’s started to present as an alpha. He’s still just a kid nevertheless and it’s none of Steve’s business really, but he can’t block the faint scent from his enhanced senses. He wonders briefly if Tony knows as he gives Peter an encouraging, sound smile and begins to help Tony set the table. His hand brushes Tony’s lower back as he reaches to get some neater drinking glasses from the top self.
Whew. That's quite a chunk of Andmoreagain finally out. Thanks to everyone who has been following this story. <3 It's been an exciting couple of months, and your love and comments have meant the world to me. Thank you.
He rests his forehead against Steve’s shoulder and keeps stroking. Steve pets his hair, little gasps leaving his mouth. Tony loves it, Steve’s hard cock twitching against his, his slippery chest warm against his. He bites Steve’s collarbone, sucking it lightly and making Steve groan. As Tony turns his eyes back up to him, Steve answers his gaze openly, his mouth hanging slightly open.
There was no denying that the alpha was in a kind of lethargic state, but he made an effort to participate by entangling his fingers into Steve’s hair lightly as Steve kissed his hip.
Steve makes a little choked sound at the playful accusation, unsure if he’s meant to answer. It isn’t true, though, and for a while he loses himself into the thought, even though he knows it’s just play talk.
Steve hears Tony swallow, a surge of empathy hitting him through the bond. Tony’s feeling guilty, he realises.
Tony listens to his and Emmett’s calm breathing, trying to soothe himself with the sound. He’s exhausted, but his mind keeps racing like a wild horse, just like it had been earlier in the workshop.
It’s an absurd thing to have to contemplate at the door of death. Steve has no desire to risk having a god/human hybrid, never mind the mess it would mean between him and Tony if Tony does come back. Tony would understand, though, Steve knows it. Of course he would. But would Steve still be enough for him barren, unable to have more children?
Steve sighed. He hadn’t expected that. Howard had been dead for decades; how was he still ruining things for Tony? Steve had liked Howard in his day enough, but he’d hated learning about how he had been to Tony.
”I didn’t want to betray you”, he says plainly. ”I woke up here, in the medical bay. I’d lost some blood. Apparently, I’m quite a mess inside. The doctor says that the serum might fix it, or it might not. I don’t… it might not just be my ability to conceive that got damaged. I don’t know if anything works anymore, really.”
‘Things’ll be different this time,’ the first one says. ‘This guy is way better with tech than the others were. He’s modified Stark’s tech in the past. He’ll be able to do what we need to the weapons. Then we can defend ourselves when the Spider or the Avengers come knocking.’
Wanda and Strange levitate into the air together, Agatha rising to follow them, the dark light of her magic dancing around her finger tips.
‘Pete? Let’s sleep,’ Wade suggests, pulling him down for another kiss, ‘and your secret is safe with us, I promise.’
‘He what?’ Steve looks over at Tony as he is claimed by an older lady; he obviously says something amusing to her as she gives a loud laugh as he leads her to one side.
you can call him,’ he suggests, spinning out into the corridor and managing to web one of the guys down. ‘Hey Karen is this suit bulletproof?’
,’ Tony sighs, uncrossing his arms as Peter shuts his mouth again and swallows. They’re all quiet again for a few moments. When Tony speaks again his voice is quieter, but still firm. ‘You know everything that happens when you have the suit on is still recorded right? It’s just as a precaution in case something happens to you, we’ve got something to go on. I don’t watch any of it, Pete, I just wait for your reports from the patrols and listen to them instead. You know why? Because I learned I had to trust you to handle yourself, and trust that you would come to me if you needed help.’
‘I like that idea,’ Bucky says, metal arm whirring as it takes most of the strain from the load, ‘then we only have to replace it if it starts to rot.’
Tony barely registers the woman leaving, he’s worriedly watching Wanda who seems to be struggling in the situation. If he had to guess he’d say her powers were picking up on the disappointment from the gathered viewers.
‘She does make a good point,’ Bucky interrupts. ‘And out of everyone here Wanda and I are the ones who best know what HYDRA is capable of
Ororo just laughs and shakes her head. ‘Good luck, T’Challa, and remember you have our support should you ever need it.’
Weasel frowns and takes the disk, looking down at it, then his eyes widen and he looks between Peter and the disk. The other man behind the bar tries to get a look but Weasel closes his fist around it. ‘Piss off and go wipe some tables, Dopinder.’
‘You…no…I should be the king…’ Lautenus grunts, ‘our father always preferred me…I was to carry on his…’
It’s been a month since Wanda and Bucky were taken. A week and a half since Bucky attacked them with Zemo and they moved into the house.
‘It’s the kind of thing you expect him to have mentioned,’ Natasha says quietly from where she’s sat on the counter next to the coffee machine.
‘Mr Wilson? Miss Maximoff would like me to tell you that if you call her abilities ‘freaky mind powers’ again she will make it so you cannot speak for an entire twenty-four hours,’ FRIDAY’s voice intrudes into their moment. ‘She also wants me to tell you to stop panicking, Mr Parker, and to stop overthinking. For one thing you are giving her a headache, and for another she wants to remind you no one is going to slip up outside of the private rooms. She’d also like you to know that you are thinking louder than the boss does, and she would like some sleep at some point tonight.’
The whole team is gathered on the lawn outside of the facility, as Thor and Valkyrie prepare to leave, Loki is preparing himself for the magic he would need to perform and Tony can see Peter bouncing on the balls of his feet in excitement to see some ‘proper’ magic being performed. A term that, he noted, had slight offended Strange and Wong when he’d first said it during a meeting.
A/N: So I may have forgotten quite how long this chapter was and how much of it is taken up by Tony & Peter’s bonding father-son style time.
‘I don’t want your sympathy, Deadpool,’ he snaps, then turns and runs off the building, shooting a web and swinging towards home.
He hadn’t been allowed to meet them when they landed back on American soil. He knows it was Ross’ doing but he lets the man have his small victory. It’s enough for him to know that Scott and Clint are back with their families.
‘That’s because Pete stayed the night at Ned’s and Wanda isn’t up yet. She and Vision went out for dinner last night and didn’t get back until late,’ Tony laughs.
Steve hasn’t spoken much with the man himself since that initial phone call, and he can’t help but feel a little hurt. It’s almost as if Tony doesn’t
‘Does what you feel for Bruce feel like you can work for it with only the hope that he won’t leave again?’ he cuts across her, dark eyes challenging her.
‘Alright, alright, keep your shirt on,’ he cautiously approaches the suit. ‘Hey, uh, think I could, um, come inside?’ The suit opens smoothly, leaving space for him to step backwards into it. ‘Oh man this is so cool. And also terrifying. Hey! What the-’ with the suit now encasing him Clint’s able to see the forms of the trapped people under Hulk through the debris, and the computer immediately starts calculating the best route to get to them. ‘Oh man this is awesome. Why didn’t I ask Tony for one of these before?’
‘Fuck, Pete, trust me when I say that is not it. I can even prove it to you,’ he makes his point by pressing his hips down into Peter’s, his forming erection pressing into Peter’s thigh and making his heart rate speed up and blood run in a similarly southern direction. ‘Pete,’ Wade’s voice has gone quieter and his brown eyes are pleading, ‘please believe me, I’m only sticking by this because of
‘About time,’ he grumbles. ‘Stay out of sight and get the bomb vest off the kid. I’ll keep attention on me as long as possible.’
what I plan to find out. First things first, though, I’m transferring you to my private room and taking on all of your medical care so we can get this sorted. My personal doctor, well I say doctor he’s more a personal friend who ended up becoming a doctor and is the only one who can get me to actually have any form of medical treatment. He’s actually a brain surgeon.’
‘I know,’ she replies with a smile. ‘But I want to come and help you. I know how much you hate these meetings.’
He sees the soldier pause and look towards the door. ‘Tony maybe it would be better if you wait for one of the doctors-’
‘So are you coming?’ Tony asks, standing up and straightening out his jacket. ‘Because we are on a tight schedule if we’re going to make it back in time for dinner, and the big meet where you and Spider-Man have to reveal identities before.’
‘What? No way that’s awesome! What made them come to Earth?’ he asks as they climb into the back of the car.
‘Semi-retirement,’ he grins back at her, ‘I don’t think we’ll be able to keep him away now. I almost feel like he needs to come back to talk to Hammer again, I mean they did turn out to be such
‘Um…guys? What’s Doctor Strange doing? It looks like he’s having a fit,’ Peter says, point at the wizard who is floating cross-legged in mid-air, he’s sporting his new Iron Spider suit. There was no way Tony was letting him come into this without his upgrade.
‘Oh, what like you do by holding back in training?’ Peter turns round to stare down the other man. He feels the tension spike in the room, Bucky’s expression closes down.
‘Don’t worry Steve,’ Wanda says from her spot on the floor. ‘I’m pretty sure it sums up Peter’s love life too.’
‘Well he did a lot with Peggy and, from what I’ve gathered since, Fury as well. His grandson is the Principal at Peter’s school.’
‘Oh,’ and Peter doesn’t need to add any more. Doesn’t need to ask any more. Deadpool’s got a contract, which means he’s going to kill someone.
‘My dear Agent Romanoff, I thought you were one of the best spies in the world. Please tell me you actually know
‘Look, Baby Boy,’ Wade’s the one to try and diffuse the situation, ‘I get what you’re saying, but it’s not like wizard boy has been trying to make friends since we beat Big and Ugly.’
‘I can assure you,’ Loki steps in front of Tony, his Asgardian armour slipping into place, ‘that Odin ensured I answered for my crimes against your people. I can do nothing but ask for forgiveness and a chance to atone for my actions.’
Tony shakes his head. ‘No,’ he replies and feels the muscles underneath him relax, ‘no I was… I was drowning, Steve. First in Afghanistan, then when I came out of the water I was back with Hammer; they put me under again and it was- I was through the portal with the nuke. All I could see was the darkness of space and the Chitauri getting closer, then one… one reached for my chest and,’ he buries himself closer to the chest underneath him and takes a deep breath, ‘Obie was there. Holding the reactor in his hand and watching me-’
‘I mean…it’s just like a bucking bronco right? Maybe I can steer it?’ the youngster responds. ‘Woah! Hey this thing is really crazy!’
‘Peter! Language!’ May shouts from further in the apartment. Ned shushes him as Tony starts to answer, his face is hard and Peter is very glad he’s not the one on the receiving end of that look. If he’d thought Tony had been angry with him before, it was nothing compared to the obvious fury being directed towards that reporter.
‘Good morning, Mr Stark,’ his head lawyer offers his hand to shake, ‘I have already spoken to the courtroom and they have agreed you may come in the side entrance from now on. I apologise they did not allow it this morning.’
‘No fair!’ Deadpool shouts as he swings down. ‘You’ve got webs!’ He yelps as Peter sends a web to stick around his middle and pulls him down after him. Despite laughing at the mercenary’s over dramatic screams, and the look on the robbers’ faces when they see both Spider-Man and Deadpool coming after them, he can’t help but be less excited than he was when he first started the patrol.
‘Buck? Let’s get some air before we meet the others,’ Steve suggests. Bucky just nods and follows him outside.
‘We are not having this conversation every time someone says something to me you don’t like,’ Peter ignores Bucky’s question and pushes past the super soldier. ‘Where’s Wade anyway?’
Natasha’s feels her heart clench at the implied threat and stands up before either of the soldiers can make it worse. ‘We’ll bring you what you deserve, Hammer,’ she says. ‘I’ll send a message when we’re ready to this number.’
‘I think he’s right,’ Wanda’s voice is quiet, her eyes a little glazed. ‘Sometimes, when I’ve been at the edge of what I can control with my powers, like that day when Vis…when I caused the explosion in the training room.’ She takes a breath to get her emotions under control enough to continue speaking. ‘Sometimes it’s felt like there’s a curtain in front of me, and if I can find a way to push it back I can see another reality. Sometimes I think I’ve heard voices from there. I thought maybe it was just my powers going a bit haywire, but…maybe it’s not.’
‘It was a glancing blow that I didn’t manage to duck in time. And I’m not sure what relevance my face has to the question of the extension.’
Steve’s relieved when Emmett’s crying pulls him out of his thoughts. Emmett’s begun to teeth, and Steve spends over an hour walking around the house with a cranky baby in his arms. His heart goes out to the little one and his discomfort, but otherwise he doesn’t mind, much preferring to have a reason to be up instead of staring at the ceiling in bed.
He tries to silence his mind, to stay rational, even though his every cell is screaming at him that he shouldn’t be touched like this. Softly.
”Hm? How’s that, baby?” Tony’s eyes are drilling into Steve’s as he slides against him, squeezing his pecs around his cock, using his own hands to cover for the part Steve’s pecs won’t reach.
Steve turns and looks at Tony, who has lain down. He thinks about how much Tony has withstood and handled by himself these past weeks, how alone he must have been. It saddens Steve to no end, but he can’t change any of that now. The only thing he can do is to try to be better. For Tony, and for their children.
”No”, Tony answers immediately. ”First of all, you’re unselfish almost to a fault. Second, Clint didn’t sacrifice himself for us. He did it for his own family, for everyone. You saw the look in his eyes, Steve. Just like us, he was ready to die for this.”
”Are you mad?” Tony almost cringes at the belligerent undertone in his own voice, but Steve looks completely unaffected.
“Myself”, Steve tells him, and he’s not trying to be Captain Obvious here, he just simply doesn’t know what else to say. ”I don’t know whether I like it or not. I don’t hate it.”
”Steve Rogers, pain in my ass and the bearer of my children both existing and possibly upcoming”, Tony presents, looking from Steve to Peter. ”Spider-kid”, he says, then turns to coo at Kieran: ”And this bellyacher here is daddy’s Kit, yes, shh.”
Steve turns to see Bucky turn into ashes. The reality only starts to sink in as he kneels down to touch the disappearing black flakes. He doesn’t even understand to grieve his best friend at this moment, because there’s only one thing on his mind.
Mostly, though, it was just about the fact that Steve loved making his alpha feel good, and since he knew that it was something that Tony enjoyed, he was happy to provide. He often did it when he took Tony into his mouth, or when Tony was knotting him, and sometimes Tony would growl at him. At first Steve had got startled by it, but he’d learned that the inner battle with his alpha nature was something that Tony found exciting.
The next morning, Steve wakes up to Tony staring at him. He’s already fully clothed and looks like he’s been waiting for a while.
”I don’t know if I should be more concerned about our kids getting excited about a war between us, but according to Kit, I would win”, he says.
”You’ve been good, haven’t you?” Tony says, turning Steve’s head so that he can kiss his way down his throat. ”You deserve a reward, right?”
But now they are broken again, and Tony can’t bring himself to say the three words back, the words he’s said so many times before to Steve.
“Pretty”, Tony observed, looking at Steve displayed on the desk. He took the Vaseline jar and scooped a generous amount of it onto his fingers.
”Good”, he whispered. He then switched to Tony’s right side so that the alpha could put his weight onto his good arm, taking a bottle of lube from the drawer in the process.
Steve hadn’t missed the joke made on his expense, and he had been actually rather humored by it despite his irritation. As saying stupid things went, Tony hadn’t been doing too strongly either that night.
This time Steve manages to actually smile. Tony kisses him again, his fingers caressing Steve’s neck lightly. It’s nice, and Tony can feel himself starting to relax a little. Steve, however, does still seem nervous, so Tony takes his hand, pulling it under the covers gently and bringing it to his own waist. Steve hums a bit, treading his fingers over the hem of Tony’s shirt before slipping them past it to caress his side. It feels good, not just because it’s arousing, but because Tony too had feared he’d never be able to experience this again, to feel Steve’s perfect, tender hands on his skin. It feels safe and familiar, yet makes his nerves tingle excitedly. Steve’s hand moves lower to his hips, and then slides under the thin fabric of his underwear. He avoids touching Tony’s cock, palming his ass instead and Tony can’t help his hips from twitching a little.
Even though Steve’s still feeling light-headed and uncomfortable, the alpha scent around him is making him feel much easier.
”Just Steve is okay”, Tony heard Steve mutter against his cock, and he would have pointed out how fucking lame the joke was, but another finger was being pushed into him and fuck – Steve started fucking him with his fingers, slow and precise and everything Tony had ever wanted from life. His back wanted to arch but it was counter-intuitive, he needed to be still and not bother Steve when he did magic with his fingers. Desperate for some way to relieve the tension that was building up inside of him, Tony gripped the sheets, fisting them in bliss.
”I wish I could say”, Tony answers. ”All I know is that if it is possible, which is honestly highly unlikely from any scientific point of view, I will figure it out.”
”All right”, Tony acknowledges, his lips beginning to curve into a mischievous smile. He slaps Steve’s ass harshly, his other hand holding Steve in place by the hip and making sure that he doesn’t escape from his cock. Steve gasps loudly, but instead of pulling away he pushes towards Tony’s hips hungrily, his eyes going half-lidded in bliss. Tony looks satisfied with this, and he takes an even tighter hold of Steve’s hips with both hands, beginning to fuck him with intent and soon, he’s drawing out unrestrained, almost continuous whining and moaning from Steve. He’s more moving Steve back and forth on his cock than pushing into him, and he obviously relishes in Steve’s pliantness.
A strained noise left Tony’s throat, and Steve could feel through their bond that the praise pleased him. He kissed the behind of Tony’s ear, slowing down his thrusts again. Tony wasn’t usually the best at taking praise, and Steve was prepared to use the opportunity.
He’d also learned that Tony liked the sight of his omega in control once in a while. Mostly he preferred it outside of sex and relished in getting to bend Steve over and making him scream in pleasure after a day of watching him give orders, but sometimes Steve’s authority didn’t drop at the door of their bedroom. Tony was usually ready to let him have the reigns whenever he wanted, whether it was like this or just Steve teasing him for forever before riding him insane.
He picked up a gentle pace and Tony didn’t bite him nor growl at him. Instead, he began emitting soft whines, and Steve loved them. He gave Tony’s neck kisses and held him, breathing in the alpha’s scent.
Steve complies, letting Tony study his face. He feels warm as Tony gives him a smile, then leans to press a kiss onto his temple. Gently, he then wraps his hand around Steve’s throat, coaxing his focus to the mirror again. His other hand strokes Steve’s back, his gaze soaking up the red marks there sluggishly.
”Okay, good”, the therapist cuts in. ”This is easier when we’re all on the same page. So, Tony, what do you think made you react like that to what Steve told you?”
”Just like that?” Thor asks. Steve pictures amusement on his face, but doesn’t see any when he looks back to him.
Steve pulls his fingers away, replacing them with his mouth. As he kisses Tony, he tightens Tony’s tie around his fist and guides his cock to his hole. Tony growls again, trying to kiss him back carefully, and Steve’s heart thumps as he waits to get bit painfully any second.
Tony’s got something passing as clothes on him, and before leaving he comes and presses a quick kiss onto Steve’s forehead.
Tony’s pliantness did everything to light Steve up, and he bit Tony’s earlobe, getting a shaky moan from him in response. He wanted to hear more, and after he really set out to get noise out of the alpha, it didn’t take long for him to get Tony groaning continuously.
”You know how they say that omegas will always listen to their alpha’s authority in the end? In my life that is also called bullshit.”
”Gotta say, I’ve never seen an omega blow a load like you”, Tony mutters jokingly after a while, his fingers playing with Steve’s hair.
”Nothing’s wrong with him. Moomoo just likes daddy a lot.” His foot brushes Steve’s ankle under the table.
”You know what I’m going to do?” Tony pinches his nipples roughly, making Steve jolt, and when he starts to fondle them Steve’s back arches off the bed at how good it feels. He moans, eyes fluttering open to see Tony smiling at him slyly.
The therapist gives him some time to collect himself, before she continues. She asks how Steve feels about coming to the next session together with Tony. Steve is surprised since there’s been no talk of doing that, but he does realise that it makes sense.
But in emotional sense, Steve just wouldn’t, and the way Tony knows it for certain makes him think. What they had, it was bright and sometimes it burned like a raging star, uncaring of the damage it would reap in the process. It had always been fierce, in good and bad both, even before things had really gone to shit. But mostly good. They had been good to each other, and then they’d lost it, and the grief is now slowly destroying both of them. Tony only has to look around to see the evidence.
“I love you too”, Tony muttered, lips pressed to his shoulder, and pushed a slicked finger fully inside of him.
‘Yeah, he’s uh, he’s doing better I guess. Just got to wait for everything they’re pumping him with to actually start working.’
Peter snorts. ‘I’ll leave him and Rhodey do their ‘flying manoeuvres’ and that should keep them both off my back.’
Peter shakes it before turning around to face the kitchenette, realising he may have a problem. ‘Um… we do have bananas right? And ice cream?’
‘So am I, Pete,’ he says, finally looking back at him. Peter’s not sure who moves first, but Wade’s arms are around him and holding him tight against his hard chest, and he’s gripping the man’s hoodie in his hands, burying his nose in the soft material.
Steve just laughs as he moves to cut Sam down. ‘Hey, Steve can you at least catch me before I-’ he’s cut off as he hits the ground next to Quill. ‘Never mind,’ he groans.
‘We’ll go for now. Do give Mr Wilson our best and pass on our message; I’d hate for him to miss out on us helping to rectify what Ajax got wrong,’ the first man says. Peter doesn’t dare look out until he hears the first gun be put away. He fills in Wanda with the conversation while they wait for the coast to clear, and then they head back out.
He sighs and puts his head in his hands. ‘Yeah I know,’ he nods, ‘but I’d rather go back to square one and start from scratch than end up as Ross’ pawn, or worse HYDRA’s.’
‘Oh god, I’m so sorry,’ he starts babbling, ‘I didn’t mean to give away EDITH I just didn’t know what to do and I was feeling-’
dating life, let alone someone else’s. I mean, how do you explain to someone your nephew can bench press a car and not expect them to run for the hills?’
There’s quiet for a few moments. ‘I tried, Sam, but he’s still thinking of leaving after Christmas.’
‘I’m going to assume that last bit is a joke,’ he replies, turning to face the merc. ‘Care to lose the mask?’
‘Well we’ve got enough people that can fly,’ Peter says, ‘why don’t we have Wanda, Vision, me, Sam, Colonel Rhodes and Mr Stark all decorate the tree and Miss Natasha, Captain Rogers and Sergeant Barnes can all do the other outside decorations?’
‘No there’s no word from Peter yet, nor Wade or Happy since they met up with him yesterday,’ Tony sighs. ‘And Fury’s doing his best Pete impression and ignoring my calls.’
Nebula lets out a scream of rage, launching herself at her adopted father, her well-built friend letting out a battle cry of his own and following her, the two of them engaging Thanos. Loki wastes no time, darting forwards and making copies of himself to distract the Titan, as his true form weaves amongst them, grabbing hold of Lorena’s arm and pulling her to safety.
‘Sure you wouldn’t rather be somewhere less chaotic for Christmas?’ Tony laughs as they start heading down towards bed.
The look the bald man gives him that’s been arguing with Wanda nearly has him break stride. ‘Well, well, well. Spider-Man.’
‘I got to admit, Cap,’ Sam pipes up, ‘this is sounding crazy. And I’m used to hearing the stuff that comes out of Tony’s mouth now.’
‘Nothing, I just thought you’d be more of a sun and beaches type holiday than a go trekking through a load of caves holiday.’
‘I was thinking we needed help!’ he snaps back. ‘And Deadpool was the one to get both of us out of that situation at the end, and before that he saved me a couple of times. Not to mention he took my friend up to the jet.’
‘Is it just me,’ Nick Fury says, entering the room, ‘or are we still more interested in fighting each other rather than planning how we will be defending ourselves against the bastard that intends to wipe out half the universe? Now I suggest you all pipe down and sit your arses down so we can start
They don’t say anything else as they continue to move around the outside area, and thankfully no one comes out to disturb them. As the song continues, Steve notices they draw slowly closer together until Tony’s head is resting on his chest, and Steve’s arm is wrapped around his waist. When the song changes they stop moving, but neither moves away. Tony doesn’t move his head from where it’s resting against his chest, looking to one side.
Peter sighs and nods. ‘Alright. But if I get any broken bones you can explain them to May,’ he points a finger at Steve and then checks his shooters before putting the mask on. The eyes go black and he can’t see anything. For a moment he has to fight down panic, until he hears Steve giving instructions to the rest of the team to take a seat at the side.
‘Rhodey, Vision get round the back and see if you can spot the other hostages. Wanda I may need your help but keep out of sight,’ he says quietly, then turns to address the terrorist. ‘If this is some way of telling me I have a long lost kid, I got to admit it’s one I haven’t seen before. Bit dramatic though.’
‘I’m so installing the Macarena into your armour,’ he grumbles as he stands up. ‘Sorry kids, Daddy’s sending me to bed.’
‘Sam got knocked out when the attack happened, the paramedics are seeing to him now and he’s just come round. But…Clint they took,’ she feels her throat close up and forces the words past the painful lump, ‘they took Bucky and Wanda.’
‘Don’t know what you’re talking about,’ Tony waves her off. ‘So what’s got you wound up over Bruce?’
‘I’m not about to give up all of my secrets, Nat, you should know better than that,’ he laughs, sending another of the smoke bombs to land near the air conditioning and setting it off, having FRIDAY put the extraction power of the unit up to full to see how much more he’ll have to add in order to overpower the system.
Steve’s head shoots up at those words. ‘Wait, what? You care about him as in… what more than a friend?’
‘A little loose but nothing a belt won’t fix- ow! Give a guy some warning,’ Wade grumbles as the aforementioned item of clothing hits him in the chest. ‘You know I’m still kind of getting used to the fact that very few of you seem bothered by my scars. There’s not many people would let me try on new clothes around them.’
‘Oh yeah. Oops. Sorry, Doc.’ Strange waves him off and Tony notices the weariness in the doctor’s movements. ‘Steve? Grab the doc a chair would you?’
A/N: So finally some Spideypool action! Sorry I know it's taken a while for the relationship side of this story to really take off. Now all we have to do is get Tony back and the Stony can take off.
‘I’d just take that as a yes, Spangles,’ Tony laughs, ‘I’m sure we’ll find some time to hang out in the lab around training.’
‘I’ll come with you,’ Bruce says, following behind them. ‘I might be able to give some suggestions to the doctor and can start getting him set up while our friend here goes to find the doctor.’
‘Thanks Betty,’ he smiles at her. ‘I, uh…probably shouldn’t try for another hug seeing as I nearly cracked Harry’s ribs.’
of trees to cut down; Tony’s got FRIDAY on standby with drones to come pick up each tree as we cut it down so you’ve got to choose at
‘Yeah, yeah, fine,’ he pants as he manages to find his feet and tries to put some distance between him and his opponent. His brain is spinning and he can’t place things like he had been. Where was Vision? Where were the rest of the team? He can’t place things like he had and he moves his head around trying to catch on to
So this chapter is more setting up where the sequels are going to be taking us. I am intending to cover Infinity War and End Game (as long as I'm not too emotionally distraught after watching it!), and have a couple of ideas for stories coming after them as well. Do let me know if there's anything you'd like to see in them by the way! I'm still trying to think of special ideas as well.
he thinks bitterly. So he’s more than a little surprised at the metal fist connecting with his face and sending him sprawling from where he’s been sitting at the breakfast bar.
‘Wait you blew up a cupboard in the science lab making a new version of your web fluid and still managed to get away with it?’ Tony asks, pushing open the door to the common area.
‘I’m not pretending,’ and there’s nothing in Tony’s voice to suggest he’s lying, ‘whether you believe it or not I consider you a friend now, Loki. And I’d like to know what happened with Bucky to make you get as far away from him as you are physically able right now. You two seemed to be getting on better since we got here.’
The door opens behind them. ‘Tony don’t you dare tell me you went ahead and talked about the damn band,’ Steve’s frustrated voice comes from the doorway.
‘You’ve not got a suit, Steve,’ Tony reminds him, ‘you going to be alright letting me take the biggest hits since mine is here?’ He taps his reactor.
Secondly, I hope you all enjoy this chapter. Please do let me know what you think I promise to respond to reviews much quicker this week.
‘You,’ Wade’s still looking stunned as Peter begins to make his way up the stairs. ‘How are you okay with this, Spidey?’ he gestures to his face.
‘Is he happy with the Accords?’ Rhodes asks, taking a seat at the bar as Tony pours the three of them a drink. He nods in response.
There’s a couple of moments quiet again. Then Bucky breaks it. ‘You remember Jacques blowing up that tank by rolling under it and strapping the bomb underneath?’
They continue chatting as they continue through the rows of trees, pointing out the odd one that looks promising before moving on once they decide it’s not actually what they want.
‘I’ll explain in a minute,’ is the answer the soldier gets. ‘I’ve got someone who has apparently appeared from a different dimension, along with some of his enemies, but I don’t trust him, and I need someone I trust to work alongside him.’
‘I know,’ he cuts her off. ‘None of us can really. Especially with the new Accords hanging over our heads. That’s why I said:
A/N: Hi everyone! I am so sorry I'm late updating this week, we've had no internet for half the week so I've not been able to update. As an apology I'm putting up a second chapter in a couple of minutes so I'll do a longer note there. Thank you so much to all my readers, for everyone who has left kudos and for my wonderful reviewers who, if I haven't got round to replying to you yet I will at some point today.
‘Peter!’ he looks over at Wanda’s shout and leaps up to give her a hug as she runs over to him. ‘How long have you been back?’
Steve scowls at him. ‘Remind me to spend the entire evening when we get back telling nothing but embarrassing stories of you.’
‘Peter I just don’t think you’re in the right place mentally to be trying something like this right now,’ Sam argues.
,’ Sharon’s voice is laced with venom. ‘If she meant so much to you why did you not come to her funeral?’
Tony laughs and gestures to the desk, where a small black box is sitting. ‘One step ahead of you, kid.’
Tony laughs. ‘Oh yeah, she always used to give me the odd bit of advice on how to deal with people asking questions you didn’t want to answer. Being a woman in her line of work through the war and afterwards, she was well used to those kinds of questions. Best two pieces of advice she ever gave me: give them a diverting comment when you don’t want to answer them; and the right clothes can be just as good as a suit of armour.’
‘Mmm… Merry Christmas, Steve,’ he says, finally opening his eyes to look up at the blond. ‘Now how about you give me a proper Christmas wake up?’ Another rumbling chuckle from Steve and the soldier leans down to capture his lips in a bruising kiss.
Steve laughs and goes to sit next to Wade on the sofa. ‘Why don’t you take a look at the first page? That might make things a bit clearer.’
‘Hmm,’ Peter is sure Mama doesn’t fully believe them, then she catches sight of the man hiding behind him. ‘Is this the young man Tony was telling me about? This is your friend, Peter?’
Peter can’t help the small smile at his friend’s awe. ‘Yeah course we do, now come on. Bucky stop looking like you want to kill someone and grab Peter’s bag before I tie you to the back of the car and drag you home.’
Sam sits with the rest of the team that’s been left behind, listening to the comms as Tony, Steve, Wanda and Natasha deal with the attack on the chemical factory. It looks like it’s the same people that had taken Peter hostage, hence why a small number of the team had been called in.
‘And then Black Widow turned up to our Decathlon team meeting to pick up Pete and you should have seen how green Flash went,’ Betty chuckles.
‘She’s been like a second mother to me,’ he replies, leaning against his boyfriend. ‘I’m glad Rhodey convinced her to come. She’s going to do enough mothering of this team to get us through the next year.’
‘What do you think I’ve been doing for the best part of a year, Rhodey? How the hell do you think everyone is sitting here in this room right now?’
‘If you say so Tony,’ Steve chuckles. ‘Come on we better get a move on or else one of them will be coming down so we can all start decorating. The look on Wanda’s face when we agreed we wouldn’t do the Christmas tree last night! I thought she was going to murder someone.’
‘Oh and can you start teaching me other languages? Like I know Spanish but I think I’d like to know more, just think it’d be really useful.’
‘Well you did make it so easy I thought it’d be rude not to. Not so taken with your welcoming committee though. I mean what happened? Are evil schemes just not so profitable any more that you can’t afford to get some staff?’
‘I want to hear it from you,’ he whispers. ‘Come on, Spangles, you’re making me nervous. Let’s start with some of the easy stuff: is there anything I need to be worried about other than my hand and the reactor?’
‘Shit, no way,’ the man pushes him back and looks at him and Peter remembers he doesn’t have his mask. Deadpool is seeing him for the first time. ‘You- you’re-’ he’s cut off by the sound of more men coming closer on the floor below them. ‘Shit. Get out of here and get your fucking mask on, Spidey. I’ll hold them up as long as I can. Old Tin Can’s holding his own for now.’
‘You didn’t have to,’ he says, opening the small box and finding a handmade woven brand, there’s a flatter part of the rope-like material that has his name engraved on it.
Loki nods. ‘Yes but we can’t delay much longer or I won’t be able to sustain it; I’ll be exhausted afterwards, but it’ll be nothing that rest cannot cure. You remember where you will arrive?’
‘Not when you feel you have a duty to perform you aren’t,’ Wong argues, ‘you put your duty before your health. So we are stepping in.’
Bucky laughs and shakes his head. ‘No I said I’d drop by on my way back from training and hurry you along. Or would you rather a hyperactive Peter does the honours?’
‘Are you sure this is a good idea, Peter?’ his AI asks. ‘Shouldn’t you wait for the rest of the team?’
He kissed the underside of Tony’s jaw, tasting a hint of sweat on his skin. It only made him more desperate.
Life is perfect while he’s carrying. At first, it’s hard to stay out of world-saving business, but as he gets used to staying at home, Steve finds himself enjoying the life. He spends his days drawing, sleeping, and catching up on culture from the decades he’s missed.
Tony doesn’t hesitate to place his hand on the one Steve has offered, not when Steve looks so broken and just giving him this seems to be everything to him.
He has a lot of things he has to tell Tony, and he goes to look for him in the medical bay, finding Emmett sleeping in there. Tony steps into the room just moments after him.
Steve breaks into tears, turning away from Tony, who stares at his shaking shoulders, feeling numb. He’s been there to comfort Steve until this moment, but there is no room for both of their pain in him now, and so he doesn’t say or do anything. He just listens to Steve’s crying with a frown on his face.
Tony hums in affirmation. ”And is that how we play?” he asks, tightening his grip even more. Steve gasps in pain.
”Are you done?” Steve goes on. He knows that he’s making a scene when everyone else is trying their best, but the taste of venom is too sweet in his mouth. At least he’s being seen.
Steve forces a deep breath into his lungs. Tony gets up and picks Kieran into his arms in an accustomed manner, pressing him against his chest and hushing at him. Kieran isn’t having it, though.
He considers talking to Bruce. But Bruce isn’t a physicist, and even if he was, he would most likely just laugh. He does talk to Reed Richards, because he simply can’t not, and Reed doesn’t laugh. He at least acts like he takes Tony seriously, but provides nothing of use, and the way he asks Tony if he’s okay at the end of the phone call makes Tony wonder if the man’s just been humouring him.
Steve’s gaze meets Tony’s, his eyes welling again. ”Because I love you more than anything, and I think I forgot just how much, forgot that you are the most important thing in my life. I promise I won’t ever let that happen again, Tony, if you just give me the chance.”
Tony’s not giving himself enough credit, as always. Then again, pot meet kettle, Steve guesses when he thinks about it.
”Oh my fucking GOD”, Tony shouts, slamming both of his fists against the countertop. Steve looks at him impassively.
Tony tugs at his hair, making Steve wince a little, and it’s good, so good. Everything becomes comfortably numb, and there’s nothing else but the overwhelming physical sensation of Tony hammering into him. It’s rough and ugly, but there’s no malevolence in the air. If there was, the bond would give it away.
”Just fuck me, Tony”, he spits out. He’s lying there with his ass presented and Tony’s just watching him, most likely with a pitying look on his face. Shame is quickly beginning to burn Steve’s cheeks. This was a mistake.
”Take good care of oma”, Steve hears Kieran whisper into Tony’s ear as they hug, and Tony chokes out a little laugh, sharing a look with Steve over Kieran’s shoulder. The boys know about Steve’s enhanced senses, but they still don’t often quite grasp what it means when it comes to their own volume of speech. Which is rather convenient, of course.
”Take him, too”, he says, opening his eyes and offering the baby from his arms. He doesn’t really want to give the baby away, but he’s afraid of falling asleep and failing to support him.
With a growl, he quickens his pace, making Steve moan loudly. Mine, Tony’s mind provides, and there’s an instant response, a sense of full submission through the bond from Steve. It takes hold of Tony’s entire core, and he can feel how it’s demanding his knot to pop. With the way Steve’s whining and clenching around him, this isn’t going to last long.
