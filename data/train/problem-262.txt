He seemed too tired to object to being shown to Sherlock’s bed, and collapsed in short order. By the time the sofa was made up, and the wood stove fired up with John’s trainers set underneath to dry, there was no sound in the cabin but the rising wind.

“Well, last time we talked about it at all, we figured she’d be ready for school next fall. She’d had that bad patch when she turned three, and didn’t want to be in daycare at all. We never figured out whether that was because of the kids, or the place, or if it was a fluke or a phase or what.”
Still Sherlock’s move, then. He bent down, paused; everything about this felt so charged that he thought he might collapse when he touched first his lips and then the point of his tongue to just the corner of John’s mouth. A little groan escaped him, embarrassingly loud in the silence. John turned his head a fraction and kissed him full on the mouth.
Update: I made a "getting to know you" collection:
After the nineteenth gentle snub from August, I cornered Holmes the next time we met to dance. We’d worked out a sequence of knockout moves for an Argentine tango, and it was starting to come together.
He leaned forward and gave me the gentlest kiss, first at the corner of my mouth, and then as I turned to him, full on the lips. Every nerve ending in my body, every neuron in my brain, lit up, and I was weightless and dizzy.

Before the last word was out Sherlock was kissing my mouth, answering the question without speaking, for a very long time. His kiss was both tender and firm, and his tongue caressed mine with a meaning I couldn’t mistake. For a long time this chased all thought from my mind: for so long I’d thought we’d never have this, ever. So we kissed, held each other, kissed again.
Ash and her family would be stopping in soon, so the contact lenses went back in as John did the washing-up and chanted a mnemonic bit of nonsense: “Will Will will what I will, or will I will what Will wills?”
When I’d given all the non-verbal signals I could and Roberto had tactfully retreated into sleep, the sensory loop in my head spun into frenzy. I didn’t just see John, I heard him, smelled him, all but felt him, years and years of John, real memories, daydreams, erotic fantasies, hideous memories of times when he was furious with me, moments when I wanted him and nearly hated him for not knowing or not caring, certainly hated myself for not being sure which, for not knowing how to extinguish my emotions and my desires.
. I’d hit a nerve. A mate would’ve swatted my arm in annoyance; Holmes always went straight in with a verbal attack. I just tipped my head to demand an answer.
Instead of growling I smiled, and said more calmly, “Sorry I shouted. But Sherlock, you do have feelings. You

He told me that when they sat down he took her hand, not flirtatiously, and asked: “Molly, are you happy for me?”
And a phrase in Gaelic, no doubt equally formulaic.
In his homeless network, there were some whose identity had fallen victim to how others saw them, once they fell into the abyss.
Her hand still lay on my arm, even as I was patently turning to leave the surgery. Was she seriously still refusing to take no for an answer?
With Roberto—none of this. He chose
“Now I just have to live through that damned anniversary.” Why was that a burden, now that he knew Sherlock was alive?
He was tall and muscled; first time he helped me up at a crime scene it was like I weighed nothing at all. Much more solid than my dance partner, and a lively stare, so much warmer than Holmes’. Well, Watson seemed satisfied with his man, but August was much more appealing, and infinitely more sexy.
All gratifying, none helpful. I breathed in as deeply as I could, in two sharp inhales.

Another thing I learned: Sherlock is in fact above taking advantage of my anxiety and guilt. He really is kind, that way.
Any one weird circumstance could have had an innocent explanation; two was a stretch. All of them together: what kind of an idiot did he take me for?
John’s looking at Sherlock now, trying to make him see but it’s clear that he doesn’t, he’s stuck in the story where it’s all his fault because it was in his power to make it all go differently.

I knew Mycroft would read the two of us like an open book, but I’d no idea that even Lestrade would grin when he saw us come in. Donovan’s eyes widened and then she looked away, lips quirking. So much for our attempt at nonchalance.
Sherlock looked on patiently, waiting for me to hear that what I’d just given him was a bullshit reason. More a rationalisation than a rationale.
How could I react to that? All that time ago—before Mary ran, before she died, before John had cut me out and beat me, before all the drugs—all that time ago, John knew that the marriage was over because it was me that he wanted. And with that knowledge he’d done nothing, absolutely nothing.
Despite his unease, the fiddle was behaving, the music was behaving, the ornaments were falling back into place, and he was lost in it all when the door to the flat opened and Ash walked in.
Fine. I wasn’t going to object on principle with so much at stake. Whoever was following me was going to have to up their game to keep up with whomever Mycroft would send.

February was difficult, after that. I tried to keep myself on an even keel, and didn’t involve Sherlock. At some level I felt this was my problem to solve; I’d somehow turned my jealous rage on him, and talking it over with him wasn’t going to help. He’d give me a pass, every time. Ella never did, and that’s what I needed: to be made to face up to it. For all Sherlock says I’m a terrible actor, I think I kept my turmoil to myself.
“I meant no insult, John. You’ve done very well. They may be counting on you communicating something to Sherlock—if they’re not certain he’s alive, they may think that alarming you is the best way to settle that open question.”
Because Roberto is also discreet, and he could imagine that no one could be less welcome there and then than he.

It wasn’t until Rosie turned four that I started to notice her, well, exceptional talents. While most parents think their children are exceptional, I’d been doing the opposite: taking for granted abilities that, when you put them all together, really were a bit startling for her age.
John trusted the man no further than he could throw him, but he was almost certain that Mycroft was telling the truth. His unease was far more convincing than the grief and remorse he’d put on for John’s last visit.
My breath tightened. I could all but hear that low voice, and it made my knees buckle.
John’s third request, another four weeks on, had been a song from the first world war. It was strangely intimate for the scenario it was supposed to narrate: a soldier missing his dead friend. The melody, too, was a bit saccharine.
— That can be arranged. OK, a special date night. A sitter for the sprog, an evening at the Landmark, some dancing after.
“Which do you want first? Vows, or our first married sex?” Always knowing when I was overwhelmed, John; he was trying to lighten the tone.
and fades away like morning dew"
The cab deposited him in front of a sedate address in stately Fotheringay Crescent, where two unmarked police cars were the only sign of a disturbance. The Met coddling the sensibilities of the well-to-do, Sherlock thought dourly. He bounded up the steps and through a massive and pretentious door, stopping short in the hallway at the sight of Greg Lestrade.
We quickly exhausted the charm of the stalls in the main piazza, and instead spent the morning poring over the used and vintage section of the market set up along and in the park across the road. Sherlock found something that he negotiated and acquired so surreptitiously that it was clearly a birthday present. I found something for him, too: an antique surgical implement in a heap of old farm tools. The seller spoke mangled but confident English, and I felt quite chuffed at paying junk rates for my find when it actually had considerable value—not monetary but sentimental. This would be Sherlock's souvenir of this visit: a trepanning tool, very romantic.
The broken little sound he made as his hand curved around my desperate, almost painful, erection, his fingertips on the underside, grazing my bollocks—I could only make the same sound back at him. All our clothes were gone now, no more obstacles. I pushed Sherlock gently down onto the bed, swung my right leg over him and put his hands up over his head, holding them so I could see all of him, chest and arms and throat and his luminous, yearning face.
One day in early January they were in the morgue, Sherlock and this Roberto, pelting me with questions as I tried to examine the Kensington copycat victim. Before I could answer any question Sherlock had already answered it (adding “of course” or “obviously”) and passed on to the next. I could see the amazement building in Roberto Zanardi’s face as Sherlock performed his usual deduction sequence at a dead heat. From a kind of bemused immobility Zanardi shifted into a focused stare of admiration, and Sherlock responded to it with suspicion, then tentative gratification.
“Do you remember, the first nights we spent together, that you asked me what would happen if this didn’t last?”
John quizzed Sherlock on the planets they passed, gave him news of Mrs Hudson and Molly and Lestrade, and stiffly practised saying “Will.” It sounded absurd.
Sherlock didn’t look pleased, the way he used to do when I admired him. Instead, he sighed. “So, freakish after all.”
I cleared my throat. It was painful even to remember what it felt like to lose John. “But you were so angry and distant.”
I feign boredom. “Oh very well, Doctor Needy, if I must.”
His breath hissed inward as my hand again strayed close to his flies, and I was fascinated, eager to explore what might come of having many fewer layers of clothing between us. He smelled good, he felt good—firm but flexible, taut, not brawny—and he looked frankly good enough to eat. I meant to. I whispered that to him for the pleasure of seeing him gasp and swallow.
After a few moments he remembered Warren, scanned the street for the mobile, and found it a few feet away. He put it back to his ear. How could he tell a stranger on the phone that their—spouse? partner? family member?—was dead?

As so often happens with Sherlock, then, I had a choice that wasn’t really a choice. I could press him for confidences he very clearly didn’t want to make, and disturb the otherwise lovely harmony that seemed to be not just prevailing but growing.
But she surprises him with a quick riposte: “Sherlock Holmes,
So after tea, as Julian was collecting the photographs for scanning and the thumb drive with the updated files of prose and data, Sherlock stood briskly and looked expectantly at Julian. Who wasn’t moving. Oh.

If nothing else, the two-week intervals seemed an invitation to reply to him. To
“May I ask—if you thought John and I might be together, why did you ask—you know.”
Nothing that night either, or the next day. Mary could tell he was increasingly anxious, and finally made him spill the fact that he’d reached out to Sherlock and received no response.
“We’re going to Sicily, remember?”
Is that how love works? You’ve done everything for me, for my well-being, my family. You sacrificed so much. And now you’ve gone away again from the life you love, the people who care about you, the Work, London, even your violin. You loved me to the edge of your own destruction, while you thought I didn’t want you.
“And he couldn’t let us know that he was alive.”
Well, of course he wasn’t literally waiting. He was settling in. Getting to know the city as a resident, not a tourist. Refreshing his (already extraordinary) language skills by pursuing his extensive and idiosyncratic interests. He’d found a place to take fencing lessons—in Italian, of course. He’d begun exploring underground sites in the city, catacombs, sewers, cellars, passageways. To my astonishment he was memorising the street map of Rome, and he seemed to have the underground sites mentally mapped beneath the street names.
The closest I got to being direct with Holmes was when I said, “So, you really think this is going to work. Tell me why, again? I mean, he might not even agree to come.”

I’ve slid the fingers of my right hand under his left arm and stroked his armpit, hard enough to tickle him, but more importantly to make my fingers smell of him. His sleepy sweat, the tang of arousal. He goes rigid with embarrassment when I bring my fingers to my nose and breathe deep, despite my evident pleasure when I catch his scent.
“Never what?”
“For example, how she says ‘Ba’ in forty different ways, and you understand every one of them.” The triumph in his voice was audible.
was your plan? It seems to have worked, whatever it was.”
When she’d taken herself off upstairs to phone home and change out of her meeting attire, Sherlock turned to John with a glare he knew wasn’t for him, put earbuds in his phone and rang Ciaran.
It was eight months after the unforgettable Met Gala fundraiser, where I came back to dancing in public after years of pretending I didn’t miss it. Eight months since Sherlock Holmes and I came out as dance partners; since the amount we raised came out to be five times the amount in the fund; and since John Watson came out—to himself, I think, as much as to anyone else.
I pull back, indignant. “I would never say anything so irrational. I said every person has a perfect lover—a profile of temperament, intellect, appearance, experience, what have you, perfectly balanced or perfectly complementary—but I never said that that perfect lover necessarily
“Now you’ve got me curious.” John too was trying for casual, because he only sounded tired, not curious at all.
He wasn’t listening anymore, he was already in it up the elbows, annoying the Scene of Crimes officers and entertaining John Watson mightily. I had to admit, he could be fun, in his own weird way.
, holding John’s hips so hard he’d leave bruises as they both came with a hoarse grunt and collapsed together to kiss, again and again.
Sherlock has looked away. In the afternoon light his dark hair exaggerates his pallor, the tight hunch of his shoulders. After a moment he looks back at John.
The event was winding down without my having gathered much more about the school than I had from the headmistress—beyond the sense that music, at least, was a regular part of the curriculum. That boded well. I said goodbye to Nicola, caught Sherlock’s eye, and met him in the corridor to walk home.
And with sweeter memories came greater pain. This time he couldn’t tell himself he’d been forced to leave John by circumstances beyond his control; no, he’d had to leave because he’d made himself hateful to John, unforgivable. Treated him cavalierly, at the very least. He couldn’t blame Moriarty for it: he’d lost John all by himself.
Was that what I was scared of? Scaring him off? Or was it the opposite: leading him on? It was both. It was neither. It was ... everything. Everything about this scared me.
Well, who else? It wasn’t just that I only had one; so far as I could tell, he really only had one as well.
So I played along. “Have him come here, then. We have to discuss terms.”
, say any of it to you with them watching, it was too private. So I tried to tell you without words, make you laugh one last time.”
If I’d thought that talking about the Fall now was safe, just a cleanup operation, I was wrong. I’d never be finished being wrong, it seemed. John was breaking and I couldn’t help. Every word I said was hurting him more, and I could lose him still. After being so warm in sleep he was cold, his skin all gooseflesh, his face a mask of suppressed anger and sorrow.

be done with you.”
“Very well, then. Vengeful. Driven.” Mycroft sounded impatient, then continued, more gravely. “The Met has to investigate the vehicular homicide because it was utterly public. But in many ways it is not the real case here. We know something about why it was done, and we will share all the intelligence we have. The real case now is finding Will Simpson, ensuring his survival, and retrieving and deposing him, to bring this criminal organisation to trial. You, Sherlock, will work with Sergeant Donovan on this.”
My violin, my syringe.
What had happened seemed both fair and monstrously unfair.
Over my dead body.
I raised my eyebrows, signaling receptivity.
I can’t bear it, I nearly get out of my chair and go upstairs. I stop myself. There may be no right way to handle this, but I have a strong suspicion there’s definitely a wrong way.

But some coded messages are utterly opaque, meant to be clear to you and you alone. Like the songs you play that have lyrics far too telling, so you play them on the violin all filigreed around with ornamentation, so stretched or compressed with rhythmic variation, that their very composers couldn’t pick out the melody line. You play them plangently and insistently. Safely, knowing their revealing lyrics that strip your heart bare and fling it on mortifying display in the middle of the sitting-room rug are as well-concealed as the literal organ inside your chest.

“Well, he’s not Lestrade, he’s a different kind of policeman. He’s in the Guardia di Finanza, not the ordinary police, certainly not homicide. His area is organised crime, international crimes like smuggling and human trafficking. He was only involved in the London murder because the victim was one of the targets in a large-scale sting operation. So no, I didn’t accompany him to crime scenes, and I didn’t shadow him at work. I saw him afterwards.

As the hall filled (for a certain value of “filled”) it looked like any one of a dozen venues he’d followed the band to: hardwood floors that looked well-danced-on, a broad but shallow stage, older volunteers taking tickets and distributing programs; and now of course, masks and disinfectant gel for the unequipped. The lights went down, Ash’s signature sparkle went up, and the band launched into “The Rocky Road to Dublin.”

are happy with him. And able to entrust Rosie to him.”
“He didn’t look anything like I imagined, you know. I expected someone like you.”
John had stood, come around the table, and practically pulled me up by my elbows to stare into my eyes as he said this. I understood that he wasn’t only thinking of all that we’d suffered at Moriarty’s hands, and Magnussen’s, and Smith’s. He was thinking of Roberto, thinking that it was the distance between us that resulted in my departure for Italy. And my presence in the bed of my first real lover, when John had always, consciously or not, intended to be that man.
Molly looked at me dubiously, her mouth turned down, and then she asked, “Well, aren’t you?”

I didn’t waste a second examining the body; Sherlock could scold me later. I just left the handgun, wiped carefully to remove any prints, and exited the way we’d both come in, from the back. Any minute now Mycroft and Sherlock and a few agents or some combination of these would be swarming in, and my presence there would be a complication for Mycroft.
My Ba, who has structured my own days so carefully and affectionately, had rebelled at being herded—I could imagine that.

Sherlock’s face went both chastened and sulky, always an unfairly irresistible look on him. John couldn’t fling up his hands for the carrier bags, so he went into the kitchen to sort the latter and try to think about dinner.

They leave the floor and John heads for Sherlock, now leading his partner to her table. They smile at each other with an air of complicity that leaves John again secretly thrilled at how kind Sherlock is beneath it all, how he reads people beneath their surfaces. He asks for an introduction, resolving to learn the DCI’s name and retain it. Diana: he won’t pigeonhole her again. He smiles warmly and they leave her to her companions, all earnestly complimenting her on the tango.
He shook my hand too, and that was supremely strange: his hands had been all over me, and mine all over him, and here we were, uncomfortable strangers feigning composure as we said goodbye again. I thought, wrongly, that it would be for the last time.
“Like the ... really tired. And really happy. I hope you weren’t miserable on the sofa. If I hadn’t been so knackered I’d have argued. I fit there better than you.”
It was terrible, and I said as much. “They look so exhausted. The cold is so draining.”
“No worries, I’ll see about getting you stirred up again when I get home.”
“Hey.” His voice was drowsy and contented. It sounded good when he said it, so I gave it a try.
The words were romantic, but his tone was matter-of-fact.

question, he stilled. Completely. His heart didn’t, though. It raced under my cheek and I felt my face getting hot and red. His voice came out a little reserved. “I don’t want to talk about that. Truly. It was sex, John. Vigorous. Instructive. But private. And ultimately, irrelevant to you and me. And if you would accept some friendly advice—I’ve had a great deal of practice in this area—don’t think on it. That way madness lies. It happened. It ended.

To judge by their paws they were going to be quite large dogs, so tiny-cute-dog names were out. Sherlock assured me that to Optimise Canine Cognition (I heard the upper-case), ideal dog names are bisyllabic and accented on the first syllable, with the second syllable something like –y or –er.

that you’d suppress any trace of his request.”
He let his left hand cover John’s balls, his right hand touch—finally!—the erection he’d dreamed about for so long, and John let out a very different groan, delighted and desirous.
The time passed much faster than Sherlock had expected, and he hurried home inspired to revisit the project and update it. To do that, though, he had to unearth two file-folders with new data he’d never added to the website.
John only said, “Well, call
He needed help. He needed me. I left 221B for the nearest pub, and in the privacy of the toilet there I phoned Mycroft and told him to get me to Belgrade, Belfast, Belgravia, wherever the actual fuck Sherlock was summoning me from.
“Thank you, Sergeant.” He made sure his own tone was appropriate, and reveled again in John’s approving expression.
It wasn’t fair of me. It wasn’t rational. And I didn’t give a good goddamn. If Sherlock woke up and spoke to me I was going to say something horrible. And even in this bizarre frame of mind I didn’t want to do that.
“Indeed.” Mycroft nodded. “I pointed out that Moran was quite possibly doing the same thing; Morstan would use John to draw you out of hiding, and then Moran could kill you both as well as Morstan, making her the villain.”

There were worse places to be than London in June. This was a particularly cooperative June, too, and it was a pleasure to be outdoors.

I hadn’t been at all ready to find Zanardi in easy possession of the sitting room while Sherlock showered, let alone ready for what came afterwards. Shades of the nauseating day Janine had slipped out of Sherlock’s bedroom, lorded it over me in the kitchen and then joined him in the bathroom, his deep rolling chuckle echoing in the hallway. But this was clearly a crisis—not a feint, as Janine had been. As soon as Zanardi had left I’d lost my temper, we’d shouted and sniped at each other, and Sherlock had essentially severed our friendship.
She looked uncertain, at least as far as he could make out between the tears and blotches; but she mopped at her eyes again when the street door opened downstairs and John’s voice called up, “Hey, where’s the music?”
It was something of a guilty distraction, then, when Lestrade mentioned a series of sexual assault cases—acquaintance rape—in central London. The rapist was circulating through a roster of nauseatingly loud dance clubs, and although Lestrade hadn’t made any explicit request, I was sure he was hinting that I could check it out. Unofficially. I’d have to modify my usual appearance, but going out dancing sounded like exactly what I needed, and John needn’t come, as I knew he hated the whole thing.

Sherlock smiles serenely. “No, I won’t. I already blocked myself out of all the numbers I didn’t want to dance, and just left a few open for the fundraising. I’m not that comfortable doing ballroom dance with strangers.”
“Yeah, almost. Listen, though. I’m calling about Sherlock.” Not exactly a smooth segue, that.

Near the hotel he swerves into a whisky bar and a few minutes later fetches up at the counter with a bottle and, apparently, two glasses. When he’s paid I know there’s another reckoning due.
. Well, I wasn’t going to ask this prick for information about Sherlock’s movements.
“You’re thinking about Roberto.” I say his name for the first time in two months. So much for a marriage proposal.
I withdrew and rested my cheek against his arse, panting, “
“Sorry, could you repeat? I, uh, got distracted.” My face felt hot.
Reading John’s last texts Sherlock spins around, his coat fanning out behind him, looks up across sixty feet of vertical space and finally sees him. John’s eyes are wide and intent; his white face in the penumbra of the station is unsmiling but eager. A second of hesitation and Sherlock is racing for the escalator, leaping up the high steps to gain five seconds against the clattering mechanism. As the slotted metal steps flatten out he lunges, bulleting into John’s chest and pulling him in hard until John’s arms lift and circle Sherlock’s waist.
The next morning, the familiar breakfast room again intensified the impression of temporal overlay I'd had the evening before. Once again Sherlock spurned the vast majority of the breakfast offerings, accepting only a cappuccino and one slice of some kind of cake, while I piled my tiny plate with everything that looked nutritious and enticing—and then filled another.
This whole evening has something of the surreal about it, John thinks, tugging uncomfortably at the black tie at his neck. He doesn’t like formal dress, though he can carry it off reasonably well by adopting a more than usually military posture—but the tie he flatly loathes, and he tortures it at every opportunity. Why he and Sherlock have to be part of this absurd charity do at the Met is beyond him. They don’t socialise with Lestrade’s colleagues, most of whom think the consulting detective and his blogger a dodgy pair at the best of times.
He took me back to Bologna and said I wasn’t allowed to freeze and shut him out in silence. He required that I declare that we were finished, and why.
He didn’t say anything when I escorted him into the cab, my hand as protective on his waist and elbow as though the blood on him had been his own. He didn’t say anything as we rode to my house, Mary’s and my house, well, Rosie’s and my house now. I wished I could take him to Baker Street, settle him in there in his own environment; but Fred wasn’t going to be free much beyond five o’clock, and I couldn’t imagine leaving Sherlock alone in the flat in this state, even just to go back and fetch Rosie over.
Con'd from ch. 16
But evidently he’s underestimated a mother’s laser eye for a child’s potential partner. He’d have had to try considerably harder than he’s been doing to deflect her attention, and Elena’s reluctant formality hardens to near-rigidity as the meal wears on. Her questions are more pointed than even her son can welcome, and more than once “Robbie” reroutes the conversation, trying to spare Sherlock unease or Elena an open snub. It’s an uncomfortable experience, and it’s something of a relief all round when the dining room fills up with local residents and the noise level spikes.

This is the last chapter of Part One, "Incomplete."
She was working herself up again, poor girl, her voice trembling, her breath stuttering, and he took her tea mug before it could slosh on her jeans and the sofa.
As if on cue, a brazen clangour pealed out that I thought would explode the walls and bring the roof down on our heads: the wild, sweet
Sherlock was impressed. “She was setting him up to take the fall. And John? He was hardly going to sit by and watch—he was to be collateral damage?”
Sherlock reared back in his chair a bit. “That’s—I wouldn’t have thought that possible. Violins don’t have a unique voice.”
Hang on. “Did you drug my toast?”

December passed in the usual fashion—dark, cold, and damp. The ubiquitous twinkle-lights didn’t stave off the bleakness of the holiday, or of knowing the next three months would be even drearier. But after Christmas I felt myself somehow coming back to life. Daylight had been shrinking for six months; now it was growing. I had hope for the new year, and it came from my growing conviction that Sherlock had to be alive.

It’s an at-home morning, a couple of hours before the time Watson’s been waking up, or rather before she usually starts burbling and then grizzling.

“I took her shopping for her dress, so do please be complimentary.”
) and roses and lots of blooms I’d no name for. No card.
Rosie’s first word, it turns out, was “Ba.” And wherever “Ba” came from, it unquestionably denoted Sherlock. She never said it in any other context: it wasn’t a generic sound or a word that meant anything she wanted; it was just him. What’s odd about that is that she said it the night we got back from Italy, when she hadn’t seen him in at least three months.
A painting by Bluebellofbakerstreet was the inspiration for the fathers taking Rosie to school. I wasn't aware it had been, until I saw the image again and realized I'd unconsciously drawn on it. Thanks to Bluebell for their kind permission to link! https://archiveofourown.org/works/24064798

Joe Cocker, “A to Z.” It was frankly devastating. I’d always wanted John to say things like that to me, mean that about me. Some lines seemed as though he could be speaking them to me, but every last one of them could be me speaking to him.
– That’s more honest, at least.
This was fine, he thought. Roberto’s knee touching his left thigh was good, really. Wrist, thigh. His focus narrowed to these points of contact. Not too much; not too intrusive. Enough for confirmation, consolation. Nothing demanding. Just comfortable contiguity. He could handle it.
“By then Wiggins was there as Mycroft’s proxy, John. I wish you’d asked him, if not me. That bloated bureaucrat managed to get Wiggins on his side, probably paying him more money than he's ever seen before. And there’s no gaoler more implacable than a former ally.”
In the three years since, we’d become adept at compressing physical pleasure into a child’s hour-long naptime—or stretching it out into a night-long session of play, thrusting and straining, pausing to regroup, whispering and touching and laughing, resting and starting again. We sometimes got up from a night together not having slept but an hour or two. We hadn’t got jaded or sated; if anything the fascination had deepened.
It was one hell of a longshot. But if Sherlock was listening, and could reply, then at some point he’d probably answer—perhaps with some obscure opera number. Or he might go all English music hall. I’d heard him score perfectly on the BBC Radio Four quiz. (“For a case, John.”)
“You look wonderful. How do you not age a day, you witch? Your kids are what, thirteen and fifteen? And here you are still all Audrey Hepburn with a brogue?”

The place was as crowded and noisy as the NSY cafeteria would have been, though fortunately it had far fewer policemen. It was more unique than rare for Sherlock to “have coffee” with anyone, and the last thing he needed was to feel conspicuous while he did.
—videos, podfics, art, meta, handwork, gifs, beta, rec lists, photo edits, moodboards, and all the other things that keep us sustained—well I'd love self-recs of those too, because I'm insatiable. No pressure. Just sayin'.

Two days and a night in Sherlock’s childhood home was plenty, however. We were most at home and most ourselves in Baker Street. We got home late on Christmas Day, poured a boneless Rosie into her cot, and poured ourselves a glass of Ardbeg.
. Pulling his head back the inch or two that Roberto’s iron arm allowed, Sherlock drew in a controlled breath, held it three seconds, released it slowly. Emptying his lungs, he waited another five seconds. But the needle crept up.
I should probably have acknowledged right then and there how wrong I was to think he’d slip up, let anyone know I was alive. (Though there

What was surprising was how affectionate he actually was in return. He didn’t often let me see him kiss her hair or her hand, but whenever she was close by he was sure to have a hand on her foot or her back. He took care to wear colours and textures that would stimulate her curiosity. And—alert the press!—he made sure there was nothing in the flat that could hurt her, no experiments or rotting body parts; even the sharp edges of the coffee table he had covered with padded corners.
“No. I was—not myself. My thinking was strangely slow. I gave you the phone without examining it. John arrived and we left shortly after.”
pretty spectacular, if only for the timing. Oh, well. From Donovan that was probably a flowery thank-you.
I looked at Sherlock, who looked exhausted.
Typically, he already knew what it was. “No. It wasn’t your radio messages that let them know that Sherlock was alive. Morstan planted herself in your surgery on a chance, a suspicion—she had noticed the singular run of bad luck afflicting the leaders of various crime syndicates in her orbit. You didn’t endanger him. On the contrary: your warning probably saved him.”
I wanted him to tell me where he was, what he was feeling. But not being able to ask those things, I asked over and over when we would meet again. When he’d come home. He kept signalling
“I slept nearly round the clock.” I sounded accusatory.
“Sorry. What?”
” Felt a pencil-point of pain that barring a miracle he’d soon be leaving this behind.
There was no time to lose. I felt like marching straight over to see Mycroft, but I never knew where he’d be, and dragging Rosie all over London in this weather wasn’t an option. Instead I got us onto the bus heading home, and sent a text.
“Why am I here? You saw something that put the wind up, and I drew the short straw for the weekend, so ... I came. What makes this something for Homicide?”

“I know that, of course I do. Robbie may not have mentioned Jamie for reasons of his own, but I prefer to speak of him. Never to mention him is like never having had him. After he died everyone seemed to think it kinder not to talk about him. It wasn’t.”
That brought back a pain so raw I actually gasped. “Ah. I almost put that on the playlist for your wedding reception. Decided it was too...”
He looked ... luminous. His color was high, he was in an absolutely elated mood, and his hair was wet. —Wait, what? I looked surreptitiously out the window; no rain.
“What’s that mean? That’s not one of my twenty, by the way.”
He struggled to keep talking neutrally over the rising repetitions of “oh my god oh my god is she okay tell me”:
“Trust me, I’m going to make sure
The voice coming from the phone was weeping, trying to conceal it but undoubtedly weeping. “I love you. Heather, I love you. I’ll be there soon.

We strained and pushed as though to blend our very selves, as though living in two bodies was never going to be close enough. I felt him getting close to climax, trembling and collapsing just as I was.
The next day was grim. Patients were needy, I was irritable—both unsympathetic and distracted, not much use to them at all. I’d barely slept all night; no need to fake exhaustion. And Mary the nurse picked that day to try to chivvy me into going for a drink with her after work.

Like a gut punch it hit me that these weren't photographs; they were stills from recordings. Worse than stalkerish: voyeuristic, and God only knows what the actual videos showed. I breathed deep to tamp down panic, then shoved the tablet back at Mycroft.
Whatever it was, he wasn’t telling. After breakfast he came along as far as the hives but then set out “for a walk, maybe round the planets,” saying he’d be back around two. But well before that he sent a text.
Obligingly, I whispered. It made the conversation oddly intimate, as though we were alone in the room. I sat down next to them.
What had he seen? My face was flaming, remembering some of what there was for Mycroft’s filthy little cameras to capture. “What did you see?”
His green gaze looked somewhere between neutral and perplexed as he answered, “
He shaved off his moustache. Mary said it was because Sherlock had mocked it, but she was wrong. It was because the moustache went with his new life, and Sherlock had made a mockery of
When I came to consciousness again I could tell it was just after dawn, though the shutters were mostly closed and little light came in at the window. Sherlock was awake, stretched out beside me on his back and staring up at the ceiling. I curled around him and nuzzled his neck and shoulder with my beard, something he’d liked last night; I called him loving names as I kissed him. Perhaps that seemed too soon for him, because at my words he gently took some distance.
Suddenly this wasn’t jokey anymore. The atmosphere had gone from warm and joyful to tense and combative. Shit. I breathed deeply and got a grip, and so did he.
Though Sherlock would rather have kept well away from this case, he had to wait for the outcome of the cross-searches he’d recommended—it could be that the nephew was, against all odds, innocent. That’s the excuse he gave himself for continuing to interact with Lestrade and his team over the next few days. But he was too honest not to admit that this was a convenient excuse: he was intrigued. Zanardi’s admiration when he’d solved the case was gratifying.
I laughed again, relieved myself. “I imagine he’s straining at the leash. But don’t tell him I gave you the green light. Just ring him and ask if he’s available again. I don’t want him to feel ... never mind.”
And in a moment there he was, looking self-possessed but betraying just the faintest bit of unease nonetheless. His temples and beard had gone a bit greyer, but otherwise he looked very little changed from when we’d spent the month of February together four years earlier.
. Which made me choke up when she hugged me and asked how I was doing.
. Sherlock still harboured a well of self-loathing, usually concealed but never depleted.
The whole evening’s setup promised to deliver everything John would normally dread: cheesy songs played on hoary old LPs, an emcee making crude or coy quips, awkward silences and indecision on the part of the dancers, forced joviality and very British good humour “for the cause.” And a running joke on the difference between this Met gala and
Which in no time at all had crept up from a
By the time he got home Spink-Bottle was gone. The coffee-table was set with their favorite Thai dishes, Singha beer, and a small mountain of napkins. Sherlock had taken off his suit jacket and donned his dressing-gown, and was relaxed and smiling. It was bliss, as though there were no Spink-Bottle in the world.
“Crueler than a faked suicide and two years of silence?” It came out in a whisper, because I too was still perplexed at how much that hurt.
But something noisy and official was happening just ahead of us, outside the affectedly tasteful Gritti Palace Hotel. There were sirens, and flashing lights, and dozens of uniformed officers swarming the place, and
John’s trust is breathtaking, after all the times I abused it, on a case or on a whim. Damn it, I feel weak enough to cry, and lean in to kiss him.
“Nothing of the sort. He’s keeping it secret.”
I never like going to Mycroft behind Sherlock’s back. In fact I hate it. I hate conspiring, because it gives Sherlock another brick in his “alone protects me” wall. And because I’m on his side, always. And because it gives Mycroft the upper hand in a relationship that’s already fraught.

Roberto was rattled indeed, if he forgot an English phrase. I’d never heard that happen before.
Meaning:
to survive being without him. Beyond the instantaneous allegiance, attraction, acceptance, there was a bond of understanding that I thought would never fail us. Bound in mind and heart, sharing a living space and indeed a living, we weren’t even really separate people, but rather two sides of the same coin: opposites, sure, but also identical, coextensive, in so many ways. Brave enough to face a world we didn’t fit into anymore, or ever. Bright enough to know when people were humouring us but were wrong to feel superior. Burdened by tenacious desires we weren’t comfortable acknowledging even to ourselves, let alone to anyone else. But we were opposites, too: one brilliant, one industrious; one bored, one stoic; one mercurial, one stolid.
While I regret never daring to ask you to choose me, I also know you’d never have done it. I deluded myself into hoping that you could love me that way, if you would only admit it; I was wrong. That isn’t who you are, and you cannot.
I wasn’t laughing anymore. He rang off under my horrified stare, cast his eyes heavenward, flopped back on the bed and covered his whole head with a pillow.
Blessed Mrs Hudson was up and ready for Rosie at seven, and Sherlock was right, she’d do literally anything for time alone with her. We left them ready to start the day with pancakes. I was a little envious, since a day with Sherlock didn't promise much scope for sustenance.
hard liquor, and for what I was about to say, I needed it.
I should have seen this in London, from the beginning. Probably I did see it, but repressed the knowledge in favour of other concerns: putting distance between myself and John, learning the language of my own body, mapping the expanse of pleasures that I had never risked experiencing before. Becoming a “complete human being.”
I’d invited Ella, but she had professional boundaries I respected. (“It’s either come to your wedding or continue as your therapist, John. Which do you prefer?”) I vetoed Bill Wiggins before Sherlock could even bring him up; and I couldn't imagine inviting James Sholto to a second Watson wedding that—well, the first had hardly gone well for him, had it, and that was reason enough to spare him the second.
He inserted a mental bookmark into his sequence of thought and picked her up, swung her round, smiled at her squeal and stepped into the hallway for a furtive hug and a murmured endearment. She was delighted at having got his attention.
The thing about seeing Sherlock in the shower is that John knows this body so well already, yet it’s brand new to him. Familiar; foreign. He’s seen most of Sherlock; stitched, medicated, palpated, evaluated much of him; knows that physique better than most of his transitory lovers, and still finds him jaw-droppingly beautiful. And now the careful distance he’d always kept has vanished. He can reach out and touch, gaze and admire.
This doesn’t mean the naming exercise was bootless. We only recognised their real names when the wrong ones had all been tried on (or rejected out of hand, if I’m honest). It was an exercise in building community. Our community has grown by two spirited if inarticulate creatures, and it only made sense to try to name them in consultation with friends and family.
As it happened, after mid-February, it was impossible for me to check the playlist of the radio programme until well into March. I was deep undercover in a human trafficking operation being run out of Peshawar. But I kept worrying at the problem, gnawing at it whenever I could afford to be less than hypervigilant. When I re-surfaced in Delhi, my first priority after debriefing was to catch up with John’s songs. The Sunrise Cyber Café on Connaught Place seemed a suitable venue; it was full of backpacker tourists.
How could the man who thought himself more clever than God think he wasn’t worth anything? Send me away to kill himself?
John’s proposal had the advantages of elegance and economy, speed and surety. It meant that I would have to remain in hiding until he returned to the surgery and made a date with Morstan at Baker Street. Once there we would immobilise her and force her to summon Moran.
“Seriously? That was all it took?” He gave John a sidelong glance.
Thank you, MissDavis, for the 2020 Advent Ficlet Challenge.
I said the quiet part out loud. “Well, this is embarrassing.”

All this while stroking his beautiful ribboned back, cupping and stroking his bollocks, loving the high, tight density of them in my palm, circling his gorgeous cock with my fist, feeling him do the same to me, sparks building in my field of vision, a kind of icy-hot shower starting low in my gut and building to an explosion.

That did sound condescending. “Our work
“Settle in?”
“Infatuated. Juvenile.” The words are coming now, all right. “Besotted. Transparent. Everyone could see how I felt about you, how much I wanted you. I was embarrassed about it.”
Sherlock took longer than usual in the shower, and that’s a high bar. I was about to go up and check when he came down, his embarrassingly ill-fitting outfit covered with a wool blanket he’d taken from the guest bed. He’s—well, I can’t help it, he’s endearing in the way he has to curate his appearance, even in private, even with me.

Well, friends, it’s official: we’re finally retiring, for good, to our house on the Downs. (Sherlock calls it the cottage, but it’s too large to be a cottage. Perhaps I’m just accustomed to the modest dimensions of 221B Baker Street, but the house in Sussex seems

She looks more like Audrey Hepburn now, less like Sally Field. Lestrade’s undisguised interest is boosting her confidence as well. They step into place for “Cheek to Cheek,” and he remembers he’s engaged to dance with Charlotte Gordon just as the loudspeaker invites dancer 221 to meet his partner at table five.

“I had lunch today with the editor of an academic journal, the
He used to suspect that Sherlock was posing when he was impervious to outside data. “Lights on, nobody home” seemed as stagey and unrealistic as “it was all a dream.” But over the past, more intimate year, he’d come to realise there was nothing fake or forced about it: the man really did dive so deep into his thoughts that the outside world literally didn’t register. With one exception.
I saw him survey the press dispassionately, but register real shock when he saw his fans. Scores of people, maybe even hundreds, who’d been nearly silent and now sent up a roar, stretched up and down Baker Street. Though it was cold enough to snow they were undeterred, standing there with their breath fogging in the icy air. Holding handmade signs that said
“Hey.”
And that was it, once, twice again, John rubbed just their bollocks over each other, cocks hardly touching; and Sherlock
It seemed we were out of practice talking seriously, or perhaps our hug had given us a change of tone, but within minutes of walking into this room we were already more ourselves than we had been in weeks.
“It’ll be a pleasure to watch you dance with her. Really, Sherlock, I’m enjoying this about ten thousand times more than I expected to. I love watching you, and I’m not the only one.”
And just like that my heart is pounding. Whatever John has in mind, I want. I want without knowing what it is. But first I have to give him something, and there’s no way to do it without utterly killing the mood.
I slid a hand round to grasp his own on his cock, loosen his grip so I could stroke him to climax as I eased a finger in deep to brush his prostate. I lapped at him around my finger until I felt him coming, thrusting back against my face, pulsing over my hand, my finger still pushing into him but slowly now, softly, until his legs almost gave out and I pulled him, heaving panting breaths, onto my lap.
“Not like that.” He’s impatient, but cool again. “Your face. Your wrist bone.”

Oh. He’s been ignoring conversational cues again. He always has, that’s nothing new. What’s new is that now he has to parse his own behaviours, his words, if he’s ever to figure out where he’s incomplete, and remedy it.
Three weeks later the flyers and posters were already out at the Met, and the second Gala was

And John fit in too, of course. Everyone liked him, everyone told him he should stay, that
A couple of days later, though, squatting over a body in the Green Park, I saw Holmes arrive with his doctor. Mouthed an exaggerated “thank you” and smiled; he nodded, and didn’t.
A tiny wave of relief lapped at the edge of his awareness. John would come. Meanwhile he had to tell Donovan about the dying woman and the call.

John hefted himself up on his elbows and smiled down, then said simply, “Same here, by the way. About my kink, I mean. Everything about you is
After a moment he went on, “It wasn’t that hard, you know. Once I got over the worst of the mind fog. Grief really doesn’t help cognition.”
“Either way, the two of you make the perfect experiment for Nature versus Nurture,” said Mycroft.
“So you—made it happen,” he said, then picked up his fork again and speared his last mushroom.
No weapon. Probably unnecessary, and in any case a non-starter for air travel.

On Tuesday afternoon, two days after Heather’s death, they had a false alarm in the form of an unidentified corpse in the river, corresponding to Will Simpson’s age and description. Dead by violence, not drowning.
was in some ways a classic nativity scene, in others pure Caravaggio and no one else. Standard: the Angel announcing the birth to the shepherds; Mary, Jesus, and Joseph; the ox and ass; an attendant shepherd; the two saints framing and observing the scene, their impossible presence in the picture plane representing both their contemplation of the scene and their proximity to Christ. Ubiquitous in Christian art.
He came home. For the longest time that was all I could think: he’s come back, he’s home. I couldn’t find any words to speak, just silence and breathing, as I heard that voice I’d thought I’d never hear again, asking me not to shoot him.
Here he was Will Scott, known as Scotty. (Better than Willie, at least.)
“Don’t leave. Stay here, with me. Not someplace else in Kerry. If you ... if you want to, I mean. Call in sick for a while. The Kerry sun can be very dangerous at your age.” He wasn't backpedalling, but he wanted to take the edge off what was very nearly a plea; humour had always helped at that.
“Not the same bed.” I must have let some disappointment show, because he added, “Not yet. Let’s get through this first, yeah?”
Sherlock’s heart is pounding, but John is looking up at the inky sky with its scattering of glittering stars. “Look at that, Sherlock!” His expression was so enchanted, so enchanting, that again Sherlock can’t look away.
“And if we aren’t, we need to find a compromise.”
Not only hard now but incoherent, babbling, I bundled Valentina into a taxi that would take her out to her God-forsaken suburb. Courtesy didn’t extend to driving her there myself, flesh and blood couldn’t stand it. I was already drowning in the confluence of
Headline-seeking: not at all. The last thing he said before he made to leave was that he didn’t want his name associated with the case in any way. No publicity, no acknowledgement, no hint of involvement. My eyebrows shot up at that, and when the meeting ended I straightened up to introduce myself, in case Lestrade didn’t do it for me (he did). The consultant looked at me indifferently as we shook hands, as though he’d already seen all there was to know about me. And indeed, he already had.
He becomes aware of Greg standing next to him, having left the floor with Amanda from Vice, looking at the spectacle with the same evident pleasure as John.
Everything Sherlock said, so slowly and so painfully, twisted in my gut. I knew exactly how he felt, exactly what the mix of guilt and desire and regret tasted like, how it tainted a relationship. I’d known the full weight of the remorse that loving Sherlock had made me feel, lying next to Mary, thinking of him. If he’d felt that weight, I didn’t want to know any more right now. Maybe later. I’d keep those questions for later.

Mycroft walked in on my recitation and I didn’t even hear him until his urbane, mordant voice broke in on it.
It seemed I’d never get to the end of Sherlock’s extravagant forgiveness. But I still had to push at this, like a wound it felt bizarrely good to press.

Sherlock’s IT ban meant that it was pointless to try to reach him during the day. He wouldn’t answer the land line and would use no other device for the time being, so I’d resigned myself to the uncertainty of when and where we’d be together again. I gathered my coat and gloves, and left for work.
We took a cab to the hotel, and endured the warm and cheerful welcome of the enthusiastic proprietress with the discomfort of two lovers badly out of sync.

“Thank you, sir. Very kind. And now, if you all can excuse me.” She couldn’t get out of the room fast enough, and I couldn’t blame her. I knew what it was like to be kidnapped by Mycroft.

“Apologies, Doctor Hooper. I very much appreciate your celerity with this autopsy, and of course your discretion.” Mycroft’s smooth tone was typically patronising.
More notes: 1. Like most fics, this one doesn’t mark where I’m quoting the show directly; where you detect a weird register shift to Conan Doyle-esque formality—I imported a few sentences from “The Empty House,” nearly verbatim but

Well. That was a mood-killer, thought Sherlock, as his erection flagged and his hand fell away. Just as well. This definitely wasn’t the time or the place.

I didn’t really notice the violin at first. But then there it was, a low hum beneath the dulcimer, then all at once taking up the melody so strongly and sweetly that the dulcimer-man started playing a harmony instead. It made the waltz  even prettier, with the the long rich lines of the violin like a velvet ribbon, and the bright notes of the dulcimer like ice crystals.
are. I was talking to you half the morning. Julian Ashford-Warrington’s back from Harvard. Emailed some burnt offerings this morning about the clamorous success of the taxonomy on both sides of the Atlantic. Asked me to give a keynote address at the next meeting of the British Academy of Medical Forensic Sciences.”
Long pause.
you—? No one hates you!”
“Well, you know, let the cat out of the bag.”
The air was electric. I’d never thought to hear words like this from John. It meant so much more than the borrowed words in songs I’d had to speculate about. I found my thoughts going blurred and loose around the edges. My body felt increasingly heavy and I was sorely tempted to close my eyes, just sink back and—
The boys. Boys in their ... forties. I’d broken or lost the generational chain that kept the boys in grown men. I wondered if one day he’d be calling me and Sherlock “the boys” to Rosie.
On balance, however, that would have been a grave mistake.
— That’s right, beg for mercy—TWICE. JW
“She was torn, I think, between wanting Rosie’s crib in our room where we could keep her safe, and having her in the next room. For—well, you know. Rebuilding intimacy. She didn’t know that I’d already checked out of the marriage. I didn’t even know it myself. I didn’t know much about myself, at that point. I was lost.”
— Don’t play with me. SH
“Staying in character.”
He pulls out one of his prepared questions to draw John’s attention from his own feet to his partner. “Do you have plans for this weekend?”
“I can’t believe we’ve wasted this much time.”

I paused, to let her finish if she had more to say. John taught me that. I get more information that way than people intend to give. I don’t think it’s why he taught me to do it, but it’s been very useful nonetheless. But no, she was finished.
John smiles warmly up at him. “You mean, the way

don’t want to stop. It’s just ... a bad habit, to be embarrassed about ... mothers, and that.”
“Well, but. There’s nothing there to keep your great big brain busy, just a quiet day at home.” I feel his smile against my hand, and let my index finger wander just a bit into his mouth. His gorgeous, warm—oh, God, stop that now. This is an important question to get an answer to.
She is slipping out alone, in a wrap of black velvet, and she gives them a smile and a decidedly knowing nod that may as well be a wink. The last they see of her is a flash of silver and gold as she climbs into the black cab, closing the door behind her as the driver pulls away from the kerb.
Mycroft bent and kissed Rosie’s forehead, nodded to us and left.
And then, Christmas morning, him kissing me awake. Not with the usual intention: before I was even properly conscious, from under the bed he pulled out a frame with two photos in. And I saw that this was going to work, it was. Putting me in his own place, and himself in the other bloke’s, he had given me a visual for his devotion rather than having me imitate someone else’s. A stroke of genius: but then, he
If John can’t talk candidly, neither can he. Watson it is, then.
With his magnifying glass Sherlock tapped the familiar regimental insignia tattooed on the man’s upper arm. “You’ve identified him?”
“Lestrade was fine with calling me in.
“What?” Breathy and confused, now.
from Sherlock.
I brought the espresso over to the table in tiny cups, and sat down facing John. Our feet tangled beneath the table, our hands occasionally reached across it. Croissants or pastries would also have been helpful distractions, but I couldn’t have eaten anything and neither could he.
“About the scars: after you were shot, and I saw them. About your time away: much earlier. After the bonfire night. Something about that whole night didn’t make sense to me. When I came to, the way you were looking at me, holding my face in your hands. I almost knew, then. ‘Fire exposes our priorities.’ You, just back after so long. The kidnapping. Mary shrieking. The skip code. It was all too... weird not to be part of some Mycroft web or other.” John’s hands were motionless on my lower back until he returned to caressing my skin gently, raising gooseflesh.
If he is, shame on me. But I remind myself that we’d both been cutting with each other, and some defensiveness was natural. Mine, strangely enough, has been directed toward Zanardi alone. The bastard had seen what I hadn’t—that is, what I had in Sherlock—and he hadn’t hesitated to take advantage of my blindness, my cowardice. And I’ve been resenting the hell out of him for it, despite trying not to.
I smiled in the dark, again. “Because you’re thinking something through, and it appears to be taking a ridiculously long time. Watching you do it was driving me mad. Honestly, John.”
I heard the subtext. “But you could be angry about something else.”
shepherds.
The flight attendant eyed us speculatively, but Roberto’s deliberate hand on my leg made him give it up as a lost cause. Flattering. I never ceased feeling flattered by how visibly attentive he was, as though he was not only unembarrassed at being with me, but actually proud. Again I felt a stirring of arousal that came less from desire than from the unfamiliar sensation of being desired, instead of craving. (Regretting, mourning.) I deliberately pursued that arousal. It was what I was there for, after all.
His arms were hard, and I was strangely boneless. We stood there a few minutes just breathing, re-centring. My head sank to his shoulder and he put his left hand into my hair, which was more lank and oily than I’d realised. Hardly the suave hero’s return, as his next words confirmed.
It only now registers that this is a Dear John letter. Odd to be leaving you when we’ve never been together, so I have to write what I’ve never had the courage to tell you in person.
“Yes, oh
“Are you asking me, or telling me?” His tone was guarded.
I sighed. It was a relief, a twist of anxiety I’d been trying to ignore. So Sherlock hadn’t even known it was a letter from me when he'd got it and discarded it. Still, I couldn’t help wondering what would have happened if he’d opened and read it the night it arrived.

Ash put down her whistle and stepped up to the microphone again. Funny, she looked more like Sherlock than like her brother. John loved the hyaline clarity of her singing, the ease and surety of her ornaments, a perfect match for her brother's filigree guitar accompaniment.
She trailed out of the bathroom looking fragile, like an exhausted adolescent who’d cried again in the shower, and he felt quite ... savage. Whatever her husband had done to make her feel he hated her, he was going to undo it. Sherlock knew a thing or two, after all.

When had John become this diabolical? Was it possible I’d never known him at all? I felt a grin stretching my cheeks, and he added,
I don’t smile. I close my eyes and lean close to him, to breathe him in. If it’s the last time, or if he makes me sleep alone all night, at least I’ll have that to think of instead of that hideous abyss at my feet and no John.
At the pub on Saturday, Patrick’s interest in Sherlock hadn’t really registered; for one thing, John hadn’t got a clear view of the stage. Then too, the music and the crowd had been sensory overload, and seeing Sherlock after so long had been emotional overload.
Startled, John looks up, but Greg is already following Molly with his eyes again. John can’t blame him. Her slight form, her handsome gown, her slender neck holding her head high—she looks like a princess in a Hollywood film. Sherlock’s smiling down at her kindly, not tenderly but affectionately, and again John feels a rush of pride in him. Sherlock’s being truly generous with her now, careful not to put her out of countenance when she’s so uncertain of her public persona.
“It might get to a foot here. You’d love it.”
Weeping never lasts as long it feels. Try to cry it out, try to cry as long as you can or must, it never lasts as long as you think it will; it’s nothing like as long as you tried to resist weeping. And nothing like as painful.
Once I used to cross my fingers for a chance to touch him, casually. Faux casually. If he needed stitches, it might be. Or restraint. Or a vigorous throttling. I’d keep my eyes open for any chance to make him touch me, too. To shift me out of the way, or once, nightmarish memory, to reach into my coat to pull out my gun.
I moved in behind him, pressed up close and felt my cock stir at the touch of John’s arse. Pavlovian, I swear. He reached his left hand back round to stroke mine for a moment.
, for God’s sake. Was he performing this new persona, or had he actually become it? Not a question John could imagine asking; observation was the only option.
“Sorry about last night.”
“Yes, good example. But Molly isn’t in your subset of possible sex interests. Does it happen with people who are?”
Without any regret I relinquish the idea of inviting people in. We're merrier when it's just the two of us.
“Exactly. Just like you.”
On the flight home they’d squabbled long and loud about whether he had secured his own release, with Mycroft merely ferrying him back to England, or whether Mycroft had deployed his omniscience and omnipotence to clean up after his little brother’s amateurish fumble.

crime. We have to see it, John! I want to see it!”
“You’re a genius,” he murmured into John’s mouth, which had finally wandered to his own. His wiring thoroughly jangled, he tasted John’s grin and his hum of agreement.
And depending on what I found out had happened to Sherlock and why, it was likely to remain that way.
