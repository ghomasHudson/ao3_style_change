“John? John, where are you going? What are you doing?” Sherlock stayed seated as John walked around the front of the car to Sherlock’s door and opened it. He motioned for Sherlock to get out, offering his hand in assistance.
“Please? Well if it’s important enough to be worthy of manners then I guess I have no choice but to agree.” He laughed at his own reply before removing his bright red pants and tossing them away.
"I do. I love you. And my god, I am so, so, unbelievably sorry that it took me so long to realize that."
“I love you, Sherlock.” John whispered as he held in a breath, scared of what Sherlock might say.
“I know. Come on, baby, let’s go home.”
“We believe we fixed the problem, but there is a small chance that it could happen again within the next 24 hours.”
Sherlock woke to a very small figure obnoxiously yanking his shoulder and hurriedly whispering in his ear.
Rush in
Sherlock sighed as he read the red markings on his recently submitted paper. 'See me after class,' was written along the top of his paper in bold letters. The class had been instructed to choose any piece of art work and write an excruciatingly long essay on the artist's technique, their intentions for the piece, and what the student believed to be the meaning. The young student was unsure of exactly what was causing him to struggle with the assessment, but apparently, his teacher, Mrs. Thomas, took notice and wanted him to fix it. The bell rang, and Sherlock lazily started packing his things before running a hand through his hair and scurrying to the desk in the front of the classroom.
"...What?"
John placed a quick kiss to Sherlock's already swollen lips before replying. "We are going to go fix ourselves a cuppa, and then you and I are going to build a massive fort in the living room, using these," John turned and yanked the blankets off his bed, and picked up the blankets that were folded in his closet, "and we are going to watch really, really bad daytime telly, and we are going to be. We're just going to be together... and I might kiss you. Many, many times. But, that's irrelevant. Does that sound good to you?"
the heat from John's breath.
“Hey, mate. How’s it going?” The man asked as he waited for his ordered cocktail from the bartender
They tried again.
The music continued to play peacefully in the background as the soon to be husbands danced. Sherlock looked into Johns eyes and smiled an affectionate smile. How could he have been so lucky? How did he play all of his cards right to lead him to the perfect man before him?
"Hello, Mr. Holmes. I don't believe you're completely grasping the concept of the piece you've chosen to write your essay on. Is there something going on? You usually excel in this class and, quite honestly, I'm more than slightly disappointed in your efforts on this assignment."
John took the bag and laughed as he pulled out a bright red fabric. "Red. Red pants," he looked up at Sherlock, a goofy smile plastered on his face, "Red pants, Sherlock." He giggled before pressing a quick kiss to the detectives lips.
“Ah,” John tried to speak as he continued chuckling, “Oh, bloody hell!”
John picked her up and began to rock her back and forth. Sherlock walked to the other side of the room and turned on her sound machine, which must’ve turned off in the middle of the night. The sound of rain filled the room as he returned to John and watched him try to lull his daughter back to sleep. He wrapped his long, thin frame around the doctor’s back and began to rock in the same rhythm John had created. Sherlock pressed a soft kiss to John’s neck, noticing how the slight contact caused him to lean against his chest. John turned his head and gave Sherlock a quick kiss. He gently rested his head on the smaller mans shoulder, burrowing his nose into the nape of his neck.
John sobbed as he watched from the window. He felt as if his entire world was crashing down, because honestly, it was. John didn’t have a purpose, a reason, a will to live if Sherlock wasn’t by his side. He felt his throat clog, his chest beginning to tighten, his vision going dizzy. His legs gave out and he fell into the chair, begging himself to calm down. To breathe. Sherlock would want you to breathe, he told himself. Breathe, that’s it. His head dropped into his hands as he cried.
“Oh my god. Oh, Sherlock, what have I done? How could I have let this happen?” John whispered as he gently picked up Sherlock’s hand. Mycroft stood, a hand covering his mouth, as he stared at his younger brother with fear and sorrow in his eyes.
He dreams of nothing but John, breaking his heart over and over and over again, but he returns every time. He loves John, every time. He hopes John will love him back, but he never does. He doesn't wake until he feels a pair of strong hands shaking him.
Let me play among the stars
Sherlock and John solve a case that prevents a local pub from getting robbed.
This chapter was requested by supernaturaltakeoverfics. I hope this is alright, love. If this isn't the way you wanted it then please tell me and I'll make the next chapter to your liking. Enjoy!!!!
The little girl sat in the living room, colouring in her book, while Sherlock made tea, knowing John would be awake any minute. John drudged into the living room, yawning and rubbing his eyes, as the kettle began whistling.
Sherlock looks down and feels his cheeks heat up as he shrugs his shoulders, "I... am, yes. I was... cold...?" He tries to sound convincing, and utterly fails.
John pulls back, looking into Sherlock's eyes, still holding his wrists, "Sherlock, I am so sorry. I shouldn't have left like that, I just didn't know what do and I didn't want to make everything worse by saying something I might've regretted."
Before he knew what he was doing, he was opening the John's wardrobe door, and pulling out the jumper he had deduced to be John's favourite. His senses were attacked by the heavenly scent that could be described only as 'John' as he bundled up the sweater by his face and inhaled. He grabbed a second jumper, pulling it over his thin, but admittedly taller frame, before staggering backwards, and collapsing onto John's made bed.
"Oh, John. It's alright. I would never leave you. Ever." John grunted as if he didn't believe him. How could he not believe him? "John, look at me," Sherlock demanded, using the hand wrapped around John's neck to lift his face. "I will never,
"Hmm," John pretended to ponder the question. "Well, I do believe we were right here..." John crashed his lips against Sherlock's in a passionate kiss.
John nodded, leaned up and brought his lips to the detectives for a quick kiss. “Yes. Alright, love. Thank you.” He smiled before turning and drudging along to Sherlock’s bedroom. He plopped onto the bed and closed his eyes, listening to the sound of Sherlock rushing about the kitchen.
The two eventually finished their work and they both felt comfortable that the younger boy had done a rather nice job on his essay and they felt confident that Mrs. Thomas would be impressed by his re-submission. They were both hungry after the several hours of studying so they ordered dinner and continued to talk. The conversation was easy and comfortable, there were a few moments, however, that Sherlock would find John's eyes and would see something there that he couldn't quite figure out. It wasn't hateful like most people's. If he hadn't known better, he would've thought there was something like adoration in his glare.
They laid silently for several minutes before Sherlock turned onto his side, inching just a little bit closer to John. He sensed the movement and did the same, turning to look at Sherlock, whose face was slightly illuminated by a small beam of moonlight coming through his window. Sherlock would scoot more towards John after a moment or two, followed by John, then Sherlock, then John, until they were right next to each other, noses almost touching.
In other words,
"Right. So, I heard what Mrs. Thomas said," Sherlock felt his cheeks warm at the realization that John knew his current, failing status in their shared art class, "and I was just thinking that I did really well on that one, so I wondered if maybe you might be interested in allowing me to...tutor...you? You, of course, don't have to, it's just I, uh, I thought I would offer." He continued his rambling as Sherlock considered his offer. He really could use the help, and John seemed to be a really nice guy. Plus, Sherlock thought, he definitely is extremely attractive. With his...face and his body and his...
The next morning, John wakes up to Sherlock's eyes on him, full of love and adoration.
He smiled, "Yeah. Let's go," he took John's hand and intertwined their fingers. They walked hand in hand back to Sherlock's flat and as soon as the door closed, they were at it again.
John felt his warm breath against his face. “Sherlock.” John licked his lips and used his hold on Sherlock’s face to bring him into a short, quick kiss.
"Do you think he's going to like what we did for him, Da?"
John inhaled slowly, “I love you, Sherlock. Its just hard for me knowing that people can do the things they just did to you for no other reason than the fact that you’re with me. I’m sorry, Sherlock.”
breaths, trying to regather himself enough to speak. "Fucking hell, Sherlock," his lips twitched again involuntarily, curling at the corners as he tried his best to suppress another laughing fit. He failed.
Stop two: Complete!
John scooched over, closing the gap between him and Sherlock, without hesitation, without a second thought, as if it were the easiest, most normal thing in the world. It was easy. It was incredibly easy to be close to Sherlock. A certain feeling of safety and security, love and acceptance radiated off of him. It felt so natural for John to want to be wrapped up in it. After all, they were just two people. Two people that traveled long, bumpy, twist and turny roads to find one another, how could they not cherish it? How could John not move closer? How could Sherlock resist resting his forehead against the doctors? Looking into his eyes as if they held the world? How could they have waited so goddamn long for this moment?
“Hey, love.” He looked at Gerald, who had a rather nasty face on, “Hello, name’s John.” He extended his hand for the man to shake, but withdrew when the man didn’t take his hand.
WARNING. HOMOPHOBIC SLURS ARE USED IN THIS CHAPTER. PLEASE TAKE NOTE, YOU WILL BE WARNED WHEN THEY COME UP. Also, I am sorry this is a horrible chapter. I am extremely tired right now and trying my very best to keep my eyes open long enough to post this. I hope it's not too bad. I wanted to make this one longer and generally better but I'm way too tired. Anyway, enjoy!
John quickly began to buck into Sherlock’s mouth, first causing a slight cough from the detective, but he quickly got used to the rhythm and accepted it quite willingly. John was letting out a near constant stream of moans.
“No. No just let me say this, please. I’m not angry at you. I’m not upset with you, but I need to say this. Please. Please. I am begging you. Please don’t fight anymore. I don’t care what people say about me or about our relationship because they don’t know what and who we are, but I do care about the things that happen to you. I can’t see you get hurt anymore. I understand why you fight, I understand why it’s so important to you to make sure people don’t judge us for being together. I get it, I really do. But can you promise me that you won’t fight anymore? Please? Can you promise me that?” John looked into Sherlock’s eyes, tears stinging his own. He held his breath as Sherlock thought for a moment.
His back arched, pressing their chests together, and he moaned as Sherlock skillfully teased that spot behind John's ear that he knew drove him mad. Sherlock reluctantly disconnected himself from John as he leaned over to grab the bottle of lube off the nightstand. He bent down, capturing John's lips with another passionate, emotional kiss. His mind was so focused on having Sherlock
Today is John's 50th birthday, we're gonna say Rosie is 5 or 6. John is not exactly 'happy' about his birthday, but the two people he loves the most make up for it. Aww, isn't that sweet?
John cleared his throat, "So, where shall I sleep?" He asked.
"Rosie? Are you okay, love?" Sherlock's sleep heavy voice whispered, squinting his eyes to see Rosie in the extremely early morning darkness.
"Holy shit!" John exclaimed as he put a forkful of cake into his mouth.
"Mm. Enough about her." The taller man giggled before raising an eyebrow and asking, "Where were we?"
“No doubt. Where?” Sherlock closed his eyes again.
Sherlock and John have sex. That's literally all it is. I'm sorry.
***************
Sherlock and Rosie arrived back at the flat around 8 AM, before John had woken up. As stealthily as they could, they brought up the balloons, presents, flowers, and cake up to the flat. They spent the remaining 47 minutes until John awoke to decorate the flat. They let the balloons wander the living room and kitchen, set up the flowers, put the cake in the fridge, and decorated the kitchen table with his gifts and some old pieces of confetti Rosie had stashed away in her room.
want to kiss you. Can I, Sherlock?" John's eyes dart down to Sherlock's mouth, "Can I kiss you?" He asks Sherlock's lips more than Sherlock himself, but smiles so bright that it's almost blinding as he sees, before he hears, Sherlock's mouth form the words 'yes,' and 'please.' "Thank god," he giggles before slowly pressing their lips together.
Rosie smiled, practically bursting with excitement, "That's very satisfactory, Da."
"Yes, Sherlock. That is exactly what I want you to do. Bit not good?" John asked, now more than a little concerned about whether or not Sherlock was actually upset about this.
He sobbed into his hands, never having loathed his own existence, his own self, as much as he does in this moment.
***********
"OH FUCK! OW!"
“You’re one of them fucking faggots. One of them little queers. The both of you.” He laughed, as if this moment was somehow, unfathomably comical.
Their kiss broke for a split second as Sherlock eagerly tore his shirt off, then John's. Their mouths quickly reconnected, lips sliding everywhere, teeth nibbling on bottom lips. Sherlock's pulse was so strong that when John latched his lips to his neck, he could feel it beating and ran his tongue over it, also feeling the vibration of Sherlock's moan. He licked and sucked, nibbled and kissed his way down Sherlock's neck, listening to the heavy breathing of the man above him. He soon longed for Sherlock's lips again and leaned up, forcing their lips together. Hard. So hard that Sherlock's left elbow buckled, causing Sherlock to fall and consequently bang his forehead against John's. "Ow! Fuck! John?" He hoisted himself into a sitting position and looked down. At first he thought John was in pain but soon he discovered that John was laughing.
Only fools
Sherlock started laughing, rather hardly, to John’s dismay. He huffed as Sherlock chuckled and said, “My apologies, John… But you should’ve seen your face!” He began giggling again.
Eventually, it was time for the pair to get out of bed, use the loo, and make breakfast. After doing their respective morning routines, Sherlock and John made their way to the kitchen, where John began cooking up a full English breakfast for them both. It wasn't an entire minute before Sherlock waddled over to John and wrapped his arms around the older man's torso, resting his head on his shoulder, and sticking his face in the warmth of John's neck, pressing idle kisses to the skin he found there.
“John…”
He pulled back the covers, laying down in the fetal position, clinging to John's jumper as if his life depended on it. He pulled the heavy blanket up around him, and it was only then he realized that he was shivering. He felt another tear roll down the side of his face as he let sleep take over him.
Please be true,
“Hush. No more apologies, love.” John scooted closer and rested a hand on Sherlock’s knee before leaning in and kissing him with everything he had. They decided that it had been a long day and it was time to go to sleep.
They were so caught up in their own moment that they almost didn't hear Sally's noises of disgust. Almost.
"Good morning, love," John whispered, pressing his forehead against Sherlock's.
“Well, she hasn’t stopped nagging him since they arrived – unhappy with her choice of spouse but they aren’t in an ongoing argument. He doesn’t mind. Anymore. He stopped caring about her insistent complaining which means he’s found something else to occupy his mind and time – cheating. It’s with someone she is close to though, but not a female. He hasn’t looked at a female body in the 12 minutes and 37 seconds since he entered the building, but he has looked at the host, a waiter, the bartender, and a fellow diner with something you could call lust, within that time – sexual identity right there. Someone close to her, not a female, father died when she was a teenager from alcohol, so it can’t be him– it’s her brother. She has done her fair share of shagging a male that she shouldn’t have as well. She hasn’t touched her husband, she’s been staring at her phone, giggling and blushing, not from a friend, obviously. She hasn’t paid attention to a word her husband has said. She doesn’t get out much, she has three young children, but she clearly has a job; an office job, going by her attire, the way she walks, her hair, the way she holds herself, and by how fast she types on that little device of hers. Only place she doesn’t go with her children is to her job, which is where her boss, of course, shags her in the bathroom during their lunch break.” He spit his deductions so fast that it was almost impossible to understand what he was saying.
“Well it was wrong. The Earth doesn’t revolve around the sun, John. It revolves around you.”
Falling in love with you.
Sherlock stepped onto the stand and watched as John made his way over to him. "So," the tailor said around the clip he held in his mouth, "you said this was for a 'case,' right?" Sherlock nodded, "Mm. So, what do you do? Are you an officer or a PI or something?"
Sherlock and John get a rather disappointing case. But, all is well in the end.
"Mmmmhmm!"
John giggled, “I think that’s an excellent idea.”
The woman thought it over for a moment. "Yes, I suppose that would be quite alright." Sherlock took in a breath of relief as she gave the woman a thankful smile.
John kissed him once more before rising to his knees. Sherlock, who unconsciously allowed John to decide what happened that night, followed him with his eyes, rolling onto his back, and gasped as his new… whatever John just became… ripped his shirt off, revealing gorgeous tanned skin that moved up and down every time he took a breath. He threw his shirt in the direction of the bedroom window where it landed with a soft /thump/ on the floor. The detectives lips were red and swollen and begging for more. The doctor sat above him, knees straddling Sherlock’s hips. John smiled devilishly at the man underneath him before bending down, placing his hands on either side of the bed right next to Sherlock’s face and crashing their lips together again.
"Ready to go, love?" He asked, planting a gentle kiss on Sherlock's cheek.
"Mm. Excellent morning, John." Sherlock smiled and let his hands roam up and down John's bare back, subconsciously drawing silly patterns on his warm skin.
“Sounds intriguing.” He whispered. Sherlock opened his eyes and they immediately began searching for John. He was curled up on the sofa, snoring softly. Sherlock smiled at him affectionately. Then, returned his gaze back to Lestrade.
Sherlock looked up, "John. Are you...blushing...?" He asked, hinting at the rosiness of the doctor's cheeks.
I hope you enjoy! If you like it, please, please, pretty please, tell me! kudos and comments are awesome! Thank you for reading!
John grabbed hold of Sherlock's hands, threw one leg over his waist, seemingly have 'won.'
In a sudden rush, his brain seemed to come back online, and he inhaled a sharp breath, shaking his head as Sherlock's eyes darted back up to his own.
“John. I can’t look up from this microscope because if I do, all of the blood in my body will certainly flow directly to my penis and I will pass out.”
They finished their shower and went out to the kitchen to make breakfast. They spent the rest of their morning watching movies and playing with Rosie.
In other words,
"Papa!" Rosie gasped.
25 minutes later found John and Sherlock drunk and laughing their arses off at the deductions Sherlock slurred out.
“SHERLOCK!” I heard myself scream, felt the crack in my voice. I knew the sound had been loud, but I could barely hear it, for very little could be heard over the sound of the banging in my ears. What is that incessant noise? Why is it so loud? It took me far too long to realize that the sound had been that of my own heartbeat.
His skin caught fire at Sherlock's touch and he gazed into the taller man's eyes. "I really think so," he breathed.
He turned and walked into their bedroom, basically turning into a ninja, avoiding any creaky floorboards so as not to wake the sleeping beauty. He carefully picked out his favorite black suit and the purple shirt he knows John
Sherlock untangled his hands from John’s and placed one in his hair, the other snaked around his waist, pulling him in even closer. “Mmm. John,” Sherlock tried, releasing Johns lips just to have his hand fly up to those beautiful curls and bring him down again. “John,” another kiss. “We should...” another kiss. Sherlock reluctantly pulled back, refusing to cave even when John pulled his head back down again.
Sherlock let out a hum of agreement. He laid laughing as well as he tried to catch his breath.
John woke up to Sherlock’s soothing voice in his ear, “You’ve got to get up now, John.” He chuckled as the doctor groaned and brought the blanket up to his nose. “If you want to go out to that bar tonight, you’re going to have to get ready now. It’s almost 7 o’clock. Sorry to wake you, John.” He laughed again at John’s annoyed behavior.
Sherlock ran into John's arms, knocking them both to the floor. Sherlock sobbed into John's neck and John wrapped his arms around Sherlock so tight that he was scared he might break him. Tears ran down John's cheeks as he held Sherlock, both of them laying still on the floor, too wrapped up in each other to care.
“Oh. Uh, well I suppose we could… share… a bed?” he ran a hand through his hair as he awkwardly continued. “Just for the time being, until we figure something else…?”
“Goodnight, John.” Sherlock whispered.
The men shook Mr. Bailer’s hand before exiting the bar. There had been a string of pub robberies and Sherlock deduced that friendly ol’ Todd Bailer was going to be the next victim. The found the robber and prevented the attack on the owner’s “pride and joy,” as he called it, hence the reward.
“Mm. Well good morning to you, too, love.” John whispered as he began to pull back. He didn’t get far, though. Sherlock snaked an arm around the doctors waist and pulled him in closer, crashing their lips together.
"Fine, but. Can we get that, too? Please, Da?" Sherlock turned, following where her finger was pointing. His eyes landed on a Grey's Anatomy colouring book. They walked to the book, picking it up and flipping through the pages. They saw organs, many organs, hearts, livers, arteries, brains, appendixes, gallbladders, and the likes of it.
The Irishman laughed. “Then what else? What could you possibly have that I might want?”
“No, Doctor. Mr. Holmes had his coffee and went out directly. I had a nice dish of curried chicken all ready for his breakfast, but he turned it down. And you know how he loves his curried chicken.”
“This is the place, Watson,” said Holmes.
“If that were the case he’d hardly fit into his closed carriage,” I remarked.
“This wardrobe,” I said, indicating an elaborate Early Victorian press. “Did you buy this?”
“It won’t happen again,” I assured him.
“I am offering myself,” I repeated. “You know the terms.”
I am a smoker myself, although I am attempting to quit the filthy practice, as I believe a physician should set an example of healthful habits to his patients. But Holmes is a chronic and compulsive puffer. And his pipe tobacco, a rough shag which is tolerable in an airy sitting room with a high ceiling, was not so agreeable in a closed carriage.
At 7:15, after telling Mrs. Hudson and James that I would be going out for the evening, I slipped the revolver into my belt, put on my coat and hat, gripped my bag and my swordstick, and went out to hail a cab to take me to St. James.
“Yes, John,” he said, reading my mind. “You have been my study lately. Ever since I saw you on the street in Florence.”
“For seeing to Mr. Charles at Campton Grange,” he said. “My cousin Alfie is ever so grateful that you looked after his young master. Everyone is very fond of Mr. Charles and wishes he were out of his trouble.”
“My brother is only waiting for summer so he can run off and join the Army,” said James. “And my mum – she’ll understand. I’ll write to her and tell her I have a good position with His Lordship’s brother and his friend. Then she won’t worry.”
“You’ve betrayed me, John,” he whispered. “And now you’re brought your paramour to beleaguer me.”
“That sounds unpleasant,” I concurred. “Why Slough?”
“You are solo today, Doctor, sir?” he asked. Ivan was a stocky Russian with a shaved head. Except for the manager, who appeared genuinely Turkish, all the attendants were Russians.
Back at the Hall, Holmes ate a hearty breakfast, but I found my appetite had fled. I choked down a scrap of toast and some weak tea and pushed my plate away.
“There it is,” said Holmes, surveying my new room with satisfaction. “Snug as a bug. I know you’ll be comfortable here, my dear fellow.”
“And never had a boy since then?” Thommie marveled. “Many of the gents that hire me are married gentleman. They don’t say so, but I can tell. Some are regulars. Once they have Thommie, they always come back for more,” he boasted.
“Never,” I stated. “I would not forget if I had encountered you before. After all, you are the most famous man in London.” Or infamous, I neglected to add.
I went to Holmes’ desk and pulled open the top drawer, looking for his memorandum book. I found it underneath a rat’s nest of string ends, scraps of paper, old pen nibs, and a mangy rabbit’s foot. Then I had to decipher Holmes’ system of organization, which placed Mycroft not under “H” for Holmes, or “M” for Mycroft, or even “E” for Earl of Sherringford, but under “B” for Brother. There it was – I noted the street number and the room. It was almost directly across from the Diogenes Club.
I did not see him again until years later, just before I left for India, and then once again when I returned from the East, a man broken in body and spirit.
“Solid,” I replied. “And I have my stick, as always.”
“He doesn’t look like either of the brothers,” I commented.
I could not do it. Once again, I was a coward. A weakling.
“I’m going out,” I said to the empty air. “Taking Gladstone up to the park for a run.”
Holmes rolled over and moments later was snoring loudly.
“I know that Lady Percy warned me about avoiding sodomites,” I said, pulling from his grasp. “And I am not a little boy!”
James puffed up with pride. “You should taste her faggots and pudding! Better than all that Frenchy stuff!”
“I give any calling cards to Mr. Sherlock,” said James, his chin held defiantly high. “And Mr. Sherlock also gave me orders that you were not to be disturbed, Dr. Watson. I was only following his specific directions.”
“You never used to be so pert, Johnny Lad.”
“Who is that?” I inquired.
The Irishman viewed my progress with a wary eye, but I think he was also proud of my initiative. He often asked me questions about my studies, and I was surprised – although I should not have been, considering the power of his mind – at his knowledge of things outside of Mathematics, such as Chemistry, Physiology, and even Anatomy.
I was tired from the long journey, but I was also restless. “Perhaps it would do me good to get out. And we haven’t dined at the Langham in a dog’s age.”
“And is the room in order?”
“Here is a bowl of water,” said Holmes. “Empty. I imagine the creature must be thirsty and hungry by now.”
“How long has it been there?” I asked without turning around.
“I don’t know, Guv.” Mick Wiggins sank down in the straw and held his head in his hands. “I can’t talk about any of that. I can’t! He’ll have me killed like he had Bill killed! And he hates anybody who peaches. He can have me gutted any time he wants, even in this prison. He can get to anybody, anywhere!”
“Thank you again, Doctor,” she averred. “Oh, you are too good. And you as well, Mr. Holmes. I am going to church now and I will include you in my prayers.”
“Not yet, Watson,” said Holmes. “There’s one more thing we need to do.”
“No, he will not,” said the Irishman. “Has he ever wondered where you were? When you wandered about the Continent, alone? Or when you stayed out all night with your mistresses or gambling with your cronies at your club? Did he ever seek you out, concerned about your welfare?”
“A lovely afternoon, Lady Percy.” He eased himself into the chair next to me, putting his arm around my waist, making his possession clear. “Are you having a stimulating conversation with Johnny Lad?”
“I know,” Charles sighed. “But now I was tainted. My father was furious. He said I must study and try to be admitted into one of the lesser universities. But my heart wasn’t in it. That’s when I met Dilly. She was everything I could have hoped for.”
“Anything,” Holmes replied. “Loose ends. Moriarty has gone to ground on the Continent like the wily old fox that he is. And a few of his henchmen have still eluded Lestrade’s sieve-like grasp.”
“What is a folly, precisely?” I asked as we ascended.
Now I am not by nature an untruthful man. Mendacity and falsehood are against my better nature. I no longer follow the religion of my youth, in which I was raised and trained from earliest childhood, nor do I follow any particular creed or belief, although, unlike my skeptical friend Holmes, I do not look down upon those who need the support of the supernatural over the logical in order to arrange their lives. However, I pride myself in following a strict moral and ethical code of my own making, one that has served me both as a soldier and a physician, as well as a subject of Her Majesty and a citizen of her Greater Empire. Much of that code involves honour. And honour assumes honesty.
John prepares to leave.
I let Wiggins pay for the pints – a point of pride to him – but I stood him the second round and also one for his friend. While we drank the young man chattered on about this and that, mostly theatrical gossip, but his talk was also peppered with praise of Sherlock Holmes.
“Doctor.” Lovell bowed slightly and the other servants nodded their acknowledgement of my presence.
Major Griffith slumped down onto the chair and covered his face in his hands. “I cannot tell you, Mr. Holmes! If I do, it will be the ruination of our family!”
John's laughter caused Sherlock to giggle, and then guffaw. Both of them stayed in their positions, laughing so hard that tears clouded their vision. John took several
The man looked at the suit, then at Sherlock. John’s eyes scanned over the lanky man in front of him; he’s bloody gorgeous, he thought. Look at those curls, those eyes, they look like the ocean after a storm, John’s eyes moved down to Sherlock’s torso; beautiful, thin and tall, smooth frame, long legs, Jesus Christ, what a beauty. “Absolutely. Just hop up on this stand here and I’ll take your measurements first.” He nodded to the stand before turning around to grab his pins, clips, and sewing measuring tape.
“That was unbelievable,” John sighed before continuing, “Are you alright, love?”
“Yes! God, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!” Sherlock grabbed him by his neck and pulled John into one of the most beautiful kisses the two had ever shared. It was so full of love, hope, acceptance, excitement, and pure joy. They stayed there for several minutes, lips gliding passionately against the others, hands curled into hair and wrapped around necks. Sherlock broke the kiss and rested his forehead on Johns and then pulled back and stuck out his left hand impatiently, clearly motioning for John to put the ring on his finger.
But I can’t help
Sherlock sighed, more than slightly embarrassed, "I haven't the faintest idea."
"Where are we going?"
"Okay, Ro. I think this is plenty of gifts. We live in a very, very small flat, please remember that." He giggled as her face momentarily fell to a frown, then lit back up again as she saw something else.
“Dr. Watson.”
“John Watson?” A nurse asked, looking up from her clipboard.
For some reason, maybe it was the look in John's eyes, or maybe the single tear that had rolled down his cheek, but it had convinced Sherlock that the smaller man meant what he said.
John wasted absolutely no time shoving Sherlock's coat off his shoulders, hands flying to undo the buttons of that damned purple shirt. It wasn’t long before things really started heating up. John had broken their kiss and started sucking on the soft skin of Sherlock's neck and shoulders. The delightful sting of a bite on his collarbone immediately followed by the soothing, hot wetness of John’s tongue
Stop one: Balloons.
“I really like having you in my bed, John.” He smiled at the man below him and chuckled.
John had moved them around so that they were in a similar position as the one they were in before they were interrupted; Sherlock on his back, John on his knees facing Sherlock, but not on top of him. John slipped two fingers into Sherlock’s mouth, “suck,” he demanded. Sherlock gladly did as he was told. John withdrew his fingers and pressed one against Sherlock’s entrance. “Alright?” he questioned, horrified at the thought of hurting him.
"Oh. Apologies. But, he's clearly not the father," Sherlock gasped as John closed the gap between them, plowing their lips together, John's tongue immediately licking Sherlock's bottom lip, begging for entrance.
"Oh, for fuck's sake, John! Stop teasing me and get on with it!" Sherlock yelled between moans, hoping John would take the goddamn hint.
They had fallen asleep on the couch while Rosie slept in her crib. A knock at the door woke them.
Fill my heart with song
John is a tailor. Sherlock is a client. Love at first fit I suppose. Part 1 of (possibly, still undetermined) 2.
"I've missed you so much, John. I can't believe you're finally here. Here. With me. I love you so much!" Sherlock smiled so hard his cheeks hurt, but he could hardly notice anything besides John's body pressed against his own, his arms wrapped around him, his lips wet and swollen from being attacked by his own mouth, his eyes filled with so much love and joy that it made Sherlock's heart melt at the sight.
**********
The detective couldn’t help but blush at John’s sweetness. Rosie was asleep in her car-seat, which John carefully took out of the car, careful not to wake their sleeping princess.
John had a look of awe on his face, “Brilliant. Absolutely brilliant. Wonderful job, baby.” He smiled a kind, sincere, amiable smile and Sherlock blushed under his gaze.
Stop four: Cake.
“Mm. I believe we should make it a permanent arrangement.”
This is absolutely horrible and has basically no point but I wanted to get something posted today, so here it is. I usually would've made this longer and more descriptive and actually (semi) good but I've spent the last 3 days on about 9 hours of sleep and I am not used to that. Enough excuses. I'm sorry for anyone that reads this monstrosity. Apologies, loves. But hey, smut is better than nothing, right? I'm hoping?
They fell into a deep sleep, both exhausted from the exciting day and extra-curricular activities they'd just participated in.
Sherlock tried to take a step but immediately slipped. Luckily for him, John was a very strong man. John caught Sherlock before they both ended up on the frozen floor. Laughing, he asked, "You alright, love?"
"I love you, John. I know I'm not supposed to, and I'm certain you don't feel the same, but I just needed you to know," Sherlock whispered softly, his voice slightly cracking, his eyes staring at a random spot on the floor, a single tear rolling down his cheek.
"So. Many. Designs." Sherlock stared in awe at the enormous variety of differently decorated cakes, shielded by the thick plastic plate. "So many," he whispered to himself.
“Reservation for 2. Holmes.”
Sherlock lost balance, again, when he stood up and accidentally crashed into John, not hard enough to make them fall, but hard enough for the doctor to find it comical.
Sherlock simply said, "You can sleep in my bed if you'd like. It's much more comfortable than the floor and it's definitely big enough for the both of us."
Sherlock is flatlining. His heart isn’t beating. Why aren’t they doing anything. Why are they just standing there? Help him! HELP HIM!
Take my whole life, too
When they finally got back to Baker Street, John carried Sherlock up the stairs and directly into the bedroom.
“What do you want to drink, love?” John asked, eyes fixed on the wall of liquor.
“Mm.” Sherlock cleared his throat before trying again, “John?”
Donovan went slack jawed at John's words, but, unfortunately, the shock was short lived as she gave the doctor a vicious smile. "Ah... I get it," she hissed, "You've turned gay now, have ya? Should've seen that comin'." She turned back to Sherlock. "Well. If being a freakish psycho wasn't enough to make almost everyone," her eyes darted to John, then back to the man in front of her, "hate you then being a little fag sure will, won't it?"
"Apologies, John. I didn't intend to bring you down with me."
"Did I do it wrong? Do you dislike it?"
"You're doing a wonderful job, Rose. Are you ready to go?" He smiled lovingly at her as she nodded her head and gently closed her book, put her crayons back in their box, and put them both in her backpack.
“Oh, god.” John was now on his tiptoes yanking Sherlock down for an impossibly teasing kiss, drawing a moan from the detective. “Let’s go.”
tore off his uniform jacket as Sherlock took off his trousers. John was completely naked, Sherlock following soon after. They found their way to the bed, kissing like mad, hands exploring every part of the other's body, dying to get the feel of one another's skin under their fingers. Sherlock rolled John onto his back, placing himself on top, leaning forward to kiss, lick and suck at John's neck.
“I love you, too, John.” He kissed the man again before curling up against him. “Goodnight,” he whispered.
"Mm. I'd love some," he quickly added, "bastard," under his breath, watching as his man prepared their tea.
John sighed, “Don’t be ridiculous. That wouldn’t be very nice, to kick you out as I just popped back in to your life.”
"What do people normally say?"
John turned to see Sherlock beginning to stand up, “Wait. I’ll come, too,” he whispered. John quickly kissed his lips and they began to make their way up to Rosie.
“I swear, you are way, way, way too good at that.” John chuckled as he squirted shampoo into his hand and massaged it into his silvery hair.
John, nor Sherlock regretted that night. They non-regretted that night 4 times before their bodies were so exhausted, and slightly bruised from their earlier fall, that they fell asleep.
“Not a problem, love.” He whispered softly as he leaned over the table to give his boyfriend a short, sweet kiss.
“HE’S CRASHING!”
Sherlock internally giggled at the flustered hurry of John's words. "Yes, that works quite well for me. I will see you tonight, John." Sherlock smiled before turning around, blushing rather furiously, and going to his next class.
He heard John gasp and watched his eyes snap open. “Bloody hell, Sherlock! You scared the piss out of me.”
John and Sherlock woke to a screeching alarm.
Sherlock introduced John to the owner, Angelo, who had apparently been a friend of the Holmes family. Angelo led the boys to the back of the restaurant where a small booth could be found, surrounded by fairy lights, perfect studying conditions. A waiter, upon the owner's request, brought them biscuits and tea, telling them they could stay as long as they needed. John thought he saw the waiter suggestively wink at Sherlock, but he was unsure.
Sherlock began opening his eyes as the light from the morning sun streamed into his bedroom. He stilled as he took in his surroundings; his head was resting on John’s left bicep and his hand curled around Sherlock’s upper back. John’s right arm rested on Sherlock’s hip, his face nearly pressed against the doctor’s chest. Sherlock noticed his left arm draped into the curve of John’s side. He stayed as still as he possibly could, acting as if his life would end if John woke and noticed their entanglement.
John giggled before standing on his tip toes and slowly pressing his lips against Sherlock's. He kept his mouth closed, trying his best to keep control of himself and not startle the man. That didn't last for one fucking minute. Sherlock groaned and kissed John harder. He let one hand wrap around the smaller man's neck and the other snaked around his waist, pulling him in closer. The tailor got the hint and, with a laugh, licked Sherlock's bottom lip, asking for permission to enter. With a needy moan, Sherlock opened his mouth and the kiss deepened. The detective felt his knees go weak and almost lost his balance. John pulled back, thinking he had done something incorrectly or crossed a line, but Sherlock immediately pulled him back and kissed him and kissed him and kissed him. They kissed until their lips were red and swollen. John reluctantly pulled back and guffawed as Sherlock tried in vain to bring their lips together again.
“Forest of Dean? That’s a long drive isn’t it?” John questioned as he sipped his tea.
Sherlock smiled again, this time took much less effort.
*********
John chuckled, withdrew his fingers and pressed 3 in, making sure Sherlock was efficiently prepared before taking his fingers back out, filling his palm with lube, and rubbing it onto himself. He gave himself a few tugs to release a little bit of the tension before lining himself up and slowly, slowly sliding into Sherlock. He didn't stop until he was all the way in, giving them both a moment to adjust to the new sensation. Sherlock hissed at the initial extra stretch but quickly returned to moaning. He nodded his head after a minute, giving John the permission to begin moving. John slowly pulled almost all the way out, before sliding back in, not overly forcefully, but at the perfect speed. If Sherlock's moan was anything to go by, John had just hit his prostate. He did it again, and again, and again, moaning and groaning and whining at the feel of Sherlock's tight, hot heat around him.
John had come back with two cups of rather shitty coffee and found Sherlock in the middle of a conversation with Sergeant Donovan.
“You found me as a broken man and made me whole again. I can’t even think about what my life would be like without you in it. And that is why I am asking you, William Sherlock Scott Holmes, will you give me the absolute honor of becoming my husband? Will you marry me?”
“John. John. I’m alright. He’s not worth it anymore. Please, let’s go.” Sherlock pleaded as he worked to calm the enraged man before him.
“John, none of this is your fault. I need you to know that.” John nodded once. “Good.” He bent down and kissed John. “Can we please go home, now?” He asked.
Sherlock and John sat giggling on the floor as Rosie shook her little rattle, using all the strength she had in her arms. She fussed slightly as she banged her rattle against her forehead. Her bottom lip popped out, quivering, her eyes widened, and she whined. After making sure she hadn’t been injured and just slightly caught off guard, John began to chuckle, then he laughed, then he let out a hearty guffaw as Sherlock did the same.
“Oh, shut it, you big git.” He rolled his eyes and began to giggle lightly.
"That was bloody awful, John."
Sherlock quickly shakes his head, "What?" he whispers.
“John? What’s wrong? Oof!” Sherlock exclaimed as John jumped from the bed and ran into him. He kissed him as if his life depended on it. “What’s wrong?”
15 minutes later found John and Sherlock sitting at a table, eating chips and drinking beer.
"Tall, lanky, uncoordinated men aren't the most graceful of ice skaters, John." He stated, eyes darting to the giant oval shaped rink and then back at John.
John let out a small sob as Sherlock questioned him. “No, no, baby, nothing at all. I’m sorry, I’m just being silly. Happy tears.” He sniffled before he continued on, “It’s just – it’s just seeing you with Rosie, it was so natural. It felt right, like you were meant to soothe her and dance with her. I love you. I love you so fucking much. I prayed for the day I could have you, here, with me, with Rosie, like this. I’m just so happy. You make me so happy. I love you so much, Sherlock and I can’t believe I’ve been lucky enough to raise our daughter with you.”
John was on his left side, his right hand gently draped over Sherlocks left hip. He sighed and grabbed Sherlock to stable himself as he repositioned. He moved so he was huddled up against the detective. He propped up on his left elbow, running his left hand through Sherlock’s mess of curls. He withdrew his right hand from where it rested on his lovers hip to his face, tilting it up by his chin, and leaned in to plant a quick kiss on the detectives lips.
John laughed, “That was the cheesiest thing I think I’ve ever heard!”
Sherlock was now laying back-flat on the chilly floor with a confused John Watson on top of him. They quickly inspected each other for injuries and, finding none, immediately broke into a fit of giggles. They were laughing so hard that John's eyes began to water and Sherlock's sides ached. It was so rare for life to offer these types of moments; where the world seems immune to anything remotely bad or evil, where there is so much joy that it feels impossible to ever be anything besides happy, where two people just let go of everything but each other, finding complete bliss and pure satisfaction in a nonsexual, but unbelievably intimate way. The rink was empty, the only thing that could be heard were the heavy breaths of the men that were trying to collect themselves enough to use words without laughing hysterically.
He felt a hand tug at his wrist as he heard, “Oh no you don’t.” Sherlock was pulled back around as his face met with the drunk mans fist. Sherlock fell to the ground at the sudden impact. He heard John yell his name. He heard the noise of the crowd that had suddenly accumulated. He heard John grunt. And then? Then he heard the sound of an extremely strong right hand break the nose of the homophobic drunk man that had caused the whole scene. He made to get up but felt a kick to his stomach, no doubt caused by Gerald. Sherlock opened his eyes as he tried again to stand and found Gerald being tackled to the ground by an insanely furious John Watson Holmes.
They climbed up onto the bed and… consummated their (soon to be) marriage.
After several minutes, Sherlock slid off of John, using every muscle in his body as he cuddled up around John. He placed a gentle kiss on his lips, opening his eyes to see John smiling at him.
Stop four: Complete!
“No time, John! Why would we even consider slowing down? This is by far the worst idea that you’ve ever thought of. Are you alright? John. John, stop laughing and look at me. Are you dying? Is that what it is? Are you dying? Or are you just slow? John. Do answer me, John. Idiot.”
John came with a cry and slumped against the wall as Sherlock pulled off of him with a /pop/. Sherlock took himself in hand and began thrusting against his hand. A few minutes later and he released, moaning heavily as his orgasm ripped through him. John opened his eyes to watch the beauty that was Sherlock Holmes as he undid himself. Panting, he leaned against John and pressed a kiss against his temple, then his cheek, his nose, and finally, his lips.
"I am, quite honestly, a bit lanky."
“Out with it, John.”
"Oh, baby. I'm so sorry I was gone for so long. I'm so sorry I left you. I missed you so fucking much, Sherlock. I don't think I could've handled one more day without you, I'm so glad to be home. Come here, love," he pulled Sherlock down again, giving him a long, sweet kiss. When the kiss broke, he cleared his throat and looked down at where him and Sherlock were connected, "Now, can we please finish the task at hand?"
Sherlock smiled a genuine smile, “However cheesy it may be, it’s the truth.”
Fly me to the moon
John pulls away, a delicate smirk on his face. "I see you're wearing my jumper."
Let's just say that this was
John gave Sherlock a questioning face, "Sherlock?"
“You are all I long for, All I worship and adore”
“Oh, yes! Yes, follow me, please.” The woman started heading to the back of the store and Sherlock followed. “Our tailor, John, he is one of the best. He has incredible taste. You’ll love him.”
"Sherlock, please," John whispers, a relieved smile momentarily making its way to his lips as he sees Sherlock's eyes fluttering open.
"Fine then."
one, "Actually, that one." She finally decided on a beautiful vanilla cake, with vanilla frosting ('of course, Da! It has to match the inside!'), with "Happy Birthday!" written in multicolored icing.
Please be true,
“I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you. I love you with every part of me and I can’t wait to become your husband. Thank you, John.” Sherlock whispered, looking so deeply into John’s eyes that he swore he could see his brain.
The woman, Stephanie was her name, lead Sherlock through the boutique and into a room where a short man with sandy blonde hair stood.
“Thank you,” John softly smiled up at the host and Sherlock nodded his head.
"Goodnight, Sherlock," John whispered to the darkness, laying on his back.
"I love you too, John. Can I please take you to bed now?"
That night, they slept in Sherlock's room, too lazy to bring the mess of blankets back up to John's bed. Sherlock had nothing but peaceful dreams, and for the first time in months, John didn't dream. He didn't dream about Mary's death or Afghanistan. He just slept, his face buried in Sherlock's bare chest, his small frame securely held by the taller man's long arms, his legs tangled with Sherlock's.
Sherlock tries forcing his swollen eyes open, desperately trying to reach, to see, John.
"HA! I got you!" John triumphed, a sneaky grin plastered on his face.
********************************
Sherlock chuckled, “No, probably not. But then again,” he looked over at John, “when have we ever been normal?”
Sherlock’s eyes were now rimmed with tears, as well. With a wavery voice, he said, “Ours? She’s ours?” The excitement in Sherlock’s voice was impossible to miss. He had practically been jumping for joy; John had never called Rosie their daughter before.
After a moments pause, the tailor sighed, "Brilliant. Absolutely, positively brilliant."
"John. I am a tall man."
"Me as well, John. I love you, my gorgeous sun."
Finally opening the door, Sherlock wasted no time in grabbing John by his hips and pinning him against the back side of the door.
"Mm. I am fine." He stated, trying desperately to not let his humiliation show.
Two men, exhausted and desperate for the one another, finally having their wishes granted of being in the arms of the other.
John had tears in his eyes, whether from laughing at Sherlock's outbursts and his obvious concern for his intelligence or from hearing that the detective shared the same feelings he did, he was unsure. But, damn it, he wasn't going to waste one more bloody second. He got on his tip toes, leaned his neck up and simultaneously pulled Sherlock's neck down, connecting their lips. John smiled so wide that he was afraid his lips were going to split. He smiled even hardly as he heard, or rather felt, Sherlock happy sob into their kiss. John grabbed that beautiful man and kissed the absolute shit out of him because he finally could. Sherlock wanted him to. And dear god, how long he had been wishing to feel those perfect lips against his own.
John and Sherlock spend the evening together, dancing, laughing, living.
“Come on, Sherlock. Wake up for me. Please. Come on, I’m right here. Please. I’m begging you. Open your eyes.” John groveled as he used his thumbs to stroke Sherlock’s hand.
“One of what, exactly?” Sherlock knew what he was going to say, but hoped against all odds that tonight wouldn’t be one of those nights.
**********
"Sherlock, do you have-" John began to ask but was cut off by a nod from Sherlock before he reached over to the bedside table. He turned on the light, illuminating the room with a soft, golden glow, threw open the drawer and gave John the bottle of lube. "Perfect," John whispered, more to himself than Sherlock but still loud enough for him to hear it. Sherlock blushed when he lifted his hips, allowing John to place the pillow he'd picked up under him.
She rolled her eyes as she hopped off the couch, seemingly ignoring his statement. He watched as she went over to her little backpack, opened it, and pulled out a sparkly notebook with little space cats plastered on the cover, and a pencil.
Sherlock takes two deep breaths, letting his eyes close for just a second, before opening them and giving John a questioning, yet hopeful, look. "John? Do you... do you mean it? Truly?" Sherlock's eyes are glossy with tears, again, or still, is unknown by either of them. His eyes are boring a hole into John's, who smiles at him, nodding his head.
I'd like it to be known that this is set in college, not high school, and the men are of age. I think Sherlock is probably 20ish in this one. Didn't want anyone to think the boys were too young :) Enjoy, my loves! Leave a comment or kudos if you like it! Thank you for reading!
"Sweetheart, as much as I love this, and trust me, I do, it's a bit tough to wander about a kitchen when you've got a second body attached to your back."
“I’ll get it. Stay here.” Sherlock whispered as he stood up and stretched, then bent down to kiss John’s forehead.
John felt his heart in his throat as he waited for her to continue.
John laughed before rolling his eyes and saying, “You git! I was just making sure!”
“Well, love, I believe we are going to take a break and enjoy those magnificent flowers. I can tell how much you love them, why not enjoy them? Let me grab Rosie.”
"Consulting detective, actually. The only one in the world. I invented the job." Noticing the man's confused look, he continued, "When the police are out of their depth, which is always, they consult me."
Falling in love with you
I got another kudos and it made me so happy that I screamed. So, if you like this please leave kudos and comments, I basically live for them and you have no idea how much they motivate me to be as good as I can be!!! I hope you enjoy this kind of strange chapter, loves!
“What do you mean?” He glanced over at him as he waited for the detective to speak.
“We’ve got a heartbeat!” One of the doctors cried. “Oh bloody hell! A fighter this one is!”
They drove for about an hour until Sherlock looked out his window and yelled, “JOHN! Look! Freesias! Look at how beautiful they are!”
After a few minutes they laid back down and fell asleep again, embracing each other.
When John finished making their breakfast, he put it all on a tray and brought it into
had the detective gasping and moaning, the sound like heaven to the doctor’s ears.
“Let’s go, love.”
Gerald looked disgusted. “So, you’re one of them?”
“Hmm?”
Sherlock's moans were almost constant, the sound alone making John so incredibly hard that it almost hurt. He leaned up at the same time Sherlock leaned down, kissing him again. When John broke the kiss, he realized that Sherlock was crying as the younger man tried to steal another kiss, stopping as John's hand pressed against his chest. "Sherlock? Oh god, love, are you okay?" He lifted his hand, bringing it up to Sherlock's cheek, brushing away a single fallen tear. John's face immediately showed concern and panic, "Did I do something wrong? Are you in pain-" he was cut off by Sherlock's lips slamming into his own again.
"Obviously. I thought they... suited you. There's more," He gestured to the bag.
They fell fast asleep. When they woke, Sherlock explained the case to John.
before using all of his energy to crawl back next to the younger man, plopping back down on the bed. Sherlock's eyes were closed, a faint smile playing at his lips, breathing heavily.
Sherlock groaned but continued to look at his microscope, certainly not focusing on whatever was on the slide.
John removed his head from its resting place on Sherlocks chest and pressed a sweet, chaste kiss to his lips and then laid his head down again. They continued to sway.
For a moment, it almost seemed like this newfound arsehole was going to back off. Almost. “It’s hideous!” Gerald yelled, “Both of you are arrogant, disgusting, pedophilic fools! You should be ashamed! You worthless, dirty, fucking homos. You repel me.”
He nodded his head, "Yes, it's Sherlock."
Gerald scoffed. “So, you’re telling me that you’re married… to him?” He shot John a disgusted look.
Sherlock woke first that next morning, feeling more refreshed than he ever had. He got out of bed and shaved, brushed his teeth, and used the loo. When he got back, he noticed that John had woken up. He looked concerned.
“Well, I like being in your bed, Sherlock.”
"This was all her idea. The gifts and the balloons and the cake, she picked out the sunflowers and how the flat would be decorated. She's been having a great time setting this up for you." The taller man leaned in, his lips hovering above John's ear. He brought his voice to a low whisper, "I may have picked up a thing or two,
“John.” Sherlock looked into his eyes, then down to his lips.
With that, Sherlock closed his eyes and fell into a deep sleep as John softly caressed his back. John fell asleep, too, and for the first time in a long time, they both slept through the night without a single nightmare.
He took a deep breath, "I know, Mrs. Thomas. Nothing's going on, I'm uncertain of what exactly is occurring with me lately, but I would be grateful for the opportunity to redo this assignment and I can assure you I will do better."
“Yes, love. Ours. She’s yours as much as she is mine.” John smiled so bright that it had been almost blinding. He grabbed Sherlock by his neck and pulled him down into a quick kiss.
It took the detective a moment too long to realize that he, too, was crying and that the reason John's thumb gently stroked the younger man's cheek and under eye was because there were multiple tears laid upon them.
“Okay?” John asked, looking at Sherlock for confirmation and permission to continue.
"Hmm. Afghanistan. How did you-"
"I think he's going to love it!"
They finished their meal and were nursing a cheesecake with raspberry drizzle and a dollop of whipped cream, which John dipped his finger in and wiped across Sherlock's cheek, getting a heavy chuckle from his date.
Sherlock died. He closed his eyes and began to think: Share a bed? With John Watson? My bed? With John Watson? At the same time? Tonight? Just for a couple weeks. That’s all. Just for a little while. We can do that. I can do that. John Watson, asleep, in my bed, only for a few weeks. Alright, yes, that’s acceptable.
John growled into the kiss and before he knew what was happening, Sherlock was being flipped onto his back, John taking up the position he had been in just a moment ago. Sherlock tried to flip John, but he grabbed his wrists and locked them above Sherlock's head, preventing him from moving. John broke the kiss and stared down at Sherlock, who was silently writhing below him.
Sherlock giggled at that. “John. I was going to say we should move this to my bed but if you’d rather have sex against a door…” Sherlock smiled a dark, sneaky smile and leaned in, whispering by Johns ear, “Well, that could be very easily arranged.”
Sherlock broke the kiss, sighed, then covered John's ears with his hands. "SALLY DONOVAN, IF YOU DON'T GET THE FUCK AWAY FROM US RIGHT NOW, THEN FOR ONCE IN YOUR MISERABLE LIFE YOU'LL BE RIGHT ABOUT SOMETHING. EVERYONE WILL BE STANDING AROUND A BODY AND SHERLOCK HOLMES WILL BE THE ONE TO HAVE PUT IT THERE. NOT JUST ANY BODY, THOUGH.
They both stilled as they heard a loud cry come from Rosie’s baby monitor. John groaned before sitting up and mumbling, “I’m sorry, Sherlock. I better see what’s wrong with her.” He stood up and took a step, halting as he felt Sherlock’s hand wrap around his own.
****************
***********
The detective inhaled and exhaled before smiling and replying, “I love you, too, John.”
“Good morning, John.” He whispered as he scooched closer to John.
John chortled as he removed the ring from the box. He took a deep breath, took Sherlock's hands and brought it to his lips, and while still holding his hand, brought Sherlock in for another kiss as he slid the ring onto his left ring finger. Sherlock felt the coldness of the ring as it made its way onto his finger and happy sobbed as it wrapped around his long, thin finger perfectly. He deepened the kiss, relishing in this incredible moment.
John gasped, whipped his head around and looked through the glass window as he saw Sherlock’s head start to move back and forth, his eyes trying their best to open. He jumped out of his chair and pushed everyone and everything out of the way as he ran to Sherlock’s side, dropping to his knees at the side of the bed and taking Sherlock’s hand into his own.
Sherlock sighed and let go of John, allowing him to walk to the cupboard where he grabbed two plates. When John returned to his spot in front of the stove, Sherlock clung to him again, in the same position as before, drawing a chuckle from John.
John nodded and went off to the bar.
"SHIT!"
"Oh, that you did."
Stop three: Flowers.
John wrote down the measurements and looked up at Sherlock, whose eyes were nearly burning a hole into his skull. Sherlock hopped down off the stand and stepped next to John. "Afghanistan or Iraq?" He asked, staring into John's eyes as he awaited the answer.
John carefully but forcefully slammed his lips against the detectives. He felt a single tear roll down his cheek as he heard Sherlock sob into the kiss. The kiss broke as John removed his shoes and climbed into the bed. He placed both arms around Sherlock and planted feather soft kisses to Sherlock’s curls as he sighed.
Both of them were surprised to hear that they had been talking for over 5 hours. Time passed way too fast for their liking, neither wanting the night to end. They thanked Angelo for his service and Sherlock gave him a generous tip before they walked out the door.
“Excuse me?” Sherlock stepped forward, subconsciously putting himself in front of John. “Are you sure you want to go there?” Sherlock questioned him, his eyes practically saying ‘I dare you. Say something about John and you’ll never see the light of day. Find out just how serious I am.’
Thanks for reading! I hope you like this chapter and if you have any requests or constructive criticism, please don't forget to comment! Thanks, loves <3
“If you would.”
You guessed it. Sherlock and John have a date night.
“God, yes.” John sighed and kissed Sherlock again before he hailed a cab.
The restaurant had a charming, comfortable atmosphere. It was quite nice, definitely no Angelo’s but that was an impossible standard to live up to. There were candles on the table and soothing music played softly in the background.
"Wait, love. You thought I wasn't coming back? Ever?"
Sherlock blushed and locked eyes with the shorter man again, "That's not what people normally say."
Sherlock gave John’s forehead a soft kiss. “Wake up, John. We’re home,” he whispered, the hand that wasn’t holding John’s began to push the silver hair falling over the doctor’s eyes back to its place.
“What?”
Sherlock brought the fixed tea into his bedroom and watched as the doctor hoisted himself into a sitting position, then handed it to John. “Ta.” He moaned as the hot liquid ran down his throat and took another sip. They stayed quiet, sipping their tea until it was gone. John laid down again and felt a pair of thin arms wrap around his frame, a whisper of a kiss on his neck, and the detective’s legs tangling his own. They both fell fast to sleep.
*********
In other words,
"Sherlock, love, we all know you're an amazing, fantastic, extraordinary genius, but we do have neighbours."
On Jupiter and Mars
"I love you, too, baby. Thank you." He sighed as Sherlock kissed his forehead, again.
Until…
John laughed. “You get shot and you’re asking me if I’m alright. If anyone should be asking that question, it’s me.”
“You want me to get more hot water?” James asked, eager to serve.
“Yes,” he confirmed. “Now we must get into the house before our hunter makes another attempt.” He pulled me up the steps, retrieved his latchkey from his pocket, and opened the door, shoving me inside.
“You come solo this time, Doctor, sir,” he remarked, breaking the silence.
“Wiggins!” I exclaimed in shock. “What the devil are you doing here?”
We were in Paris when a man came to see the Irishman. He was a small, plain man, but he had a hard face and a blunt manner. I knew him to be one of the Irishman’s upper servants, left in charge of his empire in London while we meandered around Europe, spending money. They were closeted together for hours in our suite, while I went out and sat in one of the cafés, watching the world go by and flirting with whomever passed, both male and female. And they flirted back. I was beautiful and I knew it, so why not enjoy it? But I never acted on any of the many invitations I received. To do so would have been the end of me.
Charles Griffith sent a bouquet of blue flowers. About six months later Holmes showed me a notice in ‘The Times’ of his engagement to the daughter of a peer. “A friend of his father’s,” Holmes commented. “They belong to the same club. And so it continues.”
“You’ll pay for that, John,” he said darkly. “You will both pay for that betrayal. I swear it! Now ready yourself. The carriage is waiting to take us away.”
“I swear on the life of me own mother, Guv!” Mick avowed.
But my cheeks burned with shame when I remembered that once I had been much like them. Those were days I now preferred to forget. As if I ever could.
He squinted at my wound. It was minor compared with what Holmes had endured, but I knew the Irishman well enough to gauge his reaction. He had an almost pathological fear of injury and disease. Long ago I used that apprehension to convince him to let me begin my medical studies. I told him that having his own physician, one he could trust implicitly, would be to his benefit. And it worked – for a while.
As a boy I never understood it. But as I grew older I came to believe that my resemblance to my mother, whose loss they could never reconcile, made my very existence painful to them. Seeing me so alive and with such high spirits always put my father in a black mood. And my brother, a decade older and constantly away at school, was a shadowy attendant at holidays and other special occasions. I barely remember him speaking more than a few sentences to me before I, too, was sent away to school at the age of ten.
“Do you really love him so much?” The Irishman’s voice was softer now. But that meant he was even more dangerous, for he was revealing a side of him that was close to human. And humans are even more deadly creatures than machines.
A trio of cello, violin, and flute was playing, so I listened for a while. Then I moved off to the card room. Some ladies were playing at whist, but a table of gentlemen in the corner were engaged in a game with which I was unfamiliar. They were seriously intent on their cards and gambling heavily – I saw piles of money that made my palms itch. I squinted, trying to understand what the game was about.
“Oh,” said Holmes. “Did I neglect to mention that Mycroft is the present Earl?”
“Holmes, please clear the room,” I commanded.
“I knew you were mine, Johnny Lad,” he whispered. “Body and soul. I’ll never let you go. Never. Never. Never...”
“So Mycroft is the Earl of Sherringford?”
“Was it that bad?”
I retreated to my room, to my bed, waiting and brooding long hours until the afternoon turned into evening.
I turned to look and saw a fresh bruise slowly blooming just where my right shoulder met my neck. “Nothing. Nothing at all.”
“Horrible,” I pronounced and set it back on the bar.
“So, Barton,” I said to the valet as we propped up Young Griffith with extra pillows. “Am I correct in surmising that you are the cousin of the footmen at Sherringford, James and Henry?”
“The Glendalough Gallery. I have never heard of the place.”
I hadn’t thought much beyond finding the cat. “I will fulfill my promise to Wiggins to look after her. The animal is obviously important to him.”
“No?” I said. “I thought you had been there.”
“A pretty thing, isn’t it?” The voice purred in my ear. “A lovely female, but not so fetching as her darling son. Isn’t that so, Johnny Lad?”
Holmes perused the periodical. “I have told you, my dear boy, that the solving of crime and romance are completely at odds! One is the result of logic, deduction, and sheer brainwork, while the other is a chimera of sentiment and ridiculous emotion!”
We then walked in silence down Old Compton towards Charing Cross, looking for a cab. We paused on the corner. The hour was late and the spring fog heavy over the slumbering city.
She went on her way, while James, Gladstone, and I headed back to 221b.
“I don’t mind. Here.” The boy was undoing my collar. “This is my favorite part. You already know what I look like in the all-together, but I  never know what a gentleman looks like ’til I unwrap him.” He proceeded to unbutton my shirt. “Oh, I like this! I like a hairy bloke. Such a clean-shaven gentleman you are, but such a mass of fur underneath. That’s a real man, that is!”
“A little more,” said Bill. “But just a little. We’ll be back in three days. Then we expect payment in full.”
There was nothing more to be said.
“It doesn’t matter,” said the Irishman. “I’ll see you both in Hell!”
“But you cannot keep this incident a secret,” Holmes observed. “This is not a momentary fancy by a foolish boy. This is serious business! My friend Watson’s business is to heal your son’s wounds, but my business is to get to the bottom of enigmas. Which is why I must ask the obvious question – why would your son want to hang himself?”
“A minder,” I said. “That’s what they’re called. Minders.”
“I am, Doctor,” the fellow boasted. “I even got me own room over by Charing Cross. I works as a messenger for the telegraph office in Oxford Street. I get wages and I keeps all my tips!”
“That is putting it mildly,” Holmes laughed. “They revile me because I know when they’re lying. In Group you’re supposed to tell the truth, but they rarely do. For instance, when Betty first came here she told a story about her wonderful family and how supportive they were of her recovery. But it was all lies. Her husband left at least a year ago and her children are indifferent to her. She also has a harridan of a mother who screams at her during their weekly phone call and sends her religious tracts that implore her to accept Jesus Christ as her Personal Saviour or else be damned to Hell for her sins. She is in this dismal institution because she has nowhere else to go. And then there is Mr. Blake, the distinguished older gentleman.”
I stared at my new acquaintance with skeptical fascination. “And what else do you think you can deduce about me?”
Something within me sighed in relief. Going home was the beginning of normality and I longed for things to be back to normal – with one vital alteration.
To Mycroft's estate.
The tall man, his eyes closed in bliss, suddenly opened them. He stopped the lad’s ministrations  and raised him to his feet. Then he lay Thommie on the velvet-covered divan, lifted his legs high, and began to fuck him vigourously.
The lad shook his head. “I only saw him a few times, briefly. He always came to my lodgings after dark. And he usually sent Dilly’s brother to collect the money.”
And Holmes was much in my thoughts as I made my way down Regent Street towards Piccadilly.
We were in Holmes’ bed moments later.
Group plummeted downhill from there.
“He can’t stand the sight of blood,” Holmes commented, bolting down the whiskey. He was making a good show of pretending he wasn’t in pain, but I knew him well enough to know the truth. “I could not believe he attempted to nurse me before you came, Watson. Poor Brother Mycroft is undoubtedly sitting in a private room, fanning himself to prevent hyperventilation.”
But I shook off his touch. It was the last thing in the world I desired. “Don’t call me your ‘dear boy’! I am not a boy! I have never felt like a boy, not even when I was a child! Perhaps that’s part of my problem, the reason I cannot find peace. And the reason I can never hope to find happiness!”
There I paused for a while in Salzburg, listening to Mozart, marveling at the Alps, and eating cream pastries. Then I took a train into Italy, stopping in Venice, Florence, and thence on to Rome, the Eternal City.
“We have the ‘Times’ from yesterday,” he replied. “I’m afraid today’s edition will not arrive until this evening. But we have a morning paper from Chichester.”
“Solitary, but not lonely,” Holmes shrugged. “I made my own life even as a boy. I studied and in my spare time I read the popular papers – the servants gladly obtained for me the most lurid of the penny presses in return for a small fraction of my allowance. Crime in all its aspects intrigued me from an early age. I remember reading ‘Macbeth’ and thinking that the man might well have gotten away with his murder if only he had not depended on an hysterical female as his partner in crime!”
“Weak,” I said. “Alive. I... had a fever?”
Holmes found a folded towel on the shelf above the cupboard. I took it and carefully opened the small door. “Here, Moggy. Good pussycat.”
Mick writhed like a fish on a hook. “Yeah, he was one. The last one. Dilly said they was in love. Said they was going off together to America and live like husband and wife. I told Dilly she was bloody balmy! No toff is gonna take some Mary Ann across the ocean, especially when she’s sickly, like.”
Thus I came to be the last of our family.
“Yes,” I whispered. “It would be very much to my liking.”
Blasted insufferable fellow!
“Make yourselves at home in my parlour, gents,” said Mick, sweeping his arm to indicate the cramped cell. “Shall I order tea and crumpets? Sorry I don’t got a bench for you to rest your laurels upon, but I got plenty o’ straw you can sit on. And if you feel the need to relieve yourselves, the bucket is in the corner.”
Charles Griffith's story.
I had no doubt I would be accepted, and I still had my father’s money in trust for my education to pay for my fees and books, so the main obstacle was, of course, the Irishman. But I needed to waste no time, for the term was due to start in a few weeks.
“But we caught the murderers red-handed, Mr. Holmes!” boasted Constable Clark.
“But not many men are like Holmes,” Stamford affirmed. “His oddness is... excessive. And you are his closest friend. You live here with him and have done so for years. Let us say that your relationship with Holmes might seem... questionable to some people.”
“I’m certain I shall be,” I replied.
“Mr. Michael Wiggins has a situation in town. He’s doing well, I’m told.”
After one more round of handshakes and embraces the pair scampered up the ramp, off on their adventure.
“But isn’t a card game all about luck?” I asked.
“We have not had a falling out,” I reassured her. “This is a personal matter. It has nothing to do with Holmes. Nothing at all. But I must go. Tomorrow.” I hated lying to the woman, but it was the only way. “James has promised to look after Holmes and make certain the rooms are not completely destroyed. And to clean up after his messes – or as best he is able to do so.”
I HATE SALLY DONOVAN SO MUCH IT ALMOST PAINS ME.
What John didn’t expect was for Sherlock to jump in front of him, getting himself shot in the chest. What the killer didn’t expect was for John to draw his gun, close his eyes, and fire a single shot, shooting him between the eyes. John watched as the detective clutched his chest and fell to the floor. For a moment he couldn’t tell what had just happened. He couldn’t move, he couldn’t breathe. He was useless.
"Oh. Do you not know how to skate, love?"
Sherlock moved the hand not around John’s waist up to his hair and pulled it back, breaking the kiss and exposing John’s neck. He slowly kissed his way along his jawline, down his neck and collarbones, stopping every few moments to suck a bruise into John’s skin. He scraped his teeth along John’s collarbones, drawing a hiss from above him, and then ran his tongue over it, soothing the sting.
"Alrighty, boys. We're closing up, now. It's half past 11, you two should head on home."
They did their usual bedtime routines, climbed onto the mattress and fell asleep in each other’s arms.
“Yes, out. We will head to the crime scene soon. Bye.” Sherlock quickly walked over to him, pushing him out the door.
***********
He slowly moved himself out of his position in John’s arms, careful not to wake him. He got up and went to the bathroom to do his regular morning routine, blushing like mad at the thought of John’s body pressed so close against his own.
*6:15 AM*
A short nod from Sherlock confirmed that he could still hear me and was still conscious.
Sherlock's hands left their position over John's ears and one found it's way to the back of his neck, the other softly stroking John's smiling cheek. "Sherlock, that was bloody gorgeous. I have been waiting for that to happen since the moment I met her and she told me to stay away from you."
“Well, there’s only two bedrooms. You could put Rosie’s bed in my bedroom and you could take the room upstairs? I spend far less time sleeping than you both, so I could sleep on the sofa and you could use my bedroom.”
John lets out a hearty guffaw at Sherlock's embarrassed face before taking his hands and pulling him off the bed.
John gave Sherlock a tight nod before stepping away from the man on the floor and stomping towards the door.
"John? John!" Sherlock sits up, throwing his arms around John so quickly that it almost makes him dizzy. "I'm so sorry, John. Please. I didn't mean to hurt you, I wasn't thinking.
*******************
“John, last night was the best night of my life. I hope to have many, many, many, many, more nights just like that one. I’m sorry, I just woke up first and decided to freshen up a bit for you.” He brought John into a comforting embrace, placing a gentle kiss on the top of his head.
“Hi,” He cleared his throat, “I need to get this suit-” Sherlock held up the see-through garment bag that covered a beautiful burgundy suit, “tailored for a case.”
Take my hand
"Oh, Sherlock," John whispers, letting Sherlock's wrists wrap around him again. He feels his own arms snake around Sherlock's waist, pulling him closer, tighter against his chest. They stay embraced for just a moment longer before John pulls back again. He sneaks his right hand up to the side of Sherlock's face, noticing the stickiness of it, immediately understanding that Sherlock has spent the last 8 hours crying. His thumb gently strokes Sherlock's cheek, watching confusion plaster itself onto Sherlock's features.
"Sherlock," John whispered, eyes darting to Sherlock's plush lips and then back to his eyes.
John opened the book and tears immediately began forming. His eyes scanned over her first picture, at Mary's ultrasound, then a picture of Mary holding her, a picture of her first diaper being changed, a picture of her in a little dress, a couple others of her just in the moment, the rest all taken after Mary's passing. All of her captured 'firsts' had been put into the book, little notes about the dates and small details written in Sherlock's handwriting.
Both men ordered and as they awaited their food, neither could stop smiling, blushing, giggling, and staring. Neither said a word, it wasn’t necessary to. Words couldn’t express the love that filled the consulting detectives’ eyes, and nothing could express the joy and complete adoration the doctor felt.
"ME! Me! Me! I want cake for breakfast, Papa!" Rosie jumped off the floor and ran to the kitchen, opened the fridge, and pointed to the top shelf where the cake had been placed.
They settled down and Sherlock leaned down to kiss John. It was supposed to be a quick kiss, just another “good morning” kiss. It was. But it wasn’t. It became a deep, passionate kiss almost immediately. John softly moaned as Sherlock nibbled on his lip and kissed him again.
He vaguely remembered the ride to the hospital.
They paid, left the restaurant, and in too big of a rush to walk, hailed a cab back to 221B. Sherlock, basically bouncing with excitement, tumbled with, and eventually cursed at, his keys before unlocking the door to their flat, drawing a chuckle from John.
Sherlock moaned, rather obscenely, as John's finger curled. John enjoyed what it did to him, so, of course, he did it again and again and again, until he felt Sherlock was ready for a second finger, then he did it some more. Sherlock's moan turned into an almost scream as the older man's fingers brushed his prostate.
Sherlock gasped as his eyes found the man in bulky camouflage turn the corner. Sherlock was suddenly running, feet pounding on the hard tile floors of the airport, tears burning his eyes, clouding his vision, the only audible sound being his heartbeat coursing through his ears.
"John? John, John, baby, look. I'm right here. See?" Sherlock picked up John's shaking hands and brought them to his bare chest, allowing John to feel the heat of his skin and the pounding of his heartbeat. "It was just a nightmare. I'm here. Okay? Are you okay?" Concern and fear washed over Sherlock's features as the doctor came out of his nightmare induced trance.
John dove under the covers, slicking up his left hand and placing it against Sherlock's entrance, simultaneously pressing his lips to Sherlock's thighs, abdomen, and eventually his cock. Sherlock couldn't decide whether he should plead for more or just come right then and there as John's left-hand index finger circled around Sherlock's entrance. John must've realized Sherlock's position because with a final lick, he withdrew his mouth from around his cock and focused solely on the task at (left) hand, which was to prepare him.
“Sherlock. I’m so angry. I’m so fucking angry.” John closed his eyes and willed himself to breathe deep, even breaths before trying again. “I’m not angry at you. I’m just – I don’t understand how people can be like that.” He opened his eyes and brought his hand to Sherlock’s face, wiping away a single fallen tear with his thumb. “Love, look at me.” Sherlock hesitated for a moment, but lifted his head, “I’m so sorry you got hurt, love.” He gently brushed Sherlock’s cheekbone, which was bloody and bruising, with his thumb.
"God, I'm so sorry, Sherlock. I didn't mean to scare you, I just needed a little time. I couldn't leave you permanently, even if I wanted to."
The smooth music began playing and the fathers started dancing again.
“I’m so fucking glad you’re okay, Sherlock. I honestly don’t know what I would’ve done if you had-”
John looked over, there was an enormous field full of multicolored flowers. He then glanced at Sherlock. There was pure awe etched onto his face. Before John could realize what he was doing, he pulled over, parking on the side of the road, and stepping out of the car.
"I could." John's voice broke the silence. "I could... I do. I love him." Sherlock's head shot up and his posture straightened at John's words. "And Sally, you are awful. You disgust me. I can't even fathom why you hate Sherlock so much. He is absolutely brilliant." John risked a quick glance at Sherlock, then averted his furious gaze to Sally, "I believe," he had an almost murderous smile on his face, "I believe that if there is anyone here that doesn't deserve love, have love, or is capable of love, it's you."
*****************
“Woah, woah, woah! Slow down there, you big git.”
John gently set the book on the bed before leaping onto Sherlock, his arms instinctively wrapping around the shorter man's body. "I love it so much, Sherlock. It's perfect." He sniffled again before tightening his hold around Sherlock's neck and slamming their lips together. The taller man smiled into their kiss; he moved his hands down to the back of John's thighs and lifted him up, drawing a muffled squeal from the doctor, who quickly wrapped his legs around the taller man's waist. "Thank you, love. It's perfect. I couldn't have asked for something so wonderful. Thank you," he whispered before kissing him again.
“Yes,” I said, turning away. “Conform and work the program.”
The Irishman blinked. Now I had surprised him. “Don’t toy with me, John Watson. That is a dangerous game.”
I found myself on the Strand and then in Trafalgar, then turned up St. Martin’s Lane until I stood before the Salisbury, the public house I had gone to with Mick.
Holmes’ eyes glittered. “Bees are deucedly fascinating, my dear fellow! The order of their society! The logic of their behavior! They are without language, without intellect, and even without souls, all the elements we mortal men deem necessary for civilization, yet bees have something we might call a civilization. They work, they cooperate, each in his own place, and each for the good of all!”
The man indicated that we follow him down a hall and up a back staircase. Above was another room, this one smaller than the theatre below. Chairs were grouped around a raised platform. On the platform was a divan covered with a velvet drapery. A few men were already sitting, most well-dressed older gentlemen. They glanced at us with curiosity, but then looked away. The man collected our money and then left.
“Yes!” said Holmes, leaning forward, his interest sparked once again. “There’s only one man in England who owns one, and only one man, his henchman, who can wield it. I fear I am coming too close to them for comfort and they have decided to eliminate me. But, alas, you were almost taken out instead.”
I didn’t expect a response. In fact, I was amazed his eyes were yet open. For on the small side table next to the sofa lay his morocco case. Inside were his syringe and needles.
“Dr. Watson!”
“Why?” he asked again. “I want to know!”
“Dollar, Guv,” said Mick, cheeky as ever. “Not shilling.”
“Why do you care about the fates of two slum whores?” the Irishman grumbled. “They are beneath your notice.”
“Would you like some Earl Grey?” Holmes asked, holding the teapot aloft.
“Ah, yes,” said the Irishman. He put his hand on my shoulder. His touch felt too familiar. “Should I search you further? Are you carrying a revolver?”
I didn’t answer. But how could I banish from my thoughts the only thing that might sustain me?
“Your room?” I frowned. Why would the fellow want me to see his room?
“Yes, whatever you wish.”
That startled me. “Prison?”
I stood up and gently guided James to the door of the sitting room. “Follow your heart. If you do that then you will never go wrong.”
“Yes,” he said. “I liked him from the start. I knew on sight that he was a genius – like recognized like, I suppose. And he was tall and dark-haired, and handsome and witty in a roguish, sarcastic way. Grandfather immediately took a dislike to him. He was from a good, but impoverished family, but he wasn’t...” Holmes paused and glanced at me. “He wasn’t aristocratic enough for the old man’s taste. But since he was a friend of Mycroft’s, he was allowed to stay. Grandfather was away all that summer in France and my tutor and I had the estate to ourselves, except for the servants. We did calculations and talked Mathematics, but also Astronomy and Physics – he knew those subjects inside out. And we also talked of... of crime.”
And he looked at me.
“My first time,” I admitted. I bolted down one drink and began on the second.
“I’d work for a pittance, sir! And I’d sleep in the closet or in the kitchen!” James insisted. “Anything to go to London!”
The Irishman’s eyes never wavered from mine. “I advise you to drink it. All of it.”
“I like them older.” The young scoundrel licked his lips lewdly. “They always have a lot in their bag of tricks.”
“How is your leg today, Watson?” Holmes inquired.
I let the tea slip down my throat. “Thank you. I am sorry to have been so much trouble.”
“Myself,” I replied.
“But...” James cast me a beseeching glance.
“Surely at that juncture the police should have been called!” I asserted.
She shut my file and tossed it on the desk. “You will, John. Or should I say Dr. Watson? Fred, do you have anything to add?”
“You’re new here,” he stated. His accent was Oxbridge sharp, with a superior manner to match.
Faint hope!
“But we have a little time for this,” he whispered. And he held me and kissed me. Kissed me forcefully, almost brutally. But I did not flinch, although I hated him with all my heart and all my soul.
“That he may be,” she said. “But the girls below stairs are already all agog over him. He’s a disruptive influence, mark my words.”
I turned and strode to the door. The shadows of falling night lay heavy in the corners and in the rooms beyond. A shudder coursed through me.
“Sherlock,” interrupted the impatient Fred. “You know the rules. First names only. Now, John, Group is at three o’clock and dinner is served between five and six. Sherlock will show you to the dining room.”
I snorted at that characterization. “From what I hear of the Earl, he should have been the last person to upbraid anyone for their bad behavior!”
But the Irishman wanted him dead and if I killed Holmes I would be fulfilling his evil wishes for my own selfish needs. I would be no better than my dark, diabolic lover.
“What else is there to do but jest? At least until this case is broken.”
Holmes took a deep breath. “Only 14! That is quite bad.”
“It isn’t the secrecy, Watson,” said Holmes. “It’s the idea that a certain order is maintained, even if that order is a complete fiction. We pretend that I am sleeping in my own bed and the servants pretend that I am sleeping in my own bed. Hence, in the eyes of the world I am certainly sleeping in my own bed. Without such fictions a moral society could not function.”
“We are hardly joined at the hip,” I commented. “It’s only an informal dinner party.”
“I knew it!” cried Wilde. “The eyes are the same. And your face…”
“He ran off,” said Holmes. “Into the woods.”
“A valet is a waste of good man power,” Holmes said dismissively. “I will take care of my own unpacking and dressing, as will Watson. We are both able-bodied fellows, fully competent to care for our own needs!”
The women and other servants left the room and I endeavoured to examine my patient. There was no blood to be seen and he was conscious, if unresponsive. But he would not release the bedclothes.
“Hammond?”
Is it any wonder that after I obtained my medical degree I was eager to leave England and make my fortune with Her Majesty’s forces in the East?
Now it was clear. Well, at least he hadn’t jumped the wall and escaped. “So you suggested that I would be a good substitute for your minder.”
Alfie seized my hand and squeezed it. “That’s good of you, Doctor! If Mr. Sherlock can see it clear to help Mr. Charles, then he’s a fine, fine fellow to my mind – even if he is the Earl’s brother!”
The room was shabby, but tidy. A tiny window overlooked a patch of yard behind the building. He had some pictures ripped out of the newspapers tacked up on the wall over his narrow bed: an elegant woman in an evening gown, a pugilist with fists raised, a racehorse, and other trifles. His extra clothes were neatly folded and stored on a shelf alongside a flat cap and a battered straw boater. He even had a small rag rug on the floor, on which he had set a pair of red carpet slippers. I had to admit that Young Wiggins was much more orderly in his personal surroundings than Holmes himself.
“That’s impossible!” I stated. I had learned enough mathematics from the Jesuits to knew that what the Irishman was claiming was beyond the scope of the mind of a mere mortal. Or most mortals. “Even a prodigy would not be able to perform in such a manner!”
The Irishman’s grey eyes flashed with anger. “Luck! You would lay your life upon luck? Luck is for the weak of mind. Luck is for women. Luck is for those doomed to lose.”
“No,” said Holmes. “It does not. If you had wanted me to know any of those things, I trust you would have spoken up about it. It is not in my nature to pry.”
“Well,” she said, weakening.
“I think I had better leave Italy,” I said, pushing back my chair and standing up. The entire country suddenly seemed full of hideous dangers. “Now I am afraid to go anywhere!”
“Then you are an ass,” Holmes muttered under his breath. He glanced at me. Then he stepped swiftly to the inner door and opened it before Lestrade had a chance to protest.
A moment later the game was over. The other players threw in their cards and the bald man lay his hand on the table and gathered in his winnings gleefully.
“I know, Mick,” I said. “Try to calm yourself.”
“I never gamble,” he corrected me. “I place wagers, but only when I am assured I will be the winner.”
Some of these Englishmen (and Englishwomen, too) in exile were there to escape the notorious British weather, either for matters of health or preference. Others were students of History or Art, steeping themselves in the Cradle of Western Culture.
Unless, of course, I can attract a few more patients.
“But he was going to kill me,” I pointed out.
“And why in heaven’s name would King James want to do that?” I inquired with growing exasperation.
“You will know what you need to know when I wish to tell you,” the Irishman said irritably. “And not before. So shut your gob for now!”
“What was your name again?” my new roommate asked, although I know he’d heard it perfectly well the first time.
Not then.
I presented myself as the perfect chaperon for the attaché’s wife and daughter on their journey and was happily accepted. The truth is that I fancied myself in love with the daughter. And with his wife. That was the trouble. I found myself courting the girl, while having an affair with the woman. It was most confusing, but also most delightful. The daughter was petite and blonde with a laugh like a babbling brook, while the mother was redhaired and buxom, a lusty female who made me forget my close calls with the gentlemen in Italy, and especially the Irishman.
“Mr. Holmes,” the warder, Mr. Collins, greeted my friend. “Back again so soon? You must like it here.” He was a whip-spare man with a gallows sense of humor, if that is not inappropriate to say in such a circumstance. “Perhaps you and the good doctor would like to move in – permanently?”
“I don’t have the pox, if that’s what you mean!” I retorted. Too late I realized that if the Irishman did believe I was diseased, he might be put off. But I was not and he knew it. He seemed to know everything about me – my health, my habits, even the women I had slept with.
I picked up the gun and opened the chamber. Six bullets were within. I could almost hear him calling to me, “Watson! Bring your revolver! The game is afoot!”
It sounded odd to hear Holmes referred to as the young master. I tried to picture him as a boy, but never had a man seemed to have been born fully formed as did Sherlock Holmes.
“In which to place Wiggins’ cat. Unless you expect to carry it through the streets of London in your arms, which is not terribly feasible considering the contrary personalities of most felines.”
“But you are ready,” he said, moving closer. “He who travels light, travels fast. You are a soldier, Johnny Lad. You travel light and fast.”
But I was intercepted. “Come, Watson!” said Holmes, seizing my arm. “There’s no time for this tomfoolery. We have important business to attend to. Life and death business.”
“No, my dear fellow,” said Sherlock Holmes. “I am a detective. A consulting detective to be precise. And the best in the world, if I may be so egotistical to say so. I have solved cases for everyone from the inspectors at New Scotland Yard to our own Royal Family, from His Holiness the Pope to a high official in the Kremlin, as well as a number of billionaire industrialists and Hollywood film stars.”
I swallowed. My throat felt dry and constricted. “And you knew of my previous relationship with... with the Irishman. You knew it even before he sent you those... those drawings of me from so long ago.”
“It must have been a misunderstanding,” she said soothingly. “They must have gone astray in the post. That is why I came again today to see you. I only wished to ascertain for myself that you were indeed well. I could not allow myself to entertain the thought that you might be... be...”
“Grease?” said Holmes. “Nonsense! These are far from greasy. And they are your favorite kind, sage and onion.”
The Irishman went to the table and picked up a bottle of wine. A single delicate crystal glass stood, waiting to be filled – but only one. “And what do you have of value as pledge for such a loan?”
“Splendid,” said Holmes. “The air will do us both a world of good. And we’ll bring the dog. It will do you good, too, won’t it, Gladstone?”
“Good lord, Mick!” I said. “How can you joke about this grave situation?”
That concerned me. “I must go over and see Dilly today. That cell is damp and airless, the worst possible place for a consumptive.”
“You need it no longer,” I asserted. “I will help you! I have always tried to help you, but you would never listen.”
Chapter 44:
The young man in the bed shut his eyes and turned his face away, a single tear coursing down his handsome face.
I had little spare money to pay for companionship, but I swiftly found that I did not need it to attract the notice of the fairer sex. In fact, there were friendly females everywhere I turned – barmaids, serving girls, widows who offered rooms for rent, married ladies of a certain age who invited a lonely young Englisher to tea, even a black-eyed gypsy in a caravan by a deserted roadside. I may have been a late-bloomer physically, but I was quickly catching up in that phase of my education.
“Have it your own way,” I said. “But for my part, I need a drink.”
Holmes and I went behind the curtain and sat by Dilly’s bedside, listening to his labored breathing.
“Mr. Holmes, we got the driver and the other man, but where is the Professor?”
“And do you have a place to stay upon release?” Her manner was friendly, but businesslike. “Or a position? We find that our successful graduates have a plan and a routine to return to – a job, a flat, supportive friends.”
“Are you alone, dearie?”
Words finally spoken...
The house was quiet. Everyone, from Mrs. Hudson and James, to the scullery maid and Gladstone and the cat, was deep in slumber.
“Thanks, Captain.” He tipped his cloth cap. “Enjoy the show.”
Then there was a loud crack and the carriage halted altogether.
“Or until we can fly across like those birds.” James pointed to a gull swooping over the harbour. “Never fear, Mick. We’ll probably be sick together. They call it feeding the fishes.”
“And you look... gorgeous,” I breathed.
“What the devil do you mean?” I cried. “What happened to them?”
“I knew them two would come to no good,” the man snorted. “On the game, the both o’ them! I’m the landlord ’ere. You a copper?”
Something cool on my brow.
James went down to get my toast and I considered all I had to do in the next two days. Settling my accounts would be fairly simple – I had some money in the bank, enough to cover my modest outlays. Luckily I had not been indulging in betting on the horses as of late. And my practice would be in good hands with Dr. Anstruther. Perhaps I could even direct a few of my patients to Stamford, although Chelsea was a bit far from Marylebone. Mrs. Hudson might cry when I told her I must leave – that would be difficult to bear. But it would not be a total surprise to her, for we had already discussed it. And I realized that the idea of leaving this place – and forsaking Sherlock Holmes – had been growing in my mind for a long time. But it took the Irishman to put the plan into place.
There it was. The great unspoken. “I like Mick, too,” I said defiantly.
My mind turned to Holmes. How was he bearing up? And his wound – was it giving him pain? I should have seen him that day and changed his dressings, but I had no word from either him or Mycroft and I dared not seek him out until summoned.
It was quiet in the baths that afternoon – I seemed to be the only patron. The place was much busier in the morning, when men came before going to their offices in nearby Whitehall, and then again in the evening, when they came for a relaxing steam before repairing to their clubs in St. James.
“I think you need more of your brother’s water of life,” I said, rising from the sofa. “I’ll get it.”
Nothing more.
All the pain and fear would be over, then. Moriarty would be defeated, deprived of the satisfaction of gloating about his triumph over Holmes. And I would be free, finally.
“Yes, it was wonderful, Jane,” Miss Morstan added. Then she turned to me. “I am a governess and although my employer, Mrs. Forrester, keeps a decent kitchen, I rarely have a meal such as this.”
I did and soon fell asleep.
“I understand,” James nodded. “You’ve looked after him all these years, haven’t you, sir?”
Watson shaken back to the present.
And we strode off together into the swirling fog.
“Good Lord!” I exclaimed, taking out my handkerchief and covering my nose. “He’s been doing that all morning! What in the name of heaven did you feed him, Holmes?”
“Quite right,” I agreed, as we stepped into the cab and moments later were trotting westward.
The look on his face tore me in twain. It was as if all his hopes had been dashed to pieces and all his fears had come to fruition.
“Thank you.”
This was not to Holmes’ liking. “Dash it, man! I wanted to show you the hives! They are extraordinary. And the beekeeper is a droll fellow. His hives provide honey for all the villages in the area. There is some in this pot, I believe. Lovell – this is the Sherringford honey, is it not?”
I hailed a cab and directed it to an address in Hampstead, to a house I knew all too well, but had not seen the inside of in almost eight years – not since shortly before I met Sherlock Holmes.
He did not reply or even look at me. He got out of the carriage and spoke to one of his servants, while the rest scrambled around the carriage, piling trunks on a trolley to take to the ship. And I sat there, alone inside, considering my fate.
“Thank you, Mr. Lovell,” I said.
Having procured the requisite box from a seller of onions and leeks at the vegetable market, we proceeded to Mick Wiggins’ lodgings in an alley off Charing Cross.
“I see. So when you met someone here in London it was different.”
“I don’t care for your choice of playmates,” he upbraided me. I thought I even detected a note of disappointment in his tone. Or was it jealousy?
“As do I, dear lady,” I replied with a bow.
But he didn’t kiss me. He held me close to him. I could feel his member harden in his trousers as it pressed against me. His cold grey eyes were now hot and blazing with lust.
“Athena, then,” said Holmes. “The goddess of wisdom and war -- an apt analogy.”
I closed my eyes. “Yes,” I said. “I mean it. Truly.”
“And what is that, pray?” I huffed.
“Welcome, sirs.” Hammond ushered us in. “I’m very pleased to have you. The back parlour is free this evening, Thommie.”
And now the date was here.
When I awoke the next morning, I was alone. At least in the bed. I don’t remember Holmes leaving – or young James coming into the room to light the fire and fill the ewer with hot water for shaving.
I paused. What to say to James? He was not a stupid fellow, but he was also an innocent. How could he possibly understand my... my wayward conduct?
Watson prepares for bed at the estate.
“You have left debts all over this city,” he continued. “They are not substantial obligations, as such things are understood.”
I didn’t reply.
“Oh, I’m finished with that!” Mick said. “It was fine as a lark, but I’ve my eye on bettering meself.”
“It’s a long story, Mrs. Hudson,” I said, feeling the full weight of my guilt. This would affect not only Holmes and myself, but the entire household. “But I believe the time has come for me to make my own way in the world – without Mr. Holmes.”
My father died while I was in the Dutch seminary, so I had a small allowance from my inheritance, as well as a sum of money in trust for my education, whatever I should choose to pursue. But I was sick of study, sick of being cooped up, sick of being told what to do from morning until night. Therefore I decided to remain on the continent for at least a little while longer.
Holmes curled his lip in distaste. “Yes, yes. I’m supposed to go every day to some meeting place in a church hall around the corner from here. But what about you? Are you doing that?”
“Perhaps.” Holmes shrugged. “But I never felt like a child. I believe I was born old.”
“See that you do.” Holmes hustled the man out into the hall and shut the door. “He may be of some use. If anyone comes to search their rooms, he’s sure to be right there to hinder them.”
“Have you worked at this establishment long?” Holmes probed.
“A light, mister? Can I get a light?”
“But Mycroft is a man of inaction,” Holmes said, regarding the pipe in his hand. “Sitting in one spot for months on end, lost only in one’s own thoughts, would for my brother be heaven upon this earth. For me, it would be a torture.” Holmes sat straighter in his chair, his eyes glittering. “I must have work, Watson! I must have stimulation of the mind! But with it I must also have action of the body. The two must needs work together or else it is all in vain! Then I must numb myself. Or seek stimulation of a different kind.”
“My servant?” I frowned.
I was at a loss for any of those. “I have my Army pension. I was on disability and before that in convalescent hospital. My few belongings are in storage. I suppose I’ll look for digs in the city... somewhere. And then try for a job. Perhaps the Army can advise me on something.”
“And if you do not turn up,” he added, his voice sharper now. “I will come and collect you. Because now that you are mine, I am not planning to let you go again. I vow that no one else shall ever have you – only me. Do you hear me and understand, Johnny Lad?”
“It’s nice to know that some things never change,” I observed.
“Doctor!” he cried, his eyes brightening. “And you, too, Guv’nor! I knew you’d come and spring us. We didn’t do nothin’, I swear it! When we come in, Bill was already stone dead.”
James set down the tray on the bed-stand. “Nothing yet, Mr. Sherlock. Harry rode down to the village to make certain a telegram hadn’t gone awry, but there was nothing from London.”
Shot. The roadside. Moriarty. “Yes. I think I remember. How long ago was that?”
“I... I think so.” My head ached and my limbs were trembling. I reached for my top hat, which had fallen from my head.
The question took me by surprise. “Love him?”
“They were,” Holmes replied. “They met in Boston. My father gave a lecture at Harvard and my mother attended.”
I do not remember how I got to the Diogenes Club. By hansom cab, I believe. Or perhaps I flew over the city like a bird. I only know that I don’t recall getting there, only reading Mycroft’s telegram, feeling my heart come to a standstill, and then arriving at the door, my medical bag in hand.
“Ah!” Holmes laughed. “Good old Watson! I knew I could count on you. Always at the ready whenever the bugle calls. Come, my dear boy – the game is afoot!”
Holmes shrugged. “All men are dangerous when cornered. That is why I have taken precautions.” He opened up his black frock coat to reveal my American revolver tucked into his belt.
I lay in my bed that night and turned the question over and over in my aching head. But all I could return to was the pervasiveness of the Irishman in my history – and that he was still a force who might yet prevail.
Alfie’s eyes widened. “This was about letters, too, Doctor!” He paused, unsure whether to offer further intelligence. “Love letters.”
As the trap pulled up to the house, a tall, grey-haired man emerged, his face grave. It was obvious to me that he was a military man: he had the ramrod bearing and straightforward gaze of a man used to staring down death. But his face was also ashen and his mouth twisted with distress.
Holmes nodded. “I am willing to wager that Barton knows more than he is saying. He strikes me as a loyal servant who is overly fond of his young master and wishes to protect him.”
“Do you mean that, Johnny Lad?” he breathed. “Truly?”
“No,” I said, unable to contain my emotions. “I would never imagine that you would lower yourself to do my work. I am not a self-proclaimed genius. Nor am I the scion of an esteemed lineage, as it appears you are. I am, in fact, no one at all – less than no one, as our society deems it, having no money, no family, and no position worth speaking of. I’m a doctor, for all that is worth. I know the lives I have saved are few, but it has not been for lack of trying. I am nothing compared to Mr. Sherlock Holmes, and I will always be nothing. And I have accepted that fate as my lot in life.” I drained my glass of Madeira and stood up. “You still have not answered my question.”
“Roddy?” I was beginning to sweat.
Holmes never lets anything go once he smells a mystery.
I was incredulous. “But three months in this place! I say!”
“Out?” I sat up in bed. “Where? For what purpose?”
“Oh, that tree must be cut down immediately!” cried the mother, bursting into hysterical tears.
Loosening...
“Very good, Watson,” Holmes breathed raggedly as I gently probed the injury. “You’ll make a detective yet. But you neglected to mention that my assailant was formerly a sailor in Her Majesty’s Navy who obtained the knife, a three-inch steel blade with a single edge and an ivory handle, in Hong Kong. And that he has a tattoo of a dragon on his right arm that was made in Macau, and another of a bird on his left shoulder that was made in the Japanese Islands, probably Kyushu. And that he walks with a limp from a childhood illness, most likely a form of poliomyelitis.”
Sherlock cut him off with a roll of his eyes, "Your haircut, the way you hold yourself, says military. Obvious. Your face is tanned, but no tan above the wrists - you've been abroad but not sunbathing.  The limp's really bad when you walk, but you don't use a chair when you work, there's not even one in this room besides the one that's obviously only used for clients, quite like you've forgotten about it, so it's at least partly psychosomatic. That suggests the original circumstances of the injury were probably traumatic - wounded in action, then. Wounded in action, suntan - Afghanistan or Iraq." The detective spit his deductions so fast that John had a hard time following him.
“I feared as much,” I said. “Poor Dilly! Have you communicated this to Young Charles Griffith?”
“Nonsense!” Holmes exclaimed. “I know the Classics and I know the treasures of our native tongue. You can say many things about my profligate grandfather, the Seventh Earl, but you can never say that he neglected my education. Both Mycroft and I were steeped in the Humanities, as well as the more practical pursuits of Mathematics and the Sciences. We had the finest tutors available.”
John cleared his throat before proceeding to say, "I know it's a bit early, we've only just met and all, but would you mind terribly if I kissed you?"
"I don't have a problem. You two are the ones with the real problem." She was practically spitting now.
They walked down the stairs of 221, Sherlock in front, stopping to smile affectionately at John after opening the door. He extended his hand which John gladly took. They walked silently, hand in hand, to the new Mexican restaurant that only opened a few weeks prior. It was mid-September, the weather was gorgeous, not too hot, not too cold, just gorgeous.
They began their trip to Sherlock's holme. (A/N I AM SO SORRY FOR THAT HORRIBLE PUN, BUT I REALLY FELT IT NECESSARY AND I HOPE YOU ALL STILL LOVE ME. I'M SORRY, BUT I DON'T REGRET IT. ANYWAY, CONTINUING THE STORY) They strolled along, chatting away, giggling, making up inside jokes and batting eyelashes. The walk, much like their studying session, ended far too quickly.
“Hello, I need my suit fitted. Can anyone here do that?”
The man, Gerald, continued to chat up Sherlock, “I see you’ve got a ring on your finger. Where’s the wife?” He nodded to Sherlock’s left hand.
No. No. No. No. NO.
"Yes, John. I love you more than I love life itself, because you are my life, my soul, my sun, my moon, and all my stars, and I missed you. Happy?"
“You should get some rest, John. It’s been a couple days since you’ve had any decent sleep. Go lay down in bed, I’ll make you some tea and come join you in a minute, yes?”
John let out a stifled giggle before clearing his throat and saying, "Why don't we just get our skates and I'll show you how? I don't mean to brag but I used to be pretty good back in my day. You can hold on to me the whole time if you want."
They arrived at their destination about 20 minutes later.
***********
In other words,
John giggled before pressing their lips together again quickly. He groaned as Sherlock stood back up, pulling him along with him. They got dressed, not bothering to change in different rooms, considering last night's events, it wasn't exactly necessary. They flashed each other mischievous grins that silently screamed, 'Go ahead and get dressed, I'm gonna tear that off of you when we get back here anyway.' They made their way into the kitchen where the older man fixed them both a full English breakfast.
John took a moment to catch his breath. “I thought – I thought you left. I thought maybe you were regretting last night.”
"You really think so?" He lifted his hand to John's chin, forcing him to look at him again.
“Mm. John?”
Sherlock stepped back and allowed his doctor to grab his hand and lead him into their shared bedroom.
“Yes, I will bring you to him. But, you have to be gentle. His body has been through a lot of a trauma today.” She looked at Mycroft, who was standing close to John, and nodded her head as she walked away, beckoning them both to follow.
John pulled Sherlock back to the bed and laid down on his back, putting Sherlock on top of him.
John howled with laughter at Sherlock’s sudden outburst. He decided he was done with teasing the detective. Without a word, he took his fingers out and they both moaned as John slid inside of Sherlock.
Sherlock laughed and gave his bum a wiggle, smiling at John's immediate reaction. He quickly resumed their original pace, hips up, John sliding almost all the way out, and crashing his hips back down at the same time John thrust up, John's cock finding Sherlock's prostate every time. They were soon panting, moaning and groaning and making many other noises, screaming words of praise.
"I don't think I will regret it either. Neither will you. Let's go, sweetheart."
Sherlock is failing his college art class and John offers to tutor him. Dooooooeeeeesssss a romance brew? Yes. Brew like coffee, romance; do your thing.
John sighed a sigh of relief before smiling widely and nodding his head. "Of course, Sherlock. It would be my pleasure." Sherlock blushed at his words, glancing down at his feet, then back up as John cleared his throat and continued. "We, um, we could go to Angelo's tonight? I have rugby practice today but only for a little while, so I'll be done by 4. We could meet there at 5? If you're free?"
Sherlock tripped here and there but soon got the hang of it. He was definitely no professional. In fact, he was the epitome of a graceless, inept snail.
“I love you, too, Sherlock. Get some rest.”
The dream doesn't last for long though, before another one takes over. Sherlock is watching Mary and John dancing at their wedding, watching John's eyes as they gaze lovingly at Mary. Sherlock's song ends, and the newlyweds share a kiss, and then John is looking up at him, sorrow and pain, regret and remorse clear as day as he stares at Sherlock. John lets Mary walk to a guest and she begins chatting, while John goes to Sherlock. Sherlock feels John hugging him, and then whispering, 'I could never love you, you freak,' in his ear, before the shorter man pulls away, and returns to Mary, kissing her again.
***********
"Sherlock..."
30 minutes later, the boys could be found in a makeshift blanket fort, eating chocolate biscuits, sipping tea.
“Yes, sir.” John chuckled as he removed Sherlocks pants, freeing his achingly hard cock from its contraption. “Damn,” he sighed as he looked down at /Sherlock/ and licked his lips.
John, finally settling down, grabbed Sherlock by the hands, removing them from around his waist, and brought them up to his lips. “You beautiful, gorgeous, unbelievable creature. Get your arse over here.”
“I’m naked, Sherlock.” John carefully tip toed to Sherlock’s side and sat on the table.
John nodded as he removed his shoes and his jacket. Sherlock luckily had a shirt and pyjama trousers that fit John, so he left for the bathroom to change as Sherlock dressed in his own room. The older boy came back and stepped to the side of the bed, Sherlock on the other. They silently climbed in, a bit of distance between the two.
“Yes, Mr. Holmes. Follow me, please.” The host gave them both a polite smile and led them to their table booth in the back of the restaurant. “Your waiter will be with you shortly. Enjoy your meal.”
It is shortly after midnight; 29 minutes and 18 seconds after midnight, to be specific. There are candles lit around the flat, the only light source they have. Rosie lay sleeping in her crib as the two men dance in the living room. John’s old record player is playing Frank Sinatra’s classic hits.
sorry. I just-" but John is cut off by a wave of Sherlock's hand.
“That is very generous of you, Mr. Bailer. What do you say, John? We haven’t had a ‘night out on the town’ in a while, as you so foolishly stated it.”
"I love you. If we weren't already married, I would slide right off this bed and propose to you again."
“Let’s get ready, then. I’ll pack yours and Rosie’s things, you find a hotel?”
(WARNING-)*****
Sherlock easily hails a cab and gives the cabbie their address. Neither said a word as they sat in a comfortable silence. Sherlock watched through his window as the city flew past them. John placed his hand in Sherlock’s, intertwining their fingers. The doctor brought their hands up, softly kissing the skin on the back of Sherlock’s hand before he gently laid his head on the detective’s shoulder and dozed off. They stayed in this position until they arrived at Baker Street.
"I don't know, I just love this one. I think, for me anyway, that it represents the struggle of being stuck in your own mind. Being unable to escape your own thoughts, being angry at everyone and everything even though you know the only one you're really mad at is yourself. When there's a never-ending feeling of dread because you just want to be happy and content but you're focused so much on trying to get there that you completely overwhelm and overwork your mind. Then, you're just stuck. I've been there a few times in my life so far and it's a horrible feeling I wouldn't wish on anyone. Not even my worst enemy." John's eyes were emotional as he spoke, even more so when he looked at Sherlock and saw that his eyes reflected exactly what his own had. It wasn't necessary for Sherlock to tell John that he knew, and currently lived in, that mental state.
“Fine, thanks.” Sherlock responded, not having much interest in the man next to him.
Rosie looked up to her dad in her room, slowly walking towards her. Sherlock bent down to pick her up while John stayed in the hallway, watching the scene.
Sherlock smiled into the kiss before leaning back, his eyes still closed. He let out a soft hum before opening his eyes, "Excellent morning, I think."
John smacked the alarm to shut it up. He grunted and rolled onto his side to look at Sherlock.
"Red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple, white, black, silver, and a rainbow. We can order a couple of the 'happy birthday' ones, too, of course. But, those are the colors they have. Which ones do you think papa wants?"
“I just returned from a tour in Afghanistan.”
“It’s best not to ask too many questions,” I warned, thinking it was useless to believe that anything could be kept from a sharp servant. “We wouldn’t want to hinder Mr. Holmes’ investigation.”
“I’ll bring you some chamomile tea before bedtime this evening,” she offered. “It will help you rest.”
“Hush, Watson,” said Holmes. “The tableau is just beginning.”
But...
“John Watson,” said Ross, regarding me closely. “You publish in ‘The Strand,’ do you not?”
“No, Dilly,” I said gently. “I’m a doctor. How do you feel?”
“There! Those look a treat!” said James as he surveyed the polished boots. “You’ll look right proud in these, Doctor. What suit are you wearing this evening? I’ll press it up for you neat as a pin.”
She smiled. “We are not used to visitors, but you and the young master are always welcome!”
I felt myself sliding into darkness once again. I could no longer open my eyes or feel my feet, my hands. It was as if my life was dwindling away, heartbeat by heartbeat. I could feel my grip on it loosening...
“Maybe,” he said uncertainly. “I did want to buy my mum a present.”
I stepped out of the shadows and found myself once more on St. Martin’s Lane before the Salisbury public house.
“Perhaps it seems so,” she conceded. “But they were full of pranks as well. Mr. Sherlock was as mischievous a lad as any in the county. I always thought he had a touch of the devil in him. The old Earl used to say it was because his mother was an American – that she must be descended from a tribe of wild Indians to have whelped such an unruly pup!”
