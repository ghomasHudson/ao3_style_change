“Anything new?” Cas looked up at Dean as if the sun had come out after a storm. For a moment Dean just stared back, stunned more than usual by the angel’s fathomless blue eyes. He realized Cas was talking, but he hadn’t actually heard a word he said.
Castiel looked at the text from Sam with some concern. If it had been urgent, he was sure Sam would’ve expressed it… but still, Lucifer’s trail had gone cold, and a break from Crowley’s need to always fill the silence with words would be welcome. Still looking at the text Castiel stood up from the barstool.
“Yeah, man. I know we haven’t been together long, but you’re already my best friend. I can’t see a time when I don’t want you in my life.” Cas’ face lit up with a joyful smile.
While he was waiting for Cas to finish up, Dean found himself pacing. While he knew that his rapidly deepening concern for Cas’ wellbeing was probably driven by whatever this thing was between them, he found that it was hard to worry about it. He should be concerned. This was weird, likely magical, and felt almost like a compulsion at times. Dean knew he’d have to tell Bobby about it tomorrow and make sure that Cas and him hadn’t stepped into some sort of magical booby trap, but it was difficult to think that this bond was in any way malicious. Sighing in frustration, Dean decided that the focus needed to be on resting up and getting to Bobby’s as fast as possible in the morning.
“Still, this can’t be just a coincidence. The Demon Coven killed my mom, when I was four. Sam was just a baby. This pull I feel towards you, our moms both being attacked by the same monsters, there’s something more going on here.” Cas noticed the feather sigil beneath their hands warming under their combined touch. Cas leaned into Dean, as if the man’s gravitational force had increased, sucking Cas in. Their eyes locked, mirror images of old loss and new desire, and Cas suddenly felt that nothing mattered more than getting closer to the compelling man beside him.
“Can you stop somewhere and pick up a few supplies? I’ll text you the address of the closest store. You still have the credit card we gave you right?” Castiel could here Sam’s smile through the phone.
“Hey, hands off! Where’s yours and Sam’s? We can trade.” Dean was tall enough that he easily held the candy out of Charlie’s reach.
“Group hug!”, Charlie called out. Cas was startled to find himself wrapped in Dean’s arms from behind with Charlie and Sam on either side of him. The camera’s timer went off just as Cas’ smile encompassed his entire face. For the first time since rebelling against Heaven, Castiel felt like he was really part of a family.
“If it helps, I can tell you that this isn’t normal witchcraft. There’s definitely a magical aspect at work, but I think it’s more than that, especially since we felt it even before you got those cuffs off of me earlier.” Cas tilted his head and tried to focus in on Dean. “I told you that it feels like you’re thrumming, and I felt that when I was still in the car. Before I even saw you, I knew to run towards you today. I think – I think this would have happened the first time we met regardless of the circumstances.”
With only 4 days left until Christmas, Dean had decided that going Christmas shopping was another holiday tradition that Cas had yet to experience. Sam had his doubts about this one, he was fairly certain that Dean hadn’t actually been near a mall or shopping plaza this close to the holidays, and possibly didn’t know what he was getting into. In an attempt to avoid disaster, Sam found himself calling Charlie for back-up. If anyone would help him with Operation Angel-Impala (which was the name Charlie quickly gave Sam’s not-really-a-plan), it was the Winchester’s adopted sister.
Sam fought back the nausea he felt at the idea of having to tell Gabriel that he’d gotten the nephew the man had raised as his son trapped by a murderous witch. He made his fingers dial Cas’ house number and was almost relieved when no one picked up the phone. Sam remembered as he left a message for Gabe to call back when he could that Cas’ uncle was out of town. Cas had mentioned it a few days ago. As guilty as Sam felt at not being able to contact Gabriel, he was also hopeful that Cas would be back safe and sound by the time Sam got a call back.
“Nothing really. It’s just really great to see you so happy.” Dean had the feeling that Charlie was holding back on what she actually wanted to say. He thought rapidly and decided hell with it, he did need to talk to somebody and it was absolutely not going to be Sam. Sam was always way too happy if Dean even mentioned feelings.
Dean drops Castiel’s gaze to cradle the pendant in his hand, a bit of a dazed look on his face. Cas waits patiently, wanting to make sure this is Dean’s choice.
Fuck, it wouldn’t be difficult to trace Cas back to Rowena. From what Sam had told Dean over the years Rowena managed to keep Cas away from the notice of the hunter community but if the Demon Coven had identified the guy the witch community would know who Rowena’s apprentices were. It was time to get Cas out of here, and fast.
The drive to Bobby’s was one of the most comfortable road trips Dean could remember being a part of. Cas was snarky, quick-witted, and easily saw through Dean’s bullshit. He was also adorable as he sang off key to Dean’s cassette tapes, hilarious when he went on a tirade about his uncle’s antics at the bakery, and fierce when he insisted that Dean pull over so he could heal an injured fox that had been left for dead by whatever car had hit the poor creature.
“Alright Gabriel. Bring the wee one back downstairs to the casting room. Once the spell cast, it will draw him to a compatible soul once he’s within a mile or so of the person. His soul compliment should also feel the effect, and that’s the best chance I can give him.” Gabe scooped up Castiel, continuing to keep a wing in reach so the baby would remain occupied. Once they made their way into Rowena’s casting room, Gabe waited for the witch to finish the set up.
“Okay Cas. Now I need you to go convince Dean to help decorate.” Cas looked at Sam suspiciously. “Please Cas? He’s more likely to listen to you. You can also get the old ornaments.” The angel rolled his eyes and went towards the storage area.
“Oh yes, I know better than to get in the way of Azazel. He has a reputation for following through with payment when he’s pleased and I just know he’ll be pleased with you.” Castiel grimaced as once again the witch seemed to claw at something on his back. “I do admit that I’m curious about you, but Azazel pays extremely well for curiosities.”
“Cas… they’re so soft, and warm.” Dean begins to dig his fingers in with more confidence and chases the rainbow of lights reflecting off the obsidian black of Castiel’s wings. At Dean’s continued attention, Cas finds himself relaxing as he lets his head fall on top of Dean’s shoulder. Dean laughs happily.
Cas immediately tried to bolt, but the black-eyed man clotheslined the fleeing healer with unnatural speed and strength, just in front of the stairs. Choking, Cas was helpless to resist as the man with normal eyes yanked a hood over his head and started to pull him forward by the magic binding cuffs.
“I gotta hand it to you, Cas. And Charlie too. I might be able to relax now,” Dean said, taking a deep cleansing breath. “Thank you.”
“No shit, Meg is in some of my criminal justice classes. She’s more than a little intimidating,” Jo admitted. “I bet she’s wild in bed though.”
Throughout the whole story, Dean was barely paying attention to Benny and Charlie, instead keeping an eye on Meg out of the corner of his eye. So far there had been no lingering touches, no soul gazing, no coy whispers, but Dean couldn’t help but to be on edge. He picked sullenly at his Philly, trying not to let his irritation show. Charlie had been pretty convincing that Cas wasn’t interested in Meg but if that were true, then why was she here? It was one thing for him to meet up with her to gain a little perspective before going into his first night game but another thing entirely for her to be eating lunch with them now. Did he invite her or did she invite herself? He wasn’t sure which was worse.
Dean cleared his throat and willed himself, just this once to not blush. The last thing he wanted was for Meg to pick up on that can of worms.
Before John Winchester had gone and wrapped his truck around a pole after yet another long night at the bar, he had impressed upon Dean a number of lessons. Take care of your little brother. Men don’t cry or talk about feelings. Your messes are yours to clean up. Even after the man had been gone for over a decade, the lessons he imparted had lingered, having grown deep roots. Sure, he’d managed to overcome some of his backwards thinking thanks to Sammy and their mom but he’d only applied to colleges because Mary had resorted to insisting it would be a good example to set for Sam. The usual arguments of his grades being fantastic and a degree being good for his career had failed. Joining the LGBTQ+ club on campus later that year had been his first intentional middle finger to his late father.
“Oh, nuh uh, you had yours already,” Dean scolded, quickly snatching up the burger and taking a huge bite.
“Hello, Dean” Cas greeted, casual as though it were any other day. Dean eyed him warily as Cas looked back down at his phone, seemingly distracted by whatever was on the screen.
“Right? That was the last mental image I needed in my head,” he exclaimed with a shudder. Charlie laughed and turned on the futon, pulling her legs up under her to face Dean directly.
“Jesse is definitely the runner between the two of us.” Cesar said, chuckling quietly. Dean noticed the way Jesse looked back over at Cesar and gave him a soft smile. It was like they were the only two here for that short second and then it was back to business. The quiet, nearly invisible exchange still managed to send a pang of… something… through his heart. It wasn’t jealousy. Longing?
“Duh, everyone else can see your heart eyes from space. Well, maybe except for your friend Jo, but we got her up to speed eventually. Actually, hearing Benny tell the story of how you basically ripped her head off for insinuating Clarence and I were going on a date, I couldn’t have planned that better myself. And I wasn’t even in the know at that point,” she laughed.
Dean opened his mouth to deny again but Charlie was giving him those kicked puppy eyes and there was no way he could lie straight to her face like that. Instead he opted to intensely scrutinize his fingernails in silence. Charlie sighed and moved to sit down on the lumpy blue futon shoved into the corner of the small dorm room.
Dean spun around and threw a sock, hitting Meg square in the chest. She looked down at where the sock had landed on the sidewalk and raised one eyebrow at it, like it had personally offended her. Maybe it did, what did he know.
That stuns you and you are entranced by the smile that fills the Saracen’s face when he bids you a goodnight.  It is a smile that you will cherish in your memories forever.
Buy this, you have never felt so alive, your blood is burning and it is building like waves in a storm crashing against the rocks.  He pulls your legs and wraps them around your waist as he pounds into you.  It builds and builds and he kisses you like his lips were made purely for kissing you.
With one sentence you feel the air leave your lungs and your heart seize like it has been frozen, you are being relieved of your duties as royal architect.   You feel blood rushing in your ears and you barely hear Pharaoh explaining why.  He feels too troubled knowing that if you died, Meg and Claire would suffer the anguish of losing a beloved husband and father.   Since the tunnels to his chamber have not yet started to be built he can now release you for they will employ another older architect who will redesign the tunnels.
“Sorry I am late, I had to get your presents,” Castiel replied, spreading his hands to the presents that were on the coffee table, “I didn’t mean to be so late, but it’s nearly Christmas.”
It is only afterwards, tucked up high in the attics of the palace that he shows you how mad you dancing with another drives him.    Forceful kisses upon your mouth that drive you insane while he enters you fast covering your mouth with his own so your gasps and moans cannot be heard.
“It’s a delight to meet you,” Zachariah said silkily, “If it were not for your father, I would be standing here dead,” he turned his attention to a tall young lad beside him, “Sam get the bags don’t just stand there!”
Because then he remembers why he was running away, because he might want to lose himself but Dean belongs to someone else, not him, he has never belonged to Castiel.  Dean has always chosen someone or something else.  And Dean is married, Castiel manages to push Dean off, “No…you are married, this can never happen, this can never happen ever…”
He grabs you and plunges his lips upon yours, forcing his hands through your long hair and you feel yourself gasp into the kiss throwing your arms around his broad tanned shoulders.  It is quick then the desire you feel.  It is new but in your heart you know it is real as you tear each other’s clothes off each other.
It is on this day when the Cornish coast fades into memory that you notice the figure beside that is also watching the coastline.  It is one of the passengers that got on at Plymouth, the last port with his younger brother.  You wish you had someone travelling with you but you are alone, you are going to meet with your father’s old friend who has offered you work and also his daughter who you have promised to take as a wife when you arrive.
“Because it is not even, it never has been even.  It’s not just a passing fancy, it’s not just lust for me, and it never has been!  You have haunted me for twenty god damn years!  But it’s not even because I cannot do it, I won’t be the half that feels more because when you leave, that’s the half that will get hurt.”  Castiel manages to get out before getting into his car, leaving behind a very shocked looking Dean Winchester.
Castiel has tried not to think about Dean Winchester over the last few days, he has ignored the phone calls and text messages, he won’t torture himself with what the messages say and deletes them because hell is going back to the thirteen year old boy who would read into everything that Dean said or did.
Dean sighs and sits up, swinging his legs over the and hears the groan from Cas with a wince as he pulls his boxers and jeans on, he cares about Cas and feels sick about he is doing, perhaps he should end it but he knows he can't. He cares about Cas, more than anyone could ever know but he keeps that deep, letting it come to the surface would lead him down a route which would only end in pain.
The best way to describe it was it was like floating on your back in a very large lake, he looked to Sam who stared at him, his eyes wide and he saw the body of Jimmy on the floor. Sam was talking to him but he wasn't answering even though his lips were moving. But they were not his words; they were not even his thoughts.
It wasn’t always so easy; the court is a difficult place to live.  It is political, you can have enemies everywhere and still have to face them and give them a gracious smile and pretend they are your friend.  You are on the winning side though, you are with the Queen.  In her circle, following her and praising her beauty and you follow her because you love her and her brother.
Castiel is twenty eight years old.  He has progressed in his job and managed to save up enough that he is now the proud owner of a two bedroom flat.  He loves his flat and his independence; he lies in bed at weekends if he wants to.  He goes shopping when he wants to, he drinks beer and dances in his boxers if he wants to because it is his flat.  His workmates ask if he is lonely and being honest he isn’t, except when he goes to bed and finds he has nobody to snuggle up with.
“Yeah well I was ready, I was ready for you to come back, for you to be there, I told you I needed you, did that make no difference?”
He watches you with a pained expression as you speak and you move towards him and press you lips upon his.  You breathe upon them and tell him you are afraid, that he has destroyed you.
Pharaoh demands your love and also that you design him a glorious monument in his name.  This monument that will be celebrated in the event of his death and long after it.  You spend time with him and despite your fear; one wrong word uttered could mean death to you and your family.  You discover Pharaoh is a good man, a righteous man.  He is a just ruler but seems to think that he will die young and so orders his great monument when he inherits his throne in his young age.
All the circle of the Queen will be taken; you look back and think you were all too reckless.  You realise that you thought yourselves invincible, because you were close to the Queen.  The woman Henry VIII had chased for years, this clever woman who had toppled cardinals and Spanish Queens. Being her ally and friend was an honour and very rewarding.
Castiel felt like an idiot, blushing he looked around at the other dances but felt a tap on his shoulder and “Watch.  Watch my eyes,” Dean ordered and Castiel stared into those green beauties he was scared he might get lose in them, but continued to roll his hips as per Dean’s instruction, getting more confident with the beat of the music. “Good,” Dean said softly and Castiel blushed, offering a little smile.
It is when you see him.  You have not seen him for five years but he has not changed at all.   That defiant glare and jut of his jaw you would recognise anywhere.  He was your best friend through school being neighbours in your little village.  He had gone to travel while you had stayed; you had shared nearly everything together at one time.  You could never imagine him being here and wonder if he is part of the German Resistance.
Dean does not faint, only sometimes wavering but he digs into the ground defiantly.  At the end of the day they are allowed water before being locked back in their cabins.  The commander of the camp orders that the new prisoners are to do this for the next week.  It is hot five days out of the seven and five of the prisoners collapse and later die.  Dean trudges on with a blank face, never showing any emotion to the guards and barely looking at you.
Within seconds Castiel has flown from the bunker and is in a small church on a little island off the English Northumberland Coast, Holy Island.  Lindisfarne, the island famous because the Vikings pillaged this part of England first, but it is still holy, the monks and faithful that flocked here over centuries can be felt in the earth.  He once watched Bede write the gospels here.  He watched the monastery be torn down by Reformation all scars are felt in the air of the tiny church that is over a thousand years old.
So you watch her sleep with tears rolling down your cheeks which you do not wipe away.  In the morning you will send her away, she will scream and yell at you.  She will scream why and ask you what she has done to upset you.  She begs to be kept by your side, screaming that she needs you.
“Why?” Cas shakes his head, wrapping his arms around him and wishing he had put a coat on to bring the rubbish out, but who knew he would bump into Dean Winchester.
You love him and now you remember, you realise you have always been destined to be with him, because you remember, you remember it all.
Sam coughed awkwardly, "You know I am going to ahead and warm up the car, you know get it de-iced" he backed away slowly not sure whether Dean or Castiel who were stubbornly glaring at each other, noticed the younger hunter walk away.
Yeah he had a few relationships in the past three years but nothing was like the non-relationship that he had had with Dean.  If that was what he could call it?
But they were never truly together, not in the way that Castiel really wanted, but that feeling was a secret, that was locked away, but the pain of Dean fucking him and leaving him meant that the purity of that first time was being tarnished by the lies, the secrets, the quick blow jobs in dirty bathrooms, the motels miles away from Sam so that the younger Winchester wouldn’t find out.
He hisses when the cold December air hits his skin, taking the air from his lungs and making it stick in his mouth and burn his throat and his face fixes into a determined grimace as he walks to the Impala, when he sits in the car he catches his eyes in the rear view mirror he quickly looks away, not sure whether he can even look at himself.
These thoughts were firmly in his head as he paid for the rum and some pumpkin pie at the gas station, he wasn’t really wanting to address the issue of why Cas not turning up for Christmas was bothering him so much.  But then there it was, his inner thoughts screaming at him,
Castiel fumbles with the jean's buttons but straddles Dean, gently leaning down he places kisses on his neck, moving slowly down Dean's chest and Dean has to close his eyes as he feels his body burn, under the angel's tongue. Castiel sucks at his navel and Dean moans, his hips bucking up as he knows he is hard under those blue jeans. Dean pulls at Castiel's trousers, knowing now he is just desperate to feel his Castiel's skin against his.
Dean walks back to his barracks with a black eye and a bleeding lip.   You go back with a crack in your resolve.
He spun around in the dark on the side of the road, “I know in the scheme of things it’s not the biggest event and we aren’t really the biggest believers of Christmas, but we believe in family and you…you are family man! Least you could do is say you aren’t going to come!”
It has been nearly three years that have you seen Dean when Crowley enters your life.  He is a man that you have only known in passing as he has bought your crops.  What little you have to sell he buys at the top price.  But you have never liked him, he watches you with greedy eyes.  His hands linger upon yours when he pays you.
If he had any suspicions he was being thrust upon Hester, they were fully fledged theories by the time they were on the dance floor after dinner, Castiel feeling tense as he really wasn’t the best dancer in the world, Hester with an expectant smile on her face, “Are you going to major in English?” she asked.
Castiel followed Sam through the dancers, trying not to stare or even bump into them; he raised the watermelon up to his chin and followed the back of the insanely tall Sam whenever any of the dancers challenged him by looking at Castiel in eye.  He could see their questions and their judgements in their eyes. Castiel was still getting used to seeing men and women gyrating their hips into each other.
Big Girls Don’t Cry boomed out of the radio, filling the family car with a spark of excitement as the Novak family got closer to their destination, the tension of a long journey was starting to melt away.  It was the summer of 1963, before Kennedy was assassinated, before the Beatles came and Castiel Novak could not wait to join the Peace Corps.
He confronted Alastair as he was serving breakfast, minding that he didn’t do it in front of Anna. He helped pour water and pleaded with Alastair for the money so that Jo could go and see the doctor.
You feel dreadful, he seems so helpless but it quickly turns to anger when you won’t look at him.  He demands you look at him and tell him the truth.  You sigh softly and look up to his green and eyes and you feel awful and cannot bear that you are responsible.
Dean carries Samuel the rest of the way as the little boy chatters, you rise from your chair and look to your five month belly.  There can be no way out of this but you decide to go inside and wait for him.  You make yourself busy making some tea and making some food for Dean when you hear your son’s chatter and your husband’s laugh enter the house.  You freeze when you hear his laugh in your home once again; you close your eyes and bask in the sound.
Dean smiled at the angel then looked at the nativity, where the shepherds, wise men and angels surrounded the Christ child, he let his hand search for Castiel's, gently slipping his fingers into the angels, he squeezed, and "You did Cas."
The music got louder and louder as Sam marched in front, Castiel curiously following behind, he could hear the chords of The Contours Do you love me? blasting as they reached a door, and he could hear people yelling and cheering over the music.  Sam grinned and bounced the door open with his backside and Castiel immediately felt his jaw slacken at the sight in front of him.....
Dean sipped a cold beer, letting the bubbly drink tickle his tongue and sooth his dry throat, it had been a heavy days driving and he felt some of the tension leave his shoulders. He looked to the burnt orange carpet of the motel and wondered if he would catch anything if he took his boots off.
He watches you with lazy eyes but he bites his lip and you can see his breathy pants and feel his heart race.  You keep trailing your fingers down his body and around his legs to caress his cheeks.  You are not sure for a moment that he will let you do this.  For this is the act that, that if caught, could condemn you to death.  You look to him for permission and he looks at you with such gentleness it takes your breath away.  He nods gently and helpfully spreads his legs.
Dean and Castiel found themselves walking back drunk after chucking out time, the night was cold and the air had made them giggly and honest as they walked back, “Been a great night,” Castiel commented laughing.
Hello, Sorry for the delay in the latest chapter, have had a few health problems the last few weeks but hoping to get a bit more regular now.  Special thanks to Moosetacular on Tumblr for beta reading and battling my obsession with commas.
You collapse to your knees in prayer, offering prayers of thanks for this news.  You pray for all of those who have died, for Lincoln for everyone.  But most of all you pray for Dean, you pray that he is safe, that he is on his way home.  Then you look to your belly and sadly note that it will all unravel soon so you pray that whatever comes to pass that Dean is happy and healthy.
“There has been a crash, near home,” Anna says handing the paper to Cas and he looks, it’s on a local road where they live which is notorious for accidents, there is a picture of a very damaged car in a tree and Cas shakes his head, because he can tell it’s a young person that has been driving the car, probably drunk or probably just too fast.  Young people in cars will never learn, he rolls his eyes over the article, it doesn’t say who was driving except it was 22 year old male soldier.
He wasn’t going to say it, he couldn’t, he may have come to terms with it deep down with him, he couldn’t say it out loud, not yet.  Dean swallowed, feeling his voice raw and watching his breath evaporate, there was still nothing around him, no swoosh of angel wings, nothing, “Figures,” Dean sighed and got back into his car.
Dean remembered Jimmy saying when he had been possessed by Castiel that it felt like being chained to a comet but nothing could have prepared him for the actual feeling. He felt everything, he noticed everything, everything was brighter, lighter and yet heavy at the same time.
The next day you feel well enough to take him some a drink, he is still working on the fields that were overwrought with weeds in his absence.   It is late autumn now but he has worked himself into a sweat and has discarded his jacket to wear only his shirt.  Even heavily pregnant you find he stirs you and you watch his muscles which had built back up working hard in his back.  He looks to you and smiles at your offering of a drink and you watch with lazy eyes as his throat moves as he swallows the water.  He looks to you with surprised eyes and you look away chastising yourself because he looks at you like a whore.   You make your excuses to go back to the house, mentioning that you should let him get back to his work and turn to go before his hand grabs your wrist.
“See?” Dean and Castiel nodded, actually relief on their faces as they actually agreed on something.
Castiel doesn’t really hang out with Dean Winchester any more, they are more like acquaintances that tease other in the odd class that they have or when they see each other around in the crowds waiting to get the bus or just out and about in time.
Castiel is nineteen years old and sipping happily in his local bar with his best friend Balthazar, turned out that they always remained in touch and during college had been a constant.   It was a Friday night and since Castiel got a job at eighteen, Friday night was going out and drinking your money away night.  Nothing better than getting pissed, dancing till you felt dizzy and wandering home before falling asleep on the couch.  The next morning was never any fun but on a Friday night you never thought of the morning after.
You are struck by the act, he may have treated you with scorn but this act shows that he felt quite deeply for you in his own way.  You feel sad in a way that you never felt anything for him, only disgust and bitterness.
You are a prisoner.  By the order of the King and you are called a traitor though you know you are innocent.  The only sin you know have committed is that of love.  You are innocent of the charges against you.  You know that you entered the Tower, the great Tower of London and you will never leave here alive.
Your cabin is small, room enough for you to stand and a truckle bed, so you are standing close to each other.  Dean demands a reason to why you have been avoiding him.  Are you ill?  Has he offended you?  Has he done something to make you hate him?
“They shouldn’t be show off with each other, that’s not going to sell lessons,” Hester sneered, breaking off dancing with Castiel to glare at the couple, despite how entranced Castiel was, he could detect the hostility in Hester’s voice.
Dean smiled and placed his present in front of his brother and turned to the angel to give him his, “This is for you Cas, Merry Christmas,” he said gruffly, placing a box in Castiel’s hand.
Dean gave Castiel a strange look, glared at his brother then moved back to the dance floor, their audience clearly over, Sam shot an apologetic look to Castiel.  “I carried a watermelon!” Castiel cringed horrified, because what the hell?
Castiel was suspicious, even though Anna was the older sister, he was still protective over her, “Where are you going?” he asked even though he was still watching Dean.
The angel looked back up to the hunters eyes, so many times they had shared glances and this was similar and yet so very different at the same time.  Castiel could feel Dean’s pulse race in the hand that still held the angels wrist.  There was something new in the hunter’s eyes that Castiel could recognise because this emotion was flooding his blood and no doubt was reflected in his own blue eyes.  Castiel swallowed he desired so much to feel Dean, to move closer to Dean but still he did not move.
You don’t talk about the others or what you are going to do because there is now no way you can fuck anyone else.  Dean presses a kiss to your shoulder and tells you not to worry; he will look after you then gets up to get ready to go the arena.  You ask how and he smiles at you and says he will speak to Crowley.  He will do anything, he is a good fighter and has made Crowley a lot of money, and he deserves his own personal whore.
You feel sick when you see that the other letter is from Dean, he writes that he is well and you breathe a sigh of relief.  He thinks of you constantly and your heart aches because you miss him so much, you stroke the paper as you think that he has touched the same.  But then you retch and then are sick because you have betrayed him.  You think the guilt will overcome you as you go to bed and hug yourself to sleep.
Dancing like he had never seen before. People were barely dressed, their hips grinding together in time with the beat and breathing with the base.  Castiel might be a virgin but he knew the mechanics of sex and this dancing was just that. Sex but without the intercourse as couples clung on to each other, gyrating and moving together, their skin with a sheen of sweat and when their faces met they didn’t need to kiss but their mouths were so close together their breath mingled as close as the most intimate of kisses.
But you soon learn that holy war is not what you expected, when you cross the sea, the heat hits you and you realise that this is truly a holy war as you think you have stepped into hell.  The sweat rolls down your back and the armour and chainmail that you wear feels so heavy and hot.  You wonder about the zeal that you left Italy with whether it is still there.
"Dean!" Castiel yelled and Sam swore he could have heard thunder in a clear skied night, "Jesus was the Son of God."
Not saying anything but letting his emotions seep through into his actions Castiel gently kissed Dean and the hunter gasped and moaned, meeting every thrust, Castiel wanted to show Dean love, he wanted to show how pure it was and with every heartbeat he was begging Dean to love him in return.
Right now you wish you were in shelter and not out in the open, in this heat.  You wish for a bed, a cold bath and some cold clean water down your throat.  But instead your troop plods wearily on, in a desert of fire, your commanders looking tired and everyone looks exhausted.
"Well besides you know the angels, shepherds, wise men and maternity stable there is the glaringly obvious virginity question!" Dean explained and inwardly Sam screamed, he sometimes wished he could just wander over into his brother's head and kick his brain.
“Who’s your team, please don’t say Manchester United?” the boy said not watching Castiel, continuing the beat the wall into submission with the sheer force of kicking a ball at it.
Of course this is Dean; he is a good man who will fight for his beliefs.   You would not love him otherwise.  Your fear makes you rail angrily but Dean kisses you and promises you that he will return to you.  You make love as he kisses this promise all over your body.
Castiel would suppose he could hear Sam but his heart was beating in his chest as he felt himself flush under Dean’s stare, why was he feeling so nervous?  Normally he wouldn’t be so intimated, but he found himself, Dean looked at him as if he expected Castiel to say something, “I carried a watermelon…” Castiel offered as if that would explain it all.
Castiel held the chain and compass in his hands, completely awed by the gift and the thought behind it, he looked to the hunters green eyes that were filled with such earnest feeling.  Castiel felt his heart almost burst at the waves of emotion that flared through him, he placed the pendant over his neck, tucking the compass down under his shirt and felt the metal touch the space over his heart, “Thank you Dean,” he said hoarsely, “I like it very much.”
You are fucking Crowley, your eyes focused on the shadows cast by oil lamps on the ceiling when you hear the commotion and banging on Crowley’s door.  Crowley swears and stalks over to the door throwing it open.  A guard speaks a couple of words and you flinch when you hear Crowley’s roar.  He throws on a robe and tells you to stay where you are.  You grab a sheet to cover you as the door bangs open and the guards drag the brothers in throwing them on the ground.
The heat in your cabin has become unbearable, the sweat making your shirts cling to your bodies and you swear you can smell his musky scent.  HE is waiting for you to speak and you do, remarkably calm despite your rapid heartbeat that you by being distant you were protecting him.  Protecting him from your desire for him.
Castiel would show him love, he would show Dean how much he loved him, how much he was in love with Dean, he would suck his cock and preparing him with ever gentle fingers, pleasuring him so he gasped and writhed.  He would worship him and love him and as he entered him he realised this wasn’t fucking, this was making love.  With every thrust he was saying I worship you, I adore you, I love you.
You lick the sweat from your top lip and watch his eyes follow the movement and you now recognise that something else in his eyes.  He grits his teeth and tells you that you have no right to decide whether your desire is harmful to him.  That is his decision and his alone.
For the first time for years you are being yourself.  You are dying for what you believe in.  You believe in love.  In humanity.   You love Dean and while you wish you could have saved him, you can see heaven in his eyes.
The first thing you learn about mortality is that injuries takes longer to recover from and you feel tired.  You whole body aches and your throat burns with thirst as you open your eyes.  You are not sure where you are it is not a motel room but a comfy bed and Dean is asleep in a chair beside you.  He looks so peaceful and you feel your heart swell with affection now feeling even deeper as a human than it did an angel.
Sometimes he does not talk to you, instead hands you the water and cloth and sits beside, not saying anything.  Just be being there you realise you don’t feel so alone and lost.
Then you see the next person leave and you swear that your heart skips a beat, which for a whore is quite idiotic.  He has a black eye and a busted lip but by all the gods they are beautiful eyes and gorgeous lips.  You feel your mouth loosen as you watch him stand in front of his brother despite the fact the giant towers over him.
“He came with me,” Sam said shrugging his shoulders, trying to sound cool but he was rattled, “He came with me,”
All the feelings, the pain, the hurt, desire, lust, affection, anger and the love, the pure pulsating love...the love...
"That's almost blasphemous Dean," Castiel grumbled a smile tugging his eyes, "But I get your point."
Dean rolled his eyes. “No Mr Fix-it Somebody else can’t fill in.  Ellen has to work all day and she can’t learn the routines and Gabriel and Kali will be filling in for me and Jo. Everybody works here.” he paused and looked Castiel up and down and grinned. “You wanna do it? Take time out from Simon Says?” he said and Castiel felt his cheeks flush as Dean poked fun at him.
Castiel kneels on the tiled floor, looks up to the stained glass windows that glitter with the sky behind them, purples, reds and oranges “Father I am here.  What shall I do?”
Sam nodded and lifted the body placing on the bed, grabbing his laptop and quickly opening it starting working on it.
“Jesus Christ Sam! What were you thinking?” Jo exclaimed, “He’s gonna tell his management girlfriend and then we’ll all get fired!” Sam inwardly shrank in his chair and Castiel felt that was an achievement considering how big Sam was. “Why not skywrite it?  Jo got knocked up by Alastair the creep.”
He knew he was in shit situation, one he should get out of before he was in too deep and yet he knew he wasn't going to attempt to get out. Cas was a drug to him, he needed him, he needed to satisfy the addiction that made his skin itch and his gut burn.
Afterwards, he had to admit that he had felt sick, that although it somehow felt right, it wasn't, he felt sick for using Cas because they were meant to best friends who cared about each other. He had dragged the angel down far enough without pulling him into deep sin, that's what it had been hadn't it?
“We’re waiting for the waltz.” Castiel’s mother replied and Castiel sighed that wasn’t dancing, in his mind the dancing of the previous night made him blush, but he so wanted to do it again.  To feel that heat, the exhilaration to be that close to someone in that moment…
But his eyes, beautiful green eyes that watch you coolly as he marches over to you.  The Saracen that was holding you releases you and you sag slightly, your knees unable to take your full tired weight before you look up fearfully.  Surely this is when you die, but then this beautiful Adonis surprises you by speaking to you in French.
Castiel tried to argue but Dean wasn’t having any of it, so a rather bemused Balthazar and Castiel joined their party and actually got on as if high school wasn’t two years ago but more like twenty.  Castiel and Dean talked about everything the fact that Dean had just got back from Iraq and Castiel couldn’t help but admire the fire in Dean’s eyes when he spoke about his work, Castiel was not sure he could be that brave.
The moans that erupt from your chest are mimicked by him; he sucks on your bottom lip before growling upon it that he doesn’t care about the whole world right now just as long as you get it in to your thick skull not to make decisions about you and him, without him.  That he wants you, has wanted you for months that he steals glances and touches when he can.  That you have driven him crazy and if you don’t fuck him soon he is going to jump overboard.
That afternoon he kisses you right until the point he has to leave and you watch him leave, you never like watching him leave.  You fret but then you think back to the previous night when he worshipped your body.  You smile and close your eyes in sensuality; this is possibly the first time you have smiled in true happiness since your childhood.
They kissed like what felt an age, Cas had been kissed before but never like this, it was perfect as their tongues danced in their mouth, and it was soft and yet so passionate, he felt like he was burning up from the inside as Dean pressed up against him rubbing their crotches against each other and Cas felt himself gasp.  There was no denying now that they wanted each other but sprung apart as Deans phone rang, he answered it and Cas tried not to listen in but presumed it was Sam, “I’ll be back soon,” Dean promised ringing off, and he turned to Cas and smirked.  Cas grabbed Dean and the pair kissed again, Cas could get addicted to this, he could get addicted and he would not care if he got burned.
I wrote this based on the fall of Queen Anne Boleyn with a distinct idea that Dean was Anne's brother George Boleyn while Cas is Sir Francis Weston, a man executed in the fall of Anne who was rumoured to be in a relationship with George.
You try and listen to Meg but she always seems tired of you half listening to her conversation.  With this new found wealth, she wants another child but you cannot give her a child not now, not when Pharaoh demands you.
But you are not sure you can give each other up, his body is too addictive, the feel of his lips upon your skin, you name upon his lips.  You love him.
Castiel let a tear drop down his cheek, scooping it up with his index finger, he looked at it, how far he had fallen, emotions were no longer new to him when he could now cry.  He looked to the messy bedsheets beside him then listened to the Impala roar away.  They would keep going then, fucking in secret, in the dirtiest places, pretending they were just fucking but in their hearts they knew the pure truth.
His mouth finds your neck and you arch up into the sensation of it upon your new mortal flesh, you moan and gasp and feel desire flooding your veins.  You gasp his name as you clasp hands and he kisses you again, breathing upon your lips that he loves you.
Dean answered Castiel’s mental question quickly, as he pressed his lips upon the angels, instantly demanding access to the angels’ mouth which Castiel readily gave, he felt the hunter groan as he slipped his tongue in to Castiel’s mouth.
“You are in the phone book, Cas,” Dean Replies looking at his boots, there is no smirk this time, he looks cold and tired, his eyes look sad.
Hearing these words is your punishment for sleeping with Crowley; you get on your knees and beg for his forgiveness.  You tell him that you never meant for any of this to happen, you tell him how desperate you were.  You tell him about Crowley and how he bought you and that you shamed yourself to put food under your son’s hands.  You find yourself getting angrier and angrier as you stand heavily on your feet, your voice raising you tell him that you did what you could in the war just as he probably had.  You wish you could take everything back, but you can’t.  Dean left, your father died and the winter was harsh and if you had to do it all over again you probably would make the same mistakes if it meant your son would live.
And like a row of dominoes falling over, the stopping of the apocalypse, the civil war in heaven and the lead up to swallowing the souls of Purgatory and becoming a pseudo god, everything had led him up to this point.  He walks to the altar and stared at the cross in front of him.
Tears roll down your face and you bath his feet with your salty tears, you plead and offer your own death as appeasement for any offences you may have caused.  You feel your sobs seize in your throat as you feel hands glide across your shoulders and tuck under your chin, forcing it up.  You are met with those green eyes you love so much inches away from you.
You are not fucking.  You are making love.  With this realisation you are lost and you make love for the rest of the night.  Your voice is nearly hoarse from the moans and cries but Dean turns to you and gently kisses you.  You don’t expect him to tell you that he loves you.  You don’t need him to, he has told you in the way he kisses you, the way he moves inside you.  He has shown you that he loves you.
“Watch it ASH!” Zachariah yelled before walking away leaving the entertainment staff and the waiters mingling, Castiel knew he should not be really be watching this, he should go in search of his father but he kept watching as one of the waiters “You think you can keep that straight Dean? What you can’t lay your hands on?” one of the waiters taunted the guy in the sunglasses.  Dean so that was his name, Castiel noted and watched as Dean smirked, the sunglasses still on despite the fact it was almost dark outside as he stalked over the table the waiter was setting “You just put your pickle on everybody’s plate, college boy and leave the hard stuff to me.” He drawled before swiping his hand through all the perfectly folded napkins that the waiter had just finished folding before stalking off.
Sarah does not look at you with disgust or judgement, she only asks you when you last bled and together you work out that you are three months gone.  You start to cry again then and she holds you gently as you tell her everything that has happened, how far you have fallen.  Sarah tells you that you cannot change the situation; you did what you thought was best at the time and some actions always have consequences whether good or bad.
They managed it somehow, both being in the control seat, it confused Sam when he tried to tall to Dean and all he got was a tilt of his brothers head and though it's brother's voice it's wasn't Dean. Then in the next moment there was a crack of a bottle opener and Dean was there handing him a bottle of beer.
You do not sleep; there is no point in sleeping when you are going to your eternal rest in the morning.  You try to pray but all you thoughts are on Dean and your memories together.  You remember him as a child; you remember when his sister came back from France.  The endless chase that started between her and the King and the endless rewards that came to being part of the new circle.
You cannot comprehend it; it overwhelms you, your body shatters just to match your broken heart.  Afterwards you hold each other trembling, clinging to each other.  He whispers to you that if you ever get sick of your wife to come and find him.   You feel sick at the word wife and tell him that he will probably have wife by that time.  He looks at you with sad eyes and you know he will never marry.
Castiel is twenty six years old.  He has a new job that suits his skills and experience but it means he has to do lots of lovely long reports that take hours.  It’s 9pm and he can’t do any more work or he might actually just start crying because he is sick of this damn report and he is sick of the fact he is in his childhood bedroom doing it.  That’s because he and Meg split up and she had her own apartment, not Castiel’s so he had to move back with the parents.  He is twenty six and is living with his parents; if you looked up pathetic in the dictionary you would find a picture of him.
Thank you all for all the kudos and your comments and special thanks to my new beta read moosetacular from tumblr, massive huge thanks for helping me with my love affair with commas.
He knows that you are also gay and you panic slightly stepping back from him.  He tells you not to panic, that he would not tell anyone ever.  That he always suspected as children, that you were the reason he realised he was gay.  You shake your head and look about fearfully and tell him that the main reason for being how you are is because you fear what would happen if your commanders would find out.
He may have been the King’s brother in law but he loved you and refused to give up when you suggested you should separate because Dean was in the glare of the beady eyes of the court.  He told you he would rather jump in the Thames than give you up and kissed you to stop the argument.
But now isn’t the time for smirking, you are standing opposite each other in the middle of the street, rain threatening in the wind, the sky is angry and so are you, but now is not the time for smirking, shit has just got real, in a couple seconds your lives are going to implode….
Sam turned and his eyes widened at when he saw who it was, instantly replaced by a panicked expression, “Er how did you get here?”
The voyage will be long and you have heard many a tale of the illness and savages that await you in the colonies.  But you truly believe that you can be happy there, that you can be free there.  The ship is full of like mind people, not only from England but from France and the Lowlands.   Those who fear persecution and injustice who wish to make a new life in the New World.  Virginia.  Right now it feels so far away but it is a beacon to all on board.
The pair talk politely enough, talk about their current jobs and families, they talk about childhood memories and that summer before high school before everything changed.  They talk about football, the Olympics and everything but that massive elephant in the room.
Dean is grinning at the grumbling from Castiel’s father, as Castiel’s father hates Dean, well doesn’t hate Dean, just doesn’t like his influence of Castiel.   Homework that would have been finished gets done only when it’s desperately needed.  Castiel’s wardrobe is a like that of any other thirteen year old boy, full of tracksuits of various designer brands, adidas, nike, reebok, le coq sportif, you name it and Castiel has got it.  He listens to dance music, loves diet coke and Sunny D, and he loves football and watches porn when his family think he doesn’t.  He loves South Park and has a Kenny keying which gets kicked around everywhere.  But Castiel’s father believes that this is Dean’s influence rather than the fact that Castiel actually likes these things because Dean introduced him to them, Castiel’s mother says it’s a phase and that Chuck is just being over protective of their youngest child.
And it is the truth.  Castiel still loves his absent father, the father who had set him on this path, so long ago.  The path that has been filled with so much pain.
Then Castiel leads Dean to the causeway as the sky radiates in different colours yet again and takes pleasure in seeing the reds, yellows and oranges light up Dean’s face.  Dean turns to him then the dawn reflecting in his eyes, feeling the hunter slip his arms around him, placing his chin on Castiel’s shoulder and Castiel knows.
The first time he touches you, you almost faint, your whole body burns and you realise this is how it feels to be touch by a living God.  A God on Earth.  But the touches become an often recurrence.  Brushes of his hand upon your shoulder, your back and fingers that brush against your hand.   You never dare return these touches.  He is Pharaoh, he is sacred and you are unable to touch him even if you heart constantly tells you to do so.
Gasping, but not in pain, in need, keening noises filled each other’s mouths as trousers were pushed down to ankles and the burning sensation of lust being fulfilled as hips moved against each other.  Some would have said rutting against a car with a human was degrading to an angel of the lord, Castiel was not that innocent or pure anymore, but when he felt himself burn up with desire, when he came for the first time, screaming Dean’s name into the starlit sky, the angel had never felt anything so pure.
Cas can feel himself blushing standing as he gazes over Dean and realises that Dean is doing the same thing back to him, Cas has grown into his body, he now feels comfortable with his blue eyes and lean running frame, it has taken a while but he feels confident in his body.  He knows he can attract men and females and isn’t the same naive 19 year old boy he was.  But as always Dean smirks and Castiel feels the usual tug of his own lips that is firmly stopped by him nipping them.
A nothing who deserves nothing but some nights he kisses every part of you till you are a writhing mess and now it is not just some nights.  He finds you during the day when he is meant to be eating or resting and instead you laugh and fuck against a wall, hidden from view.
He is screaming, eyes scrunched up in indignant anger and announcing his arrival but he is all Dean, his hair is a light blonde, his jaw and nose your brush with a fingertip, he is the image of Dean and you imagine that his eyes will be green just like his fathers.  But you are surprised when he opens them and peers at you for the first time; they are a vivid dark blue.  You stare at each other and your son quietens as he and instantly you love him.  He is something of you and something of Dean and he is perfect.
Months later and here they were, meeting secretly in motel rooms, fucking then Dean would leave, carving another slice into Castiel’s heart.   Castiel had spent millennia without knowing anyone, but within months of kissing Dean he was lost utterly.
The officer orders that the men shoot and you tell Dean that you love him.  As the shots ring out the last thing you see before you fade away are his green eyes.
She is happier in the spring and you watch her sew just as her mother did, sitting in front of the cottage in the sunshine.  You are planting seeds and you wave to her when a man travelling through the village stops and tells you of the news.  The dark storm cloud that is sweeping through Europe, he tells you of a sickness that is going through the towns and cities, through countries.
He looks to the altar, “You never are going to ask my questions are you?” he whispers softly, “You are never going to give me a sign?”
People in the town stare at you now, they judge you as they suspect what Crowley was doing visiting your farm so often.  But the war has driven all to do something that will haunt them, you know of a few women who have become whores and you tell yourself you only slept with Crowley but wonder if you were truly desperate how far would you go for Samuel?
When you re-join your forces and recover your strength you march on Acre and you realise that every night you dream of green eyes and the briefest of touches of a man who offers you water and washes the hot day from your face.
Castiel let his lips drift from Dean's chest up to Dean's lip, where he places a long and deep kiss, flicking his tongue against Dean's and Dean feels himself burn up and his mind feel like it is floating, his groin starting to flicker with interest.
Castiel had to admit he did not really have much interest in women, all throughout his teenage years he never really felt connected with a woman.  He preferred to look at the boys he went to school with and while he had no problems with this, he was sure his family and society as a whole would find a problem.  It was one of the main reasons he so wanted to change the world.
"My father," Castiel cut in bitingly, hurt in his eyes, he walked to a bench, sitting down, watching the nativity sadly.
You realise then three things.  You are both trembling, he is still holding on to you and his lips are mouthing your neck.  And more importantly he has you for the full night.
Castiel is thirteen years old and is starting to get really annoyed with the fact the same spot keeps coming back on his chin.  He tries not to squeeze it but it gets so sore, he has to and when he thinks it’s all great and will never return and the next week it’s back.  Castiel furiously scrubs his face with Clearisil, for a full five minutes before even thinking of leaving the bathroom.
It is while you are on guard in one of the towers on the perimeter of the camp when you see him arrive.  You watch the new arrivals trundle in, wearing their civilian clothes that will be taken from them. Their hair shall be shaved and they will be expected to wear a uniform and an identification number tattooed into their skin.
At first you think you are dead and panic because it is so hot you fear you have gone to hell.  But then you taste blood on your lips and you hand travels to the crusted blood on your temple as you hazard opening your eyes.  The light makes the pain in your skull even worse and you let out a little moan.  You see bodies all around you, you have escaped certain death as your horse is dead but inches away from you and has narrowly missed crushing you.
"I know," the angel replies, hugging his knees to his chest on the bed, his blue eyes flick up to the hunter and he raises his chin up defiantly "Why don't you end it then?"
It is an opening to a gentle thaw, he speaks to you now even if it is just to thank you for food in front of Samuel or ask you to wash his shirts.  But he still does not look at you with kind eyes, he looks through you.   You are struggling with this pregnancy, it is making you weary and even simple tasks like hanging up washing are tiring you.   Your first pregnancy you were so happy and carried Samuel in ignorant bliss but as your time approaches you know it will be early winter when the child arrives and you start to fear for your life as many mothers and children die in winter childbirths.
It burns looking at him, burns looking in those eyes, those green eyes that burn you just by looking in to yours.  You have never known eyes like it, eyes that know exactly what you are thinking, of what you are feeling, that toying of the lip into a smirk that you know for a fact you are matching despite you biting your lip, trying not to smirk again.
Dean wasn't gay, he hadn't known what he was doing on that dark night, but it didn't stop him, didn't stop him pinning Castiel to the car bonnet, pulling their trousers down and rutting hard against each other, feeling the fire in his gut, telling him it was good, telling him it was what he wanted, what he needed, that he wanted to hear Cas scream his name into the star filled sky.
Dean didn’t stay around to listen. He walked on and Castiel felt like a bastard, but Dean had this cool dark persona about him. Of course he would think that Dean was the father, if not then who was?   He was disappointed in himself. He had jumped to conclusions and what made Castiel sick was that he had seen disappointment in Dean’s eyes.  Just when Castiel had thought that Dean did not even notice him, now he had and it wasn’t pretty.
Cas woke up in the pajamas Dean had given him with an arm thrown over his chest. Confused, Cas turned slowly and realized that they were back in the hotel and Dean was asleep beside him, curled around the angel’s torso. As small rays of sunlight peeked through the curtains Cas could see his normal clothing folded nearby on a chair. He noticed that the wounds his grace hadn’t healed yet had been cleaned and bandaged, and that the blanket was pulled up around both him and Dean. As Dean let out a contented sigh in his sleep and burrowed closer, Castiel thought that perhaps he too was worth everything to someone. Smiling the angel allowed himself to drift back to sleep, happily thinking about how Dean had told the vampire to stay away from “his” angel.
“Having someone like you checking me out definitely doesn’t make me uncomfortable. If it makes you feel better, I came out hoping to ask if you’d be interested in going to the Harvest Festival tonight. I have to work for a bit at my store’s booth but if you were free around 7, I’d love to talk with you more. Even if it’s just whatever you wanted to talk to me about before.” Dean smiled flirtatiously at Cas, and there was no way to resist that.
“His name is Castiel. Take care of him Gabriel, he deserves to live a full life.” Gabriel nodded and leaned over to kiss Anna on the forehead.
“I get that, but I guess I just couldn’t let you stand there thinking that this was in any way temporary on my end. I really want to see where this relationship can go, Cas.” Still smiling, Cas gathered up Dean in his arms and Dean melted into the embrace. “That being said, I really do want to get to know you better. I’d like to start with you teaching me about your grandmother’s peach pie.”
“I will talk to her, I swear. It’s just when we had to switch insurance plans the new one says the co-pay for that grade of medicine is $100 a dose. I’m honestly not sure I can make that work Dr. Barnes.”
“Um, okay. Will I have control over this sight, or am I going to be seeing trippy stuff all day?” Castiel snorts.
Cas and Dean were both damp from snow by the time they made it back to The Phoenix Emporium to meet up with Sam and Charlie, who weren’t even there yet. Dean reluctantly dropped Castiel’s hand as they walked in, no longer having an excuse to hold it. Dean wasn’t sure but he thought the angel looked disappointed when Dean pulled his hand away. He wasn’t sure when it had started happening, but Dean was beginning to believe that just maybe there was something more between him and his best friend. He’d spent so long pointedly ignoring his feelings for Cas because he assumed that angels didn’t feel love like humans did – and even if they could feel that, Dean wasn’t anything special. It was already an unexpected gift to just have Castiel in his life, especially considering what a screw up Dean was. His own mother didn’t seem to want to have a real relationship with him.
Dean had a brief regret that he’d never managed to meet Sam’s friend prior to this, because damn, he was an attractive man. Shaking his head at that extremely inappropriately timed thought, Dean placed the unconscious witch carefully on the ground, knowing he had to secure the coven members before doing anything else. Cas seemed to be breathing okay, and a very quick examination made Dean think he’d be alright long enough for him to deal with the coven members. He couldn’t stop himself from brushing his fingers over Cas’s cheek, but managed to pull himself away before he acted on any of his other odd urges to cuddle a guy he’d literally just met. Dean had no idea what the fuck was going on with him, but for now he’d chalk it up to adrenaline and deal with the problem at hand.
“I’m here Sam. I’m happy to bring a tree to assist with your holiday rituals. Please send me the address.” Cas ended the call. He was absurdly happy at the idea of being included in decorating a tree with the Winchesters. He was worried about Dean of course, but he wasn’t surprised to hear that Mary left. She had expressed that she felt out of place. If Sam thought having a Christmas tree would help, then Cas would get a tree. He glanced at the address on his screen and drove to the store.
Cas smiled as Dean wiped chocolate on Cas’ nose. Then he smugly retaliated by sticking a chocolate covered finger into Dean’s ear.
“I feel the same way, I just didn’t want to scare you off by coming on too strong.” Dean choked out as surprised laugh.
Dean and Charlie headed down to the breakfast area where Dean immediately downed half a cup of really fantastic coffee. After beginning to infuse himself with the blessed substance Dean noticed Charlie staring at him.
When they reach their room, Dean opts to take a shower before swapping case notes so Cas tries to take that time to compose himself. When given moments away from Dean, where there is a chance for quiet, the angel forces himself to let the feelings he has for the infuriating man wash over him. He lets himself feel the pain at having to let him go up against Amara alone. He lets himself feel the overwhelming joy at seeing him alive once again. He lets himself feel how much he’s fallen in love with the beautiful human being. He recalls talking to Anna at the beginning of what would become his fall, her telling him it only gets worse. He has no doubt now that she wasn’t just referring to his struggle with doubt. An angel that can feel things akin to a human can easily become overwhelmed. They were not built for these sensations, and so, every time Castiel lets go to indulge in the wash of his emotions he pulls on his grace and works to reign them in one at a time. By the time Dean emerges from the shower Castiel has regained some semblance of stoicism.
“Hey, Cas? Before we do that, can I try touching your back?” Cas glanced over his shoulder at the green-eyed man behind him, trying to process the question with his increasingly sleep fuzzed brain.
“Do you, um, think you’re being compelled against your will?” Dean’s small nod confirmed Cas’ guess. “Well, at least that I can help with. Rowena makes us study hostile spells and how we can identify if someone has been cursed. What is it, specifically, that feels compulsion-like?” Dean blushed brightly at Cas’ question, and took a bit of time to respond.
“He’s… he’s interested? Really?” Dean felt like maybe he was going into shock. He could hear Charlie talking about the way Cas always looked at him, and how the two of them had practically kissed the other night anyway except Sam had to go and be noisy, and how she was really happy for him – but all Dean could focus on was the idea that last night had possibly been a dream after all, a dream come true. Goddamn but that was cliché.
“Welcome back, sunshine. I’m Sam’s brother, Dean. Your head is pretty banged up but if you think you can walk a bit, I can get you to my car and away from what’s left of those asshole witches who tried to kidnap you.” Cas blinked a few more times and seemed to be trying to absorb what Dean had just said.
Cas pulled out the food as soon as they were in the room, quickly claiming a chair at the small table by the window. Dean happily joined him and dove into the meal with the obviously hungry healer. Dean had always enjoyed food but even he had to admit that Cas could give him a run for his money. Dean watched in awe as Cas’ burger was practically swallowed whole.
“Charlie, he’s thrown himself into giving Cas the whole Christmas experience. While sickeningly adorable, it’s not like Dean and I even know what that is. I’m pretty sure I was still an infant the last time we had a real tree.” Charlie let out a long-suffering sigh.
“When the witch caused pain, it felt like it wasn’t exactly on my back, just near it. Dean, I do seem human to you, right? Sam has told me that you hunt supernatural monsters, do you know a way to tell if I’m not human?” Cas knew he sounded strained; he could hear the stress in his own voice.
“Looks like a Nephilim to me. He’s leaking angelic power all over the place.” Gabriel took a closer look and realized Rowena was right. Damn, he’d have to bind the runt’s powers as soon as he was stable, he’d be a beacon as soon as someone knew what to look for.
Rowena wasn’t exactly pleased when an archangel flew into her home. His arrival made her wards flare up and burn out, but in no way deterred the nuisance of a celestial being. She had clearly been in the middle of a spell which Gabriel’s entrance seemed to have interrupted. To Rowena’s credit she didn’t seem startled by his appearance. She raised an incredibly sexy eyebrow and looked at Gabe as if she stared down multi-winged millennia old creatures on a regular basis. Gabriel grinned at the witch unrepentantly, having very fond memories of the last time their paths had crossed. He snapped his fingers to cut off the backfire from the muddled spell before he actually pissed off Rowena.
“Damn it, Sammy! Slow the fuck down! What the hell are you talking about?” Sam continued to drag Dean toward the Impala.
“I said it was unexpected, not that I minded you touching. Anyway, this will work.” Dean watches as Cas runs his finger through the feathers and finds one that comes loose. In between one blink and the next the wings are hidden once again. Cas hold a single feather in his hand, the echo of his earlier laughter still present in his smile.
“Sister, there’s still a chance that you have enough grace left to regenerate. Even if you were to sacrifice what remains, I’m not sure it will be enough to save the kid.”
Castiel had been warned about the Demon Coven more than once. Uncle Gabriel had warned him time and time again to be cautious, to keep a low profile. Cas’ mother Anna had been targeted by the cult, and while Gabriel had never been forthcoming with any details, he made it clear that she’d escaped them to protect her child. Now here he was being sold to them because some witch decided that he was unusual, more than just a run of the mill witch.
“So, tell him that.” Dean nodded and stared at his feet, thinking. Sam must have assumed the conversation was over because by the time Dean looked up, he was absorbed in his laptop.
“Really? You think you’ll still want me around by the spring?” Cas seemed more nervous than Dean thought he should be. Did Cas not see how awesome he was? Heck, Dean was the lucky one in this arrangement – a baker with a GED dating a future doctor.
“I’m glad we found something else you can kind of enjoy. We can also get coffee while we’re walking around.” Dean just kept feeling like he had to smile tonight.
Dean must have responded to Dr. Barnes in some way Castiel couldn’t hear, because after a few moments the sound of footsteps echoed down the hallway, fading as they moved towards the front desk. Cas hurried out of room 5, the trash bag hanging unnoticed from his wrist. His heartbeat sped up as he worried that he wouldn’t catch a glimpse of “Dean” before he left the office. Cas didn’t really know what he was planning on doing, just that he couldn’t stand the thought of this man resigning himself to pain all because the healthcare industry was such an awful mess that it would burden someone with choosing food over medicine. Something about the way Dean had sounded reminded him so much of his sister, Anna, right before she had left Castiel forever. That feeling drew Cas forward to meet a man he didn’t know. Cas couldn’t solve Dean’s money problems, Cas couldn’t force the government to change how healthcare was run in the country, Cas couldn’t even make Dean’s medical issues any better – but he could meet this man and maybe make him smile for a moment. Maybe, if he was brave enough, he could offer him some sort of friendship so maybe he would have one more person to help him through his struggles. Cas had been too young to understand how alone Anna must have felt but he knew more about it now. Helping people like Anna was what had drawn Cas to medicine in the first place.
Glancing behind Dean, Cas noticed his right wing had wrapped itself around Dean without the angel having been really aware of it. Ever since his wings started to heal Cas found himself wrapping them around Dean more and more. Castiel was still hesitant to share with Dean that he was in love with him, but he was starting to learn new ways to show it. He saw the way Dean relaxed when his wing curled around him. Even though he couldn’t quite feel it, he was somehow sensing their presence.
“DEAN!” Cas sounded both angry and devastated as he chased after the vampire, but Dean just yelled out instructions, all too aware what this probably looked like from Cas’ point of view.
“You better find somewhere for everyone to spend the night then. Check out the forecast.” Sam’s eyes widen in mild surprise as he sees the weather app on Charlie’s screen.
“Hey Cas, Dean will be gone for hours, do we have everything to try out this spell of yours?” Cas didn’t look up from the papers he was pouring over.
“I’m sorry Dean, I thought I could handle it myself. I’ve been training with Rowena for three years now and Cas has been with her for much longer. I thought I was being smart taking backup with me, but I was dumb, and Cas got captured saving my life. Please, he’s my best friend, we can’t just leave him there!” Dean sucked in an angry breath, knowing he’d have time to yell at his idiot brother more later. Dean had never met Rowena’s older student, but he knew from his brother that Cas was primarily a healer and had been a good friend to Sam. Dean was grateful to the man as he knew Sam hadn’t had enough control of his abilities early on to stray too far from Rowena’s protection. He knew Cas’ friendship had helped Sam keep a positive outlook after they had escaped their father and found Sam sanctuary with Rowena.
Knowing it would likely kill him, Cas reversed his mental focus inward, tearing through strange bindings he’d never felt before on the way to pulling at his own soul. He’d only known Dean for such a short time, but something intrinsic to his very essence told him that Dean was worth absolutely anything Cas could give him. Maybe, as new and unexplored as it was, love really could break down any barrier. Yanking at the light of his own inner self, Cas noticed even more power deep within him. He tore down every mental wall and poured everything he had into Dean.
Dean dragged the guy back to the oil free car and took some spray paint out of his bag to draw an additional Devil’s trap inside the trunk and then threw the demon and his dead companion inside. Dean duct taped the demon’s mouth shut to prevent him from making too much noise before locking him in. After checking on Cas again, Dean took another few minutes to push the car off the road and conceal it as best he could in some foliage. The whole endeavor took longer than Dean would have liked but he’d learned the value of covering his tracks years ago.
“Cas,” Sam started as they worked their way up to the roof, “Why did you want Dean to be able to see your wings as a Christmas present?” Cas glanced over his shoulder as he continued to walk in front of Sam.
“Yeah, I bound his powers when he was still a baby. To save his life, by the way.” Cas whimpered as Gabe combed his hand through a rough looking patch of feathers.
If it makes you feel better - pharmacy employees like "Meg" in this  story really can work co-pay card magic sometimes so always, always ask for help if you can't afford your medications. Many dedicated healthcare workers will advocate for you if they know what's going on.
“It’s called a witch elm Cas; do you really think it’s there because of the coffin wood?” Castiel rolls his eyes at his companion.
Dean bolted back through the woods to his own car. He knew from coming up here that the drive up to the cabin was one long and bumpy dirt road before reaching a better paved roadway. He’d taken a shortcut straight from the main road by hiking through the forest with his car parked in a secluded pull off area. He should be able to cut off the coven’s henchmen; he may even have enough time to find a good ambush location. If nothing else he’d get to them before they brought Cas anywhere Dean couldn’t pull off a rescue as easily.
“I get it doc, I do, but $400 a month? It’s basically choosing between eating and my ability to move without pain.”
“I’m a witch. I wouldn’t think that’d be too hard for you to recognize but perhaps all of that dark magic has choked off your basic senses.” Cas glowered defiantly at the woman, figuring there was no harm in pissing off someone who was going to kill him anyway. She just laughed in response. The sound was like nails on a chalkboard. Castiel shuddered and suddenly wished that he was still unconscious with the creeping sense of wrongness that started to saturate his senses as Bizzaro-Poppins strode closer to the cage.
Dean thought that Cas was probably in a state of shock. With Gabe’s exit, Cas’ ability to argue with Dean seemed to have left with the annoying archangel. Dean wasn’t sure what to do for Cas at the moment, but he refused to leave him, and not just because Dean was afraid that his wonky angel powers would start to drain Cas’ soul again (and even as someone who hunted supernatural monsters, that seemed like a weird thing to think about).
“Well, I can certainly get you the information on who was buried here, this was one of our more famous gravesites. The man buried here died in the early 1800s, he is one of two Revolutionary War veterans laid to rest in the cemetery, his name was William Abbot. I believe he held the rank of Captain. The Boone Historical Society may have more information about him, but he is one of the earliest burials in the cemetery and a lot of those records have been lost over the years.” Mrs. Paige chewed on her lower lip for a moment, staring along with Dean at the tree once again. “The tree will have to be removed to restore Captain Abbot’s grave.”
“Sure, yeah. I do. It just, feels strange to say it? I dunno, Charlie. I feel like I’ve barely come to terms with saying I’m bisexual, much less saying I want a boyfriend.” Charlie’s smile expanded.
“No Dean. Sam woke up at some ungodly hour and already ate. Cas said he only wanted coffee so they decided it was a good time to go retrieve your car. The worst of the storm didn’t end up hitting us and Cas said the parking lot here was safer or something. That you’d be worried with ‘Baby’ in a public lot for too long.” Dean choked up a little at the idea of Cas dragging Sam out first thing in the morning to take care of Baby. He was a bit disappointed that he hadn’t seen Cas yet this morning, but maybe this was an opportunity, Dean thought he should talk to someone before he lost his mind. Maybe.
“Um, I thought you didn’t want me touching them.” Dean couldn’t see Castiel, but he could hear him snickering. Dean pushed the wing away from his eyes in time to see Cas laughing at him.
“Um, well, I asked you to come back because… because Mom left. Dean hasn’t been handling it well, and I thought you and I could maybe do something to remind him that he still had us.” Cas took a deep breath and didn’t speak for a moment. It was hard to think of Dean dealing with his mother’s absence again. “Cas?”
“Dean. I think this will work. Dead man’s blood should still help to incapacitate it. We also need the ashes of it’s creator and the blessing of the divine.” Dean widened his eyes at that list, but he supposed it was doable. They could steal Louisa’s body from the morgue if necessary. “We use the spell to seal the ingredients into the wood of the elm. Then we have to stab the creature with the elm wood through its heart.”
“Oh. Yes, that would be… agreeable.” Cas’ voice trailed off into a whisper and Dean risked a glance at the angel’s profile. Cas was also studiously avoiding looking at Dean and seemed to be nervous. Dean started to wonder if maybe, maybe he was wrong about angels. Maybe Cas felt something more for Dean as well. They continued their prep work in silence but the tension slowly dissipated as they fell into a friendly argument about how much butter they really needed (Dean was in favor of more). By the time Sam returned they were happily watching Rudolf, at Cas’ insistence, while waiting for the not-pie to cool off on the stove.
Later that night Castiel was still unhappy with Dean and had left them at the motel to return the car he had borrowed when he had frantically scrambled to get to Dean and Sam in time. He mumbled something about the Impala not having snow tires and that they were lucky the local deputy was generous. Dean hoped Cas would cool off while he was out, Dean hated feeling like he was in the dog house which he mistakenly mentioned to his brother.
The pressure grounds Dean, and he switches the arms he’s driving with and Cas scoots to his side, Dean’s arm around him.
Sam followed her instinctively. He drew his gun to cover her. Dean and Cas were close behind. Dean took enough time to pull a blade from the trunk. He also grabbed a hypodermic needle full of dead man’s blood.
Victoria was shaken out of her reverie by the announcement by her GPS that she had ‘arrived’. She pulled into the driveway of a good-sized house, with the Impala right behind her.
Dean draws Cas’s face closer to his and they share a sweet kiss while the Ocean looks on, steady as always.
“Well, you got no personality, that’s for sure. It’s been millennia of nothing and the first being I get to talk to is you. Just my luck.”
Judas allows tears to escape, which makes two small puddles beneath him. “I beg forgiveness, Angel. You know as well as I, He would grant it.”
Castiel thinks of Zachariah, the vulnerability Dean possesses inside of his head. There is no protection here, no way the angel can blockade Dean’s mind. Not here anyway, not now.
Castiel internally winces, knowing his actions caused humanity pain, especially the perfect specimen of humanity standing in front of him.
His fist connected with Cas’s face, making the man turn his head with the blow. Blood immediately filled his mouth as he felt his cheek connect with his teeth.
With a cursory glance at the little girl who was his vessel only seconds before, he rises and walks to the brothers.
“I’m gonna try to trust you, Cas, about your grace. But man, I don’t want to think about losing you, not again, not here.”
He walks to the garage devoid of any cars and begins to rummage around in the box marked ‘Christmas’. He laughs to himself, thinking his boyfriend had a firsthand encounter with the being responsible for the holiday.
He looked up when his two visitors entered. Victoria took a pair of gloves from the box on the wall and put them on. Sam followed suit.
They walk around the store together; Patience helping Cas pick out the items on his list. He learns she is working full-time in the summer, will be a senior in high school in the fall, and hopes to be accepted into an Ivy-league school.
Dean laughs against Cas’s lips and presses them once more together. He is getting the hang of this, and honestly the stubble and short hair he grips in his hand really is frickin’ hot.
Cas smiles and turns to face him. “You offered your soul to save your brother, without hesitation. You were willing to spend eternity in hell so that Sam could live. I was an angel accused of loving humanity too much, how could I not volunteer to save the best of them?”
Dean had a cocky grin as he leaned against his baby to more comfortably talk to Sam. “So, did you bond?”
Her face rests in a type of permanent exasperation, and the Guardian is pleased for having evoked that look.
Dean nods, obvious apprehension apparent in the gesture. How the fuck was Cas the chill one in this situation? Cas who had sex with one, well, two beings? And Dean being a fucking mess after being essentially a sex god. Deep down, well it wasn’t really even all that deep anymore was it? Dean knew
Cas sighs, contemplating his words carefully. Dean watches as the professor draws his bottom lip into his mouth, biting at the tender skin slightly. Cas just looks so contemplative, and Dean feels like the most important person in the world – causing Cas to be so selective where he is concerned. Dean forces his eyes back to the road.
Dean felt Cas’s eyes on him, and Charlie and Jess’s words kept replaying in his mind. Could Cas like him even knowing about his
Sam shook his head, “I don’t know, I know it’s only been six months, but I feel like we’ve been out of the game for a while. I’m happy that Victoria is leading this honestly, I think it will help us get back into the game slowly.”
“Uriel tells me you were reluctant retrieving Anna. Said you showed some, uh, shall we say, remorse?”
He can feel Dean’s hesitation, his pain, and tendrils reach out to a handprint in a gesture of comfort as the man turns around.
Dean finds himself smiling. “Oh right, cause you’re just gonna not even try to woo me, just all, now that you realized you find me attractive Dean, you are mine for fucking ever.”
Cas taught Dean forgiveness. Sam wondered what happened between hunter and angel before Cas agreed to fight Dick. He knew whatever it was, was powerful. He imagined the electricity could be tasted in the air between them, wherever the moment was.
Dean processes. He nods slowly, realizing he is also a type of hitman. He clears his throat and stares into eyes that feel like home.
John Winchester knows his son is all but useless, but the usefulness he does provide can be useful to
Cas regards Dean, his hand once more returning to the hunter’s stomach to make way for the lowered book. “I suppose those who were on the ground, dying to protect seals that did not truly matter in the end. Perhaps they were not ‘pricks’.”
He knew his orders and what he was supposed to do and help orchestrate, and he would do just about anything to keep this warmth, to have not it cut out.
“I wouldn’t say friends, not yet anyway.” Cas stopped in front of a very simple desk with a glass top. He noticed the metal, minimal screws, and what he assumed would be very simple assembly instructions.
pouring from Cas’s words melting him. Sam could see it, and as much as Sam felt like he was intruding, he knew he was needed for this.
“Castiel, the host are working steadfastly to keep Lucifer in the cage. We are here solely to stop the Morningstar. However, as you know, our Father sealed the cage with over six hundred seals, only sixty-six of which need to be broken to release our fallen brother. We must work as a cohesive unit to ensure these seals are not broken. Your ineptitude in rescuing Dean Winchester before he broke the first seal has led us to this course, brother. Since this is your failing, I cannot understand why you are reluctant to help us. I would think that you, Castiel, would be the first to volunteer to save the humanity you profess so readily to love.”
John could count on one hand all the things Dean did for him. He gave him money from time to time and introduced him to killing monsters. But that was all the kid was good for. John scoffs as he thinks about the man driving the car he’s following.
“Yeah, so I uh, we I guess, stayed in California while Sammy was in college, and then he got a good gig here right after he graduated law school. This was our family home for a while, my mom moved out, and Sammy and I moved back in. Jess too. But, they bought their own place after they got engaged.”
He was standing directly in front of him now, facing him. “We’re brothers, Uriel. Pay me that respect, tell me the truth.”
Dean is filled with a renewed sense of confidence, and he thinks, for a blessed moment, Cas feels the same way.
Cas follows each of Dean’s instructions perfectly, allowing Dean to make the cinnamon sugar mixture the bread will be coated in.
In a room inexplicably white, the sterility causing an overwhelming feeling of nausea in the Guardian, a prim woman with a hard stare examines a file-folder in front of her. The Guardian sitting opposite is unable to feign interest in whatever she is attempting to tantalize him with. He much prefers to just be handed the folder and dole out assignments. He refills the glass in his hand with an amber liquid he pours from the ether. He swirls the contents before sipping, drawing ire from the woman at the pristine desk.
was something he would never forgive himself for. Even though it broke him, he didn’t blame her for going back to her first
The reaper surveys her surrounds with feigned disinterest. She is a true master at the gesture, making everything and everyone seem unimportant. Her beautiful brown eyes settle on the demon sitting at a table set for two outside a café in Paris. The scenery is beautiful, and she finds a very slight smirk playing on the right side of her lovely lips. She moves gracefully towards the demon and takes the seat he intended for her.
Dean chuckles as he lifts a very cheesy fry off the plate with his free hand. “Oh yeah. You already know about Sammy, what about you?”
John pushes the creature into a tree, holding him up by the front of his shirt. “You got a set on you boy, and no respect. You are going to take me to Dean, you understand?”
Dean pulls the door to the shed closed behind him, and opens the windows, allowing light and ventilation. He waits until he hears the Mark V start up, and he turns on his stereo that Sammy got him for Christmas. Zepplin’s “Ramble On” begins playing and Dean starts singing along.
Safe. What an odd word to attribute to such an unsafe task. Perhaps yes, Dean would not, could not be physically harmed. But what of the wounds that could not heal? What of the wounds that would be ripped open as if they never stopped bleeding with flashbacks of Hell? What of those? Castiel’s grace is still heavy, solid lead in unforgiving veins.
Cas parked his Lincoln in the lot fairly close to the pub and put his money in the parking meter. He placed the ticket the machine printed off on the front dash and started walking toward the restaurant.
“Babe, no, we can’t do this, we can’t think about shit like this. These two incredibly handsome sons-of-bitches have to go back to where they came from.”
Thank y'all so much for reading and for the kudos, subscriptions, bookmarks, and comments!! They mean the world to me. I love hearing for you guys! I hope you all enjoy this chapter!!
Castiel feels it then, the anger. And the angel surmises that Dean is correct, really. Watching Dean being hurt and not able to intervene did something to Castiel’s grace. It felt as if he were being torn into shreds, although he was safely and fully contained in his vessel. Dean’s soul called out to him when he was in danger or hurt, and Castiel’s grace responds in a way that denotes an invocation, albeit a sacred one. Castiel could not explain the feeling, and he would be remiss to try. Some feelings are unable to be explained, and therein lies their beauty.
“All right, we’re making stuffed French Toast, so I’m gonna need those pretty thick, so that you can make a pocket in them, good?”
Okay, so the queen of Hell had a partner. A King, of sorts. Jack pulled another soul from the Empty when he rescued Cas – a soul who offered himself for the good of mankind, and Jack knew that deserved a second chance. So, with an expensive suit and a bloody good accent, the King of Hell reigns with his mother, ensuring the real monsters reap their just rewards.
Thank you so, so much for reading!! Thank you all so much for the kudos, comments, subscriptions, and bookmarks! They warm my heart! I am so glad y'all are enjoying this story!
Dean pulled out of their parking spot on the side of the main highway to follow the midnight blue ’88 Stang. He turned the volume down on the cassette player to talk to Sam.
Castiel stands in the doorway to the kitchen, arms by his side. He regards his human self and looks deeply into his soul. The brightness does not surprise him, he seemed like a good person, from what Castiel had seen. What did surprise him was the brand that stood out on his soul, apparent at second glance.
Dean begins to go through drawers and throws a t-shirt and pair of pajama pants at Cas. “Put these on. In the bathroom.”
I do not own Supernatural or any other Show, Movie, Book, App, and/or website mentioned in this tale.
Dean licks his bottom lip, scratches the back of his head with his hand, and shakes his head with amusement. He takes one last look at the pie, salt water suddenly threatening to escape his green eyes, and goes to get cleaned up as well.
Castiel watches with one face as his sister focuses on the man in front of them. He narrows some of his eyes, attempting to place the look on his sister’s faces. If Castiel did not know the look to be impossible on his commander’s face, he would think it was a type of envy. Angel’s could not be envious, for if they were, they fell.
“Oh.” Cas looks at his plate like it is the most interesting thing in the world. He remembers vaguely Elvis went through something similar with the FBI. He pushes his luck.
“Oh no, Dean, it’s fine. I do not mind going. Besides, we have to summon a demon when you get home from work. Will Sam be joining us?”
to a creature imitating a woman named “Hannah” was a change the creature was not handling with a great deal of deftness. In fact, quite the opposite. Although Hannah’s memories, along with the way in which she moved her body, thought, and frankly lived, were in the creature’s knowledge base, acting like Hannah was proving difficult.
Although he still did not understand half of what Dean was saying, he was gladdened the hunter did not seem to take his threat of returning him to Hell too seriously; if judging by his tone was anything to go by. Castiel would swallow and take a deep breath if he were human, to steel his nerves. However, angels had no such mechanisms, so he simply acted.
“Yeah, well, I’m a very astute kinda guy.” Dean looks to him then and winks. He nods to Cas’s plate. “You gonna finish that?”
“I learned how to offer your body pleasure in a myriad of ways, from many different cultures, with many different techniques. I learned how to bring you to the point of ecstasy, fetch you from the precipice, only to plunge you into the sublime once more. I learned how to make your body my canvas, and I will make you undone to forge you together once more every opportunity you allow me.”
“You misunderstand me, Dean. I’m not like you think. I was praying that you would choose to save the town.”
Just as he was usually the one to physically encircle his partner, Dean was also the one to typically be on top, regardless of whatever situation was currently playing out. This wasn’t because of a preference on Dean’s part, it was from years of training to survive. Being underneath someone typically meant it would be more difficult to flee, to fight. And yeah, fighting someone nude had major drawbacks, but drawing a gun from underneath a pillow, or a blade from a nightstand drawer was a lot easier when positions didn’t have to be switched.
The words make the former hunter smile, truly proud of where they had gotten and what they had become.
as if were second nature, looks through the window of a small, ranch-style home in Boulder, Colorado. A couple dance around their modest living room with a small child in her father’s arms. They recently adopted her, as her mom died in a tragic accident, that Castiel knew was not accidental. He followed her daughter’s journey, ensured her safety and care. She was safe now, and she was going to be given a chance. He closes his eyes and looks towards the firmament, knowing his next stop will not be a pleasant one.
Dean looked at his best friend and decided to intervene, the need to spare Cas pain apparent to everyone but him. “You know, the ‘meteor shower’ three years ago? Well, that was all the angels falling to earth, because of a spell another angel did. He’s dead now.” Dean paused to change his tone, “Ezekiel died in the fall. I’m sorry.”
A thousand answers run through Cas’s mind. So many reasons why this man in front of him deserves salvation. But he goes with the answer he was told to give:
“This is not an act of rebellion, nor am I a rebel. You have plenty in the host to accomplish your mission, Castiel is under my command.”
The station was big, police officers were running around every which way. Sam and Victoria had to dodge several to make it to the morgue.
Dean shakes his head. “It’s too big, Cas. I mean, archangels got some juice, but this takes more mojo than they got.”
Cas pulled his bottom lip inside his mouth, biting on the skin slightly, mirth apparent in his cobalt eyes. “Is that your dog?” His eyes narrow slightly as he inclines his head toward the seraph.
And does he ever. Full open road, “Kansas” playing on the radio, blasting the anthem of their lives.
Castiel looks to the table. He sees a grain of salt and traces its origin to the Dead Sea. A molecule of savor that came from the place where the Son trod. Again, his grace pulls uncomfortably within his vessel.
Cas smiles as he gingerly pats his new dog’s head and scratches his ear. “I always did think we were one species short.”
. His Cas smells like the four elements: earth, water, fire, and air. This Cas smells like lavender, freshly dug dirt, and fresh sweat. Both are equally appealing.
Dean used the grin to try and distract from his feelings, because he really wanted the two to bond. Wanted the Chosen One or whatever the hell she was to never touch his Angel again. She could touch Sam all she wanted. Okay, there was a lot Dean knew he needed to unpack there, but he wasn’t gonna start. He just wanted things to be normal, he wanted to know that Cas was always going to be around, always come back to him. Okay, maybe he wanted more. But that more was gonna hang out deep within his soul where it belonged. Because John Winchester did not raise his soldier to like dick. Dean flinched internally, knowing everything about that was wrong. Knowing his emotions shouldn’t be kept in as they were, but after almost forty years, he didn’t know another way to cope except in a bottle and a serious amount of repression.
“What you want for breakfast, angel?” He tries to hide any emotions that may have escaped into his voice.
Cas knew Dean would ask, but he wished he wouldn’t. Uriel offers a meaningful glance to Castiel, a show of mock respect for Castiel’s position. Cas holds his look.
“So, uh, three demons are gonna break some seals today, and I need you to make sure they’re able to, kay?”
With a nod, the Void disappears. The creature allows a breath to escape she was not aware her form was holding. She sighs, a human emotion she picked up from Hannah’s memory, knowing she does not truly want to meet Castiel, but that she must.
Sam almost forgot about this Castiel, the awkward Cas who helped them and gave everything for Dean, but who could also be a judgmental prick.
Claire rolled her eyes with a smile. Since the two grown-ass men were having trouble, she thought she’d intervene.
Castiel furrows his brow, Past Dean scowls, Sam smirks, Cas sighs, and Jack licks his sticky fingers.
, quickly decided that was not the best course of action for the particular moment and put one of his arms to rest on top of Cas’s.
“He’s a boy, Dean, a boy who lost his temper and had no intention to hurt me. He has been here a lot, he goes between us, Cas, and Kelly.”
The pit deepened, the missing pieces screamed from the ether and an angel born from a star felt like screaming with them.
“Uh, I think I’d like to eat somewhere my future self isn’t having super loud sex with our best friend.”
“No, no. If you’re tired, that’s fine honey, go take a vacation, and come back home when you’re ready and rested.”
Claire smirked as she glanced at her uncle quickly before pulling into a parking space at Home Depot. “Do you really want Dean to think you don’t have your own set of tools, I mean, he's already assuming you can
“Well, if you two don’t need me anymore, I’ll be going.” Claire grabbed her bag off the bed before heading out the door. “Bye, Cas, bye, Dean.”
eyes then, and the burning became slightly unpleasant, as if it were running throughout his form not only with the most pleasant type of heat but also random pulsations of ice. It stung, and Castiel hung his head with what could only be described as shame.
The first true test came when Joe came back with dinner. The creature inclined its newly formed human head and regarded its form’s husband. The memories it took from Hannah brought a sense of longing at his form, but it was more the knowledge of a feeling than the feeling itself. The creature was able to pass everything off due to the complaint of a nonexistent headache.
“I thought angels were supposed to be guardians. Fluffy wings, halos -- you know, Michael Landon. Not dicks.”
Victoria suddenly woke up and wiped away the tears that had fallen while she was sleeping. She got up to find the kitchen. Baking always seemed to help her work through things.
Cas looks at his hands, he nods slowly. He wonders why the younger version of Dean deemed this particular kill important. Cas asks a question to line up the dates.
“You have tested me and thrown me every which way.” Dean walks closer to him, Castiel feels the heat build and looks away. “And I have never asked for anything.”
“First, Zach sent me to this fucked up version of the future, then we get sent to another future that’s fucked up in a whole different way.”
Dean got all three of their mugs and put them in the sink. Cas and Sam stood up, thinking the angel would follow.
“Great. Just great. So, what, Sam’s what, a lost cause? I don’t care what you guys think, Sammy is not, he’s…”
“Well, you're a regular Chatty Cathy. Tell me something. Sam would have wanted in on this, why not bring him back?”
Castiel once more was lost in the man’s conversation. He addressed only the parts he could ascertain.
Dean uses his glass to gesticulate. “Can’t you just do all this without him? And let us go back home to watch some movies and spend time with Sam before we all die?”
“Chin up, Angel. Remember, second date is all you tonight, and I am expecting to be so fucking wooed I won’t be able to think straight.”
Castiel wants this to end, all of it to just end. He knows what the demons will do if they get ahold of Anna, and he cannot risk that.
The Croatian Universe proved the second most interesting, and Chuck spent quite a bit of time there. He watched as Cas and Dean constantly got together and pushed the other away again and again, like the ocean and the tide. He watched their love blossom, die, and bloom again from a crack in the sidewalk. Cas knew he was a decoy, but he was okay with it because Dean needed him to be, and Dean was going to be the hero. And even though they both moved their way through the camp, they only really every truly loved each other. And while Dean had become hard and callous, Cas became a shell of what he was. But at the end of every day, it was them, and everyone knew it. Chuck thought that story would sell millions of copies if he ever took the time to write it.
If this man, the man who was meant to save them all could be this downtrodden, this defeated, in this much pain, then there was no hope for anyone else. This world would be better burned to ash.
He smiled when he saw Balthazar sitting at one of the patio tables. Cas rolled his eyes when he saw a small mixed-breed dog in Balthazar’s lap. Cas opened the gate and sat across from the angel.
Then, reality comes crashing down as Dean realizes having to take a piss will totally ruin the mood.
Dean almost falters, almost asks ‘why?’, but instead, he simply obeys. Cas snuggles up against him and intertwines their legs. He places his arm around him and whispers into his ear: “Good night, Dean.”
Cas let the admission wash over him, his grace swirling with fondness for the green-eyed hunter. But he didn’t comment, he wasn’t going to let Dean off that easily. Even though the man’s prayer in purgatory meant a lot, he was still hurt. Even though love radiated off him in waves, he still felt Dean’s absence when they were at odds. He knew what Rowena saw that day they were in hell, he knew the witch knew from the moment they were trying to get the Mark off Dean’s arm. And yeah, Rowena put them through some shit. But she was still a classy lady. Castiel knew Rowena flirted with him to throw Dean off. And the Seraph appreciated it, even though she made him a rabid angel. That day in hell, when she told them to fix it, she thought maybe now would be their only chance to finally get their sticks out of their asses. Castiel knew why Sam was so fond of her.
“Ah, he’s yours then? Hum?” Crowley’s eyes rake over Castiel’s form, and the professor looks to the demon and holds his gaze, every other emotion absent but determination. “Shame.”
Dean thought that was all manner of hot and wanted to be a witness; this allowed him to stowaway the disappointment in Cas not teaching in Atlanta. He cleared his throat very slightly.
, the things that made relationships difficult, and dangerous. He was able to live with and love Hannah better than he ever hoped. But the guilt he felt for exposing her to the
Dean looked pained, drained, and pissed the hell off. He glared once more at Sam. “Completely and utterly? Been reading ‘Twilight’ again princess?”
“He was part of a nest. Since Oklahoma City is less than forty-five minutes outside of here, I’m fairly certain that is what the case is about. We will check in with the police first, just to be sure.”
Castiel sighs and looks towards the young lady he had a hand in raising. “I am fine, Claire. Dean and I reconciled.”
. He pulls away from the neck he used to only be able to dream about, admires his handiwork of slight bruising, licks his lips and backs away.
He would be at peace this way, the other way they would all be hunted. They couldn’t go against the grand plan.
There were multitudes of stars in the firmament, each unique and bright in its own way. The stars had qualities that made them desirable to the archangels, each of four dividing them up amongst them. One star burned brightly with colors of dark blue, platinum, and ebony. This star was Gabriel’s favorite and he approached his father with the celestial body.
Sir had given her explicit instructions and the creature posing as Hannah intended to follow them to the letter. However, displeasure was written across her borrowed face as she scanned the outside of the apartment complex she was meant to inhabit. The building was dilapidated, needing repair in every way imaginable. The brick was crumbling, cracks were running through the mortar, ivy was growing into those cracks, making a type of concrete jungle.
Chuck nods. “Oh yeah, sure. Uh, when they took you back to Heaven’s secret lab after the whole ‘bonding with Dean’ thing, they found that and removed it.”
And there it is, the admission. The everything Castiel knew but hoped wasn’t there. The orders weren’t true, they weren’t good, they weren’t righteous. His righteous man almost died.
Cas’s eyes look toward the ceiling, tears escaping them. Dean pulls his chair towards his and puts his arm around his husband.
Claire inwardly smiled at just how well this was going. There was hardly anything her uncle loved more than nature, and the beauty nature could produce.
“Oh yeah.” Chuck begins in a manner so nonchalant Dean wants to punch him, again. “This is the house the two of your alters shared in another Universe. I visited them sometimes, I mean as Chuck.  They were interesting.” Chuck shrugs. “I thought you guys might more be more comfortable here.” He smiles like he is doing them a favor. Dean is only able to keep his cool because Cas’s hand is in his.
“Are you in need of assistance? I only help those with money.” He makes a pointed look back to the man with the wrapped leg before looking to the man in front of him. “And you look as if you do not have any.”
“I threw Dean and the other one into this world where they would realize that even if they were ‘normal’ they would still go back to their old life, fighting monsters, because that’s who they are. Even without the ‘tragic pasts’.”
“Oh, I most certainly did. And Balthazar rolled his eyes, waved his hand, and the mess was gone. Plus my coffee was once more at the perfect temperature.”
Sir takes another thoughtful draw of his pipe. “You will find out, Mr. Winchester. Although you are one of the worst specimens humanity has to offer, which is saying quite a bit, I suspect even you will feel
Dean lifts a finger from around his glass. “Maybe Cas would be a better storyteller if you shut up.”
“I am unsure if you are comparing my chest to toilet paper or not. Considering you have called me an anus twice in the last minute, I can only assume that is the point of your comment.”
Cas nodded in agreement and went to join Dean in the main room. Victoria watched as the invisible string that tethered the Angel to the Hunter shortened with the close contact. The string reminded her of something she couldn’t place, which was particularly annoying. She decided to go through her brain’s attic later to determine what it was.
Dean chuckles as he opens the fridge to find Pumpkin Spice Creamer. He makes a cup for both he and his angel and heads to Cas’s favorite spot on the beach.
“Attempt to make contact once more, and then get your vessel. Dean Winchester is your only objective. Your vessel matters not expect for the purpose for which he was born.”
The woman looks cautiously around her, as she feels as though she is being watched. Her too acute senses overtaking the calm in her gut. Her husband looks at her with a raised eyebrow. She smiles and shakes her head and returns to singing.
“We’ve done it lots of times before, Cas, it’ll be okay.” Sam smiles slightly at Castiel, and the professor takes comfort in the gesture.
“That is exactly what you are doing.” The idiom didn’t sound quite right, but he thought it best not to mention that.
Cas shuts his eyes in realization, winces slightly before opening them once more. “I haven’t helped that have I?”
Castiel lets go of Dean’s hand and slides to his side, snuggling in. Dean turns to Cas and lightly kisses the side of his head before putting his arm around his shoulder. Dean sent up a silent thanks for the Impala having bench seats.
“Oh no, I just picked the one that happened to have your name.” The blonde angel speaks as if that were the most normal thing in the world.
Jo shakes her head and puts her hands on her hips. “I see you finally got him Dean, not gonna lie, I was trying myself.”
He also made a salad, because Sam. And from Cas’s normal breakfast choices he figured the blue-eyed man was also somewhat health conscious. He figured Claire was just like him, the more bacon the better.
The demon looks to the boy, eyes black. The boy shuffles closer to the invisible angel, and then – he disappears.
He sits in the chair, puffs of smoke rising from the pipe and swirling around his head. The shapes take on the forms of men and women, they slowly crawl to his feet, and lay prostrate, waiting on instruction. Arms outstretched in front of his throne, their bellies to the ground, they lie in wait. Silent praising rising from their conscience.
Dean tilts his head as he whispers in Cas’s right ear, enjoying it thoroughly when he feels the angel’s breath hitch.
Dean’s arms wrap around the other man easily and Cas settles onto him, his face buried in Dean’s shoulder.
He walks over to Zachariah, calmly, coolly, ignoring the throbbing pit that ached at the sight of Dean bleeding on a dingy floor facing an adversary on uneven footing.
Mary got up from her seat, “I’m retired now, so I’m going to leave the case work in your younger, more capable, hands.” She smiled as she headed to her room. “Yell if you need anything.”
“I only just graduated high school, you know? And uh… God, Sammy is a freakin’ lawyer, and you’re smart as all fuck, and I guess it was just one of those moments where I felt intimidated by your intelligence because uh… you… or I thought you betrayed me, and uh… I just kinda lashed out.”
Dean knew there was nothing he could say here, nothing that would make this better. So, he kissed the top of Cas’s head over and over while rubbing his arms and pressing them as close together as possible.
Cas smiles sweetly as he brushes back Dean’s hair with his hand. Dean leans into it again, and he hopes he’s as good at comforting Cas as Cas is at comforting him. He realizes how much easier it is here, with no one to judge, and the sound of the Ocean drifting into their room from the patio. He hopes he can be this open with the angel with they get back home.
Now Dean stands far enough away to not be seen by his younger self and his husband. Cas had never told him any of that and seeing it from the perspective of an outsider added an element Dean couldn’t describe. It was like watching a really sappy moment on “Dr. Sexy” but Dean was the recipient of the love speech. And he was wrecked. Cas’s speech and hold wrecked him, and he missed that handprint so fucking much.
Castiel knew his plan required two things – swiftness and participation. The first one would not be a problem, the second…
Dean swallows and kisses the top of Cas’s head. He allows the angel his short answer, knowing nothing else should be added.
“Cas, I didn’t mean it like that. You know I’m not good at this stuff, and you man, you’re freaking eloquent. You could be writing some sappy Lifetime love story and I’d still be gawking over how badass you are, but that doesn’t mean I don’t feel too, you know?”
Castiel stands, in silence, listening. He hears nothing, feels Dean’s panic and pain and rushes into the room to see Alastair choking Dean against the pentagram. He stabs him in the shoulder with the ancient knife that was in the Righteous Man’s possession, and it barely affects the demon. The demon pushes him onto the ground.
Castiel notices, wonders what could have made his father act so. He formulates a hypothesis as he continues with his story.
“I know how difficult that was for you to say, Dean, and I cannot tell you how meaningful I find your words.” Cas moved his thumb from Dean’s cheek to trace his lips.
A park bench with an elderly man presses itself into the forefront of Castiel’s mind and he wishes for it all to be over. The uncertainty is overwhelming.
Cas sighs and looks to the ceiling. Dean walks overs to him and sits on the coffee table across from him.
“Uh, when you got me from Zachariah and told me we had an appointment.” Dean looks to Cas hopefully, fear mingled in those greens.
Chuck bites into his with elation. Yolk dribbles down his chin and into his beard. He wipes it away with a paper towel before speaking. “You really are a good cook, Dean. I should’ve included that in the books more, rounded out your character.”
Another picture is of Cas holding a baby with Dean placing a hand on the baby’s head. Dean’s stomach suddenly feels as if has dropped from his body to the floor below him. A hole aches in his chest. He places the frame back down, positioning it so the picture will be facing the top of the nightstand. Silent sobs rack his frame, producing no tears or noise. Chuck killed these guys just because they weren’t the most entertaining story.
“I figured Dean could put it together for you.” Claire shrugged as she began to walk, making her uncle move to keep up with her.
Castiel looks to him with disbelief. “No, it is virtually impossible for an archangel to be destroyed.”
The summoning brings him to an abandoned building. He stands outside of it, his angelic nature not yet knowing how to remain fully unbridled causing wind and lightning. The doors of the building swing open, allowing Castiel entrance. The lights explode above him, and he looks up curiously. The sigils painted above, below, and around him are innumerable, and he is impressed by both their accuracy and intensity.
The creature watches with interest as the flush leaves Joe’s cheeks. His eyes become wet, and his hands visibly shake.
“Receptive don’t begin to cover it, man. I wanted you back the second you left. I told Chuck that if we gave him the ending he wanted you had to come back. There ain’t no kinda nothing without you, Cas.”
Castiel simply breathes, an action he still doesn’t really need to partake in, but one that feels natural nonetheless.
Castiel knows that this is Dean’s defense mechanism. He knows it, but that does not quell the absolute heartbreak happening just behind his ribcage.
“I love your father, but I am fully aware the life he led, the life he led you boys in was not always the most accepting.”
Castiel regards his former pupil proudly. “Indeed. So, if this a course of action we wish to persue, how do we do so?”
Cas looks to him with a furrowed brow and Dean answers his unasked question by pulling the angel’s body onto his own.
Castiel regards him with a head tilt and a smile. “Well, I believe we should eat at the dining room table. Is this the third date? I believe I have lost count.”
Sam couldn’t really determine why he kept talking, he just did. It was as if he couldn’t stop himself. Maybe it was because she was a captive audience, and he couldn’t discuss these things with Dean, Cas, or his Mom.
The Void drums his long fingers on the table beside him. He takes a slow, long drag from his pipe and taps the wood against his perfect teeth. He looks toward the minion beside and raises a dark brow expectantly. The minion nods nervously, disappears for but a moment and returns with a glass filled to the brim with a type of green liquid.
Dean’s faith in his best friend who sided with Crowley against them and took away Dean’s faith, quite possibly the only faith Dean’s ever had in someone other than his brother? Cas happened to him.
Castiel looks, wonders. He is slightly fearful, having never felt so helpless before in his existence.
Chuck chews on the end of his glasses thoughtfully as he closes the laptop. He looks to his son and Dean Winchester sitting on the couch, not a molecule of space between them. He nods slightly.
Cas breaks away from Dean’s mouth and looks down at the beauty of the other man. Dean’s green eyes are colored with lust and his perfect lips are slightly swollen and wet from Cas’s attention. His hair is mussed from Cas’s wandering hands, and the professor is entranced.
Castiel looks down at his hands, which are folded on the table. “I believe that particular interaction was removed during one of my fine tunings.”
“Those two would leave their shit everywhere and I can’t count the times I would find an article about capital punishment or some type of new tapeworm.” Dean made a disgusted face.
“Dean, stop calling her that, you’re going to say it in front of her accidently.” Cas looked concerned, there were days in the past he was afraid to chide Dean even in the slightest, days gone by where he felt he would be kicked out a moment’s notice. But now, Dean called him family, a brother. And although Castiel may not have truly known it, well, not exactly, he had no other models to go by after all, he knew ‘brother’ didn’t exactly fit for him where Dean was concerned. Okay, he mostly knew. Was pretty sure he knew anyway. And he was terrified Victoria knew as well. But, and this would always be the case, he didn’t care how Dean felt for him as long as he felt for him, family, friend, whatever. And now, he chided at will. “If I am to be her Guardian, we five will be spending a lot of time together, so please, don’t call her Buffy.”
Dean breaks the embrace, holding Cas at arm’s length with his hands on either of his shoulders. He purses his lips and makes sure he catches Cas’s eyes.
Dean didn’t even spare him a glance as he kept on eating. Chuck set their plates up on the peninsula, and Cas still wasn’t sitting at his spot.
Castiel searches Jimmy’s knowledge to answer Dean’s question and finds it fairly quickly. Dean thought he was making a joke.
Dean swallows, his Adam’s apple bobbing up and down, a motion Cas followed closely with his eyes. “What?”
then, and he feels guilt for tarnishing such an unadulterated thing. A small population of a rare type of fish go extinct in the Amazon.
Lamentations scatter throughout Castiel’s grace like sprinkles of paint, but he simply nods and flies away.
“Well, Cas, because those are two words you two default to in order to mask your true emotions, so, we’re taking them off the board.”
Castiel recognizes the voice, and his grace becomes cold and defensive. He stands as tall as his visage will allow.
Then there was Lee Webb, who, Dean had to admit, brought about some very pleasant memories. And Dean thought about it, between Lee’s blue eyes sneaking a glance every now and then to the man’s effortless flirting with just about everyone, Dean was always entranced. But that ship sailed long ago, and the absolute last thing Dean wanted to do to a guy who meant so much was make him feel little, because Dean couldn’t offer anything now. And Lee Webb was not a one-night stand. He was warmth when it was cold and a breeze when it was hot. He was adventure and promise and safety. Until he wasn’t. Until the one night when blue eyes looked at him and said, ‘I can’t do this anymore, Dean.’
Dean Winchester forgot that he drunkenly placed an ad for a roommate the night of his brother’s wedding. He was allowed to forget because no one responded to it. He did get a random text that said.
Balthazar shrugs. “It does not touch your soul, Dean. Only your ribs, which are significant because it was how Eve was born of Adam.”
” starts playing throughout the small house, filling the painter with a sense of nostalgia. With blue eyes that hold the most minuscule of tears, he returns to his canvas.
Balthazar puts the water bottle and the container safely on another plane and takes Cas’s face between his hands.
Thank you so, so much to all of the wonderful readers of this story!! Y'all are seriously the best!! Y'alls subscriptions, comments, bookmarks, and kudos warm my heart and inspire me to write!
Castiel averts his gaze, his eyes resting on a piece of sapphire laid into the tile on which he is standing. “I am not alone, and there will not be a fight.”
Okay, so the gesture may have gone straight to Dean’s soul, but still, Cas shouldn’t waste it on his coffee. With a smile he puts the mug to his lips.
Dean props himself onto Cas with his elbow. Green eyes look deeply into blue ones, easily finding their connection. Cas’s skin had a warm, rosy glow and Dean was once more entranced.
“Cas…” its breathed, it’s a plea, it’s a prayer on reverent lips - Dean Winchester was shattered at the altar of Castiel.
Dean Winchester posted the ad, closed his laptop, and leaned back onto the couch. His face made a pained expression as he answered his too loud phone.
“No, man, it’s only like an hour away and uh, younger me is probably there for the long haul. Uh, we’ll take Cas’s truck. You can fly. When you get there, stay all ‘invisible man’.”
The demon reaches out and chokes the Winchesters with demonic power, much as he choked him. He cannot move yet, his grace still repairing. He watches as Uriel smites the second demon and Anna takes his distraction as an opportunity to snatch her grace. A type of relief washes over the Seraph, knowing he will not have to kill his once friend.
“I adore you, Dean Winchester, and I will continue to adore you as long as I exist. I am willing to stay by your side in any capacity as long as you will have me.”
Fifteen grand, in cash. Dean could live off that for a good long while and he knew with his job he would need to. “Yeah, man, that works for me.”
“I have to be within a certain radius. By the time I got here today the Angel was already long gone.”
She plays with the band on her left ring finger, twisting the platinum back and forth. She knows she needs to finish the slides or Joe will wonder what she was doing. She takes several deep breaths and begins to type once more. The Oedipus complex was usually followed by the Elektra complex. Hannah always got snickers from that one in her Intro to Psych class.
Sam nods once more. “Yeah, we did. Okay, so, after we eat, I’m guessing there’s file folders? That angel always had file folders.”
Dean picks it up to further examine it. “I know Benny said this was extra lumber but I’m calling bullshit.”
Cas looked at his hunter and thought the man might need some space to process, and he did need to spend more time with Victoria.
Cas could sense his boyfriend’s anger and he gracefully gets up from the sofa, taking Dean’s hand and leading them into their bedroom.
Thank you so, so much for reading!! I would LOVE to hear from y'all!! Kudos are always appreciated! They warm my heart and make me smile. :-)
A smile plays on the creature’s stolen lips. “Yes. I…” Once more the being attempts to find the most destructive phrasing in Hannah’s memory: “am in love with him.”
Cas looked at Victoria and cocked his head to the side. He was going to find out if that transfer thing worked both ways. She could already read his mind, so what would the memory hurt? He put two fingers on her temple and closed his eyes.
Dean leans forward and places a sweet, short kiss to Cas’s lips. “I love you so fucking much angel.”
The blade slices clean, and the thing’s head stays on. The creature didn’t even seem bothered the knife went through what should have been flesh. Its eyes suddenly became voids, vast holes of nothingness.
After stumbling into the bathroom, showering, and changing into a tee and jeans, he walks straight to the coffee maker to find a note.
“Right? That’s why we took his class in the first place.” Sam was on a roll and even the big brother stare would not shut him up.
Dean looks at him, compassion and kindness apparent in his emerald eyes. Cas admires him for it and knows he has found a safe space.
Cas touches Dean’s lips gently with his own. He mumbles against the skin of his neck as he buries his head there: “I will never give up on you, Dean Winchester.”
Glass doors close gently behind him and he wraps his body around that of his boyfriend’s, his head resting on Cas’s shoulder.
Castiel smiles very slightly, and Dean can’t seem to look away. He watches as the angel’s hands effortlessly sign, a type of freedom in his movements.
As Zachariah advances, Castiel places his hand on the finished sigil, causing Zachariah to disappear in a flash of bright white light.
She smiles at him sweetly. “Dean, if you are even thinking about an apology, I’m going to have to stop you. I’m happy. And Jack…” She trails off, making sure she has Dean’s eyes looking at hers.
Cas reached over and put his hand on Dean’s. “I understand now, Dean. You love me, and you want this to be something for the long-term, which is what I want too. I understand how difficult this will be for you, and I will be here for you every step of the way. If you need someone to talk to before you talk to Sam or your Mother, Victoria might be an option.”
“Jess and I needed a humanities class for gen ed requirements, and we thought we’d take one together, so we researched.”
Castiel was accustomed to the change of topics from the hunter, but that didn’t mean he wasn’t exasperated by them.
Window air conditioning units were humming loudly, disrupting the stillness of the Southern May humidity. She hears an ice cream truck and furrows her brow at the noise. Children scamper out of the building holding dollar bills. They run by the creature, one bumping into her leg.
Cas shakes his head with amusement at Dean, he smiles at the promise of a second date. He begins to eat his own food.
Cas nods as he heads to his room. With a haste that surprises him, he packs all of his belongings into his suitcases. He carefully places the copy of “Beowulf” his twin bought for him in its special place in his suitcase.
He inhales deeply, allowing the sweet smoke to fill his formed lungs. He releases his breath in puffs of smoke. The rings encompass and encircle his head, creating a type of mobile. He watches as they disappear into the nothingness above him, entranced.
“Can we buy the first one then, and then leave? Please? It is already ten and we are supposed to meet Dean at eleven.”
“You wouldn’t.” Cas smiles sadly and moves his hand from Dean’s shoulder back to his knee. He could read from Dean’s reaction that the other man got comfort from the feeling, and Cas did as well.
A man with tanned, weather-worn skin, and a bright smile exposing pleasantly crooked teeth clasps the man who spoke to Castiel on the shoulder fondly.
Castiel almost flings himself on the bed when they arrive back at the motel. However, he is stoic, not betraying a single emotion present within his grace.
“You don’t need to. Anyway, Anna will be self-righteously pissed at that and come see you, and we’ll uh, capture her.”
Claire finally convinced him to see a therapist, Mia Vallens. And Cas had to admit, Mia helped him regain his life. He had even been on a couple of dates since, and even though they didn’t turn into anything, he still did it, and even had a good time. Inias turned into a friend, which Castiel always felt lucky to have.
“Dean, are you all right?” Cas lifted two fingers to the hunter’s temple. Which Dean batted away with his hand, because now was not the time to be touched by an angel. Ha.
Castiel enters the vessel of one Claire Novak and the familiar feeling immediately washes over him. He is ready. And none too soon.
“Uh, so, yeah, we’re done for the day. The next chapter is gonna be the whole, can you stop this seal from being broken and torture this demon, Dean? Thing.”
Chuck simply shrugs as he places his plate into the sink and heads to his customary spot in the armchair.
in a long time. The piffling had disappeared, and in its stead was this feeling that could almost be described as peace – in doing the right thing.
He means it, truly. So many assignments, so many things are regrettable. But his one last hope is that he can bring Anna a peaceful, instantaneous death and that her soul will be reunited with her parents in Heaven.
Castiel fills his visage with air and then lets it out in the semblance of a breath. “Are you not tired, Lucifer, of trying, of holding out hope for something that will never come to fruition?”
“I take it from your lack of disclosure of your address, along with your lamentations of…” Balthazar slightly shakes the Tupperware full of Marv, “fighting the supernatural, you’ve met someone?” The angel speaks with a hint of envy, but also optimism for Castiel, a man he finds himself inexplicably drawn to. The angel is fully aware he cannot offer Castiel what he needs, but he always had a type of hope that one day someone would.
“Yeah, of course. Uh, so, this is going to take a lot of research, I’m thinking we call in the whole team, make a weekend of it.”
Zachariah snickers. “Do you really think we didn’t know the layout of Hell? We sent you in on the wrong side, ensuring that you would not reach Dean until he had already shed blood.”
He opens the fridge to find everything he needs to make classic diner food, which, to be honest, was a perfect first date for him and Cas. He smiles to himself as he begins to prepare the potatoes. A groggy Cas stumbles from the bedroom at six thirty, when Dean has just finished putting the burgers together.
“Because you’re entertaining Cas. You’re fun. No matter how many times we torture you, you always just go back to loving
“Whoa there tiger.” He laughs, dropping his keys into a bowl they keep on a small table beside the door.
Dean brings their foreheads together. “You’re fucking amazing, Cas, you know that? And I am going to make it unforgettable, I promise.”
Dean pulls his husband closer to him on the couch they bought for the Dean Cave, the recliners now sitting on either side of it, a coffee table in the middle like a proper living room.
