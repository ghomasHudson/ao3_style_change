That runaway mouth? Yeah... It had been (mostly) in check for just a little too long. She couldn't resist, sick or not. The billionaire ended up smacking Spangles on the bicep, quickly getting his attention and causing him to raise a brow at her.
With Dr. Banner supposedly coming on board and Loki in confinement at thirty-thousand feet in the air, on top of everything else, it was bound to be a pressure cooker situation.
Toni didn't like it when people did this to her. In what may have been a bit of a reckless, impulsive decision, she gave a light (and literally shocking) poke to Bruce's side with the small electric prod she'd been holding. She was satisfied with the little yelp of pain and the following laugh and smile she got from him.
Doubling up on her anxiety medication had probably been the dumbest thing that Toni had done in a long, long time. That, combined with being on an airship of all places, only served to make her queasy, lightheaded and sensitive to all the artificial light in the lab.
That would not always be the case, however. It had gradually become physical, from just shoving and pushing around to full blown beatings. There were times it had gotten so bad, the Iron Man pilot had been unable to move the next day.
That definitely wasn't Bruce she'd met earlier. Something was really wrong, and she had all beliefs it had to do with that scepter. In addition, Fury doing his best at 'politely' (Toni almost snorted, as if he could be polite) calling her out on her little hacking endeavor did not help her anxieties, either.
Whether he noticed Thor's discomfort, Toni wasn't sure, but the S.H.I.E.L.D director didn't miss a beat this time. "Last year, Earth had a visitor from another planet who had a grudge match that leveled a small town. We learned that not only are we not alone, but we are hopelessly...hilariously...outgunned."
Not thirty seconds later 'Shoot to Thrill' was blaring through the carrier craft's speakers. Toni could practically see the Black Widow face palming.
But if it was true, it was bittersweet. He was glad that Peggy had found someone that he had thought of as good person, that could take care of her, but it was still sad to have concrete evidence that she had moved on to another man.
However, her thoughts potential sexual conquests would have to wait. Toni turned her sights to Dr. Banner, grinning and extending her hand.
"Yeah! And you'll have your little cube back, no muss, no fuss." The look Fury sent her way spoke volumes. He couldn't kill her, right? She was too high profile...right?
...And even though Toni could be obnoxious and a smart-ass, as she'd proven with Captain Rogers, he had a feeling there was a good heart under all the flashiness and boldness, somewhere.
...All because of Spangles a few doors down, who apparently had as much distaste for her as her father did.
"I assumed you were tracking the tesseract." He didn't bother to hide his irritation with her. Just her, she highly doubted he'd want to piss off Bruce.
Before she could reply, Captain Rogers cut her off. "I'm sure if she still made weapons, Ms. Stark would be neck deep..."
"You're on that list? Are you above or below angry bees?" She looked at him as innocently as possible.
Even though he did find her attitude insulting, he himself felt guilty. He had never acted that harshly towards a woman before.
...It would be nice to feel pretty and feminine (and less like a bad science project) for once, though.
That said: I absolutely despise my hasty style of writing from ages ago and feel like this work, out of everything I’ve done (published and unpublished), deserves the full rewrite/rework treatment. Though I’m not as heavily into Marvel as I used to be, I still enjoy this idea lot, and this one is still special to me.
If there was one thing Toni Stark was known for (and she was known for many, many things), it was making an entrance, Iron Man suit or not.
She'd be damned if she moved an inch with him; she'd get the last word in if it killed her. Spangles leaving before she could get in a final retort earlier had gotten right under her skin. He'd acted like she would bend to his will, here was no way Anthoni Elizabeth Stark would act like some demure forties housewife and let him step on her.
Toni wasn't backing down. He was a jackass, walking in like he owned the place. This wasn't the forties and she wasn't going to just sit there and take it.
Toni instantly looked back at him, features softened. "You're lucky too...I looked at your file. Doc...all that gamma radiation? It should have killed you."
Toni had always been an intensely smart young woman (and she was going with that; she'd be damned if she admitted out loud that she was thirty-five), even if some of her decisions could be considered questionable. Or kind of tasteless. Or both.
His feet felt frozen to the floor, and he found some deep part of him getting incredibly angry and upset. He didn't like the closeness of the pair one bit.
Toni glanced away, flustered, not willing to divulge something that personal. She also wasn't used to attention like this. Sure, she had slept with men before, but she didn't let it go any further than that. This kind of intimacy was new. She had always taken care of her own self or Pepper stepped in and loaned a helping hand, like when she changed the core to the arc reactor for the first time.
With all that being said, that didn't mean she was unshakeable on the inside in these situations. Particularly, Toni hated confrontation, even though she seemed to be the cause of a great deal (her mouth tended to run away with her emotions...sometimes) of the incidents she had been involved in.
Finally breaking the silence for fear of insanity, she asked the unspoken question. "So...what's your secret?"
So, naturally, she didn't completely believe the entire shtick that S.H.I.E.L.D wanted her to buy in to. Why would they need an alien power source? What the hell could they possibly have going
And with that, the doctor snapped. "In case you needed to kill me...but you can't! I'd know, I tried. I got low, I didn't see an end, so I put a bullet in my mouth and the other guy spit it out. So I moved on, I focused on helping other people. I was good until you dragged me back into this freak show and put everyone here at risk. You wanna know my secret, Agent Romanoff? You wanna know how I stay calm?"
"What do you think you're doing?" The woman sighed. Spangles had come off so straitlaced and uptight it was stifling to her.
Toni paused, thoughtful for a moment. Maybe this wouldn't be so horrible after all, this man knew what he was talking about.
That was complete and utter bullshit. People did like her, damn it! She had Pepper and Happy and Rhodey and...erm...well... that was it.
Toni's blood was practically boiling at that. Apparently she was damned if she did and damned if she didn't in the eyes of society; in the eyes of everyone. She forced herself up off the table, closing the space between her and the super soldier. "Fuck you, Rogers. This isn't about me."
Needless to say, the mother-daughter relationship had been almost nonexistent; she had grown up as a bit of a tomboy, fending for herself.
She dropped the Widow a simple "Miss me?" message that didn't need a response and descended to the ground, training everything she had on the suit on Loki.
Back to reality, the billionaire spoke. "I'll be fine, Dr. Banner, I promise." Her tone wasn't harsh, or snappy. She wasn't going to argue with him and risk a Hulk-out, not with feeling the way she did now.
Finally tearing his gaze away and willing his body to start moving again, the living legend stalked off, past the lab, to the lower levels of the airship.
Currently, she was trying to ignore how bad she felt, chipping away at time in the lab with Dr. Banner. She was anxiously waiting for JARVIS to get into S.H.I.E.L.D's mainframe and clue her in on all of Fury's dirty little secrets.
Wait, did she really sound like that? If so, the voice of the suit really needed tweaking. It was masculine, since she had wanted to keep her identity a secret originally (she had let that cat out of the bag), but it almost sounded too auto-tuned to her. One more thing to add to the to do list.
"Never said you weren't." He didn't bother looking up. "Are you on any sort of depressants? Your pulse is really low, and your skin is clammy."
He sighed just a little, turning and walking back to the scepter. He removed his glasses and rubbed his temples in a vain attempt to ease the stress headache he felt coming.
Toni glared at the reactor and thumped it hard, annoyed that was a dead give away to her less-than-stellar physical state. The jolt of pain that shot through her body in response made her yelp and double over.
Steve saw Dr. Banner lift the scepter and immediately made a move to stand in front of Ms. Stark. She might agitate him to no end and thoroughly get under his skin, but she was the only link to the past he had left. Plus, she was only human, and not the healthiest from the looks of it. Again, he could relate.
The blonde mentally sighed, his stride quickly taking him up to the lab Toni and Dr. Banner were currently occupying. He was ready to get all of this over with and just go back to his apartment and...well, do nothing special. Continue trying to cope with the present, he guessed.
It was odd being around someone as perceptive and as genius (well, almost...Toni Stark didn't have peers) as herself; he'd seen right through her.
"Me? But I don't mean harm to anyone. My people want peace." The Asgardian had a genuinely hurt look crossing his features. Toni almost felt a little sorry for Point Break. He hadn't come off as a bad guy.
Steve just looked at her blankly, exasperated with her attitude. "And you wonder why no one likes you, Miss Stark? You're the most obnoxious person I've ever met."
Not one to give up her usual snark, she instantly had a come back. "I don't look good and I've been a boring lab partner? Why, if I was any less of a woman, Dr. Banner, I might be insulted."
." He did not miss the traces of venom on her voice. "Of all the people in this room right now, who is: A.) wearing a skin tight, Spangly outfit, and B.) not of use?
...And in that very same moment, Steve Rogers realized that Toni Stark wasn't a 'bully'. She had been definitely been bullied, and he could relate to that. She was hurting under that obnoxious, arrogant, and downright rude facade, but was just too proud to show it. He instantly backed down, guiltier now than ever.
The two began to discuss how to track the tesseract when the deadly red-head chimed in. "When did you become an expert in gamma radiation, Stark?"
Pfft, who cared anyway? It wasn't like she was a super model. She was Toni Fucking Stark, genius and super hero.
Toni's grin widened. "Why, last night, when Coulson decided to ruin my night with homework." She had indeed read everything, even though she had to admit the Captain's file intrigued her the most. She took the question as a rather poor attempt at a jab at her ego from the Widow.
She chalked that awkward, random thought up to not getting laid in quite a while with a tinge of insomnia.
She talked herself up, commanding the attention of all the people in the room, and even called one poor crewman out on playing Galaga. All of her efforts created a distraction while she slipped a microchip that would allow JARVIS to get into S.H.I.E.L.D's mainframe under one of Fury's monitors.
The arguing continued, and eventually Toni thought she had finally breached that thick skull of his. At some point during it all, Bruce threw his hands up in defeat at the heated conversation and turned back to his work.
The dark haired woman was shaken out of her spaced out state and glanced over at Dr. Banner, who was looking back at her over his glasses.
If he got to the Black Widow, though, she didn't show it. "You didn't come here because I bat my eyelashes at you."
Had he turned around, he'd have seen the flattered look that even Toni couldn't hide. She had always highly respected the doctor's work, and that little extension of camaraderie meant a lot, whether she'd admit it or not.
"I know my rack is a thing of art, but doctor, your staring could make a harlot blush." Sure, her breasts were a little smaller in comparison to say, Natasha, but they were perky and cute and damn it if she wasn't proud of them.
What the hell was wrong with her, with all the erratic and completely non-logical thoughts? She was oscillating from near-hatred for the blonde to wanting to jump his bones every few seconds.
"S.H.I.E.L.D's planning to use the tesseract to make HYDRA weapons." He paused for a split second, turning to Toni. "Sorry, computer was a little slow for me."
Bruce looked stunned that he'd actually picked up the alien weapon. It took a second for him to regain his composure. With a humorless laugh he turned to face everyone. "Sorry kids, guess you don't get to see my party trick after all."
Toni was thankful for the lull in the heated conversation, but she didn't expect anything that came next. Bruce walked over to one of the screens and turned it, almost a little too angrily, pointing at the weapon schematic JARVIS had found. "Now, I want to know what S.H.I.E.L.D wants to do with weapons of mass destruction."
Steve Rogers had decided to a do a little investigating of his own, but not before he spoke to Ms. Stark first. He didn't like the way he acted toward her, and definitely felt like he should apologize. Or attempt an apology, at least.
That confrontation with Captain America and Thor had not been fun. Thor had almost taken her fucking head off more than once during that...skirmish...and Cap's bright idea to get Thor to hit his shield still had her ears ringing.
From experience, being the small-ish woman she was, confrontation meant things typically were not going to work out for her. She was a fit female, yes, the suit didn't pilot itself. However, she wasn't a woman that could really do a whole hell of a lot of damage in a physical altercation.
As she entered the bridge, she had a plan of attack ready and her game face on. Said game face had become more like a mask, but it would be a cold day in hell before she admitted that.
Had it not been for her less-than-charming personality, there was a good chance Steve would have been drooling earlier when her shirt had risen up to reveal just a hint of tanned skin and a flat, toned stomach.
As if on cue, Stars, Stripes and Apple Pie came bursting back into the lab with some bad SyFy Original Movie-esque weapon and tossed it up on the table in front of everyone.
"Never mind. Guess you missed a lot doing time as a Cap-sicle." She kept a straight face. Ribbing was good, even if she was the only one that found it funny.
Toni loathed that look and the following shame it caused. Her father always gave her that look, and the same look was now gracing the face of his greatest creation, her childhood hero. The person she wished she was some nights, when she was tending to new bruises. It hurt.
Chapters 1-9 are currently just being moved from FF.net to Ao3 per a request, and are completely unedited. I take full responsibility for all plot holes/bad writing/errors/etc. Gotta start somewhere, right?
"You forced our hand, we had to come up with something." The S.H.I.E.L.D. Director was grim in his reply.
Fury remained unfazed at the childish behavior, just as annoyed as ever. To add to the already volatile mix of egos, in came Natasha and Thor.
"Quite the contrary, really." He smiled a little, and took her wrist in his hands, checking her pulse.
Toni stood there, shocked. She never really thought of Bruce as the type to be suicidal. She had contemplated the act a few times herself, when drunk and when sober, but she'd held the doctor to a higher standard than she did her own self...
Steve softened slightly at Toni's unwillingness to back down. She was stubborn, just like his Peggy had been. She even looked a little like Peggy. Her resemblance to Howard was undeniable, though. She definitely had her father's eyes, as well as his trademark smirk.
Jesus Christ he was solid. Her hand actually hurt. Shockingly, though, she suppressed the wave of dirty thoughts that came to mind.

She had always had a little crush on him as a child, from all the stories her dad had told her, before things got...bad.
That said: I absolutely despise my hasty style of writing from ages ago and feel like this work, out of everything I’ve done (published and unpublished), deserves the full rewrite/rework treatment. Though I’m not as heavily into Marvel as I used to be, I still enjoy this idea lot, and this one is still special to me.
Bruce actually chuckled. That response was typical enough Toni, from what he had seen, but he didn't believe for a second that it was anything more that a well practiced charade.
Steve ignored the insult, and decided to be the bigger person and leave. That was the easiest way to get the best of people like Toni.
When she was growing up, everything being this eerily quiet meant she was about to pay for something she did or didn't do, mostly from her father.
"And you haven't been? Your tactics aren't that different." Burn. Toni laughed a little. Who'd have thought Banner would've had it in him?
"Relax, gramps. It was all in good fun." Toni came around the table and stood in front of the Captain, arms crossed in an attempt to make her one hundred and twenty-three pound frame seem a little more intimidating. He was easily double her size, and probably had upwards of a foot on her.
Yes, she'd heard all the hush-hush comments from the likes of Christian Dior to Yves Saint Laurent about the arc reactor and the various other ways she 'ruined' their gowns, and she didn't appreciate it.
Toni figured this would happen. She just had to piss Pepper off when Coulson was trying to get a hold of her. She made a mental note to at least try and not agitate the redhead again...for a while...anyway.
If he was was going to go about this, he'd have to be ready to say his piece and be done before she spoke. He had seen first hand that Toni was the type of person that, if you let her get even a word in edgewise, it was over. She'd continue to talk until she got the last word in.
Back in her facade, she raised a ridiculously perfect, manicured eyebrow at him and pressed her self closer so that they were chest to chest. She noted to herself that he felt like leaning into a brick wall.
The next thing Toni knew, there was substantial pressure around her lower back and shoulders and her cheek was pressed against something cold. Terrified at the possibility she was was trapped under debris and panic overriding rationality, she jerked her head up and prepared to scream for help (though she kind of doubted anyone would come). She was shocked to find herself staring at a silver star and heard a groan of pain that was much to deep to be her own. It quickly clicked that pressure as coming from two large arms encircling her and that she was resting on something much too warm to be the floor.
"Ahh...thanks...I think." The much more humble, taller genius took her hand. She was the shortest one of almost all people in the room, slightly lower than eye level with the Black Widow.
"Loki's in your head, Dr. Banner. He's manipulating you." It was at that moment that Toni was glad that Natasha had never been a hostage negotiator. The thought almost made her snicker out loud.
The shock wave that ripped through the ship sent an already off-balance Toni flying. She covered her face and head with her arms and squeezed her eyes shut, prepared to slam head first into the tables on the opposite side of the room. The last thing she wanted was to be knocked out cold in the middle of a crisis.
And on that note, she excused herself. The confrontation had shaken her, to say the least. She needed a second to recompose herself.
The billionaire took a quick head count of the people in the room, and her stomach knotted just a little when she saw Spangles sitting there. God, he was a beautiful creature, with those baby blues and that chiseled face. Even though she felt heated jealously toward the super soldier (and, hell, possibly a little hatred), she was undeniably physically attracted to him. Her body, and possibly some messed up part of her mind, wanted him.
Jesus Christ, did her little bit of teasing really piss him off that bad? It wasn't like she was bullying him or anything. He didn't have to retaliate by attacking her character. She really had tried to change over the past few years.
As calmly as possible, he addressed the angry doctor. "Dr. Banner, please put the scepter down. There's no reason for this."
...At that moment, Toni Stark realized that she would be vilified by almost everyone in the room no matter what she did.
Dr. Banner interrupted the stare down between the two women, clearing his throat. "I've already gotten Fury to get ahold of any lab with spectrometer and have them placed on the roofs, calibrated to track gamma rays. It won't pinpoint this thing but I think we can get close."
On the outside, Toni Stark appeared to be nigh unshakeable in any given situation. She had been through damn near everything in her not-too-terribly-long life, from Howard's drunken rampages to Obie's dark turn and her subsequent capture by a terrorist cell to just having to to deal with a heart that didn't really...well...function.
"Huh. You really do have a lid on it." She was impressed. Toni had thought that might have upset him a little or at least evoke a little more of a reaction.
The Captain's disgusted, condescending looks from earlier still weighed in on her mind, as well. Toni hadn't felt so inferior and pathetic in years, not since her parents were alive.
That aside, the thunderstorm had really picked up outside the carrier craft. Even stranger, Loki didn't seem too thrilled about it.
If you’re curious to see what I’m up to, feel free to browse or follow me at breezeinmonochromenight.tumblr.com
Toni saw that Spangles was visibly disgusted. "I was right after all. The world hasn't changed a bit." The genius frowned. She honestly didn't like that he, out of everyone involved in this, had been lied to. He didn't deserve that.
She winced a little, the physical pain caused in those memories still fresh in her mind, to this day.
"...I'm not overly fond of what follows." The reply was kind of odd, to say the least. The expression on Loki's face was one of being mildly perturbed. The Captain had a confused look on his face, almost mirroring her own.
Fury paused, and actually looked as if he was just a little dumbstruck. If Toni hadn't had the practice of hiding her emotions so well, she was sure her eyebrows would have shot up, possibly off of her forehead at the current clusterfuck.
Toni shrugged nonchalantly, still gripping the table. "No offense, but I'm kinda wondering the same about you."
Had she been at home (and God did she wish she was right about now), she'd have drank herself into oblivion to stop thinking about it.
Toni and Dr. Banner had been working in the lab for some time in almost total silence after the good doctor had politely declined her offer to work and have free reign at Stark Tower. At this point, the billionaire thought she was going to go mad. Plus, he felt like a sort of kindred spirit to her, so she wanted a chance to pick the non-green doctor's brain.
Presently, the genius' brilliant mind was pounding against her skull. She was white-knuckling a corner table in the lab and silently pleading with herself not to be sick or pass out. Toni was incredibly worried about Bruce and a potential Hulk-out, as he seemed to be even worse for wear than her. The fact that he was suspiciously close to and protective of Loki's scepter ever-so-slightly freaked Toni the fuck out.
"Dr. Banner, it's a pleasure to meet you. I hear you're the leading expert in gamma radiation. And, I have to admit, I'm also a fan of the way you...y'know...turn into an enormous green rage monster."
“Oh, you’re here, thought you were too busy making out with everybody’s favourite golden-boy. So. Is he any good?”
She chuckled, well, it was more like a passive “HmHm” behind her closed mouth, which was just at the right time for Steve’s name to be called and he could pick up his latte. Tony drank his black, but Steve hadn’t developed the taste for that just yet.
look for him. You… You find him. You hear me?” Tony stopped speaking before his voice faltered anymore.
“Let’s see, I quit gymnastics. But I got a grant for my research and I started teaching a self-defence class on the weekends, so, things are coming together.”
“Whatever. I need to go smoke.” Nat announced to the room, and caused Steve to dip in the couch more as she got up. “Coming?”
Eventually Tony would restlessly roll over, and Steve would force himself to shut his eyes with the realisation that Tony was on a different plane of existence to himself,
wanted), but he wouldn’t know, because Tony dove underneath the covers, pulling the sheet over his head and ripping the wire out of both of their ears – he made some disturbed, disgusted noise before he did it.
He implied with the shaking of his head, although he had to drop dead a second later when Brian sat up.
It was full of torn out sketches that had been stuffed in between the leather roughly. He sifted through random sketches of trees, books, wondering why Bucky thought this had any use to him. Until he reached a portrait of Tony he’d never seen before, pencilled in, black and white.
There were moments, in the night, where he had conveniently turned over at the same time as Tony, and they were facing one another. When Tony’s eyes were shut, Steve could look at him, too dark to see detail, but enough to look at him without guilt or shame, because Tony wasn’t looking back at him with those dangerous deep eyes that questioned every move he made and he wasn’t with his boyfriend. He could look at Tony’s naked eyelid and his lashes that were still thick, black and curled without any of the makeup. His pouting lips, with no anger or even a wicked smile which either would make him tense. He calmed him, made him feel safer in his own room than he did when he wasn’t there, almost otherworldly, like when Tony was asleep and slightly peaceful, he was finally at one with his own body, something he could not fathom to access when he was awake.
“Since I didn’t register that it was apparently 45 degrees out here, you wanna talk about it now or are you going to keep moping?” He didn’t go for another cigarette, still getting used to using them.
There was a clanging of metal from behind him, he turned towards it in enough time to swipe his thoughtful thumb away from his lip.
“I don’t know why you feel like you should hide. You don’t look like a swamp goblin, you look great.”
He could definitely get used to months of this, Tony, travelling and laughing, maybe bickering every now and again. Just the two of them against the world.
He stopped himself, when he looked at Steve, the black makeup on his left eye smeared across his collarbone, slightly damp and shiny, like blood in the dark.
“Okay – Wait. Can I talk to you? It’s cool if you’re busy.” Steve turned around from the pile of thin pillows and blankets he had been shoving his face into. Figuring if he were to successfully ‘move on’ from a relationship he never had he should probably take some initiative and maybe not let all of his friendships degrade in front of him.
“I had a feeling you’d follow me. You have a tendency of doing that.” He dipped his head up with a smile, warm and inviting, and familiar with each tentative step Steve made towards him, leaves crackling beneath his shoes like the distant fire. “Just as well, it’s probably more fun to look at this with someone else.”
A gentle laugh passed from Steve’s lips, the sight of Tony’s smile was comforting for the first time, he wasn’t scared, not at all.
Hopefully, in those brief moments of laughter and pure glee where nothing else mattered, Tony would forget that he didn’t want to be that way with Steve, and would keep laughing and smiling in that way he does until he remembers that he doesn’t want Steve to like him.
Like the news had just washed over him, as if it was nothing, as if it was just a fable or a made up tale.
“That’s not your job, Mr Rogers, but I appreciate the sentiment. And, it is very egotistical to assume that
“What is it like?” Bucky asked out of nowhere as he opened his beer across a table from Steve. They must’ve moved the dining room table into the kitchen prior to the party, crowding it with ice buckets of beer, a punch bowl and many, many bowls of chips. His tone resembled a very curious child.
He turned to Bucky with his unsure, angled expression, and Bucky looked back with a wide grin, Steve wondered if they were listening to the same thing, because his friend was clearly having a better time than he was.
He tried to reason it to himself, maybe he got lost, maybe Tony went to the wrong bus station? No, he wasn’t wrong. Perhaps he did chicken out.
He prayed as he deftly snuck into the van. It was a mess inside, dead bugs on the counters and what Steve thought was a gram of coke under the cash register. Never mind that, he grabbed about six pretzels off of a ring and shoved them in a bag, more thrilled than he should be.
“Trust me, he’ll believe it. Whether he’s gonna shoot the messenger is the question, so just lay back, alright?”
When he got up in the morning, flickers of light shining through the blinds between both of their beds, Bucky was already awake, sitting at his desk with a bowl of cereal, scrolling mindlessly on his phone.
Something shimmered in a dull light between his fingers, until he flipped it on the top of his nail up to Steve, and he caught it, in his spare hand, maybe that impressed him a little.
He cleared his throat and wore a proud smile as he wrapped his arm around Natasha’s mesh covered shoulder, squeezing her as she smiled at him and only him with her bright red lips.
“Oh, gotcha. Well he’s not the first man to try and explore those troubled waters. We’ll see how that goes.” He mumbled. “Weren’t into the show, then?” Steve didn’t think his opinion mattered to his person, but maybe it did.
There was a sad glimmer in Tony’s eye, they flickered and searched Steve’s face. Like he was confused, like he’d never heard anyone say anything like that to him in his life. His lip quivered as if he wanted to say
“T- OH MY GOD. I can’t believe you! It’s f-fucking freezing in here!” Steve yelled, tall enough to practically stand up in the pond, running his wet hands over himself to stay warm, Tony was laughing, devilishly – squatting on the rock in an attempt to show off to his faux rival once again.
She smiled at him in her usual way, obviously picking up on his not so subtle attempt to ask her why she was hiding in an empty bedroom.
“Yeah.” Tony replied immediately. “Just, you know, you and your ex, seeing you together, that didn’t make me nervous if that’s what you’re asking. That is what you’re asking isn’t it?” He was talking very fast.
Steve smiled nonchalantly, enjoying Tony’s face twist from indignation to confusion to a challenging glare.
Maybe it was because the commentator had called the bands name out, so they all had to get on stage. He watched him while he sat behind the drums, obviously pretending like he had as much to set up as Rhodey, Clint and Natasha, a blank, oddly neutral face.
“H- alright, let me try and make this… Sad, little fire, better.” Steve scooted closer to Tony, who watched him, carefully, the light dazzling around his dark eyes giving him away.
He thought hard about how to respond. He could send one back, but that might look weird, maybe make a joke? -
“What? No, no I wasn’t uh, listening to you on the phone if that’s what you think – I’m waiting for the bathroom.”
“I’ve still got my scholarship; I get enough money to get by as it is. I know I haven’t thought it all the way through Buck but when have I with anything?” Steve zipped up his bag and looked at his friend. “Come on, I don’t want to leave on a sour note.”
“I’m guessing this must be important?” She had to stand on her tiptoes to talk into his ear, or else he wouldn’t be able to hear her.
Out of nowhere, once again, he saw Tony leaving the bar alone, in the middle of pulling out a cigarette.
“I’ve been keeping tabs, I worry about Tony. He’s a troubled kid, and I don’t think you’re any good for him – see, all you’ve done since you’ve shown up is fuck up every one’s life. Mine, Tony’s, I heard about that little situation with your friend and the redhead. Don’t you ever think they’d be so much better without you?”
His hand stayed there for slightly too long, brown eyes following his face for a reaction, positive or negative – but he pulled away before he could get one, and Steve refused to let the delicacy of his fingers make him shiver.
No one knew about them just yet, only Bucky, who partially had to tell him where he was all the time and because sometimes Tony wanted to come over and cuddle in
Fortunately, Bucky didn’t seem too interested where Steve was going once a week, and it’s not his football teammates ever invited him out, so for the next few weeks he went alone after college to see the band, because he liked rock music. That was the only reason. Obviously.
in the crowd. Tony seemed engaged in conversation already, but Steve didn’t quite catch what they were speaking about, because he went quiet when he saw Steve.
Tony smirked at his hesitation. Staring into him until he gave in all the while Steve was trying his hardest not to grab Tony and kiss him again. The night in Steve’s dorm, Tony was… insecure. If Steve didn’t know everything about what that was like he would wonder why, because looking at him, his toned chest, the lightening scar that ran down the middle of it, even the way his stomach ever so slightly pudged… He was perfect.
When Tony just kept staring, like Steve was showing him something completely incomprehensible, he flattened it out, reaching forward, tentatively, as Tonys eyes flickered in confusion - he draped it over Tonys shoulders, and his chest and his knees and his arms, it practically covered him completely in the beetle position he curled himself up in.
“H - Yeah, course.” Tearing his eyes away from Tonys and glancing around at everyone else who seemed just as relieved and or confused.
Every ounce of hope in his gut sunk into the acid in his stomach into nothing. The worst of it being that he knew he had no right to feel that way, Tony had known Ty his whole life, Tony had met Steve three times.
“What’s that supposed to mean?” Tony smirked. “You goin’ to take me out to dinner and buy me flowers? I thought we were past that by now.”
So, as any genius, love-sick fool, hopeless romantic (kinda) would – he set out to try and tell Tony he liked him without actually telling him he liked him. It was an amazing idea by any standards.
“Tony?!” Bucky announced to every garbage can and rat in the alleyway. “I- I didn’t even think you too were close, let alone…”
Apparently, the horrible and real reality that Tony probably, maybe, has sex, real gay sex with his actual boyfriend was just too much of  a shock to his fragile (hasn’t had sex in months) system that he just stood there in the hallway in a cold sweat listening to it, to them.
Tony smiled crookedly, eyes following Ty as he stood up, observing his movements across the room as he left in a muddle with the others.
Tony gave little regard to Steve as he got up and walked away, Rhodey swiftly took his place beside Steve. Steve wished he drank more, so it wouldn’t be awkward, they’d never spoken properly before, he got the impression that Tony’s best friend wasn’t really leaning into him as much as he’d want. Then again, he should be at least thankful, he had more friends now than he had for the entirety of high school.
“There’s no alcohol in this?” He asked as he took it from Tonys hands, brushing his pinky with his pointer finger as he did and muttering a ‘thank you’.
So it seemed that apologies weren’t even easy with Tony, not that they should be, but he was so good at turning simple gestures into part of his big distraction game – don’t feel too much, don’t show it, get over it, look, look, I have something shiny, oh please get lost in my big brown lovely doe eyes and forget anything ever happened, forget that everything isn’t okay.
“You should probably talk to him.” Rhodey nailed sarcastically, before turning away to continue his conversation with Natasha again, deciding the
“I’m glad you enjoyed it from your lonely table.” She smiled, and glanced at where he had been sitting at something, although the didn’t follow her eyes.
“You know, ‘Bucky’, at some point, the things people do stops being so surprising. Maybe you’ll learn that from this. And… And if you’re so convinced that he hasn’t left on his own accord than by all means,
“Really?” Tony tilted his head. “I’m offering you Italy or France and you wanna go see Abe Lincoln?”
“I know how to do it myself.” Tony grumbled, quietly, but with adamance in his voice, but flinched, as Thor rumbled into him, slapping a hard hand onto his shoulder, hulking tall over Tony with a warm smile that detracted from his otherwise intimidating appearance.
He obviously didn’t know when this occurred, completely coincidental, a twisted change of fate. He no longer enjoyed the soothing tones of jazz or gentle guitar, nope, not at all.
Tony chuckled, and began tip toeing across smooth rocks, Steve, walking beside him on the ground, they were almost the same height that way. “Oh, you are melodramatic sometimes. No, of course not. Just… Being a tadpole. But really, I’m interested.”
Tony grabbed Ty by each side of his face, kissing him harshly and fiercely, so much so he stumbled backwards into the door frame.
There was music booming through the door, but through his nerves all he could focus on was the gold number 12 on the door.
Tony would cling to the only thing he had left of Steve. He didn’t know when he’d return, if ever. But he’d bind his love to the pages, and close to black leather cover on it. For as long as he needed to.
He quickly dodged a couple of bulky men crossing his path even though he had the right of way, like he knew instinctively to move out of the way. “I’m guessing it has something to do with the unplanned petty theft or my sociopathic boyfriend
The strangest sensation in the world had to be going into a different room during a party. Maybe it was just him, but the way the music faded out like the speakers were flooded and the people changed and atmosphere was just completely disjointed from the main setting was always unnerving.
When at an overcrowded house party with drunken horny college students, you learn to brace yourself before you open a closed door, but he found something, or better yet someone he wasn’t expecting to see.
Laughing freely, their hands and their feet brushing against one another, sensitive touches comforted by gentle laughs in the darkness, a sense of solidarity in their joint difference from everyone else, knowing more now about each other than they’d ever told anyone else.
“I’m glad.” Her painted lips strewed into a line as she turned her smile towards Bucky, who had already averted his gaze to her. “I think Steve here needs a drink to loosen up a bit.”
It was a reasonable size, a large living room with blankets and other tapestries draped over the couch, a tv in the corner playing an assortment of alternative music videos and songs blaring out of the speakers, the place was worn in, lived in, but the difference between the nice furniture and the safe location almost made all of it seem... forced. As if whoever lived there was trying their best to make a home out of something, to make it appear comfortable, like there were long and good memories there.
“No! No he’s clean, y’know.” Forgetting for a split second that this was all make believe, he gently lowered his body onto the pavement. Props to him for playing a very good passed out person.
Tony gave shell-shocked Steve another quick kiss before running back to the stage to help the other members of his band pack up, Steve thought he was shaking but it was just Thor and Bucky aggressively rattling his shoulders in excitement.
“Yeah alright, how about I make you my housewife?” He smiled back, licking the pad of his thumb and wiping away some of the black under Tonys eye, which he didn’t seem to appreciate, scrunching his nose up and turning his head away.
When Steve nodded, Tony nodded back, he turned back towards the door, and it made Steve want to be sick, until he turned around again, making an expression which was somewhere along the lines of disbelief and pure relief.
“I think that’s best for both of us.” Steve smiled, and didn’t realise how naturally it came to him.
There was no way out now. However many ways there were to say ‘I’m in way too fucking deep’ - He meant all of them.
Steve made Tony a big breakfast in the morning, he was all packed with just the ‘essentials’: several band t shirts, a few nice dress shirts, pants, underwear, socks, his makeup and nail polish, phone charger, a kindle, which Steve didn’t think people actually used, a bottle of Gatorade and something from his mother that he kept in a box and wouldn’t let Steve see.
Tony bundled out of the bathroom, the sleeve of his tank top hanging off of his shoulder, he had a couple short jagged scars there that he hadn’t noticed before, just like everything else about Tony he’d never seemed to notice until now.
Steve sighed, peering around the overly purple and yellow kitchen and swiping the condensation off of his beer bottle with his thumb.
Whenever Steve wasn’t with him, he felt like he was going through withdrawal. He had tried to tell that to Bucky one night, slightly drunk and staring at his bedroom ceiling – which only led to him being called a cringe-worthy idiot. Maybe he was right, he didn’t care if he was.
Steve didn’t know why he did it, or why Tony was doing what he was now. He saw the paint on his skin and something inside of him overwhelming and hot decided he needed to clear it away, get rid of any pain he or anyone else might have caused him.
“Nah. He’s not in the band, does publicity or something? I didn’t talk to him, seemed a little sketchy!”
Steve glanced over his shoulder when Tony’s touch ceased, he was dangling over the side of the bed, rifling through the pockets of his shorts which had been strewn across the floor by the bedside table. He had borrowed a pair of Bucky’s sweats to sleep in, because Steve’s were too big when he tried them on (no, he didn’t watch Tony change, which evidently Tony found kind of odd, but he really didn’t want to risk anymore surprise boners). At first, when Steve changed, it was with hesitation, he swiftly realised there was no reason for that, until Tony stopped mid-sentence when Steve took his shirt off and fleeted to the bathroom. He wondered if he’d done something to make him uncomfortable.
-of an idea, which he imagined Tony would appreciate given his style and love for David Bowie. Tony probably wouldn’t listen to it anyway.
“No.” He admitted, sitting up in bed, it wouldn’t creak because the mattress was as hard as a rock. “Don’t you have that creative writing class Friday mornings?”
“I didn’t think anything could overwhelm you.” Steve realised how naïve he sounded, but it was true, he’d seen Natasha scream into a mic for an hour straight and then proceed to chug beer while Rhodey and Thor held her upside down, and return to her feet as if it was natural to her, wearing a cool smile and making men and women tear their hearts out.
Steve passed him a troubled and discontented look, silently asking for patience. Bucky just nodded, instead of apologising, not that he needed to.
Tony didn’t talk to Steve much as they were all settling in, but people got drunk very quickly and it was easy to see that Tony quickly drew into himself, clearly too cold in just a t-shirt and denim jacket, cooking a sausage over the fire for Bruce to try and sober him up. So after he managed to escape Bucky venting about Natasha yet again. (He’d just finished watching Bucky show him knife wounds in a tree that him and Natasha had made last time they were there). He took his place by him on a much too small log by the fire, Tony smiled up at him as he sat, one that was usually followed by a joke or sarcastic comment, but he just smiled, and waved the stick around which stabbed the sausage.
They were alike in that way, Tony and Natasha, wearing unreadable expressions as they both prepared for whatever was about to happen.
The boy that he was talking about was in fact the drummer, a pale looking brunet, his hair damp, matted and curled on his forehead and blank lining his big, wet, excitable eyes. The tank top he wore exposing his toned arms which glistened with sweat under the broken, dim yellow bar light.
“Okay, um. I’ll tell you what, give me your key, I’ll go grab it, we’ll meet at the station, okay?” Steve smiled, squeezing his shoulders.
Bucky slung his whole weight on Steve as he hugged him suddenly, shouting in his ear over Natasha’s belting and cramming his drink against his chest. “I LOVE YOU, STEVE!”
Yes, drawing and painting would be the solution. But that would be too easy, wouldn’t it? He drew Tony all the time, before he even knew him. Seeing something,
“Hm. This guy up here does really amazing pretzels. You want some? I’m gonna get some.”  His nose was a little red, his lips plump and a similar shade, what was the saying?
Maybe it would all go to shit, maybe Tony would blame him and still hate him regardless, but atleast he would know, right?
With that, Steve realised he’d had enough, and he wasn’t going to enjoy the music no matter how hard he tried and - trust him - he was trying.
“Well, first of all, trying to understand Tony in general will get you nowhere. And, over the past year or so, seeing the way they treat each other, I have come up with a theory of my own.”
“I know.” Sympathetically, he grazed his thumb against the edge of her wrist as he thought of what to say. But his clouded mind had its own thoughts. “It makes you wonder how you felt before you were… Overwhelmed. And whether you’ll ever go back to being that – that ignorant, that ignorant and free before you met – before it happened.”
“I could help you make it bigger if you want?” Steve offered, gently, for some reason provoking a small laugh from Tony. “What? Really, I’m quite handy.”
But Tony reached a point where the poignant, picture-perfect sketches of him began to slip, not in quality, just… Something else.
“Tonys dad is like a kajillionaire.” Natasha said to him, as if she was telling him something he didn’t know already.
Feeling awkward being the only person sitting down and having nothing to do with his hands but pick up his drink and put it back down again, Steve decided to root through his bag and pull out his sketchbook. Figuring that was less weird than sitting alone in an insanely crowded bar with live music.
Tony laughed, sounding more like a breath of relief than anything. “I’m starting to think you only got into college ‘cuz you’re pretty.”
Steve took a bite as they began their stroll. They were ‘good’ at best, but he didn’t have the heart to tell him that they weren’t the greatest thing he’d ever consumed or something. So he just nodded and smiled when Tony looked at him for a confirmation.
“Tadpoles. Lots of them.” Squatting by the water, wrapping an arm around his knees and pointing to faint black trickles in the water. He’d never have seen them if not for Tony. “I had to get away from everyone… Tadpoles do that too, sometimes they even eat each other.”
He returned to her, offering her yet another polite, normal smile. It was strange. He thought the next time he ran into Sharon he’d be filled with dread and self-loathing and spent the next few days after the interaction thinking about what a complete toolbelt he is but weirdly, it was refreshing. He wondered if she felt the same.
“…Were you hoping to go missing tonight? Because… Well, I gotta tell ya, I wouldn’t let that happen.”
There was a problem, right about now, however. And that was that, yes this video is hot, and kind of scary, it just wasn’t doing it for him in the way he thought it would.
’ Because really, you shouldn’t go through some strangers belongings just because you feel like it - But he was a cute boy, a really cute boy, Steve had never been so conflicted with himself in his life.
“I’m not even gonna pretend I know what that means.” He returned a smile as he followed Tony into his apartment - pondering how anyone could afford an apartment in Boston with no job considering they’d graduate from college soon, but then he remembered who Tony was, and how Ty might not have such a different background either.
“Well, I don’t know what a swamp goblin looks like. I doubt you look anything like a swamp goblin though. Why do you care, anyway? It’s only me.” He was scared to hear Tony’s answer as soon as he asked.
He went back to his apartment, empty, the brooch from his mother was still there in its box on the night table. It felt more barren than before somehow, although he hadn’t taken many of his belongings, maybe that was just the empty, sullen feeling in his stomach.
“Haaaaaaa. Dumbass. Alright, so, I think we should just stay under here and never show our faces to the world ever again. Sound good?”
One night, though, Tony was wearing glittery blue eyeshadow, and Steve didn’t know how to act. He wasn’t used to boys wearing makeup, or nail polish, except for pictures on the internet - and he could imagine how his peers would probably poke fun or be mean purely because they didn’t understand, even if that was the reason, he couldn’t stand ignorance and he couldn’t stand bullies, it’s just some paint and some glitter, right?
After the two hour set, which mostly involved Steve standing around awkwardly with the flowers and leaning against the wall, trying to enjoy the music, one song was basically the words ‘
Tony spoke with such certainty, that he could make people believe that he himself believed what he was saying, a casual saunter that always lingeried in his voice, careless and vaguely persuasive. A flicker of gold and red in his eyes as a police car passed down the street gave himself away.
“I think you should just do what makes you happy. If Ty makes you happy… then fine. But I don’t think he does. Oh – I’m sorry, it’s not my place.”
Tony just stared at it, the entire black denim length of it, so Steve waved it a little to imply it was for him.
Tony held a small black earbud between his chipped-nail-polished fingers, looking at the space between Steve’s eyes eagerly and uncertainly, most of his hair had either tangled or draped across his forehead, that, combined with his bare face and dark lashes made him look years younger, softer. Their faces had become very close and amongst his anxiety he worried he had morning breath, because Tony didn’t. “Got it caught in my head. And it’s probably time you start listening to something from this century anyway.”
“Who’s gonna hold my hair back when I’m throwing up now?” Bucky half smiled, standing up to walk over to his old friend.
“That’s pretty straight forward, I’m just thinking isn’t there any more practical way we can like... link togethe-“
It was a friend of a friend of a friend’s party, their team had just won some college basketball competition and decided to go all out. Steve didn’t really keep up with college sports lately besides football, mostly because he had to. He had too much to drink, that was for sure, trying to gain some courage so he could retain some dignity for when he saw Tony.
“Oh.” Plump lips forming an ‘o’ that sat there for slightly too long. “Uh, yeah, alright.” Tony sat up immediately, pulling the sleeves of his hoodie over his hands.
The table they were seated at was slightly too small, round, cheap and metal, they sat across from one another on equally uncomfortable plastic seats.
, you know? I think we were both just so focused on things that weren’t each other. It just wasn’t the right time. And that was part of your problem, you were  so focused on the past and trying to make things like they were that you didn’t think about what was happening in front of you. Me, I got too preoccupied with my studies, sometimes I think I should have let myself have more fun.” She sighed as if she had wanted to get that off of her chest for a while.
Silent. Steve was silent. Tony had told him practically everything he’d ever wanted to hear and he couldn’t utter a word, just staring at him wide eyed listening to the rapid beating of his and his own heart.
“She was very nice, still didn’t make it any less unbearably awkward. But don’t worry I’ll do you a favour so you can hook up with a girl, again.”
Natasha fed him back a similar look, except Ty turned to Steve. Maybe he was trying to be intimidating, but he’d dealt with his fair share of obnoxious rich boys who think that their elite martial arts classes make them a fearful competitor and that they’re not hiding behind daddy’s plastic.
“Oh – I’m sorry.” Steve said out of habit, feeling drunker than he thought he was and stuck in the crack of the door wondering whether it was okay to stay or to go.
He had that smug look on his face he always did, no, of course that hadn’t changed. Steve knew what he was trying to do, and he wouldn’t but into it. No matter how much the words stung.
“Sure, we’re good, Steve.” He stood up and began walking over to him, if Bucky were someone else, Steve would’ve thought he was about to punch him in the face, not like he didn’t deserve it. “Glad I don’t have to kick your ass.”
Tony shuffled a little bit more, glancing down at Steves lips a little shyly before letting his forehead fall on Steves.
Their feet danced around each other tentatively, like they were scared to separate for even a second. Steve looked back as he headed towards Tony’s apartment, and Tony looked back too. God, he could’ve flown to Tony’s apartment at this rate.
“Mmh? Sorry, what?” Steve lifted his head up from his notebook which had become an impromptu sketchpad for which he was doodling… something with his ball point pen. Historians and Psychologists might look back at it and recognise it as his gradual slip into insanity caused by an angsty college senior.
“Ah! No backsies, mister, why, you scared?” He mimicked childishly and ripped his shirt off over his head, dropping it the ground with ease. Steve tried not to look, although his already hard pink nipples were eye level.
There was a high in the air when the couple of them arrived back to Tony’s apartment, dancing through the streets hand in hand, it felt impossibly magical.  There was something undeniably beautiful about watching Tony unwind when he was away from everyone else, and Steve must have accidentally thought out loud because Tony was looking at him with a crooked grin while his jeans were halfway down his knees.
Tony began to beam at him with the most wild and wicked grin, and kissed him to make him believe that it was all possible, and it was.
“What’s not to get. He bailed. He obviously wanted to for a long time. Guess this just gave him a good escape route.” Tony sighed, sitting down at the table next to Steve’s friend.
“That was just a favour. I’m going now. Go to class.” Pressing his foot down on the wheels of his friends chair gently, pushing him an inch in jest, a soft and reluctant smile on his face.
“I guess you’re just as fucked then, Van Gogh.” Tilting his head up towards Steve and the night sky after he spoke, letting the cigarette fizzle down to his lips.
Steve groaned, rolling over so that his back was to them both. Morning wood, that was all it was. And what a yet again delightful morning it was turning out to be.
“Listen and see.” Flinging the earbud directly onto the tip of Steve’s nose and giving him ever so slight whiplash, his tiredness didn’t make it any less unsatisfying, scrunching up his face and trying not to look too seriously back at Tony.
He found Bucky, Clint, Thor and Bruce at the opposite end of the ‘stage’, because he had no need to be alone at the back of the bar sketching to avoid looking awkward anymore. They drunkenly welcomed him into the huddle with open arms, Thor was banging his head to the music, already way past the limit – his golden hair swinging around. No matter how much Steve tried to express his ‘alternative’ side he’d probably never be able to do that. But he’d be lying if he didn’t let his body move a little to the music, he doubted anybody was watching him.
The brunets smile softened, just for a moment, but Steve caught it, until it soured again, as he nodded at Steve and walked back towards the now lonely corner of the bar where he’d first set eyes on him.
The abrupt sound of Tonys chair scraping back definitely had the most effect. Passing by his partner as if he were a ghost.
’ look, if only he knew that Steve wasn’t worried about talking to this girl despite how pretty she was.
Apparently he spaced out more than he thought he did, because Tony and the rest of the band had left the stage and found them
He wondered if he was being creepy, he wasn’t too different to a fan really was he? Or a groupie? He wouldn’t mind being a groupie, maybe that would suit him. Probably not, not if it was like that Ty he met, he didn’t like him at all, something about him raised a bunch of red and blue and yellow flags for him.
“I don’t get what’s been going on with you lately Steve.” Bucky huffed. “I thought you were into Tony.”
“I’m really sorry, Tony, for all of it. I feel like, I could have kept it to myself and nothing would be different from now. I thought I owed it to you, the truth, but nothing’s changed and I- “
“Get away with this motherfucker!” Tony leapt up, jumping as much as he could, wrapping his gangly arms around Steve’s neck and pulling him down into the water with him.
“Maybe, but atleast you’re smiling and you ain’t got black lines all down your face.” Steve smiled back, gesturing to Tonys eyes.
It wasn’t insensitive, maybe he had a habit of saying things he shouldn’t, annoying or repulsing people until they left him alone. That was his game all along but Steve wouldn’t buy into it.
He smiled ever so slightly as Bucky reached out for a handshake which turned into an eventual awkward half-sitting-half-standing hug, patting each other on the back firmly. They didn’t often hug, but it wasn’t foreign to them, at this point, they were more like family than friends.
And then Tony turned around and ran in the other direction, he gave him whiplash as he took off so suddenly, ripping the air or any possibility of a word from his mouth.
The end of the hallway didn’t blank out the noise, but definitely quietened it. There was not in fact a line for the bathroom, but the short white wooden door was shut, so he assumed that someone was inside.
But one over-grown, beefed up college boy sharing a rough twin-sized bed with an average college boy when neither of them are blacked out drunk proved to be a completely different challenge on its own. Awkwardness aside.
A thump on the ridge of his back turned into a wave of freezing water slapping him in the face, and engulfing him in an instant.
“I guess, we are a lot alike in some ways. But unlike Ty I’ve grown to have... unparalleled self restraint.”
“Alright. Hooo, okay.” Tony swallowed so hard that Steve could hear, the embers in the fire quietened, the wildlife and the wind silenced just for them as they sat closely with their heads tight together. Steve listened, thinking that he didn’t appreciate how lovely Tony looked up close the last time they did this.
“We can trade if you want. I got this JD and coke because I thought it would make me look more... sophisticated? But i hate it.”
He thought bitterly, but decided not to say anything out loud, Ty taking the bag from Steve with as much passive aggressiveness that Steve had when he held
’ over and over again, Natasha progressively shouting louder, Steve saw everyone in the room fill out as usual, the band chattering amongst themselves and then to others - he had a sudden thought:
If he wasn’t ready to put any strings or labels on what they had. Then that was fine. Steve had all the time in the palm of his hand.
It wasn’t that Steve didn’t like going out or he didn’t have a particular fondness for large, aggressive crowds or that he didn’t like the ambience of the bar, you know, who cares if he may get stabbed at any moment? No, it wasn’t any of that, he just didn’t want to go out that night, and he didn’t like the music, and he didn’t like how that boy on the drums made him feel.
Steve didn’t realise he had teared up until he saw Bucky’s eyes in the same state once they pulled apart.
Steve had unwillingly stood up off of Tony’s bed and looked around the floor for his jacket, only to feel hot thin fingers around his wrist. Tony’s chin tilted up towards him, his dark and lovely eyes consuming all of Steve that was in front of him.
Steve spent a little extra time drinking his coffee to stall the answer to that question – only for it to be knocked away from his mouth, getting froth all over his top lip as something came crashing down on his shoulders.
Oh, how he missed that control too. How he never realised how much he needed to hear the words coming out of someone else’s mouth to realise he wasn’t crazy.
“Oh. Um.” Then he caught Steves gaze for the first time, he’d never really looked at him before, always past him. “Thank you?”
He started with his sweater, and then realised he should have probably started with his shoes like Tony did, removing his socks at the same time because he did not have the advantage of a smooth floor like Tony. Maybe a little too eagerly as Tony was watching did he remove his under t-shirt. There wasn’t really a sexy or alluring way to take off jeans, Tony somehow managed it, but he was Tony, Tony, who was looking back and forth rapidly at Steve shrugging the grey jeans off. Admittedly, he felt much less exposed as Tony was too, and glad he wore his good white Calvin’s that Sharon had bought him.
“Is he on that shit again?” He threw his apron off, slightly angry as he stepped out of the truck. A big woft of powdered sugar and cheese and onion followed him out, leaving the door wide open so the smell eventually diffused into the air.
“Why? Are you dating? Is it a secret? Are they not out yet? Oh, does he have a boyfriend? Or a girlfriend? Or both? Wa-“
“Hm. Okay. Firstly, this is a little unfair since I already said one, but since you’re a newbie, I’ll make it easy on you. I play the piano, too. Now you go.”
When he was with Sharon, she was so petite that when she stayed over it was like she was barely there in his arms anyway, and he’d gotten so used to her being there that eventually each night was the same, his fist curled in her hair or the palm of his hand held against the base of her neck. And then he’d gotten used to her not being there, and no one being there.
He muttered a curse to himself, and hoped it wasn’t too loud. This cursed boner wasn’t going anywhere anytime soon.
Steve was caught out, and wasn’t sure how to react. Run away? Cry? All plausible options but he liked to think he had at least a grain of dignity left.
“Party downtown. But it’s like an exclusive Tony Stark party, so you can’t come.” Bucky smiled, and patted Jake on the shoulder.
Then his hand was warm, looking to the source, he saw that Tonys bruised and calloused hand had encased his, wrapping his fingers around his fingers and squeezing gently.
Steve smiled at him, which led to a look of confusion on Tony’s face, so Steve kissed him, which only made his furrowed brow more severe. Only mere words could describe
He was so nice to look at like this. His fringe curled over his forehead, hair tangled by his cold red ears, lips and nose to match, swallowed in Steves jacket - smiling, dazzling and lovely smile. No audience, no shitty boyfriend, just the two of them. Where fragments of the real Tony could shine through and shards of Steves could crack and pierce through too.
But Tony didn’t see it that way, to him, Steve was just some guy who liked to draw and occasionally drew pictures of him and his friends in a completely non-obsessive, non-crushing way.
He was glad Tony didn’t let him answer, in a strange way, not glad Tony had so much control over him.
It didn’t feel good at all, it felt terrible, he almost second guessed even turning up so he wouldn’t have to face it but he didn’t want to be a coward. Especially not in the face of someone like Ty (who, by the way, didn’t turn up to the show).
Then he did. It was what he imagined battery acid tasted like. Not even that bad, just, sugar, lots of sugar.
to tell you this time? Some things are better left unsaid as they say…” As though Tony was speaking to himself rather than Steve, rationalising every factor and piece of information out loud as if there was too much going on in his head for it all to fit. “Okay. Fine. I think… That may be an alright idea.”
He smiled when Tony did, because that’s when he thought he’d be allowed, that he hadn’t said anything too inappropriate. It was taboo, wasn’t it, to announce in a room full of people to a stranger that you’re a recovering alcoholic, but Tony did, to him, and it was fine, nobody died, and Steve felt slightly honoured to know that about Tony. He also felt honoured that he’d been allowed to make Tony smile the way that he did.
“All this time I just – Fuck. Wanted… wanted to… You know.” Tonys eyes fell onto Steve’s lips, his leg tapping on the floor nervously. All it took was for Steve to tilt his chin up, and kiss him gently, for it all to stop. For it all to finally make sense.
“Tony you’re… You’re sure about this aren’t you?” Steve asked in a quiet voice from across the table.
No, he was up, clothed, a couple feet away from him by the lake that glittered in the daylight. All it took was him to hear Steve sit up, for him to start walking away.
“Exactly, nothing to be ashamed about pal.” Tony patted Steve on the back, and out of instinct, Steve immediately shrugged him away - for some reason it brought to his attention that it was the first time that Tony had explicitly touched him, he’d already gotten wind that he wasn't much of a hugger or generally overt in showing affection (not that he really paid that much attention but it always looked like Ty did all the touching during their usually scheduled acts of PDA) so it stood out to him more than it should, and it showed on Tonys face too. It also didn’t help that he’d rather not have any sort of conversation with him about boners and or if his works or not because, trust him, it did, especially with Tony in the equation but that for that he
Feeling a sudden burst of adrenaline and productivity from his and Bucky’s make-up session he decided not to lie on his bed listening to playlists he imagined Tony might make for him and feeling sorry for himself and clean his area of the room. Most of the time Steve operated like a soldier, making his bed every morning, not leaving a single crease on the bed or a sock on the floor, but his recent escapades had turned him into a bit of a slob.
That night, there was going to be a ‘battle of the bands’ type gig, mostly for small college groups, it wasn’t very competitive, the winner being based on how loud the applause and screaming and shouting was - the prize being a grouping for unlimited cocktails and breadsticks for life at a local Italian restaurant. Apparently most of them were just doing it for fun and publicity, apparently
Steve didn’t have to think. He knew what he’d do, because it was theirs. He leaned towards Tony, who was leaning towards him, as if to gently rest his forehead upon his.
Tony spun around, and allowed himself to fall onto the couch next to Steve, his arm and his thighs bumbling against his, and looking at him with a wide smile. Steve wondered what he was smiling at, half of him thought Tony was probably just taking pity on him, or making fun of him, but he was awfully close, too close, there was a lot of couch left.
“Steves idea.” Tony smirked. It was difficult to see the man on the ground, sat far away from any store or streetlamp, Tony seemed comfortable anyway in the dark.
Tony laughed harder, pointing his grin at Steve as he did. “I don’t think you actually realise how filthy you sound.”
“So, what does that make you then? Payback? Is that really what you want? To be a ploy in me and Ty’s fucked up little game?”
He could see the band through a gap in the crowd by the far wall, people blocked by some speakers and equipment he wanted to learn more about but most importantly - he had a generous albeit cut off view of Tony Stark that he hadn’t had before with the other members in front of him.
A chuckle came out of Steve as he ate. “I suppose I feel kind of better having robbed him now. We’re like a team, you and me. You’re the amazing, genius, pretzel cook and I’m the pretzel thief who, I don’t know, takes out all the competition.”
Tony looked up at him, those big glowing eyes seemed to burn into Steve’s skin even fiercer in the light, his smile which was a delight to see, he’d missed it.
“Why did you do that? You- you…” His troubled tone trailed out. His ears felt like they were ringing, the rest of the street and the cars and the distant drunk shouting fading into a incessant noise until –
A simple nod, when Rhodes pulled away. A shrug in his shoulders that caused Natasha to drop her hand.
like?” Steve replied, annoyance in his voice. Glancing at a couple of strangers who were talking by the stove, but he’d tuned out their conversation along with the music booming through the doors.
“Hey, that better be water brewski, I’m not hurlin’ you outta here like last time!” Bucky clicked his tongue into a smile back at Steve.
“Busy standing around eavesdropping? You’re turning out to be a lot nosier than I thought.” Raising an eyebrow, there was another crash coming from the living room, catching their attention at the same time. Too bad it wasn’t enough to distract Tony from how strange Steve looked then.
There wasn’t a particular reason Steve had never watched that kind of porn before, he was busy, he had a roommate, who was also his best friend, he also would not want to be caught watching big giant hairy dudes bone in the bed right next to him.
When they got back into the apartment, the laughter and the shouting was gone, the music must’ve been turned down but it filled out the room, just like the limp, passed out drunk bodies strewn across the apartment.
No, Steves eyes were bleeding out of his skull, like Tony was some cursed painting in a horror movie and Steve was the fool who’d unlocked all of his secrets, a fatal, flaming mistake.
“I think you’re supposed to wrap it around my shoulders, like in the movies?” A hint of a smile tugged at the corner of Tonys mouth, quirking as if he were forcing it away.
He tried to write. Firstly, a poem, because poems are the height of romance, right? On paper, too, so it would seem more genuine and thoughtful (plus he didn’t want to run the risk of Bucky opening a stupid love poem on his laptop). Turns out he was terrible, awful, in fact. Then he tried to write him a song, it made sense, Tony was into music, it was perfect. And as it turned out, writing song lyrics is much easier than poetry, you could use the same words over and over again, you didn’t have to worry about every minute period mark or paragraph.
“I hate that. I hate you.” Steve attempted to stutter back a response but was cut off by Tony’s hands waving in front of him, the sharpness in his fingers on the top of his tongue. “I hate that you do this to me. I hate tha- that you can just…”
Maybe this was exactly what he wanted, this would skip all the awkward phases and small talk and general social things that he was objectively terrible at.
Steve grew more and more fond of the idea of drinking until he couldn’t walk and flushing his head down the toilet, in either order. He laughed deprecatingly, without an inch of real joy.
Tony smiled, sitting up so he could throw an arm over Steve’s shoulder. “Nahhh I like my way more better.”
Tony was shivering, trying not to look Steve in the eye - he could’ve been more cold than anything, he was wearing ripped shorts and a ripped top.
) boogie in his room. Everything seemed fine, he was partying on his own, getting his life back together, he made up with his friend, he made his BED, it was fine, it was-
“This is why I didn’t want to talk inside! Look, you cannot tell Natasha, or anyone for that matter. He made it very clear that it was a one-time thing a-and he wasn’t interested in me in that way. That’s why I’ve been so weird. Ty can’t know. I don’t trust him, Buck, I don’t.”
Tony’s lips quivered, back and forth, Steve wasn’t sure what that meant and then – then he burst into laughter. Like – the hardest he’d ever seen Tony laugh before. He was wrenching over his gut with laughter, and Steve managed a few light chuckles to conceal his blush.
He swore he’d heard a song about this before, two people, at a party, a boy and a girl but that wasn’t important. Both of them had too much to say and no way to say it, internal regrets and unshared trauma, dancing around each other until one of them twirls into the arms of someone else and it’s too late.
“We?” Halting in his tracks, leaves of orange and brown swept around his ankles as he turned with the penultimate question. It was the first time he’d seen Tony hesitate, the boy with the quickest wit of them all.
“Shut up.” Tony replied with a teary-eyed grin. “You won me over the second I saw that stupid little notebook. I’m… I’m sorry I wasted so much time.” His fingers grazed through Steve’s overgrown hair, trying to get his senses used to the feeling.
“Guess we missed the party.” Tony hummed, stepping over Thor and Bruce as he made his way to the centre of the living room. “Ah. We didn’t play Twister.” Studying the box and shaking it as he picked it up from the coffee table, pushing aside empty cups and tissues and candy wrappers.
Learning that maybe Twister was better with more people, but still laughing along the way, winding their limbs around each other on the floor whilst the music strummed in the background, the only thing lighting their bodies was the TV, flashing above them.
“Wha -“ Tony scoffed, hitting Steves broad arm with his stale snack. “Wow, where’d this Steve Rogers come out from? A little rush of adrenaline and one petty crime later and now you’re
Tony paused for a moment that felt like a lifetime. Glossy eyes staring widely at Steve, so much doubt, so much pain.
“You- you are an a- an asshole!” Treading the water to stay warm beneath it, scorning a sour face up at him.
“I’m sorry about that.” Steve replied with a smile. “I wanted to speak with you about something, something I should’ve said a long time ago.”
“Oh yeah?” Steve laughed, briskly like the air cooling his cheeks and twirling into the trees. “And you would? Rich boy? I only followed you out here ‘cause I was scared you’d end up mauled by a bear or shot by a poacher or something. Maybe you’d get stabbed by Natasha and Bucky playing with knives.”
“Okay.” Tony blew out a breath, clearly trying not to make it obvious that he was cold, wrapping his arms around himself, shivering in his boxers. They were navy blue, and not very tight, surprisingly normal. “As much as I could really use your jacket as a blanket again, it’s your turn.”
Also, when he imagined Tony in his bed, Bucky wasn’t there in the other bed, drunkenly snoring into a lock of his own hair and soaking it in drool, and Tony wasn’t constantly checking his phone all night presumably for messages from Ty, the amount of sweat was somewhat accurate though.
He learnt about Tony’s relationship with his father. In the little that Tony told him the weight of his sunken eyes when he spoke told him all he needed to know. He also learnt about a man called Obadiah, a family friend who worked very closely with Howard Stark, he gave Tony money when he needed it after his dad cut him off. He didn’t say much else about it.
Tony looked as though saying it took every ounce of energy left in his body and every breath in his lungs. Admitting it, hard and almost triumphantly, too much so, that he couldn’t even bare to look at Steve.
More people had shown up to the bar then expected. Steve invited some people from college, some from his dorm, Tony invited people who invited other people which was also the same for every other member of the band.
A breath of laughter before Steve debated whether to move in first. Initial tenseness with each inch they became closer.
“No, Tony.” Steve answered firmly. “But that wasn’t that, was it? I know it wasn’t, so… It was something… something else. Right?”
hello everyone! Finally decided this work will be 5 chapters, 4th will be the final concluding chapter and the 5th an epilogue of sorts. Thank you for reading, leaving comments/kudos etc again really means a lot to me and encourages me to keep writing! hope u all enjoy <3
“What and he- he hasn’t done the same to you? Over and over again? You’d rather be the person who just shuts up and takes it?”
When Tony came back from the kitchen, Steve had expected something strong that probably tasted awful, just based off of the stories. Steve had found himself a spare chair next to ‘Bruce’ although he hadn’t said a word to him the entire time just as Tony said, but, to be fair, Steve hadn’t tried to converse with him, or anyone else sat around the living room drinking and chatting and showing each other things on their phones.
He stood up to greet Steve, and like Tony said, he was the only one there who was probably taller than him, hair flowing past his shoulders like those performers who grow their hair out so they can flip it back and forth on stage to metal music - maybe that was the intention, he didn’t know.
“You got – you got some mascara on your…” Then Tony’s thumb was on his lip, maybe he should have put chapstick on,
“I… I can’t answer that without digging myself into a very deep, dark hole that I’m afraid I won’t be able to get out of.”
Tony smiled. And Steve smiled back. It felt as though everything Steve had ever imagined was beautiful in the universe had landed at his feet, and it was overwhelming, and amazing. And he’d never wanted the future more.
“Wha- “ His friend looked up from the book, pinning it the table with his fist so it wouldn’t curl over. “No, idiot, to the cook-out. Nat made sure it was a strict no-boyfriends, no-girlfriends event which, I guess explicitly bans he-who-shall-not-be-named. And until I officially ask Natasha to be my girlfriend, I am allowed to come.”
He couldn’t sleep. He couldn’t avoid him, even if he wanted to because Bucky wanted to see Natasha. The job he’d gotten at the bar the band usually played at, called The Great White Shark (Tony called it ‘Sharkys’ for short) also didn’t help, he blamed his subconscious for wanting to have a valid reason to see Tony. Sometimes when he thought about Tony he wanted to vomit and then Tony would text him some stupid picture of a frog with no context and he would want nothing more than to go see him on stage.
“Yeah, you sure look real busy.” Bucky said in an exaggerated tone as he looked over his shoulder at the mostly empty bar. He’d come to visit Steve at work one Tuesday, and it turned out to be a quiet place to study where it was acceptable to drink while you were doing it. Although he wasn’t really supposed to talk to customers for hours on end, on nights like this it was alright, there was only really regulars that he was beginning to know, and they sat at booths rather than the bar because they’d rather be alone. One was an older Dutch woman who was always dressed in cardigans and reading funny pages in the newspaper (he slapped himself on the wrist for thinking they weren’t even a thing anymore).
The words Steve dreaded came out and provoked an annoyed sigh, seeming to surprise Bucky by his expression. Steve usually gave out favours like cheap hard candy but the underlying problem was: he wanted to see Tony so bad that the thought of actually seeing Tony made him want to vomit.
“What is it then?” The curly haired blond crossed his arms over his naked chest, gesturing towards Steves bag as he cautiously walked back over to him.
“You… You wouldn’t be able to make out there on your own, that’s all.” Crossing his arms in response to Steve shoving his hands into his pockets.
But when he played he smashed with a newfound fire in himself, like he could bang up enough friction from the sticks and the rubber and the metal and his fingers that he could spark a flame and encase the entire theatre in his own internal rage. Everyone in the room was burning to death except for him, him and Tony.
“Yeah.” Tony spoke quickly, not to the aid of the croak in his throat, an obvious sign of smoking and sleep deprivation. “Yeah, um. Just realised I probably look like a swamp goblin.”
Tony had stopped in front of the food truck, that only sold pretzels and churros (but they were out). Pretzels weren’t really something he’d go for if he wanted a late night snack, neither did anyone but Tony apparently, because there was nobody lining up for a salty pretzel in a dodgy neighbourhood at 11:32pm.
“I don’t think there’s any point trying to look sophisticated if you’re drinking out of a paper cup. But okay, sure.”
Steve kissed him, to let him know that it was okay. And even Tony could ignore the jokey grossed out noises from his friends as he looked back up at him with a sparkle of yellow and orange in his eye.
“Yeah, I just want the timing to be right. I don’t want to screw it up with her, I’ve never been in a serious relationship and neither has she, just don’t wanna scare her away.” The anxiety from the sudden conversation prompted Bucky to tie his hair back into a bun, as if he was getting ready for something strenuous. Steve just sat, and listened.
There was this adult version of ‘Pictionary’ called ‘Dick-tionary’ that he didn’t partake in because he didn’t know them well enough to be drawing various sex positions on a tiny whiteboard - despite Tonys begging, which filled him with warmth, and nervousness, his small voice pleading
People on the sidewalk cleared a path for them, as sparse as they were that time of night, drunk and shouting and pushing around as he teared down the concrete, Tony like a firefly in a field he was trying to catch, not knowing where to go in the open nothingness.
for me, so.” Even Tony seemed to notice it. “But… Um… I wouldn’t say no to the movies or, whatever.”
that made Steve realise that Tony was really doing this, in front of everyone, this was his statement to him. His acceptance.
Turning away from each other and toward the door, to see Tony slugging a nearly passed out Bruce under his arm.
Steve scanned his face to try and see whether he was joking or not. He couldn’t be serious, surely not. He had friends, his own band, college, he couldn’t just suddenly get up and leave like Steve had dreamed about all this time. Not that he wasn’t grateful, but he always imagined he was destined for more than this, and with Tony by his side, well, he would be complete.
“Nah.” Bucky said after a long and thoughtful sigh. “You’re alright. Maybe this was the wake up call I needed. Well, you could’ve taught me my lesson using different methods but – yeah. It’s cool.”
Steve’s head shot up when Bucky scoffed in response. “Steve, I live with you. I have to see your sad face and your depressing little drawings every single day.
Steve managed to pull some of the sheet out of his grasp, and pull it over his own head as well, joining Tony in his strange and sudden little cave.
Steve, in synchronised response, gathered Tony up into his lap so that he could never get away from him, protective hands on his hips that slid up and down his back, drawing him in nearer as their mouths grew hotter, wetter, closer.
Bucky nodded and looked away, Steve, searching his face for a reaction, forgiveness, anything, at this point.
Tearing the headphone jack out and playing some music from his phone, vowing to try and get him out of this Tony shaped hole he’d dug himself into.
Tonys palm opened out for him, a faint scar etched diagonally into his palm, he wouldn’t allow Steve to have a very good look at it, balling his hand up into a closeted and tight fist again.
There was only the band members Steve had met that night, plus two others he hadn’t seen before, admittedly he’d expected a bigger party. Perhaps this was an exclusive thing, an intimate gathering of friends.
Tony looked at him as if to say, ‘you pulled away, you’re lying.’ So he gave in, with a huff, resting his head gently back on Tonys, for some reason it had quickly become to feel so normal.
Stark squinted, his plump pink lips pursed together, looking up at Steve interrogatively - his mind went blank, trying to think of what to say because
He didn’t know why, and he didn’t know what encapsulated him to follow Tony into the woods. A part of him knew that Tony wanted him to and didn’t want him to at once. Aside that, he couldn’t stop himself, crossing through the camp, and the noise, into the silent darkness where Tony disappeared.
The band was set up, they were ready to go. And then the worst, most sickening thing happened, something so quaint that would somehow haunt him.
Still, the times he was with Tony, when the third party would go to the bathroom or get a drink, a new and unsteady friction had clouded the air, as if the presence of another person was just what both of them needed to get in the way of it.
“No.” Tony replied, with complete certainty. “I don’t think he’d very much like me anyway. Hasn’t exactly done me any favours. Hello Brian.”
Steve laughed. “Well this is all hypothetical right? I can hypothetically want to visit wherever I want.”
The simplest of questions that up until recently had no answer. And it was asked as if he wanted advice, an example, because he’d never truly known it before. Tony sat, waiting for an answer that Steve couldn’t give, and so he just sat there, beside him, looking at his plump red lips and pink cheeks, trying to stop his mouth from saying:
Stirred by a muffled shuffling sound, he woke up to a bright sun beaming down on him, the fire turned to ash and rubble, a charred stain in the dirt where it once burned on. The night before didn’t seem real, like it must have been a dream. Sleeping with Tony, the things they did… It was disturbingly fresh in his memory and yet Tony wasn’t there beside him like he was when he fell asleep.
When Tony finally did text him, it wasn’t anything less than what he might’ve expected. But it filled him with excitement nonetheless.
The sounds he heard as he stepped down the corridor towards Tony and Tys apartment were... very different and much worse.
And before they’d realised it, they’d spent almost an hour fooling around in the secluded pond. Shouting and cursing as they splashed one an another, wrestling like boys with Tony jumping on Steve’s broad back and Steve picking Tony up in his hulking arms just to drop him into the freezing depths.
Tony looked as surprised as Ty did when he lifted him off the couch with ease, gentle, but heavy handed enough that he could let him lean against his side and guide him at once - Tony let him go, smiling gently at Steve.
Steve was already warm inside. “What’s different? I’m asking because, if I know, then I can keep maintaining whatever it is that makes you feel that way, and… Yeah.”
Steve swallowed tight before he began, it hurt, like the words were reluctant to come out after all this time of pushing them away. But he was ready now to bare any pain he would come across.
