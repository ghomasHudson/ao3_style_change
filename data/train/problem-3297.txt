Dean opens his eyes because he can’t stand not looking at Cas any longer. Cas is staring at him, intense and hungry, and that’s when Dean comes.
Cas smiles back at him. He closes his eyes and then when he opens them six great wings unfurl from his back.
Dean can’t stop the rocking of his hips, pressing his ass into Cas’ tongue, trying to rock his hips forward into some kind of friction on his cock. But there’s none to be found, just the sheets, already sticky and clinging, unsatisfying even at this level of arousal.
Cas rolls them over so he’s on top of Dean again. “Yes,” he says. “I wish…” He pauses. Purses his lips. “I have had fantasies,” he begins again. “About you. Without your permission. I apologize.”
Usually, Dean can handle this. He’s friendly, but he’s uninterested. This time, Aaron makes him think of Benny, and of Cas, and Dean gets tongue-tied, starts stumbling over his words and into tables. It’s stupid. Aaron isn’t even Dean’s
Dean doesn't think he's ever felt as happy and free as he does walking into the piercing parlor with Cas at his side. He probably approaches the counter with a ridiculous amount of enthusiasm, but the kid behind the counter just smiles at him. "I want to get my ear pierced," Dean announces.
“But I want to touch you,” Cas says. “I want to feel you, kiss you. I want to…indulge in your body, if I may.” Cas actually looks like he’s blushing, but he doesn’t look away. “However, if that would not be pleasurable for you, I understand.”
Dean brushes it off. He and Cas have always been like that. They’ve always been intense, with their “profound bond” or whatever it is. Cas in an angel, he doesn’t understand human social norms, and, well, Dean is just used to it by now. Used to feeling the heat of Cas’ body, his breath, sometimes, ghosting across Dean’s face, used to the hand on his shoulder. He’s corrected Cas before, but it never really took, so why keep trying? It’s not like Dean hates having Cas so close.
Cas smiles at him, indulgent and fond. “It has,” he says. “Come on,” he says, taking Dean’s hand and starting to walk.
And then Cas is back but he’s...different. One moment he’s very much the same, rumpled and bedraggled the way Dean had last seen him. “Dirty,” Cas had said, quiet and upset, and it had made Dean’s heart ache. But then the next he’s staring off into space, blanking out, and he’s never done that before, not ever, not even when he was tuned into angel radio all the time, not even when he was working with Crowley. Dean doesn’t know what to make of it.
Dean knows it isn’t Cas, that something else is controlling him, because even though Cas had betrayed them, it had never been like this between them. Cas has always been intense, righteous even when he’s wrong, he’s always looked at Dean like he was staring at Dean’s soul, and hell, maybe he was.
Dean doesn’t deserve it. He knows he doesn’t. He’s just…a human. A fuck up. Daddy’s blunt little instrument, and he hadn’t even been good at that. He’d fucked up so many times, at everything, at keeping Sammy safe, at keeping the world safe, at keeping Cas safe. He can hear the echo of his own voice, cruel and harsh, sending Cas away, snapping at him, yelling at him.
Cas has never looked at Dean like this. Not even when they were making deals in the salvage yard, not even when Cas had forgotten Dean, just as he’d forgotten himself, not even when Cas had gone mad with power, had he looked at Dean with such...cold derision in his eyes.
“Good, Dean,” Cas praises, and then he pulls out farther, and this time, when he slides in, he changes the angle just enough to fuck right up against Dean’s prostate.
Cas pets through the back of Dean’s hair. It’s nice, and Dean feels himself relaxing into the sensation, floating somewhere between wakefulness and sleep.
“Dean, Dean, Dean,” Cas chants, like a prayer, like a benediction. The world shimmers around him, a blue-yellow glow. “Close your eyes!” he gasps, tugging Dean’s face into his shoulder by his hair.
"Industrials are great,” the girl says, "but a bit intense for a first piercing. It goes through cartilage, which is tougher than the lobe. It hurts more, and it's a longer healing process."
It should feel silly, walking in nothing, holding Cas’ hand like their children. But Dean’s heart pounds with how much he likes it.
His voice is low, rumbly, but right in Dean’s ear he feels it in his core. “Like mine?” he asks, tilting his head back for Cas. “You wanna match?”
Dean tilts his head into Cas’ soft hair and breathes. This close, Cas smells a bit different too than humans, that same kind of bright electricity clinging to his skin, his hair, as Dean breathes him in.
Cas is looking at him, a little frown between his eyes. “It was an invasion of your privacy,” he says. “I should not have taken liberties with my perception of you.”
Dean yelps and can’t help bucking into Cas’ throat. It doesn’t seem to matter though, because Cas has apparently decided that what he wants is to go straight to deep throating.
At the end of day he met up with Dean, who was still talking with the trench coat guy, by the Impala. He hadn't seen Gabe since lunch and had forgotten to get the boy's number.
There was Dean in all his glory, in his element. He had a golden jacket and held a brightly-coloured guitar in his hands. Cas couldn't help but smile and Jo caught his eye and smirked towards her teacher. Suddenly, Dean walked his way over to a piano and began to speak.
“Um, I was thinking about what’s going to happen if you and Sam die, where I’ll go and-” Cas broke off, his voice becoming overrun by sobbs.
Once he got in, Cas slid in beside him. This surprised Dean for a minute but then Cas shuffled closer to him and pulled his head towards his lap. Dean happily rested his head and Cas’ lap and closed his eyes as Cas began to comb his fingers through his hair.
"Now I can't promise you that that means that all your days are gonna be great now, but I'll try and help make the shit days less shit; even if I can't that's okay and we'll just try again tomorrow."  And with that Dean climbed into the bed next to Cas and gathered him up close to his chest.
Slowly, so he could move away if he wanted, Dean moved a hand towards Cas' cheek and began to stroke it slowly.
"Sasquatch!" Gabriel shouted as he got closer to the car. "I thought I wasn't going to see you until tomorrow
Cas sat in his class watching his students, who all look extremely bored. It wasn't usually like this, but it was the last week before Summer and nobody could be bothered to actually do anything. Cas felt the same, currently he was missing his boyfriend, the famous Dean Winchester, who was on tour for next 2 months. They had been dating for 3 years now, but Dean had not yet told the public that he was Bisexual and Cas really didn't want to push him; but part of him wished he could express his support and love for his boyfriend in a more public way.
“Dean, you look dead on your feet.” came the deep voice which belonged to the comforting hand on his shoulder.
"Come on Azazel, the little shit ain't worth it." Casting one more glare at both Sam and the boy on the floor, the bullies walked away.
"Cas? You in here?" As Dean spoke a bright crack of lightning lit up the room, followed by the booming thunder causing Cas to whimper and curl in on himself.
"Of course Samsquatch. I was hoping you'd ask," Gabe removed a piece of paper with his number and gave it to Sam with a smile, before grabbing Cas by the arm and dragging his brother towards their car.
Shit here we go. Gabe turned around, smiling despite the fact he desperately wanted to run as far as he could.
"Hey, uh I would like to tell you guys something," Dean sounded nervous as he scratched the back of his neck. "I've been seeing someone and he is the best thing that has ever happened to me."
"Pfft, me, gorgeous? You're the hottest boyfriend I've ever had!" Replied Gabe, looking at the other with big, round eyes.
They stayed there for a few minutes, as Gabriel slowly stopped crying. Eventually, Gabe pulled away and wiped his eyes.
By the end of class, Gabriel was visibly buzzing and had made several funny contributions to class. Once the teacher had finished talking, Sam turned to Gabriel and asked if he was okay.
Dean's beautiful voice filled the stadium, Cas absolutely loved when Dean truly sang with his emotions.
In this universe, they don't know each other. Dean simply bumps into the shoulder of someone on the crowded streets. As the man turns back to look at Dean, the latter is struck by the others ocean eyes. They stop and stare at each other for a while, before being swept away from each other by the crowds. Dean often wonders what 'blue eyes' is doing.
Shakily, he began to walk towards the kitchen. He knew someone had to be in there. Reaching the kitchen, he could hear someone singing; he knew it was Dean. He could help him, he’d tell him what was wrong.
His voice began to swell, much like Cas' heart in his chest. He would probably end up crying in front of his class, but at the moment he really didn't care.
I'm currently waiting for the rest of my physic's work which I don't particularly want to do. Thank you for all the positive comments though, I appreciate it and it makes me smile. If anyone has any prompts they want me to write for Destiel or Sabriel, please tell me; but I don't write smut.
Cas placed his broken human into the bed and immediately felt guilty. He too felt empty at the death of the younger Winchester, that was his best friend. Also, he had never told Dean this but Sam had made him promise a couple of weeks ago to not let Dean bring him back if he ever died again because Cas was the only one Dean would listen to.
So when he entered their room to find Cas curled up on their bed crying, he was both heart-broken (cause of course he didn't want Cas to feel upset) and a little relieved that he could have a cry. Carefully, he made his way towards the bed and crouched down at the side of it, to become level with Cas' face.
So he tucked his phone in his pocket and hoped for the best—really, that was all you could do when trying to talk to a really hot person.
Cas swiped the thermos of coffee off his desk before walking to the door. Stepping into the hallway, he wove through the sea of hungry, hormonal teens to get to Dean's classroom across the hall. He flippantly wondered what his best friend made them for lunch today.
The Twilight Zone episode mentioned is episode 34 of season 1, The After Hours. It's one of my favorites. If you guys have any favorites, please comment them! And, as always, I'd be delighted to hear what you think of this chapter!
One night, woken by a night terror, Dean ran into Cas in the bunker's kitchen. Cas had been occupying his time by listening to the mixtape on an old walkman. They fell into a thoughtful conversation about music and somehow a song from Dean's childhood was brought up. Dean mentioned that his mother used to sing
No one raised their hand; most of them looked like they just wanted to get this over with and head to lunch. Dean could sympathize.
"Shut up, you assbutt." And Cas can't find it in his heart to complain when Dean drags him into another kiss. He could get used to this.
Jimmy—God, why did that name feel so wrong—seemed to shake himself out of blankly staring at Dean. "Yes. I remember you from the other day. At the grocery store."
, I thought he was your study date," he let out a low groan and scrubbed a hand over his face, "Y'know how you were always tutoring kids. God, I'm
Cas cocoons himself further into the nest, surrounding himself with Dean's scent. It's easier to quell the ache within himself that way.
"Would you mind making room for me?" Cas motioned to the sofa, where Dean was occupying an unnecessary amount of space.
He leapt out of bed, stumbling as he pulled on the nearest, most likely dirty, pair of jeans. His stats class had an early exam that he could not miss. And he was gonna miss it because he slept in.
"What are we having for dinner?" Cas asked as he set his bag on the coffee table. He wanted to get most of his students' work graded so he could enjoy the weekend. He pulled out third period's folder, a pen, and his trusty reading glasses.
"You should probably think this over some more. Think about your past experiences with women…and with men. Think about how the label feels. Think about if you even
"Nothing has fundamentally changed. You're the same exact person, just with some new realizations about yourself you'd like to share." Cas walked up behind Dean and placed his hands on his boyfriend's shoulders.
Dean shut off his phone and put it back on the nightstand. He pulled his covers up and, to no avail, tried to stop overthinking his identity. He supposed he could ask Cas about it, but it just felt too personal. Not that it was too personal of a thing to talk to Cas about, God no, just that it would be more
Listening to music as a human was an entirely different experience than as an angel. Sure as an angel you could appreciate all of the melodies and see the beauty in the art form, but as a human… as a human you could
. The guy only posted on Thursdays—hence the name, Dean guessed—so when there wasn't a new video, Dean just watched an older one.
It should've been a sign that yesterday, his inner Alpha raged at the mere thought of leaving Dean that morning. But it didn't alert him. His instincts were always quite... loud when it came to his Omega best friend, Dean.
He's led backwards to the mattress and pushed down to the pillowy, soft surface. Dean's off of him in a second, tucking him under the blankets. He isn't given any time to protest. But. Wait. Cas doesn't have any blankets with cowboy boots on them. These are
Dean lied awake in bed. He loved Cas, he really did...but he hadn't taken the time to think about what that said about him. About his sexuality. He hadn't
Dean nodded. Castiel could tell that it was a lot to take in. His next question surprised Cas though. “Do you even like Zeppelin?”
“Of course, Dean. I would never lie to you about that.” Cas scooted towards Dean, just to try to convey how sincere he was. It almost hurt that Dean would even
"The gay gods are pissing themselves laughing watching me run away from hot men like a blushing schoolgirl."
Disgruntled and bleary-eyed, he shuffled into the kitchen. Knowing full well that Cas wouldn't be up until an hour or two passed, Dean brewed a fresh pot of coffee.
"You've gotta be kidding me." Dean stared at the heating unit that did jack shit the harder he pressed the buttons. He knew rent was pretty cheap and it was a shitty part of town, but c'mon. A functioning heater was practically a necessity in Kansas' winter.
Dean downed the rest of his coffee and set the cup in the sink with a clatter. He'd deal with it later. For now, he had a hot date with Vonnegut.
And times like these made Dean wonder what life would have been like if he'd applied for college at MIT and made it in like Charlie.
“Hey Cas.” He took a second to observe Castiel flipping through an aged journal. Sam's eyebrows brows furrowed and he set his water bottle on the table. “What's up? Found a new case?”
Before Cas could respond to the (rhetorical) question, Dean swiped up his coffee and shuffled out of the room.
But yesterday, he nearly let an unhappy rumble out of his chest when he had to leave for work. Dean waved goodbye, a spatula in his hand and a carefree grin on his face. And Cas was a stick in the mud for a moment, warring with his conflicting feelings. He had to go to work. He had to make money mentoring the younger generation—only half of their rent would get paid otherwise.
by the Beatles to help him fall asleep. With a quick Google search, Cas found the song and hit play. He thought it was quite enjoyable. There weren't many harmonies, but the mellow melody accompanied by the piano and drum set made it one of the more pleasant songs he'd heard. He found that he almost favored it to
I don't think you realize how much material you've given me. I have enough information to tease you for the next few years XD
Castiel has never had a nest. Once, out of desperation during his college days, he attempted to make one. It was pitiful. He had gathered soft belongings of his family members, along with his own blankets and pillows, and tried to arrange them in an appealing manner. It looked horrid. And to make matters worse, his brother Gabriel and his appalling lack of boundaries walked into the room. Cas had broken down then, crying and spilling all his insecurities. An Omega would never nest for him because he was a broken Alpha. Gabriel's attempts at consoling him were, though sweet, useless and humiliating.
The Men of Letters bunker had a room for showering not unlike one you'd find at a swim meet or high school locker room. One wall was lined with shower heads, separated by tiled dividers; creating a stall. The water pressure was magical (no
This chapter has the vaguest mention of pornography and sexual acts. It's really not graphic at all and I consider it well within the ranges of the Teen rating. Just wanted to warn anyone in advance.
"You okay there, buddy?" Dean's voice is pitched low and soft. Almost placating. And then his hand comes in contact with Cas' forehead.
Once, Cas tried to make something other than pb&j's, which resulted in burnt pasta—yes you heard that correctly. How Cas managed to burn the pasta was still a mystery to Dean, but from then on they agreed to let the Winchester do all the cooking.
"Hi." Shut up shut up shut up shut up, he thought. Dean cleared his throat and pointed at the avocados. "Just wanted to tell you that all the avocados are either wayyy too green or so old that they're mush. Trust me, I spent a while digging." He laughed compulsively and hoped he didn't come off as psychotic.
, did it help. With a little help from a YouTube video he could finally manage more than two hours of sleep.
The kiss slows to gentle lips against lips when Cas pulls away. He breathes heavily, resting his forehead on Dean's. "You really want that? For me to claim you?"
God, he really shouldn't be thinking about this right now—with Cas literally within reach and Charlie chattering away in the backseat.
"Relax, Dean. I already asked her father for her hand in marriage last week and I'm telling mom and dad tomorrow, at the family dinner. I wanted to tell you first though."
"Gimme a sec, Cas; I forgot to send in attendance." Dean tapped a few buttons before closing the laptop. He slid open a drawer and pulled out two brown paper sacs. Lunches in hand, Dean headed over to his friend with a smirk and a gleam in his eye. They walked down the hallway side-by-side. A few students loitered the halls, chatting amongst their small friend groups as they munched on chips and other snacks.
Books referenced are "Once Upon a Dream: A Twisted Tale" by Liz Braswell and "Harry Potter and the Cused Child" by J.K. Rowling, Jack Thorne, and John Tiffany.
"Bye, guys." With one last check to see that he had his keys and phone, Dean locked the door behind him and headed to the Roadhouse.
sorry. Please forgive me. That was- I'm sorry. Fuck." He squeezes his eyes closed and prays Dean doesn't hate him.
With a huff, Dean leaned his head on the passenger door and watched the blurs of city landscape pass by. He resolved to ponder the subject at a more suitable time; preferably alone in the comfort of his bedroom.
“Don't mention it.” He got up from his seat, grabbing his water bottle, and patted Cas’ shoulder as he passed. When he was just stepping into the map room, Sam turned around and said, “Oh, and Cas?”
, the whole fucking place was powered by magic). The only downside was the lack of shower curtains. For that reason, the brothers were very vocal about when they planned on taking a shower. Sam walked in on Dean's naked ass once, and ever since then they'd adopted the unspoken rule.
Cas peers out of his mound of blankets as Dean approaches him slowly, like he's seen people approach lions on the Discovery Channel.
"C'monnnn, it's been ages since we all hung out without Bobby or mom hounding our asses. Plus, you need a break."
Sam nodded and gave Cas a small smirk. “So, what brought this on? Usually this early in the morning you're watching Netflix on my laptop or taking a walk around the bunker.”
, Dean was telling him that he wanted something more with Cas. That he wanted to be claimed. To have a nest together. Embarrassment washes over him in a hot wave.
"Hey can I get a ride home? Humphrey broke down last night. I had to take the city bus this morning. Do you know how many smokers ride the frigging bus? Too many. Even with the windows open I still couldn't breathe." Humphrey being her yellow VW Beetle. Not everyone had an original name for their car like Baby.
Quick disclaimer: I don't really know anything about LARPing. My tiny amount of knowledge comes from that spn ep, LARP and the Real Girl, and this one time that I ate lunch at a park and some kids were doing a Lord of the Rings LARP.
Dean would deny until the day he died he even knew of Tumblr's existence… but he really loved the trash can of a site.
How did  he forget about bisexuality? It even sounded way more accurate, especially the preference part.
"Oh—right, book club!" Dean abruptly blurted as he remembered what he was talking about earlier. "Since Dorothy's off sick, she can't help me out. Asked Charlie for help but she decided to be a pain in my ass." With an off-put sigh and a mouth full of maple syrup saturated pancakes, he informed Cas, "Had to bribe the shit out of her with donuts from Gabriel's."
realm and was just having fun screwing with humans. Sam and Dean dealt with him accordingly and headed home. By the time they arrived at the bunker, it was nearly 1am and the boys were wiped. Sam dragged himself to his room, saying he'd take a shower before his run in the morning. Dean grabbed a quick snack before walking to his room. A memory foam mattress was calling his name. Strolling down the long hallway, the dulcet tones of 40's swing music could be faintly heard. Writing it off as exhaustion getting the better of him, Dean continued on. Only the closer he got to the bedrooms, the louder the music became. Now, standing before the door to Cas' room,
. Dean is shaking under him, clutching tightly onto Cas' hair. Dean tugs him up into a kiss, licking the metallic taste of his own blood from Cas' mouth.
"What are you reading?" He blew the steaming cup of coffee before taking a sip. Dean held up the cover of the book so Cas could read the title. Cas scoffed. "
Rather than reassure Dean that 'Yes, everything is completely fine', he lets out an even louder distressed whine. He hates how little control he has over his faculties in rut.
Yes, it was juvenile and stupid, crushing on an unattainable person he knew virtually nothing about, but it was harmless. And pathetic.
." Dean had to restrain himself from gagging. He had no idea how Cas liked those weird ass cookies that (sorry mom) tasted like shit.
The Men of Letters’ vinyl collection was a good start. He found that he quite quite enjoyed the simple harmonies
Also, I know you can still be homophobic and have kissed someone of the same sex. It was just Dean's reasoning in his brain. I also want to add that Dean's whole "why didn't Cas tell me?" thing is very unhealthy and no one is obligated to know anyone's sexual orientation, even if you are best friends.
Cas gave him an incredibly soft look that practically oozed affection and slid under the covers beside him.
The room was silent, save for the sound of the roommates chewing and the soft chirps of birds enjoying the brisk weather.
The shower does very little to ease his rut. The most it seems to do is clean his skin of the sweaty film it acquired.
"How about we get a few rounds and annoy the hell out of everyone by playing the same song on the jukebox?"
"Thank you." Cas popped open the Tupperware container that was in the bag and stabbed a noodle with his fork.
Castiel rose with a loud yawn. Like most weekends, he awoke at ten am. Not too late, but not too early. He greatly valued the time he got to sleep in.
Unfortunately for Dean, he and Charlie Facetimed every Sunday night. Why would that be unfortunate? Well, Charlie, the damn bloodhound, wasn't likely to drop the whole seeing Thursday's Angel at the grocery store thing. In short, Dean was doomed.
Cas blearily blinks his eyes open to see Dean deposit the sandwiches and drink on the nightstand. A pained rumble erupts from his chest.
He stood in front of the bathroom mirror, hands clenched. "Pshhhh, you can do this. It's just a sentence. Say it." He took a deep breath. His heart beat wildly. "I'm bisexual." It sounded foreign to his ears; somewhere in the realm of scary. "I'm bisexual," he repeated. He felt slightly better. "I'm bisexual."
Rowena sat at the neighboring, albeit a little smaller, table holding a mug of steaming tea. Her eyeliner looked a little fiercer than usual. Must've been a grouchy morning. Missouri sat next to her, blowing on something that resembled chilli. Benny stood in the corner of the room at the counter. He pulled a tv-dinner out of the microwave.
"Okay." Cas pulls away, pressing kisses to Dean's skin as he slinks down. "Now?" he asks against Dean's neck.
Dean gave her a mock salute and made his way to the break room. It wasn't much—just a small room with a microwave, minifridge, and a table with, give or take, four chairs—but it was comfortable enough to spend his break there.
But he still didn't know what ground he stood on with men. Sure he'd had a man crush on various celebrities, like Harrison Ford, but that was just exercising non toxic masculinity. Straight people were allowed to admit that people of the same sex were hot, right?
Dean grunted, which, in Dean speech, meant "find your own Goddamn place to sit". Cas rolled his eyes but conceded. He dropped into the leather armchair facing the window, careful to not spill his drink.
"Hello Dean." Cas was sitting on the bed, vinyls scattered across the bedspread and a gramophone on the nightstand. However cluttered it seemed, it was the most lived-in Dean had ever seen the room.
"Yes, and?" Cas implored dismissively. He really didn't see the issue. Dean looked up at the blue eyed man with furrowed brows.
Charlie was sitting at the large round table in the center of the room, her Star Wars lunch pail and Capri Sun juice box in front of her. She reached into a pink tupperware container and popped a few pomegranate seeds into her mouth.
Gabriel made a snorting noise and opened the door, leaving it open for Michael to walk through and closing it softly – their mother hated slamming doors.
Dean was getting a book from his locker when Castiel turned up behind him with a note. Dean opened it up to read it.
Waking up in Dean’s arms was...unusual. It felt good, but it was something he wasn’t used to having – it was amazing actually. He curled in, even further on himself and snuggled into the warmth Dean’s body allowed him to have. He heard Dean mutter something, but his arm still remained around Castiel, making the boy’s cheeks flush slightly.
Castiel gave him a small bitter smile and reached across the hard wood table to get the paper and pen.
Castiel looked half way down the hallway, where the principal was leaning out of his office door, looking irritable.
He remembered his brother being found a month later and him being taken to court where his only evidence was the stitches on his neck, which now left horrible, ugly scars.
“Family is a lot more important than one day of missed classes,” Sam said, continuing to pull Dean towards the library by his hand, “now, come on, library – now.”
“She overworks herself,” Dean muttered tiredly in his room, everyone was in bed, but the four boys meaning Dean, Michael, Gabriel and Castiel were all up.
Anyway, here's the next chapter! Most of these chapters at these points are fillers and only have little details about Cas and his life and maybe some cute Dean/Cas scenes and Michael/Gabriel protective brother scenes.
Castiel looked up abruptly to see Dean Winchester rushing towards him, with no food tray or any food visible on his person. He was smiling down at him softly, “want to come sit with me and my friends?” he asked, “you don’t have to sit here all by yourself.”
Dean wondered to himself quietly, while sitting in the library on a hard, uncomfortable plastic chair, when it had changed from him taking care of Sam to Sam taking care of him. Admittedly, the situation was stressful and he was happy to have someone sit him down and tell him to relax a little, because if he didn’t he probably would have died from...emotional over exertion – if that was an actual thing.
He looked down; Sam was standing behind him carrying textbooks once again. He didn’t know why he needed so many – the classes he had didn’t require any and they were harder than what Sam was taking.
His life was beginning to feel unfairly brutal. He wished things would back to the way they were before – Lucifer locked up, mental children school, a mother who couldn’t tolerate him but he at least knew she had no plans to kill him.
His eyes suddenly sprung open at the mentioning of his name. He looked around and his eyes landed on the bed, where Dean was leaning up on his elbow, propping his head on his hand. He gave Castiel a soft smile, knowing that the other boy had seen him.
“Of course,” Dean muttered, “can’t forget the limited good things that have happened in the face of religion, for the pure selfish reason that everyone wants to go to heaven when they die.”
He sighed and sat down on the couch and tried not to look grumpy and uncomfortable. Michael was at the far back of the lounge room, scanning the bookshelves for something to read. Mary had a massive book collection, that probably rivalled that of the library not too far from here, and it was all fiction; minus a few nursing books here and there.
“Woah, easy there tiger,” Dean muttered, grabbing him and pulling him up so he stood up straight. Castiel took a deep breath and turned around to face Dean who was looking at him with obvious concern. It took him a second to notice Gabriel and Michael standing behind Dean, looking guilty and worried as well.
Gabriel just nodded, as if to say ‘fair enough’ and opened the door wider for Castiel to walk in. Gabriel’s room was a mess; it always was. Clothing strewn everywhere from two weeks ago, CDs piled high on his desk, some in their cases and others either in the CD player or on the floor. Castiel was surprised Gabriel hadn’t stepped on them yet.
“The other day you screamed at a spider,” Mary said in a huff, “I’m sorry if I feel like I have a reason to be worried.”
Dean rolled his eyes, “yeah, well-,” Dean’s red clad character turned around after the attack, kicking Gabriel’s blue clad character in the ribs and sending him down onto the floor. Gabriel pressed buttons randomly and hastily as the loud, ominous voice began counting down from ten, but his character was getting up.
“Here, drink this,” Mary said, sitting down on the edge of the couch he and Dean had sat on so many times before, watching TV and holding hands. He sat up and drank some of the water, noticing how dry and chapped his lips were. He gave Mary a look of gratefulness.
Castiel was shocked. He had instantly thought the broken nose had been done by one of his brothers. Not Dean.
Gabriel smiled softly, “you haven’t been sleeping well at all...do you want to talk about it?” he asked.
“Need to study American Sign Language?” she asked, “is that the new thing they’re doing in gangs now?”
Charlie, Adam and Sam ended up coming home at one thirty in the afternoon, carrying bags of groceries in and asking everyone to help. Castiel was more than happy to, putting things in cupboards as Adam pointed out which things went where, though every time he saw Dean filling a cupboard or chucking a spare bag in the bin, his mind seemed to die. Until Adam had to shake him awake from whatever day dream he’d been about to have.
For moments like these, Castiel would still have a notepad and pen around to write what he wanted to say.
Castiel had always had trouble sleeping at night due to the memories of waking up to find his brother on top of him, holding a knife to his neck, his alcoholic breath blowing into his face and into his nostrils, making him drunk just from the fumes. He remembered trying to scream, Lucifer jumping out the window and running, him running into his mother's bedroom and the call to the hospital.
“A little something Dean and Sam discovered when they were younger while playing truth or dare,” Mary answered due to Castiel’s questioning glance, “it’s quite nice – have a bite of Sam’s if you want a try.”
Dean didn’t know what was worse, a look of shock or betrayal or Castiel’s look of non-astonishment. It spoke lengths about the treatment the boy had suffered in his reasonably short life. Castiel felt around behind him for a chair and sat down at the kitchen table, but that was all he did. He sat there and signed nothing, he didn’t look disappointed, shocked, betrayed, anything, just a blank gaze, slowly followed by a small shrug.
“Mom adopted her,” Dean said with a small shrug, like it happened every day, “she lost her mother and her father and well...she needed a home,” he answered, “she’s been living here for about two months now. Mom loves her.”
Dean shook his head slowly, a small smile growing on his face, “I still can’t believe your mother actually called her son Lucifer.”
He sighed, relaxing automatically. The boy smiled at him and told him to move over. He did as he was told and was happy when Dean got into bed beside him.
Castiel shrugged in response to his mother’s repetitive question. It was the same thing she asked every afternoon, even when he was in the special school. It was the only sign that she gave some sort of a damn about her children; that they weren’t just her trophies to make her look like a better person.
Dean came up in front of him and sat on the cold, wet grass. He smiled up at Castiel and grabbed each of Castiel’s hands, “I don’t know how you deal with it,” he said, rubbing a thumb across his right hand. Castiel’s cheeks felt warm and he didn’t know whether it was because of the close proximity and the sign of affection, or because his palms were sweaty and Dean would be feeling the sweat on the pad of his thumb.
Nothing happened during math or any of the other classes he attended that day. He was starting to feel a lot calmer. Maybe Lucifer wasn’t here at all, maybe he was just at home all day, waiting for Castiel to return there, which he never would, not until Lucifer was caught. Then he would get all of his things and leave home forever. There was no way in hell he could move back into that house.
Gabriel and Michael joined in on conversations, though Castiel stayed silent. Not because not everyone knew how to sign or because he didn’t have a notepad with him, but because he felt comfortable. He was enjoying the way the conversation flowed between everyone without any signs of it being tense.
Dean rolled his eyes at his brother before closing the book and holding the cover towards Sam for him to see, “sign language,” he said, “I want to learn how to speak to Cas in a way he’s comfortable,” he put the book down, “it must be a pain in the ass writing me notes all the time.”
“Son,” he said, his voice getting angrier and angrier, “I am not in the mood for this today. Yesterday, our football team lost-.”
He heard the door shut quietly. His eyes were still closed, and he could feel a presence beside him, which felt too small to be Dean. He cracked open his eyes and looked beside him, it was Sam, who was watching TV with the sound off while he had a textbook open in front of him. When he noticed Castiel awake, he smiled softly at him and closed the textbook politely.
Ashton nodded, whimpering slightly. Everyone in the school was afraid of Michael. He was big a burley and not afraid to stand up for his two brothers in time of need. He’d been known for being overprotective of people he cared about since their first year of high school. Ashton was shoved against the locker again, the rest of the football team and the other students laughing at him as it happened.
Dean had no idea what business meant. He never really talked to his uncle Bobby a lot, and didn’t know much about the guy other than the fact that he was a really skilled mechanic and that he knew a lot about guns, considering he did a lot of hunting during the right season. Uncle Bobby wasn’t his real uncle, but he was the closest thing his dad had had to a brother, which was good enough for Dean to call him Uncle Bobby – even mentally.
“But she’s a horrible mother,” Gabriel said, “neglectful in every sense of the word. She didn’t even raise us,” he said rolling his eyes and slumping into his beanbag, “she hired a nanny and she’s the closest thing we’ve ever had to a mother since then, and that was years ago.”
She turned towards the rest of the class, “class dismissed,” she said, looking tired and frustrated, “go to the library and get some studying done; if you leave the school grounds I will be informed of it, I can assure you.”
Dean sighed, dug for his wallet in his pocket and handed over a five dollar bill. She gave him a form to sign and add all his details on and she quickly added him to the libraries member list before scanning the books and handing them to him.
When Castiel was seven, the knife would be held against his neck and he’d be asked to take out the trash, clean the car, cook dinner and hang out the washing.
Dean tried not to roll his eyes himself “then maybe contact Uncle Bobby?” he looked like it was the most obvious idea in the world, “you know how over-protective he is.”
It was times like these that made Dean wonder what life would be like if he'd followed Sammy to California. Sure he'd made the excuses of,
“When you and Dean returned from the hunt, he stopped by my room and found me listening to the music.” Cas paused for a second, looking as if he was searching for the right words. “He insisted that fifties love ballads were for
As he's lathering up with Dean's body wash—shush, it's right there—there's a jitteriness to his movements that he attributes to Dean's absence. His rut makes him so needy for Dean's attention. Attention he knows Dean only gives to him because Dean is a good friend. The best friend.
There's a moment of shuffling and blankets tugging until the beds dips and Dean is in the nest, pulling Cas into his arms.
The two had a system. Dean would make lunch—since Cas' idea of a good lunch was peanut and jelly sandwiches—and on their way to the teacher's lounge, he would pass the lunch to Cas.
Cas took off his reading glasses and pushed his work to the side. He turned to Dean and took his hand. "Sweetheart, I will love and support you no matter what you identify as. I can't tell you what your sexual identity is, but I can tell you that I know you will find something that feels right; whether that means you are bisexual, queer, or choose not to use a label. I know you will find something right in the end."
I am so sorry this took me SO long! I've just got a chronic illness and school is fucked up and I've been trying to do inktober (key word: trying). So yeah, I'm swamped but I am definitely not abandoning this work.
"Have you not been introducing me to older music?" Cas curiously tilted his head in that endearing way that Dean
Book club was fairly tame. Dean's only job was to supervise and make sure the kids stayed on topic. Sure they could get pretty hyped, but it was easy to keep them on task.
Dean lied flat on his back on the bed and sighed. "Good. Really good." He rolled onto his side, to see Cas. "That was it. I've come out to everyone."
Terribly sorry for the long, LONG delay!! I'm sure many of you know the feeling, but the finale deeply traumatized me to the point that thinking about the show gives me extreme anxiety and causes great distress. Even though I don't feel like that when I think about or read AUs, it's been incredibly difficult trying to write spn fic again. I still love the characters and this AU but the show killed a part of me. Anyways, I'm really trying. If newer chapters feel like they've lost their magic, just know it's because I'm trying to work through some stuff.
As an angel, Castiel could see when a composition resonated with a human soul, and that was always a wondrous sight; but they were still merely wavelengths that had no physical effect on him. He could not experience the beautiful phenomena himself. A catchy tune would not get stuck in his head after hearing Dean hum it during long drives. A powerfully delivered song with hard hitting lyrics wouldn't cause waterworks. Music was simply interesting because it was a staple in his friends' lives.
He met (well, started talking to) hey-assbutt, or Cas, a few months ago when they—or he, sometimes—reblogged Dean's post with basically an essay on how queer coded Dr. Palmer and Dr. Steele were. Needless to say, they hit it off immediately. And they got along so well.
Dean hummed and pulled a slice of pizza wrapped in plastic wrap out of his bag. His phone buzzed before he could take a bite. The English teacher huffed but unlocked his phone to see a message from Sam.
"Let me have one more sip-" Jo dragged him by the arm. His drink sloshed as he stumbled after her. The jukebox sat, menacingly, in front of them, playing Come on Eileen for the umpteenth time that night. Jo snatched his drink and downed it before twirling with his hand in hers. "I hate you."
For a long moment Dean stares blankly at Cas with his mouth agape. Cas has no idea where this is going. And it's terrifying.
The man in question spun to see who called his name. Sure enough, his baby brother Sammy was sitting in a booth waving.
"As a multidimensional wavelength of celestial intent, I really do not see the relevance gender has in determining interests in music."
"God no, Dean! I was planning on proposing this upcoming Tuesday. She gets home early from the hospital and I was hoping to surprise her with a bath and a massage."
"So, when 're you popping the question? Please don't do it during sex. Nobody wants to be that guy."
The pain in Cas' abdomen crawls to a threadbare hum as he scrapes his teeth across Dean's scent gland.
Dean watched his screen as the ellipsis appeared and disappeared. Apparently this question warranted multiple tries.
The last thing he expected to see when he turned around was his favorite ASMRtist. Honestly, while checking up on the Continental, he'd already envisioned the owner to be some guy like Ash. Someone who legitimately thought that car was
When Dean walked into the kitchen one morning, Cas was sitting at the kitchen table donning a pair of earbuds plugged into his phone. Dean didn't think much of it (being that it was only seven in the morning and he hadn't gotten his caffeine fix yet) and headed straight to the coffee pot. No sooner than fifteen minutes later, he sat down opposite Cas with a cup of what was now his second cup of coffee. “Whatchya listenin’ to there, bud?”
I apologize for the long wait for this chapter!! With the ending of Supernatural being right around the corner, thinking about the show in general has been pretty anxiety inducing.
Seating himself in one of the red booths—the low, golden lighting of the bar washed over his features—was the man he'd now come to know as Jimmy.
He pulls out slowly, making every inch of it count, making Dean feel it, really feel him, adjust to him, before shoving back in.
“What is it?” Cas asks, not picking his head up from where it’s resting on Dean’s shoulder, face turned towards Dean’s neck.
Dean scrambles for the lube bottle, popping it open one handed and taking his other hand out of Cas to nudge at his hip.
"Good," Jessica says, and Dean can feel the rest of the rod going in, strange for a brief moment. "Now breathe in again for me. And now slowly out."
Dean lifts his own and tangles his fingers with Cas’. It’s hard to tell time in the windowless rooms of the bunker, but he thinks it’s probably still early morning. Cas is heavy on top of him, and clearly in no hurry to move. It’s been a long time since Dean has felt the luxury of someone spread on top of him, nothing nasty lurking in the dark corners, just out of sight. There’s still shit to do, monsters, probably, and Jack, up in heaven needs Cas, but none of it is pressing, and for the first time in maybe ever Dean doesn’t feel the restless urge pulling him out of bed, pulling him towards the next big thing.
“Dean,” Cas says, and Dean can feel the vibrations of his name against his lips, his tongue. It’s glorious.
He’s not entirely surprised when Cas leaves at the sound of Sam’s footsteps. His eyes had been deep and intense and Dean had known him. Wherever Cas is taking the tablet, it’ll be safe.
“What does that mean?” Dean asks, crossing his arms over his chest. He feels vulnerable, open to Cas’ piercing gaze and the warmth of his presence in his mind.
Jessica knocks his hand away. "Try not to touch it without cleaning your hands first,” she says. "But yes, you now have a pierced ear, Dean. Congratulations."
“Me,” Dean says. He feels pleasure drunk, loose and easy and unashamed of the filth pouring from his mouth.
But Cas ignores his cock for now, moving onto Dean’s hipbone, and lifts Dean’s right leg so he can lick a long stripe up the underside of Dean’s thigh, flicking his tongue against the bend of Dean’s knee.
“Come on, Cas, I don’t know what game you’re playing, but I don’t like it,” Dean snaps, striding towards him. He stops just short of coming into contact with Cas, afraid, so afraid, that he’ll disappear when he does.
Dean’s breath stops in his chest, watching his angel come on top of him, because of him, and then Cas is kissing him and Dean forgets who he is, where he is. All he knows is that he belongs to Cas, that Cas belongs to him.
Cas smiles at him and wraps his fingers around Dean’s cock, pumping slowly, fingers long and strong.
Cas works at that spot for several long moments, until he’s apparently satisfied and pulls back. He lifts Dean’s foot off the bed and kisses the arch of it, light and gentle before putting it back down on the bed.
But he is, and Cas in just his shirtsleeves is so fucking hot that it distracts Dean for a good ten seconds, ten seconds where he, embarrassingly, just stares openly.
Dean exhales harshly. It’s not an answer. Or, at least, it’s the wrong one. Because Sam had thought it funny. “Whatever,” he says.
Dean remembers now that Cas doesn’t actually have to breathe, that having Dean’s cock down his throat isn’t posing any problem for him. Dean winds his fingers back in Cas’ hair and just holds on. Because whatever lack of experience Cas has with blowjobs he’s more than making up for with enthusiasm and his
“You told me in the crypt that we are family,” Cas says. “Thank you. I value that, more than I can express.”
Cas is the one to break the kiss, and when he does Dean finds himself sucking in air. Fuck. Had he forgotten to breathe?
“What’re they like?” Dean can’t help asking, still petting through Cas’ wings. He runs a finger across the top of the second wing and it flutters a little in response. “I know I can’t see ‘em, but, can you describe ‘em?”
They end up driving a few hours out of Lebanon. Partially because a Google search had revealed nicer-looking parlors farther out, and because Dean misses it, the long drives in Baby, especially with Cas at his side, humming into the breeze. It's an excuse to get out, and even if Sam had been all sappy and annoying about it, cooing about how they're long overdue a date and how he's tired of looking at them making cow eyes at each other, Dean knows he appreciates the alone time.
It sets Dean off again in his own round of sniggers. When he finally recovers, Cas is looking at him, staring.
Dean shouts in surprise, muffled by Cas’ mouth. Dean doesn’t wear especially tight jeans, but between Cas’s hands and his own erection they’re definitely straining. He reaches between them for Cas’ belt, undoing it quickly, hoping Cas gets the hint. He doesn’t bother unthreading it, going straight for the button and the zipper, until he can cup his hand around Cas’ cock, bulging in the front of his underwear.
“I am here,” Cas says. He moves his head again so he can kiss the top of Dean’s throat, then his adam’s apple, and then the base of his throat.
, and Dean comes, like a fucking teenager, all sudden and shocking and bright. He clutches at Cas’ hair and rocks his hips into his mouth, and Cas just
Heh. As if Dean would have let anyone else go. Cas had given himself willingly, happily to the Empty for Dean, and it has to be Dean who pulls him back.
"Yeah, "Dean says. The excitement making his blood pump is lighter them the dread he's so used to. It makes him feel almost wilder.
“I can also sense longing,” Cas says, and he says it so simple, but it’s shattered Dean’s whole world wide open. He longs for Cas, he can admit that much to himself. He longs for his presence, his friendship, for his intense stare and odd touches, longs for the way he just puts himself in the spaces that Dean can’t quite invite anyone into.
Dean tugs at his tie, ruffling Cas further, before he shifts on his knees, stretching up and over Baby’s front seat. And it is a stretch, to reach the glove box where he keeps a tube of lube, and Cas takes the opportunity to paw at Dean’s hip, his ribs, where his shirts have ridden up to expose his skin.
He's not sure what this bright young thing with already glittering ears must think of him, in his forties and clueless, but her smile is warm and friendly.
get hard again. He definitely feels like his whole body is on fire, bright sparks chaining just under his skin, lighting him up from the inside out everywhere Cas touches.
Dean grunts. He goes back to cutting through the brush, frustrated that it doesn’t part for him. He’s frustrated at the conversation, that Benny would talk about the things he’d rather not, and frustrated at his own stupid feelings bubbling up inside him. He shoves them aside. There’s no time for that, not now. “Don’t got any other friends,” he grumbles instead, careful to continue avoiding eye contact.
But Cas is here now, warm and solid, holding Dean while Dean has an existential crisis at eight in the morning. They had fucked last night, and Cas had pressed a kiss between Dean's shoulder blades and spoken words of love, of worship as he rocked into Dean's body. Dean had clutched his hand and kissed Cas' knuckles.
Dean’s heart beats a little harder. He squeezes Cas' hand and resists the urge to start making out with him.
Before he can lose himself in it again, Cas pulls back. “Dean,” he says, as if he can’t get enough of saying Dean’s name.
It’s Cas he pictures those things with. Only Cas. And...and he’d written it off, because Cas has always stood a little too close, stared a little too long, touched a little too much. And Dean had let him, because Cas is an angel, because Cas didn’t understand and that made it safe, Dean realizes.
Cas is looking at him in that intense way he has, like he’s looking into Dean, into his core, seeing who he really is. Fuck, maybe with his angel mojo that’s exactly what he’s doing.
“Yeah, yes,” Dean says into Cas’ mouth, and it’s torture to let go of him for long enough to get his arms out of the sleeves. Then Dean’s flannel is on the floor and his hands are back at Cas’ hips, dipping into his waistband, pulling out his shirttails and running his hands up under Cas’ shirt, fingers grasping at warm skin.
“It’s really okay that you like Cas,” Sam continues, all earnest puppy face. Then he grins. “Was that your first kiss with him?”
Well, at least I'm actually more than eighteen years old, Dean thinks. He'd lied about that too, back in the day, though it had been a hard sell. His dad had grumbled about Dean's pretty face, but there wasn't anything to be done about Dean's face. At least Cas finds it "aesthetically pleasing".
Dean shivers a little and just keeps kissing Cas, focusing on him, on his hot mouth, the warm skin of his waist under Dean’s hands.
“She’s helpful around the house,” Mary said, sitting down at her spot at the dinner table, “I can’t say the same about a certain someone...”
Michael walked in, carrying a book and reading from it while putting an empty mug that had held coffee, in the sink, “do you want me to clean that?” he asked, pointing towards the plate with melted cheese on it. Mary just shook her head and began rinsing the mug.
“That’s right little brother,” he heard Lucifer breathe into the phone, “I know what school you go to...I know how to contact you...I mean – I did call mom the other night and say goodnight to you, said that I hoped that you would sleep well.”
Gabriel glared at him, but Castiel let out a little choked laugh. They all started laughing, from a mixture of relief and amusement.
Dean slowly sat next to him on the bed, and wrapped his arms around him. They sat like that for a long time. Never moving. Just enjoying one another’s warmth.
Dean hastily got out of the car and ran towards the front door of the house, Sam not too far behind him; he hastily thrust his key into the door lock and unlocked it before rushing it. He smelled smoke and rushed towards the kitchen where Gabriel and Castiel were trying their best to get the smoke alarms to shut off. There was no fire; there was nothing that even resembled a flame.
He headed off to his class as quickly as he could. He couldn’t stand to look at Dean’s worried glance. It put him on edge - it made him realize that he was foolish for believing that everything was okay. That it was only just the other’s trying to make him feel better about the situation.
Dean borrowed them all, the heavy texts being held in his arms, he headed over towards the librarians desk where she continued to give him a look of confusion and mistrust.
“We’ll be fine Deano,” Gabriel said, shoving a chip into his mouth, “the worst that’s going to happen is that Lucifer pops up right in the middle of math,” he paused, “sorry I meant the best thing.”
Dean rolled his eyes, “I already told you. I didn’t like what they did to you. It was unfair in so many ways.”
“You know, I like you,” Dean said, his face going slowly red, “like...” he looked down at his hands in embarrassment. Castiel waited, his confusion only growing.
“Guests who owe you because you’re attempting to protect us from our psychopath of a brother,” Gabriel chimed in, “this is a little different from the regular guest situation.”
He was scared that Lucifer would show up and confront him somehow – he was probably staking out the school, just waiting for the moment he would come back or when he was alone in the halls. He would have to remind himself to try and be around someone at all times.
The phone began to ring, and when he heard his mother pick it up and answer he had never felt more relieved.
“Get in the shower,” Dean says, opening the door to the bathroom, “I’ll go get you some clothes, okay?”
“Can we not discuss this now?” his mother’s tone turned cold just as the blood rushing through Castiel’s veins seemed to, “this is not appropriate dinner time conversation.”
Dean smiled down at the note and crumpled it in his pocket. He thought for two seconds before signing
They all sat in the lounge room; Dean and Gabriel were playing some video game, involving race cars. Castiel watched, drifting off occasionally a day dreaming. Whenever he was brought back to reality however, he always forgot what he had been day dreaming about.
“You’re all staying here,” she said in an frustrated tone, looking between Michael, Gabriel and Castiel, “there is no way you’re going back to that maniac’s house, understood?” she asked. The three boys showed no signs of wanting to even argue.
Castiel walked through the front doors that morning with Dean, Sam, Michael and Gabriel all following right behind him. He felt like he had his own army – that he was safe. And normally the school wasn’t that lack on security...was it?
“Charlie is a lesbian,” Dean said simply, “my mother still loves her all the same as the rest of us,” he said, “then again, the amount of times she’s  gone into a patients room and the story is ‘my homophobic parent beat me up,’ she’d be stupid to not realise how wrong it is.”
Dean, Gabriel and Michael all rushed to explain so all of their words become jumbled together, Chuck looked exhausted, and if this situation wasn’t so serious then Castiel may have found it humorous.
sleep,” another cackle, “TTYL, Castiel. Keep an eye open,” the breathing continued, “or I’ll rip them both out,” Lucifer said darkly, before hanging up the phone.
Castiel woke up, his vision blurred, machines around him beating monotonously. He sighed softly, feeling a little bit of pain as the skin around his neck contorted at the action, he winced and regretted it a second later.
“Either way,” Dean mumbled, “she’s always tired after work and it worries me,” he said, “she’s working way too hard.”
That made Castiel pause; it was true, he hadn’t corrected Dean at all, but he hadn’t been in a good condition. He hadn’t been thinking like that back then. But thinking about it – did he really consider the place he went to most days after school, ate, and slept, home?
Everyone pulled up chairs and started talking casually, as if they were all in Dean’s room on their bean bags – it almost felt normal. He simply listened – he didn’t feel like he could sign fast enough for the conversation, but it felt good to see them looking happy, whether it was acting or not.
It ended up becoming a movie marathon, the time flying away from them in a way it hadn’t in ages. Mary got home and told them to go to bed at around two in the morning.
There was something about the way Dean said that, that made Castiel feel warm and fuzzy inside. Something that slowly crawled up his arms and rushed around his chest, making his heart beat quicker. The feeling rushed through his veins and eventually flowed around his whole body, the feeling intensifying, but not to the point it was uncomfortable.
He made his way towards his own locker, with shaky hands he took out some books he needed for class, before angrily slamming the locker door and turning away.
Castiel ended up sitting down on a swing set near the park at the end of the street. It was cold outside; he hugged his trench coat that Gabriel had got him tighter. Then thought about how much of a traitor Gabriel was and shrugged it off and let it fall to the ground in a heap.
“No,” Gabriel stopped him right there, “there is no point in devising some massive plan because it just unsettles everyone and freaks them out,” he said, “if we treat him like an unstoppable ninja then we’re going to freak out when, and if the moment comes. It’s simple – remember your exits; front door, back door, window, whatever. Just get out of the house,” he looked at Castiel and Dean as if this were the most obvious idea in the world, “I know I’m not normally the voice of reason, but it’s so goddamn obvious that even
Sam pushed his plate closer to Castiel’s slowly, focusing on the textbook in front of him and writing down in his notebook beside him, his eyes glued to the page slowly chewing on the one bit of pancake he had successfully gotten into his mouth without losing the staring competition he had going on with the words on the page.
“You’re going to be okay,” Dean said, giving him a loving smile whilst rubbing Castiel’s knuckles with the pad of his thumb.
Castiel was sitting on top of Dean’s bed, reading one of Mary’s many books – Michael was down in the kitchen with Sam attempting to make food for everyone.
“He loves it when I tease him!” Gabriel exclaimed, beginning to shrug his shoulders repetitively, like an upward shimmy, “am I doing it right Cassie?” he asked, shrugging his shoulders, “am I doing the Castiel?”
The evil eye returned as she shoved the books at him. He tried to give her his own best evil eye before turning around and exiting the library.
He took something out of his pocket and Castiel forced himself to look down and see what it was, it seemed to take forever for his head to tip down and finally focus on what looked like a box cutter, black and yellow, in the man’s hand.
“He’s not that sensitive,” Gabriel said, sounding a little irritated, “besides, I know the guy, he’s really nice. Who? Dean. You know Dean! The Winchester with the kid brother; the one you thought would grow up to be handsome. Yes, the handsome one with the future handsome brother,” Gabriel rolled his eyes again and Castiel made a choked sound of laughter. It was the only sound he could make, and it sounded horrible. He looked around; making sure no one else had heard him. His choked laughter was one of his insecurities.
Besides, he was certain that Dean was the only one that was ever going to like him in this condition. How many people want a mute boyfriend who can occasionally make weird squawking noises?
He heard a click, and turned his head around the corner to see who had entered the bathroom. His jaw dropped.
Castiel was tempted to roll his eyes. What else was he supposed to say? His mother didn’t give up enough of her time to even bother learning how to sign, unlike his brother’s who had been more than happy to learn for his benefit. But his mother wouldn’t understand a thing he said. So shrugging was all he had to show his mother how indifferent he was about his first day of school.
He wrote it down and Dean simply shrugged, “but you don’t know that – hell, I don’t even know that and I’ve met the guy.”
“Don’t be a dick Gabriel,” Dean said, “You know from experience that I will turn this car right back around!” he said, trying to sound as serious as possible, but it only ended up with him laughing anyway.
There was banging on the door again and shouting to be let in, causing Sam to drop his bag of chips on the ground, he rolled his eyes, “someone stole your moves Dean.”
The whole situation felt surreal – like a TV show – soap opera. Something his mother would watch and then complain about the falseness of it all, but then she refused to watch reality shows because they were mediocre and they all seemed to copy one another.
He shook his head no, because it was the truth and he felt he could be honest with Dean. He didn’t feel obligated to lie about his wellbeing like he did with his brothers.
“I’ll be fine boys,” Mary said, “if you must do something, then do the dishes and maybe dust the bookshelf. But that’s all I want you doing – nothing extravagant. You’re guests.”
It was his first day and he was late for his first class and he’d been late for roll call. Today was not a good day.
Sam sighed, “Come on,” he said, grabbing Dean’s hand and pulling him, “we’re going to the library for the rest of the day. Then we can go home.”
“Cool,” Gabriel said, already sitting on the couch, feet propped up on the arm of the couch with the TV remote in his hand. Dean rolled his eyes and shut the front door as Castiel moved towards the lounge room to sit in the arm chair. Castiel wasn’t as comfortable making himself at home as Gabriel and Michael were, but to be fair they were friends with Dean before he was. He was secretly jealous of that fact; if he’d just gone to normal high school, he could have gone through high school with Dean. And then maybe their friendship wouldn’t be so awkward.
I re-read the first chapter and realised I really despised my writing style in this. So, I've started re-writing this fanfiction. I hope to post the new chapters soon! Stay tuned.
Gabriel just shrugged and sat down next to Castiel on the bed, grabbing one of the take-out food boxes which turned out to still have noodles in it, “want some?” he asked. Castiel shook his head, “suit yourself,” he grabbed some chopsticks from the table and began digging in, all the while talking.
He knew this feeling only too well, however he’d hoped he’d never have to feel it ever again. But it seemed things didn’t want to go too right for him in his short life.
Dean looked at him, happy to make him smile, “I was kidding so don’t tell your brother alright? I just wanted to see you smile.”
Dean reached forward and grabbed the hand that wasn’t wrapped around the handle of his coffee mug. Castiel looked at Dean, with a small smile, tears in his eyes.
Gabriel wrapped his arm around Castiel, “well you better tell a better story to keep this guy interested, apparently he was day dreaming in Science all evening.”
Castiel didn’t know whether it was intended to be a joking offensive question or a literal one, but he answered anyway, writing the name down on his arm in pen.
This was the type of family he wanted. Not some, egomaniac of a mother who loved only herself and no one else.
Castiel had tried to act normal for the last few weeks, but every time he turned a corner he expected Lucifer to be there, waiting for him, knife ready, aimed perfectly at his throat. Also when he was walking he would look behind him every few seconds, just to make sure he wouldn’t sneak up from behind and get him. But Lucifer was a no show.
, Castiel signed with his hands. His mother simply nodded; despite the fact that Castiel had been signing everything with his hands for the last five years, she still hadn’t bothered to learn. Michael and Gabriel, however, were fluent in sign language just like Castiel was. He was able to have private conversations right in front of their mother for hours and hours, and lie to her about the meanings of their handmade words. It was funny to say the least.
He felt a hand land on his shoulder and he turned around quickly. Dean was standing there, looking at him with a mixture of confusion and worry.
Lucifer slowly started creeping forward and in a panic, Castiel stupidly pushed himself into the corner of a cubicle, trying not to fall over the toilet. Lucifer was in front of him, the blade of the box cutter slowly lifting and pressing into the skin of his throat.
So, I wrote most of this while at my old primary school doing work experience for the school's library. Really weird being back here to be honest.
Skin against skin was Castiel’s new favourite feeling; they didn’t end up having sex again that night – he was still sore. But he enjoyed the feeling of nakedly kissing Dean. It felt even more intimate than having sex – because you’re caught up in the moment. This time, as he kissed Dean, he got to feel every detail, every little more, every tiny dint in his skin indicating an old scar which was probably connected to some beautiful childhood memory. He made a small little moan noise, which almost sounded completely normal to him.
The two boys stammered for answers, but he knew anyway that it would be something cliché, like ‘we didn’t want to worry you,’ or ‘we didn’t want you to get hurt.’
