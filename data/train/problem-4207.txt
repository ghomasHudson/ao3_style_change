Castiel’s hands started to possessively rubbed Dean’s round ass, making the omega moan around Benny’s knot.
Dean just smiled, deciding he would ask his alpha to do just that. Castiel was a good alpha, Dean knew he would at least consider it.
“Suck me,” Castiel ordered, voice muffled through the table.
Benny finally groaned and spilled down the back of Dean’s throat, and the omega settled in and started to gently suckle the alpha’s knot. He loved the feeling of being caught on the knot as he steadily swallowed load after load of the alpha’s seed, making his belly swell a little further.
Castiel smiled and kissed Dean again, pushing his tongue into the omega’s mouth to slowly explore and claim. Dean moaned in submission and need, whining when Castiel pulled away again.
Dean whimpered and squirmed as Castiel’s hand cracked down on his ass. He wanted to beg forgiveness, to promise anything the alpha wanted, but with the gag in his mouth he couldn’t. He could only take the punishment. He was quivering with the urge to submit when Castiel finally laid one last smack to his ass and was done. Dean couldn’t even look at him, he could only hold his position on his hands and knees, keeping his head submissively low.
Next, Castiel held out the shorts for Dean to step into. When he pulled them up and buttoned them, Dean realized they were so short that his round and perky ass cheeks hung out the bottom. Castiel grinned and groped at Dean before moving to help him into the boots, lacing them up tight.
“Good,” Castiel said with a chuckle, leading the Alphas upstairs.
“Please, Alpha,” Dean begged, climbing onto Castiel’s lap. “You know how I hate being empty…” Dean was sure Castiel had done this to him on purpose, the alpha knew how desperate Dean got when he wasn’t plugged.
The day passed in a blur for Dean, he didn’t notice much when he was strapped in and knotted. And he was almost always knotted, as soon as Daddy’s knot would go down the alpha would lay him out and fuck him again, so that by the end of the day he was even more full than he had been that morning and his diaper was heavy with his own come.
A deep voice rumbled. “I can smell that omega you got in there, Brother, good job.”
Sam just crossed his arms and gave Dean an exasperated look.
Castiel set Dean down in his special omega chair at the table, and in front of him was a plastic plate with cut up pancakes and fruit.
What was he
Dean was a petite omega, even though he was fully grown he just barely came up to his alphas chest when standing, and he had an adorably innocent face. His daddy had chosen him because he “just looked the part.”
Dean shivered, and he felt the alpha’s commanding tone go straight to his gut, triggering his instincts to submit. Why did he have to be so handsome and strong? Suddenly Dean knew, he had to get out of here right now if he was going to have any chance of getting away, he didn’t think he’d survive five minutes alone with this man without surrendering himself.
Dean moaned around the gag as he was fucked hard again, and it wasn’t long before his mate’s knot was tied inside him again, and Castiel returned him to his hanging position so he could continue his work.
Dean shook his head, still pulling back. He couldn’t go outside, that was just too humiliating!
“I can’t, I can’t!” Dean whined, shaking his head back and forth, panting and moaning with each thrust. “It’s too big!”
“Good morning, my little omega,” Castiel murmured, tugging Dean around to lay on his back, so that he could smile down at him. He reached out to caress Dean’s cheek before leaning in to press a kiss to his lips.
“Time for you to learn how to beg for your orgasms, little bitch,” Castiel said, voice rough with the pleasure of his own release. “You’re going to learn not to come without permission. Good fuckholes only come when Alphas feel like allowing it.”
“Shhh, you’re okay,” the man murmured. “That’s a good girl.” He then leaned in and bit down hard on the back of Dean’s neck, claiming him.
His panties had been swapped out for a similar pink pair, only these were trimmed with pearls and the bow over his bare ass had a large diamond in the center. His stockings were replaced by glittering pink heals, and on both of his wrists he wore diamond studded pink cuffs. He still wore his collar and his robe, although he knew the robe wouldn’t last long, his alpha liked him naked when company was over.
Dean jumped in surprise when Benny’s hands groped his ass, squeezing gently before they found the hard base of the plug through his shorts, and when he pushed on it Dean moaned when it made the toy press into his prostate.
Dean could feel his daddy’s cock getting hard again where it was pressed against his leg, and he whined and rubbed against it. “Daddy, knot! Please, Daddy!” He begged, desperate to be full again.
Dean whined as the man’s hands raked down his chest, one pushing up under his shirt to find a nipple to twist while the other pushed down the front of his jeans and grabbed his dick. “Yes,” he whimpered, pushing his ass back towards the alpha’s hips. “I’m sorry, Alpha.”
Half asleep, he heard Castiel chuckle and whisper to Benny. “You used him good, didn’t you?”
Dean bit his lip, climbing out of bed and onto wobbly feet. A mess of come and slick streaked his ass and the inside of his legs. He walked nervously to the new Alpha, who put eager hands on Dean’s waist.
Sam planted his foot behind the door before he cracked it open, just incase the other alpha tried to force his way in. But that didn’t happen, Dean could see Castiel standing awkwardly in the hallway, looking nervously from Sam to where he could see Dean.
Dean let out another whimper, absently realizing that meant he would be left like this for the rest of the party. But he was so focused on the buzzing plug and his full belly that he didn’t have it in him to care. His mind was hazy with submission, and he felt himself drop further into a fog of pleasure, continuing to suckle the cock gag in his mouth and thrust his ass back against the vibrating plug.
After what felt like only a few minutes, Dean was woken my his eager Alpha pushing him over on his stomach, and he gasped as Castiel’s hard cock was once again thrust deep into his channel. This time Castiel didn’t hesitate to fuck Dean hard from the first stroke, and the omega could only whine and moan as his Alpha’s hips slapped hard against his ass and his big cock pistoned into him. It was only a few minutes before Castiel’s knot started to grow, and soon they both came hard, collapsing back into the bed again.
When the last man pulled out, Castiel reached around and pulled up Dean’s jeans. They were soaked through, in the front and the back, and his abused hole was still steadily leaking. Dean’s legs shook as Castiel helped him to his feet, and the alpha had to stand to wrap an arm around him.
“Your body is getting used to this,” Benny commented, running his hands up and down Dean’s chest. “You were made to take a thick alpha knot.”
In hindsight, Castiel was very lucky that he chose to leave work early that day. If he hadn’t, he wouldn’t have been walking to the parking garage just as a burly man was dragging a small omega out onto the street corner.
“Holy shit…” Sam said, clearly shocked.
Castiel laughed softly, pulling himself up and pushing Dean over on his back in one fluid movement. He propped himself up with his arms on either side of Dean’s face, smiling down at the omega. The position made Dean feel small and submissive in a way no alpha before had ever been able to manage.
“You certainly will be sorry when I’m done with you,” Castiel grumbled, and he suddenly yanked down Dean’s jeans and underwear with a sharp tug.
He knew he’d won when he noticed the bulge in the front of officer Novak’s pants. “Get out of the car,” the alpha ordered, voice suddenly even deeper than before.
A small part of Dean felt bad about it, but it was mostly overridden by the instinct to please his alpha. His alpha had purchased Heather for this job, and he would not criticize his alpha.
The whole desk shook as Castiel continued to slam into Dean, making the omega whimper and moan from the rough treatment. Dean had to bite his lip to stop himself from coming without permission, until finally Castiel’s knot slammed into place and the Alpha came with a growl.
Dean’s words were mixed with moans as he obeyed. “I’m Castiel’s bitch, ahh, and I am an o-obedient and e-eager fuckhole!” The words seemed to be punched out of him by the force of Benny’s thrusts. “Please Alpha, may I come?” he begged. “I’m a good fuckhole, so good, please Alpha!” He was starting to babble, desperate with need as the Alpha’s knot fucked him open wider.
by him.
The room was silent for a few minutes, and Castiel did his very best to read, but it was hard to focus when he could easily smell the omega’s scent now that it had no other competition in the room. It was intoxicating, even across the room Castiel could tell that the boy was fertile and compatible, an ideal mate. He could even smell a little slick, indicating the omega’s body was responding in kind, whether or not Dean understood it he didn’t know.
Dean jumped up to hurry to the door, eager to speak to the alpha again, but Sam growled and blocked him. “We didn’t order any room service,” he whispered sharply to Dean, before moving to the door.
“That’s close enough,” Balthazar replied with a chuckle, taking Benny’s hand. Dean loved the pleasant lilt of his British accent. “We couldn’t help but admire your new bitch, he’s really something else.”
“Glad to hear it,” Balthazar said, licking his lips as he looked Dean over. “Not too sore after last night?”
The Alpha’s eyes traced Dean’s face, considering. “I’ve been looking for an omega. I have plenty of money and could take very good care of you, provide handsomely for our pups someday.” He reached out and ran a hand down Dean’s face. “I could protect you. It’s dangerous on the street, anyone could claim you. You could end up mated to a drug addict or lord knows what.”
Castiel looked up at Dean and smiled. “I’m glad to see you’re awake, come here, I have your new outfit.”
Castiel chuckled. “You bet your ass it did.”
He expected they would spend the next 45 minutes in bed, he’s learned during his heat that Castiel had particularly long knots. So he was surprised when Castiel wrapped an arm around him, pinned Dean’s back against his chest, and stood up easily.
“I’ve never seen a bitch so happy to suck a knot.”
Dean let out a moan when the big Alpha’s hard cock was suddenly pressing into his tender and well used channel. He grunted as Benny immediately started to fuck him hard, taking full advantage of Dean’s sloppy ass.
Dean whined at the pleasure of his alpha’s hand, embarrassed but compelled to tell the truth. “Yes Daddy… I like it.”
Benny had already knotted Dean twice. Or was it three? He couldn’t remember, it was all blurring together. He could only nod and murmur, “Yes, Alpha,” nuzzling his face into Benny’s lap. In spite of how many times he’d been knotted he couldn’t help nosing at the hardening cock starting to tent Benny’s jeans.
The vice principal escorted Castiel to his class room, giving him a schedule of the day’s classes. “Watch out for Dean Winchester in your third period, he’s a trouble maker,” the woman said. “He’s easy to spot, he was castrated young so he’s much smaller than the other 13 year olds.”
Dean turned eagerly to Benny, crawling to his lap with his mouth open, desperate for any knot he’d be allowed. For the first time he noticed the room was full of alphas, over twenty strangers watching him, but he didn’t care. He gasped as the vibrations in his ass jumped up a level, and he whimpered impatiently as Benny pulled his cock free, and he quickly took it into his mouth and swallowed it down. He moaned around the thick alpha, pleased to finally be allowed to suck and lick, working towards his promised knot.
Castiel just growled, gripping Dean’s hips and slamming in harder. “Take it!” he snapped. “You wanted to get fucked by an alpha, so be a good bitch and take it!” He couldn’t stop himself, he finally had the most perfect little omega impaled on his cock and he was determined to
“Yes,
The haze slipped a little and Dean’s stomach twisted in the face of this new humiliation. But he didn’t have it in him to fight, so when Castiel unclipped the leash he just obediently slunk into the cage, head hanging submissively low. He turned around just in time to watch Cas closed the cage door and latch it shut.
Dean was only vaguely aware of the other alphas watching, but he had no capacity to care. His only thought was a desperate need to be knotted and marked.
“Oh… Alpha!” Dean cried, pushing his ass back to meet Castiel’s cock, moaning as the alpha started to steadily thrust. It was slow at first, then faster, until the alpha was fucking him hard.
A shiver of pleasure raced down Dean’s back at the alpha’s words and he blushed. “W-what?”
Castiel coughed and quickly took his seat behind his desk, trying to ignore the way Dean stole a glance at him and then ducked his gaze submissively. He ended up having to deliver the whole lesson seated at the desk, as his damn dick couldn’t stop thinking about the boy. Castiel kept waiting for him to act out, as he’d been warned, but the boy was nothing but the perfect picture of attentive obedience and submission throughout the whole class.
Benny growled. “We’re not doing this, pup. Cas, will you open the door?”
“Yes Alpha,” Dean breathed, nodding quickly. He watched Castiel turn to leave, gasping when he felt eager hands reach out and grab at his naked body.
“Brother, you need to find us a bitch,” Benny said, repeating something he’d pointed out to Castiel several times in the last month. “Most Alphas join a pack to get access to a stunning omega that they’d otherwise not be able to catch by themselves.”
Dean squirmed, face burning red and unable to look the alpha in the eye. The thing was, the alpha was tapping into a long held, very
Dean cried out at the sharp mix of pleasure and pain as his Alpha slammed into him, but the sounds were quickly muffled by Benny’s thick cock pressing past his lips and fucking into his throat. He whimpered around the cock in his mouth as he was fucked fast and hard. Castiel’s thrusts were brutal, but Dean very quickly found himself moaning like a whore and arching his back in an attempt to take his Alpha’s cock in deeper. He instinctually crossed his arms behind his back and gripped his wrists, showing his submission to the Alphas’ rough treatment.
Castiel closed the door, and Dean was lost to his heat and his new alpha.
in need of saving. “Um, sorry, I woke up and you were gone. I was worried.”
Dean smiled up at his daddy, ready to go to work with him.
When class was finally over, Castiel tried not to look at Dean as the students filed out, but he didn’t miss the way the omega’s eyes glanced at him several times on the way out of the room. When the classroom was finally empty Castiel let out a groan and locked the door, it was lunch period and he desperately needed to jerk off or he was going to be sporting a hard on for the rest of the day.
Heather lead him back to Castiel, now at the bar in the large ball room where the party was to be held. The room was grand, with plenty of tables and couches, so that the alpha’s guests could relax comfortably.
Dean did as he was told, offering his slick entrance to the alpha’s greedy gaze. “Does it look okay?”
When the paperwork was done the Alphas all stood and shook hands, agreeing that the two would start moving in their belongings the next day.
Dean was breathing hard as he slowly came down from his high, mind still processing what had just happened. He shivered as he felt gentle lips on his neck, soothing the fresh bite mark.
Dean hadn’t felt a hint of regret last night, and it had been a long night of so many knots. But in the light of day he couldn’t help but wonder what exactly it meant to be the property of a conservative alpha.
Dean pulled back, but the thick collar didn’t budge and the leash held strong. He looked around frantically, looking for anything that would help.
The alpha lead Dean by his leash over to a couch, as did several other alphas. Some had their own omegas, some helped themselves to Castiel’s omegas. Dean noticed Benny already leading Heather over to the couches, and the girl looked like she was trying to hide how pleased she was.
Dean could just barely see from his position as his alpha reached into his pocket and pulled out a small remote control. It had one switch with several settings on it, and Castiel slid it to the middle position.
“Come for me, pretty little bitch,” Benny growled, slamming his hips hard into Dean until his knot finally locked inside and he came with a long groan.
Dean smiled softly, feeling sleep start to tug at him. “Thank you, Alpha. I’m glad you found me. I’m lucky, too.”
The house was quiet and empty, there didn’t seem to be anyone else home. Dean realized he had no idea if Castiel already lived with other Alphas, and he was afraid to ask.
Dean grinned wide. “I was hoping we’d get there.”
Castiel went back to work, and Dean finally looked down at the piece of paper on Castiel’s desk. It was a guest list, and at the top was written “Dean’s coming out party.”
“Yes, that’s right,” Castiel said, trying not to stare at the little lock that secured Dean’s collar on his neck. It looked small and like it might be easy to break.
(See the end of the chapter for
Castiel eyed Dean eagerly. “You look perfect.” He put a hand on Dean’s stomach, enjoying the tight swell of it. “Some of the most powerful Alphas in town will be here tonight, and with you looking like this, they don’t stand a chance. They’re going to be fighting over my last three spots.”
“I’ve never seen such a desperate fuckhole!”
“So,” Balthazar started, sipping at his drink. “Tell us about your bitch use rules.”
“Um, hi,” Dean said, trying to come up with something to say. He’d made such a fool of himself earlier, now he felt completely tongue tied.
Dean was confused by what the alpha meant, until Castiel started to gently lower him, letting go and leaving Dean hanging from the knot still firmly tied inside him. It was pain and pleasure all rolled up together. His cries were muffled by the gag as he tried to put his hands down to brace himself against the floor, but with his small size and Castiel’s long legs, he couldn’t quite reach. He whimpered and squirmed, his cock throbbing at the strange pleasure, and he grabbed at Castiel’s pant legs.
Dean bit his lip in anticipation just before Benny’s thick cock drove in deep, filling him with one swift thrust. Dean’s hands gripped the couch tight as the Alpha started to pound into him, taking Dean and using him for his pleasure. Benny’s strong hands held Dean’s hips firmly, pulling him back to meet each hard thrust.
Castiel reminded the trio of his presence when he stood and moved closer to the bed. “You two seem to know how to handle a bitch, I’m satisfied you’ll take good care of him.” He reached out to run his hand affectionately through Dean’s hair. “Use him as long as you want, just bring him to my bed when you’re done.”
The rest of the hour passed with tense silence, the scent of mutual arousal hanging in the air. When the bell finally rang, Castiel let out a long breath, eager to remove himself from the worst temptation he’d ever known.
Castiel hit a button on his bike to open the garage door just as he put the bike into gear with a roar. Behind him Benny started his own bike, and they were off, leaving the garage door to close automatically behind them.
Dean whimpered around the gag, squirming and pushing his ass back against the plug. He just couldn’t help himself, the stimulation felt so good, his body so pleased for any pleasure his mates offered him. Even if the manner of it was rather humiliating.
Another sharp smack landed on Dean’s backside and the omega yelped, then quickly repeated his phrase, “I’m sorry, Alpha, please give me another!”
“Not yet,” Castiel said, finally gripping Dean’s hips in his hands and thrusting up into the omega, slapping against his ass as his knot grew bigger. “Okay baby doll, come for me.”
“Okay, go clean yourself up and get back to bed, you need to rest.” Castiel said with a smile. “When you wake up I’m going to have a surprise for you.”
Castiel smiled and ran a hand through Dean’s hair. “I wouldn’t have it any other way.” He pressed a warm kiss to Dean’s forehead, making the omega smile even as his face burned red from the Alphas’ comments.
Castiel smiled at Benny. “We’ve been working on something this morning. Dean, introduce yourself to Benny.”
Castiel lead Dean to a stunning black and chrome vintage motorcycle. Dean noticed it was a two seater and it had two helmets sitting on it.
“Excuse me, Dr. Novak,” Dean said, interrupting the stillness of the room. “May I please ask you a question?”
Benny’s warning about the hose rang in Dean’s ear, and he was already shivering from the chilly air, so he realized he had to do as he was told. He looked down at himself, wincing at the sight of his cock enclosed in the cage. His whole body burned with embarrassment as he lifted his right leg into the air, and it did indeed help point his caged cock away from his body.
Dean was breathing hard, eyes wide with fear as he looked back and forth between the two men.
“What!” Dean gasped out, trying to pull himself away. “No, I need to go home!”
Dean looked crestfallen as he stood and pulled up his pants, but he nodded and gave Castiel a quiet “Yes, Sir” before going back to his desk.
“Yes, about that,” Castiel said, leaning in to press a lingering kiss to Dean’s lips. “You are going to call me
Dean slowly woke to Castiel’s deep voice and a gentle hand running through his hair. He lifted his head and looked up at the alpha, still sleepy.
Castiel nodded, continuing to tease the cute little cock, brushing it with his fingers before gently grasping it and tugging. “Castrated omegas usually can’t quite get fully hard, you should be enjoying this, but it wouldn’t be able to give you an orgasm. Does it feel good, Dean?”
Dean shook his head, finding the movement sluggish in the heavy helmet.
Castiel and Benny left him there as they started to make dinner. Any time they passed him by they pet his head.
He realizes that’s a little silly, considering how many times his new alpha knotted him during his heat. He’d lost track and wasn’t even sure how many days it had been.
“Do you need to be fucked harder, little bitch?” Castiel teased. “Tell me what you need, pretty fuckhole.”
This couldn’t be happening. Dean wanted to fight, to run. But he couldn’t. A simple leash had him firmly under control, they didn’t even need to use any locks, all the gear was just simple buckles. He tried to grab at the gag in his mouth, but he could literally only paw at it.
Castiel was still fucking him, knot stretching his rim open wide. His hips slapped hard against Dean’s ass until finally he forced his knot inside with one last thrust and came with a growl.
“Please,” he gasped out, too far gone for anything more. “Please Alpha, please!”
Dean kept himself a step behind his Alpha so he could tuck in behind him. It made him feel safe and submissive, especially with Benny’s warm presence behind him. The bouncer at the door gave Dean an appraising look as he let them in.
Dean moaned, arching up into Castiel’s hand. “Yes, yes Daddy!” he gasped out. The light humiliation of it only heightening his pleasure.
.” His voice was firm, leaving no doubt that it was anything other than an order.
When they finally made it to Daddy’s office Dean was relieved. Everything would be better once he was in his special carrier, it always made Dean feel better.
The three boys did their business, then suddenly perked up and went running off to the right, and Cas had to step out the back door to see what they were after.
“I’m taking what’s mine,” Castiel said, pulling Dean up on his knees, leaving his face pressed to the couch so that his ass was pushed up in the air.
“Yours,” Dean gasped out, moaning as he felt the alpha’s cock start to grow. “Please, alpha, please!” he begged mindlessly, his mind a blur from the intense pleasure of the knot swelling inside him.
“Good puppy.” Castiel stopped to pet Dean’s head before looping Dean’s leash around the pantry room door.
It wasn’t that he was starting to
Castiel came loping into the courtyard in wolf form, and Dean dropped quickly to his hands and knees, whimpering like a submissive puppy as his alpha came close. He nuzzled his nose into Castiel’s neck and under his chin, just as he had been taught to do. He then dropped all the way to the ground and rolled onto his back, offering himself in complete submission to the wolf.
Dean climbed on behind Castiel and pressed himself tight against the Alpha’s back. He wound his arms around his mate’s waist and held tight. “Is this good, Alpha?”
Dean worked Benny’s cock with expert attention, until he finally felt the knot start to swell inside his mouth. He moaned as it filled him, he always loved being full at both ends, he only wished it were his alpha’s knot in his ass instead of a plug.
Castiel let Dean work his cock for a few minutes, before he decided he was tired of standing. “On the floor,” he ordered, pulling his omega off his cock and moving to sit in the nearby chair. He leaned back and closed his eyes, knowing Dean would follow. Only a moment later he felt the omega’s mouth on his cock again, and he let out a pleased sigh as he settled in to enjoy his omega.
Dean blushed a little brighter and smiled. “I guess the presentation went pretty well?”
“Yes you are,” Benny agreed with a groan. His knot finally caught inside the rim of Dean’s ass and the Alpha was forced to switch to short, hard thrusts. “Come on my knot, little bitch,” he growled.
Later that day, Castiel did as he promised, heading out in search of an omega for the pack. Hoping he’d be returning with a mate, he chose to leave his motorcycle at home and take his Jag instead. The car deserved to be driven more often anyway.
Castiel’s strong hands gripped Dean’s hips, starting to guide him up and down the length. “Slower,” he ordered, just as a few of his guests made their way over.
Castiel growled softly in his sleep, waking to the scent of the new Alphas on his mate. He woke as he roughly shoved Dean on his back. “Mine,” he snarled.
“That’s my good fuckhole,” Castiel praised, pulling Dean’s face in for a deep kiss. His tongue pushed inside and explored, tangling with Dean’s before the Alpha pulled back.
Dean watched in shock as Cas screwed a large nipple onto the bottle. It was shaped like a small cock.
Dean moaned as the alpha continued to administer his spanking, the broad hand landing perfectly with each strike. “Ooh yes, Alpha! I’m sorry, Alpha!” He whimpered, the pain in his backside mingling with the intense need in his body, causing a steady stream of slick to run from his ready hole.
Balthazar let out a low whistle. “That’s fantastic.”
Castiel couldn’t help but stop and watch for a minute. As annoying as Dean was, the alpha couldn’t deny that he was sex on legs. Today he was wearing an old black teeshirt and an obscenely short pair of cut off jeans, so short that the cheeks of his ass peaked out the bottom.
“Thank you Alpha,” Dean mumbled, foggy from pleasure.
Castiel drove fast, and it was only a couple minutes before he was pulling into a multi car garage attached to a huge house. The Alpha jumped out of the car, hurrying around to help Dean out of the passenger seat.
All thoughts of arguing or fighting flew from Dean’s mind as Castiel started to fuck him. He could only moan and pushed his ass back to meet the alpha’s rough, claiming strokes, the huge cock filling him with each thrust.
Dean couldn’t argue, he could only whimper and bare his neck for the alpha, offering himself. His cock was hard and his hole was leaking, his entire body ready to be taken by the man holding him.
“I’m not taking you just as my mate,” Castiel said, seriously. “I’m building a pack of seven Alphas. If you choose to come with me, you will be our bitch.”
Castiel smiled, wide and genuine. “I was happy to.”
After a few minutes of this teasing, Castiel grew tired and pulled a blanket over them both. They drifted off together into a light sleep, Dean only waking for a moment when he felt Castiel’s cock soften and slip free, then he drifted back to sleep.
Dean started to lose track after his body couldn’t come anymore, his whole world a blur of pleasure and huge knots. They just kept coming, one right after the other, and Dean could only moan and take it.
“Damn, he’s gorgeous, how much did you pay?” Benny asked. He ran his hands around to grope at Dean’s round ass, making the omega blush, despite knowing the Alpha was soon going to do much more.
“It certainly does,” Castiel agreed, smiling fondly at Dean.
“There we go, I knew there was a good little omega in there,” Castiel said, slowing down the pace of the spanking and easing up a little on the force of it. “I’m going to mold you into my perfect little breeder, just what I always wanted.”
Castiel groaned as he finally slammed in deep, burying his knot inside Dean, come spilling inside him. Dean let out a weak moan as he felt the warmth of his new mate’s seed steadily fill his belly.
“Jerk,” Sam snapped back, before moving around to the passenger side door.
Sam just shook his head, clearly amazed. “Well it’s fantastic! And I’m going to be an uncle!” He sounded so excited all of a sudden, as if he’d just realized that fact. “When is he due?”
“No, I’m well above average,” Castiel growled, clenching his fists as he fought to restrain himself. “You’ve had your look, now put it away.”
Dean nodded. “I… I think I’d like that,” he whispered.
Dean frowned. “Bartender?”
Sam shot him a look of complete exasperation. “You don’t take fertility supplements, Dean!”
“Present for your new pack Alphas, bitch,” Castiel ordered.
Castiel smiled and shook his head. “Trust me, it will be more fun at The Hole.”
Dean’s face burned. “Yes, Daddy, I’m sorry.” He swallowed, knowing what his alpha wanted to hear. “You’re going to need to punish me, Daddy.” He still couldn’t look at Sam.
Only the best for his omega.
Dean gasped when the movement made the plug shift in his hole, but he followed his Alpha obediently.
“This isn’t my usual ride,” Castiel said as he got in the car. “Or style, either,” he added, looking down at his expensive suit. “But you’ll learn more about that later.” The Alpha turned to Dean, taking his chin in hand to make him look him in the eye. “I have something very important to tell you. I need you to be okay with it. Want it. Otherwise you can stay here and take your chances on the streets.”
Dean let out a gasp as he was quickly bent over the breakfast table, and had just a moment to think they shouldn’t have bothered with the plug at all when the Alpha quickly tugged it out and slammed his hard cock in it’s place.
Dean yelped at the smack, his face burning as he slowly climbed back up to his hands and knees. ‘Studs’ rang in his ears and his whole body burned as the dogs jostled to sniff his hole, still so tender from his heat.
“Nothing other than your collar, which I will have made for you as soon as possible.” Castiel smiled. “Strip the rest of the way for me.”
Dean’s head spun as he felt the alpha yank down his pants, letting them drop to the floor, revealing his straining cock to the room. He felt Castiel’s hand on his ass, and suddenly there was a hard cock teasing at his entrance, the layers of clothes between them long gone. Slick ran down the inside of Dean’s legs as his body did it’s best to prepare him for what was about to happen.
Dean bit his lip and nodded. “Good Alphas punish their omegas when they do bad things,” he said, repeating the explanation he’d heard since he was young. “Omegas need to be controlled and they need to be punished when they’re bad. A good Alpha gives their omega what they need.”
Dean moaned as he was fucked hard again, used by another alpha for the simple pleasure he could offer. Both alphas took their turn with him, in the end leaving Dean slumped over the counter as he waited out Balthazar’s knot. He hadn’t even had the mind to ask to come, and his little cock was straining hard against the kitchen counter.
It wasn’t a long ride before they were in the city, and after a few blocks Castiel slowed and pulled up to an unassuming looking parking garage. The two Alphas stopped at the security guard who only had to glance at them before waving them inside. The garage was full of expensive cars and motorcycles, and Castiel and Benny parked theirs together near the door that Dean assumed lead into the bar.
The two Alphas chatted about their moving plans as if Dean weren’t even there, waiting for their knots to go down. When they were finally able to slip free of Dean’s body, Gadreel made sure to replace the plug, keeping the second round of seed secure.
The three boys reluctantly pulled away from Dean, following the alphas orders and heading out to the back yard. Castiel closed the door behind them, and Dean watched the dogs go investigate the spot where he’d peed. He blushed and turned away.
A grin slowly spread across Benny’s face. “I know where he hides his spare key. The next time he goes into heat we can simply let ourselves in.” He pulled Cas back towards the house. “Come on, we’ve got some planning to do, we’re going to need to buy some supplies.”
It wasn’t until they arrived at the hospital the Dean found out his new mate was a doctor. He was pretty sure his whole body was blushing as Castiel carried him in through the front lobby, still naked and impaled on the alpha’s knot.
“Okay little boy, time for sleep,” Castiel mumbled, reaching to pull the blanket up to cover them. “Pleasant dreams sweetheart.”
Benny groaned and pulled Dean off the table so he could sit down in the chair behind him, bringing Dean with him to sit impaled on his cock.
The fast pace made the Alpha’s knots fill quickly, and Dean moaned pathetically as Castiel’s thrusts teased his prostate mercilessly. He desperately wanted to come, but knew he wouldn’t be allowed, and he was glad the cock in his mouth prevented him from losing control and begging.
“That’s a good puppy, come on, step up,” Castiel said, giving the leash a gentle tug.
“Well, Castiel,” Balthazar said. “If you’ll have us, we would be honored to join your pack.”
Dean blushed but did as he was told, lapping at the cabinet until it was clean.
“I think you can be more convincing,” Castiel said, starting to slowly stroke Dean’s cock. “Tell me how good you are.”
Dean closed his eyes and let out a needy whine. “Yes.”
Castiel groaned into Dean’s hair. “Not during bath time, Dean,” he said, reluctantly. “We’ll get stuck in here and be all pruney by the time my knot goes down.” His hand trailed down to push a finger inside Dean’s hole. “You’ll just have to be a good boy and wait.”
Castiel nodded. “It would be your job to please them, although your use will be strictly under my control, they will have to ask my permission to fuck you. That way I can ensure you don’t get used up.”
The alpha continued to slam into Dean until his cock finally started to swell, and it was the rough drag of the knot across Dean’s prostate that made the omega come with a scream, his own mess contained in the front of his pants. He could only whimper as he came down from his orgasm just as the man slammed into him and tied them together, the stranger’s knot swelling inside him, his come steadily filling him.
“You smell ready,” Castiel commented, hands running down Dean’s face and chest, making the omega shiver. He unzipped his hoody and pushed it aside, admiring the way Dean’s teeshirt clung to his lean chest. “You’re perfect. Absolutely perfect.”
Dean moaned and nodded. “Y-yes, it feels good.”
Dean let out a little whimper, but didn’t stop Castiel. “Is that normal?”
The omega girl appeared quickly. “Yes, alpha?” Her eyes flicked to Dean, still nursing Castiel’s cock, and the alpha didn’t miss the look of jealousy.
Dean’s stomach fluttered with excitement, and he quickly dropped to his knees between his alpha’s open legs. He carefully opened Castiel’s pants and pulled out his half hard cock, taking it into his mouth. It rested heavily on his tongue, and he couldn’t help the pleased little hum at the feeling.
Suddenly that thick cock shoved it’s way inside Dean, and the omega cried out as he was filled with one firm thrust. His mouth hung open and he moaned as the huge cock paused, letting him adjust to being so full, before he pulled out and slammed back in, quickly setting a claiming pace.
Dean quickly scrambled up, dropping his face and shoulders to the bed, but staying up on his knees so that his ass would be up in the air. He reached back and gripped his cheeks in his hands, just as Castiel had demanded the night before, and spread himself open. Slick was already leaking from his ready hole.
“Come on sweetheart,” Benny cajoled, using his leg to gently push Dean away from the door. “Just get it over and done with, you’ll feel so much better.”
“That’s wonderful,” Sam said, beaming. “I do hope you keep him well bred, it suits him.”
“Hey Brother, can I knot the bitch before I go to work?” Benny asked, eyeing Dean eagerly.
And then Dean had to just sit there, full to the hilt but not being fucked. Dean’s legs dangling off either side of the chair, and he wrapped his arms around his Alpha’s waist. It was a strange feeling, and he realized this really was what it meant to be a cock sleeve, which was both embarrassing and more than a little exciting. His ass twitched eagerly around Castiel’s thick cock.
Normally that would have sent Dean running for the hills, he had sworn his whole life that he wasn’t going to be some knot head’s bitch.
Dean moaned as the pleasure built inside him, his cock straining inside his cage. All thoughts of escape slipped from his mind in the face of it, and he couldn’t even bring himself to care about how humiliating it was to be given pleasure like this. All he wanted was more, to be able to come.
“You got it, Brother,” Benny said with a grin, pulling Dean out of the room and down the hall.
Dean’s little cock gave an excited twitch as he hurried to obey. This was quickly becoming more than just a way out of a ticket, he
“God look how his ass moves…”
Castiel looked down at the tiny omega squirming on his cock, and he was startled to see a small bump appear on the omega’s belly each time he drove into the boy. He reached out to touch it and realized he was touching his own cock, and he let out a long moan at the implication. He drew his cock back and thrust in hard again, groaning as he felt the pressure of his hand from inside Dean.
It felt like being claimed all over again and Dean loved it.
Benny barked a laugh. “That’s fantastic! God he looks good like that.”
Benny laughed. “I don’t think you’ll have a problem providing that, I know I won’t.”
Still no major beast action yet, I'll warn you before we get there.
Eventually, Castiel’s claiming instincts started to fade, and they both slept several hours into the late evening. They would have slept through the night, where it not for the sound of Benny coming home from work, late after an evening shift.
Dean blushed and nodded silently, moving quickly to his Alpha. Castiel put down his pen and slid his rolling chair back from the desk. His cock was clearly hard, tenting the front of the Alpha’s pants, and he looked up at Dean expectantly, making it clear the omega was to help himself.
“I’m going to watch,” Castiel said seriously. “I want to make sure you can take appropriate care of him and follow my rules. We’ve already discussed the consequences of breaking them, I want to make sure you can be trusted with my mate.”
Castiel’s hand finally stopped, and the next thing Dean felt was a thick cock teasing down the cleft of his ass, just barely pressing against his slick entrance. “Maybe you need to be owned, little omega. Do you need a big strong Alpha who can keep you in line? Fuck you when you’re good and punish you when you’re bad? Is that what you need, little omega?”
Dean gasped when he felt the thick head of the alpha’s cock touch his wet entrance, then quickly start to press inside. He could no longer remember why he’d tried to run from this man, all he knew now was the intense instinct to submit to his new alpha. To let the man take whatever he wanted. Dean could only moan as the thick cock filled him and started to thrust.
After Dean drained the bottle he was left where he was, leash still looped around the pantry door handle. The bone shaped gag was back in place, rubber cock filling his mouth. Dean had tried to paw it off again, but it was entirely useless. He finally let out a frustrated sigh and gave up, letting his mouth relax around the cock.
Dean did as he was told, standing in front of the Alpha, but he kept his eyes down submissively. He could feel a little slick soaking into his jeans.
Dean whined and spread his legs, pushing his ass back eagerly for his Alpha. He moaned when he felt Castiel’s thick length press inside him, and soon his mate was thrusting slow and steady, enjoying the lazy pace of morning sex. Dean whimpered, needing more, needing to be taken and filled.
It seemed to be working, the alpha shifted uncomfortably, desire rolling off his strong body. “I’m going to have to give you a ticket.”
Dean started to scream, the sounds muffled by the gag.
Finally the knot was almost too big, and with one last, forceful thrust, Castiel buried his knot inside Dean. The Alpha’s movements became sharp and shallow, jerking his knot back and forth across Dean’s prostate, and suddenly Dean was coming with a howl, clenching down hard on the Alpha’s knot. Castiel grunted in surprise and with one last thrust he came, knot buried deep and spilling the Alpha’s seed in Dean’s channel. He slumped into Dean’s back and finally released the bite on Dean’s neck.
Dean knelt in between his alpha’s legs and unzipped his slacks, pulling out his already hard cock. He quickly took it into his mouth, starting to suck and lick just the way he knew Castiel liked it. He did his best to focus on his training, remembering how Castiel’s firm hand had guided him the first time.
Dean whimpered, but tried to do as he was told, letting his arms hang loose. As he relaxed the position became less uncomfortable, the strange pleasure of it thrumming through him. He felt a little light headed from the position, but it actually wasn’t so bad. His cock was still throbbing with need, but he was learning to ignore it.
The two Alphas carefully arranged themselves to sit cross-legged on the bed, leaving Dean sprawled out between them, speared on their knots. Dean only whimpered a little as he was arranged more comfortably, then dropped back into happy submission.
He didn’t sound angry at all, and Dean finally looked up at his brother, and was surprised to see he looked more awed than angry.
Dean’s face burned red as he took in Castiel’s shockingly calm words, and he was embarrassed to feel his little cock twitch in response to being called a ‘fuckhole.’ He cleared his throat and ducked his head. “Yes, Alpha,” he mumbled nervously.
Dean held Castiel’s hand tight as they walked into the office, and he kept himself tucked half behind the alpha’s strong arm. He didn’t like talking to the other alphas, they all gave him funny looks. So when Daddy stopped to talk to them he’d hide his face and pretend they couldn’t see him. This would only make them laugh and talk about how cute he was.
“Okay, on your feet,” Balthazar said, helping Dean up. Gadreel watched from the arm chair with a sated expression. “Go to Castiel.”
Dean whimpered, pushing his ass down to the bed, wild eyes watching the dogs fearfully. They were so much bigger from his new position.
He stayed like this until he suddenly started to feel Castiel’s knot give. But before he could slip off and hit the floor, Cas scooped him back up and turned around to find a clear spot on the counter. He laid Dean out on his stomach, already grinding gently inside him as his knot deflated.
Dean ducked his eyes to the table as he sat, face burning. “Yes, Daddy.” He couldn’t bring himself to look at Sam, didn’t want to know what his brother thought of him now.
“Did you have a good day, baby boy?” Castiel asked with a smile, pressing a kiss to Dean’s forehead. “You ready to go home?”
Dean came hard with a cry, come shooting out in spurts onto the table in front of him. He groaned through the orgasm and then slumped back into Castiel’s chest.
“What are you doing?” Dean asked, trying to squirm away, but one hand on his sore ass was all it took to make him go still. He whimpered submissively and pushed his ass up in offering. He couldn’t help it, the alpha hadn’t even claimed him yet, but Dean already knew who he belonged to. His burning ass wasn’t going to let him forget anytime soon.
Dean gasped when his ass was suddenly exposed, and his face burned as he thought of how it must look to the passing cars, but he couldn’t help the quiver of excitement and the trickle of slick that escaped his hole.
Dean’s pleasure hazed eye’s cracked open and he licked the come off his lips as he looked at the two new Alphas. “I’m Castiel’s bitch, I’m an obedient and eager fuckhole.” The words rolled easily off his tongue, all the shame had been fucked out of him.
Castiel groaned. “That’s it, my good little fuckhole, you like sucking cock, don’t you?” His hands came down and gripped Dean’s hair, guiding him up and down his shaft.
Castiel groaned as he slammed into him and still, his seed spilling once more. “Do not take this off without permission,” he ordered, fingering the cock ring nestled behind Dean’s balls. “You came plenty during your heat, I don’t want to spoil you. Going to train you into my perfect mate.”
Until he saw the small crowd of employees on the other side of the glass wall, and Dean  could only blush and look away, unable to hide himself from their curious eyes.
Gadreel seemed to realize what Dean wanted. “Come on our knots, little fuckhole,” he growled.
Dean’s heart jumped nervously as he was tugged across the room and gently pushed under the breakfast table. He was surprised to find a pillow on the floor there, and he realized it was probably there for this very purpose as he knelt on it. Castiel pulled out a chair and sat down, before unzipping his fly and tugging out his hard cock. It was suddenly right in Dean’s face and it seemed so much bigger from his place on the floor.
“Okay boys, he’s all yours. I’ll be in my office, he’ll probably need a nap when you’re done with him, so put him to bed when you’re finished with him.” Castiel stood and pressed a gentle kiss to Dean’s lips and ran a soothing hand through his hair. “Be a good bitch for me, my little omega,” he ordered.
Dean spent dinner on a plush pillow at his alpha’s feet, silently submissive and enjoying every bite of food he was fed. When the meal was finished he felt his little cock twitch with excitement as Castiel helped him to his feet, knowing what would happen next.
Dean let out a nervous whimper but nodded. “Yes, Alpha.”
Dean’s breath caught when he heard footsteps approaching him. Then suddenly there were expensive shoes in his line of sight, stopping right in front of him. Dean flinched when his hood was gently pulled back, and he looked up at the Alpha with wide eyes.
Castiel sat down on the couch and pulled his hard cock out of his slacks, which quickly sprang to life. “Okay baby doll, come get your knot,” he said, patting his lap.
They pulled up to a large house, and the next thing Dean knew he was being marched up to the front door. The blanket was pulled away and he was left standing there full nude, but the heat had flared up again so he wasn’t cold.
Castiel reached around and roughly yanked down Dean’s pants, leaving the omega’s ass suddenly bare. “If you want to be fucked so bad, put your ass in the air and see who comes to fill it.”
One of the dogs, the german shepherd, snuck into the kitchen to investigate the food. But he was quickly shooed out again.
Suddenly the omega’s hand shot out and ran down the length of Castiel’s cock where it tented his slacks, and the alpha gasped at the sudden flair of pleasure.
Dean didn’t pay his brother any mind, his focus was entirely on pleasing his alpha.
Dean whimpered and moaned, trying to push back against the growing cock, but unable to with his face pressed to the bed. He still couldn’t understand the way his body responded to such rough treatment, he just knew it felt good. He panted desperately as the pleasure grew, pushing him closer and closer to the edge, until Benny’s hard knot filled and slammed into him, and Dean came with a cry.
Dean let out a little whimper, but quickly caved and curled up on the bed. This was his life now, there was really no reason to fight it.
Dean’s face bloomed bright red as he realized his alpha was going to take him out into public this way. And there was nothing he could do about it.
Benny smiled and rubbed Dean’s back, waving Castiel out of the room. “Our sweet little bitch is happy to be so used up, aren’t you sweetheart?”
“Such an impatient little boy,” Castiel chuckled. He walked over to his desk as he unhooked the straps at his shoulders, letting him lay Dean down on his back without removing the omega from the carrier. The carrier still attached them at Castiel’s hips, which left Dean’s ass at just the right level.
Dean was horrified as the pleasure grew more intense with each pass, and as he felt the animals massive knot bump against his entrance, he realized where this was going. When the wolf’s knot finally forced its way inside him Dean howled as his orgasm was forced out of him, his body singing to finally have his first knot.
“No, it’s too much!” Dean gasped out, trying to push Castiel’s hands away from his cock.  He let out a long moan, tears running from his eyes, overwhelmed by the overstimulation.
Dean frowned but didn’t argue with Daddy. Talking back to Daddy got Dean a spanking and he didn’t want one.
“That will be pups, some day soon,” he murmured.
A sharp smack suddenly landed on Dean’s ass and the omega yelped and arched his back, pushing his ass back just in time to receive the second one. The alpha’s hand landed heavily on his tender backside, and Dean realized this was going to be a real punishment, not just a playful smack or two. The realization made his whole body burn with desire.
Dean blushed and nodded, climbing off Castiel’s lap and heading up stairs to go back to sleep.
Dean crawled a little faster, glad for the pads protecting his knees as they crossed onto the hard kitchen floor.
Dean eagerly flipped over on his face, getting up on his knees and thrusting his plugged ass up high. They would make him come, Castiel had told them to, and god did Dean ever want it. It had only been a couple hours since he was last knotted, but he wanted it, needed it.
“I’ll be in my office,” Castiel said, standing up and pushing in his chair. “If you tire of him, bring him to me, I want that belly full and I don’t want to waist any downtime between knots.” With that he made his way out of the room.
“And I’m also pretty sure you’ve been lying to me,” Castiel said, taking his seat next to Dean. He was speaking loud enough for the whole table to hear. “About Sam being too busy. Is that true, baby?”
“Dean,” he replied softly, biting his lip.
Castiel smiled as he stepped into the living room, finding Dean just where he’d left him. The omega was stretched out on his chaise lounge chair, partially buried under a pile of white furs, deep asleep. Castiel could see his beautiful pink collar, studded with diamonds and complete with satin bow on the front.
Dean lost track of time again, until he felt both knots start to pull free. Benny pulled out of his mouth, and Dean’s mouth fell open, before it was quickly filled again, this time with a thick, cock shaped gag. He closed his eyes and automatically started to suck on the gag with a pleased hum, letting his head droop low. He gasped a little when he felt Castiel’s cock slip free, then let out a pleased moan as he felt the plug push back into place.
Dean made the decision without even thinking about it, and he twisted in his seat to make sure the officer could see his trim waist and the curve of his hip. It’d been a while since he got laid and a knot was better than a ticket any day. “I’m very sorry, Sir, I had no idea I was going so fast,” he said, voice soft and submissive. He looked down and then up again at the cute cop, peering up through his eyelashes. “But I know that’s no excuse. Are you going to have to… punish me?” He could feel his cheeks burning, an honest response to his own behavior, but it only added to the effect.
Castiel groaned softly, running his hand through Dean’s hair. “What a good boy,” he said, gently thrusting up into the omega’s mouth. He picked up the first book from the pile and started to read.
So Dean had spent the morning wondering the streets aimlessly. He knew by night he’d have to find a safe place to sleep, but for now he was just trying to keep a low profile and avoid people who would scent him and his status. His feet were getting tired from walking, so he found a mostly empty parking lot and sat down against a tree in the back corner.
Dean’s whole body was buzzing with need, but he forced himself to relax and enjoy the Alphas’ knots. He continued to swallow Benny’s seed as he felt Castiel fill him from behind.
With his face pressed to Castiel’s lap, it left Dean bent over the plush chair, and he knew the glittering plug was fully visible.
One minute Dean had been cruising down the road in the Impala, blasting AC/DC, then the next thing he knew there was a blaring siren behind him.
“Yes! Please Alpha!” Dean gasped out desperately. “Please let me come!”
Castiel just smiled and brought the ring down to Dean’s little cock, sliding it over and down the shaft.
Dean felt himself start to panic, and he tried to stand up, only to be quickly yanked back down by a painful tug on his cock. Whimpering, he looked down at himself. He was horrified to see his cock was secured in a cage, and there was a light but strong chain running from the cage to cuffs on his ankles. There was enough slack to allow him to crawl, but not enough to let him stand.
Dean shrugged. “So?”
The consequence was expulsion from the pack and possible criminal charges if serious harm came to Dean. But Castiel had made sure to clarify that rough sex was absolutely encouraged.
Dean was breathing hard as his orgasm faded, and he realized the alpha had stilled, and he moaned as he felt the full knot pulse inside him. He realized he was being filled with the alpha’s seed, and he let out a little moan at the thought.
Castiel lay across Dean’s back for a moment, catching his breath, before he finally stood, still tied to the omega.
After a while he started to feel a fullness in his bladder, and he realized that his “dinner” was passing through him. He realized he didn’t know what to do about that, with his mouth gagged he couldn’t exactly ask to use the bathroom.
“Oh, I heard that,” Castiel said with a chuckle, putting down his book. He was sitting on the couch, and he looked over at Dean. “Are you hungry, puppy?”
Dean was a true trophy omega, and he loved it.
“Later baby doll, I promise,” Castiel said with a warm smile. “First we need to greet our guests and get you something to eat.”
Dean whimpered, his body responding to the Alpha’s words. “Yes, Alpha.”
He loved being a good bitch.
That was finally as much as Castiel could take, and he snapped and grabbed Dean, spinning him around and picking him up in one smooth motion, laying him out on his back on the desk.
“Would you like some dinner, Dean?” the older man asked, looking at Dean expectantly.
Dean frowned a little at the nickname, confused, but he was asleep before he could think about it any further.
with him?
Dean wasn’t paying much attention, all of his focus was going to trying to keeping his alpha’s cock in his mouth, a surprisingly difficult task with little bolts of pleasure racing up his spine. He didn’t even try to stop the desperate little sounds that kept escaping his throat, he could tell by his alpha’s gentle hand in his hair that Castiel didn’t mind. He could feel himself slipping into a haze of pleasure and submission, all thoughts of the upcoming party out of his head.
Dean moaned into his alpha’s neck as the new alpha’s hips slapped against his bare ass with each pounding thrust. This man was even bigger than the last, and when his knot started to swell he was sure it would split him open. But he couldn’t help the blinding pleasure, and soon he was coming hard again, hanging off yet another knot.
Today he was subbing at the omega school for the very first time. The school was a middle and high school combination that served exclusively presented omegas, giving their families a safer environment where they’d be less likely to be claimed.
When Castiel and Dean eventually made it down to breakfast, Dean was a little hazy from the low burn of need. Castiel had cleaned him up from the previous day, so for once Dean’s plugged ass was empty of Alpha seed and his naked body was fresh and clean. His face burned bright red with embarrassment as Castiel lead him into the kitchen, as his little cock was still hard and proudly begging for attention.
When the walked through the front door, Dean was hit hard with an intoxicating smell. The next thing he noticed was a very handsome man at the front counter. He exuded an aura of calm and strength.
Dean whimpered and squirmed as the knot pushed in deeper, and he tried to relax back against the Alpha’s strong chest. He looked up to see Castiel smiling at him across the table; his Alpha looked quite proud.
Dean couldn’t see Castiel’s face, but he didn’t need to see it to obey his Alpha, and he opened his mouth and eagerly took the thick cock inside, starting to suck immediately. Dean had never had a cock in his mouth before, and he was surprised to feel his body reacting to it. His own little dick was slowly getting hard, and he could feel himself getting wet. He sucked a little harder and tried to take the cock deeper, suddenly wanting more of it.
Dean found himself leaning against the couch and resting his face on Benny’s knee, little whimpers and moans continuing to escape him as the milking continued. Finally when his body had nothing left to give, Castiel’s hand stilled and he patted Dean on the ass.
Castiel’s voice echoed in from the other room. “Come on boys, inside!”
a good bitch.
“It turns you on,” Castiel said, dropping his lips to Dean’s ear. “You’re going to have to call me Daddy in front of people, too. Does that turn you on?”
Above the table Benny groaned around a mouthful of food, one hand slipping under the table to grip Dean’s hair. He continued to eat his breakfast while Dean chased his.
Dean smiled and glowed at the praise, thrilled to have pleased his mate. He would happily give up ever being allowed to come ever again, if it was what his Alpha wanted.
Castiel grinned, pushing the covers back so he could trail kisses down Dean’s body, peppering several across the omega’s flat belly. “Very soon I will be filling you up with my pups, so it’s only appropriate.” He moved back up to look Dean in the eye, alpha command thick in his deep voice. “So any time you speak to me, you’re to call me Daddy. Do you understand?”
“Dean is back to normal today,” Castiel said, taking his seat at the table and pulling Dean down on his lap. “He’s done with his fucktoy lesson, so you’re allowed to let him come, if you want to. He’s already come once this morning, haven’t you, my good little bitch?” he said, smiling fondly at Dean.
“You can strip him down for me,” Castiel said to the Alphas, letting go of Dean’s hand. “His clothes go in the hall closet.”
“Stop complaining,” Castiel snapped, grabbing Dean’s wrists in one hand and pinning them above his head. “This is just what little sluts like you deserve,” he said, hips snapping as he drove in harder, his other hand still tugging on Dean’s cock. “You should have known that when you decided to seduce your teacher.”
Dean gasped when he felt the thick, blunt top of the plug press against his entrance. He let out a small whimper as Castiel pushed it slowly up and in, waiting for Dean’s rim to stretch and take the thick toy inside. Dean grasped at Castiel’s arm and moaned as he was forced open and the plug finally popped in, letting his rim clamp back down around the narrow base. Dean was overwhelmed for a moment by the fullness in his channel. The toy wasn’t as big as a knot, but it was big enough to make Dean wish that it was a knot instead.
Dean felt like he was floated as he felt his stomach swell a little further, and he let out a soft whine as he felt Castiel’s hand come around to gently stroke his belly.
“Take him for me please, Benny,” Castiel said, gently pushing Dean towards the other Alpha. “I’ve got to call the caterers and he’s quite the distraction in this state,” he said with a chuckle. “Do give him a short break before you knot him next, he’s pretty worn out.”
Dean whimpered as the spanking continued and he started to feel his body responding to the alpha. His little cock was getting hard, pressing against the alpha’s leg, and slick was slowly running from his hole. His body knew what was coming next, and it wanted the alpha.
The alpha grinned, hooking Dean by the back of his neck and pulling him into the house. “Thank you, he’s perfect,” he said, absently speaking to John without taking his eyes off Dean.
“Thank you,” Castiel replied, sounding quite pleased.
Benny finally unclipped the leash. “Okay pup, go potty.”
Castiel helped Dean into the jacket, which was short enough that it left a couple inches of skin showing between the bottom of it and the top of the shorts. Dean could only imagine how he looked in this get up, with his bare legs and ass hanging out the back. He really did look like a true bitch, and Dean couldn’t decide if he was humiliated by the outfit or in love with it.
Suddenly Dean realized he could feel Castiel’s knot growing inside him, and he groaned as it started to fill him. Each thrust of the Alpha’s cock stretched his rim wider, forcing Castiel to fuck into him harder with each stroke just to get it inside, the Alpha’s hips and balls slapping against Dean’s ass. Dean let out a sound that was half moan and half grunt with each stroke. Castiel still had the skin of Dean’s neck between his teeth, and he growled into the bite as he fucked him.
In spite of how humiliating it was to be praised like a dog, Dean felt himself relax into the affection, relieved that his alpha wasn’t upset with him anymore. He couldn’t help the happy butterflies in his stomach, his body naturally responding to his mate’s praise.
Dean whimpered a little when his Alpha pulled away and left the room, but was quickly calmed by focusing on nursing the knot in his mouth. The feeling of being steadily filled by the Alphas’ seed was strangely relaxing.
