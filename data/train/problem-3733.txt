There is a hint of annoyance in his tone and Dean opens his mouth to bite back, but his sarcastic denial dies on his lips when he looks back at his brother and sees not anger or pity but genuine sympathy. He shrugs one shoulder. ‘Guess you’re right,’ he looks back out of the window. ‘Still kinda missing the whiskey though.’
Dean drops two Tylenol tablets into his hand. “Take these, they’ll help you feel a bit less shitty,” he says. Cas looks at them carefully before putting them in his mouth and taking a mouthful of water. He swallows awkwardly and them makes a face and takes another mouthful of water, tilting his head back.
“Why did you do this?” Cas asks.
Except now it turns out maybe he’s not. Maybe even that is just part of Chuck’s storybook bullshit. The truth is he’s terrified that there is no part of him that isn’t. This fresh and imaginative new hell just never stops piling on the existential dread.
His head hurts. He drops back onto the bed, lying on his back, staring up at the bare ceiling. He glances at the small row of worn paperbacks on the shelf above his head. One of them, its spine turned to the wall where it can’t catch his eye, is Chuck’s. He’s not sure why he kept it. Maybe because he thought it would be nice to see himself as a hero sometimes? But it had never worked, he’d always felt uncomfortable reading them because the man in the books with his name was entirely him, except he wasn’t.
‘I love you too angel.’
Cas nods. “Yes.”
Dean rolls his eyes at his brother as he pushes back the drapes to peer out of the grimy windows. From the look of the crumbling brick buildings that surround it, the hotel is not the only part of the neighbourhood to have seen better days, but fat snowflakes are falling heavily, dropping a veil of silent white over the street, turning it into something almost picturesque in the early evening gloom. He can almost imagine how it looked once, with rows of smart brownstone houses and wide avenues, the shiny beetle shapes of old fashioned cars moving past.
It’s only just five but Cas is freezing and since Dean is offering…"Whiskey would be great, I still can’t feel my fingers."
Dean breaks into a wide grin and starts laughing, screwing up his eyes and shaking, laughing until he's gasping and there are tears in his eyes.
"Thank you."
Dean gets up and goes over to the window. He opens the drapes wider so they can both see the storm, a blanket of swirling static shrouding the dark neighbourhood. He whistles in surprise. “Shit, I’m kinda glad I didn’t end up on a plane in this.”
Dean stares at him, transfixed, not breathing. The man doesn’t seem to notice him, doesn’t even glance in his direction. His gaze is focused on something by the window. Despite the darkness, Dean can make out every detail of the man’s face, the dark hair under his trilby hat, the lines in the corners of his eyes, his strong jawline. He can see the creases in the collar of his old-fashioned dark coloured trench-coat, turned up as if he has just come in from the cold. The man appears completely solid, but something about the way he stands out against the gloom makes Dean immediately aware that the man is not really ‘here’ in the strictest sense of the word. He appears to be speaking - his lips move quickly as he holds his gloved hands out in front of him in a soothing gesture - but Dean cannot hear a word.
Cas stands and watches him. He has only been in Dean’s room for a few moments since he arrived here. He wonders why they're not in his own room. This room is sparsely decorated but strangely, it still makes him feel comfortable. It is someone’s home, even if that someone is something of a Spartan.
They pull up outside their building and Dean pulls the cases out of the trunk and drags them into the lobby. Cas follows behind. They stand silently next to each other in the elevator, smiling awkwardly. When the door opens on Cas's floor Dean hands him his case, Cas takes it with a smile. "Thanks for the ride Dean, it's was very kind of you. Have a good evening."
“Thank you Dean, I'm sure they will be perfect,” Cas says with a smile.
Dean frowns. “You ok?”
When they finally drag ass into the bunker Dean has aches in muscles he didn’t even know he had. His shoulders are stiff from driving and Garth’s painkillers are starting to wear off. A dull ache in his gums is threatening to become major pain given time.
"Ah tough break Cas. What you gonna do now?"
Sometimes though; when he looks at Dean, when he thinks about him - about them - he feels something inside him expand. He feels like he is opening out, unfolding and becoming something more than this.
Dean says nothing, he is still as marble. Then he shivers abruptly, the temperature has dropped rapidly, another effect of the failed spell. Although that may not be the cause of this shiver.
Dean laughs again,. "Not up for a Christmas fling then?"
Dean shivers involuntarily then clears his throat, embarrassed. Sam gives him a look. ‘What?’
The room is big, with a high ceiling. A very dusty chandelier hangs from the plaster rosette in its centre, missing more than a couple of dangly crystal things. The carpet is blood red again and the heavy velvet drapes, which may once have matched it, are now sun-bleached to patches of dusty pink. An ancient TV with an off-white plastic casing and a wire aerial sits on an art-deco-style walnut bureau at the foot of one of the beds.
When Balthazar stepped onto the stage with a few other singers in their place ready to go, Dean noticed that Cas' more timid demeanor returned as he kept his eyes down as if scared to glance up at him. Dean frowned wondering how much of Cas’ speech earlier was just a front to hide his feelings… He came across calm and in control, but maybe he as just trying to push aside feelings and ignore them the way Gabriel had said. After all, Dean was no stranger to the effects of alcohol helping to do just that. And Cas' wasn't showing any signs of slowing down.
“No, no.” Gabriel stood up and faced the younger boy not even noticing Dean’s wide confused eyes as he asked, “I’m curious. Is this someone you see yourself spending the rest of your life with?”  There was no way. He just wanted Sam to admit it was a fling. He was young and Gabriel hardly judged anyone for having a good time and partying. Running a club it kind of came with the territory. What he didn’t and couldn’t understand was the relationship behind Ruby’s drug deals and why Sam was so insistent on Ruby being his girlfriend. And that just scratched the surface of his concerns. Gabriel had made out with Sam two times while he was high, the second one almost ending in them in bed together before he slowed things down. He had meant to have the conversation, the big “
More Meg!
Finally they meet. Sorry for the long absence. I've started another project on here but plan to go back and forth updating this and "No Place In Heaven" regularly.
Cas laughed and sniffed a little as Balthazar turned his attention elsewhere. He absolutely knew that Balthazar wasn’t straight. But at least without him telling him he could play dumb about it. Knowing...
Cas started walking away, wincing when he heard footsteps at his heels. “What do you want? You’ve been showing up at my locker for three days straight and making me late. And all you do is get me in trouble during classes we have together.”
Dean saw their server loading up with drinks and got her attention.  "Another round of purple nurples to the booth by the stage," he gestured their way and she nodded putting it on their tab.  He noticed that the bartender was the guy that introduced Meg last week when she auditioned.  He looked way more comfortable working than he did talking on the stage to the crowd and was quick handed, serving people drinks with expert precision and speed.
Chapter 3 is coming. It's the sexy Destiel chapter. I just had to throw this in to work up to it..
Cas sat for a moment, taking in his words. “You know I am an adult and can make my own decisions.” Castiel said, a bit of anger that he wished he had more control over seeping through. “You aren’t responsible for the bad choices that I make, Dean.” In truth, he was embarrassed by his choice to run away from his problems and drink. But the fact that Dean would blame that on himself... Nothing was Dean’s fault. How could he even think that it was.
He repeated over and over. And,
He picked the phone up off the seat and turned down the radio. “Ello..?”
a short one.. i know. next chapter will be up asap. almost done with it already :)
“Pie?” Dean asked, forcing himself to snap out of it and try to act like a normal human being. Cas hadn’t even been to the house, let alone at his door in over a week. And here he was,
“Cas is… I don’t know…” Dean shook his head softly trying to find the words to explain his actions. He sighed. “Cas is light, okay? And there’s a whole lot of darkness around him right now.” He glanced at Chuck before focusing on the empty glass in front of him, which he found was a
“Hey…” Dean paused trying to figure out what he wanted to say. In truth he wanted to ask if Cas was okay after what happened with Meg. He wanted to ask him if he needed anything or wanted to talk. He put his hand on the door knob ready to push it open. But after another second it fell back to his side. “Just wanted to say g’night.”  It was lame, but so far every time he had a win with Cas it was because he didn’t force him to talk if he didn’t want to.
Chuck stifled a yawn as he looked down at his watch. It was only ten o’clock and he was already starting to drag which wasn’t a good sign when he was on the clock ‘til one. Thursday nights were always a bit slower than Friday’s show nights and Saturdays when the weekend officially hit. Even though orders were coming in fairly steadily it was nothing compared to what tomorrow night would bring.  When Dean Winchester slid into an open seat at the bar and put in his order, Chuck forced some pep in his step as he got the requested liquor to try and help wake himself up.  “Sam’s brother right?” he asked as he poured the drink and slid it forward to him.
Dean made a mental note that Sam didn’t know as much as he did about the bad blood between the two, but even he thought it was off when they were trying to make peace between the two guys so Cas would move back home, stop drinking, move on in a healthy way.
“Holy shit.” Gabriel murmured, hating himself when he realized that Zachariah had surprised him. These other dorks, maybe, sure. But he was usually one up on his tricks. Instead he was left looking just as stunned as everyone else.
The tension in the air around them was so thick you could cut it with a knife, and even the charming Balthazar looked a little nervous. Cas stopped in front of them and Balthazar quickly regained his composure. “Cassie, you came.”
Dean stared at him for a moment, finding it exhilarating that he had hardly been moved by the pain of the cattle prod. He didn't take his eyes away from the Angel as he answered. "Yes. He's the one." He let the man make his way, military face back in place as he stared down the angel a few more seconds before he finally and wordlessly turned and followed.
As they neared them it was Sam who spoke first, “we brought you some lunch.” His words came out quiet, scared that he wouldn’t be received well after everything that went down. Gabe turned around at his voice and upon seeing them his face immediately changed to warm and welcoming.
Dean focused on his coffee avoiding eye contact with the two. None of this was any of his business. At fucking all. Yet all he wanted to do since finding out that Cas was here in the house was go into his room, wake him up and be near him. Make him laugh again and just chill doing nothing. Briefly he wondered if this was some fucked up result of his parents dying and some warped paternal instinct that would make him soft on anyone who was absent of a parent figure.  Dean hardly processed the loss of his own parents before becoming both father and mother to Sam and maybe now he was paying for it. Something about that made him feel out of control. He liked being able to go out after work and do whatever he wanted. That was the perk of being an adult. One day he could go fishing. If he felt like hanging out he could have dinner with Bobby or catch a movie with his cousin Jo. And if he got an itch he could head to a random bar and pick up a chick. Those things made him feel like he was in control.  Checking his phone constantly the past few days and pacing the house with some internal excitement about spending more time with a guy that he had just met... made him feel super out of control.
"You look really pale. You sure you're okay?" He got up and moved closer to me. He rested a hand on my forehead. "Dude, you are burning up."
She talked about life and Castiel, carefully avoiding the incident. Only when they arrived at the restaurant did she stop telling him about everything under the sun.
"Pretty much." Castiel laughed.
"It's okay." She smiled a small, self-depreciating smile. "Look, you're going to want kids some day and I can't give them to you. I don't want to be the reason you can't have the life everyone else gets."
"Yeah, but you love him."
"Hey, Luci, tell Mike I'll be back later, okay?" Castiel asked his brother.
Castiel sat in his bedroom, staring at the wall. He had ideas about what happened, but he was afraid to say them out loud. He was scared of what her answer might be.
"I know. I just feel like I have let her down."
Deanna rolled her eyes and smiled. It was only one day.
"Okay, okay." Castiel grabbed Deanna's arm and began to guide her down the drive. "Let's go, Dee, let's go."
"Burgers, Cas?" She asked jovially. "It's perfect."
Deanna looked about and saw the home was fully furnished, thankfully since they didn't have anything but their clothes and a few other things.
"What's wrong, babe?" I grabbed his hand and laced my fingers between his.
"You're really good at that." A sleepy Castiel said from the doorway.
"Wait." I said. He looked at me with faux innocence.
Sam's brother just got up and left without a believable explanation. And he didn't return after ten minutes. Ten minutes was lenient, but it would likely take him a while to find the bathroom and a little longer to find his way back. Still wouldn't be five minutes.
"It's time for the dance of the grooms." Sam said into a microphone.
I hopped off to the shower, where I stripped the panties off and turned on the shower. Once the water was warm, I hopped beneath the stream and palmed myself.
"Hey, where is she going?" Sam asked. "Why isn't she going to help?"
Dad thinks we are a couple? Or maybe he was just saying that. Or maybe Sammy was lying, but why would he lie about that?
"I know. It's been a little weird for me too, but I have Castiel to keep me distracted, if ya know what I mean." Deanna winked at her little brother.
I grabbed one cheek and completely manhandled it. I was right. It is deliciously firm.
"Oh." She picked up her cup again and took another drink, grimacing at the room temperature liquid.
"I like it. It's cute." He too poked at the squish.
"He's not gonna find out either, right?" I said nonchalantly. If he does, he does. If he doesn't, he doesn't. I'll deal with what comes.
"Nah, I'm good. I will sit down however." Castiel walked over and sat so close to Dean he was almost in his lap. Dean didn't know how to react to such forwardness, so he sat perfectly still and frigidly.
"Yes." He whimpered.
Castiel trudged up to his room and flopped on his bed.
At home, Castiel had Deanna lifted up with her legs wrapped securely around his waist. He kissed her, passion long-suppressed surfacing and taking them over completely.
"It's alright, honey. I've lassoed Charlie into helping me. Besides, we are almost done." She smiled at the the younger girl and waved her off to the backyard. Castiel couldn't help but admire the way Deann walked over and placed a small kiss to the older woman's cheek, the same lips he had the pleasure of kissing only moments before.
"Thank you," Deanna said. She picked up her glass and took a sip.
"Sorry, Deanna's a bit of a weird one. She doesn't understand she's beautiful." Sam glared at Deanna pointedly.
"Bye!" Deanna and Sam called.
"Sure it is." I rolled my eyes and myself onto my stomach. I laid my head down on my crossed arms and looked at Castiel. His hair had dried and was beginning to stand up in weird places.
"Yes, master." He rolled his eyes at her, but felt Deanna tense.
Castiel, Lucifer, and Michael's mother had died giving birth to Castiel. Chuck had then gone into a depression where he went to bars and woke up in seedy motels; cliched, I know. He had impregnated a woman during this period of time and she gave birth to twins, Gabriel and Anna. She expressed her dislike of having children and signed over the two children to Chuck's custody.
Castiel loaded everything into the Impala as his phone began to ring.
"Hey, Deanna?" She heard through her reverie.
I hung my head. I put down my pencil and put my head into my hands.
Deanna and Castiel paid for their food and walked out to the car where they got in.
"No, I don't." He replied.
"What?" I said sourly.
But, all good things come to an end and school was starting.
Moments after Charlie left, the doorbell rang once again. This time Sam answered.
"She'll be okay."
"Nope, I won't answer that until you tell me when you got your dick pierced."
"Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know."
I rolled my eyes and continued on to the bathroom. I started up the bath with scented oils that relax the body. Don't knock it til you try it, I always say.
"I know, Sam. I know. How am I supposed to tell him? Oh, hey, by the way! I have a dick!" She snapped.
She slipped into the green suit and tugged the shorts on. She grimaced at her figure in the mirror as she pulled a shirt over top of the suit.
He answered with a tentative, "Hello?"
"Tonight, I have cooked up something delicious for you," Lucifer started. "We also have some red wine if you would enjoy some of that."
"I'm sorry." My voice cracked and I closed my eyes. It's disrespectful to look someone in the eyes, especially your boss or parent. "It won't happen again."
"My god, Deanna." Castiel lurched forward and caught her as she fell. "What happened?"
"God, I hope not." I groaned. "How mortifying! Those were dirty and smelled like sweat, probably."
His heart bled at the thought if his beautiful, late wife. With her blonde hair, soft green eyes, and sweet smile. Deanna was very much like her mother.
He loved the way she looked when she drove, so in control of the powerful beast beneath her. She had the right hand on the wheel and the other one was on her cheek, elbow rested on the window. She looked over.
"No, dammit," Bobby grumbled unhappily.
Castiel, Charlie, and even Meg came in the door.
"Are you sure, Dad?"
He sent the text and waited patiently for a message back.
"This would be easier if I drove." He smiled at her, trying to coax her.
"She's mean, ain't she?" The second person snarled. He twisted her arm harder until her fingers were forced to relinquish control if the knife. Her legs were then swept from beneath her and her ankles bound together. She continued to thrash in their arms until they dropped her. She started an army crawl beneath the car, snagging her knife on the way.
"I think she is trying to set Deanna and myself up, to be honest, sir." Castiel responded. Deanna blushed.
"You asshole! You better never come down or I will kill you!" Dean was red in the face from embarassment and fury.
After the ceremony, everyone went over to the little hall for the reception.
"Yeah, I did not get good vibes from her." Sam shivered dramatically. "She looked at me like I was something to eat."
"Relax, Winchester. I'm not making any moves on you.... yet."
"Didn't feel like." Dean replied somberly.
"Yes. I've been taking hormones for about four months now."
How does one react to tragedy? Should they scream and cry? Or should they sit in silence, acting as though nothing happened? Or should they find ways to cope with what had happened, find support from those who love them?
"Yeah." Deanna smiled and stood up. "I get to stay here."
She didn't know where she was driving, but she trusted Castiel.
Must have been a good little nap, or he was overly tired, Deanna mused watching as his eyes closed again and he fell asleep yet again.
"Thank you, Deanna." Mrs. Bradbury said on a sigh. "I always get so flustered with these kinds of things."
"What?"
I took a seat in the back, per usual, and pulled out my notebook to take notes in. I looked up, waiting for the bell to ring and the teacher to begin class. I watched as students sporadically filed into the classroom one by one.
Castiel almost winced visibly. Damn, he hadn't taken into account that Crowley might have a boyfriend.
Torn clothing, ratted hair, pained walk, blood down her legs, and tear-streaked face.
I buried my nose in the name of his neck and inhaled his sweet scent. His soft hair tickled at my nose. My free hand traced small circles onto his belly for hours until he woke up.
"I guess I got lucky." Deanna smiled at her friends and started the Impala.
Deanna heard the front door open and close.
"It's beautiful," she whispered.
"Wow."
"Okay, we have patties and wieners on the grill now." Mr. Bradbury said as he set the plates up under the overhang. "All the dressings are over here so you can put whatever you want on 'em."
"Yeah, you kind of are, Dean. You're cute, you blush easy, your dad doesn't hate me - that I know of - and you're pretty damn sweet. I mean, I called you in desperation at two thirty in the morning and you let me in and cleaned me up. You let me sleep in your bed and even wear your panties. You are a darlin'. I should be so lucky to be your boyfriend." I awkwardly scratched the back of my neck. "You are kind to everyone, as I hear it. I would be one proud son of a bitch to be able to hold your hand, kiss your plush lips, and call you
"I'm just going to leave now." Castiel got up and left. Crap. I am such a dumbass. I just pushed away my ultimate crush.
"Yeah?"
"Excellent idea." Deanna held out the blanket as he carefully lowered his arms into the pocket she had created. She pulled the corner closed, effectively creating an overly large hobo sack.
"I've missed you so much!" Sam said loudly.
"You didn't do anything, did you?" He asked, going into protective Do I Need to Kill Someone mode.
"Sure thing. Be good." John smiled from his seat on the couch, newspaper in hand.
I just waved him off and closed my eyes.
John quietly opened her door and peered in where Castiel was out on the bed, arm thrown across the bed, like he was holding someone there. John turned to Deanna who had gotten up and winked at her, malicious smile curving his lips.
"What have you told him?" Castiel asked in horror.
"Hi, I'm Lilith." She smiled with a too big mouth, obviously looking Sam up and down.
"No, but two more classes and we can. Thank god for being a senior." He sighed.
"Yes, ma'am." She waved lazily as she disappeared.
But around fifteen, Castiel met Meg Masters. She had long brown hair tipped him blue and a sweet round face paired with a southern voice that held enough sugar to turn the healthiest person diabetic.
"That was quick." I said.
He sighed and restarted the page for the third time, mentally cursing himself for letting his thoughts intrude once again. A knock sounded at the door and he was happy to close the book on his thumb and take a break. “It’s open,” he yelled over, happy to let Sam come in and distract him with some nerdy news story he had just read about or absolutely anything else that wasn’t his own thoughts.
Cas’ eyes began to narrow and Dean moved his head down some trying to catch Cas’ line of vision and hold his focus. When Cas’ eyes flickered up to him he instinctively put his hand out over Cas’ that was still touching the fork. “Hey, it’s okay. We don’t have to talk about your past or the club or anything you don’t want to. Just… talk to me.”
“N-night, Cas,” Sam said hesitantly knowing the air between everyone was weird and this wasn’t a matter that was settled yet and now Gabe had put him in the middle of it by asking him to make some kind of contract for Castiel to sign.
Option D: Kissing Balthazar.
Sam whistled loudly and yelled out “yeah, Cas!” making Dean chuckle lightly and smile at the boy.  Just as Gabriel came out he swore he saw Cas smile back before turning and walking off the stage.
Besides that, it's not like he had time to bullshit around. Back before the virus he could afford to get stuff done and have a good time. But that wasn't the case here. He had secured the position and people actually knew who he was. They depended on him. So he swore off fun for the most part despite Cas' pleading to loosen up and relax. Dean still drank like a mother fucker but more often than not, that was alone. Other times he was with Cas. And on nights when he craved something more he had a fucked up relationship (and he hated calling it that) with Risa. In Dean's mind it was a way to stay sane and relieve some of the tension. Just enough that he could jump back to work the next day and pretend like he didn't have to put a gun to a man's head that he knew because they were out on a supply run and the dumb son of a bitch slipped and got himself turned. Being with Risa was a survival technique for himself. She knew that she was being used but part of her still wanted to believe in something good. That maybe Dean fucking Winchester and her could share a love that she remembered from a time before The End. She never said as much but the truth was in her eyes every time she told him he could stay the night after they were done having sex. Dean never did. And the nights when she had enough of being hurt herself and tried to turn him away, Dean would tell her that he needed her. That they had a connection. She knew he was a broken man and thought maybe one day she could fix him.  For now, though, her only current peace of mind regarding the matter was that at least he wasn't spending the night in anyone else's cabin and in that way she had him all to herself.
It was so hard to resist the urge to make a scene congratulating him. He wanted to shout from the rooftops that he was loved and that everything was going to be okay. But Cas didn’t come out to the world, he came out to him. And he knew how to be tactful,
of a rock hitting the water stopped him and he looked over.
Chuck frowned slightly for the first time tonight not really understanding what he meant. From everything Dean had said, he knew that Cas was holed up in a room and refusing to come out in some unhealthy state of mind and Dean was worried about him.  Chuck’s eyes widened some as understanding came. “Oh. Like you can’t stop thinking about him.”

“Look I don’t have to…” Chuck said uncomfortably trailing off which brought Gabriel back to reality.
Cas scowled her for a few seconds but found he was unable to hold it as his head lulled heavily. “Nooo…” he almost whined. “I don’t want to see him.” Meg rolled her eyes and grabbed his shoulders making him look at her.
The anonymous forum on the net were ones that he found himself frequenting often. Hundreds of stories of what it had been like for people to actually have sex with the creatures. Of course, there were
He looked over to Dean but realized that he had walked away.  Cas turned a couple of times looking for him but it was as if he vanished.  Leaving the gemstones he set off to find him, turning down a few aisles before he thought he heard his voice the opposite direction and began to follow it.  Castiel could hear another voice as he got closer, a woman.  He turned the last corner to find that Dean was at the checkout leaning casually on the table that she worked behind.  “… you already gave me one, Bela.” Dean help up his keys jingling them slightly as he smiled at her.  The rabbit foot key chain dangled back and forth as he did so.
Dean nodded. He had heard most of this from Sam before. It wasn’t super unusual that he found Gabriel Novak as a roommate considering the guy was an ex-law student. Their friends probably ran in the same circles. The way that Sam talked up the club and this Gabe guy that ran it though could make you wonder… But Dean knew that it wasn't anything like that... Sam had a girlfriend. Ruby. Bobby had thought to invite her to come with Sam for Christmas but she quickly declined. That wouldn’t have been strange if she was spending the holiday with her own family or something, but she basically came out and said she doesn’t
My chapter titles still suck. LoL. Thank you to everyone who keeps coming back. Big hearts <3 to you.
Cas glanced over at Dean before sighing and looking away rather embarrassed with the whole situation.  Gabe, not embarrassed in the least bit, began to explain. “New house stipulations for Castiel to live here.”
Balthazar scoffed. “We want Cas to be over me, right? I need to prove I was always the wrong choice from the beginning." Balthazar had a lot of regrets when it came to Castiel. He should have talked to him about his dad and his feelings sooner. He shouldn't have kissed him and led him on repeatedly. Though in his own defense he didn't really know how bad everything was until Cas blew up. If only he had talked to him sooner... "He doesn’t love me, Gabriel. He just liked the idea that we could hide forever. He was ready to settle for letting me kiss and fuck whoever I want for a private moment where he felt like he could actually be himself and not get judged by his dad or have to answer to God.” Gabriel sighed and nodded, already hearing and agreeing with this reasoning earlier in the week. Gabriel understood being confused and the fact that his brother might have felt like he was in love... and maybe in some ways he had been in love with Balthazar. But a kiss twice a year was hardly passion. And to think his brother, or hell, anyone... was going to settle for that and not be your true self was upsetting to say the least.
Cas shakes his head. "It's in the shop."
"Because you said those things before - and then you told me to go."
“Me?”
He can’t remember what he was panicking about. This is the way things have been for years. But, wonders a small voice at the back of his mind, had things been like this for years
‘Hey!’ Sam exclaims, without real heat. ‘I
Cas blushes and shrugs. "Well, it's your car."
“Good,” Dean says and leans down again, pressing a hand to Cas’s forehead. “I’ll leave you to it, ok?” Dean turns towards the door. Cas’s body is wracked with a coughing fit again, he winces and presses a hand to his chest as he fights for breath and tries not to spill the soup. Dean turns back. “You want me to stay for a bit?” he asks with a frown.
“Wha--?” Dean starts.
Cas smiles, "When do you find the time for so much reading? You always seem so...busy," he finishes and feels his face heat up, he hadn't really meant to say that. "I mean...I presumed...not that I know really..."
Cas feels himself flush a little again, it's always awkward talking to people about his work, he never knows how they will take it. "Um...historical stuff mostly...kind of fantasy I guess?"
Dean turns, menu held aloft in triumph and stops, eyes widening as he sees Cas in the doorway. Cas blinks and swallows hard. Dean licks his lips and clears his throat. “Thai ok?” His voice is rough and Cas nods dumbly as he tries not to think about what it would be like to hear that voice against his ear, breathing his name.
Sam looks at him surprised, he gets up from his seat, still looking dead on his feet and comes over to Cas, putting his huge arms around his shoulders. “Hey I’m sorry Cas, I didn’t think. I mean I know it sucks to be human sometimes but I guess we can’t understand what it’s like to just be one all of a sudden.”
Sam raises his eyebrows. ‘Bite me,’ he says with a smile, unscrewing the bottle cap and taking a swig of whiskey. Dean makes a face, grabbing for the bottle before any more germs can be transferred.
‘You saved me.’
"Cas! Get a move on!" Dean calls and, with a deep sigh, Cas follows his light in the darkness.
always known it. He can still feel the chill of the kiss. He swallows and closes his mouth. ‘What happened?’ he asks, because he doesn’t want to say “I love you,” to a dead man he only just met.
"I'm fine, thank you Dean," he says hurriedly, blushing as memories of the sounds of Dean's 'visitors' fill his head.
"Can you, I don't know...feel...any power coming from anywhere here? Like, sense it or something?" Dean asks, awkwardly.
As he walks, the wheel of his case catches on the uneven concrete, the handle jerks out of his hand and he drops the case in the snow. Pulled up short, he loses his footing, slips on the icy ground and falls hard on his ass in the freezing cold.
"The door's on the fritz too. Guess the locks run on the same power."
Cas smiles. “This may be the best one ever,” he says, “thank fuck for the weather. To think I could have been sitting on Gabe’s couch regretting eating too much and making awkward small talk with Sam’s brother.” He gives a fake shudder.
Cas nods and Dean comes back to sit on the edge of the bed again. He looks down as if trying to decide something and then puts a hand on Cas’s leg, tentitively, as he watches Cas finish eating.
“Sit up then.” Dean stands as Cas sits forward, arranging his pillows to prop him up. When Cas is comfortable Dean strokes his hair again, quickly and softly.
“Your poor neighbours,” he says with a grin, “Oh yeah, right…”
Dean had pressed his hand to Cas’s forehead. “Shit you're burning up!” He sighed as he looked sympathetically into Cas’s wide, bloodshot eyes. “I'm sorry buddy.”
"I'm gonna need some help here Cas, c'mon.” Dean starts off back the way he came. Cas stands and watches him. He really just wants to go back into his room. What does he know about electricity and how the bunker works? He'll just be in the way as usual.
“See this is why you’re awesome,” Dean says with a grin, taking one of the bottles and twisting the cap. Sharp pain tears through his hand and he hisses in surprise, looking in disbelief at the ragged cut across his palm. “Oh you have got to be shitting me,” he snaps.
Cas laughs. "My parents are very lapsed Catholics, but I guess old habits die hard."
“What for?” Cas asks.
with Cas? When did that happen? Cas is his best friend and also, perhaps more importantly, a dude. Or at least dude-adjacent. So why does he feel like he’s been in love with Cas for years?
"I blame it on my roommate Charlie," Dean continues, "she's the one who's always dragging people over here to play video games all fucking night," he laughs, "Sometimes I don't know why I put up with her. She's like the little sister I never wanted," he says fondly.
“Shit! It's late. Sorry man you must be fucking wrecked. C’mon, there's a room for you.” Dean gets up and holds out a hand, gesturing for Cas to follow him. Cas gets up slowly, says goodnight to Sam and follows Dean down the winding corridors of the bunker.
Cas raises his arms tentatively, it feels nice, he thinks, comforting and friendly but not the same. He is not swamped with sensation the way he was when Dean hugged him.
Cas gets up slowly, blinking in the sudden darkness. He debates for a moment just calling out that yes, he's ok but instead he opens his door and peers out into the hall. It's just as dark as his room but a warm orange glow is approaching. It is Dean, holding his Zippo aloft, the flame reflecting off the shiny tiles. The tiny glow that surrounds him is the only light in the almost total darkness of the bunker.
“You shouldn’t get too close to me.” Cas says sadly. Dean frowns. He stops, looking unsure.
Dean rolled his eyes. “Pretty sure you’ve just got a cold Drama Queen.”
Dean frowns, that’s not exactly what he meant, but he’s not sure what he does mean. “I missed him,” he says.
A week later Dean has never mentioned anything about what he may or may not have heard in the bathroom and the events of that day are currently far from Cas’s mind anyway. He is sick, but not dying. Or so Dean and Sam have both re-assured him. Apparently this is just a Cold and it's common and not life threatening. He's just going to have to take their word for that.
"Why?" Cas asks quietly. "I've been gone many times before. Why does it matter now?"
Dean almost glows with pride at Cas's words. "Thanks man, glad you liked her."
When they get to the car Dean brushes the snow off the trunk and opens it to dump both cases inside.
"Nothing to be guilty about," he smiles, "I'm the same. I have way too many downstairs," he says, thinking of the stack sitting unread on his nightstand below. "Sometimes I just want to read the ones I've already read a million times you know? Even when I've got new ones waiting. It's comforting..." he trails off because Dean is grinning.
"Man after my own heart," Dean grins, "Sit there and warm up, back in sec."
‘Whatever Egon. So who’s the spook?’
Cancelled. Cancelled. Cancelled...
Sam smiles. ‘Thanks man, you too.’
"Wow, it’s getting late."
Outside it’s cold. Wind whistles down the alley following a swirl of dead leaves and trash. Dean faces the wall with his head bowed, cradling the fist he just slammed into the brickwork, catching the blood that drips between his fingers. He is crying. He tells himself it’s from the pain.
“It’s good to have you back Cas,” Sam says, “It can’t have been easy, you did good.”
"Ah cool, I guess you get a good Christmas lunch then?"
Cas looks up when he’s finished. ‘It was lovely to meet you Dean,’ he says, holding out a hand again.
Dean smiles and turns to meet Cas’ lips with his own. The rush of fear and panic is still there, like a greek chorus in his head but there is also joy. Happiness. Relief. Cas gasps and pushes his fingers into Dean’s hair, kissing him harder, then shoves him against the alley wall in a way that reminds Dean of another time, a long time ago, under very different circumstances and he smiles against Cas’ mouth as his back hits the bricks. He grabs a handful of trench-coat with one hand and messy dark hair with the other and pulls him in. He’d be lying if he said he hadn’t thought about doing exactly that last time - for at least a split second before the fighting started. Cas groans darkly.
“Thanks for taking a chance on your annoying neighbour, I’m sure I haven't given you any reasons to think I'd be a good guy to hang out with. I've been a bit selfish the last few months. Sorry if I've been a dick.”
Cas nods and dips the spoon into the soup and raises it to his lips. The smell makes his mouth water and the sweet-savoury taste floods his mouth and soothes his throat, warming him from the inside. He closes his eyes with a smile.
"Haven't looked, I'll go stick my head out now. Powercuts don't usually affect this place though. I just figured it ran on fucking magic or something."
Dean blinks, staring at Cas as if he’s seeing him for the first time. He feels the pricking of the tears that threaten to spill over again but he also feels something spreading through his chest, a revelation so huge and yet so utterly obvious that the odds of crying or laughing hysterically seem pretty even. He has literally never considered their rejection of Heaven’s plan as being in the same ballpark, but now he sees it. He sees how he never really thought twice. He may have had moments where he thought he should go along with it for a whole bunch of reasons, but he never felt that the angel’s were
Dean looks embarrassed as he hands him his drink, taking a sip from his own glass. "Yeah, I know. I keep buying more even though there's shit loads I haven't even started yet. Guilty pleasure," he laughs.
He finishes his food and puts his feet up on the table next to Dean's and tries to focus on the plot of the movie. Just as he's finally getting into the story he feels a strange sensation as if someone was staring at him. He turns his head just in time to catch Dean looking away quickly. There is a small flush creeping over his cheek as he tries to pretend he wasn't staring. Cas smiles to himself and turns back to the tv.
"No."
Cas smiles, feeling suddenly glad that he hadn't complained about Dean's music or noisy partners, or friends. "No problem."
“Good?” Dean asks.
Once inside Cas looks around him at the vast space under the hill. There is a sense of warmth and welcome that he has never felt before. He very much hopes that he is home.
Cas nods.
“Just...for everything I guess. All of it.” Dean says, scrubbing his hands over his face.
Cas feels Deans fingers curl around his where they lie on top of the covers and give a small squeeze. He doesn't trust himself to speak so he just nods and squeezes back.
Cas nods, breathless. He listens as Dean's breathing slows, and breathes in the warm scent of his skin. He kisses his neck softly over one of the marks he left there.
"Yes, too much," Cas replies with feeling, before kicking himself again - is that an insensitive thing to say to an orphan? From Dean’s laugh he assumes it’s ok though. Dean laughs with his whole body, as if what Cas said is the funniest thing he's ever heard, there's no hint of affectation or insincerity though. Cas finds himself returning his warm smile as he continues. "I have four brothers and two sisters."
Dean sits down on his bed. ‘S’ok,’ he says. ‘It’s been…an experience.’
“I brought you some food, think you can manage it?” Dean asks.
Dean sits on the floor of the dark bathroom. Gradually he becomes aware of the room again, the overwhelming silence and stillness. His face is wet from tears. He blinks away the drops that cling to his eyelashes and tries to remember how he got there. He has woken from a dream he only half remembers with a dull aching emptiness in his chest. Was someone else there? He has a fleeting impression of a man with blue eyes but as he reaches for the memory it slips away. He frowns to himself. This is why we don't drink half a bottle of whiskey on an empty stomach. He gets to his feet slowly, uncurling numb legs. All his muscles protest as he stands with a groan.
“It’s good, having him there,” Dean says tentatively.
"Still, I'm sorry for your loss."
Cas watches him go. More than anything in the world he wants to grab him, pull him into a hug like the one Dean gave him when he first arrived; crushing and desperate and unthinking. But unthinking doesn’t seem to be on the menu anymore; every time they look at each other Cas can almost see the wheels in Dean’s head turning. The tiny twitches in his fingers, the widening of his eyes and the panicked nervousness that makes him stop, turn away, walk away.
‘No one knows for sure. A bunch of people over the years have reported it. It’s a couple of guys in old fashioned clothes – maybe 1940’s? – anyway, they appear out of nowhere, have an argument then one of them shoots the other one and they disappear. No one’s been able to work out who they might be. It only seems to happen on New Years’ though. Which is why we’re here.’
Sam unzips his suitcase and pulls out a pile of paper which he shuffles in his lap. ‘Ghosts,’ he says. ‘There’s a whole heap of sightings and reports from this place, going back years. Something for pretty much every room if you look - poltergeist activity, cold spots, misty figures, phantom smells and weird noises --”
A shiver runs up Dean’s spine for some reason, but he shakes his head. ‘No, seems like you're out of luck.’
Cas sighs and finishes taking off his clothes, dropping the damp garments on top of his coat and climbing into the shower, dragging the curtain across behind him. It’s not his first shower; he has quickly come to understand the need to keep his vessel clean, and, more recently, to appreciate that the experience could be pleasurable. He pushes his hands through his hair, tipping his head back and closing his eyes as the water gradually warms his chilled skin, washing away the goose bumps and rain. The water is the perfect temperature. Warmth rains down around him, the pressure is high and the drops hit his skin with an ever so slight sting, bouncing off his shoulders, streaming down his back and chest, sliding over his ass and legs, running into the dark, coarse hair between his legs, down his cock. It feels perfect.
The corners of Cas’ mouth turned up slightly as he took the compliment and nodded softly.  “I’m not usually into stuff like that either,” he admitted and turned his attention back to the counter as he pulled down another mug and set it next to Deans.  He shrugged slightly. “It’s Gabe’s thing. I’m just… trying it out.”
“What the hell happened in there?” Dean interrupted but Gabe only shook his head.
Filled with the thought and determined to make things right with Balthazar, he headed to the bathroom to shower and get ready. Maybe he would meet the girl of his dreams at his friends party tonight and then he could finally rest all of the unsettling worries he had about being like his brother Gabriel.
“Umm… everything good?” he asked.
“Fried sugar Chinese donuts? Of course.” Sam finished with a chuckle and Gabriel went over and hugged him extra tight which was definitely the sign that he needed telling him that they were okay.
… I’m not…” he cut himself off knowing when to stop before saying something that would offend Gabe. “Anyway,
. Deep and rough and not at all what Dean had expected to escape those rough looking lips . Dean was pretty sure that the sound would be jerk off material for days until he actually he actually allowed the angel to touch him. He wanted to break him first. As much as he wanted to fill that tight hole that he had been literally dreaming about, Dean just wasn't one to jump in like that without playing a bit first. And having a supernatural creature who was an enigma of possibilities, Dean hoped that he could hold off on exploring his own self gratification until he really learned what made the angel tick. His stoic nature now the day of the showing made Dean realize that this was going to take some work. Unlike the first angel that he had seen on the showroom floor who wore his emotions on his sleeve, screaming and belligerent and so full of emotions... that only would have taken days, hell maybe hours to make the walls come crashing down. That angel was already feeling so much that Dean was sure he would have started crying with pleasure soon after he received an alternate way to express his emotions. Not with this one who had obviously shoved all of those feelings and emotions away as some survival mechanism to get through the centuries. Dean wondered the last time that the the guy had a good cry, an orgasm that made him scream, a feeling of fucking
She looked down and flipped another page immediately surprised to see a couple of small hearts around the borders of the page. She started reading the words on the page going wide eyed before scrambling to a seated position. Castiel was turned around again, writing in a notebook that was on his desk leaving her to stare at his back with her mouth hanging open. A devilish smile formed as she started reading some of the lines out loud.
Dean rapped lightly on the door. “Yeah?” The voice on the other side sounded tired.
He found the door handle and finally escaped to head back to his room. Though he had been flustered at the club when Cas’ stomach was exposed he didn’t feel that way this time.  Maybe it was because he had spent the previous day in a normal setting, watching movies and playing games where they were more like equals. Every time he had seen Cas at the club he had always felt some kind of power shift between them that was probably because he couldn’t get over how talented the guy was. But the smiles, the laughs… the
He shook the thought out of his mind, not ready yet to have it.
Castiel was in the back having a conversation with Gabriel. He wasn’t just having the conversation, he was leading it. “I just think it would be beneficial if I could get in on the production part more.  I know I have a lot to learn and your arrangement was great, but I think if I learn the technology part then the music will sound more like
Cas had more of an eye on him than Dean noticed. He found that he was reading the same sentence over and over as his eyes would track his pacing back and forth and then turn back to the newspaper, watch him hoist himself up and then turn back to the newspaper, look over at him when he began whistling before again… turning back to the newspaper.  Annoyed at himself as he started the paragraph over for the sixth or seventh time, he finally pushed the paper aside which Dean took as an open that he could talk to him.
Dean moved forward to begging attaching the black cuffs.  Of course, enochian was carved into each, the same symbols that were on the ones that he arrived in, only these wouldn't only keep him from using his powers, they would also put him in any sexual position that he deemed fit. One to each ankle, one to each thigh, and finally one to each wrist.  Had the leather on them not been sigiled, Cas knew he could've broken free. But knowing there was no wiggle room with enochian, his fate was sealed.
“Really?” A disbelieving Michael called out from across the room with his arms crossed. “Weren’t you on-“
"Would you cut it out, ya idjit?" Bobby answered. "How is this going to be a vacation if you keep worrying about what’s going on here? And by the way, I’m pretty sure I managed before you came along. Hell, boy. I’ve been fixing cars since before you were born."
“Fuck.” Gabriel and Dean said at the same time.
After the show
"Prepare to be amazed," Dean said and searched for the right record, showing it off like Vanna White when he found the right one. He put the record on as Cas watched on curiously. Dean closed his door and turned off the lights leaving the room in complete darkness as he returned to the bed to sit next to Cas. As the introduction melody slowly started he explained, "this way you can just focus on the music and the words." Cas chuckled slightly and pulled his feet up to the bed, resting his head on his knees as the singing started. In the darkness, they listened. Cas smiled softly to himself enjoying the melody, especially the "ooh, it makes me wonder" parts. His eyes widened a little when the drums came in, surprising him and he chuckled. Dean smiled and nudged him a little in the dark. Cas leaned in a little, their shoulders now touching. By the time the guitar solo kicked in their arms were touching, soon followed by their hands.
He was just about to give up before he stopped in front of the door that had a drum track going consistently and some other electronic made music experimentally laying over it before it would abruptly stop and tried out with another instrument or sound.  He lingered a few seconds trying to decide if interrupting would be rude or worth the trouble.  He could just jump in his car and put McDonald's in the GPS, but he also knew if he was ever going to survive three months here he would have to be comfortable moving around the house without tiptoeing and damn it… he needed to know how to make a cup of coffee.
"Tell Cas what?"
He shrugged noncommittally. "Perhaps."
"Of what?"
"The people who brought Deanna Winchester?" A man in a white coat said.
"How do you do it?"
He went in the house with his negative thoughts and sat in his room. His phone flashed so he picked it up to show an unknown number calling him.
"You know she was going to find out sometime." Sam said. "Even if I don't know what you're hiding, I know Deanna would figure out your secret and then she'd be upset you never told her. Do you wanna deal with that?"
Driving half an hour wasn't fun on her sore bottom. She had no tears left to cry. She drove home and unlocked the front door on the house to find Sam, Castiel, Charlie, and even Meg sitting in the living room, each with varying expressions if worry and fear. The expressions changed as they saw her. Relief followed by horror crossed their eyes as they took in her appearance.
I heard Dean coming closer. I heard Charlie whispering and Dean groaning.
Castiel got out of his bed and pushed Meg over.
Not that Castiel would ever give Dean a second glance, but if he messed up and Castiel saw it? God, that would be the death of him.
I walked up the stairs one by one until I reached my bedroom. I opened the door and flopped onto my bed, pulling the panties I had stolen out of my pocket. They smelled musky and sexy. Not to mention they were sexy. Little green panties that would no doubt sit low on Dean's hips.
"Well enough." He shrugged. "Couldn't sleep for a few hours. Charlie is very insistent on knowing word for word, feeling for feeling, and blink for fuckin' blink."
Meg texted at about noon.
Why the hell was he up at nine a.m.? He needed his full thirteen hours!
"Hey, what's wrong, baby girl?" Castiel asked as he sat down and took her cut hand, making her realize she had been grasping it and twisting it like she wanted it off. "Is the cut bothering you?"
"Yes, I totally agree." Ruby said quickly. "Rule in place as of now!"
"Nothing against you, but I just want to stay here and never come out."
"Ditto." Deanna said.
I roused him awake at half past three so he could be wakening properly when Sam gets home from school. He groused at me, but got up anyway. He mumbled something about needing a shower and headed off to the bathroom. I laughed to myself and rolled off the bed. I snatched a blanket and wrapped myself in it, should Sam be home, I need not scar him. I walked to where I assumed the utility room might be and lucked out when I saw the washer and dryer. I moved the sheets and things over to the dryer and tossed a dryer sheet in. I started it up and proceeded back to the bedroom.
"What's stairway to heaven?" Cas asked making Dean look over with wide eyes.
Castiel shook his head. “No. I think part of me needed to come here.” He looked around the club. “Gabriel is… helping. I think. You both want the same for me.”
Cas had a soft smile on his lips not able to think of a better gift to get for Dean. Whether anything else happened between them, he honestly didn’t care. Most of all, he just wanted to let Dean know he was sorry and get his friend back. “Je vais lui faire une tarte,” he said with a laugh unable to shake the smile.
“Nah, I’m sure Meg would like to be ‘off duty’ for a bit. I know I put her through a lot too.” Castiel wringed his hands realizing that he had a lot of people he needed to apologize to.
“Phantom hu-what now?” Dean asked looking over at his know-it-all brother who gave a slight chuckle and began to explain.
“Oh, right…” Dean remembered. He wanted to take Cas out to Mae’s Diner to make sure he was okay after the living room incident. Only Cas never responded and he sure as fuck hadn’t been okay. Some friend Dean had been. He pulled his hand out of the bag. The pie could wait. “Listen,” Dean started trying to find the words. He was never good with words. “I just wanted to say-”
Sam shrugged some. “Well she was around last week. But you were out.” Dean made a face not even close to ready to let that go.
about his little brother.”
Cas was still asleep, breathing deeply but quietly turned on his side. Gabe let out a light sigh seeing that it was probably just exhaustion from work rather than him retreating back into his dark scary depression and he said a silent “thank god” as he let his eyes wander from his brother to the room that was starting to look like it belonged to him rather than the guest room that he had moved into.  There were more than a few books and notebooks scattered around the room and Gabe realized how lucky he was that the boy had already used that creative outlet before getting here… sort of. Most of Cas’ writings were prayers and bible verses and personal reflections of scriptures that he would turn into hymns and lead in church.  Gabriel hadn’t heard any since he had been here but they were very emotional and it was clear to see that he had a lot of faith and devoted most of his life to it.
Castiel was wrapped up tight and laying on his side facing the door. His eyes were still closed, deep in sleep, and his lips were slightly parted as he took deep breathes that made his body rise and fall slowly.  Dean watched him for a few long moments happy that he found him looking so peaceful after finding the notebook that indicated he was anything but.
