“Oh please,” Sherlock rolled his eyes again, “We both know that’s not true. Why do you care about him so much?”
“Do you want coffee or tea?” John asked.
“No it’s fine, I’ll just take the floor,” Sherlock said, pulling out an armful of blankets.
Hi. JW
“While this isn’t directly relevant to chemistry, I think it would be a good activity to cover this week. Since it is everyone’s first year here at Newberry, I want the first week to be fun and to be an opportunity to work with a fellow classmate and get to know them better.”
Once he passed them out, John stared at his paper with furrowed brows.
Sherlock nodded slowly, turning away from John. “Yes,” he said. The pleasant buzz that John had felt earlier faded, and they unpacked in silence only interrupted by doors closing and muffled laughter. At one point, it became so overwhelming that John turned on the telly and tried to find a good program, only to give up after a few minutes.
Sherlock Holmes, in a mere week, peeled back all those layers of that innocent blue-eyed boy who teachers always adored, the boy who obediently did his work and was polite to everyone, the boy who could’ve never imagined chasing after a violent psychopath at three in the morning.
John swallowed and felt a knot in his stomach. It was a harsh slam of reality against his face, and John clutched the sheet of paper, trying his best to not freak out
John gulped. Being in love with his best friend’s brilliant mind already was bad enough. Sharing a room with Sherlock like this every single day would undoubtedly kill him.
It was June 10th, and only one more week of school was left before summer break.
“We had to speak with our counselor. We had been placed in the wrong classes,” Sherlock lied smoothly.

“Oi,” John laughed, wrapping his arms around Sherlock’s lanky waist and pulling him away. “Get off.” John had a huge smile on his face, the initial awkwardness of seeing Sherlock fading with the ease of laughing and talking with his best friend.
John glanced at his watch and sighed. It was almost 3 am.
(Sat 1:56am)
John breathed a sigh of relief when he saw Sherlock pulling out his phone to call Scotland Yard. He didn’t really feel like dying today.
“You two gentlemen are ten minutes late. Care to explain?”
John snorted. “Yeah right.”
“We saw each other over the summer,” John reminded her, pecking her lips but not embracing her. “You came to my match two weeks ago remember?”
A familiar figure walked up to the glass door, and John stopped his pacing.
Everyone is stupid compared to you. JW
Red velvet curtains fell gracefully onto the stage. Crystal and white gold chandeliers hung from the ceiling, casting a warm glow onto the stage.
As John thought about it now, the only thing he’d really ever stuck to was his medical interest. Long nights spent reading over every medical book in their bookshelf.
“The dorm is so quiet without you,” Sherlock said softly, and John shut his eyes tightly against a wave of emotion threatening to undo all the walls he’d placed up between Sherlock and him to make this bearable. John knew what Sherlock was trying to say.
After sharing a brief hug, they parted ways. John watched Sherlock walk into a sleek black car.
He made his way to the office. He checked in and looked at his listing.
“Well, my mother was something of a genius mathematician,” Sherlock started.
Irene, as expected, arched her eyebrow and a slow smirk made its way onto her face. “Ah, your boyfriend finally coming to watch you shirtless in tiny shorts wrestle around with other guys?”
Sherlock tensed up, and John could kick himself. Of course Sherlock was uncomfortable; he should’ve tried to switch rooms with someone or something. “Um, is that alright?” John asked awkwardly, watching Sherlock’s expression carefully.
Okay, so here's my headcannon for Sherlock when I started writing this story. I imagined that the present day Sherlock was hardened during his high school and university years, teased relentlessly by his classmates for being the 'freak', as demonstrated by Sebastian's words during TBB. This is partly why he became so emotionally detached. So in this AU, Sherlock was already slightly distant from his primary school years where he learned that he was different, but because he met John Watson twenty or so years before he was supposed to, John was able to get to know and become friends with a Sherlock that was slightly friendlier and less cold. This is why Sherlock's actions and words in these chapters are lighter than what he might normally say in BBC's production.
What if they just stopped talking?
(Sat 1:17am)
“It’s fine,” Sherlock smiled. “I’ve been told it’s my most striking feature.”
The bell rang and the documentary ended and it was like a mini earthquake happened, whatever they had, whatever strange force that had led them to holding hands disappeared as soon as the lights went back on. John jumped away from Sherlock, gathered his bag and bolted out of the room, face bright red and feeling as though the ground would fall beneath his feet.
“Hi,” John murmured into the phone.
“You practically fainted.”
“It’s perfect on you,” John replied.
John really did think about what Molly said. He thought about it as he trudged through the rest of his classes, he thought about it as he tackled Anderson at practice, he thought about it while scratching equations on his calc homework, and he thought about it past 1am when there was nothing left to do except wait helplessly for sleep, only to dream about Sherlock’s mercurial eyes and the way he smiled, a small tug on the corner of his lips.
John sighed, his thumb hovering over the call button. He knew he should call Mary and tease and flirt with her and tell her he missed her too, but it seemed infinitely.. easier to talk to Sherlock and listen to him ramble and talk about completely silly things with John until they both fell asleep on the phone. John imagined a fork in the road, and whatever decision he made right now would lead him on a path he couldn’t back away from.
b) Relaxation of muscles susbequent to rigor mortis
“What?”
John let out the breath he hadn’t know he’d been holding. The interviewer thought he had potential. Maybe he had a chance after all.
“Well,” John mumbled. “Yeah.” He looked up at Sherlock and remembered something he could say. “How’s that experiment going?” John asked, “the one with the mold.”
There was a note stuck to it. Sherlock’s spidery handwriting read:
“Mr. Holmes. You will likely fail the class if you don’t go on this trip. We’ll be visiting history museums and galleries, knowledge you can’t get here with your nose in a textbook.” Mr. Verdue said firmly. “And if I let everyone change roommates, it would be complete chaos. You are going on this trip, and you’re staying with your assigned partner. That’s final.”
Maybe you don’t see it, but Sherlock, the more time I spend with you, the more time I want to spend with you. And it’s destructive. JW
(Sat 2:52am)
d) Trace evidence of nitroglycerine
(Sat 1:09am)
“Sherlock, we should stop by the coffee place before we go back to school.”
“Oh right,” Sherlock scoffed, standing up and fully facing John. “You tried so hard that you couldn’t even look me in the eyes after what happened in the garden.”
John had a half-hatched plan for Sherlock’s present, but he had no idea how he was going to be able to carry it out. He’d briefly considered calling Mycroft; he’d heard a lot about Sherlock’s incredibly influential brother fresh out of Uni while Sherlock grumbled about his “fat head” and how he was always butting into his business. He didn’t even have Mycroft’s number, and even if he did, Sherlock would undoubtedly go into a week long sulk and wouldn’t enjoy his present at all.
c) Matching sand samples
They stepped into the small coffee shop, Angelo’s. It was empty except for a exhausted looking woman typing rapidly on her Mac in a booth.
Which meant John did a lot of thinking. Mr. Brooke’s words stayed in his head.
“Don’t be ridiculous,” John said, “You can’t sleep on the floor.”
“Have a great summer John,” Sherlock said quietly.
Then he lied down and stared at the ceiling, listening to the hum of the air conditioning. He proceeded to not think about Sherlock for the next two hours.
But everyone knew of him.
“I thought you said that you were able to solve these cold cases with just news articles?” John asked pointedly.
(Sat 1:39am)
John plopped down at their lunch table, getting away from all the muttering. Sherlock went to the library to find something on the
He figured he wouldn’t be much help now anyways, Sherlock seemed to be doing fine. After John checked the time and saw it was almost midnight, he decided they were going to need some caffeine if they were going to pull another all-nighter.
“Does everyone at this table think I’m dating Sherlock Holmes?” He asked loudly, somewhat exasperated.
John stepped forward. “Don’t you dare. I tried,” John could feel his voice about to break, “so hard to stay with you.”
John’s heart warmed at the ‘we’.
Sherlock groaned. “I’ve been conducting some experiments with liver but it’s really boring. Why can’t you be here already?”
The barista came over, holding two small cups in his hand. “Two espressos, double shots each.”
She looked up at him from the rim of her cup of coffee, green eyes burning and John suddenly felt incredibly guilty. No, she was nothing like Sherlock, no one ever could be, but she was pretty, and nice, and genuinely liked John.
Sherlock looked slightly surprised.
Surprisingly, summer didn’t pass as agonizingly slowly as John feared it would. The seconds that he didn’t spend pondering Sherlock were spent on playing on a rugby team in a nearby park, and rereading textbooks.
They took a taxi to Barts, where they kept the records of the corpses. If the taxi driver thought there was anything odd about two teenage boys taking a ride to the hospital, he didn’t say anything.
She was still pouting, but she nodded. “I want that too.”
I don’t know. Maybe. Sometimes it’s better to figure out things by myself. JW
“This is, the best present. I. ” Sherlock seemed to be for once, without words. It was worth it, owing Greg a thousand favors to get them into this museum, just to see the astonished look on Sherlock’s face.
(Sat 1:54am)
“You are quite the enigma, John Watson.”
“Whoever she is,” she finally said, her voice restrained with bitterness and resignation. “I hope it’s worth it.”
John pictured the diagrams he’d read about the human hand. “The hand is supplied by the median, ulnar, and radial nerves. The motor fibers to the intrinsic muscles of the hand, which are carried by the median and ulnar nerves, are derived from the T1 segment of the spinal cord.”
“I’m telling you,” Sherlock repeated, clenching his jaw. “All the evidence you need is in that house. If you’ll just listen to me—“
John waited for Sherlock to ask him for his name as well.
His distaste for most social interactions except those with his closest friends made him special, important. He was both the ‘freak’, a term that made John’s stomach turn, and the ‘genius’. Half the school hated him, the other half begrudgingly admired him.
Naturally, in any school, the artistic and intellectual people were considered inferior in the eyes of the popular ones. When John learned this, he was both disappointed that Newberry was not any different yet was also completely unsurprised.
Sherlock beckoned for John to come closer, and John squinted, trying to read the impossible handwriting. “What’s most interesting,” Sherlock continued, “is that at the time there were hundreds of letters sent to the police and newspapers with people claiming they were Jack the Ripper, but this ‘From Hell’ letter came with a macabre souvenir for the police that convinced them it wasn’t a hoax, half of a kidney.”
“Oh really?” Sherlock said, disbelieving. “Then why did you push me away so many times?”
Mary nodded, moving closer to John. “I haven’t seen you in so long, and we’re alone. For once.” She reached for his hand and held it, leaning in for a kiss. John acquiesced. They kissed for a bit, but before she could reach to tug off his shirt, John pushed her back gently.
What really set John’s teeth on edge was the disgusting reaction from the people who thought of themselves as the greatest gift to ever grace the earth.
Sherlock’s electric blue gaze locked with his, and in that moment John knew that Sherlock could read everything in his mind.
It was perfect for Sherlock, who was currently pressing his face up against the glass and staring at an old letter. .
c) William Bass
c) All the choices are correct
They came to the front of the room, and upon seeing the room number, they exchanged a look. The bright plaque on the oak door, sure enough, was 221.
John stared unseeingly at the ceiling, counting Sherlock’s steps.
“Same,” she replied.
“You’ll probably want to eat quickly. Class starts in about twenty minutes, and I’m sure you’d rather not be late to Mr. Wallace’s again.”
When he told his mom about his grades, she didn’t look angry or upset, just mildly disappointed. And that was a punch in the gut. With a pat on the back and her telling him that it wasn’t his fault, John felt like the worst person ever. His mom didn’t know that he was pretty much disregarding anything and everything of importance to go running off with Sherlock to catch a burglar on the Thames or what ever other case that John could inevitably follow Sherlock on.
John chuckled, “I figured. I didn’t want you to get arrested.”
Walking down the halls with his best friend, John could hear the whispers, and feel their stares boring into him and Sherlock. Eyes tracking their every move. John supposed that he might’ve been a bit paranoid, but he wasn’t blind, or deaf.
Molly smiled brightly and asked him about the plot. Really, she was so cheery all the time, John wondered how she did it. As he was half heartedly giving a summary on everything that had happened so far, he found himself glancing at Sherlock through his periphery. Victor had scooted incredibly, uncomfortably close to Sherlock, and his side was almost entirely pressed up against him. Normally, Sherlock would’ve flinched or moved away at such an invasion of personal space, but he only smiled at Victor and continued talking animatedly.
John knew that his grades had been sinking over the year, going from a perfect 5.0 GPA to a 3. He also knew that his mom didn’t want to pressure him and never bothered him about it, assuming that he was stressed in a competitive environment like Newberry. The more he thought about it, the more guilty he felt. Truth is, he’d just been so busy with Sherlock that he didn’t feel the motivation to work so hard in his classes anymore. John suspected that the only reason he still had a 3.0 was because he had a genius of a roommate.
“But John, we aren’t allowed to leave campus until next year,” Molly chimed in.
There was one other conclusion he had drawn in his first year at Newberry. He was absolutely in love with his best friend, Sherlock Holmes.
He blinked. “You’re kidding me, right Sherlock?”
“I’ve been wanting to go here for ages,” Sherlock said. “If you hadn’t done this, I would of certainly managed to make my way into this museum in more unsavory methods.”
“Eh,” came Sherlock’s vague response. “Anyways, what time are you getting here Monday?”
Really, it should’ve been ridiculous to think like this, when he’d only just met Sherlock.
John shifted uncomfortably and tried to muster a polite greeting.
Sherlock still looked shell-shocked.
“You don’t seem happy mate,” Greg said.
“Sorry sweetheart,” John said, catching her hands and stroking them. “I want to do this properly. Not a quick shag on my dorm bed.”
John sighed and made his way over to Sherlock.
“No,” John said simply.
John felt horrible that his two-year first relationship just ended and he felt nothing.
“Saturday morning, we need to go to a hardware shop near Brixton. The robber was seen inside.”
The other boy seemed to jerk. “Amazing?”
“Do you like the violin?”
Then, Sherlock nudged him again.
And in that month, Mary broke up with him. John didn’t blame her, frankly she was a saint for not doing it earlier. His energy was never one hundred percent focused on her. He was so busy, drawn into his pointless tasks, that they hardly spent time together anymore, and when they did, he was always drifting off.
You’re like a train wreck, and some train wrecks you can’t get out of. JW
John smiled. “Nice to know I’m missed.”
Sherlock’s lips tugged up into a faint smirk and walked into the classroom without another word.
Oh. I. JW
John watched as his class disbursed and headed off to their rooms, and then Irene left with Kate after pinching his arm and whispering good luck After gathering his nerve, he went over to Sherlock, who was still enraptured in conversation with Victor. Sherlock though quieted the instant he saw John coming over, and there was an awkward pause before Victor patted Sherlock’s arm and walked away too.
“Yes, please, tell me what it is about him that makes you actually feel things??
“Still,” John insisted, “you need to take care of yourself.”
Sherlock looked at him. “Because I want to solve this case, and you’d keep bugging me about the project if we didn’t do it.”
“Not Greg,” Mary said, propping her hip against the door frame. “Sorry to disappoint,” she teased, smiling at John.
Goodnight Sherlock. JW
Because it’s not just what you say. It never felt right with them, and it still doesn’t feel right with Michaela. JW
“I want to know about your relationship with Sherlock.”
a) Fossilised micro-organisms
“I’m sorry,” John finally said. “I can’t do this.”
John grinned.
“Sherlock,” John mumbled.
“I don’t believe that’s any of your business,” John said.
Sherlock read the mildly panicked expression on his face. “I didn’t want to wake you. I already went down to the breakfast hall and brought back some food.” He gestured to the table. “It’s over there. I didn’t know what you liked, so I got a bit of everything.”
He sighed. “Must I repeat myself?”
“What’s wrong?” She asked, sighing and sliding onto the bench next to him.
John arched an eyebrow. “Should I ask how?”
“Hey,” John said stiffly. “Can I talk to you?”
As it turned out, Sherlock must’ve had at least a shred of self-preservation, or perhaps he was as much of a genius as he claimed to be, but the two boys didn’t end up actually having to tackle the murderer or something as stupid as that.
“Do you know anything about Sherlock Holmes?” He finally asked.
“Yes, well, I was defending your virtue,” John half-heartedly joked. Anger lingered from what Sebastian said. Punching him was incredibly satisfying, but not enough.
It was those thoughts that kept him up at night. John was spiraling down a staircase of self-destruction every moment with Sherlock and he knew it. But John also knew he would give anything just for one more second with him.
, John thought. He swung his arm back and the sound of his fist connecting with the bastard’s nose was the most satisfying thing he’d heard all day.
John flushed, looking down. Since when did it become so hard to talk to Sherlock? “Um. No. I just haven’t seen you in a while so..” John trailed off.
After some guessing, John finished his sheet.
birthday was in a week, and John was racking his brain trying to think of a gift. Reserving the school’s main lounge and throwing a small party with some friends was out of the question, as Sherlock would cringe if John mentioned some sort of birthday celebration.
(See the end of the chapter for
No you wouldn’t, I’ve lived with you long enough to know how you act when you don’t get to your experiments on time. JW
“No, nothing quite so tragic,” Sherlock admonished, and John suspected that he really could read minds. “She’s alive and perfectly well.”
John stretched and stifled a loud yawn, shutting his book and stuffing it in his bag. As the rest of the bus roused and started lining down the aisles to get off, John felt the tight coil of anticipation and terror rise up again in his stomach. Sherlock Sherlock Sherlock tight up against Victor on the bus, and Victor looking at him resting on his chest with a foolish grin. John wondered if he’d looked at Sherlock like that too.
7. It is the function of a coroner to conduct inquiries into all deaths which are not natural or expected. However, originally the job of coroner was to perform which of the following functions?
“Put yourself in the killer’s shoes John. Why would he bother taking the effort to stage the death as asphyxiation? To mask the poison. That means that the poison had a clue, a clue that could lead us to the killer.”
Once, out of boredom and reluctant fascination with the boy, John tried making a list of all the topics he knew of and Sherlock’s level of expertise at it.
It’s different. JW
John’s chuckle was muffled by the arm he was currently burying his head into. He was so tired, and it was the third night in a row they’d done this.
d) Dust
“Yeah. I heard Mr. Wallace is pretty hard on late-comers,” she said.
Sherlock nodded and they walked in stilted silence towards the elevator “So, um, how are your classes?” John asked, trying to make conversation and feeling all the words he wanted to say clog up in his throat.
Sherlock jumped up from where he was sitting and started pacing frantically. “Stupid…. he must’ve told John… I… go and ruined it all..” John caught fragments of Sherlock’s rapid mumbling.
She was running her fingers up and down his chest now, and really, John would be a total idiot if he turned her down now. Which was why he found himself saying:
John nodded, and she pressed her lips together into a thin line. John could see her struggling between her desire to yell at John for being the worst boyfriend ever, which he deserved, and wanting to remain civil.
Sherlock, as expected, rolled his eyes. “There are more landmarks in France then just the Eiffel Tower and Louvre in Paris.
John quieted and stared at the stage. The lights dimmed and after what seemed like an infinity, the curtains slowly rose.
John thought about buying crime history novels or something along those lines, but Sherlock’s collection of books about criminology might actually surpass his own bookshelves of medical textbooks at home. John couldn’t go one minute without seeing some book or paper about crime lying around their dorm room, and that’s not including the giant bookshelf that’s completely packed with Sherlock’s books. It would take weeks or possibly months for John to find a book Sherlock didn’t already have.
I enjoy watching you deduce incredible things from the smallest of details. You save so many lives, and you do it all without a second thought. And as you’ve already pointed out, I have my morbid side. I actually get quite a thrill from dangerous situations. JW
John mentally added that to the list of things Sherlock likes and dislikes, and realized that the lists only consisted of three things. There was so much John didn’t know about his best friend.
John could feel Sherlock’s eye roll, but he did stop leaning against John. He sighed in relief, Sherlock pressed up against him for an hour? Not a good idea.
When John looked at Sherlock with a smile on his face, Sherlock’s eyes were wide and he looked at John and then back to the door. “You,” he breathed.
“I’m not!” John protested.
“This was lovely John,” Mary said, smiling warmly at him. Since they were second years and were allowed to leave campus now, he had taken her to the movies and dinner. They were standing in front of her dorm, and her cheeks were still slightly pink from the wind. She was looking up at him through her lashes and John leaned down to kiss her. He’d only meant it to be a goodnight peck, but Mary wrapped her arms around him and pulled him closer, her back pressed against the door. Her lips were warm and inviting, unlike…
A strange look came into Sherlock’s eyes, and there was a tension laden pause before he replied quietly that he hadn’t tried any cases since the last one he and John went on together.
John couldn’t bear losing Sherlock like that. He knew that their friendship would be destroyed if they got together and it just didn’t work out. And John knew it would be painful. Infinitely more painful than just not being able to touch Sherlock, not being able to tell him how much he truly cared.
He figured that Sherlock was joking. John laughed along, mainly so that he could see Sherlock grin again.
“Class, we’re going on a trip to Edinburgh next month.” Mr. Verdue announced, excited chatter and a whoop from someone filled the classroom and their teacher had to shout the next part for everyone to hear, “I’m passing around a list of the roommates.” Some disappointed groans came from the people near them, muttering under their breaths about how stupid it was that they had to be assigned partners. John, for his part, was glad. It would be too painful to watch Sherlock choose Victor and imagine the two of them in a hotel room, laughing and talking through the night. John knew he was being ridiculous, they probably did that every night anyways.
John shuffled. He didn’t really want to tell the teacher that he got lost and fell on his arse.
Surprisingly, Sherlock laughed lightly. “Of course. I didn’t peg you as a musician.”
“Well,” Greg sighed, “you’re gonna be getting lucky with Kate, while I’m stuck with Seb.”
Sherlock smirked, a little half smirk that sent frissons down John’s spine. “You aren’t telling me that you actually mind this?”
“No,” Sherlock said, looking up John with so much emotion that John shut his mouth instantly. “You don’t get to do that.”
Faint amusement was dancing on Sherlock’s face at John’s sleepy mutter.
John took a bite of his lasagna and let out a moan. It was heavenly, the mozzarella practically melted on his tongue. He looked up and saw Sherlock twirling strands of linguine onto his fork and staring at John with amusement.
Sherlock Holmes, in a mere week, tore all those walls down and revealed a boy who now itched at the prospect of breaking boundaries no matter the consequences. A boy who now wanted to never stop running, never stop following the mad man, Sherlock Holmes.
Sherlock bit down on his lip as if trying to stop laughing. John could still see mirth lighting his eyes.
a) Bullet comparison
John found Greg several minutes later in one of the dining rooms with his arm slung around Moly and the two of them laughing together. John smiled slightly. Looks like Molly got over her crush on Sherlock. What a shining example she was. John backed away and was about to leave the two of them alone when Greg shouted John’s name.
The second time John punched someone in the face for Sherlock was several months later, and perhaps John should’ve thought through punching the son of the headmaster and the captain of the wrestling team because he came back to the dorm nursing a swollen eye and was promised a trip to the headmaster’s office where he would be given more detentions and a phone call to his mom.
If it was possible, John’s eyes widened even further. “They hired a fifteen year old?!”
“Unfortunately I haven’t figured out what it is,” Sherlock continued.
John froze, he didn’t think Sherlock would bring up the kiss.
After spending nearly a year of sharing a room with Sherlock and following the boy everywhere, John had concluded several important things.
John sat down on a bench in the garden, waiting for his mom to come and pick him up. Idly, John watched a squirrel skitter across the grass.
Molly shot him a disbelieving look. “I seriously doubt that.”
He pointed to the only two empty seats in the class.
It was a new era, John told himself as he set his bags down in his dorm. Greg hadn’t arrived yet, so John busied himself with taking out his clothes and hanging it up in his closet, organizing his textbooks on the desk, and feeling completely restless. The dorm looked empty without papers strewn around the tables and chairs, and their small kitchen looked lonely without countless test tubes and mysterious experiments. John huffed at the irony, how many times had he begged Sherlock to clean their goddamned dorm?
John supposed he should’ve mourned her. And in a way he did. He mourned the normalcy he had feigned while with her, because even if they were never in love, she was his shot at a typical high school sweetheart. John knew that was not possible with Sherlock, even if in his wildest dreams Sherlock wanted him now, it would never be normal with Sherlock. It wouldn’t be coy looks exchanged across lunch tables, flirty notes passed in class, heated make out sessions in the theatre. It would be adrenaline rushes at 3am as he snuck out with Sherlock to chase down yet another criminal, phone calls made to Scotland Yard. It would be elation at morbidity. There was nothing mundane, nothing typical about Sherlock. And Christ, they were only seventeen.
“Is this John Watson?”
“Hey, stop that,” Molly said gently, interrupting his monologue and he increasing panic in his mind.
There was a pause. “To put it indelicately, are you sleeping with my brother?”
When the door opened, John was surprised to see it was Mary standing at the open door.
Sherlock chuckled. “I know.”
John a cup of tea and a coffee. After stirring in the sugar, he walked back over to the bed and held it out to Sherlock.
“Do you want it to be?” John smirked.
Sherlock blinked. “Why?”
Lunch was an opportunity for him to unload his problems on his friends. While they weren’t as close to Sherlock as they were to John, they could offer some insight. Unfortunately, Sherlock decided that he would work on his experiment in the chem lab in the evening instead of during lunch like he usually did.
“Don’t destroy anything,” John warned, imaging the dorm a complete mess when he gets there.
Sherlock rolled his eyes, dropping the topic.
“John,” Sherlock greeted, sounding somewhat surprised but happy.
The ones that were medical he understood easily.
John grinned wider, bear-tackling Sherlock into a hug anyways. Sherlock stiffened for a moment, and then seemed to relax slightly. He awkwardly patted John’s back. They rarely hugged. Sherlock wasn’t much for displays of affections, and John tried to memorize every detail of what it felt like to hug him.
The bus rolled to a slow stop in front of a hotel, and John notes that It’s one of the chains he sees across Europe. The bus was subdued; most people were still sleeping. He glances over at Greg, who had his mouth tipped half open and head lolled onto Molly’s shoulder, and then he catches Molly’s eyes, who give him a small smile before gently shaking Greg awake.
“BECAUSE I LOVE YOU, AND I WAS TERRIFIED,” John shouted, not realizing what he’d really said until Sherlock’s eyes widened. John covered his mouth immediately, but it was too late.
“Are we still going to be roommates next year?” John said finally.
John blinked and looked at her, feigning innocence.
He lead them down a hall and there was an oak door at the end of it. A plaque marking it the Scotland Yard museum.
John toed the popularity line. When he played rugby, he was seen as a jock. When he chose to stay in the library with Sherlock and help him look for books on mold, he was a nerd. John was well-liked, he knew that. He had friends and a group, but he would never consider himself popular.
Dimmock’s grin grew. “We always wondered how the freak got you to be friends with him. But, well now we see.” His eyes glinted. “That faggot can finally put that smartass mouth of his to good use.”
“Really,” Sherlock insisted, “it’s fine.”
“By who?” John asked.
They stayed like that for the rest of the period, fingers intertwined.
He had planned everything to the last second.
I'm so sorry it's been three months since I updated, I've been so busy. I'll try to be more regular from now on.
Molly blinked, then nodded. “Right, of course he has.”
“Why?” John said, swallowing a lump in his throat. All those names. Not Sherlock, Sherlock didn’t even care about him anymore. “I’m great, better than ever.”
While it was still true that they’d only met just that morning, it suddenly didn’t seem so ridiculous to think that he could get lost in the entity that was Sherlock Holmes.
“You’ll like this one.” John sat down in the booth and gestured for Sherlock to do the same. “So here’s the plan. We’re going to have coffee here so that I don’t accidentally fall asleep on you tonight, and then we’re going to eat something, No I don’t care that you’re not hungry, it’s been a day since you ate anything substantial. Afterwards,” John waved his arms dramatically, “the best birthday present in the history of birthday presents.”
John went and studied frantically in the library for the rest of the period, feeling that if he let himself have even a moment of rest, the ache in his heart would spread and poison his entire body.
5. In 1835, Henry Goddard was asked to investigate a burglary in Southampton, England. The butler said a shot had been fired as he struggled with the burglars. Goddard retrieved the bullet and disproved the butler’s version of events by using which technique?
Sherlock shrugged. “If it helps with solving criminal cases, I make it my business to gather all the information on the topic.”
John stared at him for a full second. “No. And I believe that’s none of your business.”
And each time, the pressure on John’s chest grew.
Right. Oops. John turned to Sherlock, “it’s a king bed, they didn’t have any doubles left.”
John felt a pang of regret he never stuck through with the violin as he watched the boy. Really, it was unfair how graceful and perfect he looked on the stage. Of course the other musicians were talented and perfect as well, but John really couldn’t tear his eyes off of him long enough to notice anyone else.
“I don’t know what to do,” John finally said. “Sherlock doesn’t, he doesn’t do that. And I just-it just. Everything. You know. There’s this longing in my heart and it hurts so much, and I want to run straight to him and never let him go, but I also want to just take off in the other direction as fast as I can.” John laughed, hollow and mirthless. “Because I know every second with him I fall further, and one day I’ll be ripped apart when he finally leaves.” His voice cracked at the end.
“That sounds interesting. Tell me, what’s in my showers?”
“Sherlock?”
“Sherlock’s birthday is in a week. I’m trying to surprise him, and I have an idea but I need your guys’ input. I’ve hit a bit of a roadblock.”
As soon as Sherlock left for the bathroom, John leaned in conspiratorially towards his friends.
“But I can’t drink that.”
“W-what? No, of course not,” John stuttered, eyes widening. John’s tried his best to put all thoughts of Sherlock in that way out of his mind. It helps him function.
But still, time passed and the chasm between he and Sherlock stopped hurting as much as it used to, and John had begun to think that Sherlock was just another warped memory, not forgotten, never forgotten, but fading slowly.
Glad you find my failing love life amusing. JW
“Oi,” John interrupted, grinning. “Give me a hug you git.”
Finally John glanced down at his phone to check the time.
Sherlock hung up and John found himself setting the phone down with a stupid smile on his face.
“No,” John repeated, crossing his arms. “How do you even know these things?”
John watched as Sherlock became more and more agitated.
He could feel Sherlock staring intensely at him.
Well, actually, I did end up with you as my best friend. JW
Mr. Brooke’s pleasant demeanor shifted. His snake-eyes narrowed and he picked up the printed transcript from this semester. John flinched.
(Sat 2:27am)
John would be lying if he said that didn’t cause a little burst of warmth in his chest, but he insisted.
I don’t know how to say it. JW
John cleared his throat. “Well, this is my birthday present to you.”
“I don’t like surprises.” Sherlock frowned.
“Then why have you gotten B’s and some C’s in almost all your classes?” his counselor asked sharply.
John forced his blush down. He’d heard too much giggling in the halls and seen enough pointed glances to be shy about this now.
They decided to walk to New Scotland Yard instead of taking the tube. The wind was crisp and John moved closer to Sherlock as they were walking. Whenever their hands bumped together, John’s face warmed slightly.
It was during one of their dates actually. He’d taken her to the cinema, and they were at a small café right after the movie. She’d taken his hand during the movie, and John’s stomach turned at how much he remembered the way Sherlock’s fingertips felt beneath his. She was colder on their walk to the café, and John knew that she knew.
“I don’t understand,” John said, frustrated, “Do I really bother you that much?”
He didn’t even know the boy’s name, but he knew that there was something special about that violinist.
(Sat 2:51am)
Sherlock looked amused, even as the giggles wore off. “You didn’t wake up even after I called your name five times. I decided it was time for more drastic measures.” He smirked as he continued, “You’re lucky I didn’t resort to mouth to mouth resuscitation.”
Finally Sherlock hung up and his phone gave it a murderous glare, as if it were the phone’s fault that the police were looking a gift horse in the mouth.
John let out his breath shakily, walking back to his room. It was pitch black in the dorm and John flicked the light on, sighing as he sat on his bed. Sherlock was gone again. These days, he spent more free time in the lab than in their dorm. John couldn’t blame him, he’d been doing the exact same thing, but he missed his best friend.
(Sat 1:25am)
d) William (Bill) Clinton
“You two must be Sherlock and John, Greg’s friends. I’m Detective Inspector William Lestrade,” he said, extending his hand.
“Good. Earlier the better.”
Oh hell, he was even beginning to sound like Sherlock.
He looked away from John at that, and John wasn’t stupid enough to not notice the crestfallen look on his face. His heart hurt. He wanted to try so badly, but the consequences…
Sherlock smiled at John for a moment, and John was acutely aware how close they were and the warmth of Sherlock’s hand on his arm. Whatever it was, Sherlock seemed to snap out of it. “Let’s go in!” Sherlock bounced, pulling John through the doors.
John tried to match the boy’s long strides as they quickly walked towards the class.
The woman across smiled slightly and typed something on her laptop.
John immediately felt guilty, he was so caught up in thoughts of Sherlock, he completely forgot about Mary. He’d asked her out a several weeks before break started, and she was sweet, and funny, and pretty, and… not Sherlock. They held hands and went to the movies, and when Mary giggled at his joke, he leaned in and kissed her, and all he could think about was how Sherlock’s lips would feel against his.
At this rate, he was going to be so late to first period.
I didn’t mean to spring it on you like that. JW
Mary leaned in closer to him again, moving to his ear. “Yes I do,” she hummed. “And I remember how good you looked in that jersey.”
As he heard the tell-tale gurgling of the coffee maker, John grinned and had a feeling that he just won a game he didn’t know they were having.
“And I bet you know all of them.”
John sat up straighter. “It doesn’t matter. I’m not going to stop being friends with Sherlock and nothing you can say will change that.
(Sat 2:14am)
Suddenly, he could see himself shaking hands with the teaching staff of Cambridge.
John quickly looked over them. One seemed familiar.
(Sat 3:08am)
Sherlock wasn’t pacing or working on the computer; he was simply sitting in a chair, looking at John with such intensity that he was almost afraid to move.
“We should probably head up,” John said, somewhat awkwardly, “it’s getting late.”
Later, John laid on his bed, staring at the ceiling.
Nononono, John muttered, it wasn’t supposed to be like this. He had a whole plan for telling Sherlock how sorry he was and then how much he wanted him back in his life. This was. not. the. plan.
(Sat 12:57am)
John watched Sherlock drink his cappuccino and suddenly a question was burning on his mind.
John’s eyebrows raised. “You what? You do realize that two spoons of sugar are two spoons of sugar no matter who adds it in.”
John was panting and had sweated mostly through his shirt and shorts when he spotted a tall boy perched on the bleachers in the corner, looking engrossed in a book. John came to a stop and stared, heart pounding irrationally fast. Once he looked closer, he realized that he was too tall, hair brown and straight instead of dark curls. John shut his eyes and looked away, absolutely not thinking about the time Sherlock waited for him after a game and hugged him even though he was so sweaty and—
c) The male skull has a heavier jaw
A horrified expression came across Mike’s face, and John laughed, knowing she was totally messing with him. Mr. Verdue wasn’t exactly anyone’s idea of a silver fox.
John sighed in response but didn’t say anything else.
“Okay then.” John sat down on the bed and plopped Sherlock’s cup onto the desk next to them. He leaned back against the wall and slowly sipped at his tea.
John was grateful when Mike tackled him for the ball.
If only Sherlock didn’t exist.
Not brit-picked, but beta-ed by the lovely @TheBlazingMelody
John’s breath caught.
Once she finished her sheet, he turned towards her and smiled.
Sherlock memorized everything on the periodic table and what their reaction was to each other, yet he didn’t know that the earth went around the sun.
“Criminals to catch!” Sherlock seemed to bounce around like an excited puppy, until John finally gave in and followed him down the hall.
Two seconds after opening it, he sighed and slammed it closed.
Because it would hurt infinitely more to let you go now. To know that there will never be more time with you, moments to treasure. JW
Smiling at Sherlock gratefully, John drank the espresso.
He visited the school campus twice already.
“It’s an abandoned house right off of Foster Lane and Byward Street.” There was a pause and Sherlock rolled his eyes. “I can’t be more specific than that. You can’t miss it. There are wooden planks nailed to the windows and doors. It’s the only house near here that looks like that.”
His mother smiled. “You’ll get in Johnny. You’re just like your father, you know way too much about medical rubbish.”
Just as John had almost cleared his thoughts enough so that he could go back to his book, his phone rang. It was Sherlock.
It had become a cycle. Something would happen between Sherlock and John, John would think everything was changing, procked panic, and then nothing would happen.
The boy seemed so mysterious and John had a sudden itch to get to know him.
Time after time John asked Sherlock to come watch, as he was his best friend, but John was still shocked when Sherlock finally consented to watch at this match.
“You alright?”
“It’s almost three. Go to bed.”
There was silence for a moment, and John could almost imagine Sherlock lying on his bed miles away, with his phone by his ear.
He felt a odd warmth in his stomach and smiled at Sherlock. He grabbed the chair by his desk and dragged it to sit next to Sherlock.
When the bell rang, John had to stay behind to turn in a late homework assignment. After he handed it to Mr. Verdue, John left, unaware that Sherlock was still in the classroom. John really didn’t mean to, but halfway down the hall he realized he had forgotten his notebook and went back to get it. John had stepped halfway through the doorway when he heard the Sherlock’s low timbre. Maybe it was the urgency in his voice that made John stop in his tracks, backing away from the door.
And there it was. The casual indifference Sherlock had towards him now, pushing John away in every instance. John’s hand twitched and he suddenly didn’t know what to do with them, rest them by his side? Play with his fingers? John looked down and nodded. “Yeah. Of course,” he said. Victor Trevor. Of course him. Of course Sherlock would choose him over John.
John hadn’t bothered to argue with her. He knew it was true. While they were both fond of each other and the cuddles on the sofa; they just didn’t have the similarities or the spark they needed to last.
(Sat 12:44am)
“All good things, I’m sure,” Mycroft said dryly.
John swallowed, looking up and meeting Sherlock’s molten green eyes with something akin to dread and anticipation. John’s lips parted slightly and he was chanting in his head for Sherlock to do something, anything to break the electric silence filling the air around them.
Mike glanced down at his phone. “It’s almost eight, I should go talk to Melinda.”
John nodded.
His attention went to Molly, and he felt bad for thinking this afterwards, but she looked liked someone set her seat on fire. Her face was bright red and she was squirming a lot.
, John corrected in his mind. But he only nodded as she left.
Now, eight classes and three projects plus two homework assignments later, John is herded back to the theatre along with the rest of the first years.
I’m simply a temporary distraction. JW
John knew that some people chose to stay at Newberry over the weekend instead of going back every Friday night, and only went back on holidays. But that was only really for students who lived really far away, and as far as he knew Sherlock lived in London.
Sherlock’s grin grew. “You.”
Of course months of him avoiding his problems had to come to a head, and John realized that while staring at the innocuous sheet of paper in front of him.
“So,” John folded his hands. “Can you guys think of anything I can do? I thought about going to the station and just asking the officers if we could go inside. But I don’t think that’ll work.”
“It’s true that the science of bruising over time varies,” John admitted. “But these bruises are clearly fresh, and by eyeballing it, I’d say maybe an hour or two at most before the photograph was taken.”
“I won’t. Good night John.”
John’s eyebrows rose. “Really?”
On the first day back, John attempted to avoid Sherlock, a lost cause considering they almost had all their classes together and they shared a room. Nonetheless, John had somewhat succeeded in not making eye contact with him until History. Mr. Verdue looked extremely pale and was buried in a pile of tissues by his desk, and between sniffles he explained to the class that they’ll be watching a documentary.
Sherlock looked at him and cocked his head, and John could see that Sherlock was trying to read the situation. Going by the light in his eyes, he was starting to figure out what John’s present is. John bit back a smile.
John glanced at the coroner’s report again. “Since the cause of death was immediately ruled as asphyxiation, there was no autopsy of the body. Only a preliminary drugs test was run on the body. I’d say that some sort of poison was injected into the bloodstream, I can’t list them all on the top of my head, but there are several that would be virtually undetectable unless specifically tested for.”
“It’s 1:04. And I still haven’t done any of my homework,” John managed.
The cloak of complete darkness in the school struck around midnight, and John found himself shrugging on his jacket and sneaking out with Sherlock.
“What are your intentions with Sherlock Holmes?
“You know a lot about human biology?” Sherlock asked.
The detective inspector was nowhere in sight when John and Sherlock finally stepped out of the museum. John checked his phone and saw that it was nearly midnight.
John gaped at her, head spinning. Was she right? Is that what he was doing?
John jumped up and his cheeks were red, looking at anything but Sherlock. “We can’t do this,” John said, more of a reminder to himself than to Sherlock.
b) Tax collector
She looked up and blinked. “Very impressive Mr. Watson.” She smiled and typed something. “I must say, in all the years I’ve been interviewing students for Newberry Academy, I’ve never gotten the privilege of meeting a student with quite as much medical knowledge as you Mr. Watson.”
Finally he got bored of ignoring Sherlock’s stare and re-reading the same page that was shown on his laptop.
“We could get expelled, or even arrested!”
I don’t know what you want from me. JW
He rolled his eyes, looking to Greg for support. He only saw Greg trying to hide a grin.
John could see Sherlock struggle to not argue or throw a sharp retort at their teacher that would no doubt lead to a detention. Instead, John saw Sherlock swallow down his frustration and nod stiffly, hands fisted tightly at his sides. John knew that the conversation was over and he quickly turned around and left.
John leaned and kissed Sherlock again, softly. It was becoming his favorite thing to do.
“Thank you, that is all. You are dismissed.”
“What are your parents like?”
Sherlock didn’t say anything for a while. John stood and moved hesitantly closer to him, feeling a swell of oh so breakable hope in his chest.
It was the last rugby match of the year. John when he first signed up in spring the narrowed eyes and disapproving look from Sherlock. Sherlock thought of it as an uncivilized ‘sport’ that consisted of a bunch of sweaty boys with no IQ points pummeling each other for no reason.
Facing burning, John scrambled to get back onto his feet.
“I know,” John whispered. “I will spend forever trying to make it up to you.”
Once seated, he attempted to start a conversation with the student he had been assigned to follow around all day. This earned him a hard look and a shush motion.
“Hey!” Molly chirped as she plopped down on the empty seat next to him. “What are you reading?”
Thanks. That warms my heart. JW
When Mary pulled away, John was flushed and leaning towards her again. He hadn’t realized how frustrated just being near Sherlock had made him. “Happy valentines day,” Mary said, and unlocked the dorm door. She pecked his cheek one more time and closed the door.
Greg nodded, and he could hear Irene snicker. Sebastian was infamous for being the jealous, possessive boyfriend of Jim. One time, he beat up the poor soul who’d tried to flirt with Jim so badly he had to be sent to the nearest hospital. It was a wonder that he’d survived, John heard Seb had boxing parents and had a black belt in taekwondo
John hesitated, it would seem so pathetic to tell him the whole truth, how scared he was. “Because..” John said, running his hand through his hair, trying to find a way to say it, “Because it wouldn’t work.”
I know that there doesn't seem to be much of a point to this story, and this chapter was messy in its composition. I do have a plan for it, but apologies for not being able to put it together right now. I promise this will get better if you keep reading.
I'm sorry I haven't posted in like two months, I've just been so busy. Hopefully this chapter makes up for it, and I promise that soon the boys will be on their way to making up. The 'sharing a hotel room' trope never gets old *wink.*
“I’d rather not get expelled the first day I get here. You realize we have to do our homework right?”
“Good afternoon Mr. Brooke,” John said.
“Thanks,” John managed. Finally recovered enough to say something. “How did you know which room I was going to?”
John huffed and knocked Sherlock’s hand back slightly.
“I’m glad you like it, it took me a while to figure out what present to get you,” John admitted.
“I’m sorry Mr. Watson, but they don’t have any double rooms left, it’s going to have to be a single king bed,” Mr. Verdue said apologetically, and John knew that he felt bad about making him and Sherlock room together after Sherlock’s outburst, and more or less declaration of hatred for John.
John bumped against Sherlock, “hey, quit trying to push me off,” John whispered.
“Can’t you see? You’re spending all of your time with him and you’re failing because of that,” Mr. Brooke said, throwing up his hands.
So the next day John came up with an idea. It was a stupid idea, no doubt. But an idea.
1. Ted Bundy was an American serial killer who was convicted on the basis of which type of forensic evidence?
a) Gil Grissom
“Molly Hooper.” She smiled at him.
Sherlock and John fought back a smile. They had no idea Sherlock was the one behind the ‘anonymous’ tips.
John raised his eyebrow. “Really? Now?” They’d never gone farther than snogging and some touching.
“That’s great!” John beamed. “Can you call him and ask if he would be able to do us a favor? Tell him it’s a friend’s birthday and that he’s really interested in the history of crime.”
John let out a small laugh. “Then you are amazing.”
“It’s a birthday present from my father, I suppose he felt guilty for not being able to pick me up on the weekends.” Sherlock’s gaze fell on John. “Though I prefer it.”
All the air got knocked out of his lungs.
“You saw that last night’s research wasn’t sufficient.”
“Why does that matter!?”
“What time is it?” John asked.
John had always fancied that when he first said those three words, it would be over fireworks and shooting stars.
John propped himself onto his elbows. “What about?”
c) Pollens and spores
John gulped his espresso down, not caring that it scalded his throat. He eyed Sherlock’s cup with envy, watching the boy sip at it delicately.
(Sat 1:48am)
“Well we don’t actually have anything to turn in.”
“What’s your name?” John asked.
He was still pacing outside their dorm room and dreading the talk with Sherlock when the door flew open. Sherlock rushed out, grey eyes glittering and curls mussed in the most adorable way. John’s breath caught.
“Usually.”
He turned back to Sherlock, who was still curled into a ball and scrolling on the laptop. His face was illuminated by the soft glow from the screen. John had an inexplicable urge to smile.
“Wait, wait.” John stopped and pointed to the throat of corpse in the picture.
2.	He’d do anything to get him back.
It was no secret that she had a huge crush on Sherlock, it was something that everyone knew, but never mentioned.
Sighing, he pulled out a book. It was a mystery novel that he’d been reading for the past week. Flipping it open, a wry smile tugged at the corner of his lips. The differences between the Belgian detective in the books and Sherlock were far and wide, but the little lines of the detective boasting of his brain had reminded John, rather painfully, of Sherlock’s own pride in his reasoning.
They were, as expected, staring at him. Molly, Greg and Mike looked away and seemed slightly embarrassed and awkward. Irene kept the mischievous smile on her face.
“Fine, yeah we’re good,” John said vaguely, waving it away.
John Watson prided himself on his medical expertise, but all the knowledge in the world couldn’t heal the gash that Sherlock left on his heart. Only, it wasn’t Sherlock’s fault. John was the one who handed the knife to him, and the one who forced his hand.
“Because I used to be him!” John was almost shouting now, “I used to always be there next to you.”
Irene turned to him, raising her eyebrows. “Well, maybe you two will resolve your issues in a more… enlightened way,” she said, winking at John. John laughed and shook his head, knowing that was about to be the last thing that could happen.
… not a fight past midnight.
John nodded, his stomach rolling.
Sarcasm. I was being sarcastic. JW
“You need to stop spending time with Sherlock Holmes,” Mr. Brooke said.
“Happy New Year,” John said, a tinge of something sad in his voice.
“Alright,” Detective Inspector Lestrade coughed, “I’ll let you boys be. Shut the doors on your way out.”
Sherlock stopped pacing and looked at John thoughtfully. “Yes, I wonder why.”
“My name is Mr. Wallace. This is Honors Chemistry, but I want to start the school year off with something different.”
JOHN:
John found it difficult to keep the scowl on his face when Sherlock was absolutely gasping with laugher. It was contagious.
Sherlock huffed, “I’m trying to save you embarrassment,” he muttered.
Sherlock nodded.
Sherlock stopped instantly, and he stared at John. Whatever he must’ve seen in John’s expression made him relax again. “Never mind then,” Sherlock dismissed with a flap of his hand.
The tip of John’s ears flushed and tried not to stare. Sherlock was always slightly gangly, but moved with an incongruous grace that John was baffled by. It wasn’t Sherlock’s appearance that gave him such a domineering presence.
John had lunch next, and he just ran to the most isolated place he could find to try and gather his thoughts. The garden seemed like a safe bet.
His eyebrow arched and an amused smile tugged at the corner of his lips.
John grunted and batted away Sherlock’s fingers.
Mycroft didn’t reply for a moment. He finally said, “this won’t be the last time you hear from me John, I’ll be in touch,” and hung up abruptly.
Her eyes were soft and she nudged him with her arm. “I know how it feels to be devastatingly in love with someone. But I’ve seen the way Sherlock looked at you. Don’t give up hope yet.”
John huffed, “picking up something from Greg?” He knew Greg was studying on his own time to become a detective at Scotland Yard, like his uncle.
“Please John, I do this all the time. It’s just a part of the process.”
“Never mind. Forget everything I just said, Sherlock said.
Sherlock smiled. It almost seemed shy.
John smiled slightly. Typical.
Sherlock was quiet. And really. There wasn’t anything left to say. John turned around and left first, raising his fingers in a half-hearted wave. “See you later Sherlock,” John called out, his own footsteps ringing in his head.
“Hello?” he said.
(Fri 10:16pm)
“Then why did I—“
“Is that a challenge?”
John stared at him, dumfounded. Was Sherlock really so disgusted by him? He thought that things were better.
Sherlock moved closer. “And why do you even care John?” He asked harshly.
John did too. There were restrictions on what they could do on the weekdays, but on the weekends the possibilities were endless. It wasn’t just working on the latest case Sherlock found fascinating; their shared love for London led to ridiculous, amazing adventures across the city.
It was a week later, and after they’d gathered enough information on the killer to track his whereabouts, it came time to sneak out after curfew again.
High school was high school no matter how high the IQs.
“Oh god, they gave us our old dorm number,” John laughed, “what even is this?” Sherlock grinned in response and took one of the keys to open the door, and the light flickered on.
As recognition became to dawn on John, his face started burning again. He wondered briefly if he was doomed to blush forever in front of this boy.
That’s what held him back, and even if Sherlock felt the same way, he was just too valuable to be risked.
The first time John punched someone in the face for Sherlock because he called Sherlock a faggot. He was given two detentions and a warning.
“I’m your partner, why would you do the entire project without me?!”
Sherlock stepped in, a gust of warmth greeting him. His cheeks were pink from the brutal wind and inky curls messy. John inhaled sharply and stepped forward hesitantly.
Sherlock blinked and looked at the dirt and grass staining John’s uniform.
So when she broke up with him several days after the interview, John expected to be heart broken. He expected to feel numb.
She left ten minutes ago. Where are you now? JW
There were over two hundred classroom on the first floor alone.
John froze, he didn’t think Sherlock would bring up the kiss.
John felt that the was meant something.
John looked at him, bewildered. “Embarrassment?” He repeated.
Greg looked slightly relieved, “that’s fine, I’m not exactly dying to spend time with that psychopath.”
“Like the color of your eyes,” John said without thinking.
For the fifth time since he first received it, John opened Newberry Academy’s ten page program and read it cover to cover.
When he was seven, his mom attempted to start giving John lessons from a private violin teacher. At first, John was mesmerized the beautiful instrument and the sounds that his teacher could drag from it. Soon though, he learned just how difficult it was to actually play. He grew sick of the shrill sounds he kept making every time he pulled the bow.
“A week before school starts again.”
“I have been a professor at Newberry for ten years now, and I still have yet to come across a student who seems to have as much potential and enthusiasm for doctoring as you. I’ll put in a good word for you. I hope to see you as a student next year at Newberry Academy.”
Sherlock saw John waiting outside and seemed surprised. “Hello John,” Sherlock said, as though John were a stranger.
“Which side of the bed do you want?” John asked Sherlock, who was rummaging through the closet.
When John wasn’t reading medical books, or obsessing over Newberry’s offered classes and clubs, he had a girlfriend.
“John,” a voice interrupted his thoughts. “What are you still doing here?”
mushroom. He mumbled something about poison and darted to the library. John was too busy inappropriately staring at his best friend to protest Sherlock skipping lunch again to do research.
Less than three percent of those who apply are ever accepted, and they were the most prodigious, talented and all-out flawless teens in Britain.
Sherlock’s eyes widened, taken aback. “I’m rooming with Victor,” he said carefully, looking at John with an unreadable expression.
“Now.” He grabbed the stack of papers near his desk. “First fill out this sheet, to test your basic knowledge on forensics. Then you will choose a partner in this class.”
“Right.”
“But they’re your friends,” John said.
a) Safeguarding the monarch's property
It had gotten easier since the beginning of the year, it really had. Now, it wasn’t as frequent that he was suddenly struck by how utterly radiant and beautiful Sherlock was while he was in the midst of speaking. It left John trying to restart his heart.
(Sat 1:02am)
He crossed his arms over his chest and looked away from Sherlock, trying hard to not blush and embarrass himself further.
“John Watson.”
He looked up after a moment and resolutely looked at anything except for the distaste, and god help him, pity on Sherlock’s face. “Well, I’m going to room with Greg,” John said with as much pride as he could muster.
(Sat 1:53am)
“Sherlock Holmes.”
John was wrong, completely and totally wrong. This wasn’t easier. This was impossible.
Ignore all that, delete it. Whatever, please. JW
It was larger than John has expected, thought he didn’t quite know what to expect. He sort of just imagined a storage room with old guns and skulls. Instead, it was an actual museum. Dimly lit and oddly tasteful in its simple décor. The exhibits were in glass cases on wooden stands and plaques with its background history.
Mike looked somewhat scandalized, Molly blushed and Greg tried to muffle a snicker.
His counselor had always been somewhat… unnerving. John supposed that he was a good counselors, but something about him was just off. In the three meetings he’s had with him over the year, he’d always walked out of the office with a slight shiver and the need to shake off the whole conversation.
Sherlock looked at him, unconcerned. “So? I haven’t done mine either.”
“I can’t stay with John Watson in Edinburgh,” Sherlock said, his jaw tense.
“But this still doesn’t help us with the case. How can we trace this information back to the killer?” John asked.
John stood up stiffly, clenching his teeth, and exited the room.
“I’ve already taken attendance. What is your name young man?” The teacher looked at John.
“Yes.”
Sherlock scooted closer to him, their bodies almost bumping together. John sighed, and leaned his head against Sherlock’s shoulder, still looking at the grass.
John’s eyes traitorously ran over Sherlock’s lean frame again. The button up shirts and black trousers he always insisted on wearing everyday suddenly fitted him like a glove. And the mop of wild curls seemed to suit him even more now. Cheekbones more pronounced, as if they weren’t sharp enough already. He grew a head taller than John and those long legs became more obvious than ever. And those eyes. The intensity of his gaze was enough to make John think that Sherlock could hear every thought running through his mind.
“Hey!” Greg said, smiling brightly. “I didn’t see you there until just now, sorry.”
In fact, he wouldn’t be surprised now if she had a whip.
“I think we should break up.” Her words were sharp in the quiet of the café. And John felt like it was the rightful end of a long expected trail.
4. Lord Louis Mountbatten, a cousin of Queen Elizabeth II, was blown to pieces in 1979 when an IRA bomb exploded on his yacht. How did police link the murderer, Thomas McMahon, to the crime scene?
He had to talk to Sherlock, and John was terrified that Sherlock would shrug and end it like that. End what had once been the best part of John.
“Oh.”
He looked at the folder resting on Mr. Brooke’s desk and John suddenly had a sinking feeling why he was here.
“The Black Museum,” John started explaining what he wanted to do for Sherlock.
“What?” Sherlock said, “Why are you dragging Victor into this?”
He was sure of three things.
You were the one who wanted to go to the chem lab and ignite the eyeball or whatever other experiment you were fussing about earlier. You can do that now. JW
“Thank you. I have been reading medical journals and books for as long I can remember.”
After one final push, Sherlock fell back into his own chair, and he was looking at John with a murderous expression. His curls were messy and his face was scrunched up in a glare and John wanted to grab him and kiss him.
They spent the next couple hours talking about school and Mr. Verdue’s strangely shiny head, musing if he put oil on it every morning, and John was laughing so hard tears were rolling down his face. He was happier, and somehow the prospect of facing Sherlock later became less terrifying surrounded by his friends, knowing that there was something he could fall back on. Plus, the inevitability of the talk with Sherlock had somehow lifted a weight off John’s shoulder, as he accepted that he will do everything he could to win back Sherlock, praying that it’d be enough.
“You idiot,” John mumbled.
John crossed his legs and looked away.
“I. I didn’t,” John stuttered. What, he didn’t mean it? Yes, he meant every word. But Sherlock was not supposed to find out like this, he wasn’t really ever meant to.
“You… love me?” Sherlock repeated slowly.
It had become something close to an obsession. And quite an unhealthy one as John knew the odds of getting into Newberry Academy were practically nonexistent; hundreds of thousands of students applied annually. It was arguably the most prestigious boarding school in Britain.
“Yes, almost too much.”
They stayed embracing each other, just a moment longer then normal friends might’ve, but neither noticed.
John had to go check his room assignments. He hoped that he liked his roommate; he would have to share a room with him for the next four years.
Mr. Wallace cleared his throat. “Please turn them in at the end of class; I’ll be reviewing them later and I’ll plan your classwork this week based on them.”
“You’re an idiot John,” Sherlock said, looking at his bruised face with a mixture of fondness and irritation.
He sighed. “Relax John. I don’t actually go and catch the culprit. I’m not completely insane. I just go find out their location and then call the police. I try not to do too much of the dirty work. Apprehending the criminals myself takes too much energy.” Sherlock sniffed with disdain and went back to staring at the wall of their room.
Sherlock and John shared a grin and they both made a beeline for the black chair that was in the back of the class. It was the most comfortable thing in the room, and when John plopped onto it first, Sherlock scowled and fell on top of John, pushing him. The lights were turned off and they were far back enough in the corner of the class that no one really noticed two sixteen year old boys wrestling over a chair.
At first, John was so certain that it would pass, the tension between him and Sherlock would fade easily with a case, but as the days and weeks dragged on, John began to think that it was the end of the friendship he’d tried so hard to protect.
(Sat 1:30am)
Sherlock’s eyes snapped up to his and oh, they were close and collided and they were kissing. Sherlock’s lips were chapped and they weren’t quite positioned right, but John was certain that he’d never known anything better.
Last night, after they’d snuck back into their dorm room at 3 am, he collapsed on the bed and neglected his homework.
They wouldn’t be able to avoid each other on this trip, and John hoped that maybe it would be enough for them to salvage their relationship. Maybe if they were forced to spend time with each other and talk. Actually talk. They would be okay.
“We have the same ones John,” Sherlock said, with a slight grin that told John he was teasing. John felt relieved, and God, he hadn’t seen that smile directed towards him in so long. Too long.
(Sat 3:09am)
John grinned. “Good.”
The bell rang and John quickly went to his next class, feeling as though someone shot between him and Sherlock, leaving a jagged hole in their friendship.
He grinned. “Exactly. Now, If you would get over here and go through the files with me, we might be finished soon.” He threw another pair of black leather gloves to John. It hit him square in the chest.
First day of school.
“Yeah? Why? You didn’t seem to care about me back then, so why now?”
He shrugged. “Probably.”
Once he turned eight, his birthday present was a chance at another instrument. The piano. Once again, he was completely fascinated by it.
John shifted uncomfortably. He would’ve been blind to not notice his best friend’s… other traits.
This is where I found the forensics quiz, and just in case you were interested in the answers, they are posted there as well.
I think that’s the greatest compliment possible from you. JW
“And? What do you suggest is the actual cause of death then?” Sherlock asked.
Half asleep, John smiled languidly and reached up for Sherlock. I bet those curls are as soft as they look. As his senses started coming back, John slowly became aware that he was closing that already minuscule gap between he and Sherlock. John yelped, fully awake now. In his haste to distance himself from the all too inviting looking Sherlock, he violently snatched away his hand, dangerously close to Sherlock’s curls, and accidentally slamming it against the wood of the bed. John also scuttled away so fast that he forgot there wasn’t a wall behind him and tumbled off the bed.
John blinked. His mouth opened. Then closed. “You realize that these are cases that Scotland Yard has poured over for years. We can’t possibly solve these with just old police records in several hours.”
(Sat 2:06am)
After a mere two weeks, he completely abandoned the violin. His mother decided to not push, seeing the glares he would shoot the instrument every time he went near it.
So basically I’m forever alone? In that case, based on your ‘educated opinion’ is there anyone in this world who I am compatible with? JW
He turned and saw Sherlock two feet away and looking at John intently.
look in his eyes.
John tried to clear these traitorous thoughts as they walked out of the office.
“Hm?” Sherlock glanced up momentarily. “Oh, coffee will be fine. Black, two sugars.”
“John?” Sherlock asked, obviously observing the mini-panic attack John was currently having.
“Please,” he scoffed. “We’d hardly be expelled for it.”
d) Gravitational pooling of blood
As John walked out of the office, he couldn’t keep a huge smile off his face.
The rest of the holidays dragged on, and by the time New Years Eve came, John was longing to hear Sherlock’s voice again. It was just before midnight, and John knew Sherlock was still up, he always was, so John was about to call him to talk about anything at all when he got a text message.
John stood up and walked out of the room, once again feeling that shiver. He knew Mr. Brooke was right, he needed to start focusing on his school life.
“Really,” John said, not sure if he was trying to convince Molly or himself of that. “Don’t worry about me.” John smiled crookedly and tapped his book, “I’ve got all that I need here.”
Sherlock smirked and flicked the top of John’s hair.
“Not, not that I’ve noticed what color your eyes are.” John cringed. He should really stop talking now.
a) The male skull is usually larger
(Sat 2:09am)
Not a problem.
“Watson! Nice catch!” his coach shouted, and John huffed a brief smile.
“Yes.”
“That’s not a problem, Sherlock’s found a easy way to sneak out,” John replied.
And then, holding hands. Yes, John’s hand got sweaty and slightly cramped but he wasn’t going to let go until he had to. He could hear his heart pounding wildly the entire hour.
They tracked him to an abandoned house. It helped that Sherlock and John looked like frisky teenagers up to cause trouble in the middle of the night, and not potentially dangerous crime-fighters. Even though they had been running after the murderer for over five miles, he didn’t notice them.
Sherlock blinked, looking almost surprised, before getting that twinkle in his eyes and John knew that the some of the ice between them had melted.
He was exhausted, the adrenaline of his first day finally wearing off. He sent a quick email to his mom telling her that he couldn’t call her right now, but that he had a good day and would talk to her tomorrow.
“He could’ve never replaced you.”
It only took about a week before he got used to it.
“You don’t have to answer,” John said quickly. “I was just wondering, since never really talk about them.”
Right before he left, he hastily stuck a note on their door telling Sherlock to meet him here.
“I already did our report.” Sherlock said
“John,” Sherlock called suddenly.
John looked at the propped up collar framing Sherlock’s face and the flare of the Belstaff coat and smiled, his heart stuttering. Was it possible for Sherlock to get more beautiful?
Sherlock snorted, “Please, you know me better than anyone else on this planet.”
John nodded, taking a deep breath. He was sorry too.
Once John regained his breath and his heart started beating again, he turned around and smiled at Sherlock, far more calmly than he felt inside. John wouldn’t be able to pin down how he was feeling with a gun to his head.
(Sat 12:07am)
Sherlock’s eyes were piercing and his gaze never wavered as he looked at John; his face was kept carefully neutral. Several seconds later, the corner of his mouth twitched and a slow smile spread out over his face.
John looked at Sherlock with a smile on his face, Sherlock’s eyes were wide and he looked at John and then back to the door. “You,” he breathed.
“You’re not invading anything, I think we’re capable of sleeping on the same bed for three nights.”
The detective inspector smiled. “If what Greg has said about your deductions are true, Sherlock, I think we’d love to have you working here one day.”
“John, I’m sorry,” she said. “I just don’t think that there is a point in prolonging our relationship when neither of us are able to devote 100% to this.”
No. Sherlock. I meant that it’s impossible for people to not get caught in what you leave behind. I’m one of them, and even if you’re paying attention to me now, one day you won’t. JW
“So, John. Your boyfriend is looking quite gorgeous.” She winked.
He shook his head. “Can’t, I haven’t an appointment with my counselor Saturday morning.”
John raised an eyebrow. “Who is this?”
You’re a genius. I’m not close to one. JW
“Yes.”
One of the things that made Newberry remarkable and different from most high schools was that everyone in the school had at least one form of artistic talent, some physical strength and high intellectual/academic abilities.
Of course. If he had to walk into a stone arrow and then proceed to fall on his face, it would be in front of the violinist.
John marked a tally for every book or journal he finished. He was only a fourth way through their collection.
John blinked, standing up. “Sherlock, the bed is huge, and we shared a room for two years,” John said slowly, surprised that Sherlock was
Sherlock frowned. “You can’t put it off?”
John felt a small rush of euphoria as he explained. “The time of death was established to be around noon, and the body was found almost two days later. If the victim had been strangled, then the bruises should be yellowing, since it had been far longer than 18 hours.”
“You broke my heart,” Sherlock bit out. “When I kissed you you ran away from me. What choice did I have?” Sherlock clenched his fists, looking distraught and John just wanted to sweep him into his arms. “I’ve been trying to get over you,” Sherlock muttered. “you can’t say this to me now.”
John blushed and made a defensive sound. He could see everyone else at the table share a look. “For the last time, he’s not my boyfriend.”
He was picking at his cold lasagna when he realized that he could practically feel the eyes of his friends on him. John sighed and raised his head slowly.
Sherlock got up from his armchair and grabbed his backpack. He sat down to his desk and turned on the study light.
“But our whole project was supposed to be about this case.”
“In the beginning, when we first talked about your future, you said that you wanted to become a doctor and go to Cambridge? You had so much potential. The professor who interviewed you said that you seemed to be one of the most brilliant students she’s ever talked with.”
After the sun rises, I mean. JW
John’s smile grew. “You’re welcome.”
John blushed slightly. “Yes. Absolutely amazing. I can’t imagine someone able to do all that with just news broadcasts and internet articles.”
‘It’s fine,” John replied, feeling awkward again. The way Greg was looking at Molly even as he’s speaking to John. John wondered if he ever looked at Mary that way? He didn’t think so.
(Sat 3:11am)
John nodded, expecting this.
He cut John off. “I knew you had a vast knowledge of medicine, but I needed to test your ability in real life situations. So this was a small test.” Sherlock grinned. “Congratulations, John. You passed.”
Wait. That meant he’d be sharing a bed with Sherlock. That was somehow his greatest nightmare and dream in one. John nodded, and Mr. Verdue seemed relieved that he wasn’t about to have a fit, and after handing the two room keys to John, he walked away to another student.
Hell, might as well just admit that it was the threat and promise of danger that thrilled him.
Sherlock stayed silent. After several more minutes of John staying nonchalant and the other boy glaring a hole into the back of his head, Sherlock got up and padded to the coffee maker.
“The route you were taking and when you fell I saw the room number scribbled on your hand.”
Wincing, John scrambled up back onto the bed. He glared at Sherlock and rubbed his arm.
(Sat 2:01am)
A few minutes later, his mom’s car appeared. He stood up and wished Irene a great summer.
John sighed in relief when he heard a knock at the door. “Yeah Greg,” John shouted, “It’s unlocked.”
(Sat 2:58am)
a) Matching paint samples
They were racing down an alley, and John’s heart was pounding in his chest. With each thud of his feet slamming against the dirty pavement, he felt that he was soaring higher and higher. He turned towards Sherlock, who was sprinting next to him, and grinned so wide he thought it might split his face.
“Because all you do is spend time with him!” John knew that some of this anger was irrational, but he couldn’t stop it now that they were arguing.
“It’s all just transport.”
“Of course I deduced you were planning a surprise. ”
“No,” John said, “that was not my fault. You stopped coming back to the dorms, you started hanging out with Victor all the time,” John pointed an accusatory finger, “and left me. “
(Sat 12:19am)
He passed midterms with his highest marks yet, and only felt a vague, hollow satisfaction, and when his glinting eyed counselor congratulated him on leaving Holmes and focusing on his studies, John only nodded as the weight at the bottom of his stomach grew heavier.
She nodded. “That’s correct.”
Sherlock grinned. “Usually. The one I chose for our project was a bit more difficult. I wasn’t planning on having to use the archives for it, but you saw how useless those news articles were.” He shrugged and went back to skimming the report.
Sherlock’s eyes narrowed. “Mycroft,” he hissed. “That interfering ass.”
“Some maximum-security jewelry store. Really, even I thought it was impressive that someone pulled that off.”
Sherlock blinked at him. “It tastes different to me.”
“Don’t be ridiculous, you see me everyday,” Sherlock replied.
He didn’t hear a response from Sherlock, and John turned around, expecting Sherlock to be tapping away on his phone, already distracted. Instead he found Sherlock barely a foot away from him, staring at John intensely.
“Thanks.” Sherlock looked away. John couldn’t tell if his cheeks were still pink from the cold or from the compliment.
A woman John assumed is the headmaster stepped onto the stage. She grabbed the microphone. “We hope that you all had a good first day here at Newberry Academy. If you need help getting adjusted, please just stop by my office or your counselor. We are here from five to nine.”
c) Latent fingerprinting
John blinked. A moment ago Sherlock seemed on the verge of a mini-melt down, and now he was perfectly fine. “What?”
“Alright,” Sherlock conceded. “But only if you kiss me again.”
“O-okay then,” John said hesitantly. “Do you still need my help with that experiment?”
“Thank you, for all this,” Sherlock said quietly, and John saw something desperately unspoken in his eyes, but John was far too scared, far too uncertain of everything, so he let it go with a tentative smile and a nod.
When he first met her, it shocked John that Irene was so well acquainted with sex and whatnot.
It made his skin crawl.
After dinner on that Friday night, John grabbed the medical journal he’d been meaning to start,
“Sherlock, I swear, I am going to be falling asleep on your shoulder in science tomorrow.”
But I don’t understand how I’m an addiction to dangerous people. I’m rather ordinary. JW
“Because, “ John said, stuttering.
Then a familiar voice rumbled behind him, “Looks like we’ll be spending a lot of time together, John Watson.”
Sometimes, it would be easy to forget about him. Easy to get distracted by school, or Mary. Easy to pretend that everything was normal and that the extraordinary, dark-haired boy who didn’t smile at him in the halls anymore wasn’t his best friend. Other times, it wasn’t so easy.
Mary frowned, pulling away from John. “I can’t believe you don’t want to sleep with me. Aren’t you supposed to be my boyfriend?” Mary said, narrowing her eyes at John.
John plopped down on the cushion and rubbed his eyes. The adrenaline of the chase was finally wearing off and fatigue was setting in.
He looked down and saw a blocked number. John’s curiosity grew.
“Good afternoon John.” He said, and smiled, all teeth.
(Fri 10:18pm)
Michaela. You got the first letter right at least.
“Not at all.” John managed a smile. Mary looked... nice She had a short flowy skirt on with flat sandals, and she was twirling her hair in her fingers. “What are you doing here?” John asked, sitting up and shutting his laptop.
“We’ll go into further detail regarding the human hand. Can you tell me about the nerves of the hand?”
Sherlock paused and studied John for a moment longer. “Something’s on your mind,” he said.
John sighed, he just wanted to stay in and catch up on some homework. Sherlock’s cases had been driving him around the bend; he hardly had any downtime now. John got dressed in a hurry, and just as he was about to leave, his phone rang.
