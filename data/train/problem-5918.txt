had put the glasses on the highest shelf, so high that even Thor and Steve couldn't reach it. And it could've only been one certain tweety bird that did this shit,
Now, despite what you may think, Clint had worked out quite a bit and could acually lift Tony with very little difficuly, it may also have a bit to do with Tony not eating enough and losing a few pounds here and there, but he still maintained a healthy weight, just on the lighter side. If Steve or Pepper or any of the team really got to know that he was underweight then he would get forcefed three times a day no joke.
When the bike came to a stop, Tony looked around and found himself in the outskirts of Brooklyn, a three-story apartment building that his now  dead butler Jarvis probably could've lived in when he was young standing in front of him. But even though it had that 40s vibe to it it had to have been renovated a couple of times, because yeah sure it was old. But if it hadn't been renovated then it would've been a rotten pile of wood by now.
Now, you're probably thinking something along the lines of them sort off climbing up onto the counter and then from there getting the glasses, but no, my dear friend. That is not what Clint is thinking, because he's gonna make sure that Steve gets just as jealous as possible. And that is why, when he got to where Tony was standing, said:
As Clint turned the corner he came to an abrupt stop, as there was a wall of about 10 very darkly clad guards, all 6'0 or over, and clearly not on the good side. He slowly backed up until his back hit the wall. He dropped Tony onto the cold stone floor and put his pole inbetween him and them. After a few seconds of nothing, one of the guards moved forward and Clint quickly moved into action.
"ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME?" Steve exclaimed, and started to run towards the exit, or what Clint guessed was the exit atleast, Natasha took ahold of her little ear-comm and started explaining to Bruce what happened and told him to have an arc-reactor ready in tops 10 minutes, all the while trying to not make him Hulk out.
The photographer had of course heard that two of the Avengers were kidnapped and took a quick picture to make the headlines.
"He hooked up his arc reactor to a homemade bomb, got waterboarded before that, and is gonna have a heart attack in about 15 minutes if we dont switch it out." Clint explained, as camly as he could. Which wasn't calm at all as it was Clint.
Meanwhile Tony had come back to earth again and tried to set his leg all on his own, which didnt work out too well because his hands were shaking too bad.
And with that thought, he forced himself to get back into the real world. Where Sam, Thor and Tony stood arguing about pizza toppings. The aids-joke log forgotten.
Once Clint had made sure that Tony wasn't going to fall asleep standing in the elevator, he raced off to Natasha's floor for some one on one conversation. No, not that kind, he actually had something important to say to Natasha. Once he got of the elevator, he went and knocked on Natasha's bedroom door. Maybe she was sitting in there reading or something.
"That is fucking priceless, but who’s kissing who? Well i guess I kiss everybody so it have to be Clint." Tony said inbetween his fits of laughter.
He had broken up with Ty just a couple of hours before, well, maybe Tiberius had pushed it the last bit, but Tony was still the one into initiate it. After he had once again given Tony a new gallery of bruises he decided enough was enough and he cut it off. Sure he was still a bit insecure about his decision, i mean, Ty really did want the best for him, and if he had to give Tony a few love taps to remind him to stay in his place, then he guessed it was Ty meaning well.
Natasha almost flipped past it, but after reading the title sat up straight, and read the title again very closely.
“So how do we actually do this? Like are you or me going first?” Clint exclaimed, a  bit confused and awkward.
Tony and Clint were once again rolling on the floor laughing, tough this time it was about Bruce and Steve.
Tony then looked to his right and found a very red Steve looking back at him, Tony met his gaze and Steve immediately looked away, and instead of a pig-ish pink, his skin now turned into a vibrant tomato-red. Tony looked down a bit, and saw that the cutlery had been bent, by none other than the residential super solider himself. Like, a fork had been bent in the midle and was almost 90 degrees and not in a good way. Well fuck, how were they gonna eat now?
The avengers, were very busy people. Well, that's not as true as you might think. But they still saved the city once in a while. And had hour long press conferences that were sooooo boring (read: Clint, Sam, Thor, anybody who's ever been to a press conference). But regardless, they were still pretty busy people.
a sea of fried chicken. Bruce decided that a french fry would be the death of him, sadly he was unable to do so as Thor had given him the Heimlic manover and he had magically survived.
Naaah, Clint thought as he stood up to finally get to leave and do something fun, maybe force the team to have a movie night? Yeah, he would do that. Steve could coax Tony to come out of his workshop. Hell, the man could probably get Tony to get on his knees and beg for all he knew.
"Well, you've gotta lift me then, I guess, remind me to make every counter hulk proof as well JARVIS." Tony sighted, finally realising his fate.
Tony pulls his butt as far away from Ty's groin, and then smashes it back with as much power as possible, making Ty loose his hold on Tony for a bit and Tony seeing an opening to escape. He yanks his arms free of Ty and then storms towards the exit, the only one he gets to is an emergency exit, but it'll have to do for now, all he want is to get away from Tiberius.
"Bruce, this is Natasha, we are on our way up, but a big rock is in our way. Also, would you mind telling us if our teammate is alive or not?"
on them." Tony shot right back, tough it wasn't as snarky and sarcastic as it usually was. Well that's worrying.
"Come in, unless you're Clint, then please fuck off and go away." A voice answered, that clearly belonged to one redheaded assassin.
It went to shit for the bad side really quick, once Natasha and Thor was by Steve’s side, and now making the guards drop like pins in a matter of minutes. Steve went over to the wall where Tony was slumped, and tried to shake him awake, but to no avail.
"Hey Tony, it's not nice to run away from your boyfriend." A sickly sweet voice whispered into his ear. And oh how he knew who that voice belonged to, and oh how he hated this and wanted to be anywhere but here. Even professor Coulson's history lessons were a better option.
"What? Clint that counter is so strong that the Hulk could do the macarena on it and it wouldnt budge. JARVIS, please help me here."
Another 2 minutes went by and Bruce went back to sipping his water, standing ready with the new arc-reactor, a hospital bed with a IV-needle in his other hand. Suddenly the door is slammed open and Steve comes running into the room, dumping Tony on the bed and looking expectanly at Bruce. Bruce chockes on his water but ignores that in favor of ripping Tonys shirt open. Forcing the Hulk down with the motivation that the captors are already dead and Tony needs Bruce more than Hulk. He immediately gags when he sees the state of the arc-reactor.
On a completely different note Steve had broken the syringe he was holding and had to get up and get another one.
"Clint, truth or dare then?" Natasha asked, with a small tick of her finger that only a spy who had worked with her for over 10 years would pick up.
"Reactor... hea-artattack th- thirtyyy miiiiinnnn." He also got out, convinetely telling Clint that he was eccentialy going to die if he didn't change out his reactor in 30 minutes or less.
"What? I just don't like fried chicken? It’s not like it’s the end of the world." Steve said. Quite carelessly and not really getting the seriousness of the whole situation. Meanwhile Tony and Clint now had Sam to back them up.
Well, a good reason not to sleep was to spy for paparazzis, which he didn't. So it wasn't that odd when a lucky one got a picture of the iron man suit coming out of the entrance, carrying a sleeping Clint bridal style and taking of towards the tower.
Tony climbed onto the motorcycle and curled his arms around Steve's waist after a second of hesitation, once he was all comfortable, he rested his cheek against Steve's back and just rode along, wishing that the butterflies in his stomach could shut the fuck up.
When he got thrown into the cell that Clint was sitting in, Clint was imediately up on his feet to try and supress the fall as good as he was able to. A bloody, wet and messy excuse of a human was thrown into his arms. (They decided that Tony would get a chance to revisit his old friend waterboarding, Tony was not very pleased with that decision.)
"Okay, okay, jesus stop being so fucking pissy about it." Clint answered back with a joking tone. Winking at Natasha, huh, she had had a hand in this as well then. Before moving towards Tony and holding his hands out.
"Well that's not a nice way to talk to your beloved isn't it?" Ty continued, now wrapping his arms tighter around Tony's waist and pushing his groin forward until it was plastered to tony's backside, making Tony feel like he was getting trapped in.
"Yes, but don't worry it won’t do anything except break the door open, so you just pick up whatever weapon you can find and park your pretty little ass and tiny dick in the corner, while i do all the work." Tony proposed, though it wasn't really a suggestion and really more of an order. But Clint grabbed a metal pole and sat himself in the corner none the less.
“Well I have pants, shirts and a pair of shoes.” Steve listed off while glancing at the jeans section and looking awfully shifty. “I guess I could get some other pants?”
"How can you even forget having superstrength, that doesn't make any sense?" Tony said, all the while walking Steve towards the sink and slowly washing his bleeding hand.
"A full night's sleep is eight hours Tony," Steve answered back, "You need to eat, drink something other than coffee, and then go to sleep."
"WHAT THE FUCK? NO! THERE'S NO WAY I'M STICKING MY TOUNGE DOWN TONY'S THROAT JUST SO STEVE CAN PUNCH ME FOR TAKING HIS 'BOYFRIEND'!"
They had arrived in separate cars, just incase one of the car drivers actually were a spy. At least Tony and hopefully everyone else could alert SHIELD and Fury about the situation. Because Tony would not be driven by anyone else except for Happy. But if there were any spies, they didn't reveal themselves just yet. And the ride to the mall went surprisingly smooth.
Of course she remembers the joke, but it was just a joke. Well it didn't matter now because the internet obviously hadn't forgotten about it, and  it was blackmail material for both Clint and Tony, and she didn’t back down to that.
After their dinner was eaten and nobody had died of chocking, embarrassment or just plain fighting, the team (everybody except Tony, Steve and Bruce) decided that a game of truth or dare would be an great idea. And that found the whole team sitting in the living room of the communal floor, with snacks and drinks to freely take from, about to start acting like a bunch of teenagers. And thinking of the IQ compared to humor level of some of the members, it wasn't that hard to say that the average mental age of the room was about 16.
Once Tony signalized that he wanted to go down, Clint just stood there for a awkward while... before Tony wiggled his ass a bit and then Clint finally got a grip and started moving his hands around to try and catch Tony when he sort of fell down.
“Why me?!” Tony exclaimed, even though he had already pushed Clint off of him and was starting to stand up.
"Oh really, damn you really sunk to a new low, plus it’s not very nice to beat up people who just got waterboarded." Tony teased back, now a little more forced as he was trying to stand while having a very-likely broken foot. Clint sat him down again and started setting his leg, saying when it was gonna hurt and after when he wasn't gonna do anything.
"Ok, ok, wait it's already six thirty? JARVIS save the blueprints that I made, and the notes as well." Tony answered as he took Steve's hand and Steve pulled him up.
Steve leaned closer to Tonys heart and whispered "Do you want to go to sleep?", Tony nodded in answer and Steve sat up and started to get up as if he was leaving. Tony couldn't help the small whine that came out of his throat, nor the embarrassment and realization that of course Steve wouldn't want to
Natasha gave a quick ok back and after 2 mintues they heard a big thud as the rock was lifted to the side, they heard Bruce’s voice in the speakers of the iron man suit, and as it decended onto the ground from the stairs Bruce started explaining.
"Huh, somebody got a bit embarassed, well let's not wait for him because it was only like 4 forks and we can eat with a spoon, right? Tony turned the question to the team, who just mutedly nodded and all sat down. Still in a bit of a shock that Tony didn't have a damn clue about what Steve
"is it ok if I take him back to ours buck? I mean I really don't want him to be alone and fuck knows who's gonna be there."
Bruce promptly choked on his water, and the scandalised look on Steve’s face was the funniest thing that Clint had ever seen. But there was something else in there.
Yeah, this night was going to be a good one. Tony thought as he looked up from the floor and around the dance floor. A bit of a way had been parted and he could see out of the sea of people, his eyes trailed along the walls and stopped at a group of people sitting on chairs and armchairs and stools. They seemed to be about his age, maybe a bit older. A redhead sat beside a guy with what looked like a prosthetic and dark, long, hair. Another dark-haired guy sat opposite them, this one not as intimidating and was clearly the clown of the group, on his right a guy who had long blonde hair and
After he was done he got up and took the keys and started to open each lock, one by one, until there was only about 10 locks left, but no matter how many keys he tried none of them opened the last ones. Sadly he got back to Tony, who had started playing around with the scraps of metal and wires.
"5, 4, 3, 2, o-" Tonys speech was cut off with a loud bang and smoke bolming into the air, Clint jumped forard and quickly twisted the red thread out and away from the arc reactor. All the while coughing as dark grey smoke filled the small cell. Clint dropped down to the floor and crawled over to Tony, who was also coughing for his life, but his coughing was more erratict and deep.
"Uuuhh, it's friday right? And yeah I slept.." Tony said, confused as he tired to figure out what day it was. The dork.
"Wait Sam was in on this too! Why is it always me that gets the bad shit." Clint said, but with such a defeated voice that they all knew that the trade was accepted.
Now, you may think that they could just get another set out, but the night before they had eaten takeout and therefor most of the forks were in the dishwasher. And after a unfortunate accident with the Hulk the comunalfloors kitchen now had half of the cutlery than it had before.
Clint made a suprised noice and slowly sat him down on the floor as the guard closed the door with a bang. While Clint took off Tony’s way to expensive Armani suitjacket to use as a temporary bandage to try and cool down his cut on his leg, Tony was trying to say someting.
It all started out on a Saturday afternoon, a lazy afternoon, that was. The sun was just about to go down, when Natasha stood up, finally done with her training of the day.
As usual, because some thing just doesn't change, kudos and comments are appreciated and listens too if you have a suggestion of either a other story or the last bit in this one!
Apparently that wasn't enough for the public, because they were now speculating on whether everything really was as safe as they once thought.
"Hmm, what about something dirty? Why don't you give Tony a lap dance?" Natasha said whilst twirling her hair around her finger in a absolutely non malicious way.
The club was in full swing when Tony finally got away from the bouncers. Yeah he was The Tony Stark, but that apparently didn't matter to the grumpy-as-fuck bouncers as he had to stand in line for 30 fucking minutes before he got in. Screw them, he thought as he went directly up to the bar and ordered two shots, and downed them both in two swigs once the were presented in front of him.
Tony opened his eyes, nodded and made grabby hands at Steve, very childishly but he was too tired to notice or care. Steve took off his shoes and then very gingerly started laying down, pausing to ask if it was ok. Tony said yes. Once Steve was completely plastered against Tony's back, Tony took Steve's arm that laid loose and wrapped it around his waist. A silent reminder that it was ok. Steve started to draw small circles into Tony's side.
When they entered the kitchen, the rest of the team was already there. Bruce was standing at the stove, stirring something that smelled of curry. Beside him Thor was chopping up all kinds of veggies; peppers, cucumbers, tomatoes and carrots. Natasha was handing Sam plates, who handed Clint the plates, who then placed them on the big dining table. It was all a big mess, but one really team-y and famil-y mess.
"30, 29, 2- oh also bird brain you have to pull this cable off of my arc reactor or otherwise i'll die, 100%. So as soon as this blows, untwist it and then you can leave me." Tony said, a bit out if breath but nothing major.
As she took her water bottle, sweat towel and yoga mat. She thought of how the team hadn't had a team night in a while. With Thor being away to Asgard to look after his brother, Tony hiding in his workshop with his next (or 50) newest project, and Bruce who had flown to India for a week doing god knows what. They all needed some downtime, and a fun team bonding night would be perfect for that. Seeing as the city were, at the moment, not being attacked by anything. Why not have one tonight?
"I'm sorry sir, but that is one of the none-hulk-dancing-proof counters." JARVIS' smooth voice filled the room. And if a AI could have emotions, JARVIS' voice would be filled with misschief and a tiny bit of fake apology. Clint smiled at that, becuase he had danced ontop of that same counter with Natahsa and it hadn't budged even a tiny bit. Thank god for JARVIS' teamwork.
The clerks came around and were of course delighted to have the Avengers in their shop. One of the clerks didn’t seem particularly happy though, while he sure did try to seem cheery and helpful, they all knew that he wasn’t their biggest fan.
"So I'm sort of controlling the suit if shit hits the fan but JARVIS will be the one to take one of you home, Clint, hop onboard, Thor, take Natasha with you and follow the suit."
So now the team had to reassure the city of New York that no, the giant acid-spitting snails weren’t coming back. And yes, everyone was safe, and would continue on being safe thanks to the Avengers. And how do you do that, you may ask?
"Sir, if I may interrupt. Yes it's Friday, and you have not slept in 38 hours if you don't count the 2 hour nap you took this afternoon.
impressive biceps was sat, taking up two seats instead of just one. Tony looked at him for a moment, then realized that it was Bruce's boyfriend, and quickly looked away.
Plus for the last chapter before Steve and Tony gets their heads out of their asses needs to be something special, so give me some requests or recommendations in the comments!
"But i do belive we can make it out, if i have any luck with this." He finally said, whilst holding up a small device, with one end of a red cable still hang out of it.
Once on the right floor, top floor might i add, Steve stopped and started digging around his pockets looking for the key. When he didn't find anything he simply leaned against the door and waited, never letting Tony down from his position against Steve's chest.
The guard did nothing except to force him down onto a metal chair and strap him to it with very easily breakable straps.
Well, except for Tony that is. He was forced out of his workshop by Steve. And showed up just as dinner was ready at 7.30. But his hair was still wet from showering (Steve had exclaimed that it smelled like a mix of motor oil and old smoothies, which, let's be real, wasn't that far from the truth than Steve wanted to believe.) and had a fresh pair of clothes on. So they counted the 30 minute delay worth it.
Thankfully, Tony had more than one kitchen in the tower, and therefore more than enough cutlery to use and serve the whole R&D department, nonetheless, there was cutlery to be found in more than one place. Steve also realised that and and jerked around and walked towards the doors that led to one of many, elevators.
7 heads turned towards Natasha, and all of them a bit confused until they read what was plastered on the pice of paper.
"It’s all fixed, and i'm pretty sure there's no mic on this thing, said some pretty nasty stuff sooo shouldn't be a problem."
There seemed to had been a change in personal based on the fact that almost all of the clerks now was giving them very obvious death stares but still staying away from them. Tony had just found the right size and was standing on his toes to get it down from the hanger, while Clint was on the side laughing his ass of and providing
The day after everyone were gathered in Tony's room in the medic-area in the tower and when the avengers got to see the very untrue and slightly romantic headline:
Once again, sorry for not posting as much as id like to be. But school has been eating me up and with match-season in full swing with my floor ball and swimming i just haven't gotten that much time. Also i made this chapter way to big for just a casual thing. But its hard when you want to write and more and more but can't because you still have 3 chapters to go. Anyway lets just stop with the whining.
Weather you liked it or not, if you were in the tower on a Friday night, you were going to play truth or dare. It was a sacred rule that stood without exceptions. (Except that one time when Clint had gotten into a coma and therefor was unable to participate, but still.)
“Wow, thank you for the compliment.” Clint grumbled as he now had gotten the underlying meaning behind the statement.
So when Tony went up for air after a 32 hour binge in the workshop, Clint jumped him as fast as possible, reminding him of the date and what it meant. Tony had of course no clue what day it was (He thought it was Thursday), but happily obliged once enlightened with the day. It was still only 10 o clock in the morning so Tony had a chance to shower, eat and sleep before the time rolled around. Steve would not let Tony drink any coffee unless he was going to a meeting off somewhere important, or if he had slept at least 6 hours.
The first sound she heard when she opened the doors, were the swish of an arrow slicing through the air and lading on a mark with a small thud.
A bus full of school kids from the Midtown school of science had almost been melted and completely destroyed after Hulk had thrown one of the snails. The busload of kids had been going to Oscorp for a field trip, and their teacher had missed the restrictions and sadly driven a bit too far into the war zone. They were all fine now, a bit shaken, non the less. But still, fine.
"Every lock is opened except for 10 that i couldn't get open, you sure you can’t just call the suit and get us out of here?" He asked stated.
"I haven't slept in about 40 hours so you better let me get cached up before you throw all the crazy dares at me" Tony said as he sat down and immediately grabbed a handful of chips, and his cup of coffee since there was no way in hell he was sleeping through whatever was going down today, he did not care about Steve's kicked puppy eyes. (At least he pretended not to)
"Oh no, i killed her." The smug fucker replied, while slowly standing up. Walking around the walls trying to find any clue as to where he is, what the fuck is happening and how they would get out.
"Yes you will, now shut up and get into his arms, JARVIS will take over from here, get straight to medical ok?" Bruce hung up with a small click and Clint had no other choice than to accept the arm around his back and jump up with both of his feet to meet the iron man suits other arms. JARVIS hooked the arm in the hollow of clint knee and he was off.
"If you wanted to get your hands on my ass all you had to do was ask" Tony play-flirted, making it very obvious that it was a joke, Clint laughed as he let Tony down and let go of his ass.
"Yeah, I do believe that." Tony answerers, trying to put on his Fuck-You-Im-Tony-Stark face and badly failing.
"I’m just gonna drag you out into the hallway and the we could try to get you to stand ok?" Clint said, whilst slowly standing up on his feet and bending down to take Tony under his shoulders, slowly dragging him towards the now exploded door.
"WHAT. THE. FUCK?" Clint started, all the while moving swiftly through the corridoors, occasionally stopping to bang his metal pole against someones skull, as one does.
But Ty sadly has the upper hand and starts to unbuckle his own belt, once he's done he bends down a bit and starts to unbuckle Tony's too. He's about to drag the belt through the little loops in Tonys jeans when they hear footsteps running towards them at rapid speed, suddenly Ty is being pulled back from Tony and pushed up against the brick wall behind him.
A very un-organized kidnapping while the Avengers were out on a spontaneous shopping trip makes their lives all the more entertaining, and, a hell of a lot more worrying.
The reporters had soon gotten over the whole almost-melting-a-bus scenario thanks to Tony’s quick wit and just over all charm. And were now just asking question in general about the Avengers tower and the team and how Steve was adapting to the 21-st century. (That he had answered so awkwardly that the reporter had politely cut him off halfway and Clint, Tony and Thor had died of laughter.)
"Clint, come on, think about it for a while, it's still at least five hours until dinner, and then a little while after before we actually start to play, just tell me what you decide then." Natasha answered, conveniently sharpening her nails with her new knife.
"Why c-can’t we - oh my god your expression Steve - both just do it?" Clint forced out meanwhile was dying of laughter as well.
"Hey, are you ok, he didn't get to do anything did he?"  He said whilst slowly moving towards Tony, he seemed shy, almost. Which was a whole other level of ironic.
"Yeah, yeah of course. I think everyone is just gonna crash at ours tonight, just to make sure everything goes smoothly." The guy with the dark, long hair stepped forward. He was also very tall and built, but didn't have the same innocence that the one currently helping Tony did.
After that—thankfully—the ice seemed to have broken just a little. Tony didn’t sport that haunted look anymore whenever they would ask to stop anywhere. Together, they visited ‘Hershey’s Chocolate World’ (beginning with the tour of the Chocolate Factory—which turned out to be something like a small Disney World tour) and stopped to see America’s largest avocado.
For several yards, there was nothing but a long, winding corridor that felt more like a secret passage in a castle than anything modern. The room that followed was full of old-fashioned computers. Everything had a thick overlay of dust and the tech looked, for all the world, like it hadn’t been in use in decades.
“Hey,” he replied, reaching for the wrist that held the washcloth to his brow and rubbed circles into his skin there. “What happened?”
The next thing he knew, Ultron had gripped him by the throat, pulling him a good few meters off the ground. There was something close to smugness flashing across his face, and he opened his mouth to say something, before he froze.
“I don’t remember you brooding so much,” someone said behind Bucky, and when he turned around, he saw Tony leaning against the wall a few meters away.
“I’m being realistic. Thanos is at our doorsteps, Tony. Millions of people are dying as we speak—and you know it.”
Tony chuckled, but his expression turned serious once more only moments later. “Steve, I… I would do anything in my power to meet you, but I can’t.”
“Yes, he’s ours,” Steve agreed. Phil looked intrigued, and a bit disbelieving, so Steve figured he’d either gotten word of how Ian had come to this world, or he’d put two and two together. In any case, Steve didn’t mind—he would never, not once, be ashamed of their son.
"When I said I would join your team," Thor said from his position, hovering over the mouth of the creature, "I had imagined we would be fighting your Hydra, and searching for my brother's scepter..."
"And they say I'm the boy scout," Steve said, keeping his tone dry, even as his eyes twinkled with humor and desire he didn't even bother hiding. He thought of the best location to do this, and ruled out his own room right off the bat. His room would require going through the common room where a debriefing was taking place. He couldn't think of a single excuse to not stick around once they got there, and he knew sitting around thinking about Tony's naked body and all the things he wanted to do to him would just be counterproductive.
Steve rubbed a hand over his neck—a gesture Tony had often seen Steve do. Which was strangely comforting. “To be honest, this is not the first time something like this has happened to one of our team and… I guess it means that your Steve probably is in 2022 where I should be.”
He felt like laughing then, and a little bit like crying, too, but the only sound leaving his mouth was a dry huff.
Steve let loose a long and exasperated sigh. Tony frowned at him, realizing that Steve was pulling off his jacket and shirt.
"I am aware of that, Thor, but this threat is here now. Do you see anything from up there?" Steve asked, hoping to deter the demi-god's displeasure with the situation. None of them was too happy with it as it was.
“He is right about this,” Thor added, smiling at him reassuringly and clapping a hand on Steve’s shoulder, before he walked closer to the cradle.
“Fine,” Steve said, completely cheery, while he grinned at Tony. He pushed past him and grabbed a bag of Doritos off of the display. “Dinner’s ready in a few minutes. Be right back.” And without another word, he disappeared around the corner, leaving Tony alone.
It was something Steve had come to depend on—the promise of Tony’s presence. Because no matter how confused these nights together had him, there was solace in them as well.
“Yeah,” he breathed, barely hearing himself over the rush of blood in his head. He gasped at the first touch of Steve’s finger, then closed his eyes when he slowly pushed the digit inside. The following minutes were a steady flow of moans and grunts, of erratic movements of his hips, and fingers that were clawing at the sheets beneath him.
There was nothing to say. Tony was overpowered. Something inside him splintered and his heart was hammering, as every string that had once been tied to Extremis screamed in protest.
Steve walked a few more steps before he realized he’d walked towards the west wing the whole time. Right into Indries’ room.
Tony was right. Maybe he just needed to let himself had this. He might be confused, but he still knew what he wanted. And this was a stolen hour. A few blissful moments before the frightening reality of this new part of their lives set in.
It had been almost three months before Tony had called him for the first time. Three months of brooding in the stillness of T’Challas home. Listening to the silence emanating from Bucky’s cryo-chamber. He had just been waiting, he knew that now. Sitting in his chair, waiting for Tony to finally call and give him a good talking to.
that Steve hadn’t been wholly unaffected by Tony’s advances, but this—this was making things pretty clear, wasn’t it?
Bucky snorted, his expression wonderfully carefree. “Didn’t you say that was what Thor’s mead is for?”
ring a bell, and Steve frowned. "Died in a car accident last winter," he said, contemplative. "That was him? I didn’t know that." Another thought occurred to him then. "Shouldn't he be super rich, though? What's he doing still in school?" It was a silly question. Tony wasn't even a legal adult. He probably wouldn't be able to control any of his money anyway.
It was a shame they weren't in the same team anymore, he mused absently. If they had been co-leading, he'd be able to see Tony every day.
“No,” Tony admitted. “Certainly not. But then I didn’t know how… life-changing… camping with you could be.” He huffed, at himself maybe, or at the whole metaphor. “Also, you know… we recently fought a warlord from outer space, we met a speaking tree, and a raccoon with an even bigger mouth than me. You’re…
to accept your offers, to flirt back like everything was okay, but it wasn’t all that easy for me. I tried keeping it professional but didn't
“Good,” Stark replied with an uncharacteristically gentle tone. He seemed to cross the hallway, the soft sounds of shoes hitting the marble floor echoed through the vast space. While he could still hear them breathing, they were otherwise completely quiet.
Steve rolled his eyes. “You’re ridiculous,” he said, but it didn’t stop him from letting a hand slide between Tony’s thighs, grabbing his boxers and pulling them just over his ass. His hips nestled behind him. He shifted, one leg curling over Tony’s thighs, and after taking the lube in his hands he pushed a finger into him, pumping steadily. “Gonna do this slow,” he whispered into Tony’s ear, “take you hard.”
Tony smiled, and for the first time since their very first meeting, it looked friendly. “You’re so different than my dreams of you before,” he whispered reverently.
Steve nodded, drawing him nearer, rousing a pitiful whine out of Tony. He chuckled, brushed his nose against Tony’s. “You alright?”
Tony sighed, tilting his head back. “No,” he said. “And he doesn’t need to. No reason to put this on him, too. Barnes… it’s eating him up. Barnes won’t talk to him, or acknowledge him. It’s… I just need to give Barnes the chance to get his head out of his ass. For Steve’s sake.”
Leaning in, and pressing his whole self against Steve, and accepted what had happened if it meant they could start anew.
was. And the idea that this kind, brave man he’d called his partner for the last couple of years would hate him from here on out… it left Tony thoroughly gutted.
Tony grabbed for one of the tablets, opening the project so he could track the changes Bruce was making. “Didn’t know you made any new friends, Brucie. Thought we were the Solitude-Brothers.”
He could finally see the details of the suit left behind, and when he moved to enwrap Tony in a hug once more, he rested his forehead against the Tony's shoulder. "Better?"
… going in the future. Your future version never confirmed it, but you couldn’t be subtle if your life depended on it. So what is it, you’re together? Or is it just sex?”
came to mind, but Steve swallowed it down because he wasn’t ready yet to deal with these kinds of things.
“No,” Tony called back, his voice clipped. “But a warning that we were going to be stuck in a goddamn forest for over a month would’ve been nice. Wearing a tight overall out here is definitely
"Maybe you talk too much," he said, lifting his other hand to rest on Tony's cheek and leaning in to kiss him.
…Tony just sat there, still frozen in the forward-leaning stance, staring at the empty ground in utter defeat.
Tony pulled back somewhat, forcing Steve to look into his eyes. “Okay, I get it. You want sex, which I’m completely on board with, just… you’re obviously distressed and I feel like I should be worrying about that first. Maybe you need to—”
Adding more lube, now onto his condom-clad dick, Steve sat up, adjusted their position and pulled Tony onto his lap. He angled their bodies just right and started pressing in, eyes flicking between Tony's face and where their bodies slowly connected.
A small voice in Steve’s mind, the part of him that still felt far too small for a body this big, was inclined to agree.
He nodded in place of words, tucking himself back into his boxers before he could grow hard again. With their scents lingering together, it was difficult not to imagine what it could be like. Every day like this. Hours in unending ecstasy.
“Seems they want to make federal employees out of you,” Fury talked right over him, his tone neutral. “How’s that feeling?”
There wasn’t exactly much Bucky could say to that. Of course, he did. As much as he had hated the thing once, after Bruce and Tony had freed him of the implants in his head—as much as he couldn’t forget what that arm had done and how much grief it had caused, he also felt lost without it. Incomplete. So he released another sigh, then followed Tony through the corridors and into an elevator.
Soon after dinner, Laura presented her plan for sleeping arrangements. Honestly, Steve was just very grateful that she was housing ten guests at once, and when she’d asked if she could double up Steve and Tony, neither of them had disagreed. Everyone left the living room soon after, and since Fury was taking the couch, Steve had sat down at the kitchen table, staring down onto his left hand, where his wedding ring glistened in the dim light.
Tony was barely touching him, so Steve thrust his hips forward a little in hope of luring his hand lower. He needed him to touch him
Tony laughed at the mischievousness in Steve’s gaze. The man was such a dork. “Do you now,” he said, weaving a hand through Steve’s hair. “Might need a demonstration.”
There was a long pause. Eventually, Tony took a long breath. “I said we’re going,” he ground out. “Rhodey?”
In one fluid movement, Steve was standing upright and Tony was in his arms, his temple resting against Tony’s head as they moved to the music. He closed his eyes and breathed him in. He smelled so good and in that moment, Steve could almost believe that there really was a bubble around them, and nothing outside of it mattered.
make things difficult… sometimes. We won’t be able to make this public for a while. And we may not always be after the same things." He paused, searching Tony's eyes. "I'm just making sure you know what you’re getting yourself into. It might get messy."
“Yeah? I’d like to say I will beat the ever living hell out of you if you try, but…” He laughed, a soft sound as he lifted his fractured arm. “We both know I can’t.”
was difficult enough, but planning a war, forming a new team, discussing tactics—it really took every ounce of concentration.
Natasha leaned over him, too, Clint and Thor behind her. “Is he going to make it?” Thor asked softly.
And then he advanced again, eyes cautious but resolute. Like he had made the decision to do something potentially unpleasant, and was now determined to see it through. Steve drew in a surprised breath and then, his body was suddenly crushed against an armful of Bucky.
Steve ran across the path leading towards the bay. The sky was still illuminated by thunder, and the ocean looked almost angry as it whipped against the cliffs. And no matter how fast Steve ran, the bay seemed a thousand miles away.
And true enough, there had been no remembrance in Tony’s voice. Maybe it wasn’t Tony after all, and his mind was just playing tricks on him?
“Ah,” Jarvis said and Steve startled a little when the butler pressed a warm hand on his left shoulder. “I think you’re underestimating yourself. All my pleas went unheard, but you must’ve found a way to stop his endless brooding. Thank you.”
“You can touch them, you know,” Tony whispered against Steve’s lips, his fingers digging into Steve’s shoulders. “The scars… I saw you looking, and, you can touch if you want to. I don’t mind it… I know it’s not pretty, but it doesn’t hurt me or anything.”
“Tony,” Bruce said gently. “You only have to tell Ross that I went rogue. That way, I’ll be top priority for his team, and while your two groups face off alone, I’ll be keeping them busy. You’ll have to make the others see that we’re not really there to fight them. That we’re just staging this. You’ll talk to Steve, let him get away, and follow him after.” He took a deep breath, and looked at Tony with a small smile. “You know it best: There’s nothing Ross likes more than getting his hands on me. He wants some prime example for his movement. He lost James, he lost Wanda, and after Wakanda, I’m the perfect guy for the job.”
Friday fell silent at that, thankfully—and Tony stood up, walking over to where DUM-E was currently standing. He was still offline, had been ever since Tony’d sold Avengers Tower. Tony let a hand brush over the claw, petting it. With a sigh, he leaned against the robot, closing his eyes.
Steve stood up as well. “I don’t want you sobering up and deciding you hate me for taking advantage.”
Knowing that, however, didn’t stop Tony from opening the car and starting the ignition. He sighed. He could always say he’d just happened to make a little detour after his meeting, going out for a drink, and meeting Steve there had been a
“Mostly, yes, but…” Tony paused, frowned, then said, “Imagine it like that: They’re opening their door, and it leads to a corridor with lots of different doors. So we need to be the only other open door at the far end of the corridor, and we need to be open at the exact same time, otherwise there’s a good chance another door accidentally opens and the two of you land in, I don’t know, 2040.”
Rhodey sighed again, but didn’t let him wait too long. “Well… she loved the thrill,” he continued. “It wasn’t just sailing—she loved everything that was exciting, everything that was dangerous. The day she died… we’re all still not sure what happened. She just disappeared. Tony didn’t tell me anything—he shut me out just as much as he did with Pepper, but two months later, Indries’ body was discovered along the coast. It was Tony who had to identify her. And…” He sighed, wringing his hands together, followed by a shrug of his shoulders. “He just wasn’t the same man afterwards. I think seeing her like that just… broke him.”
“You know, sometimes you two are absolutely sickening.” Bucky stood in the kitchen doorway, his arms folded across his chest. “Not to put a damper on your kinky fun with food, but are you planning to serve that dessert sometime soon? Vision looks about ready to storm in here, Clint keeps telling him that chocolate mousse is the best thing about humanity. And if I have to watch Thor playing ‘Where’s the baby’ with Ian one more time I’ll have to stab him.”
Steve blinked at him, then choked as he pressed up more firmly against Tony’s chest. “I’m not alright.”
“Yes, I was… busy for a couple of months,” Sharon answered, and Steve accepted the half-answer for what it was.
When Steve turned around, he realized Bucky had gone completely still. He wasn’t moving at all, and only stared at Steve; half stunned, half aghast. Then, slowly, his bewildered eyes travelled over to where Tony stood, before they snapped back to Steve.
“No one died,” Steve amended, “and they would’ve killed you! Damn it, I don’t know. I was trying to keep you safe—”
"I know…" Steve said, rubbing a hand over his shoulder and squinting to keep in check whatever emotion was trying to burst through. "It's over."
Tony’s stare turned sharp and piercing, and Vision fought the urge to laugh at the incredulous look on his face. “JARVIS is gone.”
It was too much. Barely a few hours had passed since they’d started deactivating the implants, and he was already thinking about giving up.
"It did seem familiar, Captain," said Thor, scratching his beard absently. "I cannot say where from."
When they pulled into the empty and remarkably oversized parking lot, there was a distinct roadside horror movie cliché popping up in Steve’s head, which was only solidified by the “Road Side America” sign. Its paint was all but faded and a few letters were missing.
“Then explain it!” Steve all but yelled, slamming a hand on the table next to Tony, instantly drawing his attention back to him. “I cannot believe you did this behind our back!
Natasha sighed, then stepped closer to him, her arms circling him. “I’m glad you’re here.” She paused, and Tony felt her blink against his neck. “Don’t tell anyone I said that.”
Suddenly, Tony really wished Bruce could’ve joined the meeting, but then again… he understood why he wouldn’t meet Ross face to face. It was probably safer for the both of them. Bruce was still closely monitored after Wakanda, and Tony wouldn’t risk him getting in the crossfire.
Tony huffed and fell back on the bed. “’s fantastic at that,” he admitted. Then, he bit his lower lip and snickered, “He’s fantastic at ev’rything… ‘s so fantastic. ‘m so lucky. Such a lucky
Oh God, Tony surely could feel his body responding to his presence. But his face was all patience and affection as he looked at Steve.
Steve gave him an imploring look. “He’s probably hungry,” he said, and there was a hint of panic creeping into his voice. “Or we have to change his diapers. I… God, I think I forgot how both of those things work.”
The man huffed, clearly more than bit annoyed now. His long, slender fingers stroked his weirdly groomed chin in mock-thought. “Great. Isn’t that a real ball-buster? Last week wasn’t shitty enough, is that it? No, now my sex-fantasy is having a crisis of faith. You’re my wet dream, darling, you’re supposed to be naked by now, not discuss your issues with me.”
Tony shifted uncomfortably. “As I said—we kept things from each other. Turns out that wasn’t too good of a strategy.”
Once in the woods, Steve followed the river down south for a few miles before turning back. But no matter where he went, there were only ever trees and soil and an endless yellow sky. As much as the solitude did him good, there was nothing to find outside their small meadow, so after an hour or two, he started jogging back to the clearing.
Ultron had been holding Steve with the pretense of calmness; but then a jolt went through him and Steve was spiraling across the street, the guard railing crashing hard into his back when he landed.
No one said a word when Steve stormed angrily into the RV and simply dropped down on his part of the sofa, clothes and shoes and all.
“Or you’ll share it with me, and then cancel the wedding altogether,” Tony murmured, trying to step back, but Steve was having none of it. His warm hands were holding him near, and that smile, full of love and trust, nearly undid him.
“That’s really not something you have to thank me for, my friend. Couldn’t let our savior drown after he survived the fight, now could I?” Thor asked, clapping Steve’s back and Steve was relieved to hear these kind words out of Thor’s mouth after all the anger between him and Tony and what had happened with Loki’s scepter. Thor strode towards where Natasha and Clint were sitting next to the ambulance’s rear hatch and gently petted Tony’s feet for a moment, as he walked by his cot.
That roused a short, humorless laugh from Tony. “Goddammit. Obi told me you’d say something like this. He warned me. Steve… I assure you, you’re being paranoid.”
They didn’t get far. Steve made it just around the corner of their bedroom, before he pressed Tony against the next wall. With his foot he made to kick the door to the baby room shut, and Tony only just remembered to close it quietly with an intervening hand.
Tony didn’t wait a second longer. Extremis’ doors opened, and where there had once been a low tingle at the edges of his mind, he now met Ultron full-force. His presence was raw and vicious as it whipped through the cracks in Tony’s mind, and he fought to suppress uneasy shivers.
Steve merely laughed at that as he pulled Tony's hand up to kiss it again before letting go in favor of getting on with making breakfast. It didn't take very long, and answering Tony's various questions about the process proved to be fun, too.
All in all, living here wasn’t such a hardship. Aside from training the new STRIKE team, and spending most of his free time with Natasha and Clint, he’d met all sorts of interesting new people. Coulson’s team, Peggy’s niece Sharon, Sam. Sam, in particular, was a great guy. They usually did their morning runs together—sometimes jogging side by side, sometimes with each of them doing their own thing and going for breakfast afterwards.
To his right, Bucky stood stock-still, his face a blank space, painfully similar to the one on the screen as the Winter Soldier shot a bullet into the surveillance camera.
“So, this is… odd,” Tony said, and cleared his throat. “I think I said that already. Maybe it’s kind of a déjà vu dream, huh?”
When he was still Anthony Gregory Stark, he had only heard whispers and rumors about no man’s land. As Anthony No-name, he had heard the guards goad each other to go and try their luck for fame and fortune there. Because apparently only wanted criminals lived there, and whoever caught them would be highly rewarded.
Gregory was very aware that Stane would try to use their plan to bind him, but that was a worry for his future self. After a few hours, they concluded their schemes and just needed the right opportunity. As it happened, luck was on their side.
Anthony decided to stay after checking that there was no immediate danger from wildlife or bandits alike. The first few days he spent discovering more and more of the system and collecting everything he found, bringing it into the center chamber. For food he scoured the surrounding thicket until he managed to find a nearly functional rabbit trap. With all the things he had found, he actually managed to repair it and use it to hunt.
: non-graphic torture, force feeding, refusal to eat, restraints, emotional pain, imprisonment, escape
One unlucky guard was shoved towards the king’s chambers. A group of maids was leaving as he arrived, giggling and disheveled, raising the hope in the unlucky guard’s soul that his king was in good spirits. The other guards standing back, swords threateningly displayed and so the unfortunate guard knocked.
Taken aback by the polite request, Anthony stared at the small boy. The child apparently took his shock and silence for permission to say what he came for, “I wanted to ask for your name, Sir Blacksmith. You saved me and I never know which name to include in my prayers like aunt May taught me and I really want to because it’s the least I can do, you know Sir Blacksmith. I already asked around but no one knows. Everyone says you’re a blacksmith but that is that. Although I know people keep to themselves here and aunt May constantly warned about trusting people and not telling people my name and people-”
When the twins turned thirteen, the king fell ill. Stane, who was appointed regent until King Howard recovers, didn’t know of the twins. Thus when he called for the crown prince, he didn’t realize that the younger prince was the one who answered. Anthony took that opportunity to steal himself to their father’s bedside.
He wondered why those people were gone. Why desert what looked to be a strategically advanced and very secure way of living in the no-man’s land?
Making a split decision, Tony put a hand on Peter’s shoulder, squeezing slightly, comfortingly, just like Jarvis had always done for him, before offering, “I don’t have much. I can’t take care of you wholly, and you will have to work a lot. But do you want to come with me?”
When the words registered with Stane and Gregory, both turned towards the other, communicating with small gestures before Stane turned towards the guard. “You heard him. Go announce it to the council.”
“Erm- say, Peter, where is your aunt then?” Tony- and it felt strange to use a different name after all- looked around a bit, hoping to spy the woman. When he looked at Peter again, Tony was taken aback by the sadness and wet eyes looking right back at him. The way Peter’s shoulders had curled inside, the way his chest heaved, Tony didn’t need him saying anything.
things, while he, Gregory, was cunning and ambitious, utilizing his resources and furthering his influences.
At first, the guards took pleasure in his pain, but the less the young, denounced prince reacted, the less joy they found in their actions. After weeks of trying to get Anthony to react, they ceased their cruel work.
- wanted to be king so badly, Anthony would let him. The former prince had never been interested in ruling. His only concern was how to ensure the well-being of his people. He would rather come up with machinery to help the common folk get the most out of the land they had than lead a war to get new territory for more crop fields the way his father had.
Taking his chances, the guard entered, hands sweating and inner turmoil showing in his hunched back and trembling fingers. “Your Majesty,” the guard spoke submissively, bowing as low as he could without tumbling over.
After a year and a half of imprisonment and pain, of humiliation and betrayal, of anger and sadness, a year and a half after he became Anthony No-name, the young man escaped.
Anthony was still. For a long time after that fateful night, Anthony didn’t speak, didn’t grunt, didn't make any sound. He only ate or drank when a guard shoved the stale bread and stagnant water down his throat. Not that he wanted to eat, but even if he had, they would still have had to force-feed him because of how heavily restrained Anthony was.
Later, Anthony would lament their deaths, despite those men being responsible for his weak physical state.
With hesitant steps the adolescent searched the cave system, finding more and more traces of a whole village having lived here once. A child’s toy was there, a broken kettle here, some leftover scraps of clothing. Tools lay scattered around, broken and rusty, some worse than others.
The agitation following that discovery rippled through every rank of guards. The young king wasn’t known for mercy. Especially not when someone had failed at what he believed to be an easy task. And the nameless prisoner? Guarding him was thought to be the easiest task.
His wrists shackled together, limiting his dexterity. One foot chained to the bedpost, with only 3 feet range for him to wander on most days. As if that alone wasn’t awful enough, they put a collar around his neck. Some days - the guards called them the ‘
He wasn’t, not by far; while his body was weak from fatigue and pain, Anthony’s main resource had always been his mind. He knew the weak points of a human body. Had studied the guards individual weaknesses. Knew the shifts and the moments when most guards would be too drunk to be of use.
The younger prince’s eyes had also become lighter over the years, and soon enough they would no longer be confused for one another. Gregory needed to act. Soon. Otherwise, he would never gain the right to be king.
In the year he had been here, Stane had visited only twice, and his brother not at all. Maybe the former prince shouldn’t have been able to keep track of time, but his mind, unlike his body, remained sharp and vigilant.
The next things he repaired were some tools used for forging. Anthony was impressed by all he saw, by the cave village, by the imprint of life left behind.
Still, something inside him directed him to keep an eye out. Told him not to walk away, even though he would not take direct action, would not set out for revenge. The brunet would watch, keep vigil over the people of the kingdom. To do that, he needed to establish himself, to set up a life for himself right under King Gregory’s nose without anyone knowing who he was.
Slowly, ever so slowly Anthony managed to build himself a new life. He had been rather fortunate, all things considered. An old man, Yinsen, had taken pity on the injured boy and had taken him in for a while, caring for Anthony’s wounds and not asking many questions.
After all, should any of the council become suspicious or his brother fight his way out, the identical birthmark on both their chests would give Anthony away. The younger prince would hear his brother’s screams for years to come.
In hindsight, he shouldn’t have done that. But how could he have known that he would be betrayed like this? Stabbed in the back by his own twin brother.
When the trembling guard had finished, silence reigned. A combination of tension, fear, and dread made the young guard lookup.
Over weeks and months, seasons passing by, Anthony made the cave village his reign, his home. The things he could repair, he repaired. Those that were beyond, he used to experiment, to make something new out of it. Sometimes he was able to trade with other outlaws. Soon enough, other people noticed his skill in forging and repairs and brought things to him whenever he was at the nearest outlaw encampment.
Gregory answered the door to the princes’ chamber, hearing out the soldier who relayed the summons to the throne room. The young prince had nodded and said, “Please tell the regent I will be there shortly. I have to finish something up before.”
During his time in the no-man's land he builds himself a new life,  with new people whilst still dealing with the betrayal.
Stumbling over his words, knowing he had only limited time to convince his king that he was not at fault for the prisoner’s escape, the guard rushed to explain how the early shift had found the dead guards. How the cell had been empty. How the other guards were already searching, at the moment most likely combing through the castle. How he was just the messenger.
“I heard, Gregory. But… I would rather go and see how Father is faring. Would you go instead?” Anthony’s voice was soft and hopeful. Gregory could hear the adoration and the tenderness in his brother’s words and had to contain a sneer. That was a further difference between the two. While Gregory thrived under the tutelage of Stane, Anthony’s interest was in books and smithery. He even had stolen himself away once and came back with strange metallic things he had built.
Not yet, though. At that moment, Anthony No-name was slipping away from guards, blending into a larger crowd of travelers, and hiding in the shadows.
Tony took a deep breath and offered Rhodey a self-conscious smile. “Alright, uh, Rhodey, remember when I told you that I couldn’t take astrology lessons with Mr. Brown in 8th?”
The air was a bit stale when they walked in together, and Steve let his duffle bag drop on the floor, as he turned to Tony. “Well. That’s basically it,” he said, waving at the tiny room in general, before positioning both hands at Tony's waist. "Wanna see the rest?"
“You’re dead!” Tony yelled, and his whole body was shaking terribly. There were tears stinging his eyes now, and his voice was hoarse. “You’re dead, okay? You
“And here I thought you had all of these complex tactics and strategies going, this looks a bit sloppy,
At first, Tony didn’t even make the connection between the noise and the phone, and when he did, he was too paralyzed to move.
“If I could take one thing back…” Steve said, his voice struggling to stay steady, “it would be this.”
The more ground they covered, the darker it became and if it weren’t for Tony’s repulsor, it would be pitch black by now.
A gulp at that. “Yeah, well… I kind of lost you at some point. Sorry. But you did get here on your own, apparently… Steve said you went to bed as soon as you got here. You don’t remember?”
“When you said I’m already affecting my own past, then you mean that…” Steve started, glancing at Strange with a worried look.
“Steve’s not my boyfriend,” Tony said. “He’s my…” He fell quiet, frowning at nothing in particular, realizing, maybe for the first time, that he had no idea if Steve still was his husband. The word had come so naturally to him for years, always something he'd said with a giddy sort of pride, and it was strange to question it now.
"Yeah?" Steve asked, taking it for what it was—a permission to get closer. He set down the bottle and sent another small smile at Tony before approaching the suit, which hung a short distance from them. He rounded it once, taking in the smooth edges and the seamless transitions between materials.
God, she was even more beautiful than he remembered. And then her hand on his neck, kneading the skin there. He fought the instinct to pull away. It had been years since he’d felt a gentle caress, and it made him uneasy to have someone touch him like that. But when he looked into Natalia’s eyes, he saw profound understanding there. His muscles relaxed, and his head dropped onto Steve’s shoulder in defeat.
Tony shook his head and cast Steve a bright smile. “Nothing. Was just drifting off, sorry,” he said, and it was true enough. Everything was going well and there was no reason to make a big deal out of this right now. He should be able to keep it simple. He’d done so all his life, why should things be any different now?
“Steve, come on,” Natasha asked. “What do you have to lose? I can see that it’s eating you. Worst case, you’ll get some closure.”
With as much time as Doctor Banner and Stark had spent with him in the past few weeks, a basic understanding of human emotions had forced itself back into his mind. And every time he opened his eyes and glanced through the window, he knew exactly what went through Steve’s head. Steve had always been horrible at waiting on the sidelines while there was a job to be done. He never had been a patient guy, always too insistent and head-strong for his own good.
Steve walked into his apartment, his step heavy and his shoulders hunched. He dropped his bag just a short way from the door and walked over to slump down in his sofa. The house was quiet, and Steve absently wondered if Bucky was out with Natasha. It was nice to know Bucky was starting to get things under control, at least. True, finding a job was still a struggle, but it looked like the dark cloud over Bucky had passed, and that renewed optimism found its place. In time, Steve hoped, things would turn out for the best for his friend.
As Steve turned back to Tony, his eyes were back to their natural brown, his stance immediately defensive. “It’s nothing,” he said, tone a little too insistent, and Steve didn’t believe him one bit.
“Pleasant memories,” Steve confirmed with a smile and walked closer. DUM-E was rolling over to him, whirring happily as Steve petted his main strut.
Before he knew what was happening, his treacherous hand had reached the back of Tony’s head, his fingers grazing his hair with an odd combination of curiosity and nervousness. Even if the room around him remained imagined,
Tony sighed, while playing with the few hairs beneath Steve’s belly button. “If you really want him to move up here… We would need to start with monitored daily releases. Ease him into it. Or perhaps once a week, depending on how much he pisses me off.”
“Yeah, yeah… I’m a scientist, contingencies are kind of my thing. Now get to work, Steve,” Tony all but ordered, spreading his legs somewhat, and the next couple of minutes were a series of moans and whimpers, and not just from Tony.
Tony wisely remained where he was, at the far end of the room, trying to look as nonthreatening as possible. Of course, with Stane’s corpse lying to his feet, and the many…
Tony snorted, trying not to lose his shit right then and there. “See? That’s—you said that before. In those exact words, I think.”
“No,” Tony interrupted him fiercely. “I never loved her. I never thought I was capable of hating another person like that. And I wasn’t. Not until I met her.” He paused. “You really didn’t know I love you?”
because he always was when it came to Tony, but resolute to trust him to say if anything was wrong. Tony was his husband, and they’d been through so much in the last couple of years. Tony might still not be able to share every single secret with Steve, but he did tell him about all things that were important. It was how they worked, and Steve trusted Tony with his whole heart.
“You wanted to make turkey without butter,” Steve reminded him. “Don’t know if I can move on from that.”
Steve huffed, but turned sideways to kiss Tony’s forehead anyway. “I don’t recall seeing you eat fruit salad ever before.”
JARVIS had always nagged him about his… well, might as well call it an infatuation, all things considered. Whenever Tony had complained about some argument he and Steve had had, JARVIS had insisted that Tony only fought Steve every step of the way because he was one of the only people who really got under his skin.
, came to mind, and Steve twisted around to cover Tony with his own body. “Oh, yes,” Tony sighed as Steve’s weight settled fully on top of him.
“Right,” Steve said with a huff, flexing his shoulders. At least Fury was blunt and honest about it. And still. Things had gone far enough, and he was through with waiting at the sidelines, ducking his head when things weren’t sitting right with him. “I’m going back to New York. I will talk to Agent Rumlow myself. Have him take over Strike Delta.”
Steve could see Tony’s expression tightening. “I see,” he said in acknowledgement, and not much else.
Rationally, Steve knew that, while Mister Stark enjoyed his company very much, he most certainly wished another pair of eyes would look back at him. And yet, the days they spent together were simply wonderful. He loved listening to Mister Stark when he talked about his marvelous inventions and he was dazed with how fast his mind seemed to work. Listening to his ideas about the future, about what the world might one day look like… it was humbling.
couldn’t do anything but stand there. And with the way Steve held him, like he was something very precious, Tony suddenly felt like he held Steve’s heart in his bare hands.
Tony exhaled a long breath. This conversation had always been inevitable, it seemed. Might as well get it over now. “Don’t know if that’s a good or a bad thing.”
“Stark, he can’t help you.” She shook her head as she walked closer. “He was very clear about that.”
Steve found his spot at the counter. It had been years since he'd been here, but he remembered exactly he’d sat down back then. After placing an order, Steve looked around and let himself turn inwards. He saw a few guys sitting around a table on the far corner of the place, one of them wearing a cast on his left arm. They were probably celebrating that guy's release from the hospital, Steve mused, noting the bruises and the darkened skin on his cheek.
Tony nodded, though he did nothing to wipe the omnipresent smile from his face when Steve pulled off of him. The fact that everyone was pretty much okay with what was happening between them and that—outside the expected leers, stares, and almost-commentary—no one had said anything negative, struck Tony as an utter miracle. The least he’d expected was for Barnes to punch him once and be done with it. His not-quite-approval might be very palpable but also pretty much resigned.
Straight or not, Steve had never so much as cast him a lingering glance. They had communication issues that killed all communication issues and…
This was definitely the better kind of workout, he decided. Barely a minute had passed since he left Tony’s side, and yet his skin tingled as though still brushing intimately against him. His nostrils were flooded with Tony’s scent. He was all around him. Inescapable. And even with so little space separating them, he already felt the burden of detachment.
Steve wanted to hug him, then, but somehow it didn’t feel like the right moment. Instead, he leaned into Tony more fully and pressed a kiss against his cheek. But Tony was having none of it. Fingers dug into Steve’s shirt and he pulled him closer, while guiding Steve’s mouth to his.
Slowly, Steve dressed himself and crept towards the Morning Room, his sketchbook tucked under his arm. Today, he’d meet Pepper and Tony’s other friends. He had no idea how much time he had before they arrived—or how long they’d stay. But he did wonder what they’d want to talk about. About the nature of his and Tony’s relationship? Would they approve? Or would they show their distaste openly like Stane had?
“I mean, I know I messed up with Ultron, so leaving the team felt like my only option at the time, and I don’t really regret it. I knew they couldn’t trust me anymore.” He swallowed.
Steve looked up at that, staring down in her unfocused blue eyes. He could pinpoint the exact moment when he lost her again. One moment she was here, and then she was gone.
“If he blows himself up in here, it’ll unleash a mix of deadly fumes upon the city,” Tony reminded them.
“Put it down,” he heard a female voice say and turned around to look at Natasha. She stood in the shadows only a few steps away from him. Probably had the whole time.
“Can’t this wait until tomorrow?” Jarvis asked the agents again. “I would ask you to let Mister Stark process the news first. She was his wife, after all.”
Preparing dinner didn’t take much. Steve, predictably, did the bulk of the work, while calling out orders here and there.
He jerked a little when he felt Tony’s hand on his own. “T-takes t-two to t-tango…” he said, stuttering so badly he barely got the words out.
Barnes sighed, but nodded all the same. Tony pointed him to sit down on the lid of a sturdy wicker clothes hamper, directing him to prop his human hand on the sink across from him. He submitted to Tony’s orders without complaint, like the good soldier he was, his eyes following him as he grabbed a pack of cotton balls and a small bottle from the medicine cabinet above the sink.
Steve watched as Bucky opened his mouth to say something, but he was interrupted by a sudden sound in the back of the hall.
“Let’s get that time machine of yours,” Tony said, just in time before one of the bots turned up in the shadows.
It didn’t matter, though. Barnes had already decided to stay behind, too afraid of Ultron messing with his implants, and Tony figured in the grand scheme of things, it was the smart thing to do.
Stane smiled at him quietly and it wasn’t hard to tell that the man didn’t like him, but Tony had said that he and Stane would be friends. It was what Tony wanted. And for his sake, Steve was willing to try.
“I know,” Steve murmured with a distraught tone, keeping him still. “As soon as you stop trashing, I’ll go. Don’t want to make this harder on you.”
“You’ve been at court about twenty times during Bucky’s trial,” Tony reminded him gently. “And you’ve made it pretty clear how you feel about any form of preventative measures.”
The thought had drifted through Steve’s mind often in the last couple of hours. How the furniture was in different stages of dinged-up, which only made the room feel all the more homey. There were books, and flowers, and all those photographs showing Clint with his family throughout their lives. Kids clothes were strewn around, apple juice bottles and cups of tea littered the couch table, and piles of paper, drawing pencils and crayons teetered on the dinner table, where Steve was currently busy coloring some butterfly with Lila Barton.
“It’s a combination of things—with Steve,” Barnes said. “He’s alright as long as he has a purpose. The army, SHIELD, the Avengers—he had a place. Not always a good one, otherwise he wouldn’t have worked as hard to close SHIELD down, but… he had something to hold on to. And he had you guys at his back if he needed you. But ever since the team split up… he’s… lost.”
“Wanna hold him?” Tony asked Bucky, and Steve raised a brow in surprise, because he hadn’t expected that. Not that Tony didn’t like Bucky—Steve was sure that beneath a layer of side-comments, snark and banter, the two actually liked each other—but
Oh God, he wouldn’t be letting Tony wait until he turned eighteen, would he? The thought alone was all kinds of horrific, and Tony would surely die of blue balls if Steve decided to keep him at arm’s length for so long… Okay,
Tony’s eyes found the ground, anger receding. Rhodey was pointing a sandwich at him expectantly, but Tony shook his head. “No. Bring me another coffee?” he asked, and
“Oh my…” Steve said, staring at Ian, who very slowly started to walk up to him. He was flailing, but regained his stance pretty quickly. A few steps in, Tony let go of his hand, and Ian just kept going. Eyes wide, he
There was a small smile playing around the man’s lips. “You’re my creature,” he said almost softly. “Do you understand what is expected of you?”
Surprise was too inadequate a word. Tony didn’t understand it, and naturally, things he didn’t understand scared him shitless.
Sure, he was also considering arguing with Tony about safety regulations, but that was something—he realized upon hearing Tony's voice—that would have to wait for later.
The only thing missing was the abstract painting on the wall and the wooden easel in the corner. Otherwise, it was one hundred percent their room. The motel room in which they’d met in their dreams. Only it had never been a motel room. It had been Tony’s bedroom, all along.
Tony bristled, staring down on his shoes. “Whatever, man, stop deflecting. I refuse to take Captain Quarterback on our road trip. I call veto. That’s the end of it.”
The position was new, even for Tony. The way Steve felt as he thrust in and withdrew, touching all those hidden places deep inside him. After a few moments of simply revelling in the sensation, Tony began to move with him, intuitively falling into a steady rhythm.
Rhodey frowned as he looked at Tony. “For us, it’s only been three days since the two of you fell through the portal. We wasted time trying to find the right one. Stephen managed to identify it today and we opened it right away.”
He’d never really been a cuddler in bed, he prefered his own space, hadn’t once managed to fall asleep as long as there was another person pressed up against him, and yet… here he was. Tangled into Steve and sleeping like a baby.
The suit rushed to the ground, coming to a perfectly executed stop on one of the small side streets, a few corners away from Steve’s apartment. By now, Mark Forty-Two worked beautifully, its prehensile technology integrating perfectly with Extremis and Tony’s nervous system. Within a blink of the eye, the suit bled back into Tony’s body, leaving him in a sharp black suit and a blue dress shirt he’d worn for his meetings today. Tony walked up to Steve’s building and once he arrived at the front door, he turned the key, jogging up the steps to the second floor.
Steve's back arched at the touch to his dick. He felt exposed, more so than usual, with his knees spread and pulled up a little and his entire upper body feeling hot and flushed. Tony wasn't easing that feeling much, saying everything that came to mind and shaking Steve to the core.
“You’re right,” Strange confirmed. “You shouldn’t give us any more indicators than strictly necessary. But I think it’s safe to tell me if I’ll be able to contact myself. I don’t want any more details.”
. I’d like to think we don’t need the formalities anymore, don’t you? Stop this ‘Mister Stark’ bullshit.”
Standing back, Steve raised his hands in the air in a gesture of surrender. He could easily hear the anger and frustration in Tony’s voice, the hurt. Steve bit his lower lip and nodded his head to show he understood. Still, he stayed as close as Tony allowed him to be.
Steve’s face and front were hidden in the shadow, but the light behind him outlined his form, casting his pale skin and hair in a soft golden halo. “Tony?” he asked. “You awake?”
“What happened?” he whispered, involuntarily taking a step closer. It had been the wrong move, though, because Bucky lunged for him.
Closing his eyes briefly, Tony’s scarred skin began to soften again, the Devil Face making room for a more bearable appearance.
A huff. Tony sat down on his side of the bed, his eyes still trained on the television. “He’s so gone for her.”
Despite what most of America believed, Steve had never been a great believer in God. He liked the idea of some sort of justice that was beyond humanity’s reach, but he’d never quite believed in a higher force or an all-knowing being. Truth be told, he hadn’t believed in much of anything since his mother had developed her first cough, and as a teenager he’d publicly denounced religion and God in the middle of class.
Shaking himself out of his stupor, Tony raised his head to kiss Steve again. One of his legs wound itself around him and hauled Steve inward until they were pressed chest to chest.
Right. Of course Steve wouldn’t greet him with a ‘Hello, who’s there’, or even just say his name. He’d given Tony the phone, so he knew who the caller was. Kinda made Tony curious what name he’d tagged Tony with in
“No,” Tony confirmed, and goddammit, there were tears in Steve’s eyes, now. “Doesn’t really matter. I had a whole year to get over it.”
Heat rushed to Tony’s face, and he stared at Steve for a long moment. They hadn’t said it yet, though Tony had wanted to many times. Yesterday at his birthday. Three weeks ago, when Steve finally got his PhD. Or… seven months ago, when they’d gotten together. He’d loved Steve for so long now, it seemed ridiculous he hadn’t once told him so.
Wanda blinked, biting her lower lip before she seemed to remember herself and schooled her expression to something pointedly neutral. “You mean you want us to come work for you?”
“Shhh… I know.” Tony leaned back to pull out a little bottle from his pants’ pockets, and coated his palm with the fluid, before returning his slick hand to Steve’s dick. Steve grasped Tony’s hips and held at the new sensation, thrusting forward ever so-slightly.
He really wished he could make this easier for her, could sweep what had happened in Lagos under some giant carpet, but it wouldn’t do anyone good. Sokovia—each and every death—it was on him, and it was time they’d face the consequences of their actions.
. Then he pinched his nose and shook his head. “Is this how it’s gonna be now? Give you two an enclosed area, and you’re going at it like bunnies?”
“I think he’s found a new purpose. We’ll never run out of fruit salad ever again,” Tony murmured next to him, an equally amused smile on his lips, as he leaned his head against Steve’s shoulder.
When it came to the Avengers, Steve was the boss. It was just how things were between them, and one of the many reasons why their relationship was as stable as it was. And while they often argued about some random mission strategy, he wouldn’t go and simply disobey Steve’s orders if he didn’t absolutely have to.
Tony’s gaze flickered to the others, who looked equally unsettled. At least he didn’t seem to be the only one picking up vibes that something was off kilter. “Do we know where he was?” Tony asked.
Tony’s eyes were large, imploring Steve’s but similarly unable to hold his gaze for longer than a few seconds at a time. “No, darling, you don’t.”
The team sat around him—even Wanda and Pietro, their gazes more than a little troubled. By now, he’d told them everything, from the very beginning—all leading up to the Sokovia Accords and what had happened with Helmut Zemo. How easy it had been for him to tear the team apart, because the distrust had already been there and they had been all too ready to give in to that pent-up rage. He’d told them about Vision, about Tony’s plan to eventually get his hands on enough vibranium to build his body with Helen Cho’s help.
Tony’s eyes scanned those words over and over again, realizing that it really had to be true then. In four years, he and Steve had at last learned to work together, live together, spend time together. And they had really become friends again?
He looked up, back at Tony’s face, and forced a smile on his face when he saw Tony’s worried expression. “You,” he said truthfully.
—you didn’t kill anyone. HYDRA did. And now, come on. The shop’s downstairs. Won’t even take half an hour.”
DUM-E was kind of trying to reach for him with his claw, but the mechanism was still flawed and he only managed to fist bump the air next to Tony’s shoulder.
"You're right," he said, nodding his head. He looked at the woman, then. She seemed surprised, maybe worried, Steve couldn't bring himself to care. "You just went for the next older blonde you could find."
Racking his brain, Tony tried to remember if Steve had ever mentioned any of the strategies he’d used when Ian wouldn’t stop crying, but couldn’t think of any. He knew his baby loved lying on Steve’s bare chest more than anything, but that probably had something to do with the accelerated heartbeat the serum had given Steve.
Steve glanced in both directions of the corridor, making sure they were still alone. Then, he turned around again, gauging Tony’s expression carefully. “Look, if the… agency thing is too much right now, on top of everything else, we don’t have to go to the appointment on Friday. We can reschedule, or… take more time, generally.”
“Not so bad for a whippersnapper,” Barnes said as Tony sat down at the table, tipping a glass in his direction. Next to him, Natasha gave him a small nod, and there might’ve been the hint of a smile on her dark red lips, which basically translated to her really liking Tony and being proud of his achievements.
“You’re not really here, are you?” Tony asked. He linked his fingers with Steve’s hand and drew it into his lap.
“You don’t have to watch that,” he said, and tried to reach for Tony’s shoulders to lead him away, but Tony stood firm, shrugged off Steve’s grip with the force of his hands.
“Winter Soldier,” she corrected herself, then whirled suddenly, one skilled foot catching him sharply across the temple. The blow knocked him backwards, and he almost fell down the stairs as he watched her run back to the car. He righted himself at the last moment and darted past her. He tried to catch her, but she was a blur of color, evading his attacks easily. When she finally faced him, the knives in her hand almost found his heart several times, and it was sheer dexterity and his rigorous training that allowed him to duck away in time. She was lissome, and the movements of her assault were delightfully smooth. It was like dancing, she moved like a ballerina, and seemed to anticipate his every move.
Steve shifted a little closer. Tony tried to get away again, but he was penned in all around by trees, so there was really nowhere for him to go.
Slowly, Tony approached the bed. He sat Steve’s shield down on the floor next to it, cautiously leaning it against the wall, and let his fingers brush over the smooth surface for a moment. It had taken JARVIS about two minutes to track the shield, and even less to retrieve it. It was the fact that fishing the damn shield out of the damn Potomac river was necessary that didn't sit well with Tony. With another long sigh, he sat down and took one of Steve’s hands in his. His skin felt cold, but there was also a healthy pulse beating underneath.
, there was nothing quite like the sight of a grown, bulky man squirming with the need of getting filled. To see all that superhuman strength surrender to him…
Tony sighed heavily. He walked into the living room and dropped, a little disappointed, onto the couch. His gaze swept through the empty room, frowning at the boxes once more. Steve would’ve told him about this, Tony was sure of it. Unless, of course, this was a spur of the moment decision, in which case, something would have gone wrong on his latest mission.
“I trust you have been studying the proper ball etiquette these past few days?” Stane asked. “We can’t be embarrassed in front of everyone.”
But his body had other ideas. He knew the minute he was about to come and suddenly his fingers were plucking at Tony’s cock and he leaned back a bit to change the angle of his thrusts. His head dropped forward to watch and he hissed in pleasure.
Steve took Tony’s hand and began tugging him towards the door. “Come on, dad. They know how to make Ian’s milk and the night’s not getting any younger.”
There was a sound that was probably meant to be a sigh, though it didn’t even come close to a human one.
Tony smiled slightly. "Kinda. I still feel as though she's talking a whole lot of crap," Tony said. "Really?" Steve laughed.
All too soon, their time with their daughter is over and they have to leave. For Tony, it's a bitter-sweet moment and a part of him wants to resist when the nurse takes her from his arms. But then he sees the way Steve watches as Nurse Hannah puts their daughter - their so very tiny daughter - in the too-big incubator and he feels a deep pang of sorrow for the soldier.
Tony sighs but pulls the chair closer to the edge of Steve's bed, then sits, scooting forward until he can lean his elbows onto the bed.
When she was finally finished saying whatever was on her mind, she smiled up at him, her blue eyes twinkling and patted him on the shoulder before kissing him on the cheek and wishing him luck.
It's incredibly thoughtful of her. Steve knows how difficult it must be for her because of his break-up with Tony. Of course, she wasn't rude or on an obvious side, Pepper was never like that, but he can't help but feel that a baby has just made things even more difficult. They hadn't planned this and he knew that Pepper liked things to be planned out, especially since she had to work so hard at the company. Of course, working for Tony is hard enough as it is, but when you're running his company Steve can only imagine just how much harder it is. Add the fact that Tony was now a new parent, well, things would be much, much more difficult.
When he gets an affirmative sounding sound he takes it as an okay to put the phone down and end the call, which he does despite the wide eyes that Tony is sending him.
"Thank you. Guess I'm the luckiest guy to have someone like him as my fiancé," Tony said fondly, glancing at Steve as he did.
"You okay, Tony?" Steve asked, and just like that it felt as if whatever little composure he had, had broken. Cracked.
And now that he's blurted everything out to Steve, it really doesn't seem that bad. It might be awkward - they weren't together anymore, after all - but for the sake of their daughter and the fact that it simply wasn't practical to pack a bag for her at the end of every week and dump her on the other's floor when their week with her was over, it was easier for them to live together. It made him uncomfortable and brought back memories of when he was a child and when Howard had him shipped to boarding school. Granted, the situations weren't the same, but the feeling of living out of a suitcase and the feeling of not being wanted was something that made him pause and think that a situation like his past one could be prevented.
"You two are conspiring against me. See if I don't sell you to a community college, JARVIS. The little rugrats won't appreciate you enough and then you'll regret ever turning against me," Tony said with a sniff.
"But, I did manage to finish all the paperwork and Pepper seems pretty happy with me. Not that she can't be anything less than happy with me, because I'm an absolute delight. Right, honey?" Tony said with a smug look.
It takes them both a while to figure out that all of their outings together were actually dates. To remedy the fact that neither of them were acknowledging them as the dates they were, they decide to go out on a few more dates, this time going to proper restaurants that required suits and visiting the museum (Tony liked seeing Steve's eyes light up in happiness whenever they saw the various art pieces).
Then Tony realized what he needed was someone to talk to. Someone to actually understand him and pour his heart out to. What he needed was professional help. A therapist.
He steps back, feeling as though he's not needed, and keeps to the side, content to just be standing there watching over Tony.
Steve looked good, well, as good as someone who just gave birth could look. Apparently, he'd manage to take a shower, because Tony could see that the blond's hair was wet and he looked refreshed.
It's only when someone touches his shoulder that he startles, jumping slightly out of fright and he's nearly too late to stop from punching the person in the face.
"I could do it by myself. Getting someone in to unpack a few boxes is unnecessary. And besides, I'm nearly finished. All I need to do is pack this away and then I'm done," Steve says.
As for last Christmas, he can't help but hate how accurate George Michael was when he was writing the song.
Three days later, he was asleep in his and Tony's bedroom, head facing out towards the balcony that overlooked the rest of the city.
Tony looked at him, one eyebrow raised before he sat up and paused the show. "Are you going to answer that?" he asked.
He knows that he just told another lie to Tony; he's not going to be waiting there for Tony when he wakes up tomorrow morning.
Right, whether Tony wanted to or not, they were going to leave this bathroom and the gala, and nothing would get him to stop.
"I'm - I didn't mean to say that. Look, just forget I said anything," he mutters, moving to walk around Tony but quick as a whip, Tony grabs his hand, tugging at it until he stops.
not me and you and then you and Sharon. And really, you aren't even a little bit ashamed to admit that you went out to dinner with her? I won't back off, Steve. I deserve at least a little more than that. Why did you go out with her? Were you just stringing me along? Or did you finally realize that what you needed was a woman to fuck?" Tony laughed bitterly, sneering at Steve when he said the last sentence.
He grabbed Steve's chin and tilted it so that Steve was looking at him. "Hey, forget about them. They'll always have an opinion, whether it's right or wrong. Besides, what do they know about my type anyway? I know that I have a thing for smart, mouthy, good-looking blonds who won't think twice before punching me in the face if I say something stupid or even hesitate to put me in my place. No one does that better than you, okay? As for people thinking that you're just after my money, who exactly will say something like that? You refuse to let me pay for dinner or buy you gifts!" Tony exclaims, sounding exasperated.
When he asks Steve how he's feeling, the blond can only groan in response, turning his face into the pillows.
"Good morning, Tony. I wasn't here all night, promise. I slept for a bit but couldn't sleep any longer and lying in bed wasn't cutting it for me. I realized that there were still a few more things to pack away before Morgan comes home and here I am."
And now the team had been crowded around the common room, each in various states of undress and all wearing similar looks of exhaustion.
"Come on, let's get some dinner and watch a movie. I'm starving," she looks over her shoulder at him, "And I miss my bonding buddy. We haven't done anything fun together in a while."
Sam, who had been sitting next to Thor, who, for once in his life was uncharacteristically silent - and maybe it was due to the huge box of Pop-Tarts that he was munching on - rolled his eyes and stood up. "Well, if none of you are going to do anything, I'm going back to bed," he said, shaking his head in disbelief before yawning.
Tony doesn't answer straight away, grabbing a plastic chair that he spied earlier when he entered the room and places it beside the one that Steve's sitting on. He sits down and leans closer so that he can rub a finger gently across the baby's cheek.
It takes slightly longer than it usually would to get them moving, especially with Steve moving slower because of the pain he was in.
"Tony, JARVIS is going to tell us if it's safe or not for us to leave the bathroom, okay? If there's no one outside then we can leave, and if there is then JARVIS will make sure that they don't come after you - us, okay? JARVIS always keeps you safe, doesn't he? He looks after you?" he says it softly, praying to whatever godly beings were listening that Tony would trust him on this one and let them leave the bathroom.
The sight is enough to make his stomach turn and he has to breathe in and out several times so that he doesn't empty his already empty stomach.
Not that he planned to do anything with the ring anytime soon. The stress that Steve was going through over them announcing the pregnancy to the rest of the world was enough for him to go through. Maybe when things calmed down and had settled somewhat would he pull out the ring.
When he gets to the medbay, he sees Bruce waiting there, glasses rested on the bridge of his nose and is settled comfortably in a chair, some sort of textbook in his hands.
"I'm trying! You won't even give me a chance. I can be nice, I swear!" he says. And maybe it came out a bit shrill because the people walking pass all give him strange looks.
Either way, if he were in Steve's shoes he'd think the same thing. And who knows, maybe the blond already thought that.
Bucky grinned, whooping as he jumped off the sofa and ran to the elevator, presumably to fetch his coat. Well, he got that from what little he could make out of Bucky's brooklyn drawl. It was always hard to make out what he was saying whenever he got excited.
"Leave what, Steve? The fact that you look like you're about to drop dead? You look exhausted. JARVIS, how much has Steve slept while I was away?" Tony asked, looking at him while he waited for a response from the A.I.
In itself, that was pretty weird. The whole them being close situation. Because Tony and Pepper were broken up, but not properly broken up and Sharon seemed real flirty with Steve whenever they happened to bump into her on the Helicarrier. Which was rare - she worked for the CIA and didn't really affiliate herself with SHIELD anymore, not properly, at least - thank god for that.
Steve felt Tony's words crash into him like a tank. For his sake, and Tony's, he chose to ignore the nickname that Tony called him. He focused instead on what Tony had admitted. It was extremely unlike him to admit that he didn't feel well, even more that he was scared.
Steve finally gave birth! These two are still pining after one another and they can't see it. Don't we just love two oblivious idiots?
It was a bad night for him. The day itself wasn't the best, and the night just seemed to end on a bad note.
Tony lay in the bed he used to share with Steve. The bed still smelled faintly of all things Steve and Tony had this strange urge to scream and cry at the same time. The truth was that he missed Steve. More often than not, he'd turn around in bed to lay his head on Steve's chest only to find the bed empty. And that wasn't all. Sometimes when he was in the workshop he would find himself starting a sentence, talking to Steve, and then he'd remember that Steve was in Wakanda.
So yes, his therapist did help him a lot. But some problems can't be talked about and hey presto! Everything is sorted. It really can't. And Tony of all people knew that. Sometimes all he wanted to do was to lie in Steve's arms again and just be. No Accords. No therapy. No stupid villain trying to take over the world. Just them.
And then he frowns again, looking at Steve as if he kicked his puppy. "Steve, don't you love me? 'm sorry. Pep says I gotta say sorry if I'm - if I'm rude to someone. She says I gotta have manners. Was I - did I say something bad?"
He takes a deep breath, holding it in and counts backwards from ten. When he deems himself calm enough, he stares at Stone, narrowing his eyes and crosses his arms.
It’s the third mission with the rest of the team in the last couple of months. If he’s counting - which he is; he hasn’t had much to keep his mind from roaming to more traitorous thoughts and at the moment he’ll take anything to keep his thoughts from wandering - then this is his fifth mission ever since he and Tony broke up.
When she's done and all the items are laid out on the marble countertop, she hands him a plate and gestures to the bagels that she's managed to produce from somewhere.
It's strange seeing her so focused when it comes to something other than a mission, and he settles in one of the barstools to watch her as she gathers various utensils and plates and items from the fridge.
Steve raises an eyebrow at him. "Really? So Pepper didn't think I was after your money, then? I guess I must've imagined it."
He understands that Sam and Clint need to leave to be with their own families, and he and Sam weren't that close, anyway, but he kinda expected Rhodey and Pepper to tell him that they were leaving at least two weeks before. Give him some time to adjust and plan so that he doesn't look like he's alone and wallowing in his own self-pity.
"Is that a no to dinner, then?" Steve raised an eyebrow, choosing to ignore Tony's questions and answering with one of his own. He knew that Tony wouldn't say no to him.
He took a deep breath and exhaled, then walked to the kitchen, heading straight for the coffee machine and hoped that Steve and Barnes didn't notice him.
And later, he stirred awake, waking slowly to find that Tony was sitting on the edge of their bed. A look at the alarm beside him told him that it was the time he usually woke to go for a run with Sam. So he sat up in bed, trying to find the will to get out of their sleep-warm bed and watched as Tony got ready.
He immediately spots Tony in the centre of the lab, holograms splayed up in the air all around his head.
Sam and Natasha share a look that he won't try to decipher; if it's anything like the conversations they tried to bring up on several different occasions, then he doesn't want to know. He already knows what they're going to say, and he doesn't want to hear it.
Stane walked closer to the trembling prince, knowing that their chance was now. “My prince, what has you so distressed?”
He closed the door and turned towards his slightly older twin. As the years had passed, Gregory thought their slight differences had become more prominent. While Anthony’s hair was wavy and hazelnut, just like his eyes, Gregory’s was slightly more straight and had lightened to a hearthstone brown.
“Oh, brother,” Gregory smirked. “I don’t care about that old bastard. You just said everything I cared to hear. Lord Stane, would you do us the honor?”
The crown prince hiccuped a bit before he finally told them, his words ringing in the room not because they were loud but because they had such impact. “Father. The King. He is… He died.”
The monarch’s voice was cold, disinterested, but no one was foolish enough to believe it was an accurate reflection of his mood. Too often had they witnessed the cruelty behind the passive mask.
The former prince felt bitter whenever he went hunting for some meat, whenever he so much as glanced at his reflection, with a bow and a quiver filled with rudimentary wooden arrows as his chosen hunting weapon. He never had enjoyed hunting as a sport, wasn’t as good at this as Gregory, and only ever indulged in it to spend some time with his brother outside the castle walls with his brother. ‘
Anthony knew he didn’t have much time. If he could manage to cross the border, he would be out of Iron Kingdom and safe for the time being. Between his- between the Iron Kingdom and the Kingdom of Brooklyn was a strip of land, no man's land. A place where no laws applied and Anthony could dodge the guards better.
Then, exactly a year and a half after their father’s death, Anthony got a chance to escape. The young man wasn’t sure if it was the complacency, the arrogant assumption that their former prince would be a harmless sheep by now, or them feeling superior in strength and power. They weren’t completely wrong with that, at least considering their physical strength.
What he saw made him wish he hadn’t. The king’s usually handsome face was contorted in anger, teeth bared, eyes promising unimaginable pain.
Anthony was aware of their routines, even though they tried to obscure them. Even if he didn’t know why they bothered with giving him clean clothes, he knew when they would come, and he was ready for them.
During his time in the no-man's land he builds himself a new life,  with new people whilst still dealing with the betrayal.
Later, he would hear the horrific news of the cruel king having ordered the head of five guards to be displayed upon spikes upon the main gate to the capital after being executed for their failure. To serve as a warning to every person in the capital not to disappoint their king.
Rumors soon traveled far, and distantantly Anthony was aware he should keep more to himself. But he couldn’t. Not only for his own wellbeing- as the trade was essential to get him material and enough food over the winter-  but also for the others, for the weaker ones of the no-man’s land.
That was always the end of any kind of discussion. Anthony was grateful he could play with his cousin Virginia and Gregory, but he hated that shadow passing over his brother’s face every time he was told to stay behind.
After a woman being dragged by bandits, a young boy by her side, scared and hurt, and Anthony stepping in, protecting them both, people realized that there was more to him. It earned him the trust of those that lived here because they had nowhere else to turn to, and at the same time earned him the scrutiny of those that were just as Gregory- greedy.
With the fighting ceased, the denounced prince was carried away, taken to the highest tower, and locked in. Later, Gregory visited, accompanied by Stane’s most loyal men, and they did what needed to be done.
Nonetheless, his situation had changed. He no longer had the responsibility of his name weighing him down. Yet with every step he took, with every breath he desperately tried to take, he was reminded of the mass of scars on his chest. Anthony had been a witness to and victim of Gregory’s cruelty. So, if he was honest with himself, he just wanted to forget about it all and never look back...
