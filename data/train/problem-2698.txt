There’s a half empty bottle of Jack at the bottom. Fucking hell, he hasn’t even left the room in four days – how did he even get this?
“Is there anything else you want, Dean?” Hannah asks, sounding like she’d really rather be anywhere but here right now. The feeling goes three ways.
“Of course.” She notices he’s only wearing one layer – a short sleeved t-shirt – unheard of for a Winchester and also not exactly suited for living in an old ass concrete bunker. He must be freezing.
Sam ambles back into the room, drawn by the smell of almost ready bacon. Deans serves his up first, because he likes his bacon soggy, gross and practically still oinking, the fucking freak. His and Cas’s he leaves in until it’s so crunchy you’re lucky if it doesn’t cut your mouth. He doesn’t actually ask Cas whether he likes his like this, he just assumes, because that is the correct way of cooking bacon and that’s how he’s getting it until he asks otherwise.
Cas just groans again, a fresh spike of pain crescendoing and then settling back to the constant, fierce ache. Lucifer wonders idly how long he’d have to keep this up to drain Cas dry, make him numb to it all.
“Warning, warning. Please evacuate the mall. Warning, warning. An incident has occurred. Warning, warning. Please make your way towards the nearest exits.”
Because Lucifer isn’t stupid, Lucifer knew this would happen sooner or later. Which is why, when Cas was unconscious, he seared a binding sigil into their ribs.
He swallows down a flippant reference. This pop culture nonsense is incredibly annoying. Is this what it’s like in Dean’s head, he wonders - every serious response he gives picked out from a heap of glib comments. It’d explain a lot, to be fair.
“I know that, Cas, man. I’m fucking shit. This is what I do, I can’t deal with the bad stuff, I let it consume me, fuck me up so bad that I start doubting the good stuff, fight it back and push it away.”
Dean’s starting to get antsy by the time he finally appears – shooting face first out of a gigantic slide with a bemused expression on his face.
But Dean succeeds, eventually. A dark little corner, tucked up in the basement. The furniture in it just different enough to the uniform beds and cupboards and end tables and crap in the rest of the bunker that Dean doesn’t see his and Cas’s room every time he turns around.  It’s not great, kinda musty smelling, and the mattress is so full of dust that every time Dean sits down it exhales a great cloud of it, makes him cough and splutter.
He feels things now. Puffs of breath on the back of his neck, fingers massaging his slack flesh. It feels nice. There’s something else too, rumbling vibrations, music or words or something. That’s nice too.
There’s silence for a few seconds. A long, stretching, hideous few seconds in which even Crowley has the decency to look fazed. And then Sam claps his hands together – all stubborn business and okay that was a pretty big bombshell but it’s had its few minutes and now we’re going to rise above it.
And then Cas touches him on the shoulder. Just like that Dean's sanguine destructive attitude is gone, replaced by real, feral, rage.
He doesn’t have a real first aid kit, but he does have the makings of a saline solution within reach.
“Dean,” he says, all teeth and gums and outright shining glee. “Dean, I’ve got my wings back. I can fly.”
But he can’t say that – he won’t say that to Cas and end up ruining his goddamn life too – so he just says thanks. And yeah, it’s a fucking towel to mop up the ocean, but at least it’s a start. It’s something to the nothing he feels like he’s been giving Cas for so long.
Sure there’s detective work and critical thinking and brilliant leaps, but they’re never quite on a forensic level.
Neither does the feeling of Cas’s cock under his fingers as he gives it a few long, slow pulls, the little moans that Cas can’t hold in.
Okay, he probably wouldn’t, but that would ruin the great, big set piece. The one huge cruelty that all of these little ones are building up to. He’s been toying with Cas something awful, and not solely for his own amusement. The thing he’s found with grand tortures, is that you can’t just leap into them from a standing start. Your victim tends to just go boringly numb, waste all your effort. No, you have to warm them up, flex their despair a little bit so that when the final blow comes it isn’t too much, doesn’t shut them down entirely. You need to make sure they
“Do I think the mysterious tree shaped mark that has appeared on your back without either of us noticing, has some sort of connection to the nightmare forest that sucks you in and kills you on a regular basis?” Cas asks, because apparently he doesn’t think his
Sam watches them go, wondering when that started. When friendly touches turned into something else. His first reaction is a muted kind of joy, joy because he wants them to be happy, of course he does – his brother and his close friend. But his second is worry – because Cas is dying and he remembers the last time Cas died. He doesn’t want to watch that happen to Dean again, but inevitably even worse.
Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck. Sam is going to kill her. Then Cas, when he gets better, is going to kill her. Hannah will probably do the reviving in between, not quite caring enough to get her hands dirty but still pissed that she let Dean loose when actually she doesn’t want him away from Cas at all.
“You okay, buddy, you need to sit down?” He slings the shovel off his shoulder and plants it in the ground in front of Cas. “Lean on that, I’ll go get you a chair. Can’t have you sitting down in mud this deep, we’ll never get you out again.”
She tucks the little wing into her pocket and returns inside. She still has work to do, and it’s going to involve manual labour. Eugh.
He pictures Cas in jeans and a white shirt, stripping off slowly, tauntingly. First the tie, pulled loose around his neck, out from under the his collar but just left there as he unbuttons the shirt. Dean lets his hand drift to one of his nipples, tweaks it in time with Cas undoing each button, letting all that glorious tanned flesh out on show.
“Having a vessel is like having a shield. The minute he’s separated from that, the cage will reclaim him.”
HOW ARE YOU ALL, WHAT DID YOU GET UP TO WHILE I WAS AWAY, I hope you didn't think I wasn't coming back and jumped ship lol
It’s the first time someone has mentioned Cas’s name in a normal way since he vanished. Not asking where he was, or accusing him, or speculating about how he might be dead or wounded. Just talking about him normally, like he’ll be around next year and they’ll all be hanging out and laughing like all this bullshit never happened.
Cas never makes it to any of the other exhibits – he prowls through ten floors of animal caves, stroking his hands over the rock almost guiltily, loathe to wear away the stone and ruin the artwork, but desperate to touch, to feel, to understand.
“So, you got anyone watching and laughing from the stands?” Keith asks conversationally, as he selects a helmet from the rack for Cas.
“Not that it’ll make any difference to you, but I didn’t let Lucifer out, I can’t. Two angels in one vessel. It’s impossible.”
He starts to whisper an exorcism and the demon snarls. It squeezes his throat tighter, so that air can barely even escape it. Cas tries to bite down, make it let go. Doesn’t succeed.
And unlike before, it did so properly. Taking an occupied grace by force, that’s a vicious process. It damages both parties, and leaves both worse off in the long run.
Lucifer rocks his hips gently, kisses Dean and brings his hands up to Dean’s neck. A gentle grip, but one that gets Cas’s attention.
“And then he told me that he didn’t love me anymore.” Dean thought if he said it fast enough it’d be like ripping off a bandaid. It’s more like sliding another knife into the wound and wriggling it about a bit.
The flames die out to nothing before Sam can get near them, but he kicks the bowl over anyway for good measure. He’d salt and burn it too, if he didn’t think that’d compound the fucking problem.
He stays there for a while, shoulders trembling with rage or tears or Sam doesn’t fucking know what.
He pops his earphones out of his pocket, nestles the earbuds in and hits shuffle. Folsom Prison Blues starts up and he grits his teeth, mutters at Spotify to fuck off and skips ahead a track as he opens the door. He swears the goddamn app exists to troll him. Or Charlie’s been messing with the algorithms for a prank or something. Can she even do that? Probably. It’s is fucking Charlie.
“In the afternoon, yeah, you said that. And what, time is a construct and I haven’t been sleeping well” or at all “recently. I want a nap.”
The sword the creature is holding, a beautiful, monstrous thing – black metal folded through with red, a guard formed of a whole, twisted and gnarled horn, and a grip of dyed red leather and rope – falls to the ground and Dean snatches it up greedily.
There’s no rest for Castiel, no slumber. No quiet. He went into this hoping for some kind of peace. Not death, perhaps, but sleep. Just a chance to rest and not have to mull over what he’s done. A pause, where he didn’t have to deal with the consequences of his actions.
He realises that Sam is looking at him with a mixed expression, like he’s either about to hug him, or test him with silver.
‘Cause the anger is starting to simmer down now, and he knows what’s going to be waiting for him when it does. The misery, the shame, the self-hatred and the guilt.
Cahor leads them on a ragged chase – they arrive a few moments too late every time, don’t even see him. He’s moving faster than they can manage, and he will continue to. Angels don’t tire, unlike the all too human Charlie and Dean.
That puts a niggling suspicion in the back of Sam’s mind, but it takes him a good few miles to pin it down. Dean didn’t need to let him come along, didn’t need to insist that they drove in the same car. He must have known that he was trapping himself, that Sam would try and force him to talk.
“But, this is urgent!” He can’t quite believe that she’s forgotten – thinks she must just be trying to needle them.
Cas grunts in agreement. He knows, and he knows he’s not helping himself, but sometimes he just can’t summon the strength to care. Ennui and lethargy mangled together until he can barely summon the energy to talk, never-mind spend time tensing and untensing his muscles.
Dean doesn’t say anything, running over what Sam said in his head. Eventually he speaks, half tries to justify himself, and hates himself for it.
Dean helps Cas over to a corner a little out of the fray. There’s only one vampire left and Sam appears to have the fight relatively under control, so he’s not too worried about leaving him.
Dean decides there’s far too little of Cas’s flesh on show for his satisfaction, pulls him in for a filthy kiss, nipping and biting at his lip, as he helps him out of his overshirts. They have to break away to get his tee off, but now things are much more even.
“How the fuck should I know?” Dean snaps, eases back. “It’s my fault, I shoulda known he’d be sketchy around people. Should never have suggested it.”
It’s too much, far too much. He might have managed to use his grace, but not in a controlled way. More like reaching for a dart gun and finding you’ve fired an AK-47.
Sam tries to muster up something a little more incisive, gets stuck on one word swears. Not particularly big or clever, as his teachers used to constantly tell him, but they sum up pretty well what he’s feeling right now.
Okay, he’s not hungover. He’s just really fucking beaten up. Lovely. The last thing he remembers is sitting on the riverbank getting a call from Charlie. Stuff happened after that, but he’s fucked if he knows what.
By the state of the two bandages on his back, they aren’t being changed as often as they should. The right one is leaking a mix of blood and something that looks close enough to infected fluid that it sets her teeth on edge.
“Good, fuck. I’m glad. I really am sorry, I know I keep saying it, but I didn’t mean to upset or hurt you. You know that.”
He’s worked himself up into a right irritable froth by the time he finds Dean – in the kitchen, of course.
There’s a little swell of self disgust at the attempted justification, and he lets it rest there for a moment before dismissing it. He’s not trying to absolve himself, he hurt Cas and he knows it, but there’s a difference between doing it wilfully and what he did.
“That was just rude.” He tuts, as he sears a binding sigil into the flesh of her chest. “I came a long way to talk with you.”
“Forget about it.” Cas dismisses, determined not to linger on it. Lingering makes it worse. “What game are you putting on?”
He spends the day wallowing, ignoring increasingly fraught texts from Sam. He texts Eileen, informs her that yes, he is still alive, yes he is fine. He hopes Sam gets the hint.
Lucifer dismisses Dean’s doubt with an easy shrug, touches his shoulder. The pathetic bastard leans forward a little, like he wants to follow the touch.
This is the sort of shit you’re supposed to go through together, with your significant other as support, or a crutch, or fucking whatever. Instead he shoved Cas away and now not only does he not have his support, he has the pain and frustration of Cas not being around, too.
“Yeah, well, much as I enjoy bouncing up and down on his cock and vice versa, it’s been longer than I’d like since I got laid. Which you know, being in my fucking head and all.”
Blackish sap leaks and dribbles out onto the floor, and then stops. The wound glows red, self-cauterises.
“Dean?” Charlie tries to get his attention, suddenly aware that she’s only been having the latter half of this conversation with one Winchester brother. Dean’s staring vacantly at Cas, looks like he’s on another planet entirely. “Dean, what do you think?” She waves a hand in front of his face, and he snaps back.
Dean drops down to his knees, sizes up the thick, hard cock in front of him. He’s going to fucking enjoy this. Cas is packing some pretty serious heat, not that it’d be a deal breaker if he was on the smaller side or anything, but, damn, there’s just something Dean loves about a big, fat cock.
“The pie section, by any chance?” Charlie asks, as Dean abandons the trolley and walks off. He gives her the finger.
Lucifer drives the blade clean into the husband’s brain, turns to the wife with a wicked smile and slits her throat too.
Dean lashes out, the way he tends to do when struggling to reconcile uncomfortable truths. That’s fine, though. Lucifer has something in his arsenal for that. He digs deep into the pit of Castiel’s misery – deeper than he needs to, just to torture him a little more – lets a flash of it shine through and is rewarded with a wince from Dean.
That’s disappointingly cold. And if Lucifer wasn’t currently doing his best to convince Castiel that Dean is in fact hugely in love with him, it’d be a nice blow. But it’s not. Lucifer looks at Dean with this hurt little expression, like Dean just confirmed his worst fears, and Dean flinches, tries to roll it back.
Surprise is on his side, because Sam is an idiot, or really fucking distracted by something, and Dean grabs the offending, and pretty sharp, item out of Sam’s hand.
Dean’s order looks the plainest. A simple wooden tablet with three small, bowl glasses balanced on top. No gimmicks or elaborate displays, just three tasting glasses of whiskey.
Cas sits down at the table, waits until everyone else has joined him before spreading the folder out so Dean and Charlie can see. He doesn’t make allowances for Sam, sat opposite them and therefore looking at the contents upside down. He has an awful, sinking feeling that he knows what he’s going to find over the page, and what’s going to follow because of it. Any momentary advantage he has over Sam to school his thoughts, he’ll take.
“Look, I’ve read the fucking malnutrition advice backwards and forwards, I could probably recite it to you in my goddamn sleep. But you know what won’t help him get better? Healthy shit that he won’t eat. I figure one burger has gotta be better for him than having a bit of a lettuce leaf and half a yoghurt, right?”
“So, greenfingers, what’s the plan?” Dean asks Cas, surveying the tangled mess of flowers and brambles.
Maria is twenty minutes late to work. She rushes into the bakery, apologises with hasty insincerity and throws on her apron. She’s told that this is her final warning, and that if she gets one more strike she will be fired.
Of course, Dean knows that isn’t it. He’s just trying to distract himself from what he’s really thinking . That the two little shits in the back have discovered something new, and decided not to tell him. Another text, or some angel voodoo shit. Which, well, screw you guys.
So of course, one of the cops spots him, of course they decide to give pursuit while he’s one shoe on and one shoe off.
It’ll hurt the most if it’s perfect.  And besides, he wants this to last as long as possible – both for his and Cas’s sake.
“Don’t.” Charlie hisses. She’s spun enough of the little she knows of Cas’s actual story in that Dean would fucking flip if he heard. “This is against protocol and my partner’s a tightass. You’ll get me fired.”
How deep must those wounds have been that they’re still raw and healing. Jesus, fuck. Yeah, Cas’s body isn’t in the best of shape right now so that’s probably slowing things down, but still.
“But yeah, um. Your spell worked, kinda. I don’t know exactly what you were going for. Can kinda guess.”
Violence is always the answer, isn’t it, Dean? When everything is spiralling out of control and all you have left is your fists and your teeth.
Dean’s going to feel Cas’s pain as he scours Dean’s body clean, and in return Cas gets the hurt and the betrayal and the fear. And Dean’s shocked now, doesn’t quite know what’s going on. He will soon, though. He’ll work it out. And Cas doesn’t know if he’ll be able to take it.
Dean relaxes so quickly it’s comical, tucks his knife away. Lucifer marvels, for the hundredth thousandth time, that he isn’t dead. I mean, he’s just so
Dean doesn’t want to know what made this the real version of Cas – he shouldn’t know. There’s still enough left of the old version of himself to want to protect Dean from that.
Dean doesn’t voice this though, because it’s too much like a sincere emotion for this time, for this fucking situation.
“And if this is a trick? Something to throw us off track so we flounce around thinking Cas is safe, when really he’s tied up and being tortured somewhere?”
Cas gathers up every scrap of purgatory’s influence that he can find, the stuff locked into the flesh and marrow of Dean Winchester, and he doesn’t destroy it. He corrals it, converges it on Dean’s right forearm, towards the Mark of Cain.
They pull the ambush off without a hitch. The demon finishes her shift, walks out the back door and into the empty alleyway, where Dean is waiting.
But there’s only so long he can put this off by ruminating about Hannah’s motives, he’s gotta get on in there.
“We’re still alive, aren’t we?” Cas says in a strained voice, and that sets alarm bells ringing in Dean’s head. He sounds like he’s in pain and trying to hide it – and Dean hadn’t even considered that he might be injured. Thoughtless fucking bastard that he is.
Cas thought he was giving Dean a gift. He couldn’t have been more fucking wrong. He was giving him a sentence.
Cas ignores him, carries on talking. “I didn’t even need to hijack a cupid. He just tumbled and fell. Sacrilege must be in your genes – one abomination by blood, and one who threw himself into it for a pretty face.” His lip curls and he sneers. “As if I’d ever let Dean touch me.”
Which, kind of. It’s at a low buzz now, and maybe between Charlie and Dean a few relaxed hours is enough to lay it to rest until something else kicks it back up.
It’s been two weeks and a day since Dean last heard from Cas. And he doesn’t know that because he’s counting, it’s just he remembers because it was while they were doing the banshee case, and yeah. Look, Cas is his friend, he’s allowed to be worried for him.
It’s the cold that wakes Dean up. He opens one eye, and then the other, registers the distinct lack of human presence at his side and groans. Stupid Cas getting up in the night and taking his stupid body heat with him. He looks at the clock. Okay, stupid Cas getting up at 8am, but still. That might as well be night compared to his usual hour of rising.
“Okay, that was uncalled for.” Dean pouts, following Cas out of the room. He wants to offer his arm or some other kind of support, but Cas seems to be making speedy enough progress without him.
He doesn’t though, and he’s not sure why. Because Jack has already given him so much? Has given him everything – almost – that he asked for.
“I’m fucking – uh,” he grunts as Cas thrusts up aggressively, like the little shit he is, “I’m fucking — oh god – busy.” He hangs up and throws the phone against the wall, with a rough clatter.
Charlie laughs. “C’mon. We better get back to the kitchen before Dean chops everything in there in a fit of pique.
He finds a necklace, one that he recognises intimately, because he bought it. Rubbish and cheesy, a little two dimensional brass angel on a chain, wings and a gown and trumpet. He bought it for Cas as a joke. Didn’t expect Cas to stubbornly wear it every day, tucked up under his shirt.
Cas automatically gravitates towards Dean, forces himself to stand an acceptable distance away, to not touch or even look at him too long.
Cas gives Dean a moment to appreciate it, and then he crowds him, forces him to walk backwards to the bed and then pushes him down onto it.
Slowly, so Cas won’t realise what he’s doing, Dean reaches for the lube. He rolls it between his fingers for a little bit, warming it up, and then he pulls away.
“That’s a decent game, pretty buggy though, and it gets kinda samey after a while. Although there’s a funny glitch where you end up running around in just your underwear.”
He thinks he sees signs of a tussle or something, scuffed grass and turned up dirt. It could just have easily have been done by the fucking crowd hanging around though. He can’t take anything for granted. He has to be a hunter, has to look at all this objectively.
“I’m not saying you should. I’m just saying maybe we should start easing back into the day job, y’know, saving people. With this, and the vacation. How long’s it been since we put down a demon?”
He can’t even try and escape by burying himself in sins of the flesh, in Cas. That happiness, that complacency, that’s what got him into this mess in the first place. It happens every time. He lets his guard down, he lets himself enjoy something, and he’s punished for it. Cassie, Lisa and Ben, now Cas. He can’t fucking do this. Can’t let himself slow down and drop his guard. He has to be an island, because otherwise he ends up a fucking desert.
It’s his last thought, before Cas’s hand moves from the back of his neck to his forehead, and burns him to dust.
Cas nods blearily, shuffles down the corridor to the bedrooms. Dean’s is nearest the kitchen, and his own the furthest away.
Eventually Sam gets picked up – by a newish looking station wagon to Dean’s huge relief – sails off in the direction of Lebanon. Dean follows at a distance, unconsciously grinding his teeth. He tails them all the way into the town centre, where Sam barrels out of his vehicle and waves a hasty goodbye to the driver.
He throws himself after the shifter, hands outstretched, trying to get another grip and throttle that grin off its face. The shapeshifter reacts with startling speed – like it’s used to being attacked suddenly and from all sides.
This is more like the usual Cas. Barely restrained and hungry for as much of Dean as he can possibly get.
And Dean kisses him, terrified, hungry, not thinking at all. And then his brain comes back into line and he flinches away, panicked and guilty, searching Cas’s blank face for any sign of a reaction and finding none.
Sam grimaces, weighs the merits of buying a spray bottle. He could always fill it with holy water, pretend it was for demon hunting purposes.
“I volunteered to make lunch, I never said anything about cooking it.” She says at Sam’s rueful expression, handing him a plate piled high with sandwiches and potato chips.
Don’t think of it as a month with no update, think of it as a month to pause to gather yourself and get ready for OH MY GOD THE BIG REVEAL)
It doesn’t come, instead he finds himself flipped onto his front. He ruts into the bedsheet, desperate for some friction on his cock, but Cas pulls him up by his hips, so his ass is sticking in the air. He grunts into the pillow, half complaint, half anticipation. He doesn’t think he’s quite prepped enough, but he can’t quite bring himself to care. He trusts Cas, knows he wouldn’t do anything to hurt him – and he did rebuild this body once. He’s got to know it’s limits. If Cas thinks he’s ready, maybe he’s right.
He rips away from Cas, is on his feet before he knows it. He runs down the hall, dizzy and unstable. There’s something screaming in his ears, clutching at his brain and squeezing, compressing it down into almost nothing.
Cas shakes his head slowly. “Demons. I was passing through and noticed the unusual number gathered in the area.”
“It is.” Cas agrees. “But I was very, very upset, and very, very scared, and I let that get the better of me.”
“Is that why you’re so upset about the photo? Because it reminded you of what she was like when you were little? Helped you hold onto her as you remember her, not the sort of saintly revenge icon that Dad made her into?”
Their compassion is their undoing, as Lucifer lets out a long, high pitched whistle. One of the woman’s eyes explodes out of its socket with a bloody squelch, but the other carries on swivelling, fixes on the closest person.
“Nah, not yet. I need to indoctrinaterd sleeping beauties over there too. You and me, we’re gonna watch animals eat each other’s faces off while we have our sandwiches, and then we’re gonna buy the shit out of some groceries.”
“Yeah, well. We don’t have a lot of backup at the moment. Every angel on side is a winner.” Dean backpedals. Never let them see you care, even if it’s just whether they’re alive or dead.
And so they’ve come to this, Dean denying anything is wrong with him, while Sam gapes incredulously, and Cas tries very hard not to upset anyone more than they’re already upset. Himself included. Scratch walking on eggshells. This is donning a steak and catnip suit and going for a jog around the lion enclosure.
“No. If you weren’t suspicious of someone you’d just have dismissed it out of hand. I believe you when you say you aren’t suspicious of me, which leaves—”
“You think it’s easy,  knowing he died because some fucked up shit got hold of me and was trying to use me to destroy the world? You think it’s easy knowing that, and just in case I fucking forget, having the reminder fucking glowing on my arm?
Cas doesn’t so much wake up as drag himself back to consciousness, and he regrets bothering almost immediately. He feels like someone peeled his skin off while he slept, sprinkled his flesh with metal filings and then sewed it back on again. He rubs at his arm, half expecting to feel them poking through.
Dean obliges with a shrug, and Crowley reads the entire thing, from start to finish. He gets paler by the moment, and hell no, Dean does not like that.
In the gap between two songs – crossfade is for losers – she vaguely thinks she hears something. She pops one headphone off, listens for a moment. Nothing obvious, but she’s bored so what’s the harm in checking.
He grabs his bag, marches out the room almost too quick for Charlie to catch up. He’s halfway to the Impala before he realises that Charlie will have driven here too, probably has her own set of wheels.
“I promise, it was. A little torture is the best kind of foreplay. I wanted him weakened, pliable. Ready to return to me. I just gave him a few little nightmares to soften him up.”
Charlie nods. “Anyway, back to the point – the Men of Letters were very into the idea of gardening.”
“Cas!” He tries to hug him sloppily. Wants to kiss him, but even through his drunken stupor, doesn’t think that’s something he’s allowed to do at the moment.
There are cuts and gashes up his arm and fingers from trying to tear metal apart with his bare hands and he welcomes them. He clenches his fists tight and digs his nails into his palms.
“May I have a phone? It’s easier to focus through something, and he might recognise one of your phone numbers better than he recognises me.”
“Please, Rowena.” He sounds so fed up, so tired, so downtrodden, that she lets it drop. Not out of compassion though. She just knows not to keep flogging a dead angel, as it were.
He knows that voice. It’s familiar, achingly, hauntingly so. It always brings a mess of emotion welling up from the pits and valleys of his body. Love and fear and upset and distress. The body recognises him, the mind draws a blank. How can a voice that means nothing to one, mean so much to the other?
Cas stops dead, looks at him confused, and then takes a few steps backwards. For a second he looks hurt, and then he marshals his features into something neutral. Shit, now Dean feels like the worst kind of bastard. He just wants to grab Cas, tell him it’s okay. But he can’t. He fucking can’t.
“You know what, I’ll sort the rest of these by myself, thank you, Sam.” He turns to grab his clothes to leave and Sam grabs him by the shoulder to stop him.
“It’s that stolen grace, isn’t it?” Dean interrupts, and have his eyes always been that bloodshot, or is this something new?
“Yeah, okay.” Sam reaches over and turns the radio up. It’s set on some mediocre classic rock station, of course. He flicks the dial around, and for once, Dean lets him. A truce of some kind.
It pierces the shapeshifter’s calf, tumbles it. Before it can pull the weapon free and turn it on Dean, though, he’s on top of it. He pins it to the ground and takes the sword back, drags it in a heavy line across the creature’s back, drinking in the blood and the sweat and the screams of pain.
If he does die here, he’s coming back as the most vengeful of spirits. And it’s Dean’s ass that he is going to haunt.
Sam is playing his part beautifully, and it should be enough for Dean, to let him channel it and hold onto it and drag himself upright, but for once it just isn’t. Dean can’t sustain it. He’s not upset with Sam, he’s just trying to provoke him, say the worst things he can so that Sam’ll do the same back.
“How, exactly? We don’t have any class rings, we don’t have the spell to open the cage up again – and even if we did, what’re we gonna do, just shove Sammy back down in there?”
“What?” Crowley tries for incredulity. “I wasn’t the one who decided to glue my brain to someone else's without reading the warning label!”
“Obviously we’d have to start small, maybe with stress balls or something to tune up the strength in his hands.” He seems to have forgotten that Dean has spent half the night researching this, too lost in his eagerness to delve into his two favourite things, being a massive fucking nerd, and being a scary fitness freak. Dean shouldn’t have bothered with all this research, should have just dangled the idea in front of Sam and let him run with it. “You know what, we should reach out to Donna and Jody. I bet the police deal with stuff like this all the time. Not like, y’know, as bad as this. But still, recovering from injuries.”
“There’s only one car left in the entire bunker, and the keys are on the table. I thought you’d work it out!”
Hannah hears Dean’s prayer long before he puts it into formal words. It’s a tug, visceral, at the center of her being as he swings wildly between wanting her help and thinking she’ll be a hindrance. She ignores him for as long as she can. He wants her help finding Castiel. Well, it was only a matter of time before he said or did something that drove Castiel away. She’s not at his beck and call to help mediate lover’s tiffs.
Cas scoffs, and Dean reaches out a hand to touch him. It’s slow and deliberate, giving Cas all the goddamn time he needs to shy away or avoid it. Cas lets him, and it helps, god it helps.
He tries so hard to trust this, his present. His fucked up and broken but still reforming life. He wants to trust the gift he’s been given, stop desperately looking for the catch, the trick.
“I grew up in a very close, insular family. I guess to outsiders it probably looked like a cult, but it was all I knew. I was told we were righteous, that what we were doing was for the good of all mankind. And I accepted that, for the longest time, but then. Someone showed me that what we were planning was wrong, that it would hurt people. So I turned against my family. It wasn’t a clean break, there was a lot in between, but the reason I’m here now, well.
sit here and explain to you, with diagrams, my reasoning as to why I believe the combined power of yours and Cas’s stupidity is literally the strongest force on earth. Stonger than comas and stronger than true love. Stronger than the fucking gravitiatonal pull of the sun.
He tries again, notices the little dark patch where the trunk meets the roots. It’s the same splinter he noticed, the first time he and Dean slept together. Huh. Figures he should start there. He holds two fingers over it and concentrates.
“It’s not a matter of rules. It’s a matter of the fundamental fabric of hell. That is the way contracts work, in the same way that gravity works on earth, and nothing works in heaven.”
Dean grunts. There’s a big difference between looking for someone who’s out in the open, moving around and murdering people, and looking for someone who’s been kidnapped and held somewhere. One you look at the trail of bodies, the other you look in basements and hope bodies are the last thing you come across.
Fuck it, he turns heel, belts his way back to the bunker and throws himself into one of the old classics in the garage, a ’53 Hudson Hornet. She’s quiet as a whisper thanks to a bit of tinkering – Dean loves the Impala, but even he gets that sometimes you need something a bit more subtle – and a dark green colour. Dean knows he can count on her, too. He’s been working his way through all the motors stashed here and fixing them up when he has some downtime, needs a little stress relief. There’s nothing quite like burying your hands in the guts of an old car, it’s like a form of mediation, getting up to your elbows in something old and built with care.
He’s so far gone down the 13-year-old girl route that he knows there’s no turning back now. Colour him pathetic. Also colour him too enamoured to goddamn care.
Cas snaps, recoils and berates himself as he feels anger tinge Lucifer’s thoughts. The devil doesn’t like being screamed at, and it drives him to a further small cruelty. As if he needed much provoking in the first place.
“What about if I flipped the Mark to someone else and then killed myself in a way that doesn’t fit the ritual?” Dean asks.
Cas, who’d follow him to the ends of the world if asked, probably if not asked, probably if specifically told to fuck off as well. And even despite that, for a brief moment Cas hadn’t seen another way out, and he’d given up.
Which is all very well, but he’s got to get out of here first, and he might have a kernel of another plan forming, but that doesn’t mean he’s capable of getting up off the fucking floor to enact it right now.
He tries them all on and is satisfied with the fit for everything apart from Dean’s monstrous shirt. It’s too small, pinches under his armpits. He reluctantly tells Dean as much when he shuffles out, is met with mock disappointment.
He stumbles across the threshold. It looks like what it is, a bombsite. He falls to his knees by the chunks of what used to be the dresser. All his photographs had been piled on top of it, out of the way of the wet, painted sigils.
“SHUT UP!” Dean slams his hands against the table, like he thinks he cuts an intimidating figure. And then he seems to fold in on himself. “Jus’ – just tell me what you did to Cas.” He slurs out, softly this time. Uncertainly.
Cas sits down heavily on the edge of the pool, legs dangling free. Sam’s head is level with his knees.
“If he thinks I’m crawling under whatever very heavy thing you two idiots are decidedly failing to move, he’s even more stupid than I thought.” Cas grumbles.
They haul her out of the trunk, dump her in the middle of a devil’s trap that Cas painted while Dean kept watch on the demon as she worked her shift.
Cas seems to take the hint though, and he slows down. The closer they get to the bunker, the more he keeps glancing at Dean. Quick little glances, like he thinks Dean won’t notice.
Except Cas flinches. Cas flinches away from Dean, because of Dean, and it’s like every fucking cold shower he’s ever had crashing down on him at once and extinguishing everything but cold, dirty shame.
“Caroline already knows my true name, and transporting her body back the human way would take hours of time that neither of us have. Especially if this is going to be a regular occurrence.”
Dean doesn’t say anything, but Cas knows him, doesn’t need him to vocalize to understand what he’s feeling.
“Anyway, Mary was found dead in front of a mirror with a name scrawled on it in blood. Only thing was, she was cremated which usually spells sayonara for the restless dead, but all the mirrors in the case got us thinking – what if her spirit got trapped in the one she died in.
“Jesus, Cas.” Dean taps him on the cheek, some choking, hot feeling bubbling up in his chest. “You should be a poet.”
“Oh great.” Sam snaps. “Now I’ve got two fucking angry children who break stuff instead of talking about their feelings.”
He said that, to someone, long ago. It’s still relevant, though. He’s not sure nowadays if he’s complimenting or insulting himself. A little of column A, a little of column B perhaps. Or maybe it’s irrelevant. Species can skew you in one direction or another. It doesn’t have to create you. Look at Hannah and Balthazar, Anna and Metatron, Hael and Raphael. Look at Cas himself.
“Uh because they’re two totally different types of meat for two totally different meals for your fat ass.”
Dean only realises there’s smoke coming from the pan he’s been browning onions in when someone gently takes his hand away from the handle, moves it off the gas.
If he ever sees Sam again, for real, it’ll be on a hunter’s pyre. Sam would be killed mercifully, he did his part. Some of it, at least. He said yes to Lucifer, he let the devil in. Okay, then he flung him back into his cage, but that’s better than the alternative, considering the circumstances.
Cas locks up, and for a moment Dean thinks he’s come, is a little disappointed that he’s not going to get to feel that around his cock. Then Cas cants his ass up, trying to get Dean’s finger in deeper, and he sees his cock, still hanging thick and hard between his legs.
“Nah. The camera thing is set to run on auto, any hint of him and we’ll know. For now I think it’s just preparing for the big showdown – we’re running high and dry on weapons, and your trap sheet is in pieces.”
Dean sleeps through the night and then some. And it has nothing, absolutely nothing, to do with the almost restored angel sleeping beside him and using his powers for good. Nothing.
“No.” Cas flicks a glare at him. “All you had to do was forcibly tear me and my stolen grace asunder, leave me dormant and possibly unreachable in a human body, and wait, on the one thousand to one chance that when the grace had recovered, it would bind itself to my consciousness
Dean finishes exploring Cas’s chest, decides that yeah, making out all nice and gentle is alright, but there are much more exciting things they can be doing right now.
Sam frowns at Dean’s tone, trying to parse which side of annoyed or worried he’s currently falling on. Mind, he can’t be too bad if he’s making pancakes and not y’know, hurling himself across state lines on Cas’s trail.
He eases off Cas’s shoes first, which earns him a soft kick and a mumble. After that he tries to divest him of his jeans, but Cas swats at his hand, irritably.
me, used me to kill Cain and then gave the Blade to Castiel here, I activated the spell. Fed a little magic into the splinter of purgatory bark I had one of his conquests dig in his back. Nothing serious, and nothing that could harm a human too much. Just enough to give him nightmares, break him down a little, make him long for the carefree days of the Deanmon.”
He flails his unharmed hand, meets a glass of some kind and grasps it, brings it to his mouth and chugs it down. Not water. Something. Lemon-lime. Ah yes, that’s familiar. Gatorade, the universally acknowledged hangover cure for those who don’t have access to serious medical supplies.
Fortunately, or not, he doesn't have to wait too long before the forest provides him with that he wants. It takes the form of a faint movement in the bushes. He flings himself forward, buries his hands in the foliage. His fingers enclose around a thin neck. It feels human, but he doesn’t believe it, or he doesn’t care. If it is a human, it isn’t Sam or Cas or someone he knows. It's not even
He expects Cas to follow him out of the room, but he doesn’t. By the time Dean comes back with the charger, Cas is engrossed in discussion with a female hunter. She’s maybe a few years older than Dean, and she’s very attractive. Would have been exactly Dean’s type, if he wasn’t already, y’know. Cas wanders off to plug in his phone and Dean is left alone with her.
“I bought enough to cook for the next few weeks too, figure we can just chill a while, not look for cases and just have a break, yeah?”
He yanks down Dean’s zipper, frees his cock. It’s semi-hard, enough that it doesn’t take Cas more than a few strokes to bring it back into the party. Dean lets out a little sigh, of relief, of pleasure, and Cas has to shush him quickly.
Dean draws his knees up so he’s sitting cross-legged, taps the blade against his leg and then drops it into his lap. His hands curls themselves into fists, nails dug tight. Anything to stop him reaching over and punching Cas square in the face – oh, it wouldn’t hurt him, of course, but it’d feel so fucking satisfying.
“Excellent. Do you mind if I snag the laptop – you probably need a break anyway, right? I can see you rolling your shoulders like you’ve been sitting there hunched for too long. And you’ve got like a hundred tabs open.”
“What do you do when you have to dig up a body in winter?” Charlie asks. “I mean, it’s spring now and the ground is still pretty hard. How the fuck do you do this in January?”
Cas wishes he’d fucking listened to Sam. ‘Cause it turns out that the one thing worse than calling Dean Winchester and getting a reply, hearing the hurt in his voice, is calling Dean Winchester and getting voice mail.
“You know what, tomorrow you can have fucking Bran-flakes, see if I care.” Dean scoffs, pulling out his phone to play solitaire and determinedly ignore the two fucking children sniggering together at the table.
Everything not completely beyond ruin is saved. There’s no way of telling which routes Dean’s sentimentality will traipse down when he’s calmer. They don’t want to accidentally throw away the one thing he’s going to, for reasons known probably not even to himself, pine after.
Less edited than I would have liked because I was being observed all day at work because I'm having computer issues and they were trying to work out what it was. It's very hard to write when someone is literally standing over you constantly asking you what you're doing and why. (The problem was that I was literally working too fast for the machine to handle, hahaha, which is a great excuse to slack off now and forevermore).
“Plenty of time for that later.” Cas says, far more composed right now than he should be. Dean puts a stop to that, shoves his hand down his pants and jacks Cas furiously while he bites at his neck, his collarbone. Cas’s head falls back against the stone as Dean works him quick and rough. He likes it best like this, when Dean works his cock desperately, like all his control is gone and he just needs to be touching Cas.
“Come on man,” Dean turns his full attention back to Cas, taking the silence as some kind of challenge. “You must have some idea – are we getting you more pyjamas and loungey things, or are you sick to the back teeth of elastic waistbands?”
Sam misinterprets his expression, thinks he sees anxiousness and doubt, where there’s just fucking dead, cold, certainty.
Cas groans, and Dean understands it for the invitation it is, grips him tighter and his hands slide around Cas’s back and under his shirt and onto bare skin. And Cas isn’t thinking, caught up, lost in the moment as he feels Dean’s hands moving up his back in a gentle caress, stepping from smooth skin to plastic.
Rowena reaches inside one of her pockets and pulls out a vial. Crowley’s blood. The door is spelled to recognise her and deny entry, unless it senses Crowley with her. Really, she thinks, he’s so paranoid, but his security systems are so basic. Especially seeing as the person he thinks he’s defending against is the one who taught him magic in the first place.
Luckily for Cas he’s been living in this skin for a long time, when the shock of the spell ripped him out of his ill-fitting grace, he had somewhere else to turn to. This body recognised him, allowed him to rest, dormant, in its flesh and muscle.
“Guard Crowley.” Cas says. “Make sure he doesn’t escape. If he does, we’re all dead, and…” He trails off.
“Sam.” He pleads, as he’s handed his bowl. Another watery soup, even less appetising than the last. “Please, I need it. It hurts.”
Cas’s voice doesn’t wobble, even if the rest of him is trying to collapse in on itself. His hands are trembling and his back is throbbing. Memories keep trying to force themselves over the present, the cold itch of a wet floor, the smell of damp and blood, the pain, the pain, the—
He gives Cas the first and second pancake. Tries to give him the third as well, even though he’s barely halfway through his first. Dude needs to get the meat back on his bones, and Dean can’t think of a better way than pancakes and bacon.
Dean hasn’t put it together quite yet. He doesn’t have all the information, was too busy fistfighting his own guilt down to a manageable level to go and look at the place it’d be strongest, the place Cas nearly fucking died.
Dean whips his head around, catches Cas’s eye. For a brief second he doesn’t recognise him, and then he does.
They master the art of origami cowboy hats, envelopes and guns before Cas gets too tired to continue.
Dean lets go and Cas’s hands immediately find their way to Dean’s ass, pinching and kneading at the flesh there. He skates one finger over his rim and Dean sighs happily.
“It’ll give me an excuse to get outside, stretch my legs. And you can watch and be hugely impressed, of course.”
Dean’s mouth is full of copper, and he realises that he’s not standing up. When did that happen? He coughs and there’s more blood. Always blood. It’s coated his hands for longer than he can remember and now it’s worked its way up to his throat and mouth too. It’s a fitting way to go, he thinks grudgingly, drowning in all that blood that he’s spilled.
Dean lowers the gun, drops to his knees and pulls in a huge breath, and then another and another in quick succession and he knows he’s hyperventilating, and he can’t fucking breathe, but it doesn’t matter, because they’ve done it. They’ve fucking done it, they’ve got the son of a bitch and this is finally,
And true, neither of the two angels actually need lungs to survive, but Cas is knitted into this body in an abnormal fashion. It’s been more than a vessel to him for a long time and as it suffers now, because of Lucifer’s meddling, so does he.
The flamethrower ignites, triggered by the opening of the door. It spews out a thick column of holy fire straight into Tahariel’s chest. He screams, inhuman, the same shattered glass scream that greeted Dean when he pulled himself out of his grave.
He pops the button of Cas’s slacks, pulls them halfway down his leg. They get stuck at the knees, because the unhelpful fucker won’t lift up and help Dean, god forbid, but they’re out of the way enough for Dean to get his hands on the goods, as it were.
He waits for that first pleasurable burn, as Cas slowly pushes his cock in and waits for Dean to adjust. Instead he feels Cas grab his ass with both hands, squeezing and kneading with deft fingers. Which is nice, really fucking nice, but it’s still not friction or pressure, and Dean’s getting desperate now. Enough teasing, enough playing.
He starts laughing, misses the significant look that Charlie throws Sam, even misses Cas coming up to him until he’s right there, awkward little smile on his face as he brings a hand up to Dean’s face, wipes away the tears that can’t be anything but joy.
“My bad, my bad.” He holds his hands up to ward off any oncoming attack, but finds none. “So, start off with the one furthest away – warm ourselves up for the big one?”
“The first time it was cast this way was in Iran, and it was used to bring someone back from the dead.”
Dean was a bit nervous about that – the first time Cas dropped the ball he’d braced himself for some sort of angry self-hatred spiral,
Sam thinks it’s about half tease, half sincere. He can work with that, settles his large hands over her broad hips and growls, “let’s get out of here,” into her ear.
Fury build and builds in him. The Mark registers on his arm, a weak pulse that tells him to turn around, tear apart the nearest living thing with his hands. He ignores it, instead grabs a corner of the broken bedframe, hefts it up and swings it against the wall, screaming as he does so. Plaster crumbles to the floor and Sam and Cas watch, impotently from the door. He thinks they might be saying something to him, but he can’t hear it, not over the ringing in his ears.
Dean holds up a shaky, blessedly restraint free hand. He's just regained consciousness and he's beat to shit, he's gonna need a few seconds to understand what she’s saying, a lot longer to come up with an answer.
“No.” Cas agrees, but he doesn’t actually do anything. They’re both tired, and he aches all over. He can wait. Probably.
Lucifer clicks his fingers and the demon’s throat starts to constrict. She croaks her apology hastily, and Lucifer lets her go, teleports away.
“So, tree hugger. We’ve established you like communing with nature, but have you got an opinion on gardening?” Dean asks, so casually that if Cas was paying attention he’d know there was an angle there.
“And there I was thinking you sensed I was in danger and came running to rescue me from the flames.”
Cas lifts his hand up, touches the wound. Slight, but there. He can feel his grace sparking and fizzing under his fingertips.
Cas begs, because it’s all he can do. He’s trapped in a literal hell of his own making, while the devil baits and taunts him and tries to turn the people he loves against each other. And it’s all his fault. But it’ll be worth it, whatever havoc Lucifer manages to wreak, because Amara must be stopped. It’s going to be worth it.
“You can’t fucking do this, Dean. You don’t want me to throw my life away? Yeah, well I’m not letting you do the same.”
He summons up just the right amount of bitterness, lays out the big reveal – if Sam isn’t Lucifer then you must think I am. He can tell the moment Dean realises what he’s implying. The puzzled look is replaced by one of outright horror and disbelief, and wow, interesting. He thought he might have to do some convincing, hop in and out of a devil’s trap or something. He can tell by Dean’s expression that this isn’t going to be necessary.
“None of your fucking business.” He shoots back, dusts his hands off on his jeans and avoids her gaze.
He spends the night watching Dean sleep – the flutter of his eyelashes, the slight frown in reaction to whatever he’s dreaming about. He listens to his heartbeat, the slow raspy breaths that graduate into rattling snores as he rolls onto his back.
Did Lucifer says throw him a bone? He meant add another little frisson of panic to the overall emotional shitstorm.
“Yeah, of course.” But he trails off there, head too full of big, personal, apocalyptic things to dredge up any small talk or casual conversation. He’s stuck on that last thought, loop of fucking hell Winchester, Cas is supposed to be the one who needs looking after, soothing. You’re supposed to be making sure he’s okay, not using him to straighten out the fucked-up tangles in your own snarling brain.
He clenches around Cas’s cock and mumbles something that sounds more like “aye dove glue” than “I love you”, muffled as it is. Cas chooses to take it as the latter, context and all that. Those words, that thought, combined with the squeezing pressure around his cock, are enough, finally, to throw him over the edge. He comes, hard, and collapses over Dean with a satisfied sigh.
Ash laughs at him, steers him over to the mountain bike section and hmms contemplatively as she tries to find one big enough for his “abnormally large frame”.
She eases herself off the bed, tiptoes to Dean and Cas’s room. Cas is standing at the door with his back to her. He turns, too quickly for her to hide.
If he runs, Cas and Sam will follow. He’s not dumb, he knows that. Sam didn’t find him before, but that was with Cas dying and not really able to help. He wouldn’t even make it out the door without a tail this time – Cas doesn’t sleep and has such a psychic sense for where Dean is in the bunker that he’s almost fucking sure he’s been chipped on the sly.
“Actually we threw them both in a hell-cage and left them to beat each other up for the rest of eternity.”
“This is the most out of place I have ever felt in my life.” Sam looks around. “And I went from motel rooms to Stanford.”
“Dean?” Cas asks desperately. He can feel the physical presence of Dean in his head, a nagging, tingling buzz at the edge of his skull. That’s all he’s got, though. There’s nothing personal about it. Nothing Dean.
It’d make sense for Dean to regret staying, it’d make sense for him to think that what used to be difficult but worth it, is still difficult but no longer worth it. That the future he’s clinging to, the thing that gets him through the day, where it’s him and Cas and everything is easier again, is receding further and further away with every day. Is an illusion, a dead fucking memory.
He smells like other things too, things Dean wouldn’t even be able to mumble. Things he’s never, ever going to be capable of saying out loud. Things like home.
“Excellent.” He decides he’s had enough of tormenting Dean for the moment. “So, I believe you had a reason for calling me here. Not another apocalypse, I hope.”
But, well, that’s kind of irrelevant now. It was only a kiss on the cheek, but it’s the confirmation Cas has been grasping for. Dean isn’t a casual, platonic kiss on the cheek kind of guy. And even if he’d suddenly turned into one, he wouldn’t do it just to Cas. He’d have done it to Sam too.
Sam and Dean slip through the entrance together, to a thin corridor. The walls are painted red and there’s a base smell that Dean thinks he recognises.
He stretches out both of his legs gently, careful not to put too much strain on them. He’s tired and wants to sit down, but he knows when he does the knifelike pins and needles will come back in full force. They seem to calm down a bit when he’s moving, but he knows that’s just hoarding extra pain for later. It’s always worse when he stops – like it saves itself up – and, in this state especially, he always has to stop, sooner rather than later.
He cleans Cas slowly and carefully, wincing at each new clotted mess of blood and dirt he cleans away to reveal a half-healed wound. It’s a miracle Cas hasn’t died of gangrene, or infection.
Dean crowds Cas, spittle flying right up in his face, waiting for him to falter or flinch, show any sign of weakness. He doesn’t. Dean roars his frustration again, one hand finding its way to the Mark, rubbing at it frantically. It’s still glowing, but more faintly now, not quite enough to illuminate the room.
“Things have never been easy.” Dean says, “But that was okay. It’s been worth it. I just, I just want things to get back to fucking normal already—”
Cas grabs hold of his ass, kneads the flesh for a little bit and then pulls Dean’s cheeks apart, thrusts his tongue in. He licks over and over his rim, teasing, gentle at first and then getting firmer until finally he points his tongue and pushes the tip inside. Dean groans and rolls his hips down, trying to chase Cas’s tongue, get it in there, deeper, harder.
He catches Dean’s eye as he hollows his cheeks and inhales deeply. Dean’s mouth goes a little dry at the sight. He’s a gross, perpetually horny human being, it’s not his fault. Kinda.
Dean wishes it wasn’t him. That Sam or Charlie had come instead. He looks like himself again, his new self, tired and drawn and scrawny, but Dean still almost can’t bear to look at him. It summons up guilt, thick, choking, horrified guilt.
He only wishes Sam was here, sat on the armchair and looking up over his book in pretend disapproval, or ragging Dean alongside the other two bastards. But it’s fine. He’ll be back soon, once he’s straightened out his head and he’s back on board with them.
"A sacrifice was made for you, Dean. It came with consequences. What you chose to do with that is up to you."
And Charlie, well, of course he trusts Charlie. She was the first person to arrive. He’d told her by text. Cowardly, yeah, but after Claire and Jody, he couldn’t face anyone else. She appeared on the doorstep a couple of hours later, eyes still a little red rimmed, but fiercely determined and stoic.
“We get him somewhere safe, call Hannah and get the fucking heroin,” Dean stumbles over the word, “angel purged from his system, and then we hunt down whatever son of a bitch did this to him.”
“Prove it.” He rasps, blade held shakily up. He’s blinking heavy and slow, eyes forced wide and teeth bared.
“They’ll try and stop me. Well, Sam and Dean will. I don’t think you or Crowley would be too upset.”
Sam curses, runs up behind her, like he’s trying to make enough noise to wake up everyone in the bunker. She shushes him impatiently.
He’s been doing research. Not enough for the others to notice, but just about enough to understand how the wards the Men of Letters left behind work. They’re intricate, beautiful, if you’re into that sort of thing. Dean’s been adding to them. Nothing extravagant, nothing like the original standard. Just every time the fear overtakes him, every time Cas has another attack, he sneaks down here and carves something into the floor or ceiling. It’s nothing earth-shatteringly clever – if the goddamn angel gets past the chains and the holy fire like fuck a few scratches on the walls are gonna stop him – but it will buy them time. Slow him down and make it more likely he’s gonna get discovered.
He stays there a moment to get his breath back, cleans himself off and wipes down the mess he’s left on the wall. He even sprays a few pumps of deodorant to cover up any lingering smells, ‘cause he’s a goddamn treasure of a roommate.
“She did for you.” And okay, that’s a teeny little misrepresentation of the truth, but it’s for the greater good.
“Yeah, well. I was in the middle of’n apocalypse las’ time, had to keep myself in fightin’ shape. This time I can drink myself to catatonia when’ver I fuckin’ want.”
“Yeah, actually.” He surprises Sam, who’d expected caginess and evasion. “Thought I’d try and help Cas for once instead of fucking him over.”
“A distraction. You make them think you’re unpicking the spell; that there’s nothing they can do and all we need is time. Just something to stop them running off. I have some things I need to tie up.
words. They’re stoppered in his throat and he can’t find the effort to force them out. He’s suddenly exhausted, glad he’s sitting down or he might have ended up sinking to the floor.
And then the coffeemaker finishes burbling, and he lets go, steps to the side to pour his stupid drink.
“No, he doesn’t; he’s made that clear. And it’s fine. I get it. I’m not sticking around to ruin his life some more. I’m gonna hit the road, do some low key hunting jobs and clear my head.”
No. He can’t let this fall apart now, he has to keep going, keep up the impression of tenderness. Lucifer marshals all of his willpower, uses it to hold himself in place until Dean is finally ready. He could speed it up with his grace, but that’s not the point. The point is to draw it out.
“Because then he’ll be in heaven, and neither you nor Hannah want that, I get it. But it still can’t hurt for me to know.”
Dean laughs. “Back it is. You wanna carry on looking without us, Hermione, or are we all done for the day?”
Cas curls in on himself, ignoring the dull ache in his back, as he wonders whether Dean will ever touch him again.
“I don’t think so.” He says, with what he thinks is the appropriate amount of wariness for someone who’s just been asked that question. From Dean’s answering expression, he gathers that amount is murder level suspicious. “What are you panning?”
And god, does it feel good to get it off his chest, even if it’s to such literal silence that he has to ask Hannah several times if she’s still on the line.
He doesn’t look like he’s been tearing apart the earth trying to bring Cas back, or throwing himself into an attempt to commit suicide by hunting. He just looks tired.
Cas laughs, rolls onto his side and wriggles until Dean settles against him. It takes a while to find a place where he can comfortably settle his hands without knocking some bruise or other, but eventually they manage it. Cas gives a pleased little hum, drifts right off.
And maybe without Dean pushing him, he wouldn’t have tried to seal up heaven, lost his wings and become angel enemy number one.
It’s like trying to fight his way through a thorn bush, the harder he pushes, the more it hurts. It doesn’t even seem to end, either. The further in he tunnels, the thicker and darker it gets. There’s no sign of light, or life. No sign of anything that isn’t darkness and thorns.
“I’m just better than you.” Sam says, because he knows Cas, and stoking his viciously competitive streak is the best way to engage him in anything.
for, Cain’s bitter words clanging through his head.  But he didn’t have a choice with that – he could hardly leave the First Blade with Crowley. What he did have a choice about was inviting – begging – Cas to share his bed, no matter how chastely. Doing this is putting his fucking unrequited love affair ahead of the person he’s been harbouring it for.
Cas sighs. All these conversations he hoped he’d never have to have again. There isn’t a rug in the universe big enough to sweep them all under, but this one he at least expected to stay put.
“So.” Rowena purrs, as Crowley frowns sceptically at Dean. “Explain to me exactly how you two got yourselves into this situation.”
“You know, having me in your vessel has probably had a dampening effect on your ability to listen to prayers – my channel is pretty busy. How’s about I shut it off for a bit and we have a listen, see who’s calling out for you?”
“What?” Cas asks, with a vague feeling of trepidation. If Dean’s changed his mind and is about to bolt, he isn’t sure he has the energy to stop him.
Cas nods, and Dean looks back at him with a slightly wild expression, and then fixes on the ground, like this is something he can’t say while making direct eye contact.
He actually, and he’s not sure what to do about it, but he actually feels some fragile kind of hope that things might work out, might even continue getting better. It’s probably just a good week, he knows these things pitch forward and fall back, that it won’t be a smooth progression. But it does feels like a progression.
He’s never seen them before, not from this perspective. From heaven fireworks look almost tedious. From earth they are beautiful.
“You’re being very understanding.” He says, and he can hear the barest hint of confused lilt in his own voice – like he’s asking Dean why. He doesn’t just mean now, though, about this new fear of crowds. He means about the silences, and the moods, and the withdrawal and the inability to behave like he used to, to snap back into being the person he used to be.
Dean firms his grip in Cas’s hair, shakes his head from side to side playfully. Cas scowls up at him, presses his head heavily down into Dean’s crotch, makes him yelp.
Nothing. Sam’s starting to get worried now. Angelic possession isn’t always a smooth experience, and Dean isn’t Cas’s natural vessel. Maybe something went wrong, maybe he accidentally fried Dean’s brain in the process. Wouldn’t be the first time he fucked something up with good intentions, and Sam hates himself for thinking that, but there it is.
In the memory Lucifer stops playing with the blade, scores three quick lines into Sam’s cheek. A capital ‘A’.
Dean finishes the sigil, flexes his hand a couple of times and idly watches the wound to see if the flesh knits back together. It stops bleeding quicker than it ought to, but other than that it seems to be normal. He’s got a little while, it seems.
He leaves while Charlie’s in the shower, doesn’t even bother with a dive bar this time. He cuts out the middle fucker and buys two bottles of illegal absinthe from under the counter of a sketchy looking liquor store. The guy hands it over and he squints suspiciously at the Mexican label, opens one up and sniffs. It smells like liquorice and it’s making his eyes water just being near it. Excellent.
Sam wakes up groggy and confused. It’s not unusual for him to come to consciousness tied to a chair though, so he takes it in his stride. He pulls in a few deep breaths, rolls his shoulders and checks the ties that bind his ankles and wrists together.
“This does not look like a frog.” Cas complains. It is not his first complaint in the last short while. It is also not his fifteenth complaint.
“I’d like to stay for tomorrow’s lesson, if that doesn’t interrupt our plans? I still haven’t had a chance to
It’s unwarranted, really. It’s not that Sam hasn’t been sleeping, it’s that the sudden urge to get home grabbed him by the balls and he drove all night to capitalise on it, worried that if he stopped he’d lose momentum and drift off again.
“And what happens if it subdues the Mark completely? Spears through it and negates all of the consequences the Mark brings – good or bad.”
Cas peers up at him from over his steaming mug. He doesn’t look ready to learn. Barely looks ready to be a multicellular organism.
He’ll just answer these questions, dose himself up to the hilt with ibuprofen and then sit very still and hope it all fucking goes away.
“Yes. I figured that. Care to elaborate?” He thinks he sounds remarkably calm, all things considered.
It sounds so stupid, but for a few seconds there he’d forgotten about all of the bullshit. Thought that things were still normal, still okay.
He pretends to draw himself up, puts back on the blank, implacable angelic mask that he knows will throw Dean into a tizzy.
In the bunker he might have found this protectiveness cloying. Out here he welcomes it. The shop is quiet and empty – early morning on a weekday – but he still feels nerves roiling in his stomach. Anyone could be here, approach him. Do anything. He’d be too weak to stop it, too weak to escape.
And then Sam spots the phone against his ear, swears, pats himself down to confirm that yes, the little fucking shit pickpocketed his fucking phone. He dashes over, dropping Cas’s clean sweats, kneels on the floor in front of him and checks his eyes. Glassy, but not with drugs. He’s not sure whether that’s a relief or not.
Cas wants to be left alone, he doesn’t like loud noises, and Dean’s right fist has done enough damage for today.
It takes them a couple of days to get the pool ready. Sam and Charlie clean it out – both relieved that the pool appears to have been drained when the bunker was abandoned – or perhaps was never filled. Either way, dust is a lot easier to clean away than years of stagnant water.
“It’s down to you to say the final words.” She says it apologetically, like she doesn’t want to ask him about as much as he doesn’t want to be asked. He doesn’t know what to say, and it isn’t his place to say the last words over Cas’s body.
“Sacrifice is a broad term, you can sacrifice your future, you can sacrifice your hopes, or a limb even.” Rowena purrs. “In this case, however, the meaning of sacrifice is achingly specific. There needs to be a death to open the portal. If Dean is going to survive this, live on as the portal and suffer eternally, then who is the blood sacrifice – who’s life will the spell claim to kick-start the final phase, when it’s knit through Dean’s veins entirely, settled in and ready to pull him apart?”
Charlie looks like the goddess Hylia has just descended from on high to bless her with, uh, idk, nerd shit. See, Dean pays attention. Sometimes (kinda).
“I put him in the recovery position,” Charlie says, and it takes a while to realise she isn’t talking about him. She’s talking about the other raging fucking mess in the bunker. “He’s sleeping it off.”
He knows that he had a name once. He thinks it’s probably something important, something that should be remembered. The more he strains after it, though, the looser he feels. Better to concentrate on holding himself together for now. When his memories come back, he’ll need some kind of frame to hang them on. A scattered multitude of freewheeling molecules wouldn’t have much use for a name or a history. He supposes that they’ve already had and lost more of those than he can comprehend – what’s one more to the pile?
He’s not very good at saying sorry with words. It never comes out right, his tongue gets heavy and thick, his throat dry and scratchy. He can say sorry with his hands, though. He can brush Cas’s hair from his face, trail his fingers across the rough stubble of his cheek, settle his clothes across his body more comfortably, draw up the blankets around him.
The Absinthe Frappe comes in a fancy, cut crystal looking glass that Dean jokes Sam shouldn’t pick up in case he crushes it in his huge, monster paws. The drink itself is faintly green tinged and full of ice with a bunch of mint poking out the top. It looks like there’s about two mouthfuls of it, but Sam supposes with absinthe that’s probably wise.
“How do you know he doesn’t feel the same way? I’ve had enough distressed texts from Sam that I know he’s as much of a gross horndog as you are. Possibly worse.”
Cas squirrels his grace away, in little pockets and fragments, dormant but ready. It doesn’t have to be gone entirely, just disguised enough to get what he wants.
The woman behind the counter frowns quizzically at the photobooth. The guy in it appears to be kneeling down now. She doesn’t think she saw anyone go in with him, no matter much how his feet sticking out under the curtain make it look like he’s giving a not very subtle blowie or something. She’d go over and investigate, only she isn’t paid enough to care and the manager treats her like shit. If someone gets jizz on the curtain it’s not her problem.
“Well what the fuck do you suggest we do? ‘Cause Cas was right, sitting here and waiting was doing shit all to help the situation."
Sam flinches, like Cas has lashed out at him. Cas knows he’s being unkind, unnecessarily harsh, but he can’t bring himself to care. He wants whiskey, he wants vodka, he wants sleep, he wants to crawl into bed with Dean and never crawl out again.
The fifteenth time he wakes up his brain resists going back to sleep, bouncing all of this around in his head until, with a sigh, he rolls over onto his other side, to face Dean.
Eventually someone comes to put him out of his misery. Rowena, he can tell by the clicking of her heels, the just-shy-of-pain niggling in his back teeth. Magic, or just age old dread, he’s never quite sure what causes it, but it kicks up whenever she gets within a hundred yards.
Dean can’t help the soft, broken noise that escapes him at that, just hopes it didn’t travel down the phone to Sam’s end.
Cas doesn’t stand, he stays as is, watching with shrewd and careful eyes, assessing, thinking. Not relaxed by any means – if you looked under the table you’d see him balanced on the balls of his feet, ready to spring up if need be. He’s staying down, non-threatening and out of sight just in case he needs to intervene.
“I could go for a bar. Are we gonna have to sell the Impala to buy a drink in this one as well, or is it reasonably priced?”
“No I don’t capiche.” She snaps. “If that thing on your arm is what’s making you immortal, I bet you can be killed by whatever can kill the three things that make it up.”
“That complicates matters. I’ll have to put measures in place to ensure they can’t return to heaven.”
Dean wants to say, better than me living with it, but he doesn’t mean it like that. Doesn’t mean he’d rather Cas was the one who suffered, or maybe he does. Alive and suffering is better than fucking dead. He doesn’t say any of this, though, because he’s too tired to start another fight, doesn’t have the energy to waste on stupid fucking squabbles when Cas is out there, alone, most likely hurt and scared.
Dean and the angel trade blows for longer than he thought possible – he’s definitely got more stamina than he used to have, but it’s not enough. He’s got more than when he was fully human, but his reserves are still finite, whereas this angel seems like a fucking machine.
Dean’s head is pillowed on his chest, mouth slightly open and snoring raspily. He seems content, dreamless. He’s not, but Cas isn’t to know that. He snorts, shifts slightly and nuzzles further into Cas’s side. Cas moves his hand from where it’s curled around Dean’s shoulder, buries it in his hair and starts to rub in gentle circles. Dean doesn’t seem to notice, but it’s as much for Cas’s benefit as for his. He finds it soothing. Something simple to focus on – clockwise and anticlockwise, up and down – to distract from the thoughts rattling around in his head. He’s an angel. He should be able to process a hundred different layers of thought at once, think and counterthink, dismiss and call to the surface as he wills. Instead he just worries, fruitlessly, gnawing at a bone long chewed clean. He’s an angel, but he’s a poor example of one.
Cas presses down, messes up the angle and barely moves. He grinds his teeth, tries again and has more luck. His frog springs down the course, rapidly catching, and then overtaking Sam’s.
Dean excuses himself to go to the bathroom. On the way back he can’t help meandering towards their room. Just one little peek, just one final glance at Cas’s face as he sleeps to sustain him. Just to see if he looks okay.
He gets what Cas is trying to say but doesn’t want to admit out loud. He’s been there, sleepless hours, the false hope that getting up and having a drink – usually booze with Dean – would reset his brain and let him drop off.
“Server spilled a salt cellar. Didn’t hit the girl, but she flinched, flipped the fuck out at her for it.”
“No, I think you should go with him. I’ll split off and head to whatever location you find – assuming it’s different.”
Dean wants to speak, but he can tell by the way Cas pauses that he’s gathering the courage to say something else, so he waits.
His third thought is doppelgangers with a psychic link. If the connection was strong enough, any injury on the copy would slice through to the original as well. It’d explain a lot of things, but most especially how Dean died every time, but only started carrying his injuries over recently.
Dean and Sam both frown – they hadn’t considered that it was. They’d had other, more innocent targets in mind.
He’d just picked up the first piece of card he’d seen, and it hadn’t looked all that special in his dim room.
“Because you enjoy it really.” Cas says. “Now Charlie, I assume the map is to show us where the plots are?”
Claire runs until her lungs are burning and she can taste blood in her mouth. She spits it onto the floor, sways, wobbles, and slumps down on the ground. She doesn’t know where she is, how far she’s gone. She just knows that she needed to get away from Sam’s voice, from Jody, from everyone who knows her and will inevitably, pointlessly, try and comfort her.
It’s not the first time he’s been down here, probably won’t be the last either. He can’t push past that last hurdle, his courage always betraying him at the last second.
Lucifer pops up just in time to see Sam give his girlfriend a farewell kiss, watch wistfully as she walks off.
He hasn’t made eye-contact with anyone the whole time he’s been talking. Scared of what he’ll see on their faces. The horror, the fear. The pity.
“Ah, shit man.” Dean looks crestfallen but tries to hide it. “I knew you were a little uncomfortable the first time, but I didn’t realise it was still that bad.”
He stumbles back to his feet, staggers forward and clutches at the empty doorframe. It doesn’t get better out of the room. Whatever’s affecting him is bunker-wide, country-wide, fucking world-wide for all he knows.
Dean is awoken by a crack of thunder. He’s unusually groggy at first, and then he notices that Cas isn’t pressed up against him. He sits up, rubs at his eyes and frowns in the direction of the bathroom. The light isn’t on so Cas isn’t in there, unless he went for a piss in the dark.
“Was it? Because it looks really fucking similar. Cas behaving weirdly, vanishing with no word, a trail of dead bodies. The first time this happened, he let loose the Leviathan. The time after that, he nearly killed you and then he cast all the angels out of heaven. He’s got priors and you know it.”
“I’m not afraid of you.” Cas lies through gritted teeth. He can’t think about what Cahor is saying, can’t let any of it in because he knows it’s true, he knows if he parses it it’ll overwhelm him and he won’t be able to do what he came here for. He has to be strong, be resolute. He has to be Castiel the avenging angel, and not Cas the pathetic junkie scum.
