dream'. John had wanted to say '
Dean can feel the sudden hot spike of embarrassment from getting shot down begin to crowd his thoughts, blinding him to the fact that Sam sounds just as nervous and on-edge as the Omega feels, so instead of waiting for Sam to finish off whatever he was about to say, ears ringing he speaks over the Alpha and rambles on,“Oh, no it's cool. Yeah, of course you're busy, it was stupid of me to call anyway, it was a bad idea, I don't know what I was thinking.”
Just as Rob made that announcement, John stepped back in, and Dean felt another pang of nerves wash over him when instead of collecting his own things from the sound room where he had been monitoring the recordings, he made his way over and stepped into the booth with Dean.
“Really? I thought you would have liked this better.” Cas says, brow furrowed in apparent confusion this time. The Alpha did that a lot.
could even love anyone else either. But here he was, the man beside him having set something alight in him, something so soft and gentle and fond and so utterly beautiful that he couldn’t believe it was his own body, his own soul that could conjure up emotions to feel this way, that he, out of the billions of people in this world deserved and was trusted so much to hold and protect something so vulnerable and precious.
never wanted me to be. It's not gonna be this way forever, I know,” he says before Bobby can intercede him with the same words he's been hearing since he knocked on the Beta's door two years ago, “but when I'm ready to face him, I'll find him, I promise...just... not now, okay?” Sam whispers this last part, as he looks imploringly up at the Beta, begging him not to push him on this to which Bobby finally concedes to this plea with a nod.
Castiel thinks, a mixture of panic and astonishment taking over as he looks up sharply at the other Alpha.
It wasn't a very professional set up, but it would make do. They had made a stop at the hardware store to buy some basic amateur equipment, with the Omega only calling a moving service earlier that day to pack up all the furniture that had been in the room, having them take it to a storage unit until he could decide what exactly he had planned for the room, since he was still waffling between leaving it as a guest room or creating a reading room for himself.
But at least he knew the general social etiquette of at the most thanking someone after they had went out of their way to make sure he wasn’t alone and stuck watching cable TV on his birthday. So he turned to face the singer, intending to do exactly that as he said, “Thank you Dean. You…” the writer paused not knowing what phrase of gratitude he wanted to say, and after a beat he simply went with the most honest response, “You didn’t have to do any of this, but I appreciate all you’ve done for me tonight. As pathetic as it sounds, this was probably the best birthday I’ve had in all my twenty-six years.”
“I'm Jo Harvelle. You must be Cas,” The other Alpha,
The Alpha shakes his head as he laughs, but he teases back, “Fishing for compliments now, aren't we Winchester.”
Castiel had been a little sceptical, because it seemed to be the type of artistry that walked the fine line between being considered appealing to the eye or simply end up being just one big bloby mess and the results one would get seemed to be a fifty-fifty toss-up of either, based on the multiple pictures and videos Dean had sent him. But the Omega had insisted and said it looked easy enough, and well, all the Alpha could really do was give his in-put with Dean making the choice for himself, and besides he was happy to help regardless.
When he had tried going to their mother, hoping she’d offer some guidance, still holding on to that naivety that she knew everything and would see reason, but she had looked at him then, eyes seeming to burn with hate as she said, “I should never have had an Alpha, they’re all the same Gabriel, not matter who they are, remember that.”
This was new though. And the more Castiel thought about it, the more he was certain it could work. Dean needed to not feel like he was the subject of some interrogation and Castiel needed to veer off from the direct, no-nonsense 'getting down to business' approach he usually adopted when it came to these things, not wanting to waste either party's time.
It's then that Castiel finally realizes what Dean is wearing and the Omega notices this when the Alpha gives him a not so subtle once over. He points his finger in the Alpha's direction when the man finally looks up at him questioningly, humour evident in his clear blue eyes, “Don't even think about it,” Dean warns him, “your brother's made enough jokes about food today as it stands. I'm actually surprised the rest of the models haven't mauled him in the parking lot by now.”
But seeing Dean automatically bowing his head down slightly in deference as he tries to move just that little further away from John as he presses his body more firmly against the door panel, settles him, that together with the already smug feeling he had before the boy opened his mouth has him not even bothering to reprimand him properly, so instead he continues, “I've been working on brokering a deal with Paul Gavins for the past few months now. He's a big wig producer and is working on an upcoming box office hit. Gave me a call around December, wanting to cast you as one of the leading roles. Some bullshit about music artists bringing in the ticket sales, which has fuck all to do with us, really. The point is, this is your next big break boy, and I managed to have them film around your schedule, which not a lot of managers can pull off might I add.”
It was funny, the voice in his head started sounding less like himself and more like his dad each day.
That was what Dean was feeling right now; responsibility for Cas, wanting to make sure nothing bad had happened to him and that he was okay. It was a terrifying thing, this bond that had grown between them, being made less malleable and breakable with every day that went by.
Castiel soon pulled out, Dean’s body still spasming from the aftershocks of his pleasure. He twisted the singer’s body around, lying him flat on his back instead, mindful of the wet spot next to him. He ripped the condom off of his achingly hard and swollen shaft, discarding it as he knee crawled up the bed, stroking his cock as he positioned himself right by Dean’s slightly parted lips, green eyes staring up at him all the while.
“Take off your clothes Dean,” Cas ordered, his voice so gruff and deep the singer didn’t think twice before he started unbuttoning his jeans, though pausing a second when he unzipped his hoodie, thinking, for the first time that night about those gashed, ugly scars marring his forearms, the other, smaller, less visible ones littering his body too. But the room was dark, far too dark for Dean to even make out the colour of Cas’s eyes, and the knowledge of that, of Cas not being able to see them, alleviated some of the anxiety that had slowly started bubbling up inside him.
Dean hadn't been blowing smoke up his ass when he said he was a regular topic of conversation among the models during the times he visited his brother. All of them seemed to be infatuated with the Alpha, bordering on being half obsessed when they found out he wasn't particularly interested in them whenever they had tried to flirt with him on occasion. They thought his playing hard to get and coyness were, in fact, downright hot.
When they finally get through the threshold of the Alpha's house, Cas immediately backs him up so that the Omega was trapped between the door and the Alpha's hard body.
(See the end of the chapter for
Eyes widening at the sensual display and words, Cas wastes no time in latching his mouth back onto the Omega's as he says between breathless kisses, “I can do that,” in a voice equally filled with want and need.
His body automatically scrambles itself to sit more upright, with Dean clearing his throat as he says, “Oh, sorry. Didn't know anybody would be here, I-I'll just, uh, go?” He didn't exactly mean for that to come out as a question, but all the same his moment of solitude had been disrupted and he fully expected to leave. And really it was too damn early for any form of interview related conversation if the writer wanted to hop on the opportunity in finding a rare moment of Dean being alone. But he still can't quite hide the disappointment marring his features when he looks back over the city and realizes he wouldn't be able to see the view of the sun cresting over the mountain range after all.
Shrugging his shoulder as he finally withdraws his hand and goes back to fiddling with his camera, Gabriel rolls his eyes in exaggeration, his cheery self back in place as he fires back, “Well, I can't be perfect at
That didn’t make him any less determined to have Cas
Dean knew he wasn't as good with his words as Cas was, so he decides to just make his confession simple, “I've been thinking about it,
He has a sudden realization then; he fucking
But it was something else Cas had completely wrecked without even knowing he had, because he couldn’t completely deny the fact that the simple act of talking to Cas, having somebody who was really listening to him, with no judgement, no expectations from either of them, no weight of worrying about being a burden, it soothed something deep inside himself.
Castiel can see from the corner of his eye Dean getting comfortable in his own seat as he stares at the side of his head and with false affront replies, “Only sometimes?”
A silence had fallen over the pair as they made their way back to the hotel. It wasn’t the tense sort, but it wasn’t the comfortable sort either. Instead, it was the expectant sort, the deafening quiet stretching and stretching and stretching, as if even the very air around them was waiting for something,
The Omega looks over at her, at first glance she would seem a striking, somewhat unapproachable figure. Though observing her more closely he can spot those imperceptible features that softened all her sharper edges; the slight crinkling at the corner of her eye, the laugh lines he can see peeking almost shyly at the edge of her mouth. And looking up the Omega can see the numerous grey hairs beginning to settle into place amongst the almost auburn locks of her hair, giving the older Alpha a sense of grace that could only come from having experienced life.
“Need to be inside you Omega,” Castiel rumbles as he dips down, covering his Omega’s now swollen and saliva slick lips with his own, his tongue chasing the Omega’s sounds, only to draw back as his teeth nip gently onto that plush bottom lip, the slight feel of pleasure-pain from the ministration distracting the Omega as the Alpha plunges two of his fingers into the wet, slick heat of his pulsing hole.
He pulled out of Dean’s mouth soon after, wincing as the singer still sucked on his over-sensitive cock with every inch that was guided out, the brat actually smiling coyly up at him. He arched a brow at the display of the singer licking his lips as if to catch any stray drops of his come, “Mmm, just as good as I thought you’d taste, baby.”
He also knows his pheromones were going haywire at the moment, his sweet apple scent permeating the air as his instincts interpreted Hannah’s sorrow as an Alpha in distress, and Dean can’t do a damn thing to stop this visceral Omegan reaction, hoping the Alpha wouldn’t mind since Dean didn’t think he could let go, not with how worked up the Omega inside him was, blurting out a muffled “Sorry, it’s…I can’t help it.”
“No, no, nothing's wrong. Just wanted to see if maybe you'd wanna meet up some time? Haven't seen you in a few, is all.”
deep down, that somehow they were supposed to be together, from the moment the Alpha laid eyes on his Omega, that was it, he was lost and consumed by something much bigger than himself and it was by time he stopped fighting the Alpha side of him like he had gotten so used to doing over the years, an irony for him since for years he has strived to help young students in his classes the importance of their biological make-up and how it was okay to express their natural inclinations. After all, it was that part that brought him closer to the Omega in the first place, clearly his instincts knew what he should be doing better than he did. He just hoped and prayed that they wouldn't fail him now that he needed them the most.
“Tell me what you need me to do Dean,” his Alpha spoke out, his own voice sounding suspiciously frail in that moment.
“This meeting should've happened a lot sooner than now, but I'm sure you already know, running this kind of show is a rather monumental task to do.” John says, Castiel slightly surprised that he had offered up the first words of this impending conversation, all things considered.
The Omega doesn't know how to react to that sweet confession, so in true Dean Winchester fashion his humour filters through as he snorts out a,”You're such a boyscout, Cas, prepared for everything.”
“Dean, you know you're gonna have to tell him soon right? You leave in what, like two days!”
Getting back on track, that line of thinking too much for him to even consider especially this evening, he continues "I didn't understand any of their motives though, how could they not see they were becoming the very thing they were fighting against? I was so angry at the way they thought about us, that the most logical thing for me to do at the time, no matter how stupid it sounds now, was to become the monster mo-
that being here was a big deal for Dean, even if it were childish, it was the only time he could be just himself.
That had been a much harder pill to swallow.
There were no lights, no cameras, no people screaming at him, telling him what to do, or who to be. There were no pills he had to take to get his head screwed on right to sing and perform in front of thousands of people, mind going numb and blank until all those things he felt so intensely: the pain, and anxiety and constant guilt of disappointment, all got trapped inside the glass dome of his mind.
“Cas, you might not know this, but seeing as you're actually dressed like a normal fucking person in front of the rest of them for once, you're like ten times hotter in their eyes, ain't no way I'm leavin' you here by yourself. Unless of course you want to stay out here?” Dean explains as he looks back at the Alpha, raising a challenging eyebrow at Cas, daring him to say anything about his brazen attitude.
to see him first Jo. I already called Gabriel, he gave me the number of one of the people working in Cas’s department and she gave me his schedule, he apparently doesn’t leave until late these days, she says he’s working on some big project, I’m not really sure. But either way he’ll be at campus and there’s no way I can wait any longer.”
Castiel is clearly not the only one inspecting the other as her brown eyes seem to size him up in contemplation as well. The Alpha isn't sure why she's doing it, but the critical look from the other Alpha has his own Alpha brain kicking in, making him stand up straighter, head tipping up slightly to let her know he's not intimidated in the least as he stares at her just as intently with his blue eyes focused on her brown ones, neither backing down for the other.
Dean's hand that isn't trapped between their bodies comes up to cup Castiel's cheek, not a slight bit of concern going for the fact that the still wet paint on his hand is smearing all over the Alpha's cheek as he opens his mouth in response to the probing strokes of Cas's warm lips and tongue that run themselves along the seam of his own plump mouth.
whoever that was just now.”
Castiel could see a slight blush spread on Dean's face, and
Mentions of physical child abuse, suicide (by hanging), child witnessing the death of a parent, suicide ideation, attempted suicide and anxiety/panic attacks.
There was a moment of tense silence, but then Cas sighed deeply, closing his eyes for a second, and when he opened them Dean could see his regret written all over his face.
“Cas…I-I,” Dean stutters out, looking almost frantic as he starts to paw at the Alpha’s clothes.
Castiel sighed in resignation when he heard the first notes of one of Dean's songs start to play, and he resigned himself to a night spent inside his hotel room where all the official employees, including Dean himself, were staying until he finished up the two concerts he had scheduled in this city.
He had known being away from Cas for so long would have been a challenge, they were a new couple after all, and this was one of the first challenges that had been thrown their way. Yet, at the same time, Dean knew this wasn’t normal, this deep-seated longing, this
“No more than you're using me,” Dean responds, meeting Cas's angry, insulted scowl with his own dejected smile that felt wobbly on his lips.
With that conviction, he stands up from the bed, not giving a single thought to his nudity and with confident strides, he walks up to the Omega who is tracking his movements like a deer caught in the headlights, knowing that he wasn't in control over whatever was about to happen going forward.
“Yeah, yeah, whatever,” is Dean's last response as the limo finally pulls into the underground parking garage of the hotel, hoping it didn’t look too obvious how fucking eager he was to go and check up on the writer.
watched and
“Ms. Harvelle requested me to find you,” she says in an almost robotic, no-nonsense voice, taking long, fast strides as she leads him through the chaos of the dressing room further on back, not elaborating further even though Castiel has no idea who this 'Ms Harvelle' person is and why she would be requesting to see him.
“God! That's one of the best last lines to any movie. Ever. I swear,” Dean says as he flops back after the ending credits start to roll.
But his presence didn't go ignored for very long as Dean not so subtly extricates himself from the no doubt crushing embrace of the other Alpha and steps closer to Castiel, gently brushing his fingertips against his Alpha's, the simple touch seeming to calm him down. Castiel is a little shocked that  the Omega could read him so well, even when he hasn't outright displayed his dissatisfaction nor having his displeasure seep into his pheromones yet for it to be scented by the man.
Clearing his throat, Cas manages to get out, “Well, if you must know, I was thinking about taking you to the movies.”
The innocence of the question, the vulnerability of his brother seeking out comfort from the only source he could find, had set something off inside him. What he saw in front of him wasn’t some deranged, power hungry Alpha, it was just a little boy, lip quivering, and eyes bright and lost and scared, mind shaped already by a world that slowly grew to hate him simply because of his designation.
Cas hummed, letting Dean know he was listening and prompting Dean to continue, “Yeah, my mom, she loved the ocean, used to take me out every chance she could. I remember she had one of them real old Polaroid cameras, used to run around down on the beach front forcing me to take pictures with her. She always said she looked her best when I was in the shots with her, though that was probably just her way of guilt-tripping me to not run away every time she brought it out.”
“I was just joking Cas, you don't actually have to take me out, I mean what's the point, we pretty much made it to the endgame already anyway.”
Well, that certainly covered all Dean's questions, so he just nods his assent and replies, “Yeah, sounds like her. I'll, uh, just get my things then I guess.”
he had gone from having a pleasant, rosy blush spread across his face to being outright fire engine red from the straight forward question. He scratches the back of his neck and wouldn't look Castiel in the eye as he tried to formulate a response.
While alarm bells were going off in his head, Dean knowing his eyes probably looked as big as saucers as he stands there and stares at Cas, rethinking his whole plan, the writer simply steps to the side to allow room for Dean to come in. His exterior all cool and suave and detached, not blinking an eye at the singer and instead remains silent.
Deciding that standing here thinking about all this was just putting a damper on his already gloomy mood, he pushes all those thoughts to a dark corner of his mind and locks them up tight. He didn't want anything to spoil his night with the Alpha, least of all his, admittedly, shitty self-esteem issues.
As Gabe moves closer to Dean, he stretches his hand out and places it on the Omega's shoulder, saying in an uncharacteristically reassuring tone, “There's nothing to worry about Dean. I'm pretty sure Cassie has a good enough idea of what your life's like already. And besides, he'll understand. He's not gonna be much better when exam season comes around or the times when he'll be going on sabbatical, trust me, you ain't seen my little bro when he goes full-on professor nerd mode before, I barely see him then, what with all that research he buries himself under.”
“Gotta settle with your mouth for now,” was all Castiel said before Dean bobbed his head quickly, enthusiastic about getting his mouth fucked even when his body was as lax and over-sensitive as it was.
Funny, Castiel didn’t think he had ever seen them before this night. They were splattered all over the bridge of his nose and across his cheeks, like little golden dust flakes, a mark of youth that would forever remain and bloom in the heat of the summer sun.
“I should probably head out, it's getting late.” Dean mutters out as he pushes himself up and away from the heat of Cas's body. Getting off the bed, he starts to pull on his jeans from earlier.
want to leave the warm nest of the Alpha's bed), and clearly Cas was just as stuck on what to say as he was.
“What’re ya doing Cas?” Dean questions as he sees Cas making his way over to his phone that he had left by the Bluetooth speakers in the corner of the room when the Alpha had set up some music for them.
And finally, there he is, face-to-face with the young man who had stolen his heart and took it with him when he had left, missing the fan of those dark, long lashes, those freckles dotting his nose and cheeks, those bowed, pink-stained lips, now slightly parted as the Omega rests.
Castiel can't help but laugh as Dean pushes him away, the blushing Omega doing his best in trying to look as indignant as possible, “'M not jealous!”
Journalist. But he also knew he had always been such a damn unlikable person, inside and out. And knowing how to say things, how to carefully consider and frame words, something that came so naturally to most people, was always something he had had difficulty with.
There was a wildness in the writer at that moment, he could feel it. Something clawing and brewing inside waiting to come out, with all of it, all of
Not hesitating, Dean stepped into the dimly lit room, closing the door behind him as he did so.
But that was all it ever was, an image, an idea of a mother he had missed, had lost and wanted desperately to find again. And after, when the cracked, dirty wooden door of her home had slammed shut in his face, as he wondered the cold streets that night, having nowhere to go, he realized he had already found a mother in the form of a sweet, gentle old lady who had taken in the messed up teenager he was and really tried harder than any person before to change his life.
Jo had left him around an hour ago to do damage control on something or the other. He had chatted to a few people that he knew who had passed by him, but had declined their offers of going to sit with their groups. He wasn't in the mood to force polite conversation with people he barely knew and who were either well on their way to being completely smashed, or to those who in general just wanted to talk shit about the newest gossip that was making it's way through the mill. Over the years he had found that his tolerance level for these things had outright diminished to zero, and calling people out on not being able to find anything better to do than criticize people and spread rumours had not made him a very popular figure.
But clearly Dean hadn't been the only one affected, Cas had went full on Alpha-mode on his ass, literally, the moment Dean brushed his lips against his. It was the side of Cas that hadn't come out, not as uninhibited anyway, since that first night they slept together. There was a subtle hint of a kind of possessive, primal, and unrestrained quality to his behaviour that Dean hadn't seen before and the Omega side of him responded to it with sweet submission and longing.
he couldn't fathom a world where the Alpha would bother sticking around longer once he got to see how truly messed up and bland he was.
It was while he was lost to the thoughts in his own head that the singer startles when hears somebody clearing their throats from the other side of the bench next to his. Looking over, Dean's surprised when he sees it's that writer dude, Cas or something, sitting there, watching him with those deep blue eyes of his that had Dean fumbling with his words when they were first introduced.
Like he always dreamed he would be when this was all over. He just had to stick it out until then and not do anything stupid in the meantime.
While Dean had been setting up picking something to watch, Castiel had decided it was good to order in some food since neither of them had eaten anything yet. Coming back from collecting their food at his door, he found the singer loading the movie on whatever streaming service the hotel had.
“I know,” Dean replied, and Cas smiled at the simple truth of the words. Because Dean did know, of course he did, he’s been spilling out everything about his own self and life and past to the writer.
“Well, if it isn't my favourite little pet,” the dark, sleek stained voice jars Dean out of his musings. He had just gotten done for the day, ready to book it to his hotel sans Jo since she was off making her own contacts around the city and was waiting on the pavement for his company's private car to pick him up since they at least catered for their models and the rest of their crew members to have their own transport whilst in Paris.
Twenty minutes later, Dean found himself on the rooftop deck of the hotel after asking the waiter who brought his coffee what side of the building was the best to get a view of said sunrise. It was a little of a cheating move, asking the waiter, but Dean found even after his shower he was too tired to go wondering around like he usually would when he did this.
(See the end of the chapter for
The one where the blade had gone too far, gone too deep, over and over and over again. He couldn’t remember much, but he somehow remembered the swooping acidic sensation of his own heart breaking, seeing the wet-pools of pain he had put in those young, innocent hazel eyes.
Please, Cas, please, want you,” Dean pleaded, not moving very far from the older man’s mouth as he spoke.
Just as suddenly the singer realized he couldn’t recall his last meal, not beyond the copious amounts of caffeine and energy drinks that had been shoved his way. Sam usually made sure he got some food into his system but with all the planning for the global launch of the tour coming up sooner than anyone anticipated, Dean thought Sam hardly even managed to get some solid food into his own system, let alone having to get Dean to do something as simple as feeding himself.
He had been scouring the place out, hoping he could spot the familiar Omega, a feat that seemed impossible with how dark the place was and he also thought about the one-hundred percent possibility of Dean spending the night with his friends.
Raising an eyebrow at the slight disbelief in Cas's tone, Dean takes a sip of his beer and says, “Nah, I mean, after being part of all this,” making a wide gesture to the crowd in general, having no other way to explain all that accompanied what went with his specific career, “for the past coupl'a years, I definitely developed an appreciation for all the bazaar fashion that's come up, no doubt, but that whole accountant vibe you got going on suits you a lot better, and besides that you look more
His eyes couldn't help but scan over to the singer, his chest heaving up and down, seeing the way he shifted from foot to foot. The movement seemed oddly stilted and looking back up at Dean's face, he sees a flash of pain coordinating with the soft press of pressure every time one foot hits the ground.
Dean thinks, stumbles into him, causing the Omega to lose his balance as well. But before he can embarrass himself by crashing to the floor, hands grab a hold of his upper arm and steadies him as he's gently pulled against a warm chest. Dean's about to thank whoever it is that helped him, and extricate himself from said body to continue his search for Cas when he looks up and finds those familiar blue eyes staring down at him and the Omega smiles, because
Staring at him with an angry look of her own at his implications that she might have thought so little about the Omega, she says seriously, “Look, you're right, I don't know you, but Dean's told me a lot about you and by the sounds of it he trusts you, and based on what he's said, you seemed to be a good enough Alpha, unless you're trying really hard to change my mind here about you, Castiel.”
, quite slacking off, I don't pay to have you two stand around all day!” She directs the last part to Garth and Ash, who are standing to the side and they both jump up when Ellen reprimands them.
This draws a chuckle out of Dean though, and he nods his head as if he knew what Castiel meant, “Yeah, pretty much. But I was kinda shy and invisible back in high school, and being the new kid every other semester just made making friends worse with how often my dad would move us around, and after the initial shock that was Ash subsided, he was, and still is, a pretty cool dude to hang out with, for the little while we stayed in that town anyway.”
One step forward, two steps back.
Dean can't help but laugh at the last part, and squeezes the Alpha's hand as he says honestly, “Either way I'll enjoy it, Cas, I'm with you after all.”
Even if his knot weren't fully formed outside of his rut to keep himself hard and heavy plugged in Dean's body, the Alpha doesn't bother to withdraw yet, staying nestled inside the warm channel even as the feelings of over-stimulation starts to mar his post-orgasm glow. Instead he turns their bodies until he's spooning Dean, the Omega nestled tightly in his arms and against his chest, feeling the need to keep the him close, not wanting to let him go just yet. And that's how they stay, the Alpha holding tightly onto the Omega, as sleep eventually overtakes them both.
All Castiel wanted to do was to go home, back to his quiet apartment, back to the semblance of normalcy he had carved out for himself over the years. But no, now he was here, in a place where he had no one to talk to, no one who knew him, having no place amongst the hustle and bustle of Dean's team and garnering the distinct impression that he was not wanted here, seen as a slimy, opportunistic intruder who wanted to root out and expose every little detail he could get his hands on.
The Alpha could tell the Omega was rambling nervously, but he didn't bother to cut him off, not only was he interested to know about Dean's more personal life, but his brain had also halted when Dean said he never brought anyone here before. He couldn't help but feel a tingle of warmth blossom through him at the thought that Dean found him to be different, in a seemingly good way, than any other person he had dated before. But he decided not to comment on this fact for now, the Omega clearly already felt embarrassed enough about how things were going thus far, not that Castiel minded though. It was refreshing to see this side of Dean, somehow giving him a glimpse into his more private life beyond his job.
“I can assure you, neither of those options applies,” Cas responded, finally turning around to look straight at Dean.
Cas keeps his eyes on the ceiling for a few moments before he eventually looks down at Dean, piercing the Omega with his sharp blue eyes, “Did you know I had a crush on you, before all this?”
Just as he gets there, somebody,
“It was no imposition, really...Yes that's fine, I'll let him know, goodbye.”
In a fit of panic, wishing he had never made the call in the first place and just wanting it to be done, Dean presses the
to anyway, since he did, in fact, like it, a whole fucking lot, and hoped Cas would heavily indulge in the act as the night wore on, the singer simply rolled his eyes, then let a smirk of his own grace his lips as he decided to use the writer’s words to his advantage, “Maybe we should move this to the bed then, don’t’cha think?”
in him from twisting bitterly at the thought that he couldn't do anything though. The feeling intensifying every time he sees the singer obviously struggling as his movements become more stilted and awkward and his smile tinged with an embarrassment that wasn't funny or cute, instead looking as if he wanted to crawl into a hole in the ground and just die as the other back-up dancers stand on the sidelines watching him fail again and again and again.
“Alpha!” Dean all but screams as he
scientific mumbo jumbo isn’t the be all and end all of truths in this world Cassie,” Gabriel fires back, “say what you will, deny it if you want, doesn’t change the fact that your Alpha there it hell bent on bonding with its intended mate, and all this,” the Beta says as he motions to the generalness of Castiel’s poor state, “probably won’t get any better the longer you try and restrain your instincts.”
we're talking about, just the publicity we need after your tour is set to hit next week, there's still a few concerts that aren't sold out yet. ”
The Omega walks in and his eyes scan the space. It seemed to be in an organised kind of chaos, one wall lined from floor to ceiling with a bookshelf, noting how haphazardly books were strewn in the shelves, hands itching to sort them out.
But the thought was all he needed, the sudden burst of pleasure at the prospect of Dean actually being his true mate making his mind go lazy and overtaken with a desire he had never known.
It was surprisingly easy, being with Cas like that. Dean had thought the grumpy man he met a few weeks ago would never be up for something like playing make-believe races, or throwing colourful plastic balls into the imaginary stomach of animal figures or impressing Dean with his skills of playing good old-fashioned arcade games like Pac-man and Tekken and Street Fighter and Dean even managed to rope him into playing good old Fred Flintstone’s Memory Match.
the better choice.
But the Omega's attempt turns out not to be any better, paint landing with a resounding splat on the newspaper behind him and somehow in his hair too, with even less than Castiel's landing on the actual wall.
Dean doesn't know what to expect, maybe a box of candy, or popcorn or some type of movie snack along those lines, but the last thing he predicts Cas to be pulling out are two
But he was wrong, he knew now. It was being able to love somebody else that was this
He hadn't had much time to be alone with the singer, having only arrived  yesterday. The only time Castiel really got to speak with him between then and now was when Dean's father, John, had made brief introductions.
Hearing Jo's name grabs the Omega's attention and he looks over at the Alpha with a quizzical expression on his face.
happen to this man.
s, to look Cas in the eye while they do this.
Cas nods eagerly, pulling Dean back in so he kiss his neck and jawline, his tongue running across the sharp stubble, the molecules of
Cas’ runs the back of his fingers against Dean’s cheek, so much affection in the simple gesture that it makes Dean’s stomach tighten uncomfortably, but he can’t resist leaning into it. “I can do that too, but-”
He doesn’t offer clarification. You feel stupid for wanting some. All of the impossible things you’ve seen, why do you care? Why do you need to know the details? Why does it matter that they are together? That they created a family? Do you think you can too? Do you think you’re as special as Winchester?
He leans on the bar. ‘Claire is my vessel’s daughter. I took her father from her.”
The child reaches for Dean and is pulled into his arms, plastered against his chest, small and content and belonging. You wonder what their life will be like. Will they be a Hunter? You doubt it, you doubt the doubt. How do you choose to bring life into this life? It’s too hard, too sad, too lonely, too destructive. Not even dandelions grow through the concrete paving of a Hunter’s solitude, of their broken soul and heart, things you drag along behind you like a yoke, reminding you that you must keep going, that one day, you will not be able to keep going. The baggage. How do you inflict that on a child? When will this creature’s heart be torn out of its chest and put inside a box and chained shut, only to be its greatest weakness and source of strength?
“I’m not.” He shrugs. “So, a room?”
“That’s one word for it.”
While waiting for Dean, he finally finishes the beer that he’s been pretending to drink for the past three hours. He knows that it is warm from his touch and mostly flat, but he can’t
Whether because of his genuine confusion or her own lack of conviction in what she’s saying, she softens. “Just the guys are clocking onto you, so probably best to head off soon, okay?”
“Any other recommendations?”
On the second ring, your phone connects.
It makes no sense that he’s reluctant, they’ve gotten this far, why is Dean still trying to pretend like he could wrangle his way out of calling this what it is? Like he could face the sunlight in the morning and say that this is just what friends do when they’re keyed up and need a helping hand. A helping hand. He almost laughs. Sure, they could’ve shared a drunken hand job and left it at that, but it’s not that anymore; not when Cas is on top of him like this, not when they’ve kissed like that, not when he wants,
“Cas, wait,” he manages to pull away with the last semblance of his common sense. “What are we doing?”
His smile seems genuine and so is your surprise.
Dean sighs. “She’s upstairs. Giving her a minute, she hasn’t been around in months.” You think he sounds upset. “Typical.”
, no,
him. He sucks bruises into Cas’ throat as the angel moans; he winces as nails dig into him hard enough to break skin. Cas regards the red liquid on his fingertips for a moment before sucking them clean while he stares in Dean’s eyes, and it nearly pushes him over the edge. Dean is used to being viewed for consumption, objectified, desired, sexualised, but no one has ever wanted him so wholly before. There is no part of Dean that Cas rejects; not his broken body, not his tainted soul, not his cursed blood, not his destructive love.
When Cas look at him, he knows why.
He raises his eyebrows. “Anything?”
He snorts. “At their age you were smoking oregano with your bougie friends. I was actually saving people.”
The room spins gently around you, but you’re content to watch the show. It’s not one that would be on TV, but it should be, warm and carefree and soft, it’s the show of a family. They move around each other in a practiced dance; Sam and Eileen and Claire and Kaia and Castiel and Dean. So many of them. All alive. All in love. So much love. It’s hard not to watch Dean and Castiel, they’re captivating. Beautiful. You notice the magnetism, how they’re constantly touching, brushing, holding, pressing, it seems so easy, it would seem so easy if you weren’t watching, but you are, and you see how Dean watches the room, the way he look out before he does something deliberate, the way he pauses, the way he checks himself and checks himself checking himself. Dean tells a joke you don’t catch. Castiel responds by kissing him. You feel like you shouldn’t be watching. Your heart won’t let you look away. They talk an inch from each other’s faces. You wonder what it feels like to love someone like that.
Her eyes slide over to the pair. “In all the ways that matter.”
It’s rough: their stubble, their hands, their touches, their kisses, the motel sheets; nothing is gentle. They fight each other other, hair pulling and biting lips and grabbing handfuls of flesh, the upper hand slipping between the two of them as they try to find a rhythm. Someone turns the lamp off, letting the harsh light be replaced by the orange slashes of streetlamps coming through the half open blinds. Cas looms over Dean, his hair wild, half his face illuminated with the artificial fire, and
“I- I usually stay in my car, to be honest.”
They fall asleep tangled in the damp sheets, neither of them able to pay attention to the chaos going on just outside of their door. Tomorrow they would find out that everything electrical within a five mile radius had burnt itself out, and be thankful that they were out in the middle of nowhere, the nearest hospital mercifully saved from their destructive union. Was it poetic? Was it fitting? Dean couldn’t bring himself to care. The world had asked him to die for it, to break himself down, to hate himself over and over and over, does he not deserve a love that leaves its mark back?
The secret language you’ve learnt to speak. The other one. Hidden even beneath the Hunter’s code. The more forbidden one. The one of monsters like you.
He drops his gaze. “I wanted to keep it.”
Apparently he said something wrong.
He notices you.
You somehow agree to stay. The rates are reasonable and the weather turned recently, so you know that even if you get some sleep in your car, it’ll be fraught and restless, and a warm bed in the safest place in the US is hard to turn down. You wonder if they’re both always this attentive or if its you, if you’re really that pathetic, if it rolls off of you like a stench, trails after you like blood, someone else, yours. You accept the insistence of kindness from the Angel,
“Welcome.”
But this is not home. (Nowhere is home.)
“That’s not a proposition,” he adds quickly. “Dean tells me that I sound like I’m hitting on people when I say that.”
“Dean, are you trying to tell me that you’ve penetrated another a man, but have not been penetrated?”
Fallen. Broken. Traitor.
“Uh-“
“Show off.”
“Finally!”
The drink is good, better than the last. Truthfully, you don’t like beer that much, but it’s easy and universal and unassuming. This isn’t beer, not in that way. It’s smooth and creamy and sweet, it rolls around on your tongue, asking to be tasted, not to be drunk. The honey has that sharpness of real, pure honey, the slight antiseptic burn you get from eating it straight from the jar. You remember eating honey from a jar, a chunk of comb suspended in the golden substance. You didn’t know it meant so much to you.
as a werepire,” a new voice cuts in. It’s grumbling like Dean’s, somehow more gravelly; do they communicate in earthquakes? “Stop trying to make werepire happen.”
“No problem,” she nods at Dean but glances at Cas uneasily.
Cas helps him collect the last of the glasses, stacking them into long, precarious towers. Not as tall as the ones Dean makes; he’s not as easy in his body, not as used to being observed, and he hates the sound of shattering glass, hates the silence afterwards, hates that moment of momentum when the breaking is about to happen and is happening and has happened. For angels, it’s always about to happen and happening and happened. Or, it used to be like that. When
Sam pulls a face. “You’re such a jerk.”
You have dreams you don’t understand, but they don’t scare you. Nothing hunts you in the dark corners of your mind, you are not lost, you are not running, you are safe. Bathed in blue-white light that feels like sunshine and makes your lips tingle. It’s pure and divine and you do not feel worthy, but the feeling does not last, the self-loathing is soothed, washed away like a baptism of permission to see the way you
Riteous. Blunt. Soldier.
“Uh-huh. If you need anything just, uh, deal with it? This isn’t the Hilton. My D- Dean gets up pretty early, but if you wanna get away there’s like a key box and stuff. Night.”
Castiel looks across the bar at Claire, laughing loudly and talking in big, dramatic gestures with a group of Hunters. “Yes.”
Probably gets this all the time, an understood consequence of stepping outside of the comfort zone. Your comfort zone, not his, you realise. This is his domain, his playground, his paradise on Earth, as was the promised bounty for fighting on humanity’s side in the war. The one no one else had to fight in because he did.
“Don’t feel like getting jumped,” Dean shrugs, his head rolling subtly in the direction of a table of men who are watching them with open contempt. “Want another one?”
Wanna make you come, wanna feel it,” Dean murmurs quietly, quickly. His fist wraps tightly around Cas’ cock, moving in tandem with his thrusts, adding to the choir of wet, filthy sounds. “
“Got a new dark in, like dessert in a glass.” He looks at Sam: “Finally found an apiarist to work with.”
It’s the filthiest thing Dean has ever heard. An angel of the Lord kneeling on a bed in a cheap motel in a forgotten corner of the USA, asking,
So, maybe you’re suddenly afraid because the things you didn’t want to be true? Suddenly reality has shifted and not only do they reconcile with the truth, they are immutable from it, it is more impossible that impossible things
with that tongue. Things that they might enjoy. “You okay?”
A young woman, her blonde hair half-braided and threaded with metal, slides over the top of the bar, her leather trousers giving her enough slip over the wood. Her heavy boots thud onto the ground and she grins manically at his frown.
“It’s a good thing, Dean,” Sam pushes. “Her and Kaia are doing a hundred times better than we would’ve.”
Castiel pats his head. “He’s spoilt.”
‘German pilsner.”
“That is the problem, but Dean humours me.”
He narrows his eyes playfully. “I didn’t have to. I know Hunters.”
He seems surprised by Cas’ voice and its preternatural grumble. “Yeah, you can get the fuck outta here.”
“I believe you call them mementos,” he says anyway.
because he stands on Earth, because he is not part of Heaven, because he is of Dean, not of God. He touches the child’s face gently, tenderly, motherly, and you ache for such simple, all-consuming affection, for someone to look at you with the reverence of worship at the altar of a god that speaks back. Castiel’s (because
“Yeah, yeah, nice to see you too, old man.”
“Whoever’s left.”
“Oh. I’m sorry.”
supposed to be an angel?
But maybe this isn’t his weakness. If you do not have a soft underbelly then why do you need to have claws? If you do not have a reason to fight then what drives you to win? Dean bares his throat to the world to show it that he has something to protect, and that is what makes him so dangerous. What do you have? Where is the kink in your armour? What are you fighting for?
, a man who used to torture souls in Hell to fuck him. If they had any doubts about how far they had strayed from God’s light, this is the damning confirmation. There’s no coming back from this. But when Dean faces Cas, looks into his eyes, he doesn’t see anything sinful there. Facing away from the light, Cas’ eyes should be dark, but they shine up Dean; bright and blue and
“Not tha’ drunk,” you protest, but the world spins when you close your eyes.
“Fuck me, Dean.”
“It’s good.”
If Castiel is the shield of God. If Dean Winchester is the Sword of Michael. If they were truly made only for battle, then the way they touch each other is blasphemy of the highest order. Dean’s fingers push inside of Cas tenderly, his hand no longer a weapon, but an instrument of affection, of pleasure; Cas’ resistance falls away, his defences well and truly breeched. But this is not a battle, there is nothing to fear from their softening, from their vulnerability. Cas murmurs constant praises and directions and exclamations, he fills the silence as Dean fills him, like music, setting the tempo that they dance to. His human brain sparks like a lightning storm when the right places are touched, his nerves are frayed against
“Mornin’! How’s your head?” Dean grins brightly from behind the bar. He’s wearing a stained apron that says
“What?”
You keep your eyes on his, if you blink, you’ll see it again. “Shifter. Of a sort.”
He’s tall, made even taller by the short woman by his side, and their hands move animatedly as they talk, too precise, too many deliberate gestures to just be physicality. He watches her when she speaks, her voice is rounded and deliberate. Eileen Leahy. A Deaf Hunter. You remember someone telling you she was eaten by Hellhounds, dragged into the pit, and brought back by Sam, his magic, his love, willing to transcend the boundaries of life, upset the balance of the universe: all for her.
Dean leans on the bar and grins at the bartender, thankfully a woman, just slightly older than him. “Evening ma’am, two of whatever bottles you got going.”
“Apiarist?” You venture.
Cas puts his hand on Dean’s shoulder,
“Ughh, are you serious?”
“I’m on my way.”
Although it feels like sacrilege, you forgo the pancakes he tries to convince you on; you’ve never had much of a stomach in the mornings, but especially not this early, after drinking, with such a long drive ahead. You’ll regret not eating in a few hours, but you’ve never been kind to your future self, why start now? You watch and sip your coffee and let the day seep into your brain, acknowledging that you have to live today, get on with it all. Again.
“Iowa.”
“Get off my dick,” Claire bats back.
in front of some of the offerings. But there are people you’re familiar with, even if you don’t know
“You must know everything.”
“Yeah, well, gotta make up for tryna shoot him, huh?” You and Castiel share a look. You do not ask for clarification. “You stayin’?” You nod. “Awesome. Another drink?”
“Just a beer, man.”
A thousand images flash across Dean’s mind, only a fraction of the things that he wants, barely scratching the surface of the things they could do. But very few of those are possible right now. He gets up without warning and Cas makes a noise of protest at being left alone, somehow forgetting that he and Dean would have to stop touching each other
Jerking into Dean’s hand, Cas climaxes suddenly and ferociously as his name, his full, God given name, rolls off of Dean Winchester’s tongue and onto his own. All of the lights in the room illuminate and smash; the TV screeches with static before falling to pieces; the streetlights become supernovas and collapse in on themselves; screams come from every direction. But the only thing Dean can hear as he orgasms is Cas, his arm tight around Dean’s neck, his mouth next to his ear, his worshipping words urgent and breathless.
There’s something deeply absurd happening here. You feel it when you first visit and you realise. Pulling off of a hunt in nowhere middle America, aching in your bones and, depending on what you killed, your heart, and you remember that Dean Winchester -
Dean looks towards the door that leads to the mysterious back. “Bee keeper. My-“ He pauses abruptly. “He likes bees.”
“You need to go to bed, buddy,” Dean says quietly, his voice so steeped in affection it makes your chest yearn. You can’t help being in earshot. That doesn’t make it right. “Want me? What’s wrong with your Dad?”
She kisses him on the cheek, he rolls his eyes, but leans into it, his mouth quirking upwards at the corners. Another woman appears, dark skinned and soft-eyed, she walked around the bar, civilised and grounded. The blonde throws her arm over her shoulders, you remember who they are: Claire and Kaia Nieves. The daughter of an Angel and a Dreamwalker. You heard they spared a family of werewolves on the West coast, you heard there’s a network for them, monsters who are not monstrous. You don’t like to think about what that means for you. The things you’ve done.
“Are you assuming or do you know for a fact?” asks Billie.
The joint gym sessions have really helped Castiel feel more confident in his body. Quitting his job had helped a bit too. Dr. Shurley hadn’t been happy, but Dean had encouraged Castiel to do something different for a while. Castiel thinks he wants to write grants for non-profits, but he’s actually happy working at Starbucks for now. He feels more in control, more satisfied with his life and is even coming off of some of his meds because he’s not as depressed anymore. He’s pretty sure that has more to do with Dean than being free of his dissertation, but Billie is helping him keep an open mind. Some of the other grad students have shamed him a bit for leaving academia, but Dean shuts them down with “Any of you finish yet? Didn’t think so. Don’t judge what you don’t understand.”
Castiel stows the boxed lunch in the fridge and plonks down on his sofa, appetite gone. He has a million and one things to do today, but all of his tenuous motivation has vanished.
“I hate having to see all the other grad students and knowing I should be done by now. It’s embarrassing. I know they all wonder why I’m still here.”
15:05 Dean:
Castiel chokes on his own spit. “Dating? Me and Meg? No!” He turns around and finds Dean looking at him with an uncertain expression on his face. “We’re friends. Good friends, that’s all. Besides, she’s sort of the wrong, um–” Castiel cuts himself off before he can say too much. “Uh, the bed’s ready.”
Cas drop drops his head back onto the back of the sofa, looking over at Dean. “There’s nothing wrong with wanting to make other people happy, as long as it doesn’t make you miserable in the process.”
“Dean.”
He’s sitting in a small patch of snow, looking up at the cold stars, shoulders drooped. Dean imagines his wings are probably drooping right now, too.
And with that, Crowley heads down the hall toward his office, whistling cheerily.
But he shouldn’t have worried. Dean grins, brilliantly so, and says, “I’d like that.”
“Probably,” Castiel says, tossing his laundry into the basket. “She does like to make my life slightly miserable.”
“What would finishing mean?”
“And if I said I also like Katee and Tricia?”
“Please, it’s just Dean. And uh, I think there might be an issue for me. See, I’m more of an engineering student than a biologist. I don’t think anyone here is going to be studying anything close to what I am.”
21:54 Meg:
Castiel looks up from the assignment sheet and finds Dean looking at him with an irritated expression on his face.
“Ah, straight boy pain. That really sucks.”
Dean glares at Cas. “Ya think!?”
21:58 Castiel:
“Whatever, Clarence. You know what I mean.” Meg rolls her eyes at him, and then pushes off the counter. “Ugh, Crowley’s here.”
Charlie gives him another calculating look, like she wants to say something more, and then smiles a little. “What did you have in mind?”
They both drift off and Castiel is shocked to realize he feels happiness for the first time in what feels like forever.
“What they think really bothers you.”
Castiel nods to show he hears her, even though this is not a new conversation, and he feels desperate for a change in topic.
“Just a friend?”
“I don’t know. It’s hard to take them when I feel like I don’t deserve them.”
Sacramento is a lovely place. The weather is nice, the conference venue for the national meeting of the Ecotoxicology Society of America is easy to navigate. The host hotel is even nice.
“Cas!” She rushes forward and hugs him. “Nice to see you out of your lab.”
Castiel waits patiently while Dean extracts it, hyperfixated at the point where they are touching.
21:59 Meg:
Frustrated with himself on many levels, Castiel gives up on trying to write and heads into the lab. Maybe some late-night work will help get his mind off of the fact that he’s totally screwed.
Castiel feels his heart clench. Of course. Of course that’s going to be a part of the introduction.
“Not really.”
Dean leans his head back on the sofa. “Cassie. We met in undergrad when we were both journalism majors. I actually thought she might be the one. But then I switched to engineering to make my dad happy and we drifted apart. I like engineering, but Cassie and I had a huge fight about how much I do things to please my dad.”
Meg eyes Castiel. “You really don’t look that good. Which definitely means alcohol is a must.”
Cas continues staring at him, even though it’s got to be making him cross-eyed from being so close, and Dean feels relieved. Something deep inside of him is soothed by having all of Cas’ attention – it feels right in a way he tries not to think about too often.
Not exactly thrilled about the inevitable discomfort of wet, cold jeans, and yet unable to find any alternative, Dean kicks some snow aside and settles down next to Cas.
Nine hundred and sixty years. Nearly a thousand years of torture for Gabriel. Fuck.
down there?”
“You were rather distraught,” Cas points out.
Length: 20:34
Dean’s voice suddenly gets quiet. “Jamie Bamber?”
Castiel tries not to fidget. “About?”
Dean nods. “Yeah, it’s tough to see anyone looking like that.”
Billie nods but doesn’t say anything.
It’s a week after Labor Day and Dean and Castiel are sitting in Dean’s office trying to work on their group project.
15:20 Dean:
There’s no way he’ll actually make that deadline, but maybe he’ll magically feel better and remember how to do research again and stop living in this nonstop nightmare. And maybe he’ll split into two copies of himself who can manage to doubly avoid his life. That’s probably about as likely as him finishing right now.
this is a flashback
“We don’t need a break, we need to figure this out and–”
“Yes?”
“No. When I do have energy to do anything, I have more than enough work stuff to keep me busy. And classes are starting next week, so that’s going to eat up a lot of time.”
15:08 Castiel:
“And be sure you’re training the new tech.”
“Because the meds would help you get better.”
“Good to see you, Castiel. How are you doing?”
“You’ve skipped the last three X-Files nights. And you don’t talk to me anymore. If we weren’t good friends, I’d think I’d done something to upset you.”
Sorry about the delay! Had some unexpected RL stuff come up and it ate up all my podfic time. But this chapter is the longest yet, so hope that makes up for me not posting for a couple of days.
They have a great time cooking in Dean’s small apartment kitchen and playing video games and watching bad TV. It’s the best Thanksgiving Castiel can remember. Sam is hilarious and smart and it’s obvious that he and Dean are extremely close.
Closer. Their sweat mixes, Earthy alchemy; skin on skin, heaven on hell, life on immortality. Built and unbuilt and rebuilt. Dean crowds in on Cas as he finally enters him, his forehead pressed against Cas’, breathing in Cas’ gasps, stilling until the tension of the initial discomfort eases away. In the cage of their arms, locked around each other like bars, there’s nothing else. There’s no world outside of them. There’s no disapproving God watching. There is nothing else in life except this. The Shield and the Sword. Made for each other. To fight the world and protect each other.
Dean salutes her playfully, she smiles so wide it looks like it hurts. You can’t remember the last time you smiled like that, the last time you felt pain that didn’t hurt. She sits at the bar and Sam sits next to her, towering and gentle. You remember him. The Boy King. No longer a boy, his throne abdicated. Does he really have demon blood coursing through his veins? Hell is closed up now, sometimes a demon pops up here and there, but not like before, when the world was full of them, when all you did was exorcise and pray and holy water became a currency and left most of the community ordained ministers from variously dubious sites of divine origin, consecrated ground became the last stronghold against the end of the world. The future placed in the hands of Sam Winchester. Now you know the face. You struggle to imagine the Devil in his eyes, not when you’ve seen true evil.
Cas looks so sad. “Do you want to stop?”
Cas darts through the bar and into the dingy bathroom, where he sees Dean leaning against the sink, his face dripping with water, his eyes red and unfocused.
“Quite the opposite actually, they thought I- that we are involved.”
“You look tired. Are you staying the night? We have rooms.”
You feel ashamed for wondering how she made it far enough to meet the Winchesters.
“Cas? What the Hell are you-“
He laughs, the sound warmer than the sun, sweeter than birdsong. “Deal.”
The Winchesters are not similar enough to be clocked as brothers. But there’s something in the tilt of their shoulders and their hazel green eyes and the cadence of their voices that suggests kinship, brotherhood, forged in the fires of Hell and gilded by the light of Heaven. They’re just men, you realise. Earthly and solid and real, no more myth than the one you beheaded just the other night, it’s blood as real as the blood that marks them Winchester. Just like anyone else.
Inevitably, Dean has to drag himself away to the restroom, heavy-footed and more bow-legged than usual as he disappears through the bar into the darkness of the back.
Dean Winchester have saved the world?
‘You gonna explain?”
want.”
; he says otherwise, but you see divinity in his eyes, in his smile, in the way that he touched Dean, in the way he held his child.
Dean hooks his fingers under Cas’ chin and pulls him up into a kiss, enjoying the way Cas boxes him in, his strong arms planted either side, his heavy legs tangled between Dean’s. They kiss gently this time, soothed by the knowledge that more is coming, that they don’t have to get everything they can as fast as they can before it’s pulled away. He shimmies out of his jeans, kicking them to the end of the bed without even breaking their kiss.
They brush their noses against each other, testing each other’s resolve before they commit, giving each other one last chance to stop this madness. Then their lips meet and it’s over. Warm and soft, it’s almost chaste, could be described as sweet had someone witnessed it, full of tenderness and nervous energy. They pull apart and breathe heavily for a moment, letting the weight of the silence bare down on them, until Dean lunges forward again. The enthusiasm is appreciated, even if it means their teeth clash painfully at first contact, but it’s easily ignored. Their kiss is hard and deep, and Cas bring his hand up to cradle Dean’s face, and Dean fists Cas’ shirt like he’s afraid that the angel will try to leave. It’s sloppy and clumsy, their tongues slipping over each other like inexperienced teenagers. Which they kind of are here. It’s so new and alien and Dean wants so desperately for it to feel wrong, he tries hard to tap into the reservoir of repulsion he’s used as protection for so long, but it’s gone dry.
Dean rolls his eyes but it doesn’t cover up his blush. “You’ve- You’ve never, you know, done it with a guy before, right?”
The child murmurs something silently.
Cas nods like he understands what she means. When he looks over to the men who occupy the tables in the middle of the bar; all that’s missing from their fort is a flag planted in the middle to mark their territory. The message clear: outsiders not welcome. They’ve been watching Cas and Dean since they entered, but lots of local bars are like this; kept afloat by a regular crowd, supplemented by a steady stream of transient strangers who must wander in from the motel like they did. And Cas is used to be perceived as different by humans, they somehow sense that he is Other and often they do not react to it well. Although, Dean would say that’s because his “people skills” are “rusty.”
“No complaints yet,” you quip, daring to make a reference that exposes you both. Your fingers find the pin on your jacket, still oddly warm, already a comfort.
They don’t even have to drive anywhere because there’s a place in the lot next to the motel that is exactly what Dean is looking for. It doesn’t appear to be open, but Dean pushes through the door with the confidence of a guy who knows he’ll fit in anywhere. Cas hurries in behind him, looking around at all of the faces that have turned their way with all of the self-consciousness that Dean lacks.
“What about Katee Sackhoff?”
His excessively messy apartment provides little solace. All he can see is the dirty dishes on every surface in the kitchen, the mail piled up on the coffee table, the unfolded laundry on his tiny dining table. He knows he should do something about it. Anyone should be able to handle such simple chores. But not Castiel, no. His depressed ass is too incompetent to act like a normal adult.
Length: 5:44
Castiel wants to keep arguing – it’s been a while since he’s felt so fired up – but the unexpected softness in Dean’s face stops him short. “Okay. What do you suggest?”
Castiel shrugs. “He’s interesting, is all. Besides, I don’t have anything to offer even if I were somehow interested.”
Castiel considers changing the subject or maybe even lying and saying everything is just fine, but Gabriel reads him really well in person. Plus, he’s been feeling extra stressed lately, and it might be nice to get some of it off his chest.
“Mind if I join you?”
“No.” Castiel looks up. “I mean, if nothing else has gotten me to finish so far, why would this? If anything, I feel worse.”
“What– oh.” Dean lets out a frustrated sigh and thumps his head back onto his pillow. “The door.”
“I will attempt to distract him until your return,” Cas informs Sam.
“Who’s that?”
“Only thing is, I’ve never seen that show, so I’m not exactly sure what a - what did she say? - a ‘viper pilot’ is all about.”
“Do you know how many people stop taking their meds? You are definitely not alone, Castiel.”
“Um…” Castiel looks back down at his shoes. “I stopped taking them.” Then he adds in a rush, “And I do feel really bad about it, because I know I’m not exactly helping myself by doing that.”
“Nope,” says Dean, stopping next to him.
Meg smirks and leans back on the counter to assess the other assembled grad students. “I see Maggie and Harry are still sucking face on the regular.”

“Yeah, I sorta got that from the whole pissed off cat thing you’ve got going.”
. I have to finish the final reports before I present it to the agency.”
“Maybe you could let us in?” teases Sam and pushes past Dean. “Wow, this place is smaller than mine,” Cas hears Sam say as he gets a good look at the inside of Dean’s place.
He follows Crowley to the hallway, and he stops just outside the doors to the conference room.
“Thanks for saying so. That hasn’t always felt true, but you’re right. I hope your time in grad school is much smoother.”
Dean finds Cas on the roof of the bunker the night after they rescue Gabriel.
“Good. Now, I need the data from the nutrient analyzer by September 18
Castiel’s heart clenches. Making Charlie feel badly was never his intention. “No, no, no, you haven’t done anything.”
“Tricia Helfer?”
“I feel really alone. Sure, I have Charlie and Meg, but sometimes…sometimes I just really wish I had a companion. Someone I could really give all my love to and have it returned in kind. Not that I don’t love Charlie and Meg. I’m just looking for connection. A deeper one than just friendship.”
Castiel blinks. “I guess, yeah. He’s a good friend.”
“That would be lying.”
“Clarence, we’ve talked about this,” chides Meg with a gentle shove. “You are such a stick in the mud sometimes.”
“No, at ECU. Like, you’re too smart not to have finished yet. What happened?”
Castiel hears the guy yelp as Charlie probably elbows him. As a receiver of Charlie’s pointy elbows of discontent on occasion, Castiel can sympathize. But he’s in no mood to be around people right now, so it’s for the best if he just leaves. And he does.
Castiel follows Meg to the back to find an active party scene. The pool is over capacity, though the end with the diving board is open to what looks like a bellyflop competition. The top of what looks to be a home-made slip and slide is peaking over the top of the hill and there’s a line of laughing grad students waiting.
Well, that’s direct. “I’m fine, just swamped right now. I promise I’ll come to the next thing you have planned.”
“Actually, there’s data showing that alcoholism is–”
Cas raises an eyebrow.
Castiel half-heartedly returns the hug.
“I believe I was extremely successful on that front.”
Dean’s eyebrows shoot up. “Really? Like, Boomer doesn’t do it for you?”
His anxiety builds and builds all through everyone else’s intros, barely listening as the other grad students speak. And then all too soon Meg is wrapping up her intro and all eyes are suddenly on him.
“Assuming based on fact.”
“And?”
A plan begins forming in Castiel’s brain, but the alcohol makes it hard for him to keep hold of it.
s and
The first thing the Omega does is head straight for the bathroom, a long, hot shower definitely being in order after the day he's had.
“You have a serious problem, that's your brother you're talking about!”
When Dean leads them in, Castiel is surprised to note that despite its outer-appearance, the place looks really decent, with a bar set up in the middle and various tables and some booths on the outer edges set-up in a U-shape around the small dance floor and stage up front where someone was playing a soothing guitar piece. All in all, it was a good choice and he could definitely see he and Dean visiting this place frequently if given the chance after tonight.
Cas's mouth moves gently, yet firmly over his, the tip of the Alpha's tongue swiping over the seam of his lips, until the Omega opens up for him, but not before the Alpha's teeth graze and nibble against the plump flesh of his bottom lip, before delving in to deepen the kiss, thoroughly claiming the Omega's mouth for his own right there in the middle of the fucking bar.
“Yeah, turns out there's perks to dating the guy in charge’s brother. Gabe scheduled me to have the second shoot slot, and the group session was our first one, so I'm pretty much done for the day, thank god. I just gotta get changed real quick, then we can head out.”
The singer had gotten good at ignoring all the slander that was thrown at him, but there was just something about that one fucking article that had struck a chord in him, that hit too close to home and reaffirmed the thoughts that had slowly started to grow traction over the years, repeating the question over and over; whether he would be anything, anybody without all the fame. Without John. That what if he was just another empty vessel taking up space and air he had no right stealing from someone who deserved it more than he did.
Castiel bent his head, his breath fanning warm and moist as he whispered in Dean’s ear, “No marks, I promise,” he paused a moment before asking, “Do you want to stop?”
Before Castiel can answer, they both turn towards the sound of someone clearing their throat accompanied by a “Hey Cas,” from the opposite side of where Castiel had been looking to see if he could spot his Omega.
Sure, he could devour Vonnegut and sing praises to Tolkein, but this world was something else. It also hits him then that Cas deserved to be proud of the fact that he had gotten himself here, and it’s there that the Omega resolves to tell Cas exactly that the next time he tries to cover up his accomplishments by telling Dean anybody could do what he’s done in an attempt to make the Omega feel better about himself.
Ignoring the nerves that had suddenly sparked in his core, he leans in and asks, “Come on, let's go dance, yeah?”
“She got married eventually. Had the built in husband and kids she was always chasing. I don’t remember much about
A few hours pass by before they're finally done, paint dripping down the wall as Castiel and Dean fall back on the newspaper strewn floor in exhaustion.
“If you're ready, then...” Castiel trails off, their staring becoming a bit too long, even for them, as each takes in the sight of the other.
Scoffing at the Omega's words, Cas says, “It's alright, I've been told enough times to already know that it doesn't necessarily sound like the most glamorous job out there.”
The Alpha could say what he wanted, but Dean had known, a long time ago, before he had set his entire life’s goal on making sure his baby brother got to where he wanted to be, that these ivory towers weren’t made for him.
this was Dean's dream, and I just wanted the best for him, like any single father should want for their children.”
There aren't that many people here, even from what Dean could see back by the entrance, with large spaces being left between each couple or little group of people. Cas spots a tree that is far enough in the back where they could be relatively isolated, but not so much that they wouldn't be able to have a good view of the screen. He sets the basket and blanket down on the lush grass, and when he puts the legless collapse-able chair down, its only then that Dean realizes there's only one chair.
“That's the last of it,” Dean says as he gets up from his squatted position on the ground where he had busied himself with opening up all the tins of multi-coloured paint he had bought, while Castiel was finishing up with laying the newspaper on the floorboards.
Cas took a deep breath in, rubbing a hand over his brow as if it was exhausting and painful just speaking about this, but to Dean’s surprise, when he thought he should change the subject, that it was enough, more than enough for Dean to know, the writer went on, “The day I turned eighteen I booked it, I was with a really…” this time Cas was the one to gulp, words becoming muffled as if he couldn’t stand to say what came next, “A really great lady. The grandma type you know? A jackpot foster parent for anyone lucky enough to be placed with her. Her husband died young and she had been struggling with empty nest syndrome, driving her to get some kids back into her home. Heard I was her last. And I couldn’t blame her, I purposefully made it difficult for her and the day I left I stole the money I knew she had been saving for my first semester at college, and a few pieces of family jewellery too. Just enough to get me where I needed to be.”
He was a wolf in sheep's clothing, and Castiel would gladly use that knowledge, testing his own strategy as he says, “Dean seems to be handling things rather well from what I've seen, even for how
The Alpha sighed before admitting, “I’ve been feeling
From the moment the Omega had said goodbye to Cas when boarding that fucking metal death trap of a plane, to finally landing in Paris and getting started with his one-month long schedule of shows and shoots, he had felt wired up and all twisted up inside, like he was in a perpetual state of being at war with his emotions, never able to pin down how he was feeling before another took its place.
The silence stretches out between the two of them, Dean not being able to help himself when he keeps sneaking glances at the man sitting silently beside him, looking as if he had no intention of breaking his vow in not asking Dean questions once his guard was down. It's unsettling for the singer, with Cas not taking advantage of the situation since this would probably be one of the only times they'd be alone together by accident.
They had spoken a lot since their
At exactly eight, Dean had come knocking on his hotel door (it was one of the nicer ones booked, with even the single rooms having a flat screen smart TV, couch and queen bed). He had been fresh-faced with his hair still damp from the presumable shower he had taken before, wearing a pair of dark sweat pants and a hoodie, the picture of casual youthfulness.
His thoughts get derailed when suddenly he feels the soft touch of Cas’s lips on his cheek. It lasts for barely a second before the writer moves away, Dean looking up only to see his own stunned expression reflected back at him in the deep pools of Cas’s dark eyes. The kiss had been nothing but a peck, but the touch of them lingers, and the singer can’t help but place a hand there, trying to hold the feeling of those rough, chapped lips there a little longer.
Sam starts belting out in laughter at Dean's vexed look, and the singer covers his face when he can’t seem to get his cheeks to cool down.
Dean finally looks away, and looking up at the ceiling instead he says, “Guess you have a logical point there. But I dunno, don't think love's supposed to be about logic ya know? You just do what feels right I guess and besides, that shit's not supposed to be taken literally, him buyin' earrings an' all.
They both secretly knew that it was pretty much a done deal that they would be seeing each other after Dean mentioned he wasn't busy, he's just playing coy at this point, but it was fun, and Cas never seemed to mind when he teased him a little.
“See you got rid of the coat.” Dean says, having nothing else to say when the Alpha just sits there staring at him, not bothering to start the conversation. It was the first thing he noticed about the man's attire actually. His usual suit, tie and brown coat was replaced by a pair of dark washed jeans, a t-shirt that had two of the three buttons open at the top with a black leather jacket finishing off the look. Dean would have never guessed, judging by how he usually dressed, which was obviously his preferred choice of clothing, that Cas owned an outfit like this, but it looked good on him. Really good.
“Yes, well, Gabriel mentioned that I probably wouldn't be able to get through the door wearing it. Apparently, my clothes would be considered 'offensive' to the people here.” Cas replies, a displeased note making its way through his tone.
Cas raises their joined hands, and in a smooth, seamless move he twists Dean around until the Omegais standing in front of him, rather than alongside. His other hand going to Dean’s waist as the Omega lays a tentative hand on his shoulder, his body nervous as butterflies beat a relentless rhythm against his insides.
The Alpha shifts his hands until they're skimming along his waist and hips as they finally rest on his ass, the Alpha kneading the pliant flesh through his pants and Dean can't  help but let out a strangled mewl as the Alpha's fingertips move to rub along the crease where slick is slowly beginning to dampen the backs of his jeans.
Back when John had first told Dean about Cas, he had asked Sam to look into Cas, or more specifically his published articles with
and they want to do a piece on you.”
Castiel had always thought he was incapable of being loved, so utterly ruined and marred by life that he didn’t think
“Oh, shut up and just take me to bed already.” Dean responds, deliberately shifting his hips, making the hard line of the Alpha's cock brush up against his ass. And with the loud groan the Alpha lets out at this action, it's his chance to give Cas his own smug look.
“Mmm, I think I like it when you beg me, Dean,” Cas says, the Omega finding it both infuriating  and arousing as hell that his voice sounds so controlled while Dean is one big wreck squirming  beneath him. into his ear as he removed his fingers, making Dean whine out pitifully at the sudden loss of fullness.
But there is one thing Castiel's still confused about, “So why did you call for me?”
“I-I-I'm sorry, d-dad, I j-just...I didn't m-mean to...” Dean tried to stammer out, words refusing to come as the back of his eyes started stinging from the tears he held in check as he just stood there, limbs locked up and rooting him to the spot as he looked down at the grey concrete floor.
's, but it's the litany of the
Castiel can't help but raise an eyebrow at that, even though he knows how they had been trying to find some common ground, some way to make their arrangement work. Their first attempt hadn't gone so well, it was new territory even Castiel had limited experience with, and making their dynamic and set-up more like an interview had gone horribly wrong.
The Omega knew he was getting a little over worked-up and dramatic, but it seemed as if his Omega instincts were right at the surface, controlling this show, and he could barely restrain himself from scent marking the Alpha right there in front of everybody. He was feeling a bit on edge what with his own claim on Cas being threatened like that, well sort-of claim anyway, and scent marking was one of the only physical ways Omega's could claim Alphas since they never had the same heightened instinctual drive to bite and mark up an Alpha's mating gland, not that they had them in the first place.
After that, conversations between them had suddenly dried up to the bare minimum of discussing Dean's schedule and interviews and a strange part of himself couldn't help but feel thankful that maybe, all this would just mean that the final blow wouldn't be so hard for Sam to take the second time around, the knowledge consoling him, knowing deep down that this fucked up situation was all for the better in the end.
For a second, his Omega side had almost spoken for him, wanting to plead with its Alpha to come to his distressed mate, but he had forced those needy instincts back, and asked for the closest thing he could get right then, “Just wanna hear your voice Cas, tell me about your classes today.”
to happen.
“Shit,” is all Castiel manages to get out, body still moving inside the wetness of his Omega as he realizes his knot had been growing, something that only ever was supposed to happen during an Alpha’s rut.
“Huh, didn't think you'd notice that,” Dean responds in kind turning in the Alpha's arms so he's sitting more to the side than in front of him, furrowing his brow. He never thought Cas had paid that much attention to his behaviour.
Castiel wants to deny it, wants to say his brother was wrong, but something inside him perks up at what the Beta is saying, a deep hidden part of himself suddenly standing at attention. But the Alpha still feels that bite of apprehension clawing its way up his throat as he stares into the gold liquid swirling in his cup, “Even if what you’re saying
“Mm, I'm impressed, seems we have. Is it any good?”
embarrass me again, do you understand me boy?”
“Of course you didn’t go, though in hind sight my enthusiasm and effort didn’t seem that much worth it, did it? Never even got my slow dance.”
your company Alastair, so if you could take your hands off me and leave me alone
“Somehow, I don't think being without scent blockers, surrounded by horny people grinding against each other and practically breathing down my neck, would be such a good way to relieve stress.” Although she had a point that he liked to dance and when in the right company it was a great way for him to just let go, he didn't have the energy for stranger's making unwanted advances on him. After he had stopped using scent blockers about four year's ago, dancing in crowded, seedy clubs was definitely a big no-no for him. About the only place he felt comfortable enough doing that these days was at The Roadhouse, where he knew the company would be good.
Looking him up and down, not even playing at being discreet about it this time, the singer can’t help but roll his eyes at the writer, because of course he couldn’t leave behind the ever-present trench coat, even though it was almost ninety-five degrees outside, the evening air lending only a warm breeze.
The Alpha isn't far behind, the feeling of Dean's muscles tightening around him causing him to fly over the edge, but before he can pull himself out of the warm, wet heat like he plans to do, he feels Dean's body clamp down around him once more as the Omega turns is head, and with hooded, begging eyes whispers, “Inside, please Cas, need you inside me.”
in it, I guess, which is a good thing.”
“When is your next show?” Castiel asks out of the blue once Dean opens his eyes again.
Moving,
The Alpha sometimes felt like such a hypocrite whenever he reassured Dean that being an Omega wasn't a curse and it wasn't something he should hide from, that he should instead embrace being who he was, but as much as that were true, as much as he
Dean took back everything he said about even remotely understanding fashion, he looks and feels ridiculous in this outfit right now, and says as much, “I look like an idiot, how the hell am I supposed to look glamorous or what the fuck ever, when I look like a walking, talking breakfast table?!”
Castiel just sits there on his bed, staring incredulously at Dean, completely flabbergasted at the ridiculousness of what Dean had just said, and he wants to tell the omega as much. But looking at Dean, at how his hands fidget in front of him, how he avoids Castiel’s eyes, and the smell of the sharp, sour notes colouring his wonderful apple pie scent, he realizes that the omega truly believes what he's saying, believes that when it came down to it, beyond his looks, he wasn't worth the attention or
Castiel knew he was staring, but he couldn't seem to take his eyes off the beautiful Omega. He was wearing a pair of ripped, black skin tight jeans and a baggy t-shirt that had various holes slashed into them.
, out of his head for one moment so he could just fucking breathe.
The incessant blare of his phone ringing out in the quiet, small space of his room is what brings Sam out of the deep sleep he had gladly welcomed after crashing straight into bed late last night, having had to endure the gruelling double shifts he took on at the auto-shop for the past coupl'a days.
“Judging by that dopey, heart-eyed look you just had on your face, are you sure it’s just ‘having a little fun’ for you?” Jo questions, as she comes around his chair to lean against the white dresser.
Grumbling and bemoaning his actions, not wanting the Alpha to move an inch from their warm cocoon the Omega has to soon relent as he shifts enough to grant Cas space to finally stand up.
a task this business is, maybe you could speak with him on how better to keep track and stay on top of everything if you're forgetting to schedule meetings. No harm in needing some advice after all.”
Castiel moves the flowers to his other hand and reaches out to shake the pro-offered hand, before something strikes him as strange.
He knew a big part of why he was feeling the way he was right now had a lot to do with just missing his Alpha. There was a deep need and want that he couldn't shake, his Omegan instincts not knowing or
It was several minutes of Cas’s teeth biting down as hard as he dared, lips soothing over the marks, but the singer knew this time they were there to stay for much longer. His fingers curling inside him as they stretched him as wide as they could, though Dean knew Cas’s cock would still burn on the way in, and he couldn’t fucking wait anymore.
Although that probably had more to do with the fact that they weren’t exactly called correction institutions, instead they were masked as camps that were meant to ‘save’ Alphas from their own natural inclinations and instincts, save them from being mindless ‘knotheads’ and brutes, as they were taught how to behave in more proper and civil manners, so they could end up being more productive members of society.
After getting their orders in the form of small red baskets filled with a mountain of fries, onions, and their cheese burgers together with their plastic cups of soda, they walked on back to the deserted deck.
“Since we're so close to the top of the mountain it's a lot colder up here and besides, I thought you would enjoy the extra layering since you do run a little colder than normal.” The Alpha notes, having observed this quirk whenever Dean had been bundled up in layers of clothing, even when it was ninety degrees out.
“Jo said you get them often, the migraines, why is that?” Cas asks once Dean finishes with the lunch, not bothering to hide his curiosity from the Omega.
Still, that was probably too much for Dean to hear right then, not with the tail spin of thoughts he was going down, and all Sam ends up saying is, “Maybe, maybe not. Would still wish him a happy birthday if I were you though, just sayin'.”
In a distant sort of way, Castiel knew he was being rude and a complete jerk the moment the words were out of his mouth, but it was too late to filter them out first. And it didn't help matters when he saw out of the corner of his eye how Dean started to bite his lip, a pinched expression forming on his face as he turned his body away from the writer, from where only moments ago it had subconsciously drifted until Dean was facing him more fully.
“Pft, who said I was imaging my brother?” Gabe says, giving the Omega a leery once over and a flirty wink to top it all off, “I mean, those fried eggs are really working for you today, they just make your eyes pop!”
what Dean had been expecting when Cas said they were going to watch a movie. It had taken them about twenty minutes to make their way to this apparent destination, which to Dean's surprise was the well-known hiking trails that if travelled from the opposite side of the mountain where they were, would lead hikers to green garden fields located up on the ridge of a mountain.
haven't?”
Dean slouches down in his chair and knocks his head against the table, reciting, “Stupid, stupid, stupid...”, as he waits for the sting of rejection and the suspicious burn behind his eyes to go away.
Sighing exasperatedly, Castiel decides maybe this was what he needed, to talk it out, get some advice from his friends, they were a chaotic bunch, but he knew when push came to shove, they were always there to help each other out. Gabriel was good at giving advice, when the occasion called for it, but he had already said his piece on the matter and Castiel needed help with
Dean didn't know what to do with Cas's compliment, not that he could help the warmth that spread across his face, but ultimately he decides to let it settle under a change of topic, not forgotten but not acknowledged either, since Cas looked slightly uncomfortable with the slip of words, and Dean says, “I've read some of the work you wrote, they're pretty good.”
The Omega takes his time in the shower, making sure to scrub his skin clean from the grubbiness of having slept for more than twelve hours, before moving on to wash his hair for good measure as well.
Losing his steam, Sam deflates as he hunches over again, and when he sees Bobby moving out of the corner of his eyes, probably in an effort to console him or some shit like that, which he knows he doesn't deserve, the Alpha moves his shoulder away, making it so that the Beta's fingers barely brush the sleeve of his arm, “Don't. It's better this way. Dean doesn't need any of this right now, he's a very public figure, I'll just cause more problems.”
When the sweet smell of the Omega's slick arousal hits him, kissing isn't enough for the Alpha anymore. In a flash, Castiel moves until he completely covers Dean's body, hips instinctively grinding down in repeated motions, stimulating them both to the point that they're mewling and growling respectively, panting harshly as Dean spreads his legs to frame the Alpha's hips so he can better slide over the Omega's body.
He comes face to face with a brown-haired Alpha who’s staring straight at him with light blue eyes, the intensity of the look strangely reminding him of Cas.
why were his thoughts even going there right now?!
On the other hand he also couldn't deny that
“Does this have anything to do with that little meeting you had, then?” Dean asks wearily and somewhat cheekily as he states the obvious.
And there they sat together in silence afterwards, side by side, but seemingly worlds apart, both watching the sun finally crest over the mountain, up, up into the now cloudless blue sky until the view became nothing but another day and they became Castiel Novak,
Afterwards, they lie under the covers, legs tangled together while Dean has his head pillowed on Cas's chest, hands swirling patterns there as the Alpha methodically cards his fingers through his slightly damp strands and around his ear. The Omega had been resistant to this type of intimacy at the beginning when he realised just how much he liked it and never wanted to get too used to the gentle caresses, but Cas had proved to be a rather persuasive and tactile person in his own way, so Dean eventually let up.
that he was feeling, and more than not wanting to look too closely in acknowledging what it was, he wanted desperately for it to just go the fuck away.
“Baby bro! You made it!” Gabriel shouts from across the room, voice barely making it over the sound of the music coming through the speakers and causing a few heads to turn at the suit and cloak clad figure, with the boom of his voice.
Dean quickly gets up from his seat, hearing a very displeased grunt from the Beta, not that he could care less about that, as he goes to Cas's side. The Alpha still has his eyes glued to the Beta, so Dean touches his shoulder to get him to look at him instead. When Cas finally shifts his focus to him, he can see a spark of surprise there when the Alpha turns his head to stare at the Omega's hand that was touching his sleeve.
Licking his lips and looking up at the Alpha through heavy eye lids, Dean moves his hips so that his ass once again brushes against the front of Cas's jeans. If that display wasn't obvious enough for the man, Dean moves his head to the side of Cas's and breaths in a husky voice, thick with desperation and arousal, “Want you inside me, Alpha.”
But with the effects of the anxiety meds only now wearing off, the numbing side effect still partially present, which made everything a bit foggy, was not an ideal situation to be in when he had to put on a smile and be coherent enough to carry on conversations while talking to people. Dean managed to pull through though, and he was very much ready to just head on over to his hotel room and conk out for the rest of the night.
“Last time I checked, someone throwing themselves all over my Alpha is my business,” the Omega shoots back, exposing his neck slightly, with a smirk of satisfaction making its way on his lips when he sees her haughty expression slip as the other Omega spots the red-tinged mark on his neck that's still pretty visible since Cas seemed to enjoy marking him up everytime they were in the same room together.
It wasn't exactly the emotional ups and downs he usually felt during his pre-heat stage, they felt bigger, and more stifling and suffocating. Dean would've in fact preferred if it was simply a matter of him going into heat (although, that wouldn't happen for another month or so), since it never made him feel this much on edge. He had had shoots and shows scheduled whilst he was practically in the middle of a full-blown heat before, as in most cases they weren't as all-consuming and mind jarring as people made them out to be. Omegas' heats and Alphas' ruts usually narrowed down to a heightened chemical and hormonal imbalance of their secondary gender characteristics vying for control over their primary ones, with Betas' being a little more complex than that since they showed fewer internal changes in their neutrality, and experienced states of either heats or ruts depending on their primary genders.
Raising his hands, palms up, he shakes his head as he replies, “Oh, no don't look at me, I'm a terrible singer,” giving the Omega a mischievous smirk he adds as an afterthought, “although, I would most definitely pay money to hear you sing, Dean.”
It was comforting in a way for the Alpha, to know that  that Dean must have been just as unsure about how this would go and how Castiel would react, albeit clearly for different reasons, but he didn't think telling the Omega he would have found Dean just as beautiful even if he were wearing a paper bag right now to be such a good idea, since that could make it sound as though Castiel didn't appreciate the efforts he obviously put in to his appearance tonight.
Before the Omega can continue with his mini-tirade, Castiel pulls him closer to his body as he dips his head down to plant a long, lingering kiss to the Omega's lips, knowing that he needed some form of physical contact to relax his Omegan instincts, with Dean not minding the PDA one bit at that moment, gladly deepening the kiss as his tongue delves in to claim the Alphas lips.
But they weren’t enough, when once he knew they probably could have been, though things had shifted between them, things were different now and Castiel could feel safe knowing he could admit to himself that he missed his Omega, more than he thought was probably normal at this point. He missed Dean down to his core. He missed his whiskey deep yet soft voice. He missed those plump bow-shaped lips that could be so sweet yet so seductive at the same time. He missed the Omega’s bow shaped legs wrapped tightly around the hard contours of the Alphas body. He missed ravaging the Omegas body and being inside of Dean, feeling that give of his soft flesh, inside and out, to his unyielding ministrations. He missed the constant wake-up calls, the mornings when Dean or he stayed the night because they never wanted to be apart, although none of them would admit it and simply beg exhaustion or it being late.
If John wanted to speak with him he would go, listen to what he had to say, and leave. Simple as that. If John wanted to play this game of cat and mouse, seeing who would get the upper hand in the end, who would be the one in the higher position of power, he could play it all by himself.
Raising one dark, thick eyebrow at Dean’s once again out of the blue request, the writer looks on in pure scepticism, not trusting the playful look adorning his perfect face one bit,  “Oh, and where, pray tell, am I agreeing to go with you?”
, stop asking questions, stop looking at him like he was this broken
All the while the writer’s eyes were solely focused on his face, looking for any sign of discomfort and at the intense, concerned look; Dean couldn’t help smiling up at him, lips red and kiss swollen and soft, his green eyes staring back into the handsome face above his own.
It was the first concert of his world tour, and it was decidedly not going well. Usually Dean had a better handle on his nerves when it came to his performances, but this was one of the biggest sold-out shows he had ever had, and the moment he heard the screams and shouts from the tens of thousands of people who filled the stadium seats from where he was backstage, the thought of going out there and becoming the sole focus of all that attention, having all those eyes watching and judging, hanging onto every word he said and seeing every action he made on the large mounted screens on either side of the stage made his brain short circuit, while simultaneously making his lungs feel as if they were collapsing in on themselves.
“Can you invite me into your room now?”
“Goodbye, Dean.” Castiel says instead, ushering the Omega out the bedroom.
It all left Dean one panting, shaking and flushed mess, but one sharp nip to the space where his shoulder and neck met had him gasping out, a mixture of pain and pleasure taking over as a delicious shiver ran through him, yet at the same time it had him pulling Cas’s mouth away with a slight tug of his hand that was still curled in his hair, the writer moving easily away.
Which to no-one's surprise, earns resounding groans and eye rolls from the models at his attempt at humour, with Dean just letting out a snort as he shakes his head at the playful Beta.
Cas couldn’t fix him, nobody could, not even himself. It still didn’t stop him from wanting to give Cas the same thing he had given the singer in return though, a space where he could let out what the singer knew was on his mind probably the entire day, probably his entire
Before Dean can even decline, the Alpha is already getting up, so all he says is, “Sure, thanks Cas.” Not like he had much to drink seeing as that was the only beer he had for the night and he'd been sipping on it ever since he took up his spot in the corner.
Cas looked away this time, not being able to meet Dean’s eyes as he said, “That she simply didn’t and had never wanted me. It was as simple as that Dean, she had never wanted me.”
Funny how that worked, Cas wasn't even there, yet he gave this to Dean. Gave him back a moment of something he thought he had destroyed and burned to ashes forever. But here it was, their easy banter brought to life as if it had never been gone, with Cas right at its centre. Sam's bright laughter aimed at him. Their words flowing easy and assured.
re-runs.
“Cas?” the Alpha hears Dean’s thick, drowsy voice call out into the small space between them.
He had always wondered, from the moment up on that rooftop to the night he asked Cas to write his story, what it was about the writer that drew him to the man, why he chose to trust Cas the most, why he chose to share his secrets with this cold, unresponsive person. And now he knew. Cas made him feel safe.
It was all so enthralling and terrifying and exhilarating and fucking painful all at once, and the writer didn't know if he even wanted any of what was going on between them to stop. He was scared of how much
Before he could think more on it, before he even knew what he was doing, his hand had made it to that space between Cas’s thighs, first feeling the change in texture from those sparse, soft strands of hair to the rough, wiry, thicker thatch of hair between the man’s legs, and then,
Because at the end of the day, Bobby knew deep inside, the both of them were still those same two scared little boys who had ran and cried out after John as his car drove away down that same old dirt road at the bottom of Sam's window. Their father never being one to hesitate and leave his sons at the Beta's doorstep whenever his wayward ways called him to the open road, and one who came crawling back each and every time his Omega nature drew him back to the children of the Alpha he wished he'd never submitted to, something Bobby knew was the biggest regret of his friend's life, once he was faced with the reality of having to raise their children alone when she died in that godforsaken house fire. And looking at Sam now, and remebering back to Dean's defensivness whenever Bobby had tried to draw him in with his own gruff version of affection, the Beta knew Jonh Winchester had never been one to hold back in showing them just how much they were unwanted and unloved.
then. Yes, that suits you very well, in my opinion.”
And then Dean froze beneath him, body clamped up, lips cold and unresponsive  against his warm ones, voice stuttering out with a tone that was so fucking brittle and thick it made the writer’s own heart ache, “Y-you what?”
But with that, Dean suddenly feels tired, it had been a long, sleepless flight and race to get here, he tries hiding the yawn but Hannah, smiling gently at the sleepy Omega notices.
It takes a little longer than he would have liked to get to where he needed to be, stopping once or twice to ask for directions from some random students, the Omega thankful that nobody had recognised him so far. Not that he was stopped often by strangers on the street, but it only ever took one person before he had others soon following, even when he could tell some never even knew who he was.
It was enough of a problem that over the years Naomi had assigned him less and less of the younger pop stars since they tended to not know how to handle his direct attitude very well, with the first few times he was tasked to write an article on one or two of them ending in law suit threats against not only him but the magazine too if they ever published whatever article Castiel was going to write about them after he unintentionally managed to offend their character. Castiel found their actions to be rather dramatic, but he supposed that's what happened when they were surrounded by
This was as far as the directions she had given went, and he realizes then in his excited stupor he hadn’t thought to question what came after.
Swallowing around his suddenly dried out mouth, Dean couldn’t help but try and comfort Cas in some way, even if the words that came out were probably the most generic thing to say at that moment, “I’m sorry that happened to you Cas,” and his stupid, stupid, brain actually tried to give Cas some type of reassurance, even though the words leaving his mouth felt wrong and meaningless, “M-maybe she meant to come back and couldn’t find you or maybe she was going through something and just thought you’d be better off without her,” Dean knew that last part was more of a projection, a suggestion borne from his own need to try and understand his own mom’s actions as he got older. It was the one explanation he always clung to, wishing and praying it was why she decided to leave him behind when she wrapped that rope around her neck and tied to her bedroom’s ceiling fan.
Castiel chats with Meg for a while longer, watching Dean from the corner of his eye, trying to be sly. From Meg’s shit-eating grin, he knows he’s not being as subtle as he hopes.
Billie gives him a thoughtful look. “Do you believe that coming to understand yourself as being ace has contributed to this?”
But the email he’d received at eight this morning had made his whole being deflate.
“I have experienced grief many times since my creation, none so painful as the times when I harmed you and Sam, or when you died or were grievously injured, or when my siblings were cast out of Heaven by Metatron, or when I realized the enormity of suffering I had caused after absorbing the Purgatory souls.

Charlie looks ready to protest, but a new wave of arrivals come in the front door and she has to hurry over to greet them, leaving him and Meg alone.
“No. Kinda? I don’t know. I haven’t really told anyone but Sam that I’m bi. Well, my dad suspects and gave me hell for it.”
Castiel huffs a hollow laugh. “No. I do.” No, he doesn’t. He’d much rather be home and alone right now.
15:02 Castiel:
Castiel blinks. And then nods. “Yeah, that sounds good.”
“And you don’t feel like you deserve to get better.”
Billie just rolls her eyes. “You are such a scientist sometimes.”
“Good.”
“Welcome to the annual Environmental Science program meet and greet luncheon. For those of you who don’t know, I’m Dr. MacLeod, director of the program here at ECU.” He pauses, and Castiel wonders if he’s expecting applause. “Now, the purpose of this meeting is to get to know one another and make everyone aware of any new departmental policies. You can have lunch and socialize as soon as we take care of business. Understood?”
“Can’t say I particularly love this shindig either. Having to see Crowley’s smug face just once a year is still too often. But you,” she pulls a face. “You’re being downright hostile. What’s up your butt?”
Length: 6:19
Of all of his brothers and sisters, Gabriel is Castiel’s favorite. Not just because they’ve stayed in constant contact while he’s been in grad school, but because Gabriel is the black sheep of the family, and in their family, that is actually a good thing in Castiel’s opinion.
“Why do you think I quit school and became a baker? To piss off Mom? Yeah, and because it was something I chose and something that fulfills me.”
Ecotoxicology Research Facility
“The same.”
Castiel rolls his eyes. “How many times am I going to have to tell you that it’s still Castiel? Or ‘Cas’ as you and others are so fond of saying.”
One bright spot during the week is the fact that Dean has been texting him nonstop since he left.
Castiel is miserable. He’s presenting work he’s done for Naomi but wishes he were presenting his own dissertation work instead. Of course, it’s not finished, so that’s not possible, but it doesn’t stop him from dwelling on it.
Not just watching Battlestar. Dean invites Castiel to come to the university gym with him and Castiel accepts, feeling less self-conscious since all the students are gone and he knows Dean won’t judge him. Castiel actually finds he enjoys gym time, and even though it’ll be a while before he sees any obvious results of working out, the change in his mood is noticeable. Plus, he has always liked running, so it feels good to get back into that.
“Are you still game for X-Files tonight?”
Sulking, he lets Crowley’s announcements wash over him after the last student reports their introduction. None of them matter anyway – he’s doesn’t have to worry about paperwork submission deadlines or course creation forms or international student concerns, so he focuses on the table in front of him. When can it be time for lunch so he can just grab his box and leave?
“I also had to blow off Charlie and one of her X-Files parties because I was feeling so bad after the meet up. She’s forgiven me, but I haven’t been able to spend any time with my friends lately because I don’t want to bring them down, too.”
Castiel looks down at his shoes. “I had to go to that annual departmental meet up on Wednesday. The one where all the grad students get together before the semester starts to catch up. It was as awful as usual.”
“Hello, Dean.”
Castiel looks up from his undrunk coffee. Charlie is giving him a sympathetic look, and although he would rather prevaricate, Charlie is one of his oldest friends and is good at getting reluctant people talking.
Office: 555-555-2394
Castiel shifts on the sofa. “Yeah.”
“Ah ah ah,” chides Crowley. “Tells us how many years, Mr. Novak. Everyone else has done so.”
The floor drops out from under Castiel’s feet. “Spring?”
“Finish, I guess.”
"I don’t know. Thing is, no matter what I choose, there's pain ahead. I can't avoid it, I tried avoiding things and it's just ruined me. I mean, look at me. I’m out of shape, I’m passively suicidal, I’m a complete mess. How can I possibly finish and what will finishing even really do for me?"
Dean doesn’t say anything for a long moment, so Castiel looks over at him. Dean is looking down at his lap. “You ok?”
Dean lets Cas huddle against him and relishes this easy closeness. He tells himself he’s letting the nearness linger on the pretense of it being cold, but knows it’s for another unspoken reason entirely. And he ignores the hopeful leap of his heart as Cas lays his head down on Dean’s shoulder and exhales deeply.
15:10 Dean:
“Thanks, Cas.”
Dr. Milton,
“It keeps me busy. It’s not like there’s much else to keep life fun around here.”
Castiel stares at the email from his advisor for the seventh time that morning.
“Cas?”
“Well, I did say antagonizing her probably wasn’t the smartest move,” points out Sam with raised eyebrows.
“You should. Even if you weren’t into Pokémon ages ago, it’s still fun.”
“How was your committee meeting?”
“Well, Crowley gave me an ultimatum a couple of months ago – finish by spring or get kicked out of the program.”
Dean hums in sympathy. “We have plenty of Battlestar to get through still, so it’s a date.”
And Dean smiles at him.
“Don’t worry, Charlie. It’s a party. Plus, I’ll keep track of our little angel.
Cas considers this, then says, “God made the archangels the strongest of all of us, absolute, but he did not make them invincible. Gabriel will not be the same. Maybe will never be the same again.”
15:15 Dean:
“I suppose.”
“So, I was chatting with Charlie yesterday.”
A thoughtful look crosses over Dean’s face. “You mean asexual?”
What is he supposed to say to that? Thanks for deprioritizing me even though I know why? Also, you’ve had my chapters for almost twelve months, what does ‘quickly’ even mean to you? Also, chapter 3 is a mess and I haven’t written a word in months?
Perhaps you don’t mean to, but you eyes flicker to the rainbow flag over the doorway. You notice more stuck in glasses on the shelves, some of them rainbow, some of the blue-purple-pink bands, some of them orange-white-pink. What is it like? You know what people say behind his back, what they’ve always said, the people in the know. The men who had paid for a moment with Dean Winchester, the men who had gotten one for free, the men who had hoped for either, for anything. They still call him names.
Except they have claimed each other. You heard Dean is branded, a scar of a handprint seared into his skin, a memento from when they met. They met in Hell. Castiel touched his soul and raised him from Hell and fell in love with him, literally fell. Who would love you if they had seen your soul? Seen the personal realm of Hell you curated? Can you even love yourself?
“First time.”
shoulder; his warm, living handprint crossing over the marred skin of the brand. The sounds of a TV come faintly through the wall. A car roars to life in the parking lot. Someone walks past the window, throwing a brief shadow over them. All reminders that they do not exist within a vacuum, that whatever happens in this motel room, it will leave with them, and they cannot run from that.
In the blink of an eye, he pulls his fist back and throws a badly aligned punch that Cas easily evades. He ducks out of the way, side-stepping out of his reach, even though it would hurt him more than Cas if he actually landed a hit, it wasn’t worth the drama of it. The guy stumbles towards Cas, enraged with his impotency, and tries to go for a good old fashioned tackle. Thankfully he’s wasted and it doesn’t take any unusual skill to keep out of range, so instead, he picks up too much momentum and crashes into a table hard enough to go flying over it. Unfortunately, that apparently signals war.
“You wanna go all the way with me, Cas?” Dean jokes, grinning that lopsided smile that’s broken hearts up and down the country. “Swipe your v-card at my register?”
“Glasses.”
You laugh. “Like father, like daughter.”
You don’t know. You’re not used to having choices. Simple choices, selfish ones, luxurious ones: if you want fries or steak-cut chips, American or Swiss, IPA or stout or lager, light or dark, or spirits. It embarrasses you, how difficult it is, in the face of meaninglessness, how do you fare?
. But he never taps out. He gives more. He offers himself up like communion.
“Dean, I-“
And if it’s good enough for Dean, it’s good enough for Cas. For all his complaining, at least Cas never has an issue with the physical demands of the job, not like Sam, who never misses a chance to lecture Dean about DVT and RSI and anything else that has a neat little three-letter-acronym. Not that his lack of nagging is the reason that Dean likes doing hunts with just Cas. They just get on, you know? A few hiccups here and there, but they’ve always got each other, and now, they’re just as a formidable hunting duo as Sam and Dean are. Claire would say they
His voice is so low it’s like traffic from a highway just out of sight from your motel room, that when you lie in the dark becomes part of your body, as essential to your existence as the thudding of your heart and the huffing of your lungs and the buzzing from the dying lights in the walkway outside. It’s atomic. It’s celestial.
Once you save the world, you can have it too.
“Thanks.”
, there in his eyes is the softness that they had been missing.
He chuckles darkly at Cas’ simplicity. “Is that what you want? Just sex? We fuck tonight and never talk about it again? And swear it’ll never happen again every time it does?” He clenches his jaw. “I can do that.”
The door clicks closed and you’re left alone. Your head feels fuzzy and full and empty at the same time, and you wonder how you got here. You wonder it a lot. Every time you’re searching for a hunt, driving to one, checking your weapons, reading the lore, tracking down a creature that has no right to exist.
“Ah, Sweet Dreams. How did you like it?” He tilts his head, a little more than most people would, reminiscent of a puppy, of the velociraptors in that film, assessing your prey potential. You’re aware of his magnitude. You’re aware of your insignificance.
“As a werepire.”
Haven’t you heard? They’re in love.
They drink in silence. Cas unable to switch off, picking at the damp label and shifting in his seat, he stares at the sad tinsel taped up along the shelves behind the bar. He'd forgotten that it is now December, which meant Christmas. They had never paid that much attention to the holiday, Sam and Dean usually made sure they were working a case or at least travelling on the day itself. At first they were surprised that Cas wasn't more into it, until he reminded them that Christmas, meaning the 25th of December, actually had very little to do with Jesus' birth and was merely a date appropriated from the Pagan festival of Yule when Christianity was being forced upon the Celts. He did enjoy the decorations though.
“That’s intense.”
‘Personal space, Cas,” Dean whispers. “We’ve, uh, talked about this Probably why they thought-“ But he trails off, his eyes drifting towards Cas’ lips. Pink and parted slightly. His tongue peeks out over his bottom lip, teasingly, as if reminding Dean that he does have a tongue, that he could
“Who the fuck taught you to be so rude?”
Bottles collect quickly in front of them. Somehow, Dean doesn’t realise that Cas is still nursing his second one and he’s been drinking both of their drinks for some time. He gets louder and more obnoxious. His hand landing heavily on Cas’ shoulder after almost everything he says; sometimes it stays there for a long time afterwards, until he drags it away suddenly like he’s been burnt. He doesn’t notice how the angel sighs every time. Cas doesn’t even notice it himself.
He swallows
It must work because he softens. He pours the dessert in a glass even though you didn’t order it and places it in front of you, next to the glass he places something small and shiny, he doesn’t wait for you to acknowledge it. It’s a metal pin. The silver knotted into a symbol you don’t know, impressively intricate for the size, and when you hold it, it feels unusually warm. You remember the way Dean’s ring caught the light, throwing it more than it should, almost giving off its own light, almost glowing. Whatever it is made of, this is its sibling. You pin it to your jacket, on the left lapel, the proximity to your heart neither deliberate nor indeliberate. It pleases him. You pleased him.
Or will it be happy?
“Can I help you?”
“Where is he?” He gestures to the back and they disappear. He looks after them, his face soft and open; you can’t imagine him torturing souls in Hell.
Dean glances around before moving in, pressing his body against Cas’. “Wanna collect one from every state?”
Cas blinks at him incredulously. Does this man ever
“God, he is too good at that.” Dean interrupts loudly, pressing his face into the back of Castiel’s shoulder. “I always fall asleep putting him down.”
“But freaks like you, you gotta learn you can’t just go wherever you like, flashing your perversity for everyone to see.”
it. Dean actually wasn’t sure if Cas got aroused; he’d never caught him having alone time or anything in all the years they’d been together, so he assumed he just didn’t need it. No wonder he kisses like he’s going to eat Dean’s face off, the poor guy’s got the bluest balls in the history of mankind.
You smile at his humanness. “I didn’t feel propositioned.”
“Gentlemen, there’s really no need for this,” Cas says calmly, his palms up in surrender. “I don’t want to fight anyone.”
Maybe you haven’t seen him since before John died, or before he went to Hell, or before he killed God(?), but that doesn’t matter. Maybe you read the books, enjoying being in the know, enjoying that you enjoy them differently from all the other people that enjoy them, for better reasons. Maybe his name is a myth passed from Hunter to Hunter, monster to monster, or between the two (is there a two? You try not to think about this too much). Older now, so much older than he could’ve ever hoped for. Masculine in every way you hope to be masculine, if you really understand what it means, but by hoping and understanding you fail. He’s tall and broad shouldered, and wears a flannel shirt over a band tshirt and dishtowel over his shoulder, and his jaw is sharp and hard and stubbled, and his eyes framed by deep crow’s feet; he sees you and you feel seen. His forearms are too tanned for the season, but you’re distracted by how they flex under the skin, and his hands are big and rest on the wood in front of you, just hands now, but they might as well be an armoury for all the death they’ve caused.
“For God’s sake, man,” Dean suddenly says. “Can you take the stick outta your ass for like, five seconds?”
He swallows the cock head, sucking on the soft, swollen flesh with more vigour than he should, overstimulating Cas from the offset. The rewards are immediate: a sharp pull of his hair, nails dig into his shoulder, a breathy groan. Exactly his plan. There’s a fight to keep Cas’ thighs apart, to keep his hips on the bed so he doesn’t choke Dean, so he can actually get the job done, but Dean is more than pleased with the fact that Cas is coming undone under his touch. He whimpers when Dean teases the very tip with his tongue, softly, barely touching it; and when takes him deep, swallowing hard around him; and when he adds a teasing finger to the sensitive skin behind his balls.
She rolls her eyes, but there’s no sense of upset between them. “What do you want with me?”
“Why?”
Haven’t you heard he has a face you’d pay twice the going rate for? Haven’t you heard he’ll take it? Haven’t you heard he’s the best Hunter of his age? Haven’t you heard he sold his soul? Haven’t you heard an angel brought him back? Haven’t you heard he lost it again? To John? To the devil? To God? Haven’t you heard he was the most feared monster in Purgatory? Haven’t you heard losing his soul was nothing compared to losing his brother, to losing his angel, to losing his angel
“I don’t understand,” he frowns. “I know my
dancing across his tastebuds. “Everything.”
Cas shakes his head, but he doesn’t speak, he can’t. They’re so close. Both perched on the end of the bed, Cas’ hand still on Dean’s back protectively, their legs spread wide so their knees press against each other; the distance between their faces somehow far less than it should be.
“No, you’re wrong,” he finds himself saying panicked. They were wrong because Cas is careful around Dean, he wouldn’t dare slip up, especially not in front of people. “We aren’t-“
Their names become prayers, spiritual refrains that punctuate the carnal story, that signal moving towards the end. It can’t end. Not yet. Dean would live and die here, buried inside of Cas, fucking into his tight body that grips around him, that squirms and writhes and pants
being a euphemism for sexual intercourse?”
Cas nods. His eyes are burning, pupils wide and cheeks flushed. Is it hot in here? Dean is hot. Cas is hot-
You’ve heard about the child. A nephil. But no one knows the details. No one is brave enough to ask.
“Down,” he commands, rolling Cas onto his back. He trails kisses down his chest, experimentally teasing his nipples - not as sensitive to it as Dean is, but he still arches into the touch appreciatively. Dean tastes every inch of him, following the curve of his ribs and the lines of muscle and the jut of his hipbone and the firm flesh of his thigh. He takes Cas’ cock into his hand and runs his tongue along the length and the angel shudders. “Ever had this before? Am I the first?”
“What you here for?”
That has no right not to exist.
When this happens, he pauses. Braced against the reclaimed wood of the bar, desperately straining his ears into the nothingness, begging for one more note. It’s only when a warm hand settles on his shoulder, always his left, somehow always, that he realises what he’s doing. There’s only one place that his prayers echo out anymore and all they do is remind Cas of all the things that Dean has lost, of all the parts of Dean’s life that he did not know, that he cannot restore. But at least now the old Hunter does not flinch at his touch. His body relaxes into the large, steady hand; grounded, brought back to the present where Jo’s laughter is an eternal echo that makes it neither real nor unreal. If their lives had taught them anything, the distinction is arbitrary.
“And you’re a bitch,” he signs it big and deliberate, winking at Eileen. “Hey, want another?”
Selfish. Unworthy. The very touch of you corrupts.
“Bar?” Dean asks clapping his hands loudly. “You could use a drink.”
Clothes are a nuisance at the best of times, all those tiny buttons and restrictive seems and stiff zippers, but there’s something thrilling about fumbling with someone else’s clothes. Cas almost tears Dean’s jeans in his impatience, which makes the human laugh. Who knew the enjoyment you could get watching a wave of celestial intent shoved inside an accountant be unable to deal with a button because he’s too horny. Because he wants to fuck Dean that much.
“You’re speaking my language.” The coffee smells good, expensive, something that you would pay $7 dollars for because you know what you’re really buying is the chance to sit somewhere beautiful and put together when you are anything but. “Milks and sugar just there.”
“Sure…”
bar and thinking we just have to put up with it.”
“What have I told you about-“
“Then home.”
Did he still have the sword?
That catches his interest. “Where’s home?”
“God, I hate when you translate stuff like that.”
It doesn’t click immediately, not until Dean’s eyes dart towards the rest of the bed. “Oh. I don’t- I want anything you want, Dean.”
The man who seems to be the leader has a cruelty in his eyes that makes Cas feel cold. As he considers his options, a glint of light catches his attention and he notices the man slip brass knuckles onto his hands with a cool, practiced subtlety that confirms him as a different class of dangerous. He stalks slowly around the table, looking Cas up and down with more intrigue than pure hatred; Cas would almost class it as a curiosity or appreciation when his eyes go downwards.
The room is small and cosy: a double bed and thick duvet, a jug of water on the dresser, a small plate with cookies on it.
meant something. Before, when it was Castiel and Dean Winchester, not now, in the after, when it is Cas and Dean.
“It’s just sex, Dean.”
“Isn’t Claire supposed to be helping out?”
“Have you been here before?”
Cas’ brain is entirely too overloaded for that question.
“No, God,
or however Cas put it, but it still has allusions to the cosmically absurd aspect of their friendship.
The bar disappears into the distance, shrinking in your rearview mirror the way a dream slips through your memory like water between your fingers as consciousness takes over. The roads are all the same, the towns are all the same, but you are not. The dread in the pit of your stomach is no longer a knife holding you hostage, but a knot attached to a rope, pulling you back, anchoring you. For all the time spent fighting it, the magnetic pull to a place you felt you could no longer love, people you could no longer have if you wanted to survive. They are what convinces you to survive. You think about the way Dean and Castiel looked at each other when the other wasn’t watching, you thinking about the way Sam never stopped smiling when Eileen spoke, you think about how Claire became a teenager again in Castiel’s arms.
“Then no, I have not done
It’s a fair question of any Hunter, the answer the same: in their own way. No one survives because they have all the makings of a Hunter, a preset list of requirements that they meet; you survive because you face the job with what you have and you do what you have to.
and the way he looks at you makes the floor feel soft underfoot, so you forget that he actually asked you a question.
“Dean makes them,” Claire says as she watches you examine the room. “Don’t tell him I told you, if you remember that is.”
which Dean actually quite likes. It certainly sounds less insane than they have
That doesn’t seem fair. You didn’t know John Winchester, most people didn’t. He died so long ago and Hunters have a quick turnaround, reblooded often, rarely more than a decade of history able to be told first-hand. Dean watches you and your eyes and you wonder what he’ll do, if you became a threat, how does he eliminate threats now? You shiver at the thought. You let wistfulness seep through. You try to convey the kinship. The
“I don’t understand that reference.”
Cas squints at him. “You know that alcohol has very little-“ But Dean is already heading out of the door without bothering to wait for the sarcastic comment.
So you roll up to the door of the bar and it just looks like a bar because the warding is painted beneath the sign holding the name, and the devil’s trap is in the shadows of the ceiling, and hex bags are stowed inside of the cushions of the stools, and a silver rosary consecrated by softly sung blessings, murmured by the human mouth of an Angel, sits in the water tank. Even if you know, you do not know. But you feel safe here, that is the point, the commandment of the space; welcome and be welcomed. And maybe you sit at the bar, tired and alone and lonely, surrounded (for the first time?) by people with whom you can speak freely and you realise the weight of speaking in code, always hiding, bearing a burden that sears into your soul until you’re not sure you have one anymore. You hear they burn out, that you can use them up, and then what are you?
“Okay. I got you,” his arms seem to tighten. “Cas? We’re going up.”
But there’s no point in trying to reason with these men, they’ve scented blood in the water and now they want their prize. Of course, Cas could immobilise all of them in a second, but that would just draw attention to him and Dean, and ruin their hunt. So, he runs. Thankfully, Dean is still doing whatever it is that’s taking him so long, but it gives them an out.
“You know that some ace people can have sex, right?”
“Actually, things aren’t going so well.”
14:57 Dean:
Ten minutes later, Dean is back to being irritated at him.
“Ok, what would you like to talk about instead?”
Castiel looks up from his computer. “What?”
They are both quite for a bit, listening to the movie playing out. Then Dean turns toward Cas and says, “And you should know that finishing your PhD doesn’t mean you’re destined to be or are trapped into becoming a scientist. It just means you finished.”
As the sun sets, dread slowly begins creeping in. He should be working. He should be writing. He should be doing anything but standing around with a warm, undrunk beer, talking to his friend and watching another grad student chicken fighting in the pool.
“I was at work. I’m going that national conference in a week and am still analyzing my data.”
Length: 7:09
“So, have you looked up any patents?”
21:58 Meg:
“I know.” Dean winks at him. “I give the best advice.”
“Wow, you don’t deserve any of that.”
“Sure.”
Castiel is coming back from the bathroom when he overhears Sam telling Dean in a low voice, “You’ve got something special in him. You better not screw it up.”
Charlie’s brow furrows. “Cas, I’m worried about you.”
It is rather fortunate that Dean and Cas are on the bed and not sitting at the table when the Impala abruptly returns to its original size. Also fortunate is the fact that the front bumper keeps the door from opening and Sam getting an eyeful (although he does hear enough to let him know that he probably should just eat his breakfast on a bench in the park across the street).
They start walking toward the union, both looking down at the phones to play the game. Halfway there, Dean speaks up again.
Castiel sighs. He’s never felt that way about anything. Ever. Maybe he’s just broken.
Castiel scoffs and Dean frowns at him. Meg interrupts by throwing pumpkin guts and a war starts.
One of those students catches Castiel’s eye and he realizes it’s Dean. He’s in deep blue swim trunks and is sporting a pair of aviators. Castiel watches as Dean takes a running leap and disappears over the edge of the hill. A loud whoop goes up from those waiting, so Castiel assumes Dean must have either gone very fast or done some kind of hot dogging trick.
“Yeah, yeah, good for you. But come on, you don’t mess with a man’s car!”
“Perhaps your pocket would be a safe location. Or the table in our room,” suggests Cas.
With a sigh, he pulls himself up and off of the coach and heads straight to bed. After all, it’s probably the best thing he can do with his time, what little he has left before he’s kicked out and becomes a disgrace to all.
Dean frowns. “Do you even want to meet today? It doesn’t seem like you want to be here.”
“What made it ‘awful as usual’?”
22:01 Meg:
“I hate this meet-up.”
15:17 Dean:
“Yeah, but you’re sure watching him like you do.”
“No shit.”
15:01 Dean:
“How have your other meds been affecting you?”
“She fully supported this decision. Mr. Novak, do you understand? You are aware of the deadlines you’ll need to meet?”

“Go away, Meg.”
“Sounds like maybe that life isn’t what you really want. Or maybe you’re just burnt out. Ten years is a long time to be working on one thing constantly.”
“Sure, of course.” Charlie doesn’t sound convinced, but she’s too kind-hearted to push. “Well, if you’re not going to be there tonight, then you should at least meet our latest sci-fi nerd-in-arms right now.”
Oh. He’d forgotten about that. Usually Charlie’s viewing parties are one of the highlights of his week, but right now, he can’t imagine having to pretend to be ok around other people for one more minute. He needs to go home and hide under his covers for the next week.
“Hey, wait up, Cas.”
“Yeah, yeah. No need to sound so smug.”
Crowley turns and even though he’s much shorter than Castiel, Castiel suddenly feels like he’s being lorded over. “Mr. Novak.”
On autopilot, he turns around and reenters the conference room, pointedly ignoring Meg’s attempts to get his attention. Castiel walks over to the table holding the boxed lunches, grabs one without looking, and tries to escape.
Dean swallows and glances back toward the Impala. “So, uh, gonna need a hand here, Cas.”
“You are so fucking stubborn, you know that?” Dean throws up his hands. “Fine, you find something that’ll work for you and I’ll just pretend it applies to my research too.”
Surprised by Dean’s offer, Castiel squints at him. What angle is he playing?
And finds his way blocked by one Charlie Bradbury.
“I think it’s made me realize that I have nothing to offer people. That I am misleading them when I try to start a relationship, so it’s just better if I don’t date anyone. Besides, grad school has ruined my physical and mental health, so it’s not like anyone’s been asking.”
Meg texts him that night while he’s trying to “work on his dissertation”. Which really means he’s sitting on his sofa watching Great British Bake Off and agonizing over his life.
“Some pain is too much for one person alone. That’s why you got family – they can prop you up when things get to be too much.”
“Okay. Well, I was thinking we could maybe do some on analytical separation techniques, since that could work for both of our projects.”
They go back to watching the movie. A while later, Dean asks, “Have you ever been in a relationship before?”
“Maggie either doesn’t know that Harry cheated on her with his field tech this summer or she doesn’t care.”
Meg saunters into his line of sight and raises an eyebrow.
15:19 Castiel:
Castiel steps aside so the brothers can embrace, and he swears that Dean’s eyes are a little damp. Sam is no better, and there’s some sniffling from them both.
Sensing something important is being said, Castiel sits up straighter and turns toward Dean. “That would be fine, too.”
But on the way home, the dread turns to anxiety, which won’t help him with work. The only way to handle that is a walk that completely tires him out, so he parks his car and heads toward campus. The gutted feeling won’t go away, but at least he can escape the feelings of emptiness and loss for a bit while he walks. It’s better than feeling like nothing will ever be ok again.
“Yes, it is not wide enough to accommodate your vehicle’s width.”
Dean waves him off. “It’s ok. The point is, there’ll be tough things ahead, times when you think maybe everything’s all gonna fall apart and blow up in your face. That’s normal. Well, at least for us, that’s normal.” Dean shakes his head with a small smile, then looks over at Cas again. “But we’ve been through enough that I can say with certainty that if there’s a way to help Gabriel, we’ll find it. Together. Ok?”
Castiel shrugs. “Mostly the same. Some days I sleep fourteen hours and some days I sleep two. I have started taking those vitamins again to make sure it’s not because of some kind of deficiency, but I’m still exhausted.”

Charlie hosts a welcome back/happy end of field season party Saturday night of Labor Day weekend.
“Yes.”
It’s as he’s drifting off that he realizes it would have been nice to talk to Dean after the meeting. He’d been so kind and strangely understanding the other day, helping to diffuse Castiel’s bad mood so easily. Quickly, Castiel opens the Pokémon Go app and sends Dean a gift, then turns off his phone and falls asleep.
Then, deciding that Dean had been brave to tell him that he was bisexual, Castiel decides to take a risk.
“Oh?”
“She didn’t understand that family is very important to you.”
He can’t hide how he’s feeling right now, so he needs to get out of here as fast as possible. “Yeah, just really busy. With work. You know how it is.”
“No. I’m…it’s not that…” Castiel sighs. “Yeah. That’s pretty much it.”
“I feel bad all the time. And I’m just whiling away the time until the deadline and am no closer to being finished.” Castiel shrugs. “So, quitting seems like the obvious path forward.”
“I don’t really find any of those people attractive. If anything, the relationship that most resonates with me is that between Adama and Roslin.”
“He and I have been spending a lot of time together. A few nights during the week and most every weekend. We’re watching a TV series that he’s never seen. And he introduced me to a game that has helped a bit with my anxiety.”
And of course, Dean tells him quite frequently that he would have been proud of Castiel even if he didn’t finish.
The fall semester begins with the usual lack of fanfare and anticipation. When it’s your sixteenth year of college and eleventh of grad school, it all just sort of blends together into meaningless monotony.
This conference room, to be specific.
The episode of Great British Bake Off that has been playing in the background ends and Castiel shuts off the stream. His apartment is suddenly too quiet. Better just go to bed than face the blinking cursor on his dissertation for another second.
“Come on. I know you have an alcoholic sister, but is that any reason not to enjoy the stuff yourself?”
“What do you think would make it easier to take them?”
“Actually, no.” Dean runs a hand along his jawline. “I was hoping we could chat for a second.”
Dr. Anna Milton
“How quickly you forget. Time passes differently in Hell, Dean. Do you recall that your 40 years in Hell was only 4 months on Earth? If Gabriel truly was a prisoner in Hell this entire time, it has been considerably more than just 8 years for him.”
A few hours later and he and Dean are both too drunk to drive home. Fortunately, Castiel’s apartment is within walking distance from Charlie’s, so he and Dean wish a tipsy Charlie goodnight and head out.
Sam nods toward Castiel. “I got an email from him a few weeks ago. Said he got it from Charlie and wanted to bring me to you for Christmas. Unfortunately, it was going to be too expensive to fly me in around Christmas and I’ll have too much on my plate then anyway, but now was doable, so here I am.”
Dean pulls out his phone. “You play Pokémon Go?”
Cas shifts beside him. “I’m sorry, I didn’t think–”
And it suddenly occurs to Dean that he’d also failed to consider the time difference for Cas’s captivity. How long had he been Asmodeus’ prisoner, trapped beside Lucifer, the bastard who’d possessed him for all those months?
“And for the PhD students we have Lisa, Robyn, Bryan,” reads Dr. Mills. “And oh, a repeat customer, Castiel.”
Castiel,
Castiel stares at Dean’s reflection in the mirror. A day like today is one for risking things, so he turns around, steps into Dean’s space and kisses him.
"Don't worry, this won't affect our project."
“How about your new friend, Dean was it?”
Too bad it seems inevitable that he will.
“Uh, how about you guys keep an eye on her in the room, and I’ll grab breakfast since we, uh, probably aren’t going anywhere soon,” says Sam, wincing in sympathy at the tortured look on Dean’s face as he gently touches his pointer finger to the Impala’s roof.
Dean and Castiel spend most of winter break together.
So, he decides to go for a distraction. “I’m really ok, promise. And now that you’ve reminded me about Halloween, I think we should probably figure out our group costumes for this year, don’t you?
Crowley smirks. “Well, we had a little chat. And we’ve decided that you have until spring to successfully defend or you’ll be removed from the program. You’ve been here too long, you see, and it’s becoming quite the problem.”
Numbly, Castiel nods.
“Social life?”
They are watching Starship Troopers for the millionth time and enjoying the divine sugar cookies Gabriel whipped up while Castiel was at work, when Gabe asks him about school.
When Meg goes back inside for food and another beer, Castiel takes the opportunity to slip away. Meg will forgive him – she’s never been too hung up on social niceties, which is probably part of the reason why they are friends. He does feel badly for not saying goodbye to Charlie, but he knows she would see the panic in his eyes and try to help him calm down. He doesn’t need to be calm. He needs to use this energy to work.
Castiel glances over his shoulder. “At least they’re not doing it right now.”

“Oh, sorry.”
“And not finishing, what would that mean?”
Castiel Novak
“And we will be Gabriel’s family?” Cas asks. “He will likely need ‘propping’.”
Dean crouches down and delicately picks up the toy car-sized Impala and carefully puts it in the palm of his hand as he stands. “Now what?”
Castiel grits his teeth and forces a smile as heads turn his way. He was hoping it would escape everyone’s notice that he’s having to retake some of his coursework due to it expiring because he’s been a student too long. Looks like that’s not going to happen.
But as Dean starts scrolling down the webpage of patents they are searching through, there doesn’t seem to be any ulterior motive to his offer than cutting Castiel some slack. Strange.
“Hey,” Dean says. “You know I love you, right?”
“That’s cool. I’ve never known anyone that’s ace before, but I have read up some on it. Thought Sammy might be ace for a while, but then he found a girl at Harvard, Jess, and from what I can tell, they’re pretty hot and heavy.”
Length: 29:16
“And what if I don’t know what fulfills me?”
Later, Castiel is alternating playing solitaire and mahjong with almost frantic energy while Chopped is on in the background. It’s the teen tournament and all every contestant seems to talk about how they’ve always wanted to be a chef.
“Of course.”
“Of course he won’t. You aren’t the same as you were eight years ago,” Dean says softly, squeezing the arm around Cas’ shoulders to let him know he means that in a good way.
“How so?”
“Uh, I’m-” he clears his throat and starts again. “I’m Castiel. My advisor is Dr. Milton but I’m currently working in Dr. Shurley’s lab. My dissertation research involves studying the difference in ecotoxicology of neonicotinoid pesticides on honey and native bees.” Castiel pauses, then says in a rush. “And I’ve been here a while.”
14:52 Castiel:
“In bed?”
Length: 13:33
22:01 Meg:
Charlie frowns. “I don’t know that that is a good id–”
“Not the old version nor the new?”
Length: 8:01
Castiel swallows and wishes he could just vanish. Does he really have to say? Crowley gives him a look that clearly says yes. Reluctantly, he murmurs, “Ten.”
Cas swallows, and Dean swears his eyes start to shimmer just slightly, so he looks away and pretends it’s just the cold wind making Cas’s eyes glisten. Dean’s voice betrays him with a little waver, though.
Meg purses her lips and then lowers her voice. “Lilith keeps hogging the LCMS. And Eve won’t shut up about her NSF grant, so being in the lab right now is sooo annoying. I suppose I could come in at night, but a girl’s got to have a social life, you know.”
“Yeah.”
“Yeah, well it’d be better than fighting with you over something that doesn’t even matter. Seriously, you need to relax.”
“Meg.”
“You’re worried that you won’t be able to find the time to do what needs to be done.”
Castiel huffs. “I see you continue to know all the gossip.”
Finally, Crowley says, “Well, that’s it for the business portion of our meeting. Please help yourself to a boxed lunch and socialize for a bit. I will be in my office, so make sure to close the door and turn off the lights when you’re finished.”
