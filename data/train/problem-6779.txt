. Tony had no idea what psychological or physical changes Steve could go through if they kept doing this – for all Tony knew, Steve was liable to grow gills. Even if Steve
“Nat roped me into training with the Maximoffs,” Bucky answered, as he carried on over to the fridge. “Why, what are you doing for the rest of the day?”
And, before Steve could shut it down again, the immediate observation that…
…Oh…God….
He saw Steve first, sitting on the floor with his legs stretched out in front of him, frowning thoughtfully at the skyline. Beside him, Bucky was lying flat on his back, limbs spread like a jumping jack. A bit further behind them, and off to the left, Nat was curled on her side, her head resting on her hands. Next to her was Bruce, slumped in that same strange, kneeling position. Sam and Rhodey were at the back of the room, lying side by side.
...But there was still a part of Steve that was only human.
…And it was right.
“Okay, give me two minutes to start the programme…” Tony had to force the words over the growing pressure in his chest, already thinking ahead to what he was going to say to Steve. Trying
He kissed Steve again, warm and slow and deep, caressing his arms possessively across Steve’s back. A low, tingling thrill ran though his skin as he felt Steve relax into it – at the way Steve couldn’t decide where to put his hands…
By now, Tony
conversation he and Steve ever had would’ve been in that brief period, after their animosity toward each other thawed and before everything turned to shit.
So, he ignored the way Steve’s eyes seemed to settle in the middle distance. He bit it back, every time
When they got to the front door of Tony’s mansion, Steve was having to clench his fists to keep his hands from shaking. He didn’t think he’d ever been this nervous.
That he really had spent the whole day in bed with Tony Stark, running his hands over that beautiful body, and listening to Tony say how happy he was to be there…
Thank you all so, SO much for reading, and for your lovely feedback - I can't tell you how much I've enjoyed writing this, or how moved I've been by the response.
He wanted to chain Steve down and just
Because he knew it was Tony.
The fact that there weren’t
For a few minutes he could only bask in it. The freedom of being this relaxed and open, the overwhelming relief, the hot shivers that fizzed through his fluid muscles. The echo of that low, pulsing pleasure, still throbbing in his hips.
And then a low jolt of friction, as Steve moved against him.

All of a sudden, being in this room was about the most ridiculous, most surreal, most
Tony and Bucky looked at one another. There was that urge to laugh again.
“Which would make sense…” Bucky prompted.
And then he got to draining the last drops, his hand closing into a fist as he swallowed that final mouthful. And then he finally let the bag drop to his side, his head falling heavily in front of him
And Tony smiled back, sadly. He sank to sit on the floor, his back against the couch, so that he could briefly rest his head against Steve’s knee when he said,
pretty in that moment, and so full of all the wonderful, earnest
“Well, I don’t think it has to be either or,” Rhodey mused. “I mean, even if you decide you’re not going to be in any more showcases, or whatever - it’s still nice that you say, ‘thank you for the flower’, and that you’re nice to people when you meet them.”
And then he looked up at Steve, his eyes so alive and glowing golden in the sunlight, almost too amazed to smile.
Tony had already opened his mouth to tell Steve it was okay. His lips were already curved around the words…
He still didn’t know what to say.
And he saw Adam’s eyes flicker-
“It isn’t?”
“I just thought

That he should probably get

That might be
And, with that, Tony actually sprang up from the bed, leaping to his feet and instantly beginning to pace-
“Oh, right, let him in then,” Tony answered on autopilot, still trying to get his bearings. He was briefly confused, thinking that Rhodey was supposed to be in Europe – but then he worked out that, obviously, that was hours ago. “What time is it?”
Steve huffed out something that might’ve been a laugh or a sob, and just let his head fall into Tony’s hair.
He’d thought about that initial meeting lots of times. He’d watched every second of it over in his head, deconstructed every argument, come up with a thousand different things he wished he’d said instead… He’d asked himself if he was in the right about any of those points, and if he’d been wrong about Tony, and how much of it was just him being an ass…
“Which makes it the best that anywhere in the universe has to offer,” the first one clarified, “the greatest performers and creators and artists in existence have gathered here - to stage their championship competitions, and perform their greatest works, and to provide the delicacies that will be available to you throughout your stay.”
… have beautiful thighs - did I ever tell you that?” Tony asked him, in a mischievous tone of voice. Steve managed a brief spike of panic, when he recognised that he didn’t have the cognitive capacity to do something as complicated as
Steve’s entire body was immediately alight with such an intense excitement that it was actually frightening.
There was something undeniably
A lot of the things they wanted to see in the future-
Submitting.
“Well, I wish I hadn’t mentioned your dad, especially because now I can’t think of anything to say that isn’t about your dad.” Steve babbled, and Tony felt his smile warm into something a bit more genuine.
those reasons that he could never be normal, all that evidence that he could never have what other people had, and all it had taken was a nice guy with a pretty smile-
“Not just yet.” Tony mused “It’ll look weird if we’re just following her around…” And Steve just nodded, and finished the final shot…
thought was so objectionable that Steve actually sat up under the force of it.
At last, Tony sat down on the edge of the bed, and reached over to pull two more gift-wrapped presents from the gym bag. Then he casually knocked the bag to the floor, and pulled his legs up onto the mattress, turning to face Steve before he handed him the presents.
“God you’re beautiful,” Tony whispered, softly kissing the bridge of his nose. Steve huffed a soft laugh that rippled all the way through Tony’s body, sending a little echo of static shocks through his softened muscles.
“Yeah, I’d love to,” he beamed, casting a final glance over the workshop before he gestured towards the elevator,
That he’d chosen this outfit,
” Tony whispered, arcing up into him. “
“Tony, I love you, I-” He heard himself sob, not sure what he was trying to say when his voice broke again.
“And now everything is ruined, and even if my brother doesn’t kill me and the Council don’t arrest me, I’ll have nowhere to go” She sounded numb now. Almost resigned. “My family are monsters, and I have done horrible things, and there’s just nothing for me now.”
…yet.
“Oh-more-please-Steve-fuck-there-please” Tony blurted out, writhing against him, clawing at the couch. And then Steve pushed a third finger into him, working him open, deliberately seeking out that same spot again. “Fuck me, please fuck me,
So, what, he was going to start judging Natasha for mistakes he’d already forgiven, mistakes she’d already accepted and learned from, just because he’d seen them now? He was going to judge Nat for the time before she grew to care for Tony, even though there had been a time when Steve made exactly the same mistake?
But somehow he managed to push through it.
Intriguing.
Steve was suddenly so full of enthusiasm and interest and motivation that he just had to… do
He and Steve tensed together. They exchanged a brief, knowing glance. And then there was a ghost of a smile on Steve’s lips, before he gave a tiny nod to where Tony’s pants were lying in a crumpled heap by the side of the bed,
“Seems to me, you either know who did that or you’d have no idea whose door to knock on.” Tony observed. Zan smiled.
not anxious and ashamed all the time, just, in general. Because when I look at my life I see more than some disaster I have to explain. Because… Well, because you,” he smiled. Steve felt his breath catch again, but at least this time it was nice. “And that’s the thing,” Tony carried on. “How we feel can change everything about how something looks. The best plan in the world can start to look dangerous, if you go into it feeling scared. You can convince yourself you’re the worst person in the world, if that’s how you felt anyway…”
– but I did that once, when I first met you, and I think it literally ruined my life, and probably could’ve ended the whole world, and might have
Here he was, trying to plan for Steve’s awkwardness in this situation – when Steve might’ve spent the last two years fucking his way from safe house to safe house, for all Tony knew. When Steve might never have been shy or awkward about things like this, any more than he’d actually been awkward telling a lie. It might all have been part of the cover story.
Steve was dizzy by the time Tony broke away, too breathless to attempt any of the frantic pleas that were building up in his head-
“…Afterwards,” he replied, slowly. “…But I completely forgot to mention that…”
, they’d dismantle the whole operation. I
That second time, Steve wasn’t stunned or hesitant. That time, Steve grabbed hold of Tony and pulled him into his lap, in an unashamed, unfiltered desire to be close to him, his fingertips caressing into Tony’s skin, his breathing coming in delighted little gasps-
But then, he and Bucky had never needed to.
The technical explanations could wait until another time. Right now, the pertinent detail was,
“And that’s what Steve would’ve thought, and that’s why he would’ve been happy to another location…” Tony realised aloud. “…Maybe he’s been there before. Maybe that’s when he got this flyer…”
I said sorry about the secret, the thing I did, at the time – I don’t just mean that. I mean – I lied to you, then. I didn’t

Ultimately, Zemo didn’t win because Steve tried to plan, or failed to plan... It all fell apart because Steve had tried to control
Tony blinked, his lips parting in surprise.
, that never quite went away.
And the answer came in a calm, soft voice - from behind him.
But what was the use? It wasn’t even as though he had an alternative plan to try to convince them of.
But this might be even longer that I was expecting 🙈 What can I say, I have a very detailed plan, and I know exactly what I have left to write... I just always underestimate how much more of it there's going to be 😂
And the realisation that
He felt the air between them crackle, a sudden static sensation all over his skin. Then he saw Tony glance at Bucky, a flicker of thought behind his eyes before he looked back at Steve, apologetically. But Steve just nodded – he understood.
“About
to talk to Tony right now... Having an actual conversation with Tony would mean thinking about which Tony to visit, and what Steve would want to say, and would almost certainly end with yet another personal revelation that he wouldn’t be able to process…
at the time? Had he been doing that this whole time? Overlooking the things that Nat had done, demanding others do the same, simply because those things hadn’t been present to him?
What he was born to do…
feelings were novel and exciting and real, even when they were driving him mad.
And then he would come back, and start again - with this.
...Because he couldn’t see a way out of it.
Tony felt a now-familiar tug of heat, right under his skin.
“No,” he said, simply. “No talking.”
The same face… But different.
That’s why he sent that text in the first place.
“I can trigger an evacuation-” Maribelle offered, her voice high and tight. But Steve cut her off with a wave of his hand.
He knew he’d reached the point where he had to say this – to keep Adam from moving, to stop himself from doing something worse, to prevent a rage induced heart attack-
He never thought that Tony would’ve wanted to hear
Which would have been a life-changing moment of enlightenment, at any other time… But now… Tony kind of felt like he knew that already.
work, and all the ways he was prepared to work with them.
That Steve had never said he loved him…
“Well, maybe we get talking, and we make each other laugh, and we enjoy each other’s company…” Tony began, his voice heavy and resigned. And then he fixed Rhodey with a serious look, and asked, “What then? What, he comes to visit me here, like a companion for me, or something? How long before he gets bored of that, do you think? This one room, and me with no stories to tell him, because I haven’t been anywhere, and the things I’ve been doing here are gross and disturbing? Do you think I should pretend I’m not a vampire, or tell him all about the blood drinking and watch him try not to flinch. Or worse –
An entirely different sort of curiosity stirred in Tony then. Something between shock and intrigue. A personal pang of uneasy amusement that led him to pick the paper up without thinking…
“I went everywhere in LA,” Tony scoffed, finally meeting Steve’s eye. Steve could see an intention there, a silent warning that Tony was trying to give- “I have been to countless shitty, anonymous bars, by way of some very shady unlicensed taxis, across I don’t know how many miles, in at least two different shirts - which is about as sure as I can be that no one followed me, and no one knows where I am right now.”
“I don’t know if you remember me, we met a few nights ago – I’m Dev.”
And then Steve’s lips were on his, devouring and demanding and unashamedly desperate, forcing Tony’s mouth open, one hand grabbing roughly at the back of Tony’s hair as he pulled Tony up into the kiss. Tony’s body surrendered for him, immediately and completely – an impulse that had nothing to do with him being a vampire, or his supernatural bond to Steve. This was the most basic human instinct, an understanding right from his gut.
The Facility was eerily quiet now. Empty, and still – and properly lit, which was strangely grating. There was a disorientating feeling of being somewhere they shouldn’t be, like being at a nightclub after daybreak or sneaking into his high school over the summer.

Because I run a company now, and I can’t arrange my every commitment around your latest bout of mania.”
Tony…
“So, this is one of several lounges you’ll find dotted around The Facility” the guide explained brightly, gesturing to a large room, with a high ceiling and low lighting, and maybe ten plush, red couches-
He dropped his arms immediately, and softened his face. Like Steve, he mistook her for a child, at first. And then he saw the lines around her eyes, and the bluish tint of her skin. He recognised that her face was alien… but still, the expression was so familiar.
“Why do I know that name?” He asked, to no one in particular.
“Follow us”
He started listing mundane details as they walked into the building, through a large reception room and down a long, ridiculously wide corridor - noting the different colours and materials he could see, profiling the few people they walked past, trying to place the sounds he could hear echoing in the distance…
Tony’s movements weren’t quite as controlled as he ran his tongue over the wound, healing it. He pushed his fingers into Steve shaper and shallower, an illicit thrill running up his spine as he felt the trickle of Steve’s blood running over his hand – as he pushed Steve’s own blood into him.

stinging.
Unfortunately, on this trip, it was slightly more complicated than that.
“Come here,” Tony whispered softly, guiding Steve to climb with him onto the bed. And Steve just followed him, like his limbs were responding to Tony’s thoughts rather than his own. And then Tony put a hand to Steve’s shoulder, and pushed him to lie flat on his back, climbing on top of him and straddling his hips. Steve whimpered at the sudden friction and bucked up against him, his hands grabbing at Tony’s waist. Tony grinned indulgently and ground against him slowly, sending a hot wave of pleasure rolling up Steve’s spine. Steve groaned, and tried to rock up into it – but found he was pinned so much more firmly than he expected to be. Like Tony was able to push down against him with more weight than he carried, able to hold Steve still without even moving.
level of self-awareness.
So, they each popped the pill free of the paper packaging, and swallowed roughly.
For a few minutes, that task commanded all of his attention. But, as he finally struggled his way past the first few rows, the crush eased off enough to allow him to weave through the people.

Bucky pulled a stool out from under the island in the centre of the kitchen, and sat with his weight resting on the counter. For a few minutes he simply watched as Tony made the food, not thinking much of anything, feeling generally content-

“So, how’re you feeling?” Tony asked, as he handed Steve his mug and sat down at the other end of the couch. Steve exhaled heavily.

, and opened the car door with a little too much force.
“That wasn’t a bad day in the office,” Steve corrected him.
He knew why he’d done it.
“Hey, Rhodey, you with us? You okay?” He called. “Sam?”
“Why didn’t you tell me?” Tony asked, very quietly. And Steve took a deep, steadying breath, pulling himself back up into his shoulders before he answered,
...He could let Steve see how much he cared about him, and he could put all of himself into every gesture, and admit to himself that he
Thank you
And Steve
He forced himself to take a long, slow breath, subtly flexing his hands at his sides. Trying to silence the memory of angry voices and terrified screams. Trying to smother the images of burned out buildings and charred flesh. Trying not to feel, at all.
And then, at last, it occurred to him… He didn’t know when he’d slipped into thinking that.

“I’ll radio as soon as I’ve got them,” Tony just talked over the top of her… taking careful aim at the wall, twenty feet to the left of the main entrance-

He didn’t look up again until he felt Steve settle into an awkward pause somewhere behind him – and then for a moment, he could only stare at him.
attention to this place if, on paper, it just looks like a new Stark intern has moved in, and they get deliveries like a normal person,” Tony corrected, casually. “And, if anyone looks into it, some guy named Jones is staying here, and apparently he likes Chinese food - Chinese food?” He looked to Steve for confirmation.
And then Nick’s cold correction, in two simple words.
“Yeah?” Steve asked.
He could still feel the aftershocks of that climax shuddering though him, his whole body limp and loose and surrendered to it
This was a feeling of destiny.
“Sorry kid,” he murmured, as he set it aside, “but there are worse things you can lose in the ocean.”

conversation, anyway.
was anxious to get it done.
In fact, he was so far through the process that there was a strange, strangled noise as he swallowed it down - loud enough that Rhodey snorted in surprise. Tony clenched his jaw shut and looked down at the floor in a way that probably wasn’t at all subtle-
that Steve wanted this.
Tony knew the exact thrill this inspired in Steve, the specific, intoxicating freedom of it… Like Tony could feel it through him. As though he could hear it whispering straight from Steve’s subconscious – like his body was answering directly,
It took a full minute for his stunned mind to tick over to the next thought-

fucked it up so many times by then. And I know that I always came across as judgemental or disinterested or ungrateful, but only because I was trying so hard not to come across as… to not make everything more uncomfortable and complicated, but, still, I thought you just… didn’t like me. I just thought that every time we talked it was awkward and I got it all wrong and I made you feel bad, so why would you – And, you were the only person I’d ever met who didn’t give a shit about Captain America, and what the fuck else was there? I literally didn’t even know at that point – and all I could remember about the person I was before that is that no one thought that much of him, and I, just, I didn’t-”
There were, in among the papers he flinched from and the books he was avoiding, a few pages Tony kept going back to. Passages he’d read over and over, phrases that he’d thought back to again and again.
But Steve couldn’t help
“Well, I don’t know about weird.” Tony frowned. “I mean – you
Later, he’d comb through every detail of the night and analyse every part of it and worry himself to death.
“Who are you?” He asks, just because he wants to know.
Steve’s shoulders tensed, as they began to walk towards the group, their eyes locked on him specifically. He braced his legs against a bodily urge to flee, his lips already parting to give the objection he hadn’t thought of yet-
And, little did Tony know, he
And it was

“You can touch, you know…” he whispered teasingly, just as he curled his hand around the length of Steve’s cock. Steve groaned, his hips snapping up into Tony’s grip as he grabbed mindlessly at his arms, greedily caressing every inch that he could reach. Tony let those simple pleasures shiver through him, his face resting in an elated grin. He kept his eyes fixed on Steve’s as he began to move his hand, indulging in the sharp edge of desperation in Steve’s expression, the heavy heat of his cock against his palm, the sensations that rolled through Tony’s back as Steve touched him…
, thinking of Tony knowing that reference…
And Tony almost laughed. How strange it was to feel like Steve could actually read his mind – as compared to the days when he wondered whether Steve could even see him. He couldn’t help thinking of how he might’ve heard Steve’s outburst, just last week. Back when he used to take Steve’s every statement at face value. Back when he used to comb through their every argument like a defence attorney, assigning layers and layers of meaning to every word and then defending that interpretation as fact… Back when Steve would never have just said sorry for that. When Steve would have kicked himself for it, and resolved never to do it again, and never thought to let Tony know…
Tony began to see the flaws in his plan pretty early on.
Tony realised that their parents had given he and Steve this token of their appreciation… by way of their children, who were about to know freedom for the first time…
...And that was before Steve saw
“Is he waking up?”
But Steve didn’t want to become a global dictator. He didn’t have a particular ideology he wanted to share with the masses, or an international event he wanted to trigger.

He couldn’t make it

“And how to
“…But… you want to…”
He was saying it for himself as much as for Bucky. Making sure that caveat got laid down with the foundations of this thing. Because Steve wasn’t sure what was going to happen with Tony, or what it meant… But, if he was going to start working it out, then he might as well start here.
. You could’ve at least tipped me off that there was a fucking Super Soldiers thing, before the airport. You could’ve told Nat. You could’ve sent me a message that said, the world is in danger, I can’t tell you why, but there is more going on –
satisfying force, feeling completely entitled to hold Steve’s face as he tried to flinch away.
With that, he finally managed to tear his gaze from the window, turning to find the source of that sound - but first, he found Pepper, slumped on her knees, just to the left of him. Her head was bowed forward, her arms hanging heavy at her sides… But Tony could see the deep rhythm of her breathing in the curve of her back. It occurred to him that this was probably the same position he’d woken up in. He leaned in to check that she was okay, before he swallowed hard and shifted to look at the room behind him.
That was too soon.
Nat had
a coincidence.
“You know, you only have one side of that story,” Clint muttered, like he was trying to control his temper. Steve was forced to clench his jaw in a bid to control his.
He flinched away from that thought. He knew, if he started asking himself how she died, he’d come up with all sorts of horrible answers - answers that would no doubt be worse than the reality, but he’d be stuck with them anyway…
That he did want
It was an instinct too ingrained to be overwhelmed by even his current mood, something he’d been trained to spot and sidestep since childhood. Something he understood long before he found the words for it-
And then Steve had just-
Tony smile at that.
Steve raised his eyebrows,
...But maybe even that didn’t seem quite so apprehensive, in the cold light of day.
...Or,
“Yes, yes, go, Jesus,” Steve hissed, already trying to rock back-
“Well, I’m not saying I’ve got it
too much, and-
how to make a better world for him. Well, for everyone… But, yeah, mainly for him. And for Bucky.
he was any more… but he was sure that he wasn’t cruel.
“No, nothing like that!” The man assured him, with a warm laugh. “I’m one of the hosts here at The Facility. I try to keep track of the new arrivals – we don’t get all that many, each week. I’m Dev, by the way.” And he offered his hand to Steve.
This heady physical bliss.
mayhem, I assure you,” Tony grinned, his hands still caressing gently on Steve’s hips. Steve’s smile broke into a giggle, his entire body warming with affection as Tony carried on, “For a start, I was thinking that there were probably more of those old pages in my dad’s stuff, if I bothered to look for them - and I was right!” Tony gestured, proudly, to an untidy pile of yellow papers on the desk nearest to them. “And some of them have some readable notes on them - which, okay, don’t really mean anything to me yet,
“I don’t know, yet,” he replied, more soberly. Stalling for time, more than anything. He looked back at Barnes’ files, and then at Barnes’ arm, and tried to think of any other generic questions he could ask while he had this existential crisis. “Are there any ways you prefer to do this? Any treatments or procedures that you really don’t like?”
“It’s different,” Steve whispered.
A desire to hear this.
“Yes, please yes,” Steve whispered as Tony dropped to kiss him again, messier now. Less controlled.
And then he sort of gathered himself up, like he was trying to brace himself.
And Tony couldn’t help wondering how he’d have heard that, a few days ago. What he might’ve assumed Steve’s thoughts to be, what he’d have seen when he looked at him. Somewhere, he recognised that these were the times they used to fight… he thought, probably, he’d have heard an accusation in Steve’s tone there, or some level of judgement. That his first reaction would probably have been,
Steve was supposed to be here. Tony was
But he was backing away from this apology for all the same reasons. He was still telling Tony he could expect more from him than he expected from Tony. He was

Maybe he was just too eager to get out of the conversation.
But would that really fix anything?
bits I take back, actually.”
Someone beautiful and brilliant and brave and kind…
A wave of heat crashed over him, his hips snapping up instinctively as the rest of him tensed still. Every frustration bloomed out into a deep, satisfied pleasure, all at once. A thousand different sparks and shivers and ripples of sensation rolled together, all pulled into that same pulsing,
And he knew that was wrong.
And then a shrill alarm, seemingly out of nowhere-
Knowing that he could – and
And, oh God, Steve
“Farewell, Captain.”
hurt. At the very least, it was searingly uncomfortable, from the seconds Tony realised where Steve was going with it.
And Steve looked at Tony…
“…Well, I always just assumed I’d offended you…” He said, as though to himself. And then his lips curled into a smile again as he thought back through all his memories, and realised… “But, yeah, actually, we’re both just
“C’mon,” he muttered, jerking his head in what he hoped was the right direction. Sam and Bucky followed him, obligingly.
But he’d not fixed this thing, and he couldn’t fix this thing now – Steve was going to call him, and say everything was done, and if Tony hadn’t been able to tell him no before, he was never going to manage it after-
How horrible SHIELD’s initial assessment of Tony was, and how much it had clearly hurt him.
“It’s all on the drug pamphlet” He smiled, standing aside to let Zan step through the portal.
And Steve might even have stopped to apologise then, if only Scott had shut up.
start thinking about it again, when my brain starts working. All those memories are in there now, just waiting for me to start picking them to pieces…”
“Yes, I want you, I want you inside me, please,” Tony assured him, already picturing it, his own cock hard against his stomach again.
Even this panicked, physical urgency felt good. The increasing need for oxygen, the pain of desperation, the wonderful abandon of it.
He was somewhat anxious, as he thought back to it – fearful that he’d suddenly recognise an irrational, emotional response. In case he was about to realise that he’d just unfairly and indefensibly murdered someone…
But the flight home did at least offer some sort of reprieve, and Tony could still find a way to enjoy it.
“Whenever you’re ready”
And he only wanted it more when he heard Steve groan softly, his fingertips digging harder into Tony’s skin.

And, yeah, there were times when you looked at me a certain way, and God, I wanted to touch you…” His eyes drifted over Steve’s body, briefly – and then Tony shook the thought away… like he would a happy memory, made sad by the passage of time. “But I’d have settled for being the same as anyone else. To earn the same benefit of the doubt, the same trust – to be able to spend time with you and just be happy there, just be able to be with you. I

And, fuck, the overwhelming elation of
And Steve couldn’t bear that.
Tony was still thinking about Steve.
By then Steve had reached the breakroom, which, thankfully, was empty. Therefore he didn’t have to bother rearranging his features, or trying to remember what he did for a living, or any of that tedious stuff – he could just float over to the couch, and flop out into it, and fall back into his happy little dreamworld. God, everything still felt so much better. His limbs still felt looser, and mind felt freer, and that tension still hadn’t returned to his shoulders. This was a sort of comfort he hadn’t felt in years.

And then he felt Tony’s lips press oh-so-tenderly to his hip again, kissing the wound, then running his tongue very slowly over the cut.

he chided himself, as he poured his coffee…

He made himself wait there, for just a moment…
And he showed Steve the file reader, now displaying a random screen of research data.

Ahem.
...But none of this changed the ‘right thing to do’. It never had.
Steve didn’t spiral, the way Tony had. Steve had
For a moment Steve stood there, numb, a high pitched silence ringing in his ears, as an eerie, dizzy awareness came over him…
“Well, in my defence, I don’t pay nearly as much attention to hot hotel employees as I used to,” Tony blushed. And then he remembered, “

it still wasn’t, then.
Tony let his head rest on Steve’s shoulder for a moment, his thumb caressing over the back of Steve’s hand. Breathing in that familiar scent. Remembering that he was strong, and he was supposed to be here, and he was loved.

He grabbed for his phone, making a quick check of the time before he opened his contacts.
Why he
…It wasn’t even that the memory didn’t hurt anymore.
But he hadn’t yet considered all the reasons this might be a complete disaster.
Every step they took was liable to roll away from them. It seemed that every time they slipped, they ended up surfacing two steps back. Steve’s attempt to sink to the bottom and walk to the side was thwarted, when he couldn’t push the plastic balls out of his path. Tony’s attempt to swim to the side faltered at the first giggling attempt-
Oh, God, he didn’t know
, of course, Tony hated himself for being so pathetic. For letting a total stranger make him feel bad about actually having a life to lead-
There
Just a little bit defensive at having his motives questioned – especially when they were motives he was so sure about.
“Yeah baby?” Tony grinned, warmly amused and affectionate and so in control – not waiting for an answer before he pulled back and pushed deep into Steve again-
…When it had first occurred to him that one day Steve would grow old, and become frail…and die… And, what, Tony was just supposed to go on living for a thousand years after that?
So...um... it seems only fair to warn you... we're not *quite* at the happy ending yet.
The rest of the building was alive with people, humming with laughter and dancing and probably a few intoxicated arguments. Tony’s suite was dark, and very still. He could feel the music pulsing in the floor beneath him, the muffled sound of the revelry coming from such a long way away. Tony felt as though he was in a bubble deep under the water. Sealed off from all of reality…
how much Steve liked that-

Steve still felt guilty for thinking that. After all, this had been such an ominous, overbearing concept in his life, for so long… Part of him felt obliged to have
to investigate Steve. He couldn’t deny it. Ever since Tony was little, his first reaction to anything that frightened or frustrated him was to try to understand it better. To work out what a thing was made of, what made it tick - how to beat it.
But…he… didn’t feel guilty?
He felt Tony squeeze his shoulder again, before he slowly stroked his palm up to the back of Steve’s neck, letting it rest there…
“Rough how? Did something happen?” He demanded, making no effort to mask the immediate panic that had gripped him.
He thought of Tony’s fingernails digging into his skin-
He fixed Steve with a deliberate stare, running his thumb along Steve’s hairline as he smiled. Steve simply let it make him feel better.
“I should go. If they find out I was here, they’ll…”
But it was cut off again by another choking sob, another frantic attempt to swallow – and still he kept trying. “I’m sorry, I didn’t know, I’m so sorry-”

How often he’d wondered what might have happened, if only…

Tony swallowed roughly, and was just about to tell himself to get a grip, when his gaze dropped to the information listed beneath those horribly familiar images-
Without listing any of his new criteria or checking any of his new safeguards, Steve just
And then Tony’s fingers curled around his wrist, that grip even firmer and stronger than Steve remembered, a pure, calm power pulsing under his hand.

“Okay. So. I was thinking.” And he gestured back to the papers, because he didn’t have a hologram to point at. “What was so weird about all the things Dev said yesterday?”
“I’m sorry,” Steve whispered, on autopilot. He didn’t even know where the words had come from. Tony gave his head an affectionate little shake, and shuffled closer.
…And, Jesus, those had actually seemed like
He stripped out of the rest of his clothes and stepped into the shower as quickly as he could, with his legs as weak as they were. His skin felt as though it was crawling with dirt. And, even though he already knew he wouldn’t be able to wash it clean, he couldn’t think what else to do about it.

“Well, when you figure it out, can you at least give me a heads up if it’s gonna get me shot?” Bucky surrendered, rolling his eyes.

Well, which is about security, I suppose…” She paused, briefly, to yawn. “But, if you get invited up there, they ask you to take a pill before you go up.

Tony had had this conversation with himself enough times to know. As much as he wanted to – even if he
He moved more quickly this time, sweeping his tongue over the curve of Steve’s ass, sucking against his skin hard enough to bruise. Steve began to pant noisily, his bones trembling under the intensity of it, his head full of anguished pleading. He felt Tony’s other hand press against the inside of his thigh, his palm caressing firmly over the soft skin as he traced the tip of his tongue over the line of Steve’s groin, and then began lapping at the little trails of blood that were running over his balls. Steve clenched his teeth so hard it hurt his skull, now gripping the blankets so tightly that his knuckles were white.

And he loved it.
Why, now that he thought of it, he always stopped himself when that word was about to fall over his lips - why that was the
Clear, and complete, and confident-
Steve wasn’t so cold as to simply dismiss any chance to help a person - whether he happened to like them or not, as a matter of fact…
And that was as much of an idea as he was up to having.
“Oh, God Tony, fuck me, please fuck me, please” Steve whispered, not even talking to Tony, too far gone to know he was doing it. And Tony just carried on working him open, pushing his fingers into him again, and again, and Steve didn’t know whether to grind down against the mattress or push further back into this delicious friction, this perfect pleasure thrumming inside him-
In the end, he’d fallen into some sort of shallow compromise, drifting somewhere between awake and asleep. That strange, unsatisfying limbo, in which he was unable to direct his thoughts but still somehow aware of the time passing.

…But he
“So, walk away,” Bucky suggested, shuffling forward himself – obviously thinking the same thing that Steve was. “No offence, but no one is going to bother going after the doctor. They’re going to want the guy running this place – unless you kill Captain America. If you do that, it’s the end for you. You know it.”
Steve felt like all his breaths were collecting high up in his lungs, his heartbeat increasing as he tugged hesitantly against Tony’s grip… And then a little harder…
“It’s okay, I’m not going to push it now,” Bucky assured him, like he could read Steve’s mind. “I’m just giving you some advance warning here. I know you like to get your own head right with things first, sometimes. I know you’re not one of those people who
“So what do you want from us?” Steve asked, robotically, his chest aching all over again - his fear of losing Tony back on the table, along with everything else. And he looked over at Tony.
and literally, at that very moment,
“I’m sorry I sent you away, I’m sorry for the things I said,” Tony answered in a rush. “I didn’t mean any of that-”
Tony found himself grinning, in spite of his bad mood. He thought back to his life before The Facility… How lost and lonely and
And Tony could at least be sure that his shock would’ve looked genuine.

Steve gasped, his eyes snapping open again.
to panic about being caught… although, to be honest, that instinct was starting to wane, as… he just became more comfortable in the situation-
It was unlike any intoxication he’d ever experienced, even from drinking Steve’s blood-

Even a battle response that deeply engrained had faded away now

He took in all of these details in a very basic, primal way… And decided, just as primally –

this. This was so easy, and good, and right…
Steve’s cringe flickered deeper, his whole body clenching inwards with the anxiety of what he’d just said out loud.
… somewhat surprised by how heavy his body was.
Whatever happened, it couldn’t possibly be worse than the way he met Tony the first time around.
And this revelation just kept unfolding in Steve’s mind – clear, and coherent, and concise – as Tony continued, breathlessly,
Tony dropped to his knees to save himself from collapsing flat out onto his back. He felt like he was weightless, like he was floating away from the ground, away from himself. His vision was blotted with stars, his skin was filmed in sweat, his tongue was still coated with that perfect,

He had too much energy, too much excitement - too much happiness - to contain. He had no idea how he was going to pretend to care what Alexander Pierce had to say-
to be on an alien drug planet for that to fuck up the whole world, now did they?
Steve heard himself whimper pitifully, as that heat rolled through him, the sensation pulsing through every fluid inch of him.
“No, obviously – I wouldn’t make you explain anyway, you know that.”
Tony’s eyes running over his throat.
They had all just been there in the real world, the same people they’d always been, before everything changed for

It wasn’t quite the comfort it usually was.
“Because usually
“Why?” Pepper frowned.
Not that he’d be able to tell Tony what he thought about it, even if he did find the words. Steve wasn’t sure what he was feeling right now, but he was sure it was something intimate and personal, and fundamentally entangled with his crush on Tony… Something he could never explain to Tony, even if he managed to explain it to himself.
Tony lowered his eyes, and took a little step back.

He shook his head decidedly, and closed the case with a firm snap, reiterating to himself-
And he saw the tiniest nod from Bucky,
“What? No,” Sam shook his head, clearly baffled. “No, that’s not what I’m saying at all-”
“Steve? Just so you know, we have a visitor.”
“And… what?” Bucky frowned at him. “You don’t think he loves you back?”
That gentle touch to his jaw had been like an electric shock, a command he followed automatically-
Tony sighed, and settled back against Steve’s chest.
Which, amongst other things, was making him feel increasingly restless.
Steve wondered how
That he already knew all the reasons he couldn’t be what Steve needed, that it would be unfair to let Steve tie himself to him…all those risks Steve would be taking… Tony tried to believe that he’d remember the importance of all those things, in time.
“No, thank

Contrary to his initial expectations, there wasn’t very much in the folder that had been redacted… which made Steve ever more curious about the few details that

Steve smiled sadly, and nodded, so adorably earnest that Tony almost kissed him again.
“Mall cops…” He murmured to himself, trying to take some reassurance in it. He finally braved a step out into the open, and took a good look around. And then he turned to Bucky-
to you, I didn’t know what level of interested or impressed or attracted or grateful to be, because I knew I couldn’t tell you how much of all of that I really felt-”
“No,” Bucky replied, with a faux innocent shake of his head, as though he had no idea why Thor would even suggest it.
something. Steve knew he was.
There was a sudden commotion from the other end of the bar. They both looked over in unison, to see an enthusiastic server standing on top of it, waving for the patrons’ attention. Steve felt the chatter around them simmer to a hush.
the fuck had just happened – he had no way to be sure that the danger had passed.
But for whatever reason, Tony now found himself caught up in a wave of emotions that he’d never felt before - and free from all the neurosis and nervousness that would usually be there.
Or, sometimes, Tony would take a few minutes to appreciate how it felt to be in his own body. He’d just sit there, or stand there, and let this power flow through him, and feel the strength throbbing in his muscles and the
far away… That he’d know, if Steve had been taken miles and miles away from him…
Steve backed the car into the specified bay behind Tony Stark’s mansion. He cut the engine, and then pulled his cell phone out of his pocket so that he could switch it off, as instructed. And then he took a moment to look up at the house…
“I promise you, we’re not leaving until we fix this thing.” Steve told her, with that pure and warm sincerity that only he could pull off “We will stop them poisoning you, and we’ll help you close this place down. I promise you that.”
And safe.
He saw Nick’s face shift into the superior expression of a parent who was about to humour an irritable toddler. Which irritated Steve even more.
This was a start.
Steve
“Is that what you thought that fight was about?” Steve shot back, sarcastically. “I thought you were only there because Tony asked you to stay indoors while he dealt with your many arrest warrants. Silly me.”
...But then he saw that video.
He felt every sensation more keenly, he saw everything in more detail, he could hear entirely new layers of sound echoing in the building around him. His whole body seemed to burn with a sheer abundance of everything, an energy that was created faster than he could consume it.

And it was important.
“Probably not, no.”
“If we go through the side exit” Steve gestured vaguely to a door on the right, “There’s that corridor with the dead end, around a corner.”
Sometimes he thought of Steve begging to be bitten… And in an instant Tony would remember that that was terrifying, and exciting, and disgusting, and soothing, and vindicating in two entirely separate directions… And it was a crap shoot as to which line of thought he followed for the next few seconds.
“You’re sure?”
Tony cringed, and glanced away again. And Steve heard a little voice hiss at him, like an embarrassed elder sibling,
And then he asked, simply,
Not sure himself which one of them he was talking to… and neither of them could answer him, for another moment.
The second wave of sensation crashed over Steve a moment after Tony stopped moving, like the wall of exhaustion that doesn’t hit an athlete until two feet

It wasn’t everything. There were still as many anxieties about the situation as there had ever been, and that emptiness was still there, and Steve still felt unnervingly emotional, right now… But it had done something for that physical desperation, used up some of that adrenaline.
Tony hated himself for smiling at that.
was… suddenly last night seemed uncomfortably one-sided.
“Oh fuck, Tony-” Steve gasped, cut short as Tony rolled his palm over the head of his cock.
“Something happen?” Steve asked, immediately switching into his Captain America head.
A different sort of nervousness began to gather in Steve’s chest. Something simple and physical and perfectly human… Something that felt closer to excitement than fear.
Within seconds Tony had pushed Steve to that fine line between bliss and agony, the intense, immediate pleasure stoking that painful need for more. The drag of Tony’s fingers sending wave after wave of electric shocks right through the core of him, finally pressing against that aching, internal longing – but not breaking it. Teasing it. Deliberately provoking that desperation-
They way his gaze fell on the curve of Steve’s waist, like it was drawn to something. The careful, searching pressure of his palm, slowly stroking its way down the side of Steve’s body. The awareness of Tony’s movements and the calm intensity on his face and the physical control that radiated from him… There was something almost spiritual about it. Ancient, and powerful, and

half a mile in diameter. At the front, directly ahead of where they’d come in, was a curved silver stage, framed on each side by ornate columns the size of skyscrapers. The stadium-style seating around the edge of the room towered so high that Tony had to strain his neck to see the top of it - and when he looked up, he saw that the ceiling was dotted with millions of brightly sparkling lights, in thousands of different colours, every bit as vast and humbling as the night sky…
And that probably started him on the most surreal train of thought of the entire day, without him even realising.
“And then Vienna happened and it just… all collapsed, I don’t – I didn’t – you say it’s nothing to do with The Accords, but they scared me to death anyway, and I
He wasn’t sure if it was gradually wearing off or if it was… settling in. It wasn’t like any intoxication he’d ever felt before; the side-effects weren’t easily grouped into any ‘type’ of high, and didn’t seem to be following any sort of pattern.
“Come on, let’s see.” Tony muttered, walking quickly and carefully toward the railing. Steve fell in step beside him, both of them slowing up as they got closer, trying to get a subtle look at what was down there before anything down there could see them.

Because it was complicated.
“I apologise, sir. But you were quite clear that I should inform you of any changes to Sergeant Barnes’ condition” JARVIS reminded him, diplomatically. “Specifically, you asked to be informed when the general anaesthetic wore off.”
There was a deep stab of visceral pleasure, all the way down Steve’s spine, hotter and sharper and

Steve is in trouble. And I haven’t got time to convince you that I’m okay right now, so you’re just going to have to trust me,” Tony explained in a rush, trying to keep his voice level. “But I’ve got to call the Avengers back, and then I’ve got to work on finding him, and – you can either stay here and watch me do it, or you can go, and I’ll call you later,” he concluded, putting the flyer down on the counter top so that he could fish his phone out of his pocket again.
“Okay, I spoke to Natasha,” Pepper was already telling him, before she’d even looked up. “Apparently she was alerted by your earlier call, and – why do you have a metal arm?”
She smiled and shook her head – there was no money allowed at The Facility. It was all covered by the not insignificant fee that Tony had stumped up to ensure this in the first place.
All that analysis and consideration and literal bending of the time space continuum, all so he could end up hiding away in the shower with his anxieties.

“No, that wasn’t the apology Steve – that’s just the headline. I’m not done,” he frowned, almost teasingly… “If ‘I’m sorry for what I did’ was good enough, I

Steve broke out into a high pitched cry as Tony’s cock hit that sweet spot deep inside him, a sharp sensation cracking through him, his shoulders going limp under the force of it. “Oh, God, again, there, please-

I could think of problems with all my ideas too, so I didn’t say them, didn’t think of offering them as a starting point… In fairness to you, it’s harder to listen to someone, if that someone finds it hard to say what they’re thinking anyway…”
“Okay gentlemen, it seems this afternoon’s misunderstanding has been straightened out, and you’ve been cleared for release,” he said, by way of greeting. Bucky, Sam and Tony exchanged a suspicious look, before Tony declared himself the spokesperson and asked,

Somewhat unnerved by the way things kept shifting under the weight of this one revelation.
He was expecting the event to be uncomfortable, and confusing, and to spend the whole time looking for the first opportunity to leave…
Which is to say, everything changes in the next chapter ;-)

After all those chapters where they're emotional, and only focusing on one part of it, and in the middle of a revelation... this is where I'm laying out how they actually feel, at this stage in their lives. So (I'm nervous as hell about this, but) just to put it into context.
human - it was an impulse to think of it in an entirely human way.
Steve stilled immediately, coming to a somewhat tense rest against the bed. Tony felt a heat bloom up inside him, watching Steve pinned by a single word from him-
Whatever the reason, it had been days - maybe weeks - since Steve found himself halted by the memory of him…
’. Because Tony
Wondering if JARVIS would’ve told Tony when he arrived… If Tony was inside, wondering why Steve was being weird and rude and just staying in the car…
Panting now, Tony managed to shrug his way out of his shirt, clumsily tossing it to the side of the room. And, seeing as he’d apparently remembered how his arms worked, he took the opportunity to snatch frantically at Steve’s T-shirt, clawing it up along his back with far less grace and gentleness than Steve commanded-
But the more important point was that this was the first time in
Was he just refusing to think about all these twisted, bitter feelings because he didn’t want to? Because it would be confusing, and frightening, and because he didn’t

into the intensity of that gaze, losing himself completely in the look of honest wonder on Steve’s face.
“No one is going to know who killed Captain America,” Stape said, his voice moving higher in his chest, the gun trembling more obviously in his hand.
Through the fog in his head a little voice observed,

“...So, what are the other two weeks for?” Tony raised a quizzical eyebrow.
arguing in his head – about what was right, and what really mattered, and what he owed, and what he should do – were all finally speaking in one harmonised chorus.
What if he’d never be able to say it back?
“Okay,” Tony began, slowly. “So, new plan-”
The fact that this man had saved the entire world, on more than one occasion.
Even if,
He saw Steve take a sharp breath, a nervous excitement flashing up in his eyes. Tony caressed his palm up along Steve’s neck, until he was cradling the side of his face. He could feel the anticipation building in Steve’s shoulders…
And he shifted a little, gently putting his hand to the side of Tony’s face,

lost, and lonely, and angry about what had happened to him…
Tony had come into the room through the side doors, closer to Steve and Bucky than the man they were staring at.

“You think I’m mad” Adam observed, casually. “But, really, the only reason you think that is because what I’m telling you falls so far outside of what you already know. You know, human beings invented a communication network that allowed the disenfranchised masses to share their ideas directly, without having to get passed a gatekeeper. Sell their labour directly, without having to impress a corporation or know a network of rich investors. And they fret, in case it ends the bricks and mortar store, and the printed press. Never mind that a system of physical stores and millionaire owned media has, for generations, maintained a system of privilege and patriarchy and capitalism. We

And there was something that felt good about that, completely aside from his personal discomfort. Like the terrified joy of breaking through the enemy’s line - knowing that he’d broken the real barrier, no matter how painful and messy the conflict beyond it.
know all of SHIELDs secrets, so I won’t have to study to use them to my advantage,” Steve began, confidently. “I’m more likely to survive a fight with a Norse God, seeing as they’re not likely to let you wear the suit. You’re the one they’ve asked for, so it’s less likely to play into their hand if I turn up. And because,” he finished dramatically, “I have an idea.”
He took another deep breath, which came much easier this time. He felt so much better for simply having a list.
He put them all aside very carefully before, gleefully, he pulled the Photostatic Veil away from his face. Having worn the damn thing to work every day for months, Steve had still never completely gotten used to it, and had spent most of his shifts fighting a temptation to claw at his cheeks. He was very pleased to think that, whatever happened, he would never have to wear that face again.
“Okay,” Steve grinned, and struggled to his feet. He waited until he was at the door to add, softly, “thank you.”
him, almost immediately on top of that spike of concern. A thick wall of intoxication that almost threw Tony backwards before it engulfed him completely. His head swam as though he’d been struck… but without the pain. Just the feeling of the floor shifting under his feet, and his vision exploding into stars, his thoughts literally knocked out of his head.
Apologies that it has taken me literally a week to *proofread* a chapter that was written a month ago - It's been a hectic Christmas 😂

been a few minutes, back at the tower, when the trauma of the afternoon had hit him – all at once, and seemingly out of nowhere.
...There was no way out of this now.
An static, dragging sensation, pulling just below the surface - something Tony had never felt before.
He wanted to stop wondering how Tony felt, and second-guessing everything he did, and planning a thousand contingencies for every move he made…
family and made plans
“Here,” he said, awkwardly dropping a heavy set of keys into Steve’s hand. “There’s a house a way down the beach, by the pier - the address is on the tag. It belongs to the company - to Stark Industries - I think it was employee housing or rented out or something, until last week…” And then he caught himself, waving away the unnecessary details and bringing himself back to the point. “But yeah… no one is really thinking about it, no one is staying there - I don’t think anyone even knows I have the keys, actually. I took them home by accident… So, yeah, if you need somewhere to stay, I don’t think anyone will look for you there…”
But if this was his gut trying to tell him that Steve just really needed a hug, having the Avengers crash his meeting probably wouldn’t help…
“That must be getting expensive, by now.”
Oh, Steve
might’ve been mad about. He’d known that he couldn’t talk to Tony about what happened without talking about any of that. That, if they did end up talking about those things, then Steve wouldn’t be able to lie about them, and it would make it sound like he wasn’t sorry, and they would only fight again… And, if Steve thought he’d been scared of that
And, really, it was only that Steve recognised them as his own words. That was the anchor, between what Tony had said and any sort of cognitive activity…
By the time Tony was forced to break away they were both panting. Steve’s pupils were blown wide, his lips dark and swollen, his skin glowing with exertion.
“Why not?”
“Yeah, I think so… you kind of lose track, until you look up the date, you know?” She commented lightly, like she was expecting him to relate.
Not anymore.
And maybe there
Oh, this was a lot-
Steve had to remind himself that it literally wasn’t possible for his heart to stop.
But Steve had caught the taste of blood, now.
There was a sort of mass confusion in him, as every instinct panicked at once. His body didn’t know whether to soften or tense, whether to melt into this or push up against it. He just
And then Tony dropped his head to press a slow, tender kiss to the small of Steve’s back, as he stroked his palms over the curve of Steve’s ass-

He found a cabinet full of deep, dark red – no.
Whatever the answer to either of those questions – Tony already knew that the Steve he’d been mad at didn’t really exist.
“So why did
He could feel it starting to wobble. The cascade of enlightenment that was going to come crashing down on him. The feeling that he finally understood what Bucky’s rant was really about, that he was going to find words for it in a minute, that it was going to be horrible...
to pay you?” Tony corrected, with an air of impatience. He felt Steve take a step closer to him… The quiet power that radiated from him, that maybe only Tony could feel, at this stage…
“Of course yours,” Tony promised. And then seemed to drift into talking to himself as he added “…I’d never drink anyone’s blood but yours… I couldn’t…”
Steve felt a pleasant blush warm up along his neck…
And then he took a brave little breath, and looked Tony right in the eye, and told him.
It didn’t matter whether that one
...So, maybe Tony would just have to be a grown up and accept that ‘getting over Steve’ wasn’t going to mean that his feelings changed overnight, or any of his hopeless desires disappeared in a puff of smoke.

He still didn’t have an answer to any of the questions that had occurred to him at random, all morning.

“Steve?” Bucky prompted gently, and Steve snapped out of it.
“Everyone has,” Tony shrugged. And, with that, Steve realised…
“...Only a hundred and twenty people in the entirety of existence get a ticket each year,” Galileo finished with a flourish. And then, as Tony was searching for the least vocal way to bring this interlude to a close, Steve commented nonchalantly,

“And I’m sorry about that…fight, we had at the compound, by the way – with the pens.” He remembered out loud. Steve blinked in surprised.
And Steve was so instantly wounded by that remark - and by what he

“Okay, guys-” Bruce attempted to cut in-
And then a low curl of white hot pleasure ground through his hips, briefly overwhelming all that tension, washing the resistance out of him as it rolled up along his spine. Steve fell weak against it, as Tony pressed the tip of his tongue harder against his rim, pushing deeper into him, sending more and more of those little eclectic shivers up through his softened muscles…

Now, this pleasure was all there was – the intensity of it, the build of it, the desperate need for more of it even as it was crashing over him-

sound like a pretty dumb plan,” Tony acknowledged, with a self deprecating sigh. But, before he could try to think of a better one, Bucky lifted his robe away from his shoulders - presumably looking for some relief from the heavy heat of the outfit - and sparked such a blinding array of flashes that it made Tony’s eyes water.
A way to get to more of Steve.
And then Tony slowed his pace just a little, moving to stroke both of his hands over Steve’s hips more deliberately, shifting his weight before he buried himself into Steve again. He hit Steve’s prostate, rolling his pelvis into him before he pulled back, more slowly. Steve let out a howling moan as the shock of it jolted through him, his balls drawing tight and cock throbbing sharply. A sudden burst of almost painful intensity that burned out into a needy physical hunger.

“I think that’s a yes.” He sighed, trying to keep the animosity out of his voice. And then he looked back at her. “So, how long have you been here?”
He thought about kissing him, but he didn’t trust himself to stop after a minute – and he really couldn’t complicate Steve’s escape plan and have Sam shot down over the Tower or something. Not tonight. So, instead he stepped forward and put a tender hand over Steve’s heart, and told him.

And I didn’t really have time to think about it then, because Nick Fury was covered in blood. And telling me that SHIELD was compromised. And then a few minutes later the room exploded in bullets, and the neighbour I actually thought I was friends with burst in to call for backup…” he trailed off into a bitter laugh.
Steve swallowed another whimper as the relief heated into a compulsive, needy longing.

An understanding that bloomed in him, outside of words-
“Whenever you’re ready” Dev prompted.
“You can knock a guy out without doing any real harm,” Bucky challenged, turning to glare directly at Sam.
“The keys,” Tony explained, putting the envelope down on the side table with a dull metalling thud. And
“Wait, woah - you’re leaving?”
That his strangely pleasant melancholy in this moment might not be so different from the simple human sadness of aging, and changing, and letting things go.
And Steve would’ve liked to express the deep joy that swelled up in him then. He’d have liked to have shown Tony what it meant to him, that Tony was satisfied, that Tony was
It didn’t occur to him that it could be anyone else.
Well, no, that wasn’t entirely true – part of Tony wanted to crawl into Steve’s arms and bury his head in Steve’s neck and ask him to drown out all those words…
He groaned, and gave his feet a kick. And then he let go of a very deliberate sigh, and tried to make his peace with it.

“I dunno… I guess this is usually where I start to worry about all the things that might happen…” Bucky explained, thoughtfully.
Steve’s head was still spinning.
But Tony nodded, like he understood.
that his value, and his power, weren’t directly linked to his physical strength. He could tell himself that he was more than that, and mean it.
“Well, it could be any number of things. I mean, yeah, they should’ve put more details down – but you know they don’t always…” her voice trailed off, defeated, when she saw that he’d turned his attention back to his phone.
Instinctively, Tony recognised that there was something about this that wasn’t how it usually was… Something he liked.
Tony was fairly sure that the fruit juice was
And Tony wondered…
...Steve could never go anywhere that time travel didn’t exist.

“Would you like to try something a bit different?” He enquired, cheerfully.

“Shut up Steve, I have the talking stick right now,” Bucky warned him, playfully, and waited for Steve to pinch his lips together before he carried on. “I

“And, anyway, it’s mostly selfish…” Tony breezed on.
He felt Tony knead his fingers into hips,
But, on the other hand, the more capable he was of thinking, the more thinking he did -
Every time he tried to sit down he’d feel his heartbeat building up under his ribs again, pushing more and more energy into his over tense muscles, until it became painful to try and contain it. He’d straightened his shirt so many times that the skin under his collar was starting to feel sore. Even the slow breaths he forced himself to take trembled with excitement.
“This entire building is hooked up to a hydraulic gas release system,” Tony explained, authoritative and mildly impatient. Nat was the first to get over the surprise, her face hardening into concentration again almost immediately – so Tony directed the rest of his speech at her. “Best guess, several places in the building are set up to gas intruders before they can even reach for a weapon. So, you can’t go in there until that system is shut down.”
A lot of the principles they each held dear-

And Tony loved him.
because it would be more efficient to explain everything to them directly.
“Don’t!” Steve tried to give him a stern look – but, nope, he was giggling again…
It mattered that it was the opposite of everything that had ever made Steve uncomfortable with this idea.
He could hear Wesley retching as he closed the door behind them.
An idea that seemed far too perfect in the first instance… That seemed to grow more satisfying the more he considered it…
So, eventually he simply let himself trail off into silence, and waited – not sure anymore whether he was hoping to get out of this conversation or dearly hoping that Tony would carry on.

And, for the first time in days, Tony found himself putting together a legitimate train of thought – one he actually felt in control of.

Even with all these new revelations, he would always have been stuck without some offering from Steve… And yeah, he could’ve apologised for the whole Bucky thing sooner, he could have amended a few individual mistakes. Maybe he’d have been less inarticulately furious, when they finally saw each other again…
Steve could still hate every spiteful ideologue who had inadvertently put him on this course. He could still imagine an ideal world, in which he could have met Tony without

In the end it was basically fluke which idea he grabbed for-
He felt Tony snuggle against him, and he glanced down. He found Tony looking up at him with those warm, dark eyes, a soft sort of sympathy in his expression…
And Steve
Steve… eased up… a little…
So, awful though it was, Steve stopped fighting that fear. He stopped trying to stay calm, dropped all attempts to put it out of his mind or rationalise it. Instead, he began to actively indulge the worst trauma he could possibly imagine-

And, as such, it came as of something of a surprise to recognise that he was already gripped by this entirely illogical, purely physical thrill… thinking of the blood draining from his body…
“Seriously, what the hell is this?” He demanded, grinning too much to really nail the delivery. “Who ever heard of a ball pit where you have to tread water?”
“Hi,” Tony deadpanned. Beside him, he heard Bucky hum a smile, a little sound he recognised as a stifled laugh… And he felt his cheeks prickle in response…

What if he learned something he didn’t want to know?
And it wasn’t that he had no guilt over any of his past decisions, all of a sudden.
everyone thinks that’s so paranoid and… It’s just, sometimes you hear people say, ‘this is how Nazi Germany happened’, about some policy decision in a modern company or a Western Democracy… and everyone always rolls their eyes, because it always sounds so dramatic, and people always think they’re so far away from that… but I was there, and

… And uncluttered, and light, and…
“Well, the first question is what do I need to know,” Tony corrected, and waved a hologram into life in the space between them.
“...Would you care to elaborate on that?” JARVIS suggested, wryly.
“You?” Tony raised his eyebrows.
“Are there any other times you’ve felt… like that?” Tony carried on, sounding more cautious with each new question. “Was there something that Wesley said, or did, that made you feel different-”
. I don’t know. I don’t think I’d be outside right now if it weren’t for Steve… and I don’t think I’d be outside right now if it weren’t for you. I don’t think there’d be a me for Steve to save, and if there was I don’t think he could have, so… I think that’s roughly what I’m trying to say,” Tony surrendered, accepting that those were all the words he had right now.
“Oh, Tony, Jesus fuck, oh, oh God-” Steve babbled, clenching around Tony’s fingers, grabbing desperately at the back of Tony’s head-
Being a petulant and precocious child, Tony had quickly learned to hate that on a superficial level. Some of his earliest memories were of being frustrated to the point of tears by the choices that people made for him, or the things people said on his behalf. His mother once told him that his first words were
“Do you regret it?” He asked, sadly. Even though he was scared to death of the answer. Even though he was vaguely ashamed to have asked.

But, as it happened, he was laughing at how very

As per usual, any suggestions for tags I've missed or need to amend would be gratefully received!
It would’ve been a nice revelation, if he’d had room for it right now.
When Tony saw the delighted excitement that flashed up in Steve’s eyes, and the euphoric relief that washed through his body, he was overwhelmed by such emotion that he felt literally unsteady on his feet-
Remembering a

Not that he’d given much thought to the

Twelve letters written from a Vampire named Dimitri to someone named Demi – who Tony assumed was also a vampire, but couldn’t tell for sure… Dimitri’s letters had contained very little detail about Demi, or indeed Dimitri. They didn’t give any clue as to where or when they were being written, they made no mention of recent events or the current political climate or… well, anything at all, except Ottilie.

much more to be excited about…
However he ended up making peace with this thing, he was always going to care if Steve was lost somewhere, wasted, in the wilderness - so, he might as well go from there.
“And… At least the first time, you’ll have to bring it yourself.” Tony finished, almost reluctantly.
Just as Tony shook himself to his senses.

“You don’t remember what hit you?” He asked.
“No, of course I don’t regret it,” Tony promised, giving his head a little shake of disbelief… But still, there was something he was holding back, Steve could see it.
“Well, you know how to get in touch with us,” Nick sighed, when it became clear that Tony wasn’t going to say anything. “Think it over. See if you might want to come in for a look around, at least.”
“So, he just knocked on your door, uninvited, and demanded to know where I was, and that was all he told you?” Steve clarified. Tony recognised the ominous,

“You know, to begin with - none of last night was your fault. You were amazing last night - I mean, even before…” And he had to pause while Tony snorted a surprised little giggle “...But I mean it, I don’t know what I would’ve done without you to deal with… everything… last night…”
The sudden shift in his perception, the immediate burden of responsibility, the overwhelming self-recrimination as he recognised how wrong he’d gotten it so far… The fresh realisation of how very much he wanted this thing, now that there was the slightest chance that he could have it.

I know that isn’t you. I also know that you aren’t Clint, or Nat, or Scott, in case you thought I’d lost my damn mind” Tony sighed, and Steve breathed a soft little laugh. “And I think we can all agree that, whatever you could’ve done differently when you put that team together, or whatever – you really can’t be held responsible for Clint’s choice of words on the raft. When you weren’t even there. I don’t know why I was yelling at you for something Nat said to me, when you were half way across Europe.

“So...What is the priority?” Steve asked, his eyebrow still raised. “Where do you want to start, I mean?”

Steve was so perfectly contented, so deeply and completely comfortable. His mind was calm, and mostly quiet – except for the occasional happy observation that he allowed to just drift through.
Because, actually, Tony had spent a
Or bury his head in Tony’s neck, and surrender to that soft quality in his voice…
But, y’know… It just didn’t seem as frustrating a concept, as it once had.
But at some point, a thought had occurred to him - a thought that didn’t immediately drift out of his mind, like all the others. A thought that kept repeating, the same words and intonation, on a loop… like a song he couldn’t get out of his head.
Yeah, okay. He was actually very grateful that he didn’t have to do just one more thing, today.
Actually, Tony was already awake.

Both reason and experience told him that he only drank blood when he had to – that he only drank blood

Steve saw a flash of stunned confusion in Tony’s eyes, and then a wave of realisation.
“So… where does yours come from?”
“Would you be making this offer, if we’d never had sex?” Tony asked, somewhat abruptly. And Steve’s only reaction to that was,
And Steve wasn’t sure
“I knew it at the time. And it wasn’t like I didn’t
Instinctively, Tony stepped back into the suite as quickly as possible, slamming the door behind him before he looked down at the little package in his hands. That had all happened so quickly, it felt like he’d imagined it…

he started rationalising it like this…
“So, I have a theory.” Tony announced, before Steve could say anything. Steve could see the way he thought ahead of what he was saying, the way his eyes kept darting back to the papers, like the back of his head was still working on it, even as he was talking to Steve. Steve remembered the speedy, animated patter of his voice when he talked this way, he knew that any minute now Tony was going to take a little step back and open his arms, like he was at the beginning of a presentation.
That he had just overcome a massive personal barrier, and done something he’d been terrified of for nearly two decades…
He considered the fact that he was always going to care about Steve… which slowly became an acceptance that he might always love Steve. It wasn’t as though Steve had stopped being any of the things that Tony fell in love with in the first place…
And it meant them taking responsibility for that choice, and all the other choices that came with it.
Because no matter how many times he reminded himself what he should be feeling, Steve still just felt like this. He’d tried to force a more sensible set of priorities into his head, but his mind just defaulted right back to Tony the moment his concentration slipped. And, failing all that, he’d even tried
“Oh, we’re good” Tony leapt in to answer for Steve – still not able to turn and look at him. “We’re excited, really. It’s just, you know, first time doing… anything like this...” He felt an inch of relief when he saw her nod reassuringly, her lips melting into an understanding smile.
As it was, there was only that little ring of melancholy, as Steve observed the sadness for a Tony he could never make it right with…
“What was he even doing?” Pepper added, gesturing to the stage.

is not the end of the world. This is you make an understandable mistake, and I’m hurt, and you say sorry and then I’m not hurt any more and it’s fine. And then I’m not angry and I still love you, and you’re still…”
And Tony felt very calm.
He’d almost worked up some enthusiasm for the idea, before that ominous resistance began to swell in his chest. That wordless feeling that it was likely to be more confusing than he expected and more effort than it was worth. The instinct to prepare for frustration and disappointment, which was apparently just his default setting now.
…Climbing into Steve’s lap at the Christmas party last year, armed with a sprig of plastic mistletoe and a cheesy joke, and being pleasantly surprised that Steve actually kissed him… and kept kissing him…

Tony hadn’t realised just how much he’d come to rely on his digitised textbooks and hologram displays, until several box files of dusty old medical reports had been delivered to his office.

If there was one lesson Tony had learned, repeatedly,
Steve could feel the way it warmed under Tony’s hands, the way it pushed to the surface of his skin. He could feel it moving in every inch of his body, like it was stroking over his nerves, bringing everything into higher definition…
But he didn’t. He just stared back, and waited for Steve to finish.
“Hey, hey, can you hear me?” Tony tried to keep his voice calm and level. The photographer simply groaned in response. “Hey, come on pal, I need you to answer me, can you hear me?” Tony spoke more sharply, leaning closer.
“… So, sometime this evening, we do our best to break into the basement, and go from there?” Steve concluded. And Tony nodded.
That was a purely physical reaction, and there was no need to be childish about it.
He shivered, happily.

“So, you want to cultivate these plants on planet Earth, so that people on Earth stop worrying about material things, and are just… happy?” Tony clarified, carefully. And Adam chuckled, warmly.
“If they’re dosing the water, or the air… or any other way they’re doing it, they must have a distribution system somewhere on this site.” Steve observed, his voice more assured now that Captain America was using it.
“Ready,” he smiled nonchalantly, resting his head on his interlocked hands. And, in spite of everything, Tony managed to smile back – that just seemed very Bucky.
...Like he was a pet, or something.
Steve was just beginning to get lost in it, when Tony cut in again,
“Steve?” Tony’s voice dragged him back into the room.
And then, like a knife plunging into the very core of his reality, his phone rang.
“Yeah. And, yeah, right now Hydra have him frozen somewhere, just waiting to use him to kill someone else… And there’s nothing he can do about it. He has no control over it…” Steve trailed off, as he watched Tony struggle with that idea for a moment.

“Well, that wasn’t really a lie,” Tony muttered, “that was really just incredible foresight…” And Steve huffed another laugh, while Tony gave him a little nod,

Except that Nick just couldn’t resist that last little comment.
So, Steve just cuddled closer to him, exhaling deeply before he whispered,

And Captain America? Captain America would say he absolutely shouldn’t put either himself or Tony in this position. Especially if he couldn’t bring himself to be honest with Tony about the real risk he was taking.

that surged through him as the greater physical relief.
Something slipped, setting off a chain of sensations that Steve knew he couldn’t stop. A tight, pulsing pleasure that was running on its own power now, pushing him ever closer - so close-
He imagined Stape laughing at him, gloating, being deliberately cruel. He imagined Stape knowing every one of his darkest fears and exploiting them expertly… in the way that only Steve’s own mind could manage, in fact.

“I wish you had told me that.” Tony breathed.

“Or that note was written by a Varian.” Tony finished for him, his tone just as weary now.
And then Tony looked up at him – the strangest look on his face. Like he wasn’t quite sure whether to smile or not. Not alarmed, or concerned, exactly… but…

Tony poured more lube over his hand before pushing two fingers into him, slow and deep, watching Steve throw his head back further, balling the sheets into a fist.
Now Steve found himself thinking that he’d been proven right on a lot of things. All those things he was considered deluded for believing, by literally everyone – all those things he wasn’t even allowed to say, because it was clear what the response would be… Back then, it was pretty unusual to wonder why only women were expected to be virgins on their wedding night. It was rare for any man to consider that his partner

, now.
“No, I know, that probably sounds really arrogant,” Tony cut him off with a wince. “And I don’t think I’m going to break your heart or anything - I don’t think I’m that important. I just mean… I mean, we work together, and we actually get on these days, and… I do like you… But none of that means we really know each other,” he sighed, resignedly. “You don’t know what a nightmare I am, for a start. You don’t know how bad I am in relationships of any kind, how many bad habits and character flaws I have-”
Tony threw his arms around Steve’s neck, moaning against his mouth, another wave of pleasure rolling though him as Steve rocked his hips. And then he let one hand run along Steve’s shoulder, and thought of the perfect, powerful body pressed against him, those pretty lips, kissing him right now, that beautiful cock, inside him,

“Well, no,” Steve answered thoughtfully. “I think Fritz Harber knowingly, willingly, signed up to an evil, poisonous political regime, and I don’t want to downplay that,” he said, as though to make clear he wasn’t making this concession out of any affection for Fury, but rather a specific hatred of the Nazis. “I think Fury is just arrogant, and short sighted, and far too sure of his own point of view, and far too willing to dismiss the consequences for others… That’s not the same thing.” And then he paused, a flicker of thought creasing his forehead before he added, “
But, for all that, there was something nostalgic about this specific sensation…
“We should probably go look for them,” Rhodey suggested.
And thinking that brought him back into the real world a little bit – at least enough to process the fact that there was apparently someone else in their room. That sounded like something that required attention.

to catalogue his thoughts and get into the right mindset… The fact that Bucky had always understood that, had always been happy to meet him there, on those occasions that Steve could walk.

Whether he should just get a grip and start thinking about all this in order-
“Honestly… I don’t really know what my line is, or what I even think about, sex or…well anything, half of the time. But, I think, wherever my line is… I don’t think anything that could happen here would be worse than being frozen for seventy years. I don’t think, wherever my line is, that something like this would be, uh, closer to it than the helicarriers. I mean, unless I upset you. So, I don’t know, maybe I’m just saying the same thing…”
Maybe this excuse had found
“And, more than anything, actually, I’m sorry I didn’t say I was sorry sooner. Properly, I mean. And I’m most sorry for that because… The thing is, Tony, you’re right. I do find it hard. And… maybe it isn’t quite the same for me, and maybe there are reasons I find it hard and… Hearing you say that, it just, meant so much… and you were right, it’s probably hurt me as much as anyone.
sorry for what I did to you and Bucky-”
And, for the first time ever, it occurred to Steve that he could ask why it was still a secret. That he actually had a right to object - that maybe he
“Beautiful, and strong, and brave…” Tony purred, rocking into him. Steve felt Tony’s cock pressed hard against the small of his back, and a little tug low in his gut – different to the spike of desire that would usually be there. An affectionate, sentimental urge, something warm and safe and without sharp edges.

But Tony could imagine what it would look like if he did. That was all that mattered in this moment – not how likely it was, not now many problems it would cause, not analysing the reasons Steve might have for liking it. Just the mental image of Steve, relaxing into his grip, smiling at him, whispering,
He looked up at Steve again, his eyes wide and shining and impossibly deep, his lips slightly parted, his fingers curling apprehensively around Steve’s hand…
And he remembers…
And then, in a small voice, he answered,
It was more impulse than intention - just an abundance of energy and an urge to be close to him and the instinct to share this incredible burst of joy.
Tony got to announce that they were done. He stood back swiftly and turned away, only thinking of giving Bucky space-

be able to help, all the positive changes he could be a part of - the Bucky, and the Tony, that he could make happy.
And the basic instinct to fix that was more real and more urgent than any of the many catastrophes playing out all around him. When Tony stepped forward and put a hand to Steve’s shoulder, he

Steve watched Tony’s mild suspicion of an unexpected visitor sharpen into a focused curiosity, as he recognised something about Steve’s face… and the almost imperceptible furrow of his brow as it occurred to him… Steve could see him thinking it,
But then he saw Steve’s features harden. He felt the cold beat of silence in the air.

“Who’re you?” One of the guards demanded – which told Tony that they weren’t the type to shoot first and ask questions later. Either they were scared to do something so drastic, or felt a simple human reluctance to take a life…
And at no point had it led anywhere near the subject of this being the start of something, or a permanent relationship, or this being exclusive…
– and yet his mind had felt so clear, so calm…. So, in control. Like being awake inside of a dream.
Whether or not he realised this at the time, Tony had been waiting all his life for someone who made him feel like this. Someone who made him feel safe enough to be soft. Someone who gave him the confidence to be as kind as he’d always wanted to be. Someone who wouldn’t belittle and dismiss his every gesture, or use it against him.
“Don’t,” Steve warned weakly, as his shoulders started to shake.
Something about that felt very telling.
And then he felt the soft, wet heat of Steve’s mouth-
right now.
Well, whatever it was that’d stopped him telling Tony all this, Steve was sorry for it. That much he was sure of. He knew that he wished he’d said it all sooner, that Tony had never felt unloved or unwanted – that they hadn’t wasted so much time.
…Oh, Steve very much liked that idea-
those thoughts yet. But they were there.
And then Tony tried to take a step forward - and disappeared completely.
And, under all that panic, it was actually pretty clear-
But it turned out that, tonight, Steve needed

And then, when Steve had buried himself completely inside him, the head of his cock pushed up against Tony’s prostate and his hands caressing into Tony’s hips, his voice dropped into something darker and more possessive as he growled,

“Hey,” Tony smiled – and took a step closer. Steve looked up in time to see Tony glance down at the carry case, his arm lifting almost hesitantly towards it. Steve took a sharp breath, and willed his hand not to shake as he held it up for Tony to take.
He knew that Tony liked being held like this, that he liked being kissed like this, that he would
“...Let’s go for a walk on the beach,” Tony suggested, shooting an accusatory glare at the inside of the house. “I’ve… got an idea that I want to talk to you about.”
like the answer to Tony’s question…
As of yesterday, Steve had been so sure that Tony had come to like him as a friend. And he’d
“I don’t think so,” Steve exhaled. “I mean… That’s kind of what I did last time. Just - get Bucky first, ask questions later. That was the most important thing, so… It ended up with us basically throwing a grenade into SHIELD, just… take it down, worry about the rest afterwards… And then afterwards hit us like a truck. And I don’t think I ever stopped wishing we had done just a bit more to prepare for it, to set ourselves up for it. I lost count of how many times I found myself thinking ‘we wouldn’t be in this mess, if only we’d…’” He shrugged, unable to think of a specific example. Tony squeezed his hand again, like he understood. “And, I mean, we were lucky that Wakanda were prepared to help him. A… unique set of circumstances, led to that. I don’t know if they’ll make the same offer again - but if they hadn’t the first time, I’d have done all that to save Bucky without being able to save him at all. God knows what would have happened to him - and then he ended up being turned to dust anyway, and then…” He trailed off, suddenly exhausted with the whole thing.
This wasn’t just Tony leaving him – this was Tony taking everything that Steve had

So, Steve let himself sit back into the couch, and rubbed his eyes, and let them stay closed for half a minute. When he started scanning the room again it was more casually…leaving some of his attention free to consider other things, while he looked for Maribelle…

And then there was a red haired woman, standing right next to them with a tray of champagne glasses.
“Aw, well, I’m pleased for you both… And, kind of scared for you both…” He pulled off a mock-concerned expression, to take the edge off the sweetness. Tony did his best to frown at him.
“I love you, I will never leave you, it’s always been you, it’s only you, always-”
Tony thought about kissing him.
That he might be able to picture it…
He might’ve vaguely been aware of Tony pulling away

like I should apologise to you, right now.”
There was a plunging dip, right to the bottom of his gut, as Steve pulled him up off of his feet and hard against his chest. A swell of giddiness bloomed up through Tony’s head, a little yelp of surprise getting swallowed up by a desperate gulp for air. Automatically, Tony wrapped his legs around Steve’s waist, falling further into the thrill of weightlessness. And then, even though his lungs were still frantically working to catch up, Tony grabbed at Steve’s hair and tried to pull him into another kiss-
Still going

Tony frowned, and pushed the idea away. There were far too many thoughts competing for his attention at the moment, without letting himself get carried away with silly notions like that.
And he remembered how much he usually worried about talking to Steve, how important it was.
But, for a moment, Tony simply considered him with a sort of blank interest - an expression Steve just couldn’t read.

His surroundings seemed to fade into the background, his previous thoughts just dissolving into this white noise of panic.

“Jesus, look at you,” Tony breathed, running a firm palm over Steve’s shoulder, and then over his neck, tilting Steve’s head to meet him as he leant down and kissed him again-
No - it was worse this time.
“I’ll let you familiarise yourself with the details,” he said, as though he’d decided to be gracious about Steve’s bad mood. “Agent Hill will be here in thirty minutes with transport.”
And then Tony reappeared, expertly holding two glasses in each hand.
