“Hi honey,” Tony spoke up before Steve could respond, “I need you to crack some code here. Any help about where Kang’s Cube?”
On Sunday he decided to drive down to the Compound, wanting to touch base and meet Nat. They both kept busy in different ways but the last time he had been down there, Rhodey had been present too and had pulled him aside to quietly talk about Clint. It wasn’t surprising to Steve that Nat wasn’t giving up on him, and it hurt somewhere hard whenever he read the reports of yet another work of
Tony opened the hatch of the jet and activated the Monkey-Grab protocol that he had specifically designed for Clint and Steve.
“I’m glad, Steve,” she said it like she meant it, “Listen, I was hoping to sort some things out at the Brooklyn centre. Are you working tomorrow? I’d like to meet, if possible.”
“They’ll need a lot of time,” Steve wiped a thumb across his lips, gathering the sauce before licking it, “And a good deal of coordination.”
He knew that Tony would help him get her back. He didn’t know what it would take to make Tony see that Steve would like more than just her back.
? Steve’s eyes would linger on Tony’s arms in a particularly flattering suit and he wouldn’t hide it when Tony would notice. Tony would smirk with appreciation when Steve pulled out some specifically brilliant theory that the SHIELD scientists hadn’t considered for a case.
Thanos had won because of them. He had won because of their divisions and suspicions, their lies and lost ties.
"I love you," he whispered, a confession in the dark and Steve wondered why Tony couldn't hear his breath freezing in ice-touched lungs. "I love you, I'm sorry," the words were freeing and Steve would look Tony in the eye tomorrow again as a liar, safe from the consequences of this moment but he had to say it again, "I can't - I love you, Tony,
“I’m trying to save myself too,” Steve said with an attempt at a smile and Tony didn’t say anything, looking at him with an analyzing stare before he broke the gaze, letting Steve get back to his dishes.
They didn’t talk about the first time around, the first funeral when Tony had stood in place of Natasha. There was no space to mourn a past when the present had been shaken.
“You’re certified crazy, Steve Rogers,” Tony declared but his voice had the edge of excitement usually reserved for rare successes, “But my kind of crazy, so we’re good.”
“Okay,” Bucky agreed without pushing it further but Steve could read him better than anyone and he knew that his friend was simply letting him off the hook, “Banner said that you’ve volunteered to return the stones once they’re ready?”
"I saw the flowers," Steve commented as they ducked out the gate fairly easily, "He seemed excited."
"In plain sight," he realized, nodding in the direction of SHIELD agents entering the oddly situated building and waited as Tony slyly scanned for heat signatures. Tony stuffed his hands in his pockets and shot Steve a quick glance in confirmation of their target.
“I know it sounds like horse- unbelievable,” Tony rested his elbows on his knees and held Howard’s eyes, “But it’s the truth. It wouldn’t have been safe to reveal anything before but now –”
“We broke the fucking world,” Tony swore against his shoulder and Steve shut his eyes, swallowing hard as he did the only thing he hadn’t been good at doing in the past. He held on.
“We’ve been here six years,” Tony placed the half finished glass of water on the table before deciding to drink it completely, “Did you really think I wouldn’t find it?”
“I thought we caught them all?” Steve sighed as Tony ignored the question in favour of letting Chopin fill the silence, fingers speeding up to the fascination of the kittens.
Steve didn’t answer but there were some moments that didn’t need an agreement and they stood there in silence till Hope came with the car.
“Making the bunker go boom wasn’t enough excitement?” Steve asked as he came to stand behind Tony’s seat, resting his hands on the chair as Tony lightly tilted his head back causing his hair to press lightly against Steve’s suit. He let his fingers brush the dark strands and smiled to himself at Tony’s unimpressed snort. They hadn’t got to their scheduled date in the five times they had tried, some emergency always popping up to derail the plans before they could avoid interruptions. Tony had tried to needle Steve’s reason for consistent secrecy over this particular date but it had only led to frustration for the man when Steve managed to dodge answering. The ring in his suit’s pouch had begun to burn a hole but Steve had wanted to do this the right way. A proposal shouldn’t be hurried or half-assed, he’d thought.
“Howard threw his baby at me,” Steve said, looking at the door to check if there was any threat before glancing down at the little girl who was now staring at Tony, “You find that interesting? You understand what he’s writing?”
The others were early too, all of them trickling into the kitchen one after the other, and Steve spent a moment of quiet looking over the scene. There was no training, no routine, nothing that could really prepare them for this mission and yet this was one time he felt his mind clear of doubt. They were desperate, yes, and running on a fantastical idea but they were also at their realest points of lives. All that they had to lose, they had lost and all that they aspired to win, they had lived without for years now. It was a morbid balance of acceptance and denial, and it was strangely liberating to let that be their strength.
When they finally reached the room, working with Potts’ information of the fortress he had once seen before, Steve did a quick lookout before letting them in and hoping that they didn’t have to fight an intruder anytime soon.
Steve felt Thor at his side but there was nothing spoken, no word shared as he followed Rhodey silently, a broken march of a Pyrrhic victory.
“Times like this makes you wonder how easy it is to infiltrate a high security base,” Tony turned around and then turned back to stare at the license plate of the car, “Thankfully, we’re already in the end times. Come on, I think college is finally going to pay off.”
“Hello to you too, Shellhead,” Steve looked up at the peeved noise and raised a brow at the frown directed down at him. There was an angry mark of too tight goggles across Tony’s temple but his frown wasn’t really angry. In the past five days since Tony had come to the facility, it was easy to read his moods. There was always a dark echo to his tone when they discussed Thanos and Titan, a thrum of vibrating excitement that came with less hesitation with every discussion they had about Morgan, dry judgemental glares when Steve ended up hijacking his call with Pepper that was always Pepper’s fault but nobody really minded. There was an awkward tension between Clint and Tony for the first day that Natasha had dragged the weary archer back home, and Steve hadn’t known how to approach it. But it had broken the next day, Tony being softer with him as he seemed to accept Clint’s change better than most of them could.
Steve looked around to search for Tony, wanting to share this victory him and his eyes landed on Rhodey crouching over –
“Nat,” he started when he opened it to see the thread and needle, “I – uh – I think there might be something – you know what, thanks.”
"Why will it work with me?" Steve asked even as he glanced down at the lemon-sized device, looking up at Stephen when the man cleared his throat.
But then the table ended, Tony slipping off. Steve hadn't decided to move but his feet snapped to action and his hands were outstretched, bent to cup Tony's form when he rolled onto Steve's arm. His legs were still on the table's edge, hips half dangling off the table and chin pressed into Steve's chest. Steve bent lower to get a better hold under Tony's knees but it only served to make the shorter man rest his head completely against Steve's armpit.
"Well, it's good that he didn't reverse the serum then, isn't it?" he kept his eyes away and kept moving, trying to adjust his vision to the flickering bursts of light that he knew was energy waves, "Wouldn't want two civilians on the job."
"I need to get back home in a minute," Potts countered but took the chair when Tony wheeled it to him, shooting a dry look in their direction as he sat, "Okay, fine, we'll work it out then. You two get to work on getting the cube back and I'll get cracking on this guy's time codes."
The phone chimed two hours later, as he was biting into his lunch at a diner that had more bite to its mustard than Steve had tasted before. He finished his food slowly, ignoring the message till he was done, and wiped his hands on tissues that stuck to his fingers.
"What does a second chance feel like?" he asked and his words would choke him one day, too many stuck to his throat and the roof of his tongue tasting like regrets, like wishes. "Can we get more than one second chance?" he wondered even though it felt like a plea, a request to someone who couldn't grant it. Wouldn't? Maybe shouldn't.
Tony rammed the controls to full speed and tore through the bridge with the confidence of someone who had nothing left to lose.
LIBERTY wasn't P.E.P.P.E.R but she was suitable for Steve and he'd become attached to her in the time he had used her help. It had been a birthday present from his husband during their first year of marriage and Steve knew that it was yet another thing that had become a strained memory now that he had distanced himself.
Beside him Bruce made a questioning noise, something in the distance was clattering to the floor, the entire world was moving and loud but Steve felt time stop as his eyes stuck to the empty spot beside Clint. He was standing alone. He shouldn’t have been standing there with a missing shadow on his left.
"He's after me because I'm the starting point of the mess he wants to fix and my team didn't let him get to my husband," Potts nodded, getting off the seat and stretching his legs, "And I'm here because my calculations hint that this will be his last stop, this is the divergence he'll come to correct."
Tony’s hand brushed Steve’s where it rested over Natasha’s middle and Steve sent him a small smile over their little guest’s head.  Tony’s eyes flickered down, and Steve saw him swallow, but then his hand rested more firmly atop Steve’s and that was enough. It was warmth cupped in found hands.
Tony had survived certain death before, Steve had seen it himself. He had touched a blacked out reactor and thought the end of him before Tony got back up. He had always come back.
And then Maria got a call that required her to leave, her voice soft as she tried to explain it to Natasha. The picnic ended with less fanfare than it had begun and Steve felt bad as Natasha’s face looked withdrawn when Jarvis ushered them to leave.
The elevator opened a floor below the penthouse, Natasha and Clint's floor before they had left, letting Tony out into the stillness of no visible threat.
“Already?” Steve blinked and Tony eyed him for a beat before looking at the entrance of the bathroom.
“Against a tree? Nope. Sadly it still stands victorious,” Tony raised a brow when Steve attempted to get up and didn’t move a muscle as he failed, “Yeah, being old and human sucks, huh?”
And Steve wouldn't cross over because he was a goddamned tree, rooted firmly at his own side, beautiful but unreachable.
"I wanted to get tested," Steve commented and Tony shifted his head, brushing his lips over Steve's heart without intent, "For bugs. Or a virus."
The community hall was closer than his footsteps had intended it to be and Steve slowed down as he neared it.
They fell into an unpredicted measure after that, one step still as Steve and Tony but the other ready to step into the
When he finally reached the base, Steve parked his bike in his old spot and took the basement elevator. It was quiet when he reached the ground floor, doors opening to the corridor closest to the briefing room. He was walking up to it when he heard the sound and recognized Carol’s voice before Rocket’s voice echoed a reply.
"Tony?" Steve's whisper came through in his ear and Tony spared a second to reprimand himself before starting the engine.
“What happened to being a pacifist?” Tony yelled as he ducked the lasers and used a halved table as shield before throwing one of the knives he had picked up from the buffet, “Who are these bots pacifying, Hank?”
Steve felt his blood run cold for a moment before it began beating with a forgotten adrenaline, muscles tightening as he stood up in a suspended moment of time.
“He came by about two weeks after Tony returned from space,” she made a face but shrugged, “I don’t know why he thought it was a good idea but I guess he was looking for someone to unload on and it was easy to put it on the person who wasn’t here. Anyway, he came down to meet Tony and for about ten minutes things were civil.”
“And here I thought you knew I looked good in everything, Jan,” Tony’s voice had a bit of rush, like he was running and Steve caught sight of him moving to the control room. He braced himself and threw the bot that charged at him, running as soon as his hands were free.
"Hi," he repeated and felt Steve's exhale, a soft expansion of undefeated lungs, lungs that had brought him to Tony from the ice.
“ – hey, wake up,” Steve jerked awake and the voice came clearer when his ears popped, “That’s it, come on, no time to lie around. That’s my man.”
“I thought you removed all the trackers?” Steve raised a brow but Tony tossed the phone at him without looking.
"I need to contact Natasha and the others too," Steve said and Tony turned his head to see his husband keeping an eye on Potts.
Steve clenched his hands on his hips and watched as Bruce tried one last time, Nat killing the power on command.
"Why aren't we divorced again?" Tony asked but Steve could read the annoyance in his tone and it strangely made him calm down further.
“How long has been sitting there?” he asked, eyeing the figure sitting with an eerie calm about him.
"That's a common sentiment," Tony pointed out, raising his hands in a surrender gesture when Potts shot him a look, "Hey, you screwed up my timeline too, I'm just saying."
“It seemed the only explanation,” Steve said awkwardly and Tony shook his head before shooting a fond grin.
"I know," he muttered into their space and let his fingers draw unspoken patterns over Steve's back, smiling down at the peering drowsy eyes. The ache to comfort faded into the golden drams of the sheet pulled over them, and he'd let this memory go unframed too as long as it remained in his unforgetting mind.
“Why the long face?” Tony asked and Steve shook his head as the door clicked open, “Let me guess, he turned into a baby.”
"Friday, lower the temperature, please," he said quietly as he reached the bed and felt the room fill with a pleasant coolness. Half climbing the bed himself, Steve lowered the lax body in his arms onto the soft covers, freeing one arm to pull two pillows and tuck it under Tony's head. The duvet was brown,  shade Tony would never have chosen for his own room, but it felt warm and Steve coaxed it from under the man's legs to pull it over his torso. His eyes caught notice of the glasses jammed into Tony's collar and Steve shook his head as he removed it to place it on the bedside table. He was about to turn and get up when Tony rolled over, an arm wrapping around Steve's hips and a thigh. Steve looked down to see the man pull himself close to Steve's body with a grumble before pushing his face into Steve's waist with a sigh.
“Again, I’ll remind you of this,” Tony showed him the picture with amusement dancing in his eyes, “You also dyed your hair brown.”
"Not as bad as looking in the mirror?" the guy asked, straightening up with a raised brow at the gauntlet facing him, "I really don't think you want to kill yourself, Tony. And I don't have time to die right now, so how about we put the posturing off for later."
Steve looked over at Natasha and Bruce but neither of them budged an inch from their slumber, Nat now turning over onto her stomach thanks to the extra space. Making a decision, Steve rearranged Tony's askew limbs as best as he could before scooping him up, intending to put him on a bed in one of the nearest rooms. Sleeping in a chair wouldn't help his back and Tony never woke up well if he slept on a floor. Steve remembered that from the Tower all those years ago and swallowed the lump of memories threatening to spill over.
This time he opened his eyes to a blank slate of blue, a system shutdown in his mind and nobody staring down at him.
The urge to swear was a constant with every departure and arrival through the Quantum Realm but Steve focused on the ground beneath his feet when they finally landed. His eyes met Tony’s immediately before glancing over to check on the others.
“You’re leaving, aren’t you?” she asked, no build-up or guesswork thrown to ease in. They didn’t really need it maybe, bruises scabbed enough to numb new sores.
"Nope, I refuse this," Tony replied and Steve heard Potts sigh before his husband's voice came closer, "You cannot be doing this right now."
And then there was Carol, flying down to take the gauntlet from the kid. There was Mantis and Okoye and Hope, Gamora from Thanos’ time standing beside a Nebula she didn’t know. There was every female warrior gravitating together, looking down the sea of soldiers who would stop them from reaching the end.
“The other one grew on me,” Steve shrugged a shoulder and the crowds around them were the same, still not much bothered by the lives of strangers walking beside them.
"Yeah, but why was he?" Rhodey asked, leaning further over the table, catching Tony's eye with a cheeky smile, "Especially after he spent a whole six months before finally asking you out. Chivalry doesn't seem to be on for dessert."
“Did nobody tell you about hair dyes and mirrors?” he raised a brow, dropping his bag at the corner, “You look worse.”
“We should get you checked out when we get back,” Steve said with an overwhelmed exhale, smiling as he looked at Tony, “Bruce is going to really insist that you go to a hospital and I’m pretty sure Pepper will drag you there herself if you disagree – Tony?”
His normal grace was thrown out the window when Steve crawled into bed and Tony grunted as the man dragged himself higher to rest over Tony's chest, fully pushing Tony into the mattress.
“You’re sure about this?” Reed asked when Steve took his place in the base of the portal, the design different from when Tony had created it a lifetime ago.
“Is that Scott?” Steve heard Nat ask but his own mind was steadily growing horrified at the teenager who stood in the Ant-Man suit.
“I was,” Tony nodded, putting his cup down, “You were carrying me with you. Multiple me, actually, though that still freaks -”
Steve looked at the design and let himself think about it. SHIELD wasn’t always what he wanted but he hadn’t really considered another way to do what he was good at doing.
. Clint had years of training, was underrated as a combatant by those who hadn’t fought him personally, and was sharper than most. The first time Steve had met him, he had been a puppet against friends, doing things he hadn’t wanted to do.
“So you got me a gift,” Steve commented, eyeing the envelope when Tony nodded, “I didn’t get you a gift.”
Tony was sitting at his piano, courtesy of Maria’s enthusiasm when she had last heard him floor her guests into a frenzy. That was a nice sight, watching Tony play.
"I'm not sure Edmund will appreciate that as a review," he quipped and let his eyes catch the relaxation of Steve's shoulders, a soft fondness seeping through his core.
“We’ve already done the worst, Nat,” he said and the smooth kitchen counter looked welcoming for cracks but Steve couldn’t, he couldn’t transfer his own mess onto everything else, “The world doesn’t need the Avengers again.”
A fast couple of weeks later, Steve had no real plan of what to do next but he was accompanying Bernie and her tag-along to Detroit, where they planned to diverge. Bernie had offered the choice of joining them till East Lansing, where she had to go later, but had let it be when Steve had evaded it.
"You're leaving?" he asked without looking up from the files he was signing. The September Foundation was still a fledgeling and he insisted that he had to focus more energy towards it, even if Pepper was the official name on top. It probably was a matter of worry that his partner hadn't pursued the line or asked if they could adjust their schedules to make more time despite it.
"We've got an incoming signal from the deep-space scanners, and Reed says he's detecting another time portal," she quipped, an amused look falling onto her face, "Is the other Steve a ‘punch first' type too or can I get Stephen to make him some tea first?"
"Nothing," Maria didn't tap her fingers, didn't clench her jaw, didn't let the mess show. She was the last one standing in a room, the last pin to fall, and she was good at her job. She'd never had doubts about it.
"Have you ever had someone crowd you up against a wall, kiss you senseless, apologize immediately after and then run away saying that they need to throw up?"
"Reed, if it's you and you got caught, I'm going to be disappointed," Tony added, a hint of wariness in his tone but Steve felt relieved that they could speak.
“Don’t worry, you can handle Carter for me next week when she comes asking about the suit plans,” Tony waved a hand and gestured at the envelope, “Now open it.”
This Tony Stark, five years of change later, was a father before everything that could be tagged to him.
"Apparently she loves me 3000," Tony replied in a voice that went softer in remembered amusement, fondness ringing through his tone.
Scott didn’t really understand the silent and half-spoken conversation they were having but he raised the concern of making an additional trip with their limited supply of Pym Particles.
Steve looked around, the realization dawning on him with a slow trickle of warmth, watching Thanos’ army turn to dust everywhere. Thanos himself staggered, fumbling towards the seat they had first found him in, and everything about him screamed defeat.
“Should do, you mean. Right?” she asked and her voice was sharp, knowing, a lawyer’s deduction, but her eyes softened at Steve’s silence and she shrugged, “Look, I can tell you a lot about privilege and influence but something tells me you’re good at learning on your own. That’s good, that’s what everybody needs. We all gotta fight.”
"Date," Tony supplied with a growing ease in his chest as he watched the flush spread over Steve's face even as he tried to hide his quirked lips in the excuse of focusing on the bowl he was cleaning.
"I missed you," he repeated because they'd have moments for bigger words later. They would build them and many more, as many as they could want. For now, it was this. It was him and Steve and one more step.
"I can't leave," she laughed with no hint of humour and her nails scraped her hairline as she raked fingers through her hair. The blonde wasn’t her shade, not the colour of her mood or manner, and Steve wondered how long it would be before they all became unrecognizable.
"You want me to tell you that he doesn't hate you," Potts scooped another handful of mud into his bowl, eyeballing the measurement with easy precision as he shot Tony a quick glance before focusing on his task, "Actually, scratch that. You want me to tell you that he can love you despite hating you right now.
Throwing Mjölnir in Peter’s direction, Steve rushed to cover Clint’s six, one ear still open for the conversations falling through the comm. For an instant Peter yelled as he slipped from Mjölnir’s hold but Pepper was there, Pepper took over the rescue job with ease.
"He didn't forget you despite that," she laughed, and they could do this. They could watch their hidden words catch humour. "He carried that phone almost as long as he carried my damn ring, didn't he?"
“I do,” he agreed and raised his wrist to key in the date, matching it to Tony’s, before locking eyes with him and disappearing again. Whatever it took in the end, they would manage. Steve trusted that.
He saved the message to his usual drafts and stood in front of the hall, staring up at it for a second. Pulling out his other phone, the one that still welcomed calls and messages; he took a shot of the entrance and hesitated for a beat before sending it to Tony.
“He liked building things,” Steve replied and Bucky nodded, silent for a minute before he regarded Steve again.
“Tony?” he tried and kept his hand to himself, coming closer till he was at an angle to see him clearer, “What’s wrong?
Things went smoothly till the elevator opened, just as they had planned, and Steve had to keep his expression under control at the faces he recognized. There was some cosmic irony involved in this happening in an elevator again, but Steve couldn’t spend time on thinking about it and kept his body language calm as he entered.
The landing was shaky but Steve kept his breakfast down and looked around to catalogue the others. Scott, Bruce, Tony – they were fine. The noise of battle alerted him to his surroundings and Steve caught sight of the road ahead of them, littered with glass and debris, crushed metal that once resembled car parts. He took a second to catch his breath and then the Hulk made an appearance, ending the second immediately.
“I just want peace,” Steve saw Tony move towards the rear of the car and took a step forward, moving till he was nearer, closer to catch the words that still seemed like a dream, “I gotta tell you my priorities though, Steve. Get back what we lost? I hope so, absolutely.”
“Yeah,” Tony sounded amused for a second before continuing in a tone that highly suggested that he was going to say something completely unhelpful to the mission, “Mr. Rogers, I’d almost forgotten, that suit did nothing for your ass.”
“I’m not sure,” Tony staved off Steve’s frown with a look, “Really. The only thing I know is that I woke up in my dad’s lab in front of the Tesseract and had to get out once I realized that I wasn’t supposed to be there.”
"Maybe I could go do the job alone and -" Tony let the sentence peter out at Steve's dry look and crossed his arms in resignation, "- or not, that's fine too. You know, we could just have you run half-naked through the place and create a distraction. That would be a pretty good one."
He tilted his chin in a question when Tony’s eyes met his and nodded when the man confirmed that he had the Tesseract. He could wait, he knew that it was his first impulse, but the reality of what they had to get back to made him keep track of the time as Tony got through one more unexpected goodbye to his father.
Steve had a recurring dream among the nightmares that plagued his waking sleep ever since he had made home in the hospital. He was laughing, in the unasked dream, grinning and carefree in warm clothes of red. There was a mulberry tree beside him, black droplets of its fruit strewn on the ground, and nobody was picking them up. He didn't care, in that moment, he let them fall and was happy. And then someone would call for him, someone from above, a garbled voice with unintelligible words. He'd ignore it once, twice, and then look up, because he hadn't imagined someone calling for him from anywhere beyond his sight's reach. He'd look up and it was always the same.
With his posture more comfortable, Steve got to observe the room better and saw the balloons tied to a hook on the door, the bouquet of white calla lilies and spray roses arranged in a vase with the occasional snapdragon peeking through, and a large casket of something that he just
“Oh, I got a lot more than just them. I also got video footage of you trying to lecture a guy who was minutes away from throwing you,” Tony shook his head but his eyes looked faintly amused, “You know, just because I handled Wanda’s video of the park once does not mean that I’m always going to be handling embarrassing or incriminating footage.”
“Besides,” Tony shot him a wry grin, “I have to get this out of the garage before Morgan takes it sledding.”
“She’s fine,” Steve assured Maria when he caught sight of her looking around, the golf club still clutched in her hands, “She’s with –”
"Is everyone safe?" Steve asked as he made his way to stand beside Tony's seat, one hand on the chair, "We'll need medical attention, get the medbay ready. Doctor Potts is hurt."
Steve tried smiling but it felt like his face would crack, skin bleeding out anguish over the ease with which this woman, his friend, was wearing a new grief like a long expected friend.
Steve was resting a month later, sleeping in his room after a particularly long day, when he felt the dip on his bed and opened his eyes to see Tony sitting with a notepad in his hand.
“You alright?” Steve’s whisper was dangerously close to getting drowned out by the heartbeat thundering in Tony’s ears but he was hesitant to inch closer. They were pressed shoulders to waist, Steve taking Tony’s weight against the wall, deftly tucked away from the glittering crowd of guests still mingling in the dwindling party.
“Let us help,” he saw Pepper stare at him for a moment before looking over at Rhodey and finally she nodded.
Their destination was a domed hall with more grey to it than Tony would have ever allowed in any of the Tower's décor. Except for Hulk's calm section, but that was a unanimous decision to let be.
Steve opened his mouth before shutting it, a chill spreading through his veins as the surety in Tony’s voice sank in. He wasn’t joking. He was serious.
“You used to call me at more reasonable hours,” he pointed out even as his lips quirked, eyes falling on the clock before he sighed, “I have to leave in five minutes and I still can’t find my jacket.”
“I do,” he confirmed and knew that it was the right decision when Tony echoed that vow with the confidence only a long-awaited love could give.
"This is Steve Rogers," he called out, recognizing the audio link being active, "Commander Rogers from the Avengers."
“You make a fuss when I don’t,” Tony pointed out as he came to the bed and silently glared at Steve’s feet.
Steve remembered the pressure under his skin, an awareness prickling at his nape as he put the Power stone back.
Steve went to bed with the pot unused and still on the unlit stove, an emptiness clashing with a hesitant fullness that came from unloading everything. The thirty messages remained in his drafts but the nightmares remained out of the night too.
“We’re doing it then?” Tony turned completely, body open and vulnerable to Steve’s gaze and Steve held out a hand, catching Tony’s wrist to pull him in.
Tony didn’t say a word but his grin kept growing, engulfing his face with mirth that frankly, Steve thought, was disproportionate to his own annoyance.
“We’re getting a wedding cake when this is over, right?” Clint asked and shot Tony a thumbs-up when he got the confirmation.
"Right," Steve clutched the orb and took a step back, exhaling the tension coiling within him, "Alright, we'll work this out in teams then."
He leaned to switch the night lamp on and turned to see Tony better, noting that he was still in the clothes he had worn when he had left to meet Maria in the morning.
“He was a crazy bastard, but he kept his things in order,” Tony scratched at his forehead, his elbow resting on his thigh, “Everything had a method, everything its place. It drove me nuts sometimes but it made for a clean workspace and a lot of clear projects.”
Steve walked between Tony and Thor, watching Thanos for any clues of his plan. He wasn’t known for subtlety so this attack had been his equivalent of knocking on the front door. But, if he was the distraction, who was the courier? Who was chasing the gauntlet?
“Thank you, Tony,” he said when he finally could find his voice and it still was not much higher than a whispered confession. He saw Tony’s jaw work, Adam’s apple move in a swift swallow, before he moved to shut the boot.
“Always an Avenger,” he read the caption, typed over a band of black at the bottom of the picture and Steve sighed, eyes burning even as his smile won, “Dammit, Natasha.”
When Potts' people came for him half an hour later, they were greeted by the reunited co-leaders of a team with band-aids between them.
"Yes," Steve answered and Tony nodded, letting him turn back around, letting the kitchen fill up with comfortable silence. He wasn't sure if there were books on this, this moment where nothing was significant and nothing changed but everything mattered more than the last. Where there was no before and after but there was
Steve looked at him, a searching note in his gaze before his face softened and his arms relaxed at his side.
The phone rested under his palm, over his chest, and Steve closed his eyes to the steady sight of undead stars looking down at him.
Everybody else had taken care to nap when needed, even Clint despite his edge, but the three in front of Steve had been desperately determined. Bruce was nervous about the whole thing and he dealt with it by quadruple checking everything. Natasha was a menace when she dug her heels into a project, more so than Steve, and she was determined to keep working alongside Bruce. And then there was Tony, burning through the construction and restructuring of the portal needed for the time travel to work, not to mention the complete rework of all the suits. He was running high on adrenaline ultimately leading to crashing into a much needed sleep.
"You were the one who grabbed it," Steve reminded as he passed the set back to Tony with a sigh. The closet was fairly spacious but not enough for two grown men to strategize a heist operation while trying on stolen clothes. He considered their angle for a minute, Tony crouched against the other end and trying to pull Steve's pants up in vain. It was only a matter of time before one of them tripped or pushed the other and the heat really was making his back sweat.
“Oh wow,” he muttered as he looked at the time on his laptop and winced as the beeping continued, picking his phone up from beside him on the couch to turn the reminder off, “Alright, alright, I’m up.”
, he didn’t say but Bucky shot him a knowing look. They talked about Bucky’s plans for the future and Steve was pleasantly surprised to hear that he was willing to go through a legal route to clear his name.
“It’s our anniversary of a new life in an old town,” Tony insisted and shifted till he could face Steve better, “It’s a big deal. I like days of big deals, okay?”
She nodded, the dry look calming down into a small quirk of lips. She walked towards him and patted him on the arm, squeezing lightly, before stepping around him.
"There was no blowjob," he pointed out and slapped his friend's hand away when it came to meddle with his code, "It was just a dinner and a date. I
"Could you stop your mind-reading thing? My thoughts have intellectual rights," Tony dodged the hand that came to push him but grinned as he shook his head, "It's not - we went out for dinner last night."
"Okay," Tony accepted because he was sensing that there was something else going on too, "You want to tell me why you need to go on this suicidal mission alone then? Because we can both do it and get to the jet together, I know that, alright?"
"And you've never seen them before?" one of them asked the woman who looked sharp as she matched their pace.
“Not every battle is won at first go, Rogers,” Bernie pointed out but sighed as she tucked her hand in the dark jacket’s pocket, “Sometimes it takes longer than it should and that’s not right, I know. But we do our part and then – keep going, I guess.”
“What do you need?” the words were soft in the hard silence of the room but Pepper looked up, blinking through the tears finding their way down her face, “Pepper, what do you need right now?”
“I’m fine,” the older man rasped but Steve moved to grab his other arm as Tony took the right, “It’s just a graze, I’m fine, let’s move.”
Today they had saved a world at too high a price and his arms were thankful to share that grief with a friend.
Nat had tangles in her hair, a smear of peanut butter on her upper lip and a lifetime of tiredness in her eyes but she smiled softly and Steve shrugged.
They held the handshake beyond what would be ignored and Tony had to pull away first but Steve curled his hand closed to hold the warmth for a second more. Years ago Tony had put his torn out heart in Steve’s hand and there was nothing left. Today it felt like trust, the same warmth but nothing similar.
“Steve, please don’t tell me there are more time-travellers dropping in,” she looked at Steve exasperatedly before turning to Tony, “Who are you?”
"How could I not?" Steve shook his head honestly and laughed when Tony raised an eyebrow, "It was one of the first things I learnt about you. SHIELD made sure that your birthday video of 2010 was on top of your profile material when I got your file, you know."
He closed the message after making the image his wallpaper, a hint of hesitant hope, and opened the unknown number’s message. The words sped fast and Steve let out a tired chuckle by the end of it.
They came together in increments, the idea of a new team in a new time. There were days when Steve would turn back expecting Falcon’s wings or Clint’s arrows flying through the air. Tony didn’t choose red for his suit and the black and gold variant was done intentionally to try and have a new beginning. It took them bad days and quiet days, memories of the old merging with the new. It took them time and effort but Steve saw it coming together.
He also remembered every other time Tony had shared a fond look, despite this, despite having heard it all. And that – huh.
“Kang’s moving to the Tower soon,” Tony relayed, eyes darting from Potts’ abdomen to Steve, “He said he had something to prove.”
It took another day for Bucky to drive up to the home and Steve was on the phone with Rhodey when he saw his friend.
“Is Happy okay?” Steve asked, remembering that the man had been dusted for years. Pepper looked tired, throat working, but nodded.
Somewhere between getting out of the conference room and finding the first bedroom, Tony's right arm had curled over Steve's shoulder with a warm hand brushing over the nape. His other arm was squished between his body and Steve's middle, but he didn't seem perturbed in his sleep, eyes still closed and mouth relaxed against Steve's collar where he seemed poised to drool. Steve adjusted his hold when they reached the door and opened the handle with a hand quickly before pushing his way into the darkened room. It had been Vision's, he remembered, and the floorboard lit up along the edges as he walked over to the bed. Tony had argued with Vision about it, when they had all first moved in. Steve didn't have to close his eyes to see the memory clearly, both men discussing the need for a proper bed and furniture in the room. Vision had been blatant about his lack of need regarding sleep but Tony had been insistent.
“You’re right,” he said, swallowing the momentary nervousness as Tony hummed distractedly, “I did promise something special. I can’t do what I actually planned right now but we could do something better if you want?”
Even as he thought it, Steve knew that he was making excuses. Scott was here, living proof of something getting past Thanos’ plan, something that had worked without him calculating for it. And the idea of Tony not knowing what to do with this theory, or not having the power to make it come true was an abysmal one. If there was anybody who could do this, do it right and in the scale they needed, it would be Tony Stark.
It lasted a minute, just a moment of respite before the Titan was up with renewed anger. With Mjölnir swinging from one hand, Steve charged, alternating with Thor as they tried to bring him down and Tony was up too. It was getting stronger, getting closer when Thanos called for his troupes and an army fell from the sky for the second time since they had formed the Avengers.
Steve didn’t look up from his report but caught the shoes standing in front of him. He did a quick calculation of the time and sighed as he realized that he really should be sleeping.
He sighed again and typed out a message to Ms. Parker, thanking her for the information and opened a new message to Natasha. The two images in the chatlog stared up at him like a challenge, past and the future, and Steve replied with a question.
"I've had that complex for years now, you can handle it for an hour," he declared smoothly, the jet's sensors catching the location of Steve's incoming, "I've got eyes on you, coming in hot."
beat. There were stolen peas from a dinner plate and a carefully arranged distance between limbs on the couch. Brushed off crumbs from a beard were easier than too stiff handshakes after missions. There was an exuberant lingering hug after the serum was restored but a quietly shared goodbye long before the moon visited.
The kiss wasn't cold, wasn't a goodbye really, but maybe they had said their goodbyes a while ago. Steve's eyes were closed when his lips brushed Tony's, just a hint of warmth snatched away when he retreated before Tony could pursue it further.
“Wow,” Nat commented and Steve dragged his gaze to her from the photo, reading the wistfulness and hurt and tired hope warring over her face as she took the whole image in.
“I know that the Ancient lady made a reference, but you’re not Aladdin, Steve,” Tony swallowed another mouthful of coffee and pointed at himself with the cup, “And I certainly am not Jasmine.”
“Tasha will find a way to kill me if you don’t come back safe,” the younger man said, a slight smile on his face, “So don’t forget your way home, okay?”
“Do you have any communication with your team?” Steve asked, intruding on the conversation, and Potts turned to give him a tired shake of his head.
That night Natasha insisted on sleeping with both Steve and Tony, and they had dragged two mattresses to the living room after pushing the couch aside. There was a blanket the colour of a dark sky and Jan had gifted it to them the previous Christmas along with a set of blankets that had a celestial theme throughout it. The one Tony had brought with him that night had an intermesh of
He had nothing but himself and a broken shield with an army in front of him but Steve found the ground under his feet. His shield strap was loose and he pulled, gritting his teeth as it tightened on his arm.
“Tony,” Steve wanted to curl into himself, retreat, run till he wouldn’t have to face this because this was a test wasn’t it, was a rotten temptation, “I don’t know about this.”
Steve nodded and then froze when Tony leaned down to brush a soft kiss to his forehead before standing back straight.
“So,” she wiped her hands on the back pockets of her sweats and came forward, “you came to catch a break before leaving again or you need something specific?”
"Well, that won't do," Tony muttered with a pleased hum before dragging himself forward to cup Steve's face and pull him in. The blinds were open and the sun filtered in through the tinted windows, throwing golden shadows down Steve's face. There was warmth beneath Tony's palms and the softness of his husband's t-shirt as his grip shifted down to the shoulders.
“Four years ago,” Tony replied, no trace of hesitance or guilt on his face, “The night before Natasha’s second birthday.”
“Yeah, I had some time on my hands,” Tony quipped, eyes flicking towards the car and then towards Steve, “It’s not exactly Barton’s farm but it’s like - an upgraded version of it.”
He was at the end of his stretches when he caught Natasha deliver a perfect turning kick before turning on the ball of her foot, balance unfaltering and finishing it off with a sharp hook kick.
Steve looked up from the phone and stared at his bike standing a few feet ahead. There were always roads waiting to swallow him up, let him run. He could pick up the temptation, could move.
The sunlight falling over the woods behind them and the mud scuffed onto Bruce’s shoes made no indication that Thor had been right by the looks of it but –
“You honestly think this only affects you?” he asked, throwing a hand out behind him, “You think this whole madness will matter only to you?”
It took him a minute to swallow her memories back down. He didn't bother to address the echoing ache of another missed chance that he would have to return home after this. There were somethings that didn't have an ending, an off switch. They were only upgraded to more potent forms or versions of their intensity when least expected.
Steve bit his lip and swallowed any sound that might have threatened to spill out as Tony’s head listed to the side, just enough to look their way, to look at the team. His eyes were unfocused but Steve wanted to hold on, to cling to the minute when they met his own.
He could hear Peter’s voice and he was just a kid, he was just a damn kid and now he was watching something that would change him for life. Steve could hear him begging, trying to get Tony to react, but all he could think of was that there was too much grey. Tony was always in colour, wasn’t he, always reds and gold and whiskey brown. He was vivid, the light that soared beside a comet’s tail and still shone brighter. There was always a streak of crimson too bright on his canvas when Steve attempted to paint his team and it was always bold. In your face, demanding a vulnerability that you had locked away carefully, Tony was always meeting you head-on.
“Are you going to try saving Bucky this time?” Tony asked after a pause and Steve smiled at the lack of tension in the tone. It had surprised both of them when they had learnt to discuss Bucky without the burn of the worst wounds ripping open, his name not dragging up bad blood from a past that now looked oddly distant. They had both grown into spaces that hadn’t fit them earlier, finding ways to fit edges into aching hollows, and Bucky would remain both versions of their memories but he was also someone too human in their conversations now. Time didn’t heal wounds, not really, but it had given them the tools to build their own bandages.
“I was hoping you’d help me patch some things up,” he replied and saw her eye him for a moment before eyeing his wallet. She turned around without a word and walked out, leaving Steve standing alone. When she came back, Steve frowned a little at the box in her hand, catching it when she threw it lightly.
It was hard to get him to calm down at first but then he started talking about how he survived, his theory of time being different in the Quantum Realm, and Steve watched him throw points around without joining them. Fortunately for him, Steve had been on a team with similar thought processes before and it didn’t take long to click.
threw up after that," he answered and this time Tony shook his head on a chuckle, "But I'm guessing Steve wasn't drunk off his mind."
An hour of half-spoken sentences and mass-ordered take-out later, Steve met Tony’s eyes over the rec room’s sofa and it was easy to offer a grin as he stuffed the last pizza slice.
“If you’re checking for fractures that’s not how you do it,” he said and Steve felt his bubble burst but this time it wasn’t disappointment.
"We need to get that from him before he uses it to alter reality or reverse time," Potts continued, speaking over Strange without a look back, "But the only way we can do that is by getting to his place before he comes to collect us from ours."
“We leave in two hours,” Bucky shrugged, tensing a bit before sitting down on the settee, facing Steve with assessing eyes, “You don’t look so bad.”
“Nobody else died,” Steve commented, the pieces falling into place with slow dread in his mind, “Your choice came true but nobody else became the price.”
in a park and Sam recorded the whole thing on video. It took her five minutes of listening to the guy try to explain how it was a great American song before she got up, stared him down and tore him a new one about leaving people. When he persisted, she yelled ‘Leonard Cohen was a Canadian! And a Jewish one at that, so take your hat and shove it up your ass!’. I have to say, it was satisfying to watch him turn as red as his cap. Did you really not get any notification of the incident? We were still supposed to be in hiding and I’m sure the guy made a fuss about it somewhere. If you did hear about it and helped keep it quiet, thanks.”
"What am I doing?" he asked softly, to an empty room where nobody could hear him and the only one who needed to was somehow too far even as he was too close. Tony was warm, trusting and alive beneath his palm, a content abandonment of suspicion or fear in his sleep. He was holding on to Steve, not a desperate clutch to his fingers but rather a confident demand of space. Like it was his claim. Like it was meant for him and he knew it. Steve wondered if he would have this same calm with his eyes open, looking up at Steve.
Steve nodded and came to stand at the table’s end, at Tony’s foot. There was a trickle of blood drying down his ear and Steve had the strangest urge to wipe it. He looked back at Pepper and saw her staring at Tony’s hand.
"Why is he chasing you?" Reed frowned but Tony could sense the unease from his constant tapping of fingers against his knee.
“It’s an expected paradox. You pushed time through Lang instead of pushing Lang through time,” Tony explained in a rapid flow of words, “It’s dangerous. Somebody could have warned you.”
“Whatever it takes,” he promised and Tony’s eyes met his, a questioning brow raised before his lips quirked up in agreement.
Steve shook his head as he dug through his food, the silence falling back between them as they indulged in the mundane.
“By absorbing me into them,” Tony nodded at the horror that must have shown on Steve’s face, “Yeah, believe me, it was disorienting. My essence was split into the integral components that made up the stones and I was basically brought down to five parts that were safe in them. I couldn’t make sense of it till you landed in Morag.”
Steve turned away to look when they heard a rough cough and took a few steps in the direction of the older man who had a pained expression as he clutched his abdomen.
He could know Tony from day to week, every missed moment a clarity in motion, and the man in front of him was not the one he had come seeking. This was the man he had kissed before war had ravaged their peace.
"Shit, shit, shit," Tony swore as he swooped low, regretting the last moment when he had considered this plan because there was no way Potts would make it, there was no way he could land that jump from where he was leaning with a hand pressed against his gut.
Later that evening, after having indulged in the leftovers from the party for dinner, Steve was reading up on the last mission’s reports when Tony knocked on his bedroom door.
They were looking for a specific connection to the concept, he calculated and dragged the seat nearby to find a place on the second screen. With the new context colouring the entire message, he went about working with Potts to pull up any new information that could help them.
given. Rhodey had left him with a note to watch over Nat and his tone had implied that she needed it in a way she wouldn’t admit.
Nudging Tony's knee with his foot, Steve swiftly slid out of the pants himself as the other man got to his feet and grimaced lightly at the dust on his knees. The suit Tony had taken for himself fit him perfectly, not the way a bespoke tailored one would but well-enough to avoid double-glances on their way in. Steve glanced behind Tony over his shoulder and shuffled his feet in the same spot as he calculated the ticking time.
“No,” she answered immediately and Steve raised a brow at the tap as he set to cleaning the carrot, “Well, yes.”
He heard the lights click and the door closed but didn't turn to look at his husband as he came to bed.
They floated his arc reactor on the lake and Steve stood beside the family Tony had left behind, watching his heart flow away from them.
“I can hear you and I’m rethinking dinner plans,” Bernie called out from the car, “One plate for Ms. Rosenthal only. Mr. Alexander dines free air.”
“It was her birthday three days ago,” the words should have been empty, probably would have been a few years ago but Steve had more control now, “I think at some point I’m going to have to learn new birthdays, find new days to celebrate. But still – it was hers this week and I guess it’s not over in my head yet. I painted that scene from the park.”
“Doesn’t feel like I’ve done enough of that,” Steve admitted and she frowned, “There’s just so much we could do.”
“Why not?” Natasha demanded and it did shape into a demand in Steve’s ears even though they were sitting companionably on chairs set apart by the oak shaded sofa set that Wanda had once monopolized.
“First of all, it was five hours, and secondly I didn’t actually expect to run into bank robbers,” Steve pointed out but let out a sigh at the unimpressed look he got, “Did you get them?”
Apart was a part of their life recently. They woke up in different cities frequently, their messages were shorter with swallowed words, and neither could blame time entirely for any of it. Tony was smart, wicked smart in matters of probabilities and certainties, but for once he wished he wasn't. They had managed to save the world, save their team, save the law from being abused -
“Sorry,” Bruce offered a thumbs-up and Scott looked at Steve with hesitant optimism, “Okay, Scott, you’re going to go back a week and take a walk for five seconds before we pull you back. It’s going to be fine.”
doubted the consequence of it when they had wheeled in a shell of a man she had last seen soaring. It had been snowing down a carpet of trouble outside and there were agents cleaning up the aftermath of the battle, but Maria had felt doubt for the singular person who hadn't opened his eyes to see it all.
“You are,” Sam confirmed with a wide grin as he held out his hand for the spare helmet, dark hair sticking to his forehead, “But it’s okay. Bernie gave me her chocolate five miles ago.”
“He was more obsessed with needling Thor,” Steve reminded as he sneaked past the first responders swarming the entrance, “Are you in?”
There wasn’t any real reason to panic, the doctors had taken pains to reassure him that endlessly. Extremis had done its job again and Tony was healing, albeit at a slower pace than he usually did.
He started towards the jumbo bags but paused while passing the speed balls. He could change up a bit.
The flowers were placed at the door, four knotted bunches resting on the threshold, and Steve stepped back. He thought to turn around before decided one last thing and pulled up his phone, focusing the camera on the door. The crisp sound of the photo passed, freezing in clarity on his screen like the moment had passed and all that was left as evidence was this.
He remembered Thor once joking that if there would ever be a Midgardian wedding to rival an Asgardian one, it would be Tony Stark’s.
“Did you do your laundry?” Pepper shrugged with an easy smile at Steve’s look, “Just wear a shirt. That’s not the problem, Steve. The problem is that you’re a –“
“Rumlow,” he greeted and didn’t think about an explosion in mid-air, people dead because of a moment’s distraction, the beginning of an end.
It wasn't a long walk but it felt longer as both men tried to sort out their thoughts from their brief brush with personal histories.
"What?" he asked and Potts huffed out an incredulous chuckle but he was moving, walking over behind Steve to get to the mainframe of the sphere, his feet carrying a stability that had been absent since the mishap.
"You two need medical too," Sam told them when he came through and his eyes lingered on Steve's stance for a second before his face brightened with a knowing grin, "Or maybe you could deal with that later. Together. I'm gonna check on Reed."
Now watching him, Steve saw the grief manifest in affection and felt his lips quirk in a soft curve. Tony’s hands were quick, precise in a way that had handled circuits inside a miniature reactor, but his fingers were gentle in smoothing out any tangles.
Tony and Rocket worked on the time portal with an odd collaboration of ideas between the planning of the time heist. It was a simple plan in theory but there were details that wouldn’t pan out until they knew the way to go about it.
Later he would remember the brown sludge sloshing around in his glass, the scent of baked potatoes lingering when his hand caught around the elbow of a Henley. On another day he would think about red butterflies on Morgan’s pajamas and the pale blue bunny that lay on the settee, recollect the three turns of a silver ring with every skipped conversation point in a tense family lunch. There would be flashes of a white paper-mache mansion sitting on a kitchen mantle and a purple eye mask stuffed in the apron hanging on the fridge’s side.
“It never has, trust me,” Tony rolled his shoulders lightly and Steve could see the mask fall into place as they heard Howard, the showman coming to stage, “I fully approve of a tactical retreat if you see things going downhill, just saying.”
“This should get us the slightest chance but I’m hoping that should be enough,” Tony said to no one in particular, using his nail to pull out a microchip.
It was an advantage to have already lived through this moment and they had planned their infiltration around the disadvantages only Tony and Steve knew. Bruce left for Sullivan Street, impersonating an angrier Hulk, and Scott shrank down to ride on Tony’s shoulder as they made their way to the Tower.
He hadn’t expected Tony to reply, ready to try and figure it out himself, but a delayed pause later his phone chimed with a video link and three words :
“I almost missed this, man,” Clint confided in Thor and took another bite of his rice with a slow grin, looking much better than he had before the successful test he had gone on, “Almost.”
“Do you both want to get married now, sirs?” JARVIS asked and Steve looked at Tony as they stood in a flying jet with dirt of a victorious battle on their faces.
She had not watched Steve when his world came crashing down though. That had been the first thing she had thought off when the blood was cleaned off her hands.
"Captain America," a deep voice answered, layered with knowing amusement, "How nice of you to join us finally. I'm Kang, the Time Conqueror and I welcome you."
“But keep what I’ve found? I have to,” he continued and Steve nodded, tilting his head when Tony held out a hand, “And maybe try not dying, that would be good too.”
“You can do this, Scott,” Steve affirmed and Scott inhaled, shooting the same smile he had back at Leipzig.
“We’re working on that,” he promised and Tony considered him for a minute before nodding, something in Steve’s expression satisfying his doubt. There was a red suitcase and a navy duffel Tony had brought, and they walked into the facility together, both carrying a promise to fix what had been broken.
"This is what you get for not using my comms, you – I'm going to strangle you, I swear," Tony knew he was losing it but his adrenaline was a mess and he really needed his partner back right now, "Cap, say that again. Steve!"
Steve managed to get a hold of the nearest bot’s head and reached in between its neck to pull at the wires.
"Sorry, wrong guesses," Tony called out as he made his way into the room, arm pointed outwards as he turned to face the intruder, "Just plain old me."
“Do you trust me?” Tony asked, every word sharp around his tongue and Steve caught the panic, the desperate nerves mixing with fierce determination. This was Tony at his most basic form, the core of all the upgrades that happened with time. This was the man who had jumped after a god of thunder the first time Steve had met him. And this was the man he had chosen to save the world with.
“Yeah,” he exhaled and shot a pained smile at Sam before looking over his shoulder, “I should go see Pepper. You okay?”
“He’s with Morgan at my parents’ place,” she had one hand resting on the table and Steve didn’t want to see it, didn’t want to see the final evidence but he moved further, “I dropped her off with them before Stephen brought us all to the battle.”
“Got it in one,” he exhaled and continued, shoulders stiff, “It’s the one thing that separates a death from murder. And that’s what the Snap does – murder. It’s not the toughest thing for the stones to grant but it does involve a choice, so it requires you to make another choice of your own. A weight to balance the action you’re asking of them. One finality to match another.”
They were fine, friends and lost in a shared misery, but fine was teetering on the edge of a chasm with every passing day.
With Tony, Steve was lost. Had probably always been or maybe had chosen to be, just so he could avoid the rushing realizations that would come with clarity.
Both Jan and Tony maintained that it was only Steve’s unnaturally good looks that brought out this awed crush. Steve was filing that under things he didn’t ever need to take seriously.
“Should I be worried about how you seem to know whose car this is?” Steve leaned against the door and the handle twisted easily with his force, moving back to let Tony crawl in to dig around in the dash.
“Yes, but Tony had it,” she answered, voice quiet before she looked up at Steve, “Thank you, Steve.”
Tony looked at the floor and around their feet before zeroing in on something that made him smile slowly.
“First food,” Tony agreed and Steve gestured for him to move ahead, watching his back as they made their way out.
"It's 11 a.m," Steve thumbed at Tony's goatee with an amused grin, "I've not seen you sleep this much in weeks."
“I thought we’d follow the order this time,” Tony suggested and Steve nodded like it made sense, because maybe it did. Maybe all the insanity they had lived through had some sense to it that was finally unfurling into this moment.
"Do I need to?" Tony asked, sensing Strange turning towards them completely from his half-done whispered conversation with Reed.
His toe brushed the door’s frame before the gym opened to him and his eyes found the source of the sounds even as his ears tried to shut-out the missing voices.
Steve raised his hands in surrender and walked to take a seat opposite her, tossing his keys on the table.
He brought up his free hand and softly ran it over Tony's hair, fingertips brushing down the edges of his sideburns and stopped it over his cheekbone, just shy of the laugh lines that had smoothed out in his sleep.
“No,” he admitted, a wry smile on his face as he met Steve’s eyes, “I lived through it all already. I wasn’t exactly functioning well, or maybe not the way I would have some other time, but I still have seven decades of memories. Good, bad, it was still my life. You didn’t get that though, did you?”
Stretching up from the couch, he blinked spots out of his eyes and walked towards the kitchen, phone still in hand. He’d spent the past six months trying to find interest in cooking as an attempt to really move on. If he could feed himself without killing his stomach or tastebuds, he could rate one step higher in a general functional rating.
Some people spoke to mirrors with an imagination of a future’s dream. Steve spoke to a figment of the past with ease that came a little too late.
“Why?” Steve asked but took the envelope when Tony began waving it. It was a bright red rectangle, the kind that came with greeting cards, and there was a single word written on it in gold ink –
"Your childish goading doesn't affect me, Steve Rogers," Kang scoffed, pointing his gauntleted hand in Steve's direction, "But I will keep you here to allow you to see what your true punishment is. Kang will bring back balance to the timestream and you will be witness to it from my hold."
"Hi, Tony," Steve replied and Tony could hear the nervousness hidden underneath the calm, something he wouldn't have noted if he hadn't known Steve. He did though. He knew Steve and he could read the way his shoulders held a knot of tension between them.
“Right,” Steve leaned away from the wall and dragged a hand over his face, taking a breath before looking at Tony, “Let’s go.”
The wind played darts with his face and he heard the honk from the honey brown truck matching his pace. He could probably pull ahead again and ignore it for a few more minutes.
Steve was jumping, hands open and ready even as he dodged the damaged bots stumbling into him. He got under comfortably and took the weight of his new arrival.
To Nat though, he was still Clint, and somewhere deep in him Steve understood that, memories of Bucky buried in Winter Soldier’s eyes still fresh in his mind. Steve knew what he would have given to try. What he
He had spent the past forty minutes herding three spies of hell into their bed area and had walked back into the living room of their new apartment when his eyes caught the sight at the corner of the room.
Thor fell. Tony got pushed down. Steve tried to bring Mjölnir down on Thanos and was ripped away from it, thrown away.
“But they’re more than that. They have agency of their own in a strange way. Probably why the Soul stone works like that,” Tony shook his head, bringing his thoughts back to the present, “Anyway, when I snapped their powers open, it wasn’t just a generic idea of death. It had to be calculated, specific. And while the energy generated from that affected my body, the powers weren’t directed at killing
Steve stared down at Tony, one hand holding the files he had brought with him and the other slack against his side, hearing his own heartbeat echo in his ears. He eyed the man in front of him, the one who death had swallowed to spit back into a time where his existence had stopped altogether.
The group met at a community hall that had been left unused for the past five years. It wasn’t far from his apartment, a ten minute walk that usually helped him get into a calmer mood. He remembered the times when he would reach the place twenty minutes earlier and work himself up to the point of brittle tension by the time everybody had gathered. It had been four years ago, the earliest period of this, and it stung less now but he could still remember it.
Steve let Tony take the lead this time and the last thing Tony saw was him closing his eyes with a soft smile, trusting and welcoming. In the quiet of their space, with a new day around them, they fell back into each other.
Comfort was alien to those who weren't meant to fall. It was blowing over a wound even though an antiseptic was more logical, stuffed animals hugs feeding touch starved arms, quiet and shadowed and an exhale worthy of relief. Iron Man could bounce energy blasts off Captain America's shield, could lift him up from a live minefield, and serve as a special carrier for a fellow Avenger. He had done those and beyond.
Steve could only nod and accept the hug she pulled him into, two victors sharing a loss' ache together. Tomorrow she would have Morgan and Rhodey, a whole world still standing strong with memory of five years that they had lived. Tomorrow Steve would travel the stars to return a stolen destiny alone.
He hit send and took a minute to search for the panic of long-practiced mistakes but the night was finally calm, and he had one more thought to send.
Natasha bit back the words, choking down the name she wouldn’t utter since they had first got news and the pressure scraped down Steve’s skin.
“Let’s do this,” he muttered to himself, pocketing his phone again and walking in, ready to try one more support group session. He could worry about everything else later.
Tony’s fingers were flying across the keyboards when Steve managed to reach the place and he didn’t pause even as he noted the new entry.
“Yeah, I – I have company,” there was background noise of other people and Steve thought he heard someone familiar, “It’s – one minute.”
“Did you ever think that there would come a day,” Tony’s voice came through the comm and Steve ducked out of a cop’s sight, “when you’d actually be glad that Loki had a slightly creepy obsession with you?”
Peggy walked in and shut the gate behind her before she noted her uninvited guests, looking between them for a minute before sighing.
It was a close call at a point but they managed to get out and the signal interference broke away once they gathered some distance. It didn't take long for Tony to put a distress call through to the Tower and Rhodey answered almost immediately.
“You bought flowers?” he asked and accepted the pills when Tony passed them from the tray on the seat beside him, popping them and drinking the water handed over to him, “Thanks”
She opened her mouth to answer when an alert of a message sounded and they both turned to see the screen open to a cam footage.
“I’m shocked,” Natasha said smoothly and Steve got to his feet, taking a few steps towards the kitchen to try and make sense of the chaos beneath his skin.
It was startling to see Tony again, even in just a projection, and Steve curled his hands in his pockets as he stood behind Pepper staring as the video progressed. Morgan was huddled next to her mother and Steve followed Tony’s form as he crouched down in front of his daughter for one last goodbye. It was fitting that even Tony’s goodbye was a declaration of hope, of love, just as his entire life had been for those he had chosen to care about.
“All I get is sass but,” Tony reached into his hoodie’s pocket and brought out an envelope, “I got you a gift.”
When Tony first created a new boundary, one far more closer than they had known before, they were at Gabe’s barbeque and Steve was handling the one dish he had always prided on being good at.
But they had both seen more generations than anyone should have and there were more memories of death, real and unchanged, than this scare that was being treated.
When he stood back up straight, he turned to get a towel and was thankful that Tony didn’t do it for him. It wasn’t embarrassing, not between them after all the low points they had seen in and with each other, but it was reassuring to be able to do this by himself. He couldn’t lie on the ground for long enough. There was always a start to getting back up and if it was with a towel, then that was okay.
"He'll find a way to Jane Foster and her knowledge of the Aether," Steve took a breath and his eyes cut over to Tony, an unspoken understanding passing between them as they took in the implications, "He's going to rewrite history. His codes must be linked to this."
But sometimes lying kept you alive and Steve had lived, as his support group would testify. He was there. Present. Moving.
Natasha didn't sometimes, he thought. She had lived around liars and grown over their reaches for a lifetime, so there were times when her eyes would look through Steve's words. She would see him and Steve would think that it would be it, the moment when he could be pulled down. But she wouldn't. She was raised to be a liar too, even if one too kind, and she had learned to look past Steve's lies.
"- it won't be long till he finds a way to the Tesseract," Potts surmised but Steve took a step to Tony's side and shook his head.
The ride was reassuring in a strange way. His neck felt cold and the wind stung his cheeks but the engine beneath him churned out steady power to eat up the miles, sending shocks of bumps when he hit potholes purposefully just because he could even as he noted to send a complaint about it later. It was an empty stretch of a quiet day and Steve climbed the bridge, looking over the Hudson as it remained a constant no matter how many times the world messed with itself. There was something about Nature that always showed self-assurance, a surety in its own existence even as it had just the moment, just the now to be the way it was. His eyes caught a dolphin flipping over a jump and Steve wouldn’t have lingered on such a sight before, too tied up in figuring out his place in the new world to let himself just take the world as it was  not new or old, but a changing constant. Now as he drove back to an old home, he heard the remnants of the song he had heard in Thor’s Spotify a long time ago.
