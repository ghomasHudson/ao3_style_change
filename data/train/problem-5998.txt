"Love you too," whispered Steve.
"What happened?"
The sheets tearing as Steve fiercely fisted them. Tony swung an arm around his waist to keep him from wildly bucking. The alpha’s free hand stroked the base of his cock. Steve arched off the mattress when he reached his climax.
Tony huffed.
“France,” said Steve. He’d always wanted to visit France in a non-professional setting. Steve would love a chance to see all the art, but they’d be nowhere near the famed museums of France.
“There’s a first time for everything,” said Tony.
“Nightmare.” Tony stated. It wasn’t really a question anymore.
He took the box of crackers from the cabinet and a water bottle from the fridge. Steve went to the bathroom and settled on the floor. Tony watched him from the doorway.
“Tony, could you give me a moment?”
Tony laughed. Steve smiled softly, before getting off the table. He zipped his jeans. Steve groaned. His pants were damp and sticky. Tony handed him his shirt. He pulled it over his head.
“Do you think it will help?”
“Nat, why haven’t they put me to work?”
“You all right?” he asked.
"Found anything yet?"
“What?” asked Rune.
“Gentlemen,”
“It’s time to break the pattern.”
“He’s a military man very nice,” said Edith.
“I haven’t-
“No.” None that wouldn’t scare her. Winter couldn’t have her scared of him.
"Papa, you got it, stop," she whined, pushing away his hand.
“How was Natasha?” asked Tony.
“Well, I think that was meant for you,” said Bruce.
"Why not?" asked Tony.
“Sir, who should I send the fruit baskets to?” asked Jarvis.
“She won’t let it be. I don’t know why,” said Steve.
“But I still got you,” Piper said proudly.
“Is something wrong?” asked Steve.
“At least he’s sleeping.”
“A babysitter till fourteen why doesn’t that surprise me,” said Steve. He rubbed Watson’s tummy. “Why was his relationship with Howard so strained?”
"Alright."
*****
"Is that something you'd be interested in?"
“I’m just glad you’re okay,” said Tony.
“Please, don’t let something from the past that meant nothing destroy our future,” he begged.
“I didn’t come here to fight. Tell me what’s wrong,” he begged.
“What if he doesn’t wake up?”
"That's major surgery, Tony. A shoulder is one thing this is your heart."
child. You shouldn't be in a rush to grow up. In the end, you'll regret it," said Daddy.
While he cooked he kept glance at his phone. He wanted to hear the alpha's voice. Dogs 101 was on. Having something to take care of would be nice. Could he convince Tony into getting one?
“I’m going to shower,” said Steve.
“I believe so. They will find a way to make contact with us,” said Thor.
“You know I could easily get us a hotel room. Take you the sites. We have some time off coming. Your heat is over so it will be safe for you,” said Tony.
“But-
“Be more specific.”
“Where’s Pipes?” asked Tony.
Steve tensed. A doctor was the last person he'd ever want to talk about his heat with. He took a breath. Edith was an omega. She was safe. Edith waited until he relaxed, before speaking.
He didn’t respond.
“The medal of honor,” said Steve.
Tony worked on breakfast.
“Hey, Steve how’d it go?” he asked.
Natasha frequently visited unannounced, seeming to find comfort in their company. Steve enjoyed it. Natasha's visits meant a chance to spar. It kept his skills sharp. She joined them on the couch, snatching the remote.
“I’ve calculated Captain Rogers's necessary calorie intake. For him, maintain his current weight, he needs to ingest 14,404 calories a day. Even more so when goes to heat,” said Jarvis.
. In the same hushed voice, he started reading.
*****
Steve took a breath. “I was taken back to the war. Among the mud and gunfire were you and Piper on the battlefield...You were so cold. It felt so real."
“I’ll call you,” he said.
Tony smiled as Steve went lax. He’d worried that Steve might not have one. Normally, it was a certain place on the neck, but it could also be in other places. Pepper’s spot was between her fourth and fifth ribs. Steve’s was just below his belly button. The moment was ruined when Pepper came walking in. Steve’s purrs transformed into a snarl.
“I’m sorry you heard that.” He was sure there was a point where he felt the same about when his parents fought. But he learned to block it out until became normal. Howard and Mom always seemed stronger after no matter how long it took them to make up. Mom won 90% of those fights and Howard always came crawling back.
Fury took a breath.“Howard and his wife died in a car accident."
Bruce quietly closed the door, taking Piper up to the penthouse. He laid her in her crib. She was out in seconds. Bruce couldn't leave her. There was something wrong about leaving her alone. He settled in the rocking chair across from her, taking a book from his bag. There was something so peaceful to this.
“He?”
“What is my mission?”
“What’s the occasion?”
There will always be darkness in the world. Now they knew the name of one. One previously thought defeated. What was next? They were a foe worthy of Steve's aggression. One man couldn’t do it all, but Steve could make one hell of a dent in the organization.
"What's next for you and your world?"
“I’m not going to command you.”
"I've been on my feet all day. I'm not in the mood. Save it for the honeymoon."
"Thanks."
He took a breath. "Ironman I can control. If I ask him, he'll give it up, but this no. It's out of my hands, and I hate it."
Steve leaned into the gentle caress of her hand. Peggy may have aged but her eyes were the same.
This side of Piper was so limited. The skills that she gained while here were diminished in this state. Only muscle remained. Her combat skills were fully intact.
“Downton Abbey.”
She only cried. He picked her up taking her into the kitchen, taking a bottle from the fridge. While waiting for it to warm he hummed to her. He gave her the bottle as she reached for it
"Jarvis scan him now."
“I’ve been alone a lot, but I feel safe being alone here," said Rune, softly but clear.
"Can’t say I looked forward to my trip,” said Steve.
“It’s a rescue. Oh, he'll just love being rescued by two omegas,” he said. Steve yawned. His eyes were growing heavy.
"I am interrupting?" she asked.
“How will this work?” asked Tony.
"Are we still at ding dong? We're supposed to be on total security lockdown. Come on, I threatened a terrorist," said Tony. Some woman was waiting there. Jarvis was already running her through facial recognition. “Who is that?”
“What his shield made of?”
“Thanks." Tony took a sip. Steve seemed happy. “You’re in a good mood."
Tony stiffened, his life flashing before his eyes.
"How about we draw up the plans for our new car?" asked Tony. That got a smile out of her.
“Steve, you okay?”
“Of course,” said Jarvis.
“He should know,” said Helmut.
“No.”
Tony took a seat with his head in his hands. The last thing he wanted to do was argue with his mate. “I’m terrified.”
“Your collection is made of famous artists. I don’t know how my work would fit in,” said Steve.
“Fury is coming.”
“Mommy, you’re holding me too tight.”
He popped the bottle and took out two pills. “These are horse pills."
"Thank you," whispered Steve.
“And the watch?” asked Steve.
“Tony, do you want to cut the cord?” asked Edith.
Tony slowly woke up to see Steve was gone. There was a note on the table.
When they reached the penthouse, the smell stew hit them.
"And if you don't?"
*****
“Tony!”
Tony gave him an identical looked that asked, are we really doing this. Steve could let this go. She had to acknowledge what she did wrong, or she’d likely repeat the behavior.
His hands went to the omega hair, tilting his head back, deepening their kiss. He rocked his hips against Steve’s causing moan. Tony groped his mate’s rear causing him to gasp. The scent of their combined arousal flooded their senses. Tony broke the kiss. Those lust hazed blue eyes fluttered open. He slid his hand under Steve’s shorts. Slick leaked over his fingers.
Steve sat in bed. A nurse left a tray food on his table. He wasn’t hungry. The glass door opened. A woman dressed in pink flower scrubs came in. She wore pink flower earrings. A fellow omega. She smiled gently at him. Steve pushed the tray aside. He wasn’t in the mood for visitors. All he wanted was a few days, maybe a week to pull away, not deal with the emotional strain of keeping up appearance. Then he could handle being with humanity again.
*****
“I still have to come here to meet with my therapist,” said Steve.
“Sir, we’ll be here soon,” Jarvis reassured.
Steve focused somewhere else, not wanting to talk further on Bucky. It was too painful. Even if it were the good memories. But he couldn't help wonder what Bucky would think of the alpha. They'd probably get on each other's nerves. Bucky thought no one was good enough for him. He'd probably Tony was cocky. Steve could see Buck giving Tony his grudging approval.
"I already have, Sir. It's a 99.99% match."
“Steve, I promise this won’t hurt the baby."
“I’ll get you something to eat,” said Tony.
“Why are you here?” Piper turned back toward Lena.
"You won't." He took the alpha's hands in his. "You're here Tony. If you ever need to remind yourself of that call on our bond."
“The light switch is near the door," he said.
He dug his phone out from his nest, calling Tony.
“Dum, U!” cooed Piper.
"Who's that?" asked Rune.
This time Jarvis paused the film every time the couple got absorbed in each other. They were almost through the movie when Jarvis warned them of Happy's arrival. Tony sighed, pulling away from. The marks he'd left on the omega's neck were already fading.
"Sometimes the truth can come off as mean, but there was no ill intent behind it," said Lena, almost kindly.
Return fire sent Steve back. His foot slipped sending tumbling into the sky. He caught hold of a cord and pulled himself up. Below a container dove toward the ocean.
Steve tackled her, pinning her to the floor. He slammed her hand against the floor until she forced to let it go. He growled baring his teeth. Something skittered across the floor, out of her line of sight. Nat stayed calm waiting for Steve to come out of his agitated state.
“The power surrounding the cube is impenetrable,” said Thor.
“Tony needs Gary.”
Tony eased into the chair next to Steve.
“He was a good a man. I’m sorry he’s gone,” said Steve.
Pepper made Steve a sandwich. He stared blankly at the wall. She gently touched his shoulder.
“Visiting family,” said Tony.
“Is she back?” asked Piper.
“Normally, I would be completely transparent with a parent unless it was harmful to a child. But Piper and Rune are extraordinary cases. They are much aware than most children in their age range. I’ll tell you wants relevant, but they need to trust me, and that means keeping some things from you.”
“I love you,” said Helmut.
"Thank you, sweetie."
“I have to say, I prefer your original color,” he replied.
Pepper rolled her eyes. She wiped off the spit up the best she could from her shirt.
Piper shook her head. The simple action shattered her parents' hearts but they weren't upset with her. Whoever had taken her had twisted her mind against them. Steve quickly looked away, drying his tears. Piper wiggled in Hill’s hold till she huddled closer to Rune. Piper would have to be strong for Rune, to give him the best possible life she could. She soon found sleep.
“The truth doesn’t work?” asked Rune.
As Tony washed, Steve shaved. He sighed, enjoying being freshly shaven. Steve turned when Tony rose from the tub.
“And?”
“Anything else?” asked Tony.
“Any lead on who brought in?” asked Steve.
“You’re nice," said Steve.
“More for me then,” said Tony.
After a few seconds, Winter went limp.
“Never scare me like that again.”
He clung to the metal suit hiding his face in its neck. There was no scent of his mate, but it was enough to soothe his frazzled nerves.
“A form of Persian spoken in Afghanistan. The things you learned when you’re kidnapped,” said Tony.
*****
“I’m on the street people are going bang. They are painting the walls. Maya, you’re kidding yourself.”
“It’s not that I’m not flattered Fleur you’re a beautiful girl, but I’m a committed relationship,” said Steve.
*****
She screamed fighting his hold. He cringed, hating the sound, as she struggled against him. Why was it difficult restraining her? Suddenly she went limp, and for a moment he feared he killed her. Fear of killing. Fear was something he never associated with the act. Winter relaxed when he saw she was breathing.
“Yes.”
“Footsteps.”
“Tell us now!” demanded Stark.
Steve smile faded. The president looked toward him for. Steve’s jaw locked as Extremis shot up his spine gnawing at his nerves. His eyes closed. All he could do was wait.
"Why do not believe that?"
He nodded. Being poked and prodded was something he was used to. The sooner it was over with, the sooner he would be left alone.
Her mouth watered when she smelled Papa’s stew coming through the vents. She didn’t want to wake either them, so instead she recited all of Jupiter’s moons in her head.
"It's fine. I don't mind," said Steve.
“Broken Heart Syndrome,” said Tony.
“Close your eyes.”
“We’ll be going to their facility so they can observe you overnight,” said Natasha.
“It would say more than kinda.”
“Slightly dehydrated but otherwise fine. He likely fainted due to a severe anxiety attack. It was a lot for him to take in," she said.
“No, Tony."
“You have a talent for making me feel old,” said Steve.
“I don’t have much," said Steve.
“That’s a good way of putting it, but I wish I had more time to enjoy the first one,” said Steve. He didn’t want to linger on the thoughts of what he missed. Steve joined Peggy on the couch. A corgi jumped onto the cushion beside him. The dog pounced on his chest, bracing its short legs against him. It licked his cheek. Steve smiled happily, scratching the dog behind its ear. “Who's this?”
“We've been over this. It’s a nickname,” he said.
Steve slowly released his arm. He kissed the omega. Tony grabbed his toolbox, placing it by the bed, not wanting to ruin the small birthing nest Steve made.
“It’s a vintage set. Took me a couple of years to collect them all. Near mint condition,” he said.
“Don’t patronize me!”
“I have to go,” he said.
“Stay on my six and cover high,” said Rhodes.
“I guess … I am kinda amazing,” she said with a small smile.
"Does Hulk get them too?"
“I won’t lie about anything important. My nightmares are mine. I don’t want to tell you if I don’t have to. There’s nothing you can do to make me,” said Piper.
He found it hilarious, but they couldn’t allow her to get away with it. She huffed, meeting their gaze.
Natasha tickled Piper’s stomach causing her to giggle.
"I don't know," he said.
"This is beautiful. There wasn't anything like this in my time. The closest thing were the fish you could win on the Coney Island boardwalk. Bucky won me a goldfish. The only pet I ever had," said Steve.
Steve finally released his hold.
“We have a prisoner,” said Natasha.
“Run!”
“I’m sorry for his behavior. I have no excuse,” said Thor.
“Bucky, sometimes I found him drunk after a long night of partying,” said Steve.
“I’m sorry captain but I can’t go against my programming,” said Jarvis.
Piper woke up to Papa’s arm coiled protectively around her. She pushed out of his arms and found her way to Rune's room. Pushing the door open she got into bed with him. Light sleeper that he was, the slight motion caused him to awake.
“There we go just breathe,” said Tony. He was relieved when those panicking breaths quieted and steadied. “Steve, do you want a blanket?"
“No.” She had more than a few. But Sir did strike her as a person who enjoyed negative feedback.
“Jarvis, take us up,” said Steve.
“Memories,” said Steve.
“We did nothing wrong.”
“I’ll take you back after breakfast,” said Tony.
They stayed in each other’s arms for hours. Steve couldn’t sleep. He watched minutes pass by on the ornate antique clock in their room. Eventually, Tony’s arms went slack around him. He wished he could sleep, but worry wouldn’t let him.
Tony accepted the pill from him, swallowing it dry.
“Would you rather I play your normal selection?” asked Jarvis.
The reached the explosion site. It was light with candles. Flowers, wreaths, and crossed decorated the scene. The black vaporized shadows of those caught in the explosion marked the cinder block walls.
“Tony, I’m sorry I didn’t mean to-
“Threatening the safety of everyone on this ship isn’t funny. No offense,” said Steve.
“What?”
"How are you feeling about this?" asked Bruce.
“I do,” said Lena.
"She probably didn't have a chance to find out. Someone likely took her without permission. That's why it's important to be careful around strangers. Most people are good, Carl but there are some people who will hurt kids. So, that's why it's important to be mindful of strangers and always tell me or Mommy where you are going,” said Helmut.
“Want to spar, Cap?” asked Clint.
“Thanks, doc,” he said.
"The past won't affect my opinion of the newer generation," he said.
Edith shut the curtains closed. Steve tensed when she pulled a set of stirrups from under the bed.
"I wouldn't be asking if I did."
“Finally, someone who speaks English”, said Tony.
"It's meant to put the pup's head in position."
“Maybe I missed something,” said Tony.
"You sure you don't want to come with us, Steve," asked Rhodes.
“What you said was true,” said Tony.
Lena packed her things. Again the thrill of leaving was bittersweet. A plane was waiting for her on the ice. A very long flight and she’d be home.
They kissed softly.
*****
“I won’t be able to make it to Thanksgiving,” he said.
"Nothing to fancy."
“I thought I got them all,” said Tony.
“Shut up."
“Olivia and Isabella. The Make A Wish Foundation sent me their wishes. They wanted to be flower girls. I couldn’t say no. This means so much to them. That makes this day all the more special, knowing Tony and I could do this for them and their families,” said Steve.
“Who won the world series this year?” he asked.
Steve tensed. He heard footsteps not far. He closed his eyes trying to figure out how many. There were twelve maybe.
Fury uploaded the information relating to the bombing onto a separate drive. He would keep the identity of its maker to himself. He did not want Stark getting distracted by the news of his daughter before he'd gotten the information he needed about its production.
The gesture was solely aimed to hurt Tony. Steve sat up, throwing it into the trashcan across the room.
“Piper, she’s been kidnapped.”
“Do you know how to play?”
Steve quietly closed the door behind them.
Polio - On Saturday, June 17, 1916, an official announcement of the existence of an epidemic polio infection was made in Brooklyn, New York. That year, there were over 27,000 cases and more than 6,000 deaths due to polio in the United States, with over 2,000 deaths in New York City alone. From 1916 onward, a polio epidemic appeared each summer in at least one part of the country, with the most serious occurring in the 1940s and 1950s.
"Tony-”
Steve gently squeezed her hand in return.
No, he wasn’t letting him go so easily! He ran out of the tower, jumping into the sky. Wind whipped through hair. His arms wrapped firmly around Tony. The impact slammed them through one of the lab windows. Tony landed on top of him. He grabbed the alpha’s arms, stopping him from flying away.
“I won’t be able to sleep,” said Steve, voice toneless.
Tony burst from the river. He was ready to see Steve. Tonight he would purpose. He flew toward the city.
“I’ve taken that into consideration,” he said.
“No, strippers,” said Steve.
*****
He didn't respond, picking up the tray. She ate sitting across from him. The pup was staring intensely at his face. He wiped his mouth.
Her voice was soft and kind. It did nothing to relieve the gut feeling of distrust. She shut the door behind her, closing the only known exit. It wouldn't be difficult pushing her out of the way or for him to create a new entrance. He resisted the urge to growl.
“I will tell your dad about you. I promise,” he said.
“You shouldn’t bare your teeth at a superior, little girl.”
“You lie and kill in the service of liars and killers. You pretend to be so separate, to have your own code, something that makes up for the horrors. But they are part of you. And they will never go away. I won’t touch Barton, not until I make him kill you,” he said slamming his fists against the glass. She backed away further. “Slowly, intimately in every, he knows you fear. And then he’ll wake up just long enough to see his good work and when he screams, I’ll split his skull. This is my bargain to you mewling quim."
Steve swallowed the lump of discomfort in his throat. Edith awaited his approval to move forward.
Piper stared up at the florescent lights, but Lena didn’t come back. She closed her eyes and tried to sleep, shifting slightly. Her eyes snapped open when she realized she was in pull-ups. She'd been potty trained since was two. It made her feel ashamed. They were taking away even the smallest things she had under her control. Piper let out a frustrated scream, thrashing her limbs. Her restraints held strong.
“Stay, that’s what I want for Christmas,” whispered Tony in his ear.
“Sir.”
“Pity is in the definition of sympathy.”
Steve flung his shield at gaining the alphas’ attention. This pointless destruction they were allies. They were acting like children. Well, at least he was getting some practice in before the pup was born.
“What is all this stuff?” asked Rhodes.
“Steve!” Tony ran into the room.
He tensed. That tone was never a good sound. It meant that he’d doe something wrong.
“They are more like me than you.”
After they finished breakfast they went down to the lab. Steve bit his lip as Tony took off his shirt. He quickly focused his gaze on his hands.
Tony left his hold.
“California.”
“I can see elements of Van Gogh, but more aggressive. You turned the fear and pain of your past into something beautiful,” said Tony. Steve’s arms wrapped around him. His back was pressed against Steve’s firm chest.
The same scowl.
“I’m trapped here,” said Steve.
*****
“That can be arranged. Call Happy when you’re ready to go. And I’ll have some toys for you there,” said Tony.
“I’m surprised he actually agreed to come along,” said Clint.
“I haven’t had a Christmas for seven decades,” said Steve. He realized his mistake. He caught the heavy sadness in Tony’s gaze, but it lasted only a moment before it was hidden away. The anniversary of his parents was only a little less than a week away. This month must be hell for him. He wouldn't want to celebrate either. “I’m sorry, Tony. I forgot. We don’t have to."
Tony picked up his phone.
Steve returned to his apartment at the facility. Resting against his bed was his shield. He picked up the familiar object. The balance was perfect. Seventy years in the ice hadn’t changed that. There was a box on his kitchen counter. Inside it was a black tactical suit. He ran his fingers over the fabric sturdy.
Steve leaned against the boxing ring beside Barny. He noticed the large blueberry muffin in Barny's hand. The beta always brought him sweets that were far better than anything served in the cafeteria.
"We forgot to introduce ourselves. My name is Steve Rogers. I'm Piper's papa."
“You’ve been painting again. What was it this time?” asked Barny.
“Working on the reactor. He should be back soon.” Pepper offered him a glass of champagne.
"Daddy," she whined, trying to snag it back.
“I have to go,” he said.
“I didn’t mean it like that. You can touch me all you want soon but just need to clean your wounds. I would hate for them to scar,” said Steve. He didn't want any marks on his alpha. Any marks but his own.
“He’s not slowing down,” said Thor.
“Papa?”
"She didn't believe me when I told her I wasn’t.”
"Fine," said Tony.
"Did you miss me? When you were gone." Piper thought maybe she could explain by simile.
“Where’s Steve?” asked Natasha.
“Bru,”
"Stop thinking so much. It clouds things. Fighting is pure instinct.
"Our appointments are voluntary. Forcing you to be there would defeat the purpose."
Steve went to the bedroom, throwing his shirt into the hamper. He grabbed a fresh one from the drawer. The fabric scratched against his skin.
“Why do you always have to do that?” Piper asked, fixing her mussed hair. He shrugged. She stuck her tongue out him. Earning a slight smile from the alpha. She'd been seeing more of it lately. It was always a highlight of her day when she made Winter smile. On occasion, she could surprise a bright, toothy smile from him.
“Sir, I suggest you get some sleep,” said Jarvis.
“How stocked is the fridge?” asked Tony.
“I wouldn’t be so calm if I were you. You made enemies of Captain America and Ironman.”
“Okay.”
“Stark smiles a lot, but it’s rarely genuine. His genius is both a heavy burden and a gift. He's open with you,” she said.
There were always betas, but they couldn’t curve his heat if or when it came. Yet Howard found him attractive even after the serum.
The others nodded. They swiftly retreated. Steve got a better look at the bears. The mother had lost most of her fur. Its skin had blackened was cracked, oozing green sludge.
"Fine." His voice returning to a more normal tone.
He rocked his hips against the alpha, taking him at his own pace. Steve moaned as Tony pressed against his sweet spot. He tried to quicken the pace. Tony’s grip on his hips tightened. He yelped when Tony's teeth grazed against his skin.
“We have all we need hereto take care of her and you." The omega relaxed. “Let’s get you something to eat.”
Steve paced the small jet. He smiled when he caught Coulson following his posture. Even though Phil knew, it didn’t change how the beta saw him, which was a relief. He didn’t want people worrying over him. It would make his job harder.
“Hey, Happy,” said Steve.
Edith stared, stunned at the information she'd stumbled upon. Jarvis hadn't caught on to it. The baby wasn't half super soldier but a full-fledged super soldier in the making. What was even more astonishing how adaptable the child's DNA was. If it were introduced to the super serum, theoretically, the fetus would accept to strengthen itself. This child had the potential to surpass Steve in its strength if it was reintroduced to the serum. If it were any other pregnancy, the body would see it as a poison, and it would most likely kill the fetus.
“Why?” asked Barny.
Thankfully, by the time they reached the hotel, Piper was asleep. They checked into their room, quietly shutting the door shut behind them. Tony was exhausted after listening to their daughter cry for one hour and thirty minutes straight.
Smith woke, tied to his living room chair. A masked alpha stood in the corner watching him.
They were both relieved when Steve came. His presence alone softened the atmosphere between them. Edith opened her medical bag.
“I love you, Piper.”
He went down to his lab and down into the wine cellar. His phone rang. Happy’s broad forehead appeared on the screen.
“Won’t Jarvis tell your parents?” asked Rune.
"This is about the girl,” he said.
“This must be, Piper." The pup turned its head in recognition of her name. “May I see her?”
Steve lay in bed, watching the numbers on his clock change from 1:59 am to 2:00 am. Tony lay next to him. Their backs were turned to each other.
"Come on," said Tony, helping the omega up.
He nodded.
“How did this happen?” asked Tony.
They stood on opposites elevator. Steve wanted the alpha to press him against the wall and kiss him. He trusted Tony with that dominance. Those brown eyes slowly raked over him. Steve shivered.
“Why does your Papa have to see a doctor? He’s like us,” said Rune.
"No, one saw us."
, escape. But what if he turned into a different person? She'd rather he stay like this than to lose him. That felt selfish, but it was true all the same.
"And?"
“We have a room ready. Have you selected the massage?” she asked.
Steve handed her spatula.
Tony turned in his chair, touching their foreheads together. The alpha was spent, yet he endured. There were bags under his eyes and stress made his age more visible. He ran his fingers through Tony's hair. The few strands of gray were more apparent.
"No! I failed. He injected me with something. I couldn't see it but I felt the needle pierce into my womb,” said Steve. It was such a violation. “I couldn’t protect her,” he whimpered over and over.
“Yeah.”
“That was just a preview. This is opening night and Loki he’s a full tale diva. He wants flowers, he wants parades, he wants monuments to skies with his name plaster on it-
“What about the others of my team?” asked Steve.
Once the dishes were put away, they settled on the couch together. Tony pulled a blanket over them.
Lindbergh Baby - On March 1, 1932, Charles Augustus Lindbergh Jr., the 20-month-old son of aviator Charles Lindbergh and Anne Morrow Lindbergh, was abducted from the crib in the upper floor of his home in Highfields in East Amwell, New Jersey, United States. On May 12, the child's corpse[3] was discovered by a truck driver by the side of a nearby road.
“Third-degree burns along his arms, but that’s of little concern. He took a blast of shrapnel to his torso. His healing factor is trapping it further within him, shredding his internal organs faster than he can recover,” said Fury.
“Harley tell me what happening give a full report."
“It could be important,” he said. Steve snatched the phone from the counter.
"Why wouldn't you be?"
"If there were any negative results from the samples he would have told us sooner, not drop them on us now."
“You’re my friend,” she said.
"My mother left my dad and me when I was a kid. Dad was a boxer was murdered when I was young," said Matt.
"He's been injected with something," she said.
“She’ll adjust.”
“Sir.”
“You had a chance to tell me before! Did you not trust me?!” asked Tony.
"Shit, Steve, I just don't want to talk about," said Tony.
“For you as well,” said Rhodes.
“Why is she here?” asked Steve.
"Tony Stark, access confirmed," said a robotic voice. The door swung open.
"He's my mate!" growled Steve.
They all sat down too tired to move. Steve huddled close to him. Tony held him tight so afraid he may lose him again.
“It doesn’t make you weak.”
“Sorry for keeping you waiting.”
“Sew,” Winter repeated.
“You could quit. Stay here as you get your degree. Travel see the big art capitals of the world,” said Tony.
“Says the man who put her danger by threatening a terrorist!”
"Your New Year's Eve party in Malibu."
He watched as his mate soaked. His belly poked out from the water. Those dazzling blue eyes were closed. Steve was at peace for the moment. He was so beautiful. A brief kiss pushed him from his shock. There was a slight blush across the omega's cheeks.
“Me too we’ll keep her out of the limelight as much as possible,” said Tony. Piper started squirming in his arms. He put her back with her toys.
“Will you stay in New York?” asked Steve.
"Birth control methods had made great steps since then," she said.
“I wasn’t aiming for you. I was just angry.”
“How is he?” asked Pepper.
The hour-long drive was silent. The only sound was classical music playing softly in the background. Steve was grateful for the silence. The car stopped.
"What?" She must have misheard Lena. That couldn't be right.
There was no judgment in the alpha's gaze. Tony let him hide his face away until he was calm.
Steve hadn’t quite warmed to Pepper, but he was never unkind or rude. Most omegas would be far worse. That snarling earlier was more a scare tactic, than it was warning before an attack. It wasn’t like Steve, though, even off of a heat. It was concerning.
He distrusted S.H.I.E.L.D. but it was the safest option. Even at full speed, he couldn't get there fast enough. Finally, he got there. Steve was cuddled up against an empty Ironman suit. He was beaten and bruised. One of his eyes was swollen shut. His arms were covered in defensive wounds. Steve was muzzled. Tony released the clasp. Those perfect blue eyes opened.
"That's classified," said Fury.
“Yes, orange really isn’t my color. But Rumlow, men like you are a dime a dozen. Something to be thrown to the monsters. I'm something much more. I help tame and create their dreaded monsters."
They nuzzled. Tony coiled protectively around him. Steve savored the perfection. So protected so at ease. These had never been feelings he had during heat. He was safe. It took thirty minutes for the alpha to calm.
"Her doing nothing this time, doesn't mean she won't do something next. Do not allow her to lull you into a false sense of security. She's dangerous."
“I suppose.” Staying here posed risks, but less than before. Stark's job position still stood, and his talent wouldn't be wasted. It was something to think about. "Why biology. I thought physics and engineering were your preferred subjects?"
“You smell like him,” she said.
She folded her arms. "Why do you say that?"
Piper talked of her parents for hours. There were tears but they seemed happy, born out of pure emotion. But there was no doubt in his mind that she was truly wanted by her family.
He missed the glare aimed in his direction. Steve threw him over his board shoulder.
“Unlike you?” said Harley.
It went to directly to voicemail. This wasn’t like Tony. He always answered. It was too early for the alpha to be asleep. He ran out of his room, crashing directly into Natasha.
"Yeah, why?"
“How long are we here?”
"Will S.H.I.E.L.D. allow it?"
“A unicorn.”
“He’s fainted. This a lot to take in,” she said. They helped the unconscious omega into the backseat of the car. Then returned to the base. Nurses swarmed around them, taking the captain to the medical wing. The two agents took a seat in the waiting room.
“Where is that?”
“Something on your mind, Steve?” Dr. Turner asked.
"I don't know how I feel about a stranger seeing them,” admitted Tony.
“Nothing much,” said Natasha.
"Dating."
There was a flash of lighting.
Steve relaxed, settling into the love seat in the room.
“His six centimeters dilated.” Edith moved away, taking off her rubber gloves. "I'll have to check again in an hour."
"Your parents wouldn't give up on you. Don't give up on them." It was wrong of him to encourage that level of hope. But it was right in another sense.
“Can you at least pretend to be tired?”
"They haven't inferred so far," said Tony.
“You haven’t changed at all,” she whispered.
“Steve."
“I believe you do.”
The response to the handlers’ absence was immediate. The opponents jumped away from each, sizing each other up.
Bloom straightened up in her seat. “You’re intentionally trying to scare me.”
The few times the pup managed to land a strike were painful. She was loosening the restriction on strength, yet was keeping control, directing the power into her tiny fists. It had taken her some time in several broken fingers for her to achieve a balance of strength that wouldn’t cause self-injury.
Steve carded his fingers through his mate's hair, dragging him into a deep kiss. Tony's callused hand traveled down his chest, stopping briefly at the waistband of his pants before yanking them down. The alpha sat him on the counter. There was something primal to his expression, mirroring his own. Tony’s increasing touches melting him to putty. He rubbed his hips, shamelessly against his mate’s.
January 29, 2016
"Exactly, how much would that affect an alpha?"
“For the average person of his height and weight at this stage would be experiencing a sense of confusion, dysphoria, with nausea and vomiting, with possible blackouts. But with his tolerance these percentages aren’t always accurate,” said Jarvis.
“I love you too,” replied Steve.
Steve yawned. He huddled close to Tony. Their forms were sticky and sweaty, but he didn’t care. Showering could wait until morning. Tony huddled close to him.
“If you don’t mind.” said Bruce.
"You'll need it one day."
"Hello?"
“But as I looked out over that city nobody knew I was there nobody could see me. No one was even looking. I had a thought that would guide me for years to come, anonymity, Tony. Thanks to you it's been my mantra ever since, right. To simply rule from behind the scenes, because the second you give evil a face you'll be liable. You hand the people a target."
“I understand why you were keeping him such a secret, Tony,” said Rhodes.
And he did. They went to the training room. A girl was there. She was tiny and fragile looking. He’d seen other gifted people, fought a lot of them even, but never someone so close in age to him. The silver blond guy, who could run super-fast, and the weird red-haired woman were adults. Her blue eyes were distant. Bruises marked her skin, yet her hair was neatly cared for. Someone cared for her and another had hurt her. She smelled sweet, but he couldn't recognize the elements of her scent. But it was different, like everyone else he'd met who was special. It kinda reminded him of that alpha with a metal arm.
“I should remind you he’s still in feral state and remain that way until your heat is complete,” said Jarvis.
“Excuse me do we come to your planet and blow up the place?” said Fury.
“I’m too close, but you want to bring in the victim’s parent.”
“What the score now?” asked Tony.
"I got caught up in it. Such a beautiful display. I'm glad you enjoyed your new toy," said Tony.
"I don't think so. Whoever this person is, it isn't like what we’ve had to endure,” said Piper.
, he wanted to work on a project with someone else, that was a first. It could end badly, but it would show Steve he was willing to work together. He bought it.
"Most likely time. Maybe if given a reason it would stabilize." Lena shrugged noncommittally.
“Pepper?”
“Steve! She’s capable of handling herself. She assessed the situation and deemed it safe enough to approach. If she didn't think she could handle it, she wouldn't have done it."
Lena shrugged, pulling up the biological information they did have on Piper. It was old, from when she was an infant. They needed a fresh blood sample. Among the other things, Lena had to figure out a way for the Extremis in Piper’s DNA to activate. That would have to wait.
“And you’re week is clear,” he said.
"I'm as ready as anyone can be in my situation," said Steve.
"I don't want you to go under the knife."
“Yes, I knew, and I’m about to tell you something beyond your clearance.”
Steve hesitated at the door. “Maybe we can go later,” said Steve, backing into the shelter of the room.
January 1, 2013
“8:30 pm,” said Jarvis.
“Is our meeting something to be ashamed of?” asked Steve.
“What’s the last big attack you remember?”
Steve purrs softened.
As soon as he undid the bands, she stilled allowing him to change her with little fuss. Once a fresh diaper was on she was back to rolling around. He got up from bed, taking Piper with him. They went into the kitchen. There were signs that Tony had been there. The alpha had an inability to put his dishes into the washer even though the machine was only feet away from the sink.
"Dr. Turner is here. He's waiting in my office."
“And why is that?” asked Steve.
Powerful wave alpha pheromones were hard on Steve's senses. The urge to protect his pup from this pushed him toward Tony.
“I think you’ll be the one left wanting more,” said Steve with a roll of his hips, which left the alpha wordless for a few moments.
“A week maybe more,” he said.
“So, can you cure me?” asked Piper. Maybe something good could happen from this horrible experience.
“I see what's behind all that bluster and confidence. The fear, guilt, sadness, and regret. And you’re one of the few has seen it in me,” said Steve. her played nervously with his hands. As soon as he’d returned his decision was made. “And you were right about Bucky. It was my fault."
Maybe, but Tony wanted to handle things himself! Get answers himself, as an alpha, and powerful leader –
Tony looked at Steve. The omega nodded.
He followed her into the kitchen. Aunt Peggy’s home always cozy compared to his father’s lavish mansion. It was lived in. His home lacked the element of family life. There were scuffs in the paint and marks on the doorways showing the growth of her pups, Steven and Emma. He caught her pausing in front of kettle, seemingly, not knowing what to do. Tony’s heart dropped, seeing such a brilliant woman struggle with such a simple task.
Tony blinked, not sure if he was hearing his mate right. Maybe all the caffeine was finally getting to him? “Say that again?”
Lena laughed.
“My daughter isn’t dead! She’s missing!” Tony shouted. He groaned as his heart started clenching. The monitor began beeping rapidly.
Tony flinched. He wanted to shoot out the windows and take his omega back. It wasn’t the right approach, no matter how tempting it was. Growling when the alpha of the apartment moved closer to Steve.
Their jet finally landed. Steve instantly got out his seat stretching out. A wave of heat hit him as they stepped foot into a desert. Large sand dunes surrounded them.
“This isn’t you, Tony!” he screamed.
“Why is Rhodes here?” asked Steve.
"I'm sorry about your friend," said Happy.
Steve blushed. Tony moved next to him.
"This has to stay between us for the time being," said Steve.
“We’ll find her,” he said running his fingers through Steve’s hair.
“And I like taking you to museums. Or I could take to a motorcycle show,” said Tony.
"Yes, I'm not meant to enter that state."
Tony growled when Steve's hand closed around him. He moved atop the omega. Steve shifted underneath him. His arousal moved against the lace, thrusting against Steve's thigh. Tony rocked against the dampening fabric of Steve's lace briefs. Steve canted his hips against. Tony ripped away the fabric separating him from Steve, sliding into his mate. A tight wet heat surrounded him. His thrusts were deep in slow. Steve's legs were locked around his waist, taking him deeper.
He bit his lip but returned to the couch. “What if something happens? This is dangerous.”
“I’m going to bed now.”
“What does he do?” asked Rune.
“Tony, don't.”
“Yes. Winter, you may come in,” said Lena, buzzing an intercom near the door.
“Tony, wanted me to bring these,” said Happy. Handing him a garment bag. He huffed this was the first omega Tony had got on with in some time. What had happened between the two of them to send him running to another alpha?
It took a moment for him to respond. "Sorry, Tony, I don't know where my mind is. What did Bruce say?"
Tony returned to the lab and gave Bruce the hair samples, then took a seat at another desk. Ostensibly, he was only checking over the systems that Jarvis put in place.
Steve visibly relaxed.
“Tony won't be up any time soon. It was a long night,” said Steve. He blushed. “Not because of that."
“I take it you like it,” said Steve.
“No one looks for a dead man,” said Natasha.
“I’ll be there in thirty."  She hung up.
aid Rhodes.
“You two had a fight,” said Rhodes.
Tony caught the self-doubt in Steve's expression. His mate thought he was ashamed.
Tony started the car.
“You can’t use my own moves against me, Steve. You’re deflecting."
"You can let it out."
“I’ve seen enough.” Her combative training was excelling at an acceptable pace.
“Will she show up again?”
Tony took Steve’s hands in his.
The four enjoyed the day together. Around six Piper started getting fussy.
Tony went to the lab. Taking out the communicator that Thor had given them in case of emergencies. Thor had given each of the Avengers one. Tony smirked when he heard a beep then a recording telling him to leave a message.
"A bit sore. Not all of us have a superhuman healing factor," said Tony.
“I don’t remember it being that easy. This guy packs a wallop,” said Steve.
A beta woman sat at the child’s table in the center of the playroom. She reminded Piper of Snow White with her pale skin, ebony hair, and red painted lips. Piper couldn’t get a real feel for her scent under her citrus perfume.
She would find him again if it were the last thing she did. Piper cried out as her power surged. She straightened when a feral instinct overtook her, tucking her fingers around the collar and easily breaking it from her neck. She charged into the base, letting her nose guide her.
“Alpha,” he whimpered.
“What going on out there?” asked Rune.
“Tell him to stop,” said Pierce.
“It’s okay. I’m just not used to talking about him. But she’d kinda like him, but not as broken and more umm…human. And she’s not a super-soldier.”
“You’re right,” said Happy.
“They are good people.”
“I’m sorry. I’m sorry,” he chanted.
“No,” he said.
“I’m not a doctor.”
"They trained together and were rivals for a while, competing for the head of S.T.R.I.K.E. Rumlow was lead on a deciding mission. He miscalculated. Got the entire team was killed except for him and Neema. Him being him, he pinned it on her. By the time it was cleared up he was given the position and she was demoted,” said Natasha.
“Mmmhmm.”
“That wasn’t because of the kiss,” he said.
Tony set her down on the changing table. He took a breath before unfastening the diaper, throwing it out and putting her in a fresh one. Ever since they'd started introducing solid food her diapers had taken on a new level of stink, apparently, that was normal.
Steve woke up the early next morning to the sound of his phone ringing. He quietly left the bed taking his phone into the bathroom.
“Another step closer.” Finally, they were closer to their daughter.
"Do we have to stay inside?" asked Piper.
*****
Tony was forced to come up from his lab at two in the morning for a coffee refill. In a moment of frustration, he blasted his coffee machine. Poking at the debris on the kitchen counter, he heard Steve whimpering in their bed. He quietly crept into their bedroom, trying not to make any sudden sounds, and sat down on Steve’s side of the bed.
She broke his gaze, her posture shrinking. “You don’t gotta answer.”
“Yes.”
She shook her head. "If I die, Killian, what happens to your soldiers? What happens to your product?"
“Do you want help?’ asked Tony.
“I need to know if they’re healthy,” he said.
“Shield?” asked Steve.
He sent his sent the suit to the sky. It locked onto Air Force One's location. Taking out the single Extremis soldier. A large hole had been ripped in the plane people were being flung out.
Days passed smoothly. Steve groaned hitting the alarm. He’d slept over at S.H.I.E.L.D so he wouldn’t have to make an early morning commute. Steve yawned. He never slept well here. But staying here also let him get whatever he needed from Edith early. Steve changed into the uniform given him. He went to the hangar. Natasha waited with the quinjet.
“Done.”
“He rigged the thing,” said Tony.
Steve was already losing Tony to the information, so he joined Phil in the elevator.
"I'm okay, sweetie."
Steve looked up when the door opened again. Frowning when Edith came in.
"Thanks, honey."
"I know you and Tony would never let that happen. It's a risk you should be aware of," said Bruce.
Tony took a breath. Now his search was limited to all of Hell’s Kitchen. Better than all New York. Footprints on rooftops caught his attention. That’s why there was little footage of him, he traveled along the rooftops. All he had to do was follow the prints. He stopped when the footprints came to an end. Tony landed on the roof. His facemask lifted. Steve’s scent was strongest here. He’s here.
“Can borrow you for a moment, Steve? Something is wrong with my tent,” she said.
George followed the adults to the playground. The pups had taken the high ground.
Tony grabbed his hand.
Piper clutched her daddy's hand. Why did it have to be a beta? She knew that not all betas were terrible. But, it was harder to trust them.
“You should have known that from the start,” she said.
“What are you laughing at?”
“I wish I could stay longer.”
"Hopeful, there's nothing wrong with being hopeful."
"Try, I'll even pose nude." Steve blushed. He wouldn’t want anyone else seeing his alpha in a state of undress.
"Can't afford it I can do a great deal over my Stark Pad. It's completely secure and I'll be able to run all simulations I need. Besides, I only need to visit toward the end of each of your terms. Things may get messy if I stay longer. That's the last thing we need," said Bruce.
“Good.”
“He's not her anything. I'm doing the guy a favor. One we'll both enjoy."
“Yours,” said Steve.
“Sorry, it isn’t that you aren’t attractive. You are handsome."
“How can you be so calm? One of your closest friends is missing,” said Steve.
“What did she say?” asked Natasha.
“You don’t want to hurt me,” the pup repeated, voice softer and knowing.
"To you as well."
“Where is he?” asked Steve.
"Yes, she'll want to see you, after all, that's happened. And we aren't taking a sports car."
“Not tired,” said Tony with a wave of his hand.
Winter was pushed back into the chair. Heavy metal manacles wrapped around his arms, locking him in place. A bite guard was shoved into his mouth. Winter closed his eyes, jolting in his seat as an electrical current surged through his skull, ripping away the memories he treasured.
Bruce suddenly clapped. Piper’s limbs splayed out from her body.
"Jarvis."
“Can ask why there’s a hole in neighbor’s wall?” asked Tony.
was here before him?
“What do you think he’ll say?” said Tony.
"Always the war?" asked Barny.
, he even wished Howard was here. Rubbing his life in Howard's face even at this low point would be satisfying Tony got up; he couldn’t stay in this room any longer. The temptation was too much. The last thing he needed was to get blackout drunk. He went to the lab, hoping Bruce had something to distract his mind.
“Next time I won’t lose him,” said Steve.
Piper gave up on the subject. It was getting her nowhere. "Is it weird, my DNA?"
“I called in a favor,” he said.
"Are you sure it was wise to leave those two alone?" asked Jarvis.
“Piper, every action has consequences.”
“What is it?” asked Matt.
He looked over the information. Everything seemed normal. At eight in the morning, Steve showed signs of waking up. He woke with a start, nervously taking in his surroundings.
“Stop!” yelled Maya. Hurting an unborn pup went too far.
“Never, only packing,” Lena reassured.
*****
“Do you know how I became Ironman?” he asked.
“A doggy.”
“We’re going to S.H.I.E.L.D. today,” he said.
“Why are we needed for that?” asked Natasha.
“You were bluffing!”
"Fine," huffed Tony.
“Your theory was correct. The stress of the kidnapping triggered the latent reaction between the super-soldier serum and Extremis present in her DNA," said Tony.
*****
“You’ll understand when you love someone that much,” said Maria.
Pepper didn’t dare cry. She didn't have the right to. Steve was barely holding it together. Her breaking down would only make it more difficult. She noticed the woman standing near Steve. “Who are you?”
“How long did it take you to get used to it?”
“It’s inconsiderate to those who work here,” said Steve.
He rushed into the room. The pup was perfectly fine. There were no noticeable injuries.
Steve nodded. “It was nice. Did you think you would hurt me?”
"So I knocked you up on the first day," he said proudly.
"Why am I purring like this?" Steve couldn't focus. His inner omega was overjoyed. The purring was incessant. It was thrilling to have a mate the would kill to protect them. They were talking about his friend.
“What our reasoning for going there?” he asked.
“Alpha."
“You don’t know how much I wish I had,” said Steve. If he had quit, his daughter wouldn’t be missing. "I suppose it’s too late for me. Being a soldier is all I know."
Steve’s hands fisted suddenly, striking the wall. Shoulders slumping as he pulled his hand free from drywall, he slid to the floor. Scowling when tears leaked down his face. “I’m sorry. I don’t know why I said that.”
“I don’t want another pup after going through this.” There was so much trauma that needed to be undone with Piper. And there's always the chance it could happen again if they had another child.
“You don’t like being underground,” said Piper.
Steve rested his head on Tony’s shoulder.
Tony smirked as the line went quiet.
“I don’t get it,” said Natasha.
“Don’t take it personally. I don’t remember what I had for breakfast,” said Tony.
Rumlow grabbed a gas mask. “Open the cell.”
“Yeah, no bad call he loves his hammer,”
Phil left. Steve sat on the couch. It gave him a view of the door. He didn’t want anyone sneaking up on him. The door opened. He tensed. A tall alpha came striding. He had a warm smile and kind eyes.
He went to Tony's lab, typing in the code. The door instantly swung open for him. His inner omega calmed as soon as he stepped foot in his alpha's domain. Dum-E and U came rolling over to greet him. Dum-E handed him a screwdriver. He tossed it and the bots went chasing after it. Steve sketched at the table. His hand only leaving the page to throw the tool for Dum-E or U. Their company even though artificial was better than nothing. His pencil snapped as cramping clawed throw his lowering stomach. He tumbled from the stool onto the cool concrete ground.  Dum-E and U came speeding toward him. The two claws hands looked nervously at him.
She took in her surroundings. The walls were gray and the fluorescent light stung her eyes. Bars surrounded her every side.
“You weren’t telling the truth, and I wanted to get you back. And you always ask me to tell the truth, but don’t do it yourself!” She stamped her foot, trying not to throw a tantrum. It would be so much easier than having this conversation. “What you’re asking isn’t fair when you won’t do the same.”
“I’m fine.” Steve leaned over, bringing Tony into a kiss. Tony’s hands moved to him.
Steve threw back the blanket, leaving their nest. Instinct didn’t allow him to go far from mate.
“Sleeping probably will be pissed that I’m not there when he wakes up,” he said.
“When we were dancing it made me think of the moment before the crash. Peggy was telling me how’d we go dancing,” said Steve.
“I’ll try,” said Steve.
"Will you ask me that every time I shower?" said Steve.
Winter's flight landed. There was only one airport in Glasgow, and it was unusually crowded. He counted at least fifty cameras.
“I’ll come as soon as I can. And Steve.”
“She’s a clever girl. She’ll be able to handle it,” said Tony.
“Bedroom?” asked Tony.
It seemed like a breach of the public’s privacy, but under this circumstance it was reasonable. Even with all that would it be enough? He wasn’t sure how much time this would use up. Steve watched as Natasha peer at an image of Clint on the screen. Her expression yielded none of her worries.
The omega's scent grew in its intensity. Tony lost his battle against his wild counterpart. His eyes dilated fully, and teeth sharpened, an alpha in full rut. He rolled his shoulders. So long had he been caged away. There was only one priority, his omega. Nothing would keep him from protecting him.  He stalked toward Steve's hiding place, keeping his position low so not to spook the already frighten being. The omega had hidden behind a row of designer shirts. It was a pathetic attempt. Almost cute in away. Soft whimpers lured him near.  He pushed aside the veil of clothes. A pungent scent of fear hit him.
Christina took Piper from the changing table on a scale.
“Sure. Jarvis, place the order,” said Tony.
"Yes, your frequent visits have drawn quite a crowd. Everyone hopes to catch a glimpse of you. But I set aside your favorites. Half a dozen cinnamon buns and half a dozen blueberry muffins," said Pray.
“Do you have somewhere I can work?” asked Bruce.
He shot from the bed. It was too soon to have this conversation. Steve grabbed him, stopping him from leaving.
“I’m here to ask about you.”
“No.”
“Steve."
“Hm?”
“But I’m an omega. It engrained into me to care and love my pup,”
“The Neanderthal Man,” she read.
"I made your favorite the least you could is a bite."
Edith’s fingers twitched.
“You okay?” he asked.
"It's classified information. There’s been nine bombings,” said Rhodes.
“I just know.”
“What do you think about him, Rhodey?” asked Tony.
"It's fine I'll get you a new phone when I get home."
Peggy Carter would send Tony science fiction books while he was at boarding school to give him a break from academics. They proved to be the inspiration for many of his projects.
“I’m relieved my daughter is back,” he said.
March 10, 2016
"Good news is a high-level position has just been vacated," said Killian.
Steve’s heart fluttered. Alpha considered him his.
Steve dropped his bag. He went the alpha. Steve looked into those perceptive brown eyes. Behind the fading anger were regret, pain, and guilt. He ran his fingers through Tony’s hair.
“Hey, G.I. Joe,” he laughed.
“Don’t be embarrassed. Rhodey, has found me doing worse,” said Tony.
“I wouldn’t mind.”
Thor caught him before he collapsed.
They reached the city and pulled into Stark Tower. The garage was filled with similar cars to the one they were in.
Nothing. He was started to feel a little foolish.
Natasha sped to the tower. The alien she was using to stir growled underneath her control. She dodged blast going past her head. Loki.
“Perfect timing I need your wrist,” said Tony.
Steve woke up, panting. He kicked off the blankets but brought little to no relief. How long had they been asleep? His muscles ached. Steve’s fingers ripped at the fabric of the nest. Heat clawing up his spine. Sweat soaked his skin, making it gleam. His arousal ached. Rutting his hips against the bedding didn't provide the sensation he was desperately searching for. His touch did nothing to relieve the agonizing lust burning desire coursing through him.
“Yes, sir."
“I’ll be fine as long as I have him,” said Tony.
“The youngest is starting her first year of high school. There are pictures on the fridge,” she said.
"So for you, it must be infuriating not to be able to figure out what wrong with yourself, your parents, and your friends. Even the most complex machines you could likely figure out, but humans are different. It must feel like you're failing, not only them but yourself by not being able to fix what's wrong." Piper's hands stilled, but she kept her gaze down."You could learn all the patterns of a person, but they can still do something you never could have predicted, which another discomfort. That's why you prefer people getting straight to the point, so you don't have to waste your time studying a pattern that may teach you nothing."
Winter stared at the boy, waiting to feel something. It was just a person. A stranger that meant nothing to him. Piper had something about her. Something familiar.
“I’m surprised you gave him an actual name.”
“I hope you do,” said Steve.
He stepped back, trying to pull forth something from the deep nothingness.
“Are you having another attack? I didn’t even mention New York."
“I'll send them a fruit basket,” said Tony.
*****
“I have no idea. But it has to be important for him to come here in person,” said Tony.
"Go ahead, kid."
“I'm excited for tomorrow. ”
She hid her face in his neck. Piper didn't make a move to break the embrace, wanting to enjoy it for however long he would tolerate it. He rubbed her back.
"I suppose there's a lot of things to get used to," said Rhodes.
“You funded the work the least I could do was send my first pieces. What do you think? Be honest,” said Steve.
"Honestly, I never thought I'd see you again," she said.
Piper forced a smile.
“Say yes.”
“Both of us know how unlikely it would be for any positive results,” he said.
“What do you mean you can’t?!”
“I love it. I think it will help you to have one down here. You seemed to sleep better in my nest. If you don’t want one here, that’s fine,” said Steve. The lab was his alpha's territory. Steve was fine giving him that. But it might help to have something of his here too.
“Where?” asked Fury.
, he wasn’t worthy of it.
"Is it unreasonable that I want to spend time with the daughter I haven't seen in six months?" Piper turned away from him. “Do you know how much we missed you?”
Piper whined.
*****
“I swear, Captain Rogers, I am only a consultant employed by S.H.I.E.L.D. I will give them only the most basic information I see necessary. There are no recording devices in this room. Whatever you say stays between us. I won’t even take notes if that makes you more comfortable,” he said.
Tony woke a five in the morning.
“No, no, this is much worse,” said Banner.
"Downstairs playing with her legos,” said Steve.
Winter simply nodded, his gaze focused forward. Piper took a worried breath, snipping the first wire, and carefully studying the others before continuing.
After ten minutes, the tightening sensation across his abdomen faded. Steve sighed.
He moved to his corner.
“Hey, boss. Shit-
It was getting harder to breathe. She started coughing. Piper fell onto her side and whimpered. There was another explosion, but she couldn’t move in time. A rafter landed on top her, knocking out what little breath she had. She heard sirens blare in the distance. All she wanted were her parents.
"Okay, take all the time you need." Tony walked away giving him some needed space.
She huffed clearly not impressed. He heard the rustle of paper. Jeri handed them to him. The agreement was written in brail.
“Anthony was his greatest creation. He believed the boy capable of surpassing him and he has. Howard was so proud,” she said.
“Thank you, Ms. Romanoff,” said Jarvis.
“I have to leave."
“I don’t know.”
"I wouldn't be here if it weren't. I'll see you next week."
“Where would you go if you go anywhere?” asked Piper.
“Yes, sir."
“We’ll fix that when you’re further along,” he said.
Those bright blue eyes stared up at him. They held an unconditional love he'd never experienced. It was heart-melting. He would do his best to be worthy of it. Nothing could be in the way of protecting her. The clump of shrapnel in his chest would always pose a risk. Why not remove a risk he controlled.
Piper and Rune looked up from their game. Their highly tuned hearing picked up on the chaos outside. From Rune's windowless cell Piper could gain no further information on what was happening.
“Sir, Steve is out of harm’s way,” said Jarvis.
“You have to respect people’s boundaries,” said Steve.
“I’m sorry about the bar."
“Better safe than sorry," said Edith.
“So, how much does Uncle Sam owe you?”
“Umm, Switzerland.”
“Make a list. Jarvis will send it to Happy,” he said.
“And I’m looking at right now,” he said.
“You know, I’ve got a cluster of shrapnel, trying every second to crawl its way into my heart. This stops it. This little circle of light. It’s part of me now, not just armor. It’s a terrible privilege,” said Tony, gently tapping the arc reactor.
Steve regained consciousness. He was jammed into a small cage, next to Pepper. They were somewhere new. He could smell saltwater and oil. She was slowly regaining consciousness. Killian was watching over her. The man had his shield.
January 6, 2016
He took the bowl away. She huffed at him but settled her back in her chair. He offered her a spoonful of the greenish mush. She opened her mouth to eat, and eventually finished off the entire bowl. He wiped off her face. How she managed to get it all over her face was beyond him. On the second attempt, she accepted the bottle. He hummed to her as she ate. Those innocent blues eyes looked up at him.
“Come on, Tony.” Steve couldn’t find him. He took a breath. “Close it.”
"Mostly."
“You think I’m going to let you forget. If you let me see those paintings I will,” said Natasha.
“You and your papa are too alike sometimes.”
*****
“Do you want to tell me why you were at Stark’s mansion?” he asked.
Their relationship was solid. They had their fights but they were minor in comparison to what they’d survived. His hand slid into his pocket, running his fingers over the small velvet box. It took him some time to figure out a metal would best withstand Steve's strength.
He didn't want to do this without Steve.
"Why?"
Tony relaxed. Neither of them was ready for a pup yet. Maybe in a few years, he would bring up the question. He laughed. Tony Stark was actually considering pups.
“The Black Widow, she’s a beautiful omega with a very specific skill set,” said Lena. The widow was a beast within, but her outward appearance more than made up for it.
“You’re very understanding, Stark,” said Thor.
“I'm fine."
“Anything else like animals.”
“And his prints?” asked Steve.
“Like I said it doesn’t matter anymore.”
“How about the girl?” Pierce caught flash anger blaze through Winter’s gaze.
"Not bad."
*****
He pulled away, thinking he caused Steve some discomfort.
“Even though I’m-
Piper yelped when she was shot with another tranquilizer dart at close range. The jet started rolling forward. She was not leaving without Winter. Her eyes went a glowing blue. She broke the shackles binding her.
“But I could have! What if I had slept with you and her?!”
“Pipes are you ready to go home?” asked Tony.
“Can I stay here?” he asked.
“That’s the question you’re going to start with? Why not dive into what you really want to know? I agreed to answer. I’m not going to go back on my word.”
“Alpha.”
“I’m sorry for dropping that on you.”
He nodded. Steve packed a bag so Piper would have something to do. She got fussy if she didn't have something to engage her mind. He set up a play area for not far from the sparing mat for her.
Steve broke down crying, collapsing. Tony brought Steve into his arms, clutching him tightly.
Tony got up, instantly stepping on one of Piper’s Legos.
"I think we are underestimating her. And does this story have an answer for Rune?" asked Tony.
The omega stopped.
“How old are you?”
Tony instantly picked on the tightness in Steve’s voice. “Steve.”
The conversation changed to less serious topics.
He nodded. There a chance of a possible alien invasion and all he could think about was his boyfriend. Their most recent conversation only left him with more questions. Questions that wouldn’t be answered until this was over.
“You didn’t mean it.”
“You still don’t understand!” he snarled.
“Not yet,” said Steve.
“Shall we go?” said Lena.
“Why?”
"Thank you for handling this for us," said Steve.
Winter sat with his back against the wall, his feet firmly planted against the floor. Usually, he found comfort in small areas. They gave him a full view of his surroundings. But, for the first time, he’d been threatened with something he actually feared. Winter couldn't calm his heart rate. He yanked a screw from the doorframe and carved Piper's initials into his prosthetic arm with the screw.
“Fabio?”
“Get away from her.”
"My mate isn't going to sleep on the couch when he has a perfectly nice bed. Tell me what's wrong so we can both sleep," said Tony
"Why ask me and not someone from S.H.I.E.L.D?" asked Bruce.
“Ten bucks says he faints when you tell him,” said Natasha.
He ran his hand down Steve's back. The omega arched into his touch purring. Steve smirked. Tony shivered. He had only seen it once before he'd seen that gesture. Tony never thought he would see it out of Steve’s feral heat state.
Steve twitched. He glanced at the elevator. Alpha wasn't here. He should have never sent him away.
Steve opened the wallet. It was a New York license. It claimed his name was Grant Walters.
She thrashed against him, snapping her sharp teeth at his neck. Then she smirked, kneeing him in the crotch. He groaned, going to his knees.
“You’re not eating.”
“You remind me of myself when I was young.”
She pulled away from him. “I’m fine.”
“Penguins battling elephants seals,” said Helmut.
“Can you give me a lift?” asked Clint.
Tony wasn't stopping him from working or forcing him into the stay at home omega life. Steve had fallen into it. It became a habit. When Steve grew up this was what omegas were supposed to do. This was the kind of life his mom and Bucky wanted for him. There was a time when he actually wanted a life like that, but then he’d realized there was so much more out there. He shook away the thought.
“Sounds perfect”, said Steve.
“What’s the verdict doc?”
"It's durable. You surviving the battle without miscarrying proves that. It has most likely taken on your healing abilities. How much so will be determined when it's born," said Bruce.
“Steve?” His husband pressed a kiss on Tony’s lips. He quickly welcomed the intimacy, but he had to break away. Taking in the self-inflicted damage to his lab. "I have to process that footage."
“My doctor at a heat facility. I was weak and sickly while in heat and needed special attention. He used my situation to his advantage."
they won’t anymore if they ever find me.”
“Then who taught you how to cook?” asked Steve.
“Do want me to answer, sir?” he asked.
Tony rolled his eyes. Oprah tried for years to get an interview with him. Every time he declined. He was sure she would use this as a chance to use some of the questions come up with over the years.
“And Pepper?”
Even within his armor, Tony felt the frigid temperature. He landed in front of the base, undetected by the sensors. He easily cracked the door. Tony expected some response. A few steps in, and he saw the carnage. Bullet holes marked the walls.
“I missed you so much, Piper.”
Rune smiled brightly. He knew that he wouldn't hear that often through the duration of their friendship.
“No, it’s alright. I wouldn’t have come aboard if I couldn’t handle pointy things,” said Bruce.
Steve was mentally drained. There were only ten minutes left in the session. All he wanted to do was cuddle up with Piper.
“Papa will be better soon."
They pulled up to the Natural History Museum. Tony led him to a back entrance. He knocked on the door three times. An elderly security guard let them in.
"I have to."
"You're right, Piper. They wouldn't want you," said Lena.
“When?”
“What?”
“No, just had to bribe her with a car,” said Tony.
“Love you too."
“She’s already trying to speak. Has she said her first words yet?”
“I’ll try to eat more next time.”
“Mmm, Tony." Still hazy with sleep.
Steve fell asleep cuddled against the alpha.
“I’m not trying to-
“He threw two of our men through a wall,” said Maria.
“You’re pregnant,” said Happy turning pale in the face.
“Captain Rogers, is currently watching animal planet,” said Jarvis.
“Was there someone you wanted to visit?” he asked.
“No, Piper, that will never happen. And I’m sure Papa would say the same thing. And before you ask, none of this was your fault.”
“Trouble at home?”
“Nothing will happen to him?” asked Piper.
“I know.”
Jeff stared at his co-worker, stunned. “Did you just hit her?”
Tony packed a bag for Piper. It should be enough. He went to the lab. Piper cried for him as soon as he entered. He quickly swept her up in his arms. “Shh, it’s okay.”
His laser cut through the heavy chunks of metal clogging the rotors. He dislodged it.
“Yeah, you refused to let me leave your side,” said Tony. Finally, he could relax. His instincts had been haywire for the last twelve hours. Every whine or whimper called him back to Steve.
“Kids,” said Steve.
“Okay, sweetheart.”
"I can think of a way for us to enjoy it more," he said rocking his hips against Steve's. Steve tensed underneath him. His face flushing a deep red. The omega tried hiding his face.
“Should I ignore it?" she asked.
“Bathroom.”
"Which is?"
Steve got into the car waiting outside. He got into the back seat. Steve watched the buildings pass by. Once they made it out of the city Natasha sped up. Work was work. He accepted it and enjoyed it, but he wished it came at another time.
“Do you need an escort?”
“Can I hold her?”
“I have to get going,” he said. Stark wouldn’t tolerate his presence for much longer. “Tell me if you change your mind, Rogers.”
“What’s yours?” asked Steve.
“But that’s not what this conversation about,” continued Natasha.
“Did you fix the problem?” he asked.
“He’s gone, sweetheart,” said Tony.
Rune just watched as she continued talking about all these different kinds of places. She wasn't talking to him even though she said we. More thinking out loud. She huffed rubbing her temples.
"You have a title, that's all. You serve at my pleasure, Pepper."
"You need to eat."
“Steve?”
“Please,” he begged on the verge of tears.
Tony instantly moved in front of him, placing a hand on Steve’s stomach. “I won’t let that happen."
“Let me,” said Maya. She handed it to him.
They continued working through the slides. Edith and Natasha made it fun even got him to laugh.
The gaspy breathy way Steve said his name was almost enough to send him over the edge. Steve’s teeth traced over the tender line his neck, causing him to moan and grind into the omega seated on top of him. He rolled their positions, so the beauty was perfect skin was pressed closely against his. Tony shivered, fisting the carpet as Steve’s hand traveled underneath the waistband of his pants, timidly rubbing him.
Hopefully, they have that chance soon. He needed to properly examine the flash drive and computer.
"I don’t blame her."
"I wish you didn't have to wait for me to know that was possible," said Tony.
“Clint,” said Natasha. He had the least connection with Piper.
Pierce studied the boy. The pup's presentation was less than impressive. He was dressed in a white jumpsuit, tangled dark brown hair hung loose down his shoulders. The boy was tall for five. He looked nothing the donor source from which he was created. The only trait the two had in common were those stormy blue eyes.
“Thank you, Jarvis.”
Tony shivered against him tightening his hold around his omega as he came a second time. His knot deflated. Steve whined as he pulled out. A mixture of cum and slick leaked from between Steve’s leg. Tony wiped the mess with the bedsheet. He would have to rebuild Steve’s nest and give him fresh bedding. He wasn’t sleeping in this, but now he was exhausted. All he wanted to do cuddle with his omega and sleep until he was needed again.
“I’m going on a walk.”
“Oh yes, I’ve met them,” said Loki.
A muzzle was locked around his mouth and nose. A sweet-smelling gas filled his senses he couldn't keep his eyes open. Steve fought the losing battle against its effects, with every passing second his eyes grew heavier. He had to protect his pup. Steve gazed up at his attacker whimpering. He hated the noise how pathetic it made him feel, but he was desperate to protect his child. She was more important than his pride.
“This about the Avengers Initiative, isn’t it?” Steve asked.
“See ya, Rhodes," said Tony.
"Is everything all right, Maria?"
“Well, you’re not wrong,” said Tony. The love of his life was a technology, inept old man.
"We have to bring in an expert on genetics and neonatal studies. I'd recommend Dr. Edith Star. She fell off the grid a few years ago," said Bruce.
Piper nodded, going to the shelf to pick out a book. Tony sat in the hammock chair, waiting. She came back with a red book with a teddy bear on it,
“Tell the president, thank you. Who is the president?” he asked.
Steve dropped his paintbrush, hearing his phone ring. He wiped his paint-covered hands on his pants before answering it.
Chinstrap penguins - is a species of penguin which inhabits a variety of islands and shores in the Southern Pacific and the Antarctic Ocean. Its name derives from the narrow black band under its head, which makes it appear as if it were wearing a black helmet, making it easy to identify.
Phil tried teaching him how to use a cell phone, but he failed miserably. The lesson ended when his frustration got the best of him, and he accidentally crushed the cellular device. It wasn’t Phil’s fault. This phone was heavier in his hand. The buttons were large and had simple choices of yes or no.
“What are you doing?”
“The clean slate protocol?”
“Five more minutes.”
“How is our pup this morning?”
"Which is?"
“Will you have to go again?”
“How?”
“We have to get him to the jet,” said Clint.
Steve kept his eyes on the scepter, ready for a strike.
As soon as they got home, Tony went to the lab. Steve followed him. He took a seat on the lumpy couch.
"Better answer her."
“Yes,” said Steve.
Steve melted into the rhythm, winding his arms around Tony’s neck. Shivering when the alpha’s arousal pressed against his.
He returned with his friends. “What’s he like?”
“I can send them away,” said Phil.
"I don't know. Thor is busy in outer space. He has to take care of his people," said Steve.
“Yes, you don't remember.”
“I missed you too, Jarvis.”
“These don’t leave the room.”
“Are you?” The kid just him an innocent look. “Don’t worry about it I’ll fix it. What your name kid?”
"Yeah, I almost figured out when I was drunk. I'll get you better."
“What are you in the mood for?” asked Steve.
“Sure.”
“Where they take you from?”
The line went dead as his time ran out. Shelter and time was what he needed. A little further out he spotted a garage. It seemed to be abandoned. He pushed open the door, grabbed his suit and dragged it inside, dropping it onto the couch. It smelled of dust.
He cupped Tony's face in his hands. "It's okay to be scared, Tony. I was."
Tony nodded. An hour later they were on a private plane to New York. They slept the entire flight. When they got home they cuddled up in their nest. Steve struggled to get comfortable.
Piper hopped down from bed, going into the bathroom to wash her hands. Even though Winter's blood was gone, she could still smell it. The scent was everywhere. Once her nose caught the smell, there was no escaping it. She realized the scent was on her body, not only on her hands. She threw up into the sink. Winter was by her side.
Tony didn’t say anything but caressed his cheek. That touch said the words the alpha couldn't at the moment. Steve realized they were both standing naked in the middle of the penthouse. Steve went to the bedroom. He slid a pair of shorts on, not bothering with underwear. Tony would only tear them off him later. He grabbed a pair of shorts for Tony. He handed them to him. Tony shook his head. Having his alpha naked before him would only shorten the gap before his next wave hit.
"I thought he may treat you like a one night stand," she said.
*****
"We'll probably have to stay the night. Howard was a packrat," said Tony.
“Yet you do, Anthony.”
“Those poor parents,” said Gloria.
He pushed her head down, forcing her to stare at the ground. Piper bit back a whimper when he started sawing off her hair with the blade. Her eyes started watering. She wouldn’t cry. It was only hair, it would grow back.
"Not always."
“What not Goldie?” he said.
“You shouldn’t have done that.” Winter was shaky.
"Or you could tell more about this ring Tony got you."
“Sir, your necklace,” said the man.
"Before the serum."
“You’re only tempting me further. What’s happened since our before sunrise call?”
“Will I now?” he said.
“Only two more days," he whispered.
“Hi.”
Piper glared up at the camera.
“What mark is this?”
“That will take time. I like to say we’d hold it up, but I’m not sure.”
She pushed against him, trying to throw off his balance. He swung his arms around her, pinning her arm with his. She bared his teeth at him.
“Their behavior was predictable. You should have expected it everyone else did,” said Natasha.
“Bye sweetheart,” said Tony.
“You can’t tell, Tony. This is private,” said Steve.
“I had to be a part of this,” said Steve.
“Do you trust me?” he asked.
"Why do you call me, pumpkin? I'm not a cultivar of the squash family," she said.
Steve couldn’t believe Piper was already turning three. It felt like just yesterday she was taking her first steps. She was capable of such emotional complexity rivaling that of a teenager. Then, at the same time, she could have the naivety and childish behavior befitting her age. They’d tested her IQ when she was two. She’d earned a score of 180, breaking all previous records for someone in her age range.
(See the end of the chapter for
“You’re a fast learner. I appreciate that. It will make things easier in the long run. If you behave you'll find out I'm actually a reasonable man."
“Anthony, help me make some tea."
“He’s friendly?” asked Steve.
The pain faded off and on.
"A government agency, setting up two superheroes. It's a conspiracist’s dream. They’d claimed we were put together to make some super baby,” said Tony.
“And what about Sir?” asked Steve.
The alpha hugged him, scenting him heavily. It sent a pleasurable shiver down Steve's back.
be things he thought about now. It was useless. Winter returned to the small medical station. The pup was still asleep on the examination table but she looked unharmed.
“Shh, baby girl, it's alright," whispered Tony, gently caressing her face. She leaned into his touch.
Tony rose from bed. He caught his reflection in the mirror. His hair was a mess, and there were bags underneath his eyes. Last night and the earliest hours of the morning were spent tending to Steve.
Steve’s heart sped at the word love. Heat rose in his cheeks. He nearly yelped when Tony pinched his butt. Tony snickered.
Jarvis had pulled up the names of scientists working on similar projects, but their work didn't compare. It was basic and practical, limited by budget and not meant for warfare. The one that came closest was Rand Enterprises, but they were still testing prototypes. He had asked Natasha to check her more underground sources. They were currently waiting for her response.
His alpha’s pace was brutal, but exactly what he needed. Their release was hurtling toward them. Tony’s thrusts were becoming erratic, hitting climax as teeth sunk into Steve’s neck, setting off the omega’s release.
“A bullshit name given to by the doctor. Aren’t you going to ask why I’m here?”
“Stark."
"What is it?" asked Tony.
“Okay,” he said.
“No sigh of cardiac anomaly or unusual brain activity," said Jarvis.
“Don’t talk about him like he’s not in the room!”
“Might as well shut up, girl. You can’t do anything for him.”
"Run the face from the surveillance through recognition and buy those photos before they get printed," said Tony.
“How bad are we talking?” he asked.
“We’ll have a long talk about this when I get home.”
“Shh, you’ll get your bottle soon,” he said placing it in the warmer. The warmer binged. Tony tested it on his wrist, before offering it to her. She glared at it pushing it away. “Papa’s nipples are fantastic, but this will have to do."
“Tony in his lab?” asked Steve.
Their vacation couldn’t be more perfect. There was great food, great sex, and a great time. It was mid-April and Steve was enjoying the change into spring. He hadn't seen his alpha for three days. The man had locked himself away in his lab, giving him no clue to what he was working on. When asked the alway was vague or misdirected. Tony would likely make some big reveal of whatever it was.
