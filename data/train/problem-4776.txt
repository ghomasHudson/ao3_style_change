“I guess that means I can go back to Heaven,” he waited for the inevitable confirmation. Dean was okay, there was nothing left for him to fix here, no reason to stay.
When Dean got to Bobby’s cabin it was close to midnight, and he was ready to drop dead and sleep for a week straight. Even though Cas had healed his wounds, his muscles were still sore and his body felt like he’d been running marathons. Despite the few hours of sleep he got last night, he felt like he’d been awake for an entire month, and the bags under his eyes seemed to confirm this feeling.
If John Winchester felt surprised, he didn’t show it. Instead, he put down the knife and used an old rag to clean the blood off his hands.
There were three of them, they looked at him with wolflike grins and Dean felt adrenaline rush through his veins. Where had they come from and worse, how did they know he was here? But these questions didn’t matter right now, because now would be the time to fight for his life. He tightened the grip on his gun.
Dean shook the hefty lock in his hand, clearly irritated. “Can’t you just melt this off or something?”
Dean huffed into his hands, but couldn’t warm them. “C’mon Cas, why don’t you put this all away again, and come help me carry all the lumber inside?”
A note at the beginning this time, because I need to apologize for the delay. I'm so sorry this chapter took so long to upload, I would go into detail about my new job and my thesis deadlines closing in on me but those would sound like excuses! Nevertheless, I hope you will enjoy this chapter now that it's finally here :)
Instead, Dean just nodded, suddenly very aware of the flush that had risen up his neck and his cheeks.
, this was still a bad idea. And not to mention the fact that his dad would kill him. That thought ran through Dean’s mind a lot these days.
He drew a breath, and knocked, ignoring the way his heartbeat accelerated rapidly.
“If we want to be surrounded within seconds. The heat I would conjure is too strong Dean, I would probably melt the whole door off.”
“Your son was ambushed and barely made it out alive, you should try showing some concern.” Bobby’s voice was more of a low growl.
It was strange, how being this close to Castiel felt familiar yet absolutely thrilling at the same time. With every inhale he breathed in the scent of Cas’s skin, the warm smell ashy from the fireplace, and a freshness he couldn’t put his finger on - it was intrinsically Castiel’s own scent -  filling his nose, and intoxicating his brain. With his ear pressed to Cas’s chest, he could hear the rhythmic beating of his heart, and he didn’t know why he was surprised to find it beat just the same as his own. Maybe the thing that had always fascinated him the most, was that with his touch he could feel the angel’s warmth, the heat of his skin radiating and sending waves of electricity through his own. He thought back of the first time Cas had touched him, to heal him, and how baffled he had been at the warmth of his touch. Their hostile act seemed so long ago now, but it couldn’t have been more than a few months.
and he was sure he would probably be better off if he was doing it himself. Make them the way he liked it, and it wasn’t like he couldn't, he wasn’t
He had purposefully spent the last hour helping Ellen in the kitchen, a place he knew for certain he wouldn’t find his dad hanging around. They spent their time cooking in silence, Dean peeling the potatoes while Ellen was whisking away in the saucepan of barbeque sauce. It was oddly peaceful, only busying himself with a simple task like peeling a root vegetable instead of aiming for the best spot to kill a supernatural being.
Dean made his way over to the couch where Cas sat on. A quick glance at the book and he realized Cas was reading his (very worn out) copy of Cat’s Cradle, by Vonnegut. He felt his cheeks pink up and couldn’t help but smile a little.
He made his way through the hallway that led to the elevator, getting a few weird looks here and there. He was about to pass behind Rufus and decided to greet him.
“Right. So I think I don’t have any more pressing matters to discuss here,” Gabriel stated, snapping Castiel out of his thoughts. “A note for both of you, just stay put. Winchester, we still don’t know who’s feeding false intel and now weapons into your city, so you shouldn’t trust anyone. And Castiel, I have reason to believe we have a bull’s eye in our backs, so we should lay low.”
“What happened?” Sam blinked a few times as if he was trying to make something go away.
“If you say so. What are you gonna do about it? You can’t just keep sulking around the place, are you thinking of going for it, or pushing him out of your mind?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Only time will tell, I guess,” Dean concluded for her. “But I hope they make it, Bobby and your mom.”
“What prophecy?” He expected nothing else of Dean if not for him to be inquisitive. This was something Castiel had started to wonder about, started to tie bits and pieces over time, together.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Oh, grab us some beers while you’re at it.”
“The one I healed in the alley,” Castiel’s eyes found his. “You care a lot about him,” it wasn’t a question.
be here?”
transparent, or if Cas could read his mind or something.
“Here, you can keep the change,” he said, handing her a fifty dollar bill.
“It is,” Dean answered, almost in a whisper, but he wasn’t talking about the sky. In fact, he’d given up on watching the stars, and instead focused on the way Cas’ eyes shimmered, even in the dark, when talking about his little stars. They were so blue, and seemed to reflect the light cast by the moon. The lines that surrounded them made him think of the angel’s age, and even though he looked no older than Dean, while he knew Cas was thousands of years old - and in this moment, he felt almost honored to be here, sharing this moment with him.
By the time Dean got to parking the impala next to the cabin, he could already see a light on the inside. A sudden fear clouded his brain, that someone else was in there. He ran up the steps, purposefully leaving the duffel and the weapons in the trunk, and carefully peeked into the window, his fist loosely around the knife in his jeans. His wariness quickly took different turns, though, when he spotted Castiel.
“Castiel,” Dean called out into the cold air. Calling out a name to someone who wasn’t even within sight would never feel normal. Dean shivered as the wind brushed his shoulders, he should have brought a coat.
“Because they probably don’t want a couple of scruffy-looking guys snooping around?”
He had been trying to ignore these feelings, ever since they spent the entire night looking at the stars, when Dean had spent the whole time looking mostly at Cas and the way his face lit up every time he found a new constellation to talk about. And now that was all on the brink of being nothing but a distant memory.
Dean opened the door, breathing in the fresh air from the spacious hallway, rusty metal had never smelled better. They stood apart further than was probably necessary, but Dean didn’t mind putting a little more distance between him and the angel, allowing his body and mind to recover from the (too) close encounter.
Dean’s eyes spotted one small metal box, totally wrapped up in duct tape, with no indication as to what it was or where it was from. “Cas, check this out.”
“You'll see,” he hissed at Metatron before he disappeared again.
“Well, I think it would be a great idea to let more people in on all those little secrets you guys keep,” Dean said, crossing his arms.
His eyes never left Dean, didn’t bother blinking, afraid the seconds would tick by, faster and faster, until this was but a distant memory. Even if he knew what to say,
Eventually, even though Dean would be more than happy staying at Bobby’s for the rest of his life, he had to go home and face his father.
“When Mary died, you two became my responsibility, I’ve spent my whole life so far dedicated to protecting you. Making sure you were safe was my number one job. But, keeping you from having a normal life, that was a selfish act, from a man afraid to lose anything else.”
Castiel’s face turned unreadable, like a marble statue, and Dean decided he didn’t like it when that happened. He turned his eyes away, focusing on the open road instead.
They kept walking, and Dean’s mind adapted to this ‘new normal'. All non-essential shops had closed their doors, the big shopping windows covered to protect the glass, probably from shattering.
There was no way in hell that this hunt was a three-person job. There was no need for the three of them to stick together in this tiny cramped hallway. And there was definitely no fair answer as to why John hadn’t let Dean out of his sight for a single second.
“You called for me?” Uriel asked his leader.
“If only it were that easy,” Dean sighed, it probably wasn’t that easy to egg Heaven. He felt grateful for his younger brother’s feeble attempt at making him feel better, but he didn’t think it was working. This wasn’t a post-break-up funk as Sam had called it, this wasn’t a break-up at all. Maybe that’s why it felt so awful, because whatever this was, it was over before it even started.
he couldn’t.
“Fuck- goddamnit,” Dean cursed as he hit the ground, Castiel tried to stiffen a laugh at the discomposure before him, when he caught a glimpse of Dean’s grimace. He was actually in pain.
“Can you still hear them?” Dean asked, there was something in his voice that Castiel couldn’t quite place. Maybe Dean was just as uncomfortable as he was, however, their reasons for being uncomfortable were completely different, he knew that for Dean to stand like this, to feel so trapped with an angel must be unbearable, and for him, it was just excruciating, standing so close, feeling his body pulsing and palpitating with every time Dean’s body moved in the tiniest way, grazing against his, but one thing was certain, they both wanted to get out as fast as possible.
It was one afternoon when they were studying in Dean’s room, that Cas begun to vent his frustrations. It led to Dean doing the same and soon, their schoolwork was abandoned as the two boys got hot and heated about how unfair their lives were. It took a fair amount of ranting until Dean came up with a brilliant idea, the idea popping into his head like the switch of a lightbulb.
They arrive in Hellian two hours later, after having to walk a small portion of the trip.
mad and whether he just fucked up big time. But before he can go through his usual negative spiral of thoughts, Cas’ arms reach up and wrap around his waist.
Dean laughed as he passed the plate over the counter to her. “I’m sure you know by now there’s

“Castiel told me you were accepted into the University of Chicago, English major?”
he says,
Dean waits.
That night, they both sleep soundly.
They continued to banter for the rest of their lunch session and after that, conversations between them flowed easily. By the time Spring break rolled around, Dean felt that he could confidently call Cas his friend, considering most lunches now he spent talking to him. Charlie and Benny had obviously taken notice, continuously teasing him when Cas wasn’t around. They’d even roped his younger brother Sam in on it, so that he could never escape it.
Upon his arrival back from the fortress, Charlie had told him about what
Not just any music—
Cas’ resounding silence was like music to Dean’s ears.
Castiel looked out the window, wanting to groan at just how early it was. It was not even dawn yet, the sky still a dark, brooding grey. Dean must have noticed Castiel’s distaste, as he began to chuckle.
She scoffs. “Sorry? Are you serious? Dean, the least you could’ve done was let me know you were
Dean nodded, peeking his head up over the bench to look at the dish. “What are you making, Mom?”
“Well, you’re welcome, even though I was just stating the truth.” Meg said. “Besides Castiel, you really have nothing to worry about that.”
“Dean!” Pamela exclaims, jumping up from her seat. “Thank you for coming!”
Yet instead, Cas’ words make him feel like he’s been dunked in a bucket full of ice cold water. He feels himself sobering up almost instantly, the realisation of what Cas did piercing him in the chest.
She looks out to the side, “East of here, is a little village, one you used to be familiar with. Vale, it is called. Signs should point you to where it is, but make sure to follow the path. There is a woman named Missouri. At this point, I feel she will be expecting you. She will have answers for you that I cannot give.”
Claire signed, the smile on her face teasing. Dean rolled his eyes.
When the evening turned to night, Heaven began to cry.
Yet they were waiting for them, there were at least fifty there. The Nephilim stood tall and proud, like an army of soldiers. The blue light that Castiel had once observed shine from their eyes, was now deep and pure black. Castiel’s theory had been proven correct -- The Empty had taken them too.
It was the summer before Fourth Grade and for the first time that whole summer, Dean had woken up early. He practically bounded down the stairs and into the kitchen, where his mom was already up and baking for the day.
He stands up for a moment and stretches, his neck tense from hunching over the various pieces of paper. He wonders if he can just bundle these all up and take them home with him, instead of reading them all here and now. He can already feel the headache forming, the double-shot of caffeine not enough to cure the exhaustion from continuous months of travel.
from his side table to whack at the intruder. He was interrupted however, by the light of his room turning on.
Flashing him another large grin, Charlie turns around and exits the stable.
And that was Dean Winchester.
“Yes… I won’t bother you again. Sorry Dean… thanks.”
And Dean charges forward.
“What happened?” Sam asks.

that the common theory about soulmates is that if you’re unable to find yours before the day you turn 30, then you’re perceived negatively by others.”
Cas watched as Dean quickly glanced at the microwave clock, before looking back at Cas with a mischievous smirk.
“I am yours, as well,” Dean says, over the flower, as if the petals can absorb his words.
Claire replied.
“We will make this work. I want nothing more.”
Dean huffs. “Says you, Mr.
“Good evening traveller, did you have a safe trip?” She asks, her voice both bubbly, yet warm and inviting.
She asked.

Dean pushed those fears down and nudged Cas back.
Dean woke him up an hour later.

As he looked at her, he wondered if she knew. If she knew how much he envied her. Her abilities, her beauty, the lack of a burden on her shoulders. And especially, the special childhood bond she possessed with Dean.
wreaked havoc on the land, destroying everything in its path.”
Their lunches continued the same for a few weeks following and as the term began to near its end, it was obvious to everyone that there were underlying feelings. Well, that’s at least what Charlie had told Dean. He didn’t realise how transparent they were being. It took him a while to work up the courage, even with the encouragement from his friends. Yet when finals began to rapidly approach and Cas was preparing to travel home for the Summer, Dean knew he’d have to make his move soon.
“Excuse me,” Dean greets.
Castiel was nervous to say the least.
“No. Without being able to ask anyone on the inside, it’s really all up to speculation. And I have minimal theories.
Meg sends him a watery smile.
Except this time, their shower lasted
For the first time ever, Cas appeared to be at a loss for words.
“I am so sorry, your majesty.”
She remembered unlocking her car, ready to get in before she took one last look at Dean, who had his head buried in his hands. A sharp pain pierced her heart as she saw his shoulders begin to heave. Claire never saw Dean cry before… in fact she’d no idea he could. He always put up such a façade, the “I’m so tough” act. It seemed that it was what made him bottle up all those emotions and tonight, they were tumbling out.
“I have a feeling I may need it,” Castiel replied.
The man just smiles, showing all his teeth. “Now, what about your name?”
culinary school, way more then I loved my English course. Baking felt more natural and the more I learnt, the easier it became. I studied there for a few years, got my degree and then it was up to me to decide where I went from there. I headed up North and drove through Sioux Falls and I found myself staring up at a store which had gone bankrupt. I didn’t put any thought into it, just used the money my grandparents left me and bought it right there. And that’s where I’ve been ever since… here. I think I’ve only left to visit a few friends and Sam in San Francisco
“Ah, they haven’t told you about
Dean nods, pulling out his sword.
Cas’ laughter slowly died down so there was only a small smile on his face.
They had left their horses behind, abandoned near a stable. They had rode them from Mount Lazarus, until they had a safe passage down the hill and into the Grasslands. From there, they left their horses equipped with their bridles and saddles and bolted from the area, not looking back for a moment. He could imagine how hard that it must have been for Dean, to leave Impala behind without a second thought. Impala was Dean’s baby, as treasured to him as family. Castiel believed that Dean cherished Impala more, or to the same degree, as his parents. To have to say goodbye to him must have hurt the knight to his core.
The older man looked down at Dean and immediately, a welcoming grin formed on his lips. His blue eyes crinkled.
As he stood upon the hills of the Grasslands, he could see every stunning crevice of the island. With the castle as the centrepiece, the surrounding land was filled with luscious green grass, tall, leafy trees and a startling blue sky. Flowers in a variety of colours bloomed in patches across the island and streams of sparkling, clear water glittered in his view. He had no idea if it was the magic of the island, or the pure magic of creation that made the island his way, but to Castiel -- it was a place he was proud to call home.
Cas just smiled. “When I met you, of course.”
Cas tagged along as Dean met up with Aaron, Charlie and Gilda. His group was inconsolable and Dean did his best to comfort them. At first, he hadn’t seen Kevin--so he truly believed that Kevin did pass on to a better place. It was what the mantra kept repeating—reminding them when they found the pain and mourning tough to bear.
“You see, there is a reason that I don’t have many friends back at Vale Village,” she states, “I… I wasn’t well liked by some of my peers, because I have different beliefs to them.”
His friend lifting his head up stopped him. He angled his body towards Dean and sighed.
Over the weekend, Cas attempted to come over but every time, Dean refused to see him. Mary tried to get him to let Cas in, but Dean being as stubborn as he was, declined each time. He was furious at Castiel, more so than he had ever been before. He knew it was something immature to get upset about, the fact his best friend didn’t hang out with him for one night. But to Dean, it was the principle of the situation. Cas hadn’t even bothered to send a message and let Dean know he wasn’t going to make it. The two had rarely seen each other and Dean had looked forward to that night more than ever. And Cas had just bailed without even a sorry.
“She’s alive.” Someone confirms for him,
He asked Dean.
They exchange another look, an identical frown forming on both of their faces.
However, reality was quick to come crashing down on him like a ton of bricks. He realised that this wasn’t for him—the reserved café, the elegant dinner, the flowers—even the music. It was all for Meg; Meg who happened to be Cas’ girlfriend. The girlfriend that Cas really wanted to spend Valentine’s Day with.
He turned around quickly, eyes wide as he took the sight of the boy in front of him. He knew who he was, of course, he had known Dean practically his whole life. Though, he had never spoken to him, as most citizens were not welcomed into the castle. They were only allowed in the kingdom’s village, which was located just outside the castle’s walls. However, the kingdom’s gardens were open to most people within the village, including the knight’s son.
going to happen, I’m going to attack. Jump them when they least expect it. Once I do, I’m going to…”
Their whole lives, the family attended church regularly and basked in the true traditions of their Christianity. All their rituals, the small things they did on a weekly to annual basis, were all set by Castiel’s parents—from the first year of Michael’s life. Even after they died, the traditions continued to live on.
The faery did not wait for Castiel to reply and instead flapped her wings, soaring straight up into the air. For a moment, he watched her fly up towards the fortress, her wings gleaming in the sunlight. Then, he turned to Dean who was already staring at him, waiting for their next move.
He heard Dean’s voice almost immediately, loud and croaky and husky from sleep.
When he’s done, he places the glass down and turns to face Dean again.
“I swear, he hates me.”
She smiles softly.
Dean winces. “Sorry dude, that’s gotta suck.”
So instead of the no, he voices something instead.
Dean was surprised that Cas began to smile.
I want to stay in touch. We have no doubt made a connection, and I wouldn’t want to give that up. I don’t think this friendship is ending anytime soon.”
“I just want you to know that no matter what happens with your power, you’ve always got me.”
He got out of the car and began to head inside, planning to ignore whatever was going on. That was until he noticed three things. One, that his neighbour was shaking his head repeatedly and pointing to his ears. Second, that he had his phone open on a notes app and was shoving it towards the enraged stranger, who was refusing to take it. Three, the neighbour making eye contact with him and sending him a look of clear desperation.
“Yes,” Dean replies, “and I plan to fix every single one.”

“Say hi to Dean for me, will you? Tell him we all really miss him.” Missouri said.
So he cozies up on Pam’s couch with his now lukewarm cup of coffee. The letters are from fans all over the world, from Italy, to Hong Kong, to New Zealand. The ages of his fans range too, but that’s something Dean already knew. He reads one letter from a twenty-five year old fan, and the next from a fourteen-year-old. Most of them are female, which again Dean isn’t surprised by. By the time he’s onto his seventh letter, which has a little cartoon picture of his stage-self attached, Pam interrupts with a slight groan.
him. Their Friday nights together had been in place since the 3
Cas frowned at the notifications, curious as to why Dean would call him at that time. It was late, being one in the morning and it was even later for Dean, who was an hour ahead. He wondered if maybe Dean had forgotten that he wasn’t supposed to call Cas that night, or maybe it was just a drunken dial? Cas was who Dean regularly called when drunk, spouting muffled and slurred sentences about love and honesty and friendship before either passing out in the street, or being rescued by Cas. Most of the time, Cas was far too concerned with helping Dean than to pay attention to what he was actually saying.
He takes a deep breath in.
His concerns forgotten, Dean’s smile radiated.
Castiel groaned quietly and, begrudgingly, pulled himself from Dean’s arms. If it were not for his duty to the kingdom and prophecy, he would have stayed there with Dean. He would have faced the wrath of his mother and the conflict within the kingdom, just to spend some more time in bed with the man he loved more than anything. Yet, he knew lives were at stake, and it was important that he attempted to save them.
The man beams and immediately sits himself down, placing his own duffle off to the side.
When Cas went to sleep that night, he had a cute boy’s phone number and a date for Friday night. It surprised him how quickly everything had switched on him. How that morning, he’d believed that his neighbour was a self-centred asshole. And now? Cas just hoped he’d catch a glimpse of him when he woke up.
They’re both silent for a moment, a tension lingering between them, before they both open their mouths to speak.
to go and stop that fortress from being a nuisance…” The man says. “I heard that, right?
Twitter: thatpeculiarone
“That is what confuses me.” Dean states. “Look you knew me once upon a time. Tell me. Why do I feel such an urge to do this? It’s like… deep inside of me. Why do I feel the need to fight… all for a prince I barely know. Why?”
He turned back to Cas, who was staring at Dean with a soft expression. It was then that Dean pulled him back in again. He didn't want the moment to end, despite the fact that the fireworks had reached their finale. They pulled away again as the fireworks dissipated, the people around them roaring in applause. Dean and Cas just stared at each other, giggling as they began clapping with the rest of the crowd.
“Yes,” Cas breathes out. Dean smiles.
Dean nods.
She looks at him with a pleading look and for some reason, Dean thinks that it looks strange on her face, as if this woman has never had to plead with anyone before.
“I am glad to hear that,” MIssouri says, “but it still doesn’t reassure me. Dean, I have to ask you honestly, how comfortable do you feel with Charlie coming along to accompany you? Do you feel that in the end, both of you will return home safely?”
Dean takes a moment to observe, looking at the knight with a more determined gaze. As he stares at it, it is already clear to him what he sees. The sword sits there, within the stone, and it is
Cas just shrugged.
As fate would have it, everything was
run off all by yourself. You hear me?”
Cas waited a moment, knocked again and continued to wait. After a couple of minutes, he realised that no one was coming. The man inside
Ever since the first day of 1
Well, he can’t remember all of it. He doesn’t remember the drive to school, or holding his mom’s hand, or the first moment he was introduced to the peers that he’d eventually complete the remainder of his schooling with. He doesn’t even remember his mom saying goodbye to him as class began.
“If it isn’t my favorite brother.”
“No fucking way. Plus, Cas is going and I can’t be worrying about you two at the same time.”
He’d never heard anything quite so powerful, quite so vulnerable. It was enthralling and heartbreaking all at the same time. And if it wasn’t so damn sad, Dean was sure he would be jumping out of his own body with happiness.
“- run some errands''. He really needed to start coming up with better excuses. “Anyway, my dad isn’t too big on the whole angel thing, as you might have guessed, and he's getting suspicious because I keep disappearing.” Dean wasn’t sure this was going well. “I mean, I don’t think he knows I’m out, hanging with some angel, that's for sure, but now he thinks there’s some chick involved and I don’t know what else to tell him. Anyhow, I don’t know when I’ll be able to leave his sight for the next few days, just thought I’d let you know” He opened his eyes again, it didn’t make sense but he could almost feel someone watching him “So, this is it. I guess I’m done?” A smile opened up a little, heat rising to his cheeks.
“Don’t worry about me, just take a shower,”
“Cas, goddammit man, I thought-” Dean almost flung his whole body forward to hug the angel, but managed to refrain. “Where have you been?”
The time for reasoning and arguing with his dad was long past them. Dean pulled his arm back and punched as hard as he could, his fist hitting John’s cheek, but it hit too far up and he completely missed the jaw, which could have knocked him out in one go. His knuckle burned in pain, and before he could pull his arm back again, a tremendous wave of pain spread through his thigh as his father’s boot crashed into his leg. Dean lost his balance and immediately John was atop of him, slamming his fists down, one after the other, not a moment’s worth of hesitation while he beat his firstborn’s face into a bloody pulp.
His head was still between his knees, and he just focused on Cas’s breathing, felt the heat coming off his palm against his arm, and used it to ground himself. Dean was grateful for the quiet, that Cas didn’t feel the need to try to talk him through it, just his presence seemed to be enough to soothe him at the moment.
“Angel blades,” Castiel finished for him. “It’s the only thing capable of killing an angel.”
How two people declaring their love for each other could be so ill-fated, he didn’t know, but the whole thing felt inevitably tragic, Dean thought.
“How do you even capture an angel?” Dean asked, trying to sound as nonchalant as possible.
Dean sighed. “Well, one minute I was walking by myself, and then next thing I know I was playing tag with a bunch of bloodthirsty wolfs.”
“Dean, what happened?” Castiel wrapped his arms protectively around Dean.
Castiel didn’t reply.
“A bubble bath” Dean repeated - this was not what he had expected.
He told himself this had nothing to do with Cas, that this was nothing more than curiosity, something important to learn about angels in general. But deep down he knew that was a lie, even though he had no idea what answer he was hoping for. If angels weren’t able to feel things, like humans, there was nothing he could do, and might as well just befriend a rock; on the other hand, if they were, in fact, able to reciprocate certain feelings, well then, that just made him feel like crap because it’d mean that Cas could feel the same way Dean did, he just didn’t - and that possibility hurt like a son of a bitch.
The most profound thoughts came late at night, maybe that was why he’d made a habit of staying up so late. It was almost as if his mind unfolded with the night, and he could let himself think about the things he tried so hard to ignore during the day. With all that was going on, Dean almost felt guilty for letting his mind drift into anything that didn’t revolve around the looming war.
“Thank you,” He muttered, standing only a few inches away from Dean, who could feel the steam emanating from the body in front of him. Castiel’s eyes studied his, and he tried to match the angel’s stare, but it was proving hard to do - his eyes darting from Cas’s eyes to his mouth, to his neck and then his collarbone, Dean’s lips parted ever so slightly. There was a flash of shiny metal that caught Dean’s eye, he had never seen it around Castiel’s neck before. It appeared to be a simple amulet, from the metal chain dangled a clear crystal. Dean would wonder about it if he wasn’t occupied by
It screamed in anger, drowning the sound of its sizzling flesh.
Gabriel nodded profusely.
Dean laughed, whole-heartedly “What don’t you have on your face?” Cas’s face had bits of mustard and mayo all around his lips, and Dean had to refrain from the weird impulse he had to reach over and wipe it away with his thumb.
“What, I can’t get a goddamn drink without a babysitter anymore?”
“Yeah, that was kind of the whole point of the notes,” Dean sighed in frustration, trying hard to swallow down his anger because he really didn’t want to do this today. “You’re okay, I guess that’s all that matters-,”
He heard a faint knock followed by a familiar voice, “boys!”
“This is bull, don't say I never warned y'all,” Bobby grunted under his breath.
“Have a seat,” Metatron stood as if he was looking out of a window, but there was nothing but blank walls -
“You think he’s paranoid?” Dean squinted at her over his beer, “Because, I can count in just one hand the number of times he’s been wrong.” He raised his eyebrows.
Dean scoffed. “What do you know about putting Sam in danger huh?” Oh, he should not have gone there, in fact, he regretted the words the minute they fell out of his mouth, but alas, it was too late, he might as well finish his point “You’re never around, you just show up, yell to me about protecting him, which I already goddamn do, and leave again!”
“It wasn’t me at the lake, I haven’t visited lake Lacua in months.”
“Can you still hear them?”
Dean had held on to so many questions these past few months, that now, he wasn’t sure what to ask first.
“Dad!” Dean stuffed his lockpick into the back of his jeans in record time. Oh, he was in deep shit and he knew it. “I was just trying to-”
Dean was surprised to find the information had already spread through so many people even Steve whatshisname knew about it. However, he was even more surprised to find Sam just nodding in agreement, lips pursed and his brow furrowed.
Joshua didn’t smile.
him to do it. He briefly wondered if his dad would notice that the bruises and cuts were all gone, but he wasn’t planning on seeing him for the next few weeks at least, so, what the hell.
He followed the sound and looked at Cas, who had been imitating him. It had to be right where he was standing, there was a hollow sound that echoed beneath them. Cas smiled, briefly, and Dean ran over to where he was and got on his knees, using his hands to clear away the dirt from the cardboard that covered the latch.
“If I’m
“Well that’s convenient, I just took the rest of the day off. I can-”
Without warning the front door swung open, revealing John Winchester. His face was turned into a grimace, but Dean could see the anger in his eyes.
“You might want to go inside. You probably won’t want to see this.”
to get a grip, this was pathetic.
“There is a prophecy--”
Seeing Cas like this, barely holding it together despite the reputable front he was trying to keep up was weird for Dean, he wasn’t used to being on this side of the meltdown - although he had to admit, Cas was yet to reach the same melting point as Dean had, so he was still pretty ahead on the whole humiliating himself front.
“Yeah, okay, that works,” Dean tried hard not to seem impressed by the fact that Castiel just snapped a steel lock with his bare hands as if it was built from legos.
“Yeah, sure,” Dean would have done pretty much anything as long as it meant getting out of that room before John exploded. A quick glance at his dad confirmed his thought, John’s face looked whitehot in anger and Dean knew all too well what would happen if it was just them in the room. So he quickly followed Curt out of the office, they didn’t stop walking until they were standing outside, the lights of the street lanterns illuminating both of their features.
Dean reached the gate, his whole body was protesting but he was so close. Just a few more steps before he could disappear into the woods behind the walls, and yell his lungs out. He’d call for Castiel, angel of the Lord, and he couldn’t care less if anyone heard him. He just needed to know that Cas was okay. He could see the gate now, only a few feet away, and the whole time something kept repeating in his mind
“But now,” Bobby dragged the last word out, “that I’ve thought this through, and come to terms with it, I can tell you I’m proud of you.” Bobby’s palm made a god-awful sound slapping against the back of his neck, and if Dean didn’t know it was well-intended, he’d have cursed. “Even if you’re still an idiot for screwing around with an angel,” Bobby mumbled under his breath as he turned away.
“Dean,” he heard Cas’s voice, low and raspy, but it was there. He opened his eyes, still not letting go of the amulet. It was glowing now, bright and blue through his fingers. Almost as blue as the eyes looking up at him. “Dean,” Cas repeated, “I’m okay.” A soft exhale from him made Dean realize he wasn’t breathing himself.
The five remaining angels' expressions turned from horrified to outraged, ready to unleash their anger on the group of hunters.
’. And maybe he was right, but at the moment Dean’s mind couldn’t quite figure out
“Chile” Sam answered Dean’s look. “From what Bobby could dig up in the Command Centre, the actual location is classified,
“I got ambushed,” Dean said, feeling partially guilty.
“Sorry,” the werewolf didn’t sound sorry in the slightest. “Not allowed to tell you that.”
He was going to die.
“Oh, he did?” Jo definitely knew he was lying.
Dean obliged, knowing how bright Castiel’s grace would light up the cabin in a few seconds. It was a good thing that it wasn’t dark yet outside, because the less attention they drew to themselves the better.
On the way to the cabin, Dean wondered what he’d write down on the note. Was Cas expecting him to tell him about the conversation? Dean knew he was, but maybe he’d just meant for Dean to tell him if it went good or bad, he was probably not all that interested in the very unsettling chick-flick moment his dad had gone through with him. His grip tightened around the steering wheel. He’d told Sam and Bobby about John’s quasi-melt-down and they were as stunned as he had been. They could all agree it seemed to be some sort of breakthrough, some sort of softening, something had finally given -
Castiel’s expression softens, so much that it practically crumbles, “Dean.
(See the end of the chapter for
Together, they looked over at Dean, who had begun walking over to them with the other champions. He glanced back at Meg quickly, who shot him a wink. He felt the blood rush to his cheeks.
How miserable would his life be?
He walked with a determination, only feeling himself stop as he began to pass the war memorials. He felt his pace slow down and an overwhelming sense of fear and anxiety weigh on his chest. He felt his mind flicker as the vivid images of his nightmares flashed to his mind. He tried to shake them off as he practically raced home and away from the college. Yet, the sounds of men’s screams still continued to echo in his ears long aftr.
“You spent the last almost-eight hours telling me your life story. Can’t blame a girl for being curious about the aftermath.”
“You knew all night?” He asks, to which Cas nods. “Why didn’t you say anything?”
Charlie shrugs, “Hey, I didn’t make up the story.”
He looks up to see Cas’ glassy eyes and he already knows what this all means. But he has to confirm it, have all the evidence to back up the thought that is replaying in Dean’s mind like a broken record.
Cas laughed and rolled his eyes, “If I wanted to ‘score points’ with you, I’d tell you about how my dad has exclusive VIP membership to the Field Museum…”
of sugar, the two of them are finally able to retire to their bedroom.
“Wait… you said that you remember your horse, Impala? Does that mean you’ve remembered something?”
He felt his body begin to shake slightly, but he attempted to bid it still. He did not need to appear weak in front of the prophet, to make it seem as if he were not worth being centered in the prophecy. He gulped -- gulped down the pain and fear -- and attempted to rid the evil thoughts from his mind. He prayed that her words were not a bad omen, a sign of what he was imagining.
Dean explained that birthdays were a sacred affair in his home village of Vale. Every birthday was celebrated and cherished, as it was a special day when someone was able to live another year. Dean explained how twenty-first birthdays were among the most celebrated, as they symbolised a new journey in life.
Dean was silent for a moment and was just staring at Cas with startled eyes. At first, Cas had been worried that Dean was going to reject the idea outright. Instead, Cas was tackled backwards into the couch as warm lips met his.
“Laugh it up bitch. At least I’m the big college kid and you’re just a high school freshman” Dean spoke, signing along as he did so.
“Come in.”
Hester took the bait and gave him a stiff smile.
Eventually, they stumble across a camp along the path. The monsters are a mix, both werewolf and vampires. Despite the fact that they are holding torches, they both take the monsters out in a clean sweep, their bodies left rotting on the ground as they continue onwards. Charlie’s skills with a sword never cease to impress him, how mighty and fierce she is. She’s a girl who lost her parents and who has had her peers turn against her. He wonders if that is what fuels her fight, makes her as strong and determined as she is.
them. He’s been unwanted for so long in his life, that it’s hard to imagine Cas truly wants to be with him. Especially after Dean left him.
Cas was going places, having been accepted into five of the eight ivy league colleges. Dean had been there each time Cas had gotten an envelope—it had started out with Yale and then Harvard, followed by Dartmouth and Cornell before finishing with the University of Pennsylvania. Although Cas hadn’t been accepted into the other three nor Stanford, he hadn’t cared. Neither did Dean, he just unbelievably impressed. And proud.
Jess smiles, “Because we would’ve threatened you until you told us anyways. Now shut up, and eat your soggy burger.”
Cas remains calm, crossing his arms. “Is there a problem, Jimmy?”
Which was why a few months into the semester, it wasn’t unusual for Aaron to invite him out. Dean, sick of his current assignment, agreed to go and began to get ready. When his roommate left, Dean remembered asking Cas if he wanted to come. Cas of course, did not.
“We have pretty much learned all we can about the Nephilims,” he continued on, “and we have an extensive knowledge of the fortresses. At this point, we are well equipped for The Empty’s return.”
to be a father. But yet, you have no idea what you’re going to do?”
old home. Apparently, Missouri had made sure that no one occupied it since his parent’s death, knowing that Dean would once again return to reclaim it. However, the thought of staying in a house that he couldn’t remember, made him feel uncomfortable. Thus, he decided that the inn would be the best place to stay.
Once lunch came to an end, all of them headed back to the dormitories to say the dreaded goodbyes. Dean was crushed in a hug by his mother as she tried not to weep too loudly into his shoulder. He was given a small hug by his father, who slipped a cheque for $200 into his hand. Michael and Duma both gave him small hugs, making him promise to look out for himself and Cas. And finally, he said an emotional goodbye to his brother—the both of them attempting not to cry.
Using that small ounce of confidence, he finally takes note of his surroundings, looking down at where he has been lying.
They sat down at the table with the muffins and some coffee as they dived into stories about Dean. Claire mentioned how she visited him weekly, since he was the only one she knew who was fluent in sign language. Of course, she didn’t tell Mary too much about the stories—knowing that it would probably cause a bigger mess than necessary. Instead she talked about how much she loved Dean’s baking—and how Mary had did a wonderful job teaching him.
“Claire?”
Dean always knew something was wrong when Cas wouldn’t walk home with him.
“You didn’t tell me because you wanted to test a theory, wanted to see if our bond was
PROFESSOR C. NOVAK
His friends were sitting at a table at the other end of the cafeteria, the one that they usually found themselves sitting at during their lunch break. While it was reminiscent of their high school lunches, it was also different with the addition of two new members to their group.
Dean grinned, the earlier tension in his features completely erased.
grade, the toughness and difficulty of school had worn him out. Being currently in the midst of 2
Cas smiled softly.
Cas signed while attempting to swallow his food.
Cas snapped his gaze up and it’s almost as if Dean’s words had lit a fire.
Dean’s parents were the first to arrive, greeting both Dean and Cas with warm hugs. Cas had met them earlier that year at Dean’s birthday dinner in January, and only saw them again recently at Christmas dinner. Dean’s parents had been nothing but kind and friendly to him, accepting him as Dean’s partner almost immediately. However, he knew Dean’s past with his parents was rocky at best. While they had raised Dean while learning sign language to communicate with him, they failed in learning more about Deaf culture. There were multiple times in his childhood where Dean felt as if he were an outcast in his family; either by being left out of spoken conversations, or having to face situations where he was told off for being too loud, something he had no ability to control. Their relationship deteriorated over the years, coming to a screaming halt when Dean came out as bisexual. After a vicious fight with his father, Dean didn’t speak to his parents for two years.
As he walked over to grab his coffee, Sam’s laughter trailed behind him.
With a smile of his own, Castiel kept driving.
He lived in a continuously changing world, where science and technology grew and adapted, forever expanding like the very universe the Earth was a part of. Being a teacher, change was constant, from the new forms of IT being brought into the classroom to the fancy new educational theories being taught at seminars. And don’t get him started on the curriculum, that changed almost everyday.
The word sacrifice made Castiel’s stomach churn. He thought about Dean and he thought about Mary’s words. His brain procured an image, a vile nightmare where he saw the life fade from his friend’s eyes. Those beautiful green eyes of his becoming cold and dim. The thought constricted him, began to suffocate him, clouded his mind with feelings of fear and anxiety.
With grief choking his lungs, Dean brought his hands up to sign.
“Ready?” He asks Charlie.
He wanted to — so badly did he want to fall asleep. He knew that if he were able to he would fall off in a heartbeat. He hadn’t been this comfortable in a long time — the bed was so warm and so inviting, with pillows that smelled of apple shampoo and the lingering scent of aftershave. In a weird and strange way, he wanted to bury his head in them.
“Hello Castiel.”
By the time they got halfway through the episode, they had finished their donuts and tossed the empty box onto the coffee table. Dean lay his head against the armrest, his back on the cushions, before pulling Cas down with him, so that he was resting his own head on Dean’s chest. They laid like that over the course of a couple of episodes, with Dean switching between running his hand through Cas’ hair and rubbing circles into his back.
"I didn't even-" Dean lifted his eyebrows but decided there was no use in arguing.
“Right,” she took a breath. “Remember how my mom and Bobby kept fighting over him being a paranoid son of a bitch?” She waited for Dean’s nod before continuing. “Well, I like Bobby, you know? The house hasn't felt so full in a very long time, and I just like having him around, he makes my mom happy-”
“Are you going to answer me or not?” Dean pressed, pretending to sound at least equally as threatening.
“Is that what you think of me?” Disbelief dripped from his voice, and he hoped Castiel could hear through those words he was actually saying. “I would
“No.” Fuck, that must have been the weakest lie to ever come out of Dean’s mouth.
“Why the hell would I get stuck in the vents?” Dean’s voice rose to an embarrassing pitch.
“And you care about this, why?” Dean asked suspiciously. “I mean, why go through all this trouble to heal a human? ”
“Very impressive,” Uriel laughed mockingly, “get him.” As little monkeys working for bananas the angels started to charge at him, and soon enough there was no way of escaping. Gabriel had no way of fighting all of them off, he was being hauled somewhere, probably only for Metatron to kill him.
“Oh, wow” It was incredible, and Dean couldn't understand how he’d failed to see it at first, it was clear as day. “What else is up there?” He sat back up, and Cas looked amused, like watching a kid that couldn’t stand still, and sat back up with him.
Dean tried to focus on what Cas was saying while attempting the (apparently much more complicated when being watched) task of getting his boxers on under the towel.
Dean rolled his eyes, he got the feeling the angel would never understand sarcasm.
When Dean opened the door it was everything he had expected it to be. A large leather couch framed three of the velvet-covered walls and in the middle was another pole. The ceiling was decorated with large mirrors and a disco ball, and the lighting made the room glow red, Dean smirked at the sight.
, or, you know what I mean. What’s with this dude that’s got you so gone on him, huh?”
The enemy got up and a whistle escaped its lips.
“Militarization?” Was it really that bad? The city was basically a ghost town, sure, but Dean hadn’t seen any military-grade equipment in the streets. Was that what the trucks were carrying? What kind of military gear could even work on angels? He gave it another minute of thinking and reached the more logical conclusion that it was probably food, nonperishables, and such, they were probably expecting a siege around the city, considering angels couldn’t breach the warding.
Dean had gotten in late the night before, everyone already asleep as he’d made his way to his bedroom, and closed himself in the bathroom, he was in dire need of a shower, to wash away all the events of the day. Then he’d made his way to bed, trying to fall asleep not replaying the seconds he’d spent at a finger's length of Cas - to no use.
Cas looked at him with uncertainty, but grateful. He waited as Dean took the safety off his handgun and pointed it at the lock. If he couldn’t break it, maybe it would break the warding. They couldn’t see it, but it had to be drawn on, somewhere, right?
Once he felt the hot water run over his back he couldn’t help but let out a relieved sigh. He let the warmth relax his muscles, closing his eyes as the water ran across his face, washing away the trace of any tears.
These thoughts faded as he drifted off again, letting his head fall to rest against the back of the couch. In his dreams he found himself trying to get away from a group of sharks, their deadly sharp teeth were threatening enough to make the hairs on the back of his neck stand up, but there was something captivating about them too. Suddenly he found himself chasing the sharks, trying to desperately figure out what could possibly be alluring about them, but no matter how hard he tried, he never managed to get close to them. He woke up, startled by Bobby’s angry tone, and he realized he’d actually slept for one or two hours, as the sun was starting to come up.
“No, the same old again, that Curt Hunter guy.” Sam corrected.
There was another sentence written on the paper, but it had been completely crossed out so it was impossible to read, Castiel wondered briefly what other important information Dean had meant to write on the note. He tucked the note back into the book, not wanting to risk carrying the note into Heaven later.
“Dean,” he felt Cas' whisper against mouth, and the way the angel said his name made him weak.
With Michael imprisoned, Lucifer in the cage, Raphael in no shape to lead any armies, Gabriel was the logical choice as a new leader - except he wanted nothing of the sort. Castiel just wished his brother would step up, and reveal to all their brothers and sisters, who Metatron really was and have them choose to follow him. He hated this plan, going behind everyone’s back - he knew it was the right thing to do, yes, but every fiber in his being seemed to burn with uncertainty.
, Dean knew that
“Dean-” Sam’s low-pitched, urgent tone got through to him, “what’s going on? Where are you going?”
“Yes, that’s true,” Cas replied matter of factly. “What do you want to know, Dean?”
Once again thank you so much for reading this chapter and sticking with this story. Please let me know your thoughts on this chapter, I honestly love reading your comments, they highlight my days.  And don't worry, the next chapters will have some more action going on!
The sound of a car pulling up to the driveway disrupted his thoughts, and he saw Sam sit up straighter on the couch, from the corner of his eye.
Dean had countered all of their arguments, but he was sure they were right. He just didn’t want to drag Bobby into something that could ruin him.
“That being said,” Curt continued, “all the other angels are trained soldiers, meant to follow a powerful leader into battle. They’re not made to think on their own, they don’t experience emotions like humans so they can be absolutely relentless.”
“Absolutely not,” John turned back to cleaning his shotgun.
“Calm down macho man, I won’t tell anyone about your secret lover.”
“But you're not going to answer my questions either, am I right?” Dean felt like he was stalling, he was trying to think of something - anything better than letting the angel get away.
“No Uriel has never expressed desire towards Metatron,” Castiel said.
"Don't." Castiel's strict voice ordered.
“Thank you, sir,” Uriel said. “I won’t let you down this time.”
“You were in the shower,” Castiel shrugged, it wasn’t a big deal to him, he had barely been gone for ten minutes. “I called out to tell you but you must’ve not heard me.”
“Well, luck doesn’t get you far in this world, son. I can tell you that for free.”
He let himself sit down on the porch’s steps. He didn’t have time to be analyzing feelings and shit. He shook his head, feeling ridiculous. A whole war was about to go down, he had to man up and do the most important thing in his little life, to date, and here he was, sitting in the woods, feeling sorry for himself because an actual angel didn’t like him back.
The angel screwed his eyes shut for just a second. There was that hint of emotion again, it looked strange on his face, foreign even.
The more he thought about the state of things, the more wrong it all felt -  angels plotting against humanity, hunters imprisoning an archangel, his brothers plotting against each other, and Castiel?
loud sound of their fingers brushing together as their bodies moved, way too close than was really necessary. Castiel knew it wasn’t logical for brushing of skin against the skin to make any sort of perceptible sound,
It reminded him of camping.
This didn’t happen to him,
He checked his watch -
It wasn’t until Castiel shifted uncomfortably that Dean realized he was staring. Full-on mouth wide open staring in awe at his wings.
it, and he knew that it was wrong, he knew that he had to fight it with all his strength. This wasn’t how angels were supposed to be.
“Is it true?” Dean blurted out. He’d mean to keep his anger at bay, giving Castiel a chance to speak, but it got the best of him. Well so much for giving him the benefit of the doubt.
Before Dean had time to process anything, let alone answer him, he just stared at his old man’s back as he walked away from them both, slamming the front door on the way out.
The angel shuffled on his feet and Dean finally dared to look up, if he didn’t know any better he’d say the angel looked uncomfortable.
The angel looked somewhat confused before it spoke again. “Why did you call on me?”
“Thanks, Cas. You know you didn’t have to do this.” Dean reached out to grab the bowl and chopsticks Cas had brought, and for a moment he felt kinda bad, wondering what Cas had been doing before he’d accidentally asked him to come. He was probably doing things in Heaven, which was very likely much more important than this, but here he was, tending to Dean like he was a baby pigeon with a broken wing.
“C’mon Bobby, it’s me, you know you can tell me!”
“Are you having a stroke, dear?” Gabriel’s joke fell flat, he knew what it was, Dean’s eyes were widening as he understood what he was saying.
They ate in complete silence. Dean couldn’t help feeling nervous, he was hoping his dad wouldn’t ask him any questions, like where he’d been when he was away. Iit was one thing to explain to Bobby and Sam he couldn’t tell them everything, they’d respected his judgment, but that definitely wouldn’t fly with his dad. His mind was completely blank of any small talk, he scrambled to think of anything to distract his dad.
Dean couldn’t help a small laugh escaping his throat, “Not the whole city, at least I don’t think so.” He raised his eyebrows, wondering how every hunter in the city could possibly be bothered enough to care. “Sammy knew from the start, I guess we could only watch so many Mickey Roarke movies ‘for the plot’ before he made me. And he was chill about it. My dad, that’s a whole other thing, and I honestly have no idea if he knows and pretends he doesn’t, or if he’s just that thick.”  Cas pouted a little and Dean didn’t want him to feel bad about this, so he just kept going,
– to press Cas against his own chest.
? Dean wanted to voice his suspicion, he wanted to threaten Castiel and make the angel spill every secret it was holding onto.
“That’s… something.” Dean didn’t know what to say, because really, what was there to say? What do you say to someone who is older than anything you have ever touched, or maybe even heard of?
“And Luke?” Dean’s face twitched, incredulous. He didn’t even want to picture it.
“So you believe me, all this?”
“I’ve felt human emotions my whole life, and, hell, it still scares the shit out of me.” He said, anyway.
Hunter’s City’s streets were an especially stirring and vibrant affair today. Groups of hunters started to gather at the command center in the city center, and the streets were filled with people making their way to what they heard could be an important meeting involving their fight against the angels.
He cleared his throat, calling attention to himself.
“Fuck, Cas, I want you to do whatever the fuck you want to do. And if that’s leaving, goddamn leave, then!”
Dean didn’t realize tears were still streaming down his face until Castiel gently wiped one away with his finger, his eyes still concerned but a comforting smile on his lips.
there had been none of that -
A new chapter, and it's only a few days later than normal! But it's a long one so I hope that makes up for it, if anyone was keeping track in the first place. I have to thank my amazing new friend and beta, Fred, for her amazing work on this chapter.
“Salted and burned,” Sam replied.
“I need some help here,” he cleared his throat, “Cas-”
And the longer Sam stayed silent, the more he looked like he knew exactly what Dean had left out.
“ I- Yes.” One word, three little letters, and Dean’s entire being was set afire. He wasn’t an idiot, Cas had made it a point that he was speaking for himself. And of course, he could still be talking about some other moment in his life -
“Yeah, I think Bobby and Ellen are kinda making it official.” Sam stuck his tongue and made a gagging noise, like kids used to make disgusted faces at adults kissing. Dean laughed and wrinkled his nose understandingly - he was all for Bobby being happy, but he did not want to get those mental pictures stuck on his brain.
“Not really, no.”
“Michael’s grace.” Dean explained, “it’s the only way we can get out when I get in there.” Then, he explained exactly what Sam had told him.
Whatever it was, in coexistence with what he was saying, it made Dean have a twitch of his own, but this, he was pretty sure it was an actual smile.
He slowly got Sam up on his feet and made sure to support his brother’s weight. His right leg was searing with pain, but Dean couldn’t care less. As long as his brother was going to be fine. Cas had told him that Sam was gonna be okay, Dean kept repeating to himself.
They continued to follow along the trail, and whenever he glanced at Dean, Castiel knew he had no clue where they were headed - but Castiel did. There was little Castiel did with no intention, he was a strategist, had been for thousands of years, and whatever he did - he planned and theorized in advance, every little detail calculated. - which was something he’d begun losing sight of whenever Dean was around, in his company, Castiel couldn’t plan in advance, he couldn’t predict what the hunter would say or do, and he certainly couldn’t be sure of what would come out of his mouth, even though he tried.
"I was wondering when you’d make an appearance," Commander Barnes spoke, at no angel in particular, as they stood in line, shoulder to shoulder, not giving away who was in charge.
“Let us not worry with the reasoning of these mud-monkeys, brother.” The angel who’d spoken first did so once again. He was tall and wide, and even though it was obvious any of them could kill them with a snap of their fingers, this one was more threatening than the others. “Here is our
he thought.
“I don’t mind,” Cas’s face had that small smile again, that Dean admittedly thought was adorable and he didn’t think he would ever have the strength to say no to him like this. He was about to comply when the angel’s smile faltered and his face scrunched up in what looked like a mixture between focused and annoyed.
This was it.
Commander James Barnes was a decent man. In his late forties, he’d had a busier life than most. Son of James Barnes Senior, founder and first leader of the City, he’d spent most of his childhood in the suburbs, an apple-pie type of life, until the angel attack that killed his siblings and sent his father into survival mode. Like many others in the same situation, Barnes Sr. was looking for protection, to have his last child grow up safe and sound. That's when he gathered people from around the country, some hunters, some just victims to the tragedy, and built the first walls, building an entire city protected from the outside world.
And Dean was going to take it.
“Exactly.” Dean smiled. “We’ll catch up in a few hours.”
The oven buzzed. He had completely forgotten about the pizzas by this point.
“Please talk to me,” the words were barely a whisper. From the moment Dean had told him what happened, they had shifted closer together on the couch, their legs were only inches away from touching. Dean was pretty sure Cas was actually able to hear his heart beating this time. And when Cas answered, in the same low voice, it was like the conversation was meant only for them.
“You can’t just say stuff like that,” Dean said with a hoarse voice from coughing.
“So, you live around here?”
“I’m sorry, I can't do this,” He pleaded, backing away from her. She looked back at him, in absolute shock. The look on her face, and the fact that she was an objectively attractive girl, made him think it was probably the first time this had happened to her. “I’m really sorry” he repeated, taking a hand to his face and just passing it through his hair.
.” Sam promptly said. “
The angel frowned for a split second, it was one of those rare moments where Dean could see a trace of emotion on his face.
“Who you were expecting.” Gabriel interrupted. “Sorry to disappoint Castiel, but one can never be careful enough these days you see.”
As he goes to leave, he finds his hand gripping the amulet again.
“I was worried that you would not remember me, at least not fully.”
As Dean’s brain attempts to readjust his thoughts and beliefs on The Empty, Meg walks over to Charlie.
Truth was, he believed them wholeheartedly. He knew that Dean would always be there for him as for the past few months, Castiel had not gone a day without him. His knight had become the only stable thing in his life, always there, always reachable.
Dean watched as Cas ran his fingers through his hair, gripping tightly at the ends.
He finds himself quickly slipping into the open one ready to go up. A few other people are already inside, but none of them give him a second glance. He isn’t sure whether it’s because they don’t recognise him, or they
Oh. Except for the fact he could see ghosts.
“Of course I do,” she says. “You have a family now, Dean. You’re a father, and if you gave all of that up to come back here, then you wouldn’t be the man I met all those years ago. You’re loyal and caring, it’s what I love about you. Am I disappointed you won’t be performing anymore? Absolutely. But I don’t regret bringing you on and giving you the chance to shine. Of course, there are going to be a lot of difficulties with getting this contract terminated, and I can’t promise you you won’t have to come back to Los Angeles to sit through a series of meetings. But, I can promise you that I will do everything I can to give you the life with your family that you deserve.”
Dean smiled.
Despite everything that happened afterwards, despite how painful the rest of her life was, Claire remembered being happy in that moment.
“Sorry to interrupt, I came to walk Dean home. I was in the area for business.”
He looked down, only to find Dean collapsed on the ground and suddenly, everything went cold.
The day that would either change or ruin everything.
A few feet in front of them, four monsters were gathered, growling at the group with ferocity. These monsters in particular were vampires, evil creatures that migrated to Grace Island due to its wealth of magic. They had humanistic features: they walked on two legs, had working arms and hands, pale skin and oval shaped faces. However, they looked too sickly to be human and ultimately, only cared about the taste of blood. Whenever you saw one, their sharp teeth would emerge from their gums and they would hiss and growl as they danced around their prey.
She grins.
“Who even are you?” Elizabeth asks.
Claire replied with a cheeky grin.
Dean chuckled humourlessly.
All his life, he had been lied to.
She took a step back and straightened herself up. Her softer gaze hardened again as she stared at him sternly.
The story was far from over.
Dean signed the word ‘bad’ but mouthed horrible—which made Cas crack a smile.
The range of weaponry that the fortresses held was fascinating, and also quite terrifying. Castiel was much happier to study these things from afar and observe, but he could never actually pilot one of these buildings. Sometimes, he felt that the champions were all much braver than him.
By the time they reach the plateau, they are all exhausted, having practically fought their entire way up here.
A small smile graced Dean’s lips.
Castiel Novak and Dean Winchester met on a stormy day in November of 1994, in the small city of Lawrence, Kansas. It was a day that neither of them had any memory of, considering they were both only two years of age. But Dean’s mother Mary, has retold the story to them countless times.
“They aren’t
“I’m not actually mad, I just wanted to see how you’d react.”
However, if it is, Dean’s sure he’d be dead by now.
As he tells Charlie all about his kills, she glares at him.
He was
it is. He may not remember his previous life and the little nuances to it, but he can’t ignore the feeling of dread inside of him. Why can he not hear talking? Or footsteps walking? All he can hear is the trees, the slightest chirps of a bird and the sound of his own breath. The land is eerily silent, including the fact that the voice hasn’t spoken again. No matter how many times he holds onto the object, the voice doesn’t reappear.
Dean laughs. “It’s been like this every year since she was three. Her first birthday party with the twins having only just been born, and you were frantically making sure that she knew how much we loved her. Ever since, I guess that frantic-ness hasn’t gone away.”
It really was a special birthday after all.
Dean forgets about his phone in the corner; silently filming.
“That sounds ridiculous,” Dean replies.
Dean returned to the inn before supper, looking just the same as he had before he left. Same stoic expression, observant eyes and his continued, complete silence. Castiel did not talk to him for the rest of the night, not because he felt betrayed or angry, but because he was afraid that if he spoke, those deep desires of his would all come tumbling out.
“Sure,” he tells the stranger, his instinct telling him that his man wasn’t some pickpocket or axe-murderer targeting him. “Free country.”
They reach the Impala and Dean, ever the gentleman, holds open the passenger door for Cas. He closes it behind him and hops into the driver’s seat, shoving the keys in the ignition. As the car begins to rumble, Cas lets out a soft chuckle.
Cas smiled, “How about we blame no one?”
Dean just laughs and pushes Cas towards the bed. “Just read it, okay?”
“It is completely dangerous and foolish,” Charlie states, “but the thing was, they had a plan. See, they were going to go and look for this crown first. It’s said to be one of the most powerful crowns of the island, crafted for Grace by Michael himself. The crown is meant to ward off any monster attack,
Mary carefully grabbed it with a cloth, bringing it over to the dining table. She gestured for Castiel to sit as she began to pour them both a cup of tea. Castiel sat and patiently waited.
Dean immediately understood what was happening, despite not having been exposed to sign language often in his six years of life. The first, and only, time it happened previously was a few months ago at the Lawrence Public Library. His mom and him were visiting Miss Missouri who worked there as a librarian. Dean had been watching their conversation curiously, especially when Miss Missouri stopped halfway through to help a visitor. Dean had been intrigued as the man began to move his hands to form weird shapes, but didn’t speak a word. He became confused when Miss Missouri  started to do the same and he tugged on his mom’s shirt, asking her what was going on.
“Well she sounds awful.” Charlie comments.
She signed, fingerspelling his nickname before using his sign name. The man stared back at her with curiosity as he raised his own hands.
He’d always ask the moment Dean got home from college. He’d taken to going straight upstairs as soon as he stepped inside, just so that he could flee Sam’s taunts.
He approached Dean’s door, which was opened, slightly ajar. He knew that was part of Dean’s duty, sleeping with the door open, in case anything were to happen to Castiel. He crept up to it, slowly peeking into the dark room. He could not see anything at first as there was no light source, not until a large bolt of lightning crashed down outside the castle, illuminating the room for just a moment. It was there that he saw Dean asleep in his bed, curled onto his side, his back facing away from Castiel. From the doorway, he could hear his soft, sleeping breaths, quiet but unmissable. He stood there for a moment, letting the comfort of knowing that Dean was there, calm him from his panicked state. After a few deep breaths, he slowly came to the realisation that he was lurking in the hall in an eerie manner, one that would surely frighten any guard that may eventually passby. He knew that it was best for him to head back to his room and attempt to sleep.
The request made Castiel’s heart drop into his stomach. The denial for her request was on the tip of his tongue, every ounce of him begging to say,
“The Nephlims are almost ready to be put in battle and defend the castle,” the Queen continued on, “from what you and the champions have stated, the fortresses are ready and up to standard. Your knight here is well prepared to play his part. Everyone has their roles. Everyone has trained and is ready to play their roles. Everyone, except for you Castiel.”
The night ended with Dean’s lips swollen from an impromptu make out session with his roommate and him throwing up in the bathroom, with Cas standing by him and helping him through it. While the next day was awkward, Aaron and Dean both agreed in their sober state of mind that they were better off as friends. Aaron assured Dean that he wouldn’t out him to his friends and kept that promise for the rest of their time at college. While Dean could no longer hide from himself that he liked guys as well as girls, he at least could keep it a secret from his friends for a little while longer.
“Come on, kid.” She said, patting her shoulder. “You’ve had a tiring day.”
“Uhm… yes?”
With a surge of determination, she got out of the car. After locking the door, she gripped her keys tightly in her hand. She marched up the front stairs right up to the front door and with one last boost of confidence, she rang the doorbell.
“Such as?”
Gently, Castiel helped the two men extract Dean from his arms and carry him away from the kingdom. Castiel could not help but watch them depart, his hands balled into fists to stop him from going after them. He knew that his decision would take something away from him, that this decision would lead him to inevitable heartbreak. But Castiel had learnt from being in the royal family that his happiness and desires did not matter. Ultimately, what mattered was the safety and lives of his people, something he had ruined already.
Dean blinks.
As he got into the driver’s seat, he couldn’t help but send Dean one last look before he put the car into reverse. He would never forget Dean’s heartbroken gaze as he drove away, towards a new life and away from the life he once knew.
But it was obvious Charlie and Dean were out enjoying themselves, too caught up in the fun of it all to think about Cas. He couldn’t blame them, no matter how bitter or sad he felt.
“Have you talked to Mom or Dad recently?” Sam questioned at the end of his rattling. Dean affirmed he had, he’d spoken to them over the phone on the weekend. Sam told Dean about how he and Eileen visited them over the summer.
They begin to share stories about themselves, as the dancing and festivities continue to happen around them. Cas tells Dean a little more about his studies as a professor of history, particularly the formation of soulmate bonds over the past few millennia. Dean reluctantly tells Cas about his job as the head cook at the local bar and grill, but surprisingly, the man seems to be intrigued rather than have any form of detest for Dean’s career.
Dean turned to look at Castiel, waiting for him to speak. While they all knew Dean respected Missouri and her words, he would not leave until Castiel said he could. His loyalties lay with the prince. After his conversation with Mary, the thought practically pained Castiel.
He handed the last customer their coffee, breathing a sigh of relief when he realised that rush was over for a moment. He thought about sitting down for a moment, having a minute to himself before his day got
Cas sighed. “It seems are worse than we thought.”
“I don’t know what you’re talking about kid, now you might wanna head home to Jody. I’m trying to clean.”
He felt Dean stiffen behind him, probably because he knew how much Castiel hated this topic. But Castiel felt inclined to reply.
Dean rolled his eyes fondly and turned to Krissy. “Don’t worry about staying to close up. You can go home now.”
Dean could feel a small weight lift off him at Cas’ words.
Castiel rode up front with Anna, their two horses trotting slowly in sync.
get upset, which I
It was a foreign sound to Dean as his friend didn’t laugh a lot. He did laugh, but most of it was inaudible, just quiet, breathy putters. Cas didn’t use his vocal chords regularly as he didn’t like to talk. Dean had never heard Cas speak, not once. He knew his friend could use vocal speech, since he went to a speech therapist for seven years. However, Cas found it unnecessary to speak and thus, didn’t. Considering his first language was ASL, Dean understood.
“She must have moved on, worked through whatever kept her stuck here. Or you know, maybe the big guy upstairs took pity on her.”
“Set up your phone somewhere in the living room, or the bedroom, somewhere hidden. Then, tell Cas that you’re mad at him, pretend that he did something wrong. I want you to see how he reacts.”
The night storm shook the castle, the walls reverberating with every crash of thunder that thrummed through the grounds of the island. Rain poured from the sky, pattering harshly on the roof above Castiel’s head. He was wide awake, staring at the ceiling, hoping that somehow he would magically fall asleep. It wasn’t the rain or thunder that was keeping him awake, but rather the thoughts that spiralled through his mind, proving far too distracting for him to ignore. The events of the next day loomed over him, the fate of his people rested solely in his hands.
“Yes.”
He waited for about half a minute, concentrating to see if there was anyway he could make his friend appear. Yet, when he opened his eyes there was still no sign of Cas. He closed them again and took a deep breath.
Cas found it easiest to interpret only when he knew he needed to, or when Dean specifically asked. Other times, he stood back and let Dean communicate, not feeling any urge to jump in and attempt to carry the conversation.
Dean reiterated her words to Jody, since she still wasn’t fluent with sign language.
Dean signed. Cas, being the most trustworthy friend ever, didn’t hesitate and followed his friend.
The truth was, that he didn’t even understand it himself. Angels were supposed to be created without any capability of emotion, fearless soldiers who would never question orders. Of course, angels didn’t lack a total moral compass, this was a necessary trait when watching over an entire species, and of course, there was record of angels falling off the wagon here and there, of developing emotions, human emotions, some of them even going as far as falling in love with a human, of… That would never be him,
“I’m fine,” Dean lied, knowing perfectly well that Sam wouldn’t believe him. He didn’t even believe it himself. He wanted to be fine, he’d love nothing more than to be just as indifferent to the whole ordeal as Castiel, but he couldn’t. He’d always been like this, always too sentimental, too attached, John rode him so much for that when he was younger, he eventually just learned to put up this hard-ass, too cool for school front, and thing was, most people never actually bothered to try and look past it. The few that had gotten to see that side of him, he repressed so much, ended up leaving anyway, one way or another, so he’d just given up at this point. But now? Now he felt that the whole masquerade was becoming harder and harder to maintain, especially around Cas.
There was a silent moment where neither met the other’s gaze.
“Dean?” A ruffle of feathers behind him caught his attention. “Your call sounded very distressed, what’s going on?”
“Hey Cas, what’s up?”
Being stuck inside the smallest closet in the world, with the angel he’d drunkenly kissed and who’d outright rejected him, was the last thing he thought he’d been doing on a rainy December Thursday, or any Thursday really.
Dean felt for his car keys in his pocket. He’d told Sam he’d be there, he had to get going. “Yeah, you do that.”
side.
“Yeah, I bet.” He pinched the bridge of his nose, and let his dirty fingers press into his eyes for a moment.
Cas nodded, trying another sip.
This is also where I have been posting previews of the new chapters every Sunday, and I'm writing some short prompts so feel free to submit ideas!
He steadied his breath, as he felt Cas take one step closer, feeling the wooden wall against his shoulder blades. At this distance, Dean could see him perfectly, the moonlight casting a white glow on his jaw, his stubble grown out more than he’d ever seen in him, and his eyes, hooded and pupils wide. Dean felt the way Cas was staring at him, at his lips, at his body and he let it wash over him, filling him up, and even on the coldest January night, he felt as if the sun was hitting his skin, warming him from the inside out.
“Only if you watch this movie with me.”
He could identify one of them as a hunter, commander Barnes, and he was talking to a man he’d never seen before. Dean’s heart dropped as soon as the third man turned around, his eyes blinking rapidly as if trying to process what he was seeing faster, because John Winchester was standing next to them. What the hell was his dad doing there? His heart raced and over the million things that should be on his mind, one kept popping up, insistently - his dad and Cas in the same place - and he, warily, nudged Cas to get down and hide better.
“That’s very funny coming from someone who looks like they just walked out of a lumberjack’s weekly magazine.”
In just a few movements he was immersed in the feeling, it was just him and this bag, and all his feelings, all his frustrations, all of it he poured it out right there. He let every emotion melt into one big, angry, arm movement that culminated with his hand hitting the black leather bag. He had to get it all out,
"And that "grace" happens to look like the fucking sun?" Dean asked once he collected his wits.
was starting to make its way to the top of the list.
“Hello, Dean,” there was almost a familiarity in the way Castiel said it, Dean refused to notice it.
“Who is to say?” Curt seemed lost in thought for a second. “But I know that the archangels are supposed to be most powerful, which if you ask me, is a load of crap. I mean, after all, you’ve got Michael looked away in your city’s little prison cell, now he can’t be all that powerful can he?”
“So, where to?” he asked.
“Not for a few days, I need to deal with some personal crap. I’ll call you when I head back.”
Cas was not expecting this line of thought, his eyes squinted in distrust. “Why?”
The first encounter between hunters and angels went by quite amicably, if you will. They discovered common ground in their shared enemies and were able to strike a deal to tolerate each other's existences. It wasn't until years later that the hunters learned of the angel's plans to attack the city and burn it to the ground. Though it was supposedly only a part of the angels that felt this way, it left the hunters with an unnerving need for more precautions and safety.
This was getting serious faster than Dean thought,
“Tomorrow night,” Curt smiled at the confusion apparently clear on the hunter’s face, “sooner than you expected?”
Dean went to check them in, nervously looking around for any familiar faces in the lobby - there weren’t any. Still, he fidgeted with his sleeves, and when the lady at the front desk asked him how many beds they needed, he chuckled uncomfortably. When he went hunting with Sam they never asked that.
“I’m not sure,” Castiel’s brow furrowed. “You don’t trust me, I thought maybe this would help.”
“That's an odd name,” Dean didn't really know how to handle the new turn in their conversation.
“We do not want to cause a scene brother, not today.” Rufus had made his way next to Bobby and put his hand on the angry man’s shoulder.
Dean took a deep breath, there was only one option he could think of and he didn’t exactly like it, and that was an understatement. He took a deep breath and pushed away the nagging thoughts in his brain.
“Someone must have betrayed us, there is no other possible explanation.” Uriel turned his gaze to Metatron seeking an answer.
“My point exactly,” Bobby nodded.
Without a word to anyone in the room Dean turned around and made his way through the front door.
Dean had to stop staring at this dude's lips. He cleared his throat.
“Huh? So what do you think?” Dean asked with about the biggest grin possible on his face, as he watched Castiel take his first bite.
“And your name?”
look on his face.
“No, no way, I’m not dragging Bobby into this,” Dean said, nodding his head profusely. “Out of the question.”
“I don’t take offense. He is very complicated,” Castiel couldn’t exactly reduce Metatron to, as Dean put it ‘being a douchebag’, he was cunning and rarely did anything without good reason - which was not so say it was the same as a
“You seem to really enjoy these burgers,” Castiel’s eyes narrowed slightly, a thing Dean recognized he did when he was thinking about something.
“What could demons possibly be hiding from?” Dean wondered out loud.
Dean was busy checking out the gashes on Gabriel’s torso when Cas let out a pain-ridden sound. He had his hands on the bars again and was trying to pull them apart. They still wouldn’t budge and Cas’s skin was starting to smell like a cooked pig. Dean knew it was useless to get him to stop, so he joined him, grabbing at the lock, trying to break it apart. His muscles burned and he pushed them even further, but there was no opening it.
- he punched harder and faster -
“Does your city know?”
His head was a mess, and he was just really tired.
Within seconds they found themselves in the all too familiar cabin, Dean would probably never get used to the angel mojo being used on him, but once again he couldn't complain. The scent of fresh wood and pine filled Dean's nose and he sighed contently. The content slipped away as fast as it had come, everything around him was too tight, too hot. He felt the uneasy knot in his stomach, trying to suppress every possible question in his mind. What was the point of being absolutely shitfaced if he still couldn't drink away the thoughts that kept him up when he was sober?
boy toy for that matter, what’s wrong with you?” He tried to sound offended and nonchalant, but he was guessing Jo could see he was just full-on blushing.
“I said no,” John’s tone was strict. “Go check in with Bobby soon, I think he found another case for you and Sam. Just make sure he goes with you this time.”
“I don’t care, you’re gonna have to break things off. You’re only putting her in danger, and worse you’re putting our family in danger.”
They’d been in silence for a few minutes, but now the silence was different, it was absolute - just the birds chirping away like the happy motherfuckers they were, and only one breath visible in the cold air.
A wave of relief washed over him, and a smile took shape on his face.
his voice failing him. This wasn’t something he talked about,
“As many of you will know, unfortunately, no deal has yet been struck with the humans to release our leader, Michael,” Metatron stated this matter of factly, not a hint of pity or remorse, he didn’t even look bothered by the fact, like Michael was of no importance, just a casualty of the war, as any other, as if he was not talking about their leader, the one they had sworn to follow, the one who had stood with them in the trenches of wars past, and who would lead them into the final one.
“It’s just hard to understand how an angel would want anything to do with a guy like me, how this isn’t some kind of ploy to betray me... ” His hands ran through his hair, unable to fully process the things he was saying, and how naked he felt standing in this alleyway, trying to tell the truth, for once in his life, no games, no jokes to hide behind. “And this doesn’t come easy for me, but for some reason, I know I can trust you, Cas. So… just bare with me, okay?”
There. The words hung in the air like a heavy, wet blanket, over them, and Dean’s eyes slowly widened in sudden clarity -
He tried to see the grand scheme of things, he tried to see humans as a whole again, as either something to protect or something to crush, but a problem itched in the back of his mind -  a problem named
Sam stared him down, knowingly, a side smirk drawing and he looked amused.
But his heart sped up at the words, using angel mojo was a painful reminder of all that Cas was, and all he would never be. It was a strange feeling, to not doubt the angel’s intentions, because unlike last times, Dean trusted him completely now, hell he even
He suddenly remembered overhearing Bobby talk about a possible meeting between the hunters and the angels, a so-called peaceful way to free Michael from the city and give the hunters something they wanted in return. The idea of a harmonious negotiation between the two was more ridiculous than the idea of Sam shaving his hair off.
Dean coughed again, whether it was from the beer or sheer awkwardness was up for interpretation.
No matter how much Dean wanted to deny it, the truth was that he was hoping to run into Cas at the cabin. Hoping he would get there and Cas would just be standing there, note in hand, smiling at him, that head tilt of his when Dean walked through the door. He’d tell himself that he just wanted to know that the angel was safe from all the bloodthirsty hunters out there, but deep down he knew he also wanted to spend more time with him, to just hang around and pretend the world wasn’t coming down all around them.
“Why?” Cas demanded, loud and angry at him for slowing them down now, there was no point anymore, in being hushed, the angels were getting dangerously close, they had to know where they were hiding by now. Cas’s hand tugged at Dean’s arm, for him to move, but he wouldn’t budge.
“Huh, guess your leader has more style than I gave him credit for,” Dean smirked as he read the neon sign above the club. “Alright, The Shady Lady, now this is a case I can get behind.”
"What the..." Dean gasped for air.
“No, I interrupted you. You were going to say?” Cas pressed, and Dean combed his fingers through his hair,
“Wait a minute, Bobby, I thought your meeting was supposed to be until five?” Sam asked.
He looked over at Dean and a warm glow spread in his chest when he saw that he was smiling, and for a second, the night that started to fall upon them felt like no other night, far away from threats and obligations.
When Cas had told him about his orders, to keep track of suspicious activities in the Shady Lady, Dean suggested he stayed at this motel, right across the street from the Club.
Only a few of the prominent hunter families were invited to attend the confidential meeting. So of course, every single hunter in the city felt the strong urge to let their presence be noticed. A few men stood at the entrance of the grey, dull building and were struggling to keep the large crowd out. The building looked like it could have functioned as an office or perhaps a hotel in the past, but as of a few years, it functioned as the command center for hunter’s affairs.
“They killed them Cas, I’m sorry. I had no idea this would happen and if I did I would’ve warned you, I don’t care about the consequences, I just- this was wrong, and I should’ve known but-” He was ready to keep talking, his mouth just kept going, way ahead of his brain. Probably because it was the only way he could delay Castiel’s reaction, maybe he’d get mad and just disappear, but Dean had just gotten him back and there was no way he was letting him go again.
“Oh really?” Gabriel started, obviously about to drop the ‘all bad things I hope’. He was getting predictable after some thousands of years.
Dean quickened his pace, half walking, half jogging. He knew she would ask a million questions and he couldn’t answer any of them.
“Smell what?” He’d been too busy trying to check all the cardboard boxes for any clue to have smelled anything but the moldy storage room, but now as Cas pointed it out, he definitely felt something, something way out of place.
“The bones?” John asked, turning to his youngest son.
“Then let’s get out of here, this ain’t exactly a cozy street cafe,” Bobby said.
“we slept together-”
Something in Bobby’s voice stopped Dean from pressing the matter.
“Ah yes, his little pet,” Gabriel smiled as if he was remembering something. “Did you know Metatron makes him wear a collar?”
Dean looked up from the couch, the bag of frozen peas pressed against his face, every expression that he tried to form hurt like a motherfucker, and he was sure that right about now he was swelling and looking worse than a day old roadkill squirrel. He hadn’t gone to look in the mirror, or even wash his face, he’d decided that icing it was the priority.
“Hey, excuse me, sweetheart,” Dean tapped the bar with his knuckles. The brunette girl behind the counter approached them with a smile. “Can we get two beers over here?”
“What is?” Dean asked, his voice still raspy from sleep.
“Dean, you’re clearly going through a post-break-up funk,” Sam came closer and leaned on the arm of the chair across from him.
The back of Castiel’s head moved in a nodding motion, confirming.
“Hey, Cas?” Dean looked at the angel, who appeared unsettled by the taste of the beer “Can I ask you something?”
“So dad moved it?” He watched as Bobby opened up a map. Dean tried to figure out which state it was, but upon further inspection, he realized it wasn’t even in English. “Where?”
“So you’re telling me that everyone’s heaven is different?” Dean raised his eyebrows.
That being said, he still couldn’t bring himself to leave the cabin. Maybe if he waited just a little longer, Cas would show up and he could stop the unnecessary worrying. Dean sighed as he kicked off his shoes, he would have to find some way to catch up with his training. With everything going on they hadn’t been sent out on many cases anyway, the only one that seemed to frequently leave the city was his dad. He tried not to guess the reason behind his dad’s constant disappearing, whether he was just avoiding his own family, or if he could be striking another deal with some treacherous angel in a warehouse filled with lethal weapons.
lock yourself out of your cabin last week?” He playfully punched him in the arm, but the man still looked at him inquisitively, clearly not finding this age remark funny, so Dean tried to answer his question. “A wraith, nasty things - he just wanted me to check some details on an old case, he thinks it may be the same monster.”
“You don’t like her then?” Castiel asked, his usual frown in place.
Apparently, the closest Cas managed, was still a heck of a long way from where Gabriel was being held. Cas had told him they were deep in the Smoky Mountains terrain, and that they were looking for a cave. Other than that, he could only say he would
As Dean ran out of the building all he could feel was anger, anger towards his father, for basically selling him out to the enemy, angry at himself for almost giving in to Michael’s words, and mostly, angry at Castiel. His stomach twisted and turned at the idea that the angel had wanted this all along, that this was his end-game.
“It’s just an expression Cas, you’re gonna like it, just take my word for it.” He made his way into the kitchen to look at a depressingly scarce pantry.
“Uh, yeah, yeah.” Dean hurriedly answered. “So, what are they-we- doing with the kids?”
When Dean felt sure his knees wouldn’t give way beneath him, he pulled away just enough to look at Cas. He felt lightheaded and with an immense sense of ignorant glee. He carefully peeked through his eyelids, and theatrically looked around.
He weighed all these considerations, eyes still closed, wondering if Dean would say anything so that he wouldn’t have to.
“Do you even know how to cook anything?” He noticed the way Cas was looking at the packets of instant noodles in front of him, and it didn’t look as if they had a lot of pre-packaged ramen in Heaven.
Cas looked puzzled as if he didn’t really comprehend what Dean was saying, until he did, and then his expression shifted, becoming harder, his fists clenching and breath heavy -
Sam’s smile widened, “so whose house do we target? I’ll egg a house.’”
“There’s no need to lie to yourself like that,” Castiel wondered why Dean made a habit out of making everyone believe he wasn’t hurt. He briefly asked himself if Dean was afraid that he would suggest healing him again.
“Maybe it’s time Heaven shows a little decency, it’s not like we, too, haven’t killed their kind before.”
, he thought, trying to hide his embarrassment. But if Cas noticed, he didn’t make note of it.
“How will I get there?” Castiel had innocently asked him in return.
This is where Castiel drew the line, this is where he had to intervene. “What?” All four eyes turned to face him, “You are contemplating betraying your city, your family, freeing a war prisoner, all because you feel you are on the wrong side of this war, you’re doing this out of justice, from the pointer of your unbreakable moral compass, Dean. There is no one more righteous than you.”
In the afternoon Dean decided they’d watch a movie, one of his favorites obviously, because if Cas had seen zero movies, then he would make it his personal mission that he only see great movies.
was, it was simply platonic. And Dean was fine with it. Because this friendship, platonic
“It took quite a lot of power to heal your brother, my power will be replenished again in a few minutes.” Castiel's legs were unsteady as he stood up straight and for a second Dean hesitated to reach for him, but he decided against it.
“But that's miles away from Pittsburg,” Sam said simultaneously.
“Dean…” Cas whispered, turning his head, to look away, and immediately Dean felt the cold absence of Cas’s eyes on him. “What do you want from me?” Cas sounded defeated, and Dean hated it, how he made it sound as if he wasn't the one breaking his goddamn heart.
It didn’t help that Castiel was just standing there wearing Dean’s clothes, for fucks sake.
(whatever that meant). It was pretty.
John turned a rusty nail between his thumb and fingers as if he was inspecting it.
“Hey there, little bro.” A voice snapped him out of his thoughts and it didn’t belong to Uriel.
“I remember seeing a bright light after every time I was badly injured and then waking up perfectly fine apart from my memory. I saw the same light when you were healing Sam. I mean I was just guessing before, but it really was you, wasn’t it?”
They spent the rest of the drive in silence.
It wasn’t all bad, though, because Cas was still asleep (
?” Rufus snorted and a few other hunters looked equally amused.
“I know,” Dean toyed with one of the cleaning rods on the table. “I was just wondering if you and the others had gotten anywhere with Michael yet.”
“Please, you say that about everyone” Castiel rolled his eyes, still trying to figure out where exactly they were. Water surrounded their long rowboat, a few miles ahead he could see the emerald green water slowly chiseling out a rocky cliff by crashing against it. “Where are we?”
Dean to want him to.
“Yeah, I can see that,” Dean said grinning widely. “Did you recreate the North Pole while you were at it?”
He avoided looking at his eyes, the green eyes that had completely captivated his mind. He wondered what Dean was thinking about at this moment, they hadn’t really said anything since they turned to face each other. His whole body froze when Dean reached out his hand, his fingers lightly brushing against his naked chest before they gently lifted his amulet. He watched as the hunter studied the crystal attentively, his eyes narrowing just a little bit as he turned it over in his fingers. It took everything Castiel had to refrain from reaching out to touch the little crinkles that appeared next to his eyes.
your boyfriend.”
He tried to keep his eyes closed, and just focus on Cas’s breaths, counting them like sheep. If he just kept listening to his breathing, he could fall asleep fully sure that Cas was alive and well and maybe he wouldn’t dream about those horrible images again.
He trailed the back of her body, letting his fingers get tangled in her hair, pulling it slightly, and let his lips hit hers, his teeth sinking into her bottom lip until she let out a small moan. He took her keys with his free hand, and swiftly found the right one, unlocking the door with ease. She stumbled backward inside, clinging unto him, her arms around his neck. Dean took a look around, trying to find somewhere to do it, and the couch happened to be right ahead. He paused for a moment, to take his shirt off, and went ahead and undid his pants as she got undressed, slowly, eyes on his, seductively. He let his gaze explore her body, pleased with what he saw, his mouth agape.
“Does this annoy you?” Castiel asked.
Dean was on his way to get some take out. “I’ll be back soon Flounder, don’t drown.”
“Cas, what the hell happened?” Dean pleaded, adding pressure to the wound, trying to stop the blood. Cas’s eyelids were drooping, he was barely awake, but Dean could see him trying to speak.
On the contrary, Dean eyes the floor as if it was the most interesting thing in sight, and Castiel couldn't believe the words that came out of his mouth next.
Dean earned a confused look from his brother, who was used to being the one paired with him, Dean just shrugged it off. He knew damn well that his dad was using this hunt as a shitty cover, to keep a closer eye on him.
A deep-seated gloominess set camp in the back of Dean’s stomach. He tried to ignore it, to make it go away with food. His specialty noodles were heating on the stove, in probably more quantity than he could eat, just in case Cas would come back sooner rather than later. The feeling turned into an actual stomach ache when Cas didn’t come back, and Dean had to eat all of it on his own.
“Cover for you? Dean, I’m coming with you.”
He knew it had been no coincidence that Uriel had asked him to meet in that specific part of the forest.
“Yeah, but I’ve never sworn to destroy every angel that crosses my path, I’m just confused this is coming from you, that’s all.” Sam shrugged.
Dean mentally hit himself.
Then darkness swallowed him whole.
Dean put his hand against the window and peered inside. There clearly hadn’t been anyone at this particular garage in ages. Nearly every single shelf was empty covered in dust, with the exception of a few shelves that carried mechanics tools and spare tires. The place looked overall grubby, and empty beer cans and torn-up magazines littered the floor.
He couldn’t breathe.
“Darkness is not the opposite of light, Dean.”
Dean furrowed his brow, in confusion,
“Yeah, I guess,” Dean took another sip of his beer. “Can I at least buy you a beer?” He did the math in his head, and he was sure he could spare a few bucks to thank the man. Had it not been for him, he’d be in real hot water right now. “It’s the least I can do”
“Yes, it’s very likely they stripped him of his grace and are keeping it from him. They have to be keeping it very far away from him, though, as archangel grace is not keen on being away from the archangel, and once it is close enough it will jump back in at the first opening it sees.”
Dean's elbow rested out of the open window of his precious car, letting the wind hit his face, appreciating the refreshing breeze against his skin. He was driving back into town after the talk, and a million thoughts ran through his mind. The most important of which, finding the mole. Someone inside the city walls was working against them. Couldn’t be an angel, Dean figured, because of the warding - but who the hell could it be, and why? What could a hunter possibly have to gain with this?
With a body full of liquor, his tongue carefully tasting Cas’s lips, licking them before pushing past them and meeting his tongue. He pulled Cas closer, keeping their upper bodies tight against each other, Dean’s legs were trembling by this point, all his blood pooling in one place just inches away from Castiel’s groin. For a second Castiel’s body moved with his, slowly, and Dean felt him kissing back harder,–
He only moved again once he heard the door close, looking at the spot where Castiel had stood a second ago. He just needed this day to be over - stumbling his way to the bed, he let himself drop down, face-first into the pillow - he just needed to sleep it off, all of it.
The room was quiet, the heaviness in the air was near palpable, and stern faces around the marble table painted a picture of a grief unspoken. Angels filled their usual seats, and many more stood behind those sitting, the room at full capacity, with angels from all corners and positions of Heaven gathering to hear, to understand, to mourn their fallen brothers and sisters.
“No,” the angel replied with a low voice.
“So this is it,” Cas’s voice startled him, almost making him spill his coffee. He hadn’t heard him approaching. “Back to work again,” Dean didn’t look at him, it would just make things harder. He knew there was probably no occasion for them to spend as much time together like this again in the future, and that thought left him feeling emptier than it should.
“You’re awake,” the fingers stopped moving, and Dean didn’t know if it was a question or a statement.
Reasoning with angels was harder than teaching mankind to refrain from sin, which made convincing them nearly impossible. However, Gabriel liked to think that his persuasive skills were of unprecedented greatness. After all, he did manage to turn three whole garrisons against Metatron so far. It was all in getting them to fight for a common goal, get Heaven back the way it had been before. Angels weren’t known for being independent and their limitless wit and free will, no, they were soldiers, trained to follow orders. He did not offer them a position to fight under his name, instead, he offered them to fight for their chosen leader.
“Can I try something?” the angel asked. Dean nodded, as he was one hundred percent positive that he could not make any comprehensible sound right now. Dean’s brow furrowed in confusion when Cas moved away again, turning to lie on his back, and immediately Dean felt the lack of Cas, the cold embracing him.
He could remember the first time he’d went way over his orders and saved Dean from a nasty fall - he’d fallen, hit his head, and lay there bleeding on the floor, and at this point, Castiel had been watching him for months, at the command of Michael, watching over  Hunter’s City.
“Dean,” Sam’s grin greeted him when he walked through the front door. A quick glance around told him it was unlikely he’d get any shut-eye soon, Sam held a bucket of popcorn and told him that it was
He exhaled a breath he wasn’t aware of holding.
“I used the human soap like you told me to,” a voice came from somewhere in the foam.
Through the large rectangular windows on the side of the building, one was able to get a glance at what was happening inside. A group of around thirty hunters sat at a wooden table in a large hall. On the inside, the walls were covered by what looked like an arsenal. Guns, knives, bats, hatchets, crossbows, basically anything a hunter would consider a weapon was proudly decorating the hall. The group of hunters was chatting noisily until a man entered the room and took a seat in the middle of the table.
