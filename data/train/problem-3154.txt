Cas walked away from the door, and Dean waited. He heard a soft creak somewhere to his right, then Cas came back to the door.
Cas rolled his eyes and dragged Dean into the shower. "You're insufferable." Cas kissed him deeply, thoroughly, and Dean melted into his arms.
Cas could see that Dean's hands were shaking with how angry he was. "Don't try and make this about the greater good, Sammy. Do not play that card. You damn well know how much we gave up for the 'greater good', can't you understand what this felt like? I spent my whole life protecting and caring for you, I feel guilty every time you ever get as much as a scratch, and now you're forcing me to work with the people who actively tortured you? Can you not SEE what this is like? I have spent enough time sacrificing things or doing things because of a so called greater good, and to be honest, I'm tired of it. I want to tear down every single one of these pantsuit fuckheads without worrying about damning humanity."
Cas looked at him through hooded eyes, his gaze dull and unfocused. He reached out and touched Dean's shoulder.
“Shower first. It’ll get most of this stuff out.” Dean toes off his socks and looks up to Cas standing in front of the tub, doing absolutely nothing.
Cas returned with a huge plate he set on a particularly big pillow, before going back and adding two filled wine glasses. He carefully sat them down and Dean leaned over.
Dean knocked for the third time, worried. It was the same time as his usual deliveries, but Cas just wasn't opening the door. Dean had been a bit nervous to come back after their heart to heart last time, and this wasn't helping much. He seriously considered dropping the box and leaving.
"Thank you," he whispered and pressed a kiss to the top of Cas's head. "In that case, gimme a day and time and I'll be here."
“Be careful,” Dean says as Cas stands up, but Cas ignores him. He touches his own chest, fingers spread over his heart before opening his arms wide, eyes closed and lips moving silently.
Dean nodded along and pointed to a collection of loose tea bags next to the pill bottles. "Is that, like, special happy brain tea?"
"Excellent observation," Dean said and couldn't resist kissing him. One kiss turned into two, three, and soon they were pressed together head to toe, Dean dripping onto the kitchen tiles and Cas's hands fisted in his wet hair.
Dean wanted to reply in a snarky way, be rude and closed off before he realized that Ben was trying to not pull him too far into it, to just give him a baseline to work off of, and he was giving him the opportunity to end the conversation on his own terms by accepting the joke or not.
“Is there a main thing that’s bothering you?” Dean heard fabric rustling, he turned his head and saw a smidge of black pajama pants peek through the cat flap. He didn't stop the softening of his own expression, this was the first time he’d ever seen anything of the man in person. It felt strangely intimate.
It was just before dusk; the garden washed over with golden light dipping everything into a fairytale coloring. Cas was standing next to him and looking out over everything, watching a small bird jump around on the hedge before flying away.
.” He tried to put as much understanding and calmness in his voice as he could. He let his hand rest in its position, waiting for a reaction.
He doesn't get a reply. Cas sits down on the dried blood, dodges the puddle awkwardly and looks out the window. Sam just drives.
"Good," Cas said and hung up. Dean shook his head as he pocketed his phone and polished off his apple, depositing the core in the nearest trash bin with a somewhat impressive throw. He rolled his sleeves back down and got back to work on the red Corolla that had been neglected by its owners. Dean took extra good care of it.
Cas was amazing with his hands, and included all sorts of little twists and pressure changes that made Dean release embarrassing little noises. He clung to Cas, pulled his head close and catching his bottom lip between his teeth before joining Cas's effort with his free hand.
The curse sounded foreign coming from Cas, and Dean couldn't help but laugh. He let go of Cas's hand to take the popcorn out of the microwave, a bowl handed to him immediately.
The next four hours went by quickly, and before Dean knew it he had shot off a text to Cas and was on his way. He had the windows rolled down, the warm breeze drifting through his sweat-damp hair. A random rock song was on the radio, and he tapped the rhythm onto the steering wheel.
Cas hummed in reply and got up. He hesitated, not stepping away from the door. His socked feet stood very still.
meet. They’re both gentle with each other, unhurried, but there’s a weight to it all that’s settling in Dean’s chest. He wonders if he could ever get used to the feeling.
Cas’ hands are hovering over Dean's chest. He moves them to his forehead, his stomach, back up and around. Dean can feel the warmth of them, can track Cas' touch as it wanders, and a slight shiver runs through him.
“Your left hand goes on my shoulder,” Dean says quietly, and Cas takes a tiny step closer to him. His hand is firm where he places it on Dean’s shoulder.
“Wow, this is gross,” he mumbled as he gave his shirt a sniff and almost dropped it because of the ripe stench of sweat and smoke.
They showered long, with wandering hands and caressing lips, before the water slowly started turning cold. They curled up again afterwards, damp and sated, on top of the covers, hunger ignored in favor of more cuddling and kissing. Neither of them complained.
Cas’ hand comes up to rest on Dean’s cheek, tilts his head slightly to look at him. Dean looks at him, takes in every detail of his face while Cas is still inside him. There’s a burning warmth in his chest, spreading to his stomach, and he puts a hand to the back of Cas' neck and pulls him into a kiss.
He focused his attention on the food, and was thrilled to find a generous piece of medium-rare steak with potatoes and baby carrots. The glass held orange juice, and after taking a sip he was sure it was freshly pressed. The first bite of buttery-soft meat had him moaning like a two-dollar whore, and he grinned around his fork when he heard Cas cough.
"What do you think about a lavender bubble bath?" Cas held up a purple glass bottle, visibly ready to mix Dean the bath of his dreams.
"These were a lot worse yesterday but they healed up well. Do you want some painkillers?" Deean moved to get up but, Cas other hand shot out immediately and grasped at Dean's shirt.
Days go by, a week, two weeks, three weeks. It’s October, Dean was still drunk in the morning from the night before and drank more during the day, but not on days he went to Cas’s house. He brushed his teeth and showered for him, he slipped on a mask and found comfort in Cas’s hugs and laugh, in his lopsided smile and warm hands. Even Hannah was kind to him, when before she had pretty much ignored him whenever she could.
“I’m sorry, I really would’ve come to pick you up, but couldn’t leave the food on the stove,” Dean says.
The cafeteria is pretty empty, and they pick a small table at the windows. The entire front of the cafeteria is glass, and they can watch the street and snow falling. Cas gets a coffee and Dean produces a napkin-wrapped muffin from his jacket and hands it to him.
Comfortable silence falls over the group, and everyone’s looking at the table. Dean peers at Cas and sees him close his eyes and move his lips. When he finishes, Dean looks around and when he sees everyone else looking up, he raises his lemonade bottle.
"So," Cas says, and he looks at Dean like he can't believe he has to explain any further, "I didn't want you to spend tonight alone."
"I don't know," he said, swallowing thickly, "he said he wanted to read and I went to my room and wanted to watch something with him and went to ask him but he didn't reply and I knocked and he didn't say anything so I opened the door and-"
"The screen door opens to the outside too, we could open it, move the big pot over there and then use it as a back rest?
There’s more lingering touches and a few position changes. Then, Cas is on top of Dean, looking into his eyes with his forearms framing Dean’s head as he sinks into him. Dean shudders, and Cas noses at his cheek as he bottoms out.
“No,” Dean said. “At least, not directly. But, can we call more often? Or text? I know you’re busy and that’s why we didn’t really do that, but maybe you can find some time every couple days?”
"Cas?" Sam had jumped out of the shower as soon as he heard a loud noise, a towel wrapped tightly around his hips. He went into the room and walked around the bed where he found Cas in an undignified heap on the floor.
Dean's cooking more, trying out recipes with Cas as his voluntary taste tester. So far Dean's favorite things have been Greek yoghurt bagels and a sweet potato soup. Today there's steaks with a honey barbecue crust on the grill, and he can't wait to eat.
"I'm gonna check this one," Sam said and pointed to the smallest building, "maybe you should take the bigger one behind it and check the small cabin too."
They swim to the shore and get out, grabbing their sun-warmed towels from the grass. Eileen's putting down plates on their picnic table, and the long grass tickles Dean's ankles as he steps up to it to survey what's still missing. Everything's pretty much ready, and as he sees Cas approach with drinks in his hands he sits down.
Cas set the seed packets aside, grabbing a colorful card, and lastly the single condom packet at the bottom.
Cas was sitting on the floor, wearing a pained expession and rubbing his back. When he saw Dean, he gave him and apologetic smile.
Ben and a doctor found them with Cas holding Dean, stroking his hair softly and murmuring about Hannah and his garden. Cas looked up and alerted Dean to their visitors.
“Nest was even bigger than we thought,” someone says. Dean turns and it’s a red-haired guy with a beer belly, and he remembers him as Ron.
"I took a taxi, and Dean will come home with me. So yes, go home Ben. And thank you for your help." Cas and Ben hugged briefly before Ben turned to Dean.
The man behind the door seemed to hesitate with his reply. “Please place the box in front of the cat door.”
Sam rubbed a hand over his face and took out his own phone. "I'm gonna call Crowley, maybe he knows something," Sam declared and stepped outside the room into the hallway, dialing immediately.
"Hello," he said and Dean was momentarily speechless. Cas was wearing black slacks, a blue button down and a fitting black vest. A dark blue tie disappeared under the vest.
He parked opposite Cas's house and walked to the front door. As per usual, it opened before he could knock, and Cas pulled him into a crushing hug. Also as per usual, the hug turned R-rated quickly when lips came into play, and they caught themselves making out with gusto in the half-open front door.
Cas looked down at his hands as he considered the question. When he woke up in the cabin he had barely any memory of what happened, the only thing he was sure of was the fact that he was in a lot of pain. Now, after regaining his healing abilities, his body had recovered a little and he was able to think clearly, which sadly didn't stop the wave of nauseating fear that rushed through him as he recalled everything that happened from the moment he disappeared from the bunker.
The drive is long, but not too much so, and they'll arrive at night. Cas had picked out the motel, interested in the historical part of town they'll be staying in.
They make their way down the paved road that leads to the bunker until they reach the trees. The woods that look like they jumped out of a Christmas card, and they walk slowly alongside each other, heading for a clearing a few minutes away. Dean’s shoulder and arm bump Cas’ every now and then, but neither of them move apart.
Dean pulled away too soon for his own taste, let his forehead rest against Cas's, let Cas’s breath wash over him. Bright eyes met his when he opened them. He felt a trembling hand on his waist and one at the back of his neck.
The café is loud, toasty, and filled with people Dean loves, which is his favorite thing. Sam’s here with Eileen, Bobby and Charlie are chatting to and serving up Ellen. Jo is talking to Ash, and they’re laughing loudly together. There are so many friends he considers family that there’s barely any space left to move around. He looks at the clock and sees that Cas must be coming soon, so he disappears briefly to fix his hair and switch shirts. Everyone’s having drinks and appetizers, and Dean’s happy no one minds waiting.
"Teenagers," he mumbled as he kicked an empty bottle of beer to the side. Trying to fight down the disappointment, he left the building and kicked the door shut behind him. He turned and saw Sam walking over to the third and biggest warehouse, he apparently didn't have any luck so far either.
Cas noticed him looking, turned his head, and smiled at him. Dean mirrored his expression and they just grinned at each other like idiots.
He opens the door and steps in. A deep breath lets the warm air and humidity flow into him, and pebbles crunch under his work boots.
things, whether it be emotions or that something was made with effort and love. His garden and job spoke of it, and he treated every living thing with care and respect. He had done so with Dean, and he was immensely grateful that Cas had decided he was worth the effort.
“It was a long day, and we’re both supposed to be in at six tomorrow morning,” Cas mumbles as he clumsily gets up.
He didnt't really know why he said that. Fittingly, Cas' reply took a lot longer than before. Dean got up, took a shower and after getting dressed, went to make breakfast. Sam was nowhere to be found, but Dean figured he was probably out running errands. After he sat down at the kitchen table with his second cup of coffee, Cas finally wrote back.
"You gonna read?" They walk together, Cas' room-- with a new-ish sofa Dean got for him from Goodwill-- just a few doors down from Dean's own room.
Both of them gradually became more out of breath, and Dean felt his own cock press against Cas's. He rolled his hips and tasted Cas’s answering shaky exhale. Desperate for more he did it again, and Cas responded in likeness.
Dean nervously sends the message, and busies himself with stirring the pasta sauce, made from scratch after a new recipe. While that’s bubbling happily on the stove, he takes out the other ingredients, and as he’s measuring some sugar, his phone beeps.
Cas looks at the flower in his hand, the lines around his eyes faint and relaxed, as a gentle smile starts sprouting and growing and blooming on his face, until he’s so colorful and radiant Dean’s eyes start to tear up, rooted in place by the immeasurable amount of love for the being in front of him.
“Hi,” Dean mumbled against Cas’s lips, and promptly received another kiss. “Not that I’m complaining, but why so chipper?”
Castiel later tried to find out the name of the boy he ran into by talking to multiple people, but no one knew him.
The door opened a minute later to a very disheveled looking Cas in a sweat-stained green shirt and track pants.
"Yes, I-" Cas interrupted himself before hitting a switch that turned off the string lights and dipped the porch into almost complete darkness. The big candles on the stairs threw blurry mirror images on the entire wall, reaching out but not entirely illuminating what was happening.
Dean smiles at her excitement and squeezes her shoulder briefly. “Yeah, kiddo. Let’s get to work though, or Bobby’ll kill us.”
His left eye was swollen and there was a cut on his browbone, other bruises blooming across his jaw and forehead. There was a gash in his right cheek that dripped blood onto the floor.
“Okay,” Dean said and continued to hobble next to Ben. They slowly made their way to the apartment door where Ben left him for a moment to grab Dean’s phone and wallet as well as a dark blue corduroy jacket (which was actually Cas’s). Ben locked Dean’s door, then together they creeped down the stairs and outside to Ben’s car.
“What about Rowena?” Sam wipes his nose on his sleeve. “Maybe she can help. Maybe we can find something, it’s just a strong healing spell needed, right?” His voice is thick with emotion.
“The skin feels a bit warm, but it’s not painful. They’re mostly terribly dry from the air and disinfectant, so they always look a bit rough.”
"This is my office." Cas pointed to the first closed door. "I have my computer and headset in there, along with some other necessities. I collected some things to create a comfortable environment, since some of the calls I take can be very jarring."
“Everyone from the VSI made a list of their favorite books, so that’s in there,” Dean pointed at the gift bag, “and some other stuff we thought you might like to read. There's also a gift card for a cover because we weren't sure which one you'd like. It's waterproof too, so you can read it in the bathtub."
“Cas...” Dean was about to decline when, again, his stomach rumbled. He sighed. “Only if you're sure, though.”
"Hey buddy," he said softly, carefully bringing a hand to Cas' face but stopping before he could touch him.
you. I didn't know what was wrong, and basically found you passed out on my porch at night. I tried to take care of you as best as I could, but it was difficult.”
"We're not," Sam says, as Cas apologizes. They share a glance and Dean snaps his fingers to get their attention again.
He waits and watches Cas walk to the apartment complex, unlock the door and disappear inside, then drives home.
Ben got out the car, opened Dean’s door and helped him get up. Together they hobbled towards the entrance, the lights so bright Dean squinted against them as they came closer. The double doors opened with a
Dean nodded before remembering his earlier train of thought. "Hey, you got any plans for your birthday?”
The last ten minutes of the movie are spent like this, and when the credits roll neither of them move.
Cas turned to him and held his hand out. Dean stared at him for a moment, drinking in the sight of him: his flat stomach, the vee of his legs pointing to his soft cock and the muscle packed thighs that framed it. Dean wanted to put his mouth on every inch of him, but for now he took Cas's hand and let himself be guided into the tub. Cas got in behind him, so Dean sat with his back to Cas's chest.
"You wouldn't be alone. Or, at least you wouldn't have to be. You have Sam, you have me. I'm not sure if you still think Sam might leave and do something different, but I can assure you that he would not do so. If you don't believe me on that, then trust me when I say that I would stay." Cas picked up his spoon again and continued eating. Dean stared at him, unsure of what to say. After a few minutes, Dean cleared his throat and mumbled a quiet thanks.
Sam laughed and looked at Cas. "Guess there is my answer," he said and slung his arm around Cas' shoulders. "Let's make some food!"
His brother was sitting at the table, measuring something and scribbling down notes. Dean sat down on the chair across from him and took a sip of his drink. After fiddling around with his glass for a few minutes, he sighed and put it on the table.
Bursts of color are everywhere. He looks at the pink roses to his left and sees the yellow and white dahlias behind them, spots the light green ivy with its white blooms winding around the support beams under the ceiling. A thick red strawberry bobs in the gentle breeze to the right of the open door, and Dean gently parts the leaves to check how many other berries there are.
He saw Castiel wringing his hands in his lap. Dean didn't know him very well (yet, his brain added), but he could tell there was something there. Something Castiel wasn't telling him. Dean's best guess was that it had something to do with their current topic, and since he had spent his life being disapproved of by his dad, he wanted to offer any type of understanding or support he could.
They carry the boy to the car and drive him to the hospital. After a crying mother in their arms and a pat on the shoulder from the officer they’re heading to the motel. The drive is quiet. Cas is wringing his hands in his lap and during almost silent moments, where only the blinker’s
"I'm glad you trust me enough to change your frankly unhealthy habits," Cas replied and Dean laughed.
Cas gave him a bashful smile and led the way into the kitchen. He dodged Hannah, who had chosen a nap spot in the middle of the living room floor, and pointed to one side of the room. "I thought we could sit on the porch, but I don't have a table. If you help me carry this out, we can sit at it together. I would have done it on my own, but my back has been hurting and I didn't want to strain it too much."
“Technically only my brother is family of those people,” Dean says. “But who cares about blood? Family doesn’t end there.”
His heart pounds as he pulls out the creased Zillow listing he printed out, and holds it out to Cas without looking at him.
Dean looked at his brother for a split second before stepping forward and enveloping him into a bonecrushing hug. Sam's arms immediately went around his brother's shoulders and he held on tightly. Their hug lasted for a few seconds with Cas smiling at them, proud of Dean for overcoming his anger and deciding to let it slide in favor of ending their argument.
Cas huffed. “Well, next time please do. I'm here if you need me, but I need to know if you do. Otherwise I can't help you.”
Cas just smiled at him before grabbing his hand and leading him to the couch. They both sat down and Cas showed Dean the open page on his laptop.
The ride was quiet and smooth. The music played softly and Dean stared at the city lights flying past the tinted windows. He was uncomfortably aware of his slight BO, but Cas had been adamant that he wouldn't care. Hopefully he would still think that way.
“There was a gay bar here a couple of years ago. It wasn't open for long, you can probably imagine why. I was a regular there, not because of potential partners, but just to be able to exist somewhere safely and without judgment.
Cas's voice was rough from sleep. He stepped behind Dean and slid his arms around Dean's waist, pulling him close. He peppered Dean’s shoulder with butterfly soft kisses. Dean hummed and goosebumps rose over his skin. He turned around and kissed Cas fully, not minding morning breath in the slightest and just adoring how Cas smelled like warmth and sleep.
Dean takes another sip of his Margiekugel. He's been on the laptop browsing Netflix for half an hour, bouncing his leg under the kitchen table while he discards every option after only a glance.
Dean had been slowly putting money towards fixing small things with the Impala to get her ready for the long drive, had considered asking Cas to come with him in a brief moment of complete insanity. He hadn’t mentioned any of it to Sam yet, but it hurt him deeply that it had apparently been for nothing.
“I’ll happily help them out,” Cas says. ”And when we finish the big greenhouse we could cater to a winter wedding if they change their mind.”
Dean could do little but nod enthusiastically, and Cas smirked at him. Cas got up and walked to his dresser, rummaged around and joined Dean with a dark red squeeze bottle. “Cherry lube,” Cas said and Dean laughed breathlessly. Cas sucked Dean back into his mouth, and his now wet fingers retraced their earlier route but continued until finding Dean's hole. A careful press and Cas's index finger found its way inside, and Dean lost it before he could warn Cas. With a string of embarrassing moans he came down Cas's throat, his hands flying to Cas's head to hold on for dear life.
Dean took his flashlight in hand again and opened the door completely and stepped inside. He was right, the warehouse was empty. One corner held a few disgusting looking pillows and a few cigarette butts littered the ground, the windows behind it were broken and let a lot of moonlight in.
“I was afraid to, but I'm glad I did. I trust you,” Cas added and Dean felt warmth flooding his chest.
Dean slowly started shampooing Cas' hair, working slowly to not pull on it while he tried his best to disentangle the strands that were still stuck together. When he was done with the back, he tapped Cas' shoulder.
"Yup," Dean says and takes a too-big bite of his sandwich. Cas looks up as he's trying to shove the tomato slice in that's attempting to escape, and he makes a weird noise. Dean chews and looks and sees him smile, sparkling eyes and all.
He has a guess on what’s happened. It wasn’t a good day for anyone when they realized Bobby’s PTSD could get triggered from a few mundane things, but Dean and Sam helped him through and because of this, Dean’s pretty confident in helping Cas.
"There was a convenience store that had only a kid working there. I knew where the cameras were, or I guess I thought I knew. I stole bread and peanut butter and two bananas, crammed it all into my hoodie and walked out. The next day the police were at my door." Dean turned his head back and stared up at the starry sky.
Carefully he steps out of the tub and onto the cool tiles, and holds a hand out for Cas, who takes it and loses his smile suddenly.
“Dean,” Cas says gently. “Why would we need one? We do most of our work in the bunker, and the rest at the laptop downstairs together.
"Yes," Cas chimed in. "Kelly. And. Nephilim business." Cas averted his eyes and studied his hands, a faint blush coloring his cheeks. Dean just raised an eyebrow and laughed.
He hung up, dropped the phone on the couch and groaned, his head in his hands. Smooth was something different, but he got it done. And now he had something great to look forward to.
Sam chuckled and slid his computer over the table towards Dean. "You should check some news sites for anything about Kelly. Also.. I think you need more sleep?"
Dean's grip on Cas' arm felt like vice-like, the hunter barely able to contain his anger at hearing about his friend's abuse. Cas' eyes were glassy, he had turned to stare at a point somewhere in the softly swaying grass. A mild breeze had picked up, flowing over the clearing and both men like a whisper, bringing the distinct smell of pine needles and dirt.
Warm wetness left his face damp in the night breeze. Someone lifted his head and soothing, cool liquid filled his mouth. He swallowed it obediently. A soft, deep, familiar voice said,  “Oh, Dean.”
"Ugh. Hold on," the clerk said and went into the back room again. He came back out a minute later with a set of fresh towels in his arms and handed them to Dean.
“I'll unlock the gate. I'll come back here to tell you when you can come in. I'll wait at the back door.”
they’re kissing, and Dean doesn’t want to stop. So they don’t. They hug close, hold each other, lips slotted together.
A quick prayer to Cas sends his plan of attack. They’re using a model they’ve done before: Dean and Sam will go in first, and Cas will quietly do the job in the shadows, then join them again afterwards. Dean nods to Sam, shows two fingers, then one, and Sam nods back. Dean raises his weapon, pulse elevated, senses sharp as they can be.
"Afternoon,", the cashier lady smiled, "you remodeling the house? 'Cause if you are I'd offer you our card, you'll get 20% off your next purchase of furniture or textils."
“I kinda,” Dean says, and has to swallow before continuing. “I kinda always wanted kids. Never talked about it, ’cause usually that’s not something you get to have when you’re a Winchester. But everything’s changed, and I know fostering isn’t the same, but I really want to. I think about those kids and it makes me think of me ’n’ Sam, and Sonny, and how much we needed help. I want to help.”
He flung the book across the room, stumbled over a shoe, and hurt his knee falling down. What felt like years later, he got back up and stumbled into the living room, bumped into half-full moving boxes and collapsed on his sofa. A mostly fully whiskey bottle sat next to him, on the cushion he sometimes imagined Cas on if he would be able to visit him. He took a swig, then another, one more.
"It's brighter here than usual, but I thought I could turn the lights off? If you don't mind eating in the dark, that is." Cas sounded unsure.
"You saved me," Dean continues, because Cas is looking stunned. "So many times, in so many ways. That day—" he stops, swallows, looks away. His eyes burn and they find Cas again to remind himself he's with him, and Cas squeezes his hand. "I hated myself for not saying what I needed to."
It takes another two minutes for Cas to reply again, and Dean sniffs the tiny vial of vanilla flavouring.
“I feel like you might be tired,” Dean says and gently nudges Cas, who sits back up and looks at Dean with slightly bloodshot eyes.
Cas didn't mention that instead of purely physical torture they immediately bombarded his mind with visions of Sam getting hurt, of Dean dying and Cas losing the only family he had left in the entire universe that loved him and accepted him even after everything he had done. He gnawed at his bottom lip and looked back up at Sam.
“Fuck you, dude. My glass house if perfectly fine, thank you very much.” They both laughed and Gabe wiped away the tear tracks on his face.
“Likewise, Dean. Now let me explain a few things. I know why you’re here, but I’m not gonna treat you like an unruly child. You’re an adult and there’s a reason you did the things that landed you here. I asked for a report and background info, for safety purposes. As you’re very well aware, we work with veterans. I can’t afford to have a kid with anger issues. I trust you to not antagonize any of the people here. Follow me.” Ben started walking towards the right wall of the main room, which held another closed door.
The food was gone within half an hour, both men hungry from a long day. The wine glasses were drained and refilled before Dean cut himself off to be able to drive later.
“Fuck,” Dean murmured and dropped down to sit on the porch, his back to the door and hugging his legs.
"It's fine Cas," he said and took the towel away. Cas looked up at him through half open eyes, his dark hair sticking up wildly.
Dean looked over at his friend and saw the blush creeping over his cheeks. He chuckled and leaned over Benny's shoulder.
Cas smiles at his hands. “We can use whichever ones you like. I’m not gonna make cookie rules in someone else's house.”
“I’ve seen the gardening books on Sam’s Kindle, and he told me they aren’t his,” Dean says gently. “You can do whatever you want with the space.”
"Hey, look at me. Cas." The angel flicked his eyes to Dean's face, a second and then third tear making their way down his cheeks. The hunter wiped them away with his thumbs, a pained look on his face as he tries to grasp the amount of pain that Cas must have gone through and is apparently still trying to deal with.
"What time is it?" Cas asks after a while, his voice a low rumble. He pulls out the small champagne bottles and sets them in the snow next to their feet.
is breaking the stillness, Dean can hear his uneven breathing. The dark corn fields fly past them as Dean tries to find something, anything, to say. The traumas they just had to relive, seeing the physical embodiment of what their pain in these moments looked like—he doesn’t know how to deal with any of it.
"You should put this on. We still have some spare clothes in the car but they'll be clammy from laying in there during the night and my shirt is still warm."
"It's not," Dean says. The words are on his tongue, heavy like molasses and just as sweet. He forces them forward, uses every muscle he has, let's them roll over his tongue and fly free. "I love you."
Ah, so that’s why his foot hurt. Dean watched Ben take his sock off carefully, then lift Dean’s foot to examine it.
Dean nods. Past-Dean cries. He screams at the pyre, curses and yells and stops and starts all over again. Sam has his arm around him. Jack is waiting in the back, unobtrusive, but Dean
Dean closed his eyes against the guilt of letting Cas down, of worrying him this much. He couldn’t help but imagine if the roles were reversed, and he felt the fear for Cas’s health like a stab to his heart.
Dean's neglected cock gave an excited twitch, and he let himself be maneuvered onto his back. Cas immediately got to work and sucked and bit several impressive marks on Dean's neck and chest. He let his lips glide over Dean's stomach while pinching his nipples softly, and Dean responded with a deep, deep groan. Cas's mouth traveled downwards, passed by his belly button and found his painfully hard cock. Without any hesitation he licked up precome before swallowing him down. His nose was pressed to Dean's untrimmed pubes, and Dean felt self conscious about them but ignored it when Cas ran his fingers through them on his way to his sac. He didn't stop there however, but oh so slowly let his finger move further down. Cas gave him time to say no, but Dean just spread his legs more and tried not to move his hips too much. Cas was treating his cock with the same amount of concentration and passion that he applied to everything he cared about, and Dean felt special to be added to that list. A press against his perineum had him gasping for air, and Cas massaged the spot briefly before moving further back. He pulled off and looked at Dean intently.
Dean breathed deeply before hitting the call button. One ring, two, three...he was losing the bravery he had scraped together moments before, but then Sam picked up on the eighth ring.
Cas swallows and looks to the floor. “You were dreaming of Hell. Alistair was there, and you felt helpless, but I never came, so you—”
"I'm gonna be rude and stop you right there, buddy. I don't give a rat’s ass what you look like, alright?"
They hold it for longer than Dean would normally hug people, and when Cas pulls back his hair tickles Dean’s cheek.
“We’re going to Urgent Care. Do you have some flip flops maybe? Don’t think you can get your foot into a shoe like that.” Ben started looking around, but Dean shook his head no.
As Cas grabs for the water, Dean sees how red the skin on his hands is. Their coffee isn’t hot enough to injure, but it’s still hot enough to hurt a bit.
“No idea,” Gabe replied and looked at Dean with sad eyes. “Inias called me and told me about it. He found him apparently, but it was too late and he couldn't do anything. I knew him and Inias had an argument a year ago or so because he found cocaine or something in Alfie's room, but I didn't know it was an ongoing thing. I should have known. How could I not have seen that? I should've-”
While munching on the delicious cookie, he watched Cas take off his shoes and strip off his socks. He pointed to Dean's feet. "Feel free to do the same. Being barefoot after wearing shoes for many hours while doing physical labor is divine."
“I'm truly sorry to hear that. I wish I had been there for you when you arrived. I found you when I was feeding Hannah before going to sleep, and you scared me. No, don't—” he waved his hand as Dean's face fell.  “I wasn't scared
“Either way,” Dean says. “I don't want to open late. We got an hour, and I want to hear what everyone thinks about the new drinks.”
"I mean, I know bits and pieces of it but other than the fact that she manipulated you? Not really."
"Thank you for telling me. I feel the same way about you. Every day you come here and talk to me has been a good day, and I selfishly wish you'd be here even more often." Cas laid his other hand on top of their joined ones.
“I just got fifty bucks richer,” she says. Sam signs Why?, before looking at Dean and then at his hand.
He takes a step forward, pulls Cas in and hugs him. Their chests press together, Cas' chin is hooked over his shoulder and Dean's right hand finds its way to the nape of Cas' neck, resting on the soft wisps of dark hair already warmed by the sun.
“I’m Benedict Hillen, but you can call me Ben. And please don’t call me ‘sir,’ that just makes me feel old. I’ve lived here in Kansas my whole life, so I’ve known all the people here for decades.”
As soon as Cas was done, Dean took his hand back. Cas let him. After a moment of silence, Dean spoke again.
He hears a car horn beep, and looks behind him to see Sam’s car park next to the Impala, the hybrid looking like an overgrown bug on the grass. Confused he wipes away sawdust from the small countertop in the front left corner and closes the door behind him.
“Maybe you could talk to one of them? I know you looked at people online, but I don’t know how you could explain killing your husband six hundred times to a regular person.”
Dean grins. They look at each other for a moment, before Dean lets his grin fade. There’s something he has to ask, but he dreads it.
"Sour the mood, huh." Dean raised his head to look at Cas. Then, too quick for Cas to stop it, he leaned forward and licked a broad stripe up Cas's cheek. "Dunno," Dean said with a broad grin. "Tastes pretty sweet to me."
Together they whip up the batter in record time, with only minimal accidents such as a few pieces of eggshell in Cas’ hair and flour on Dean’s shirt. Cas apologizes and says his hand hurts today, so Dean does most of the rolling out of dough.
Dean hesitated, before asking something that had been on his mind for a while. "Hey, uh, you know I'm doing my community service hours with the VSI, right?"
“I'd obviously still just sit here,” Dean hurried to add. “I don't mind it, and I'm not gonna push you or anything. I want to be your friend, and I'm gonna respect your boundaries.”
“I’ll call my doctor later,” Dean says. He swaddles the muffin in snowflake patterned napkins. The coffee machine is still working, so he leans on the counter.
Sam gets out and waves. Dean lifts an eyebrow and shrugs, as if to say ‘what are you doing here’. Sam just grins. The passenger door opens, and as soon as he sees a dress shoe and the corner of a trench coat Dean falls to his knees.
Sam went and picked up the phone, turned it on to check for anything new. No messages, no missed calls or emails. Frowning, he switched it from silent mode to vibration in case Cas would receive a message that could help them..
"Good?" Cas's voice was teasing; he knew how tense and exhausted Dean was after long shifts. At Dean's answering hum, Cas relocated his skilled fingers to Dean's shoulders and kneaded into them with vigor. Dean nearly purred, pressing his back into Cas and smiling to himself.
Cas beamed at him. "I'm glad you like it. I spent a lot of time putting this room together, and I really do love being in here."
Got a ghoul case roughly six hours from here. Will probably be back in two or three days. Don't eat all the sugar, you'll get cramps again. - S
"We're just worried if you're really okay," Sam says carefully. "I guess we both thought you'd be more badly hurt. We're just glad?"
Dean floored it the second they got onto the highway. If what they saw on the news was really about Cas, they needed to get there as soon as possible. Who knows what condition he was in, if he needed help or if he had someone with him.
Dean nodded and messily folded up the timetable. If he was honest, he wasn’t too happy to do house visits, but he didn’t really have the grounds to complain about it. At least not in his first week.
Matt’s bed has whale stickers applied around it, since they’re his favorite animal. Alec asked for a skateboard, and Dean saved a couple of Reddit posts from people DIY-ing a small skate ramp in their backyard.
"May I?" He pointed towards Cas' chest where Sam's flannel had slipped down a little, exposing a lightly bruised shoulder. Cas nodded.
Cas takes a step towards him, then another. He’s fully invaded Dean’s personal space, the harsh ceiling light throwing sharp shadows across his face.
The ER had looked ordinary, but up here there were so many string lights, fir branches and decorations. He makes his way down what seems to be the main hallway and finds the nurses station. No one’s there, and he waits awkwardly.
“I’ll call her later to see if she needs help,” Dean says. “Thanks guys. Let us know if you need anything besides grub and sleep.”
Cas stiffens for a beat before relaxing again. The movie continues. The popcorn bowl is in Dean’s lap since they’re too close now for any space between them. A few times they reach in at the same time, and Dean’s heart flutters a bit at the ridiculous rom-com-ness of it. He loves it.
“You’re an incredible sap,” Dean says. Cas shakes his head but his expression is soft, and he gently stands up. Dean feels boneless, watches Cas bring him a washcloth, and lets him clean him up. The cloth lands on the floor with a wet thud, and Cas pulls the blanket over them.
"They even talked, sometimes." A small tear dropped onto Cas' cheek. Annoyed, he wiped it away. Dean turned toward his friend more fully, grasping his face in both of his hands and searching for his gaze.
Dean got up and shoved the envelope into his leather jacket’s pocket. On his way outside he dodged several wads of bubble gum on the floor and did his best to not look at anyone. He made his way across the parking lot, momentarily distracted by Abby driving by in a small red Porsche.
“No! No it’s not,” Dean hurried to say. “I really just wanted to ask if there’s something I need to know, like if he needs anything or something like that.”
“Anyway,” Dean said. “I don’t know if I can come out for Christmas, but I will definitely come visit in the spring. I want to figure my shit out first here and—hold on, why weren’t you surprised when I said Cas is my boyfriend?”
Last was the master bedroom, huge and more stunning than Dean ever imagined. A king-sized bed with matching bedside tables, and slim floor to ceiling windows flanking the bed. The entire room is light, creamy colors with rich wooden furniture, a spacious closet, and a balcony door. The view from the balcony overlooks the woods, and the lake is off to the left. It's a little crowded, with a bench and a couple dozen potted plants, but it's got a roof, so they can sit out there even when it's raining.
"Let's go to bed. If you want an actual massage I can do it much better there." Cas stroked Dean's cheek, turned his head slightly to kiss him. Dean licked into his mouth and happily filed away Cas's surprised little moans for future reference.
Cas looks at him, really looks at him. The warm bedside lamp makes his eyes more cerulean than their usual ocean blue, and Dean gets lost in them for a beat. He exhales loudly and sits on the bed. After a moment’s hesitation, Cas joins him.
"I'm okay now. Or, at least physically. I don't really know what went wrong in my head, but I'll try and be more careful. I promise." Dean said squeezed Cas's hand quickly. "I'll be more careful. Tim, that's the one that saved my ass, he offered to drive me home but I didn't want to go. Home is a shitty, empty apartment in the bad part of town."
. There’s fire that glimmers down to a groundwork warmth, enveloping everything Dean’s feeling. It lays over the ache in his muscles, the pain of his wounds, the agony of his mind. It soothes despite its ability to ignite, choosing this time to heal and comfort. He lets it wash over him fully.
Cas walked towards him and reached out. Dean let him touch his arm, but he pulled back after a moment. He shook his head and ignored how bright Cas’s eyes were, ignored the burn of his own tears. With long strides he walked to the door, ignored Cas calling after him, walked to his car, drove away. He figured he’d start trying to sell some of his stuff soon, get some cash in. At some point he pulled over, fought against tears, then continued to drive to his apartment.
He paddles around, floating on his back, and then flinches as strong arms suddenly close around his waist and pull him under. Sputtering he turns, resurfaces with Cas' arms around his neck.
They hadn’t been able to reach Jack since he defeated Chuck and became God. When they started researching, Dean knew it would take a long time; there’s no easy fix for hard things. But the many tries have been enough for him.
“What is it with this dude,” Dean mumbles to himself as he walks back into the shop and locks the door behind him.
They smile softly at each other and finish their meal. When Charlie and Sam bring out the desserts, Cas asks Dean to share a generous slice of cherry chocolate cake. They bring their chairs a little closer, each of them with a fork digging into the creamy dessert. Their knees bump, and Dean nudges Cas’ calf, and Cas nudges right back.
“And you must be Andrea. Benny hasn't shut up about you since you started dating. Figured the reason would be that you're way too attractive for him,” he said and Benny shot him an amused look. Andrea just laughed and shook her head.
Cas and Dean both laughed. Within a minute everyone had a massive piece of cake on their plate, Dean had frosting on his face already, and Ben was laughing so hard that Hannah fled from under the table.
Cas nodded and squeezed Dean’s hands tightly. He looked like he wanted to run, and Dean considered their options. The door to the garden was closed, though it was clearly used for guests as well. Small seating groups were outside, a bit hidden with the small trees and flowers in between. He flagged down their waitress.
"First of all Dean, I'm not a child anymore, and second, I'm not ignoring anything! The woman who did this isn't here anymore and I feel like they are genuine with what they want. Wouldn't you want to hunt less? Wouldn't you sleep better knowing there are far less monsters out there?" Sam sighed. "Look, we can't be everywhere at the same time Dean, and you know it! People will always die because of monsters we failed to see early enough, but with the help of Mick, Ketch and the others we might actually be able to completely exterminate some monster groups. Isn't that more important than being angry at them and not helping?"
"No! No, I'm not busy. I was just surprised, usually you text before you call. I just finished up my evening shift. It was quiet today so I'm still up. Are you feeling okay?" Cas's voice carried warmth and Dean relaxed as he let it wash over him.
That night Dean showers for a long time. He uses Cas’ vanilla scented body scrub, lets the hot water flow over his back as he drags his hands over his cock, between his legs and his fingers find his hole. There’s a bit of hesitancy as he slides a finger inside himself, but his mouth falls open on a quiet moan. Resiliently he doesn’t touch his cock, just enjoys getting himself worked up and turned on until he absolutely has to get out and touch Cas, be touched by Cas.
"I'm sure he's only doing it because he cares about you. He wants you to be safe," Cas said and Dean scoffed at that.
Time spent at his apartment was pretty much never comfortable, or nice. An empty fridge was a staple of any Winchester home, along with an outdated kitchen with lime green cabinets, a third-hand couch with questionable stains and a cheap wooden bed frame holding a mattress so thin Dean woke up with a hurting back every other day. The part of town he lived in was generally considered cheap, unsafe and for the desperate. Even for his area, his apartment was lucky. He had a bedroom, a tiny bathroom and a small living room with an open kitchen. He usually just ate on the couch or standing up leaning against the counter, just like right now. Munching a bowl of off-brand cheerios with milk that was just this side of off. He polished off the bowl within five minutes, rinsed it and just left it in the sink. He put on his non-work boots and headed out.
When the credits start rolling at just after eleven Dean stretches and curls into Cas. A kiss on Cas' neck, slightly salty from the day's sweat, makes Cas turn towards him. He noses Dean's cheek, catches his lips and Dean leans into it. Their makeout session is cut short by Cas pulling back to yawn.
"Are we underdressed? I feel like we're underdressed." Ben raised an eyebrow and nodded at Cas. "Suits you well though."
Dean texts Sam an update, tells him they’re okay but need to stay the night. After a thumbs-up emoji Dean puts his phone away, pulls back the covers of his bed and slides between the sheets. He groans as his head hits the pillow and he can relax his muscles. He turns his head and eyes Cas awkwardly sitting on the edge of his own bed.
Dean nodded and did as Cas asked. He heard the screen door open, then a plate being set down on the wood. The clank of cutlery, the dull sound of a full glass placed on a hard surface. Again, the door sliding and the rustle of clothes.
to a love confession. “For trying to help me, I mean. I know I’m stubborn, and you didn’t stop trying or cut me out because we fought.” Dean had to pause and breathe, memories of past relationships trying to reach the surface of his mind, but he resolutely shoved them back in their box and stowed them far away.
“Dean, you’re not going to be homeless. You can stay with me.” Cas stroked his thumb over Dean’s cheek. Dean refused to lean into the touch.
The coffee is half splattered in the snow, half on Cas’ gloves and pants. The muffin’s on the ground, smushed as if it’s been stepped on, and he can see Cas’ hands tremble.
“As mentioned earlier, every one of you will have their own task. We have assigned you to one after careful consideration, and you are to complete that task to your full capacity when you’re told to do so.”
The Djinn nods. “You might think that to be the truth, but you’re wrong. I’ve conversed more with your kind than you know. I have a certain skill set that has been valued greatly.”
"Did you just describe gardening and building stuff as fun?" Sam says as he comes in and rinses his mug.
Dean thought about it for a moment. "Do you want to dress up and sit here and maybe I could bring my really shit laptop and we could eat and watch a movie? Cuddle in the dark, all that?" Dean tightened his hold on Cas's hand, who squeezed back.
Dean sighed. No matter how fucked up everything seemed to be, that familiar greeting would always feel like home to him.
"Has the brilliant Castiel forgotten the ability to speak in full sentences?" Dean teased and felt Cas tense up. "I'd love to go on a date with you. There's absolutely no doubt about it, but how do you want to do it?"
“Thank you for inviting me over again,” Cas says, and his voice parts the comfortable silence. “It was lovely.”
There’s two more. First, the lily of the valley, its creamy white bells hanging heavily over the edge of their pot. “You’ve made my life complete.”
Sam cleared his throat. "Yeah, Dean told me about Naomi. Not a lot but he said that they used us against you and Cas.. why did you never say anything? We could have helped you get through that, but you never mentioned it. Why?"
"Me too," he said. "My dad, or Sam. Sometimes my mom too. Can be pretty fucked up, and I don't love having them."
"I.. think I got this," he said as the pants dropped to the floor. He stood up again, this time without help and slipped his fingers underneath the waistband of his boxers, then started to pull them down.
"Are you sure he is nowhere else? Did you maybe miss a note somewhere?" Sam let go of Dean and stepped into the room, looking at everything in more detail. Nothing seemed out of the ordinary. There was a small green book open on the couch, the lamp on the table beside it was on and dipped the room into a soft glow.
The bank oh so kindly informed him of their changed policies, that they required a new minimum balance to be kept in his account that he couldn’t uphold even in a good month, and threatened higher monthly charges. The twenty dollars he had been able to save for luxuries like fast food were gone now.
Dean shook his head. "I mean it. No shits given. I like you for you, not because of your cute nose or whatever. So yeah, I don't care. White wine or red?"
A flurry of movement and a wet tearing noise, and then Cas’ dagger is sticking out of the Djinn’s chest. The Djinn turns to grin at Cas before pulling it out and dropping it.
"Yes Cas, I'm here," Dean lied his hand on top of Cas', softly stroking over it with his thumb. "I'm here and you're safe."
Guilt and horror flooded his mind. He was bringing all this into Cas’s safe haven, unasked, unpromoted and without permission. A tear leaked from his eye, then another and another, dripping onto his grease-smeared hands. Soon his shoulders shook with the overload of emotions. He had nowhere to put them and so he held on tight through the tidal wave that crashed into him.
A nurse interrupted his musings, brought him for an x-ray of his hand, and someone else checked his head for more serious injuries. He was deemed mostly fine and deposited in his own little bay with Ben sitting on a chair next to him, thumbing through his phone.
Sam sighed. "Good that he woke up. I'm sure he'll be actually awake soon, although I keep wondering if we should try to give him some food or water. When he was hurt before that kinda helped I think," Sam said and walked over to their stash of band aids, gauze wraps and produced a small water bottle from the bag that usually held all their supplies.
Then, it’s the white violets. Dean let’s go of Cas’s hand, crouches down and picks one bloom. He gently opens Cas’ fingers, lets the flower rest in his warm palm.
"Let's go." Cas just hummed in reply, carefully stepping around the bed, led by Dean. Sam had already opened the door for them and was outside stuffing their bag into the Impala. When he saw them approach he quickly opened the car's back door, then slammed the trunk shut and walked over to stand next to the open door.
Dean laughed and gave him a playful "Bitch" in response. He took his glass again and finished his lemonade in a few long gulps.
Castiel checked his wrist watch and sighed. The introduction the university offered was already almost over and he had wanted to be as early as possible for it, but several mistakes from the dorm manager had led to him being late. He hated being late.
“Good evening,” the Djinn says. His tattoos are golden, swirling with black and red, and glowing. “I wondered when you were coming.”
"I don't give a flying fuck Sammy. Will you measure the pasta so we can get on with this?" Dean fidgeted around with the package of spaghetti before giving up and throwing it into Sam's direction, who caught the half open paper carton easily. While he went to work measuring everything on the kitchen table, Dean and Cas continued cutting up everything that had to be cut up in any way.
He exited his building and promptly bumped into someone and landed on his ass. A hand shot forward and Castiel gratefully took it, pulling himself up and facing the other person. A student with dark blonde hair, freckles and green eyes studied him with a slight smirk.
I finally understand how other authors often are just unable to follow their schedule. it's either life, inspiration or something else that's going on :P anyways, i hope you enjoy this chapter, it was a lot of work and i'll see you soon <3
“You’re an amazing artist,” Castiel said and Pamela walked over to him. Standing next to her, and without the strong smells of other people, he noticed her dark floral perfume and involuntarily took a small step away from her.
Dean’s swinging the broom handle around like he’s dancing with it, Christmas music is blaring and Charlie jumps around the tree while putting up the Star Wars ornaments. There are pine needles on the floor and it smells heavenly, like forest and wood and coffee and cinnamon.
Dean got out of the car, locked it and walked to their room. He had to go back two times because he had forgotten to buy one of the things on his list since he was incredibly distracted. He kept thinking about what had happened to Cas, he didn't know if he could've done something to prevent it and worst of all, he had no idea how to help his best friend. Cas had always been incredibly private about his struggles and it often came to a shock to Dean how much he really had to be suffering. He himself was no stranger to John Winchester's 'lock it up'-mentality, yet he hoped every time that Cas or his brother would not follow him in that, that they would talk about their issues so Dean could help them.
The density of plants grew less until he stepped on grass. It was longer than a lawn, and daisies blinked at him every few steps. It smelled like earth, like roses and nature, and Dean loved the feeling of calm he felt wash over him. He had never been in a garden like this; the parks in the city were sparsely planted and always showed a severe lack of love and creativity.
Dean was surprised that no one heard the tear going through his heart when Cas asked this. He had been fully not expecting to get anything, would've been content just with Ben and Dean showing up.
“What a bummer that you planted all those,” Dean says. “But now I’ll expect a bouquet of them next summer whenever your hard working husband comes home from work.”
Eileen sits down across from Dean, and Sam walks over with everything that had been on the grill. Cas nudges aside the vase filled with dark red dahlias to make space for the big serving plate, and soon they eat.
blood, his friend's blood. His friend that was hurt and needed his help. Grimacing, he threw the towel into a corner with much more force than necessary and stepped back into the main room.
“He said you’re good people.” Dean leans back a bit, angles himself more to Cas. “That was enough for me. Why are you so worried?”
Before he got out of the car, he checked if his hair looked fine and prayed that there were no stains or holes on his henley he had missed. Only then did he get out and walk up to the door.
Cas looked so serious that Dean was concerned for a moment, before seeing Ben's mock stare back at him. His eyes flicked to Dean for a second and he winked before staring at Cas again.
With his other hand, Dean reached out to Cas' spread fingers, softly tracing a pattern on the palm of his hand. After a few seconds, Cas' hand began to shift and was pulled back. Dean chuckled quietly, he knew Cas was ticklish there from the time the angel had cut himself during cooking and Dean took a look at it, He couldn't stop squirming the whole time Dean tried to clean the cut.
“Then I invite you to not crumble over my chair.” Cas raised an eyebrow, but the hint of a smile played around his lips.
Dean's heart surged at the suggestions. He ached to be physically close to Cas. Holding Cas or being held by him was a balm, and he was just glad that Cas loved cuddling and physical affection as much as he did.
The crinkle of Cas’ jacket and the blinker clicking are the only noises for a few breaths before the light turns green and they drive on. A few minutes later Dean parks in front of Cas’ apartment complex. He turns the engine off and quietness falls over them.
"Nah, it's fine. I'm sorry, I didn't bring the wine. I forgot it at home," Dean said and felt guilt seep into his stomach.
They re—pack their bags in the morning. It's almost noon before they get into the car, the weather clear but not sunny.
He wonders if building a greenhouse would be too much, but he holds onto the idea for wanting to create something for Cas to come home to. The expression he imagines on Cas’s face is what spurs him on, and he starts planning.
Cas is looking at him with the same soft smile he gave him, back when he told Dean three words he'd never dreamed of hearing from him. Dean doesn't want to disappoint him, hurt him, let him down. He starts with something safe.
Dean had muscles. Years of hunting shaped his body, he wasn't someone you would find on a fitness magazine; but his upper body was well formed by hard muscle, made for carrying things and not to look good.
Dean did his best to put the mask on, to cement his features into someone that people would trust and take seriously. He nodded.
“Cas this is—” Dean interrupted himself. Nothing that came to mind could describe what Cas had created.
The university advertised a lot of student clubs and Castiel was interested in quite a lot of them, the history club he signed up for first being one of his favorites.
Dean made them grilled cheese and tomato soup while Cas studied the fridge's contents. Holding a package of microwaveable fries in one hand and a can of soda in the other, he turned to Dean. "If you continue your diet like this, you'll suffer from high cholesterol and it's side effects when you're older," he said. Dean shrugged.
), and his foot throbbing for some reason. Had there been cutlery on that plate? He couldn’t remember. One victory though, was that his phone was right next to his face. He grabbed it with his left hand and ignored the pain searing through it as he tapped half-blindly. When he heard the ringing tone, he sighed.
The angel had migrated towards him during the night, facing away from him but his back was arched towards Dean and one arm was thrown in his direction, his hand grazing the fabric of Dean's pants.
“This was after I left. After our fight,” the Cas next to him says. Dean looks at him from the side, sees the defeated look on his face as he watches the scene unfold.
“He OD'd,” Gabriel almost whispered after a few minutes and Dean felt like his stomach just fell out of his ass. Alfie had drug problems?
"It's a big vamp nest in Creston, Wyoming. Too much for the two local hunters, so they need backup. We can pick up some supplies at the bunker and you can just join then? I don't think we need two cars."
“And here I thought I had found my way to your heart at last. I’m sorry, I won’t bother you any more than necessary. Until next week.” Dean saluted the peephole and walked back towards his car.
As it gets fully dark their string lights turn on. They're woven through the bookshelves flanking the couch, creating a web of warm stars over the ceiling and fading out where the hallway starts.
From the corner of his eye, Dean sees Cas run his hand over his face roughly. He collects a monumental amount of bravery and slowly lays his hand on Cas’ forearm while continuing to watch the road. He can feel Cas’ muscles tense briefly before relaxing again. They drive in silence.
Walking towards the building makes the hairs on Dean's arms stand up. It feels vulnerable; even though most likely every vampire in that building isn't paying attention, it still feels wrong to just.. walk up. No matter how many times they've done it in the past.
“You’re going to ruin your health, you’re going to get worse and I will not stand here and do nothing. I know people that can really help you, and you should accept that help. You need to change some things if you want to get healthy again, which I know you do. Please.”
Cas's hand on his back tightens, and when they pull back once again it slides and rests on his neck. Dean's intimately aware how Cas must be able to feel his pulse hammer under his fingers, and Dean tries to swallow his nerves. Cas saves him, again.
Cas beams at that. "Sam brings me some small ones sometimes, when he goes to the grocery store. Most of them I've pulled from seeds and then I repot them into something else. They take the bunker's air surprisingly well."
Dean held onto this, trying to navigate out of the gloom. His head felt a bit clearer, and he let his arm sink back to his side. Tim was crouching next to him, concern written clearly on his face.
"Yes, everything was fine," Cas replied quickly, then frowned. "I would appreciate you not insulting my car though. Crowley has certainly done enough of that during our time together."
He inched closer, his nose meeting Cas's and nudging him feathery light. He could feel Cas's every exhale ghost over his lips, could taste the residual sweetness of the wine.
"You had plenty of pillows offered to you; you just never took them." Cas made his way up the dark wooden stairs, a bit creaky and with art prints lining the wall to the right. Watercolor pictures of flowers mostly, with a couple animals in between. The pastel colors contrasted the rough wood around them, and Dean really liked it. Everything seemed so deliberate, care and love in every detail of the house.
Dean looks at Cas, whose hand is poised on the dagger’s handle in his coat, and after a nod slowly pulls the door open. After a protesting squeak from the hinges they’re inside, stepping around broken glass and dented cans, the smell of moldy beer hanging thickly. They make their way through a small maze of collapsing shelves, full of outdated canned food, and pieces of trash on the ground.
"Seeing you hurt is my worst fucking nightmare, okay? I would have left you alone if I had died back then with Amara and our whole fantastic soul bomb plan, and you would have been alone and I can't stand thinking about that. I can't. They took you and hurt you over and over again because I wasn't quick enough to find you. You were hurt because I was too slow, too wrapped up in the fact that Mom is back, just.. fuck, man. It was too much but YOU were the one who had to pay for it and I hate myself every day for that. For every single time that you got hurt because I didn't do my job right."
“Umm,” Dean replied intelligently and reached into his pocket. His phone was dead. “Guess I didn't charge it.”
Their knees are touching, warm even through fabric. Cas is sitting there open and soft, and with gentleness shining from his kind eyes. Dean’s itching to reach out to him.
Today the snow covers most of it, and he has to wipe it away to have Cas sit next to him. It’s a tight fit for two people, but Dean doesn’t mind.
When he had arrived at Limbo around ten minutes earlier and had weaseled his way around the bouncer outside who had been busy yelling at some snot- nosed kids who definitely weren't 21 yet, he had made his way down the narrow and crooked staircase that led to the basement of the house where the club was situated. The walls of the staircase were decorated with old and faded concert posters of all sorts, hanging crookedly on the naked brick wall, and the stairs themselves were built from dark brown wood just like the rest of the club's floor. The main room of the club was quite large, the wall on the left side had gigantic shelves built into it, displaying hundreds of different kinds of whiskey, beer and other hard liquors. A long bar made of a similar kind of wood as the floor was situated in front of it, ratty bar stools with torn up, dark red cushions sat alongside of it.
“I’m a veteran too,” he says after a few minutes. “I had to stop therapy because I lost my job and insurance. There’s,” Cas swallows, “there are some things I haven’t worked through yet. But I can’t afford help at the moment.”
"Alright. I'll ask the others what they think, and we should be able to make it work. You go and bring Cas the stuff from this week."
Ben grinned at him. "Don't act all shy now, Dean. I've only heard the best things about you from Cas."
"Having her back. Mom, I mean. It's incredible, don't get me wrong, but it's just a lot to take in. I remember her being caring and just always there for me when I was younger, and now.. I don't know, man. I hate to disagree with her and I hate that she has trouble living like this now, with children that aren't babies anymore and I want to DO something, but what? I can't agree with her on something that is against everything I have done my whole life. The one thing I thought I could do, and failed doing so many times." Dean ripped the lose thread out of his jean's seam and threw it into the grass.
"No, I like the candles. Makes it even cozier in here. I ah, just don't want to get your bed dirty. Any chance you got a spare of those?" Dean pointed to Cas's pants.
I'm so sorry this took longer than I planned (again). I lost my motivation a little because I was unsure how to proceed with the story (mainly how to get from point A to point B), but I've figured it out now and this will update quicker.
The community center was a one-story building, painted gray with big windows and its own parking lot. Double doors led him into an airy and open room that had groups of round tables and fitting chairs. There were two televisions in the back corners with a sofa and two armchairs each grouped in front of each. Mismatched bookshelves held a variety of books (yes, really), board games, and DVDs. Countless plants in different pots sat in the room, some small and on a table, others big and green in a corner. It smelled like paper and something flowery that Dean couldn’t quite place. A cool breeze washed over him from one of the vents in the ceiling, cooling his skin from the late may heat. In short, the center looked nothing like Dean had imagined it.
There was one book however, which he did not talk to Dean about. It was a small sort of novel, bound in leather that was dyed in a dark green color and almost falling apart at its spine. It was quite old; Cas guessed it was written sometime in the early second century. It told a story about an angel who dismissed orders and neglected his duties because nothing was more important to him than protecting the human he had been assigned to protect. The human was a young woman. The angel didn't inhabit a vessel in the first years, but merely communicated with her through dreams and thoughts. Later on, the seraph chose a young, strong male vessel and met the human for the first time in the flesh. They fell in love, but when other angels heard of it the woman was killed, since relationships between angels and humans had been cursed since the creation of humanity. Castiel always guessed there were reasons; rules simply didn't come out of nowhere. While reading the story, he couldn't help but be reminded of Dean and himself, how Cas chose the human over and over again, let himself believe in something different than what he had been told in his entire existence.
"It's just hard, you know." The words were spoken softly, almost too quiet to hear even in the silence of the night. Cas would have missed them had he not still been looking at the hunter's face and saw his lips moving.
“Not in the past half an hour or so,” Benny replied and scratched his head. “Last time I saw him he was outside yelling at someone. Dunno who.”
He sees the trench coat flutter, hears loud banging noises, and then his hearing gives out. Cas is kneeling next to him, cradling Dean’s head in his hands. Sam appears next to them and drops down, searches Dean’s body quickly before pressing into his stomach.
“Dude,” Dean says, “Spones? Hello? We got tall, dark and handsome twice, one with sarcasm and one with that quiet sexy thing? Why are we even discussing this.”
Dean shrugged. “They took an x-ray of my hand, said I don’t even have a concussion, just a big fucking egg on my head, and I’m gonna get stitches for my foot.” He wiggled his toes.
When he had been packing up the groceries in the parking lot, Dean had made a decision. From now on he would make a conscious effort to show Cas that he was part of their family. Sure, they've talked about it, Dean called him family, yet there were too little situations where Cas had really been included, because of different reasons.
“My sofa doesn’t have bed bugs,” Cas mumbles as he shuffles away, and Dean relaxes marginally when he hears a door close.
The room's bigger than expected. Two okay—ish doubles, a shabby sofa and everything color coordinated in different tones of blue. The bathroom is an off white, with creaky door hinges, but clean. Dean spots an Applebee's across the street, and drags the others over. They drop into a booth at the window, Dean next to Cas with Cas having the window seat.
“I’m really messed up, Sammy.” Dean wiped at his thankfully dry eyes and shook his head. “I’m messed up and I did some really dumb shit, and I’m going to fix it, but I don’t think I can do it alone.”
“Pay attention to when and where you have to be to complete your tasks. Missing a day unexcused automatically counts as a failed program and you will not have the chance to continue. You are hereby dismissed.”
Sam and Eileen support him as much as they can. Both of them drive over and help him in between research breaks, and he loves them for it.
“Are you still mad at me?” Dean asked Cas, and Ben suddenly got up and walked away mumbling about coffee.
Dean discards every thought about what they would feel like. He opts for asking something productive. “Do you want a new coffee?”
Dean really fought back the tears this time. “Fuck,” he mumbled. All this time he and Sam didn’t communicate because they just assumed the other didn’t want to. If that wasn’t a perfect Winchester family-issue.
“We can maybe even have chickens, and we can find someone to teach you how to have your own beehive. And we’ll have enough space for that gazebo you always talked about.”
"Hey Cas, you wanna see how I make the best sugar-free raspberry lemonade you have ever tasted?" Sam grinned at his friend and went over to the fridge, taking out lemons, raspberries and icecubes.
Both men sat like this, tightly embracing the other, suffering and mumbling soft words of comfort, for minutes, maybe hours. Neither had any concept of time, the most important thing being the presence of the other, grounding each other in that moment of vulnerability.
“Thank you,” Cas says, and he smiles at Dean. “My alarm clock malfunctioned and it didn’t wake me. It was awful,” he says. He hands Dean a crumpled bill and turns to the door.
“Oh my god Sam, no,” Dean interrupted him, and they both grinned. “I’m actually gonna pass out in a minute, but let’s talk about Christmas tomorrow maybe?” Dean suppressed a yawn.
"Why did he not take his phone," Dean mumbled, still fidgeting with Cas' keys. "Why would he leave? He said he wouldn't do that anymore. Not after he almost-" Dean cut himself off and jammed the keys into his back pocket.
Cas takes a half step, looks everywhere, does double takes at a few things. He leans over and peeks behind the strawberries, spotting the raspberries and the tiny cherry tree basking in a particularly sunny spot.
His fingers move, following muscle and warm skin and sliding into soft hair, tangling there to hold on as he tilts his head, and with a gentle bump of their noses their lips find each other.
"You just reminded me of an old family friend. He used to say 'family don't end with blood.'" Dean raised his hand to wipe at his eyes when memories of Bobby and childhoods spent running around in the simmering heat of his salvage yard came to him, but he didn't leave the embrace.
After the interior of the house had been finished, Dean had immediately gotten started on the garden; he wants it done by the time summer hits. He plans on making them a swing he's gonna attach to one of the huge trees close to their house. The flower beds are already filling up, Cas using every minute of the first beautiful days of spring to find different plants. There’s a rosebush next to the stairs leading onto their front porch that he spends the most time on.
A loud groan could be heard from the red-haired bombshell next to Dean, and he smirked. As far as he knew, Abby was here for repeated shoplifting, creating six-figure damage. She also repeatedly cussed out workers and officers in a derogatory manner. Imagining this spoiled brat getting dirty in a forest was amusing.
Cas was standing shirtless and barefoot in his black sweatpants, staring openly at Dean. He shook his head and came closer, sliding his arms around Dean's waist and pressing his face into Dean's neck.
“That’s not how it works,” Cas says but he takes Dean’s hand anyway and gets up. They’re standing too close together, Dean feels Cas’ breath on his cheek and takes a half step back. Cas shrugs off the coat, then the jacket, but his hands tremble too much to take off his tie. Dean steps forward again, carefully undoes the knot and lets the silk slip through his fingers. He drops it on the floor and traces his eyes across Cas’ face.
"Like, I committed a crime. Which is how I even met you. Do you not want to know what it was? What if I was dangerous?"
“Oh, that’s Gadreel,” Cas says. “And yes, I’m definitely hungry. You want to go down to the cafeteria?”
Sam contemplated that for a moment, trying to recall if Cas had mentioned something about talking to other angels recently. He couldn't come up with anything.
Their room had a king size bed and a ratty looking couch, a small table with pamphlets about 'the 50 most exciting things to do in Knoxville' and a TV that looked older than the Impala.
A week passed, and Dean slowly felt better. He always went home in the evenings, taking his bagged lunch and fresh laundry with him.
"Cas," Dean said, pained. "I haven't even showered. I smell. And now I also smell like beer. It's not pretty."
"Sam, this is not the time. You're tired and you should rest." The angel picked up Sam's duffel and handed it to him. "Dean, you-"
He said down on the couch to check his phone for any news. After a minute or two, Dean suddenly heard a loud crash and almost dropped his phone in shock.
Ben nodded. "Yep. I spend it with him almost every year. To be honest with you, I'm happy as a clam that he has you. I don't trust easy, neither does he, but you're a good kid. I'm glad to be able to bring enough drinks for three this year. Did he talk about any plans for it?"
“Sorry,” Pamela said as she was sitting down on her bed, “can’t seem to stop smoking. It’ll kill me, but what can I say, I like bad things.” She smirked and Cas smiled politely.
“Is everyone okay?” Cas asks as he grabs the kitchen’s first aid kit and starts cleaning the young hunter’s wound while he’s trying to eat a gigantic sandwich.
"Ah, about a month then. I think, at least." Dean scratched his temple before remembering something else. "Hey, speaking of Cas, I saw it was his birthday soon?"
This fic is theoretically set in S15, but you don't really need any knowledge of the season (or many before), I'm briefly referencing two things but you're honestly fine without. That's all :)
He washed the piled up dishes, wiped down the kitchen and worked on removing the tomato sauce that had splattered against the tiles when a sauce overcooked days ago. After all that, he looked at his phone again and finally had a text.
Cas reached for the napkin to dry his hand, before crumbling it up tossing it to the side. "Something good, I hope?"
They sit in comfortable silence as Cas eats, and when he’s done he leans back. He takes another sip of his coffee, and fidgets. “Can I ask you something?”
“Uh,” Sam said. “Yeah, okay? I don’t have much space, but you can sleep here if you want to. Save the motel money.”
"Hello, Dean." Cas sat down across him as always, but now close enough to touch with the screen door open. Dean could make out more of his head and shoulders, but the features of his face still unclear.
Four hours later found Castiel with a lukewarm beer in his hand at someone’s party. The living room he stood in held probably thirty people, all roughly his age dancing and laughing. The smell of clean sweat, beer and perfume wafted around him as he made his way through the students and tried finding his brother.
“I know I’m messed up. ‘s not like I’m in massive denial over that or anything. There’s just—” Dean interrupted himself, swallowed against the sudden lump in his throat. “There’s just a lot of.. stuff. I ignore it most of the time, but lately it’s been getting worse, and I don’t really know why or how to deal with it. So I just didn’t...deal with it, I guess.”
"Ah, I'm alright. Work's been a pain in the ass, since Tim won't leave me alone except to go take a damn bathroom break. He's been mother-henning me since last month and it's getting annoying." Dean played with a loose screw in the floorboard next to him, trying to push it back down but failing ultimately.
A small smile on his face, Dean closed the box and carefully took it. Ben chatted with the baker, and Dean watched the clock. It was almost three, and he didn't want to be late. His worry was for nothing though. The owner seemed to have a sixth sense for stress, and she winked at Dean while saying goodbye to Ben. A few compliments and some general life advice later, they were on the road. Dean had the cake safely on his lap, gripping it tightly but without denting the box. At his feet was a little colorful paper bag with Cas's new kindle.
When he reached the bunker's door and pulled it open, he saw that it was night outside. He had completely lost track of time apparently. He carefully made his way through the trees behind the bunker, meeting a few frightened squirrels on his way. He walked for about half an hour, the part of the forest he was in right now being very thick and not letting in any light from the night sky. He started going uphill slightly until suddenly there were fewer trees. Eventually, he reached a small clearing on the top of a hill. There were a few small bushes scattered across it and the grass was long and specked with wildflowers of different shapes and colors. The moon was full, so the clearing was dipped in silver light bright enough that even a human could see almost everything. In the middle of the meadow sat a dark figure, looking up at the sky.
After the second week, Dean asked Cas during his lunch break if he could sleep over that night. It was Friday. Cas had Saturday off, and Dean felt a little less like the local sad sack.
Dean opened the fridge and grabbed a beer along with the last blueberry muffin he baked during a nervous night break down a few days ago. He recently discovered that producing a ton of food helped a lot with calming down, although their kitchen was now completely full of pie, muffins and quiches. Walking past the kitchen table he saw a note on it.
Wetness hit his nose, and with a shock he realized Cas was tearing up. A second tear made its way down his face, following the ridge of a scar.
Dean’s washing dishes when his phone rings. He carefully puts down the mug Cas had given him for Christmas, and answers.
Dean and Ben walked into the bakery together, a small bell signaling their arrival. A heavy-set old woman greeted them, pointing to a beautiful blue paper box on the cherry wood counter.
Cas, however, jerks violently as Dean lays a hand on his arm. He looks around but can't see Dean, doesn't lock eyes with him, doesn't return his smile. Dean's heart aches so much he thinks it'll kill him.
Dean had no idea why he kept pressing on the issue. Well, maybe he had, but that wasn't something he wasn't interested in thinking about right now.
Sam’s eyes widened comically and he started grinning. “That’s awesome, Dean! That’s so awesome. I’m so proud of you.”
The day the English Bluebells start blooming, he finishes by sealing the polish on the front oak door.
While the cookies cool they eat dinner. Dean makes spaghetti at Cas’ request, and they settle down on the sofa. Dean puts his feet up on the coffee table to make Cas feel comfortable, and so Cas curls up a bit, his plate on his lap.
“Uh, hello?” Dean pulls the plus in the sink and sticks the phone between his cheek and shoulder as he’s drying his hands.
The title music started playing, and he couldn't help but grin around the food in his mouth. Cas had really put thought into this, and clearly cared about him.
Dean could almost taste Cas's breath on his lips, and he suppressed a shudder at the feeling. He concentrated fully on the physical sensations of being close to Cas, the birdsong all around him, and the pond's tranquilizing splashing.
“Dean.” It’s all Cas says, all he ever says, but Dean doesn’t protest when Cas lays his hand on Dean’s cheek for a beat, watches him reach for the seam of Dean’s shirt. He raises his arms and they pull it off together. Dean’s naked chest is almost heaving with the breaths he’s taking.
A shout tore him out of his memories, Someone pushed him out of the way and he numbly watched the car he had just propped up crash back down.
“Finding a substitute for archangel blood isn’t easy, but we’ll find something.” Sam walks over to him and puts a hand on his shoulder. “We’ll bring him back.”
"Yes, that sounds nice." Cas did this kind of smile that only ever was visible in his eyes, and Dean couldn't help but feel immensely happy that Cas was home again. He spent enough time worrying about his family.
After a choked backed sob, Dean brought his other arm to the small of Cas' back, pulling him in even further, trying desperately to calm him down and give him the same sense of protection and safety that the angel had given him and continued to give him whenever they were together. Immediately, Castiel's arms went around Dean's back, grasping tightly into the fabric of the hunter's jacket.
He closed the door behind him and checked his phone. No new messages. The angel frowned and put his phone back in his coat pocket. Time to continue looking for Dean then.
Cas shook his head at him, taking Dean’s left hand and holding it between his. “You smell like alcohol.”
"They did lower the amount of supernaturally related murders significantly in the whole midwest over the past few weeks. If Sam has forgiven her and agreed to work with them, why can't you, Dean?"
Then he lifted his hand and placed it on his heart, and Dean didn't need him to say anything to understand. He mirrored the gesture, feeling his own rapidly beating heart under his fingertips.
Dean very carefully tried to wipe away some of the blood on Cas' face, along with dried sweat and, undoubtedly, dried tearstreaks. Dean was barely able to do his job right and not hurt his friend even more, but he felt unbelievably angry. They found Cas and he was alive, but he was unconscious and hurt and they still had no idea why he vanished.
“I look forward to seeing what you like about it so much,” Cas says as Dean slides in the DVD, then sits back down next to him.
“I'm coming,” came the reply and Dean relaxed marginally. A couple seconds later he could hear bare feet approaching on the tiled floor. The door must lead into the kitchen.
The sun becomes strong enough to give him a handful of sunburns, and Dean cycles through endless versions of the first conversation they’ll have when Cas is back, of
"Do you want to have cake first or do you want to open your gift?" Dean asked and Cas looked between him and Ben with surprise on his face.
Dean said nothing, but sat down on the kitchen floor and stared at the lime green cupboards in front of him.
"Not really. My mom died when I was a kid. My dad died in a car crash a couple years ago, and my baby brother is away at college. We're not really close. Not anymore."
“I don’t—” Cas starts, pauses to fumble with a napkin. “I don’t have anyone to celebrate Christmas with, so I usually work. It’s not my favorite time of the year.”
"I said I'd look into it, see if i can dig up anything that might be a hint about nephilims. Cas said that maybe South America might be a good start." Sam got up and without him looking, a small piece of paper fell off of his lap and dropped on the floor between the couch and the end of the bed.
I'm so sorry this took so long to update. I had a small case of writer's block and also a crisis of "why am I even writing this, this is crap". I somewhat overcame it and just tried to write a little, it worked better than I anticipated and I think the next chapter will follow either tomorrow or sunday.
Dean nodded. “Okay, sure. Yeah. I’ll, uh...I’ll text you the details when I’ve worked out when I can take time off work?”
"Oh," Dean says, and there is another tiny little flip somewhere in his belly. It's been a frequent thing, now that their lives have slowed down a bit. "You got something specific in mind? We can make some snacks and watch the ball drop."
Dean followed each scar with his eyes multiple times, but the reason his chest hurt was not the looks of them, but the implication they held. As big as the scars were, the wounds before had been bigger, and Dean felt helpless.
Dean laughed at that. "It's just Netflix, Cas. And okay, yes, we can do that. When? I'm free tomorrow or Friday."
Cas pulls back to look at him. “It won’t.” There’s a tear sneaking down his cheek, and Dean’s thumb catches it.
The small yard was bursting with plants. Flowers spilled from window sills and bonded together with small bushes to frame the narrow stone path and wooden stairs leading up to the porch and front door.
“A little good ink, maybe a piercing and boom, you’re the new heartthrob here. Welcome to the University of Kansas.”
Piercing blue eyes looked at him, full of fear and sadness. Dark, tousled hair. A strong jaw and a beautiful set of pink, chapped lips. And two prominent scars.
It’s been a while since he’s seen the movie, so Dean’s actually pretty focused on it. When Cas comes back from a bathroom break, he sits even closer to Dean. They’re pressed together now, and Dean tries to peer at him from his peripheral vision. Assembling every ounce of bravery he can muster up he slowly lifts his arm and lets it rest on the back of the couch.
Cas nodded. Sam smiled and released his hands, then pulled him forward into a hug. Cas went willingly, his arms going around his friend's waist and Sam held him tightly. The hug only lasted for a few seconds, but Cas felt much more relaxed when Sam let him go and he wiped away a stray tear that had escaped.
Dean's happy Sam is distracted for a moment, at least while they're here. Eileen leaving had been brutal on him, and Dean knows Sam tries to hide it, but it's no use. He can read him too well.
Dean steps towards him and opens his arms. Cas steps into them, his arms around Dean’s shoulders and Dean thinks they fit together nicely. Sure, it’s a bit awkward with the puffy coat, but it’s still nice.
Cas was squatting between flower beds when Dean entered the garden and reached the open part of it. Dean didn't say anything but chose to just watch him for a moment.
The waitress smiled at them. “Our outside seating area generally opens after noon, but...” She looked at her wrist watch. “I guess I must’ve read the time wrong. The door isn’t locked, so just pick any seat you like and I’ll find you with your food.”
"I'm happy and amazed you want to spend so much time with me. I cherish every day I have with you, and I realize I may not be the perfect partner, but just let me know and I can
"It was very different. I liked it, though. I look forward to seeing the next ones." Cas squeezed his hand and Dean smiled.
“Dean, stop!” Sam bit back. “I didn’t want them to think that I’m not taking this relationship seriously. I thought if you and I could reschedule for Christmas, everyone’s happy?”
"I keep thinking of my mom, and how she would want me to be healthy, and happy, I think. And to be there for Sam, and I can't do that when I'm unemployed and drunk half the time. Do you think we can figure this out?" He looked at Cas who nodded immediately.
"You're probably right that I should talk to him again. I'm just tired right now, you know? I feel like I need a break from everything and everyone." He looked at Cas, who never once stopped looking at the hunter's face. Now though, he frowned slightly.
"I talked to Cas about this a little," Dean tried again. "He said that I needed to try and make you understand what this is like from my point of view and that it's not your fault that I took your decision so badly. To be honest, I don't know how else to explain this than with what I said earlier, so I don't really see this as useful at all, I guess."
He had just turned into a parking space, coincidentally right in front of the store. He put Baby in park, put his wallet and phone back into his pockets and got out of the car. The wind that had only been a fresh breeze before had turned into a freezing blast of air that immediately teared at his jacket. Wincing, he zipped it and hurried over to the store. He stepped inside and let the warmth of the shop envelop him. Dean wandered through the isles, picked out the lightbulbs he needed and stopped in front of a beautiful, light blue sofa. Cas would need something to sit on for his room, but a bed didn't make that much sense considering he didn't sleep.
Dean checks his phone and sees a text from Charlie with a thumbs up emoji. As he scrolls through the checklist for tonight he suddenly hears Cas’ voice.
Dean can’t fight the surprise he knows must be showing on his face, and he feels warmth creep into his cheeks. "You were only gone for a week," he says, because he's an idiot, but Cas' expression is gentle.
He turned his head a bit and pressed his nose into Cas's hair. He responded by taking a loose hold of Dean's shirt.
“Read the card,” Dean said and Cas picked it up. He opened it, flipping the rainbow-colored front to read the writing on the inside, framed by hastily drawn shitty little flowers and crooked rainbows.
"White. And Ben told me once that my nose is indeed cute; however, I'm not entirely sure if it was a joke."
Sam looked up and met his brother's gaze, then shook his head slightly. "Can they even do that? The zapping I mean."
Slowly, he tried to blink the pain and dizziness away, finding that his left eye stayed resolutely shut. After a few moments he understood which position his body was in as he regained some of the feeling in the number parts.
"It broke and there were shards of glass on the ground. I fell and couldn't catch myself. The glass cut into my face, and I lost consciousness. I woke up a week later in the hospital."
“Dean then.” The doctor showed him the x-ray of Dean’s hand on a tablet. “Here and here is where I would’ve expected it to be broken after the type of injury you sustained, but luckily all you did was sprain your little finger. I’m guessing that happened when you fell.”
They reach the clearing and Dean winds his way around fallen trees until he reaches the one he always sits on. This spot has been a small sanctuary for Dean when he needed it. He loves making fun of Sam for jogging, but he gets the tranquil effect nature can have. The amount of times he's wandered out here to think, or just be, he doesn't know. In the spring and summer the long grass is dotted with wild flowers, bright colors everywhere.
Dean surges forwards and kisses him. Cas hugs him close and kisses back, his nose smushed painfully against Dean’s, but he doesn’t care.
Dean liked the feeling of hearing those words, the way the buried themselves deeply in his chest, sending warmth through his body and making his fingertips tingle to reach out to Cas. He leaned forward and rested his forehead against Cas’s, looked at him before tilting his head slightly to press a feathery light kiss to his lips.
Dean couldn't help but laugh at the Cas-typical sincerity of the statement, even though he still felt a bit ashamed. "You big sap. What's for dinner?"
“I know,” he says. “I know we will. But I can’t do this,” he gestures around the room, “anymore. I need to actually do something.”
"Sure, let me do that." Dean got to work while Cas sat down, unfolding the blanket and booting up the computer.
“Castiel,” Castiel, says. “But the spelling is a bit difficult, so Cas is okay. Just not Cassie, please.”
He’s dressed and downstairs to take care of the sauce when the doorbell rings. Dean hurries to open the door, maybe a bit too forcefully, and tries to conceal this with a cool pose. That intention ends up in the trash when he stumbles and almost smashes his face into the door, but catches himself.
As usual, dinner is a completely crazy affair. They give out food for anyone who needs it and can’t afford it otherwise, and then late in the afternoon they close up and begin to prepare the rest for themselves.
“Yes. Your health is more important, even if I wouldn’t have been ready for you to see me under normal circumstances.”
“Let me interrupt you there,” Ben said. “Castiel might seem weird; he can be unfriendly when he’s scared or surprised, but he’s good people. He went through a lot, and none of it is my place to tell you. He might never open the door and talk to you face to face, and that’s not an insult to you, that’s just...what he does. If that’s a problem—”
Cas visibly grew more nervous by the second, and Dean didn't even have to consider his next action for a second. All of his brain cells were busy screaming their approval.
in both of their expressions, but can't put his finger on it. There's open worry there for sure, and for now that's enough.
"In here," Dean yelled back and Sam must have been closer than he thought, because only a few seconds later he heard a soft, "Oh god," followed by his brother kneeling next to him.
Cas ordered waffles with fresh fruit and chocolate sauce, whereas Dean opted for savory pancakes with bacon and hashbrowns on the side. Dean inspected the menu for possible dessert options, finding their selection of ice cream flavors almost intimidating.
Dean nodded and grabbed the back of Cas’s neck, pulled his face close and wrapped his legs around his hips. Cas looked at him without moving for a moment, the flicker of the candles carving the scars on his cheeks deeper, but nothing could actually distract Dean from looking into Cas’s eyes. Cas looked at him with so much warmth, and Dean felt safe in his embrace.
Dean’s stealing one of Cas’ fried chicken bites as his phone beeps with a text message. He strains to reach the dining table from their spot on the floor, and grins as he reads what his phone says.
Dean didn't reply but leaned over the table a little and started carving something next to the already there letters. While he tried to get it as neat as possible he realized that Cas' slurping noises had stopped and guessed that both he and Sam were watching him. A minute and one small cut later he leaned back and blew on the table to get rid of the small wood chippings.
When Dean returned, Sam had already dressed Cas in a pair of spare sweatpants from the car and his own flannel that he wrapped loosely around Cas' shoulders, trying to provide him with at least some coverage. Dean sat down on the couch that gave off an indignant squeak at the hunter's weight and finished one of the tiny vodka carafes that they took from the mini bar. Sam sat down on the bed next to Cas, checking his phone and sending an update text to Crowley, who, contrary to popular belief, actually asked several times if they had found Cas and if he was alright.
When they got home hours later Cas seemed a bit tense but okay otherwise. They settled down to watch a few documentaries, then cooked dinner together. A shared bubble bath and lazy hand jobs later, they fell asleep curled into each other.
“This is going to be over quickly if you don’t stop doing that,” Cas said and raised an eyebrow at Dean’s answering smirk, but Dean let go of his cock. He brought his hand up to his lips and licked his fingers slowly clean. Cas just made a noise in return and crawled back down to put all of his attention towards prepping Dean fully.
Cas’s facial expression changed infinitesimally, before he was kissing Dean so hard they almost toppled over.
Dean melts a little at the cute smiley face. He checks his hair in the bathroom mirror, realizes it looks weird, then notices pasta sauce over one arm. Fully aware that their meeting is not a date he shrugs and jumps into the shower. Can’t hurt to look his best anyway.
"Turn it on!" Dean grinned at him and Cas gave him a helpless look, so he reached over and pressed the power button. The home screen appeared and Dean pointed to it.
Cas is tied up in a small cabin, there are graphic descriptions of injuries that were inflicted on him.  Skip the part between the " * " if you do not want to read it, the part afterwards only describes face injuries in a more detailed manner. Also, lots of blood.
“Take them in. Be their foster parents.” Cas’ look is steady, his shoulders tense but he looks incredibly determined. “They need people that know what they’ve been through. Your typical foster family isn't going to be equipped to help with this kind of trauma. How could they talk about what happened to anyone not in the life?”
“This needs to be cleaned,” he says and Dean nods. They get up, when Cas stops him. “Do you need to go to a hospital? Do you have your tetanus shot?”
In the beginning of creating the network Dean and Sam stepped in once to help with a large vamp’s nest two states over. Eileen had agreed to stay with Cas, her belly stretching everything she’d wear by then, and although Dean had returned with nothing but a few bruises, Cas had asked Dean to not hunt unless they were going together. Waiting for news, not knowing if they were okay, all the stress made Cas fiercely determined to know Dean to be safe, or be there to ensure it.
Dean handed Ben the gift bag, since he wanted to carry the cake himself. They walked to the front door together, and Cas opened it before they could knock.
“It’s the truth,” Cas says. “I’m gonna be done here at five, and now I really do look forward to the dinner.”
"I'd love for you to come. I haven't had anyone but Ben with me for the past few years, so it'd be lovely to have you with me." Cas smiled shyly at Dean, who grinned back.
The part of the garden he had just stepped into was similar to the front yard, but even more beautiful. A small path made from cobblestone wound its way through the thriving plants, green everywhere around him. Bursts of pink, yellow and blue were revealed with every breeze; the amount of beautiful flowers surpassed Dean's imagination. He walked along the path slowly, letting his hands touch the plants he passed, feeling their soft leaves and making sure to only graze the petals.
Dean hugs Cas, arms firmly around his waist, looking around the room. Every item in it helps create an aura of comfort and softness, and Dean had sat in it a few times just because.
"Cas?" Dean's voice broke, he put the flashlight on the floor and tried to heave up his friend, but stopped when he saw the extent of his injuries. He cradled Cas' head in his hands instead, softly stroking over the mess that was his face.
He made his way to the library where Sam was sitting at one of the tables with his laptop, typing away furiously. Dean plopped down on the chair opposite of him, stretched his arms above his head and groaned as he felt his muscles protesting.
Cas pulls out his phone, taps around on the screen, and then a song starts playing. It’s light, gentle, and Dean can’t help but smile softly at it. Cas puts the phone on the tree they've been sitting on.
Castiel smiled fondly and softly stroked the book's battered leather binding. The angel in the book shared all his secrets with his love, revealing his weaknesses and doubts, and she comforted him, giving advice or just holding him to battle the loneliness that accompanies a fallen angel. Cas placed the book carefully behind the pillow, stood up, and left his room. He had to go look for Dean.
“Typical answer,” Dean mumbles. He knows there’s no sure way of knowing anything, but sometimes he’d still like to have guaranteed success, especially if it’s with someone he’s come to like this much this quickly.
“Don’t have work,” Dean said. He sighed, and Cas didn’t control his own face quick enough to stay inconspicuous. Dean grimaced.
Castiel quickly looked back up at her face and felt warmth rush through him. He averted his eyes and fumbled with the beer bottle.
He toweled off afterwards, putting on some clean pajamas Cas had loaned him, and stepped back into the bedroom. Cas was sitting on the bed reading, stunning in the warm light of about a dozen candles. The room was warm, the windows open and the faint smell of vanilla in the air.
He lifts the covers a bit, and Cas is curled up slightly, his face grimacing and hands tightened to fists. His breathing is erratic, and he keeps whispering words Dean can’t understand. As Dean stretches to reach the bedside lamp, Cas’ words become clearer.
"I don't care. If you're feeling bad and you think I could help you, let me. I'd rather buy you a taxi drive than an eighteenth alpaca wool throw. I'll survive."
Dean whips around and he sees Naomi standing a few feet from him, her hand on Cas’ shoulder while he’s wiping blood off his angel blade. His eyes look empty. He pockets the weapon.
The next thirty minutes are spent like this; with them creating enough cookies to feed the entire city. Dean watches Cas, tickles more Star Trek quotes out of him as he makes penis cookie after penis cookie, and he falls a little bit in love.
Dean tried desperately to fit everything into the box, but to no avail. There was too much stuff this time, and he'd have to go twice. With a bit too much force, he pushed the box away from him, and a few letters floated to the floor. He stared at them, sighed, and laced his fingers behind his neck. He straightened his spine before trying to relax again. Cas had shown him these techniques to help with his stress and anger, though he had forgotten what they were called. Tense, let go, breathe. The air in Ben's office smelled like soil and flowers, a bit like dust and paper too. A hint of Old Spice from the man himself lingered at the desk. Tense, let go, breathe.
“Dean!” Cas spotted them and walked over briskly. He took one look at the ice pack on Dean’s head and his hurt hand cradled in his lap, and hugged him tightly. Dean relaxed into it, didn’t move much aside from turning his head to bury his nose in Cas’s hoodie.
“Sorry for cutting the line with the marriage stuff,” Dean says. “But we’re providing the flowers for your wedding, so that gives us a pass.”
“This is me,” she said and opened the door. The room was.. intense. The walls were painted black with colorful splatters of pastel on them, fairy lights in different shapes and sizes wound around the room, which held a king sized bed in the middle. The overwhelming scents of cigarette smoke and hairspray invaded his nose and he coughed once.
Dean sighs as he carries the heavy boxes behind the counter. He’ll put everything away later. Still, his eyes fall on the box he knows has candles and tinsel in it, and after a brief internal debate he opens it and starts pulling out stuff. A few sparkly dark red candles to put next to the register, unlit, just catching the light of their many warm lamps. He winds a dark green garland of pine around the small spiral staircase that leads upstairs to the office and employee bathroom. As he walks back to the box he catches sight of movement outside the café, and looks towards the door.
Tim leaned past him to take the funnel out of his other hand, but paused when he was closest to Dean. He looked at him, a scowl forming on his face.
Cas' blood ran cold. He frantically tried to remember if he had voiced any of his thoughts of the past minutes, when his brain suddenly stopped on what exactly Sam had asked.
Dean lifts his arm and sees the bandage to be dark and glistening. Cas turns on the second bedside lamp and Dean’s annoyed seeing the fully soaked bandage.
“Your back will thank me in ten years,” Sam had said and Dean couldn’t help but agree as he was laying down on it now. This thing was pure magic.
Dean shook his head no and laughed. “No, I'm good with anything. I do love meat though,” he added and Cas hummed.
"Come here," Cas said and pulled Dean forward slightly until their heads met and their foreheads rested against each other.
"Let's go," he says. "Pretty sure I accidentally switched first names twice while filling all that out."
Their kisses were deep but unhurried; clothes landed on the floor one by one until they were both fully undressed. They changed positions; Cas lay on top of Dean, sucking bruises into his neck while Dean held onto him tightly, hips moving against Cas’s in a slow rhythm.
Sam dropped his pen on the table, jumped off the chair and sprinted to his brother. Sliterhing around the corner, he saw Dean standing in front of Cas' room, the door open and his brother staring into the room.
He stomped up the stairs, dropped the box, and practically pounded on the front door. Muffled steps came closer, then stopped.
The porch door was open, as was the screen, and Dean could hear piano music playing softly. He stepped onto the porch, and after considering for a moment, took his shoes off. He dug his toes into the soft pillows and couldn't help but grin.
It’s a sunny day in late spring and Dean drills the last of the holes into the wood. He steps back and eyes the foundation of the greenhouse. It's just the wooden beams and groundwork, no glass or interior structure, but Cas looks at it like it's already the best thing in the world.
“We’re not married, Dean.” Cas tries and fails to pick up a microscopic piece of salmon, then gives up and just uses his fingers.
He felt the fog around his head tighten and close in, drowning him in bad thoughts and worse memories. The absolute absence of caring came as a surprise to him, and yet it didn't.
“Did you not have lunch? Are you hungry?” Concern filled Cas’s voice now, and Dean felt warmth creep up his neck and cheeks at the care that Cas showed for him.
"Oh. Well, I actually had something similar to your suggestion in mind. If that's okay? We can use my laptop, it's quite new and I have the Netflix."
Dean almost physically flinched at the sound of his friend's voice, hoarse and painful as if the sounds had to climb through sandpaper before they could be spat out.
Cas nodded and came forward, slowly sitting down cross- legged next to Dean, leaving a few inches of space between them. After a few seconds of heavy silence while both of the men just silently staring at the sky, Dean spoke up.
Neither of them last very long. They’re almost quiet, heavy breaths and clumsy kisses shared between them. Cas helps tip him over the edge, and Dean buries his face in his neck as he comes. A few breaths later and Cas follows him, his hips stilling, pressed to Dean.
Gabriel's grin had faded and he gave Dean a sad look. “Alfie,” he said. Alfie was a young student, just turned 21 and had gotten his first job at Limbo recently, although him and Gabe had been friends for a few years before that. Alfie's older brother Inias had been a fellow student of Gabriel's before both had dropped out of university for different reasons. The young boy was always kind and helpful and Dean really liked him, he taught him how to mix drinks after Alfie asked him the day before his first shift started. He was clumsy but sweet and everyone had instantly liked him. Why was Gabe upset about him though?
Dean’s heart is soaring in his chest; he feels safe and loved and at home. A wild dream come true, to stand here with his love at the beginning of their future together.
Guilt, hot and searing, raced through his chest. How could he have let himself forget the day that changed his life the most, even more than his father passing away?
He gave his hand a couple licks, then grabbed Cas again and worked with his hand what his mouth couldn't reach at the same time. He let his lips catch at the ridge under the head, tongued at the sensitive spot before taking him into his mouth. He heard Cas's breathing become more laboured, but he stayed completely still apart from a little squirming. Dean was massively out of practice and was happy Cas wouldn't accidentally choke him with an out-of -control hip thrust or anything.
"I gave him your address. I didn't want to go home because there's nothing there, but when I come here... I feel safer. Not safe, because I'm not sure that's even possible, but safer. You're really fucking important to me, and I wanted you to know that even though it scares the shit out of me."
Dean had no idea how long Cas wanted to stay, since he didn't sleep he didn't have a room, what was he going to do while both of the brothers slept? Did he even want a room for himself?
A sudden pull of anger—at the bank, at the social system and overpriced gas as well as the local supermarket that had decided a loaf of his favorite bread would be $2 more—overcame him, and he felt his eyes starting to burn. Without a thought, he slammed his fist against the dashboard. Pain shot through his hand and lingered in his wrist. His knuckles throbbed and he gritted his teeth.
“Lock it. Barricade it, just keep it secure.” Cas rolls up his sleeves, looks around the room, rifles through a cabinet. Dean looks over his shoulder, watches him discard thing after thing.
Dean wants to reach out to his family, to console them that it's okay, his time would've come at some point. Though, he thinks sadly, he had started to allow himself to dream. Imagined a house he owns, maybe a second car in the driveway, someone to share the chores with. He'd never dared to fill in the details for the other person. But, at some point, his quiet hope had been a death of old age instead of in the flurry of the fight.
Cas grumbled and reached for him with shaky arms, Sam lifted him up easily and helped him sit down on the bed again. The effort of getting up exhausted Cas immensely and he was shaking all over. Sam shot him a concerned look, then went to pick up his flannel from the bathroom floor. It had dried blood on it and he threw it wordlessly on the table, then he picked up his own shirt from the day before and handed it to Cas.
Dean grimaced. "Can I do the trimming? I'm not entirely sure I would know if I'm killing a flower or a weed."
A cloud settled over his head, muffling everything and separating him from his surroundings. My brain isn’t working, he thinks. He’d gone to a therapist, once, many years ago. Sam had suggested it, his skinny fingers holding a pamphlet from his university's health department. The man hadn't been trying to force him to open up with fake understanding, but patiently explained what he thought Dean was struggling with, and how he could help. He had given him a new appointment, a smiley sticker, and a pat on the shoulder.
Dean rolled his eyes at him. "I appreciate the threat of a passion crime, but it's not needed. The day I hurt Cas I’ll shoot myself in the foot, believe me."
Dean raises his hands in a mock gesture of surrender before collecting the three big boxes from the kitchen. He bundles up against the icy winds, plops a Santa hat onto his head as a last minute decision, and slowly makes his way to the hospital, mindful of the precious cargo.
“Alright, gimme five minutes.” Dean closes the door again and walks over to the coffee machine. He starts making a double shot latte, sprinkles a little cocoa powder and cinnamon on top and takes delight in using one of their new stencils to create a little Christmas tree shape on top of the milk foam. He goes for one of their transparent domed lids and a swirly straw, and carries it back to the man outside, who lights up as he sees the drink in Dean’s hand.
Cas wet Dean's hair and massaged shampoo into it, the smell of vanilla enveloping Dean's head as he let out a soft moan at the feeling of Cas’s fingers running over his scalp.
They all laugh, and Dean hugs her. “Wow,” he says, and bends a little to stare at her stomach. “I don’t see anything.”
Cas' vision went slightly blurry. He felt pressured, clawed at his sweatpants trying to not get lost in the emotions and memories that welled up with Sam's questions.
"Hey Cas!" Sam sat his duffel on a chair for a second. The angel looked up and gave him a genuine smile.
"As much as I don't want to sour the mood, we still need to finish cleaning up. And you work early tomorrow, so you have to go soon." Cas ran his fingers through Dean's hair, and Dean sighed.
As Dean chews he is stunned again by what their life is like nowadays. Cas is warm against Dean’s side, and he smells like outside. Cas is laughing with Eileen, whose hair looks like caramel in the sunshine. Sam's looking at Dean, as if he knows what Dean is thinking, and he raises his glass.
After a languid makeout session they went back downstairs, and Dean plopped down on Cas's oversized and overstuffed couch to scroll through Netflix. Cas ran around behind him to find and then feed Hannah. Dean settled on the next Star Wars movie to continue his personal quest to educate Cas on his favorite movies.
The two kids from the vampire case live with Jody, get therapy, and are cared for by Alex and Patience. Dean and Cas visit them, and Cas tears up in the car after the first time. The six year old Matt is a firecracker, and some intense counseling had helped him immensely already. The older brother Alec is ten years old and with as many anger issues. He didn’t speak to them at all in the beginning, needed time and gentle coaxing and building trust to even look at them.
Dean’s chest was heaving with the heavy breaths he was taking, his head swimming and his heart couldn’t decide if it wanted to shrivel up and hide, or soar high up with what Cas had just said.
Dean’s ring ends up as a stainless steel band with a tiny sapphire in the center, Cas’ is a yellow gold with an equally small demantoid garnet; a rare light-green gemstone Cas absolutely insisted on picking. Both rings have Enochian engraving on the inside, and since they couldn’t decide on one idea they went with two: Dean’s ring has 9.18.2008 engraved, and Cas’ just the word Angel.
“Can you be more specific?” Dean’s trying to not sound annoyed, but he’s tired of cryptic statements.
Without thinking about it much, he shuffled closer to the door and reached out again, placing his hand palm up on the floor in front of Castiel.
Cas opens his mouth but says nothing. His lips are parted slightly, eyes focused on Dean, whose gaze flicks to Cas’ lips for a moment. They look at each other, both struggling to blink the water out of their eyes. Cas’ lashes are dark and clumped together, wet and heavy and they’re lowering, Dean’s tilting his head in reply and then their lips are touching. Soft and warm and wet, water running between them on every parting. A hand in Dean’s hair is putting a hold to any and all thought’s in Dean’s mind, and the only thing left is
Ben sat down at his desk with a deep sigh and turned on his computer. "Apart from stuff regarding the VSI, we generally talk about Cas's day, and what he's up to and if he's feeling alright. Since you two are apparently attached at the hip and the-" He gestured to Dean's crotch, and Dean immediately blushed furiously."That mostly includes you. Or is only about you. I swear, I feel like I'm dating you sometimes with how much Cas talks about you. Although I really don't swing that way, no offense."
Cas pauses. He finishes his muffin before speaking again. “I’ll think about it,” he says, and he sounds sincere.
They name her Mary, and Dean loves her the first time he holds her. She has tufts of dark hair, brilliant blue eyes and falls asleep a minute after Cas places her back in Eileen’s arms.
"Come on," Dean said before diving back in. Cas took a weak hold of Dean's hair but had stopped pulling away, and Dean moaned at the feeling. Seemingly encouraged, Cas tugged at the strands slightly, and Dean moaned again. He felt Cas's balls tighten under his hand, and he let his cock slip back out a bit to have the tip resting against his lips. He gave it a strong suck while looking up, meeting Cas's heated gaze. A moment later and Cas came, hot and divine on Dean's tongue. He took it greedily, working Cas through his orgasm and tonguing him clean before the hypersensitivity could set in. Only then he pulled off and sat back, grinning at Cas who just stared at him in what Dean would categorize as post-blowjob heart eyes.
“I don’t think we need any more grand gestures in our life,” Cas says. “We have everything we need right here, don’t you think?”
“He couldn’t make it today,” Dean said and shifted the heavy box to his other arm. “He asked me to bring you everything, so I got letters and a couple of knitted things. From uh, Helen?”
Carefully Dean peeled away the shirt and smiled as he saw that most of the wounds had closed almost completely over night.
“You are to write a report about your work. Minimum is 12,000 words, because whatever your task will end up being is
“Got fired. I hurt my hand, Tim helped and he could tell right away. Sent me to my boss, he fired me. Said he knew for a while now.” Dean didn’t look at Cas, who immediately let go of his hand, looked at it and then grabbed for his right.
The reaper hangs up, and Dean jogs outside. He spots Cas planting dahlias in the flowerbed in front of the house
“I need a nap or something,” Dean mumbles after a moment and scoots back on the bed, lies down fully and closes his eyes. He stretches until he feels his knee pop and his toes curl. His shirt rides up his stomach, but he doesn’t care. He feels the bed dip and opens one eye to see Cas lying down next to him. Dean watches him roll up the sleeves of his shirt, sees him struggle to fold it tight enough but lets him try until he succeeds.
They watch the third Back to the Future movie. Cas had disliked the second, ranting angrily about Biff, and Dean had had to convince him to continue watching.
“I apologize. I tend to read in the evenings and often have headphones in, I didn't hear anything. I would've been there for you if I had known. Why didn't you text me?”
Dean takes a step towards Cas, who starts trying to pocket the flower. Dean takes it, sticks it in Cas’s hair right behind his ear. He closes the rest of the space between them, moving slowly but surely. He lets his forehead rest against Cas’s, feels puffs of warm air on his lips and when he realizes he can taste Cas’s breaths his heart jumps out of his chest.
After both men went inside, Sam met them on his way to the kitchen. Looking at Dean, Sam awkwardly looked everywhere but at his brother's face and after a few seconds, he spoke up. "Hey Dean," Sam sad softly, "Cas found you. Good. Uhm, do you guys want to have dinner? I wanted to make a cauliflower and tomato casserole with some fried zucchinis."
“Okay,” Cas says, puts his phone back on the nightstand and pauses before he settles back into the pillows.
“C’mere,” Dean mumbles and Cas doesn’t need a second invitation in the slightest. The mattress creaks as Cas slips in next to him. Dean goes to turn off the bedside lamp but a warm hand on his side stops him from turning back. Cas moves and presses up behind him, guides Dean to lie down and worms his arm around Dean’s middle.
Cas opened his mouth to reply, but then suddenly slumped forward. Dean managed to catch him but almost tripped over himself. After a few seconds of fumbling, he got a secure hold on Cas.
"You usually do it when you're upset. Do you want to come over and spend the night? I can call a taxi for you."
. I’m offering you a place to stay until you can figure out what to do. I’m your partner, Dean. I’m not going to let you sleep in your car when I have an entire house I can offer you to stay in.”
They fill the days until they can drive to get them by making the office into a children’s bedroom. Matt and Alec will have to share a room in the beginning, but Dean’s fierce in his determination to give them the best home they can have.
"Awful, thank you for asking. It took me four times as long to get here since I had to take multiple breaks between Dean's room and this room."
The drive to the cafe took them a bit less time than anticipated; there wasn’t a lot of traffic. Dean held Cas’s hand as much as he could while driving, and they talked about anything and everything. Cas seemed anxious, his concentration shifted from the conversation often and he fiddled with either his clothes or something in Dean’s car.
Dean locks the door, and takes the mop to clear the muddy snow right away. When the wood is clean he sticks it back into the bucket and is about to go into the kitchen when he sees a group of people walk towards Cas, two people clearly running into him, and Dean watches him fall. He doesn’t think, just tears open the door and runs outside.
Dean was vibrating with excitement, grinning at Cas who looked at him like he was surely losing his mind now.
The hard dirt underneath their heavy boots creates soft thumping noises. Dean's first, Sam right behind him on his right, Cas on his left. They pull their weapons in sync, ready to defend. They creep along the left side of the building until they find a hole that once held a door.
Cas now picks up the soap and gives Dean the same treatment. His hands are big and warm, leaving goosebumps wherever they roam and he, too, finishes with Dean’s legs, only to stand up again after. As much as Dean has always loved sex, this is a different kind of intimacy. They’re both too hurt, too vulnerable for anything physical to happen between them tonight, and Dean’s more than okay with it. He doesn’t want to push Cas or nudge too hard at the soft pink bubble they’re creating, but contently stands watching as Cas washes between his own legs, Dean’s cock not getting the message and thickening a bit as he gives himself the same treatment under Cas’ watchful eye.
"Dude.." Dean rubbed his wrist that now hurt a little, an adequate reaction to his moose of a brother practially laying on it. " What wash that for?"
“I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to put you in that position.” Dean stared at a loose thread in the blanket on his lap as guilt crept in from all sides.
Opposite of the staircase at the far end of the room was a small stage, equipped only with a drum set and a microphone stand. Smaller bands and artists had the chance of playing there every second Friday, and the majority of them brought their own instruments. Limbo didn't make you a famous artist, but it did give you an enthusiastic crowd and, if you were lucky, a handful of groupies.
"Then he can't know that it's not entirely beneficial to you. Try and talk to him, and tell him that you appreciate his efforts, but maybe you two could work out something else together."
"Hello, Dean." Cas's rough voice washed over Dean's electrocuted nerves, calming him. This was Cas. There was no reason to be nervous.
The older hunter wasn't in his room, but the Impala's keys sat on his desk, meaning he had not left the bunker, at least not very far. Castiel went to the kitchen, but Dean wasn't there either. After checking the gun range, the gym, and the storage room they had been working on, he didn't really know where to look anymore. He went to Sam's room and knocked lightly. After a second, the man's soft voice called for him to come in.
Dean rolled his eyes. “Well, I’m great, thanks for asking, just here to drop off your fan mail, don’t mind me.”
Ben shook his head. "You didn't, kid. I'm here when you need me. For anything," he added, and Dean knew he was referring to their conversation in the car.
"Ugh, please," Dean says, and hurries to continue as Cas' face falls. "You moved in months ago. I keep finding new plants everywhere. Where are they even coming from?"
Cas gets out, closes the door and looks over to him. Dean can’t move, rooted more firmly in the warm grass than the young tree he planted a week ago. As he looks him over, searches for signs that anything’s wrong, he can hear the sound of Sam driving off again. Cas walks over to him, stops a few feet away. He’s blinking into the early afternoon sun, his hair streaked with golden brown in the light and Dean doesn’t think he’s ever seen someone as beautiful as him.
Sam nodded. “Do you need money? I can send you some. I’ve been saving the pocket money you’ve been sending me for emergencies, and I can help out if that’s an issue?”
“Well,” Ben said, “thank us by cutting that cake, will you? It’s been staring at me for an hour and I can’t take it anymore.”
Dean nodded and Cas released the grip on his jacket, leaned back and got up. Dean stood up as well, batting away the dirt from his jeans. He turned to walk towards the bunker, then stilled.
"It's fine, Cas. I'm just gonna go and be toxic somewhere else." Dean grabbed his phone off the table and stormed off.
"Let me at least help you now," Sam insisted and Dean didn't object. Together they maneuvered Cas onto the backseat and Dean immediately slid in besides him. He threw the keys onto the passenger seat and then turned more fully towards Cas, carefully lifting his head and placing it in his lap.
“Kinda grim for him to want info about my heaven, but okay. Is there a problem with it or something?”
"Wanna shower together?" Dean mumbled against Cas's skin. Cas nodded. He pulled Dean to the bathroom and turned on the shower before throwing a look into the mirror.
A bottle of lemonade is pressed into his hand, the condensation shockingly cold in his palm. Dean takes a sip and the bubbles tickle his throat. Cas sits down next to him, their thighs brushing and their damp swim trunks leaving dark prints on the wood.
“I don’t think I can really tell you what this is about yet,” Dean said. “Some stuff happened because of it, like I lost my job, but Cas is helping me deal with it.”
Dean scrubbed and scrubbed at the grime under his nails. Work had been exhausting; two sick colleagues from hayfever meant extra work for Dean. Additional money, too, but he was incredibly tired. He wouldn't miss his date with Cas even four broken limbs though, so even with an aching back and the start of a headache, he drove over to Cas's.
Dean felt small waves of shame crashing over him every day at how dependant he had become on Cas, how much he needed his help and reassurance. He felt like he was forcing Cas to be his caretaker, while Cas was adamant about giving Dean the support he needed. Even so, Dean still felt like an ungrateful leech.
Cas left the kitchen and Dean finished pouring the melted butter on the popcorn before stirring it and going to join him on the couch. Cas was already sitting down, right in the middle with a blanket on his lap. He looked up at him with happy eyes, and Dean liked to think it wasn't entirely because of the delicious smelling popcorn in his hands.
Dean turns his head, and Cas is looking at him, too. He’s drifted closer, infinitesimally so, but it’s enough.
“Alright, come on then,” Pamela said and they both got up. She took his hand and led him back through the living room and up the creaking stairs, through a narrow hallway to a closed door.
Dean almost drops the bottle, and Cas saves the full glass from toppling over. Dean knows how red he is, even though he’s already hinted his interest in Cas, but still.
“How are you? Are you alright?” Cas squatted down and Dean imagined that he was ready to jump up and hug him if he asked for it.
“I don’t give a damn if you have any grace or just your beautiful soul,” Dean had said, sliding his lips over Cas’ pulse point. “You saved me, over and over, and nothing else matters.”
“I’m bidding on an original jukebox right now, and we could put it in the basement too, and have parties.”
His eyes wander to Cas, and he does a double take. Cas' eyes are bright, a single tear track on his cheek. He's gripping the end of the bed so tightly his knuckles are white, and as Dean steps closer he can see a faint shimmer around him, emitting a soft blue light like an aura.
“If you need to talk about anything, ever, I'm here,” Dean said and squeezed Castiel's hand, and Castiel squeezed right back.
There’s a Cas-shaped hole in his soul, and he can’t fill it with research. He listens to the air vent rumblings, fumbles with a loose thread in his jeans and thinks until he remembers a conversation he had with Sam about seeing an insanely high amount of money going to an online bookstore.
"Yes, I'm coming," Cas shouted and a moment later he appeared. He stood further back than Dean was used to by now.
Dean sets his beer down, gets up and pulls out his slightly battered box set of Star Wars. He shows it to Cas. “It’s my ride or die,” he says.
"This... has been wonderful, but you still don't know what I look like. What you're getting yourself into. What if you kiss me and then regret it later?" Cas sounded small, felt tense under Dean's hands.
“Hey dude,” Dean said and stood next to Gabe, eyeing the bottle in his hand warily. “You think you had enough?”
“I called Sam today,” Dean said. “I took your advice. I asked about visiting him for Thanksgiving, and he said yes. Also said I could crash at his place.” Dean closed his eyes briefly. Then, he smiled even more. “I can’t wait to see him again.”
Jumping in the car with only a small breakfast they start the drive. It started snowing sometime during the night, and even though it’s still dark out the white blanket over the fields they drive past illuminates everything and makes it bright enough to see the road in front of them.
"It's from Crowley," Sam said, "he said to check the news." He opened a news website on his phone's browser and the top article was a few seconds old. The headline read 'Explosion heard in Knoxville this evening'. Sam tapped on the article and opened it, skimming over it quickly.
When Dean reaches over to get another pillow their thighs brush, and neither one pulls away. The movie starts, Episode IV, and as they settle in more comfortably they end up with their sides flush, and Dean gets goosebumps at the warmth that radiates from Cas.
“Let’s eat then,” Bobby barks, but his face is gentle and they shake hands before Cas awkwardly makes his way through chairs, bags and gifts to the empty chair next to Dean.
During the movie, they both gravitated even closer to each other, burrowing deeper into the blankets and pillows before ending up almost laying flat, Cas's head leaning against Dean's shoulder. He made sure to stay perfectly still.
“Naomi was threatening you. She was threatening Sam. I couldn’t tell you what she was doing, I didn’t remember until the crypt.” Cas looks past Dean and out of the window, rain splashing against the glass. He meets Dean’s eyes again. “I was ready to take the hurt if it meant you and Sam were safe. I thought I could carry it. Then she made me kill you.”
Dean looked at the sky again. He absentmindedly fumbled with a lose strand on his jeans, biting his lip.
“Sure, buddy,” he said and put the box down. His back ached from work and he leaned against the rough brick wall. “Is there a reason you don’t want to talk to me? I mean, no offense, but the fan mail you’re getting is probably not because of your warm personality.”
“Thank you, Dean,” Cas rasped and Dean had trouble understanding him. That dude really had a nasty cold.
“You asked about my favorite movies, so we could watch Indiana Jones or Star Wars.” Dean opens the fridge and takes out a beer for himself. “Want anything to drink?”
Cas frowned, looking at him. "I'm sorry Dean, I thought I had timed my arrival so you would know when I was going to be home exactly. Do you need help?"
So, they created their shift system. They’re usually on together, which means incoming hunts would go to both of them and they’d drive out and take them. Nowadays though they made actual hunting trips the smallest part of their lives; mainly helping with lore, research and taking care of hunters coming by and staying for a bit.
"Is this okay?" Cas looked at him with wide eyes, spit slick lips and a slightly flushed face. Dean nodded and Cas gave him a soft smile before diving back to Dean's neck and resuming his apparent hickey session. Skilled fingers found their way into Dean's boxers quickly, and Dean couldn't help but sigh when the by now cooler air hit his overheated skin. Cas gave him a few long strokes before pulling him out of his boxers fully.
Dean got up and walked into the bathroom. He picked one of the used towels and put it on the floor in front of the shower so Cas wouldn't slip and fall down. Their whole stitching up party the day before didn't leave them with any clean towels though, so he would need to go to the front desk and ask for some. When he left the bathroom Sam was just sitting up on the couch, groaning and rubbing his back.
He fell asleep, drifting off and, ignoring his usual lack of faith, sending a small prayer to whoever was listening for a peaceful sleep.
Hey guys!! I'm so sorry I didn't upload this earlier, I was really sick and just stayed in bed the whole time. I hope you like this chapter and thank you for reading x
“Well, yeah. I’m not gonna move into a big-ass house by myself, and I’d like to, y’know, share it with you.”
A cluster of yellow tulips. “There’s sunshine in your smile,” Dean says, and Cas looks away bashfully.
“This is still so new,” Cas says and he gestures between them. “I’m a bit nervous about the dinner later if I’m honest. I don’t want to do something silly, and make anyone dislike me.”
"Oh. Dean, that's okay. You should've said, I could have added some to my grocery order. It wouldn't have been any issue at all." Cas's voice was warm and reassuring.
"Good. Oh! The app says the car just reached your house. Put some shoes on, ideally, and just come here. The rest doesn't matter, to me or in general. I'll wait for you. I have to go into the garden for a moment and take care of Hannah, but if you want to or need to just call me back again. I'll see you in a bit."
Dean woke up with a bottomless pit replacing his stomach, and for a couple of blessed seconds he couldn't remember why. Texting with Cas until the early hours of the morning had left him tired and disoriented, but checking his phone for the time sent reality crashing down on him.
They spent the evening eating and laughing, trading soft kisses and softer smiles. The privilege of touching and staring, they both cherished. It was new and old at the same time, different but unchanged to the intimacy and trust they had already grown.
Cas raised his eyebrows. "I don't think so? Did you ever make it before?" Dean laughed and shook his head.
"I reached Crowley but he said he didn't talk to Cas and doesn't know anything. I don't think he's lying either, which-"
Then, Sam’s back. Dean’s being carried into the Impala’s back seat; Sam drives, and the car is being yanked from side to side, speeds up and Dean vomits at a violent lurch. He leans his head back into the soft warmth behind him, and distantly watches Cas wipe his face with his coat sleeve. He’s still cradling his head, as if it’s gonna protect him now. Now, after he feels the blood running from his stomach, the pulsating mess of his head. He can’t hear, and his vision’s fading out, and he’s terrified. He chokes, on blood or more vomit he doesn’t know, and passes out as Cas turns him on his side.
Cas swung his legs to the side of the bed, carefully placed his feet on the ground and got up. He felt wobbly on his feet and Dean saw the unsteadiness in his stand, immediately hurrying over to him to stabilize him. Cas grabbed his forearm with one hand and slowly made his way towards the bathroom. Dean helped him sit down on the edge of the bathtub.
Dean exhaled slowly before sitting back a bit, eyes still closed and face pointed down. His hands rested on Cas's waist, while Cas’s were on his hip and his shoulder.
About ten minutes later their waitress came to them, carrying their food and excusing herself before coming back with a small extra bowl of fruit salad.
Cas shook his head. "On the contrary, I think your perspective could be helpful to some of them. A lot of children and teenagers are from very traditional families who are less than accepting of their sexuality, and even though I didn't have a harmonic life with my family, they never cared about this topic."
Dean couldn’t help but roll his eyes at his enthusiasm. “Couldn’t someone tell me that I so obviously need fucking therapy,” he said. Both Cas and Sam snorted and Dean raised an offended eyebrow.
And when he turns back, Cas is right there. His face is close enough that Dean feels his breath on his lips, and the warmth in Cas’ eyes overwhelms him. Dean’s eyes flick to Cas’ lips, only for a moment, but when he looks back up there’s a sparkle in Cas’ eyes, and then they close.
Cas sent back a photo, and Dean's heartbeat rapidly increased. Had Cas sent him a picture of himself?
Dean didn't want to get up. Getting up meant facing the day, starting it, and if he never got out of bed the day wouldn't really start, would it? Even though it was past noon, his shift being the evening one that ended after eight pm.
Life continues in their new routine between helping hunters, visiting the kids and being happy and together. On a beautiful September day Sam and Eileen’s daughter is born. It’s a long day in the hospital, with Dean dragging Cas there far too early and ignoring everyone’s suggestion to go home until they’re called. Six hours later Sam collects them from the hallway, teary eyed and beaming.
Dean had reluctantly agreed to join his friends in the club tonight, he had work to do and didn't really have time to be partying, but they convinced him with cheap booze and promised to get him home in time so he still had enough sleep for work the next day. He usually wasn't someone who made sure to get exactly eight hours of sleep, but after the last time he had pulled an all- nighter, which led to him almost losing a thumb in the auto shop, he paid more attention to at least getting four or five hours. Bobby hadn't been happy over the accident and Dean promptly earned himself a slap on the back of his head and a few grumbled insults.
Dates? Why the hell would Crowley want to set Cas up for dates? Dean furrowed his brows and started typing again.
The room was the most beautiful of the entire house. The walls were a rich dark blue, the furniture was some type of dark wood, as were the support beams of the ceiling. Two huge windows to the garden were on the wall opposite the door, the bed nestled between them. The pillows on the bed were white, as were the curtains that billowed softly in the late summer night’s breeze. A few specks of dark purple pillows between more blue ones created a warm and inviting color scheme.
Silence fell over the table. Both continued eating, neither wanting to interrupt the break and risk starting a fight. Then, Dean heard a clinking sound and looked up. Cas had put his spoon down on the table and was looking directly at him. "You wouldn't be alone", Cas said.
Dean throws the second lamb blood-drenched dagger, putting his full weight behind it, and watches it bury itself in the Djinn’s chest. The monster’s speech stops abruptly. He chokes and screams and smokes and burns and then there’s silence.
“You were having a nightmare,” Cas continues. “I don’t know if you knew this, but sometimes when you feel very strongly, I feel it too. I don’t know if it’s the bond your soul has to my grace, or if you're subconsciously praying to me because your mind perceives me as safe, but it happens. That night was about three days after I left the bunker. I had just sat down to message Sam when I felt it.”
Dean picked at the flowers in the big terracotta pot to his left, letting the soft white petals slip through his fingers.
The moonlight flows over the treetops, the blades of grass peeking out from under the snow, silver-dipped like knives, though there's no fight or violence tonight, just stars and quiet and them.
Dean takes a luxuriously long shower and spends five minutes arranging pillows and a throw blanket folded neatly on his couch. He stares at it, shakes his head and pulls out his phone.
At Cas’s insistent nibbling at the bolt of his jaw, he turned his head and kissed him fully. He loved tasting his little exhales whenever they deepened their kisses. Cas gave his sweats a little nudge until they fell to the ground, and he stepped out of them. He got in the tub first with Dean between his legs as usual, arms wound around his shoulders and doing nothing but holding him.
Cas nods. Dean’s hand moves, and before second-guessing himself he bypasses the trenchcoat and settles it on the suit jacket.
Dean’s nose is cold where it presses into Cas’ warm cheek, and they pull each other closer still. Years of being torn apart over and over, but tonight, right now, it’s just them, together.
“Don’t say no, come on! I’m all bored on my own, drawing instead of dancing, and since you almost stepped on me it’s your duty to provide entertaining company. I’m Pamela, but friends call me Pam.”
He looked up to find Sam and Cas sitting next to each other on the bed, Sam's hand raised mid- gesture, both looking at him surprised. If Dean had to name the expression on their faces he'd pick
"What? What is it?" Sam ran over to him and peered into the bedroom. He saw it empty but not chaotic, it didn't seem like there was anything wrong. Sam lied a hand on his brothers shoulder and spun him around, searching his eyes.
Cas nods. “Yes. Just tired. I’ll see you later,” he says and hugs Dean briefly before scurrying off, a package of bandages in his hand.
“None of this is working,” he says, and the bottomless hole of despair drums up its theme song in the back of his head.
There are brief intermissions of bright light in his eyes, rough hands on his body. The cold hits his overheated skin as his clothes are cut away, and the cool scissors leave burning goosebumps in their wake. He wants to make the sensations stop, doesn't want evil hands on him, and lifts his arm to hit whatever he can reach. He feels his arms being held down and he’s alone and terrified. What will they do? How often does he have to lie here, tied up until Alastair has enough, when will it finally all—
Sam took off towards the first building and Dean headed for the second. The door to warehouse number two was rusty but Dean managed to pry it open quite easily. He almost got a heart attack when a small cat ran out of the building and past him to disappear into the night. Dean took his flashlight and wedged it between the door and its frame, dipping parts of the inside of the building into a bright yellow light. He looked inside through the small crack but only saw the ground scattered with leaves, dirt and some questionable puddles.
"I am," Cas says, adding a few pink gardenias to the little bundle of roses. "Very much so." He leans into Dean who reaches around and drapes his arm around Cas' waist.
“My parents are dead, and so are my siblings. I had several, but we were estranged for large parts of my adult life. They were military and just disappeared one by one.”
want Dean in his house constantly? Dean asked him that one night as they were cleaning up dinner, and Dean was wiping down the counters. Behind him, cutlery clattered to the floor and he turned to find Cas staring down at them with a heartbroken look on his face.
While he was figuring out which buttons to use and which not (he once wiped all the new configuration Sam had made and setting that up again was a mess), Sam came towards him from one of the side entries, his phone in hand.
The man nods, and Dean closes the door again. He’d love to let him in, but insurance reasons and not actually knowing the guy keeps him from doing so. He hurries in making the coffee, picks a different Christmas pattern to create with cocoa powder. Maybe the guy doesn’t like Christmas trees? Allergic to pine needles? Dean opts for a Santa silhouette, executes it perfectly and carries the drink outside.
After a handful of slow kisses, Cas rested his forehead against Dean's. "What you said earlier about your father," Cas began but Dean pulled back immediately.
"I thought so too. Do you want to leave now? We could take a walk.” Cas’ voice gets quieter, softer. “I missed you."
"'M not depressed. My dad used to call me lazybones, and that I run away from stuff and take the easy way. Think he was right, you know."
“Don’t think moving in together should be because of me being a general failure of a person,” Dean said and Cas frowned.
“I’m gonna print out your schedule, together with your tasks and details. Your first few times here will consist of preparing the group hours. We meet every day for up to four hours. People can come and go as they want, and we do different things each weekday. You will come an hour before it starts, help clean and prepare the activities for that day,
They decide on a light blue for the walls and white curtains. They order two sets of white Ikea furniture, and they ignore the numbers on their receipts.
Dean plopped down on his worn couch, takeout container in one hand and his phone in the other. He had been texting with Cas for the past couple of days, talking about nothing important, but loving the details about the man he was coming to know.
“You might as well join me,” Cas says as he rubs his hands over his face. Dean wastes no time and stumbles into the shower with his boxers still clinging to one of his feet.
"Well, Dean," Sam said, looking angrily at his brother, "some people just make up their minds about the right decision very late. Being able to chose the thing that will benefit the most people over personal issues is also a skill that I'd appreciate in any friend."
Sam was quiet for a moment. Then, "maybe he's outside? He started taking walks sometimes, since the forest behind here is pretty big and I think I heard him talk about a small cabin he found once. That's my best guess." He picked up his laptop again. "Let me know when you find him and make sure he is okay, please."
“It’s no problem,” Cas says. “I’m sure we can live with having some extra peonies around the house in the summer.”
Hours seem to pass, wind whipping past them as they’re fully disoriented in the darkness. Suddenly, it stops. They’re standing beside each other again.
Every day when he drives over and picks up his tool belt he feels himself straighten up a little, crawl out of the cave he’s been living in. Cooking breakfast for all three of them wakes him up in the morning, and he spends every hour of daylight working, coming home to shower, wolfing down the dinner Sam made and passing out afterwards. Whenever he can’t sleep he browses for plants, wood, paint.
Ben shot him a sceptical look, but his face softened at the genuine concern in Dean’s face. “I appreciate that you ask, but you can ask him all that yourself. I wouldn’t suggest doing it now, he barely knows you, but maybe someday.”
They arrive at about nine in the evening. The motel is old but clean, neon signs reflecting in ditches from the brief downpour they encountered earlier. The air is cold and damp, sending a brief shiver through Dean as they walk towards the reception. Only one double room left, but they act like it's fine. No need to tell the clerk that the third of their group doesn't sleep.
His silence was met with a sigh. "Dean, I see something’s wrong. It's okay if that's the case, but you can't come to work like this. You're risking your own safety and the safety of everyone else."
Dean nods. “It was pretty spontaneous,” he says. “We didn’t want to make a fuss. But, we’d love for you guys to be there when we sign everything, and say our vows.”
After a few minutes Cas pulls back, props himself up and kisses Dean with a vigor Dean can barely keep up with in the middle of the night. It’s messy, and Cas trails the kisses from Dean’s lips over his cheeks, eyelids and forehead. When he reaches Dean’s lips again, he pauses.
Dean nods and thinks for a moment. He’s already considering different types of wood, if he should use the same for inside and outside, when his thoughts halt. He can’t help but huff a laugh.
has two deep scars on his face (temple-cheek area) because of this. There are no lasting health issues, he's fully fine physically and we do not talk about this in more detail at a later point (except referencing PTSD briefly and talking about Cas not leaving his house).
“Of course we will! Congrats guys,” Sam says. He looks happy, and Dean’s cheeks hurt a little from how wide he’s smiling.
“I thought this looked lovely,” Cas said carefully. Dean shook his head slightly, as to indicate that he had no idea what Cas was talking about.
Eventually, Cas moves. His hands glide down Dean’s arms and come to rest on Dean’s hands, and Dean intertwines their fingers without a thought. He’s looking at Cas, standing so close his chin is tilted slightly. He rests his forehead against Cas’ and their noses bump softly against each other. Cas’ left hand crawls up to rest on the side of Dean’s neck, and he lets the sensation of it flood his heart.
They're at the farmer's market, and Sam's sniffing soaps. Dean's standing to the side, eyeing different stands of flowers, arts and crafts everywhere. He spots a booth for honey, and tentatively walks over.
"Are you Dean?" A young man sat in a nondescript black Toyota, and talked to him through the rolled down window. Dean nodded and got into the back seat. "Your boyfriend said you're having a bad day, so feel free to have some of the chocolate I have in the jar back there. He also mentioned your love for classic rock, and I just happen to have
After a minute, Dean hummed. "Okay, you're good," he said and Cas straightened again, opening his eyes. He blinked through the water that clung to his lashes and beamed at Dean.
“There’s nothing about who you are that I want to change,” Cas almost yelled and he stared at Dean so intently that he couldn't help but stare back. “I
Together they ate their breakfast in silence, the sun streaming through the window with the promise of a better day.
talk they’ll have. After reading Cas’s books, he buys two more about flowers, and one specifically about bee-friendly ones.
Dean immediately turned beet red; the design had seemed funny in the store (bright yellow with a text reading ‘save a lollipop, suck a dick’), but now he wondered if he was grossly overstepping.
"Personal issues?" Dean yelled, jumping up from his chair. "You call them torturing you 'personal issues'? Fuck yeah it's personal if they hurt my baby brother. I cannot believe you chose to just ignore what happened!"
“Fell,” Dean pressed out. He tried to move his arm further, but now his head hurt too and he stopped trying. “C’n you. Help.”
“You know when you'll propose yet? 'Cause that girl's a keeper,” he whispered into Benny's ear and promptly got a smack against his shoulder.
A moment passed, and Cas leaned forward with determination on his face. A deep breath and the candles were out, Ben and Dean cheering like children.
“Like physically going there, yes. Yesterday you took a huge step towards getting better, and I want to do something too. I want to show you that I’m not just preaching to you about getting better without making a move of my own.”
"Do we have jam?" Cas is timidly looking through the pantry. Dean pulls out a jar of half-empty strawberry jam from the fridge and nudges a jar of peanut butter over too.
"Wait, hold on, you too," Dean mumbled and reached for Cas's pants. He basically tore them open and his hand wrapped around Cas. He pushed his boxers out of the way to have more room to move. Cas closed his eyes for a moment before letting go of Dean's cock. He held his palm to Dean's face, staring down at him with slightly hooded eyes.
New tags added for this chapter, please check thoroughly before reading! Let me know if I missed anything!
"I was promised a new shirt," he said and Cas rolled his eyes at him before going to the dresser and rummaging around in the top drawer. He resurfaced with a blue henley and tossed it to Dean, who pulled it on.
Cas held up a hand. "I'm aware, Dean, yes. But I also know that only non-violent or first offender crimes give you community service, so it was clear to me you weren't dangerous. Also, Ben would've never let you come to my house if he saw you as a threat in any way."
Dean had been staring at nothing in particular while talking, but turned his head when he felt Cas’s hand on his cheek. Cas looked at him with so much pain and understanding in his eyes, that Dean almost collapsed then and there. How he could have thought that Cas had anything but Dean’s mental and physical health in mind when they had that conversation, was beyond him now. He really loved him, for everything he had done for Dean and for trusting him so fully. His throat felt too tight though to say any of that, so he just kissed him again.
Cas drops the duffel on the floor and sits with a sigh on the bed closest to the door. He rubs a hand over his face, his back hunched and his jaw set tightly. Dean watches him before toeing off his dirty boots and hanging his soaked jacket on the back of a chair. He winces and notices a deep gash on his left forearm, but his gaze is drawn back to Cas sitting with the weight of the world on his shoulders.
"What happened? Why did you disappear and uh," he swallowed before continuing, "come back hurt? Who did this?"
“Good evening, gentlemen,” the doctor said and shook first Dean’s hand, then Cas’s. “How are we doing?”
After about 1 1/2 hours of Sam driving and Dean absentmindedly massaging Cas' wrists to get rid of the harsh lines where the fabric had cut into them, Sam spoke up.
Cas hesitated, but Pamela’s honest smile made him sit down next to her. His beer sat in front of his crossed legs as he stared at the notepad in Pamela’s lap. She was doodling on it, her tattooed hand gripping the pen with a sense of cockyness.
"I'm gonna look in the books we have here about lore specified to South America and see if I can find anything that points to nephilims," Sam said as he sat back down.
He placed the book on the small birch wood table he had bought with Dean during Sam's absence and after his couch had arrived. Dean never told the angel that he'd ordered furniture, which led to Cas being surprised and very happy about the hunter's thoughtfulness. The couch was comfortable and he had sat on it every night after that, reading through all the old books and documents Dean had found in one of the storage rooms while Cas had still been on the road. The one he was currently reading included some old stories about witches, how some witches find their power and use it for good, along with some theories on how catastrophic historical events were used to channel power for extremely exhausting spells. The angel continuously shared the new information with Dean, excitedly retelling everything he read in the smallest detail, while the hunter tried his best to listen and follow along with the numerous jumps in time Cas made while trying to be as historically accurate as possible.
Dean couldn't fight the smile stealing its way onto his lips, and he hoped Cas could see him well enough to recognize it for what it was; a thank you, an 'I care about you too.'
“OD? With what? Why? What happened?” Dean's hands started shaking minutely and he balled them to fists to hide it.
He pulls on his big puffer coat, and even though he’s by no means a small guy he still looks a bit lost in it. Dean decides to be brave.
They take turns repositioning to rinse the soap off, but when they’re done the water’s still hot and divine. Dean shifts incrementally closer to Cas, who closes the gap. Cas’ arms come around Dean’s shoulders, his hands stroking soft circles on Dean’s back. Dean winds his arms around Cas in turn, holding him tight but not too much so. They stay like this, Dean trying to channel his emotions into his touch, hopes Cas understands everything Dean can’t yet say. Cas’ nose is poking into his neck, Dean’s legs are getting tired from working the muscles to hold them both upright safely, but he carries on.
The hunter network keeps building; they acquired a detailed database with locations, occupations and phone numbers for hunters in the entire country.
"I think that's a good idea," Cas said. He had to sit down on the bed again since his body was still exhausted and he couldn't stand for too long.
The bunker has felt lonely the past couple of days. Sam's spending New Year’s Eve with Eileen at a cozy spot in the Northwest, Jack is off doing God stuff, and Cas isn't back yet from a trip to help out in Heaven.
Another thorough stretch of his back and he made his way across the yard to the patio to place the shears back where Cas had taken them from. A creak announced Cas's return, and Dean happily noticed the two bottles of pink lemonade in his hands.
I hope you enjoy the chapter and I'll be ridiculously happy about any and all comments you might have. x
“No,” Dean said and surprised himself with his honesty. “I need to go home. I need to go to a friend’s.”
“You abomination,” he spits, golden eyes focused on Cas like a hawk. “I hope you get what you deserve. You will be punished for your choices, a
