“Either way, you still managed to take a horse that we’d been trying to break in, and finally do so.”
Cas’ shirt lies near the doorway, crumpled up when he returns. He must have used it to clean up a bit. Both himself and the bed.
And little by little their fight seems pointless when it had been the thing that drove them for weeks.
“He says I need to stop making jokes to cover it all up but that's all I know how to do. I mean you can’t mourn your mom if you have a baby brother to take care of so you joke. You can’t talk about what the internet says is PTSD because there are monsters to hunt and people to save so you joke. You can’t let yourself be vulnerable because that means death so you joke. You can't tell your best friend what you need to so you joke. You hide behind something safe because no one wants you to show what's really there.” Dean's mind is a mess right now, jumping from one point to another, skipping ahead and falling behind. He has so much he wants to say and it’s like he’s trying to say it all at once.
Cas growls as he watches, his hands flexing and releasing like he can't decide between wanting to take over and wanting to watch as Dean fingers himself open to prepare to take his cock.
Though Dean's assumption was that saying that would have been enough, Cas waits for him to actually speak to his acceptance.
This was written about the final few chapters of the original story. It's more headcanon-y than the poems in this collection but ficlets allow for that more
“You- You fucking hand delivered yourself to the empty while we were hunting for the occultum didn’t you,” Dean asked dismayed.
“Ma’am I would just like to say I’m real sorry for any curses you may be forced to hear when you fix it up. I'll try my best to bite my tongue but I felt it necessary to apologize regardless.”
“It’s from an old English word, I'm not sure exactly how the connection came to be, it's not simple like it is sometimes.” Cas looks up at him with a hopeful smile. “But if you wanted, your name could be Dean.”
They return their tools and start walking to the machine shed, he’s glad to be out of the barn, the fresh air of the farm makes him feel free in a way he’s never known before, he doesn’t let the fact that he will never have that freedom bother him.
Dean gets flashes in his mind, Cas behind him thrusting into him instead of against him. The slap of their skin, though muted due to their clothing is wholly erotic and the feeling of Cas’ hot cock so close to where he desperately wants it nudging against his ever tightening sack while Cas fists his erection in his slick grasp has him careening to his release in no time. Cas shifts above him and his cock catches ever so slightly on the ring of his entrance. His breath is punched from his chest in a keening whine and he cants his hips back with each thrust against him. Growing in need with each roll.
“Honestly, I haven't put much thought into it at all, I suppose I’d move to a larger city and find work there while I’m in school. Not sure where I would go though. I’m not even sure how I’d manage to get there.”
His reactionary nature screams at him to do something as the taller of the two walks past him, closer to the gig. Closer to Cas.
His mind spins without ever showing a sign of it tiring, flitting from thought to thought, always landing back on Cas. Every time it does, a whimper falls from his lips and tears run anew. At some point Cas starts whispering into his ear as his good arm rubs up and down Dean’s back in time with his own breathing, it helps to control Dean’s breathing which he thinks was probably the goal.
“Well no not technically, it couldn’t take me because the specifications of the deal hadn’t been reached yet, I was for all intents and purposes safe on my trip.”
He doubts he’ll ever be ready to leave, always another milestone around the corner, another memory to be part of, another smile or laugh or hug or tear to wipe from a reddened face. But at some point, he knows he has to let go. He also knows that right now is that time for him. He knows he’ll mourn, likely won’t ever stop, forever aware of what he’s missing. But staying means giving in and that’s something he can’t do. Staying means eventually leaving anyways, at least with this choice he will get to live as he wants.
He watches as Jody takes the red candle, the splint and the steel from the box. She folds the pages and places them in the envelope before lighting the candle. Castiel holds his breath as the wax collects and begins to drip from the small well forming at the wick, each splatter onto the flap of the envelope makes him flinch minutely. Jody hands the wax press to Dean to seal the envelope.
He grumbles silently about the extra chore even though it’s so small of a thing, the fact that it falls to him as the extras always do still grates on him. He’s putting down the last of the table settings when the light sound of feet treading gets louder behind him. Knowing what comes next, he waits, allowing them to have their fun. Their giggles give them away even if their feet hadn’t and he smiles as he feels two sets of arms wrap around his legs and his middle, the pair around his waist wastes no time and begins to tickle him mercilessly, so his squawk is only partly put upon.
He grins stupidly into the kiss, his stomach swoops as Cas devours his mouth and a low groan is pulled from him as Cas begins to rock their hips together. The hard line of Cas’ arousal is pressed against the well of his hip, each grind a dirty promise of what lay in store for them. His own hard length matches Castiel’s and his stomach riots at the sensation.
When he does hear the door clatter against its frame, the butterflies return to his stomach and he fiddles nervously, glancing down at his bare chest and its gnarly appearance with a scowl. He shouldn’t care one way or the other how Cas finds his chest. It shouldn't bother him in the slightest if he reacts in disgust or with apprehension. And he most certainly shouldn't hope for him to react as though they intrigue him, as though they make him more enticing
Dean nods his ascent and they fall into silence. He’s comfortable in it, it doesn't seem to stifle him or cloy to his skin and lungs as silence so often can. He wishes abstractly that he could see the sky.
“Perfect.” The word is said so reverently and with such a deep expression that Dean fights the urge to roll his eyes, knowing that Cas wasn’t answering his question at all.
“I don’t Cas, I just had this singular focus to get you here. I had to get you safe, I—I couldn’t stop until you were safe.” He sounds so scared even to his own ears. He pulls back just enough to see Cas’ face.
“That’s great, okay Dean, when you sign, sign your name but don’t worry about the date, the contract already has it written down, now there’s no start date for when you are to be working because we don’t know where you are headed yet and that’ll make a difference, it does, however, outline that there is an expected time for your arrival giving you anywhere from seven to twenty days to arrive depending on the farm choice.”
He meets Cas’ every roll with one of his own, his hand hardly stops moving, gripping the bottom of Cas’ spine, raking down his back, threading into his hair, cupping the side of his face. His fingers squeeze against Cas’ where they are raised up above his head, Cas’ squeeze in response.
He mouths his way down to the bolt of Cas’ jaw and slips just past it, caressing the soft spot just below his ear, a soft noise releases from Cas’ throat and Dean smirks against his neck. Kissing down further he laves his tongue against his pulse point and sucks. Cas’ knees buckle slightly against the sensation and before he knows it, his head is getting pulled back up as Cas crashes their mouths together once again.
“Sorry, I have no reason to doubt you in that regard, but ‘Cassie’? He told me to call him Cas.” There is a familiar warmth that runs down his spine when he thinks of the familiarity that the nickname suggests, Dean can see in his sly smile that Gabriel is not unaware of that familiarity.
“I understand Gabriel, in truth, as it stands, to make me leave Cas would have to be the one to send me away himself.” Dean’s not being completely honest; if he thought that he was putting Cas in danger he would leave in an instant no matter what Cas said. But Gabriel doesn’t need to know that.
He can’t let himself go too far into anything right now so as he stands there he places his hand just below Cas’ name, his fingertips barely touching the bottom of the carving and in a voice so low it barely carries he says, “I’ll see you soon.” and breaths out in a long gust.
He tries to move again, but the angle at which he fell seems to be limiting the movement of his good arm so much that he can’t feasibly shuffle himself around without the sharp bursts of pain. Just as he’s about to shout in vain for Cas or anyone really his soundless plea is drowned by a shout.
When they part Castiel doesn’t remove his hand from the side of Dean's face, instead he shifts it down to his neck, fingers splayed on either side of his ear ensuring that Dean’s attention is on him.
He sits stunned for a few moments, the sound of the door closing gently reaches his ears before his body reacts. His chest tightens again but it’s not from fear anymore. Anticipation makes his blood run like fire in his veins. He kneels up on shaky legs grabbing what little he owns and tosses it into his bag, a moment's hesitation has him grabbing both the blanket and the two pillows that make up his bed.
“Dean, Cas died human, we knew his grace was waning, we knew it could happen, he went to heaven just like Sam did. And I went after them, asked them if they wanted to come back. But it was different with you. Chuck was really pissed with you though, he didn't properly kill you, I mean you were dead absolutely but your soul was trapped; it wasn’t in heaven like it should have been, it wasn't even in hell, it was like he was hiding you from getting saved. Billie and Amara helped me find you, Dean he sent you to purgatory but he hadn’t let your soul go, it's like he was just waiting until your soul snapped before dropping you there.” He said and it was all too easy to picture Chuck holding his soul until he went mad, until he became the same as all the monsters he’d killed since he was old enough to hold a weapon.
She’s not seen Cas yet, but Dean can pinpoint the moment she does as her eyes go almost comically wide. She tries to school her expression but it's clear that the double shock has taken some of her tact from her, Dean can’t blame her, they’ve shown up in quite a fashion.
Minor warning that this chapter ends on a bit of a cliff hanger, it's also very, and I mean very long. If you're nearing what would be considered a normal bedtime for you it might be best to sleep now and pick this up again after some rest.
He isn't sure how he’s going to get supper tonight with the state of the young girl being what it is, but it wouldn’t be his first night without a meal so he supposes, in the end, it’ll be no issue.
“Now what was so important that you risked bonking your head,” he says as he stands, figuring that whatever caused the running and the jumping is going to require something from him, and drops her to the floor, making sure that her legs are first under her before releasing her. He’d made that mistake once and once was all it took to not make it again—though it had been a tad bit funny (once he was sure of her wellbeing) to watch as Inias laid crumpled on the floor.
“What did you do after you left the home?” Cas’ voice isn't gentle, apprehensive may be a better word, as though he’s not sure he wants to know the answer.
But then Cas showed up, and under no obligation to Dean, was ready with a smile, a story, a friendship, and little by little he remembered.
The way the forces of love can kill slowly as much as they can save, love killed Cas, love brought him back, love isn’t enough sometimes and the tragedy lies within a love that aches.
Worry eats into his chest about how Jody will react to his injuries. How she’ll react to Cas—and his injuries—showing up with Dean. If she thinks there's a risk involved with letting Dean work for her, will she break their contract? Can she even do that? He knows that there's a difference between hiring someone and hiring someone with a past like his. And considering Charles knows almost nothing of his life, he assumes Jody falls into the first category.
He doesn't know what’s caused the distress, though he assumes it is most likely the pain in his shoulder. And he can only assume that the food provided sufficient distraction, but he doesn't ask for an answer from Cas; he doesn't want to upset him anymore.
“My hands huh? You like thinking of them, pressed up against you, dragging you to the edge, holding you back, worshipping you. What about inside you Dean, do you ever think about that… because I do, all the time,” Cas whispers the rapturous words into his ear and his breath chokes out in short bursts.
“Even if the sale doesn’t go through Dean, you still worked on Ringer as you should have and he’s a far better horse than he used to be,” Cas says, drawing him in.
“No Cas! We do something and we both might end up dead. We move on and forget this ever happened.” He can’t breathe through the blood in his nose or see all that well either. His blood trickles down his jaw onto his neck, and the look on Cas’ face tells him how bad he must look.
“Castiel, we aren't getting any younger and you are at the same age now that your older siblings started seriously thinking about courtship and starting their lives properly. We just want you to be happy, with a family and doing something good with your life.” He looks down at his plate, trying to calm himself. His mother only wants what she deems is best for him even if he’s said more times than he can count that he doesn't share the want.
“Last time we did that I found you lying on the floor in a puddle of blood with a ruined shoulder,” Cas says with that same odd look.
“I’ll think about it. You should get back to your family before your sister loses her patience. I’ll see you at supper, don’t think you don’t still owe me just because you came to say hi.”
If he'd been more present in the moment he could have told Cas that his form was the reason his shots were going wide. Not a single one had managed to hit the target yet and Dean could tell that Cas was getting annoyed with the lack of results.
Cas looked at peace when it came for him, and it ruins him to know that. To know that loving him brought him to the one moment of true happiness. Loving a worthless, broken, fucked up killer—
A few of them find themselves on the porch with Hannah, who after several days of seeing but not truly being part of the festivities, had grown sick of it all and wanted to sit with her siblings in the shade. This annoyingly makes Gabriel’s smile larger. The look in Gabriel’s eyes reminds him of the look he’d received as a child when they had travelled into town and Castiel, young and far too obvious for his own good, had his attention caught by a young man running around in the street laughing and screaming. Gabriel had been the one to nudge him out of his wistful staring, and through his downcast eyes and incriminating blush, he had seen his brother give him a look that said ‘I think I know what I just saw and I love you but I'm not going to call attention to this’ before he turned back to their family, leaving Castiel to compose himself.
Dean slid his pants down just past his waist, tucking the fabric below the swell of his ass and rucked his shirt up past his ribs, the memories of the night before fueled the fire that raged in his core. His body felt like it was buzzing with need. He gripped his cock, slowly stroking from base to tip as his breathing turned laboured. He imagined Cas’ hand on him instead of his own and tilted his head back with a groan as a spurt of precome released from his slit. Dean brought his hand up to his face and licked a stripe up his palm before stroking again. He imagined all the things Cas would say to him, growled into his ear while he laid there at the mercy of the man. Just that thought seemed to kick his arousal higher.
“You beat me to it though, and then—well we both know what happened next.” His fingers are ice when they wipe the tears from his eyes. They jolt him, a shock to his system.
“I would have expected you to,” Dean says before cracking a mischievous smile, “and bring the flask while you're at it, Cas.”
“He was a difficult horse in the beginning, quite skittish and untrusting, but as you can see he’s come very far in welcoming human touch and being comfortable with exposure to new people,” Dean says as Jody walks through the stables to stand opposite him, Ringer between them.
Peering down at his body to find the source of the blood, he catches sight of his ripped pant leg and the stain of blood seeping from the tear. Kicking his left leg out to shift the fabric away his stomach turns at the nearly four inch gash along his shin.
In the same moment that fear hits him when Lucifer’s face is what greets him on the other side of the door a knife drives itself into his heart.
Hours later, as the day winds down, Castiel finds himself on the porch again, alone this time. Anna had said that she left a toy out here while they sat with Hannah earlier and Castiel had offered to grab it. The chaos of the house had increased as supper approached and even if the break was only a few seconds long, he relished the calm.
“Cas- I, what are you doing up?” He asked because, ya he had finally figured it out but there was no way he was just going to jump right into the conversation, he needed to psych himself up for this and he wasn’t about to do it with an audience, even if that audience was him, well not
“Ah it’s no mind,” Dean says, hoping to not let on to how much he enjoyed the embrace. “We’re just glad to be welcomed so warmly.” Cas moves towards him, standing close and some of his lingering nerves quiet down with his proximity. The backs of their hands knock together as they stand there listening to Jody.
“Pardon Ma’am but it was time for me to move on, begin my life properly. I was hoping to stay with Dean while I do so.”
His mouth is sealed around all of the words Cas needs to hear, all the words that he needs to say. How can he even begin to tell Cas how sorry he is, how scared he’s been, how he would do it all over again if it meant Cas would be safe, even if it meant that Cas would hate him.
“You seem to have a really hard time grasping the whole, I’m you, you're me thing about this situation aren't you?” the other Dean replied easily with a playful smile on his face, not at all bothered or startled by Dean's abrupt arrival and apparently finding Dean’s shock amusing. “We have similar sleeping and eating schedules because y’know we’re each other.”
Despite the town being in the direction they are facing; they need to turn around again to get to the road and avoid riding through the thick brush and forest that outlines the edge of the property. It means Cas will either see his house one more time or he’ll have to close his eyes.
When Cas returns, he has a private smile on his face and a promise in his eyes that has Dean’s blood heating in his veins. A golden glint catches his attention and he sees the flask securely held in Cas’ palm.
Cas rifles through some more before saying, “Anael says that she’s looking into midwifery or nursing before she looks to find a husband and Alfie just lost his third tooth and, according to Balthazar, looks quite lopsided when he smiles.”
I used the characterization from (for sure) the last two seasons to map Dean's reaction (even though I did not do so in-depth at all) to him dying
“What kind of pistol is it?” Cas is full of questions but he’s yet to ask the one most people want to know above anything. Cas smiles with his last answer and he can’t for the life of him figure out why he would want to be shown how to use a gun.
His breath catches with the intensity and his flush darkens, stretches further down his neck reaching all the way to his chest. Cas lays his palm flat against the blush stained skin and Dean’s heart hammers in his chest so forcefully he thinks it might beat through his ribs.
Immediately the kiss is all consuming, their hands grapple at each other's clothes, pulling and pushing without really accomplishing anything. Dean gets his hand up under Cas’ shirt and scores lines into the flesh of his back. The strong muscle beneath the skin ripples with his touch and he grips his hand at the stretch of his waist, his fingers digging into the sinews every time the heat between them goes up a notch.
He’s about to show them all—the children who have never known loss, heartbreak, grief—what it is to lose someone. He’s about to shatter all they know, shatter their innocence, shatter their hope. For all he’s taught them, he never thought he’d be the one teaching them about this, breaking their hope, their trust, breaking them.
He pushes off with a chuckle and pulls Cas back to their bed. The only light on is a sconce on the wall beside the bed, it casts the room into a yellow haze as they settle, his back to Cas’ chest, they ate through sunset, and now in the comforting silence of the room Dean can hear the telltale sounds of nighttime.
He’s holding a bowl that is steaming gently and his stomach shows its interest despite his chest feeling as though concrete had been poured to fill the empty spaces. Cas’ face was normally so open, fresh and happy but now, the haunting he thought he had seen that first night mars his face, but it’s different, it goes deep in a different way, it takes control of his body and mind, and he thinks that if he looks hard enough into his eyes he might be able to see what it is that has him so morose.
He sits, although confident in his decision, he needs a moment to collect himself. When Inias spots him, she makes her way over to his side. Without hesitation, he pulls her up into his lap and wraps his arms around her.
Eventually, of the million thoughts flying around in his head, he settles on a question that he knows Jody will be able to answer.
Refocusing his efforts, he pulls off the head and runs his tongue around it before diving back in and taking as much as he can of Dean into his mouth. As he starts bobbing up Dean’s length and down again, his own erection becomes harder to ignore. Snaking a hand down, he presses against his prominent bulge letting slip a small groan at the much needed contact.
The way his name sounds as it rolls from Cas’ tongue could, to others, sound like nothing out of the ordinary, but to him, it sounds like a prayer, a promise of absolution and he thinks maybe, with a name of his own, he could live a life others would be proud of. The way he makes it sound, sounds like he could be worth something.
“That's bullshit,” he says and his heart lifts as Cas chuckles and leans in again to catch his lips in an achingly sweet kiss.
Cas gasps behind him and Dean shuts his eyes, wishing Cas was better at hiding his reactions. “Ma?” he says and motions the woman over.
In all this planning Dean hadn’t even considered the fact that the empty might not allow Cas to leave and his stomach threatens to empty itself when it sinks in how likely it is that Cas might be trapped for an entirely other reason.
. He’s hurting Cas again and it's ruining him but he can’t listen to any of that, so he sets his jaw and lets that pain guide him instead.
It takes him no more than twenty minutes to write it all down, asking a favour he never would have thought to ask his brother had it not been for Dean.
He can feel Cas’ breath land gently on his shoulder and neck, can feel the rise and fall of his chest against his back. He can feel the nervous energy Cas radiates.
“I’m decent, I guess. I can hit a target from twenty yards.” He’s being modest, he knows it but Cas doesn’t have any frame of reference for marksmanship and he’s never been one to boast when not needed. His skills have won him a few bets and a few disputes in his history but Cas doesn’t need to know that.
He’s got a little speech prepared for this moment but with them looking at him like he might hold the answer to all their problems he just drops into a chair, hands folded between his knees, forearms laid against his thighs.
“I don’t think so…” Dean stops for a second, grappling with it all. “I knew who I was before I signed those papers, but there's a part of me that says I should feel new. That this marks the start of my new life, but I don’t feel like it does.”
Instead of falling, as his slightly shaky legs seem to want him to do, he walks forwards, sucks in a quiet breath before peering down at the paper.
“The kid looked like he was getting slammed by the same stuff Michael and Lucifer were, so I’d say yeah. He seems stronger too. Less like just a human.”
Knowing it's later than he should be up, Castiel makes his way upstairs. He changes quickly, eager to get as much sleep as he can, but he’s unable to help his underlying avidity to prove yet again that Hannah is in fact safe and at home. It may have been nearly two weeks since she had returned to the farm on the mend but there was a part of Castiel that needed the proof time and time again.
“I don't know what you're talking about man, Cas and I - it's not like that, I don't feel what you think I feel, it's not like that, you're totally off base there.” Real fucking convincing Winchester he thinks to himself, he always knew he had a terrible case of foot in mouth syndrome but that was bad even for him.
He sets his eyes at the house. It surely is a pretty little thing although ‘little’ may be the wrong way to describe it. A woman looks through a window at the barn, at him; but can hardly see him through the barriers between them. She's peeking through curtains strung up on the frame; real dainty, white and sewn, nothing like he’s ever had, or will ever have. He can see the curious young faces again in a window, desperate for information on the newcomer but forced to stay inside by their father.
By mid-afternoon Castiel is sitting under a tree facing strategically away from the house with Winchester beside him. He looks nervous and unsure of how to best balance his slate in his lap. Castiel sits with a pile of books that his younger siblings have finished with and while it is optimistic, he hopes they might be able to move into reading even just a sentence before their makeshift lesson is done.
“Sir, I—” he begins quietly. “I can’t read, nor even write, either, but I sure am mighty good with horses, and I’m plenty strong so I can mend them broken fence posts and lines out-a-ways. And I swear I don’t need nothing more than a hot meal and a warm place to sleep.” He’s being truthful; keeping the lies to a minimum is his best option here. Getting caught in the web of them all is what’s gotten him into trouble all his life.
Dean gets cornered by his alternate universe self and gets some sense talked into him. Which just so happens to be overheard by a certain angel.
He was still guarded, aware of what he was letting slip, as though he was untrusting of Castiel, which he couldn't fault the man for, of the glimpses into his past it didn't seem as though many he crossed paths with could be trusted not to have ulterior motives behind their façade of wanting friendship.
The burn is stronger this time, what with Cas’ fingers being thicker than his, but Cas refuses to sink his finger in any faster despite the pleading noises that he keeps making. His mind has a singular focus, everything narrows down to how Cas feels inside him. Everything narrows to Cas underneath him, hard and wanting, lost to their shared pleasure but still refusing to rush the act, refusing to hurt him unintentionally.
He closes his eyes for a moment, his hand still connected to his name before eventually backing away from the tree and heading back inside, quickly blinking tears from his eyes.
Cas wakes up he’ll want a nip or four of the whiskey, when, in his periphery he sees the two men. A second later he’s jogging over to their bodies. One of them—Alastair—landed face up, his blank eyes staring unseeing into the sky.
On his ninth day on the farm, Hannah had returned feeling a far sight better than she had according to Cas. She was still on rest but she was home, and Dean could feel the farm and its occupants release a collective sigh of relief at the good news.
He manages to gather the metal facilities to mouth along the flushed skin of Cas’ neck, he pinches the lobe of his ear between his teeth and pulls, he prides himself in Cas’ answering groan and roll of hips against his ass.
No sooner than he stands does Cas trip over his foot which has tangled itself in Dean’s blanket. A peel of laughter bursts from Dean’s chest, the force of it sending his head craning backwards. Cas is staring down at him with a look of annoyance but the mirth in his own eyes betrays him. Giving in, Cas slaps his palms against the outside of his thighs as a slightly gummy smile breaks out across his face.
“Don’t mistake me, I am interested in Ringer's abilities but why would I care more for the horse when I’m here to inquire about his handler?” Jody says looking between the two of them.
His moan is cut off when, right after Cas gets a hand around him, he squeezes the smallest bit at his base.
“I’ll worry about that, you just focus on getting everything together. And hey, when you get Jack's blood let him know that it’s because of their love that this will work okay? He needs to know how much he’s cared for. Shit and make sure he’s ready for this please, this isn't a small ask, he needs to be sure.”
“My ma didn’t think she’d ever settle down, she's told us as much before. She went to college,” he pauses at Dean’s expression before clarifying, “My mother's side of the family is quite influential, affluent even, so she was able to go to college, she studied and worked but then she met my pa. I don't think she ever regretted her choice to be a mother over becoming a nurse until Gadreel.” Cas looks down at his hands, brushing some of the dust off of his palms from where he had used them to balance himself while checking Dean’s leg. He lets out a heavy breath and continues, “She taught us all to some degree, most of it was as a punishment of sorts. If we caused the injury to whomever we needed to be responsible for it getting dealt with so they could get better.”
Dean didn't really know what to do with himself, he so often portrayed that ‘overly sure of himself’ facade that he usually ended up believing it himself, he found it quite disorienting to be so obviously lost about what to do, so much so that he just closed his eyes, using a child's logic of, if I can't see it it can't see or hurt me.
“It takes two to fight Cas, or it takes one to spur on a fight and one to hit. In my case, it's a bit of both.”
Sensing that he wants some story to help him understand why he knows of such things enough to use it in their lessons, he starts, “When Sam and I were young, after our father died, someone found us. We hadn’t found shelter yet so we were easy to spot. They must have written someone, probably someone at the home about us and one day we were picked up, told we had to go with them,” he fights valiantly against the thickness in his throat. “We spent maybe a week or two in the home, Sam honestly enjoyed it, I didn't hate it mind you, but I wasn’t gonna call it home if I could have helped it.
Cas is shaking above Dean as he lowers his weight fully on him, though he soon shifts down to lie beside Dean on the dirt.
His hips thrust forward, rutting their cocks together as he licks his way into Cas’ mouth, he lets their tongues tangle lazily basking in the joy of not having to rush.
Dean sits stunned for a moment watching as Sam gets his heightened breathing under control again. When Sam seems like he’s not going to hyperventilate Dean figures it’s safe for him to speak.
He had appreciated the fact that Gabriel hadn’t ever brought up the event again, though he still sometimes looked at Castiel as though he was trying to convey some type of understanding of the situation. Now though, the look of understanding is simply grating.
Deans fisted his hands at his side, willing his body and mind to calm down but he lost the battle. How could Cas be so fucking reckless, so lacking in self preservation and common fucking sense as to offer himself up to the hell scape for angels. How could he have thought that Dean could live without him like that, that Sam and Jack would be able to carry on.
Nerves of his own ricochet through his chest, not enjoying the suspended moment they have found themselves in.
“Sunshine, huh?” he can’t help but ask, his voice is thick with sleep and as he looks up, he sees a small smile on Cas’ face.
Cas comes over to Dean’s right side and lifts the shirt from its hem, Dean slides his right arm through the sleeve and ducks his head through its hole. Now essentially bare from waist up he tenses, acutely aware of the eyes on him as Cas and his ma work the shirt gently down the injured arm.
He rushes through his breakfast, getting a well deserved look of mild disappointment from his ma for putting on such a display in front of his extremely impressionable younger siblings.
“I suppose I could buy one of them, yes, my pa used to talk quite a lot about selling Ibby or Ringer even if we couldn't get them broken in. I’m not sure who would have bought them though.”
Castiel hesitates again before conceding and saying, “Okay, if that changes I’m sure I’ll be able to help if you only ask.”
“Cas?” When Cas tilts his head, electing not to speak for the mouthful of food he’d have to talk around, he takes it as a cue to continue. “I was just wondering why it was that your family doesn't seem to work your farm much.”
He debates deflecting again, but decides on at least telling a partial truth, “My shoulder gives me a hard time now and then, it's really nothing you need to worry yourself over.”
“I would think you’re quite wrong there Cassie, putting your feelings aside so often; does it not cost you your happiness?” he says, his eyes focussed intently on Castiel.
Castiel is careening towards his peak and quickly losing the modicum of control he had over his movements. Somewhere far off in his brain he thinks he must be brutalizing Dean’s throat, but the other man seems to be having no complaints. Castiel's fist isn’t gripped so tightly that Dean couldn’t move away if he needed to but staring down at him, Castiel can see clear as day that he loves this.
He barely speaks, only asking Cas how he’s feeling and if he needs to stop for anything before falling quiet again. When they stop for the night in a trail town, he gets Cas a room and takes his post outside of Cas’ door.
He tries not to seem overly eager when the man sets the basket and lantern down, thanking him before he sits down and begins. As he digs into some bread and the potatoes from the meal, he pauses, looking up because the son is still standing there, the show of propriety all but gone, his shoulders slump forward slightly and his face is marred with a look of uncertainty, though his brow is set with a quizzical stance.
” and he can’t understand why his chest seems to expand against his ribs while his lungs squeeze themselves together because he’s never heard the type of lyric that was made to hit you square in the chest because, well, there’s not been a lot of music listening aside from piano and string quartets in his life.
“I know Ma, I do. But I am getting closer to the age where I need to be able to support myself and pushing that back until such a time that I am married will only set me back further. Make it so that I can’t support myself when the time comes.”
Chapter four will be out in a couple days! I'm still not on my meds and so my ability to do things is about 20% of what it used to/should be (but I did have a very long, very 'fun' conversation with the pharmacy today to get everything sorted because it's been a week now and I hate this).
“Dean, yours may have less kind origins but they are no more your fault than this is mine. You were trying to survive, you’ve told me as much if not in so many words, hell I’ve given and been given scars for what I’ve done for a bit of my sister’s baking, and that was purely a want, not a need. You can’t survive without effort; you can’t survive without fighting.”
Dean sits back onto his bed and curls himself forwards. Head resting heavy in his palms, he’s not the only one who wants Cas back. He forgets that sometimes, lost in his own grief, in his selfish motivations that fuel his drive to set this right.
He walks through the property until the sun has taken to bleeding into the treetops. It takes less time than that to spot the house. Pretty might be the best word for it, with clean white walls; nothing like he’s ever seen before on a house. The buildings he grew up around were always brown, except the city halls.
“Hello Dean, my name is Castiel, Castiel Novak.” Cas doesn’t wait to be asked to pick up the chalk again and write out his own name. It’s nestled just below his on Cas’ slate. For some reason, it looks like it fits.
Cas is right by the way, Dean does in fact mean Valley and try as I might I could not figure out why.
Dean lifts Cas’ arm and pulls his palm up to his mouth, laying gentle warm kisses into the heel of his hand and the palm, hating how it makes something flutter in his chest, he shouldn't let himself indulge in any way, it’ll only make the sting worse when Cas sends him on his way, or when he eventually must leave.
A silence settles heavily around the table and he needs to break it or he may crumble under the unintentional pressure.
“Cas come here a second,” Dean calls. “I’m going to reload the revolver so that you have a full six shots but I want you to stand as I am now, feel it out make sure your feet are stable, secure and I’ll make sure that it’s proper after the gun is done.” Cas’ cheeks are oddly flushed and his breathing is shallow, which would be a problem if they were shooting in serious circumstances but Dean supposes that it’ll be fine.
If Gabriel responds he doesn't hear it, too focused on the fact that as he turns his head, he catches sight of Dean watching him. Dean hasn't yet taken notice that he’s been caught in his staring and as such hasn’t had the wherewithal to stop. Castiel would have said a week or so ago that if he caught Dean watching him, his only feeling would have been that of excitement, but after the week he’s had all it does is fill him with an uncomfortable feeling somewhere between anger and disappointment.
A home that brought pain and sadness along with the joy, where his brother took his last breath, and his parents cried in their shared bedroom even after Gabriel had moved in. A home where all of his worst memories are sewn into the lace of the curtains and painted into the grain of the wood, so that he may never forget them no matter how insignificant or life-altering, the pain of a scraped knee, the tears of a sibling who sits as he and their mother tend to their injury, the weight of responsibility and guilt on his young shoulders, of learning that his father has never been the man Castiel thought him to be.
Both his hands come to grab the sides of Cas’ face and neck, the pressure behind the kiss almost becomes too much but Dean doesn't care. If tomorrow he wakes up with stubble burned chin and lips bruised from the force of Cas against him, he’ll wear them like a badge of honour, proof that they made it here even with everything working against them.
Maybe he is upset about having to leave. Though Castiel can hardly think of why aside from the demoralizing idea that Dean doesn't want to leave because Castiel is a more than willing partner for any of his desires. He doesn't want to think Dean would truly think that little of him as to reduce him to simply a convenient fuck, but he has nothing else to go on.
Ice washes over Cas’ body as a thought swims to the front of his mind. One that, in all his wondering yesterday, never sprouted. Is it possible that Dean knew of his affections and as such was trying to make it as clear as possible that they were not returned?
Double checking that the money pouch and his pistol are both settled amongst his clothes and the pillows, he thanks his former self for grabbing his cleaned clothes before he went off to bed. The razor he’d been given, along with the rest of his items—though the razor is the only one of any real value—sits in the wash closet still but he doubts he’ll be in need of it on his journey.
Anticipation sends a shiver down his spine as he rocks back against Cas. Teasing them both for just a bit longer. Cas’ fingers grip into his hip hard enough to leave half-moon indents; and god he wouldn't mind being marked as Castiel’s for anyone to see. A possessive thrill sets his heart aflame at the thought of returning the favour.
Cas fucks him through his release and the pressure of overstimulation creeps into his body but there's nothing that would make him ask Cas to stop; not when his thrusts land perfectly on his fucked out prostate and cause spurts of come to dribble from his tip and milking him for all that he’s worth.
Castiel reached up, hovering his hand just shy of touching the hunter. With one last look into those green eyes, he allowed his palm to rest on the side of his head, feeling a stir of some emotion when Dean subconsciously leaned into the touch ever so slightly. His other hand came to rest over the palm print scar left by his grace all those years ago. He pushed his borrowed grace forward, allowing it to glimpse into the hunter's mind.
They were just entering the lobby when they heard the officer assuring a woman that it was unlikely her family were actually missing. She started towards the door, her expression crushed as she was turned away from help. Dean quickened his step, gently touching her on the shoulder, already pulling his badge out to show her. "Sorry Ma'am, What's wrong?"
Dean gave his hand one last weak squeeze before he allowed it to fall back. He was too tired to keep it up any more. He could feel his mind shutting down, the numbness creeping down his limbs as his body gave its last efforts to survive in spite of the rampant blood loss.
Dean dodged Cas' outstretched palm, putting up his hand to stop him. "I'm fine Cas. Not sick, I promise." He looked at the plate with disinterest. A burger and fries. Sam must've gone out to get them, probably in the hopes he'd eat it. Leave it to that asshole to go out of his way to take care of Dean while still being sort of pissed off at him.
Theo stepped forward and threw his fist into Castiel's stomach, causing him to double over as far as the chains would allow. A second fist flew upwards, catching Cas right in the lip, splitting it instantly, the blood splashing back into his mouth. He turned, spitting it out.
The morning light made it hard for Dean to gather the will to open his eyes. He took a moment to steel himself, listening to his surroundings. He recognized the far off melodies of Led Zeppelin and the hum of the engine in the still moving car. Finally he forced his eyes open, blinking several times against the intruding sun.
He pressed on, pushed by the thought that the mark may corrupt him again before he had the chance to finally check a long standing item off his bucket list. They were only three hours away, closer than he had been in a long time, and this time he could justify the trek.
The angel Dean believed to be Ezekiel lowered his head, looking up with what looked like a pained expression. "I am aware."
Dean shrugged, putting a plate and mug in front of Cas who immediately dug in. He finally grabbed his own plate and joined them at the six person table in the corner of the kitchen. "Cas' first breakfast in the bunker. Deserved more than dry cocoa crunch." He leaned back against the wall, absently picking up the paper Sam slid over to him. "Anything look like our kind of deal?"
Both men stopped as soon as they reached the library, freezing as the dread mounted in their chests.
Cas was reluctant to put down his book, but again decided it wasn't worth the effort to argue. "What are you planning to cook?"
In this new room he improvised, looping the shackle chains around a sturdy looking pipe, securing them in place.
Cas nodded again, despite Jeff's insistence he didn't. "The door won't open… I can't feel my leg." He mused, noticing the warm sticky feeling had given way to numbness.
"Hey! Leave him out of this. This is between you and me." Dean said firmly. He looked up at Cas. "Go. Get the cat set up."
"Sam, don't use that sigil!" Dean all but yelled through the phone. He could hear that Sam set down the phone when he started his work.
Dean swerved into the parking lot of the motel, slamming on the breaks, barely stopping before pulling the keys and swinging out of the doors. Sam knew he would never treat the impala like that, but this station wagon was fair collateral in his warpath to saving Cas. He scrambled to get out of his own side, hurrying after his brother.
The next time Castiel woke, it was from a nightmare. He found himself drenched in sweat, a sensation that was entirely new to him. He had not felt well before he tried to 'nap' and was feeling far worse now. Even atop his bedding, he was far too warm, and the t-shirt and light sweatpants felt as confining as a full winter outfit should be.
"There are no angels in heaven." Cas interjected. "Angels are barred from heaven, the spell has to let out somewhere on earth."
"I didn't find anyone left alive… I'm not sure if we got the last of the demons, or if there are more somewhere in the hospital, but I know at least they weren't screwing around on casualties."
"No problem." Dean replied, slipping out and closing the door behind him. He headed to his room, planning his own prize fight with his sleeping demons for rest.
Cas however was on his feet, a cell phone in hand, seeking to reassure himself. He fought the irrational urge to pace, waiting for the ringing to stop and Dean to pick up. He had to hear from him, had to know that Metatron said wasn't true. He heard the click of the phone, and his body released some of it's tension at once before his heart broke. It wasn't Dean's voice. "
Dean heaved another sigh. "I don't actually know. I did okay for a while, but I got knocked out. Sort of a close call I guess. Malachi left, Theo tried to make a deal with Cas on the sly. Cas played along or something and, I guess, took Theo's grace?"
Dean didn't so much as twitch for several minutes, internally waging a mental war with himself before coming to a conclusion. Finally he stepped forward. He reached up, opening the cuffs and letting Cas ease himself back down onto his feet. It was another moment's hesitation before he finally opened the small glowing vial, letting the grace fly back to its original owner.
"Good." Dean said. He tried to keep his voice even and indifferent, but he couldn't quite manage to keep the emotion out of his words.
They made their way down the damp hallway of cells, finally making their way cautiously up the steps at the end. At last they made it to a door that looked like it led outside. Dean came right up to it, readying to push it open. He signaled to Cas with his hand to have his blade at the ready for however many angels might be guarding outside. Then in one swift motion he had the door open and he pushed out just after Cas.
everything else is pretty minor. He's breathing on his own. After you get up to your room his doctor will come talk to you… he'll have more information." She squeezed his hand. "He's in good hands. You too."
Cas sipped at the tea to replace the harsh burn of alcohol with a gentle burn of the soothing hot liquid. "Rum can… burn an illness out of the human body?"
He was almost drifting off to a light sleep when he heard the light groan from the unconscious hunter beside him. He shifted, looking down just in time to see Dean's eyes open and then scrunch shut. "Hey-" Cas breathed.
Dean turned, studying the angel for a minute. He took in the tense posture, the set expression. He read the unspoken words. Cas felt it necessary to retain his grace as long as Dean was a danger… or rather as long as Dean was
"It's the best we have. Cas and I will hole up here and you can go make sure Kevin and the former king of dicks are settled."
Castiel let out a breath, his body half collapsing back to the ground, scattering rubble as he fell. He dragged himself up again, checking to make sure Dean was truly unconscious. He stared up at the crumbling ceiling for a moment, trying to regain control of his spinning thoughts, stop the dizzying noise of his own subconscious. He managed to table his conflicted feelings on the events and focus on what he needed to do now.
Dean crumpled the now empty wrapper and threw it behind them, not caring where it landed. He re-positioned himself so his back could rest against the door, and one foot came back up to sit flat on the bench seat between them. He grabbed the bottle of water into his hands, but didn't make any moves to open it.
Cas paled. He remembered Dean coming back that night. Soaked with blood, reeking of iron and smoke. "Destroyed?"
Dean gave a weak smile. "Yeah. Well maybe we'll explore the finer foods beyond soggy burritos one day." He pulled out a chair and sank into it, glad he could avoid having a much more unwelcome discussion with the former angel. He watched Cas eat in silence for a few moments. "I have to ask Cas, what's up with the duds?"
Cas tossed the rag aside, and Dean frowned, seeing the bruising along the bridge of the nose and in the corner of his eye already beginning to darken. "Yes, better. My head feels clearer… I no longer feel abnormally cold nor hot. I believe my fever is gone. The pain in my shoulder is gone as well. "
Dean tried to hear what was happening, tried to follow what was being said. He had been keeping stock of Cas' silence, grateful for it, knowing the former angel was trying to buy them time for some sort of cavalry to come to their aid. Now he could hear the muffled sounds of Cas' frantic voice. He knew that Castiel had lost his composure, but he couldn't hear what was being said. He tried to look up with his remaining good eye, but the movement tore at his other half, and he found his head swimming as the blackness crept in. He swallowed his nausea, trying to keep conscious, trying to keep his head in the game.
Dean swallowed. "That warding I had… in the hotel…" He fought to keep his mind from flashing back there, from thinking about it too hard.
"Yeah." He didn't want to voice Ezekiel's direct request to throw Cas from the bunker, but he figured Castiel could figure that much out on his own. "Don't know why I thought we might catch a break on this one." He gestured at both of them. "We're doing so great already, glad our luck has held steady."
"We rarely did. But a seraph fathered a nephilim and a few of us were dispatched to eradicate the problem."
Castiel blinked a few times, his eyes slow to adjust to the harsh morning light. He pulled himself upright, swinging his legs off the couch and onto the ground. He took a deep breath in, smelling the coffee. Turning his attention to the kitchen, he watched Dean pouring two mugs. "Power?"
Dean lost his fight with consciousness almost immediately after, and Cas stayed put, hoping that his body heat would help in some small way, that he could make a difference at all. He was pinned now, his good arm under the hunter, but he didn't mind. With his newly horizontal position, he knew he was soon to lose his own fight with consciousness.
Cas didn't bother to argue this time, standing and heading over towards the fireplace. He listened to Dean put both dishes into the sink before heading over and flopping down on the couch.
Cas struggled weakly. "Dean what are you doing?" He took in the hunter's appearance. The new shirt he had put on was already torn in several places and stained with a modest amount of blood, evidence that he had been in quite a fight subduing this angel.
He staggered slightly when the sigil closed, but pressed onward, heading back towards the one separate bedroom. He silently thanked Bobby for the intentional gap under the door, allowing him to lay down a thick salt line, creating a safe space away from Dean to store things. He threw his bags just inside the room, leaving them for later.
Just past the four hour mark, Cas had the passive thought that perhaps Dean had left for good, leaving him to rot here in this prison. He couldn't decide if that would be better or worse. However before eight hours had passed, Dean blinked back into the room, staggering slightly but managing to stay on his feet as he landed. He walked towards one of the work tables, casually tossing the first blade onto it. Cas bit back a reaction, watching the hunter walk into the harsh light.
Dean for his part felt the static arc down his spine, a feeling he was becoming familiar, if not frustrated with. But still he craved it, wanted more of it. He moved with the hand that tried to snake under his outermost layers, shrugging his shoulders free of the flannel. He found himself aware that Cas had at some point discarded his own coat layers. The hunter's hands were tangled up with pulling the tie from around the angel's neck before his mind had even caught up with what he was doing.
They laid like that until Dean managed to find sleep. Cas closed his eyes, listening to the steady breath of the broken human beside him. He rested his cheek against Dean’s head, simply waiting for morning to hopefully bring something good.
"It won't come to that." Castiel tried to sound more sure than he felt, but one look at Dean's face and he knew it wasn't working.
Cas pulled the drawer open, removing a flexible tape measure out. "You know a lot about broken bones."
The prophet opened the door to meet them when he heard them pull into the garage. Sam glared at him when he got out of the car. "I thought I told you to clear out."
He left Sam in his room, heading to the kitchen to stock the cooler, giving himself a few minutes to work out what he was going to say to Cas to convince him to travel at a time like this. Truthfully he was quite worried about the physical stress of Cas on a long road trip. More than that, the worry that they were vulnerable outside of the bunker. Every angel and maybe half the reapers had it in for the former angel.
Cas snatched his hand, yanking it down and pushing his sleeve back to reveal the mark. Sam noticed both Cas and Gadreel tense at once. "What have you done?"
"You were dead." Cas said at last, his voice barely above a whisper. He didn't trust himself to be louder than that yet. "I broke the tablet, and you were already dead."
Dean looked around himself, still in a daze, but Cas could see when his memories started to quickly flood back.
The hunter reeled, standing and putting some distance between them while he thought through it. He tried to reason that he was wrong. But the more he isolated that emotion, the more sure he was.
"Thanks." Dean replied flatly. But he couldn't help a smile returning to his face. He nodded as Cas returned. He had managed to clean most of the blood off himself, in an attempt to not distress Liam even more. "Let's get you home."
Sam tightened his grip on the knife, but he let himself stand still. "I don't care. You got Dean into this mess, you're not getting off the hook for that."
Dean wiped his hands on his jeans, standing to grab a bag off the counter behind him. He returned, talking through his still stuffed mouth. "I grabbed you some stuff before you woke up." He shoved the bag across the table to Cas.
"After I left, I thought I could cut ties. Just move on, maybe help Crowley rule over hell. Maybe just do my own thing, but it felt freeing. Not caring."
He was surprised how fast the ambulance arrived at its destination, the rear door opening the instant they came to a complete stop. He tried to hear the rushed report Amy was throwing to a team of medics outside the door, but it was hard to hear over the sound of the helicopter idling on the pad just outside. He shivered slightly at the sudden return of cold air, but he was quickly covered with a warm blanket. He strained to see sideways, as Dean was similarly covered and they were unloaded.
After Gadreel lent a healing touch to Dean, they continued with business as usual. However, Castiel could see the changes slowly stacking up.
Kevin on the other hand had just been sitting and waiting for them to come back. "Do you think this demon cure will work on him?" He asked, breaking the tense silence.
"Yeah yeah, call you if we can't handle it. I got it." Dean looked up, hearing Cas walk in, his stuff in a second-hand backpack that used to be Sam's. "You got everything?"
Dean had to take a moment to calm himself after the near heart attack he had suffered when he was told to pick between Cas and Sam. His frustration left him with an exhaustion that winded him a little. He excused his brother with an improvised quip and a promise to catch up with him after he spoke to the former angel.
There was a hitch in Dean's breath, his pulse picking up as he thought about it too hard, but he relaxed again when Castiel's hand kept rubbing circles over his spine. "Most of the time… it doesn't feel like much. Just a sort of hum in the background." He admitted. "But when I'm hunting… there's…" He stopped, unsure if he should continue.
Sam swallowed, looking up at the angel. "I'm going to use this bag valve mask… try to get his lungs working again." he repeated. He was strongly regretting never taking a proper CPR class to learn how to use one of these. He'd seen videos just hours before, but he'd never held one, and he fumbled with it, trying to reattach the mouth piece after he accidentally knocked it loose. Finally he was slipping it over Dean's mouth, slowly squeezing the bag.
Dean crumpled the now empty wrapper and threw it behind them, not caring where it landed. He re-positioned himself so his back could rest against the door, and one foot came back up to sit flat on the bench seat between them. He grabbed the bottle of water into his hands, but didn't make any moves to open it.
"Yeah yeah. Enough chick flick moments. Get in the car." Dean walked forward, opening the broken door once more and heading out into the cooling night air.
Dean tensed, gearing up to throw his weight into his brother, try to push him off balance, but Cas had been ready. Another solid blow knocked the demon out cold again.
Dean pushed the chair forward slightly, ignoring the pain. He put a hand on Cas' good arm. "You're doing fine. The three of us? We got this."
This managed to pull a small smile from Cas, and he felt the emotions tip just slightly more towards affection.
Dean winced at the words, wanting to tear his gaze away, but not able to. Finally he relaxed, deciding not to argue further. "Still… I'm sorry Cas."
The next time Castiel woke, it was from a nightmare. He found himself drenched in sweat, a sensation that was entirely new to him. He had not felt well before he tried to 'nap' and was feeling far worse now. Even atop his bedding, he was far too warm, and the t-shirt and light sweatpants felt as confining as a full winter outfit should be.
"You know?" Cas reached out again, taking the hunter's limp hand, and holding it in his own. "Dean, talk to me."
"Okay." Sam said after a pause, and Cas could hear him pacing as he made a plan. "Kevin got me on a flight leaving at five. I should be there by the afternoon. It's what, four in the morning there?" Cas didn't answer, and Sam continued without him. "I called Jodie, and she called a few favors. The car is getting towed to a yard, so no one can stumble on the trunk. The nurse who called...you said Dean's last name was Singer? And Novak for you. I'll make sure we have some ID to back that up. If they ask you about insurance, just tell them you don't have any. We'll sort it out later."
Cas frowned, but he turned towards the bedroom to get them. Inside he took a second to slip the coat on over his shoulders, feeling a shudder run down his spine when the warmed fabric settled in place.
Dean kept the torch up behind them as he shifted course to follow the angel veering off to the right. He kept his focus around them, listening to the sounds get closer as the torch began to show signs of burning out. He kept his bloodied arm out, grasping the blade, the pain of the shredded flesh not even registering over the adrenaline.
Cas furrowed his brows slightly, wondering where Dean was going with this, or if he was going anywhere at all. "Angels have wings… we actually just flew quickly enough we could slip through the molecules and arrive at our destination."
Books were piled high, spilling out of boxes. There were old antique looking relics piled high, a broken lamp across the floor. There was no working light inside, so Dean flipped on the flashlight on his phone. He and Cas pressed inward, carefully sidestepping the broken glass.
The hunter had to restrain a laugh watching the alarm written across the angel's face, but he managed to keep it locked in. He carefully schooled his face into less of a grin and tried to give a bit of reassurance to Cas. He knew Liam felt safest with Cas because he had powers.
Dean shook his head. "I'd be lying if I said that wasn't stressful on some level, but honestly it's low on the list of things weighing on my mind." He finished his beer and dropped the empty bottle back into the cooler, pulling out a fresh one. "I've spent so long up to my elbows digging through the crap Crowley has thrown at us and fighting just about every nasty evil thing I could get my hands on. And the entire time, Sam had me scared half to death he was going to drop dead before he could get close to completing the trials. Then he almost did for real and I just-" Dean cut himself off, realizing with abrupt alarm how close he was to letting tears escape.
Dean just stood still, and then gripped the prep table in front of him as if it was the only thing holding him up as he took slow breaths and tried to regain a hold on his emotions. Looking at him now, Sam was pretty sure that table
Castiel only let it continue a moment longer before he pressed two fingers to the hunter's forehead, sending him back into a sleep.
Sam barely looked up as he heard the angel round the corner into the library, oblivious to his distress. He absently turned over a second tumbler, pouring Cas a drink. It was an empty gesture, but one he knew his brother often extended. "We are going to call Crowley." He said, hoping his voice conveyed more confidence than he felt.
"Well, if you aren't going to sleep-" Dean turned, reaching down with one hand, intent on flicking the radio on when suddenly the air around them cracked with power. It was as if a flash-bang went off, bright as the sun and loud as a siren. Cas shut his eyes, hands clamping over his ears. Dean cursed, trying his best to come to a stop as he lost all visibility on the road. Instead he felt the car sliding despite the brakes, tires losing purchase as they sailed over the now icy roads. The black car fishtailed, and Dean tried to steer through it, keeping it as close to where he remembered the road to be as possible, but it didn't help.
"Do you wish you weren't?" He asked directly. Dean couldn't see his face from where he was, but he saw Cas' hands tense at the question.
Castiel leaned back against the hood of the impala, accepting the offered beer. He gave it a quick sniff before taking a swig, considering the flavor carefully. He looked up, noticing Dean staring at him and frowned. "Yes?"
Dean propped Cas up slightly, bringing a glass of water to his lips. "Drink… your grace is very weak right now…"
Dean nodded, but it was clear he hadn't actually processed the information. "How long was I asleep?"
"I do not. Nothing suspect has happened since we were removed from the vehicle. Although we are now quite far from the site of the accident."
Cas shifted, laying flat to give Dean the room to move. He was surprised when Dean chose to pull himself to lay almost completely on top of him, tucking face up under the angel's chin. Cas paused before he wrapped his arms up and around the hunter's back, feeling a strong stir of emotions. He let his eyes close, tilting his head forward to rest against Dean's forehead. This wasn't what he was expecting. This calm intimacy was new to him, new to
Cas looked up, making eye contact with Dean as his face morphed into some cross between fear and dread.
"Get used to it, sunshine. Because until we find a more permanent solution, you're getting force fed a top up whenever it runs low."
Dean finally got a tentative control of his emotions, forcing them back down into a box and catching his breath. His mind snapped back to the present, back to the situation at hand, and more importantly, Liam. He felt Cas release his grip.
Dean was numb to the water running over his body. He was hardly aware of Cas standing in the water with him, of the hands running soap through his hair and thoroughly scrubbing his hands and arms free of blood.
Cooler stocked with beer for their trip and his mind made up, Dean headed towards the former angel's room. He knocked, slipping in, finding Cas at the desk in the room, flipping absently through a book. He cleared his throat. "Hey. What do you think about getting out of here?"
Dean had barely put the car in park before he was out of the car, running past the bunker door, starting down the trail he remembered following Cas through.
Dean held his gaze, that smile still in place as he flipped the blade around and neatly plunged it right through Hannah's chest without looking back.
"And what possible reason do you think could convince me to do that?" Cas asked, sinking into the chair in the corner, keeping the metal table between him and the demon.
Castiel was doubtful the Men of Letters had anything for this unique set of circumstances, but he was hesitant to dash Sam's hopes.
Malachi gave an abrupt nod, and the other angel dragged Sam to his feet. Dean was able to get a better look at him, his heart clenching as he saw the blood. There was a lot of it. He looked closer though, and could see the stoic expression regarding Crowley with no sense of recognition. That was Ezekiel, not Sam. He could only hope that meant Sam had been spared the bulk of the torture.
"Yeah, you're here in the hospital with me, sure. And living at the bunker. Not slogging through an apocalypse with no end in sight that was started by me. Not..."
Cas straightened up, coming to lean against the car as Dean worked to untie his restraints and remove the tape over his mouth. "Hey, hey hey… are you okay?"
"Similar." Cas concluded. He flexed his fingers sticking through the brace the doctors placed on him.
"When I took over, he had already killed the demons in this room. He needn't know I helped with the halls."
Dean latched onto that for justification. "Exactly! He used to be an angel, snap his fingers, find himself anywhere in the world. Gotta be feeling more trapped than me. Sunlight, wind in his hair, do a world of wonders." Dean tried to paint on a confident grin. "Besides, New York? Eh? I'm not gonna let him try Buffalo Wings anywhere
He sighed gently when Cas walked back without thinking about it, settling back down on the too-small couch and leaning his weight against the hunter. Dean continued to keep watch through the night, listening to the raging storm outside mix with the steady breathing of the man in his arms.
Castiel slipped his hands beneath Dean's t-shirt, his hands brushing by his ribs, causing the demon to shudder involuntarily before he lifted his arms and allowed the fabric to slip loose. He reached down with the intent to undo the first button of Castiel's shirt, but the movement was too delicate for how his body shook. After mere seconds he gave up, instead ripping through the shirt in one fluid tug, the button snapping free under the rough attack. Cas leaned back just enough to yank the sleeves off his arms.
Dean's racing heart was starting to slow, and with it came the guilt. He fumbled for a moment before grabbing a cloth from the infirmary kit, and handing it to Cas who promptly pressed it to his bleeding nose. He shakily sat back down on the corner of the bed. "Let me see…"
"Metatron told me you were dead. I didn't believe him. I called your phone and Sam answered. I killed him without even thinking about it." He shuddered. "I helped Sam carry your body back to your room." He took another breath. "You were just dead. And then, the mark brought you back."
He frowned, the feeling of dread quickly building and closing in on his heart. He wasn't ready to face whoever was inside.
This time however Dean did not seem comforted by the meaningless movement. "I don't know, man. I just… I couldn't deal with seeing Sam, but we needed to talk."
"Dean…" Cas' voice was low, though he wasn't sure if it was with warning or assurance. He could see the demonic face… could see the darkness twisting through the remains of Dean's soul, but it was still recognizably
Dean turned again, looking over the kid a little more closely, using the distraction of taking care of someone to focus his attention. He kept his voice soft, careful not to touch him, knowing it'd only startle him. "Hey Liam." He started softly. "I know that was scary, but I want you to know we're safe right now." He assured.
The hunter tried shifting slightly, trying to nudge Cas' head away from the center of his chest where it put some pressure on his wound. He groaned, scrunching his eyes but still delaying opening them. "Cas, you gotta shift, man." He mumbled. He raised his hand up to push the angel's head aside if he had to. His hand made contact with and looped into the soft hair, but he paused. Too soft… and then… he moved his hand slightly.
Cas scrunched his eyes, not sure the relevance, but he figured she wouldn't ask if it wasn't important. "November 12th, I think."
Cas bowed his head, focusing his gaze on one of the books on the table. "Dean was… It was hard to see him like that." He sighed. "I've been trying to keep him away from the news channels. I was glad didn't search for it on his own."
"It is a noble endeavor. I suggest you confer with your vessel on occasion. The type of human who let an angel in is likely one who could use some guidance themselves. But there might be things of this world he can teach you as well."
" The call remained open, but nothing from his brother. He hung up, standing, though he didn't grab the crutches to move anywhere. He just couldn't remain sitting anymore.
The hunter surveyed the larger cavern they found themselves in. He scanned his flashlight around, sweeping over the ground, making sure there were no surprises. He frowned, the light resting on something bright red. Glancing to make sure the two passageways were clear he moved forward to get a closer look. He stooped down, reaching out to what he could see now was a pile of backpacks. He pushed them each open, taking brief note of their contents. He stood back up, his brow furrowing as he tried to make sense of this new discovery.
Dean shook himself from his thoughts, his face flushing. He straightened up, tensing as he realized how much he had overshared. His walls snapped back into place, and he stood abruptly. "Eh, enough with the girl talk." He covered, feeling suddenly far too warm. "I'm gonna take Baby out for some gas. Want anything from the gas n' sip?"
"Got a boss looking to take a stab at the throne. We're just shooting the guard dog so we can get at the grand Winchester prize." The demon shook his head, feigning sympathy. "You know how it is."
Dean choked on the coffee he was drinking, sending it sputtering back in his face and over the counter. "That's not-" He didn't manage to finish the thought, and settled on glaring at Sam.
Dean put on a shaky half smile. "Yeah." He tried to will some of the tension out of his shoulders as he took the plate and added it to the growing pile of dishes. "I'm fine, just, still catching up to the last few days." Putting it lightly.
Dean was working through whiskey number two, flipping casually through a magazine of classic cars when he heard a rustling sound coming from the doorway. "Two AM Cas, that's not bad. How-" He stopped, looking up at the angel slumped against the door frame looking paler than Dean had ever seen.
"The crash could have been worse. You are a skilled driver." Cas pressed on, in spite of Dean's face.
"'M too cold." Dean weakly tried to pull the blankets closer to himself, but he was already bundled and his arms wouldn't cooperate. "Cas?"
He watched the former angel leave and sighed. Cas' preferences seemed to lean towards seeking being alone when he was sick. Sam was usually the opposite. Normally Sam was all about privacy, but the second he got a little feverish he was the little brother again. Dean's instinct was to do anything and everything to get Cas better, but he had to respect that Cas would tell him when he needed something for the most part.
Cas closed his eyes, letting his hands fall to his sides, trusting Dean to hold him up. "I thought it was just a cold."
the ice." He pulled out his books, flipping to a tabbed page that was set aside specifically with a list of car parts that could service a 67' Impala. "Though come to think of it, don't. You halfway keep the lights on around here."
Cas ignored him, figuring that Dean would leave well enough alone rather than break through the door.
Cas listened to Dean describe everything left in finishing the repairs on the car, just relieved to hear the hunter talking so easily about something that wasn't life or death. He watched with curiosity as Dean's phone chimed a message alert.
"I know." Sam was quiet for a few minutes, and Dean had thought he was done, but it seems his little brother was just thinking. "What's up with you and Cas? You seem… flustered. What happened after Crowley got me out of there?"
-" He shouted, trying to break through to him, though he didn't have much hope that he could. He barely dodged another swipe of the knife, crashing back against the cabinets. He forced himself again to his feet, and dove forward, ignoring the blade cutting into his hands as he started to wrestle for the knife. He gripped hard enough to crush the demon's fingers, wrenching them and managing to pry it free, finally able to throw it as far as he could.
Castiel managed to win his fight against tears for the moment, blinking a few times, and sighing, still not trusting himself to look at Dean. "I can move, give you more space." He began to shift his weight, getting ready to slip from under the covers, and scoot at least across the bed and up against the headboard. He was surprised when Dean's hand reached up and landed on his shoulder. He finally looked down, making eye contact with the hunter.
Still, he had to admit, there was something. Something he couldn't put words to, but he and Cas never had seemed to struggle with the lack of a label.
"Dean!" Cas began running, his feet sinking deep into the sand. His knees dropped into the soft earth beside the hunter, his hands reaching out and grasping onto his shoulder. The hunter was once more slicked with blood, as he had been when he returned to the hotel that first night. His hand still gripped the first blade as it dripped crimson onto the pale sand.
Back on the road, Dean made good time towards Kansas. When he was too tired to continue he debated whether or not to find a motel, but he knew it would just give him another chance to doubt, to consider running after all. With or without Cas.
The hunter dropped the cloth in a metal bucket in the corner, and poured the rest of the lighter fluid to soak through. When it was fully saturated, he took the time to properly wrap and tie the denim strips around the broom handle. He sat back, satisfied. "That ought to last longer than last night."
Dean was still under the car when he heard the door to the bunker swing open and then shut, and a pair of footsteps walk across the garage floor. He kept focus on the task at hand, inspecting the drive shaft for any cracks he might have missed. "Hey Cas, can you hand me that flashlight?"
He struggled now, trying to twist away from the hands that would cause him more pain, but instead a palm rested on the side of his face, and he was surprised by just how gentle and tender the touch was. He felt the familiar pull of healing surge through his skull, and he felt the flesh knit back together around his eye. Finally he could open them and he looked up to come face to face with Castiel. "Cas?" His voice was still hoarse, and he coughed when he tried to clear his throat.
"It is not necessary." Cas replied. "I have treated it. After you convinced April to revive me, most injuries were completely healed. This last one had been larger, but it too was lessened greatly. I am just unused to the long time it takes for a human body to recover."
Dean looked at his watch. "Thought you weren't due back until tomorrow… and what the hell are you doing getting in, not even five in the morning…"
Right now he was distractedly flipping through a magazine in the rickety wooden chair near the door.
The boy hesitated again, but he slowly uncurled himself a bit. Dean offered his arm and Liam stepped forward, wrapping his arms around Dean's neck and letting the hunter lift him. He swung his canvas bag over the other shoulder and grabbed hold of the makeshift torch.
It was Cas who pulled back first. He froze when he saw Dean's eyes, pitch black again, staring almost through him. He was taken off guard when Dean grabbed the lapel of his jacket, pulling him back roughly, taking his lips once more. His hand shot up and closed around the hunter's arm.
Now there was a small city of FEMA tents lined with refrigerated trucks. Just holding the burnt and mutilated corpses of the dead to await identification in the vain hope of bringing some sort of hollow closure to hundreds of families.
"I am in the town nearest the men of letters bunker. I was hoping I might meet with you. There is information I believe will be relevant to your search for a return to heaven."
Sam was in the library, a glass of whisky in hand when Castiel joined him. He wasn't too surprised to see Cas without his brother. "Dean?"
Castiel sighed, looking down at the mark as well. "I worry what the implications of that are, should the worst happen in this battle. A corrupted soul… it is not permitted into heaven."
Dean nodded, relieved. He gave Sam a lot of shit about being a nerd, but he was thankful for his obsessive studies of the bunker's warding now. He kept his shotgun at the ready as they rode the elevator up to the fifth floor, and as the doors opened they could already hear the commotion. They rounded the corner, seeing the three demons, clawing at the open door like wild animals, being held back by some unseen force. As soon as they caught their attention, Dean raised up the shotgun and began loading them up with rock salt while Sam began his well rehearsed exorcism.
"And grab some stuff for sandwiches. Kevin's coming back today, so we're gonna have a lot of mouths to feed again."
"We're going to get through the doors. It's just going to take a few more minutes, you hold on." He leaned down, listening to a muffled voice coming from the radio that Cas couldn't make out. "Rescue just pulled up. They're going to be down here to get these doors off in just a second."
Castiel looked up, somewhat embarrassed. He turned the wheelchair, climbing up on to sit on the bed. He twisted, handing Dean the sling.
The hunter held his breath, holding an internal debate in his head on whether or not to talk about what was on his mind with Cas. Finally he released the tension that had built in his shoulders and sank down into his bed a bit more. His entire life was built on bottling up whatever thoughts or concerns he had at the moment, and he owed Cas better than that. "Do you remember when Zachariah sent me to the future… to see what could happen if I didn't say yes to Michael?"
Cas stood and walked over to where Dean's jeans had been tossed, digging into the pocket and pulling out the keys.
Dean furrowed his brows, snapping his head up. He was surprised to hear Liam's voice and was more than a little thrown by the question. "Am I his
"I turned on the GPS on his phone… you should be able to follow it. It says we're somewhere near Carver, Massachusetts?"
"I'm just glad we're both still in more or less one piece." Dean said firmly. He scanned Cas over again, seemingly trying to confirm for himself Cas really was okay. Once he seemed satisfied, he relaxed.
"Dean. I don't know what misplaced guilt you are carrying for the actions of a man you didn't become, but you should do your best to move past it." the former angel said, careful to keep his voice soft.
Gadreel's hands rose slowly. "Metatron met me outside of the building. He sought to confirm I had completed my task, and he requested the tablet. I informed him it was not in the bunker. He looked to consider for a moment, and then simply said he was disappointed. He had an angel blade with him, and he made to kill me. Cas attempted to intercept, and Metatron missed a killing blow. Cas dragged me inside here, and used his grace to pull me back from near death."
Cas closed his eyes, feeling the hunter lean in to kiss his neck. He closed his eyes, finally managing to push through this haze and take control of the situation. He put one arm across the demon's chest, pushing him up and off him. "Stop." He warned.
Cas pulled a face, but relented, starting to wheel over towards the chair next to the bed. He picked up and tried to readjust the sling so he could put his braced arm back inside, but with just the one hand he was having trouble.
When Cas put his hand on Dean's arm, the demon jerked back, ducking out of his grip. He squared himself up, ready to fight the angel if need be.
"I do not. Nothing suspect has happened since we were removed from the vehicle. Although we are now quite far from the site of the accident."
They didn't talk or move for close to an hour. At some point Cas had drifted off, completely spent from the physical toll the spell took. When he woke there was sunlight streaming through the barn, and he could hear the deeper breathing of the unconscious hunter behind him.
"Yeah." Dean sighed, feeling utterly drained and more than a little embarrassed at his over-sharing. He let the seconds roll into minutes, determined not to speak again, fearful of entering true chick-flick territory.
Dean had insisted they look at the body before they left. He found himself in the small police morgue, looking over the grizzly remains of one Tom Gray. He frowned, poking the tip of a pen into the wounds, taking vague measurements and making note of the flesh that was missing.
"Yes yes, fine, whatever." Dean said, unwrapping the cereal bar and taking a bit in front of Sam with an annoyed expression painted across his face.
The entire place seemed like some old prison of sorts, though it was hard to tell. The hallway beyond had something of a holding cell vibe, but the room they were in looked more like some sort of medical storage… and Sam was chained up against one of the posts.
Castiel spared one last long look at the hunter's face before he dropped his head to his arms. "I'm sorry." He muttered, though for what he wasn't sure.
Cas wrapped his arm around Dean a little tighter, sensing him wake. He stayed in place until he felt the hunter finally tense, and he knew that his walls were slipping back in place at least a little bit. He pulled back before scooting to lean up against the headboard.
Dean dropped, his body hitting the ground hard. The hunter tensed and contorted slightly under the effect of the devil's trap on the bullet.
"You deserve forgiveness for those sins. You have mine. You should try to forgive yourself." Castiel's answer was immediate and firm.
Cas and the hunter took off, crashing back into the forest, their instincts perfectly in tune with each other. For a moment they were back in purgatory, fighting alongside each other against the wild animals in the night. They both began scanning the area for a defensible position as they ran as fast as they could.
Sam didn't have a chance to run interference before his brother turned and sprang into action. Gadreel was against the wall again, an angel blade through his shoulder and into the thin drywall behind him. Gadreel grunted in pain, and Dean just pressed further, the blade sliding through his flesh, grinding against the bone. "You're damn right it's your fault. Give me one good reason why I don't kill you right now?"
save me? It was my choice to sacrifice myself for Jack and I have to deal with the consequences...It's like you said, it won't happen anytime soon,
—I'm getting there Sammy…- He responds with a genuine smile on his face trying to calm his brother down and patting his shoulder. Cas watches the two of them with a smile and furrowed brows.
in his eyes, he's about to give up on continuing with the prayer -Cas?Dean is freaking out a bit here buddy, he needs you, he's a jerk, but he's your jerk…- Dean scolds his brother with a look and pat his arm a little nervously.
—And it's not…like, blasphemy, praying for the things I pray to you?- Dean immediately turns red. Cas smiles and says.
—Did you sleep well?- Cas asks politely trying to establish a casual conversation that draws Mary's attention to what she's feeling in the moment before they both die of embarrassment right there and now.
—I want to try something…- Jack says, placing his hands on the angel's head. Dean who was relatively far away turns and comes closer and watches as Jack starts to work his magic, it looks like he takes something from Cas, the angel gets slightly uncomfortable and moans slightly in pain and then Jack stops and Cas opens his eyes.
Has he managed to literally  fuck the only meaningful and intense relationship he has other than Sam? Where's Cas? Why hasn't he shown up to say "hello Dean" yet? Why is there no peace in this place? It's heaven, it was supposed to be free from guilt and fears... It was supposed to be perfect, it was supposed to be pure, it was supposed to be... paradise.
He removes Cas's shoes quickly and sits down on the bed to get rid of his boots. Cas gets rid of the big coat and also takes off his jacket and tie too, which was starting to bother. He throws everything in the chair that existed in the room. Dean takes off his flannel and starts to get rid of his jeans, he is no longer used to lying down to sleep wearing his uncomfortable pants. As he starts to take off his pants he watches Cas doesn't take his eyes off him, for a moment he looks like he's forgotten how to breathe and Dean notices the faint shy smile that forms on his face.
—It's kinda too much, but I'm not scared, what was that? For a moment I could only see blinding light and feel extreme heat, but not the kind of heat that burns you, if that makes sense.- Dean laughs a little while zipping his pants, it doesn't look like they're going to continue this anytime soon , confusion has taken over his head and he can no longer focus on the excitement he was feeling and Cas smiles back at him and pauses his hands on Dean's shoulders.
—If you did this to test a theory it worked, I'm pretty happy right now- the ex-angel says with a humorless smile and Dean looks at him with a twinge of anger in his gaze that makes Cas wish he'd never been born.
—Sam has been in hell too and he's not falling apart with this place like me…- He says through his tears with a sigh, and Cas gently wipes his tears with his thumb, capturing every drop that dries in the touch of Cas's heat.
—I thought you were kidding.- He chuckles as Dean grabs him by the wrist and starts placing kisses on his stomach and pelvis appreciating the perfectly sculpted bones he'd notice earlier, but didn't get a chance to show adoration, he doesn't say anything just unbuttons Cas's pants exposes his rigid member and mouths it anxiously, eliciting a contained moan from the brunette, he strokes the blonde's hair and watches him taking it deep in his throat without hesitating.
—Good to know…I have to ask. How is my father here? I know, random and boner killer question- He says somewhat indignantly and breaking a bit the highly hot weather that was settling in, Cas laughs a little at that.
He didn't know how to act near the angel anymore, nor what to say, he felt that if he said anything to get his beloved out of that constant state of sadness that hit Castiel every time their eyes met he could kill the angel without meaning to. He had to protect Cas from his love. That's hilarious, Cas wanted him as much as he did, and he couldn't afford the "luxury" to respond as willingly as he would have liked. It's so fucking hysterical it's so funny if it weren't tragic as hell and cruel.
", but he doesn't allow himself to think too deeply about it as the result could be a wave of happiness. He looks at Sam and Jack, who stare at him hopefully, Dean is across the room listening to the conversation with his back turned, he turns quickly, but looks away from the situation. Cas might catch a glimpse of the face filled with silent tears falling down the man's cheek, but he doesn't understand exactly what that means. He assumes it's guilt, he assumes this is Dean not wanting to lose a brother, he assumes everything unless Dean can reciprocate his feelings. He is noble, he loves enough to want him to live to find his true happiness, and that thought sends another wave of love and passion into his poor heart. He will never be able to get over that passion, it was the first thing he remembers feeling.
He lays eager kisses down Dean's chest, he moans loudly as Cas licks and captures one of his nipples with his teeth, he watches in disbelief how Cas loves his body, kisses, licks and little bites everywhere Cas can access at the moment. He laughs a little when a soft kiss on his pelvis causes a mixture of tickles with goosebumps that travel all the way to his center making his cock tremble. Cas's hands on him are just perfect, he feels the need for his
He loves him, despite the fact that he will never be able to admit it to the angel, he knew he was lost from the moment he saw him in that barn and the lights sparks, was the way he put a knife in his heart and he withdrew like it was nothing and looked at him deep in his soul and knew
—Very intense, very beautiful...But I didn't understand shit, I'm still limited Cas, you fell in love with a limited human who can only do down-to-earth sex- He says a little frustrated, but trying to keep his good mood.
—Damn, you're good…I don't even remember you doing that, sunshine- He says chuckling to himself and he hears Cas give a smile and turns to him.
—Hitler?- Dean asks with a question mark on his face and slightly mocking. Cas slightly rolls her eyes and says right away.
He will always be grateful that Dean awakens so many things within him. Before meeting him, he thought that existence was only one way around, one destiny, he was white as a sheet of paper, there were no deep feelings like now. He only knew duty and responsibility, that's how he was programmed, a perfect Soldier of the Lord. Dean taught him that there was so much more and maybe, just maybe there was so much more. Dean's love might not be the way he wanted it, but it sure is what he needed.
the time I have left.- Dean angrily knocks on the table in front of him and ends up breaking one lamp throwing it into the wall, making everyone in the room shiver in surprise, except Jack, who was already expecting this reaction. Dean turns his back on Cas, tears sting his eyes, but he prevents the angel from seeing this. Sam who was far away just listening to the discussion with a frown says.
- The last sentence was meant to be a joke, Dean didn't plan on almost crying when he said it, but he almost breaks and tries to disguise it by pulling Cas back to the kiss. Cas almost cries too, but he squints his eyes as they kiss passionately. He wraps his hand around Dean's intimacy that pulses at his touch. He wants to make Dean come, and it will have to be the easiest and fastest way, he doesn't want to make him suffer, any more than he already suffered these days. It glides easily over his hand in quick movements, the abundant pre-cum makes the job a pleasure for both of you. Cas smiles with each involuntary moan that comes out of Dean's throat as he dedicatedly works his cock. It's extremely pleasurable just to watch the human feel pleasure in his hands, and his pants-on erection responds vividly to this in an intense way he's never felt before. Being in that body, as a real human, without a trace of grace, is unique, it's incredible, he feels for the first time as if his body belongs to him, it's overwhelming. Dean grips Cas' shirt tightly, pulls the fabric from her chest tightly as their eyes meet intensely.
It's already 2 am and Dean is tired but he can't fall asleep, he thinks about Cas and how he wants him in his bed now, how he wants him inside him, strong and rude. His eyes are closed and his hand runs over his hard cock through his pants and his mind travels thinking about Cas.
—Don't finish that sentence, Sam, fuck you! I'm just happy! Calm down!- He scolds Sam with his eyes and turns to Cas looking involuntarily malicious now.
He watches the angel's need build upon him, is even more impressed when the angel shoves his sweatpants out of the way with a rough tug that nearly rips the fabric, never taking his eyes from Dean's for a second as he does so, and Dean it just opens up like a flower for him pulling him to her center and moaning softly when he feels his hard intimacy along with the grace forcing his entrance leaving his warm and ready.
, but I can't handle it, it's too much.- It breaks Cas in places he didn't even know existed, words he wanted to hear from Dean's mouth, but not quite the way he wanted to hear, he wanted to be able to
Dean kisses him intensely and then positions himself behind the ex-angel, pressing his erection against his ass just to tease him and then he grabs Cas's cock, with one hand while the other he gently strokes his neck, he starts to make steady movements against the throbbing erection of the brunette.
Cas with his forehead resting on Dean's just takes a deep breath, silent, he can feel all the confusion of Dean's feelings in that moment and he immediately knows that he could never have it completely, but at least he can have this moment, it's far away to be enough.
—I did it for Jack, Dean...You did the same for Sam.- He says calmly with some tears running down his face now and Dean hates the fact that he can't argue with that. He was the one who taught Cas to be stupid like that saying there are people worth dying for, all those years ago. He lets go of Cas's face now and tries to pull away from him. He
—Yeah...Did you at least have fun?- Sam asks mocking lightly and Dean chokes a little on his coffee.
—You shouldn't do it for me, I don't have all that value you put on me.-  He says wistfully and Cas stares at him silently shaking his head, giving a smirk. -I may even like guys, but we are bros, you and I, I don't think of you that way. And you shouldn't put that weight on my back.- Cas starts to pay attention to what Dean is saying now -O-ok, you save my life, but didn't you stop to think how fucked up this is? Do you think I'm happy with that?!- Cas's gaze drops a little and Dean keeps his voice getting more altered by the second, and he's really angry at the moment, so it's not hard to drop shit on Cas, he you've done it before, might as well do it again if is for his sake -T-the guy I consider my
—I'll just... changing my pants, do you want sweatpants too?- He says giving Cas a naughty smile as he gets rid of his jeans, the distance between Cas and Dean's erection is now a thin layer of fabric from the black boxers he wears. Dean turns his back to Cas now and hits his aching erection a little in his underwear and opens the drawer to get his sweatpants.
Cas spoke quickly, somewhat out of breath, and more than a little freaked. "Sam… I have him. I… he's in a devil trap. I need help."
Dean walked back into his room, letting his shoulders sink in relief when his door was closed. One obstacle down. He threw his clothes and laptop into his duffel. He pulled his favorite gun out from under his pillow, doing a routine check of the magazine before throwing it on top of the clothes and zipping it shut. He slung it over his shoulder, heading out to the library himself.
"Oh." Cas said. He didn't understand the difference, but he slipped it off his left ring finger and replaced it where advised.
"If you do start coughing, or your throat hurts. You'll have them." Dean insisted. "If you get hungry later I might even be able to come up with some soup." He grinned at Cas' confused expression. "It's tradition." He had years of experience taking care of a sick little brother to call on.
"Yeah, he also spent the better part of the last two years out of his mind after he trusted Crowley, cracked purgatory, and exploded." Sam shot back.
"Dean, one or both of your lungs collapsed." He tried desperately to ignore the widening of Dean's eyes. That look of shock that was too close to fear. He had been dreading this happening. With Deans rib injuries it was practically inevitable. The biggest risk factor after surgery, not breathing deeply enough.
Dean looked up, speaking immediately, mouth still full, muffling his words. "Don't worry, we'll rehab your arm and leg just fine."
"She said he was… it was just a probe… that he was… that it was okay. He was breathing and…" He let himself trail off, not really sure what information was worth relaying. He could hear the near panic in Sam's breathing over the phone. He remembered vaguely Dean talking about a car crash from before they met,one he nearly died in, and he could only guess Sam's mind was back there.
Memories seemed to flood in all at once. Sam getting blasted away, trading Cas to Malachi, getting captured, being tortured very nearly to death, Cas becoming an angel, Ezekiel being Gadreel, Sam finding out,
Cas closed his eyes, taking a deep breath. He had wanted to do it alone, wanted Dean away and safe. Dean had come to help only to immediately get hurt from his recklessness. He could have ditched the phone, could have gone further from the bunker, could have done any number of things…
"Sam, don't use that sigil!" Dean all but yelled through the phone. He could hear that Sam set down the phone when he started his work.
"I did what I had to do." Cas said softly. He laid his hand on Dean's head again, another surge of healing.
Dean's smile finally faltered, and he frowned. "He passed. A little more than four months after we last saw you."
Charlie got a little closer to the phone. "I found a men of letter's book that talks about a couple books they lost. Books on demonic curses."
Cas had stepped out for a moment to clear his head when Dean next woke. Sam was in the chair beside him, and had caught the older hunter's eyes for just a second before the scene repeated itself. Sam found himself calling for Cas who came running into the room, his heart sinking as he saw Dean yet again trapped in a blind terror, unable to take in any air.
His feet were lead as he walked the short distance from garage to library, and he felt just a little like he was going to be sick. Inside was the sight he had dreaded since they left. Both Kevin and Sam, standing by the table, compiling a stack of books and papers for whatever research they were fixated on. He cleared his throat and both men jumped slightly, looking up at the pair walking into the room.
Another pause, longer than the last one. "The thing is, we had to shave the fucking thing, and I don't know if it can handle the cold."
Sam took in the sight before him. Dean was almost as much a mess as Cas, he assumed the fight to get him into a trap had been part of the reason the hotel was in such disarray. The clothes Dean wore now were also a little worse for wear, though much like Cas' they seemed better than he himself looked. He glanced over at the duffel and boots outside the circle, and then up at the first blade sitting on the counter.
"Yeah." He muttered, trying to think through the day's events. He closed his eyes as Castiel rubbed his hand further up his back, his thumb just brushing the base of his neck. He leaned into the angel just a little more.
Dean's body bucked involuntarily as it struggled for air, and his eyes clamped shut with agony as the movement tore at his rib cage. Cas leaned forward, pressing down against his shoulder, helping to hold him firm against further movement without putting added stress on his injuries.
The older Winchester rubbed a hand over his eyes, letting out a sigh. "As if we didn't have enough on our plate."
Dean felt a flash of guilt, looking over Cas. He was battered, and looked exhausted even in his peaceful rest. He was injured, on the run from the angels, injured and in a hospital. all because he chose to throw in his lot with him. He begged Cas to rebel, begged him to help fight the apocalypse with him. And now Cas was human, homeless, and all but helpless. He jumped slightly, realizing that Cas' eyes were open and the angel was watching him.
Dean tensed, gearing up to throw his weight into his brother, try to push him off balance, but Cas had been ready. Another solid blow knocked the demon out cold again.
Castiel let out a short laugh, though it was a hollow and joyless sound. "I've lived eons... I was a perfect soldier of heaven before I met you. I never would have imagined how you could have changed me... how much loving you would change me. I wouldn't trade that for anything. I just wish we had more time."
"You got another plan for me pushing the two of you out of here at once?" Sam shook his head. "It's this or we split up and do this twice, and that doesn't seem like the wise move to me. Cas, you first." He raised the top into a sitting position before reaching a hand over towards the former angel.
The way his heart seizes in his chest when Cas’ name shows up on his phone makes him worry that he’s going to die of cardiac arrest at the ripe old age of 41 but it's nothing compared to actually hearing his voice. Strained and hurt and pleading and
“Perhaps it was, but it allowed for me to be able to help you when you stupidly tried to make friends with Ringer,” Cas says pointedly. Dean can tell that he’s annoyed, but about the topic or the fact that a horse got the jump on him, he isn't sure.
He walks back to the gig and digs around his bag for the rounds he’d purchased. He drops a few extra into his pocket before rolling the three bullets around his palm. The metal warms against his skin, it’s familiar in ways he doesn't want to think about.
like he’s never seen. Blue like the sky darkening with the promise of rain, like the water of a lake in mid-summer, water pure and deep, ready to swallow you up, granting you a calm that only floating gives to you.
He rushes through making himself presentable, his hair is, as always, the one part of him that’s never been counted as proprietous, and is making his way down the stairs, at such a speed that would have resulted in a reprimanding by his mother had she not been otherwise engaged, when Gabriel crosses the threshold.
Dean rolls his eyes and huffs in a clear show of exasperation, “And I still fail to see why you came out here.”
They spend some time—after Dean calms down from the excitement—writing sentences. Cas starts off by saying one aloud and Dean repeats it, then they write it in turn before moving on. Cas pulls out some of his books and gets Dean to read from them as best he can, the sentences are short, the words rarely reach longer than five letters and he can understand why these books are given to children.
Pulling back at just the right moment to avoid getting smacked in the face by a fast moving forehead, he smiles down at the ruffled hair of his younger sister.
“Mine,” Cas says with an awed growl, he buries himself to the hilt once more and Dean’s eyes roll back at the feeling of Cas’ come emptying deep inside him. He feels each pulse of his cock as Cas’ orgasm is milked from him and feels each kiss pressed to his hot skin.
Dean is set to leave no later than four days from now and it's a countdown clock for him as well. Each day Castiel wakes thinking that it might be his last with him.
He knows he's being reiterative with his constant internal investigation regarding Dean, but for reasons he doesn't know, he can’t move past it. He’s not going to kid himself any longer, whatever it is that happened, it doesn't matter much to him anymore, all that matters is how terrible he feels as the days go by. Each morning he’s weighed down and wound up more by the continued treatment, and soon he thinks he might snap.
I hated the finale and I hated what they did to our beloved characters so I decided to take the piss with the finale and have them rag on it because honestly what was that bullshit.
“And this is what you want? I’m sure that my father could still find work for you here if you didn’t want to chance working with a different family.”
“Oh stop apologizing boy, I’ve got fourteen children, the eldest few have children of their own, I’ve seen and dealt with worse than this in my life. Now if you’d so please, sit on the chair there and we can get started on fixing you up.”
“I suppose you can’t,” he says, taking the small victory of Dean saying his name. He hadn’t known how much he had missed Dean using his name until just now.
Now just for clarities sake, Michael is apocalypse world Michael in this story, Raphael is in the male vessel, the other siblings are in their most well known/only vessels, and for the other children they've been aged down significantly so just imagine them in their most common/well known vessels but as children.
When he looks back at Cas his breath catches. His pupils are blown wide, his breathing is shallow and the flush is back.
He eats his way through about half of his meal before Cas speaks, “My sister Hannah, that's who was taken into town today, she's been sick for a short while now but nothing we did ever seemed to help for long. She’ll be thirteen in a few months, she always said she wanted to be a seamstress as much as she wante—wants to be a mother… The doctors don’t know what’s wrong.” He scoffs, “Ma wants us all to pray as though that's helped before. I'm sorry if you’re a religious man but what God would put sickness and death upon a family, and if he does why should we pray to him for saving?”
His nights are still filled with dreams but they haven’t caused him to wake with sweat clinging to his skin in some weeks. Even as the barn stands quiet, the calm doesn’t stray into eeriness, so he’s not sure why he wakes up in the middle of the night.
“We should probably see about Dean, huh? Make sure he’s with us before we go through any of the proceedings,” Jody says with a smile.
Cas ends up with a child wrapped around his waist, a young boy, possibly the youngest of all of them and he smiles. With the way Cas has talked about his siblings before, he knows how much they mean to him, but watching it is so different from hearing about it.
“Remy is our main horse. She doesn’t do much in terms of farm work but we have eight others here for work like that. Including our foal, he’ll be needing caring for, but he’s not been a trouble much yet. Now Ringer over there,” Charles says pointing to the far end of the stable, “is a stubborn son of a bitch, for the time being, stay away from him, we haven’t managed to break him in yet despite him being nearly three.” He nods and Charles continues, “Let's run you through some of the horse care to see if you can work with them like you said you can.”
It is the perfect meld of excitement and joy, mixed with the barest hint of apprehension and… regret?
His voice is choked off, gone and replaced with pure unadulterated pleasure, but Cas groans as Dean sheaths him inside of himself.
Cas rounds the corner and pulls up short for a second before recovering and crouching down next to Dean. In response to Dean’s raised brow Cas says, “Not in my dinner clothes, don’t have to worry about the dirt.”
Cas is silent for some time, long enough that he thinks the talking might be over with. But the man seems incapable of letting a silence stretch for too long.
“Fuck it,” Cas says to himself, just barely loud enough for Dean to hear. “Tell me you don’t want me to go with you and I’ll leave on my own, live whatever life I can, spend my days with whoever deems me fit to be theirs. Tell me you want to put our farm behind you, never to look back on. Tell me you want to forget me, forget whatever we’ve spent the last weeks doing and I’ll let you.”
“When I got to the empty it looked really scared right as I was about to blow up and then before Billie pulled me back out, it said that I made it
“Ahh hehh,” Dean stutters a short laugh out through his hard breathing, “Hmm you weren't kidding about that huh?” he groans as he rolls his shoulder, the grinding feelings sticking around a bit longer than he would have liked.
His arousal curls tighter in his groin with every press of their hips and flick of Cas’ tongue on his skin, in his mouth, and as it whispers filthy things into his ears.
“Just fine by yourself huh?” he watches as Dean jumps, clearly not having expected to have anyone near him. Dean recovers quickly and turns marginally towards him.
“I think I have to go,” Cas says quietly, almost as if he didn’t want Dean to hear so that he wouldn’t actually have to leave. “Kali might kill Gabriel if he makes her stay up too late so that I can be out here.” Neither move right away, their bubble too all encompassing to shatter so carelessly.
As usual, he takes Dean his dinner, and as is their new normal, the air is heavy with tension. Dean can feel it too but neither attempts to fix it, not knowing where to begin in the slightest. Castiel still takes what he can from their limited time together, gentle touches, soft smiles, stories shared. He makes memories with Dean while he can, not knowing if he’ll ever get the chance to again.
from it, he was always stuck in his ways and with each move—be it place to place when they’d been run out of wherever they’d been sleeping or the bigger moves where people knew nothing of him—he’d forget bit by bit that he wasn’t always like that. He forgot until there was no part of his mind that could remember.
Cas comes up close behind Dean and, drawing him close, he says, “Come on, let's get settled in.” He pulls on his arm to get him to walk towards the house.
“Okay enough!” Dean said cutting him off before he can say without a shadow of a doubt what they - he - hadn't put words to. “Holy fuck shut up, you might have had a life that was more sunshine and roses than I’ll ever get to see but that’s the exact reason you got to be with him. I won’t ever get that luxury so I’m not going to fuck up again and lose him as a friend because you got the chance to live the life I always wanted. And how about we talk about how you talk about Cas like he’s gone? You lost him what? A day ago? There's no way you're that well adjusted to have already passed go, collected your 200 and landed at acceptance,” Though the other him didn't seem overly phased by the possible loss of their - his - father, but he knows that Cas ranked well above John in terms of just about everything, after all they've been through, “There's nothing heaven or hell, fuck even those two couldn’t do shit, that would keep us from him.”
“Were you ever able to keep in touch with the people in the places you’d moved on from?” Cas asks snapping Dean so harshly out of his thoughts he’s surprised he didn't get a physical injury.
"Yes." Dean said simply. "Now I understand you were one of Metatron's loyalists? Explains why I found you in that gutter. You are running. From Hannah and her army."
"Day one was less than exciting." Sam shrugged. "Half the stuff they talked about wasn't even true."
Dean allowed the kiss, holding himself back from deepening it, allowing Cas to guide the outcome this time. He breathed, forcing a part of his mind to keep his emotions in check. He feared a repeat of the loss of control he had experienced last time they got close.
Dean for his part felt the static arc down his spine, a feeling he was becoming familiar, if not frustrated with. But still he craved it, wanted more of it. He moved with the hand that tried to snake under his outermost layers, shrugging his shoulders free of the flannel. He found himself aware that Cas had at some point discarded his own coat layers. The hunter's hands were tangled up with pulling the tie from around the angel's neck before his mind had even caught up with what he was doing.
"You kill me. But here we are and my lovely mug remains well out of your reach. I have something that may interest you."
"Maybe he couldn't get rid of his wife's stuff, but wanted it farther away." Sam suggested. "It would explain why he never bothered to tell us."
"It seemed to originate from inside the vehicle." Cas offered, eager to ease tension as he noticed the hostility grow in Dean's voice with his frustration. "Dean hesitated when we entered the vehicle at Duffs, but ultimately nothing was amiss."
Cas considered this, knowing what Dean was actually apologizing for. He felt a complex stirring of emotion at the thought. But his mind then returned to the moment Dean arrived from his slaughter on the Cape, soaked with blood, a wild spark in his black eyes. He shuddered at the thought, finding his mind spiraling once again. He was brought back when the strong arms around him hugged tighter.
"Maybe next time you're reaching for colder climates, try and swap out your wheels for something that might actually steer
"If the demons think you have Crowley, they're going to be looking for him. What if they find the bunker?"
"I need…" Dean swallowed, trying to keep his voice from shaking. "If things go sideways I'd feel better knowing there was someone who could stop me."
These feelings weren't foreign. They were incredibly similar to something Dean kept carefully locked away.
"Dean." Cas dropped the cloth, stepping forward, looking over Dean and trying to be sure that he bore no injuries. His eyes came to rest on the split knuckles of his right hand.
"Unconscious. I don't think he's woken up yet, but his doctor is supposed to find me after they decide what to do with him. She said..."
Sam felt a little better, seeing his brother out with any expression other than the grief he wore last night. He knew it was probably a facade, but just the fact he had himself together enough to put on a front was an improvement.
The angel caught it and walked immediately back towards the bedroom, depositing it safely on its charger. He came back without it, tracking Dean to where he was now preparing some sort of breakfast.
Cas wasted no time pulling off to the side of the highway, putting the car in park and reaching out to put a hand on Dean's shoulder.
In the morning Dean woke to a fair amount of noise outside the door of the room. He wasn't yet willing to pry his eyes open just yet, finding himself warm and relaxed. The feeling was swiftly receding however, the return to consciousness bringing with it the return of pain. He groaned, hissing with the jolt that even that caused. Finally he focused on the sounds, realizing it was Sam getting ready for the day, sounding a little like a bull in a china shop. He withdrew his arm from what he realized was Cas' chest, trying to tamp down the knee-jerk embarrassment he felt. He moved backwards as gently as he could, trying to avoid causing himself as much discomfort as possible.
