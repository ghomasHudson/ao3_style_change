Sherlock grinned madly and practically leapt into John's arms. "John," he purred seductively, before instantly claiming his lips in a heated rush.
"I decided coffee and bees can wait for another time. The only hot and sweetness I want right now is you."
Carl beamed. "See Big Seb? Your little boy toy even understands we just want to have some fun with the ladies."
John shook his head and laughed. "Yes, Alpha." He picked up the cup, squinted his eyes, and downed the medicine in one shot. "Ugh, that does not taste like cherry. False advertising." He handed Sherlock the cup and reached for the water bottle, quickly opening up the cap and taking a long drink to get the bitter aftertaste out of his throat. "Thanks love," he said when he was done.
Coach Stewart, who'd been standing on the sidelines, walked up, and clapped his hands once for attention. "All right team, enough chit-chat. But I think it's great Tim and Victor here are up for Culverton Smith royalty," he playfully teased. "Let's get practicing if we're going to beat the pants off the Gators!"
"So uh, you still want to dance? I have to think about bonding, but if you do what you just did on a continual basis, it probably wouldn't take long for me to make up my mind," John said, a little sheepishly.
It's unbearably hot in London. How hot? Well, I'm in my office, air blasting as high as it can go, and I'm wearing a short-sleeved polo shirt and lightweight trousers. Normally I'd rather be out on the street, but today is paperwork day and I'm grateful to be stuck in my office for my shift filing reports and typing statements.
By now, there was a crowd that had formed a vigil for John at the hospital, so nurses moved everyone into a larger waiting room that had couches. A television was mounted on the wall, but it wasn't on.
"As many as I can, so Sherrinford will know I mean business, and everyone will learn their lesson and start being more tolerant and compassionate." The killer took a deep breath. "I must go now. Remember, you'll never know when or where I'll turn up. No one is safe.
Meanwhile, in Room 842, John, dressed in nothing but his camo pants, boots, dog tags, and an olive green baseball cap on his head, was doing his bullhorn trick on a the very hard penis of a very stimulated twenty-six year-old named Owen.  The short, sturdy brown-haired man was blindfolded, gagged, and trussed, all at his request.
Richard took his wife's hand and squeezed it. "I'm here sweetheart. So are Sebastian and Henry. You really scared us tonight, but we're glad you're okay and you'll be coming home soon, and we're going to work this out, whatever's bothering you, I promise."
"Mr. Auden likes you Mom. He told me so the last time I was at church. He told me I had a very pretty mother."
"It's going to be hard to concentrate so it's a good thing they're holding off on full classes until Wednesday. Still, it's scary knowing there's a murderer on the loose."
John had Sherlock on his mind. He had promised to see him once he got back. He shouldn't have done it, but Sherlock sounded so sad over the phone, and John, being the nice guy he was, gave in. He was probably manipulating him to get what he wanted---John suspected he did that a lot while back in England---but he didn't want to dwell on it. Besides, he could tell Sherlock this would be the last time they would be alone together before school started next Tuesday, and John didn't want to come off as weak and easily played.
She wanted to murder Sherlock Holmes. She wanted to march right down to the jail and bash his slimy brains in for trying to rape her baby. When Sebastian Wilkes molested and tried to kiss him last year, she had confronted his parents and threatened to press charges, but John had talked her out of it. He was afraid of harassment if everyone knew he was bisexual. He was afraid that people would blame him for Sebastian’s actions. So she dropped it. Then Sebastian had apologized, only because he found a boy that wasn’t repulsed by him and he got what he wanted.
Unlike Sherrinford, the weather there was warm and sunny, and the skies were a brilliant azure blue, with no clouds in sight. John and Harry were at the beach, waxing their surfboards in their spot on the sand. There were a few people out enjoying the ocean breeze and the surf, but it was still morning.
John seemed to sense what Sherlock was thinking. "Hey you, want to get our drinks to go and get out of here?"
“No Mom. But tell Mrs. H. I said thanks.” John’s mouth started to water in anticipation. Her burgers were the best in town.
"Don't you dare. If anyone else but me answers the phone, the both of us we'll be in big trouble. And don't pay any more late night visits to the house either. My sister nearly shit a brick when she found out you were in the backyard last night." John narrowed his dark eyes and pursed his lips at Sherlock.
Rosie was at Molly's for the next few days. Tonight she was participating in an all girl's party with the pathologist and her sister Jenny, who was visiting for the holidays. Molly had sent the boys pictures of Rosie enjoying a manicure and pedicure, with the little girl proudly showing off nails and toes painted a glittery pink. Sherlock and John were happy she was having a good time, and being kept away from the flu germs.
He wrapped his arms around Sherlock. "I can't do this anymore. You were right, always are. Harry needs to grow up and deal with her personal problems without me always running to her. I just hope this time, it works out. If not, I have to face the fact that it's her choice to be a mess and stop this delusion that if I play caring little brother enough she'll see the light."
"You're welcome to stay for dinner Sherlock. You know she doesn't mind anymore." John peered into his eyes, which now were a shade of aqua, like a clear ocean on a calm sunny day.
"Yeah, they did a pretty good job." Harry spotted the soda fountain and squealed. "Oh cool---look John! We can get root beer floats!"
"Mad? Why would I be...oh wait...Eurus." John shook his head. "No. She shouldn't have pushed your brother into the pool, and none of it was your fault."
"He's sure to be close to where John is staying Mummy. More than likely he's at a nearby hotel. He has the money to pay for a room," Mycroft reassured. We would just check all of them, give a description of Sherlock, find him, and bring him home."
"Hey you two, save it for the wedding night, I'm starving!" Victor called out, interrupting the romantic moment.
Then all hell broke loose. Wilkes somehow got out of the officer's hold, grabbed his gun, and before anyone could stop him, he raised it, aimed it at John---and fired.
"Have a seat John. We're just waiting for the last member to show up. It takes him a little more time because he's in a wheelchair," Lee told him.
Jim lustily pressed his lips to hers, arms tightly coiled around her waist. She was returning his affections just as heatedly. After a few moments, she smirked at him and pulled the straps of her slip off her shoulders, letting it slowly and sexily fall off her body. Jim could only gawk as the blood rushed to his head and below his waist. She took his hand and led him to the bed. "Come on Jimmy, I need you. We need each other. No regrets, no worries, just you and me and the falling rain."
With the holidays coming up, I'm going to take a short hiatus and resume the story after Christmas. Happy Holidays!
“Does she like me? I mean, more than like a friend? I've caught her sneaking glances at me and I know she’s had to talk about me to you…” His brown eyes bored into John’s, as if trying to mentally coax an answer from him.
Dave remained calm. He had enough years under his belt to know many people who accused someone of murder did it because they didn't like said person. But right now anything was better than nothing. "Who do you suspect?"
John and Sherlock were lying side by side on their blanket, relaxing and digesting their picnic lunch of fried chicken, apple pie, and iced tea. Life had become quiet and idyllic after the two married and decided to give up the fast-paced and sometimes dangerous life catching criminals in London for early retirement on a farm in Exeter. John had spotted the property while the two were there for a case and fell in love with it. They had toured the farm, which sat on 58 acres. Along with the apple orchard, there was also a place for horses, and there were some buildings behind the main farmhouse that could be used for a variety of purposes.
“To answer your first question, I’m Eurus Holmes and I’m fifteen, although you didn’t ask my age so either you knew it already or you felt I was close enough to your age not to care. Second, I didn’t cut up your friend, I just nicked him in the arm. He’ll live. Third, even if I did try and drown a baby duck, there are tons more down at the pond so one dying isn’t a tragedy, and fourth, yes, I do expect you to go on a date with me. You’re interested.”
A few minutes later, an extremely good-looking man, tall and thin, with light brown hair and bright wide green eyes walked out of a door behind the desk. He had on a tight white short-sleeved polo shirt and khaki cargo trousers. "Mr. Watson?"
Mycroft sent over a bottle of expensive champagne and get well wishes. It was chilling in the fridge and the two decided to save it for midnight. They figured it would go well with their flu medication and would send them into a deep sleep they hoped would help them feel better.
"Haven't you and that brother of yours done enough to terrorize our children? John had to leave town because of what he tried to do to him!"
He pulled out his police badge. "Business ma'am. I'm Officer James Sholto from the Sherrinford Police Department. I'm investigating a series of murders and arsons."
Greg returned forty-five minutes later to see Sherlock, now wearing a pair of grey cotton shorts that were too big for him, and a Pink Floyd T-shirt. Greg was about to laugh but bit his lip, not wanting to incur the wrath of the detective. Doctor Watson was with him, a big grin on his face. "Sherlock is all ready to go. I decided he couldn't go home in the clothes he came in. We just point some Balmex on him and we need everything to breathe. Luckily there was a pair of shorts in my locker, and one of the custodians had a T-shirt to loan.
John grimaced at the mention of Sebastian Moran, images of the tall greaser backing him against a wall, trying to force his lips on his, flashing through his mind. “Well, anyone who puts that creep on his place is cool with me.” He smiled at the dark-haired girl snuggled up against Jim. “Nice to meet you. My name is John Watson.”
Outside the community center, a car sat in the far end of the parking lot. The person inside had both hands tightly gripped on the steering wheel, mind filled to the brim with hate and rage. It wouldn't be long now. Just four and a half more days, and they would claim their first victim, with more to come. And finally the good people of Sherrinford would realize they weren't so good anymore. That they were judgmental hypocrites who needed to be taught a lesson. This murder spree was the only way to change narrow-minded idiots. Then maybe things would be right again. It just had to be.
Saturday, I'm spending the day with my daughter and her girlfriend, but I'm free Sunday, if you are.
The two rode in silence until they reached Molly's driveway. She opened the door. "Thanks for the ride, I appreciate it." She turned to smile at him. "I'll see you at school tomorrow. Have a good day."
Henry was sitting on the floor, knees pulled tightly to his chest, his head down between his thighs, sobbing, refusing comfort from Gloria and his boyfriend. He felt guilty for ratting Richard out, and destroying their happy, perfect household. Both Gloria and Sebastian had no ill-will towards him, and despite repeated attempts to get him to sit with them, he wouldn't budge from his position on the floor.
It was all but guaranteed to be a White Christmas in London this year. The storm started out as cold, raw rain but temperatures steadily dropped, turning the rain into sleet, and now snow. The flakes were falling heavily from the dark gray sky down to the streets below, quickly morphing the city into a marshmallow wonderland.
"It couldn't have been you, you're an athlete and you need to stay clean. It's not your mother, she's very careful with her sleeping pills. When I took her bottle, it was almost full. So it had to have been your sister."
John was sitting in the cafeteria with Molly, Greg, Victor, Mary, Little Seb, Janine, and Mike. Sherlock had quickly grabbed an apple and a carton of milk and split to spend lunch outside, and John didn't blame him. He hadn't been exactly making friends his first day of school thanks to his observant mind and unfiltered mouth. John had suggested he dial back the deductions but Sherlock pretty much refused. John told him "it's your funeral," and walked away to eat lunch with his friends.
John was sitting in his chair sipping his tea, wearing a comfy pair of black sweatpants and a St. Bart's sweatshirt when Sherlock arrived, carrying a bag of food. "I'm home John!" he called.
Wanda raced to the door and quickly unlocked it.  "Thank God you're here. Wilkes broke into the house. He shot Hal and went after my son, but I was able to corral him to the floor." She motioned for the officers, who rushed in, pointing their own guns at Wilkes.
Jim chuckled again. “Look who’s the pussy now,” he mocked. “Oh darlings, this is why ol’ Jimmy doesn’t do love. It screws up your mind and makes you act like an idiot.” He stood up, brushing dirt off his jeans. “It's way too hot for me. I’m too delicate to be out here in this mess.” Both Sebastian’s rolled their eyes at his remarks. Then Little Seb’s eyes widened with fear, and stood rigid as a board. “Fuck! There she is!”
The alpha grinned at John, and Bill nodded. "Okay. If you think he's cool, so will I." He turned to the alpha. "I'm Bill Murray. He held out his hand.
I sighed. "Yes, I know. But you can't keep endangering your life like this. You're not Superman and one of these days, things are gonna end really bad for you. But you're so damn stubborn, nobody can tell you anything. And for the last time, my name is Greg."
Sherlock took a seat on one of the stools, ordering a glass of wine. He was never one to indulge in alcohol (not when heroin or cocaine was his high of choice), but he thought he'd have some tonight. It was also an excuse to scope out the bar, and perhaps interview the bartender. Bartenders usually had loose lips, and were good judges of character.
Sherlock’s response was to slowly lick a wet stripe from John’s neck to his earlobe with his tongue. John cringed at the touch and shuddered at the moist heat on his skin. “You taste heavenly,” Sherlock darkly murmured. “Better than all the others I had back in England.”
"Yes, but usually people don't refer to me that way. Typically I get freak, or poof, or psychopath. They're all idiots. I'm a sociopath, a highly functioning one." Sherlock was smirking, but John wasn't fooled. He could see the hurt in his face.
John went back to his office to call his one patient he had that was supposed to come in at two-thirty to let him know what happened, and to reschedule his appointment for Friday morning. He saw that Sherlock had not texted him back like he usually does. John paid it no mind, thinking Sherlock was deep in some experiment either at home or at St. Bart's and was too engrossed to check his phone.
"Yeah, now I know you're out of it. You actually got my name right," Greg said, laughing. "This John's done quite a number on you."
"She's crazy and I can't believe Jimmy actually wants to date her," Little Seb hissed, the image of a smirking Eurus with that bloody switchblade still echoed freshly in his mind.
"No I'm good, this is my second glass. Let's go find a more private place," Sherlock said, sliding off his barstool.
John took it and seeing Sherlock's large hand in his gave him a shiver, the good kind. Sherlock felt it too. He'd never had this type reaction to touching someone in a long time, not since Victor in uni. But that was a memory long best forgotten. He was living in the present and hoped John would be his future.
John and Sherlock walked side by side, Brett holding John's right hand and Sherlock carrying a content Rosie, the picture of perfect domestic bliss. Although both of them weren't ready to admit it just yet.
Sherlock pressed a kiss to John's hair. "You spoil me with these meals. I'm almost beginning to miss Angelo's lasagna."
"I couldn't stop thinking about you either. You're one of the most gorgeous guys I've ever met," John said.
They stopped at the edge of the pond, looking at the ducks and geese swimming and floating in the water. They were holding hands, and Sherlock wrapped his free arm around John's shoulder, who leaned into to the taller man, placing his head on Sherlock's shoulder. Sherlock sighed happily.
"Quinn may be six feet under, but there other other Quinns that need punishing. Don't you agree tiger?" Jim said softly, running a hand through Sebastian's hair.
Then Henry cleaned and dressed his wound, gave him pain killers, and even cooked dinner for him that night. He didn't put out though, and after three days of no sex, Sebastian was remorseful and promised he wouldn't go near Eurus or anyone else like that again. Henry may be meek for the most part, but when he refused to allow Sebastian to touch him, suddenly he was the most powerful person around.
The Sherrinford Community Center was bustling with activity. The sock hop meeting had gone extremely well, and some of the women were sorting through boxes of decorations. It had been decided to do a red, black, and white color theme. Black musical notes would be hung from the ceiling, along with red and white balloons with matching streamers. Sylvia Hooper found some red and black tulle to wrap around the poles fixed from the ceiling to the floor.
Forty-five minutes later, Oliver entered the waiting room with a huge grin on his face. "Your grandson has arrived! Eight pounds four ounces, a full head of blond hair, and dark blue eyes."
Sherlock nodded profusely. "Yes." He sighed. "At least we got that out of the way. Now I can enjoy this cake, it looks scrumptious." He picked up his fork and speared a piece. John couldn't help but stare as those full Cupid's bow lips parted.
Doctor Watson shook his head. "I could, but I have a feeling Mr. Holmes does what he wants and no amount of lecturing is going to change that." He laid the chart on the bed. "Now, I'm going to wrap your ribs and your ankle and give you a painkiller. I read your medical history and I'm aware of your past narcotic use, but I believe you'll be just fine with Percoset. It'll make you drowsy, which is good, because along with the pain meds, you need to be off your feet and healing. That means no running, no tackling criminals, no other strenuous activity."
The skies over Sherrinford were gray and gloomy. Heavy rain appeared to be on the horizon and it had turned cooler. The weather was matching the mood of the town, as if it knew the terrifying tragedy that happened the night before.
John watched from the living room window as a black car pulled up to the front of the house. He saw an older gentlemen get out with a stony expression on his handsome face. John thought he looked a little familiar even though he never saw him before. He was coming to the door.
"Yes," Veronica replied. "Sidney and I wanted to put the children in Cumberbatch Academy but they insisted on attending public school, especially Sherlock and Eurus. I think the environment will be good for them. Maybe it'll make them normal." She lowered her eyes, and Sidney put her arm around her.
Sherlock smirked at his phone. He had just roped John into coming to Mummy’s party, now he wouldn’t be so bored, not with a handsome ex-soldier and now dom at his side. And he could keep him safe from Moriarty, if he indeed was the killer. Speaking of Moriarty, he hoped Mycroft was working on getting him the goods on the suspected serial killer and not sitting on his rear stuffing himself with sweets.
The radio was playing "Sleepwalk" by Santo & Johnny, its sleepy, introspective guitars perfectly matching the mood of the sky. Sherlock took a long puff, the feeling and smell of the nicotine relaxing his mind and body.
Molly froze in her tracks. "Oh God Janine, he's here! He found out where I live!" she heatedly whispered to her friend.
John looked at the large monitor screen skeptically. "I don't know about this Rosie, trying to find a partner online. Truth be told, I'm a bit afraid."
"Clarence and I are over the moon. We weren't really trying, but we did want kids. I just came back from the doctor. I'm eight weeks along."
Soon he was in the bar. It was a spacious room with a long black table lined with black barstools. The ceiling was painted to look like the night sky, with a white full moon and white stars formed into constellations. Off to the sides, were more round tables, for those that wanted to dine in the bar area.
Sherlock rolled his eyes, but there was a hint of a smile on his lips. John chuckled again. "I accept your apology, but I have a way you can make it up to me."
The body of Carl Powers, age seventeen, was found at Regent's Park earlier this morning. Police confirm the teenager was a victim of homicide.
"You better get back. I intend to spend all morning in this bed with my beautiful omega and fiance. " Sherlock declared.
Another smile, but this one didn’t reach his eyes, and the girl actually shuddered. Eurus and Sherlock would be thrilled at the reaction. “I can if you want me too.”
Said cheater stalked off, mumbling a string of curse words. Sherlock rolled his eyes and took another sip of his red wine.
Mycroft sighed loudly and shook his head. How could he get his stubborn younger sibling to realize a drug-fueled orgy with twin brothers was not healthy behavior?
John and Bill walked past the group, which earned them whistles and catcalls. John shook his head and Bill just laughed. "Obviously alphas," Bill said.
John smiled and opened the door. Sherlock looked gorgeous in a pair of tight black jeans rolled at the cuff, and a white short-sleeved button down shirt. His dark hair was lightly slicked back, with a few curls hanging loose on top of his forehead.
Just then, the doorbell rang. "I'll get that," Richard said. He went to answer the door, and saw Officer Dave Morstan. Dread and worry crossed his face. "Officer Morstan, is it about Gloria? Please tell me you have some good news."
John looked up at Sherlock and softly kissed him. "It's okay. I'm just glad to be home and with you. There's no place I'd rather be."
A tear of happiness ran down John's cheek. Sherlock wanted their baby and wanted to be a father. It was going to be okay. He heaved a huge sigh of relief. "You don't know how relieved I am. And I'm sorry I doubted you. You are going to be an amazing father. I love you so much."
So for seven years, he put his attraction aside and dated several women, those relationships going nowhere because he'd leave dates when Sherlock came calling or texting, in order to chase criminals. After his marriage and subsequent annulment, he decided to leave the dating world behind and just be content being a bachelor and Sherlock's crime-solving colleague.
Sherlock kissed him on the cheek again and then sat back in the seat, utterly relaxed and completely in love.
Little Rosie sat at the table, already dressed in her safety gear, her blue eyes wide with curiosity and excitement, as John poured the baking soda into a large plastic tub, followed by the shaving cream and oil. "Okay Ro, put your hands in there and start mixing it up. Daddy will help too, and so will Papa. Isn't that right?" he said, looking straight at Sherlock.
As Sherlock began to walk towards the school entrance, his sister Eurus came strolling up from the side, looking pristine in a mint green sleeveless shirt dress, black Mary Janes, with her dark hair pulled up in a tasteful bun. She was carrying a book under her arm. She looked like the perfect schoolgirl, and not the insane murderer Sherlock knew her to really be. A few times today he wondered if Sheridan were still alive, how he would react to being in public school. His deceased twin had been the most outgoing, the less caustic---the more
I named the murder victim after one of my favorite Johnlock authors here, cdelbridge. She posts some wacky, funny fics. Check her out!
"Mrs. Hudson, you've been such an asset to the town and we're glad you're here," Charlie praised. "It's always good to have our businesses support the town and its citizens."
Everyone readily agreed. As they left the cafeteria and walked to the parking lot, there seemed to be an atmosphere of strength and renewal in the air. The killer may have had them down, but they certainly weren't out.
"As soon as possible. You'll need to come up with an identity, a role you'll feel comfortable with when you interact with clients," Irene answered.
As Molly strolled along on the sidewalk, she noticed a white car, a 1957 Plymouth Fury with a thick gold stripe painted on the side slow down next to her. Molly recognized the driver, it was Carl Powers, and she cringed, remembering Janine's mention that he asked about her at the slumber party.
"Hey John. I've only been here a minute. Not too crowded tonight." John sat on the stool. "I think the weather is keeping people away. It's a cool dreary night, even for September, and it's a Thursday, so no matches on telly."
Another clap of thunder rumbled, and this time a streak of lighting lit up the dark sky. "We have to dash or we'll get soaked," John warned.
The day of the party was here, and both John and Warren booked a morning of pampering at an exclusive spa in downtown London. John had never had a massage, or a facial, or any of the beauty treatments women went through, so for him it was a little strange. Warren was used to it though, and had paid for everything, despite John's protest. He was making good money now and could afford more luxuries than he used to. Warren insisted, and said John could treat him to lunch, which he agreed to.
Mycroft's brain was now as clear as day and his composure returned. "I did what I had to do. John doesn't deserve the violent attentions of my brother...just as you don't deserve my unwanted attention. I'm deeply sorry Molly."
John lay on his bed, trying hard not to fall asleep, but the events of the day had worn him out, and before long, his eyes were closing and he turned his head away from the nightstand and he slipped into slumberland, images of a certain dark-haired boy easing into his mind. The radio was still on, playing "All I Have to do is Dream" by The Everly Brothers.
Sherlock ran into the bedroom, John on his heels. John pushed him onto the bed, face first. He lifted up the alpha's dressing gown and started smacking him with the spatula. "I'll show you a buttie, you horny alpha," John teased, grinning madly.
Wanda Watson sat the newspaper down on the kitchen table and sighed, wondering what was happening to this lovely little town. She left Los Angeles thinking settling into a small town would be safer, and now a masked lunatic was on the loose.
Sherlock entered the club, commanding attention in his black leather jacket that came down to his ankles, tight black jeans and fitted aubergine T-shirt that teased a hint of his nipples. He surveyed the scene, scoffing at all the boring, unoriginal weres that were either sitting and drinking or swaying stupidly to the awful music blaring out of the speakers. He wondered why he even decided to come here tonight, then he remembered it was either find something to do on his own or have dinner with his annoying brother and his mate. He tolerated Greg, actually liked him as Greg called for his assistance many times to solve cases that stumped him and his fellow Yarders, and couldn't begin to fathom why the man agreed to bond with Mycroft. His older brother was insufferable. He kept referring to them as a pack and Sherlock kept reminding him they didn't need to be a pack because they weren't pure werewolves.
"Hi love, how was the case. No, don't tell me, it was tedious since Mycroft sent you," John said, reaching up to ruffle his husband's damp curls.
"There's more though," Little Seb spoke. He looked at Mary. "Go ahead Seb, they need to know," she encouraged.
A few weeks after John's twenty-ninth birthday in September, Mary was on her way to work. She walked, like she always did, since the rest home was not far from their home. John had a rare day off and was caring for Evie.
Sherlock smiled. It was a lovely home. "Yes, and there are a lot of neat hiding places. Care to explore?"
Veronica Holmes stood by the phone, shaking. She didn't mean to mention Sheridan, it had slipped out. Now she was afraid John would no longer want to see Sherlock if he found out about her dead son, what happened to him, and why the family left England. It was already a miracle that John forgave Sherlock for his actions weeks ago and wanted to be with him. She couldn't risk her child's happiness and have him heartbroken again.
Another day in Sherrinford was coming to a close. It had been a quiet and peaceful day. School was starting tomorrow and parents and kids were getting ready to head back to class. The families of Phillip Anderson and Sally Donovan were planning a joint funeral. And somewhere, a killer was watching---and waiting.
The two sat down and began to eat. "I'm going to Tesco after my lab this afternoon. Want anything special?" John asked his mate.
After Pat left, John turned to Sherlock and shook his head. "Damn, I would not want to have her for a superior in the Army."
The reverie faded, and John was back in the present, in his chair at Baker Street, mug of tea gone cold beside him. He smiled and got up to warm up his tea in the microwave.
John laughed and Sherlock glared at his best friend and best man. But seconds later, his mouth quirked up and he eagerly leaned in towards John.
"Yes. You see, Molly and I are---well...let me give you this." She reached into her purse and pulled out a card.
The first hour of the new year had passed, Sherlock and John were feeling no pain thanks to their trio of medicated lollies, champagne, and flu medication, and decided to head to bed. The rest of the night was spent in a deep, soothing sleep together, as freezing rain coated the city in a diamond glaze.
Outside the Sherrinford Police Department, Billy Wiggins and Kitty Reilly were standing and waiting anxiously for Officer Dave Morstan and Officer James Sholto to come out and begin a news conference regarding the Sherrinford Slayer. The two were talking with each other when a KABC news van pulled up behind the KMOF van. A middle-aged man hopped out in a navy blue suit, followed by a younger man in a brown leather jacket and khakis, holding a camera. The two were setting up to tape a segment.
Sherlock and John are in their 20's. I also took inspiration for the picture of Martin in the French maid's outfit that showed up online a few weeks ago.
"Yeah, well food sure doesn't. You better eat something tonight. I'm not dragging your skinny ass out of the parking lot if you faint, like you did last month," Victor shot back.
Sherlock was beaming. "I love you John Watson-Holmes." He sat down and picked up the box labeled "1" and began to open it. Inside was a petri dish containing bacteria. He looked up at John with a wide smile on his face. "This is amazing. I gather the rest of the boxes contain similar items?"
The beach was pretty crowded; John surmised it was late morning or early afternoon. He was soon proved right when the radio DJ announced it was eleven-thirty. John ran a hand through his hair and laid back on his blanket. His stomach rumbled slightly and he knew he'd have to get some lunch soon.
"I knew you'd be coming here on your free period, which I also happen to have. And I also know that you're going to be spending it doing boring homework," Sherlock replied with a smirk.
Greg slammed his book shut and glared at Irene. "Stop stirring shit up Irene. You're one to talk, after you cheated on me
He was in a pub, which surprised even him, he generally avoided them as they were full of drunken, rowdy idiots waiting to start a fight, or middle-aged men drinking their midlife angst away while swapping stories about how better it used to be in the good old days. It annoyed him immensely.
Dave's mouth dropped open in shock. The killer had been calling the radio station. Now he was calling the reporter covering the murders.
John chuckled again. "I like history, but it's a good thing my teacher is Mrs. Stubbs. She makes it interesting. Maybe I can get you into hers, if you're good. Now if you'll excuse me, I was on my way to the library before you grabbed me like some sex-starved pervert."
John winked at Sherlock. "Brett told me last week how much you love chocolate chips. Their pound cake is to die for."
"Is anyone coming to the Homecoming meeting tomorrow after school? I am, and I think Sarah and Janine and Jennifer and Becky are coming too," Mary said.
Before Eurus could respond, Jim Moriarty came jogging over to them. "Hey Johnny, you trying to put the make on my girl?" he asked, trying to sound playful, but it came out a bit more bitingly.
"Good afternoon," Principal Saxon announced. "First of all, I want to say, this is a great turnout for our first Homecoming meeting. As you're all aware, and what the entire school has been abuzz about, the beloved Belgrave Mansion was set on fire last night."
Dave Tennant, owner of Speedy's, would donate ice cream, soda, syrup, and other fixings for a soda fountain for everyone to enjoy, and Mrs. Hudson would be doing the catering. The local radio station would be providing music and broadcasting live from the event. It was shaping up to be a fun and successful night.
It was Tuesday morning, and John was at Irene and Molly's flat. The three were having a breakfast meeting, and John had relayed to the two women the previous nights' events, including his meetup with Sherlock Holmes.
John let out a deep breath of relief and went boneless, relaxing his hands. "Sherlock? What in the hell are you doing out here? You know we've got a curfew! And did you hear what happened tonight to Mrs. H and Angelo?"
Sherlock looked down and realized he hadn't let go of John's hand. He dropped it quickly, and glared at his friends. "Victor, shouldn't you be going back to your pathetic pursuit of Irene Adler? I don't even know why you bother, boyfriends are not her area."
"Good evening, and thank you for waiting so patiently! At this time, I ask you please enter the shop in an orderly fashion and proceed to the back. We have chairs set up and I would like everyone to take a seat for the question-and-answer section."
Lucy switched off the radio and sat down next to her husband, taking his hand and squeezing it, trying to comfort him. "Harold, what I'm about to say is going to be difficult, because it also involves you...and what's been going on with the murders."
Molly was wearing a sunny yellow short-sleeved shirt dress with a cinched waist and attached matching belt. Her brown hair was down, the ends curled up into flips, and she wore a yellow headband. Her shoes were also yellow, Mary-Janes with kitten heel pumps. Greg had on a white button-down dress shirt and khaki pants with brown loafers.
John grinned like a loon. "Ah yeah, I definitely got some passionate fan mail about that. Well, even though she was a cold-blooded bloodsucker, Miranda Morstan was really and truly in love with Harrison, and he had feelings for her too despite everything she'd done. But remember, Benedict was ready to drive the stake through her heart but decided he couldn't go through with it, because he cared about Harrison too much and felt it would destroy their friendship. Harrison was the one good thing in his life and he didn't want to mess it up. Now, I'm going to reveal something---I was planning an epilogue where Benedict's brother Mark had tracked Miranda to Ireland and killed her, setting her on fire and throwing her charred corpse into the sea. But I felt ending it with Harrison visiting Benedict in the hospital and telling him nothing or no one was ever going to tear them apart again was a good place to leave it."
He heard the door close, and he smiled. John was home. And he was actually hungry for once. Sherlock slowly stood up, got out of the tub, quickly dried himself off, and wrapped himself in a fresh tan dressing gown.
Sherlock suddenly snapped his head up. “They all consented,” he said, as if reading John’s mind. “I’ve never had anyone resist me---until you.”
The man was about John's height, but much stockier in build. He had a strawberry blond crewcut, and John could tell he was furious. Maybe it was a lover's quarrel, he thought to himself.
The Sherrinford Community Center was the scene for mayhem last Saturday night when an unknown maniac fatally and brutally stabbed two attendees of the annual Back-To-School Sock Hop.
She bent down and kissed him on the cheek. "Please be careful going to and from school today Johnny."
Finally, an update! Life's been a little crazy but this weekend allowed me to do some work on my two WIP's. It's a short chapter, next one will be a little longer.
"Oh no my conductor of light, you're not taking this nap alone." Sherlock placed an arm around John's waist and cuddled close. John could only laugh, Sherlock loved to cuddle. And John loved Sherlock's cuddles.
"I did, and the reason I called is that your wild hunch turned out to be right," Sherlock replied proudly.
Before Sherlock could reply with a retort of his own, Eurus breezed in, barefoot, her dark tresses windblown, grinning madly. “Hello brothers dear.”
Sherlock smiled and kissed John lightly on the lips. "I love you too. Now, let's get some sleep so we can wake up in time for dinner. Does chicken noodle soup and grilled cheese sound okay?"
Another couple had now entered the hall, and when Janine saw who it was, she gasped loudly. Others heard her and turned to see Eurus Holmes and Jim Moriarty, arm in arm, both sporting cheeky smiles.
Lucy sighed and sat down on the edge of the bed. Harold noticed the look on her face, and frowned. "Something else bad happened, didn't it."
While waiting for the paramedics, Harold had started to relay some of what had occurred prior to him leaving the house. He had said "intruder, big knife, all black, scary mask, hit him with flour, letter opener, defended myself, we fought, I ripped off mask, I know him, I was shocked..."
John slowly went to the window, bat in right hand, while he lifted the curtain with his left. He breathed a big sigh of relief when he saw Sherlock standing outside. John unlatched the window and Sherlock climbed in. "What are you doing here, and why did you come to my window instead of the front door?" he scolded.
Before he could turn towards the track, Sherlock gently grabbed him, and before John could react or say anything, Sherlock placed a soft kiss on his lips. "I really like you John Watson."
The once hot June afternoon had considerably cooled off as thick gray clouds could be seen rolling in from the distance. A breeze had picked up, and the apple trees in the orchard were gently swaying from side to side.
Once they selected their lunches, they quickly eased into pleasant small talk. John discussed his transition from invalidated veteran to dom, bragged about his daughter, and even mentioned his encounters with Sherlock, which had the couple cracking up.
Sherlock was grateful for the heavy rain that fell from the London sky this Halloween. But it's not like he and John could have taken Rosie trick-or-treating anyway. Due to a spike in Covid cases, going door to door was strongly discouraged by the NHS. The usual big public celebrations were also canceled, along with them the Yard's annual costume bash. Even if Halloween was to be celebrated as usual, little Rosie still couldn't have gone.
Sherlock had placed Brett on top of his bed, carefully removing his trainers and placing them on the floor. Brett stirred a little, but only to snuggle closer to his dragon. Sherlock bent down and pressed a kiss to his forehead, and closed the door.
He began to jog for his open bedroom window. Sherlock watched him leave, a wistful expression on his face. "Goodnight John. This won't be the last time I see you, I promise."
"Police reported they found a single fingerprint on the fake bomb. There was a special report on the TV news about it. She must have saw it and freaked, thinking they'd trace the fingerprint back to her," Sherlock explained."
Sherlock thumbed through the Rolodex and located the information he needed. He copied the address and phone number onto a piece of scrap paper and shoved it in his pocket. He took out a handkerchief and wiped the plastic card holder clean, and carefully set it back on the kitchen counter. He casually strode out the side door and made sure it was locked back up.
While Mary was taking an order, John was sitting on a bench with his friend. “So how were the Magnussen’s little ankle biters tonight?” he asked.
John snorted. "Ok, you're just taking the piss. These damn things are hurting my feet like something else, and they do not look good on me at all. My feet are way too muscular and wide for them."
"I'm not the easiest person to be with John. I'm not good at romance, love, sex. My last sexual encounter resulted in Brett. I haven't been with anybody since then, and I didn't want to be." He looked down at the table for a bit before peering up at John. "That was before I met you."
"No, it's fine. You're a very interesting man Sherlock Holmes." John smiled at him. "I'd like to get to know you better. It's not everyday I run into someone who looks like they could be on Britain's Next Top Model and have a voice that sounds like a diamond draped in velvet."
John took off his rain slicker and gently deposited it on the empty seat beside him. He sat down next to Sebastian and gave him a sympathetic grin. "I know. We're  a lot more complex than we look."
Sherlock had told his children he and John were going into town. The twins asked if they could pick up some bread, along with milk and cream on the way home as they wanted to make honey-flavored ice cream. Sherlock agreed, as he loved their homemade ice cream, and he wanted John to try it too.
Sherlock lifted his head and John couldn't help but laugh at seeing the wide grin on his face. "I take that as a yes?"
Wanda joined him and took a long sip. "Iced tea is so refreshing." Then she looked at Hal. "You have someone covering for you at the shop?"
Inside his glass booth, which was built high so it could look down on the dance floor and give a nearly 360 view of the disco, John felt like a king surveying his people. The glass was also bulletproof, which John at first scoffed at, but given the current situation, he was thankful for. In the last several months, a mysterious and dangerous perpetrator had been following women leaving discos and other clubs alone late at night, attacking and beating them into unconsciousness. The press had dubbed the criminal "Discopath." Extra security had been hired at all the establishments, and peoples' bags were searched before they could be let in. So far, Lestrade's had not been targeted, but John figured it was a matter of time before the creep struck here.
John opened his large duffel bag and took out a pair of black cargo trousers, a studded belt, red briefs, a tube of black eyeliner, cologne, a bottle of lotion, and hair gel. He decided not to wear his camo trousers, going for a more goth look tonight. He would still wear his dog tags though. They were part of his identity, part of a past he willingly admitted he didn't want to give up, and in a vain way, he felt more powerful and sexy while wearing them. It's like the tags gave him an up with the vampires. He had risked his life to keep them free. In some way, it was having a type of power they would never feel.
Sherlock wore a suit in a pale gray that when the light caught it at certain times, looked like a light blue. The shade complimented his dark curly locks and made his eyes look nearly the same color. He had a white button down shirt that appeared to be a size smaller, but Sherlock did that on purpose as he knew how much John loved him in tight-fitting shirts. He opted not to wear a tie, he never did with suits anyway, and John told him he didn't want his long and lovely neck covered up.
John and Sherlock were pleased as punch at their daughter's burgeoning vocabulary---and they were really pleased with her when one day, John arrived to a crime scene with Rosie in tow. Donovan had naturally made her opinion known about the toddler being there, unpleasantly,  and Rosie, not happy with the policewoman's attitude towards her father, narrowed her little blue eyes, and shouted a very clear "fuck you" at her. Donovan was aghast, Greg did a double take, and nearly the whole Yard stood there in stunned silence.
John chuckled. "Well, you're going to need to if you want to pass this class and become a doctor. Not to mention if you want to get with that omega you've fallen for."
Pete shifted in his seat towards her to answer. "If you knew John as good as Sylvia and I do Susan, you'd believe it. He's had to grow up fast since his father died, he's supporting his mom financially, he's pretty much had to be the man of the house. He feels he can handle things on his own. And with what happened last year with the Wilkes boy---he's embarrassed that he's attracting unwanted attention, especially from other teenage boys. However, with Sherlock actually stalking him, he'll probably change his mind and will press charges. But that's on him. So far, he's the only one Sherlock has gone after."
"Come on Jimmy, it's probably just someone walking their dog," Eurus said, put off that Jim stopped putting out.
Sherlock doesn't say anything, continuing to pout. "Yeah, I thought so. You need to eat, you stubborn greaser."
Sherlock put his phone back on the stand and wrapped his arms around John. "Molly wanted to know how you were feeling."
Molly decided to treat herself to an ice cream at Speedy's. It was right across the street from the newspaper office. Then she would catch the bus home and stay put for the rest of the day.
"Yes. I could use a night out after this afternoon with Mycroft." She kissed him back and ran a hand through his brown hair. "Let me grab my purse and we can go."
Sherlock stood as still as possible, as any movement would intensify the pain, hoping the doctor would come in soon. It was two-thirty on a Tuesday afternoon, A&E couldn't have been that busy with patients.
Sherlock leaned in for a kiss. When the two parted, they each leaned back in their chair. John sighed contently. "I think I'm going to be spending a lot of time on this porch, especially if it rains, taking in that clean, comforting scent of petrichor. It's just the best. But not as the best as being married to you." He leaned over and kissed Sherlock gently. "Come on you, let's get inside and get some lunch. How does chicken casear salad and iced tea sound?"
Soon John arrived at the nursery and he entered the warm building. Rosie's room was down the hall, the last room on the right. He opened the door that was decorated in blue construction paper, cutouts of penguins, snowflakes, and igloos happily taped onto the paper, and saw Michelle standing in the center of the room. "Hello," he greeted her warmly.
The older boy narrowed his blue eyes and took a step towards Art, who shrunk back. "You're all mouth Doyle. One day it'll get you in trouble. Any other time, I'd give you a good smacking, but not tonight. Good thing you caught me in a nice mood."
John licked his lips and reached up to touch the scar on his left shoulder. He wasn't self conscious about it as Sherlock had already seen it and declared it beautiful. It wouldn't be long before Sherlock arrived, hopefully clad in his form fitting black leather jacket, pants, and motorcycle boots. The detective had shocked John by buying a motorcycle, and he ended up loving riding behind his love, caught up in the speed and the wind rushing through his body as they rode through the London streets and the British countryside. It was dangerous and wildly exciting and it spiked his adrenaline like nothing else. He'd always been a danger junkie. Sherlock had deduced it right away the night they met at St. Bart's, along with John's instant attraction to the genius. Good thing Sherlock was instantly attracted to John as well.
Sherlock stretched out his long frame in the tub, his feet hanging over the side. After John's "punishment" and the glorious subsequent session of shagging that followed, John had "gone omega" and made a hot bath filled with lavender and vanilla oils for his intended. John meanwhile, had taken a quick shower and left the flat to pick up pizza for them since his attempt at making lunch had been thwarted by the randy alpha.
Just as Sherlock got out of his chair, a nurse entered the room. "Hello Doctor Watson, Mr. Holmes. Doctor Watson, I have a pain pill for you. Once this kicks in and you've had breakfast, you can go home."
Rosie Watson-Holmes was now twenty months, and she started saying a lot more words. She spoke her first word last fall when she was fifteen months. John assumed it would be "dada." Sherlock assumed it would be "murder" (to John's annoyance).
"I got tired of laying there. Can I rest on the couch and listen to the radio?" John gazed at his mom with hopeful eyes.
His neighbor Mrs. Doyle had called him telling him she had leftover spaghetti and meatballs and John was welcome to it. He agreed, that meant not having to pick up dinner or throw something together right before bed.
John had spent the morning cleaning the breakfast dishes, writing up a blog post on the last big case he and Sherlock solved almost a month ago, washed and folded laundry, and helped Mrs. Hudson with grocery shopping while picking up a few things he needed for dinner tonight. When the two left, it had started lightly snowing. John had listened to the news and a big snowstorm was headed for London, with heavy snow expected to fall late afternoon and all evening, before ending tomorrow afternoon.
It began to rain harder, but John didn't care. Not when he had a warm flat, a loving mate, and an adorable daughter waiting for him. Yes, things were finally working out, and it was great.
John responded to Sherlock's beautiful words with a passionate kiss and a whispered suggestion of returning to their room for a romantic tryst in their outdoor hot tub. Sherlock smiled, got up, took John's hand, and the two were soon on their way to an afternoon of pure Greek bliss.
He thought about who might be in the school after three. Maybe a few teachers that stayed around to grade papers or clean up classrooms, the headmaster, secretaries...
"Oh believe me, they're blood. Mycroft may not share Sherlock's looks, but he shares Sherlock's ability to verbally reduce you to tears, and he's just as smart. Maybe even more than Sherlock," Molly explained. "It may be best not to make enemies out of those two. So no, don't ask Sherlock to chaperone next Friday night. Or Jim Moriarty. He teaches Year 12 physics, and he's even more snobbish than Sherlock. He only wears Westwood suits to school."
Happier than ever, John planted a big, wet kiss on Sherlock. "I'm so glad we're able to compromise. How about you and I order some takeaway and go over the list."
Henry cupped Sebastian's cheeks with his hands and shook his head. "No Sebby. Principal Saxon handled it. Marty, Art, and Jeff are suspended for two weeks. If they bully someone else, they're banned from all the homecoming stuff. You don't have to worry about me. I feel bad for Molly though. Marty really hurt her wrist and the nurse gave her an icepack and a wrap."
"Well, we didn't. We fought like hell. There was no way that maniac was going to get the better of me or Angelo. I couldn't lose him. He's too good of a cook!"
"Mom doesn't want me listening either." John leaned in closer to his friends. "She bought a gun yesterday."
He didn't know if his parents were upset over his disappearance but he didn't care. If he wanted to ever have a chance with John, leaving Sherrinford and following him to Los Angeles was the only way. It was a risk he was willing to take.
Victor beamed. "Great! There's this hole-in-the-wall bistro not too far from the London Eye. It doesn't look like much on the outside, but it's got the best Indian cuisine I've ever had."
The owner of KMOF, Steven Moffat, had been listening at home, and had called him earlier today and told him he was so proud of the broadcast, he was giving him a raise and a promotion to the morning shift. Billy accepted the raise, but he told Mr. Moffat he enjoyed working the night shift---and with a killer on the loose, he felt safe at the station instead of at home. He had an engineer working with him, Gene Hunt, so he wasn't alone.
"Stamf---oh you mean Mike? Yeah, we're friends. We went to medical school together at St. Bart's. How do you know him?"
"I hear you. I'm convinced the beach has medicinal benefits. Once you breathe in that clean salty air and your ears are filled with the sound of the waves...it's better than any medicine. I'm going to prescribe all my future patients sea holidays."
John couldn't help but laugh. "Well, at least she said it was okay for you to bring Angelo's in here. I've been craving some chicken parm all day."
He heard the sound of a motorcycle approaching and he knew it was Sherlock. John got up and made his way towards the front yard. He saw him get off his bike and remove his helmet. John thought nobody could be that elegant getting off a motorcycle, but Sherlock was.
Jodie returned at that pivotal moment to bring the drinks and chocolate chip bread. Sensing the two men were having an important conversation, she merely nodded and walked away.
As Greg and Sherlock were heading towards the exit, he turned to the detective. "That was unexpected, you finding a boyfriend during an A&E visit."
Sherlock shook his head. The one time he wanted to control his mouth, to try and make normal conversation, and he'd blown it.
"Yes sir," she replied, and she was off to attend to her morning duties. Mycroft was grateful Anthea had agreed to come with them to California. She was one of the most efficient housekeepers the family ever had.
Sherlock joined John and placed his head on his blogger's shoulder. "You're welcome. Oh, and I placed an order for takeaway from Angelo's. They should be delivering it within the hour."
The bartender made his way to John, who ordered two screwdrivers and a pint of Guinness. While he waited for the drinks, he heard a smooth baritone speak up.
John took a handkerchief out of his pocket and wiped Sherlock's nose clean, throwing the used fabric into the laundry hamper. "You have an infection love. Now stop arguing with me and get into bed. I'll pop down to the clinic, pick up some antibiotics, and in a few days you'll be right as rain."
Valerie nodded to the two men and left. Sherlock wrapped an arm around John and led him inside. "Come on, let's get you into your pajamas and into bed and I'll make us some tea."
"As a doctor who's seen his fair share of viruses, yellow nasal secretion is a sure sign that you've caught something more than the common cold. No, you have a viral infection. Which will clear up with antibiotics and lots of rest. Now again, stop arguing and get into bed. I know you're tired."
He turned off his laptop, closed it shut, and headed off to bed. As he wrapped his arms around Sebastian, he tenderly whispered into his ear "I've found him again Sebby, no need to worry."
Dave turned on the recorder. "This is Office Dave Morstan, Sherrinford Police Department. It's Thursday, September 21st, the time is 4:20 p.m. I am about to record a statement by Henry Knight regarding The Sherrinford Slayer. He has given us permission to record without an adult present." He looked at Henry. "Will you please state your name and age?"
John and his mother were listening as well. Wanda was shaking, and John had an arm around her. So his theory about the murders not being racially motivated was correct, but his idea that it was a random stranger who just wanted to kill was also wrong. The fact that it might be someone he knew, and this someone was trying to send a message was more frightening than a maniac passing through town.
"Hey Sophie, you think Tim will be with them?" Mary turned to her right where Sophie Hunter, a tall, beautiful slender teen with long black hair and doe eyes stood.
"You fainted Mom, after Miss Reilly said the killer mentioned my name in his call to her," Molly quietly explained.
"We've got the last audition for today Sherlock, and I hope this is the one, or we'll have to schedule another day, and it will put us behind schedule," Mycroft firmly told his brother.
Sherlock and Brett were at Baskerville Primary, looking for John and Rosie. John had told Sherlock to wait for him by the old playground the school no longer used. The two were the only ones there. Brett was on the swings. Sherlock sat down next to his son, his heart and stomach tight with anticipation waiting for the handsome doctor.
Sherlock joined John, gently placing his hands on John's shoulders, pressing a kiss to the back of his neck. "It's beautiful," he said, looking out at the snow.
John couldn't help but smile at the young girl. "Okay. I can't refuse a birthday wish like that." He stood up and smoothed down his clothes. "Lead the way to your brother."
"Yeah I do. I don't know why though." Henry laughed again, and pulled the taller boy down so he could press a kiss to his nose. "I see it's just the two of us."
"I'm so lucky to have him John. I thought I'd never find a decent guy after all the stupid shit I pulled. Let me tell you, being clean and sober really has its benefits." Harry pulled no punches when it came to talking about her past. While John and his parents were in Sherrinford, Harry had gotten involved with a group of greasers and started dabbling in marijuana and booze. When she was twenty, she nearly overdosed on cocaine at a party and was rushed to the hospital. After being released, she quit cold turkey and moved in with a friend and her family. While going through withdrawal, she met her friend's older brother, Clarence Winstead. Clarence was twenty-seven and working at his uncle's garage. The two fell in love and married that New Year's Eve. It was a quick courtship, but they were enjoying a happy marriage and a good life.
I know it's been a while! After a month of suffering a cough and respiratory infection, it's finally gone. And then I sold my house to a group of flippers that pay cash for homes! I have three weeks to pack up and relocate! So I'm looking for an apartment now. So it's been crazy. I'll update when I can. For now, enjoy this short chapter.
Sherlock looked at John like he got slapped. Gamma? He'd never heard of someone being a gamma. After being injected with the werewolf vaccine, you either presented as alpha or omega....
Rosie and Maisie were happy once again, and John was happy he was able to placate the kids. But he needed one more person to make this night extra special. So he went over to Mrs. Hudson's to explain the situation and asked if she could make some special treats for the girls since their outdoor plans got rained out.
Molly nodded. “The son’s always been interested in bondage, but wants someone who isn’t so, uh, hardcore. So I agreed to see him.”
"My standards are just fine. You're the one with the impossible taste. And the murderer did have a twisted hip in a way, with that funny walk," John playfully retorted. He burrowed down under the comforter. "Now leave me be, I want to get in a small kip before the food comes."
even bother. I'm going after him. You can stay here alone, like always." With a huff, she stormed away, not seeing the guilt and hurt in Sherlock's eyes.
"I have a young man named Sebastian Wilkes at the station who says he's got information on the sock hop murders."
"Hey now," Bill retorted, removing the alpha's arm. "He's my best friend and he's just looking out for my welfare."
"Anyway," Bill continued, "I was wondering if you wanted to go out with me tonight, have a few pints and chat, maybe do some dancing."
"Well then, I'm going to go and find him. But not today. I have an appointment with him Friday night. He answered my ad." He chuckled demonically. "He can never stay away. He's always ready to hurt others. But he's going to be the one hurting, and he'll pay, I promise you."
John chuckled. "Can't wait." Then his face turned pensive. "I told my boss today I was taking her offer to go part time. I'll only be working two days a week, Tuesday and Thursday, from nine to two. They're bringing on a new GP. He's young, single, no kids, and wants the hours. I'm happy to pull back, if that's okay with you."
John sat at the corner end of the bar, nursing a whiskey and thinking about how crappy his life currently was. It wasn't bad enough he got shot while serving his country, the injury caused a tremor which ended his surgical career and left him with a psychosomatic leg injury causing a noticeable limp and needing use of cane, no what was worse he came home to find his girlfriend Mary shacking up with his best friend and pregnant with his baby. While Mary and former friend David sheepishly looked on, John hurriedly grabbed his clothes and left. His sister Harry, thankfully now sober and happily married, wired him some money so he could stay in a hotel while waiting for his pension and his housing to come through.
John couldn't help but grin from ear to ear. He wouldn't have minded walking home in the snow with Rosie, but he was very happy to be in a warm taxi with his two loved ones. And when they got home, winter gear was exchanged for pajamas, and it wasn't long before the three were Watson-Holmes were on the couch, cuddling under a blanket, sipping hot chocolate, watching a bee documentary while the snow continued to blanket the city.
The trip to Victor's took only ten minutes and he was soon walking towards the nondescript building, basking in the early spring sunshine. He entered the studio and saw Sarah sitting at her desk rapidly typing. He approached her and she looked up at him and smiled. "Good afternoon John. Victor and Kitty are already here and waiting. Go on back."
She saw a slightly older woman with shoulder length red hair wearing a white pencil skirt, lavender short-sleeved blouse and white headband talking to a man carrying a portable tape recorder and holding a microphone to her face. Molly's interest was piqued but she chose to keep her distance.
The boys were snuggled up together in front of the fireplace, Angelo's delicious lunch of seafood fettucine alfredo and garlic bread nestled warmly in their stomachs. There was enough left over for a late dinner. John had brought the radio and big band music was playing. John laid his head on Sherlock's shoulder and Sherlock wrapped his arm around John.
Eurus had also told Jim Moriarty what happened to Sheridan, and like John, Jim wasn't mad. Sherlock was amused at the level of affection for his wayward sister, but then again, he had John, so apparently both boys were attracted to danger and unpredictability. He wondered when everybody else would find out about why they left England, and how long it would take for the rest of Sherrinford to brand them freaks and try and run them out of town. He was ready. He would just deduce the skeletons in their closets. No one was perfect.
Sherlock blushed and looked down at the frozen water, then gazed up at John sheepishly. "Yes. Mummy made Mycroft and I take them. She thought it would be a good way for us to socialize with other children," he replied, putting socialize in air quotes.
All was quiet in Sherrinford as night overtook the town. John and Sherlock were fast asleep in their beds. Wanda was in bed, but reading and listening to a beautiful music radio station. She and Hal had a great time out and planned another date for the drive-in next weekend. Gloria Wilkes was sleeping peacefully and would be discharged from the home tomorrow. The Wilkes household was silent.
"Hey!" John started to argue, but he was cut off by another kiss from Sherlock. Once the taller boy broke the kiss for some air, he smiled sadly at John. "You should probably go now."
"What dish are you planning tonight?" Sherlock asked as he reached into a drawer reserved for menus. "I thought we could do takeout for lunch at the sandwich shop in Newton."
"Well, Juliet was Romeo's sun, and you're my sun. And you are smaller and fairer than I am." Sherlock playfully mocked.
"So do you," John said, grinning back at her. Molly was a female Indiana Jones, with a fedora on her head and wearing a brown jacket, tan shirt, and brown skirt with brown lace up boots. "We saved you two seats at our table. Mary, Janine, Greg, Mike, Irene, and Kate are already there.
John squirmed to get out of his grasp. “Not here on the street where everyone can see!” Sherlock released him and grinned madly. “Let’s go inside then.”
John entered the lobby and made his way towards the elevator. Warren's flat was on the fifth floor, number 514.
Sherlock begins to stir and slowly awakens. He gazes over at Rosie and John, his heart filled with love. They are his favorite people in the world and he'd do anything for them.
Sebastian snorted. "I didn't think you'd take me seriously, being a perverted fag who's dating and living with a fifteen year-old boy after all. You'd probably think I did something to deserve it."
Wanda's face softened and she chuckled. "I told Sherlock's parents he could stay here tonight on the sofa. He's not going to be out in the dark while the killer is out there. He's probably furious that Angelo and Mrs. H. survived and is probably looking for another victim. No, he'd be much safer here."
He took Carl away, and the crowd started to disperse. John smiled at the two women. "I doubt he'll be bothering you. Well, I'd better get to home, I need to pick up my daughter from the sitter. Have a nice evening."
John opened the door and Wanda was horrified to see his normally golden skin a sickly pale color. A pained look was on his handsome face. "Oh Johnny, you look terrible."
Sherlock blushed yet again, and Brett snickered, knowing his dad was a looker and would often get people, mostly other men, flirting with him. Usually the men were gross, but Brett liked this one.
"I really enjoyed the performance," Greg said. "You were futuristic but at the same time, whimsically retro. And I see you're not averse to wearing makeup."
Sherlock picked up the plate. "Take a bite, it's delicious." John opened his mouth and Sherlock lovingly fed him the cake. "Mmm, that's wonderful," John said after he finished it. "May I have the rest of the water?"
Jeremy gave his sister another squeeze and helped her up from the ground. "Come on, let's get back on the road. The sooner you get to Harold, the better you'll feel."
If John was going to answer, he would never get the chance, for his mom suddenly appeared and jumped on Wilkes' back, pounding him everywhere she could with her fists. "You maniac! How dare you come in here and try to hurt my family! I'll kill you myself goddammit!"
Molly finally heaved a sigh of relief and smiled. "I'd like that very much. Thank you Mycroft." She leaned in and gave him a peck on the cheek. Mycroft couldn't help but blush, warmth spreading out all over his body. He finally got a kiss from her...and maybe one day it would be more than a chaste buss. He'd take what he could get for now.
It didn't take long to reach John's house. The porch lights were on, as were just about everyone's in the small neighborhood. John felt a little safer seeing everything bathed in a soft white glow.
The client, Zach Quinn, eventually collapsed in A&E, with a punctured lung, broken ribs, and a severed tendon. He recovered, but weeks later blew his brains out with a .22 caliber revolver inside his penthouse. His suffering was practically nil.
John pushed the injured robber to the ground, who looked up in him with agony. The other would-be robber looked at John with a mixture of surprise and fright. "Come on Jamie, let's go. I don't want any broken bones for Christmas." He helped his friend get to his feet and the two ran off into the night.
"You can bring a guest. Do you have anyone in mind?" Irene said, breaking into John's train of thought.
John stood up, holding out his hand to Sherlock. "Would you like to walk along the beach with me? And maybe later, I could introduce you to my sister and her girlfriend, go out for a bite to eat."
John decided to tell Greg. He could let James and Bill know to keep an eye on him, without confronting him directly.
Sherlock began to untie John's robe, until he too was all in his naked glory. He leaned in, peppering kisses all over John's neck, up and down his earlobe. "But I didn't want just any man in London, I wanted you. You're different from everyone else. I knew it as soon as I saw you at St. Bart's. You're endlessly fascinating. I'll never get tired of you."
"We're fine. We're two hours out and the snow is coming down pretty good so Sherlock and I found a bread and breakfast to stay at until the storm stops."
"Yes, but there's a chance his work life could spill into his personal one, and he'll start hurting people," Jim countered.
Sebastian ended up with severe depression, night terrors on top of his PTSD, and confined to a wheelchair for the rest of his life. His Army pension, disability check, and a near million dollar payout from the escort service ensured his financial wellbeing, but not his psychological or emotional wellbeing. Sebastian refused any affection from Jim, tried to kill himself with an overdose of pain pills, and was eventually hospitalized for a month after a nervous breakdown.
"Yeah my hot dancers, I just gave you a love hangover courtesy of Miss Diana Ross. I know you're still wanting to boogie, and my next diva is up for you. Let's see if we can try Donna Summer and make it!"
John entered the restaurant, approaching the hostess. She eyed him with a suspicious look even though he was wearing a dress shirt, tie, and navy slacks. His soon-to-be ex employer insisted his workers look professional. He ignored her expression. "Hello, I'm John Watson. I'm meeting Irene Adler and Molly Hooper."
The two stopped in front of a door marked TEACHERS LOUNGE - NO STUDENTS ALLOWED. Molly opened it, still holding onto John, who felt apprehensive and nervous. He gripped the handle of his lunch sack tight.
"Yes. I'm going to be dressed as an angel. The website has photos of the backgrounds and costumes you can choose from," Molly explained.
Doctor Jones nodded. "It's standard procedure for all suicide attempts we treat here. It's not meant to punish patients, but part of continuing care."
Soon he heard footsteps and he watched Mrs. Hooper and Molly come down the stairs. Molly looked adorable in powder blue shorts and a white sleeveless blouse, hair pulled up into a ponytail, feet bare. Her eyes widened in disbelief upon seeing Greg. “Mom says you’re here to see me?”
Sidney and Veronica Holmes sat across from Mycroft in the library, slowly taking in all he told them about Sherlock running off to Los Angeles---and that Eurus knew and didn't tell them. Needless to say, they were furious.
Ice pellets continued to rain down, gently rattling the windows. Tomorrow was going to be a slippery and slushy first day of 2021 and both John and Sherlock were grateful they did not have to leave the flat.
John was enjoying his time with Sherlock and he knew soon he'd have to catch the train back to London. He planned to ask him if they wanted to make another date before he left.
John didn't want to wake Sherlock, but his bladder was throbbing and he needed the loo, so reluctantly he eased his lanky genius off of him, and he sat up, yawning and stretching. Sherlock did awake, opening his eyes, which were now a shade of blue-grey, mirroring the sky outside. He saw John and smiled a sleepy smile, reaching for him again. "John," he breathed in his seductive low baritone.
"I'm sorry, but that was way too intense. You've got to take it slow," John rasped. "I'm not used to making out like that."
John continued to stroke Warren with the inside of the bullhorn. The soft yet brusque movements against Warren's engorged cock became more and more sensitive. Warren bore down into the mattress and raised his chin up, struggling to maintain his composure.
Jim grinned as he lovingly gazed at Sebastian, who was lying in bed, singing along to a song he was listening to on his phone. His eyes were closed, and he was moving his head back and forth. Jim couldn’t hear the song because his boyfriend had his earbuds in, but he was sure it was a Joy Division song. They were one of Sebastian’s favorite groups.
John flashed back to Harry, Clarence, and Mom talking to him about Sherlock's parents and their meeting with his mom and brother-in-law. He began to feel anxious. "I hope nothing's happened and we're not in trouble."
He succeeded, and the knife fell to the carpet with a soft thud. Harold raised up his right knee and smashed it hard against the killer's privates. The other man yelled in pain, and Harold raised his right hand, made a fist, and punched the killer right in the face. While he was stunned from the blow, Harold, in a fit of combined anger and adrenaline, tore off the killer's mask.
"It's also a perfect day to try the new fish & chips stand right across from the museum. Mike and Greg can't stop raving about that place," John added.
The man lowered his arm and glared at John with angry brown eyes. "Mind your own business mate!" he spat.
"Come back to my house. I'll grab the snacks, call my mom to let her know I'm okay, and then we're heading to Belgrave."
Sherlock cut him off by cupping his face and laying a searing kiss on his lips. John was shocked to say the least, and didn't react right away, but then gave into the kiss, wrapping his arms around Sherlock, and processing what was happening. Sherlock was kissing him, passionately. John thought Sherlock didn't feel that way about him. Maybe it was just them being away, the change of scenery. Sherlock would probably go right back into his cool indifference mode as soon as this was all over.
It wasn't long before the Holmes-Watson family were back to a peaceful slumber, now that they knew it was finally going to be a wonderful Christmas filled with love and laughter.
Soon the cookies were done and out of the oven cooling; Mrs. Hudson had poured some apple juice for the girls, and made tea for she and John. The four sipped their drinks, patiently waiting for the cookies to be cool enough to eat. Once the cookies were ready, each person took two and happily munched on the sweet treat.
Sherlock took off his coat and hung it up on the hook by the door and quietly retreated to the bedroom to slip into his comfortable pajamas and dressing gown. He saw the box wrapped in shimmery purple paper with a big silver bow in the middle, a card attached to the front. Curious, he picked it up and grinned as he read it was for him from John. He carefully tore off the card and opened it up. Inside, a handwritten message from John:
John may have been sentimental but he was also very shrewd. With Valentine's Day being a Wednesday, that meant having a smaller, less fussier ceremony that wasn't going to be an all day affair, which would mean a high probability of Sherlock getting bored by the end of it all, and John knew better than anyone putting up with a bored Sherlock was not fun to witness.
"I'll get the sponges and cleaner," Greg said, getting up. "Gordie, go upstairs and tell Amy to calm down, it'll be okay, Daddy's coming to fix her wall."
Sherlock just smiled and put his violin up to his chin, and began to play again, this time Winter Wonderland. John went into the kitchen to make hot chocolate, and reached into one of the cabinets to pull out the tin of Christmas cookies Mrs. Hudson had baked them, continuing their perfect Friday night.
John had gotten a little antsy after the phone call, so he reluctantly agreed to take the sleeping pill. Wanda promised him they would drive to the hospital to see Angelo and Mrs. Hudson. She took one herself, and before long she was sound asleep in her bed, oblivious to the storms that continued to drop unrelenting rain all around them.
John was also invited to an exclusive party, The After Dark Ball, just for those in adult entertainment. It was a splashy affair being held at The Diogenes Club on the first Saturday in April. It was a yearly event attended by strip club owners, high profile exotic dances, porn stars, models, and other doms like him. He was intrigued by the idea of attending a real adult-themed party.
John nodded and looked back at the screen, with images of happy couples surrounded by the site name. "Right then, let's do this."
Sherlock finished his cigarette and slid down to the ground, folding his long legs underneath him, his back against the wall. He closed his eyes, and soon images of a handsome blond with breathtaking blue eyes and a voice like sunshine filled his mind.
"Sorry. I guess the radio drowned out the sound of you knocking." He smiled at Sherlock, who didn't come to school today. "Feeling better?"
Mrs. Hudson had left her Baker Street boys a sizeable inheritance in her will, to which the two put half of it in a college fund for Rosie. The rest was for whatever they wished. John and Sherlock had taken a long overdue honeymoon, vacationing in Ireland and Scotland. John no longer had to work at the surgery and devoted all his time to helping Sherlock with cases and being a stay at-home dad to Rosie, now five and a bright, precocious little girl.
"Jesus," Officer Sholto cursed. Dave sadly shook his head. "Henry, I want you to be honest with me. You didn't see or hear anything up until today?"
Jim moved to stand behind Sebastian, massaging shoulders. A grimace appeared on his face, and his chocolate brown eyes darkened in quiet fury. "Well don't worry Sebby, I'm making sure there's no more pain. At least mentally and emotionally. I'm getting them and making them feel what you felt."
Another update! The goal is to reign this thing in at under 50 chapters---I'm hoping to end it at 45, but that is determined by how long I want these plotbunnies to go. There's still the whole Eurus mess to resolve, and I still don't know if Mollstrade or Mollcroft will be endgame.
John nodded. "I'm really intrigued by the entire prospect. To be honest, money is the main reason---I have a daughter to support---and although I like the people I work with now, I need something less predictable, more exciting."
The door opened, and the lady herself appeared. "Hello you two. It's been a shitty night for customers. I'm going to let you go home."
Eurus began to pick at her pink angora sweater, thinking how sweet and innocent that item of clothing appeared, when she was anything but. She took a breath and continued, trying to keep her voice calm and detached.
"You too Irene. Try not to buy out Rodeo Drive though, or Hollywood will have to resort to Woolworth's and Montgomery Ward's if they want somewhere to shop."
John’s eyes widened. “You yanking my chain? Come on, if they’re that rich and British, wouldn’t they be going to Doyle Prep?”
He propped his phone up on the counter next to the stove and glanced at the instructions while beginning to make the drink. He'd figure a mug of hot cider would be perfect on a raw, rainy autumn day, and it would be just the thing to soothe John's sore throat.
John chuckled and shook his head. "You know, you're not the first to make such keen observations about me, although the former experience wasn't as pleasant."
Mycroft couldn't take this conversation anymore. "I'm going to the ballroom. You do whatever the hell you want. I'm done tonight."
A bitter laugh ripped through the crowd. Sherlock stepped up, hands on his hips. “Oh come on Mycroft, don’t believe a word of that tripe. Who would be interested in her besides you?”
"She is. I'll be here first thing in the morning to pick her up. Goodnight Mrs. Doyle. Goodnight baby girl. I love you." John placed a soft kiss to Evie's rosy cheek, and she giggled happily. "Night-night Daddy," she said.
John sensed his spouse's impatience and it was his turn to smile deviously. He loved teasing Sherlock so, but decided to have pity on him. He pointed to the red heart. "I choose that one."
Jim though, had things to do. He lay on the sofa, laptop resting on his thighs, checking his Craigslist messages. He'd gotten many responses for his request for anonymous hookups in London, but he was searching for a certain customer.
The mood inside Molly Hooper's mom's station wagon was a little tense as Molly, John, Mary, Mike, along with Ella Parsons, were on their way to Gatiss General to see Mrs. Hudson and Angelo. Ella had agreed to drive everyone, and Molly's parents let them use their car so everyone could go together.
Harold lashed out with the letter opener, slashing the killer's left sleeve. "Get out!" he roared at him.
He was undeterred. There was something enticing about this girl. “Perhaps we can go back to my house and you can call your mother from there. I could play the piano for you while you wait.”
“Be a little more friendly pretty boy,” the man beckoned, now off the bench and walking towards the bars of his cell. “I don’t bite...hard.”
Molly pursed her lips in thought for a few seconds, and then her eyes widened. “Oh God, not Leland “Limp Balls” Lomax. I thought we got rid of him!”
I saw Doctor Watson slightly blush. Oh yeah, there was a spark igniting between these two idiots. I felt like I was watching one of those sappy romantic comedies my ex-wife used to drag me to.
John glanced down at his outfit and a blush spread on his face. "No, I'm not on the pull. My sister and her girlfriend wanted to come and like your friend they insisted I come too. I didn't have a costume so I raided my friend's stash. This was the only one that fit me."
"Well that's certainly true. And she's been on a few dates with Mike's new assistant so maybe things are looking up for her like they are for us."
"Come on honey, we have a lot more trick-or-treating to do." John took Rosie's hand and they began to walk. "This is some to do yeah?" he commented to Mike.
Suddenly he smacked his forehead. "Oh shit, I need to get back to the booth, that last song is probably done and everyone sure's to wonder what's going on!"
His thoughts were interrupted by the sound of a woman’s voice. “That was lovely dear, you’ve improved so much since last month. Now run along, I know you’re looking forward to tonight. I’ll see you again next Saturday.”
"What I don't understand, is how Jeff ended up at the Wilkes home and now he's fighting for his life," Lucy said sadly.
"Okay." Dave brought the tape recorder to his mouth. "Officer Dave Morstan, Sherrinford Police Department. This concludes our interview with Henry Knight regarding The Sherrinford Slayer murders. Thursday, September 21st, 4:37 p.m."
Mycroft kept silent although he so wanted to tell his mother she should have never indulged his sister. If she had reigned her in earlier and actually showed concern at her actions, they would still be in London and not escaped to here.
John had called the office and spoke with Irene, reassuring her he was fine, and he would come in after his two o'clock to check in and do some paperwork before his he ended his work day. He also got a call from Victor, who told him he was not able to make lunch. One of his clients, a very wealthy socialite, had called and demanded him to do a last minute photoshoot. Her daughter was engaged to be married and needed engagement pictures for the newspapers and society websites. Victor was also being highly paid for this job, and he wasn't about to turn the money down. John readily understood, and the two rescheduled for tomorrow afternoon.
Harold loved rainy nights, they were relaxing and it helped him take his mind off school matters. Never before had things been so stressful. Trying to keep the peace and keep students focused on their education while a murderer was loose, killing their friends and threatening their livelihood was taxing. He like everyone else in Sherrinford was praying the police would catch the maniac soon.
A rumble of thunder boomed outside, and soon rain was pelting on the windows. "It's going to be storming all afternoon and into this evening, perfect time to be in bed resting," Sherlock said.
"Brett!" Sherlock admonished, but John just laughed. "It's okay. I'm used to little ones saying what's on their minds." He affectionately glanced down at Rosie, who was looking intently at Sherlock and Brett.
The teens found seats in the front row. Sherlock frowned, he would rather be in the back but he knew the two wanted to be as close up as possible, so he said nothing and sat next to Eurus. He crossed his legs and held onto his book.
John actually arrived back at six twenty-nine. "Hi love! Want me to call Angelo's and place our order for the usual?" he asked as he entered the living room.
"Oh yes, I remember. You're angry with the residents. Someone's hurt you." Kitty fought to keep her voice calm.
Sherlock nodded. "I'll be here." He watched John leave, obviously not trying to stare at his pert behind.
Yvonne made a tsk sound. "That can be arranged. I have a cancellation and we can fit you in. The session is already paid for."
"Uh, we have an appointment at ten, John Watson and Warren Raymond," John answered, a little sheepishly. He was still slightly embarrassed at being in a spa.
Sherlock smiled. "It's more than okay. After I left the store I couldn't get you out of my head. I felt guilty, but after catching Victor, the guilt was gone."
John, Victor, and the gang were back at their table. "I can't believe those idiots. You'd think their parents would be punishing them for getting suspended and not allowing them to go out," Victor said, shaking his head.
Wanda Watson smiled at the three boys. “Mrs. Hudson called. She put aside some food for us so I’m going down to pick it up. Do you need anything while I’m out?”
"Hey Dave. Looks to be a case of attempted murder. The neighbor who called this in said he heard a gunshot and ran over here. The door was closed but unlocked. He went into the living room and saw Hope lying on the floor, conscious, face down. He managed to tell him that Richard Wilkes shot him in the back after they argued."
Sherlock looked at the clock on the wall above the fireplace. It was six twenty-eight. John would be home in two minutes. Warmth spread throughout his body at the anticipation of the night ahead with his gorgeous omega.
Sherlock stood behind John, long arms wrapped around the shorter man's chest, smiling down at the lovebites covering his sides of his neck. Sherlock was proud he put those marks of possession on John. It was to show everyone that brave soldier was his, and his alone. Nobody could ever know the depth of love he had for his conductor of light. Nobody except John.
"Okay then, how come you're still here and not leaving, if you don't want to do this?" Marty challenged Sebastian.
"As soon as Harold is released, the two of you are coming to stay with Elaine and I. Harold will just have to take a leave of absence. The school should understand. It's for his safety, and yours, if he really was running away from the killer and he saw him."
He decided to walk, it was just ten minutes away and he could use the fresh air. The street was somewhat crowded with people on their way to their Friday night activities. Another Halloween had come and gone and now the Christmas rush was on. Some of the shop windows already had Christmas decorations displayed.
John lovingly watched his ridiculous genius get up and walk to the kitchen. He couldn't think of a better person to spend snowed in with.
John sighed. "His parents are very wealthy. You know how it is with money and the law. When you're rich, you get off. Not only that, I didn't want to sit through a court trial and have my bisexuality come up, as well as the incident with Sebastian last Christmas. Lawyers would say it was my fault because this is the second time I've been attacked. Third actually, if you count that kid in our old neighborhood five years ago. I seem to be this psycho magnet, and I hate it."
"Then we couldn't be together. It's important for the little ones to be in harmony with us and each other," John finished.
The doors to the shop opened and there were loud cheers and clapping. There were two store employees at the front to make sure everyone would enter peacefully. Mike Stamford, a chubby, pleasant looking fellow wearing glasses and sporting a receding hairline, appeared.
John had brought the awning out and the two sat under it, talking, laughing and drinking tea, enjoying the solitude, the only sounds being them, and the birds singing in the trees.
John, however, turned out to be a mix of both. Biologically he was an omega but his bloodstream carried alpha genes. The doctors and scientists were dumbfounded and kept John in the hospital for weeks, running all kinds of tests on him to determine what caused it and finally they discovered that John's testosterone levels were slightly higher than any of the already presented male omegas. This also explained why he had the strength of an alpha and was able to fight off the orderly as he did. One of the doctors, Mike Stamford, came up with a new term for John's uniqueness: gamma. He took it from
"When I was in hospital recovering, there was a small library where we could go and read, have some quiet time to ourselves. There were a lot of horror novels on the shelves and I gravitated to them. After reading them, I decided to try my hand at writing horror stories. I dabbled in writing during my teenage years. The doctors gave me a typewriter and paper. It was slow-going due to my shoulder injury, but it turned out to be good physical therapy, as well as emotional and mental therapy.  My first novel,
