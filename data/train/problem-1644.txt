John takes a deep breath and lets it out again. "I'd really, really like it you'd tell me what it is. I want to do something, Sherlock. Tris is-" John falls silent. "I miss him, too," he says, more quietly. His thumb rubs gentle circles on Sherlock's shoulder.
"Don't patronise me! This isn't about-" John presses his hand to his forehead. "Can we just- can we walk, or something? They might be watching us from the window."
He'd quickly learned how to tell who had stashes of illicit substances, which staff members were carrying on affairs, and how to use that information to get things he wanted. A cleaner from the Ukraine who was in the country illegally yielded a mobile phone. A psychiatrist who was using his office computer to view porn got him out of biweekly group therapy sessions. And deducing the identity of the patient who'd orchestrated the break-in to the dispensary earned him the privilege of a room to himself. So, all in all, the time hadn't been entirely wasted.
Sherlock was so pleased at having made John laugh that he told the class they were having a talent showcase.
killer." The name comes out of his mouth oddly, an incongruity, as if he'd started talking in thees and thous. He then resumes his enumeration: "Discovering the reason for the methylfentanyl device. And making sure that neither my son nor your - Emily," he corrects himself before John can open his mouth, the name again sounding as if it's a word in an unfamiliar language, "is threatened with harm again."
Did Sherlock see all of Mary's secrets that first night he met her? Or at any point in the ensuing months leading up to the wedding? It seems impossible that he wouldn't have at least suspected something. John's never asked him. He's not sure he wants to know the answer. But now that John's marriage—his life, really—has completely fallen apart, he wants Sherlock to take some of the blame.
"And?" John hovers in the bathroom doorway again, having heard Sherlock returning over an hour later. He squints as his eyes adjust to the light.
"This came today." He hands John a scrap of paper. "One of my contacts passed it to Mrs Hudson when she was out at the shops, and she gave it to Emily. I don't know why she couldn't bring it to me herself," he gripes.
John glares at Sherlock but takes the phone. "Yeah, I'm... Yeah, sorry, still here. Just dropped the phone," he tells Irene. As she speaks, he closes his eyes and looks decidedly unhappy. "Yeah. Yes," he finally says. "I'm on my way." He ends the call and promptly tells Sherlock, "You're not going."
"Are you okay?" he whispers. Maybe she's sick.
Holmes' accursed lips quirked ever so slightly with smug suffisance as he registered my uncontrolled reaction.
John's fists clench at his sides. "God, I still can't believe it. Her own sister, and then dragging kids into it. How-" His expression turns hard. "How could someone have so much hatred in them? Even in Afghanistan, the people there were fighting for an ideology. It was never so personal."
Emily is very quiet too. Tristram's not sure if she hasn't perhaps fallen asleep, until he hears her sniffle.
Sherlock drew himself up. "I should hope I would muster a bit more enthusiasm for a ghost."
One more area in which John Watson was turning Sherlock's long-held convictions inside-out.
Mycroft appraised him coolly. "Very well," he finally acquiesced. "I shall let the nurses' station know you're staying."
Tristram doesn't have a problem with breaking rules if his father tells him it's okay. He knows that some rules are stupid and sometimes it's better to do what you know to be right, no matter what someone else says, even if that someone else is an adult. One time, Inspector Lestrade stood in their living room and yelled at his father that he was already breaking every (and here he said a bad word) rule in the book to get him some information or other, so he'd (another bad word) well better cooperate.
"We were playing Emergency."
Doctor Watson smiles. It's a small smile, but the corners of his eyes crinkle and his face looks like the sun. He steps away from Father and turns to Tristram. He keeps smiling, but something seems to fall away from it. It's still a nice smile, however, and it makes Tristram feel good.
Sherlock is silent as the miles tick by beneath them.
Irene goes into the bedroom and closes the door all the way, which is odd. Why doesn't she want Tristram and Emily to hear her calling John, if all she's going to do is ask how much longer they'll be?
Sherlock squeezed the bottle until John's fingers were coated and dripping. He may have overdone it a bit in his enthusiasm.
The question remained, of course, what they were going to do with the video now. Molly and John were emphatic about sending it to Mycroft at Whitehall, and although Sherlock assured them once again of the futility of the effort, he really couldn't stop them from popping the DVD into a bubble-cushioned cardboard sleeve and writing the studio address on it.
Sherlock climbed onto his desk and retrieved some notes from his hiding place, then jumped down. "Give me ten," he said, proffering the money.
John grunts a little, acknowledging he's heard.
The EHIC card is the European Health Insurance Card. It allows anyone covered by the NHS to receive medical care in any country belonging to the European Economic Area. Basically, someone from the UK would need it if they're travelling to Switzerland because Switzerland isn't in the EU.
Father stirs, gently nudging Tristram back upright. "I think you can go back to bed now," he says. "Nothing's going to happen tonight." He steps away from the window and lets the curtain fall back over the window. Then he turns his phone on again and directs the blue glow at the floor so Tristram can get to the bed without running into anything.
Her aunt keeps checking her watch. Her forehead and the corners of her mouth are pulling lower and lower.
"Maybe it's time they did again."
"...are perfectly safe. I can see them." Sherlock sounds impatient; irritated.
John nods slowly, apparently taking a moment to digest that. "Okay. Your mother again?"
(See the end of the chapter for
Eventually, Emily and Doctor Watson come back from the kitchen. Emily goes upstairs to get dressed and brush her teeth, and Doctor Watson makes Tristram get up to use the loo. When he's done, Doctor Watson has him take his shirt off so he can check the bandages, which he had to redo when they got back last night. Tristram tore several of them off during his tantrum at the airport, and re-opened a couple of the deeper cuts. Luckily, there were enough medical supplies in the house that they didn't have to go to the hospital again. The cast seems to have protected Tristram's hand well enough. Tristram is embarrassed now about losing control so thoroughly, but he couldn't help it. He still feels the echo of that panic and helpless fear when he thinks about it now, so he focuses on counting the tiles on the floor instead while Doctor Watson applies fresh gauze and tape. He gets to sixty-three by the time he's done.
Sherlock's heart was racing now. John was all but challenging him to... what, to kill him? Or to kiss him? "We still haven't come to what you think I did with the body," Sherlock said, pleased that his voice came out so smooth. "But go on. What else?" He leaned against the inside of the door frame, mirroring John's earlier pose.
Father stops in the middle of the room. "You can't think I'm going to leave you here. There's no reason for you to stay any longer, anyway. You can continue healing at home as well as here, and there's no sense you expiring of boredom in the meantime."
Sherlock gives him a look.
"I've been on my own for so long," Father says quietly, almost as if he's speaking to himself. "My whole life, really."
This is set several hours after the end of chapter 23 and was inspired by prompts from getoffmysheet, a-cumberbatch-of-cookies, rifleman_s on LJ, and sabrinaphynn on LJ, who all wanted something about Sherlock and John missing (or arriving late to) Christmas dinner.
He interrupted his own train of thought as the realisation came to him of just what John was doing. He wasn't really talking about the children. As he had done in the van the other day, he was trying to put Sherlock at ease, make him laugh. He'd picked up on Sherlock's agitation. This was one of those 'what friends do' sort of situations. He was recalling a shared experience, one that he had enjoyed. True, it had only happened that morning, but they didn't have a large repertoire of common memories to draw on. So when John elbowed him lightly, seeking confirmation that Sherlock was paying attention, Sherlock smiled back and agreed that T.J. hadn't been completely pants at dancing, and bumped his knee against John's. That was rewarded with John trying to hide his smile in a spoonful of soup.
Sherlock watched him go, walk out of the kitchen into the hall. Heard him take his jacket down from the hook, jangle his keys to make sure they were in his pocket, then quickly go down the stairs and out the door.
Sherlock nodded, feeling wrong-footed (likely lost someone in a vehicular incident, why hadn't he figured that out earlier?). "Right, well. Good night, then." He wasn't sure what the protocol was at this point. Did one still shake hands with one's potential almost-lover? He took his hand out of his coat pocket to offer it anyway, but John bypassed it and put his hand on Sherlock's shoulder, leaned up and kissed him briefly on the mouth before echoing, "Good night, Sherlock."
Thank you to ruth0007 for beta reading.
That narrows it down somewhat. Of course, 'emergency' is rather broad. It could be a twenty-pound note to get a cab home in case they get lost, or a Swiss army knife, which could be useful in any number of situations, or even some of those charcoal pills to take in case of poisoning.
Sherlock sighed and pointed. "Here: Zach, Matt, and Ollie."
"About the same as vermouth." He put his glass down next to John's.
"Yes, I imagine having one's child die would do that to you," Sherlock says archly.
"Not that," John insisted, still keeping his voice low. "Although thanks. But if I've understood correctly, your father thinks we'll be sharing a bed tonight. Here." He pointed at the bed behind him.
Thanks to the indefatigable ruth0007 for beta reading this!
Just as they get to the bottom of the stairs, Mrs Hudson pops out, still in her dressing gown, and says good morning. She pretends she happens to be checking if the newspaper is there yet, but Tristram can see that her fingers are already smudged with newsprint from licking them to turn the pages.
Doctor Watson looks pleased and sends Emily off to get dressed again in warm layers. Father says they won't be leaving until later, so Tristram sits on the pull-out bed and watches Emily run back and forth. Tristram wonders if the woman from breakfast has something to do with a case. She must do. If she really was an old friend of Father's, that friendship no longer seems to be extant. At least, Father certainly didn't seem very enthusiastic about meeting with her, based on the brief snippets of the conversation he and Doctor Watson had before they sent Emily and Tristram to the bedroom. On the other hand, if she's a witness - or even a suspect - in a case, Father would be a lot more eager to meet with her. So Tristram is kind of stumped.
Sherlock stopped when they reached the shop. "I... could get some beer. I don't really have anything else..." Unspoken assumption: John would be coming to his house, actually go inside with him, stay long enough for a drink at least.
1/2 cup sweet peas (frozen are fine)
are his father. Not Mycroft."
John returns his gaze to Tristram. The boy is lying on his stomach, his head turned away, but his breathing is slow and even.
"I haven't explained the mechanics of lesbian sex to him, if that's what you're getting at," Sherlock snipes.
"I've called my dad at work lots of times. He doesn't mind."
"That was brilliant," John said quietly, as if afraid to disturb the mood. "You should play. You know, just you. Forget the kids."
Doctor Watson has come up with an undershirt from somewhere and is trying madly to get it on, which is only resulting in it getting twisted around the wrong way. "It's all right, Tris. We were just tired, and..."
As soon as he started moving it, though, Sherlock lifted his arse, vainly rutting into the air. His testicles bulged out tight and red and full underneath the cock ring firmly nestled at the base. The nipple clamp chain pulled taut, and this time Sherlock kept at it, moving his hips up and down to stretch his nipples on purpose. More precome welled up out of the slit of his cock.
"You're not leaving." Sherlock scoots forward and pushes the covers off himself. It's not quite a question, but not quite an order either.
John sits up a bit straighter. "What does that mean?"
"Yes, I'm ah..." John chanced a look at Sherlock, but Sherlock frowned and gave his head a tiny negative shake. That was Mycroft's little dig, telling Sherlock he knew what was going on and being disapproving at the same time. Sherlock looked around furiously for something to shoot back with, but Mycroft was good at hiding things and it had been too long since they'd seen each other. Oh, Sherlock could read lots of things in his clothing, the arrangement of his desk, the art on the walls, but it was harder to tell which of those things Mycroft didn't want him to see, and which he hoped he would.
"It'll be late for the little one," Bill pointed out.
"I can't promise he'll want to," Father hedges.
Their voices have returned to a more normal volume now, although Tristram can still hear the two-toned conversation continuing. As the minutes tick by without any further outbursts, Tristram starts to relax. It's nice, knowing that Father will be here when he wakes. That Father will be here all night, in fact, just in the next room with John. And it's also nice, Tristram thinks with his last bit of consciousness, that John is here too.
Sherlock's stomach did a funny and completely unnecessary twisting thing. He turned to look at John, but he was picking up a couple of stray aeroplanes that no one had claimed. He hadn't sounded sarcastic.
"They'll be perfectly safe here."
"Anyone could have got hold of his phone," Irene says scornfully and gives the phone back to John.
"This one?" Doctor Watson says, nodding at the arm nearest him, which is the right one. Tristram makes an affirmative sound in his throat because nodding will hurt. "Yeah, I see it. It's your hand, actually, and I'll take care of it in just a sec, but I really need to have a look at your front."
Then he goes to the bathroom, and everything falls silent.
"I think at least one of us should go with them." Doctor Watson leans toward Tristram's father as he speaks, and the way he raises his eyebrows says that there's another meaning behind his words.
"Wouldn't dream of it. Three o'clock?"
Emily giggles.
"This is going to be chilly at first, sorry." Which made it sound like a prostate exam, and John was right: it was cold but his finger went in smoothly.
Moriarty, on the other hand, looks delighted. He lifts his hands slowly away from the keyboard. "Oh, that's very good," he says with genuine admiration. "Truly. I'm surprised, I admit it. Look, goosebumps!" he exclaims gleefully, holding up his arm. "You see, Sherlock, never a dull moment. Who frisked you coming in, by the way?" he asks Irene. "It looks like he might be in for a bit of discipline."
Sherlock took another drag on his cigarette, squinting his eyes against the smoke, and read it through again. John was obviously trying to tell him something, but he shouldn't jump to conclusions. Especially as the last thing John had said was to bin it. He hadn't demanded it back, though. Sherlock returned the paper to his pocket. If John meant to show up tomorrow, then so did Sherlock, and he wasn't going to sit idle in the meantime.
All right. That was a good start. Early days yet, though, early days. Maybe he wanted to be fresh and alert before broaching what was certain to be a sticky subject.
Nothing. Sherlock relaxed fractionally. John mentioned needing milk. He was neither avoiding Sherlock's eyes nor seeking them out. Sherlock relaxed a bit more. When he was finished, John thanked Sherlock for the breakfast and began clearing his dishes, taking Sherlock's at the same time. His arm brushed Sherlock's as he reached across to take his cup. No reaction. No flinch, no checking to see if it was welcome, nothing.
Several minutes later, John hadn't responded yet. Sherlock turned Gladstone around to head home. He might not have seen the text, of course. He could be someplace loud and not have heard the message alert. Or he might be sleeping. He probably catnapped during the day to make up for his disturbed nocturnal sleep patterns. Or - the highest probability, given the speed with which he had replied to previous text messages - he could have decided not to subject himself to Sherlock's temper again.
"Waiting," Father replies, succinctly, without looking up.
"Do you have a sword in your umbrella?" Emily asks.
"The machine guns in the headlights. Don't you have any?"
Sherlock opens his eyes and frowns as if he can't fathom why John would ask. "Fine."
Moriarty closed his eyes and shook his head, an exaggeratedly pained expression on his face. "Manners. Is it so difficult to MIND YOUR MANNERS!" he screamed, popping his eyes open as wide as they would go.
Chop lemon grass and shallot finely. Crush the garlic and chop finely.
"Because Sherlock is an incorrigible show-off," Doctor Watson says with a broad smile. At Father's scowl, Doctor Watson raises his hands. "Not that I'm complaining. I think it's -" He clears his throat and his tongue flicks over his bottom lip. "I appreciate your talent at languages," he tells Father diplomatically, still grinning.
"The toenails proved it," Sherlock said, aiming for regretful.
He was no ordinary man, and the ordinary cares of an ordinary life were never enough to hold his interest. He needed master minds, criminal geniuses, and archnemeses to match wits with and stimulate his massive intellect. It only stood to reason that he would need extraordinary measures to stimulate his body as well. The cocaine and morphine were surely one attempt to do just that, to get his heart racing and his blood pumping the way mine - and, I believed, his - had tonight. "The games", as Miss Winter called them, could be another. And it turned out we both responded favorably to them, or at least to some of the practices. We could try other ones. Now that I had an idea of it all, I wanted to give him the chance to be on the receiving end, if he was still interested. I wanted to do all of that for him, and more.
Sherlock fell back into his body. His mouth was full of something prickly and earthy-bitter. He swallowed it. Unpleasant. John was walking away, going into the living room. Sherlock followed.
Watson frowned.
"You're not being let go," Lestrade said with a weary sigh. "God knows why, but the board have let you off with a warning. But this is it." He underscored his point by poking a finger in Sherlock's direction. "I heard the Wilkeses had to be talked down from involving their solicitor."
"Take one, it's make you feel better." She holds the bowl out to Tristram. He knows better than to take candy from strangers, even if he doesn't think she's part of any case his father might be working on. You never know, though. When he doesn't immediately respond, she shakes the bowl a little to encourage him. "It's Traubenzucker." She looks to John and Irene, but they are unable to help with the word. "It's sweet," she tries, smiling.
"Splendid," he said nevertheless. "In an hour then? We can take a cab and head up toward Hampstead Heath."
"Which is why you're not paying."
The downward creases have returned to John's face. He shifts uncomfortably on his seat. "She tell you that?"
He waited in his room until he heard John lumbering slowly up the stairs what must have been a couple of hours later - had he just sat there in his chair, gaping the entire time? Fallen asleep? - before emerging himself and carefully cleaned up any evidence of what had transpired. He washed and put away the water glass and fluffed up the pillow on John's chair - just remembering John sitting there staring up at him, the look on his face in the split second between the end of Sherlock's sentence and the kiss, made Sherlock's stomach twist in a deliciously uncomfortable way. For good measure, he tidied the sitting room a bit, not wanting to trigger John's memory in any way should his eye light on a magazine or stray teacup that he may have happened to be looking at when Sherlock said what he said - God, why had he said that of all things! Although, granted, it was hardly going to be the kind of thing John would forget, so as experimental measures went, it was excellent.
"How about you call it a 'talent showcase'?" John suggested. "They can each do whatever they think they're best at - singing, dancing, juggling, magic tricks."
I mulled this over as we began our circuit, ostensibly on the lookout for a role to emulate, but I was barely aware of the intimate scenes which played out before us. The only thought in my mind was how to get away from this place without having to inflict pain on my beloved friend. It was true that the acts we had witnessed here so far seemed designed not to cause any permanent damage, and that Holmes had been subjected to worse in his life. I knew he spoke the truth when he said he would not be bothered by a few slaps. Still, I could not see my way clear to raise a hand against him, much less a weapon. Yet I knew he would insist, not only in order to be granted access to Kitty Winter but because he would not want to back down from the challenge and lose face with Johnson.
His face puckers up in confusion. "Why would they be kissing? They're just getting dinner ready." And anyway, his father never kisses anyone. Other than, sometimes, exceptionally, Tristram, like he did on Friday Afternoon after they got out of the building with the chair and the bomb, or one time when Father was in hospital after getting shot chasing a bad guy, and Tristram was crying so hard. But Tristram had been little then, maybe five. He wouldn't cry like that today, and getting kidnapped and tied to a chair with a bomb was also an exceptional experience (he hopes, at any rate). So, no, in Tristram's estimation, there would be no reason for his father to kiss anyone, much less Doctor Watson.
"Dull," Sherlock said dismissively and flopped down on the bed behind John. He plucked at the waistband of John's underwear. "You've still got your pants on."
Sherlock couldn't help a rather large smile expanding across his face as well.
On the other hand, the fact remains that his father has sectioned off yet another part of his life that Tristram isn't invited to join in on. His work takes up so much of his time already that Tristram barely sees him. Or when he does see him, he's so occupied mentally that he isn't approachable anyway. And Tristram is pretty sure that the additional time allotted to spending with Doctor Watson isn't going to come out of his father's working hours. He feels bleak. And the mice seem to have eaten their fill, or else are too distrustful, since they retreat to the shadowy edges of the enclosure and fall silent.
Doctor Watson chuckles. "I think you can pull yours a little while longer."
John takes a breath as if to speak, but then doesn't. The only sounds are Sherlock's intermittent, unsteady breaths, and traffic passing by out in the street. John clenches his hand in the sheet but other than that remains still as well.
"Yes...?"
John freezes, halfway off the mattress. Sherlock is still looking at the pen, rolling it back and forth on the desk with his long fingers. John drops back down onto the bed, but leans forward to rest his elbows on his knees. He presses his palms together in front of his mouth and watches Sherlock. After a while, when nothing further is forthcoming, he drops his hands between his knees and hangs his head.
Tristram is still grappling with 'she wants to meet you'. Still processing that that means his mother is a real, three-dimensional person who exists outside of the dark, hunched-over figure labelled 'mother' winking out of the spotlight. But now he has an actual face and body to map onto that image: the woman in the beige-coloured dress. The one Doctor Watson grabbed and dragged away from their table. The one who stared and stared at Tristram.
"No."
"I just wanted one of us together," Emily's father murmurs. "Just as a lark, I didn't-"
&&&&&&
Sherlock called sharply to Gladstone and strode purposefully with him out of the park. He needed to gather more data.
John responded with a sympathetic hum and moved one of his hands down to fondle Sherlock's testicles, encircle the lower half of his penis, stroke his perineum, anything to give him more stimulation. It was good, but Sherlock needed just a bit more. If his arse hadn't been so sensitive at the moment, he might have asked for John's fingers, which Sherlock had in fond memory from the last time.
"I thought-" He cleared his throat. "I thought we weren't going to teach them a new song," he said, his voice low. Sherlock had to lean in a bit (to hear him better, that was all).
The animal room mostly contains taxidermied specimens of small mammals and reptiles. Tristram thinks, the next time he gets offered an animal corpse larger than a mouse from Father's friend at the zoo, he might like to try his hand at taxidermy. Father has a book on embalming that he used for a case once that probably has some useful tips. The museum also has a display case with insects and arthropods stuck on pins that gives Tristram an idea for another project. He's particularly surprised to see that scorpions are amongst the local fauna. He's always associated scorpions with hot, dry places.
This time Mary's holding her. She's pulled back the blanket and picked up one of Gloria's hands. The tiny, stubby fingers are purple.
Tristram keeps his head down, grateful for once for the unruly curls that fall into his eyes. His body is positioned parallel to the shore, but he has a perfectly good view of his father and Doctor Watson from the corner of his eye, through his hair. There is no mistaking what they are doing. Tristram has gone absolutely numb. He cannot think. He cannot even say anything to Emily, who has her back to them and is completely engrossed in the little air holes winking open and closed in the wet sand. He doesn't want her to know, suddenly, even though she's the one who always said they were kissing, before.
Sherlock stands there for a few more seconds, then lowers himself to the chair John was sitting in before. He takes out his phone and taps out a message. Once he's sent it, he says quietly, "I know you're awake."
Sherlock would like very much, at this point, to drag John back to his room — the caveman imagery, incidentally, not being lost on him — and take his time unpeeling, unveiling, undoing, unraveling... and maybe, finally, understanding.
"That's no excuse. Fraud, kidnapping, possibly embezzlement- I don't even want to know what he was doing in my bank account."
Tristram does remember: Father is going to find whoever hurt Tristram, and make them pay, and Tristram is going to get better. He looks up. Father is watching him, hard, like he's making sure that Tristram knows he's serious.
"John? John Watson?"
The next morning, Sherlock put on the dark green shirt and took extra care shaving. He packed the video camera he'd bought for a time-lapse study of the spread of damp. And when he stopped at Speedy's for his morning coffee, he bought an extra cup - black, no sugar. An educated guess, but he'd be sure to get it right next time. He'd left fifteen minutes earlier than usual so that he could catch John before he made himself any of the instant stuff at the school.
"He hasn't trained me," John said, low and dark.
"Mummy used to have me play all the traditional ones at her Christmas parties. Silent Night, Good King Wenceslas. Whatever you want."
"Come on then, you two," a voice says from the living room. Tristram didn't even realise that Emily's Aunt Clara was standing there. By the time he looks back where his father was standing, the door is clicking shut.
"Can you start at chapter three? Tris actually started reading it to me yesterday," Emily confides in a guilty whisper.
In my previously published account, I placed our appointment with Shinwell Johnson at Holmes' residence. In fact, we were to meet him - being one of Holmes' most valuable contacts amongst the less savory elements of the city - at a notorious club Johnson frequented. It will become clear why it was necessary to obfuscate on this point shortly.
John's thighs soon clenched with the effort not to rut, blood surging and urging him forward. He was almost at the point where he was going to have to either pull away or make sure Sherlock really wanted to take this to its logical conclusion. He rolled onto his back, dragging Sherlock with him. Ceding control, letting him set the pace.
"And it's..." Doctor Watson frowns, like he's trying to figure out how to say something. Then his face straightens out and he sighs. "Right, okay. We can..." He holds out his hand, asking for permission. "May I?"
The walk, as always, did Sherlock good. There was something about the physical action of moving swiftly through the streets that steered his thoughts into orderly paths. It also helped not to have John so distractingly close by. On the one hand, Sherlock was irritated that he was falling prey to so many utterly predictable behaviours around John: the desire to impress, becoming alternately overly talkative and tongue-tied, not to mention the mortifying physical signals such as an inability to maintain steady eye contact, a near constant desire to smile, elevated heart rate and respiration and, yes, diversion of blood flow to the genitals. On the other hand, he had to admit that the experience was generally pleasurable. Simply thinking about it resulted in a rewarding bloom of pleasure hormones.
This was stupid. Pointless. It was just going to end in another row. Angry at himself for having given in to his impulsiveness yet again, Sherlock tugged on Gladstone's lead to go back downstairs when the door opened.
1 teaspoon dried paprika
She looks so hopeful, and she has been very helpful and nice. Tristram doesn't want to be outright rude or hurt her feelings, so he takes a purple one and says, "Thank you." He has no intention of actually eating it, of course. He'll give it to his father so he can analyse it. Although that will probably have to wait until they get back home. He puts it into his pocket, hoping the woman doesn't expect him to unwrap it and eat it right away.
The aisle is free now, but Doctor Watson has to finish his text and send it before he can put his phone away and start getting down their bags from the overhead compartment. Father stands up, watching his screen. When the message arrives, he reads it and then slips his phone into his pocket.
50g golden caster sugar
John stared into his tea. "I don't see how this can get better."
John accepted the accolades with a big grin and high fives from the children before they scrambled around, retrieving their aeroplanes just as the bell rang for lunch. John turned to Sherlock. "What do I win?" he teased.
John put the hand that wasn't holding the knife over Sherlock's. "No," he said gently, squeezing Sherlock's hand. "No, Sherlock, I love it. I do, really. It's..." He tried to find the words to express what he wanted to say. He wanted to say he didn't need any gift other than Sherlock. He wanted to let him know that every day, every moment with him was a treasure beyond reckoning. He wanted to tell him that he could never expect to return even a fraction of all that Sherlock had given him already. But words like that were hard to say, so he settled for, "I didn't expect to ever own anything so fine, that's all. Thank you." John leaned over and kissed Sherlock gently on the cheek.
"Quiet. Quiet!" Sherlock shouted as he entered. "Everyone sit down!"
Sherlock was quietly aware of John slipping in and out during the morning lesson, always taking two of the children with him. So he was carrying on with those ridiculous auditions for Joseph and Mary. Sherlock was well shot of the whole thing. He'd only started it because Lestrade had forced him to. They didn't actually need Sherlock at this point.
I'm happy to announce that dioscureantwins has joined the beta-reading team, together with ruth0007, providing you, the reader, with a smooth ride and even fewer typos. A big thank you to both of them!
John shakes his head, a jerky motion. "I keep thinking I should have made them try harder, keep her on the vent longer. What if the surgeons had given up on you five minutes earlier?"
"Not as far as I know anyway," he continued. "I think Harry and I would have been informed, still next of kin."
Father lowers his phone and turns to Tristram. "At the flat," he clarifies. "You saw something that made you move away from the wall."
Tristram's mind is completely blank. Why did he even come in here?
"Are you alone?"
"He needs you, Sherlock."
"Mm, interesting case, actually." Father crams the toast into his mouth, takes another, and goes to the desk in the living room.
"He doesn't have anything on here," Sherlock says. "Do you really think he'd be stupid enough to store all his blackmail material on a physical drive? One spilled cup of coffee and his entire empire collapses. No, it's in the cloud."
It's bad enough the way Sherlock goes white around the mouth and stonewalls whenever John mentions checking his wound. Insists. Harangues. And Sherlock still refuses to let him see it, two weeks on. John's supposed to be the goddamned medical professional and he hasn't been able to check for infection or that the site's closing up properly. If it were any other patient...
He nodded, but couldn't help frowning slightly. "I wouldn't do anything I didn't want to, John."
Well, at least he knew John was here. That was a start.
I tuned out the rest of his no doubt brilliant elucidations and looked around for a waiter so that I could order something stronger than the white wine which had already been decanted into a carafe on the table. He had even modulated his voice, pitching it slightly higher and softening his consonants. It was for Sir James' case, certainly. It was always for a case, as far as I was aware. I was suddenly disappointed, for that meant he might spring up in pursuit of some suspect at any moment. After a late afternoon spent wrestling with some financial matters associated with my practice, I had been looking forward to an unrushed dinner, followed by a long evening of cigars and brandy with Holmes back at his rooms in Baker Street.
"Okay, you got some glass in there too, but it doesn't look too bad," Doctor Watson says.
"No idea, but whatever it is, you're welcome to it. Everything..." He can't speak for several long seconds then. When Sherlock finally lets him come up for air again, he says, "Let me just get cleaned up a bit and I'll er... meet you in the other room."
Time slowed as they exchanged languid, lingering kisses, the tension building, drawing out, stretching. At the same time, Sherlock's swollen, heavy groin bumped over John's as his hips shifted, a slow, sweet drag and release. John chased the contact, tantalising and maddening, moving his hands down now to Sherlock's backside to hold him in place, guide him, increase the pressure where he needed it most. Sherlock eventually caught on, directing and focusing his movements to coordinate with John, his kisses becoming sloppier until he left off altogether and dropped his head to rest it on John's shoulder. His hips pumped in earnest now, blatant and unambiguous, his hands gripping John's shoulders for leverage.
"A meaningful life?" John exclaims, incredulous. "Who am I to judge? Is that what I have? Is this a meaningful life, right here?" He sweeps his hand around the shabby space.
He was a virtuoso in the art of costuming and disguise and through the course of our many years of acquaintance I had witnessed him in every form from rakish scoundrel and heavy-browed thug to gentried matron. Yet no alter ego agitated me to such a degree as that of the false omega, even (or perhaps especially) when the rest of him remained Holmes. It was wrong in the way of a two-headed calf or a midnight sun, and it made me want to do nothing more than tear his clothes off and cleanse his body of the false scent with my bare hands.
"The hell you are, you-" Doctor Watson has stepped away from the window, too, but he doesn't go far. With one hand, he points behind him at Tristram. "Your son has just nearly been poisoned - possibly been poisoned, in fact," he says, his voice low and dangerous. "He needs medical attention, you have no idea what is waiting for you out there-"
"I never agreed to that!" Sherlock exclaimed.
John waits. When nothing further is forthcoming after a bit, he asks quietly, "Was Tristram all right?"
Irene gives up the pretense of shopping for postcards and faces him. "Yes, I know," she says simply, but there's a heaviness about her eyes that belies her serene expression.
"I'd like that."
By the end of the evening, Greg was, to put it delicately, sloshed. Sherlock discharged his duty as a best man by expertly forging G. Lestrade's signature on the credit card authorisation. John called two cabs, and between the two of them, they managed to stuff Greg and three of the other partygoers into one car, then dropped into the back seat of the other one.
"Actually, we're both guests," Emily points out, but happily plops down on the big bed and bounces around a few times. "Your uncle's pretty funny," she says.
"Are you even listening?" Sherlock scolded him. "There's no file, no one told me anything. Your own body gives you away."
Sherlock felt the familiar flush of a well-made series of deductions, now enhanced by the look of frank admiration on John's face.
"Sit up on the toilet, then I can-" Sherlock says, but John touches Sherlock's cheek. "Your face," he reminds him ruefully. "You really don't-"
Mycroft fixes John with a penetrating look. "I assume he got out again safely, based upon the fact that you are here, and not out playing the avenging angel."
Emily perks up. "Okay," she says. She looks surprised, but she's not about to argue.
Beside him, Emily has taken one of the smiley-faced biscuits out of the bakery bag. She offers it to Tristram. He shakes his head and says, "No thanks." She shrugs and munches on it herself.
Sherlock closes his eyes as if that will remove him from John's steady gaze. His Adam's apple bobs as he swallows thickly. "I'm sorry. I just... I can't."
"God, so she... And she never tried to see him?"
"I'm in," he says breathlessly. He doesn't have room to raise the phone to his ear, so he just holds it in front of his face.
She pulled the dress off her shoulder far enough for us to have a glimpse of the ruin that was left of her back.
~~.~~.~~
Sherlock hummed an affirmative. "The decomposition pattern's particularly nice. Another couple of days would have been even more informative."
John doesn't answer. Just concentrates on those long fingers slowly parting the placket. He can't see much of Sherlock's torso yet beyond flashes of pink.
The next point is that their fathers took them from Uncle Mycroft's house in the middle of the night and drove straight across the country without stopping, causing them to miss a full day of school, unexcused. (Or excused? Tristram has to admit it's possible his father arranged for him to be absent from school in advance; Father's made enough plans this week involving Tristram without letting him know until the last moment. But usually, when a student knows that they will not be in school - such as for a doctor's appointment or a funeral - the teacher gives them the assignments for the days they will miss before they go. Mrs Norris didn't mention anything yesterday. So, the logical conclusion is that his absence today is unexcused.)
It was completely stupid; Tristram sees that now. It's not even as if Tristram wants that. Irene doesn't fit into their life, and he doesn't think she wants to, either. Not like that, anyway; not living in a tiny flat with mismatched furniture and diseased kidneys in the fridge and the police - and the not-so-occasional homeless person - knocking on their door at all hours of the day and night. Knocking, of course, because Father got annoyed at the bell when it kept going off while he was trying to work out a song on his violin, and unscrewed it from the wall and put it in the freezer. Tristram thinks it's actually still there, even though that was months ago. No, Tristram can't visualise Irene in the midst of all of that.
They settle on going to a toboggan run. Doctor Watson assures Tristram he can go, even with his hand in a cast. He just needs someone else to sit in the toboggan with him to work the brakes.
Now it was John's turn to shake his head, although he was still grinning. "You are not getting some poor woman to cook for me. This is bad enough." He gestured around the empty dining room with his water glass. "Although, do you know," he said, now placing his glass carefully back on the table. "I haven't had proper kebap since I got back." It was said lightly, but there was a weight to the words that had Sherlock scrutinising him.
The singing came to a ragged end. The pupils giggled and whispered to each other as they shuffled quickly to their places. The man pulled himself stiffly to standing. Sherlock noticed the cane only now - left-handed, non-dominant arm injured, rank of at least captain, possibly major, given his age.
"You too, Tristram?" Grandmother sighs. "Come here then, at least say good night properly. I shouldn't be surprised if he sweeps you all out of here in the middle of the night again." She holds out a hand to him and offers her cheek.
Sender: John
"I was merely offering, seeing as you're coming off a potentially
"You have no idea what game is being played here," Sherlock sneers.
"You want something to drink?" John said, moving to the sink.
&&&&&&
John exhaled slowly. He knew what Mr Holmes was saying. What he was implying. Did he really believe that? That Sherlock and John were in a committed relationship, however that might be defined? On the other hand, was it not true? John had felt something along those lines for a while now. Now that he was settled back in the flat on Baker Street, John couldn't imagine ever leaving again. Not without Sherlock.
"No, but you might have." A more moderate tone. He was clearly making an effort to rein himself in.
Tristram folds down the corner of the page he's on so he won't lose his place and hands the book over.
"Don't stop--"
black pepper
"You're right," John agrees, separating himself from Sherlock but looking at him fondly. "Maybe we are a bit unhinged at that."
Tristram is burning with curiosity. Things that need explanations are usually interesting. He doesn't think it would be polite to question Doctor Watson any further, but Emily has no such compunctions and pesters and whinges at her father all the way to the Tube station.
This was new territory, and Sherlock wasn't sure what to do with it. Oh, people (both men and women) had come on to him before, propositioned him, made their interest known, but they had always been so unbearably obvious and dull that Sherlock hadn't even needed to consider any option other than rapid and decisive retreat. But John was different. Sherlock found he actually wanted to know John better. He wasn't certain yet whether John was proposing anything other than being friends, but Sherlock had never had one of those as an adult either: someone to exchange thoughts with in an unstructured environment; someone whose company one enjoyed because of who they were, not what they could do; someone who... What else did friends do? Sherlock didn't know. But he was curious now, and he had the feeling that discovering those things with John would be a worthy use of his time.
As soon as he turns the light on in the bathroom, though, he realises it's not water. It's blood. Not a lot, but his fingers are all red and there's red smeared around his arm where the cast starts. His stomach swoops downward. He's supposed to be getting better, and somehow he doesn't think that blood under his cast is part of the healing process. He doesn't panic like he did when he ate the pie, though. Instead, he remembers what Doctor Watson did when Tristram got shot. First, he brought Tristram out to the hall where it was safe. Then he checked him all over to see where he was injured. Then he patched up what he could and called the ambulance for help. Tristram tries to follow those steps now.
"Dinner will be at seven," she said. "If you're not back by then I shall let Myc have all the profiteroles. The ones from Trifton's," she added with a pointed look at Sherlock.
"Hey," John said, wanting to reassure him. To let him know that Mycroft wasn't going to ruin this day for them. "Thanks for that. I had a good time." He patted Sherlock's knee, gave it a squeeze. It didn't feel awkward, or even daring. It felt natural; right.
It's dark in the hallway too, but there is a line of light showing under the door of his father's room. He knows what to do when he needs to speak to his father but the door is closed. He's to knock, wait for an answer, and if there isn't any, he can go in. This may seem counterintuitive, but the reason for a closed door is generally to shield Tristram from noxious chemicals or particularly gruesome dissections. Or, obviously, if Father is using the toilet or something like that. If Tristram isn't to enter yet, Father will say so. If Father can't answer due to incapacitation, it may in fact be vitally important for Tristram to open the door and find out so he can alert Mrs Hudson (that only happened once, when Tristram was six, but they got the room aired out and didn't even need to call an ambulance). Sometimes, Father has simply fallen asleep or is thinking and can't be bothered to respond, and then it doesn't really matter if Tristram comes in. Chemicals and body parts are unlikely here in the bedroom at Llanbroc.
Once the noise had died down, he began: "Ladies and gentlemen, first of all, thank you for your attendance and your support. Before I go any further, I'd like to ask Mr Sherlock Holmes to come forward." He waved toward Sherlock, and the audience turned and craned their necks.
"No." The brief response spoke volumes: Sherlock was hiding something. And if he was hiding something, whatever it was it meant he knew John wasn't going to be pleased about it, because Lord knew Sherlock wouldn't have held back if there were any chance of exciting John over the prospect of an adventure.
"Yes!"
"Me too," Emily chimes in.
"Haven't been waiting long, I hope," John said once he was in speaking distance. His hair was slicked down and combed back. Sherlock thought he looked very, very good.
It's as if the floodgates have been opened inside him; he's drowning and parched at the same time. Sherlock's flesh against his, his mouth, his hands, his tongue; Sherlock's scent in his nostrils, his breath in his lungs, his heat surrounding him. He can't get enough, doesn't know how he ever did without this.
Tristram doesn't know what to say to that. Rather than examining his own feelings too closely, he tries to divine what he thinks his grandmother wants him to say. Despite the little scene he just witnessed - which he still doesn't quite understand - he thinks that she actually likes Doctor Watson; she did spend a lot of time talking to him, and tried to get him to stay at the end.
Sherlock leads them to one of the unmarked metal doors in the concrete side of the structure. Thirty seconds later, he has the door open and disappears inside with John on his heels.
"Teeth and skin," Tristram says, because that's the message. That's the important part. To his horror, his voice is shaking too. He hopes his father understands what he's trying to say.
"Hold still, I can't- Right there oh God John right there," he babbled, his mouth hanging slightly open and now holding perfectly still as John thrust carefully upward, hitting his sweet spot several times in a row.
Emily is in a better mood on the way back to the house, keeping up a steady stream of questions mixed in with her own speculations about the oceans. Doctor Watson, in the driver's seat, responds patiently and with what Tristram has come to recognise as his special brand of indulgent good humour. Tristram's father even chimes in without being prompted to tell about a case involving a body that had been washed up in the Estuary. Tristram has never heard it before, and normally, he would be fascinated, but now he just wishes everyone would stop talking. He is resentful of Doctor Watson and Emily both, how they have drawn his father out of his habitual reserve and engaged him. And at the same time sickeningly guilty, because Father is happy in a way that Tristram's never seen him before. Shouldn't Tristram be happy about that too?
Thus mollified, he'd finished composing the melody for one of the songs for the play. It was more difficult than he'd thought it would be to come up with something that was both singable and appealing. He still had to complete the lyrics, but hopefully they would be able to start learning it this week. He grudgingly admitted he was finding this project slightly more engaging than he'd expected.
"Maybe," John went on, his demeanour tense, "if I hadn't been so considerate of not intruding on your privacy, if I'd felt comfortable talking to you directly, none of this would have happened." Then he smiled, if a bit tightly, but even that diffused some of the tension in the air. "If we're to work together, it would be nice to know something about each other."
Sarah shook her head. "No. No," she repeated, stronger. "I want to."
John lets go of the towel so he can move, and it falls open. Sherlock takes an appreciative look. John lets him.
"It's been a while, but let me have a look." John went to the keyboard and Sherlock brought the music over.
%%%%%%
"Outside my window," Tristram says. "Wasn't that you?"
Now that all is said and done, with the insight that so often comes after the fact, I believe the true source of my altered state lay not in the thrill of the adventure itself, but in the person of my companion, Sherlock Holmes. To witness the perfectly attuned interaction of the physical and the mental which he embodied, the lightning fast reactions of his razor-sharp mind and his finely honed physique, the noble heart reflected in those features as perfectly formed as if chiseled by the hand of a master, led to an admiration of both his form and his functions coupled with a fervor that bordered on obsession and a possessiveness which I judged entirely natural and innocent. I was after all not an invert and never considered that the life force which quickened in me at the sight and even thought of the great detective could be anything more than an expression of the deep bond of comradeship which often forms between men of many years' acquaintance, who have faced down death and celebrated life together. We were alpha brothers-in-arms, like-minded souls, companions in toil and tears, our mutual devotion transcending bonds of blood or marriage... and, as it transpired, the law.
Sherlock considered playing dumb but thought that would only rile John up.
"Yes, Nancy." Victor picked up the picture and held it out to Sherlock. "I met her at my first posting. Big scandal," he confided, but he sounded rather smug. "Typical Mills and Boon stuff. I was cited to the Bishop over it, given an ultimatum. Get married or get out. I chose the life sentence."
But when they get to Emily's street, Doctor Watson double-parks and says, "Won't be long." He takes Emily with him and they go into Emily's aunts' house. Father continues to sit on the passenger side, engrossed in his phone.
Doctor Watson ducks his head in. "Hiya, Basil." If possible, his smile gets even bigger.
"Can I--"
After school, Uncle Mycroft's car is already waiting for them when they come out of school. Tristram is relieved to see that Uncle Mycroft himself is sitting in the back seat. He's not sure what he would have done if it had only been the driver. He knows the man by sight, but he doesn't know his name, and he thought he knew Emily's Aunt Claire and look what happened.
1 lemongrass stick
Sherlock allowed a brief vision to play of John coming home with him, settling on the couch, laughing, taking a glass of wine from Sherlock, fingers brushing, their eyes meeting - The sensation in his stomach intensified and zinged downwards along an internal pathway that hadn't been used in a very long time. In fact, he thought he'd severed that particular connection. Impossible. He wasn't... He couldn't actually be
"Is she dead?" he asks. He'd always assumed she was alive somewhere - when he'd thought of her at all, which was rarely. He feels oddly stricken at the thought that she might be dead, which is stupid because it doesn't matter one whit.
"You can have the rest," John said as he stood and zipped up his jacket.
He was doing the emotional equivalent of injecting poison into their relationship with his behaviour. He had already decided he was going to fail at being a friend - or anything else - to John. That was also why he was holding back from acting on his - and John's - physical impulses and inclinations. He was trying to protect himself from the inevitable loss. A self-fulfilling prophecy. Obvious.
John barked out a laugh. "Really? That's fantastic. When?"
"I've never... You might have to give me a bit of guidance," Sherlock muttered. It was somehow odd, discussing sex like this, calmly and rationally, with one finger up his arse and John's cock red and twitching practically under his nose. Sex with other people had always been nothing more than the physical act, maybe some muffled grunting or at most directions for where to lie or rambling, drug-induced monologues. This casual familiarity spoke of a mutual respect and caring that was hitherto wholly outside of Sherlock's experience.
Tristram shakes his head desperately. Why doesn't Father understand? There wasn't anything there, but the curtain was open! The curtain is not allowed to be open. Ever.
John crouches down and gingerly reaches inside Moriarty's jacket, coming out with a thin leather etui. He flips it open and starts combing through it. "J. L. Moriarty, J., James, James L... Here, his EHIC card. James Llewellen Moriarty." He hands the card to Sherlock.
"I'm not-" John glanced quickly at Lestrade and then back to Sherlock. "Look, can we-" He gave up and sighed. "Greg, could we have a minute?"
"You're welcome," he says with a kind smile.
We can't rush into what is meant to be..."
Sherlock hauls himself up into a sitting position. "Could you at least put some clothes on, John, that's rather distracting," he drawls.
Emily leans over the balustrade to look at the floors above and below. "It's like a hotel!"
"No, God no!" Doctor Watson protests quickly. "That's for the theatre, not winter sports."
John's behaviour wasn't measurably different, either, although the warmth in his smile and the frequency with which he licked his lips - Sherlock was honestly a bit startled to realise now how early in their acquaintance John must have had salacious thoughts about him - told Sherlock that John's memory and assessment of the previous night's activities were fully aligned with his own.
"Don't be too sure."
"Mycroft, mostly," Sherlock says sourly. He flips his hand over to grasp John's. "There's a safe house. He wants you secured before sunrise. I would prefer to keep you in circulation."
"Wasn't sleeping," John said, even though it might not be entirely true. He scooted back to make more room for Sherlock. He'd somehow gravitated toward the middle of the bed. Not used to sleeping with someone anymore.
"Sure," Tristram agrees, relieved that he can absolve himself in this small way.
The new human was nice. Not as nice as his human, of course, but fun to pal around with. Fairly decent at throwing things so Gladstone could demonstrate his expertise at bringing them back. Good at ear-scratching and tummy-rubbing. Even shared his food sometimes.
"I used to."
The station they finally get off at - Meiringen, according to the blue signs hanging on the lampposts - also has snow, but it's just a thin layer, and already disappearing where people have walked through it. There's nothing more coming down at the moment, but it's cold and dark. The train tracks are outside, and Father zips up Tristram's jacket for him as soon as they are off the train. There's not even a proper station, more of a long shed really, with a ticket window and some racks with brochures inside, and a vending machine for snacks and drinks on the back side toward the tracks.
"I still need a couple more flight hours before I'm granted a pilot's license anyway," John says, straight-faced, sliding Sherlock a sideways look.
"No one, but he hit me," he mumbled stupidly.
But John looked away then, licked his lips, and said, "Yeah, no, you're right. I'm not anything. I don't
He's not sure if he gets all the words out, but he must have said at least some of them, because Doctor Watson says, "Your dad will be back soon. Very soon."
"John, yes," Father speaks over him.
But he was getting ahead of himself. John was just his classroom assistant. They'd known each other for fewer than forty-eight hours. They seemed to get on well and might even be on the way to having a friendship. But people tended not to enjoy Sherlock's company for long. This was exactly why it was so important not to allow emotions to hold any sway over him. The tactic had served him well up to now.
She could have screamed. Clearly, someone needed to beat some sense into them both. "He's interested. I think he just doesn't know how to go about it," she said tactfully.
He's only half aware of Father stripping his clothes off him right there in the kitchen and piloting him to the bathroom. He is set on the toilet lid and a moment later a wet flannel is wiping his face. At the same time, he vaguely registers his father talking. It takes him a few moments to realise he's on the phone, and that it must be Doctor Watson on the other end.
"Like I love you," Doctor Watson says. He gives her one last snuggle that turns into a tickle, and then she rolls out of his arms and squirms around on the floor, squealing with delight while his fingers chase her.
"Tristram's functioning. At higher than minimum. It's just these nightmares-"
And of course he needed privacy for... other things. Things he only did in the bedroom with the door stealthily locked, because he didn't want Sherlock to know he'd locked it. Because then Sherlock would know what he was up to. Pleasuring himself. He'd used to masturbate regularly when he'd lived upstairs. He never did it in the shower, likely worried that Sherlock would hear him. Or that he wouldn't clean up thoroughly enough, that he'd leave traces behind that Sherlock might find. He didn't know that Sherlock had been able to hear him quite well from his own bedroom directly below anyway, the telltale squeaks of the bed, the low, vocal exhale at the end when he climaxed. That Sherlock sometimes got hard listening to those sounds. Palmed his heavy sac and squeezed his throbbing erection, curled on his side, resisting the shameful urge to get himself off in time with John.
Doctor Watson pulls Emily closer against his side. She isn't wearing any pink, Tristram is relieved to see. "Tris was just giving us a tour of the grounds," Doctor Watson says. "We didn't mean to disturb you."
"Hey, Tris, do you know where a fellow can find anything to eat around here? Your father said something about a dining room, but this place is like a maze."
"He's not going to hurt me. He wants me for his plans. He'd hardly have gone to all this trouble just to blow my brains out. Anticlimactic," Sherlock sniffs, as if personally affronted that John would think him capable of giving so much as the time of day to someone with so little imagination.
Doctor Watson is leaning in so he can see the worksheet, with his arm over the back of Tristram's chair. He's not touching Tristram, but he's close, and Tristram catches himself thinking about what it would feel like to lean against his shoulder. Would it be hard yet warm, like when he leaned against his father's side the other night looking out the window at Llanbroc? Would it make him feel safe in the same way? He doesn't feel unsafe now, certainly. Now that he knows there aren't going to be any more bombs and no one will try to kidnap him or Emily again.
Holmes lifted his wine glass and held it delicately by the stem. His eyes gleamed in the unfamiliar yellow glow of the electric lights which had recently been installed in the establishment. "You heard Sir James' assertion that Gruner is said to have the whole of the omega gender at his mercy. I was interested to see how he would attempt to overcome me. I'm afraid I left disappointed in that regard."
Sherlock steps into the pub. It's dim and smells of stale beer and cigarettes even though no smoking is allowed on the premises. John is sitting at one of the tables lining the perimeter of the room. He has already spotted Sherlock. He sighs and looks down at his pint. Sherlock goes to the bar and orders one for himself. The last time they went to a pub together was John's stag night. This may not have been the best idea after all. Sherlock dismisses the thought. It's too late now. He takes the glass from the barman and walks back to John.
The bell rang for the start of classes. Sherlock became aware of the frozen tableau of teachers paused in their morning preparations around them. John was standing there with the corners of his mouth turned down, but it was more hurt than disapproval. It was only now that Sherlock really looked at him: used a new razor that morning, same shirt and jacket he wore to Angelo's (freshly laundered), detoured to the bathroom to comb his hair before coming into the break room. Sherlock took a step back, nearly stumbling against a chair, and had to catch at the back of it to maintain his balance.
"Yes, well, we're going to go a bit method this year."
"That..." John pants, still out of breath, "was completely insane. We must have left all kinds of evidence. Fingerprints... Hell, they saw us going in. They'll know we did it. And we didn't even do it!"
Tristram's father frowns in irritation. "Yes, of course he knows. Do you think I'd just send you to someone's house without discussing it with them beforehand?"
"Oh fuck, oh my God..." John's whole body was tingling, a cyclone gathering strength, swirling in toward the centre, hot and wild. A pulsating pressure, untamed, thrashing. And then unleashed, a torrent of sensation. Waves of pleasure, overlapping, exploding, spiraling outward, beyond the borders of his body. Reverberating with Sherlock's, echoing and crashing back over him. Sherlock's mouth on his, swallowing his hisses and choked-off cry, swallowing his very breath. Sherlock's body jerking in his arms, stiffening, his buttocks clenching, heat between them adding to heat, a strangled gasp.
Doctor Watson seems to be struggling with something, but whether it's his own internal misgivings or something that Father's said, Tristram can't tell. Tristram's not sure why, and he doesn't even really know what the question means, but he desperately wants Doctor Watson to answer yes. And when he does, Tristram knows that something has changed right at that moment. "Yes," Doctor Watson says. "All right, yes. We're with you." He stands up.
"She was a holy terror," Doctor Watson announces, mostly to Father, who's leaning in the doorway to the bedroom with his arms crossed. He's been in there doing... something - Tristram's not sure what - since they got back about an hour ago.
1/4 cup rice milk
As soon as the door closes behind Irene, John tells Tristram and Emily to start gathering their things and pack as much as they can while he takes care of the stuff in the bedroom.
Irene straightens up. "I told you, he's safe. Safe as houses now that that's dealt with." She jerks her head back toward the body on the floor.
Sprinkle potatoes with flour and 2 teaspoons salt, then top with egg. With your hands, work flour and egg into a dough.
On top of the general chorus of 'eww's, Alfie screwed up his face in disgust. "What, on the mouth?"
"It's not real," Emily says promptly, as if Doctor Watson might have forgotten.
Mrs Hudson leaned in to speak in a stage whisper: "Between you and me, he probably saved your job as well."
He set a task for the children to work on in small groups and walked around slowly, checking on their progress. He was bent over to answer a question when a scuffle broke out at another table. The other children quickly erupted in shouts and screeches.
I suspected as soon as I saw Holmes from across the dining room at Simpson's later on that same evening that he was "shamming omega". He had a certain way of comporting himself, a slight looseness about the hips that invited thoughts of plush, slick flesh and a straight-legged gait that belittled his most salient alpha trait. My suspicion was confirmed as soon as I took my seat and the light, sweet scent wafted across the table. It was a perfume of his own invention, perfected over the years until not even I, who knew its origin, could distinguish it from the emanations of a born omega. Yet despite its verisimilitude it did not tempt me nor stir any desire in my loins. I know this was no fault of the concoction itself, as I had seen alphas falling over themselves to fawn on Holmes when he applied it. Instead, I was gripped by the usual irrational sense of unease that came over me whenever Holmes appeared before me in this guise.
Tristram hovers uncertainly in the middle ground between the two adults. He doesn't want to fall back too far behind John, but he thinks it prudent that he take extra care as well, even though his boots give him a good grip. It would be dumb if he slipped and fell on his injured hand. Or broke his other one too. Emily is apparently equally torn between sticking with her father and accompanying Tristram, with the result that the four of them end up strung out at relatively equal intervals along the length of an entire block. The distance between Tristram and John is unacceptably long. Although he can still see him, almost at the street corner, he's not sure John would hear him if he called out. Suddenly, Tristram feels uncomfortably exposed.
John nods. He clenches and unclenches his hands and purses his lips before saying simply, "Right. Yeah, okay. Um... good night then." He executes an almost military turn and starts for the door.
"And how, exactly, would such a kiss play out?" Sherlock asked, not even trying to sound casual.
The corners of Mycroft's mouth turned up a bit further.
"Your dad isn't even here yet," he says, breathless from running, as he looks around. All he can see is blue uniforms as the other children stream past them.
"Come on--"
to John Watson. He was all wrong, he was- Well, look at him: shorter than average, of no great intelligence, with lines and gray hair in excess of his age, psychologically damaged, no taste in clothes. He'd joined the army, for heaven's sake. And yet...
She sits down without an invitation and proceeds to ask precisely the questions he didn't want to have to answer. Why he's here, how Mary's doing, what Sherlock's up to. He mumbles his way through a few lies—early conference, fine, the usual—knowing she's not buying a word of what he's saying.
Finally, in a moment of clarity, I discerned a pattern: he was concentrating his efforts on my upper chest, uninjured shoulder, and stomach, with occasional detours along my arms. He avoided altogether the shoulder through which the Jezail bullet had passed, as well as my nipples. I presumed he was trying to spare me undue pain, or was perhaps honestly fearful that the wax was too hot for the sensitive tissue. I did not think it would be, and I was curious in any case to find out how it would feel. I was wracking my fuzzy brain for the words to express my desire when Holmes' voice sounded close to me.
Scent association. The brain's a veritable buggery bitch.
"Jesus, why don't we all just read the damn thing!" Doctor Watson explodes and throws his arms up in the air.
I was not ready to lay myself bare before him so soon, however, even if only in a figurative sense this time. I did not want to distract his concentration from the very serious matter of the unfortunate Miss de Merville. There was another consideration as well, namely that he never made a single mention of our visit to the Inferno Club himself. I was not too put off by this; I knew he was a private person and often found discussions of a personal nature distasteful, or pooh-poohed matters of the heart as frivolous. His actions in the "games room" and afterward, when he paid me so patient attention, spoke louder to me than his current silence. He might simply have set those things aside for the time being, for the sake of his client. Or he might be working through his own confusion at what had passed between us. I would not press the issue, as there was no urgency in its resolution. I decided to let the matter rest for several days or longer, at least until the conclusion of the current case.
"It'll be like a bivouac." Doctor Watson grins over his shoulder as he buckles up and turns the engine on again.
uses."
And just like that, the tension defused. Sherlock pulled back and John huffed out an incredulous breath. "Chicken... You were butchering a chicken in your bathtub?" John's mental faculties were clearly not at their best when dealing with a physical challenge at the same time. At least Sherlock hoped this wasn't a display of John's most acute mental state.
"I thought you were asleep," Father says, his voice pitched low.
"It's a long shot. Both literally and figuratively."
Tristram looks at Doctor Watson. He's staring at Father, looking grim.
"Yeah, just like that," John said. Sherlock felt him shifting and opened his eyes. John was sitting up now, his knees spread to cradle Sherlock's arse, one hand still working inside Sherlock and the other pumping his own cock.
John smiles indulgently. "It wasn't the most far-fetched conclusion she could have drawn. But it would have been too complicated to try and explain, and it doesn't matter. She would have given you the sweet either way."
It's a good thing it isn't London, because if it were, John wouldn't be twelve hundred kilometres away and Sherlock might well not be able to resist lessening the distance to mere centimetres, if that.
The point is, though, that Father was there last night, and Irene said that Tristram was the very first thing he asked about. That made Tristram miss his father even more, and he already missed him a nearly unbearable amount. Father hasn't even seen that he's got all the bandages off his back. But he's fine, Irene said, and she told Father and John that Tristram was fine and now that the danger is over, she's bringing him back to them. Although she wouldn't say how it's over, whether the bad guys are in jail or ... well, dead is the only other possibility that Tristram can think of. Maybe Irene thinks Tristram is squeamish about dead bodies, because he can't imagine why she wouldn't want to tell him if they were in jail.
Still, it had to end. Too soon. John's grip relaxed. Sherlock let his arms drop, sliding down John's back and chest. Loath to lose the contact. As they started to move apart, Sherlock turned his head just a bit to gather one last breath of scent. His mouth grazed John's cheek. Inadvertent. Caught the corner of his mouth. Unintentional. Mostly. Partially. John paused. He hadn't let go. Sherlock moved his head away, slowly. Plausible deniability. But John followed his motion, chasing after him, darting forward to reclaim the lost centimetres. Full on, mouths closed, not moving but impossible to deny. He held it for a few seconds. Three. Five. Then broke it off, resting his face against Sherlock's.
"You don't know that."
"Great, thanks." John stepped aside to let Mr Holmes pass through to the hall, staring hard at Sherlock, willing him to say something. Did he not understand the situation?
forget to put his phone in his pocket, and he made Father worry - and probably John, too - by going with Irene.
Tristram's father rolls his eyes, but Tristram can tell he's trying not to look pleased. Perhaps they didn't argue after all.
So that was it. Bad memories. They still plagued him, but Sherlock had already known that. The regrets. The losses. The association of Sherlock and the role of best man must have conjured up unpleasant images for him. The wedding itself had been fine, but it had started the ball rolling on a great many things that were distinctly not fine. Sherlock wished he could fix it the way he'd fixed John's limp. In lieu of a good chasing down of a murderer, he offered, "Could probably have done without the attempted murder."
Watson." He inclined his head toward John with a greasy smile.
Sherlock sat down next to him, not quite touching him but close enough that John could smell the dusty, comforting scent of the fur he'd draped over his shoulders against the night chill. Sherlock pulled his legs up and wrapped his arms around his knees, which were clad in loose leather breeches. "Open it," he said. His voice was hushed, as if he didn't want any of the others in the clan to hear him. The precaution was superfluous; almost everyone was already asleep.
Sherlock clambers off the bed and somehow comes up with a pair of pants, which he stumbles into on his way across the room. He ends up just behind John, although he refrains from touching him. "And Emily?"
(See the end of the chapter for
When the mice start looking for more, Tristram stretches his arm out and flicks the rest of the cake bits toward them.
"Look, shut up, all right? You've nothing to be sorry about. Let's just... " John cast about desperately for a distraction, and lit upon the violin on the wall. "So this was yours?" John went over to it, ostensibly to get a better look but really to avoid having to look at Sherlock. He never knew how to react when Sherlock was uncharacteristically mindful of John's feelings.
Before Tristram can answer, Doctor Watson's manner changes abruptly to brisk and commanding as his call connects. "Yes, hello, this is Doctor John Watson and I'm at 221 Baker Street, November Whiskey One Five Romeo Tango, with an eight-year-old male, no known allergies, gunshot wound through and through to the right hand, multiple lacerations to back, head, and arms from glass shards, still embedded, working on stabilisation, bleeding minimal. Patient is alert and oriented times three, heart rate elevated one-twenty; respirations elevated, twenty-five and shallow, no abnormal chest excursions; skin cool and slightly clammy; colour and peripheral perfusion good; pressure dressing in place to GSW with normal CMS fingertips and moderate slow seepage. We also have suspected poisoning—same patient—by unknown agent according to parent report about an hour ago, spontaneous vomiting followed by my administration of activated charcoal, 50 milligrams PO, approximately twenty minutes ago. Patient responded well to medication."
"He went in the bathroom with my dad," she points out, in case Tristram hadn't seen the connection.
"Sure," Doctor Watson agrees. He slaps his thighs and stands up to go and fetch some sheets.
Sherlock's expression falters then turns into a scowl. "Yes. Right." His hand drops away from the faucet and he stands there, one hand still on John's chest, staring down at his fingers distractedly.
"It's all right," Sherlock says softly. His eyes are wide and he's watching John as if he were a never-before-seen phenomenon. "The only reason... I believed you were safe," he says. "You and Emily and Tristram. I only left because I believed the three of you were safe. That it was the only way to keep you safe. You can't imagine my... When Moriarty taunted me with the picture of Irene and Tristram together..."
"Did you find the-" Tristram stops himself before he says 'bogeyman'. Father doesn't like calling him that. "- the man who sent Mister Tonga?" he decides on instead. He tries to keep his voice pitched soft and low. Emily, especially, is not supposed to know the truth of everything that happened. Especially that her father was the sniper's target, not Tristram.
"I'll give you distracting, I'll--" John takes a step in Sherlock's direction, raising his hand as if to strike, but thinks better of it and shakes his head, laughing in an entirely humourless way. "Oh, my God. I knew, I
I gave up all resistance at his word, and my release came bursting forth, splattering my stomach with the thick gush of my seed. The first wave was followed by a second and a third, and then Holmes was upon me as if my scent were water and he a desert nomad. His kisses were barely more than frantic nips and panted gasps. He crouched over me, scrabbling at his trousers until he was able to get his hand inside.
Little could we have known when my friend Sherlock Holmes passed me Colonel Sir James Damery's note that it would not only provide the supreme showcase for the great detective's remarkable and diverse talents, but also open a door that would fundamentally alter the course of our lives from that moment forward. It was not quite a year after the end of my second marriage when this remarkable case came to Holmes' attention. I have refrained from detailing my latter foray into wedlock in my published writing for various reasons, chief amongst them being respect for my former spouse and her reputation, but in no less part my own shame at the events which led to her petition for divorce fewer than five years after our wedding. It will be useful now, however, to touch on some pertinent points which may serve to illustrate my state of mind and set the stage for what came after.
"What is it?" Emily wants to know.
The surgeon who had attended him in the immediate aftermath of the assault prescribed that he remain confined to his rooms for the duration of his convalescence, or until he was fit to resume his usual activities, and I concurred. As this coincided nicely with Holmes' scheme to lull Gruner into a false sense of security by misleading him into the belief that Holmes lay at death's door, we received no complaint.
Sherlock smiled against his cheek. "Actually, I'd hoped you'd continue to do quite a lot of both."
"You find this intriguing," Holmes said in my ear, his voice low enough that only I could hear amongst the other couples likewise sharing their opinions between themselves.
"Where's that bag then?" John asks, patting blindly around on top of the cover behind Sherlock.
4 tbs grapeseed oil
"And miss out on the scintillating entertainment?" Sherlock checked the screen and pushed 'D' for 3. A nature documentary, this time Sherlock's choice but John had been drawn in and they'd ended up spending a very enjoyable evening trying to outdo each other with ever more bizarre facts and anecdotes about cetaceans, including the one about the octopus that had climbed out of its tank in the science lab and crawled across the hall to toss a rotten shrimp at the scientist studying it.
Watson moved first, giving himself a barely noticeable shake and flicking the tip of his tongue out to lick his bottom lip before saying, "Right, well, I'm actually here to assist you. Greg said something about a play-"
When had we stopped taking the air together? I could not recall. That in itself was telling. Some time before Miss Morstan had brought the tale of her fabulous treasure to our home, that much I knew.
John crowds into the space between Sherlock's knees. He holds out a roll of cloth adhesive tape for Sherlock to help him with. His effusion has lessened a bit, but he's still grinning.
Sherlock frowns thunderously. "If you don't want to have anal intercourse with me, you only need say so."
"No, of course not," Sherlock scoffs. "I mean, yes. I don't trust her, but she won't hurt the children. I believe she has some twisted, romantic sense that she's a mother lioness protecting her cub. In fact, I believe she would go to quite some lengths to do so. Which is another reason why I don't trust her. But I don't see any other choice."
John reached down for his trousers. "No, it's all right, I'll go for you," he said amiably and started to pull them on.
"We're just playing," Emily says, but she sounds uncertain.
"Pardon?"
"But for this- this is something I know from the other side. When I-" John leans back against the table, gripping the edge behind him, and looks down. "You know I saw action," he says in a low voice.
So of course it's very important that they keep the phone on them at all times, not in their school bag or jacket, because if there were a fire alarm or something, it would get left behind. They are not to show their phones to anyone or take them out and play with them. All in all, the whole thing is scarier and less fun than it seemed at first. Because if Doctor Watson and his father are giving them these phones (and Tristram is certain this is something that his father knows all about already), then they must think there is a good chance that something like Friday Afternoon will happen again.
After a time, John has no idea how long, their motions become less frantic, their touches more gentle, until they finally break apart, chests heaving and mouths reddened.
"Well, you did seem pretty into it that one time," John said. Sherlock could hear the sheepish grin, and one formed on his face as well. "But maybe that was your quota for the decade." Sherlock felt John's shrug.
There is the sound of coins, followed by the computerised voice giving the instructions again.
She steps back and looks them all over - Tristram, Father, John, and Emily. John has his arm around Emily's shoulder, and Father is standing just behind John so their shoulders overlap. It's possible that Father's hand is resting on John's back, although Tristram can't see from where he's standing.
Finally, finally, all of the handshakes and well-wishes and flowers and photographs were done, the children were bundled off with their families, tired but happy, the parents smug with visions of little Susie and Georgie being the next Hollywood darling.
"Sure, I think Tris is good to get up now," John agrees. He stands up and brushes his trousers off. "We should probably buy something to thank the woman for letting us use her shop." He glances in the direction of the rack outside the door where the whole thing started. "I'll go pick up a couple of postcards for Harry and Clara. Why don't you two go see if you can't find some souvenir you'd like. Something small," he admonishes them, glancing over at Irene. "I'm not keen to take a whole cuckoo clock back with us."
Sherlock had completely forgotten the dog. He looked under the table, only to see him stretched out on his side, sound asleep, with his head resting on one of John's feet. As if sensing his master's attention, Gladstone perked up and yawned, and looked at Sherlock expectantly.
They were getting too old to sustain that kind of diet. Especially John. His parents had both died of cardiovascular deficiencies (his father had suffered cardiac arrest at 54, his mother a massive stroke at 68). Sherlock probably didn't have as much to worry about: Mummy and Dad were still in excellent health, not even so much as a hint of high blood pressure, although Mummy did have slight diabetic tendencies. But if John was to enjoy a healthier diet, then so was Sherlock.
"I'll remember that for next time, shall I?" John says, a bit manically. "Maybe pop in myself, just to hear what he has to say. We still don't know, for example, who Mary's actual killer was."
"There was this bloke," Doctor Watson is saying, "one of the other doctors at the base where I was stationed. Captain Gentry. We called him Gents. Sometimes Ladies and Gents." Doctor Watson grins. "Sometimes just Ladies." Tristram is still staring at the floor, but he can hear the smile.
"Hello, everybody! I'd like to welcome you to our annual Christmas bazaar at the Blackwood School. As you know, Christmas is a time for giving, a time for charity and valuing those people less fortunate than ourselves. So in that spirit, I'd like to recognise my very good friend from the Baker Street School, who will be directing their own quaint little version of the Nativity and is here to pick up some tips on just how the job is done. Mr Sherlock Holmes!" He made a grand gesture in Sherlock's direction, his expression all teeth and sharp eyes.
"Oh, Sherlock," Mrs Hudson said, equal parts sympathy and disappointment.
witty and clever. And even with everything, she's..." He shakes his head. "I don't believe she's a bad person. But she's not... When I finally had everything I thought I wanted — a lovely wife, a solid position, the respect of my peers — it was like getting to the end of the rainbow and finding the pot of gold, only it turned out what I really needed was cash if I wanted to buy anything." He lifts his glass and takes a deep draught.
******
John shakes his head. "No."
"He told you this?"
"Maybe we could go sit down?" John suggested.
"Just lucky, I guess," Sherlock says in answer to John's question. His expression is wry but also somewhat guarded, as if he's not sure whether that's the right response or not.
"Who?" Father sends a quick frown in Doctor Watson's direction.
"You aren't, you're just desensitised. Look, do you want me to take a picture? It's already barely going in, I'm having to force it." That was a very small lie: although John did have to apply some pressure, Sherlock's arsehole was very prettily swallowing the dildo. So prettily, in fact, that John had to take it out several times and slide it back in just to check that he wasn't imagining things at this point. By the time he was quite satisfied, Sherlock was once more breathing hard and his constricted genitals were quite a lurid colour where they hung -- or rather stood -- between his thighs.
She rolled onto her stomach uneasily. "We don't have to," she said, because there was something desperate about him now, something that made her uncomfortable. He wouldn't even let her touch him. Was he that put off by having sex with a woman? Or was it just her? Why was he even doing this then? Because it wasn't for her, that was for damn sure.
"Wait," Father says. Tristram has his eyes closed, but he can hear that Father doesn't go far. He's back within moments, wiping Tristram's mouth with what feels like towel.
"That should be-" Sherlock grunts. "Incredibly obvious."
As it turned out, Lestrade hadn't wanted to talk about John after all. Although it had still been an awkward and painful conversation. Sherlock went up the stairs, registering the muted sounds of the telly coming from Mrs Hudson's flat along with the mixed scents of shepherd's pie, cinnamon scones, and fish curry in the stairway. And very faintly, marijuana. The latter two from their landlady (Chatterjee must be on the outs with his wife again), the former from upstairs. John had been cooking. Not only cooking, but baking. Sherlock steeled himself and opened the door to the flat.
And now two mental absences within five minutes, upon being confronted with Sherlock in his costume. The brow furrow. Past experience informed Sherlock that if he continued to say nothing, life would go on as usual and eventually new crises and traumas would overlay the old ones, burying them deep enough they might as well be forgotten. But past experience was based on the time before. Before Sherlock had died. (Twice.) (Both times in front of John.) Before Mary. (Before the baby, which was never, ever referenced, not ever, not even obliquely.) Before Sherlock's life had become nothing more than a string of moments of borrowed time. Before John had asked the question. Before Sherlock had admitted he knew the answer. He still hadn't told John. Maybe it was time to start.
"Mm, come here, you, you know you love it." She lifted her head to catch his mouth with hers and tugged at his shirt until it came free from his waistband.
"And yet you did."
When they'd completed the tour and John's stomach started grumbling, they left the dockyards for a small, quiet restaurant that Sherlock knew in another part of town. It was nothing very fancy, but the tables had real tablecloths and fresh flowers, and there were matching water and wine glasses and two sets of forks and knives at each setting. John had soup and a salad with roasted chicken strips, anticipating a large meal that evening. Sherlock had fish with couscous, and actually ate it all. They shared a bottle of wine, although John drank most of it as Sherlock was driving. They talked about pirates and Battleship, favourite Christmases and which diseases seafarers were most susceptible to. The leaky tap in their bathroom. Whether Mrs Hudson would like the Christmas present they'd given her before they left: an array of UV lights for the cannabis plants they weren't supposed to know anything about. They didn't talk about their arms around each other at the museum, the breathless moment in bed the night before, or their feet knocking together under the table until John pulled Sherlock's in between his and held it there while their eyes met over the rims of their wine glasses.
"Is that the difference between you and the rest of the world then? You care to see?"
Next to him, John shifted and rubbed Sherlock's arm, giving it a squeeze. Pleasure both physical and emotional bloomed. If he turned his head, he'd find John staring straight ahead, but with a little half-smile that said he was replaying their tryst in his head too. Sherlock's scowl deepened as his irritation with himself grew. He was going to need to institute a rule about touching.
Emily gets to go first, then Tristram. There's a recorded voice that says what to do, and you can even choose which language. Tristram chooses English. Doctor Watson adjusts the stool for him so he's at the right height. There's a choice between taking four different poses or just one. They only need the one, so Tristram pushes that button. Then Doctor Watson hands Tristram some coins and pulls the curtain closed so there won't be any shadows on the picture. Tristram drops the coins into the slot and smiles at himself in the reflecting glass. Then there is a flash, and it's all done. Emily's pictures have already come out of the slot on the side of the machine, so now they wait for Tristram's while Doctor Watson takes his turn. Father goes last.
"Did you know," Father begins expansively, now that he is assured of a captive and grateful audience, "that every strain of tobacco has a particular chemical signature that leaves identifiable traces in the hair of habitual smokers? Our suspect smokes hand-rolled cigarettes filled with pure nicotiana andamana, a type of tobacco that's not sold in England due to its extreme potency. He hasn't been here long, maybe six months, must have brought his own supply with him. It's quite unique."
Sherlock looked down into John's eyes. There was anticipation, excitement, ardour, but also … caring; concern; a genuine desire for Sherlock's well-being and pleasure. John didn't want this for himself; he wanted it for the two of them together. Was Sherlock ready to accept those things? To possibly even return them? He realised, though, that he did return them already.
"None of them will be any
Watson's interest in me was apparent from the start, although his shyness over his injuries and natural circumspection prevented him from making any overtures outright. As for myself, I feared that engaging in carnal intercourse with my flat-mate might prove troublesome and lead to complications in our daily affairs. It was for this reason alone that I did not encourage him, for I could not deny that I found him intriguing. Had we met under different circumstances, I have no doubt I would have found myself with his prick down my throat the same evening.
Tristram supposes, thinking back on it now, that that's true, but wouldn't it have behooved Irene to mention she'd picked up the passport when John came back? On the other hand, maybe she was so startled by the way John burst into the room and then put his elbow into her throat that she forgot. Or, like she said, didn't think it was important because they were going to be together anyway.
"Hey, I brought something," Tristram says, both to distract her and because he was planning on getting the book out anyway. He gets off the bed and goes to his school bag, which is on the chair by the dresser.
"Okay, I'm not..." John runs his tongue over his lower lip and laughs a bit. "I'm guessing this isn't what it sounds like, because it really, really sounds like... No, I'm not even going to venture who she's talking about here."
"She's been headlining here for two weeks already. Apparently she's engaged for the mid-season leading up to Christmas. Our reservations weren't made until three days ago. I don't see how." Sherlock sounds dismissive, yet not entirely convinced.
"Don't you have his private number?"
, Sherlock," John corrects him. "
And then right there, right in the middle of his father's head, a little yellow light flares up. It takes Tristram a moment to understand that it's not a reflection of something inside the flat, but something coming from outside. He sits up straight and unfocuses his eyes to force them to see through the glass rather than on the surface. There, again, only this time the glow is orange. It's coming from one of the windows of the building directly across from them. He immediately knows what that is. It's the bodyguard, the one Uncle Mycroft sent to watch them at Grandmother's. It doesn't look like he took Tristram's advice about the nicotine patches. He hopes he's at least where he's supposed to be this time, even if he is smoking on duty. He wouldn't want the man to get in trouble. But he won't tell. It makes Tristram feel safer after all the upset with the near poisoning, knowing that there's someone out there who's protecting him and his father.
"Fine," Sherlock acceded, although he did slump back petulantly in his chair.
But now, Father seems, well, happy. Happy to have a receptive audience in Doctor Watson. Tristram wonders now if he should have been more engaged, more enthusiastic, more curious, when Father mentioned his work. More like Doctor Watson. He can't change it now, of course, but the regret looms large.
In a hot saucepan on stove add grapeseed oil. Add shallot and garlic and let them sweat a little.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Yeah," Tristram says, only he has to cough a little when he says it, which makes him feel even more stupid. "I'm sorry," he mumbles and has to look away.
"He could have had the couch, I wouldn't-" Doctor Watson squeezes his eyes shut. "Oh my God, no, I'm the idiot. He did, he tried to make me take his bed, and I thought it was because-" He stops speaking abruptly and cracks his eyes open, keeping one carefully on Tristram. "Sherlock!" he shouts down the hall. "You could have said you wanted to sleep on the couch!"
He takes another drag, deep and slow, then blows it out the window over the rooftops of Prague. It could almost be London, just shy of five a.m., the sky tilting from black to gray to smudgy lavender behind the silhouettes of a thousand years of history. It smells wrong, though. Where London is ozone and iron, Prague is wood and sulphur. A little more fire, a little less earth.
"You'd have practised with her beforehand of course, to impress me."
Tristram looks up at his father, too, genuinely wondering what his answer will be. If they were here alone, just he and his father and Grandmother, Father would certainly say it was a stupid idea, and that if Tristram needed fresh air, he could go out into the garden. But Father's reactions have broken his usual patterns several times now where Doctor Watson and Emily are concerned.
"Why not." I gave him a quick, encouraging smile, hoping not to appear too eager for the paltry crumb of attention. "I can always go to the museum later." My positive response did not elicit the release of tension in his demeanour that I had hoped for. If anything, he appeared even more nervous.
"A restaurant," Tristram says. "Father and I go there sometimes."
Emily brightens up. "Really? Together with me?"
This must be why logic is superior to emotions, like he heard Father telling Inspector Lestrade once. People - criminals - he said, make mistakes and get caught because they fall prey to their emotions. 'God help us if you ever get bored with this end, then,' Inspector Lestrade answered, which made Tristram feel proud of Father because it meant the police really needed his help. But Father won't get bored with solving crimes, so Inspector Lestrade needn't worry.
"Did you think I would have sent you the wrong address?" Sherlock had meant to be a sharp reproach, but it came out more as gentle teasing.
"Come here then," Sherlock told him.
Father, though, seems to take the statement at face value and agrees: "No, you wouldn't. And would you have Tristram and your daughter come along as well? Maybe they'd like to hear what Moran's people are doing to track his killer?"
Tristram, all but smothered by Emily, hears his father say, "Henry." His voice comes out kind of funny and he has to clear his throat.
"Yes," Sherlock says firmly. "Tristram is coming back."
"Well reasoned," Sherlock conceded, "but were there any hand prints? Foot prints? Smearing?"
John appeared thrown for a moment. "What do you mean?"
They have everything packed by dinner time. John decides to order room service rather than go out - not even to the hotel restaurant - in case Father comes back.
"He was lying on the couch next to you," Emily tells him matter-of-factly.
"The police don't consult amateurs," Greg scoffs.
"But my dad slept on the couch," Tristram reminds her. "And when they were both in the living room, as soon as we came in, my dad left. He didn't want us to see them together."
At the top of the stairs is another metal door, but this one is unlocked from their side. They emerge in the top deck of seating. Illuminated only by emergency lights, Sherlock leads the way through the silent rows, climbing higher until they are in the last row, at a point where the roof curves down to touch the outer wall.
Father blinks his eyes open. Snow is still clinging to his eyelashes. He narrows his eyes at Tristram.
Conventional wisdom on relationships, he knew, said that he should 'open up' and 'trust' John. But he honestly didn't see how telling him about his past as a drug user could have any possible bearing on what they were to each other now. He was clean, both mentally and physically. If anything, it would be one more reason for John to dislike him. Or was it meant as some sort of litmus test? To see whether John still wanted to be his friend even knowing all the mistakes he'd made, all the failures he'd undergone? At any rate, he personally had no need to test John in that manner. In fact, it made more sense to present as bleached and whitewashed a picture as possible in order to entice John to stick around. Sherlock was bound to make enough mistakes in the present time without the need for bringing up the past as well.
Rather than heading toward the lifts across from the nurse's station, Father leads them to a door with a green 'Emergency Exit' sign on it. It also has a red bar on the handle that Tristram knows will trigger an alarm if it's depressed. There's a key hole in it, though, and Father already has one of his lockpicking tools in his hand. There can be no doubt by now that Tristram is not actually supposed to be leaving the hospital, but Father knows when it's best to take an unofficial route. This is obviously one of those times.
Tristram's not sure what to do with that information. It's surprising, to say the least. Of course he'd like to have a sleepover with Emily, but he never told his father that. And why at Uncle Mycroft's? Uncle Mycroft and Emily didn't seem to like each other very much when they met that one time on the way home from school. Wouldn't it make more sense for them to sleep at either Tristram's or Emily's house? Unless his father is worried they might disturb one of his experiments, or Emily's Aunt Harry is really sick. But why does it have to be a secret? And finally, not that Tristram has much experience with these things, but aren't sleepovers usually done on a night when there's no school the next day?
"My dear Watson, forgive me. I have made an error in judgment." His contrition appeared genuine, a condition as astonishing as it was rare.
Once inside, the throng dispersed, most heading first toward the long table where white-jacketed servers were setting out rows of champagne flutes. John touched Sherlock on the elbow. "I'll just get us one?" he suggested.
"Emily says you'd like it if I read a chapter of this to you," Father says. It sounds like he finds the notion foreign but not entirely unappealing, like Tristram felt the first time he ate raw fish. He hadn't been opposed to trying it, and the colors and shapes made him curious, but it had taken a bit of convincing on Uncle Mycroft's part. In the end, he'd enjoyed it very much. Tristram wishes he'd gone downstairs with Emily so he could have heard what she said.
It's what he sees, though, that kicks ashes over those glowing embers, replacing them with a chilly kind of hollowness in his gut. Because Sherlock's chest does not look like John expected.
Add a small amount of cheese to each pepper - press it down with your fingers as you fill them so it gets in all the nooks and crannies.
Father flicks the curtain back down. "Not that I know of," he says, but he snatches his phone up from the side table where it's charging and starts typing on it rapidly.
"I have her on now." Father types something.
I was half lost in my muddled thoughts and still anticipating a quiet end to the evening when Holmes tossed his serviette abruptly onto his plate and rubbed his hands briskly together.
"Agreed." Sherlock lets his hands drop to his sides, but keeps his eyes closed. He might be resting, or thinking.
Father almost smiles. "Good. That will certainly make things easier."
"No, it's fine. I'm just waiting for John to come back." His father sits down on the foot of Tristram's bed, while Emily forgoes the field bed to fit herself in next to Tristram up against the headboard, the way they were last night when Doctor Watson read to them. Her shoulder presses against Tristram's, and he presses back, just a little, not to defend his space but to share it.
He didn't get any further than saying, 'Why can't we-' before Irene's hand tightened on his arm. It didn't quite hurt, but there was an unpleasant pinch.
"I don't know," Sherlock rasped, staring down at his food. The food John had made for him. That John had planned and cooked and made for the two of them together. Because this was something he looked forward to too. This was something John needed just as much as Sherlock did. Not because he was trying to trick Sherlock, or shame him, but because he'd been hurt and wanted to understand, wanted Sherlock to make him see, to give him an explanation that would make it all make sense, like bringing all the threads of a case together that no one else was clever enough to. And even though he'd been hurt, even though Sherlock had lied to him and betrayed his trust, he'd tried to make it easier for Sherlock. To let him know things weren't about to change just because Sherlock had been a royal arse.
Sherlock dropped his cock out of the hold so he could encircle John more firmly, and blindly fumbled with his free hand to find John's nipple - the left one - and pinched, fairly hard. At the same time he gave him the filthiest kiss he could muster, while willing everything he was getting from John to reflect back through it.
She doesn't manage much more than an introduction before Father pulls the front door open and says they have to run. They won't actually have to run, of course, but they may have to make quick time if they're walking with Doctor Watson and Emily, neither of whom are anywhere near as fast as Father.
"Do you even hear yourself?" John asked incredulously, rounding on him. "This is a kids' Nativity pageant. All other issues aside, how do you imagine those kids felt when they saw something like that printed about them in a newspaper for all their mates to see?"
Sherlock didn't say anything when John unbuttoned Sherlock's shirt with blind fingers and slid it off his shoulders. He didn't say anything when John's hands found their way to his flies and opened them (although he may have had to stifle an unbecoming moan when John inadvertently brushed his cock through his pants). They worked together to get Sherlock's trousers and pants off, John peppering Sherlock's stomach and chest with kisses when he bent over, and again on the way back up. John started to take off his own clothes, but Sherlock had had enough of the parallel play and anyway he was getting impatient, so he knelt down and dealt with John's jeans and underwear while John did the same with his shirt.
Tristram makes a 'yes' sound and braces himself. He still can't help flinching when Doctor Watson slides his hand under Tristram's and gently lifts it so he can press some absorbent material onto it. He then wraps a long strip of some more material around it until it feels packed up and tight.
"I think if we get arrested for trespassing tonight, you can forget about your plans for Moran."
"I believe the headline was, 'Jesus, Mary and Joseph' and it went on from 'calamity' through 'abysmal' to 'appalling'."
in London houses collections which are "a fascinating mix of human and animal anatomy and pathology specimens, wax teaching models, surgical and dental instruments as well as paintings, drawings and sculpture." (
Lestrade screwed up his face. "You think he's going to whack someone with his cane? Not that you wouldn't deserve it," he muttered, then looked at the cane more sharply. "Hold on, why do you have his cane? Sherlock, you can't nick a man's cane."
Tristram hears the unspoken remainder of that thought quite clearly: or it could be something else. Something that makes even Father uneasy.
He worked for several minutes in silence even as I became more frequently vocal, hissing and panting my responses to his ministrations. He sometimes paused for quite some time to allow a goodly amount of wax to gather in the concave top of the candle. This might then be spilled in a single splash on my stomach that seared like a direct hit from a geyser of lava, or distributed in several smaller doses describing a molten figure across my pectoral. The barrage on my senses became almost overwhelming, and I lost all sense of time and proportion.
Sherlock smiled too and wished they were alone. Later.
Emily scoots forward on the bed, as if by coming closer she'll be able to understand Tristram better. "Is she going to come live with you?"
John held Sherlock's hips in place and slid in and out over and over, not reaching his prostate every time, but often enough to keep Sherlock's pleasure level at an ever-increasing buzz. Sherlock was so focused on his internal signals, on maintaining his balance and giving John room to manoeuvre, and on the fascinating flex of John's abdominal muscles with every thrust and withdrawal, that he completely failed to notice the effect their activities were having on John.
"I got the dates mixed up," he said lightly.
A sad-sounding trombone swoop comes from the computer and a message appears on the screen: 'Mirror, mirror on the wall, who's the smartest of them all?'
not available right now sorry. will ring later
"Are you okay?"
"Sherlock's working on it," John promises.
"For what?" Sherlock says distractedly.
"Do you trust me, Watson?"
"I thought it was cute."
"Good. Me either. Or, well... in retrospect, I suppose. About last time. If I'd known what it feels like to be this sure about something, I never would have gone through with it back then."
Sherlock lifts the covers and slides into the warmth beside John. John doesn't react until Sherlock turns onto his side and draws his knees up, brushing against John's leg. Then he stirs and makes a sleepy questioning sound.
Tristram knows his father means any new injuries, not his hand or his back, so he answers, "No." Being able to answer Father's simple questions promptly and accurately makes Tristram feel a bit better. A little more in control.
"Oh, God!" John chuckled. "I can't believe we're getting away with this."
Message: Rev ordered tea n cake. Choc I think.
"That has nothing to do with it," Sherlock retorts, still testy.
Sherlock stopped at the teachers' lounge to get his coat and scarf.
Everyone, indeed, was waiting for them. The entire school was turned out, the children sitting in rows on the ground and the teachers arrayed around the sides of the room. More alarming, however, was the phalanx of press reps and minor civic officials standing at the back of the room holding microphones, cameras, notebooks and tablet computers.
"You don't have to, really, that was pretty exciting already, to tell you the truth."
Sherlock taps Enter.
"That's only one," Father scoffs. "You're using it the same way each time. Unimaginative. I've come up with six so far." He swivels to aim the fork at one of the other tables.
"Sherlock-"
"Ah yeah, that's it," John encouraged her, reaching down to move her hair out of the way.
"You keep saying that, but I still don't see-"
Sherlock's eyes flash his own displeasure at John's imbecilic, self-indulgent rant. "You are not a failure," he says, every word bearing witness to its truth. "You have never failed me, John. You did not fail Gloria. You must know that. You gave her a lifetime's worth of love in those five hours. And I'm certain Mary would say you didn't fail her either. You have never failed to give anything but your best."
Sherlock takes a sudden breath, as if the sound of John's voice has pulled him back from somewhere far away. He swallows twice, loud enough to be heard. Then he says, his voice tight with the effort of remaining steady, "I miss my son."
"Typical Holmes," Nigel Anderson's sarcastic voice sounded from somewhere off to the side. It wasn't directed at him, exactly, but no one else was making a sound, so it was obvious he was meant to hear it. "Fobbing off all the real work when it comes down to it."
Sherlock unfolded his legs and stepped off the bed. "Yet John has chosen you as his companion," he said coolly.
"I thought you hadn't seen this before?"
"Which is exactly why I should go with you." John pulls on his jacket and joins Sherlock at the door.
"I only mean, you could just as well stay with your aunts, and I could stay with Mrs Hudson," Tristram tries to explain.
"All right, let's have the story then," John said once a bowl of square, puffy crackers, two glasses, and two bottles of sparkling water (direct import from Ethiopia, according to the label) were set between them.
John had thought about this as a possibility. Of course he had. He was braver than Sherlock. Sherlock had never let himself imagine anything beyond keeping John in his life. His blogger. His partner. His friend. His north.
And even with all this, it still isn't about him at all, but Sherlock. Magnussen needs to have John under his thumb in order to control Sherlock. Which John isn't at all certain is a profitable line to pursue at this point, not any more than having Mary in his pocket has any influence on John right now. On the other hand, Sherlock's come all this way to stop John from providing Magnussen with blackmail material on him, so maybe there is something to it.
Tristram takes a deep breath, trying to shake off the emotions crowding in on him. "No, I can do it," he says, picking up a stray sock from the floor as proof.
"I know he said yes, Mycroft," Father says testily as he snaps the case shut. "You're not going to get any declarations out of me, or whatever it is you're fishing for."
John's heart squeezed with fondness. Affection. More. "Come here, I'll turn the light on and have a look."
John turns his head enough to find Sherlock's lips. "I know, yeah, me too. God, so much. So much," he repeats almost inaudibly.
True, but not the point. The point was that they
Lunch served well as a distraction. It developed that the pub used to belong to Molly's parents, and when her father died, the cousin -- Jeremy, a dour, bald man around John's age with the physique of a person who enjoyed their own cooking -- had taken it over. What he lacked in good humour he made up for in the kitchen. The food samplings presented were hearty and wholesome yet fresh and inventive, without being fussy or exotic. Things like butternut squash and sage soup with rosemary foccacia, wild mushroom and garlic puff pastry tarts, game sausages with caramelised red onion gravy, breast of chicken stuffed with porcini mushrooms. And as the reception would start with a tea service as well, stilton and poppy seed butter biscuits, raspberry shortbread, mini Victoria sponges and lavender meringue with lemon and vanilla cream.
"Women."
Sherlock took it. "Hello." Pointless to give his name; the man knew who he was.
At the same time, there were times when she wanted and enjoyed companionship and intimacy, which was why John was perfect. He was fun and spontaneous, he made her feel sexy and clever, and he had his own home that he was perfectly happy to retreat to, even at 2 AM. Most of all, though, he never asked more of her than she was willing to give. She supposed they had a sort of friends-with-benefits understanding. Maybe he'd explained that to Sherlock, too, or more likely the man had picked up on it himself, because he'd only intentionally ruined two more of their dates following the Chinese circus fiasco (the interruptions for genuinely urgent police matters didn't count) before he'd apparently accepted that Sarah wasn't any real competition for Sherlock's central place in John's life.
John catches Sherlock's eye and his face does the most glorious thing, everything lifting and curving upward, and then he's giggling. Sherlock takes a snapshot of his face and carefully folds it into one of the empty spaces he's been left with, the ones that not even cases and cocaine can eradicate or fill. He wants to put his hands on that face and hold it just like that, put his own face against it and feel the lines and curves, the bumps and ridges, against his cheek, his chin, his mouth. Imagining it makes him feel light, and Sherlock can't help joining in with John's chuckles, which quickly turn into a full-bodied laugh.
"Oh, that's just... No," John says. "Sherly maybe," he offers straight-faced.
In an oven -safe dish, place in the whole mix of vegetables with lentils into the bottom of the pan and spread out evenly. Add the mashed potatoes on top and smooth out over top with the back of the spoon. Sprinkle the top with dried paprika, and poke through with a fork to make vents in the mashed potatoes.
John didn't say anything the entire time. Not when Sherlock rubbed and pinched his nipples to pin-sharp points. Not when Sherlock reached between them and weighed his testicles in his hand, rolling them between his fingers. Not even when he licked his hand and wrapped it around John's cock. Of course, the fact that Sherlock didn't remove his mouth from John's the entire time might have been a factor. It wasn't until the end, when John jerked and gasped and let loose with a string of 'Oh fuck, oh fuck, oh fuck's and ejaculated hot and thick into the crease of Sherlock's thigh that the silence was broken.
"I wanted you to move in here," Sherlock said into the hollow between his hands.
Even with the lights low, Sherlock felt safest like this, with John on all fours, his head resting on his forearms and his arse swinging in the air for Sherlock to take. He liked the dichotomy of the resistance John's rectal muscles still put up, even after all these weeks, coupled with the smooth slide. John his for the taking. Physically, but emotionally as well. It was a submission of a sort, although John would probably call it a compromise too. He - John - had been opposed at first, citing hygienic as well as medical concerns, but look how well he took to it now. Taking Sherlock's cock, the first kiss of glans to anus, sucking it in, caressing and squeezing, drawing him in deeper, accomodating every centimetre of him the way John accomodated all of Sherlock's quirks, faults, and foibles in the rest of their lives. Accepting him, holding him in, as if he were loath to let him go. He couldn't ever have all of Sherlock, of course, not really, in the same way that Sherlock could never have all of John, could never have even a fraction, it seemed, of what he wanted, but this was also a compromise. A satisfactory one, for the moment at least.
Father joins in, his nostrils flaring and his eyebrows rising. Tristram feels something putting pressure on his good hand, and when he looks down, he sees Father's hand gripping his. Tristram grips back as hard as he can. Behind them, Emily takes a deep breath too, albeit shakily. Tristram finds himself inhaling along with them, although he can't keep going nearly as long.
"Call in sick for yourself and your daughter," Sherlock says as if speaking to a very small child. "It's not difficult to figure out."
"I didn't know!" Tristram almost wails. There's a treacherous tightness in his throat that he tries to swallow past.
Jade beckoned her classmates closer, then confided in a stage whisper, "My brother saw Mr Watson and Mr Holmes last night, and they were kissing!"
"Hello, Mary," said he, his voice brisk or even forced, as if he were performing a duty he shied away from but found necessary. "I have Holmes with me. He has no excuse for not coming earlier but has agreed to come today as a favour to me. So you see, he has made progress, at least." He huffed a bit as if the last were intended as a joke, although I did not see the humour nor understand what he meant by 'progress', unless it referenced the journey from Marylebone to Highgate. The first part of his statement was nevertheless true, if uncouth to articulate. At any rate, Mary Watson was not here to listen to a litany of my social shortcomings. It began to dawn on me that hers were perhaps not the intended ears for Watson's speech, which he continued thus:
&&&&&&
Tristram knows that rule already, because Father told it to him when they were at Grandmother's: he's not to open a closed door without permission unless it's an emergency. A nightmare, even a bad one, doesn't qualify as an emergency. At least not for Father. But Doctor Watson apparently has a different perspective. Tristram also knows why they have the rule. Father and Doctor Watson want privacy so they can kiss and hug, and maybe look at each other like they did in that last picture.
He makes his way across the grass and cautiously opens the door. It's too dark inside for him to see much of anything, other than the dull grey squares of the small windows set into the walls, and for that reason it's the smell hits him first: cigarette smoke. It's somehow darker and sweeter than the acrid stuff his father smokes, but there's no mistaking it. He feels a little jolt of triumph, but doesn't have long to pat himself on the back, because a deep voice speaks out of the dimness further inside:
The doorbell rang.
John doesn't even wait for Sherlock to pull his chair in before he speaks. "I wondered if you were ever going to talk to me or if you were just going to spend the rest of your life following me around."
"I sent you a text over a week ago! You never responded so I assumed it was all right."
Sherlock laughs. "You don't consider - other than the window washers, of course, and those will be handpicked and scheduled for a time when no one's in the building anyway - that someone might try and get at you from the outside. Don't consider lines of sight, bulletproof glass, that sort of thing."
Sherlock, wary lest Angelo do something even worse like summon a musician to serenade them, rushed through the report of how Gladstone's nose had led to Sherlock discovering a fire that had been set in the rear service entrance. He'd caught it before too much damage was done, and found evidence which the arson investigators overlooked that led directly to Angelo's ex-partner.
Lestrade's face morphed into an uncertain smile. "Thank you?"
First things first. As John would now be alert to any remote logins to his bank account and Sherlock wouldn't be able to get in touch with anyone from Clarenden before Monday, he sent a text to Wiggins asking him to task someone with chatting up some of the tenants in John's building and getting the rent figures from them. That would hopefully be sorted within 24 hours.
"You swear you're going to tell me everything." It might have been intended to sound like a threat, but there's not much steam behind it.
That was not at all what he had expected when Lestrade had texted, asking Sherlock to meet him at the pub near New Scotland Yard after work. Specifically requesting he come alone. To be honest, Sherlock had thought the detective was going to talk to him about John. He'd been prepared for an awkward and painful conversation about the stages of grief and emotions and being a good friend. And he'd been willing to go through with it, for John's sake. Because it was clear that John still wasn't happy, even after all this time. It had been nearly a year. Fifteen months since the mess with Magnussen. Sherlock had done all he knew how to, taking as many cases as he could, even boring ones, when there was any sort of prospect of danger or thrills. When was he going to get the old John back?
This is set sometime in the (not so?) distant future and references a moment from chapter 16 of the main fic.
"Good night, John."
John points at him again. "Shut up. Shut your gob." He leans over, snatches up his pants from the floor and tugs them on.
"Where are you going?" Emily asks. Her voice is also tight, but with unhappiness.
Mycroft set aside the weekly surveillance summary from Baker Street. No news was good news, he supposed. Outside cameras only now, so he had to extrapolate, but there didn't appear to be any unusual or threatening incidents. It hadn't done any good to argue that the alley behind the flat was off the grid, nor that the child was a more than obvious target. John Watson had refused point blank to move back in without assurances that there would be neither eyes nor ears anywhere inside the building that didn't belong to living creatures, and of those, only ones that were expressly invited in.
And then Sherlock rolls toward John, and John lets go of Sherlock's hand to sling his arm around his back, and their mouths find each other. There is a salty taste that neither of them mentions.
"It's just what you do. Look, I'll start," he said, as an idea came to him. It was a classic he'd heard many times as a kid, but with a bit of a twist. "So," he said, turning onto his side and propping his head up on his hand, "there was this fellow who just moved in with his new flatmate. The flatmate's kind of an oddball but the rent's manageable and the location's perfect. Plus, the guy's just back from overseas and the flat comes furnished so he can move in right away. You with me?"
There's his soil experiment, for one, which he hasn't done any work on all week; mostly, though, he wants to read on in
"Good morning, Doctor Watson," he replies politely.
John appeared to be having a similar difficulty. He was looking around at the passersby, with his hands buried in his pockets.
to produce such a thing?"
The non-sequitor caused Sherlock's eyes to fly up to John's. A mistake. A set of muscles in his chest contracted at the sight. John's eyes widened slightly and he inhaled, short and abrupt, signalling that he was experiencing a similar reaction. Oh, this wasn't over at all.
When I opened the door that morning, then, it was as if I were seeing a ghost, and I had to take several moments to be sure the apparition was not in fact a manifestation of my own imagination. Watson stared back at me, clearly as startled as I at the sudden confrontation, although he, at least, must have been prepared to see me on the other side of the door.
"Good, Watson. And now the other side."
John's face broke into a wide smile. "Great."
She was still throbbing and catching her breath when John grabbed her by the hips and rolled her onto her back, dislodging himself in the process, then scrambled to get on top of her. She spread her legs wide and lifted her hips to help, and then he was inside again, pumping into her with short, barely controlled jerks, supporting himself on his good elbow.
