“Why do you think we’re the enemy?” Sam asked rationally, jabbing me in the side in an effort to shut me up.
“The other day I asked around to see what Moonchild’s deal was. People say she comes in just after nine thirty – like clockwork – down at the gas station in Newhalem.” Sam said tentatively. “We could head there after this?”
By this time Sam and Dean were striding up like they belong there, tipping hats and being none-too-shy about flashing their badges on their chests.
“Argh!” she wailed, staggering back. The toe of her boot caught me in the ribs. Despite being in pain, I only clamped down tighter.
She let out a flirtatious laugh before clarifying, “I mean, what breed?”
“I care about you. A lot, but-…”
“Dean!”
"No one cries for a douche bag."
A shiver of cold fear shuddered through my chest making my hand tremble slightly. I let out the breath I didn’t know I’d been holding in one quick gust and dropped the gun to my side. I looked away in shame and embarrassment.
“Yeah, I’m not buying that,” he cut in. “Dean, you can’t keep telling me that you’re fine when you’re very obviously not. First you were catatonic, then angry and drunk, and now you’re-you’re a
He was breathing but there was a large gash above his brow. Fisting his jacket in my hand, I looked around for what could have attacked. Jostling my brother slightly when I saw nothing but darkness, I asked, “Sam, where’s Cas?”
Again, he struggled with telling me what happened. But I waited. Even though I needed to know what went down, the last thing I wanted to do was pressure him.
I couldn’t speak much after that. And Sam didn’t pry. He just held me until I could once again breathe properly. Wiping at the snot dripping out of my nose with the back of my hand as I sat up, I chuckled mirthlessly, “Now that we got control over our lives…I can’t seem to turn off the waterworks.”
"Isadora?" I asked, catching Sam's attention.
Turning back to Joel I said, “Take us where you took Sam.”
“The collar looks like the others,” Castiel noted.
His brother could do anything. He’d seen him hogtie a man twice his size. And make six bullets feel like twenty.
“Feel free to radio in if you think of anything that might help us.” Sam told her earnestly. "And thanks again."
Cas’ eyes flew open at the noise and fell on me. His wings faded and so did the power I’d felt.
The last bit of information really seemed to affect Floyd. His eyes grew glassy as he became lost in his own thoughts for a moment. It afforded me the time to run through a shortened list of monsters in my own head; from ghosts to genies and beyond. There were still too many variables.
Ever since coming back from The Empty, Castiel had wondered about Dean. After the older Winchester embraced him and brought him back to the bunker, they’d gone out on hunts together just as they had before. Dean acted just like he usually did, perhaps too much so. But it was the small things that Castiel noticed as off. Dean seemed like he was holding back under all the bravado. Whenever Castiel touched him, Dean would pull away as soon as he could. Whenever they spoke, Dean wouldn’t quite meet his eyes. And so on.
The sun was bright and warm. I held up my hand to block my eyes and blinked in astonishment. It looked like it did when I’d been a much younger man. That was when I realized that all my aches and pains were gone. I started and looked down at myself. Back wearing clothes that I hadn’t seen in thirty years.
As Dean (who had looped back to loiter outside the border house awkwardly) stepped into the room. He too froze in horror. The sight was something that he had never seen personally, but had heard plenty about. It was exactly what John Winchester had described to him over and over again growing up. Nearly identical to what happened to Mary Winchester. All Dean could think about as he gaped in shock, was that this was what their Pa said Mama had looked like pinned to the ceiling of their homestead in Kansas.
“Yeah,” Sam nodded, still not able to look back and meet her gaze. “I’m sure he’s fine.”
Gentle fingers probed the fur covered in blood, pushing it apart to reveal the skin underneath. As she worked, she narrated shakily, “Looks like he’s – he’s got a contusion on the back of his skull with a – a superficial abrasion. This cut above his eye is pretty deep. I’ll have to stitch it up.”
We left him in the Impala’s dust and headed for the closest town. Life sprang back into existence around us. People laughing, talking, going about their days like nothing had happened. The beige dog from before bounded down the street happily. I knelt and let the little guy run into my arms as I thought back to when I’d first seen him.
“Oh gosh!” she exclaimed, getting to her feet as soon as she caught sight of my bloody form in my brother’s arms.
The eye without blood in it fluttered open. I was close to the ground. Everything around me looked twice as big as it had minutes ago. Confused, I struggled to look down at my body. My clothes lay draped over my shoulders, looking as big as a blanket. Despite still feeling like there was pins and needles under my skin I wriggled free. What I saw had me whining pitifully all over again. Fur. The same color as my hair covered my entire body. Well, if I could even say it was my body anymore.
"No Dean," he said stubbornly. "You're as pale as a ghost. Something happened."
care of you.”
My mouth dropped open as I asked in disbelief, “Sammy?”
“Sam! Sammy!” Dean hollered, grabbing his little brother by the scruff of the neck and hauling him away from the nightmare in front of them.
“Nothing Sammy,” I grumbled tiredly, looking up at him.
“Let’s go back to the Reflector Bar, get some grub, and do some research.” I said, settling once again behind the handle bars of the four-wheeler.
"Missing people goes on like that with one every decade. Usually lowlifes. Until we get to two weeks ago when three workers from the local construction site go missing one after the other.” Sam jumped in shaking his head.
“We’re not done yet,” I hollered, practically skipping. “Get in the car you two.”
The lines of the angel’s face hardened again as he met my gaze. He wanted to protect my brother, I could tell, but I could also see that he didn’t understand how to do that. After a moment he finally said, “He allowed me access to his memories. I saw all that happened with you and Dean in Diablo.”
, I thought to myself. “Cas is waiting outside. Figured we can come up with a plan and then roll out.”
Dean tilted his head down enough that Sam couldn’t fully see his facial expression as he countered, “What was he supposed to do?”
I really enjoy when Dean is an Omega. I like the juxtaposition. Anyway, thanks to all that commented and left kudos! I appreciate seeing each notification!!!
When Sam looks across the room to me, I see something in his eyes that I wasn’t expecting in that moment. Apology. Sheepishly, he puts his arms around Eileen’s shoulders and pulls her in to his side as other hunters step up to welcome her. My mouth drops open when I realize why.
“You’re staying right here ‘till you tell me what I want to know.” The Sherriff growled, his nose almost brushing Dean’s. The man took in a long whiff of Dean’s scent. “If I’m not mistaken, your heat is comin’…I’ll get what I want from you then.”
“But there’s no way –”
“Ah, yeah…sorry for the late response, you know how regulations go.”
“What? Card not working?”
She paused long and hard. It was unusual since she was normally such a chatter box. Finally, she said, “Got a monster ain’t never been seen before. No one I’ve asked is willin’ to help. You’re the only one I got left.”
Anyway, love you all! Stay happy! And see you next time! <3
“Nah, I don’t think there’s much more we could learn from them. It’s probably worth it to check out Jacob’s house though since he was the last to go missing. You want me to pick you up and we can head over?”
“I dunno…according to this Tikbalangs are more mischievous than malicious. Some even say they’re guardians of the forest. Not only that, but why would there be one here in the Pacific Northwest?”
“Makes my Pa disappointed, that does.” Dean laughed. A small drop of sweat rolled down his temple. Trying to change the subject, he cleared his throat, nodded to the dead horse and asked, “You have another one like this, right? ‘Bout a month ago?”
The touch of his brother’s solid hand was enough to get the rest of Sam’s mind clear.
“At least let me take you to Helena. She’ll know what to do.” He argued.
The younger Winchester watched Dean struggle into his saddle, concern flashing across his face before he said, “Right…I found out where Joseph Welch lives and went to talk to him while you were
My body tensed at the sound. Cas was not one to sound upset under any circumstances; now he did. An indescribable urge to turn back nearly overcame me. Fuck, I
“You have no idea how glad I am to see you.” I muttered.
I ran a hand through my hair in an effort to calm down, casting my eyes around the room at anything and everything. Why did I drink so damn much? After a moment of silence, Cas slid closer across the linoleum. I fought the urge to back up, and instead turned to face him.
Careful not to move too quickly, I slipped into the room and padded over to Ivan. Setting the gun on the ground next to his hand, I glanced at the druid before turning back to him. I couldn’t tell if he was breathing, his chest looked still. Worry settled in my gut. Instinct took over and I started licking him on the face.
As the girls smile at each other, Donna steps up, winks at me and nods, “For family.”
Castiel nodded in understanding, doing a good job of hiding his disappointment. Then, he stood and made his way over to the door. Dean’s gut clenched as he asked, “Where’re you going?”
Another blink and the creature had gone in a pale blur. Cas’ body slumped to the ground. I followed after, sliding in next to his side and cradling his lolling head between my hands. Shaking all over I struggled to put pressure on his wound; pointless 'cause he was already gone. I started muttering words of encouragement and comfort to him, but as the seconds ticked resoundingly by, I realized that the silhouette of his wings had been singed into the ground where he'd landed.
I was a dog.
I thanked them for their help, gave the card with mine and Sam’s numbers on it, and let them know I would notify them of any developments. Understandably, it wasn’t a warm goodbye.
Sam would never say that his brother was a worrier – stubborn maybe – but not one to fret. So, to see the faint trace of thinly veiled fear in his eyes came as a bit of a surprise. Still it wasn’t enough to sway him. Not when it was all too much trouble. John and Dean Winchester were bad news. Rubbing at the stubble on his jaw, Sam found that he still couldn’t tell his brother to get back on his horse and leave, despite knowing he should.
“I recommend taking time to get used to your new body.” Castiel called from the other side of the table.
“Okay,” Sam said, glancing between the pair of us. “Dean and I will go to the morgue and do the interviews. Let us know if you need us.”
Sam shook his head in disbelief, “He was supposed to go with me, or tell me there was nothing to be afraid of! I was seven, Dean.”
“You seriously don’t expect us to sit by and watch you go in there by yourself.” Claire scoffed, shooting to her feet. Kaia followed her, curling her fingers into the back of her shirt.
There he was, standing over my shoulder, looking down at me like I was nothing more than a little boy dressing up as a hunter. It was an uncanny resemblance with my old man. His face darkened as his hand convulsed in my direction. For the split second I remained still, I saw it transform from a human hand into one that would be more fitting to a Tikbalang; unnaturally long, spindly, pale fingers that ended in sharp claw-like points. When he gestured to where I lay, black tipped spines shot out like a bullet. Same as the one that skewered Sam in the fire watch tower. The ends thudded into the ground next to me, narrowly missing my head.
” Castiel commanded.
“She’s not in trouble, is she?”
“Ngh…Cas…” the Winchester whispered; voice tight and strained.
They had to go. Dean knew the law would be on them soon. Someone would figure out one of these people was missing. Not to mention there was the bastard responsible for this massacre. He was out there. And he knew who Sam was, where to find him, and how to make him hurt.
Clearing his throat and blinking away the tears in his eyes he said thickly, “So yeah, she kept going on about hearing stuff. Scared us all yesterday when she said she saw someone hiding out in the trees…should have listened to her.”
“Go talk to him asshole,” I muttered to myself as I angrily unhooked the gas pump. “Don’t be a shitty big brother. Make sure he’s okay.”
With a mild look of betrayal frozen on his face, I patted him on the shoulder jauntily and headed over to the Impala before he could argue. Of course, not before catching his call of, "Jerk!"
“You can keep it with you. I’m sure you’ll get some use out of it while you’re off trying to figure out what the hell is going on. Over.” He finished, the radio falling silent.
“Well that’s - that’s true, but we’re not-” Sam started, holding his hands up in surrender.
I took Miracle Jr., packed up the Impala and headed for Sioux Falls. Jody and I worked with Donna and fixed up Bobby’s house. Jody retired pretty soon after that and partnered up with me on an auto repair operation out of the junkyard.
Looking up from tightening a strap, Sam skimmed over the heading of the clipping from the ‘Jericho Herald’ that read: Centennial Railway Disappearances. Dated two months prior on September 19
After a quick pit stop at the campgrounds we dropped off the four-wheeler and grabbed Sam’s computer (where I hurriedly explained what I'd heard and smelled). The dinner crowd was just starting to clear out, leaving us with a cozy booth in a back corner. Gratefully, I settled in and propped my leg up on the chair. Sam ordered a salmon pilaf thing and I got their “special” the Rocky Mountain bleu cheese burger. Our beers and an icepack came out first. I took a grateful gulp and folded the ice around my tender ankle before settling in to read.
“You’re not upset?” he asked surprised.
Clearing my throat, I downed the last of my whiskey and said, “C’mon Cas…lighten up.”
Making a half-hearted attempt at a smile I got to my feet, stood tall, cleared my throat, and said, “We’re getting him back.”
Licking his lips, he stripped out of his coat and fell back onto his blankets. He finally allowed himself to give in. Curling onto his side away from the light of the fire, his hands shook as he undid his belt and struggled his pants down along his hips and thighs. As soon as his fingers made contact with the bare flesh there, a tingling started at the base of his skull and moved down his spine. It settled in his already straining groin. Whimpering, he curled his palm around the already weeping head of his penis. It pulsed painfully. Letting out a shaking sigh, he began stroking himself.
Pulling out my FBI badge, I flashed it and countered, “I’m not the police.”
“I don’t know how to explain.” I settled on truth. “What happened in Diablo really fucked with me, and now I can’t stop thinking about what the monster said.”
The soft vibration of her voice combined with the feel of her hot breath on his skin sent a tingle down his spine. It settled low in his groin, making it twitch with excitement. He recalled the last time her lips had brushed his skin and desire caused him to suck in a sharp breath. Not bothering to hide the huge grin on his face, he nodded emphatically.
We're winding down the pilot episode. Next chapter will have some sexual assault in it at the beginning. I'll put up trigger warnings. Would a visual representation of where to skip to be helpful? Let me know.
A crunching, squelching sound followed by a heavy shuddering thud came from nearby. Dead Sam was suddenly gone. Dad and Adam disappeared. The heady smell of tobacco began to dissipate. I hadn’t even registered how strong it was.
Letting the door of the Impala shut with a loud creak, I took off at a jog toward the front of the large theater. Only one person stood outside, a young man with brown curls, thick glasses, and a look of fear barely restrained on his face. My gut clenched as I made a beeline for him.
“Well, the dam is of course on the western side of the lake. The work has mostly been on the northwestern corner of the wall. They headed north. And as far as where they might have gone once they got in the woods…there are too many different possibilities. The most likely would be the Sourdough Mountain Trail though. The beginning is easy to follow, but once it gets into the thick of it, if you don’t know what to look for, it’s easy to get lost. Other than that, they might have gotten deep enough to be anywhere between Mt. Terror and Ross Lake, and anywhere as far north as Mt. Prophet by now.”
“Seriously man, what happened last night?”
Feeling bad about my outburst, I ran my fingertips along the edge of the poster board sign and moved to stand in front of her as she sat heavily on her box. Setting her sign down next to her I asked, “You’re here almost every day, right? Can you tell me about anything unusual you’ve noticed?”
Another Illustration for the story! I'm trying not to procrastinate editing the next chapter...but I totally am, I'm sorry! ;p
He moved away from his brother and slid a protective arm around Jessica’s narrow shoulders, silently stating that they were together. It was a dominance play. Sam knew that. Dean knew that. Jessica knew that. Dean had most likely presented as Beta since Sam left which meant that legally he could order Jessica into submission if he really wanted. Sam would never let that happen, not while he was still able to resist the natural laws of Alpha, Beta, and Omega.
“I don’t.”
“She’s…passionate, but seems harmless. The most she’s done so far is talk someone’s ear off.”
“Or not,” Dean choked out. “Get off me.”
I chewed the inside of my cheek, struggling with one half of me calling for blood and the other half wanting to walk away like I did last night. I ended up sitting there, fuming quietly and glaring off into the woods. It wasn't like I didn't talk to him. I'd gotten a lot better over the years. All the traveling together kind of forced me to. But there were still some topics that I just couldn't go near.
Glancing over at Ivan sitting stiffly a few feet away I nodded and replied, “It’s what we do.”
“You’re up early,” Sam commented dryly as he emerged from his tent.
Sam couldn’t tear his eyes away.
” it asked sarcastically, with a tinge of the disappointment Dad always sprinkled on everything he said. “
I barked softly once, a sad whine coming from my throat.
needs to look after you
Railroad logic. It nearly made me laugh out loud it was so familiar; welcome. But it ended up turning into a sort of strained, mirthless chuckle. It reminded me that I hadn’t slept in over 38 hours. Running a hand over my worn face I muttered, “Yeah…yeah I guess I do.”
Miracle sprang up from the floor and settled in quickly against my side. I closed my eyes and smiled.
“No.”
“Are you alright, Dean?” the angel asked, his deep gravelly voice laced with concern.
Gingerly taking her seat she asked with a slight tremble in her voice, “What can I do for the FBI?”
I was shaking my head in denial. I didn’t like this. But that didn’t mean it wasn’t true. Looking at the kid, I felt my throat constrict. He wasn’t just Jack anymore. He was everything.
Castiel swung up into his saddle, still not commenting.
(See the end of the chapter for
Glaring over at her I said, “You don’t know us, okay. You don’t know what we care about.”
But that was it. Some days I didn’t even feel close to human anymore. I was detached. Everyone that had gotten close to me had thought that at some point. Even Sam. I looked up at a loss into Castiel’s worry filled eyes, silently telling him that I was sorry I’d gotten him in this situation; one that I always seemed to get him into. As we stared at each other, I saw that he didn’t blame me. He never had. And he never would. My breathing came out fast as my heart rate picked up. No matter what he’d always believed in the good in me, unconditionally. Hell, he spurned heaven for me. But still I couldn’t speak.
“Dean…you’re drunk –”
“It’s fine,” I muttered, shaking my head as he tried to bend down and inspect my ankle. “We need to find Sam.”
“What is it Driscoll?” the Sherriff asked, his energy flaring again, this time in annoyance and concern.
Still with that wounded expression on his face Sam muttered, “Sounds a lot like you.”
Feeling powerful and in control, the woman – still gyrating on top of Dean – bent down enough so she could whisper in his ear, “Don’t worry darlin’, we’ll take
. Out of all the other Pinkertons Cas worked alongside, Zachariah was the one that gave him the most unease. Not that Zacharia’s Alpha power was much stronger than Castiel’s own. He just didn’t trust the older Alpha.
His attention was making me feel claustrophobic. But it still didn’t stop his words from making me feel…important. Something I wasn’t used to having outside of Sammy. Maybe it was the drink, or the fact that I’d just gone through my own personal hell. Maybe a little of both, but I suddenly felt the walls that I’d worked so hard to hold up all day crumbling down. Letting out a shaky breath, I ran my ands through my hair and allowed my eyes to fill with tears. Looking even more worried, Cas dragged his chair closer and pressed his palm firmly onto my shoulder like he always did. I leant into the familiar strength his silent touch offered me.
She didn’t even bother scenting him, or commenting on the fact that he was being improper by not giving her his full name. She seemed dazed. Noticing this, another young woman strode over protectively and growled at Sam. Trying not to anger her he made his neck even more accessible and said, “I was hoping you wouldn’t mind me asking a couple questions.”
“That’s not true.”
It wasn’t hard at all finding the man’s house. There was a small row of houses set back from the main road that made up Diablo. All were small one stories, nearly identical to each other aside from the personalized decorations. I went to a house on the lane that looked to be well taken care of, with a rustic display of antique wagon wheels and simplistic landscaping. I knocked solidly on the front door, adjusting my tie as I waited.
His face remained blank, but he gave me a tiny nod. I didn’t think much about it. My head was too full of Sam back at the morgue getting stitched up. We needed to find a spell to reverse whatever was done to him. And if we couldn’t find one, then we needed the druid alive. Which was never a good idea. Or easy.
“Fuck!” Dean groaned through clenched teeth, the darkness behind his eyelids lighting up with colors.
It was almost exactly what I’d told Helena less than twenty-four hours ago. Shooting the feisty blonde an approving smile I nodded and said, “Right, well, if anything comes up just call.”
Clutching my side, I started for the kitchen and asked, “Got anything stronger than beer?”
A sense of calm came over Dean at that point. He watched Cas work quietly, appreciating the line of his lean muscles under his white button up. Once the fallen angel was situated on his back under the covers, looking up at Dean with questioning eyes, the hunter finally moved. Gingerly, he lowered himself into bed.
“Of course.” Sam said, stepping aside as Isadora brushed past him, clipping shoulders as she did. I noticed her trembling hand covering her mouth like she was thinking of being sick.
The pair peered at the papers for a while, trying to figure out what the random murders meant. She was killing indiscriminately.
He gave me a look as though he were about to ask how on earth knowing that they were college spring breakers could matter when it came to being attacked in the middle of the woods, but stopped himself from saying it out loud, probably thinking it was better not to know.
I was utterly speechless. The monster was dead. Cas was still alive. Of course. Only an angel blade or something more powerful could have killed him. When I didn't answer, Sam's brows scrunched together as he knelt at my level and asked seriously, "What happened?"
“Avec cette vie, tha mi ag iarraidh fear eile a shàbhaladh.” Gertie chanted.
At first Sam couldn’t locate his brother and for one second he wondered if he’d been left behind. But then he heard Dean’s soft voice muttering kind words to Baby from inside the stables. As Sam entered, he noticed his brother’s hand immediately go to his side. His fingers danced over the pistol at his hip, only to freeze when he recognized who entered. Flashing him a grin, Dean smoothly transitioned into hooking his thumb in his belt.
That thought was abandoned however, when he stubbornly kept me pressed against him. It was like he was silently telling me that nothing that happened or was said out there mattered. He was here with me now and he wouldn’t choose otherwise. Even though I still didn’t fully trust that it was right, I allowed it. Slowly, tentatively, I closed my eyes and curled my fingers into his coat.
Castiel’s whole body stiffened as a familiar warmth spread throughout his body. He’d felt it before over the years, and each time he didn’t know what to do with it. This special…bond with Dean had been there since the beginning. Sam had never elicited anything like this from him. Which only further complicated the urges he was certain Dean would find unwelcome.
“No,” I smiled, hopping down from the table. “We’re going to go annoy the crap out of it.”
"Dean?!" Sam called over the roar of his four-wheeler.
Avoiding looking into his soulful blue eyes, I looked away and focused on the faded door to the motel room. That was when I noticed I was no longer wearing the same clothing I’d had on the night before.
Of course, I didn’t get an answer. Sam remained unconscious. I got to my feet and hollered, “Cas?!”
“Pa figured it out.” Sam breathed.
“He’ll show sooner or later once the whiskey doesn’t have a hold of him.”
“Disgusting,” Zachariah commented from behind Cas, wrinkling his nose. “Never liked small towns. Something about them has always struck me as…uncivilized.”
“As a matter of fact,” Joseph answered. “Damn city folk ain’t got no sense if you ask me.”
He gave me that sarcastic Sam look of his that was just as recognizable as a dog as it was as a human before huffing and dashing off once again. Wiping the slobber off on my pants, I took a look at the caller ID. Unfamiliar number with a Louisiana area code. Interesting.
“So, you think Gertie was trying to cure her mom?” I asked, wincing as I sighed too strongly.
“You okay?” Dean asked cautiously, sweat dripping from his brow as he noticed the change in his brother.
“Jack, wait –” Sam started, but suddenly was no longer next to me.
"You're not going to be able to get very far on that." Sam commented, nodding at my ankle which had already ballooned to twice its size.
“Pa was the one who told me to stay gone if I left,” Sam answered, sidling up close to Dean’s horse. “So that’s what I’ve been doing.”
Glancing at me out of the corner of his eye, he said, “I think we’re dealing with a druid, not a witch. A number of families came out of Ireland after the death of Christ and went south.”
"You'd be surprised," she answered. "Inexperienced hikers come out here pretty often thinkin' they can handle the wild without a guide or the proper equipment. More often than not I spend my days trackin' down those who've gone and gotten themselves hurt or lost."
Reaching up, Castiel traced his fingers along Dean’s jaw and muttered, “We’ll go slow.”
I thought about calling out. If that was Carly, one of the missing college students, then I should. But then the unmistakable aroma of tobacco rushed by on another gust of wind. It was faint and dissipated as quickly as it came - not consistent or strong enough to be close. I pressed back into the roots I was leaning against and adjusted my fingers on the grip of my pistol. After a while of waiting it came again. A piteous moan.
A moment of tense silence passed before Cas piped up helpfully, “I removed his hangover.”
I turned and saw Castiel. Sam must have messaged him too. I realized at that moment that I had completely forgotten to keep him in the loop, I was so worried about Sam. I gave him a silent look that said I was sorry. But it seemed he understood.
It didn’t make saying goodbye any easier.
“Why ain’t you mated yet?” she asked, only loud enough for Dean to hear.
“Was he acting peculiar?”
Fires with Dad were cold. Low so the flames weren’t easily seen by anything. Fires with Sam were warm; happy like it was supposed to be. So, I let him have his way with making the grub. I sat back, enjoyed a beer, and attempted flipping through the internet on my phone to look for anything that might help us on the case. A lack of reception smashed that ambition, so I stuffed it back in my pocket and allowed boredom to distract me. I ended up letting my mind wander as I stared into the crackling flames.
“You think I don’t know that?”
“We’ll need to stay somewhere unexpected if we want to continue investigating.” He added.
Throwing a look to Jack out the window, he acknowledged the signal by giving us one last nod and raised his hand. In front of the doors of the garage, inky black bubbled out of nowhere and expanded. The song started up just as the portal opened as wide as the Impala to reveal the expanse of nothing beyond. Led Zeppelin’s Immigrant Song. I could feel the base in my bones as the speakers vibrated with the sound.
Eddie was waiting for us at the trailhead with an extra four-wheeler. I breathed an audible sigh of relief when I realized that we weren’t hiking back to the watchtower. He was just finishing hitching a small trailer to the back of his as we walked up, hands getting slick with black oil. When he caught sight of us, he straightened and gave an awkward wave before motioning to our ride.
“I think we have all the information we need.” Sam said, getting to his feet. “Thank you for…for speaking with us Mr. Waithe.”
Awesomelypathetic commented about triggers and I'm not gonna lie, I'm not sure how to be aware of those. If anyone has any advice or articles I can read, please let me know! I wanna make sure y'all are comfortable!
Everyone knows someone who has experienced tragedy. Some have felt it themselves. But I wasn’t thinking about everyone right now. It’s always bothered me when I’ve gotten sympathies; a lot of empty apologies and platitudes. I’d cringe, recoiling at how disingenuous and forced they seemed. Because I always knew that it wasn’t the end. Not for my family.
Sam woofed satisfactorily.
By now Castiel had detached himself from the others and drifted into the kitchen to listen curiously. I glanced at him before scoffing, “What favor?”
The first shift of bone under my skin popped sickeningly. I drew in a surprised breath. My clavicle made a crunching sound next, like someone tearing the husk off of corn, as it collapsed. I started losing count of the number of sounds I heard. All I could do was shut my eyes and hope it would stop soon.
Sam called over the wind, “We get to Isadora, we find the golden spine, and we throw whatever we can at the Tikbalang to see what sticks.”
I nodded, motioning to him as if to say, ‘
With a snap of his fingers we were transported somewhere else. It took my sluggish mind a moment to catch up, but as soon as I did my eyes widened in horror. I was back in Hell. Watching as my face contorted in terror, he growled, “I’ll show you what it means to be truly afraid.”
He didn’t respond at first – kept gazing out at the dark water. Eventually though, he turned his chin in my direction, and asked, “Do you think he would be…?”
I was just taking another thoughtful sip when I heard one of my other cell phones ringing from my duffle bag up in the guest room. To my surprise, Sam was quick to dash up the stairs in its direction, Maggie following after. I could hear them wrestling with each other briefly before tearing headlong back down the stairs. It was kind of hilarious seeing them acting so carefree. I wondered what they said to her while I was moping to make her embrace her new canine nature so much.
“No.” Dean answered, his breath hot and close enough to the iron bars to make them steam up a little. His heat was close.
“Yup. Stroke.” Bobby answered, popping the top of his drink and taking a long sip. “Not the stupidest way you could have gone, that’s for sure.”
“No thanks,” I said with a smile, looking over at Castiel who had been staring out the window in the direction Dean was as soon as we sat down. “Could we get a couple coffees though?”
Voice still thick with sleep, Sam asked, “Hey Cas, you wanna combine forces for a hunt?”
He turned to give Dean a sly look when he noticed Dean hadn’t even noticed they were in. Sam snagged the back of Dean’s collar and dragged him into the room, shutting them in quickly. Dean tugged himself free, shooting Sam a dirty look before the pair looked around in awe at the collage of newspaper clippings and wanted posters on the wall. It was similar to what Dean had been carrying around in his saddlebag, but greater in scope.
“I – I don’t think I can, S-Sammy.” I whispered. My voice struggled against the overwhelming urge to cry as I thought of the blissful smile on Cas’ face right before he was taken.
He rolled his eyes at me.
Again, silence. I avoided looking into his eyes unsure of whether he would be able to read my thoughts any more than he probably already had. Clenching my jaw, I kept my gaze trained on the cheap dime store shaded lamp on the low dresser across the room and asked, “Did Sam send you? I told him I’m fine, I – “
“Isadora.” Taking in a shuddering breath, she turned to glance over her shoulder at the young people huddled together by the tower, and mumbled, “Started hearin’ screams around one this mornin’. Woke me up. Sounded close, so I started hollerin’, tellin’ ‘em to come in the direction of my search light if they could see it.”
Maggie.”
We watched as he backed the feed up and pressed play. Maggie strode happily toward the door with a fully stocked tray of coffee in her hands. Close behind was a figure dressed in grey. They were small in stature and had their hood obscuring their face. They disappeared after Maggie.
I landed on the ground with a soft thud. A brief shock of pain went up my limbs making me stumble slightly. Wandering around the first floor, I checked for my brother, Cas, or Helena and marveled at how surreal and big everything looked. Eventually I circled to the stairs, headed up, and noticed a dim aura coming from the left of the top step. As I peered around the corner down the hall, I could sense two things. One was the soft snoring, the other was a strange energy.
“Up you get,” Dean said, holding out a hand.
"Oh, you know, just peachy."
I've decided that Dean/Sam is definitely not my thing, so that won't be in this story.
Dean tugged at his ruined clothes subconsciously and laughed shakily, “Saved your ass, didn’t I?”
He searched my face for a moment, silently looking for something. Eventually he nodded and started slowly, “I’m…I’m in everything now. Every drop of rain, every spec of dust. I saw the way those people looked at me back there. They’re all counting on me now.”
“Oh c’mon, it was a little funny.”
“I’m not
“I’m fine.”
“Like what?” the Deputy asked, clearly not convinced by the youngsters.
The question was as expected as the look of genuine pain that flashed across the angel's face. The breath evaporated from my lungs at the sight. Cas’ voice had been quiet. Almost like he hadn’t wanted me to hear.
Dean’s jaw clenched.
Carefully, she tugged my sock further down past my heel, exposing swollen flesh. I hissed but stubbornly kept still. She worked quickly and efficiently. As she wrapped it tightly up in gauze, I asked, "You do this sort of thing a lot?"
“…meet me at the stables on the east side of town,” Sam said finally looking up from his feet. “You can fill me in on the situation when I get there. I’ll help you find him.”
As I wrenched open the door, I looked up over the top at Sam and Jack staring at me like I had gone crazy. Rolling my eyes, I used my keys to point at each of them and emphasize, “We’re not leaving him there.”
Castiel nodded, light on his hand flaring as he healed his burns. “I believe so. The spell was something to do with trading a life for another.”
“Thanks Helena,” Sam said, giving her one last squeeze on her shoulder as he slipped the card with both our numbers on it out of his pocket. “Let us know if you find anything else out of the ordinary.”
domain.”
Castiel fast forwarded until twenty minutes had passed. The figure emerged once again, their head down as they hurried in the direction of the parking lot out front. After a few minutes, a hatchback vehicle backed up to the door. The figure opened the trunk before disappearing inside. Ten more minutes passed before the door was flung open. The person dragged Maggie’s unconscious body with a lot of difficulty and stuffed her in. After laying a tarp over her clumsily, they closed up and strode around to the driver’s side.
One day, while my brother and I sat on the porch watching the sun set, I realized that we’d done it. Against all odds. We’d had long and happy lives.
Silence.
, I told myself.
“Great,” I muttered, immediately imagining him stripping my unconscious, barf-covered body.
Damn angel killing my buzz. I reached for the half empty bottle of cheap liquor store Louisiana Blue, hoping to drown out the feather-brained nut, but at the last moment felt it tugged out from under my fingertips. Uttering a grunt of indignation, I followed the bottle with my eyes to Cas’ side. His figure seemed to be doing a sort of bending back and forth motion like he was standing on the deck of a boat. Not of his own volition of course. I imagined my blood toxicity level had something to do with it. Immediately I felt my stomach lurch as the acrid taste of bile boiled up the back of my throat. I braced myself against the stained, second hand table as I muscled the vomit back down.
“Right, while you monkey around with that, I’m going to go talk with Floyd. Enjoy yourself, Cast Away.”
Kneeling next to Sam she called over, “Cabinet above the fridge.”
Dean dropped me in front of Joel Brown’s apartment building. I headed to his and found his roommate inside. She said that Joel was at work at the Allen Elizabethan Theater. I thanked her and headed out. It wasn’t that far away. About four blocks north.
The youngest Winchester remembered taking this. It was one of the few times John had taken them into a town. Sam and his brother had been so happy. John even bought them some penny sweets from the local general store. The sugar had helped glue his mouth shut for the photo that they had to sit still for. It was a good memory.
The three of us looked over at Jack who was happy to see that we weren’t hurt. He mouthed for us to go, and I did just that. All of us would rush in only to be teleported back to where we started.
“What about you Sam?” I asked, striding over to him still next to Gertie’s dead body.
“Come on out, you son of a bitch!” I called into the shadows, flashing my light around at anything that moved. “Think we’re scared of you?”
“Okay, so camping huh?” I said, clapping my hands together with faux cheer.
Flushed cheeks drained of color as the seconds ticked on. Dean licked his lips and muttered gruffly, “What’re you waiting for?”
After some choice curse words muttered under his breath, Sam begrudgingly nodded.
“Shit…!” he groaned. Even the vibration of his voice made him think of lips pressing and sucking against his throat.
I whipped around and caught sight of a familiar face sitting under the shade of a roof overhang.
With a roll of his eyes, he went over to his bed and sat heavily. He looked tired despite not having drank as much as me last night.
“Definitely hasn’t been here for a while.”
No answer.
I don't know how long I sat there for, clutching my gun and scanning the surrounding area. Most of it was spent in tense silence. The wind was starting to pick up. Pine needles and errant leaves came cascading down from the darkening sky as the trees began to sway. A faint voice came over the wind.
Quirking his head to the side, Dean flashed her a cocky grin and said, “You wanna get to know me better, all you gotta do is ask, darlin’.”
A large tear fell out of the corner of her eye, rolling quickly and silently down her full cheek like a steel colored spark. Reaching out, I gripped her arm and squeezed. Maybe a little harder than I intended.
“Hold on,” Dean said, raising his hands and taking a step toward the stranger. “Why don’t we just –”
Glancing up at Jessica’s body, Dean muttered distractedly, “She’s gone, Sammy.”
Crossing his arms over his chest the Sherriff nodded, “That’s right. Mile up the road or so.”
“Screw you Sai! Did you not see the same crap I did?”
“Whoa, I think I got something. It fits everything we’ve got so far.” Sam said suddenly.
“Y-yeah, but you – you can get him out.” Sam said, glancing between me and Jack. “I mean, Lucifer –”
Cas made a sound of agreement.
“Sam?” I hollered. “Cas?”
His concern quickly morphed into anger as he said, "No Dean, I can't."
For a moment the Empty hesitated, her eyes narrowing at the gangly hunter with malice. He laughed nervously, seemingly regretting opening his mouth. Then suddenly Garth was also gone.
“He said – he said that it would take him when he was…
“Okay. Cell service out here is non-existent so take these.” He said, handing over a pair of heavy-duty looking radios. “Good luck.”
I snarled.
But I wasn’t about to go one mile in these goddamn shoes or this monkey suit. Taking my duffel bag from the back seat as we got out, I stood and called over the top of his Lincoln Continental and said, “Hold up a sec, I’m going to change.”
While we headed back into the inner workings of the theater, I sent Cas and Dean a text:
“Let’s get you home…” Dean muttered, grabbing up Baby’s saddle.
Glancing at him I cleared my throat and continued, “I told Helena somebody eating dog food was weird but not unheard of and she told me that both of the victims had strange collars around their necks inscribed with sigils.”
Sam’s face remained neutral despite the excitement roiling inside of him. He nodded, letting her know that it was fine to continue.
He turned and nipped my hand affectionately before licking it. I ruffled his ears one last time and said, “Don’t worry, I’ll see you again soon. Enjoy your vacation.”
The front door burst open in a shower of splinters as Dean kicked it in. Gertie staggered back, shouting the same words again as she reeled away. A potted tree suddenly sprouted what looked like arms and snatched up Dean. He was lifted into the air like he weighed nothing more than a feather. Letting out a small grunt of surprise, he tried to struggle, but I could hear the creak of wood as the tree started crushing my brother’s ribs. His gun clattered to the ground as he cried out in pain.
Shaking my head (mistake) I muttered, “No, I’m fine.”
He gave me one last lick before trotting back to the house. Jodie and Claire stood in the doorway as we pulled away, waving. Sam sat between their legs, watching intently as we disappeared around the corner. It was surprisingly hard to leave him behind. Especially looking like he did. So small and weak.
“That’s it!” I exclaimed, clapping my hands together in triumph.
I pushed us apart abruptly, but kept him near enough so I could take in how wonderful it was to look at him up close again. Same innocent head tilt, same scruff on his jaw, same blue eyes and full lips that had haunted dream after dream.
“You think she may be in trouble?”
I rolled my eyes and turned away as he continued, "For once could you just admit that you have feelings like the rest of the world and talk about them?"
Castiel chuckled, running the pads of his fingers up and down the back of Dean’s skull through the short hairs there. Dean shuddered again, providing them with another wave of stimulation to their erections.
Outside the motel when I returned, I found Castiel next to the cars. He stood with his hands in the pockets of his trench coat staring up at the trees. I slowed my pace, breathing heavily and called, “Hey Cas…”
Shooting me a sideways glance before turning back to the beautiful woman he answered with a smirk, “A bit moody.”
“Fuck…!” Dean groaned, too weak to shove the woman off of him.
“I guess…” Arush whispered, thick tears dropping from the corners of his eyes silently. “We got woken up in the middle of the night because we heard her screaming bloody murder. After looking around for her though we couldn’t find any trace of her. She wasn’t in her tent, and she wasn’t around our camp. It was like she just vanished.”
Nodding, my brother turned on his heel and headed to the lab. The edges of my vision were starting to blur. Never a good sign. Soon I wouldn’t be able to keep my eyes open. It must be the shock finally wearing off.
He was nestled, eyes closed, in a cocoon of blankets on the cushion of a plush ottoman. He cracked open an eye as I entered and let out a weak whine. I went to his side in an instant and asked, “Hey, man, you okay?”
I nodded, jaw clenched and tight lipped.
For a moment, his long arms moved as if he wanted to physically restrain me. They moved back after a moment of thought. He flexed his hands indecisively at his sides. He knew I was right. Innocent people were in danger. There was no time to dick around.
The scrape of his chair was harsh on my sensitive ears. Not that it mattered much because in the next second I was engulfed in a tight embrace. My head was crushed gently against the unyielding linen fabric of his white button up shirt. I could feel his chest underneath, and the heart beating steadily. At first, I tried pulling away. This was exactly what the Tikbalang had talked about. I was using Cas. And it could only end with him getting hurt or worse.
Offering up a lazy smile I lifted my glass limply, tipped it in his direction, and took a deep swig calling, “How’s it goin’ Cas?”
“It was so messed up without you,” he murmured, grip tightening on Castiel’s coat. “I thought I’d never…never get to tell you…”
“Okay…anything else you can tell me? Do you remember seeing the others acting up before they disappeared?” I asked before taking a gulp of my delicious coffee.
“Yeah,” I answered, trying not to think about how much it was aching. After sharing a soulful look with him, I followed him out once more into the downpour and down the stairs to the base of the tower.
"Yeah?" I answered cautiously.
“Didn’t need to – Jesus, Dean you’re an
Using his height to his advantage Sam bent back and reached for one of the radios Eddie had given us yesterday. Pressing the button on the side, Sam held it up to his mouth and answered, “We’re here Eddie, what’s up? Over.”
Keeping my movements in check, I turned just enough to catch a glimpse of the familiar trench coat and the slouched shoulders under it. If Cas looked in my direction, I couldn’t tell. But his voice held no hesitation as he answered, “Of course. I will follow in my vehicle.”
“Sammy?” I hollered.
Bracing himself on his forearms, he lifted his back enough for Castiel to slide his pants off. And not just his pants, but underwear too. Suddenly he was bare from the waist down and the fallen angel was staring at his erection in wonderment. A deep flush of embarrassment colored Dean’s chest, neck, and cheeks.
“You’re gonna have to if you keep doing that.”
The subtle shift of Dean’s shoulders didn’t go unnoticed. He hunched slightly like a wounded animal. It hurt Sam to see, but he wasn’t going to back down from his decision. And he certainly wasn’t going to insult his brother’s pride by mentioning it.
Understanding where her head was at, I said, “Yes you can. You’ve dealt with crazy shit like this before.”
Eventually the shifting slowed and stopped. I lay there trembling, feeling small and broken. The hand was no longer trapping my voice so I tried calling for help. A raspy whine escaped through a mouth that didn’t feel like my own. I struggled to open my eyes.
Castiel, still healing himself called over, “He may be injured. Gertie kicked him.”
She slumped to the ground motionless as the sound of Dean’s footfalls drew closer. Coughing, Sam rolled away. As he sat on all fours, taking in deep calming breaths, the strange feeling that had enveloped him faded.
Sam’s expression darkened even further.
I assured Cas that we didn’t need to force Dean back into the car…yet. We just had to wait and watch and make sure that he didn’t start any fights. Castiel had a problem with that. Why would we leave Dean to his own devices? That seemed counter-productive to healing, etc.
I made a motion with my hand like I was trying to waft away my last words. Clearing my throat, I started again, “What you said…it took until it was too late for me realize that you had always seen me. Believed in me. When you were gone, I’ve never felt more alone. You’re not just my best friend. And you’re certainly not just a brother to me. Cas…you showed me who I truly am; a man that could have everything you were always trying to say I deserved.
We saddled up and started back down the trail toward Diablo a little before seven. At the trail head where we’d started that morning, we radioed in to Eddie and asked how the kids were getting along and where he’d like us to put his four-wheeler. Sounding drained he said that the police had come by and taken statements from them. A couple were taken out to the nearest clinic to get checked up.
Dean shook his head and cut off Helena before she could speak again, “If we get the police involved with this information, they’ll stick their noses where they don’t belong. At worse they’ll alert the druid before we can gank them, a bunch of innocent cops die, and we lose our chance at getting a reverse dog spell for Sam. At best they’ll alert the druid, get turned into dogs or rocks, and we lose the reverse spell.”
Just as he was making a move to step toward me, Maggie let out a loud yelp from the next room, clearly panicking at discovering herself in a new environment. He gave me a regretful look before turning back to help Helena with calming her down. I let out a subtle breath and thanked the universe for small graces.
Cas rumbled a content response.
Both wondered about the New Year and what that meant for them and their family as they went back to Dean’s room and got dressed. Neither really knew what to say. That is, until Castiel draped his blazer and trench coat over his forearm and headed toward the door. Dean caught the movement just as he was pulling on his sweat pants and blurted, “Wait!”
Rubbing at my tired eyes, I sighed, “Okay, keep looking.”
As he grabbed up his laptop and started typing away, I started unwrapping my wake-up call. It was mouthwatering; dripping in oil and cheese.
“Not yet…” she hissed.
I nodded resolutely before heading back over to the four wheelers. It seemed that with Isadora’s help Eddie had managed to get Greg to calm down. Instead of clutching onto him frantically, he sat steadily rocking back and forth and repeating ‘you’re here’ over and over again. The Firewatcher shared a look with me as I approached, as if to say, ‘understand now?’.
Trying to cover up the fact that his body was reacting against his will, Dean made a smooching face at her before answering, “Lots of folks have tried to get me to squeal…if you think you can do any better –”
“Go back and tell everyone that they need to get out of the building,” I ordered, giving the clip and barrel of my gun a once over. “Make sure you don’t let anymore people out of your sight.”
“Damnit Bobby, where’s
When the door opened, we were greeted by a small woman. The dark circles under her eyes were very pronounced. Drawing her sweater closer against the cool spring breeze she asked, “Can I help you?”
” he admitted sheepishly. “
“Let him go!” a familiar voice barked out from behind.
“Pardon me, are you Joseph Welch?”
It was so strong and foreign to my new senses. There were no words for what it was. It’s what I imagined souls feeling like, or at least based on what Castiel has described in the past. Carefully I made my way down the hall. The feeling grew. Taking a deep breath, I nudged open the door with my nose.
“They said their campsite is down the ridge about eight miles from here toward the east. I hope you don’t mind, but I think I’m going to sit out the search for now…want to get my head in order.”
“What about if we want to grab a – a – a beer with you?” Sam asked incredulously, his emotions causing him to search with difficulty for the correct words.
Hated to admit it, but I kinda liked the guy.
“So is wind,” Floyd grumbled, waving his hand dismissively. “But those political types always come up with something to be offended by.”
Mr. Waithe nodded, gulping down the last of what was in his drink. A tear fell from his eye as he leaned over to retrieve the bottle off the floor next to his chair. He wiped at it discreetly. When he came back up his voice trembled, “I didn’t even know my boy was gone…”
“Thanks Cas,” I mumbled, clearing my throat as I scooted away from him. My inner thoughts beginning to spiral down once more.
“I’ve dealt with a lot of crazy before.”
I nodded in agreement, swallowing my mouthful of burger. With a grin I called, "Hey, you think we'll see Bigfoot up there this time?"
Laughter and the clap of bullets answered him.
The woman Deputy growled, “I’m not sure you realize how much trouble you’re in, pretty boy.”
“Yeah…sure.” I said, glancing between him and Castiel.
Dean looked away as embarrassment set in. Clenching his jaw, he nodded.
Helena looked about ready to melt into a puddle of relief. Shooting to her feet, she met me at the base of the stairs and said, “I just wanted to say thanks. You know, for coming to help and…and everything.”
“If you think Sam and I are legends, then you know who Cas is. He’s…he’s the best part of who we are. Sure, he’s messed up a couple times – we all have – but he’s never given up; never stopped trying to be better. He summoned the Empty to take him to save
Blinking, Dean tried to do as much, but found that his boots were like cement blocks strapped to his feet. It ended up making the trek across the ice-slick parking lot that much more difficult. Sam grumbled in annoyance, securing fistfuls of his brother’s jacket as he heaved him along, careful to avoid patches of slick snow. The pair staggered up to the Impala just as Dean started complaining about not wanting to leave.
? Dean wondered. He’d just had sex of a sort, with a man. A
I could barely breathe. All I could do was beg silently for Cas to not be dead. I pulled his body into my lap, hunching over him in an effort to protect him and myself from the harsh truths raining down. Dad and Adam came up on either side of me once again, sneering at my pitiful attempt at hiding.
“Not sure. Need time, a map, and a watch to figure.”
When Sam caught sight of the lights on the outside of the boarding house, he slowed their pace. Jessica noticed but didn’t mind. In fact, she matched Sam’s stride, her cheeks darkening further. Sam entwined his long fingers with hers, concentrating on how complete he felt being so near. It was here that the presence of the ring he’d purchased (with what little money he could scrape together) started burning a hole in his pocket. He wanted so badly to pull it out and promise himself to her. But he was waiting. Waiting until he was sure he could make her his.
They set off down the main road in the direction of the local saloon. Sam tipped his hat for a couple Omegas and their chaperone as they passed, earning a respectful bob of their head in return. Dean kept his hat low and adjusted the kerchief around his neck. He never was one for towns, but in the years since Sam had been gone, it seemed he’d gotten even worse. Sam glanced at him curiously.
I tried thinking of something else to say. Something to comfort him. To let him know that it would be different this time. But even I wasn’t sure. Dean wasn’t doing well. Whatever had gone down had him really freaked. I took in a deep breath and said, “Listen, I’m worried too, but there’s not a lot we can do about it if he doesn’t want to talk.”
“Lately though I’ve been listening to whatever comes on the radio.”

Edit: Updated this chapter after getting some feedback!
“Cas…” Dean breathed, the hand that had tugged on the angel’s coat sliding up and around, pressing him closer.
“Do you think it’s connected with what happened to us last night?”
Working quickly, Sam lit the lamp and went to stare at the grotesque display of body parts. He allowed the anger inside him to whip into a frenzy. The lantern swayed to-and-fro at his side as he silently vowed that he would do everything, come Hell or high water, to avenge what had been done in this place.
This didn’t look like any kind of place I recognized. I thought heaven was supposed to plop me in the middle of my best memories. So why was Bobby here? In a memory that I didn’t remember ever having?
His brows furrowed in thought.
Sure enough, as I studied the creature, I could see something golden flashing over its shoulder as it tossed its head back with a laugh. What should I do? Castiel looked like he was in pain but holding it back. He wanted me to go, to save myself, I could see him willing it in his eyes. There was no way that was happening.
Castiel shifted, not noticing my weird behavior.
“Ready?”
Sam wondered if he should tell Dean about his intentions with Jessica as they made their way on foot through the city. They were brothers after all. Dean would probably be excited that he was going to start his own pack. But for whatever reason Sam couldn’t bring himself to speak.
Keeping my barrel pointed low, I slunk up to the door and called out, “Isadora…? You home?”
Goddamn him and his annoyingly genuine persistence. I didn't want to talk about it 'cause I had no fucking clue about what that was. I needed time to breathe. To think. Which I couldn't do with the haunting echoes of Dad's voice, mom's screams, and baby Sam's crying still bouncing around in my head. It felt as if my clammy skin could still feel the heat from the flames ghosting across it. I shook my head, shoving my gun back into my pants and said, "Drop it, Sam."
Sam raised his brow at my exclamation but ultimately ignored my comment. Instead, as I moved to start filling up the tank, he tugged out a notebook that he’d been scribbling in while we drove. Slapping it on the top of Baby he started, “I think we should hit up Floyd Rees’ place first seeing as how he’s the only eye witness so far that thinks something’s wrong. We need more information about what's going on.”
I shared a quick look with Sam.
We decided that Ivan and Cas would hike around to the back of the property while Dean and I went to the front. They would come in as soon as they heard fighting or shouting. Dean was hard pressed to let me tag along, but he couldn’t exactly argue with a dog.
“Are you sure you don’t want to wait for Dean to sober up and join you?”
“C’mon, we gotta go!” Dean coughed, tugging on Sam’s arm as the sound of bells ringing and people yelling drew closer.
As he sat back in his seat, he ran a hand over said offending spot and chuckled, “Jess used to say the same thing…”
I chuckled, “Yeah, think I’m over that, aren’t you?”
The sun was just starting to dip in the sky, casting a sleepy glow over the hustle and bustle of the city. Carriages trundled past, their occupants lazily watching out the window at the passersby strolling down the promenade. A pair of men in aprons carefully walked a barrel to a waiting wagon. A woman swept the front porch of a palatial town house while another sold fresh flowers from a basket. And lamplighters carefully opened the glass cases of streetlamps, preparing for the dark of night, dampening the natural glow of the few early stars in the sky.
, and boy I gotta say, it’s nine-shades of crazy.”
The blonde glared over at the other for a moment. Finally, though, he decided to take the opportunity Sam was presenting him. Dean nodded.
Finally, he broke away, blinking over at me. He seemed to realize the truth to my words and bowed his head. Not wanting him to sink into dark thoughts, I said hurriedly, “Why don’t we go over the case together? Keep ourselves occupied.”
"I thought I saw...I'm not sure what I saw."
We slipped backstage, heading deeper into the labyrinth. As we walked, the cramped spaces became less and less populated and darker.
There were still more images left on the table, but the ones displayed looked strange. Squinting slightly at the x-ray of the pelvic area I asked, “Is that a –”
I could feel Dean hovering even with my eyes closed. I wished I could tell him to chill out, or go somewhere else. It wasn’t like either of us had never been sewn up before.
Kicking his heel into the door, we all barged in to the lab. Helena jumped violently, letting out a small squeak of terror. The test tube in her hand shot out of her grasp and shattered on the countertop. Rushing over, Castiel shoved the counter clean with a sweep of his arm and Dean placed me in front of her.
Curling her arm through Stevie’s unsurely, she nodded and settled back into the chair next to her girlfriend.
The desire to diffuse the tension with humor had been so great that I hadn’t thought too much about continuing the conversation between us. I realized my blunder as soon as Castiel tensed under my palm and pulled away from me. He definitely hadn't wanted me to hear him.
