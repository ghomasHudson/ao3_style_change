“Steve, come on, man.” He heard Sam dash in front of him, blocking his path. “Where the hell do you think you’re going?”
he texted Bucky as he paced outside of Tony’s workshop. The glass was oblique, but not completely blacked out, filling Steve with some hope. Not enough for him to go charging in, exampled by his constant pacing and longing looks at the door. With his luck, Tony knew he was out here, and was just watching him walk around like a chicken with his head cut off.
“And I’ll hit the streets,” Natasha added, already heading for the door.
Stark met his gaze slowly, but understanding shown in his eyes. “Job’s not done. Besides, I didn’t want you to get your blood all over my warehouse floor. You know how long it takes for that to get out? It’s not good for business.”
“Tony,” Rhodey sighed.
He could hear The Skull saying something to him, but he could hear nothing over the roaring of his own ears as he watched the other man aim up another shot.
Tony rolled his eyes. “That’s not what you should be focusing on. You
“Well,” Tony retorted. “Most people would say thank you.”
“Rhodes. Let me see it.”
“You’ll get a front row seat to me leading Pierce out in cuffs, but I can’t worry about dealing with three criminals at the same time. Stay put.” And with that, Fury marched out of the room, trench coat flapping behind him.
Steve shouted a curse, throwing the phone in the chopped door, the tech smashing into a million pieces.
Fury sighed again. “Fine. Alleged involvement. And somewhere along the line, you’ve managed to piss someone off.”
“You’re not coming with. You’re staying here.”
Clint burst through the observation room, sighing in relief when he saw Delmar still handcuffed to his chair on the other side of the glass. His relief was short lived, however, when he saw the state Delmar was in.
“Oh, is that all? Steve, do I have to remind you that we are currently running from- ”
It was a short drive, one that Clint could tell everyone was happy about. Guns were loaded and ready as The Commandos poured out of the vans. Steve gestured over to the right, a dark man quickly joining the group, Clint assuming him to be Rhodes.
“A new reign of terror. Mass executioner, purging places everywhere. He came out of nowhere. In six months, he managed to get control of everything. What’s even worse, is that he did it all by himself. No army or anything.”
Bruce returned a strained smile. “You back with me?” he asked with concern.
Tony blinked at him. "Well, if it's taken this long, I obviously haven't been trying hard enough."
“Buck? Hey, look at me; you’re safe now. It’s alright now,” Steve’s soothing tone whispered against his ears, his friend’s arms squeezing his shoulders.
Tony swung the door open, quickly bringing him and his chair to the other side. He could see The Captain pushing himself up to chase him, but Tony hastily slammed the door shut, jamming his chair under the doorknob to prevent his captor from opening it.
Tony hissed. “Ignore it,” he added when he saw Steve look over at the bedside table.
Steve just hummed, breathing in the scent of Tony’s shampoo. It were moments like these, with Tony tucked under his neck, the pair just soaking each other in, that Steve could forget their life for a little while. Tony’s callused fingers wove through the hairs on the nape of his neck, the deft fingers making curls with the blonde strands.
Steve sighed, walking towards his husband. “Well, I’m back. And there’s nothing that I’d like more,” he started, gently taking the drink out of Tony’s hand and pulling him out of the chair, “is to go to bed. So why don’t we- ”
Steve sighed, but obliged Bucky, knowing him to be even more stubborn than Steve himself. The pair stomped down the wrought iron steps of their base, mostly abandoned because of the hour. Almost everyone had returned home, returned to normal life, if only for an moment. Part of Steve wanted to protest, to keep them here, out of sight and out of HYDRA's reach. But he knew that he couldn't. His desire to keep them safe was the same desire that pushed them to pack up and leave each night, to get home to their real families. People he'd never met, only seen through shared photographs or heard through a phone call. It didn't matter, though; the weight of his responsibility included them as well.
Steve shrugged, not letting himself back down against Stark. “I don’t know, I like him.”
Bucky rolled his eyes, but didn’t give an answer. He couldn’t really blame Clint; they had been sitting out there for a while, and even Bucky was starting to get restless.
Steve jolted in his chair again. ”Stop!” he cried, trying desperately to get free.
Stark. That’s what scared him the most.
at the time, seemed like the best thing since sliced bread. Every time they would stop for gas or rest, Steve would always find time to slip away and buy more items for the evening – never let it be said that Steve was a cheap date. He’d even convinced Tony to switch cars, changing over to a truck. Tony, of course, didn’t question the change, or the growing pile of bags that filled up the flat bed. Tony was amazingly oblivious when he needed to be.
“Thought you weren’t going to make it. Where’s the rest of your stuff?”
Zola shrugged.
Clint couldn’t find himself to disagree with the man either. If there was anyone who could crack through Steve’s brain when Bucky couldn’t, it’d be Stark. Getting Stark back on board probably came with the added bonus of Steve getting his head back on straight.
“No, you wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t for you,” Steve returned, a weak smile appearing on his face.
Steve had lost count of how many times an apparent rescue of a pet has gone south. Turns out the wholesome Captain America wasn’t good with animals. No matter how many times he tried, Steve always managed to come home with more scrapes from a house pet then a day long escapade with Doom. Unbelievable, really.
And then, he would finally get some sleep.
He froze in horror, however, as he saw the neighbor’s kid looking up at him with wide eyes. Not really knowing what to say, Steve placed the car down as gently as he could and dashing inside. With any luck no one would believe the kid’s story, if he ever told.
“None this drastic,” Steve retorted. “They’re fighting as if they're completely different units.” The thought hit him like a ton of bricks. “Maybe because they are different.” He knew something didn't add up, he
that The Captain would have eyes on the file drop, but you just had to go and look anyway. Goddammit; do you realize what you’ve done?”
"Cap," Bucky hissed.
Tony snorted. “Yeah, nice try, Cap. Now, get out of my way.”
But, boy, the crew certainly didn’t make it easy. They were so focused on Stark, the outsider,
“And once he kills Iron Man, what then? What’ll happen?”
He signed, gesturing to the mess of people at base.
Clint nodded frantically, eye peeking over their cover at Obie. “Ready?” Tony asked.
“No,” Tony said slowly. “I was underground.”
“Steve never learned how to swim.”
“Bucky, wait!”
A quick roll tangled the body into the tarp making it easy for Steve to shuck it over his shoulder. Entering the building, Steve walked over to the furnace he had turned on earlier, quickly dumping the body within.
Away from the nothing.
“Nothing,” Tony blurted. “I was just thinking that I would bottom.”
“This is Campbell,” she said, pointing to the armed agent behind her. “He’ll be heading in with you.” The man nodded at them, but said nothing, already taking off towards his designated entry point. “Time to move,” Hill added, but stopped them before moving. “Stick to the plan,” she pressed. “You said it yourself. HYDRA is too dangerous to be messing around with.”
"What are you planning to do? Kill me?" Loki jeered. "My father would rein down hell if any harm came to me."
Loki snorted. “You get me out of here, Barton, and I’ll ensure you can disappear.”
he said with a smirk.
He was sure that the miniature arc reactor would be just what they needed – of course, perfecting the design required a test subject. And unless anyone else showed up at his door with a chest covered in shrapnel, Tony was the only chance they had.
Tony nodded. Steve started slow, seemingly moving slower than when he had as he was pushing in. Just gentle thrusts, more rotating his hips than anything else. When he saw no discomfort show on Tony’s face he grew bolder, pushing deeper and deeper into Tony. Tony couldn’t help but lean back farther, his legs opening wider on instinct. He arched when he felt Steve graze over his prostrate, mouth falling opened as he panted. Steve repeated the movement, angling his hips farther to get a more direct hit.
Sorry, this one is a little bit shorter than the others, but it sets everything else up so nicely.
Steve felt a tear of his own fall down his cheek. He didn’t see Tony anymore. He saw himself, getting his life getting ripped apart by the future Rogers. He saw a reflection, cold and alone, with nobody. Tony was no more broken than himself.
Tony sighed, standing up on tired legs. “We are, Obie. We just finished that huge deal with the military!”
Tony furrowed his brows. “Wha-Steve? No, you idiot, it’s Tony.”
It was a bullet hole.
Sorry for the shorter chapter, but what can I say? Writing is hard, especially with someone with the same amount of writing prowess as a goldfish.
Steve stared down at his hands. Still shaking. The tears had stopped, along with the screams. Steve was sure it was just because his body couldn’t produce any more. That it shut down, like the rest of him.
“You should get some rest. He won’t be waking up for a while.”
“That’s not what they call it,” Coulson shrugged.
“My job is to keep Steve happy. Believe it or not, you seem to do the trick," Bucky shrugged, turning the sink off, wiping his now clean hands on the back of his pants. "Ergo, to keep Steve happy is to keep you safe.”
“Your shoe,” Tony pouted. “Give me your shoe.”
Steve bit his lip, ignoring the copper taste that flooded his mouth. “How many left?”
“I’m asking you to help us find the right needle.”
“Relax, I’m fine,” Tony huffed out. “J, any life signs to the left?”
“No,” Tony sobbed, pointing accusingly at Steve. “No, you-you can’t- ”
“Thank you.” It was said so quietly, quiet enough that Steve had to think for a second to make sure he didn’t make it up.
Short answer.
“How are you feeling?” Hill asked innocently.
“Clint, if I would’ve known, I wouldn’t have- ” Tony broke off. “They came out one day with his hat. They threw his officers hat at me and his blood was on it and I just
The whole reason he had come early was to avoid this situation entirely. It was the only way he could finally do right by Tony. Sure, he’s not exactly a model citizen, but Steve’s laundry list is a lot longer than Tony’s. It would have been more than enough to get Fury to set up a deal. Tony could have the chance of new life, a fresh opportunity without Stane of HYDRA hiding in the shadows. He could move on, forget about this patchwork life he was trying to make work, and start over with a blank slate.
“Some assassin you are,” Tony grumbled, his eyes drawing to the plastic bag Steve was holding. “What’d you get?”
she thought with a sad smile. Maybe she’d known even back then that this was something worth fighting for. Natasha looked around her apartment again, someone’s else life staring back at her.
“Nosey bastard,” Tony answered the AI, no heat in his voice. He patted awkwardly at where Bucky’s arms were wrapped around his middle, the man’s head tucked under the back of his neck. “Buck, come on, baby, work with me here.”
Steve paused again, fingers tentatively curling around the laminated plastic. Apparently, Hill knowing that he was The Captain wasn’t the worst thing. It was that she knew he was coming here. Another urge to sprint out the front door engulfed him, but Steve refused to stray from his current path. If this was inevitable, he should be counting his blessings that he decided to come alone. Tony would be spared what was to happen on the other side of those elevator doors.
We needed to get you- ”
“What are we going to do?”
“What do you mean?”
Steve grabbed Phil’s shoulder. “It’s funny. I heard the exact same thing from Clint last week. You know he keeps a police scanner running upstairs all the time just in case? He’s just as worried about you, Phil.”
“This isn’t working,” sighed Steve. Maybe they should have just stuck with trying to get something out of Hammer. It wouldn't be like they wouldn't get anything out of him. But Tony had made a good point -
I will try keep up with my 10 day spectrum for posting a new chapter, but if I go over a few days don't worry! I either just have writer's block, or I'm stuck trying to optimize modern control systems. Or both. It's probably both.
Tony slammed the door to The Captain’s office harshly, some of the sketches flying off the wall from the force of it. Tony glared at the papers drifting through the air as his temper continued to rise. In another grunt of frustration, Tony ran over to the wall of pictures and let loose, arms moving in a whirlwind until every sketch, photo, and memory were torn off the wall and strewn onto the floor at his feet.
“A lot of us just try to ignore it, and those who don’t usually can’t afford to get help,” Steve shrugged. “The least I can do is offer a free podcast twice a month to let people know that they’re not alone.”
Raza paused, turning slowly. “What did you say?”
“We can deal with that later. Right now, we need to- ”
Tony sighed, but said nothing, returning to his original position and stuck his hands out slowly, careful not to jostle the heavy rectangle that sat in his lap.
“How did they find this place?” Natasha gaped.
Steve walked over to the man, flipping him over. Taking out a small pocket knife, he cut through the man’s jacket, revealing his prize. Four blocks of silver taped to his victim’s back shone back up at Steve. He pocketed the bars, strapped his shield on his back, and began the cleanup process.
“Alright, listen. We both know how this is gonna go down. I can’t let you walk away from this diner alive. This is my life now, I earned it. You’ve had yours already; you should do what old men do, and die,” sneered Steve.
“You are
Steve thought to himself.
he heard Steve say and Bucky clenched his eyes shut.
Tony shook his head, pouring a generous helping anyway. Tony couldn’t even tell what day it was, let alone the time. Besides, he needed something to keep him grounded.
Peter gave a rather modest shrug.  “Well… I do tend to win most of the games that we play together, so—”
And also Peter, as it seemed word had already gotten out that an eleven-year-old boy—whose twelfth birthday just happened to be in a couple of days—was one of the main masterminds behind the brand-new planetary energy system.
Tony nodded, even as he stifled a sigh. Steve and Sam discussing the team's upcoming HYDRA raid on their run very likely meant that Steve once again managed to avoid discussing his nightmares that were steadily getting worse. Just a few nights prior, Steve even managed to completely chase Tony from the bed when he started thrashing around so badly that Tony couldn't contain him. He'd been just about ready to summon one of his suits when Steve finally managed to wake himself up, remnants of their tattered bedsheets clutched in his fists.
He was cut off by a bloodcurdling, anguished scream coming from below, and he squeezed his eyes closed, hugging Peter so hard that he grunted. After Afghanistan, Tony understood the sounds of torture all too well.
He heard Dad sigh into the receiver. "I'm rapidly getting to the point where I just don't care anymore, Pete. If it means that I can't even get outta here in time to come and see you, then—then what's the goddamn point?"
"Uhh, hi," Peter stammered. He instinctively wiped his palm on his knee before grasping her hand, which felt as soft as silk. "I'm—um… I'm Peter. Peter Stark-Rogers."
He felt Steve smile against his skin. "As much as I hate to admit it, you're probably right. How 'bout I take a rain check for tonight, then?"
“Okay, but that’s not necessarily you, right?” Natasha says.  “I mean, everyone in the department knows how smart you are, and—”
"But I'm not gonna let that happen, Tony," Steve said firmly. "If I see that the situation is heading too far south for us to ignore, I'm not going to allow you or Peter to get caught in the crossfire. I'll arrange for Thor to take you both to Asgard or something, and—"
Tony let out a rather raspy sigh, clearing his throat as he cradled Steve's hand between his own. "Steve, honey, I've told you. I don't get sick. It's been at least three years since I've had anything more than a head cold, and even that was only for a day or so. So I don't think you need to be worrying about me."
"Okay," Steve said, nodding rapidly. He licked at his dry lips, still staring at Tony like he was afraid he would disappear. "Tony, I just—"
He had just grabbed a bottle of blue superwater when he heard his name.
He hit ENTER, and the whole thing immediately went blank, only for the words, INITIATE SYSTEM to appear across the top a couple seconds later.
A theory made even stronger when his name is announced as the defending Olympic champion, and it takes him at least three heartbeats to smile as he waves to the crowd.  A smile that Tony notices doesn’t quite seem to reach his eyes.
"All right, hon," he said softly, again stamping down the panic threatening to break free. "But I wanna meet your ma first, okay?"
"Sweetheart, we've all been through so much. So much more than any person should ever go through in their lifetime. And you know Sam says that there are certain things that we just can't purge from our memory, no matter how much we wish we could. And something as horrifying as that… there's no way those memories will ever leave us." He ducked down, trying to meet Tony's eyes. "That doesn't make us weak, mo grá, and it doesn't make you a bad parent either. What happened to you in Afghanistan was not your fault, and that is a fact that is undisputed. If it weren't for your ingenuity and tenacity, you and Peter never would've escaped from that cave."
he said.  “That sounds perfect!”
"I know he loves it," Tony said after a short pause, his fingers curling around his left forearm again. "And since there's no way in hell that I'm about to let him go back to galavanting around Queens rescuing cats out of trees and stopping bike thieves, it's all he's gonna get."
"Ahh…" Tony trailed off as his heart began to quicken. It sure seemed like they were ready. They had the quantum suits, the compass—
"Yeah, probably," agreed Wilson. "Did Carol get any sleep last night?"
Steve had barely crossed over the threshold of their room when Tony's hands were on him, pulling and tearing at his clothes with the same pent-up desperation that Steve had felt ever since he'd carried Peter out of the hospital.
Not that Tony blamed him, of course. It was just yet another in the long, unrelenting line of hits that couldn't seem to stop coming no matter how hard Tony tried to dodge them.
"Is there something we can do for you, Agent?" Steve asked in his Captain's voice, his hand covering Tony's on his arm. Tony could tell he was fighting the urge to step in front of him, which meant that his hackles were already up, which usually meant that something very
"Do you have to call me Stevie?" Steve grumbled as he slid into the seat next to Bucky. "Makes me sound like some singer in a band or something."
Peter nodded, folding up the top of his chip bag. "Well… we were able to beat them back once, right? And if we can get Wakanda to help us, then I'm sure we'd be fine. I mean, if even a fraction of all the rumours about their awesome tech are true, then we should definitely be okay. Right?"
"Steve, I just want
"Yeah, I've heard that," said Peter. "Nothing like the two most powerful countries in the world acting like a couple of toddlers fighting over a toy, hmm?" Papa had said something to that effect when he was helping Peter research for his own essay on the Iran Contra Affair.
Thank you so much for all of the wonderful comments!  I’m so glad you guys are enjoying the story!  💖
Steve rolls his eyes and looks away, trying to ignore him, which only serves to encourage the Russian’s childish antics.
"That sounds great to me," he said. "I can't wait."
"All right," Tony said as he shook Stacy's hand. He glanced down at Gwen, her green eyes glassy but determined. "You good at keeping secrets?"
"I am afraid I am unfamiliar with the phrase, 'like-like', Master Peter. Could you perhaps be more specific?"
Peter gave a reluctant nod, attempting to smile. "Okay."
“That is indeed true, my archer friend,” Thor says, clapping Clint so hard on the shoulder that he nearly knocks him to his knees.  “Revels are always enhanced by the enjoyment of ale.  Perhaps we can also indulge in some of these popsicles that you mentioned?  They sound intriguing; are they anything like Pop-Tarts?”
"I still can't get over the fact that
How on Earth was a guy who was so obviously gorgeous and seemingly great with kids—or at least, book-loving, awkward young teenagers—still single?
"Three security guards sustained some minor injuries and a couple of scientists who were working late got pretty freaked out, but no," said Natasha. "No fatalities."
Steve's eyes went wide as he nodded. "Yeah. I do."
"Hey Dad," Peter said softly as he set down the tray. "I, um… Uncle James and I made some food, and I thought you might want to eat something, so I brought…"
"I'm sure JARVIS wouldn't bother us if it wasn't really important, sweetheart," Steve said as he pushed himself up to his knees, reaching for Tony's tablet resting on the bedside table.
pierced the air, causing Maria to jump back, her eyes widening in fear.
"Howard Stark, you are hereby under arrest for conspiring with the enemy to bomb the Langaran mountain power plant," he said. "You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say may be—"
Even so, as much as Steve liked to contemplate the possible 'what ifs?', all of that would have required him to have been in two places at once, since there was no way in hell he would trade his current life for a theoretical one where he hadn't spent decades encased in ice. Even thinking about it was a moot point, and therefore simply a waste of time. He was constantly telling both Tony and Peter that it did absolutely no good to dwell on things that couldn't be changed, and, despite what his nightmare may have indicated, it was impossible to be in both the past and the present at the same time. Steve had heard Bruce, Tony, and Peter all corroborate that at some point or another, and if three of the smartest people on the entire planet all agreed on something, then Steve was well-inclined to believe them.
"Well, I was just wondering when you were gonna start calling Gwen your girlfriend, since you've already hung out together quite a bit and she seems to like you."
Then again, the country had bought Dad and Papa's lie that Peter wasn't Spider-Man back after they were all kidnapped by Obie and Aldrich Killian, and that had been accompanied by actual video evidence, so… maybe the general public wasn't as smart as Peter was trying to give them credit for.
Tony slid his palms up Steve's strong arms and across his broad shoulders to his neck, tugging his head down for a slow, deep kiss, rolling his hips up to meet Steve's as their tongues danced together.
"Well, maybe to you it's not," said Gwen. "But for the rest of us the mere mortals, listening during class has been shown to be a remarkable way to actually learn stuff."
Steve glanced over at Tony, raising an eyebrow. He loved the fact that his teammates wanted to be there with them to offer their moral support, but only if Tony was comfortable with it.
But even with all of his planning and preparation, he'd never dreamed of how absolutely mind-blowing it could actually be until he experienced it. Sex with Tony was always incredible, whether it was a quickie after a mission to help them both wind down enough to sleep or the longer, more languid lovemaking that he preferred, Steve had absolutely no complaints about their sex life.
"Mmm, don't stop," Steve mumbled into Tony's neck. "Feels good."
"Well, I can't fault you there," said Steve. He carefully peeled a banana, biting off a large piece as Bucky's words bounced around in his mind. "Tony and I both really appreciate you sticking around to keep an eye on Peter for us."
“Bullseye!” Clint says triumphantly as three guards drop to the ground with a
Shuri had essentially regrown all of Tony's damaged skin, fortifying it in the process to be even stronger than it was.
Peter rolled his eyes in such a perfect imitation of Tony that if Tony hadn’t been so goddamn tired—or called out—he would’ve laughed.
"Yeah, hon, I did. But—"
A knot rose in Tony's throat as he nodded, eyeing Steve through his lashes. "How in the hell do you do that?"
If nothing else, it would serve as a decent distraction, something both he and Peter could use at the moment. Hearing that his girlfriend was going to be spending the entire upcoming summer on another continent had stung him badly, and anything Tony could do to help Peter cheer up he figured would be more than welcome.
"Yeah, bud, just a bit frustrated," Tony finally said, huffing out a sharp breath. "You know how much I love talking to those government folks."
—years ago, Steve's ring was a duplicate, one that Tony made for him after HYDRA stole his original wedding ring when they took him prisoner. Steve had been so drugged and otherwise out of it at the time that he hadn't even realised it was gone until Tony and the rest of the team showed up to rescue him.
“Ah, seventy-two inches, according to my last physical,” replies Steve.  It was on the tip of his tongue to say sixty-four.
was… well, Steve was so worried for them that he could barely stand up straight.
"'Night, buddy," said Dad.
"Yeah. This all looks a lot worse than it is," Steve said. No sense in having Sam worrying about him. "Any news on Bucky?"
But just as that thought finished zooming across Steve's mind, he heard Sam speak up over the comm, his heart leaping at the sound of the voice he hadn't heard in almost a year.
And the pain was so excruciating, far beyond anything that Steve had ever before felt, that he had no idea how Tony was able to remain conscious, much less stay coherent.
"C'mon, Papa, it's time to pick up the kid."
Thankfully, he and Dad had been able to take enough notes—with Shuri's blessing, of course—to give them plenty of stuff to work on over the summer, once they got back from the vacation Papa was planning. Hopefully it would be enough to keep Peter from moping around the house too much, as he'd overhead Papa suggest to Dad after dinner the night before.
Peter laughed, raising his camera. "Eh, I guess it is now."
"Shall we?" he asked Gwen, holding out his elbow for her to take. His heart gave a flutter when she smiled that smile that always made her pretty green eyes sparkle, taking his arm with a flourish.
He waited until Bucky gave a nod. Steve had asked Tony before he'd left for his run to be extra careful with anything that might trigger memories of Bucky's torture and captivity at the hands of HYDRA. Unfortunately, since Bucky's memories were all messed up due to Zola butchering his brain way back when he was first converted, not even Bucky was aware of everything that he had been through, and Tony was in no mood to find something new out now.
the tiny little voice deep inside Steve's head whispered.
Steve was certain that Anthony had meant his statement to be humorous, but Steve couldn't help but notice the tiny waver in his voice, as if he was afraid if something like that did happen then he would get blamed for it.
And for someone with an eidetic memory, that was saying something.
"No, you're not being stupid, you're just… afraid. And it's okay to be afraid as long as you don't let it control you. Isn't that what you and Papa tell me every night?"
"And also, Mr Thor is inquiring if his apartment is still available?"
Yea: 48, Nay: 50.
"Oh, it is. Trust me," Grandma said wistfully. "Your grandfather Joseph was definitely a heartbreaker. And Steven is as well, as I'm sure your father would agree." She chuckled at Peter's obviously confused expression. "It just means you're extremely good-looking, dear. Nothing more ominous than that."
Steve was quiet for several heartbeats as they swayed to the music, the same song they had danced to on their wedding day. Finally, he pressed his lips to the top of Tony's head, his left hand gliding up to splay across Tony's back.
"Eh, not just yet, J, yeah? Give me a couple minutes, I just wanna rerun some tests first."
"What?" he managed, watching in awe as the axe began zig-zagging its way across the plain, taking out every single group of war dogs in its path. Steve ducked as the axe passed over his body, gulping in relief as he pushed himself up onto his elbows just in time to see Thor land on the ground, surrounded by crackling bolts of lightning. As the lightning faded, two more beings landed on either side of Thor; a huge raccoon standing on its hind legs and holding a rifle, and a… tree.
“Oh no!” Steve grunts as he fumbles, trying to get his shield underneath him.  But before he can even begin to move, he suddenly lands completely flat-footed on a cracked cement floor.  A jagged cry of pain escapes his throat as his right leg gives way, its sickening
"Ahh, you're just sore 'cause your team sucks," Sam shot back. "If the Mets would've won you wouldn't be near as grumpy."
"Ahh, M-Maggie?" Lang said. "Maggie Lang? Uhh, you're—you're not—are you—?"
Peter scowled. "I was just trying to help," he said, far too petulantly. "Seemed like you guys needed it."
And the fact that she couldn't seem to take her eyes off of Peter spoke volumes to Tony, easing his anxiety just enough to allow him to smile as they all posed for more photographs.
“Mmm.  Sounds great,” answered Steve.  Since it was Peter’s last day of school for the year, he was getting dismissed at lunchtime, and they all had plans to go out and celebrate once Steve and Tony picked him up.  Steve, Tony, Peter, Sam, Bucky, and Colonel Rhodes, who Steve had had the honour of being introduced to over the phone earlier that week.
❤ = you wish you could kudos again
"I love this game!" Uncle Thor exclaimed as he bit into another wing. "We must do this more often!"
"Steve, honey, do you read?" Tony asked as he ran down the steps and out onto the runway, shielding his eyes from the bright sun as he scanned the sky for Steve's aircraft. "Steve, are you there?"
"I'm sorry," she said as they exited the theatre. "I think my dad's starting to freak out a bit."
"Not yet, you're not," Bucky said with a rather evil grin. "Something tells me that might not be the case for too much longer."
“Shh,” Tony whispered.  “It’s okay, honey.  I've got you.”
Which meant that someone else, someone likely affiliated with either the government or HYDRA, now had a complete schematic of one of Tony's Iron Legion suits, and while whoever it was likely wouldn't have the proper materials to build one of their own that was actually functional, that didn't mean that they wouldn't try.
"Oh, that sounds awesome!" Ned exclaimed, with so much enthusiasm that Betty jerked backwards. "I love Clue!"
"Um," he started, breaking off when even that tiny word seemed to get stuck. He painfully cleared his throat, straightening his shoulders.
"No, no, no, that's still not the right part, big guy," Tony said, trying hard to hold onto his frustration. He had always despised video conferences, and especially ones that involved trying to coach Bruce into repairing an alien spacecraft. But it was either that or fly out to New Asgard himself, and with Peter now on day five of his coma and showing no signs that he was ready to wake up, unfortunately the video conference was all Tony could offer.
"Prepare the tunnel, JARVIS," he said, breathing in deeply through his nose as he waited for the all-too-familiar tug behind his navel.
"Tony—"
"I know," Tony had said softly. "I'm just…"
"I've missed you too, Dad," Peter murmured as he wound his skinny arms around Tony's neck. Then he pulled back, his eyebrows knitting together. "But why're you dressed like a cadet? Haven't you been home?"
"I always wished that Dad would find someone who loved him for him," Peter murmured into Papa's chest. "I knew it would be hard because he's a Stark and all of that nonsense, but I also knew that it would be even harder because of me. Most people don't want someone else's kid tagging along into a relationship, and especially a kid who was as busted up as I was."
"Course it is, bud," Tony said softly.
"Oh gods, Tony," Steve groaned. He bit down so hard on his bottom lip that Tony winced. "You don't—you don't have to, but—"
Rushing into the room, Tony headed straight for the small dresser and opened Steve's sock drawer, rummaging around in the back until he found the small box, just like Steve had said. He hesitated a couple of seconds before opening it, gasping in awe once he did.
"Yeah, he did." Tony took off his glasses, pinching the bridge of his nose. Steve had only been gone for a few hours, and Tony was already missing him so badly that he ached.
Peter's lower lip was trembling as he shook his head, his dry eyes stinging with tears. "No," he choked out. "Everything's not all right, like, not at
"I gotta get back to Liz's house," he muttered, his teeth chattering as the cold from the ice started to seep through his suit, chilling him down to his very bones. Groaning, Peter pushed himself up to a sitting position, and was just about ready to attempt to stand when something off to the side of the lake caught his eye, and another freezing-cold bolt skittered down his spine.
“Yep.  It’ll do,” Peter said happily.  He tipped his head against Steve’s shoulder, the massive ice cream sundae he’d ordered for dessert apparently forgotten.  “This is the happiest night, isn’t it, Papa?”
"And these warp calculations are an actual thing?" Bruce asked, raising a skeptical eyebrow. "And not just in some TV show?"
"Yeah, 'cause I don't think we'd be able to convince T'Challa to destroy the Soul Stone anymore than these guys wanna destroy the Time Stone," said Sam. "Not that I blame him, of course."
The drive back to the Tower passed in a daze. Leaning his head against the wall of the elevator, Peter closed his eyes, bracing himself for the inevitable third degree as soon as he stepped into the penthouse.
Those images of his husband lying there on that hospital bed for days on end, hooked to innumerable machines and with his sternum gaping open, not knowing if the surgeon would be able to operate until just moments before he did still haunted Steve, and likely would for the rest of his life.
Peter thinks as they walk the few metres to the conference room.  Peter’s mouth drops open as they step inside and Mr Rogers stands up from his chair, hurrying over to them with his hand outstretched.
Before they embarked on the most dangerous mission of his entire life, Steve wanted to make love to his husband.
"Yeah, it does," Peter said in a low voice. "But since the relationship the Avengers have with the Wakandan king isn't officially recognised by our government, we're not exactly advertising it too much at the moment."
Spring was coming, and Steve had always loved spring. It was like the Earth was being reborn.
Somehow, they would find him.
He had managed to hold onto his control just long enough to avoid breaking down in front of everyone else.
"Uh huh," replied Peter.
The second that thought flitted across Tony's mind, he slammed to a halt, hovering directly above a pile of bloody attack dog carcasses as he tried like hell to talk himself out of the idea he knew Steve would find completely mad.
"But Peter got that drug too, multiple times," Steve insisted. "And he can still remember believing that either Tony or I was dead. In two different timelines."
"Oh, he'll love that."
"Oh. Well, that sounds like fun," said Sharon. "So, are you here to see someone?"
What had started as a cockamaime way to bribe the government into saving Peter's life, Project Phoenix had somehow managed to transform not only their planet, but Tony's entire life as well.
“Well, I sure don’t mind him hanging out with me in the afternoons,” Steve said.  His steps slowed as they walked past a line of some of the most snazzy-looking vehicles he had ever seen, including a mouth-watering 2012 FLHR Harley Davidson Road King that was in such impeccable condition that Steve wondered if it had ever been driven.
Pride instantly welled up inside Peter, and he had to fight an almost overwhelming urge to jump for joy at finally achieving the goal he had yearned for for so long. Instead, he bit the inside of his cheek and simply nodded, straightening his shoulders as Dad walked away.
"I'm so sorry!" she exclaimed. "Mom always says that peppermint helps calm your stomach if you're feeling sick, but I suppose that wouldn't work too well if you're allergic to it!"
God, Steve was a lucky man.
Steve was in every way the quintessential 1940s gentleman, and while it had first thrown Tony for a pretty big loop, as he just wasn’t used to being so…
"Петр Старк-Роджерс."
What's going on? Is Gwen okay?"
"Yeah, me too. It'll be worth it, though."
"Ya coming, Stevie?" he said, smirking. "I'm sure Mr Stark has other things to do besides sit around here while you stare at him."
hell am I doing?” he murmured.
"You are so damn pretty when you come," Tony murmured once he'd regained some minimal use of his senses. "I can't believe I'm the only one who's ever gotten to see you like this."
Mr Rogers’ lips twitch before curling into a smile.  “You watched my races?”
"Oh, Dad, I so wish you could've seen it!" Peter exclaimed as Steve and Thor came up behind him. "Ned and Gwen and I were all just standing around outside waiting for our rides when Flash came out, and he was trying to be all cool and stuff because apparently his dad just bought him a new phone, and he was trying to tell us that it was so much better than our StarkPhones because it can take panoramic videos, but when I tried to tell him that my phone can take panoramic videos too he called me an idiot and said that I didn't know anything about videos 'cause I never take any videos, which is just
"Thanks, boy," Tony said as he took a sip, earning another beep as DUM-E returned to his corner, patiently waiting for when Tony needed him again.
"But, what?" Gwen exclaimed. "Peter, it wasn't real! What you saw, it was just some spell! Like you said!"
"Yes, I'm well aware of Anthony Stark's position here with the Air Corps," O'Brien said.
Clint frowned as he drew back his bow, aiming the arrow about half a metre from Steve's head. "All right, if you say so."
"Shit, this is one for the ages, Stevie!" shouted Captain Barnes as his third engine ignited. "Oh man, this is so awesome!"
"Eh, it's not so bad," Peter said. "It's actually kinda nice to get out of the city every now and then. It's a lot quieter up there."
And how just like Peter was it, that his very last action would be to try and comfort his father?
"Yeah," Peter said softly.
"Come in," Tony croaked. He removed his glasses, rubbing at his stinging eyes as a young, blonde-haired nurse entered the room, her pretty face twisted in sympathy.
"Well, then so as long as we can be sure that all our ducks are in a row before the aircraft launch, I don't see a problem."
Tony drew in a deep breath as he nodded. Thor had become quite fond of both Sam and Steve's cooking since he'd been back, and had taken to requesting certain meals when he didn't feel like ordering his usual pizzas or fried chicken deliveries.
He left the rest of his sentence unfinished, but Tony caught his meaning anyway. Being with his friend would force Peter to act as if everything was fine, a tactic that Tony was all-too-familiar with.
"I do," Steve murmured as his arm slid around Tony's shoulders, drawing him closer. "Just like with you, I didn't have a choice. You Starks are pretty charming."
"Honey,
"Fury doesn't miss a beat, does he?" Tony said as Steve polished off his third sandwich. "I swear that man could go to his own ma's funeral in the morning, and then be back at work in the afternoon."
"Thank you," Steve said. He didn't bother adding that he knew Tony had already looked through the data at least once while he'd been awake the night before, and that he hadn't liked what he'd found.
"No, Peter, it's not nothing," Gwen said with a sigh. She ducked down, forcing Peter to meet her eyes. "You got upset like this earlier too, at lunch when Ned was talking, so don't try and tell me it's nothing. I want to help you."
"Steve, do you copy?" Carol suddenly cut in. "I just came through."
"I see," he said. "Well, I'm sure that my officers will be very pleased to hear that a such highly-decorated Captain as yourself has such a firm grasp on the protocols that we hold so dear." He paused, tapping his fingertips together. "Very well, Captain. You are dismissed."
Dad rolled his eyes, his shoulders sagging in defeat. "All right, fine. I
"No, no, none of that," Tony said once they broke apart. "You know it wasn't your fault."
he said, waggling his eyebrows. "You know in order to get the nanite template as accurate as possible, JARVIS has to scan you."
"I knew I was here, now," Steve said. "I knew I was married to Tony, and that we were part of the Avengers. But then it was Peggy on the radio, just like she was in 1944, but somehow she knew about Tony and Peter too. She kept telling me that it would be okay, that they would understand what I was about to do, and I just—" He broke off, tapping the table with his palm. "None of it made any sense!"
"I would like the record to show that Captain Rogers and Colonel Rhodes were successful in their mission to rescue myself and my son," Tony spoke up. "And that they not only rescued us from an active war zone, but that Captain Rogers also saved my son's life without question or hesitation, even before I knew who he was."
"Eh, if you don't mind, I'd appreciate it," Tony said as he scratched at the back of his head. "And I'm sure Steve won't mind it either."
(See the end of the chapter for
"Yeah, I suppose the last thing that we need right now is for Loki to throw another tantrum," Dad said, handing Uncle Thor his newly built eye. "Try that on for size."
“It’s all right, honey,” Dad said softly.  “Let’s keep going.”
"Sounds good, big guy," said Tony. "You bring the coffee. Preferably in very large quantities."
"Ow!" Peter yelped as he came to, bouncing hard onto the edge of the ship as the sensation of being immersed in warm water flooded his body. He looked down at his chest, blinking as he recognised the cool Spider-Man emblem from his nanite suit.
Steve nodded, his beautiful blue eyes glassy. "Till death do us part."
Steve pursed his lips, wishing more than anything that Tony was there, by his side.
Again.
"No!" he cried, looking up at the kind nurse with pleading eyes. "Ms Sharon, you of all people know that there's no hope for me, so please, just let me do this! Let me save my papa before it's too late!"
Impossible.
Peter bit his bottom lip as he fiddled with a tiny section of the interface, adjusting one of the settings in such a way that would allow it to connect with the user almost twice as fast as Tony had originally calculated, reducing the margin of error and allowing the user that much less exposure to the electromagnetic field. While the field itself wasn't considered to be dangerous, Tony had postulated that prolonged exposure to it could eventually lead to headaches, as the human imagination wasn't really designed to be outwardly projected.
Steve breathed in, his belly dropping a bit as Natasha showed him a photograph of the pager, on which appeared a symbol composed of two zig-zagged stripes of blue and red and a gold star in the centre.
Steve huffed out a sharp breath, his shoulders sagging. "Well, can you at least tell me if there's any of the serum left? I know the project was originally designed for six participants, but—"
Uncle Bucky raised his head, quirking an eyebrow. "What makes you say that?"
"Oh yeah," said Chester. "I really like those, Joe. Tell Sarah that they both have my official stamp of approval."
No, he is certain that he has not.
series, along with three entire shelves filled with every single
"It will take approximately forty-five minutes to achieve limited firing capability, sir," JARVIS said. "I'm afraid that I cannot give you an estimate for full capabilities at this time."
"I've got a lock, Colonel, it's now or never!"
"Please!" he finally breathed. "Please, mo grá, I
Steve already had a pretty strong feeling about most of his fellow pilots. In addition to underestimating Steve himself, General O'Brien also seemed to have underestimated the bond that the pilots shared. To Steve they were his extended family, even those like John Sheppard and Major Kowalski who he didn't personally know as well, but he could not assume that they all held a similar conviction without more evidence, and knowing who they could trust would be an absolute requirement going forward.
—preparing a lecture on basic flight aerodynamics for Colonel Rhodes' new cadet class that was beginning in two weeks.
"Oh, I'd say I'm about the same," said Steve. "I've been eyeballing each of the satellites as I go by, and they all seem to be working okay."
"Colonel Phillips and Mr Stark are down prepping the equipment in the procedure room right now," said Carol. "It should only take them about an hour or so, and then…" She paused, biting down on her lip. "Colonel Phillips did tell us that if the Phoenix mission hadn't been successful, there's no way we would've had the necessary power to complete the procedure."
"Holy shit," Tony whispered as he brought his hand to cover Steve's, interlacing their fingers. "Captain Rogers, pardon me for being so forward, but I do have to say that you are just fucking gorgeous."
"At your service, sir."
“No, that’s understandable,” Steve said quickly.  “I get it.”
Finally, just as he feared that not even his strength would be enough to get the damn thing open, the canopy suddenly sprung up like the hood of a car, almost knocking him right in the chin. Righting himself, Steve immediately reached inside, tearing Bucky's helmet from his head and ripping his harness off, the bloody, mangled state of his left arm nearly stopping Steve in his tracks. With a firm shake of his head he slid his arms around Bucky's waist, hauling him up and onto his shoulder as the emergency crews raced towards the aircraft with a stretcher.
Obie threw his head back and laughed, like Tony had just told the funniest joke in the entire world.
Peter thought.
Three hours later, after navigating the snowy roads and a couple of detours, the three of them were cuddled up on the couch in their brand-new living room watching a movie, steaming hot cups of cocoa in their hands—complete with candy cane stirrers, and Steve’s heart so full he feared it might burst.
The nurse shook her head. "
Nodding, Peter pressed his ear harder against Dad's armour, trying to focus only on the constant
Tony realised, just a second too late when Peter opened his mouth.
A smile of relief stretched across Tony's lips. "That's more like it," he said as he tipped his head, pressing a slow kiss to the underside of Steve's jaw. Steve shivered in response, and Tony let out a soft chuckle. The successful test of his new armour had managed to ward away the last lingering heebie jeebies from his nightmare, at least for the moment, and now he couldn't help but notice that he had his insanely hot husband in his arms, wearing nothing but a thin pair of sleep pants and a t-shirt that showed off his deliciously firm pecs and abs to perfection.
Bucky started.
"No, mo grá, please, don't," Steve whispered as he flattened his palm over the scars on Tony's chest, framed by the dog tags that Tony wore around his neck. "Please, don't think like that. Is breá liom tú, agus ba mhaith liom tú a shásamh. Inis dom cad ba mhaith leat."
“Dad, I was just trying to help!” Peter cried.  “I thought if I could find some evidence that Obie was doing stuff behind your back, that—”
, of all people, would ever make such a mistake. Now, could you please show me how big a large popcorn is?"
"Yeah, okay." Peter dropped his gaze to his lap, fiddling with the blanket. "I miss you guys."
"Ah, sure." Peter's breath hitched when Gwen took his hand, lacing their fingers together as they walked over to the refreshments table. She was such an awesome girl, and he was already feeling horrible for having to ditch her.
Apparently this time it was Doctor List's turn.
"Yep, hence why I said, 'right by your hand'," Tony said. "Now, point your phone at it so JARVIS can send me a hologram."
She was dead.
"Rhodey?" Steve asked.
"Oh, good," Peter said once the heavy wooden door had clicked shut. "I'm already starving!"
Rage flooded Steve's body, so strongly that he literally saw red. "What the hell are you talking about?" he yelled, his hands gripping Rumlow's uniform so tightly that a bolt of pain shot through his fingers. "How dare you even mention—!"
"Theoretically, you'd think that would work," said Tony. "But the reality is that we have no way of knowing if it would since we've never done it before, and these aircraft aren't technically designed to be spacefaring. If this mission turns out to be a success then the next set of aircraft might be better designed for actual space exploration, but for the moment the X-302s are all we've got, and they were only designed to go into orbit."
"Steve, I said, hush!"
"Watch it be something really obscure," Peter whispered to Gwen. "Liz likes to think of the weirdest things sometimes."
"Then you don't have to, little guy," Steve said firmly. He placed his own hands over Peter's ears, partially covering his eyes as he followed Bucky and Sam to the parking lot. "You just dive right into the car, okay? Uncle Sam will have us out of there in no time."
"He looks so much like Tony," Steve added.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Yeah," Peter said as he smiled back at her. "Have a good night."
Peter was so focused on his papa, both the image version and the live flesh and blood, that when the rifle shot suddenly appeared, the very sound that haunted Papa the most, he immediately dropped to the floor, absolutely convinced that it was real.
"Yes, yes, I'm all for showering. All the easier to get you naked."
Peter was definitely healthy, that much was clear. It was just that he almost seemed…
At Tony's nod, Helen gave him a sympathetic smile. "There's nothing life-threatening, so you don't need to worry about that. Captain Rogers has several broken bones, including his left cheek and orbital bones, his left ulna, three ribs on his left side and two on his right, his left fibula, and most of the bones in his left foot. He also has two broken knuckles on his right hand, as well as a hairline fracture of the right radius that's already calloused over, so I'm guessing that was one of his earliest injuries."
"Oh yeah!" Peter said with a rather dopey grin. "It was gonna be me and Uncle Bucky against you and Papa, remember?"
"Mmm," Tony grumbled, earning another squeeze of his hand from Steve as General Okoye and another of the women warriors led them inside the palace. Showing the three of them to an ornate, nicely-sized two-bedroom suite, the general gave Tony and Steve a bow, informing them that their luggage would be delivered from the jet shortly, and that a banquet would be served in their team's honour in three hours' time.
"I know he needs time," Steve whispered. "I'm just… it's just so hard to see him like this. I thought this would stop once we removed the Winter Soldier programming from his mind."
Another rifle shot off to his left caused Steve to snap around, just in time to see Bucky's triumphant wink.
"Steve, I've had better nightmares," Natasha said softly. "But we can't give up now. I really think that—"
"Yes. And your boy as well," said Phillips. "Seems like you Starks have a knack for this kinda thing."
"And before you guys ask, no, Gwen's dad hasn't said anything about what happened at the theatre," Peter added as soon as Thor was out of earshot. "Or at least not to her."
Tony gave his head a hard shake, trying to get his mind to stop spinning. Peter was absolutely correct, he knew that. But at the same time, he was
was always just kinda there, tagging along as your annoying third wheel."
"Oh, just a little something I thought we could hang in our bedroom up at the Compound," Steve answered. He stepped back so Tony could get a closer look, and Tony couldn't help but feel a bit misty as his eyes swept across the practically life-like portrait of himself, Steve, and Peter, all sitting around the bonfire up at the Compound. The three of them were all smiles, with Tony's head resting on Steve's shoulder and Peter busy pulling apart an especially gooey roasted marshmallow, his huge brown eyes innocent and happy.
The sound of footsteps heading towards the door caused Peter to jump back. He was just about at the end of the hallway when the man stepped out of the room and squinted in Peter's direction, his arms laden with colour-coded files. Almost immediately Peter felt the ice-cold shiver race down his spine that he'd come to recognise as his Spider Sense, which either meant that it wasn't working correctly, which had never happened, or that Mr Toomes was a criminal.
"Oh," Peter said, wincing as a loud thudding noise sounded from one of the bedrooms of the two-story walkup Gwen called home. A second later there was a piercing shriek accompanied by a shouted, "I didn't do anything!" followed immediately by a, "Yeah you did, don't lie!" Gwen, Peter had found out earlier that day, was the oldest of four children, with three younger brothers.
"Yeah, I kinda figured that much," answered Peter. "But what—?"
, for goodness sake, and rescue Captain America from some invisible building? The very same invisible building where he'd been taken prisoner by the Nazi organisation that's been around since World War II, and that had managed to completely infiltrate our government and law enforcement agencies? Is that it?"
"Mmm, thanks?" Peter grumbled, fighting the urge to roll his eyes. "I guess?"
"It's all right," Steve said gently. He chugged down the rest of his water, attempting to wash down the taste of bile in the back of his throat. "Can you tell me what this is now?"
"Be about forty seconds until we hear from Steve," he said.
—he was put on such a spectacle of a trial that it lasted three whole years because Dad said it took the government that long to admit that they were wrong.
do such a thing, and neither would Dr Banner," he said through clenched teeth. "And I know for a fact that neither of them would be in favour of… identification or anything of the sort, if that's what you're suggesting. And none of the rest of the team would be in favour of it either."
"We have exactly one," Tony said shortly. "Otherwise we'll be late getting back to the city to pick up Pete."
And that was more than enough.
"No," Steve said as he covered Tony's lips with his fingers. He sucked in a shaky breath, squeezing his eyes closed in a vain attempt to stop his tears from flowing. He knew exactly why Tony didn't want to hear what he had to say, but he still needed to say it. For his own sake as much as for Tony's.
"Hang on, you're going
"Thanos already had two of the stones, Steve!" Bruce exclaimed. "He had the Mind Stone and the purple one, the—the—"
“Yeah, would you mind telling our other guests that they can come in now?  I think we’ve all had enough of this asshole’s rants.  Oh, and tell Happy to accompany them, we don't want any further casualties on company property if we can avoid ‘em”
It really was the perfect end to a tumultuous year, one that Tony was very glad to see gone.
"Well, don't let me stop you."
"Hmph," Peter grumbled under his breath as he picked up his tablet, opening the file he'd created for his Government assignment earlier that day. He was supposed to look through the various bills scheduled for debate in the Senate and come up with his own opinions on how he believed the debate might go, based on who was sponsoring the bill, what the bill entailed, and how many people could eventually be affected by it. It seemed to be a rather dull assignment, but since his Government teacher was a rather dull person, he supposed he shouldn't be too surprised.
"Christ, babe, what the hell happened to you?" Tony demanded, his face etched in concern. "You look like you just took a nap on the surface of the sun!"
"I love you so damn much, and when I thought that—
"Yes, that is exactly what I am saying," said Thor. "Agent Barton, I believe you experienced some of these effects as well?"
"Yeah, yeah, that makes sense," Bruce said once Tony was done. "And it pretty much corresponds to where Clint and Nat wanted to head next. They were planning on starting on the southernmost tip of Florida and working their way up. Nat said she's even gonna dye her hair blonde to try and disguise herself, so…"
"She's wonderful, Tony," said Steve. "She told me what an incredible father you were way back before I even met Peter for the first time, so I know she'd be willing to help us."
Peter pursed his lips. "Uh huh." It wasn't that he was scared that Steve would refuse to carry out the mission once he found out. From what he and Steve had talked about during his visits it didn't seem like Steve wanted the war to continue on forever or anything, and especially now that he had Dad. But since what Peter and Dad were proposing was technically illegal, it was going to place a whole lot of pressure on Steve and his two teammates—and everyone who'd be taking care of things on the ground too—to get the job done before anyone high in the government figured out what was going on.
Tony huffed out a sharp breath. "'Cause it couldn't be just that easy now, could it."
"It's looking great, Control," replied Steve. "I'm gonna be pretty anxious to get back up here. Approaching go/no-go in five… four… three… two… one… mark."
"Who are you?" Peter called, finally finding his voice again.
"Oh, but I'm not sure that I've found everything there is to find yet!" Gwen protested. "There might be more stuff hidden in here on what Peter's doing, so—"
"I finally rest. Watch the sun rise on a grateful universe," answered Thanos, and Peter could've sworn that he looked almost sad. "The hardest choices require the strongest wills."
"Okay, J," he said as he ran his fingers down his goatee. "Give me an estimate of how much force this thing would be able to block, yeah?"
is to go back to bed!" Tony snapped, his temper finally getting the better of him. "And I mean actually go to sleep, not go poking your nose where it doesn't belong.
"Yes, it is," Thor said as he sat up straighter. "I've recently experienced a vision, one that I believe to be prophetic in nature." He went on to explain in detail the same vision he had described to the rest of the team before their departure, during which T'Challa listened intently.
repeat. At first, Tony had tried to insist that he fly them up to the Compound on his suit, but while Steve could tolerate being carried by Tony for short distances, he'd never learned to enjoy it for longer than a couple of minutes and quickly vetoed that idea. After a quick conference with Clint and Natasha, who assured Steve and Tony multiple times that the attack had ceased following the two initial impacts and that both Peter and Gwen had been found alive, they decided to collect George Stacy from his home and fly up in the Quinjet, arriving at their upstate facility in record time.
"And it was beautiful," Thanos continued. "But Titan was like most planets; too many mouths, not enough to go around. And when we faced extinction, I offered a solution."
"We'll fill you in when you land, okay?" Rhodey said. "Proceed to the secondary hangar."
Actually, knowing Schmidt, there’s a very good chance that’s exactly what he’s doing.  Everything Steve’s ever heard about the man has said that he does not take kindly to losing.
“Oh, God!” Steve said out loud, both out of excitement and despair as he raked his fingers through his hair.  “He said he’d see me tomorrow!”
having your good buddy the Army general there give away the troop movements to those very same insurgents so they would know exactly when and who to target!  Now, I know you're probably gonna say that there’s no way any of this could be true because there’s no proof, right?  That the math just doesn't add up?”  Tony held out his hand behind him, smirking slightly when Rhodey handed him the papers.  “Well, Obie, you know damn well that my math’s never wrong, which means we have all the proof that we need to not only take down you, but your buddy the general as well.”
"Oohh, Fury's not gonna like that," warned Clint.
Whatever it took.
Heat burst across Steve's body at Tony's proclamation, so strongly that for a moment he feared that he'd actually burst into flame, right there in their bed.
"I know that—" Peter said quickly. "It's just an internship."
He jumped as someone knocked on his door. "Come in!" he said, hastily closing his notebook, tapping it with his fingers as the door opened and Dad poked his head around it, his face lighting up as soon as he saw Peter.
"Sure thing," Bucky said as Steve tugged on his arm, practically dragging him towards the exit. "See ya, Mr Stark."
"You guys have something?" he asked.
"Go ahead, J," said Tony.
He had just opened yet another of Bruce's notebooks when JARVIS spoke up.
"Yeah, and now is
Steve's heart gave a lurch as the shiny blue light flickered across the lenses of the glasses, with Peter's eyes going wide a second later.
“You okay to keep going, buddy?” he asked.
“Yes!” Peter exclaimed, launching himself out of his chair and right into Steve’s arms so fast that Steve barely had time to catch him.  Then he buried his face in Steve’s shoulder, his skinny body shaking with happy sobs.  “Yes, Papa,” he said.  “I
Tony sighed as he looked into the shining blue eyes of his husband, eyes that displayed only love, acceptance, and concern in their depths. None of the suspicion and disdain that Tony had seen in his dream.
"Aww, why the hell for?" Clint whined as Natasha started dragging him from the lab. "I like the red so much better…"
"I have been aware of Miss Stacy's presence in the penthouse on a few occasions, yes."
And even less on the man that he loved.
The flight time finished and double-checked, Peter climbed down to the very edge of the rock line and got to work on the repulsors, securing them to his feet and left hand and making one final check of his flight program before stashing his phone into his belt and attaching the fourth repulsor to his right hand. Then he looked out across the fog-drenched water, sucking in a deep, shaky breath.
It wasn't until three days later, in the middle of watching his favourite cartoon show, that Tony discovered the truth.
"You're looking a bit peaky there, kid. Ya hungry?"
"There's no way in hell that I'm going anywhere, Steve," Tony snapped. "There's just no goddamn way. I'm
"Pull up those files that Pete and I used when we replicated the Pym Particle, yeah? I'm specifically looking for Pym's description of the things." There was something on the tip of his brain that he knew might help them, but couldn't for the life of him remember what— "Yep, there it is," he said as the files began scrolling across his screen. "According to Pym, the Pym Particle formula actually alters the relative distance between atoms."
"I'm gonna figure out where they took Papa," Peter said, grabbing his laptops. He quickly pulled up the HYDRA files, selecting the next in line. "And the sooner the better."
, and if that would've happened—"
"Let's not get ahead of ourselves, hmm, Captain Rogers?" added Phillips. "Who knows, you might get up there today and decide that you don't even like how the X-302 flies."
"Well, I'd beg to differ, which is probably not something you're ever gonna want to actually see, so… I'd recommend not arguing with me about your level of perfection and just accept the fact that you are. For everyone's sake."
"1818," answered Ned.
A sharp flash of anger shot through Tony as he watched Steve gulp out of the corner of his eye, his rigid posture not wavering even a millimetre.
But it seemed that the closer Steve and Carol flew towards the barrier, the more intense the barrage became, repeatedly forcing them away from their exit points. Sweat dripped from Steve's forehead into his eyes, his hands gripping his controls so tightly that his knuckles ached as he noticed more aircraft being launched from the Meridian side.
"Both of them already?" asked Steve. "Wow. You guys work fast!"
Peter thought.
“Oh yeah?  Who says I’m not?” demanded Tony.  “If you don't think that Pete’s just as worried about Steve as I am, then you don't know him at all!  And you're forgetting that I’ve already done the whole suicide mission thing more than once, so this’ll be just like another day at the office!”
," said Steve. "They had a vendetta against all three of us."
"Sure there is, it's ten years. But when I was sixteen, I was already—"
"Yeah, but as much as it might be uncomfortable, it's actually good that it is," said Steve. "I'd be worried if we weren't taking this as seriously as we are."
Does that make any sense?"
“You just don't get it, do you,” Tony cut in.  He reached for Steve’s hand again, making a point of intertwining their fingers.  “Post-traumatic stress disorder.  PTSD.  A condition from which, according to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, up to twenty percent of all combat veterans suffer from at some point during their lifetimes.  Now, I know how much you love your numbers, Obie, so let me put it to you this way.  Twenty percent is one person out of every five.  And since right now in this room there are six of us, and two of these men have been diagnosed as suffering from PTSD, then our percentage is even higher.”
"You… flew?" James asked, his eyes as wide as dessert plates. "Like… through space?"
So, a piece of random trivia:  spiders don’t actually have compound vision like most insects, instead they have eight separate eyes.  Since Peter is still mostly human with some spider DNA, it’s always been my headcanon that his vision when unfocused tends to warp into something resembling compound vision, which is exactly how he was able to “read” the HYDRA documents.  😎
"Oh, yeah, I'm sure you are," Lang said, immediately cringing as he glanced between Tony and Steve. "Are you—I mean… oh God, you're not gonna kill me, are you?"
"Uh huh," Peter whispered, blinking back more tears threatening to fall. "I know we will."
Steve rocked forward again, a bit more forcefully this time, then wound his arms around Tony's chest and shifted them so he was mostly on his back, with Tony half on top of him. The change in position caused Steve to slip even deeper inside him, and gave Steve free reign to glide his hands all over Tony's chest, each touch of his fingers like a hot brand on Tony's already overheated skin.
“Thank you, Mr Stark,” she said.  “And Mr Stane’s holding on line three.”
"Yes, well, I'm sure someone of your intelligence would agree that it is unwise to believe everything you read on the internet, wouldn't you, Mr Stark?" said Davis.

asked. "
“Oh, that's good,” said Steve.  “And yeah, I agree.  I don’t think I’ve ever met a more polite child than Peter.”
Nor was he prepared to give in to his panic now.  He was Captain America, for heaven’s sake.  Not some frightened plebe soldier out on his very first mission.
His lips curling into an anticipatory smile, Peter rapped on the door.
Steve shook his head, swiping a wayward tear from his eye. "What's not?"
"All right, J, we're gonna run a full test here," he said. "Nanotech armour."
But then again, none of Peter's classmates' parents were married to Steve Rogers either.
Searing, piercing, throbbing pain, burning across every single nerve fibre in his body and intensified by the faint but piercing constant noise being piped through the speakers mounted in the upper corners of his cell. Even the slight movement of regaining consciousness had been enough to send hot flashes of pain shooting across Steve's body like a million bayonets stabbing him from all directions. His head was pounding like someone was driving into his temple with a jackhammer, his chest crackled and protested with every single shallow inhale, and he was pretty sure that at least a few of the bones in his left foot were broken, if the throbbing keeping time with his heartbeat was any indication.
"Ha, ha, ha," said Dad. "Have you always been this funny, or is that just for today?" He shot Peter a wink as he tightened his tie, grinning when Uncle James retrieved his suit jacket from the bed for him to put on.
"Tony,
But around twenty minutes later, as he held his sleeping husband in his arms, Steve could tell that the dam he'd built to hold back his ever-growing river of fear was already starting to leak. Tony's dreams of losing his family—of losing
"I would generally agree with you, Mr Wilson," said JARVIS. "Be advised, I have adjusted the oven temperatures to reflect this finding."
Tony thought as he gave Senator Davis the same fake smile he reserved for reporters and other members of the press.
He'd need some cover, though.
"Really? That's so cool!" Peter said, his entire face lighting up so fast that it almost startled Steve. He reached underneath his blankets, pulling out a worn, dog-eared notebook and placing it on his lap. "I like to draw too, but my grandpa always says that it's a waste of time, so I don't get to do it much when he's at home."
Anyway. Whoever had missed out on Steve before was now shit out of luck because Tony was not planning on giving him up anytime soon.
Once the food was ready, Steve piled it all onto a tray with two bottles of water and headed for the lab. He found Tony in his usual spot near his main workstation, standing in front of a holographic model of what looked like a larger version of the little round robot vacuum cleaners that Peter had had in his Malibu house bedroom. Tony whipped around as Steve approached, his wide, frantic eyes narrowing into a frown as he noticed the tray in Steve's hands.
"Yeah, yeah, I know," Papa said with a sigh. Peter watched as Dad led Papa towards the living room, setting him up on the couch with his casted foot propped up on a pillow, his sketchbook and the TV remote both within easy reach. A lump rose in Peter's throat as Papa watched Dad head back to his lab to finish his work on the upgraded defence drones, and he glanced at the clock, noting that he had about an hour before the baseball game was due to start.
“Tony looks best naked. Preferably after we’ve just had sex.”
Maybe this was it.
“And you think you can get it?” Pierce laughed. “I’d like to see you try.”
As always, comments/concerns/requests are most welcome! Thanks for reading!
He was warm.
Iron in the blood. Tony called to it, changing it, poisoning the body. That’s how Obi died. That’s how Rogers will die.
And he did. With everything that he had.
Natasha, who was still mulling over the body, stood back with a small sigh. “Fake tooth. Very inconspicuous; no one would even think to look.”
“Thought you could use an office,” he heard Tony say. Steve tried to respond, feeling his mouth open and close a few times, but no words managed to come out, instead opting to explore the new room.
He would save them, this time.
“I’m on a fixed income,” she sobbed. “And if you can’t help me, I don’t know what I’ll do,” she broke off, sobbing into an already damp handkerchief.
Pepper gaped at him. “Take a few days?”
“Your secretary?”
But it never ended there.
Steve crouched down next to Tony. Tony had shut his eyes, waiting for Steve to deliver the final blow. What he wasn’t expecting was a chaste kiss on his lips.
"Haven't you heard?" Stane continued. "You've been convicted for the murder of the upstanding officer of Phillip Coulson."
It wasn’t long before Tony was panting, letting out the occasional soft cry as Steve’s hand twisted right where he wanted. “You’re doing so well,” Steve murmured. “God, you look so beautiful right now, you don’t even know.” Tony felt a flush bloom on his cheeks in response. “I’m going to try for three now, alright?”
Tony bit his lip, feeling a small flush form against his cheeks. It felt wonderful on his frigid skin. He definitely wasn't planning for this type of reunion of The Commandos, if any type at all, but any scenario that he predicted in his head never ended up being welcomed back with open arms.
The blonde Adonis in front of him was definitely not what Tony was expecting.
“There’s nothing to talk about. Get out.”
“Shit,” muttered Clint.
“The answer’s no, buddy. If you think for one second that I’m sticking my neck out for what seems to be your own problem, then you’ve got another thing coming.”
Clint felt Steve try and head for the flames again, but Clint pulled him back down. It was sickening how easily he managed to overpower the man, Steve too lost in his grief and agony to put up a huge fight. He knew that he shouldn't just be sitting there - his mind was screaming at him,
Okay. So. This is that part where you hate me. You need to believe that I didn't mean for this chapter to coincide with this, it just happened this way.
“Yeah.”
“Hi, listen, I need you to patch me through to the NYPD,” Tony responded once he was greeted with the operator. “No, no. If it was an emergency I would have called 911. I’m not looking for a whole squad, I’m just looking for one guy. Phil Coulson.”
Steve spun back around to face the man who was now leaning against the tall crates for support.
Rumlow nodded. He watched as the other man got up and started to pace around the office while Pierce put his face in his hands.
“I can help.”
Rogers tried for years to help get the two out of the city, to get them a better life. Lord knows they deserved it. But the two were stubborn, sticking with their degrading jobs, barely meeting their rent.
“No, I lost it somewhere. I see my bow, but no way I get over there before he blasts me.”
"Ooh, is that coffee? Thank you," he said as he hastily swiped the hot drink right out of Sam's hand.
“Tony,” she answered, a small smile splayed on her face.
Pierce narrowed his eyes. “What makes you so certain?”
Tony raised his eyebrow. “It wasn’t surprise, Cap. I thought you were gonna
Steve’s head snapped back towards his son. “They caught you on tape and you still got away with it? You must have been booking it! How fast do you think you were going? You think you could do it again in the lab?”
Finally the door opened. Inside, Barnes could see his present self strapped to an operating table, being cut apart by a doctor.
Tony picked his head up to meet piercing blue eyes. “Really?”
“Goodnight, Steve.”
“Steve, you’re not even looking.”
“Aha!” Tony cried, poking Steve in the stomach. “Sociopath. I knew it.”
But, hey! Look! New characters! Take this as a distraction from how much a salty move that cliffhanger/three week long break was. (If you can't tell, this is me trying to get back into your good graces. I'm a terrible baker, so I can't offer comfort food... this will have to do.)
she’d thought a lot about what she’d lost. She’d chastised herself for days –
"I said, he's with me," Tony snapped. He pulled Steve away from them, dragging him back into the elevator, fingers jamming the 'Close Door' button before the rest of his security could follow.
“You’re in the med bay. Do you remember what happened?”
Tony sat, taking another generous sip from his tumbler, wishing it was something way stronger as Barnes stared at him from the other side of his desk. Tony gestured with the glass, a silent invitation, but Barnes shook his head. “Doesn’t go with pain meds,” he bit out.
“No,” Thor answered, dropping Loki’s dinner off on the small table.
The Captain ran a hand through his hair, sighing. “Alright, we’ll find The Monger another way.” He looked back to the rest of his men. “Get your feelers out. The Monger may be our next link to the man puppeteering HYDRA.”
Bucky nodded. “Good; let’s keep it that way. Keep him safe, okay?”
Tony scoffed. “What are you talking about?”
“Clint.”
don’t do this.”
Pepper stuttered, round eyes never leaving the reactor. “Are you sure?
“No, you’re perfect,” Tony argued. “You’re the most qualified, trustworthy person I’ve ever met.” Pepper’s gaze softened slightly, but she still made no move to continue. His chest throbbed in response, urging him of the task at hand. “Is it too much to ask?” he added, giving Pepper his best puppy eyes. "Because I really need your help here.”
While most of The Commandos strength came from being such a close knit bunch, it was also their downfall. They didn’t do the whole grief thing well. Even a simple injury could lead to a spiral of murderous rage from a fellow Commando. But this was a completely different monster. It was strange, considering is wasn't as if their job description didn't include death. But after defeating HYDRA the first time, it was if they were riding an elongated high. They were untouchable, invincible to both crime and the law. And all it had taken was one night, one push of a simple button, and their entire world had been decimated. And while the blinding horror and rage had been replaced with giddy relief - the foundations of their life as they new it still stubbornly standing - the threat was still there. This bomb was only the beginning - and while they wouldn't be burying anyone tonight, no one will come out of it unscathed. The veil had been pulled back, the glass shattered around them. Tonight was the first glimpse of a potential and very harrowing future. His friends near death was one thing, but it had only been mere hours and Clint was lost in the city, unable to reach the rest of his team, unable to figure out what step is next.
“Okay, so we go farther. Medical equipment, transport capability, clean energy. How’s that for need? People
“That’s not the point, Steve!"
“Get your shit together,” Fury added. “I’ve dealt with children more mature than you.” With a final shake of his head, the screen darkened, disconnected by their frustrated boss.
“Sorry, no can do,” retorted Steve, sticking his chin at.
Tony groaned, stretching his limbs across the expansive bed, fingers digging into the silk sheets. His eyes fluttered open, barely glancing at the lofted ceiling above him before his head was turning, gaze following to the other side of the bed.
“Speaking of said road trip,” Sam answered. “Should I even bother with a ‘
Tony rushed around the other side of the island but here was there, hands grabbing at his wrists, and they were warm, just like
“It was my favorite story when I was growing up.”
Tony always knew he wouldn’t make it to an old age. While Tony had never made a full on commitment to any mob, he had done a few ‘consultations’ here and there. The whole, ‘I scratch your back if your scratch mine’ kind of deal. Tony makes a few improvements on weapons or even gives away a few whispers of information in exchange for street protection for him and his people.
groaned and shook as they approached. Panicked visions of Tony caught in the debris, and suffocating underneath raced through Steve’s mind as he charged through the open doorway without so much as a second thought. The sight that he was met with, however, was nothing that he could have ever imagined.
He felt Tony reach over to the side of the bed, pulling back a condom to thrust into Steve’s hand. “
scream – as he whipped around, a hand already over his arc reactor while the other grasped for the gun he knew he didn’t have on him.
“Ah, Mr. Stark. You look like you’re feeling better.”
“Steve!”
“I’m here because I’m a genius and I hacked into the FBI database to find Clint. How the hell did you find him?”
At first Clint thought that that ‘
No. Tony was fine. He had promised Steve he wouldn’t leave. If anything, Steve was pretty sure that Tony would outlive death just to get a final laugh in. So, no. Tony is alive.
He’d survived. He’d survived for Steve.
Steve stepped forward immediately. “Nice to meet you. My name is- ”
“What, are you jealous, Stark?” Thor retorted with a smirk and a raised eyebrow.
“I do not take orders from you, Captain.”
Making up his mind, Steve surged forward, capturing Tony’s lips in his own.
Tony whirled around, raising an eyebrow. “A picnic? Are those even a thing anymore?”
“Yes,” answered a disheveled looking Maria Hill. “No one else was near the explosion.”
“Religiously,” Fury sighed. “His devices have every podcast downloaded. Our tech guys say he’s listened to every episode, a few multiple times. They say he’s even posted on your website before, anonymously, of course. We think he may have even called in before. Congratulations, you have a fan.”
“You can’t keep saying no to them.”
“What? You got him?” Tony startled out of his own head.
His friend seemed more than happy to comply, the pair tearing out the rear door, listening to the sounds of more police piling into the front. They hopped fences, sneaked through alleyways, and at one point, hid in a dumpster to ensure that they’d finally slipped the cops.
“It’s my face, Nat. I can’t help how it looks.”
Tony flinched at the broken tone. He hadn’t thought about Clint being in the room.
Steve paused a final time, hand hovering over the door handle. He’d made a lot of stupid decisions this year, but this would take the cake. But he knew that he was going to do it anyway. Stupid or not, Steve knew it was the only chance he had to get Phil back and secure the rest of his family. He just hoped that what he had to offer was enough to get everything he wanted in return. Nodding to himself, Steve turned the knob and opened the door, stepping through the threshold.
“And you gave them your name? Why?”
Did it matter now?
He couldn’t tell over the roar of the flames.
He walked through the rotting buildings, idling left as his memory took over, leading him to the vault of information. A concrete construction loomed in front of him, looking just as it did all those years ago when Phillips brought him here for the first time.
against his lips.
Steve took a deep breath, readying his shield. He wouldn’t let him get past, wouldn’t let him get to Tony.
Bucky blatantly ignored the look he got from Steve.
“And as soon as he so as much opens his mouth, put a bullet through his brain. That will send a message.”
“What are you doing here?” Pepper’s voice pulled him from his thoughts.
Bucky clapped a hand on Steve’s shoulder. “Then trust that we wouldn’t change our minds either, Steve. It doesn’t matter how bad this is going to get for us. We’re not leaving. It’s time to get your head out of your ass, because you’re stuck with us. You might as well work with us.”
They were headed south, out of Manhattan, but that was all Steve knew, and he couldn’t muster up the courage to ask. For what seemed like years later, Tony finally pulled next to the curb. He had barely stopped the car before Steve stumbled out, desperate for fresh air. He looked around the street to realize they were in Brooklyn.
Steve could see the surprise grace her face before the stony gaze returned. “Why does that matter?”
Bucky nodded again. Steve had spent years keeping them corralled, keeping them
“Tasha,” Bucky snapped beside him.
"I wasn't asking."
Tony signed, unbuttoning his shirt, letting Obie’s face be washed in a soft hue of blue.
Tony chuckled quietly, waving his hand for Pepper to walk over.
“I’m fine, Cap,” Barton slurred out.
Well, I'm back.
He heard Barnes huff. “You’re one crazy son of a bitch, Stark.”
“Alright, no need to be an ass.” The blonde engulfed Sam in a tight hug. “I’ll see you soon.”
Tony scoffed. “Like JARVIS would ever report to you.”
“Fuck science, Tony, I’m not going to the hospital tonight!”
“I need it out of the way,” Tony clarified. “I want you to reach down and gently lift the wire out.”
The fire was gone, but the weight remained.
“Oh, are you too busy right now?” Steve snapped, unable to hold the remark in. “Of course you are, you’re always busy. God forbid we have a conversation about this, and- ”
Tony Stark dismantling The Commandos from the inside, playing the victim card. Plant one bomb and suddenly you’re just an innocent. Stark had connections, and Lord knows how dramatic that man was when he wanted to be. He inserts his way into Steve’s side, and soon HYDRA would know anything and everything about them.
Steve was surprised that it was the little things that hit him the hardest as he tried to adjust to the new century.
“I think I can clear my schedule.”
“Well, we can’t exactly go and straight up tell him what we’ve been doing,” countered Clint. “He’d take off for Stark first chance he’d get, and who knows how many men HYDRA have waiting just for him to show his face back in Manhattan.”
He should’ve known.
The thing about being a mailman, or even a fake one at that, is that sometimes they have heavy mail days. Which means that certain buildings can receive more than one package in one day.
“Use your head,” replied Bucky, swatting Steve in the back of the skull. “Stark’s been missing almost all week and we haven’t heard a peep from his company. Don’t you think it’s odd that no one thought to ask about the man whose name is on the side of the building?”
Bucky had meant.
“Wow,” he said loudly. “Great find, Nat. Don’t worry, Cap, we’ll take care of them. How about- ”
Arms were tugging at him, but he refused to move. He screamed, but the man he wanted to answer wasn’t listening.
“Well we can’t just sit back and do nothing!” Sam shouted. “The reason he isn’t telling us is because he’s thinking about doing something stupid. We’ve been sitting on this too long; we need to act now.”
“And what if we offer you something better?” Tony questioned.
Tony tilted his head up to look at him, his teeth digging into his bottom lip to keep from smiling. His eyes sparkled in the daylight, the ambers and golds twinkling with mischief and happiness.
Rogers looked at the floor. “He, uh, he didn’t talk about you much.”
He threw open the door, almost tripping over a pair of bodies. For a moment, Clint saw red, thinking them to be bodies of other Commandos. Looking back down, Clint was relieved to see that they were Hammer’s men.
“I could ask the same of you,” Phil answered.
“-don’t know what I would have done if- ”
“Well, I didn’t exactly know about you! Besides, I don’t actually work for your boss. I just scratch his back and he scratches mine.”
Yinsen shot him an unimpressed look. “You know that is not what I meant.”
It wasn’t long until he found it was him, crying hoarsely into Clint’s shoulder as he willed himself to stand back up.
“We don’t need to do anything!” Tony shouted, hands shaking violently. He was twitchy, bouncing between each of his feet and hands wringing his wrists nervously, as if the thought of an argument was sending him into a conniption. “Let’s just move on, and- ”
Clint could never read Fury, but now he could tell that the man was not happy about his little vacation. But he would deal with that later.
Natasha was left alone at the café table. It wasn’t their fault; they didn’t know about her interrogation techniques. They probably wouldn’t approve anyway.
Steve scoffed. “Don’t be overdramatic. And I’m not planning. It’s happening.”
But Steve glared back at him before pulling he reached over the back counter and pulled out his shield. He smirked before throwing it at Rogers. Rogers barely had time to duck out of the way, flinging himself outside through a window.
Stark shot him an unimpressed glance. “Someone’s got to watch out for you, ya big lug. Can’t have you dozing off when the real battle begins.” He smirked, gaze Steve his customary salute, and slipped out the door.
“But it is about my podcast?” Steve asked.
“Loki, try to see sense here.”
“Steve,” Natasha whispered, pointing back over to the pile of their fallen comrades. Red lights, blinking in time to the beeps, bled through the spaced between the bodies.
He turned the corner and-
“No, no, no!” the boy protested. “You don’t have to worry about training me! I know all of your moves, your shield, fighting style, catchphrases, you name it! I’m your biggest fan!”
So it was nice, Tony being here. Everyone has been tiptoeing around him since what happened.
Tony sighed, eyes sweeping the room idly, trying not to think of the ropes rubbing along his wrists.
“There’s nothing wrong with me,” Steve grit out.
Wanda looked over at Pietro, having a silent conversation.
Steve just laughed, grabbing his jacket, already pushing Sam back out the door. “Alright, we’ll be back!” his husband called over his shoulder.
“To what do I owe the pleasure of your company?” Fury pressed. “Stark, I believe you had something to say.”
“Tony we need to talk about this!” Bucky added.
“Missed you,” Tony slurred in response. God, his mouth tastes horrible. When did he eat copper?
His men pulled back as he walked through, making space so Steve could sit at his usual chair at the head of the room. He sat down, immediately resting his head in his hand, waiting for Bucky to shut the door and squeeze through the room to sit at Steve’s right.
"How do you think?" Bucky couldn't help but snap.
Steve looked back. “We’re all bad news, Sam.”
“Right,” Bucky drawled. “No more risk than an illegal road trip with your criminal mastermind of a boyfriend.”
Lo and behold, it was mere seconds before Barnes came charging around the corner they’d just come from, other steps sounding not far behind him. Without a moment’s hesitation, Barton charged around the corner pointing the barrel down at Barnes.
“No, Steve, I- ”
was not only regarding Extremis. There was so much to talk about, so much that they had missed, but Steve wasn’t going to touch it. Not now. Tony wasn’t the only one keyed up, wounds raw and open. There was so much to be said and done, but they were in the eye of the hurricane now. The worst seemed to be behind them, and all that was left could be battled together. Steve gathered Tony closer and closed his eyes, feeling Bucky reflect his motions.
But isn’t that what he was? Tony was an associate, nothing more than a business partner. Complete the transaction and each would go on their merry way, never to cross paths again.
What shocked Steve even more was that Tony just nodded, and said he’ll make a better one. Tony never let anyone criticize his work. Of course, being the genius that he is, Tony never really has to worry about that. Everything he makes works perfectly, and maybe it’s just his ego, but no one was allowed to bash Stark designs without the engineer’s fury.
“Down the hall,” whispered Yinsen. “It looks like a bomb went off.”
Pepper walked over slowly, looking at the new reactor Tony was holding in his hand. “Why?” she asked.
consider that edible.”
“Thank fuckin’ Christ,” Bucky moaned, hopping down from the shelf he was sat atop.
Regardless of their current standings, however, there had been more than one instance that the powers were drawn together to defeat a common foe. And as of right now, there wasn't a better cause for the two to fight for. One that they had let run wild for too long.
Tony sighed. “Not now, JARVIS.”
Of course, in the end it didn’t matter.
“Hawkeye. I need you.”
Clint pulled back enough to look at Stark Industries. Pepper wouldn’t lie about this. Not about Tony. He took a deep breath, standing back up. He had been given a second chance. Tony’s life was once again cradled in Clint’s hands. He would not fail.
Clint beamed at Steve. "Nat caught wind of a huge score. Word on the street is that Hammer is trying to drive a huge weapons deal with some other mob. Her sources said that they're still working out the kinks of the deal, so the weapons are just sitting around in some storage facility."
The Captain was cut off by a shrill tone of Tony’s phone. He jumped, immediately scrambling to get it, pointedly ignoring the glares he was receiving from everyone. Pulling the phone out, he saw it was Pepper.
Steve kicked the man, relishing in the pained grunt. “I know you’re lying to me. That’s okay, though. You see, I was lying too. You don’t get to leave. You don’t get the pleasure of a coward’s death. Sorry, Justin. Looks like you’re stuck in here with me.”
Pierce dropped to the floor. Natasha gaped, watching the man gasp, his body twitching a few times before slumping, face going still, a final “Hail HYDRA,” slipping from his lips. Blood pooled out behind him, spreading over the NYPD crest that was inlaid in the carpet. He was dead. It was over.
Steve thought to himself. The final moments before the end. It had been hard enough to say his goodbyes to Bruce and Thor, hell, he could barely meet Clint’s eyes. Pulling away from Tony had been damn near impossible. But this? He saw Bucky clap Sam on the back and whisper something in his ear before he moved over to Natasha, gathering her in his arms.
So, no, waiting it out was not an option. Besides, he'd probably never get a chance like this again. This was his only chance to make it back home. And if he died in the process? Well, it will probably be a quicker way to go than whatever The Rings would cook up for him if he did nothing.
Barnes tried to push forward, only to stop again. Looking down in horror, he saw his fingers start to disappear.
“Congratulations,” Steve chuckled. “You just discovered your prostate.”
he tried to convey.
“I can’t believe you made me get rid of my stash,” a new voice said. Clint strode into the room, also stopping in front of Tony and swiping his new mug. This time, Tony didn’t get a chance to complain before Bucky punched Clint in the arm hard, the archer whining as he returned the mug to Tony.
Steve shrugged. “Improving, I think.”
this is- ”
Which is where he was now. He needed to find his future self. If he found him, Steve still had time to kill him, and he could get out of this whole mess. Fury would forgive him.
“You look like you could use a nap,” the brunette smiled,
Tony barely had time to think before he entered the fray himself, pulling a man off Steve's back onto the ground. Of course, it was no time before he felt himself being overpowered. He hadn't had his gun, and Tony was in no shape for dealing with a small army.
“Oh, Tony,” Steve murmured, stepping out to bundle the smaller man in his arms, before freezing. “Can I hug you?” he asked.
“You really thing you can make this right?” Hill continued. “You and your loop have already caused SHIELD too much trouble. There is no coming back from this.”
The Captain shook his head. “Not much, just a name. He calls himself ‘The Monger’. Ring any bells with anyone?”
But, Tony had stood through the entire meeting. And The Captain was a no show. Tony, of course, received no messages from the man for an explanation. Not that he was expecting one anyway; the blonde had told Tony that they couldn’t risk any forms of communication until their public stunt was over. Tony was worried, sure, but he trusted that The Captain would hold up his end of the bargain.
Rhodey hummed. “More like keeping you on house arrest for the foreseeable future.”
“Only five you say? Did you even break a sweat?” Tony smiled.
Tony rubbed his temple, groaning softly. Seeing Happy hooked up to God knows how many hospital tubes did no favors for him. After triple checking that he would be receiving the best medical care and that Pepper was fine, Tony let himself return home.
“No, no, no,” Tony corrected. “It’s Sebastian, now,” he chuckled.
“Make him not the smartest guy in the room. He needs to know he’s not the only person with powerful friends.”
flight response. Steve would never back down from a fight, whether it be against the fiercest of villains, or arguing with Tony over sleep habits. He would always give it his all; Steve never half-assed anything. But, not many people know that afterwards Steve was prone to fleeing into a sulk. A lot of the times it was over civilian casualties, team injuries, sometimes his own behavior. Even with all his strength, even Captain America can’t hold the weight of the world on his shoulders.
Tony shook his head. "There's a first time for everything."
Tony chose to protect the group, agreeing with Phil to keep them in the dark, and away from the FBI. Sacrificing Phil’s freedom to do so.
“I wish we could,” Steve sighed remorsefully. “We planned on getting here yesterday, but the storms slowed us down. We knew we needed to see you, but we’ve gotta stick to our timetable.”
It did almost kill them. The flight was long and excruciating, regardless of the fact that the quinjet’s superior design chopped a few hours off total airtime, as compared to a standard airplane. Steve tried everything as a distraction – and while some worked for a bit, the spell was broken every time by Tony making the slightest of moves. Which, knowing their hyperactive boyfriend, was every few minutes. He prattled between the cockpit and the hull, chatting with Clint about the new interface it had, to discussing a science journal he and Bruce were reading. He even decided that it was a good time to look at a slight operation snag in Natasha’s Bites that happened in the field. Apparently looking at an operational snag meant that he had to take the entire thing apart, with only his hands again –
“Tony, please, just listen.”
The song referenced by Riley is actually real, called Blood on the Risers. Para-jumpers used to sing it all the time during World War II. It's super haunting.
He could see Natasha tilt her head slightly, no doubt running through options of what to say next, but Bucky popped his head it and stalled the game. “You guys comin’? We’re ready to go.”
The ding from the elevator sounded like a death bell tolling, causing Steve to jump. The doors slid open and the pair stepped out to see a plethora of cubicles, all cleared out. On the far wall stood a single door, closed, staring back at Steve ominously.
Phil just shrugged. “Crispell showed up. I heard the door and assumed it was him, so I thought I’d hide. Figured you wouldn’t want him to catch me lounging in your bed.”
Before he could change his mind, Tony pressed down on the buzzer, sending a signal to Steve. It was moments later when he heard the front door lurch open, feet pounding up the stairs.
Sam jumped into action immediately, his wings slipping out into their full span as he flew into the air, catching the plate easily and landing with a tucked roll. The kids squealed in delight but Tony shot him an unimpressed look.
Tony took a deep breath, finally pulling away from Steve.
“You’re not joking.”
They could both see it, the end on each horizon. HYDRA was closing in, backing them into a corner that was surrounded by FBI. The rock and the hard place that would eventually be the death of all of them.
“Oh please,” Tony countered. “You should’ve thanked us. You probably filled up all the confessionals with all those women thinking about what you do in your space time. You could’ve gotten a lot of free dates.”
“You’re not looking.”
“Absolutely not,” snapped Clint.
“And you sure the FBI can’t track this?”
"But I didn't shoot the gun!" the foreigner snarled, hands slapping against the metal bars.
Clint looked over at Tony. Of course Tony would figure it out. Clint tried to curl himself into a smaller ball. Getting chewed out by Steve was bad enough, but no one was as bad as Tony. Tony was a spit fire; the sharp businessman could reduce anyone to a quivering mess in seconds. Clint wasn’t going to make it out of here alive.
Steve was the one to finally break the silence. "I never said I was sorry."
Steve clenched his jaw. “I’ve got a good memory.”
“A name, Captain!” The knife cut deeper, showing bone. Tony gurgled, closing his eyes in resignation. “Do it,” their captor said to the guard. Steve stared as the machete was raised high into the air, one guillotine slice away from making Tony an amputee.
Steve froze and closed his eyes, a tortured expression stealing over his face. “Come on,” he rasped out. “Let’s get you to bed.”
Bucky stirred after a couple of hours; groaning and whimpering intermittently as he tried to get up from the floor. Steve could only watch helplessly from his pallet, the thin blanket he’d wrapped around himself barely able to hold the worst of the cold at bay.
He was small and dainty; slender but he appeared to have good muscle-tone underneath the blue, threadbare muslin cassock and waistcloth. His black hair was gathered into a simple ponytail at the back of his neck and he was completely unadorned. Steve had never seen an omega without any jewelry, ornamental bands or chains, but the lack of finery did nothing to diminish the sheer prettiness of that gorgeous face and body.
“He won’t kill anyone if he’s left for dead,” Tony said. “Now, get everything ready and send Loki here; last I saw Patrick was with him.”
“Tripe about omegas,” Steve replied grimly. “They’ve been saying to him that omegas can’t sign up for drafting or fight in the army, among other things. And he’s listened.”
The crazy son of a bitch nursed grand delusions of starting a whole new race of super-people – bred from the best men and women they could get a hold of. The fact that most of the people were blond and blue-eyed wasn’t even the most disturbing part.
Steve leaned back and took Tony’s face in his hands, softly encouraging Tony to look at him until he could stare deep into Tony’s eyes, thumbs stroking wet cheeks lovingly.
Steve spat on the dirty floor, muck coating every surface but the ceiling. His father had done the right thing putting a stop to Schmidt’s experimentations, although Steve would’ve been happier if his father could’ve killed him instead of sending the mad man into exile.
He stared after Tony when he went, longing so deep it hurt gripping his heart. What would he do if Tony never said yes? What would he do with the rest of his life if he didn’t get to have Tony at his side? Steve refused to let thoughts like that get a grip on him. He would win Tony over; he would show Tony how serious he was about changing the laws and that he could make Tony happy. Tony would never have to look at Steve with doubt or worry, he would make sure of it.
Bruce had been gone for the day, with Natasha - who he’d befriended back at the feast - no doubt, and Jarvis was out of town for the last two weeks. Tony had no one he could ask for help and even though he knew better than to move around when he was putting out Heat pheromones like they were going out of style, he’d had no choice.
Tony pointed at him, annoyed. “That may be true but you’d accept so who’s the loser here, huh?”
“This is your doing,” Tony accused. “Loki, of all people, would never write a letter to me and all but tell me I’m going, with Patrick, and staying there for a few weeks.”
“Hello,” Tony said, forcing himself to sound calm and professional, which was hard for him even on the best of days. A people-person he was not; he knew himself well enough to admit that.
“While Bruce is my brother from another mother and he’s awesome, I think I’ve found my platonic life-partner. He knows calculus, Steve. Calculus!”
“It would seem like I am at your mercy, Consort Stark,” Steve whispered hoarsely.
“You ready?” Steve asked, hands gripping his buttocks firmly, spreading them wide and making Tony’s eyes roll into the back of his head as cool air whiffed against his puffy entrance.
“I do trust you, Tony,” Steve entreats sincerely. “I trust you with my life and so much more.”
“No, it’s not,” Patrick echoed hotly. “This is what I was talking about, Peter. You can’t go around playing pranks on me or other people It’s unbecoming of a prince and- “
When Rhodes delivered Tony back as promised exactly an hour later, Tony had dubbed his escort
“Steve!” Tony sobbed so hard it racked his whole body. He shuddered as Steve, with his gentle hands and gentle voice, lifted him up and held him close to his chest. He couldn’t tell who was shaking worse, him or Steve, but he cuddled up close in an attempt to burrow under Steve’s skin as he was carried inside.
The cathedral and churches all over Manhattan united in the revelry and people out in the streets cheered loudly, relieved to have a king once more.
Was he talking out loud?
No, he didn’t.
“No thank you, your Highness, but I appreciate the assist. I could’ve taken Rumlow, just had to get my bearings after that blow.”
“If we cut them off at this canyon, we can effectively herd them against the river through this small passage here.” Natasha pointed at the map spread out in front of them. “We’ll bottleneck them here and they’ll be forced to fight a losing battle or drown in the river.”
What words Tony didn’t know, but it was endearing all the same. This was so far removed from what he remembered of that tournament, where he’d seen the prince for the first time.
“I know his name.”
The stroke of your touch,
Time seemed to slow down, seconds stretching out into eons, reaching for a forever out of reach horizon, where the end of the night was on the other side. Steve undid Tony’s loincloth with worshipful hands, lips and tongue following every dip and curve and straining muscle he could reach from lying underneath, like it was the first time, making Tony moan and swear and beg in a never-ending plea for more pleasure, more pressure – just
“I wager it will only take Hani another hour to charm your king into bed, don’t you think?” Stone’s smooth voice drops an octave lower, rumbling in Tony’s ear and making goosebumps of revulsion break out across his back when the other alpha comes impossibly closer, his chest a hair’s breadth from touching Tony’s arm.
An embarrassed flush slowly replaced the rosy glow of arousal on Steve’s neck and face and it was typical Steve to get bashful about voicing his fantasies while still balls deep in Tony’s ass.
“I won’t be at the fore, Steve,” Tony assured him gently. “I’ll keep myself in a safe spot and lead from there. Our men will understand.”
“Aye,” Thor said and took Tony’s hand, laying the softest of kisses on the back of it. His long beard and moustache tickled. “I would be honored if you’d join me in a dance, Omega Stark.”
"All right. And do you have any new theories as to what they might've been doing here?" Steve asked.
"What?" Tony yelped as a bolt of pain shot up his left arm. "Now wait just a goddamn minute here! Why all of a sudden is this considered more of an Avengers-level event than the actual attack from space?"
His voice trailed off as he pushed himself up off the chair and shuffled towards the bathroom, but Tony caught his meaning anyway.
He was still finding it difficult to wrap his mind around it. Being stuck inside that HYDRA bunker with no windows and no concept of day or night, Steve hadn't realised just how much time had actually passed until Tony informed him that they had been looking for him for almost a month.
A loud snorting sound broke him from his thoughts, and he glanced over at Grandpa, barely suppressing a giggle as he shifted slightly and his mouth dropped open.
Phillips jerked his head, indicating the still-open door. "Get that closed, Captain."
"Oh, you know," he said quickly. "Patrols and more patrols. I'm starting a new class tomorrow though, so maybe things'll get switched up a bit."
"Try not to worry, Стиви, yeah?" Bucky whispered as Peter and Gwen stepped up to the curb, waiting for the light to change. "I'll keep a close eye on him."
“Well, sweetheart,” Steve said as the group started filing into the restaurant, offering Tony his arm.  “Shall we?”
"But—but—!" Steve sputtered, rapidly shaking his head. "Tony, if Smythe was really placed there at the school to stalk Peter, then why hasn't he tried something by now? He's already been there for a few weeks! And who exactly forced Principal Morita to hire him in the first place? And are we absolutely sure we can trust the FBI? I mean, they still won't give us all that much information on Toomes, and—"
Thor also had taken to teasing Peter rather mercilessly about his friend Gwen, even going so far as to ask Peter what his intentions were the last time she was over, and then volunteering to speak to Chief Stacy on Peter's behalf when Peter ended up blushing and stammering too hard to answer.
Tony pursed his lips, his eyebrows knitting together into a severe frown. It really was ridiculous, and he knew it. He knew that Steve loved him beyond reason no matter what, scars and all. He had absolutely no reason at all to doubt him.
"I wish I could agree with you," Peter murmured into her hair, her gorgeous, silky blonde hair that always smelled like honeysuckle and something else that he couldn't quite place. Sandalwood, maybe? Whatever it was, it was glorious, and apparently just what he needed at the moment. He breathed in deeply, feeling his tense muscles relax just enough to un-numb his toes and slightly lessen the tight pain across his shoulder blades.
"Danvers here in Phoenix Two," said Carol.
"Oh thank
"Oh wow, is it really that time already?" Steve asked. Of course he'd noticed that the weather was cooling down and the days were getting shorter, but somehow the last five months or so had seemed to pass both at a snail's pace and in the blink of an eye, and that both surprised and unnerved Steve. He didn't enjoy being so jarred by something as simple as the passage of time. It tended to remind him far too much of waking up alone in that mockup 1940s hospital room back in the old SHIELD headquarters, not realising that he'd just been asleep for the last sixty-plus years.
"No, it's not." Peter let out a heavy sigh, punctuated by another wet cough as he glanced up at Steve. "So how come you're not at work?"
“S’eve?” Tony suddenly mumbled, so softly that Steve barely heard him. His eyelids fluttered, trying to open. “S’eve, where’s Pete? Is he—is he—?”
“Ahh, you might wanna save that kind of chitchat for after practise,” Tony cuts in.  He shoots Peter a fond look, mussing up his rather wild curls.  “Trust me.  You get this kid talking about anything that happened at school, or anywhere else, for that matter, and you’d better be prepared to hunker down and stay awhile.  And probably order some food while you're at it.”
"I'm not acting like you're breaking up with me," he said through clenched teeth. "I'm only—"
“That sounds like something Obie would say,” he said to his cereal bowl, so quietly that Tony had to strain to hear him.
"She's the green lady," Peter said, correctly reading Tony's confusion. He leaned closer, lowering his voice. "And I think she and the Quill dude are a couple."
"It's been his only goal for years," added Gamora. "And one that he'll stop at nothing to achieve."
"And run another diagnostic on your security systems once that's done, just to be extra safe."
Steve's smile grew wider as his eyes scanned the length of Tony's body, his fingers ghosting down Tony's side until he reached underneath him to press their hips together. Tony moaned as his legs instinctively wrapped around Steve's waist, craving more of his touch, more of his taste, more of his scent.
The shed light was on. Tony doesn’t use the shed.
When he heard someone walking to the door, he hid behind a trash can.
Steve just hummed, not taking his eyes off the man that lay next to him.
Pepper looked down at the package. “Yea, sure, not a problem. Who is it from?”
“Great,” Tony sighed, crossing his arms. “He’s going to leave me for a mutt.” He stepped around Steve and the dog, pointing a finger in Lucky’s direction when he followed Tony’s movements. “Don’t even think about it,” he said. “I will not be pulling your hair off of my clothes for the next three weeks.”
Tony didn’t even acknowledge the snide comment. He couldn’t focus, he couldn’t think, he couldn’t
But Tony? Tony wasn’t any of them.
“Where the hell have you been?!”
Tony froze. “What. Deal.”
Phil shrugged. “I understand that you’re upset and you’re worried. I just think it’s very interesting that you can claim that what he did was foolish and put the family at risk, when you’re here doing the exact same.”
“Maria, please. Leave Tony out of this. It’s me you want. Listen, I’ve got silver stashed away. You let Tony go, as soon as we kill my loop I’ll give it to you. To Fury, SHIELD, I don’t care! Anything to make it right again.”
“Did you say
Tony heard the man scoff. “I asked if you were ready to have a serious conversation with me yet.”
“Two.”
Delmar looked away from Rogers to see Black Widow walking over. She smiled icily at him, giving a small wave.
“They wouldn’t. Because it’s not HYDRA,” Steve whispered.
“Steve- ”
he thought to himself.
“What or Earth were you thinking? You could have hurt yourself!”
It only accomplished making Steve more worried about the thoughts he’d had earlier in bed. Something was very wrong.
Tony rubbed his eyes, forcing himself out of his thoughts. “Yea, Happy?”
Strong hands brought his head back up. “Clint, sweetheart. Are you okay?”
He readied his shield, aiming at the empty white tarp lying on the ground.
Tony stumbled back the way had come, much more slowly as the added weight of Barnes and oxygen deprivation caught up with him.  When Tony finally managed to find the stairs again, he barely had time to reach for the suitcase when a second blast rippled through the building. Tony immediately brought Barnes under him, using his body as a shield as a few more chunks of scrap came falling down. Groaning, Tony looked up only to gasp. Another huge groan echoed through the building, Tony watching in horror as the rest of the ceiling started to collapse, the stress too much from the second blast.
The Captain reached forward and grabbed the man by his shoulders. It seemed as if he was just as distressed as Tony about hearing the confirmation of HYDRA, if not more so. “Who the hell are you?”
It all depended on what Steve wanted them to be, whatever he was in the mood for. His imagination ran wild, generating stories and adventures for each of the molds, always ready in that old shoe box for when Steve needed an escape.
What immediately caught his gaze, leaving him frozen on the couch, was the huge collage that sat across from him. Pictures for every occasion filled Tony’s eye line; some taken recently while others showed the signs of age. Newspaper clippings were tacked alongside them, telling the tales of the Captain and his men. It was so domestic; almost as if a proud dad had taken their A+ reports and put them on the refrigerator for everyone else to see. The rest of the wall was covered in artwork, obviously the work of The Captain. The scenes took many mediums, ranging from thick sketch pads to scraps of paper to napkins from a random diner, as if Cap had grabbed whatever was around to catch the perfect moment. It was so real, so
“You got it, Ms. Potts.”
Fury dropped another file on the bed, this one largely overstuffed and worn, like it’d been gone through each day.
Tony barked out a laugh. “Who, me? I haven’t broken any laws.”
Tony learning his name could be disastrous. Steve had just barely been able to regain the ground he had lost after his misstep with Thor. Dropping another bomb like that on Tony would probably send the man out the door for good. Steve wouldn’t risk that; not after everything they’ve been through.
“Relax, Stark, he’s fine,” Natasha drawled. “Not sure why he didn’t pick up the phone,” she accused, looking back to Steve.
the man hissed out, before leaving the room, slamming the door behind him.
“I didn’t know he likes fishing.”
“Tony!” Obie roared, his own repulsors shooting the debris off him.
But even once Tony was on his feet again, karma reared its ugly head yet again. God forbid he ever get what he wanted. Everything that happened came in quick succession, like dominoes falling one after the other, keeping the mob more than busy. Even when they were able to catch moments alone, Steve would slow any kiss that Tony gave him, and bundled him in his arms until they both fell asleep. It wasn’t as if that wasn’t also what Tony wanted, but leave it to Steve to wait until their last night together to finally snap.
The man slumped back on his heels, slumping in relief. “Thank God,” he whispered. “You gotta stop doing that, man. That’s twice in one day,” he snapped. “I’d rather die by an explosion than have to deal with Steve.”
“I trust your judgement.”
The three of them peered back down the hall, at the door of Steve's continually silent office. Within the room sat their boss, most likely in the same position that he was in the last time Clint went in to check on him. The same position he'd been in for days. Sitting in his desk chair and staring at an unseen scene in front of him.
“You clean up quick, Cap,” Tony smirked, eyeing the bar again.
Seriously, that man could put a mother bear in its place. Of course, he was exactly the same when the team was dealing with HYDRA the first time. Sure, Steve hadn’t known half of the people for more than a week before their final showdown with HYDRA, but Steve had never faltered in treating everyone like family. That’s what Clint loved most about Steve. He was so genuine, so loyal; everyone had a place in The Commandos. Clint couldn’t hear, Dernier struggled with English, hell, Nat probably wasn’t a US citizen at the time, but Steve didn’t care.
Unless they were something that Tony Stark was afraid of.
Steve’s brow furrowed, meeting Bruce’s equally confused stare. “What do you mean?”
Bucky let out an
Steve’s eyes snapped open, looking back at The Skull and the muzzle of the gun, which was aimed at him feet.
Tony had dropped him off; he didn’t question Steve when he asked for time alone.
“You have a real knack for sweeping me off my feet,” he replied with a wink.
Steve hissed, smacking his shoulder sharply. When he turned back, the woman was already gone. He could practically hear her fuming a few aisles over.
There were crashes in the background, and he could hear shouts of distress. “Pepper? Pepper!” He shot a frantic look to Clint. “Get me there, now.”
“Well, you’re not a ray of sunshine yourself, Barton.”
No, Tony could not lose Steve. He would do anything to keep him safe. Like flirting with the general public.
. “Nat?” Sam asked. “You okay?”
“Any functioning mob in New York,” answered Bucky. "Tony Stark is a golden goose."
Steve snorted but didn’t look up from the article he was reading.
Bucky’s heart was pounding as he watched his options ran out. There was no way that he could let Clint go. He got anywhere near Phil, he’d be taken in for questioning, and then no doubt, once they figured out who he was, arrested soon afterward. It wouldn't matter about evidence - one of New York's officers were shot down in the middle of the street, right in front of the damn precincet. There was no way the boys in blue would rest until they put someone behind bars; and, it's Police Theories: 101 to always start with the significant other. Especially is the significant other is a convicted criminal. But could he leave Coulson here?
Tony could barely hear Sam’s farewell before Steve slammed the door behind them.
“Oh, Hammer,” sighed Stane, clapping a hand on his shoulder. “Pierce and HYDRA are only out for The Captain. Once they got their hands on him, you didn’t think they would keep us around, did you? We would be loose ends, Hammer. HYDRA doesn’t do loose ends.”
“He’s really coming?”
Pounding on his door roused Steve. Looking at his clock, Steve could see that it was still the middle of the night. He groaned, but pushed himself out of bed.
A familiar voice pulled him from the depths. Hands were on his shoulders, shaking him roughly. He groaned in pain, each breath relaying to him nothing but agony. “Wake up, asshole!”
It had to be Howard. There was no way it wasn’t. Tony looked enough like Howard, but there was no way that signature facial hair and beady eyes belonged to anyone else.
The pair raced off, following the AI’s directions. The crumbling house – of course it was the collapsing one,
Instead of trailing off with the rest of his crew, Steve said behind, gun trained on the main door that led down from the restaurant. There was no way in hell he’d let anyone through that door to his family. There was no way he would fail again. If HYDRA wanted in, they were going to get a hell of a fight. He felt his heart beat slow, the predator emerging to protect what little family he had left. He could barely hear his crew shouting ‘
Bucky caught Natasha’s laugh over the receiver. His chest clenched, his fingers twitching to reach out for her, when he knew she wasn’t there. Her laugh had always been his favorite thing.
“Don’t,” Steve stopped him. “You did everything you could to keep this family afloat. I’ll forever be in your debt for doing what I couldn’t. This is on me, Clint. Everything that’s happened; it’s all on me.”
“Sex, Bucky. When was the last time we slept with Tony.”
“I’ve been in here for two months?” Phil gaped.
"Ah, Captain," he jeered. "Finally awake. I was wondering if my men had actually killed you or not."
Steve scoffed, ready to retaliate but a wounded noise had his attention shooting back to the old woman, whose day he was currently ruining. “Listen, Tony, I’ve got a client.”
It was a mutual decision to end things, all on good terms. It was almost like nothing had happened. Some days Tony wished it had worked out; that Pepper could be his other half.
He cracked his back when he stood up, gazing back over his property.
“None of the eyewitnesses saw him touch her,” Sparky argued.
“I know.”
“Nothing, it’s stupid.”
Steve felt Tony’s sharp gasp against his mouth; Steve thought Tony was going to push him away. But then Tony was all over Steve, kissing back with a broken sob, trying to convey all his emotions with a single kiss. “I was so scared, Steve. I thought she was going to kill you,” Tony whispered into Steve’s neck when the two finally broke for air.
This was not good. This was
Tony’s mind hissed. He cursed inwardly, hating himself or thinking that. He owed Yinsen everything; there was no way he would have survived the blast without him.
Steve shifted uncomfortably in his seat. “Yes. It’s where we’ve been basing our operations recently.”
Steve shot her a cold stare. “Get your foot off the dash,” Steve scolded instead.
Rogers was up in an instant pointing his gun back at Tony. And that’s when Steve saw it. Just like it had happened before.
Tony’s side was on fire. That man was no Steve, not the Steve he knew. He was going to kill Tony, hell he had probably already hurt Steve. Tony’s blood boiled at the fact that Steve might be hurt because of him. Tony wouldn’t let Rogers hurt Steve anymore. He wouldn’t let Rogers kill him. He felt his power running through his veins, the metal calling to him.
“Hey, easy,” Natasha said, rubbing comforting circles on his back.
“And you?”
“You don’t think I know that?!”
Obadiah snatched them, eyes immediately catching on the familiar scrawl. “What is this?”
God, that voice. Tony couldn’t help but smile. “Well, hey there, blue eyes.”
Steve saw Hammer gulp. “You know, you should listen to your friend,” he said. “You aren’t in the right mindset.”
Fury nodded, hand rubbing idly at his bald scalp. “You’ve got anything else?”
“Steve,” Tony sighed, not moving an inch. “It’s not,” he broke off, placing his hands on his hips. “You had JARVIS keep tabs on my health?” he asked.
“Thank you for helping me and my mommy.” She pecked Bruce’s cheek sweetly before plopping back down to the ground.
Why would they?
Steve furrowed his brows. “What are you on about? Stop stalling. You want to do business? Fine. You call your men off of my family, and I will go with you and tell you anything you want to know. Simple as that. As long as you stay away from my crew I will keep feeding you information.”
Tony glared back at the mob boss. “Well, you aren’t exactly easy to talk to.”
“Ah, back with the land of the living, I see.”
Tony turned around so he could gaze into those baby blues. It was still night, so Steve’s eyes reflected beautifully in the moonlight. Sticking a hand up, Tony looked over at his watch on the side table, willing it to come to him.
“This is gonna happen to you!” Rogers pleaded.
“You sly dog,” whispered Clint. “You’re forcing Stark out of his hole.”
"Mr. Stark?"
“But it’s given me a family,” Tony admitted quietly. It felt good saying it; it felt
“Of course, Sir,” the disembodied voice replied. If Steve didn’t know any better, it was said almost smugly. “Shall I start another cup for you, Captain?”
“I wouldn’t worry to much about that,” Steve replied. “Buck and I seem to have no problem making a mess out of everything on our own.”
even if I want to. My brain, just won’t shut up, and I can’t Steve, I
“Please?” Steve tried to add.
it’s Extremis. I just – I can’t
“What?”
the disease. They’d known Extremis was a virus going into this – they had files upon files of others that were infected that proved it. Had they really been so blind that it wouldn’t affect Tony the same way? Steve and Bucky had been besides themselves when Tony opened his eyes again, consequences be
Barnes bit his lip, looking away. If Tony had to guess, he was just as confused at Wilson’s message of Steve’s favor. “Fine,” he relented. “We’ll figure this shit out, then get you in bed.”
“Can we at least turn on the TV?” Steve tried.
Clint thought to himself.
“So,” he said.
Three sharp knocks rapped against his apartment door, and Steve jolted, his free hand already reaching for the gun he knew wasn’t there.
It shone brightly under their gaze, the silver limb sparkling under the lab lights. “Well,” Tony started. “This is the part where you say something.”
Now he’s gone and ruined everything. Fury would start with Clint and slowly work his way down the line until every Commando, even Steve, sat rotting in prison for the rest of their lives.
“How is this rash?” countered Natasha. “What the hell is wrong with you, Clint? This is a good thing. You guys didn’t get anything for Hammer, right?”
Tony stopped to look at the other man. “You don’t know that.”
Steve didn’t think, his fist pulling back before throwing a solid punch towards his friend. Bucky dodged easily before twisting around Steve and pushing him down to the mat. “God, you’re rusty. No wonder you’re so grumpy. With technique like that, I’d be mad too.”
Steve shook himself from his thoughts. “Sorry, what?” He turned around, starting the trek back to his apartment.
He would fix it, this time.
“There’s a first time for everything.”
“No, I’m saying that you can’t bullshit me,” Bucky snapped. “I know this look; I’ve seen it before. You’re fightin’ with something, and you’re keeping it a secret. Remember the last time you kept secrets?”
Steve walked down the hall and down the first flight of stairs, peering into the main room to find it empty. He didn’t expect it any other way. Sam was watching Thor, Natasha was watching Clint, Tony was safe, sleeping upstairs, and Bruce passed out long ago. And Bucky was downstairs, waiting for him.
Phil chuckled. “Least I can do. But, since you don’t have to go, can you stay for a few days? I’m sure you’ve spent more hours in the car than anywhere else recently. It’ll be cramped, but Clint and I- ” he paused, looking at Clint for his approving nod, “would love for you to stay. It’s taco night, tomorrow.”
Steve sat alone in his flat. Reaching for another vial, he looked down at his stash.
Tony looked back to Obie. “I didn’t.” Catching his business partner raise an eyebrow, Tony sighed. “Boxing lesson with Happy. Didn’t end well for me,” Tony said as he gestured to his face.
“Bruce Banner, ma’am.”
“Yeah, I’m here, man.” Hands helped him up, guiding his to rest on Clint’s chest.
Tony sighed, flopping his head against Steve’s chest. “I know, I know,” he said. “But it’s not a lie. I got a lot of stuff going on up there, and sometimes it doesn’t shut up until I do something about it.”
His mother wore the same tearful face when he told her he was joining the Air Force. He could see her pride, but it was only a mask, to hide the lingering fear of
Steve stared blankly at Bucky. “What did you do?”
“Woah, woah, woah!” Tony cried. “This is a perfectly good product. Surely Captain Responsible would donate it to someone in need, rather than send it to an eternity in the dump?”
Tony rolled his eyes. "Have a little faith. Calm down; they'll be fine."
“Listen. This isn’t Brooklyn. There isn’t just one mob you have to worry about.
you care. You can pretend all you like, but you’re not fooling me.”
“Everyone needs a hobby,” Barnes quipped.
“Well, I don’t know what else to think!” Steve shouted. “I know you’ve noticed that Tony’s been distant, don’t you bullshit me. JARVIS says he’s healthy, we haven’t been arguing and when we’re together everything great, but he leaves! I just – I don’t know what else to think at this point!”
Steve had lost count the number of times he read over that file. He just remembers ending up in Tony’s arms just holding him and refusing to let go. There was a very short list of people Steve thought he could actually kill, and if he was still alive, Stane would have met the wrong side of Steve’s shield.
While everything about his current situation was less than ideal, he was unbelievably lucky to have ended up somewhere like this. The woods were peaceful and quiet, offering a sort of solitude that he’d never get in the city. His lungs were always filled with the freshest of air, his nose smelling pines and wildflowers, his ears constantly buzzing with nature and a babbling brook.
“HYDRA.”
Coulson broke his gaze away, staring at his bony fingers. “I’ve been made aware of the chain reactions that I’ve caused.” He paused. “Although, I’m sure that certain things were left out for my sanity.”
“And yet, no one’s been able to charge me.”
“I am so mad at you,” she whispered into his hair as she bent down to give him a delicate kiss.
He scanned the room, deciding where to start.
knew. It was then that Sam had met her son, Riley’s nephew. A boy with bright hair and curious eyes. A boy named after his uncle.
The car door was ripped open. “What the hell happened?” Tony snapped his head up to be met with the face of Clint Barton. Tony had been so distraught over Steve that he hadn’t even realized that they’d reached The Commandos current hideout.
-------------------------
Tony hadn’t meant to confide in Barnes about Phil, especially not talking to Steve about it first, but it just sort of happened. One minute, they were in silence, Tony tapping nervously on the steering wheel as they drove to SI’s office downtown, the next Tony was rambling, spitting the truth like a geyser.
“And that’s why I can’t go back. Fury and his men will be searching until they find me or him. All I have if this map. There are three addresses marked on it, one of which is yours. I know he has to come here. How do you know about Loopers?”
“Steve, you’re literally Captain America. I’ve seen you lift a bus before.”
Tony felt a tear slide down his cheek. With a final gasp, he let himself go. Rogers and Steve collapsed onto the ground, both men heaving.
“Don’t you dare finish that fucking sentence. You need to listen good and hard, Steve. I lose another arm? Fine. I go blind or lose my voice? Who cares? I lose all my memories? Who needs them? I’ll lose them, Steve, and I won’t even blink an eye. Because I don’t need ‘em. Because there is only one thing on this planet that I absolutely cannot lose, and that’s you.”
“Uh oh. I know that look.” A calloused hand reached up to cup Steve’s face, and Steve didn’t hesitate to turn into it, placing small kisses into Tony’s palm. Tony pulled him down for a real kiss, and Steve couldn’t help but sigh into it.
The hand dropped away from his shoulder. “Fine, then. What’s our next move?”
“As you say, Sir.”
-------------------------
“Stevie doesn’t much like the current predicament,” Tony returned, tapping his fingers against the arc reactor. “If anything, he might like this one a little bit better,” he said, turning back to the new arc reactor that was sitting on the lab table, illuminated in a halo of white light from the nearby desk lamps.
Redial.
He knew then that she wasn’t talking about combat. They’d lost his father to the bottom of a bottle, not a bullet. Most soldiers don’t die from the war, they die from what comes after. And that had terrified his mother.
“But, there are stipulations,” Steve said quietly.
“That there’s a huge, gaping hole in the middle of the street not three blocks from here,” she replied easily.
“Looking for answers.” She looked around the room, most likely for Steve, but lucked out as the man came stomping in.
The drive was quiet, but it was pleasant. Steve let himself drift; Clint and Natasha’s soft conversation in the back seat, as well as Tony’s tapping against the steering wheel lulling him to sleep. It seemed like no time had passed when he felt Tony’s hand shake his shoulder gently. “Rise and shine, buttercup,” he teased. He let Tony manhandle him out of the car, staring blankly at the building in front of him.
Pierce shifted uneasily in his seat. Stane had come bursting in just days ago with what he had thought was the best news possible. Tony Stark and The Captain had turned on each other, leaving Stark with a price on his head, and The Captain with a name to his face.
“I’m going to kill them. I’m going to kill them all.”
Tony froze. Steve had warned him about this. Maybe he should have brought one of The Commandos with after all.
“Well, I- ”
“Oh, goodie. Are you going to leave a donation?”
It still wasn’t enough, but it was a hell of a lot better than indefinite. And that was enough for him to work with. Besides, he had a feeling it was going to be a lot easier to get through the day, his new phone a comforting weight in his pocket. He pulled away and the first time in a long time, felt cold.
Steve cut him off with another kiss, pushing him back down against the mattress and crawled over him until his body was bracketing Tony’s, surrounding him on all sides. “Because I am yours,” he whispered in-between pecks. “And you are mine.
Tony answered, Natasha shaking her head fondly.
“I don’t think it’s a theme,” Steve said, frowning down at the menu. “The description says it comes with five different types of meat but only lists three.”
Lo and behold, Steve felt a slight tension in Tony’s body as his mind no doubt scrambled to come up with a believable answer answer. “I may or may not have procrastinated in more ways than one for this meeting,” Tony said. “You know that board likes it when I come in with something shiny and new for them to play with.”
Pierce let out a small sigh, but didn’t respond. He knew this was going to happen, hell, he'd
Natasha pulled away, finally taking in Steve’s appearance. “I can see that,” she replied.
“Steve.”
That's not the man he knows. Steve may have thought that once, may have believed the rumors, but he knew the truth now. He
Tony looked over at Steve, but the blonde bit his tongue, gesturing for Tony to continue. “It looks me so long to notice, because I binge all the time. I mean, you know that I don’t keep normal hours and when I’m in the middle of something, I can be down here for days, but even I realized it was starting to get out of hand.”
Steve watched Tony give one final shout, feeling himself be pushed out of the house with immense force. Around him, the mansion was falling to pieces, the air filled now not with Tony’s screams, but Hill’s.
“We’ll have to take some more photos from different angles when he’s stable.”
After everything that had happened, and the man looked as if he didn’t give grief more than a second glance.
His brain was screaming at him, shouting
Looking back down at Steve, he counted each of the deep breaths that whooshed out from his firm chest. Tony frowned, looking at the state the man was in. The usual fluff from his blonde locks was gone, replaced by dirt and grease. Dark pouches sat underneath each closed eye, a huge contrast to the sickly pallor of his skin. He had seen this look before; Steve working himself to the point of exhaustion. That look usually did not bode well. Tony reached his hand not clasped in Steve’s to brush a few locks out of his face. After everything, the man definitely needed his sleep.
Clint shrugged. “Same as everyone else. Broken.”
“No,” Obadiah sighed. “But Tony does. And with Stark on full retreat, I’m the only one who can get you the answer you need.”
Bucky could barely hear himself over the chaos that lay before him. People were screaming, running through the streets, although there was no point. The van was long gone by now. Officers ran down the steps of the precinct, grabbing for-
his face – the face that Steve had lost many a sketch book to. Doe eyes blinking open and his forehead free of furrows and worry lines that were usually there, burdened by stress. He’d catch their gaze and smile softly, but Steve’s favorite part was the slight flush of cheeks. While seemingly impossible, Tony Stark does in fact blush, and Steve’s heart sang every time he thought about how he and Bucky were the only ones who got to see it. It took Steve a while to figure out why he did – it certainly wasn’t from their previous activities. While Steve liked to think that he and Bucky were adventurous in bed, it surely hadn’t cracked Tony’s top ten. No, it was for a reason much simpler than that. It was because when Tony woke up, the first thing he saw was that Steve and Bucky had stayed the night as well.
"Oh, it doesn't hurt? Well in that case- " Tony reeled back and landed a right hook straight over the wound. The Captain went crashing to the ground.
So, he left. Walked away from the sounds of that cold, cruel laughter – laughter that sounded nothing like Riley’s. Unbeknownst to the father, however, Sam didn’t leave alone. He left with all the books, all the scams, everything. And posted them for the world to see.
“Well, we nearly ran headfirst into your handler,” Tony answered. “He
Bucky narrowed his eyes, but refused to budge, causing Stark to chuckle. "You don't even speak, do you? I mean, I know that all dogs have different levels of intelligence, but I'm surprised you haven't made it this far in your training yet."
Sam said nothing, just started the car, driving off towards Steve’s house.
Natasha sighed. “Disabled at the time of the shooting.”
Tony landed a good punch, clipping another man with an elbow, intent on pushing away. A cry of pain had him freezing in his tracks as he watched Steve fall to the ground, out cold. Tony raced forward, towards the fallen man, but hands were grabbing him again. He struggled, pulled, yanked his way closer to Steve until he felt a small prick in his neck, everything slowly fading to black.
“You got it.” Bucky slapped his thighs as he pushed himself up, walking towards the door.
Steve’s hand shot up, gun raising, and fired a bullet just to the right of Sam’s head.
Turns out the deadly duo of Barnes and Barton run that play all the time. Whenever Steve needs info on another mob, the two pounce, relying on the weaker minds of their enemies. Barnes scouts ahead, cornering and killing one of the easy targets. Then Barton swoops in, cleans the body of anything useful, like a handkerchief, a ring, or in this case, a fake tooth that they had kept from Rumlow. Anything to use as proof for the opposite gang. See, Barton, being raised in the circus, was taught that “seeing is believing.” A pair of deft hands and some slippery language was all Barton needs to convince anyone he was a double agent. Barnes and Barton let themselves get caught in the middle of a firefight, Barton guns the other down, and begins his interrogation process. Turns out that Barton supposedly belongs to over twelve different mobs, and Barnes has died a lot more times that anyone knew about.
“You’re not.” Clint flinched when he realized that he spoke out loud.
“Tony, what the- ”
“It was to be an arranged marriage. Well, my dad referred to it as a business merger,” Tony huffed. “Obi was always nice to me, always telling me I’ll do great things. I thought that we would be perfect together,” he said with a watery smile, until his face turned stony. “But then my parents died, and Obi changed. He wasn’t the same man. He didn’t marry for me, he married for my power; I guess I forgot about that. He raped me. He beat me. He destroyed me until I couldn’t remember my own name. He took everything for me: my home, my business, my life! I tried to stop him, get the authorities involved, but they wouldn’t listen! Obi found out and tried to kill me. You saw my scars; you know I’m not lying. I was terrified; I-I couldn’t let him - ” Tony broke off with a shudder, gasping for air into his hands.
And Steve was just Cap.
Because not all of him made it back out.
Tony paused, looking over the dirty blonde. It was sickening to think that he could still look like complete shit, but also look better than he had a week ago. Of course, his eyes were still haunted and his breath had a more pungent smell than his personal bar. Ignoring all of that, the worst of it was the slight shaking. Small tremors in the hands, the uncoordinated movements, the shaky voice. Tony had been around Barton enough to know that if the man didn’t have to move, he wouldn’t, opting to be more still than a statue. Always on the prowl, always stalking, like a bird of prey. The Clint before his eyes, however, seemed to be what the old Barton would hunt.
“They will be back,” Yinsen pushed. “And something tells me that they won’t be as generous as they were last time. We need a plan.”
“Good to see we’re finally on the same page,” quipped Stark. “Let’s try this again, shall we? I want you to tell me about the job you were planning on running.”
To Tony’s delight, Steve whispered a quick, “oh my God,” in horror before he scrambled to get off him, receding quickly back into his chair.
People made a move to stand, but a hand from The Captain had them instantly back in their seats. “I’m not finished. As we get deeper into this, you have to understand that there will be a lot of dangerous times ahead of us. Now, I have had the pleasure of working many years with each and every one of you. Everyone here has earned my respect and friendship tenfold; you are the bravest and best people that I’ve ever known.” Tony slunk back in his chair, feeling embarrassed. Like he was walking in on an intimate family moment.
After HYDRA had wiped out the last of the SSR, convincing Steve not to jump into his grave head first had been near impossible. The man was more than ready for it to be over than to even consider any plan involving some semblance of revenge. His support system was gone, and Steve knew it was best to just pull the plug instead of waiting for another miracle.
“You wanted something?”
“Okay, I won’t,” Steve smiled.
Pepper’s hand caressed his cheek, wiping away another tear. “Everything’s going to be ok, Steve.”
“Well you shouldn’t have. Treachery picked us all up about a year ago; this is one of the first moves we made on the Avengers.”
“Sir was last seen entering Mr. Barton’s room, Captain.”
His head was swimming and his body was throbbing, but Tony pulled his head away to take in his surroundings. It was dark, so Tony couldn’t really see the extent of the room they were in. He appeared to be laid up on a small cot, not much different than the one he had holed up in his lab at the speakeasy. While looking around, he caught sight of one of his hands, or at least, he thought so. It was so bandaged that it looked more like a snowball than a hand. He looked back at Yinsen, who shot him a sympathetic look, before looking down. But he wasn’t looking at Tony’s hands.
His meeting with Stark was anything but normal. If anything, Stark had managed to get more of a rise out of him. And now that Stark knew what he looked like? Steve was in big trouble. Of course, Steve could just call it in and have Stark dead by dinner time, but that wouldn’t solve anything.
Steve raised an eyebrow, shaking his head fondly. “What the hell could you possibly need?”
Hill bit her lip as she nodded. She walked forward slowly, almost as if she was afraid to approach. “We were able to recover the actual victims from the acquired target list. You need to know.”
“Then what am I missing here!” Tony cried.
Three sharp knocks sounded, the vibrations bounding down Natasha’s back.
Tony felt the man stiffen, his arms almost locking around the brunette. Tony could feel his heartbeat quicken against his own chest, almost hearing the gears churn in The Captain’s head as he tried to comprehend what Tony had said. He finally pulled away from Tony, his wide eyes locking instantly with Tony, mouth opening before snapping shut again.
We’ve got quite the trip ahead of us.”
Steve was right. He stayed by Tony’s side for thirty years, showering him with love and happiness. Iron Man was never born. Tony Stark had survived.
Tony slipped out of Obie’s grasp, walking over to his personal bar.
In all honestly, Clint didn’t have to use the bathroom, he just needed to get up and walk. He’s found himself doing that more and more lately. He fidgets, twitches, and can never seem to get comfortable. He’s lost count of all the circuits he’s made in his room, how many times he’s just walked aimlessly through the tunnels underneath the speakeasy.
And just like that, everything was gone, fury filling his veins, a roaring anger pounding in his ears. He moved to grip Coulson at his shoulders, jerking the man back. “
“Cap, listen. This isn’t the first time, and probably not the last, that metal’s torn through my body. I got this.”
Natasha opened her mouth but was quickly stopped by Clint, his hand smacking over it. “Don’t,” he grit out. “Just don’t.”
They were back at the Avengers base.
“Yes, dear?”
"Steve?"
“Well, I thought I’d give you a head start. Handicap, you know?” Barnes shrugged.
Tony smiled. “And a kingdom you did pay.”
Tony sat in the car long minutes after the kids hopped out, retreating back into the house. Just a few simple moments of silence before Wanda and Pietro would no doubt start a fight, or Peter would start crying.
Ignoring the sharp pain, Steve tore back at Stark, blood pumping fiercely through his veins. While Stark managed to clip him here and there, the man was no match for someone like Steve. Steve could see the man slowing down, his moves becoming sluggish as Steve tore more and more pained groans from Stark with each hit he landed.
“Captain!” The man started, freezing for a second when the hulking blonde finally saw their current predicament. “Forgive my intrusion.”
“Yes. I’m sorry it took us so long to meet, but you’ll have to forgive me, I’m not from around these parts.”
“Because I know he hasn’t,” continued Steve. “And I also know that Tony never misses your phone calls, because the one time he did you scheduled him with contract negotiations for a week in Canada just to get back at him.”
Bucky sighed, dropping the cold pizza he was attempting to eat and walked back to his room. He opened his closet and threw on a pair of shorts, grabbing a fitted long sleeve. He’d have to get his glove from the front room before he went outside. Just another pleasure of living here – dealing with triple digit temperatures all while hiding a very recognizable metal prosthetic.
“Nope,” he said shoving it back in her hand.
“But satisfaction brought it back,” retorted The Captain. “I need to make sure me and my people are safe. And if the rumors are true, then we won’t be the only ones in danger.”
“Seems a bit sketchy to be doing this here and now. What if something goes wrong?”
His head was pounding. He walked over to his bag and pulled out his sketch book. At least Steve had this. Just simple sketches got him out of his head for a while. Steve was sure it was one of the only things to keep him sane.
“Pepper, it was from someone who can spell Bruce Banner. You know that this couldn’t have been him.”
Not Tony.
Steve gave the man a small smile. “Don’t worry, Buck. You already helped in more ways than you know.”
“And at least one employee that knows who’s in charge of the whole thing. And who really took out Phil.”
He waited for Clint to answer. Clint sighed. “Blend in,” he grit out.
“God, not now,” Steve groaned. “If you’re going to do this, please, just do it outside. I’m not sure what’ll kill me first: this headache, or you two.”
“Asgard’s done for, now that one of Odin’s sons has been convicted of murder. Their stocks will never be able to recover.”
He picked up his pace until he found his way into Fury’s office.
Mind made up, Bucky blinked back tears as he quickly pulled a hand away from Clint to pull out his gun. “I’m so sorry,” he whispered, before bringing the butt of it down onto Clint’s head. The man crumpled instantly, his screams ceasing.
Sam touched down on the Helipad softly, Steve jumping out before the blades had stopped completely. Of course, Steve had forgotten about his current status and quickly crumpled to the ground. He heard a shuffle before both Sam and Hill were pulling him up balancing one of his arms on each of their shoulders.
for that matter – Steve decided to let the conversation slide for another time. Besides, he didn’t think convincing Tony to stay in bed tonight would be difficult.
he had said.
sorry, Tony.” He grabbed at Tony’s hands – those damn hands – and cradled them against him. “This is all my fault, and I- ”
Since he obviously couldn't cooperate with Stark by telling him what he wanted to hear, he'd have to settle for leading him on, goading him to agreeing with the inevitability of HYDRA.
, Natasha thought to herself.
It was over before he could even enjoy it, his release spilling onto Steve’s chest with a broken cry. Steve followed soon after, a few more rough strokes and he was gone, biting into the meat of Tony’s shoulder. He gasped, and relished in the pain, pulling Steve closer.
“Baby, I’m not going anywhere. I’m still here; you came and got me, remember?”
Steve ran alongside the gurney with Peter clutched to his chest, not caring when he heard yet another angry shout as he ran into a new nurse. The doctors on the other side were shouting numbers that he couldn’t understand, an alarm was blaring loudly though speakers, Peter was still bawling into his neck, but Steve only had eyes for one man.
"I'm sorry to say that your word doesn't mean anything to me either."
Clint had made a mistake; one that almost cost Natasha her life.
Steve turned scarlet, sending Tony into a laughing fit. “Don’t even think about it,” Steve tried to scold. “You’re on bed rest.”
The sun rose over the horizon as Rogers approached the diner. Fury had a sick sense of humor, making the address an old watering hole of his.
“Then you will fail,” Yinsen continued. “It is time you try something else.”
“Hail HYDRA.”
she’d think,
Fury smiled at the pair of them. “I hope you brought something more interesting than that. It’s going to take a little more to impress me.”
“They were running,” Rhodes said.
“Well, he’s the only one with his head on straight.”
Tony felt Steve tense, but he was the one to dart up in surprise. “Coulson?” he asked with a sliver of hope.
recognized him, and
“If I don’t end up killing you, he probably will for using his name in vain.”
“I think you’ve used that excuse a few too many times.”
Tony hummed quietly. "Well, Captain, how do you suppose we get out of this one?"
The shield was a lot neater, too. None of that clean up the blood stains crap. Not to mention, someone can survive a gunshot. One whip of the shield aimed at the left side of the body at close range, and down goes the target. The blow from the shield disrupts the electrical signals passing through the heart, causing it to stop beating instantly. It’s clean. Effective.
“How are we looking?” Steve asked.
, Steve! Fruit is in the name!”
“I can, and you will.”
“I told them, Buck.” Another whisper.
Steve was in his office when he got the notification that Hammer’s men had activated the sensors. He thought about calling Stark, but Steve’s foolishness probably burned the bridge with that relationship. The least he could do was stick to the plan and protect the man's warehouse and weapons. Later, when they'd brought home a few of Hammer's men, maybe Steve could use them as an enticing apology.
Fury, FBI? That’s just what they needed. Another superpower sniffing around him and the team. “No offense, but why the hell would the FBI want to get involved with you?”
“Alright then,” he said, drawing eyes back to him. “We need to figure out how- ”
Tony sobbed, his body scalding and eager for release. But then Steve was pumping him again, once, twice, three times, and Tony was gone, semen arching up between the two of them. Tony felt like he was on fire, heart galloping and veins singing. Within that moment, everything disappeared, until all that was left was Steve. All he could feel was Steve. Tony fumbled blindly until Steve’s mouth was back on his, and he sighed in relief, intent to ride the high straight to oblivion.
“No! What are you, some TK freak?!”
“No!” Steve shouted. “You listen to me. It’s not about her. It will never be about Peggy, because I will never love her.”
It seemed that most of the hits were along the flanks. Maybe extra shielding along the sides will account for that. But how will that affect his flight capabilities? Adding any sort of weight-
Tony nodded again, jerkily, as he worried his hands together. Steve couldn’t stop himself from grabbing them gently, pressing a firm peck against the slender fingers. “Everything’s going to be alright,” he placated.
“Loki was here,” he answered. “Anything look like its missing?”
“The building was coming down anyway, Tony, I had to do something!”
“I don’t have a name! I was only contacted over email.”
“I’m sorry?” The Captain blanched.
Tony balled his fists. He didn't have time for this, nor did he much care for it. The lengthy statements, the half-assed condolences. The '
, Buck. Three days and we have no leads on Stark and a half catatonic mob boss!”
Steve’s world came crashing to a full stop.
Steve blushed furiously.
But there was nothing - he couldn't sketch the faces of the man that took them, he couldn't remember what guns they were using, what accents they had. He couldn't picture anything. That was, except for Tony's blood on the floor, his moans as he was beaten, his stuttering breaths as he gasped for a full breath. His soothing words as his lips moved across his skin.
“Steve.” Now
“So, is it just by pure coincidence that you’re on mandatory leave from work right now?”
Logically he knew Pepper was right. There was no place in the world that would be safer for Peter than the tower. But the thought of handing Peter over was like giving Pepper one of his limbs.
“How about the next time either of you talk, you both get a bullet in your brain?”
Steve rubbed at his temples, closing his eyes, wishing to be anywhere than where he currently was. He tried to stretch out his legs, but was painfully reminded about the constricting desk he was squished behind in an even more constricting cubicle. Phones rang and keyboards sang in the crowded office, making Steve curse his enhanced hearing.
His Tony, who worked through the weekend to build video game controllers that Thor couldn’t even break. His Tony, who had gone out of his way to build a library in the tower just because he’d seen Natasha reading one morning. His Tony, who stored herbal tea in almost every room in the tower so Bruce would always have some on hand. His Tony, who took Clint out in his suit just so he could hear him laugh, the archer always whooping through the air as he flew like he used to in the circus. His Tony, who always kept an open feed of Peter sleeping in his lab, just so he could hear his son’s tiny breaths as he worked. And his Tony, who spent a whole afternoon fixing Steve’s favorite radio, who let Steve drag him to every art gallery, who let Steve love him, who gave him a child. Who gave him life.
“Alright,” Sam finally said. “Fine. But the same goes for you.” She looked at him questioningly. Sam shrugged, rubbing at the back of his neck. “There’s a chance that I might have a better shot.”
Tony hummed but continued to eye him warily. “Whatever,” the brunette replied. “You can’t keep me here, Cap.”
“They want you to choose between Stark and your crew.”
the brunette mouthed as he pushed closer to Steve. Clint nodded, closing the door softly behind him.
“More or less. It didn’t do any wonders for my arm, and Nat got some bruising from falling down the stairs, but that’s not the problem. The explosion was in a hallway by the main offices. Nat and I dug our way out but we’re still trying to get people out.”
Steve looked around, confused. “No?”
“Tony!”
Clint said nothing. He walked over to Tony slowly, until his legs gave out under him. Shaking hands reached out to touch the metal of the suit, tracing along the arc reactor, and up the sides until they got to Tony’s face. Not stopping his journey, Clint’s hands traveled onto Tony’s skin, feeling the warm flesh.
It shouldn’t be there. They shouldn’t have this. Tony knew The Captain was close to his crew, but this just screamed family bond. Why did they get to have this? How? Tony had files compiled on most of The Commandos. They’re all so different; each thinking, each moving in their own unique way. They shouldn’t work. They shouldn’t be
Steve walked into the overcrowded room, the bustling conversations coming to a halt. As The Commandos stared at him, Steve noted how to compensate for the small room, his team ended up sharing seats, leaning against each other to make sure everyone had a place in the cramped space. It was moments like this where Steve couldn’t help but smile, the scene before him reminding Steve that they were more than a team. They were a family. One that Steve was not willing to lose.
“Two, Jed.”
Clint snorted as he waltzed out of the cell. “Can’t fucking wait.”
“Not a word. He’s no closer to HYDRA, let alone even know you’re involved with me. You and your crew are in the clear, Cap.”
Tony snorted, leaning back into Bucky. “Yeah, right. Maybe I wore it just for you. Maybe I was looking for a reason to be late to this meeting.”
Maybe the trolley hadn’t hit just yet.
“I don’t,” Tony answered quickly. “No one likes procedural cop shows.”
Tony opened it, checking over to make sure that the laptop was still inside, disregarding the sketches it also still housed. Satisfied, Tony turned to leave back through the door when it burst open, The Captain almost falling through the door from the force with which he opened it.
“Exactly! You’re
Tony frowned. “I got it already. It’s right- ” he paused when Steve turned to give him a long look. “Right,” Tony added slowly, pointing towards the door. “I’ll just, uh, go find it. Might take a while.” And with that he dipped out the door, shooting a final smile over his shoulder at Natasha.
Logically, he tried to distance himself from the whole thing, but his pesky brain kept him up with ‘what-ifs’.
hot. You remember the videos I showed you from Killian’s files?”
From: Sam Wilson
“...Steve?”
He had never slept more than a few hours at a time. His nightmares always made sure of that. Steve almost fell out of bed when he woke up to sun streaming through the windows. He actually did manage to fall out of bed when he looked at the clock, reading 8:00 a.m.
“As if you aren’t happy to see us,” Steve added.
“Please, Stark. You’re as crooked as they come.”
Tony knew he couldn’t stay here. He had work to do. His company was in shambles after the kidnapping - he didn’t even want to think about the stocks - and from what Pepper had shown him, the competitive market was a disaster.
“It could be worse,” Tony shrugged. “You should see the shit hole that Barnes lives in.” Her breath caught at his name, eyes darting back between the both of them, searching for any sign or remnant of James on them. “I mean, I’ve crashed in some seedy joints when I was in college, but this place was- ”
“How can I? The explosion was a bust; The Commandos lived to see another day. That’s not even getting started on the fact that my two business partners went behind my back.”
“Uh,” Steve stated.
He was just getting comfortable when he felt Steve start to shift. “Don’t,” Tony said suddenly, hands digging into Steve’s skin.
Bucky shook his head, dropping down into an old chair. For the past week, Bucky had been slipping out each day to head over to Stark's, trying desperately to get the man to come back and work with the crew, but to no avail. He wasn’t coming back.
Steve smiled back at the smaller man. “Look at the bright side. My life surely wouldn’t be as interesting.”
“Yeah, well, I’m not usually the man with the plan.”
he chuckled to himself.
Steve frowned. “I don’t know. Maybe we should move him.”
“That’s what I was trying to tell you,” Tony groaned over Pepper’s apologies. “Don’t let the wire touch the sides, okay?”
“Are you alright?”
“Where are we going?”
“That’s great, Tony,” Steve sighed. “And the last three years don’t count because?”
Steve laughed, flopping down next to him, dragging Tony to lie across his chest.
Bucky pulled up first, Clint flinging his door open, out of the car before it was even in park. He sped through the store for the second time that day, busting down the secret entrance to the speakeasy, gun drawn. He felt Bucky move in behind him, the pair walking silently down the steps.
Tony flicked water at him, frowning at his tone. “Rude.”
he told Pierce one night, his accent like a calming lullaby.
Steve leaned down and kissed Tony slowly, hands grasping either side of Tony’s face to keep him from moving, savoring each second their mouths were connected. Tony gave everything he could, wholeheartedly. He would give anything to Steve if he asked. Nothing was rushed, as it was just moments before, the pair of them getting lost in the other, as if they had all the time in the world.
“Steve, last month I saw people luring a black bear away with waffles. I can’t make this shit up.”
Tony grimaced, slow to turn around. Despite what he’d told Steve, he had no interest in talking with any of New York’s elite. His departure from the speakeasy was more for Steve’s doing. He didn’t get a chance to know the rest of The Commandos before they’d disappeared, and he seemed almost out of place to be there with them while they were grieving. That, and there was probably a good chance that Steve was still going to tell Clint about what happened with Phil. He promised Steve he’d make himself scarce for that conversation, for good reason.
he sighed to himself. The walk was as slow and torturous as it always was – he was in no rush – but it always ended the same, no matter what time he made the climb: him curled in the middle of the bed, lying in silence.
“I’m sure by now you’ve been made aware of the lengths that we’re taken to get you home,” Phil countered. “Steve nearly burned New York down to find you.”
“That’s what I thought,” Phil muttered. “Fury. He’s different. Nothing gets past him unless he lets it through. It’s alright,” he continued. “I’ve made my bed.”
Tony parroted in Bruce’s tone.
Steve sighed. It wasn’t like this, back in the day. There wasn’t this much poverty; there wasn’t this much killing.
“He lifted it like it was nothing!”
“You sure you want to punch your way out of this one?” Natasha argues. “We can’t exactly go to war against the NYPD. We don’t know who’s dirty, who’s clean.”
“Tomorrow.” Tony looked at the ground, unable to watch the rest of their worried faces, eyes darting around the room in disbelief. “They don’t mess around it seems,” Tony tried to joke.
“Stop,” Clint responded, putting a hand up. “There is a long list of people that can be placed at fault for his death. You’re not one of them. You couldn’t have known that would happen.”
“I just had a check in last week. It should be a while before I have another one.”
Steve froze.
The only thing that resembled any sort of medical facility was the bed Phil was currently laying on and the numerous machines he was still hooked up too. To the right of him, an EKG blared the steady beat of his heart, the graph shown on the screen reflecting onto the fluid bags that were dripping into small tubes, sliding down with gravity until they reached Phil’s arm. An arm that was currently handcuffed to the bed. That shouldn’t be a problem, though. Clint had taught him every way imaginable to get out of-
Steve rolled his eyes. “I didn’t think it was a good idea, but it was a necessary one. You need to fall in line and realize you aren’t in charge here.
one that he didn’t think he’d ever find again, one that he can’t think of living without again.
She gave a small smile.  “That will be all, Mr. Stark.”
Steve let the man recover, well, as much as he could with shattered bones, before walking back up to him. Steve grabbed his chin, forcing him to make eye contact. “Now that I have your attention,
There wasn’t even a rival gang in Brooklyn because The Captain’s forces swoop in as soon as someone even thinks about mentioning the word ‘rebellion’. Tony still remembered what had happened to Schmidt’s gang. HYDRA came from an old family, its name ran deep in New York. They had been established long before the other mob even blinked into existence, but one run in with the Captain, and boom, they were gone. Destroyed. Eradicated.
I’m sure you can understand why I’m not too happy.”  Pierce tapped his fingers in annoyance against the dark wood of his desk. His tired eyes swiveled across the room, barely furnished and impersonal. Of course, that was what he was going for. While usually he found it ironically the safest to direct HYDRA proceedings within the walls of the NYPD precinct, Pierce had often, perhaps too often, ended up at other discrete locations in order to safely conduct business. He wasn’t sure which one he was at now, not like it mattered. His men were outside, guarding the door. There were no wiretaps, no bugs, no threats. He was safe here; HYDRA was safe.
Rhodey was laughing, grabbing at him, shaking him that Tony couldn’t help but reach up and grab Rhodey’s hands, almost crying when they felt solid and warm against him palms.
Tony could start to feel a fire burning low in his gut, Steve’s fingers only stoking the flames. He arched clear off the bed again and ground down onto the fingers harder. Dear Lord, is this what he’s been missing out on?
“Oh?”
Steve sighed. “No, Thor. No it was not.”
Bucky looked over to see paramedics swarming the downed man. Logically, Bucky knew that if Coulson had survived that gun spray that he was in the best hands possible, but that didn’t make his choice any easier. Coulson was basically part of the crew; he couldn’t just leave a man behind.
Please comment!
he had replied softly, hand trailing gently over Tony's freshest bruises. That one had had the shape of his father's class ring.
“Since when is he
At least he still had Bucky. The stubborn, bold shades that refused to be covered up completely, no matter how many new layers you tacked on. Not that Steve would ever want to, anyway.
