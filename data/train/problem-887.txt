“Right. You know the deal,” he said, face set in a serious expression. “Keep to the side until I decide it's clear. Got it?” He had his gun out now. He was lovely. Sherlock nodded and squeezed himself in the corner after hitting the button for the top floor, watching John.
“No, I must clarify. I understand serial killers. They're not encumbered by niceness or niceties or social rules or constructs or expectations,” Sherlock opined from the bottom of his shrivelled and non-existent heart.
Creating meaningful connections to people was difficult, and Sherlock was surprised at how gratified he was by his connection to John, despite John being what one would term a 'normal' human being. This was the reason why he was at least trying to be patient with him and his struggles with the non-existent truth of his sexuality.
She laughed, but that too was as though she'd learned it from a teacher rather than a natural reaction. “Please do,” she said. “Herbert, wait outside,” she added and the driver did so, closing the door quietly behind himself which left Sherlock alone in the room with the woman.
Seeing all of those emotionally charged scenes, even if they were stationary and old, made Sherlock tired. So many faces to scan and match up to corresponding emotional states, a skill Sherlock had practised and largely mastered over the years, and which was detrimental to his health right now. He was also sore everywhere. He pushed the suitcase away (but didn't return it to where he got it), grabbed the pain tablets and downed a few with the help of the stale water from the bottle. Then dragged himself onto the bed (narrow, hard) and closed his eyes.
John was doing some of that human stuff with her, asking if she needed... something. Sherlock wasn't listening. He'd steepled his fingers in front of himself, leaning his elbows on the arms of the chair. How could he get rid of the girl as fast as possible so they (himself and John) could go see about the selfstore? He could just get up and leave, but John had just given him a kiss (first one John had ever initiated) and he was inclined to be good to him for now.
“Interesting. Elaborate.” Sherlock shifted a bit, physically indicating his interest in case John opened his eyes. He could read the minutiae of other people's body language, but he often forgot he also needed to emote physically. Mimicking body positions and gestures was a sign of openness and of being in sync (though it was usually done unconsciously). He was getting better at it though, possibly because he was often (enough) genuinely interested in John.
“Right,” he heard John say and he also heard the utter relief in his voice though only a handful of minutes had passed. The lack of light did strange things to people, even ones with John's experience with horrors of human life.
The manuscript was a treatise on nature and natural sciences, which was as much as Sherlock had already deduced from the illustrations in it. Many of the drawings depicted plants that didn't exist, but there were also portrayals of astrological and even astronomical in nature. Whether they existed or not was not something Sherlock had knowledge of. Representations of nude women were also in abundance but Sherlock hadn't yet understood their significance—he inferred it could have something to do with medical science. However, the drawings were of secondary interest to him as the text itself was his primary focus.
The doctor looked at them both with an expectant face, but when nothing happened and when understanding didn't dawn on their faces he asked: “Would you like to see it in action?”
“Oh?” John's eyebrows shot up, but then he shrugged and rolled his head in a gesture of unconcern. “Yeah. I'll tell you later.”
The cane, though too short, was actually a rather good idea as Sherlock found out making his way back into his room to clothe himself as well. He partook liberally in the paracetamol still there and pocketed the bottle, as well as Molly's ID card for Barts in case he needed to visit the bodies before actual visiting hours for the morgue.
“John,” Sherlock said when John looked like he might strangle the old man on the spot. He put his hand on John's shoulder. “Let go. Let him explain.”
“John, the temperature, what is the room temperature here?” Sherlock was hoping he could find potassium permanganate to combine with the glycerine in the hand-sanitiser to create fire. KMnO4 was not a rare compound and was used it water treatment, he thought it was completely plausible he could find some here.
Sherlock was resigned to having to hear this out. John wouldn't take no for an answer and if Sherlock tried to leave, John would probably sit on him and then tell him all about the bloody dog.
“Not really a client when we didn't even take the case,” John pointed out. “And look what happened.” He gestured at the box, guilt beginning to make its scrawl across his face. ‘I trusted you,’ his face said. ‘I trusted your judgement,’ his body echoed.
It was clear she hadn't been taken into white slavery or any other colour of slavery, nor had she been forced into prostitution. She had, however, been taken against her will and killed. Although Sherlock wasn't sure she'd been
“No, why?” John went to sit in his chair, picking up the paper which he must've fetched earlier. How much earlier? How long had Sherlock slept? For God's sake, it was almost noon.
“Mummy deserves to know,” Mycroft said in carefully off-handed manner which meant it was anything but off-handed.
“Why would they? And she won't tell,” Sherlock replied, glancing at John who was now stuck on some hawthorn. He was worrying again.
“Shoot me,” Sherlock said earnestly, but it came out in bubbles and spit, some of which ended as red spots on John's stripey shirt.
“Touching, but no.” Sherlock glanced at him. “And to answer your question, I believe the smell originates from the incredible clutter inside the house.”
“Ah...” Molly grabbed a file and flipped through the few pages in it. “Looks like it was logged in at 12:17pm, so about forty-five minutes ago. I- I wasn't here. I was-”
“He's not like that,” she said a bit quietly, but loud enough for John to hear as well as he stepped past her into the corridor leading to the mortuary.
“Yeah,” Sherlock agreed, still somewhat perplexed by this transformation. Not that he was going to question it. Was he happy Gibson had been murdered? So actually he was going to question it. “You look… relaxed.”
“Mrs Bertram has four children, Thomas, Edmund, Maria and Julia. They were all at the scene to console their mother so I was able to question all of them.” He stopped to look at Sherlock, as if Sherlock had trouble keeping up. He may have been mute but he wasn't dumb!
“Yeah, it just doesn't mean that the person is still alive.” John stood by him anyway, looking around, making sure they were alone and undisturbed. Not that the area was teeming with people or anything. It was still a sign of loyalty. Sherlock stopped fiddling with the tumblers for a moment and looked up at John. His jaw was moving as he repeatedly grit his teeth and then relaxed again. He had learned it was usually a marker of frustration (or anger) when it came to John. John was gazing across the garden, not acknowledging him, though he must have known Sherlock was looking (he had been a soldier, he must have learned how to use his peripheral vision).
A door closed and a pounding silence fell on Sherlock, pressing him into the rug. He drooled blood onto the rug out of spite and attempted to get his seized limbs under control. He flopped and rolled, going “John, John, John,” without breath, mouth thick with hurt. John was typically SLOW.
Sherlock sat still, feeling paralysed and boneless. The warmth from John's hands and breath seeped into his skin and he could count the hair follicles on John's face. He could see the blood vessels in the sclera of John's eyes and separate the pigments in the iris (blue-brown central heterochromia).
Dear John! Darling John. A medical coma! Sherlock blinked at him, feeling uplifted. He forgot sometimes that John made a study of him in the same way he did of John, and John was aware of some of his less socially approved needs. He didn't always condone or understand, but he knew what Sherlock went through and he wanted to help. That would be his downfall, Sherlock knew (sometimes he felt practically clairvoyant). Moments like this Sherlock couldn't bear to be alive (or conscious) and getting some medically assisted sleep wasn't above him, and John wasn't above offering it when he saw his best friend suffering (a fact Sherlock wasn't above using to his advantage, either).
boredom and the inability to do anything about it; a brain full of snakes eating their tails, refusing to let the sufferer fall asleep.) It had turned out they didn't.
that?” John asked then, voice loud and accusing. He was disposed to disagree with all use of human test subjects (less with already dead ones, depending on where in the flat he came across them).
At 4am Sherlock was awake in the unnatural glow of his mobile, typing a text message to John. He was aware of the very faint ding that was audible through the thin structure of the house (he also had excellent aural abilities) when his message made it through to John's phone. A very long moment followed which Sherlock spent in agitation, dragging himself up from bed and into the loo. As he was inspecting the swollen side of his face he finally received a reply to his text. A rather peevish one. John was overreacting. They'd had a solid several hours of sleep and early morning was the best time to go about without everyone interrupting (why was this concept so hard for John to grasp).
“Stop skipping,” John muttered as they headed for the banks of lockers. “It's making you look suspiciously gleeful.”
“The wall-paper was what interested me most. It was yellow, aged, covered with a slightly darker yellow pattern in a way that defied the human eye's ability to follow it, but I had seen it before, during another case. The police at the scene was at a loss, naturally, and Lestrade wasn't even on the case. I texted him to meet me where I'd first seen this type of wall-paper when I left.”
“It's OBVIOUS,” Sherlock cut him off with no small amount of derision. “Showing off would be leaving the corpse somewhere immediately visible and not chopped up into pieces. This is hardly the spot. It's been here hours, but not over twelve. The victim has been dead for less than twenty-four. It's an inept body drop by an inept killer.” He'd seen enough of the cuts on the separated body parts to spot the hesitation marks. Very little blood, however. Drained before being packed up and transported.
“What?” John chuckled, still amused by the previous quip, so slow to change gears and reconfigure for the matter at hand.
Sherlock pressed the cushion tighter to his face, hoping to smother himself and go unconscious. Instead he listened to John drop into his arm chair and stretch.
“Don't you think a mystery deserves to be solved?” Sherlock made a face at him and got up. He needed a shower and then they needed to get to the storage facility. Depending on what was there they'd return to look over the autopsy report. “Doesn't matter, we need to move onto the selfstore.”
. And then it was only an old woman with neurological issues. It was such a let-down, such a disappointment, such a boring reality.
But if that was the case (and it was) what had happened in that room with Alice Waite? It wasn't just improbable (something that Sherlock loved) but also impossible. Transposing a consciousness (‘A soul,’ said John's echo in his mind) was an absurd thought. Shared psychosis was the only real possibility because while it was improbable it was at least possible. But how could she have triggered it so easily? How could she have triggered it at all?
“Yeah, the area's a nature reserve of some sort,” Lestrade kept going, accustomed to the interruptions. “Popular spot for them.”
Even though both Sherlock and John preferred to keep their separate rooms and separate beds a recent development in their relationship was intentionally sleeping in the same bed. It had changed Sherlock's routine somewhat where instead of getting up when he woke up, he tended to stay in bed a little longer, sometimes working, sometimes just sitting there watching John. Right now he was sat up against the headboard of the bed with his laptop, looking over the preliminary autopsy report Molly had sent him.
He surfaced from the Lovecraftian depths of his sleep when the floor creaked under John's step (yes, Sherlock could recognise it in his sleep, his auditory sense was perfectly attuned). His brain engaged his consciousness and made him open his eyes to the blurry sight of John standing over him.
“That's all I needed.” Sherlock nodded and settled back down, taking out his mobile to overview the texts Lestrade had sent him about looking for the murderer outside the locked room.
“Was the key in your report?” Sherlock asked and Molly jumped a little, dropping the pair of latex gloves she'd been putting on.
There was a building slated for renovations beginning in a month's time in January, closed off for the time being, destined to become offices. A Jane Wentworth was listed as the interior designer linked to the project. Sherlock knew she would come up missing, he knew this was the place. He needed to get there, and he needed John there. He attempted to make eye-contact with John over the top of the list and when that didn't work he dropped the papers and pointedly picked up his bowl of soup. Just how thick was John being, and just how obvious was Sherlock going to have to be?
“Please move where I can see you and keep your hands up, Dr Watson,” she directed John who had been behind the tank. “You look well, Mr Holmes. All things considered,” she glanced at him, but kept her eyes on John. She knew he was the threat (at least in Sherlock's current condition). Clever.
“John,” he re-attempted and it was slightly better, the j was almost there and the o, but not much else. It, however, worked and John poked his round head into the room after a moment. His hair was silvery white in the glow of the hall light but his face was a blob of shadow in Sherlock's eyes, one almost working and the other almost open.
“And you found Viktor's house and led the government dogs there so it had to be purged. I knew you had one of the manuscripts, but that was not a problem. It's the one that I leaked on purpose to Wilfrid Voynich back in the late 19
Sherlock nodded and shuffled to the sitting room, lowering himself on the sofa with some care, hoisting his cast up on the arm rest. He dug his phone out of the pocket of his dressing gown and texted Lestrade, demanding to be updated on the (his) case, while John went about heating a can of tomato soup.
Lestrade consulted his notebook while John stood to the side and stared down at the corpse with a frown. But not a frown of displeasure, more one of thoughtfulness. “He, uhh… he said he'd been ‘taken’ by someone called Alice. Then he started choking and clutching at his neck,” Lestrade read his notes, then closed the notebook again. “Could it be multiple personality disorder?”
“Why are outward signs of happiness always suspect?” Sherlock asked, walking in a more measured way.
“OF COURSE it is,” Sherlock snapped immediately. “Stop trying to psychoanalyse his twisted idea of familial duties and hang up!”
John obeyed but used his torch to scout out what was behind the door that now hung sadly off its hinges and the lock shattered. “I took part in a recon mission in Afghanistan,” he said, “to find a way to help civilians that were held by an extremist group. They held about twenty women and children in a ten square metre room and this is the way it smelled when we got them out.”
The bedside table boasted a little reading light, Sherlock's newly acquired lighter, John's mobile charger, some change (60p), a three-quarters full water bottle and a little notepad and pencil. Sherlock sat on the bed and flipped through the notepad: the first page had a female name and a mobile number, the next one had an old to-do list (laundry, unclog drain, pay rent, write blog, ring shrink, all of which were crossed over except the one about rent), the following page was shopping list (laundry detergent, hand soap, shampoo and jam), and so on and so forth. Sherlock dropped the notepad and looked in the drawers.
The first page in the binder bore a black and white image of a coat of arms, black and white, of an open book. On the left side was a falcon and on the right side a snake, on top were leaves of what seemed to be holly and a key. Beneath the crest was a ribbon that held the words
Sherlock turned back to look at John at the sound of his name. Not because it was his name (maybe a little), but because of the tone of voice John had used. That fond-serious thing he used surprisingly often. Surprising because he used it at Sherlock, for Sherlock.
It was late afternoon when the cab deposited Sherlock and John outside the residence at the address Mr Ljuga had supplied to the selfstore. Despite the relative brightness of said afternoon (it was cloudy, but not dark) the house—mansion, really—looked (not foreboding, that would've implied Sherlock was afraid of a building) old. Desiccated and untended vines grew over it and dominated the front garden. A wrought-iron gate blocked the driveway and the rest was surrounded by a brick fence. The windows were dark.
Sherlock moved forward and crouched by the corpse, using a gloved finger to move aside the collar. There were hand-shaped bruises around the neck, as though someone had stood right in front of the late Arthur Gibson and strangled him in a room full of police. Except no one had been there.
Sherlock writhed. This was different sort of mental torture, also caused by John. He wanted to be mean and he wanted to lash out, but he couldn't (lisping and slurring words was not threatening). He gave John a painful glance that John failed to notice (again), being too concentrated on what was on the screen of his laptop. John looked resigned. The glare of the monitor wasn't doing any favours to his crumpled face, and then Sherlock felt bad for one hundredth of a second.
“What do you think of ‘The Visitor’ for a title?” John asked instead, showing his aggressive unimpressed-ness.
This building seemed a little more temporary. It was filled with electric radiators for heating, a rudimentary set of cooking appliances as well as chairs, tables, stacked up crates (very familiar wooden ones) creating makeshift bookshelves. A few laptops, a server, and papers spilling onto the floor.
“Why the psilocybin!” Sherlock said louder than he meant. There was another crack of thunder right then and he felt it rattle through the house and up through his feet. The hair on his body was standing on end.
“Remember he's human, remember it's wrong to kill humans...” John muttered while pulling on the shirt Sherlock had thrown on him.
“I know we've a real case, too.” John glanced at him. “I know it comes first, but we could really use the money, and it'll probably be an easy one.” John looked at him again, hopeful with the ‘we.’
“It's one of those paying jobs, you know, that pay actual money rather than gloating points. Gloating points don't pay the rent.”
“Oh, the dose was too low, then,” Sherlock faked a pout. He hadn't actually poisoned John (this time), but at least John would pay attention to him now.
The lifts were on the ground floor and the doors opened with a faint ding when John pressed the call button. He checked the interior before letting Sherlock in, then backed in himself, keeping an eye on the foyer until it disappeared behind the doors.
Sherlock had calculated that a fast approach would be best to keep the integrity of the floor and the collapsing piles as near to their current state as possible. He reversed his position and slid down feet first, cringing as he hit the water and was swallowed by it up to his ribs. Even the water seemed thick with filth and the air as well, the dust stirred up again by his descent. He managed to keep his balance and not slip completely underwater, but the dampness sneaked up his suit and coat anyway.
He listened for the ding of John's phone, which was followed by a chuckle, and John calling out: “Thank you for including your initials, I wouldn't have guessed it was you otherwise.”
“That was A case, not THE case,” Sherlock groused. Annoyed both because John didn't immediately know and because he had the distinct feeling he'd ruined a moment. Moments in general were fleeting and ephemeral and not worth the effort but on occasion Sherlock felt some moments should last longer. Which was irrational because moments by definition didn't last long as the present was constantly becoming the past—except in the unlikely scenario of beings able to experience time in a non-linear way.
“What?” John asked. Had Sherlock spoken in an unclear manner? He scanned back his words and decided they were informative enough to not clarify his stance.
Stairs. One minute overtime. Thirty-six minutes elapsed. Twenty-four minutes until the onset of hypothermia (no longer because of the water but because of wet clothes, John wore blends, synthetic, that was good).
Sherlock had what he wanted so he left. It had nothing to do with Molly's disapproval or his lack of sleep or the ache in his mid-torso which he assumed was hunger. Certainly not an emotional response (such as the previously discussed guilt). The victim's journey from a nightclub into several plastic baggies in a nature reserve was a pleasant puzzle for his mind to masticate on as he made his way back to Baker Street.
“You can try brushing your teeth if you want. Shaving is optional, using the peroxide mouthwash is not. I'll bring you something to drink and some painkillers.”
John shrugged. “Is there anything else I can do?” he said with a philosophical bent Sherlock wasn't sure he appreciated. This was one of the times he found himself completely unable to explain to John how he felt (or how he imagined he felt).
“I expect the police already spoke to you,” John said politely, sitting up straight on the edge of the armchair. “But is there anything you could tell us about Miss Price?”
The issue at hand was that, deep down, Sherlock shared many similarities with the people they caught and committed to the gentle care of the police. And it wasn't even that deep down. Certainly not as deep down as Sherlock knew John would've preferred. Perhaps it was a flaw in Sherlock's psycho-social matrix that he preferred consequentialism and could understand that not everything came easily, peacefully or without pain and sacrifice. Even if the sacrifice was other people's lives.
“Mm, before I forget,” John said suddenly. “My things are in a paper bag under the bed. You should take a look. Those men weren't that observant when they went through my pockets. Must've been the smell and the fact I almost threw up on them.”
“Price,” Sherlock said. The chair was uncomfortable and the lack of illumination in the room made its dimensions indefinable.
“He could've eaten someone. For me.” Sherlock remained very disappointed about that. He rested his head down on the pillow, but soon yanked it back up. “Why did Mycroft have the SIS take away his corpse and the autopsy reports? Why were they at the house? What
Like about his phone, which was right there, on the nightstand, recharging. Sherlock picked it up and bypassed the number lock easily. He'd not told John he knew it so he wouldn't change it. That treatment was reserved for the laptop (it was amusing to watch him try remember his latest password).
This was completely correct, Sherlock DID have an extraordinary mind. She rose up and moved back to the side table, calm and slow. Sherlock turned his head slightly because she was on his left side and he couldn't see very well out of that eye.
The girl reappeared in the doorway, querulously saying that the ambulance was on the way, then gaping at Sherlock who grimaced at her and saw her (to his great satisfaction) go pale and swallow and turn away. He snorted and some of the blood that had gone down his throat came out of his nose.
“Step back a bit,” he said, but hardly waited for Sherlock to do so. He eyed the door for a bit, then kicked it in. “Guess we'll find out if there's alarms now.”
“Yes?” she asked, eyeing Sherlock with interest. “I know you. Sherlock Holmes, the detective. It seems you've got what was coming to you.”
“It's like he… woke up,” Lestrade sighed. Sherlock, standing in the room with his back to John and Lestrade who were by the door, could hear Lestrade's jacket shuffling as he rubbed his face. “First he was asleep, really calm at everything that was happening. Didn't seem to mind at all he was being brought in for multiple homicides.”
“You don't do hallucinogenics,” John replied. “I know that. Give me some credit.” He smiled very slightly, not out of amusement but rather out of fondness. Or maybe it was self-satisfaction. But it wasn't that empty mimicry of a real expression Alice had used.
“You're the one who brought up the mesolimbic pathway.” John pushed Sherlock's foot away and stood up. “The amount of nicotine patches you use has gone up and you keep wanting more.” He pocketed the packet of patches.
Sherlock looked at John with more care. “Yeah,” he said quietly. Sometimes John's perceptive abilities slipped under his radar because they weren't as good as his. They also weren't tuned the same way as his so the results weren't the same either. It wasn't that humans were the same as bees, it was that Sherlock considered them the same and John understood that.
John gave him a look ('This is not over, Sherlock') and answered. “Hello, Mycroft. How can I help you? Again?”
“I want you to have this.” Gibson picked up a binder and handed it to Sherlock. “I hope my show of goodwill is enough for a more lenient sentencing.”
His mobile battery was completely drained now so he had no chance to to check whether Lestrade had sent anything regarding the case with the locked room (which he now knew for certain had been a bait by Mycroft) and he also couldn't text Molly to ask whether she'd included the key found in the hand in her autopsy report. If she had, then Mycroft knew about it and knew that it was missing. Considering where Sherlock and John had been apprehended, Mycroft probably also had a pretty good idea of who was in possession of said key right now. However, he might not have known what it opened, which is why Sherlock needed to talk to Molly, to find out how she had described it in her report, if at all. It hadn't been in any of the preliminary work Molly had sent him the previous night because of obvious reasons.
On occasion Sherlock was somewhat taken aback when he realised John had seen and experienced rather terrible things and that they lived somewhere in his subconscious as memories of how dreadful humans could be to other humans. Sherlock of course was not and wouldn't have been shocked because he KNEW just how unfeeling people could be (himself included), but to John it was just proof that he must try harder to be the exact opposite, and helping Sherlock with the cases made him feel like he was doing something. Sherlock could not convince him otherwise despite several tries and explanations and even tangible situations.
“Yes, he told me several boring suicides had happened there over the years he'd worked in Scotland Yard, and one open-and-shut murder case where the murderer turned himself in on the spot.”
“You're in my bed. Again.” John said then, lying back down. It was true Sherlock had been visiting John's bed an inordinate amount in the last few days.
“Depends on the definition of good and on who is doing the defining,” Sherlock muttered, putting his phone away. “It doesn't matter. We have the key and the books and this.”
Sherlock ran his hands through his damp hair (it curled even more) and stomped into the sitting room, making sure to hit his heels on the floor hard enough to jar himself with every step. “John,” he said again.
The first viewing of the tape prompted another diagnosis from Lestrade. “Schizophrenia?” he uttered, giving Sherlock a glance. And when Sherlock didn't respond, a third one during the second viewing: “Drugs? I mean, that's not normal.”
Oh. The violin. Sherlock lowered it. John's touch radiated visceral memory up his arm and into his body. His body shivered in a violent reaction to the clinging damp and new cold sweat on his skin. His t-shirt was soaked in the back and to clung to him uncomfortably, his extremities ached in the frigid air and his heart was reeling in the cavity of his chest.
Sherlock gave him another grin and grabbed another piece of toast off his plate and headed out. He could finally translate the book properly and unveil what was most certainly an international secret society performing experiments (on humans!) that even he hadn't dreamed of.
“Where did you learn that? Does that include you?” John yawned as he brought Sherlock a plate with two pieces of toast, covered in marmalade. “Don't answer that.”
It was tempting. The smell of burnt oil and egg matter was not, but Sherlock had long ago learned to control his senses and could ignore it, and it was hardly the most horrible thing he'd smelled in his life (that, he maintained, was marzipan). He HAD solved the case, but they hadn't seen it through yet. Sherlock knew where the killer was, living inconspicuously at the house his family had sold to the city, he'd have formed an unhealthy attachment to the place, perhaps believing it gave him unnatural power, much as any talisman or crystal sold in New Age shops. Humans were so predictable.
“Yes, yes, waiting for Lestrade who didn't show up.” Which could be because Sherlock had texted him to look into the locked-room business. Oh well.
“You could help me find my wallet. Haven't seen it since last night.” John followed him, patiently (annoyingly) waited until Sherlock gave up and sat up on the sofa, too much in pain to lie down.
Her eyes narrowed briefly, but then she relaxed the muscles consciously (visible to anyone watching) and smiled again. “Isn't it marvellous?” She paused for a moment. “I expect you found the original room?”
“There's a soft spot on the floor here,” Sherlock said as he inched forward, feeling the floor bend under his step. He could see an intersection some metres in front of them.
“Go home,” John said after a few more kisses, his hand still cupping the curve of Sherlock's jaw. “Or go solve a case. But stop bugging me. I want to sleep.”
“Tea's up,” was the next thing Sherlock became aware of. He was still on the sofa, and John was standing by him, holding out a cup of tea. “I think the man wasn't forced to eat that hand, he ate it because he was hungry. That's why he left the hospital in the first place, yeah?”
Amorphous finger-like shadows were creeping up the walls from the corner of the room and across the floor. “What if I say no?” Sherlock asked. Even his own voice sounded wrong. Trying to move felt as though he was underwater.
“Were you submerged when you fell in?” Sherlock got up, looking around, moving forward to the intersection.
“Oh well.” Sherlock shrugged and grinned and continued gloating as he speed-walked down the street to find them a cab.
“John.” Sherlock hopped onto the bed, making the lump under the covers jump. “ABC Selfstore, they have three locations in London and two of them are 24-hour accessible. Was Molly going to run the hand's fingerprints, or have someone else do it? When?”
Sherlock pressed his lips together, fighting the urge to grab a red pen and correct the grammar of the message. That at least was somewhat interesting, though most likely a drunk girl's panicked misunderstanding of what was going on around her as she woke in an unfamiliar place.
“Come on, Sherlock. It's time to wake up. Rise and shine. God, you're gorgeous this morning. You need a wash and a shave, but first you need to let me know you're alive. There you go, open your eyes.”
In the end it was a cab that took them the thirty odd kilometres to the site and not a helicopter. Sherlock had given some serious thought about calling one when they were caught in a mid-morning rush (one of the downsides of residing mid-London). Their eventual approach to the site (many tedious years later, if one asked Sherlock) was marked by some dog-walkers from the nearby suburbia loitering around the edges of the police perimeter and Lestrade standing in the car lot waiting for them. There was an old priory building on the other side and some nature surrounding it, the target for the now denied dog-walkers.
“Are you certain you won't have coffee?” she asked and raised her arm in his direction, only a vague blur in Sherlock's sight. Then something hit his side, followed by bright white light in his eyes and the pain of forcefully contracting muscles, driving him off the chair and onto the floor. He was able to take a short breath before another wave of pain broke over him, replacing the white light with darkness.
“Oh,” Alice began, using every fibre of Sherlock's deep voice to her obvious delight. She pulled out the vowel as long as she could until it mixed with the constant thrum of the thunder in Sherlock's ears.
They watched each other for a moment, until she made the first move. Sherlock was very good at silences.
The ideas presented in the text were far more advanced than the time period of its provenance (early 15th century) should have allowed. Sherlock was both impressed and curious, particularly because the details eluded him due to his hasty translating process. Towards the evening, after some eight or so hours of work, he also came to the startling conclusion that the manuscript and the pages in the binder didn't match in their entirety. Either the ex-professor had done work of his own (likely) or there was another source aside from the Voynich manuscript (also possible).
Sherlock didn't have any idea what he was looking at but it wasn't something he was about to admit. John seemed alarmed. He didn't have such good experiences with strange laboratories.
“I've already caught two of them.” Sherlock rolled his eyes and threw down the coat and the binder. Of course Mycroft knew about them, he'd been there to catch him stumbling out of the house that ‘didn't exist.’
John had an expression which Sherlock realised with a lurch of his heart was adoration. An expression saying he was looking at something amazing. Sherlock liked it when he could see the proof of that adoration on John's face even if he knew it existed when he couldn't as well. He'd realised that knowledge wasn't always enough, which was a whole other sinkhole to fall into. Knowing was supposed to be better than feeling.
“I've stepped on a dead person, John,” Sherlock informed him calmly. He turned on the light on his mobile to check. “Yep. Dead. Handless. I do believe I've located Mr Ljuga.” (Assuming it was Mr Ljuga who had lost his hand, assuming Mr Ljuga had given his real name at the selfstore, assuming Mr Ljuga owned this deathtrap of a house.)
Experiments were, in general, something that Sherlock approved of. He was aware that John made a difference between experiments performed on dead bodies, parts of dead bodies, bacteria, sponges, foodstuffs and household items and those performed on living things, humans in particular. While Sherlock saw no need for animal cruelty, he had no reservations about human experiments. They yielded the best and most interesting results. Humans were a very self-interested species and all their experimentation was to benefit themselves in some way, and as objectionable as human rights activists found it, experiments performed on humans gave the most relevant data about humans.
“Are you nauseous?” Sherlock asked upon seeing that look, partly because she had annoyed him. “Pregnant perhaps?” A direct hit on her faltering relationship with Lestrade.
What remained of Arthur Gibson was a husk of meat on the floor behind the table and the chair that had been pushed aside. A cup of water was turned over and splashed on the floor. His clothes were in disarray.
“Could it be... he was forging something, making it look as though it was made in the 15th century, to pass off as a fake?” John asked next.
“I inspected the body for clues because the police officer that had accompanied it had clearly been hired from the policing for IDIOTS school and had no worthwhile input even when questioned with the utmost simplicity.” Sherlock grunted in disgust. “What interested me were the traces of the yellow, papery substance under the body's fingernails. I took a sample and left to look at the crime scene.”
“Oh, I see,” John said calmly. “The corpse has already been opened so it's not interesting any more, but the storage locker hasn't and it's bothering you.”
“Oh… well, human lives are cheap,” Gibson said, uncomfortable and clearly in some pain from being hurled against the window. It was the wrong thing to say. “Using animals would get the attention of animal abuse agencies and that would be a horrible pain. Human advocates are far fewer in between.”
“Hmm,” the lady intoned and dug out a silver cigarette packet, extracting one for herself and then offering one for each of them. John declined (as expected), but Sherlock was eager to accept and lit up with his own lighter, feeling considerably better for the moment, even if the future held many put-upon looks from John and a lecture about quitting. The cigarettes were hand-rolled, there was just enough filter to be called a filter and the rest was blissful tar and nicotine.
“Have you ears? Eyes? It's OBVIOUS I've been struck in the face. I'm limping, favouring my left side, extensive bruising. I'm back early from a case, so it's not gone according to plan, Lestrade's car has a distinct sound, you must have heard him drive up, the street was empty. We spoke at length, with volume, the window was open because you needed fresh air for your headache, so you also must have heard us. You mixed your drinks last night because you're an idiot and think you're twenty years younger than you are.”
“Stay,” he said. The fire created enough light for him to turn off his mobile and save what little battery was left. John had been completely submerged in the water so he was wet from head to toe and needed the warmth. In the meanwhile Sherlock needed to find them an egress. This was the first floor, if he could find a window he could break it and they could exit that way. Considering this room had obviously seen more use than what they'd seen of the house previously, there must have been a path that led out.
There was a pause. Sherlock didn't move much yet, not wanting to cause another avalanche. “Literally, or..?” he finally asked.
“You never tire of rubbing it in, do you?” Lestrade sighed and dropped the records on the coffee table. “Thanks, mate,” he continued when John brought him a cup of tea, and a little bowl of soup to Sherlock with a look of ‘eat it or I eat you.’
“John,” Sherlock said while working with acetone to undo the glue (usually not recommended for removing glue from skin, but the hand was already dead (the man who had previously possessed the hand—no idea), what harm could it do at this point). He'd taken a seat and had Molly hovering nearby, quiet though radiating worry and uncertainty. It was annoying. “Can you check what's in his stomach? And Molly, it's late, I could use caffeine. About 200 millilitres will do. Two sugars.”
“Sherlock,” John said, looming suddenly in Sherlock's field of vision. “Stop smoking while on your back. You might set your hair on fire. Or blind yourself.” On top of being patronising John plucked the last of Sherlock's cigarette out of his fingers and put it out in the ashtray on the polished coffee table.
It was true John got kidnapped alarmingly often in criminal attempts to rouse Sherlock's interest and Sherlock briefly considered texting him. But the man was a soldier and a doctor (as he liked to remind Sherlock) and he wasn't going to get killed. Sherlock stared at the light on the electric kettle so he didn't have to look at Mycroft. A dead John was a thought he didn't dwell on. It made his senses want to shut down.
“Oh yes, I can show you the mechanics.” Gibson nodded and beamed at him again in a way that made him seem harmless, but nothing removed that determination Sherlock had first witnessed. John stood near the door, repeatedly gathering his hands into fists and releasing them—a preparatory nervous tic Sherlock had seen countless times. It helped John concentrate and stay on top of any mounting stress he might be feeling.
Sherlock considered the crutches. He could attach something sharp to one end and use one as a harpoon to spear John, but then everything hurt at the same time and he had to resign himself to at least listening to John's explanation. Maybe hearing him out would cause a brain haemorrhage from the sheer stupidity and he'd die of it.
Then Sherlock turned onto his side, facing the back of the sofa and got ready to suffer some more. The easy (insulting) cases always left him underwhelmed. He heard John creak up from his chair (his right knee always popped when he bent his leg) and step across the floor.
“At that point Lestrade was contacted by the police, letting him know there was another corpse. A young woman like the first one, basically in the same condition, wearing the same thing, with the same sort of residue under her fingernails, but also in her mouth unlike the previous corpse.”
“John,” he said quietly, making John look up and clamber back onto his feet. The men advanced, most of them just flowing past them with SIS precision. Two of them stopped to guard Sherlock and John until a third one (they were all interchangeable in their gear) approached.
Electricity hummed above the drop-ceiling, traffic was faintly audible through the floors and walls. The windows at the ends of the corridors weren't covered and intermittently allowed light into the interior. Sherlock leaned the crutches carefully against a wall and crouched down. Fine dust was gathered on the floor. When he leaned right down, with his cheek almost to the floor he was able to find an angle where he could see where the dust was disturbed against the grey light from the outside.
“You can plead your case to the Detective Inspector once he arrives,” Sherlock said as John stepped out of the building with mobile in hand and a grim look on his face. “But I know men like him and my John don't see the scientific value of what you're doing, if there indeed is any. They will only see the people you killed.”
The cabinet in the first room wasn't locked and Sherlock was able to get it open. It, too, had fallen victim to damp and was of a different era in its shape. What he found was a collection of old chemistry equipment and a few rolls of the yellow wall-paper. Useless. This was the preparation room, as it were, for the madness space beyond. Undoubtedly of great use once upon a time, and precious enough for the killer to preserve, but she had moved on.
“He was calm, then he wasn't. And then he was dead,” Lestrade supplied, somewhat more composed. “You want to watch the security tape?”
“Regret is for people who can't handle their own decisions!” Sherlock called out after his brother despite the ominous warning. He had no time for regret. Regret meant looking back and the past was already done, that's why it was in the past. And so far humans were only able to travel to the future when it came to time.
Sherlock didn't enjoy disappointing John on a regular basis, but neither did he enjoy the expectations laid at his door on just as regularly. An equilibrium was the desirable outcome. And even though Sherlock was not prone to introspection and what-ifs he wondered, as he stroked John's hair, if that equilibrium would cause John to stop looking at him in that distinctive way he did when he was pleased.
“N-no,” John admitted, having pressed close to Sherlock, now shaking from the strength of Sherlock's vigorous rubbing. “But you do and that worries me.”
“You expect too much of me,” he said, but then continued immediately: “Do you still want to sleep?” He wouldn't apologise. He'd done nothing wrong, but he could offer this conciliatory gesture. He got up and headed towards the bathroom. A bath and then some sleep would serve his abilities well. Operating under sleep deprivation was the same as operating drunk and John had flushed his cocaine so he couldn't rely on that for clarity. Maybe John would join him. In bed. The tub was too small for two people.
Sherlock swept out of the store with a book under each arm and hailed a cab with his foot. Well, technically someone else hailed the cab and Sherlock took it, ignoring all protests because whatever that person had been doing couldn't be more important than what Sherlock had in his hands.
“The two women who were found dead have been identified,” John said, turning into Sherlock's wake and following. “Missing persons database returned a hit on both of them and dental records confirmed.”
“No!” The girl sat forward and snatched the phone from him. “That's the point! She did respond!” She turned the phone around for Sherlock to look at again, this time showing a message on the screen, which had been sent about six hours earlier, at around 6am.
As soon as the door was shut behind Sherlock the man by the car moved to open the back door of the shiny, shark-like car and gestured for him to enter. Sherlock hurried across the street but paused just outside the car. The man, obviously the driver, nodded to him.
She laughed again and shifted somewhat in her wheelchair. “You're closer to the truth than you can even imagine,” she said with mirthless merriment. “But no, not that far. Only about six months.”
“John,” Sherlock said and looked up, only to realise they were in a pub serving English breakfast instead of a cab. There was a plate of food in front of him as well as John who was already eating.
He put his hand flat against the door and pushed, it creaked but didn't give. The door was wooden, crooked from damp and sticking against the frame. The lock was old-fashioned and brown and corroded and the rust had ran down in rivulets under it. Sherlock gave it another push, then stepped back. Lestrade stood below them on the stairs, radioing the people behind the wall.
He was staring at the dust swirling around in the light of the morning when a noise penetrated his introspective shell and his eyes caught movement in his vicinity. Mrs Hudson stood in front of him with her hands on her hips.
“Really,” John said, very flatly. Of course he would take offence at that, their friendship was called into question, which hadn't been Sherlock's aim.
Sherlock almost spit out his toast into his hand so he could be scathing at John, but decided against spitting because chewing alone was quite painful and being scathing might hurt more. As it were, he merely eye-balled John very meanly.
Molly had ruled severe hypoxia as cause of death, based on oxygen levels in blood, brain tissue and heart tissue. The curious part was that she'd found no obvious signs of what had caused said hypoxia. She hadn't been strangled or drowned which were the usual causes. It was like she had just stopped breathing.
“I did and I don't know,” John replied, looking at Sherlock over the top of his laptop. “But what's more likely? A death with natural causes or a death with supernatural causes?”
“What-” John started but Sherlock lurched towards the exit. He stumbled over Herbert's body and fell on his hands and knees but crawled forward. He needed to get away from her. For a brief moment he saw the room again from her point of view, looking up at the bright outline of the door. When he came back to himself he had collapsed on the floor. Then he felt John's hands on him, trying to help him up to his feet.
“How many soldiers died out of boredom while you DID NOTHING because you are so SLOW,” he finally gnashed out from under the cold thing covering half his face as he lay post-inspection on the sofa. “And either get me cigarettes, ten patches or your gun so I can have some RELIEF.”
“All right, I'll bite. How did you know the code?” John said after a few seconds, and Sherlock felt the familiar warmth of being cleverer and more observant than anyone ever, but also the same exasperation he often felt with John whom he knew to have more rattling around in his brain except fluff like people's names.
“He got really upset,” Lestrade cut in. “Started shaking and saying he was innocent.” He paused. “He said he hadn't done any of it, that his- his body had been stolen.”
“I don't really care,” John replied. He was pressing against Sherlock's side very tightly, holding his arms around himself. “Recent research on the left temporo-parietal junction has shown that its response to electricity could be an explanation for seeing and feeling unknown presences in the same room.”
“He didn't just try, he swallowed the hand and choked on it. He also ate a whole rat. Well, I say ate but he just swallowed that too.” Sherlock remembered that autopsy very well. He shifted in the chair and glanced around, trying to pinpoint the fluctuating edges and corners of the room. The scent of flowers and fire was mixed with a slowly rising smell of damp. Rain moved in sheets outside, creating an undulating scenery. Even Alice's shape didn't remain unchanged but gained exaggerated features. Sherlock blinked.
Sherlock closed his eyes which he knew John would take as assent and soon felt John carefully pulling his shoe off, then peeling off his sock. He also undid the bandage.
“Jaz,” she sobbed and looked up. John was moved enough to offer her the box of tissues (or socially pressured enough). “E- everyone calls me Jaz.”
“Do you want to see my medical licence? I'm the doctor, I decide when you're healed. You can't even say 'scrumptious' properly yet. Or 'burglar alarm'.”
Sherlock was prepared to give him that, but not the act of opening the door. John gave him the nod and Sherlock released the latch, pulling the door open into a short staircase up and letting in air that was even more musky and still. It smelled of damp and mould and old wood. The beam of John's torch caught dust motes thousandfold, rising and swirling like snow flurries in the newly agitated air. At the top of the stairs they could just see the bottom half of a door.
“Tell who? Tell what?” Sherlock had crouched in front of the door. “A man had his hand severed. He could still be alive. Don't you think it's our duty to go in and try to find him?”
Sherlock took another step to draw her attention back to himself, then stumbled forward, onto his hands and knees, his leg giving up. He caught his breath and then there was a gunshot. The noise echoed in the empty room, and made the windows rattle, bouncing off the tank with a metallic undertone. Then there was silence, and Miss Price crumpled onto the floor in front of Sherlock. There was a bullet hole in her temple.
“Not what I meant,” John was quick to protest. “I was just surprised. Can we not talk about this now?”
John followed the arc of the cold pack with his eyes, then turned back to Sherlock. “I have some other questions.”
“Really? That's interesting,” John said into the phone, looking at his cuticles while he spoke. He must have known how that irritated Sherlock. Not the cuticles, but the fact he didn't know what Mycroft was saying. WHAT was interesting?! Was it really interesting or was it small talk interesting? Was John doing it on purpose. No, of course not, he didn't have the capacity to dual-process like that.
“You mean Anderson. You know, Scotland Yard has solved some cases without any assistance from you in the past.” Lestrade had the car door open, standing behind it as though it would shield him from Sherlock's ire. “Go in,” he repeated. “I really don't need to be told off again for having you around.”
John sat up, looking disgruntled, but he knew how rare it was for Sherlock to receive a phone call from someone he didn't know. He had a suspicious cast to his sullenness.
Sherlock rolled up the piece he'd carved off the wall and put it in his pocket along with the magnifier, then grabbed the cane and started out of the room. John didn't take long to follow, though he did his ‘leaving a room’ check (windows, doors, people, lights, sharp objects) and turned off the light and closed the door while Sherlock was already on his way down the stairs.
“Oh. Then Saturday night.” Sherlock's eyes wandered across the landscape of the sitting room, unable to settle on anything. Days of the week held little meaning to him so he didn't always pay attention to them.
They exited the building into the rainy mid-morning. The mist from earlier hours had dissipated with the rise of temperature, and John turned up his collar. Sherlock did the same and they smiled at each other, John tired and Sherlock in pain. They got into a cab and John gave the driver the address they'd received from Mrs Haversham.
“You're officially under house arrest until this case is solved, okay? Go in and stay in,” Lestrade sighed.
“Have you informed Dr Watson of his upcoming abduction? Isn't that what ordinarily happens when you become entangled with a criminal organisation?” Mycroft stood by Sherlock's chair in the sitting room, sweeping the clutter with his eyes. (Sherlock was a thing-acquirer.)
Mycroft turned to look at him with that face that either meant concern or constipation (Sherlock always got those mixed up.) “You're mixing with the wrong crowd,” Mycroft said.
“I'm not a child,” Sherlock protested. Mrs Haversham had lit another cigarette from the end of her old one and was watching them, but with an expression of one who wants her solitude back.
John moved, slowly (like a glacier, or a tectonic plate), and bent down to kiss Sherlock on the upper lip. Then he pulled away. “Sorry,” he muttered, looking like he'd been caught with the last Jaffa cake while knowing very well that it was always reserved for Sherlock.
“What do you think of this?” Sherlock picked up the key and showed it to John, who peered at it and shrugged.
. This is how a partnership worked, apparently, giving and taking, though John mostly took Sherlock's patience and Sherlock gave enormously out of his intellect and time.
“Do you remember how you got into bed?” Sherlock countered, deciding that if he couldn't kill John (physically yes, emotionally no, which was already annoying), he'd at least taunt him.
Lestrade stopped following him and Sherlock faintly heard Donovan say something unflattering but the words fell out of his mind almost immediately, leaving no sign they'd ever existed in the first place. If he'd minded all the negative things said about him he would never get anything done.
Sherlock crawled forward, feeling the floor buckle further. His phone was still grasped in his hand, but the dust of the decomposing debris that had been disturbed by the sudden cave-in had made the air thick to the point of being opaque. Sherlock pulled his scarf up to cover his nose and mouth before breathing in more, already feeling the tingle of coughing in his throat.
“Aren't you? You just don't mean it personally because it doesn't matter to you who's died, as long as someone has so you have something to do,” John said with a roll of his eyes. He was surprisingly cavalier about it.
. Why not? A corpse could hardly be offended. Why did other people take offence at the corpse's behest?) It was pointless to try and act according to the rules when they changed so much across situations.
Sherlock looked at John. “Is this- is this the honeymoon phase?” he asked, only slightly uncertain of the phrasing.
But Sherlock didn't have a way to verify the ideas presented in the text so his translation fervour waned and he ended up sitting back in the chair and staring at the pages with a frown. The information alone wasn't dangerous because very few people had the mental acuity and the resources to study them further. And, perhaps more importantly, the moral stance that permitted human experimentation. The danger was in societies like the Explorers who clearly sought out individuals with the abilities and capabilities required and then provided them with the resources (including the test subjects). And thus they ended with people like Dr Gibson and Miss Price, who were able to take the ideas and expand on them. Or try to. So obviously they would be interested in Sherlock. His growing public figure (unfortunately) and his part in the case against the late Miss Price would've brought him to their attention. If he hadn't already been noticed before.
“Educated guess,” Sherlock muttered. They were stood on a gravel yard between three large oblong-shaped sheds.
“Is there any way I can stop you from telling me?” Sherlock muttered, glaring at his phone. It might be time to change his number again. It'd take Mycroft at least an extra five minutes to ring him then.
“You still want this?” he asked, then snorted when Sherlock presented his arm, sleeve already rolled up, and a dreadful grin. “You mad bastard.”
“No, and it smells bad,” John squinted in the light, pushing away some of the things that had fallen down and were now bobbing alongside him in the water.
“Only a little psilocybin in the tea,” she replied. Calm, but holding back some force. “You've had worse, I'm sure.”
The room behind the door was opulent but not cluttered. An elderly woman sat in a wheelchair by a large window but facing the door. Her grey hair was in a loose braid and she had an alert expression. She wore a sharp white button-up with a tall collar with a pair of black slacks on her unmoving legs. She was also gaunt and her lower body was clearly withered. Her expression was the same as Arthur Gibson's had been that morning when Sherlock had met him. She smiled—but it was a studied expression.
“Knife,” he said after a while and held out his hand. When nothing happened he turned to look at John who was leaning heavily against the edge of the table, shivering. “John!” Sherlock snapped and grabbed John's arm. “Give me the knife,” he said, enunciating every syllable very sharply.
“You swear. Just not out loud every time. I can see it in your face.” Sherlock didn't bother repeating his stance on how John was only honest as far as it correlated with an inability to lie convincingly.
There was a brief confusion; John froze, Sherlock balanced himself with a hand on the desk. Then John huffed through his nose hard enough for Sherlock to feel it. He pulled back.
“Of a romance?” John heaved a deep breath and looked at Sherlock as though it came as news to him they were in a romance. “Yeah, it is,” John said then and as the surprise of the question diminished an expression of satisfaction slowly replaced it. “Yeah,” he repeated with more force and grasped Sherlock's elbow, squeezing it. “We're in the honeymoon phase. I hadn't thought of that.”
“Yes, John,” he said without turning his gaze from his phone until the text was finished and sent. Then he pulled out a jar of jam from his (back-up) coat's pocket. “Here. Gifts are customary.”
From the opinionated silence coming from John's direction Sherlock could tell that he disagreed with this plan, but he couldn't expect Sherlock to ignore something like this, an actual mystery with severed hands and dead men with strange conditions and tattoos.
John was so easy to manipulate. He was like plasticine in Sherlock's hands. His needs and wants were simple like his mind, so easily fulfilled, almost enviable. Sherlock stared at John until John felt the weight of his eyes and looked up, curious.
There were no messages or calls while he waited for the cab (although he didn't expect any, really, why didn't John contact him) so he had plenty of time to stew. The corpse was not really of interest to him at the moment. The victim had been identified, although cause of death hadn't. Sexual violence was always a suspect when a victim was found sans clothing, but determining that was the job of the medical examiner. The crate, on the other hand, might have some evidence left. Evidence of what, that was still under speculation.
Sherlock just snorted, having managed to get past the door and onto almost level floor beyond the cardboard box. On either side of him rose walls of... stuff. Just rubbish. Piles of newspapers, more boxes, dust rising off everything in his wake. It was barely wide enough for a person to walk and ahead he could see it got even narrower. He felt and heard John follow him in, gasping because he'd held his breath to get through the door.
Sherlock's only reply was to slam the door. He didn't answer Mrs Hudson's greeting (it was after 9pm on a weekday, she was on her soothers, she'd forget she even heard the door in about two minutes) and stormed right upstairs. “John!”
Sherlock downed his soup in hurried gulps, while John glowered and fussed and grunted and tidied up in his desultory way. Moving things from one place to another, stirring up dust which only settled somewhere else. John was, in fact, crap at tidying. Sherlock watched him. He always did. His adoration for John didn't diminish the need for observation, or the logical need for distance and objectivity. Sherlock needed to know everything, he needed information to function, and he needed to separate personal from important.
“He went to get the coffee,” Molly said. “He said you wouldn't mind if I did this instead. Since it's my autopsy.” The last was added in a defensive mumble, but at least it was added. There had been a time when she wouldn't have dared, or not wanted to go against Sherlock's wishes. He only shrugged. What did he care who got the coffee and who opened the stomach.
“Oh God.” John was clearly no longer amused and Sherlock took some pleasure in that, smirking at him briefly. John was like that, always held down by the weight of the world and the suffering in it, as though it was either his fault or because he should've been doing something about it but wasn't (he was sometimes exceedingly lazy).
Sherlock woke up at 4am again and counted he had woken up four times during the previous 24 hours. First in his bed, then on the floor of the shop, then in his bed again after his hospital visit, and now in his bed, blood throbbing in his tongue, making it ache with each throb. He was tired of waking up. He went back to sleep as best he could, and at 9am listened to John come downstairs, have a shower, make tea and leave. Sherlock would have dragged himself out of bed if John had stayed, just so he could suffer in front of John, which was far more entertaining than suffering on his own. And suffer he did.
Pain sprang at him from every corner of his body, forcing a grunt out of him that bubbled at his lips with blood and saliva. He tried to swallow and ended up coughing.
The sofa was getting somewhat uncomfortable under Sherlock and he shifted with a grunt, trying to find another position where his battered side would be more or less comfortable. He wasn't done recounting the story yet.
Sherlock shrugged. “Humans are fascinating creatures. Simple on their own, but a complex collective.”
Sherlock was only slightly miffed. He was clever enough to admit that it was perhaps a better idea for someone (smaller) with no injuries to be the first in, along with light and a firearm.
“Healthy pets put no one at risk,” John muttered, obviously having received Sherlock's psychic transmission of facts.
“And then you involved yourself in the matter with poor Edward,” she continued and picked up her cup of tea. The steam rose around her face in vortices. (How was her tea still that hot?)
The space behind wasn't big, but it was a room. The disc of light from John's torch was fixed on the far wall as he stood by the hatch. “Careful,” he muttered and helped Sherlock up. “It looks like she did research here. Or something. There's a cabinet in that corner and a door in the other.” He pointed the light at them, one after another.
“Don't use up your battery, we might need it later,” Sherlock instructed and started moving forward. It seemed whoever (possibly V. Ljuga) lived here was a compulsive hoarder. Impressive, really. The place was big (as annoyingly inaccurate as an adjective like 'big' could be).
“Not your best, that.” John padded about on his socked feet. Into the kitchen, freezer, out of the kitchen, across the sitting room, stopping by the sofa. “Sherlock,” he said by way of warning though Sherlock was perfectly aware of what he was about to do, which was to take the cold packs that were no longer cold, and replace them with fresh ones.
“I regret your decision to not assist me, Sherlock,” Mycroft sighed but picked himself up and moved towards the stairs. “And I regret your decision to keep to your course. I sincerely hope you don't come to regret these decisions as well. They will take what you know and turn it inside out.”
John rolled his eyes, but there was amusement. “Yeah, but when does he do anything he's told?” He glanced at Sherlock. “Bye, Mrs Hudson. Don't wait up.”
(Nevertheless, he still took a moment to look over the dead man and get a few pictures of him. Late 50s, early 60s. An academic. Or a highly educated professional most likely working in a sedentary academic setting. Death hadn't been a violent one if one didn't count the missing hand. His pockets were empty. He seemed to be reclining in the cardboard boxes, which was an irrelevant observation, but one that struck Sherlock anyway.)
Sherlock looked at him and nodded, then made a grand gesture towards the door. “Yeah. Go. Observe the chain of custody on the remains.” The words made John roll his eyes. Neither of them was in any way able to uphold the chain of custody of anything. The difference was that John (and the legal system) cared about it while Sherlock didn't.
“It'd be like resenting a hurricane,” John muttered, eyes shut. “This is the end of this case, promise?”
“My brother is a fat cake-thief,” Sherlock muttered. John looked like he thought he had the upper hand, like he'd managed to distract Sherlock from the man who could eat everything. He hadn't. Sherlock had a very expansive mind capable of holding several facts, trails of thought and centres of attention at the same time. “You don't believe in ghosts which is why you're amused.”
“Don't get me wrong, you're still a bag of dicks,” John hurried to add. “But you're also… something amazing.” John had used these words before. They came up whenever he attempted to describe Sherlock in some manner and to be honest it pleased Sherlock to no end that John still didn't have other words to do so. It meant the amazing part hadn't changed even if it was often appended by some version of the word ‘dick.
The water tasted tepid. Had been there a while. Sherlock drank it all anyway, then pulled his knees up and realised he was under the covers, wearing his pyjamas. He wrapped his arms around his knees and clutched at his own elbows. He curled his toes into the mattress and relaxed them again.
Sherlock made no comment to that. All people deviated from the mental and physical norms in some way (a norm being shorthand for something that didn't actually exist until masses were condensed), but in his experience it rarely led to auto-asphyxiation like this. If it was indeed auto-asphyxiation. He was inclined to think no. Not with bruises like that on the corpse's neck. Bruises were signs of internal bleeding, usually caused by blunt force trauma from the outside. And sometimes they were just signs of internal bleeding without said trauma.
He wasn't sure if there was another crack of thunder or if it was the sound of the door slamming open. The corridor beyond was far brighter than the room and light spilled in like a non-Newtonian liquid, sluggish and LED-white. She turned in his body and the light touched her (his- HIS) face and etched his borrowed features in great relief between the light from the corridor and the dark of the storm in the room.
Sherlock was in agony. And his tongue hurt, too. And his ankle and his arm and his ribs. Boredom was the enemy. It made him realise his brain was trapped in a skull that was attached to a body that was only human. He glanced at the skull on the mantel, envying him.
They had stopped now. John had his collar turned up and his hands in his pockets. The tip of his nose was red and his hair was uncombed. His face was tired, but his eyes were bright. A fact Sherlock attributed to the street light, because people's eyes didn't brighten or dim on their own, no matter what centuries' worth of romantic novels said. People just saw reflections of their own emotions in other people's eyes, which was why it was best to stay emotionless. (There'd been no horror in the eyes of the Tuol Sleng prisoners who'd been photographed before torture and death under the Khmer Rouge regime.)
Sherlock stopped briefly, having buttoned up a fresh shirt. “This…” He gestured at the bed, encompassing (hopefully) the whole spectrum of activities they might have undertaken along with sleep. “Good. But later.” It was as much of a concession as he knew to make about the importance of extracurriculars like that.
She clucked her tongue at the state of their kitchen (so there'd been experiments, which John refused to clean up) as she went back downstairs. Her soft steps were replaced by the sharper thud of high heels on the carpeted stairs as the client more or less charged upstairs, sobbing monstrously. Her face had run past her cheeks and down her chin in streaks of black and orange. Oh. No. Just in in black, her
Lestrade had hurried up, but was now covering his nose and mouth with his arm. “Don't go in. I'm getting a team here.”
“Are you all right?” A worried middle-aged woman asked, peering up at him (overweight, wearing pressed trousers but with blousing on the knees meaning she sat a lot). “You looked like you were having a seizure.”
“The case. The case is cold!” Sherlock expulsed the words with more force. “I can't make sense of it!”
The lift came to a halt and the doors opened with another muted ding. John pointed the gun out, scanning the floor. It was empty of furniture, but walls and doors were still in. There was only limited sight from the lift so John moved out quietly, checking corners. Sherlock used one of his crutches to stop the lift doors from closing, waiting for John's okay.
The pictures told the story of two girls going out to a club backwards. Sherlock slid through the pictures without pausing. The first picture was of a group of young men and the two girls posing in a ... selfie, and the last one was of the two girls (dressed and made up almost ritualistically similarly, normative pressure at work there) posing seemingly just before they left for the previous evening. None of it explained anything.
“I'll get it,” John said, clearly disturbed. He moved to grab Sherlock's mobile and his expression upon reading the text made Sherlock sit up.
John nodded and walked him to the door, then came back, a little unhappy. “Why did you have to do that? Again.”
“Both of the victims died due to madness,” Sherlock explained, hiding the uncomfortable soreness radiating up from his foot and sideways from his ribs and into his jaw from the swollen eye. He handed the cane to John and withdrew his roll of lock picks from his pocket. “Caused by the wall-paper.”
Buoyed by these thoughts, or perhaps troubled by them, he swung his legs out of bed and the cast landed with a clank, jarring his already tortured foot. The swelling of his face was down, and he was able to see again out of both of his eyes, but his ribs felt re-bruised and his arm was sore up and down and around the barb-marks. He reached the crutches into his grasp and hobbled up on them and out of his room. He visited the loo and after washing his hands and face he went to the kitchen.
“Yeah, and those are the pleasant symptoms,” John agreed, moving close again and grasping Sherlock's coat again, much to Sherlock's surprise, but then he took another look at John's face in the unflattering light of his mobile. The relief was so utter and absolute.
Sherlock gave him a scathing look. He'd perfected it on idiots, but sadly it tended to just bounce off John.
“I need to see the place immediately.” Sherlock used the cane to force the door open, making the old woman step back.
“Mm,” she agreed. “My great-grandfather was an eccentric. He built the room to house demons. Complete nonsense, of course. The real power, if you want to call it that, is in the mind. My mind.” Her eyes were fixed on Sherlock's face. “You understand, I think. You also have an extraordinary mind.”
It? Sherlock slipped his mobile into his pocket and slid off the bed where John made himself immediately comfortable, taking up as much space as possible to stop Sherlock from getting back in. Sherlock looked under the bed where John's filthy clothes were in one bag (he ignored that, he didn't do laundry) and his items in another. He pulled the item bag out and looked in, finding a piece of stiff parchment along with the aforementioned keys and wallet (and useless phone).
“So's breaking and entering.” John pushed his plate to the side and folded his arms on the table, looking at Sherlock. “Greg won't be here for a while and if I've understood you correctly, you've practically solved the case already. Why not eat a little something? Have that sickening milk and sugar concoction you call coffee.”
Sherlock looked around and realised she was the driver of said cab. He strode to the car and opened the door to get in. “Barts,” he said and when the woman was still just standing there he added: “Now!”
Sherlock looked at John, seeing the hints of worry and incomprehension behind the blank look. He couldn't hide. It was reassuring. “Just tell me what happened,” he muttered.
“He's not going to leave his wife for you,” Sherlock said at once, brushing past her. “They never do.”
“Move,” Sherlock hissed back, giving into his desire to direct John. “Get up to the door and shoot it open.”
“Sorry.” John was smiling now and Sherlock realised he was no longer unwelcome there. John had re-aligned himself so that the desk was not biting into Sherlock any more; he was being carefully cradled into John's chest with a warm hand splayed flat against the small of his back.
John's face took on a look of slight disappointment instead of the tenderness that had been inhabiting it a moment before. For a split second Sherlock felt sorry for it as John pulled away and sat back in his chair.
He struggled on the floor. Struggled to get up, struggled to get to John. His eyes watered, making his view undulate with waves of light and colour. Then, with another crash of sound, his eyes cleared and he was staring at John from higher up, from his standard height. The shock of what had just happened made his knees buckle and he gasped in surprise.
Sherlock shrugged. “A young woman of no consequence.” He had crossed his fingers on his stomach, looking up at the ceiling with his good eye, the hurt leg elevated on throw pillows which were Mrs Hudson's. He could hear John sighing and rolling his eyes, objecting to Sherlock's lack of sympathy towards the recently deceased. He chose to ignore out of courtesy to John who had chosen not to lecture him about it.
Sherlock could follow John's trail of thought even without looking at him. He didn't want to answer, but he hoped Sherlock would go away faster if he did. He considered lying, but realised Sherlock would know immediately. So he gave up. There was a (familiar) sigh of defeat.
And because John was so wearied and worried Sherlock struggled to find the right words to tell him of his gratitude and appreciation. “You did the right thing,” he finally said, trying to fill his voice with sincerity.
Said companionship was looking at him, head tilted slightly, chin pushed forward, emoting something that Sherlock couldn't quite place. Perhaps belligerence? He wanted to ask and at the same time he didn't want to know because it'd just end up filling his brain with irrelevant noise.
The corrugated sheet metal walls belied the highly finished interior of the building. There was a thick door and thick walls. It looked a well-funded laboratory that split into two parts. A larger room with a strange cylindrical glass chamber in the middle, surrounded by machinery, and another smaller room with more machinery and monitors. A window separated the two rooms. The chamber was at least human size. Everything was spotless and brightly lit.
