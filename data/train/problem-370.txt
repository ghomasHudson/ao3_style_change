John sets his mouth into a thin, angry line as he stands, refusing to let that tone of voice have its usual effect on him.
"Tell me your heart isn't racing, that adrenaline isn't coursing through your body. Tell me you're not enjoying the feeling of my body pressed against yours," Sherlock murmurs, low in his right ear. "Tell me you don't like this..."
John lets out a soft groan, his face flushing in the darkness as his hand slowly pushes under the covers, down his chest and stomach.
myself. I had nightmares about your fall every single night. Every day when I woke up, you died again in my mind. I
on his face – the one which means he's just worked out a particularly tricky puzzle. The look he gets when he's been particularly clever.
They sat in silence for the whole day, watching terrible daytime television, Sherlock regularly going to get more water and ice chips when he deduced John's need, John intermittently napping. John barely looked at him the whole time. It was awful, torture really, but at least he wasn't being asked to leave. Sherlock stayed until visiting hours finished, having said not a word for the entire day.
John kept fucking him hard for a few more seconds then breathed out, barely audible, "Oh fucking hell, Sherlock, I'm close. I'm so close.
Sherlock allowed himself a smug smile as he unbuttoned John's jeans, looking up at him, John lifting his head to stare down.
than that. Writhing alone in hotel beds, touching myself in a way you would never, torturing myself with thoughts of you, of your body, of your love, of your lust."
His pyjama bottoms were tented obscenely and all Sherlock could do was stare. There was a large wet patch at the apex of the tent, the old, worn material going almost entirely see-through. Sherlock's mouth flooded with saliva as he looked.
"That is a matter for another day, as is the regulation of what is manifestly an addictive and dangerous product, which I can assure you will be addressed in parliament very soon. What will happen if we leave him in the system?"
A few hours before dawn, the hem of the sheet cuts a tight, white line across the sleeping doctor's chest and collarbone. John struggles a little as he wakes, confused by his confinement. His eyes take a moment to adjust to the bright light of his bedside lamp and he squints straight up at Sherlock's serious face.
"Tell me what to do, John," Sherlock said, sitting forward. "I don't know how to fix this. I will do anything you ask of me, just tell me what you want."
When John finally dares to open his eyes, he looks up and sees Sherlock staring down at him, head raised from the pillow, high cheekbones flushed, full lips parted and wet, pale eyes half-closed with pleasure but still fixed on him. The man looks like sex incarnate. Sherlock’s thighs are spread wide and he’s gently caressing his own chest with languid, graceful fingers. A moment later, those same languid, graceful fingers grip his right nipple and squeeze cruelly, Sherlock letting out a choked moan, his eyes still locked on John's.
The rest of the day passed in much the same way as the previous one, together in silence, but with Sherlock being practically giddy at five mere inches of gained ground.
Sherlock pulls away slightly, a teasing smile on his lips. "You're magnificent when you're angry, by the way..."
, Sherlock, I fucking love you," John breathed fiercely against Sherlock's open mouth, panting out the words, Sherlock breathing them in, absorbing them, making them a part of himself. "Don't you ever leave me again. Do you hear me? Never again."
"Oh," Sherlock says, uninterested, not at all bothered by the fact that he's lost several hours in his mind palace. "You don't deny it anymore. Not once since I've been back have you denied being gay."
"Yes!" Sherlock says, utterly unfazed by the cabbie's interest and John's desire for him to keep his voice down.
In short order Mara found herself being locked into handcuffs by the dashing Detective Inspector Lestrade and led out to a waiting panda. John and Sherlock exited the bank, John looking at her for a long moment, then turning away with a shake of his head.
John slipped his arms around Sherlock's chest and pressed his forehead against his spine, breathing heavily, smearing wet kisses on Sherlock's skin. His hands explored Sherlock's chest, tweaking his nipples, smearing through the evidence of Sherlock's earlier orgasm. Finally John's right arm encircled Sherlock's waist while his strong, callused left hand took hold of his cock.
"Interesting," Sherlock muses, grinding his hips down harder, causing delicious friction on John's hard cock. "Have you been fucked before, John?"
"Yes, my sexual preference is the male of the species, and my general predilection, when active, is toward the bottom. Is that a problem?"
Honestly, John can’t remember the last time someone put in this much effort toward picking him up, let alone a
He crosses the room, still frowning, still angry, but curious. His pillow has a few stray dark hairs on it. The sheet is creased most in the middle, where Sherlock must have been lying.
They get into a cab as true partners for the first time, thighs touching on the back seat, and drive off into the London night.
"I know I claimed not to have one," Sherlock said without looking at John, "but I think we both know that isn't true."
It’s really not that different to sex with a woman, but at the same time it's completely different and so much better. John never knew sex could be like this, so intense, so all-consuming, so utterly overwhelming. So fucking
"Yeah, I'm getting that," John murmurs, his forehead creasing into the worried frown Sherlock imagined, in the hospital rooms, continents away.
John fumbled blindly on the covers, his hand searching for the condoms, his eyes firmly fixed on Sherlock's rock-hard erection.
John knows he can't possibly hear his hard-on, or at least he thinks he knows, but he does know for sure that if he challenges him, the detective will hear it in his voice. So he says nothing.
Sherlock's eyes sweep quickly up and down John's body and John shifts uncomfortably under the scrutiny.
The next pub turns out to be a warm, traditional little tavern. It’s quiet, he's one of only three people in the place. He orders a pint of bitter and goes to nurse it on a leather sofa in front of an anachronistic-looking plasma screen TV, which is showing the United v Tottenham match.
Sherlock cleared out the drip machines and changed the bedsheets. He left the chapstick, charger, phone and glass where they were.
"I don't think I..." Sherlock shook his head. "I would never have thought the real you would want that. I thought my own wants had corrupted it somehow."
anyone to go anywhere near that area of his body. The couple of girlfriends who had tried with tentatively probing fingers, he’d gently rebuffed.
And then what? Make his move? Sneer? Both are equally likely. John doesn’t know which prospect frightens him more. Over the course of the afternoon he’s managed to work his way back to being firmly in denial and has every intention of staying there indefinitely. It’s just a phase. He’s confused. He’s lonely and too attached to the only friend he really has.
"But not you. With you, I wanted to solve every tiny puzzle, dig out every single little detail. I wanted every part of you. I wanted to get inside you and solve you from the inside out. Shake you apart and put you back together again, to know how you work.
"It's not as simple as that," John says, running a hand through his hair, trying not to think about just how much he enjoyed himself.. "I wish it was, but I have
"What? No! I mean... no," John stammers, completely caught off guard, Sherlock's breath making his neck break out in gooseflesh.
"Pupil dilation when looking in my direction: an extra ten percent, regardless of lighting conditions. When looking at me in my charcoal grey pinstriped trousers: twenty percent. You know the ones, they're a little too tight over my posterior and thighs, accentuating my gluteals and quadriceps."
"Is that how you like it?" Sherlock murmured, reaching for the bottle and squeezing more of the fluid onto his finger before pushing it back inside. "Is that how you like it when you use my toys?"
"I get that. I get your focus. I get that there wasn't any room for me, right at that moment. But that doesn't mean I like it, or that I can live like that."
One more choked-off moan (John’s pretty sure Sherlock just came) and John’s coming himself, not even caring as he shoots streams of white on Mrs Hudson’s wallpaper. He leans heavily against the wall, breathing harshly, his eyes squeezed closed as he strokes himself through his orgasm.
Sherlock breathed out slowly, thinking about the last time he and John were in a version of that room.
"I didn't turn it off, John," Sherlock breathes fervently, moving closer. "I didn't turn off anything. I pushed it to the back of my mind, so I could focus on something other than you. Do you honestly think you've been any less overwhelming than I?"
John frowns and mentions something which has been troubling him since this whole thing started. "I thought you were 'married to your work'."
Sherlock stayed still and quiet, resisting his instinct to thrust and thrust and bury himself deeper within the delicious heat clamping the end of his cock. He let out a helpless groan as John's body clenched with a shudder, squeezing his cock for only a moment before it was forced out.
"All right. Did you tell Sherlock you were in love with him?" Mara said, giving John a sympathetic expression. "When he was alive?"
Sherlock heard John flick off the kettle prior to boiling and get down the bottle of Talisker from the top shelf of the cupboard, with two glasses.
"Cold old night. Fancy a coffee, Mara Kint?" he said, finally withdrawing his warm hand from hers, his fingertips tickling her palm briefly.
The shallow drawer is empty, save for a clear plastic pouch containing the biggest, blackest, thickest dildo John’s ever seen. John’s eyes widen and he shuts the drawer quickly, his heart pounding in his chest. He freezes guiltily, his eyes closed, listening intently to the silent flat.
Sherlock looks at John for a brief instant, then quickly leans down and crushes his lips against John's. John's eyes widen in alarm and he doesn't respond. There is a long moment where neither of them dares move, but then Sherlock pulls back, an utterly horrified expression on his face.
"I can, and I will," John said, smiling slightly as he watched Sherlock walk away to hail a cab. "This is where I belong. With that mad bastard over there."
"No time for regret now," Sherlock said, breathing the words against John's ear, delighting in the shiver they caused. "Only action."
"We can move on to the sex now?" Sherlock said, sitting forward in his seat, his pale, unsettling eyes seeming somehow even more alien when filled with desire.
It's John's turn to be stunned. Sherlock's face is serious as he closes the gap between them, running two cold hands up the front of John's cable-knit jumper. John looks down at Sherlock's hands.
Sherlock’s fingers stop at the bottom hem of the pyjama top, gripping the soft, worn fabric and dragging it slowly upwards. John watches Sherlock’s face carefully, feeling his own burning red, his heart thudding violently in his chest. Sherlock’s eyes are locked on John’s slowly-revealed tummy and he’s unconsciously biting the inside of his bottom lip.
Light touches, bodily proximity, flattery, bedroom eyes, the guy’s really pulling out all the stops. John’s feeling very at ease as Gabe slides his arm along the back of the sofa, running his fingers through the short hairs above John’s ear.
"You like that, Sherlock?" John murmured against his mouth, twisting his grasp on Sherlock's sensitive skin.
He's such a nice guy, but she never feels like he's really there with her. He always seems like he's getting ready to run off, which is true, he admits. He's a great friend and she’s attracted to him, but she doesn't see a future with him. She wants marriage and children and she doesn't see John settling down. She sees his future involving running down darkened London streets at all hours, chasing criminals and following Sherlock. A life of danger and intrigue isn't what she wants.
"My undying gratitude," Sherlock said, immediately regretting his word choice. John didn't pick him up on it.
"You can't just act like nothing happened. That's not how this works," John says, his hands on his hips.
Sherlock-in-John's-mind is immediately completely naked, his trousers still pooled around his feet. He steps out of the forgotten trousers, languidly prowling toward his bed. John pictures Sherlock's naked arse. He's not sure how he feels about picturing anything else just at the moment, but the arse he has a head start on, from the crime scene and taxi ride. His imagination is surprisingly detailed, or maybe inspired is the correct word; a long, lithe, toned body with firm, pale arse cheeks which clench slightly as Sherlock walks.
“No, but you're still human,” John said, “as much as you like to pretend that you're not. Humans work in a pretty simple way. When we do something and the result is pleasant, we'll likely do it again. So I'll give you a reward for helping me make our home nice and pleasant during December, and you'll get something you'll like in return. In addition to all the niceness the experiment will create in and of itself. Therefore - you'll probably be more willing to do this again next Christmas. It's a win-win situation.”
Sherlock sighed and covered his eyes, as if the burden of technologically inept, social-media blind John Watson was just too much for one man to bear.
He doesn't question this instinct, doesn't examine it, refuses to think about it. And in a while he's asleep.
It’s something of an adjustment to find that these things are available to him again. After a whirlwind weekend of deducing, directing Mycroft’s troops, and a fair bit of actual running around, here he is.
"I don't believe you," says John. “You're very clever, but not that clever. You just used her as a tool to get to Magnusson. You would've been much more interested in her if you'd realised she was Moriarty's sister."
Mycroft, however, has a name to what had happened to John. Widower. He supplied him with a death certificate and everything. Even a false funeral somewhere far away, where Mary's colleagues could send cards. She didn't know anyone well enough that they'd attempt turning up, Mycroft assured John. There was no empty casket, no priest, no dug up earth. Not like the last funeral Mycroft organized (well, the last one John knew Mycroft organised. Who knew how many of those a man like Mycroft might require throughout the year?) Just an address that accepted the cards.
Oh, god, I'm always promising to finish this in the next chapter, and then I keep rambling on. Sorry! But yet again, I'll now promise that the smut (and the end) will be in next weekend's update.
For a moment everything was silent in the flat. The slipper was hanging limply from John's hand. Sherlock hadn't moved from his position at the wall, still standing with his legs a shoulder width apart.
But there are nine minutes until the lights will come back on and by then they need to be clean and tucked away. And besides – John seems to be roughly 90 seconds from coming, which gives Sherlock a limited window of time within to experiment.
But this time it was Sherlock moving them the rest of the way. His hands clutched John’s jumper and then their lips were finally touching.
If “perfectly pleased” means thrusting his hips towards Sherlock, moaning quietly into his mouth and rubbing his penis with admirable agility considering the awkward angle.
“You next.” John throws him a clean towel without looking at him. Then he sits down in his chair and turns on the TV.
The last woman he slept with was Mary. Finding a new girlfriend is a seriously big step (note to self: discuss with Ella).
Craig is quicker than MI6 when work like this has to be done and Sherlock is in a hurry. He needs to go lay a trap for one of the few people he’s ever called a friend.
He came while Sherlock was licking his third finger. He could taste blood as he came, because if he hadn’t bitten his lip he feared he would’ve screamed the house down.
“Sherlock? Um… are you okay?” John stood in the doorway, and looked at his flatmate, lying in a heap on the sofa, clutching a bottle they usually reserved for the end of a particularly good case. It certainly wasn’t a bottle you drank straight out of, which was what Sherlock appeared to have been doing.
(Sherlock seems to have taken his advice to heart and has given completely up on being considerate. Has, in fact, also given up on being civil, so John orders something Indian without consulting his new flat-mate.)
He sank back against Sherlock, mindful to put most of his weight on the side where his ribs were uninjured.
The problem was contained to mornings, at first. With his nostrils filled with Sherlock's smell, his skin touching Sherlock's sheets and often some part of him touching Sherlock himself.
"I mean," said John between gritted teeth, "that nowhere in the civilised world is it impossible to get a divorce."
He found his flatmate where he was busy writing case notes on John’s fresh stack of blank Christmas cards.
Which he, as a health care professional, knows to be a cause for serious concern. He really needs to book a new appointment with Ella. That’s what he’d tell anyone in the same position to do.
These feelings – obsessions – whatever – were getting completely out of hand. John figured he really needed some professional help in getting his head around his absurd matrimonial situation. So he ordered an appointment with Ella.
And yet John hadn’t been absolutely sure that the moment would ever arrive. Had almost begun to accept that they’d stay in this strange, in-between state for the rest of their days. Somewhere between friends and lovers. Lovers who didn’t kiss, friends that sat a bit too close to each other on the sofa. Flatmates who would die for each other.
John thinks about apologising for his inexperience, but then decides it doesn't matter. He can’t think of this as his first time with a man, it's his first time with
the nutcracker’s painted mouth has just twitched up into a smile. He blinks, sure he must be seeing things, and looks around, but no one is watching and when he looks back at the nutcracker, his face is just the same as it had been when he opened the box. He swallows hard, assures himself he’s seeing things, and tucks his nutcracker a little further under the tree just to be safe, then stands to let Mummy fuss over him and give him biscuits.
“Fuck, Sherlock, that’s it,” John says. “That’s it, you’re so close, come on.” His voice is rough and deep and breathy and intimately close, and Sherlock feels like he’s on fire, like his entire body is being pulled away from him, like he has no control over himself and he thinks that’s okay because it feels so
Sherlock nods, and his eyes are still trained on John’s face, memorizing him. “Until you fall asleep,” he says, and it’s barely a whisper, echoing in John’s ears as he lets the fuzziness of sleep take over his mind.
They’re set to meet Mary at 5:00 in the park. It’s a bit early, but she’d suggested the earlier time, saying they shouldn’t miss out on such a nice day. John had agreed, and he’d spent most of the afternoon preparing sandwiches and snacks for them.
lovely, he wants to know? Iris, of course, but Sherlock was in the picture, too, wasn’t he, and he wonders – his lips twist for a moment and he’s thinking about how to reply when a text comes again.
“Kneel just where you are,” Sherlock instructs as the last of the crystals fall from his fingers and the rainbow of light fades from his face, and then he shifts until he’s kneeling across from John, on the other side of the urn. He looks up at the sky again, brow furrowed and eyes narrowed, then looks back at John.
John’s fingers tug gently on his hair again, and Sherlock moans, wants so much more but can’t ask for it now, feels desperation washing over him.
He perseveres, though, trying to get past the unfamiliarity, trying to be patient with himself and familiarize himself with the violin again.
“Well?” John asks.  Their faces are close, and he finds that he can’t look away from Sherlock’s eyes.
“Oh – sounds lovely,” John says.  He knows he’s staring at the man-fox, but he can’t help it, he really can’t.
“Are you hungry?” Sherlock asks abruptly, at the very same time that John says, “I’m famished,” and they look at each other and they’re both suddenly overcome by slightly anxious laughter, looking away as it passes almost as quickly as it had bubbled up. Something lightens in the atmosphere, and Sherlock allows that thing he won’t call hope inside of him to grow just a tiny bit.
Iris finishes her bottle and Sherlock sets it aside, shifting her so he can burp her. He settles her against his cloth-laden shoulder and gently pats her back, the whole of which is easily eclipsed by his hand. The flat feels quiet and empty without John, but it’s different than it was before, when John had been married. It feels light now with the promise of John’s return, and Sherlock turns his head to the side, pressing a soft kiss to Iris’ head, something he likes to do when he knows John can’t see.
“That was intense, hmm?” John asks.  He’s grinning, and his eyes are bright and he looks rather proud of himself. Sherlock adores him –
Sherlock quirks a small, pleased smile, but he doesn’t look at John. As John sits down at the table, though, he can’t stop looking at Sherlock.
“I’ve never… no one’s ever come in here before,” Sherlock says, voice rough, though he knows John knows that.
“I brought Chinese,” John calls. “You’re eating it.” He peeks into the living room and sees Sherlock wave a lazy hand through the air in what John assumes is acquiescence, not moving from the couch.
Arthur laughs. It’s loud and contagious, and John finds himself grinning. “Surprising as it may be, tomorrow is completely free,” Arthur says. “Do you pass through the park on your way home? We could meet here again, right on this bench.”
John gives a rueful laugh, his hunched shoulders shaking a bit. “Now it’s different,” he says. “I share a flat with a bloody lunatic, but I wouldn’t trade him for the world.”
“I’ve been here before,” he blurts, though he’d meant to yell at Sherlock and ask him why he didn’t think to mention he’d end up underwater.
Sherlock smiles, feeling flushed and drowsy, but warm and safe. John continues to stroke his hair, continues to rub his back. Sherlock shivers at the sensation.
John frowns, feeling a bit foolish with the useless gift bag in his hands.  “I guess I should’ve called first,” he says.
Sherlock steps back and his hands fall to his side again, but then, after just a moment of hesitation, he takes John’s hand and pulls him over to the little ledge where John always sat with Greg. He sits, and John sits beside him.
Before they’ve even gotten halfway up the path, the door opens and a young woman comes out. She smiles when she sees Sherlock, tucking her mousey brown hair behind her ear bashfully.
The fortuneteller laughs, but she still seems slightly disconcerted by Sherlock. “Anyway, shall we get started?” she says, and John can’t help but admire her tenacity.
Sherlock forces his eyes to relax, forces his hands to continue the Debussy, even though his heart is pounding. He’s not emotionally prepared to see John in his current maudlin state, especially because as he falls into the familiar comfort of deductions, he knows that something has
John turns toward Sherlock and his jaw drops. “Sherlock, you can’t be serious. You can’t just bring a bloody talking
To his delight, John smiles back. Sherlock has known what it’s like to fall for a long time, he thinks, but now he knows what it’s like to grow wings.
“John,” Sherlock says after a long moment which, to him, could have been either seconds or hours. “You –
He stops, frustrated and unsure, rain dripping down his nose, his ears, his eyelashes, making his coat heavy against his body. He doesn’t know what to do. He’s not
John shakes his head. “I’m not leaving here without you,” John says. His voice is a low growl from between clenched teeth.
“You don’t sound very good,” Arthur says. “You should call up your girl, have her come take care of you.” He grins and wiggles his eyebrows, and John laughs.
Sherlock turns and looks at him curiously, his head tilted and his brow furrowed. “Oh,” he says, after a moment, clearly having understood the source of John’s mood. “Would you like tea?”
Sherlock is aware of too many things, and his head is spinning. He swallows hard. He shakes his head, unsure.
John hesitates only a fraction of a second, memorizing the sight of Sherlock and the feel of him under his hands, before grabbing Billy and running for the park gates.  He has no time to waste.
“It’s part of your payment, John,” Sherlock reminds him. “And Billy, John surely won’t drop you, considering your light weight and the sentimental nature of how he views you. John
Sherlock frowns. He doesn’t understand why everyone is unhappy with his confetti. Sometimes he doesn’t understand a lot of things. He feels like he lives in a different world than everyone else. He shakes his head, uncertain.
“Oh don’t be a crybaby,” Mycroft says as Uncle Augustus takes the broken nutcracker from Sherlock. “If you hadn’t been taunting me, I wouldn't have –”
“Mm,” Sherlock says. “It was payment from a client. It’s made from a nectar you won’t find anywhere in this world.” He sets it down next to him and lights his pipe, inhaling softly, then letting the smoke drift lazily from between his lips.
Sherlock’s overly aware of the sound of his footsteps as he walks towards the hallway, of the sound of John behind him, of John’s breath, of what’s about to happen, but he pushes the anxiety that is trying to rise inside of him down and stops in front of a familiar, blank stretch of wall in the hallway. He closes his eyes and takes a deep, shaky, determined breath before moving his hand in a complicated pattern, visualizing the magic in his mind and manipulating it with his hand. The door appears, which he carefully reaches out and opens, only hesitating for a moment. He takes another deep breath and steps inside, gesturing for John to enter.
John smiles. “That’s a shame, because it really is beautiful,” he says. “But that only makes me happier you’ve let me see it.”
But of course, John stands and approaches. His jaw is set and he has the gait of a soldier, and Sherlock does his best to keep his own posture firm, to not give in to the twisting of his insides, but it’s getting hard.
“Sherlock?” John asks. His heart is pounding and fear is clawing at him, making him break out in a cold sweat. “Sherlock, what – is this a dream?”
He’s terrified, he realizes, and he has no idea how he will get Sherlock back. But deep in his soul, he can feel a strength and determination that he’s never felt before. He knows he’s about to enter a world he knows little to nothing about, but somehow, he trusts that he’s as ready as he can possibly be, and he finds that the benefits of what he’s about to undertake far outweigh the risks.
“I love you,” John says before he can stop himself. “God, I love you.” The words are surprisingly easy to say standing so close to Sherlock, his thumb pressed against Sherlock’s lips, feeling Sherlock’s body tremble with repressed emotion. “You’re a bloody idiot sometimes, but I love you.”
“Oh yeah?” John says, angry. “Well, how about this, then? You’re the bloody wish granter, aren’t you? I have a wish for you, Sherlock. I wish that once I get you away from this fucking crazy bastard, you come back to me, and we will be together until we are grey and old and you bloody die of natural causes, not this fucking wish, do you hear me? So, grant my bloody wish, you cock!”
Mary shakes her head. “It’s no problem,” she says.  She reaches up and unties a bow at the nape of her neck, one John can’t see from here, and then pulls out two ribbons, one pale blue and one white.  They are twisted together, and Sherlock takes them with a smile.
“That which is sought, they who are sought, the place we are seeking…That which searches, those who search, the place we must search…Guide us, that which flies, to the one we seek,” Sherlock murmurs, chanting what John knows must be some kind of spell. Sherlock’s eyes are focused on the handkerchief, and there’s an air of power around him similar to when he’d helped John after his spirit attack. John can’t help but stare at his face as he chants, but he looks away when Sherlock finishes and stands gracefully, his free hand still drawing patterns in the air above the handkerchief.
And then he glared again, every morning after that, when Sherlock gleefully pointed out the coal someone had taken great pleasure in placing inside John’s stocking.
"Well, clearly my client's twin was sleeping with the leader, which led to her murder. It wasn't a case of mistaken identity at all."
He doesn't know where. Maybe he's back on some insane adventure that John has no part of, like before. Maybe he’s turned back to drugs. Maybe he's being held in some deep, dark dungeon that the likes of Mycroft keep in the cellars of government for people who kill media moguls. John doesn't know.
Did Sherlock notice John's proximity and feel really, really uncomfortable? Or was it, perhaps, the other way around? Was Sherlock disgusted and disturbed or was he...
"Did he have a close circle? Granted, I didn't know him very well, but he didn't seem like a trusting type. I'm basing this on our quality time spent with several pounds of semtex between us."
This is the longest conversation they've had since Sherlock came back. Maybe it's the darkness, maybe John's unusually mellow because of the meltdown - he isn't sure.
But there’s John’s hand again. On his thigh, moving up. And this time it doesn’t stop and Sherlock whimpers, probably loudly, when John slides his fingertips firmly up Sherlock’s length.
Sherlock teases the rim of his hole, licking, sucking, kissing, blowing and John cannot think at all, cannot remember how all of this happened, all he knows is that this is the best thing he's ever felt.
His skin is white and smooth, reminding John of the years he spent as a drug addict, but underneath are the muscles Sherlock has built up practising various self-defence methods, chasing criminals around London.
And yet...John stared at the hand. Feeling like a failure both for wanting to take it, and for not taking it.
But saw the signs in John Watson. The guilty eyes, the nervous fondling of his phone, his over compensating with his family and then the avoidance of eye-contact when the reminders of his betrayal pop up in his mind again.
It doesn’t feel like paper when it hits. It feels heavy, like Sherlock’s hands themselves have slapped him. He reels back a bit from the sensation, but doesn’t take his eyes from Sherlock. Their eyes are locked, and Sherlock takes a deep breath, holds it, and then claps once. The sound is louder than John expects, and just as he hears it, the paper on his head disappears. His skin begins to feel a normal temperature again, and the goose pimples die down. The pain in his head is clearing, and he slumps forward in exhaustion.
Sherlock swallows, pressing himself closer to John even though there’s scant any space between them. “Perfect,” he murmurs.
“I can’t grant your wish until Moriarty is gone,” Sherlock says. His hand is warm around John’s. “I can’t kill him, but you can.”
The spirits are watching them and John’s not sure what to do, and Sherlock’s not giving him any cues. He gets control of himself enough to clear his throat and say, “Er, thank you very –” before suddenly Sherlock takes a large step forward, forcing John to take a step to keep up. When his foot lands, though, it falls on their living room floor in Baker Street, far from the strange place they’d just visited.
Sherlock shrugs and inhales his long pipe again. He holds the smoke in his mouth a moment, then tilts his head back to blow it slowly into the darkness. “Making lots of good friends, like Angelo’s son,” he says, though it doesn’t completely explain his comment.
Sherlock sits on the couch and feels as if his entire being has shifted. He doesn’t know how to process what he’s feeling right now, doesn’t know how to believe that this is real, and he thinks back over the last few moments, trying to sort them into his mind palace. He thinks he’ll need to do some reorganizing, some expanding on John’s wing to fit this.
“I hope you make good use of it,” John says with a smile.  He chats with Angelo for a little while, the boy shyly making his way over and sitting on the stool beside John.  John spares him a smile, but the boy blushes and turns away, ducking his head to hide a smile of his own.  John finds him quite endearing, and he shares an amused grin with Angelo.
Sherlock pushes John until he’s sitting back against the couch, then undoes the buttons of his shirt. “I’ll need to see your neck,” he murmurs.
The music is sweet in the quiet of the flat, mingling with the sound of the soft rain falling outside, and it allows his mind to wander, to think, to obsess, just as it always does. He’s allowed himself to indulge in the rarity of maudlin, the mood having struck him quite unprepared, but he finds that embracing the sweet melancholy once in a while is quite pleasing, especially when his mind won’t stop turning and turning and
Sherlock is breathing heavily, and the magic clinging to John’s robes is irritating him. With a wave of his hand, he rids John’s clothes of the stale traces of magic that’s all over them, causing them to settle and re-settle on John’s frame.
Remembering the breathy way Sherlock spoke on the phone. Remembering his whispers and moans. Remembering the way his proper, posh voice said '
John had physiotherapy again that day and Sherlock wordlessly followed along. He watched in awe as John worked through what was obviously a great deal of pain and muscle weakness, the look on his face doggedly determined. He was reminded yet again just how remarkable the man he'd chosen to love actually was.
“Do you want me to go get her number for you?” he asks.  He is irrationally angry for reasons he can’t fathom.
Mummy gets distracted by the decorator, who is explaining the catastrophic disaster of the fairy lights that won’t light, and tells Sherlock to go straight to the foyer to greet the guests. Naturally, Sherlock goes to the side door of the ballroom instead. He stealthily pushes it open a crack and peers in, wrinkling his nose when he sees that Great Uncle Alfred has already arrived and is wearing the same suit he wears every year, the one that always smells like moth balls. He’s talking to Daddy, and Sherlock knows from the way Daddy’s eyes shift to the side now and again and his fingers twitch that he’s trying to find an excuse to get away. Sherlock giggles, then quickly shushes himself and observes the other guests instead.
John smiles and pulls Sherlock down for a kiss again, soft, open-mouthed, sweet. When he pulls away, Sherlock chases his lips with his own and presses one last chaste kiss on the corner of John’s mouth. He keeps his head there a moment, eyes closed, lips tantalizingly close to John’s. “I love you,” he breathes. His voice is barely a whisper and he’s not looking at John, but John hears it deep inside of him. He swallows, his heart beating fast.
Sherlock shrugs, looking at the ring for a moment, and then flicking his wrist. It crumbles into ashes that disappear with a sweep of his hand. John boggles at the sight for a moment, and then shakes his head.
John kisses him again, and they kiss through the sour taste of morning until it’s no longer there, their bodies warm and flush together, their hips moving together to find the best friction and most pleasure.  Sherlock can’t get enough of this, can’t get enough of John, can’t believe he can have this in his life.  Their bedroom is quiet, save for the sound of the rustling bed sheets, of their breaths, of their lips.
Sherlock blinks, unused to someone actually caring about his life. “I enjoyed reading, and doing experiments. I used to play a lot with magic, too, before my parents told me it was strange.”
“To what?” John asks defiantly. He’s trying to ignore the way the air seems to shift around them as Sherlock’s finger rests against his jaw, but he finds it difficult.
Another text from John, who is clearly having a hard time being separated from her for the first time. Sherlock huffs a quiet laugh and takes a picture in response. It’s mostly of Iris tucked into his shoulder, but a bit of his face is in the frame, too, and there’s a small smile on his face that makes him flush when he looks at it. He hesitates, thinks maybe it’s too obvious, but he remembers the way John squeezed his shoulder and the way John looked at Iris before he left and he sends it, and then sends an accompanying message.
As he follows John up the steps, Sherlock does his best to keep his heartbeat under control, does his best not to immediately tell John that this doesn’t have to be temporary, that this can be forever (
“Hmm,” Sherlock says, but he’s filled with approval for John, for his roommate, for what he hopes might even be his friend. “I was just… making sure no one would eavesdrop.”
“She’s fine,” he says, wary of the topic of Mary considering the way Sherlock seems to dislike her. “She went to Brighton for her birthday.”
“Stay sitting up,” Sherlock says, voice firm and yet concerned. Mrs. Hudson takes Billy from the mantle and sits in the armchair, close by and ready to help.
On Saturday morning, Sherlock emerges from his room with a yawn, scratching his stomach through his thin t-shirt and shuffling into the kitchen. He freezes when he sees John sitting at the table with the paper; somehow, he’d forgotten John would be there, and he feels exposed in his t-shirt and thin pyjama bottoms.
John clears his throat and shakes his paper out to read again, clearly unwilling to talk more on the subject, and Sherlock opens up the scroll he’d been looking at last, but there’s a warmth spreading between them, despite John’s prickliness at discussing himself, that drives Sherlock to distraction.
They’re silent for a moment, and then Sherlock’s hands tighten on John’s waist. John glances up at him, and Sherlock smiles. “Welcome home, John.”
“I’m not jealous,” he says.  “But it bloody figures that I don’t get to see Mary, Sherlock eats her birthday present, and then this beautiful woman comes out of nowhere and Sherlock gets her, too.”
John sighs. “Honestly, you’re bloody mad,” he says, but he has to admit Sherlock looks good. Possibly better than he does himself, which is really not on.
“Sherlock,” Moriarty interrupts, and then stares at John with a raised eyebrow while he addresses Sherlock. “Tell your little
Sherlock lowers his head until his forehead is resting against John’s. It’s intimate, startlingly so, even after they’ve just kissed. Sherlock’s hand drifts beneath John’s vest, his palm warm against the bare skin of John’s back, and he brings the other up to cup John’s head. “You’ll never lose me,” he promises, his voice hushed, his words drifting over John’s lips like a kiss. “We were born for each other, quite literally. It’s fact, John.”
“It’s fine. Whatever you’ve got, I’m sure I’ve been exposed to it, too, working here. How are things with Sherlock?” Mary asks, opening her lunch bag.
John just stares for a moment, then closes his eyes, resigned to never knowing what Sherlock is talking about. “Right,” he says.   “Anyway, I don’t think I need to see a fortuneteller.”
John’s in a good mood, and despite the initial awkwardness of the situation, he can’t help but be impressed. “Wow,” John says. “That’s – you must have a lot of stories.”
Sherlock glares at him again, but he turns to John, ignoring Moriarty. “John, do you remember, when we went to see Molly, I told you that it’s taboo to divine your own future?”
, let alone what’s happened to Billy and Mrs. Hudson. Fear is crawling over him like a thousand little insects and it barely even registers when Mycroft puts a hand on his tense shoulder, leading him up the stairs.
John looks up at him with a smile when he finishes, and hands Sherlock a glass, holding it out delicately by the stem. Sherlock takes it, watching as John picks up his.
John looks at him, and Sherlock thinks he must be making one of those facial expressions he’d been trying to hide all night because John’s eyes flicker over his face and then he reaches out, takes hold of Sherlock’s wrist again. His fingers are gentle this time. He lets his thumb smooth over the skin on the inside of Sherlock’s wrist, and Sherlock shivers, closes his eyes. “John,” he says. His voice is little more than a whisper. He’s not sure what’s happening, and his heart is pounding, but he won’t read into this, won’t let himself believe this is real.
They’re approaching a large building, a sign outside that says ‘Psychic,’ when Sherlock stops. He tilts his head, narrows his eyes, and stares at the building.
souls. I’m not going to kill you. The price for that is far too high; not at all worth paying if you understand what it is. Taking a life unnecessarily is far too heavy. I simply mean something precious to the person whose wish I have granted. The soul of the wish, if you will. Now, shall we grant your wish, John?”
“I have,” John says, though there’s no edge to his words. “I don’t tend to listen to rumors, particularly rubbish ones. Did you go to Beauxbatons? Durmstrang? I mean, you’re clearly not a Squib if you’ve been ordering potions ingredients…”
“I’m so terribly pleased to see you!” the man gushes. “I just knew Sherlock’s little pet would come.”
When he is finished, he carefully moves John’s Union Jack pillow until it’s right in the center of his chair and lets his fingers linger on the familiar threading for just a moment. He swallows hard and lets his fingers drop, then looks around the room in hesitant satisfaction, and that’s when his eyes settle upon his violin case, sitting beside the couch and covered in a thin film of dust.
Sherlock shakes his head and swallows. His hand hovers on the couch near John’s, and John itches to cross the distance between them, but he doesn’t. “There’s no need to thank me,” Sherlock says. “It never occurred to me that what I’m about to say could ever be a possibility, but I now believe that you would have done the same for me if our circumstances were reversed,” he adds after a moment, his words a fast, nervous rush. He’s still not looking at John.
Sherlock squeezes John’s shoulder, then takes a step back. John regards him silently and turns, his heart pounding, the events of the day catching up to him. It’s too much, and he’s not sure he can be around this strange man anymore. He reaches for the door, the knob cold under his hands.
John follows, swimming as fast as he can, grateful that he can see the surface of the water and eager to get there before he runs out of air. He wonders how he has ended up here, and he’s grateful for the feeling of Sherlock’s fingers clamped around his wrist. The water is pleasantly warm; almost soothing, and he’s filled suddenly with the urge to laugh. When he looks around him, he can see that he’s surrounded by little flecks of crystal, gleaming where they float under the water. They look the same as the ones Sherlock had sifted carefully into the urn, and for as beautiful as they had been in the moonlight on the roof, they are stunning underwater. He shifts the hand in Sherlock’s grip until his fingers grasp Sherlock’s wrist in return, squeezing a little bit as they head towards the surface. Sherlock glances back at him, still grinning, and gives his arm a tug, and then John surfaces, gasping for air.
Sherlock smiles at him. It’s gentle, so gentle, and John feels his heart speed up. “John,” he says. “When I wished for you to live, I was thirty-two years old, and I’ve stayed thirty-two in every way that matters since then.”
John kisses the top of his head, and his fingers gently massage Sherlock’s scalp.  Sherlock is still clinging to him, but he relaxes a fraction.  “I know,” John murmurs.  “I know, Sherlock.  I love you, too.  Always.”
After she says that, she can’t hold it in anymore, and her frail shoulders shake with sobs.  She’s wearing a thin sundress, light blue like her eyes, and John feels something twist in his chest, sympathy for her plight.  He bites his lip and opens his arms, and she doesn’t hesitate to burrow into him, wrapping her little arms around his back and burying her face in his neck.  She’s small and fragile against him, and he feels the need to protect her, to help her, to keep her safe.
“You were crying,” he says bluntly. He feels disconnected from his thoughts after playing so long, and he can’t manage anything subtler than this.
John shakes his head, horror flooding him as thick, dark smoke spreads over Sherlock’s arms, obscuring them from view. “Sherlock,
. He presses the palms of his hands into his eyes and tucks his knees up, resting his forehead against them, and tries to breathe against the oppressive bleakness covering his mind, against the way his insides feel as if they’re trying to claw their way out of his body.
“Have you done this before?” John asks. His voice is soft, barely a whisper. Sherlock shakes his head, doesn’t open his eyes, and John kisses him again, soft and sweet, and then climbs off him and stands, leaving Sherlock blinking at empty air and then swiveling his head towards John, looking at him and feeling unexpectedly vulnerable.
John leans down and kisses him on the temple, and when Sherlock turns his head to look up at him, John kisses his eyebrow and his cheekbone, the corner of his mouth, and finally his lips, gently.
He closes his eyes and remembers the feeling of John’s thumb soothing against the vulnerable skin of the underside of his wrist for the very first time, remembers the fear he felt when they stood together in the living room, remembers the first touch of John’s lips against his. Lost in the sensory memory, he thinks of nothing but John as he begins to play the second movement.
John just stares for a moment, looking away and breathing through his nose before swinging his head back around to stare at Sherlock. “And you didn’t think to get us out a little sooner?”
Sherlock finishes his dinner before John. He feels relaxed, full from the pasta and wine, pleasantly sore from playing all day. He stretches his arms over his head to ease some of the stiffness, and then rotates his shoulders and shifts his neck, then reaches for his wine, mostly neglected during dinner. He takes a sip, lets it sit on his tongue for a moment, and savors the quality as it slides down his throat.
The spirits haven’t even touched him yet, and he’s already bleeding and terrified. He’s angry with himself for failing so quickly; he’s sure the spirits are about to do him in, and he’s overwhelmed with cold, thick fear, tendrils of air that feel like fingers pressing against his skin – when suddenly Redbeard steps hard on his foot, growling up at him.
But before they’ve even made it a quarter of the way towards the tree, they’re surrounded, and John’s breath is coming in fast gaps. There are spirits flying overhead and spirits on all sides. John presses closer to Sherlock until they’re back-to-back, surround by a circle of spirits. Sherlock’s back is strong against his, and their clasped hands are caught between their bodies. His shoulder’s at an awkward angle, and he knows Sherlock’s must be, too, but he won’t let go, not now.
John shifts forward and brings their hips into alignment. Sherlock’s head tips back and he moans, and John puts one hand behind Sherlock’s head to take his weight, and with the other, he pulls on Sherlock’s supporting arm, urging him flat down on the bed. Sherlock acquiesces, and John kisses him, pressing him into the mattress.
“That’s a no, then,” John muses. “How’s takeaway? Will you eat Indian? We can order from Bombay. You love their garlic naan.”
“Yes,” Sherlock says. “I’ve been waiting for you for a very long time. It was a bit lonely, to be honest, so I created Mrs. Hudson and Billy.”
John leaves Sherlock completely alone with Iris for the first time a week later. John’s just going to pick up some groceries, but he seems to think he’ll be gone for at least one year if the frantic instructions he leaves for Sherlock are anything to go by.
to be John’s best man, Sherlock composing songs for him, Sherlock smiling at him after his wedding in such a strange way and then disappearing from the crowd, Sherlock
Sherlock’s head is thrown back in ecstasy, resting atop the back of his chair.  His legs are spread wide and his hands are clutching the armrests and he’s trying with all his might not to move his hips, but it’s nearly impossible when the entirety of his considerable mental focus is on the white-hot pleasure of John’s mouth on his cock.  He has never felt this before, and so he has never understood why people murder over lovers gone wrong, never understood why people make such irrational decisions because of sex, but suddenly, with the lush velvet feel of John’s tongue splayed flat against the underside of his cock, with the feel of John’s mouth stretched around him, he
“’Course not,” John says. “But, you know, it’s been this way a long time,” he adds. “It’s a bit – I’ve grown used to it. It’s a bit strange to think of being without it.”
“John!” he hears. It’s a frantic, deep voice and he sees someone up ahead, holding out a hand. The man has silver hair and kind eyes that are narrowed in worry, and John instantly recognizes him: Greg.
John thinks of the train ride and grimaces; Sherlock had loudly and unapologetically deduced nearly all of the passengers around them, much to John’s embarrassment and the passengers’ collective dismay.
. I don’t want to suffer like this. It’s just – this one, it’s the spirit of a man who died in the war. You can’t even begin to imagine how hard it is, looking at his bloody ghost following me around all day,” she says. John frowns and then swivels around in alarm when the spirit behind him begins to move. It approaches the girl and stands right in front of her, looking her in the eye, but she doesn’t notice; she just stares right through it at her friends
It’s not unlike the many mistakes he’s made recently, he thinks, first with Mary – missing so many important details about her, assuming she wouldn’t shoot him, assuming she’d purposefully spared his life – then with Magnussen.  Magnussen had been a myriad of mistakes, from his glasses, to his vaults, and even to Sherlock’s underestimation of exactly how much Magnussen knew about his pressure points. He thinks he knows why his mind has stopped working like he wants it to –
“Because it’s true,” John says. His voice is soft, hushed, and he smiles before letting the bird fly away. Sherlock sneaks a look at him and feels his lips curl into a smile.
“We have somewhere to go,” Sherlock says, ignoring John’s question as usual. “But we can’t leave until it’s dark.”
“No,” Sherlock says. John’s hands shift around to the front of Sherlock’s trousers and settle over his belt buckle. He looks up at Sherlock, and he smiles.
Mycroft shakes his head.  “That’s a different situation, John.  One of Sherlock’s titles is the Dimensional Mage.  He has a unique ability to create portals between dimensions.  It’s unrelated to the business of wish granting, or to other incidental small pieces of magic.”
“None of them worked for me,” Sherlock says with a shrug. “They don’t do what I want them to do. I don’t need spells or wands to channel my magic into action; I just move the magic around me in the right pattern and it does what I want.”
John looks up from the table in the break room of the clinic. “I’m alright,” John says. “I think I’m getting a cold.”
He stops, unable to continue. John swallows and reaches out, hesitating for just a moment before settling his hand on Sherlock’s shoulder. “It’s alright,” he says.
“Alright, love, alright,” John says.  He runs his hand up and down Sherlock’s side and Sherlock shivers, over-sensitive, and John kisses his hip, his lips feather-light, as he slides in a third finger.
“You have to find that woman,” Billy says, and John turns to look at him, feeling just on the verge of a breakdown, when a new voice suddenly enters their conversation.
John stands stock still, heedless of the spirits around him, and realizes that the root of what brought him everything he holds so dear in his life is the very fear he’s working so hard to bury. He suddenly feels genuinely appreciative of the fear that’s coursing through his veins, the fear he’s been trying to push away. Fear brought Sherlock to him, and through fear, he has found acceptance, wonder, joy – he thinks of the way he feels at home in 221B like he’s never felt anywhere else, the way he marvels at the beautiful things Sherlock shows him, the way the two of them laugh together even when they shouldn’t, and he smiles at the absurdity of having these thoughts in the middle of this doomed forest, but he realizes that fear has given him
“I don’t think she was that bad,” John says, struggling to keep up with Sherlock’s angry, long-legged stride.
John nods, but with a feeling of dread, he notices that his limbs are beginning to feel heavy. “Sherlock,” he says, urgency creeping into his tone. He’s not ready to go, not yet.
, John. You bought such nice ingredients,” he says, gesturing towards the bags still lying on the floor. “Mrs. Hudson put away the milk and cheeses because she didn’t want them to go bad, but she was pretending not to be my housekeeper and left the nonperishables on the floor. Honestly.”
“No,” Sherlock says. He’s surprised at how tender the word is when it comes out of his throat, and he feels as if he’s staring at John in a way he shouldn’t, but the music still feels like it’s dancing on his fingers and his heart is still aching with the longing passion of the Bruch and somehow he realizes that the whole time he was playing, he was looking at the music and seeing only John, and he swallows, watching John, hearing the gentle climax of the second movement in the soft curve of his smile, hearing the joyful opening of the third movement in the way the light reflects in his eyes, hearing the intensity and drama of the first movement’s beginning in the set of his shoulders.
Sherlock picks it up by the handle with his left hand and holds it out to John, who takes the other side of the handle with his right, and as soon as his hand is all the way around the handle, he’s no longer on Baker Street.
Arthur looks stricken, and he takes his hand away from John’s arm. “John,” he says. “You – you’re too – ”
“Sherlock’s…magic is quite unusual,” Mycroft says.  “He grants wishes.  But granting your own wish is quite taboo; a bit like divining your own future.  It was his wish, at that moment, to find you, and so he couldn’t use his magic for that; the price would be too great.”
Later, John’s exhausted and wants nothing more to sink into his chair, but he’s also starving, so he sets out with Sherlock for Angelo’s.  He realizes, though, that he has no idea how to get there.  Sherlock is walking in a very specific direction, so John follows and assumes Sherlock knows where they’re going.  It’s nowhere near where he’d found the place last time, but somehow, that doesn’t surprise him.
The man’s frown deepens, and then he lifts one hand. “Actually,” he says, “I’ve had trouble moving my pinky lately. I’ve been to the doctor, but he can’t find anything wrong.”
“I guess,” Greg says with a shrug. “I’m sure you’ve realized there’s a lot to this world you haven’t figured out yet. Probably a bit overwhelming, too, with Sherlock the one to show you.”
“John,” Sherlock begins. This time, his voice sounds raw. It’s not composed, it’s not dignified – it’s
about this,” he tells him. Redbeard growls beside him, and John can feel the spirits shifting around him, ready to act.
Sherlock glances at him. “It was a gift from me to Molly after one of the first times I consulted her.”
He’s close, though, closer than he’s been yet. It feels good to be so close, exhilarating, even, but he knows that if he plays more today, he’ll only try to play more advanced music than he should, that he’ll play fast music without proper technique and set himself back, so he sets his violin down, lets his fingers linger on the beautiful arch of the scroll and caress the soft curve of the waist, lets a soft smile play on his lips, and relishes the way his heart seems to expand in his chest.
Even as his lips move against Gabe’s, he’s imagining what it would be like to kiss Sherlock. He’s wondering whether Sherlock would make those small groaning noises, whether he’d take control like Gabe, or let John take the lead. He wonders whether Sherlock would want to kiss him at all; if that’s even something Sherlock
"Oh, it's obvious," Sherlock said, waving his hand dismissively through the air. "Do better next time."
"Oh," Sherlock said. He didn't know what else to say. 'I'm sorry' seemed strange somehow, regretting the death of a fictional person.
Sherlock smirks audibly and says, "Not long after you'd used it, apparently. It was still warm. You know, you really should wash it out after you've finished with it..."
The facsimile was kissing John, deeply, passionately. Sherlock looked away quickly, feeling his face flush, but found his eyes magnetically drawn back to the kiss. When it broke, John and the facsimile murmured some more, Sherlock frustrated by his inability to eavesdrop or lipread due to the angle.
Sherlock exploded into desperate, hissed speech, "Since Sarah. Since you told me you were going on a date with her. Don't act like you didn't kno-
John breathed against Sherlock's sac, "I want to get my fingers in you, Sherlock, and if you don't want it to hurt..."
"Looking at the logs, he's always come out within a few hours before, twenty-three hours in his longest instance," Topher said, tapping through a usage log on a tablet.
"Yeah, I figured, strike while the iron's hot. No time like the present, and all that," John says, smiling.
John looks up briefly from The Guardian and shrugs, "Sure, knock yourself out." He returns his attention to his paper, blindly reaching for some toast from his plate.
Taking advantage of John’s distraction, Sherlock somehow manages to get both pairs of pyjama pants down around their thighs, then off entirely. John breaks off the kiss and stares into Sherlock’s eyes for a long moment before looking down to see his bare cock pressed against Sherlock’s.
"The only reason it’s becoming a big deal is because, worse than just being useless to me, you’re now actually getting in the way of my work."
, and anything but gentle. In fact, beast is the right word, exactly the right word, because this desire is purely animal in nature. It’s all about gratification and power and need. He doesn’t want to gently cherish Sherlock the way he did any of the ones who came before. He wants to take out all the sexual frustration he's felt over the last few weeks, on the person who caused it. He wants to fuck Sherlock until he grunts, until he comes, until he shows that he’s human, an animal, just like John, after all. He wants to mark him and be inside him and own him. He's swept away by this incredibly visceral need, stripped of all control. He wants to make Sherlock understand, make him feel it too.
After breakfast, John dressed himself in the bathroom, then came back into the room to sit on the side of the bed, at the end, waiting to be discharged.
"Obviously," Sherlock muttered, and then smiled as he got the provoked harder thrust. He pushed back, hard, against John and rocked his hips, moving John's cock inside him.
’ like he did in the shower, on the phone, in John’s head every night. Make Sherlock stop ignoring him.
The last crime scene is Sherlock's favourite of the five, a fact made obvious by his highly-inappropriate glee upon arriving. He actually claps his hands and spins in a circle upon seeing the body. The killer has made a mistake, a glaring one apparently, so glaring that John and Lestrade are at a loss to understand what it is. Of course.
Sherlock moved into the kitchen and rinsed out the kettle before refilling it and turning it on. He got down two mugs, put tea bags in, went to the fridge and said a quiet thanks to their not-housekeeper for stocking the fridge with milk, butter, all the essentials. He walked back over to the mugs and waited for the kettle to boil.
"I imagine it'll be an adjustment from how most things were in the Reverie, to how they are in the real world," Sherlock said, avoiding looking at John, focusing on the detritus on the coffee table.
It’s not even like the half-admitted desire he’s occasionally felt for men. Semi-drunk notions of snogging the face off his high-school best friend Nathan when they were playing truant; a mostly-intellectual crush on his favourite (male) lecturer at university, which culminated in a couple of dates with hand-holding and gentle kisses but nothing more; the occasional leisurely barracks-downtime mutual handjob session with sweet young Private Parker in Afghanistan. Encounters he'd previously written off as curiosity, hero-worship and desperation, respectively, now shown to him in a different light: the light cast by Sherlock Holmes. All examples of his now-acknowledged experimentation with and desire for men, but still nothing compared to what he's feeling right now.
Sherlock's eyes were still squeezed closed when John's mouth latched onto his right nipple, and just like that he couldn't breathe, couldn't think. John planted his hand in the middle of Sherlock's chest, holding him down against the bed as his body arched. Sherlock looked down, his own mouth falling open as he watched John's lips and tongue moving on his skin, his cheeks hollowing as he sucked. John's eyes met his and he felt like he was catching fire, like John was burning him with the heat in his gaze.
, and I wasn't bored. I saw all that you were on that day, and yet I still wanted to know more. That never happens to me. I deduce people's motives, their desires, everything about them, and then I deem them tedious and move on to the next thing.
With a fond chuckle, John moved to stand at the end of the bed, pushed his pants down and kicked them off. His cock, standing erect and proud from his body, bounced with the movement and Sherlock took his own cock in hand, squeezing and stroking it as he watched John move, unable to resist the impulse, legs still splayed wide on the bed. His body was still trembling slightly, his pale, pale skin flushed pink in patches, his hair darkened with sweat and stuck to his forehead.
John moved quickly, his whisky glass dropping to the floor and smashing against the fire's hearth as he swooped on Sherlock, slipping a hand into the hair at the back of his head and taking his lips in a fierce kiss. It was nothing like the kiss they'd shared in Reverie, no gentleness, no holding back, it was unbridled, violent—John licking into Sherlock's mouth, biting at his lips, hurting in his desperation to devour him.
"Do you have anything matching that description, which I could use to demonstrate?" Sherlock enquires, his tone all exaggerated politeness.
"Nothing anyone could do to you is as bad as the way you'll torture yourself if you hurt him," Reverie Sherlock warned, his eyes narrowed. "I know you know that."
John doesn’t think his dick’s ever been this hard. It’s aching, pressed against the mattress as he slowly bobs his head, sucking Sherlock’s cock. If he’s not careful, he’ll come just from the friction he’s generating against his bottom sheet and the almost-overwhelming full-body sensation of having Sherlock in his mouth. He definitely didn’t expect to enjoy sucking cock as much as he does, but
When he walked back into his bedroom, John was in his bed. Naked. Post-coital. Smiling. Beckoning him. Loving him. It was so much like the Reverie it was almost surreal, but this time he knew—this was
"So you can disappear for three. Fucking. Days. Without a word to me, doing god only knows what, and I have to tell you my every movement? No. No, that's not how it works."
With reluctance, Sherlock withdrew from John when the intrusion became uncomfortable. He lay next to John, slipping an arm under his neck, holding him on the rug in front of the fire, needing to stay close. John clutched Sherlock to him, breathing heavily, his eyes squeezed closed.
“No, I don’t,” said John cheerfully. “The best you can hope for is a bath bomb, really, and honestly, even if you do luck out and get one, odds are that Molly’s the one who bought it and it’s a glittery one.”
my fault. I know you have a high opinion of what is and isn't under my control, Sherlock, but the finer details of law-making of other nations, broadly speaking, isn't."
He looks up at John, who has just retrieved Sherlock’s coat from the overhead compartment and draped it over his lap, giving them cover for… whatever John has in mind.
Sherlock knows John loved Mary. He never would've stood next to John while he promised herself to her if he hadn't believed he loved her.
He felt almost lindsided. He hadn’t even realised properly that this was what they were headed for. There was so much he needed to figure out.
They had touched often before. Fuck, they’d carried each other before. They’d held each other up, they’d helped each other undress, they’d run across London while holding hands.
Sherlock's fingers move, then. Just a tiny bit, but they were hovering around John's waist and now they move and John can't help his sharp intake of breath. And the fucking hip-to-thigh-situation has become utterly intolerable. John' closes his eyes and dips his head, accidentally (or is it?) almost resting his forehead on Sherlock's shoulder. Exposing his throat to Sherlock's breath. And John doesn't think he's imagining that it's become quicker still, where it ghosts over his skin.
"I don't think being a mess is something that improves by repetition," she says with a tilt of her head. "Rather the reverse."
And although they've often been in closer contact during the nights they've spent together, this feels different. Very different.
John didn’t think he imagined that his back arched the slightest bit, presenting his backside even better.
That’s not to say that John didn’t feel uneasy. He had a hard time concentrating on the television. His eyes kept sliding off his book. The Sudoku he only did when Sherlock wasn’t around to mock him seemed completely beyond him.
"I mean it, Sherlock. He was so close to giving up when I found him. Back then. And having gone that close to the brink once? It only means he now knows the way. It won't take him as long the second time to find himself there."
John rubbed his temple, stared at his flatmate who still refused to meet his eyes and decided to let the matter drop. For now.
He got the wine and John put his rice-masterpiece on the table along with the curry and it was lovely. Civilised.
“Sherlock,” John said in a low voice. “I'll be here.” And he quickly grabbed Sherlock's hand and held on to it a few seconds.
John had never been much of the hand-holding type. But he'd held the hands of his parents as they died. First his mum and later his dad.
Sherlock doesn’t even know what Mary’s doing, after she's gone. Where is she going, which loose end is she planning to cut? Does she have some secret resources in Belarus that she needs to recover before the showdown? Does she have a mentor in America that she needs to consult? Has she sent Ajay a message asking him to meet her in Norway for a final confrontation?
"Look good?” Sherlock interrupted. “You just said that I could pull it off, that I look good in it is clearly a step up from that."
Sherlock has managed to tug John’s shirt loose and his fingers steal upwards, towards John’s nipples, even as John wrestles with the button of Sherlock’s trousers.
But this was different. Sherlock's large hand lay unmoving under John's. It was warm and solid and John liked the feel of it there. And John hoped that it somehow managed to convey to Sherlock that things were different now. There were different things on the horizon now. That John wasn't leaving.
He hasn't done anything else, mind you. He hasn't contacted his landlord, he hasn't looked at flats online - but he has almost completely packed.
"I'll call a cab." And Sherlock sweeps through the house, gathering up a surprising amount of things that have somehow migrated over to John's home in the last few weeks. And then he calls the cab.
Sherlock wonders if Mary is right next to him. He has no idea how the Watsons are communicating these days. What Mary tells John, what he feels after the Christmas from Hell – anything.
The days while Mary was raking up air-miles were harrowing. John had spent much of them at 221B with Sherlock and Rosie. They told Mrs. Hudson that Mary had gone unexpectedly to visit her aunt, who’d suffered a stroke. Mrs. Hudson had done them the courtesy of pretending to believe that. And she’d helped them distract Rosie, even though she isn’t much use when it comes to any actual lifting, holding or rocking of the child.
He couldn't take liberties with Sherlock's person, his body, his personal space. Sherlock was one of those people who had a huge fucking personal space. He radiated danger and contempt. People usually had the good sense not to come too close. Holding his hand when he was unable to stop it from happening was...unthinkable.
Sherlock tries not to look at John too much on the way. Tries not to read too much into his face. Tries not to guess what he’s thinking.
“Well, in such special circumstances it would have to be something truly… outrageous,” Sherlock said in a low voice. “Something you’d never even think of doing at any other time.”
“I could always remote control you,” Sherlock said with a small grin. He looked devastatingly beautiful in the light from the street, hair in disarray, a hint of blush on his cheeks.
"And why didn't we call Lestrade? Surely we've seen enough criminal activity in the last hour to involve the Met."
This is worrying on several levels. John doesn't need to list them - they're obvious to anyone who's met either John or Sherlock.
John is still hopelessly aroused by the most annoying man in London, Sherlock continues not to make a move, and John can neither stay in the status quo (and remain celibate forevermore) nor give up the current situation (for some hypothetical girlfriend and source of sex).
Daunting as hell as well – but John Watson didn’t think of himself as someone who backed down from a challenge, so he opened his mouth and tasted Sherlock. He licked carefully, getting a feel for him, getting to know his taste and texture. The sounds from Sherlock didn’t disappoint. He positively whimpered and his knees seemed to wobble slightly.
John felt rather proud of himself for asking this as he and Sherlock did the dishes after dinner. It was a sign that he was moving on from the emotional aspect of his marriage and to the practical. He wasn’t panicking about anything – he was tackling this sensibly.
“Right. Well." John clenched his hand tight and soldiered on. "The thing is. I just wanted to ask, you know. If there was any news. About. You know.”
And Christ, it's better than it has any right to be. There is more electricity in that kiss than in... Than in anything John has done with another person, ever.
It's absurd, how that can make him blush there in the dark. This stupid, mundane, domestic idea of grabbing John's hand. In public. Or at home. Without either himself or John taking any notice of it, because it's such a common, unremarkable event.
"What do I need to do to make you leave? Aside from pushing you." He allows his gaze to trail down the roof and to the busy street below. "And trust me, I'm considering it."
Of course he'll take care of John. Like she did, when he left John. Only this time Sherlock will be there for him. This time he'll be the one John can rely on. This time Sherlock will do everything right. This time Sherlock won't be the villain in the story.
All things told, it was hardly the craziest thing they had ever done. At some point in the future they’d probably do something even stupider. It wasn’t a big deal.
But he doesn't wait to do that. He's eager to suck his bottom lip into his mouth, lick it and taste it and worship it in any way he knows how. And Sherlock - Sherlock who doesn't think of this sort of thing as "his area" seems blissfully eager to do the same, dipping his tongue between John's lips with passion and eagerness John had never imagined the great Sherlock Holmes might actually turn on him.
John is standing up from his seat and Sherlock squeezes his eyes shut, retreating into his mind palace – maybe to figure out how the hell this went so wrong, maybe just to hide somewhere with Redbeard.
"Yeah, but most people don't know shit," said John. "Except maybe that you really can pull off a deerstalker, which is, I grant you, something of a superpower in this day and age."
And so it went. Step for step. Direction, compliment, another direction. Keeping eye contact for almost the entire time. And John didn’t do anything different from what he normally would do, he thought, but still, somehow, he ended up with a pot of tea that tasted like Sherlock had made it.
“Don’t spoil it,” John said as he nudged Sherlock with a socked foot. “What would you do? Anything at all.”
Well, obviously, he could lie to him. He's done that, before. He's bluffed, he's deflected and he's outright lied to his face. But if this is supposed to be their new beginning, he can't do that now.
Sherlock was hunched over his microscope when John entered the flat, apparently deep in research, but his dressing gown was gently fluttering around his calves. One might suspect that he’d rushed to this position only moments before.
"Well, you could always move up there," Mycroft said musingly. "At least one of you. If one of you had a permanent residence there you'd probably fall within the parameters of the current law regarding residents."
John’s right hand slipped between Sherlock’s legs and took a light hold of Sherlock’s bollocks as he sucked all the harder.
"I'm pretty sure there are ways other than marriage to deal with those," John ground out. His mind helpfully offered a picture of him trying to explain to Sally Donovan that he was married to Sherlock Holmes for inheritance reasons.
In the end he just mirrors what John did to him. Firm grip, quick wrist movements, eager kisses. And in 78 seconds John Watson has come all over Sherlock’s hands. John keeps eye contact throughout, looking as if Sherlock is the greatest thing ever. It’s every exclamation of “brilliant” and “extraordinary” rolled into one look.
At least John didn’t think so until he found Sherlock drunk in the sitting room at two in the afternoon.
“Bed,” Sherlock agreed, finally daring to let his hand trail down below John’s waistband. “Come on.”
"Well, I'd like to take this opportunity to tell you that the idea for that particular trap was entirely Sherlock's," said Mycroft while inspecting his nails.
"But you do! And I know you don’t believe me but I… I care, Sherlock. So, like you helped prepare my wedding, let me do this."
"Mhm. Did you know that you can be accused of physical assault without physically touching the assaulted?"
They’ve settled in Sherlock’s bed and turned off the lights when John asks what he’s been wondering.
Not that John was all that concerned about getting to him at first. He was more interested in getting to find Sherlock in the A&E. And he didn’t even hesitate when telling the nurse that he was there to see Sherlock Holmes, his husband. The words came quite easily and unbidden. He brandished his ID at her, saw her look Sherlock up in the General Register to confirm their relationship, and then he was whisked off to see his partner.
A hand in his hair was all the warning he got – he could feel a sudden increase of slickness in his mouth before he managed to pull off and jerk Sherlock through what looked like a fairly spectacular orgasm.
Well. Obviously they would say that they bloody well did. Goes without saying. Clearly. John isn't willing to give up on his love life for a platonic love affair with his flatmate. He might be old and broken and defeated - but he still isn't willing to permanently give up on looking for love.
Sherlock was nowhere to be found when John made his way downstairs. Which was a bit worrying, as Sherlock could hardly be in a fit state for flouncing about London after the previous day.
And it's good. It’s really good, and for the first time for weeks, John Watson is looking forward to waking up to a new day, more than he is about crawling into bed at night.
As he disappears the flight attendant covertly drops two bottles of water on John’s vacated seat. And a small note containing her phone number and the name of her hotel is also included.
“Yes,” Sherlock said in a low, rumbling voice. John imagined he could feel the heat radiating off his body, he could certainly smell his cologne. He held his breath as Sherlock said in a low voice: “Some of the above.”
b) How would one go about figuring out if said Sherlock Holmes is interested in said level, and if he isn't, if he'd take offence when John put on the moves?
But conversations like the one about A.G.R.A. are a must. They can’t be avoided. The one about drinking on the way to Morocco – well, it can be avoided for a bit longer. Maybe John will sleep on the way. Maybe he’ll stop after three. Maybe they’ll have time for a kip in Morocco, before Mary arrives. Three drinks is okay for now, if that’s all there’ll become of it.
Clearly, Sherlock must be aware how their physical proximity affects John. Sherlock notices everything. If he was interested, it would be the easiest thing in the world for him to initiate... Something. The fact that he doesn’t speaks for itself.
"Yes and no," she says as she crosses her ankles. "You’ll be there for him, this time around. But you'll also serve as a reminder of how he's gone through this before. Your presence will remind him how he has been betrayed before. Abandoned. You'll need to do something a bit better than taking him along on cases and showing off for him. It won't be enough. Not when he'll be doubting everything he is and everything he's ever done. Being a second fiddle won't help him with that. You'll need to cast him in a central role."
"I know that’s what you think, Sherlock," she says with a sad smile. "Why do you think I’m having these talks with you?"
He knows they can't afford to eat take-out every night, but he's exhausted after the burst of activity that culminated in him moving, and he can't really face going to the shops. Even though it means that they'll have nothing for breakfast in the morning.
And he doesn’t feel out of his depth. This feels just right, Sherlock's body feels familiar and exciting at once and John's fingers and lips move over it confidently.
“They were all horribly understanding, of course. It appears to be both obvious and perfectly understandable that I am a madman."
And so John sits there, on the sofa, feeling every inch that separates them, pathetically counting down the minutes until they can go to bed and touching will be allowed again.
The strange, hyper-awareness of his proximity of his convalescence hadn’t been good. It had brought certain awkwardness.
"Blow-jobs. The key to your happiness with John. Really, the best way to get him to agree to anything, to forgive anything and to generally get him in a pleased and pliant mood."
John closed his eyes when he slipped his hand under Sherlock’s open shirt. All that warm skin made him feel dizzy. He could feel himself involuntarily jerk when Sherlock’s big hand mimicked the motion, and an electric current ran through him. His breath was laboured and he was almost painfully aroused. He wanted to try everything, but his body was telling him that “everything” had better be achieved quickly, because time was running out.
It had been there, that awful night. When John had cried in Sherlock’s arms and Sherlock hadn’t said a word. Only held him so tight that John knew that he’d stay for as long as John needed him to and then never mention it again.
Sure, Sherlock might very well beat him in a fight. The man spent hours on Youtube, learning new tricks, mashing up the best of martial arts from all corners of the universe. Sherlock was a clever opponent, quick, smart and vicious – but right then John allowed him to feel which of them was physically stronger.
Also the slight swagger, usually displayed by men who have recently been assured of their sexual magnetism.
"It matters," said John, perversely glad that Sherlock finally seemed to be taking an interest, "because we all have an image. We are all our own creations, and don't tell me that you, of all people, aren't aware of it, Mr. One-liner. Don't tell me that you are ignorant about how we portray ourselves. I live with you, remember. I know all about your hair products, how much time you take getting dressed, how much you spend on your look. I've seen you put on masks for all sorts of occasions, Sherlock. You know that these things matter. The message you choose to send out about yourself. It matters."
It's intolerable enough that she's had her hands all over John Watson. It's utterly insufferable to be constantly reminded of her exploration of areas that remain a mystery to himself, but her insertion of herself in those private thoughts is perhaps the worst of all.
John feels completely at Sherlock's mercy with one hand in him and the other one wrapped around him.
"Well, some sort of benefits then.” Sherlock waved a hand. “Medical decision making. Inheritance. Whatever."
Sherlock might even decide that the bed sharing is then not necessary at all, which would be a Very Bad Thing. So John doesn't say anything.
It was intense – maybe more intense than any sexual encounter John could remember having – but although Sherlock’s eyes were burning, there was also joy on his face. Simple happiness, that made John’s heart clench with the knowledge that this was real, this was a new aspect of them that fitted perfectly with all the rest. John gave a small laugh and rested his forehead against Sherlock’s shoulder, and clenched his fingers in his shirt.
The smile makes a brave appearance on John's lips but doesn't manage to get anywhere near his eyes as he agrees. "Yeah. Right. She might."
He sent Sherlock a couple of texts but didn't get any reply. He left for work feeling unsettled and nervous. He had a feeling that something was about to happen, and that he wouldn't especially like it when it did.
It had taken Sherlock some time to realise that John was simply useless at this relatively simple task. After several lectures about how he shouldn’t be able to mess up tea-making, followed by John still messing it up, John had been forbidden to make the tea.
While John is having this meltdown, Sherlock is just the same as ever. He yells at the telly, he does unspeakable things to stuff in the bathtub, he summons John to crime scenes where he proceeds to ignore him, he eats take-out, he makes tea and he sleeps next to John every night.
John found himself running most things he wanted to say through some inner censor before saying it at all. There were fewer jokes, fewer nights in, fewer meals out. Everything felt a bit stilted, awkward, strange. Almost like it had back when Sherlock had returned from dead.
“Obviously,” Sherlock says, finally looking up when John comes into the kitchen. He’s about to add a remark about how John must be blind if he didn’t notice his coat on the hook and his shoes sitting by the door, but he stops because an unexpected wave of
John shakes his head. “But that’s not your fault,” he says. “It must have been hard, growing up like that, believing yourself to be something horrible.”
Sherlock’s head swivels and his heart pounds and his palms sweat and the name rises unbidden to his tongue.   “
John blinks again, turning his head again to look at Sherlock. “But you – he said there wasn’t a door, I thought you were–”
“Of course not,” Sherlock replies. “How’s your pinky, then?” He sounds like he doesn’t care to hear the answer.
He doesn’t know how he’s gone from a casual lie-in to desperate and wound-up and needy so quickly, but this happens with John on a regular basis; John is everything, John is his heart, his sun, his drug, his life, and he finds it hard to handle the idea that John is actually his, that he can feel these things, that John wants him, and sometimes the feeling creeps up on him and then hits him all at once, leaving him stunned, desperate, in disbelief.
The concern evident in the tilt of her eyebrows and softness of her mouth is so strong that John feels compelled to look away for a moment, holding his lips firm and breathing through his nose and doing his best to keep his emotions in check. He’s not far from the shore, and so he ignores her for a moment, swimming the short distance with Redbeard while she climbs down from the rock. Once he’s on land, he wrings his shirt out as best he can with his unsteady and wet hands while Redbeard gives himself a mighty shake, water spraying everywhere.
Sherlock is stiff. His eyes are wide, and he’s staring, unfocused, at the window behind John. His pulse has skyrocketed and he can barely breathe, but John doesn’t seem to notice or care.
“…yeah, 8:00 is perfect, I’ll be there, I promise!” He laughs for a moment before he speaks again. “Yeah, yeah, pinky promise!...Yeah, it’s just a stupid dinner with the new head of forensics. Should be
