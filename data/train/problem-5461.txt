“I get that,” Dean muses, nodding, “Have you heard from anywhere else yet?”
She smiles a little sadly. “I have presents. The flowers are from Dean,” She says, gesturing to the bouquet. Cas' heart monitor picks up, and Adra laughs, “The library staff were asking about you, too.”
Except when he cooks for Cas, apparently.
They take a moment and breathe together in, hold, out.
He reaches out tentatively and puts a hand on Adra's shoulder. She turns to him and clings, gripping tight to his shoulder. It's not long for him to cling back, his own eyes welling with tears.
“I –“ Dean pauses. He swallows, and flashes a smile. “It's fine. Really.”
Sam's heat sinks. “Oh. Okay. Will you ask him when he wakes up?”
He glances away. “Well, your fucking cat attacked me! I was just standing here!”
“That was my real rock bottom,” Bobby grimaces, “I remember layin' in the hospital just... angry at the whole world for takin' my Karen away. But I think I was really angry at myself, you know? I was trying to punish myself. But then it occured to me, well, I wouldn't be the man Karen married if I gave up. The world doesn't just stop turnin' when you lose somebody and it's not fair to let it.”
Dean puts his hands up, but Sam's not having it.
He grimaces, "Sorry." He runs his fingers through his hair, which sticks up at odd angles no matter what he does to it. The dye is fresh enough to leave blue stains on his fingers.
The rest of the show is amazing. Everyone who performs is just as talented as the last. Jo does amazingly accompanying the different players, and during closing remarks they give her and the other senior a special shout out. Afterwards, they are freed to the hallway lobby while they wait for the players to come back. Castiel is tucked away near the water fountain, looking worn. Sam goes over.
Dr. Marilyn nods, “Ah, this is Dean. I've heard good things. Castiel gave me permission to speak with you, actually. Um, may we talk?” They nod. The doctor closes the door and draws the shades. “Have a seat.”
“Glad you guys could make it.”
It hardens again. "What--"
“I bet.” Adra says, stirring her coffee, “Sometimes I – I'll look out there and still expect to see her sitting on the edge of the fountain, one hand in the water. You know.”
Castiel actually laughs, chuckling into his fist.
They go.
“Is something wrong?”
“Yes.”
Sam snorts and makes room on the couch, "It can't be any worse than the one you gave me."
Dean wants to slap his hands over his ears. "Just a minute," He forces himself to say.
He looks away. “We should get back.”
Castiel smiles and downs his beer in one go. Dean stops drinking mid-sip and watches him, slightly slack-jawed.
Dean lets out a long whistle. “Well, that blows my second-largest ball of twine story out of the water.”
"Hm," Castiel muses, "If there's actual dancing, I see the appeal. I took a dance class with Alfie, once."
“Um,” She says, tilting her head to peer into the cage, “Yes. Yes, I'll take him. Thank you, Dean.”
"I don't see why you like hanging out with that queer," John says, "Y'know, when I was your age a guy like that, well, we would've..." He chuckles to himself.
“Thank you, Dean. I love it.”
“Oh,” Dean whispers, “What's her name, again? Glinda?”
"I'll make sure he does!" Dean says from the kitchen.
Castiel takes a deep breath, which comes out a little shaky. He smiles at Dean crookedly.
Dean snorts.
“Yes! She's gonna be at the tournament, and we're going out for lunch after.”
“Good to meet you,” He says.
Dean looks him up and down, biting his lip on one side. Cas' heart pounds.
Yes, just this morning. It will be coming out next month. “No.”
Of course, just then, Sam bangs on the door.
“Um,” He says, his eyes stuck where Dean's touching him, “It was fun. We were sixteen and terrible, but we did learn something."
“Oh shit.” She puts her pen down.
“How did you deal with it?” He asks, “Losing Karen, I mean.”
Dean tastes of something spicy and Castiel swallows it up like he can't get enough. He can't, really; Dean is warm and alive under him, seeping his heat into Castiel and he loves it, needs it like he needs air.
Dean is jostled awake at the ass-crack of dawn when Princess Leia lumbers in and sticks her paws on Dean's chest.
Dean takes a deep breath. A recent conversation with Castiel rings in his ears. 'A good parent wouldn't treat you like that, Dean. Don't let him.' Dean looks at John, really looks at him: his shirt with a hole in it, his face a couple days unshaven, the hard line of his mouth, and tries to reconcile it with the Dad he remembers, the one who hum while he cleaned, and fall asleep watching baseball games, and would swing Dean above his head just to get him to laugh.
Castiel picks up the envelope with shaking hands. It's a couple letters from Anna tucked in there together: the first one she sent, along with the funniest. There are a couple photos, too. One he's particularly fond of is him grinning closed-mouthed at the camera, with Anna beside him trying to bat the camera away. They're in front of the fountain and it's a clear, sunny day. Another one, he's not sure that she knew he took of her: she's sitting on the edge of the fountain, leaning back on one arm. It was warm, so she had her jacket rolled up to her elbows. She's resting her chin in one hand and looking at some far-off point with a hint of a smile on her mouth. She looks calm. The last photo is the laminated card from her funeral, a school picture. She was 15 years old.
“That explains so much."
He groans once.
When they part, Cas looks from his eyes to his lips a couple times. Dean swallows.
“You finish your paper?”
Dean blinks a couple times, then takes a long drink of his beer, “Oh,” he says, his voice a little hoarse, “Oh, uh, good for you.”
"Would you like to go on a date?"
Meg, now over by the sink, smiles, “I'll let Uriel know.”
Dean goes through about a dozen different facial expressions in the manner of a few seconds. "Oh."
"I want to."
Dean huffs and rolls over. Annoyed, his dad goes for a jab of a single, stiff pointer finger right between Dean's ribs. He yelps and jumps up.
"How is it?" Dean leans over and asks.
They quiet down when they start eating, no one wanting to foul the religious experience that is Bobby's cooking.
“But you will not understand it.”
Outside, the snow has started to come down in earnest. Cas' face gets cold as soon as he steps outside. Dean's ears and cheeks are turning pink by the end of the driveway, but he doesn't say anything about it. They walk around for a few minutes, Dean huffing every once in a while. He jams his hands into his pockets. He scuffs his feet, occasionally kicking loose rock down the street. Castiel walks beside him, his arms at his sides. The lights on a nearby house flip from red to blue to green.
Dean sighs and glances at his dark phone screen, “Not yet. Adra's heading over now, though, so hopefully I'll have an update within the hour.”
"I see."
Victor shows up fifteen minutes after Dean, clutching one arm and limping a little.
She smiles and takes another look at him, “Coming in here can get lonely, so it's a good thing he has you.”
“Go on,” Dean urges.
“Shhh!” Charlie shushes, glancing at the open bedroom door. She creeps over and closes it, whispering, “Shhh. I haven't told them we're dating yet.”
Jo leans her head back on the window and looks up at the ceiling, or perhaps through it. “I think grief is just the price you pay for love, yanno?” She says after a few moments.
“Shit,” Sam says.
“It was. Thankfully, my cold was very mild. Any worse and it could have been totally debilitating to someone like me.”
And that's that, for now.
When Ash is finished, all Jo says is, “You're crazy,” and rolls her eyes.
“Do what?”
He flashes a quick smile.
They get the gravy cleaned up with help from Gabe, who meows and saunters off into Sam's room. After that, the boys get started on dinner. Well, Dean tries to get started, but Sam yells at him and says potatoes need to be microwaved before you can mash them, and promptly banishes him from the kitchen.
Ellen, who had overheard, practically pushes them out the door. She flips the sign to Closed and follows them out.
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean looks up to the front of the room again. Adra has pulled off to the side, grabbing tissues out of one of the many boxes. This leaves the path to the front open wide for Dean.
Castiel shrugs, not denying it, and Dean blushes.
"Wow," Dean says, touching the photos gently. "What happened after that?"
“I see.”
"Oh, so I'm not allowed to miss you now?"
Dean laughs, his breath puffing out like smoke in front of him. “Does that count as instant karma?”
“Really? I didn't see a Dr. Novak on the roster.”
“Yeah, sure,” He shrugs.
Jo emerges a few minutes later, back in jeans with her concert dress slung over her shoulder. Dean hands her the daffodils and points in Sam and Cas' direction. She trots over, her brow furrowed. Sam nudges Cas, who flickers his eyes open. She crouches down.
“We're happy to.”
"No."
"Yes, sir?"
Dean laughs. Ah, there he is, there's Castiel, “Right. He is the point of view character, though.”
“Oh! Would she want to come over for dinner, too?”
. We're friends.”
“Geez, she's blowing off your mom, too? Real dick move.”
"Cool, man, I'm glad you like it. Do you need anything else?"
“Do you think he'd think differently of you?"
After a beat of silence, Dean swings his leg over and rolls into a standing position. This leaves Castiel with a direct view of Dean's ass in his jeans. Castiel forces himself to look at the ceiling, but he steals a glance a couple times.
Castiel fights the urge to roll his eyes, “Let's start with the cat. If your dad had no say in what you did, what would you do?”
“I'm back here!” Anna shouts, and Castiel is assailed with the smell of roasting garlic and some kind of vegetables.
“Oh.” He shuffles so he's sitting cross-legged, leaning up to the front seat. “What do you believe then?”
He hesitates. His throat is tight.
Huh. Maybe Charlie's onto something.
"Cas!"
Charlie offers him a hand.
“Um, good night.”
“Theater,” He says with a wink.
"Yeah, I got a test tomorrow." She gestures to the diagram of a molecule.
She gets herself under control a few minutes or centuries or miliseconds later.
Dean chuckles, "Jess is making Sammy watch Twilight, so he's making me watch it, so I'm making you watch it."
“Yes,” Adra says, taking a steadying breath, “I'm his mother.”
Castiel laughs. He purses his lips for a minute, still thinking, "What do you think about Captain Kirk? Does he return Spock's affection?”
CW: Discussions of food and calories, depression, and off-screen suicide of a minor character
“Make me.”
Bobby freezes.
She glances over to him, “Oh, I was kidding.”
Cas straightens his back. With a wave, he leads Dean up the stairs. He leaves his hand trailing a little behind him, until Dean takes his first two fingers and brushes them against his knuckle. Cas jumps. He looks back and Dean is bright red.
"Of course, man."

Charlie smiles to herself for a minute, “She's just... So cool, you know? Like, I just really like her as a person, too.”
“You also think Sarah Jessica Parker is hot,” Jo points out.
“Well, yes, but also Dean.”
“The treatments.”
“No.”
“I suppose they won't care.”
“Mm,” Adra nods, wiping some sticky off on a napkin, “How did you feel about coming back?”
“Shut up! Shut up! It's always Dad this and Dad that! Dad's not fucking here, Dean! You wanna know why? Because he sucks!”
“Nothin'. I just... I wish Castiel were here.”
Won't ever be Anna again.
There is some shuffling behind the door, and some swearing, but after a few beats, Dean yanks open the Alpha house door and fixes Cas with a warm smile.
Dean chuckles.
Dean smiles. “Yeah, I know what you mean.”
“They are.” She swallows and looks at him with a glint in her eyes, “Hey, you wanna get outta here?”
“'Course.”
“Um.” Castiel says, “I am afraid your gift is less impressive.”
Dean nods slowly, watching the clock as he chews it over. "So losing the vegetables really threw a wrench in that plan?"
“So, tell me about Castiel.”
“I do know. I think about it, too.” He takes a deep breath, in, hold, out. After a moment, he adds, "Um, mother?"
“And... Let it go wherever it wants in the house. Aside from my room.”
Dean scowls, "I mean, no? But I kinda, like, don't wanna tell him, at least not yet."
Castiel nods, slowly, “I see.”
“Yeah, I guess so.”
He had attempted to respond last night, which went about as well as could be expected.
Inside is brightly lit and something sizzles on the stove. Jo and Ellen are laughing in another room, but the kitchen they enter through is all Bobby's territory. He wheels over when he hears them come in.
“Yeah.” He says, and Dean gets what he means. He stares at him hard, not sure what to say.
He's lean and gruff and surprisingly strong. Yet his hands are cold all the time, which Dean knows from passing notes back and forth in English, or from petting the cat at the same time, or once when a very sleepy Castiel carted a hand through Dean's hair when he passed him on the way to the bathroom.
"Who will be there?"
He shrugs, "I have a Latin paper due on Monday and Dr. Adler is a hardass about grammar."
“How are you?”
Cas laughs and Dean can feel it against his own chest.
“Cause she is, dude, you just don't get it.”
“There ya go. Can you talk?”
“Well, that sounds like a proof to me.”
Jo smiles, flushing, and stands to take a bow.
“Right. Exactly. There's nothing straight about it.”
Eugh, so much for a good night's sleep.
"Όχι, αλλά έχουμε κρασί."
“He left early,” She says, folding her arms, “But I'm keeping him,” she insists.
“It's Sam,” Sam mumbles. He looks over to Jess and they both turn a truly tomatoey shade of red.
he manages before shutting off his phone completely.
"Do you ever get, like, uncomfortable?" He asks, biting his lip, "Like, around other families?"
"Great,” He grins, “I just wanted to make sure."
They reminisce about the party as the caffeine seeps into their veins.
He nods and marches forward. About halfway there, he stops and turns around.
After a long moment, Adra says, “I have pie.”
“You know Bobby Singer?” Dean asks after a few minutes of watching.
She shakes her head, “I don't either.”
“Shit, really?” He lets out a low whistle.
Oh, fuck. It hits Dean like a lightning bolt in a summer storm: Everything that made Castiel
“I do not.”
,'” Captain Kirk says on screen, pointing up at a far-off constellation, “
His roommate is out when he gets back to his dorm. He hasn't seen the man much at all since the year started, but that's partly on him. Garth seems nice, if a little weird, but Cas doesn't really have room to judge.
Great. Castiel wipes his mouth and turns around. Dean is a couple inches shorter than him. Castiel has no idea what he's thinking. Who in their right mind let you leave the house looking like that? or I can't believe we're partners, I'm going to talk to Miss Sands on Monday and tell her to switch me immediately, come to mind.
He snorts, “No, the people who brought 'em did.”
https://www.thetrevorproject.org/
He squints at it for a long moment before giving up and pushing the call nurse button. A nurse who is not Meg comes by and reads the note for him. It's from his mother, saying she and Dean came by, that they are missing him dearly, and that they'll be back in in the morning. Castiel thanks the nurse and holds the note close to his heart.
“Shit.”
“Yes, I gathered that.”
Sam claps hard when it's over, and Kevin smiles into the crowd.
“Yes?”
“Ahh,” Charlie says, nodding, “Right. That's fair, high school's tough. Um, well, think about it, will ya?”
“Ugh.” She huffs, pulling her shirt down a little and adjusting her boobs. The things she does for her friends, seriously. She just hopes they get the money in time.
CW for John Winchester's A+ Parenting
“She painted the horses.”
"What? No! No, not at all." He turns red. "No, I just... It-- it's. Good for you."
His mother is on the night shift again, which leaves them a few hours together when Castiel isn't sleeping. They don't talk much. Adra does some organizing. Occasionally she moves a chess piece. Whenever Castiel is awake, he moves one as well. They've been playing for about a week now, all together. They make good progress today: he takes a knight, she takes a rook and a couple pawns.
“Uh. Yeah, maybe.”
“Leia! Leia! Bad dog!” Charlie shouts, grabbing her collar and heaving her backwards. “Go upstairs. Mooom!”
Castiel stares at his mother's outstretched hand, wide-eyed. Jo bursts out laughing. She laughs for a long minute, so hard that tears start to stream down her face.
They say their goodbyes and Dean agrees to meet the Harvelle's for lunch after taking Castiel home. Out in the car, Cas lies down in the back, so Sam gets the passenger seat. Dean doesn't even play music, just lets his boyfriend sleep.
“Hello, Anna.”
He groans once.
Fucking shit fuck.
Adra is sitting at the kitchen table reading when they come back in.
"Yeah, them."
"Yes, Dean, go set the table," Castiel says. Dean glares; Traitor.
People start filing in as Dean hands Castiel his second beer of the night. Someone brings in a couple jugs of some mixed drink concoction that tastes like raspberry with an aftertaste of vodka orange juice. Soon enough, the party is in full swing. Castiel is surprised to see a handful of people he recognizes, including Bela and a couple guys from his Calc class.
“Um, thank you.”
Dean screws up his face in concentration, “Ah, geez. These are the, uh, proofs you were having trouble with a couple weeks ago?”
Dean lets out a whistle, "God damn. Have you tried microwave meals?"
30, 40, 50. Fuck. He needs to think fast. He thrusts his hands out, grabs the goblin's ankles and tugs, so the goblin goes down, hard on his ass. Dean rolls over and springs up, sprinting to the trees.
“I'm kidding, Cas. That's cool! Really. Where've you lived?”
“No,” Castiel smiles.
Dean pulls over and puts his hazards on. He sighs, wishing he had a joint between his lips. His hands are shaking. "Fuck," He whispers, "Shit."
He knows the feeling: He and Sam curled up in the back seat, the road ahead, the sunset behind. They made friends in the places they stopped, but most of the time they didn't stick around long enough to really matter to anyone. Some days it felt like they were the only two people in the world. That was enough, for a while. It was enough until it wasn't.
"I think I woulda liked her," Dean muses, flipping through her letter.
“Hey, Castiel.”
https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/
She smiles at him and he can't help but hug her. She is lanky, and she smells of warm cinnamon. He begins to shake a little, his eyes watering. She holds him tight, not letting go.
“Do you think he's in heaven now?”
This gets another laugh out of Sam.
“Yes, please.”
"You're sure you're okay if I go?" Adra asks, leaning against the doorframe as if trying to hold up the house. Her hair is pinned back into a neat bun-braid.
A few minutes later, Dean pops in with his apron slung over his shoulder, "Quittin' time."
"It's true. Umm, she liked baseball. Her and Ellen would always watch the games together. She couldn't stand dogs, I think she was bit by one as a kid or something. Umm. Geez, I dunno, what else do you wanna know?"
He raises his eyebrows, “Huh. That's really cool man, I dig it.”
"Yeah," Sam says quietly, "Me, too."
Adra unhooks their arms and makes her way to the front of the room. Dean makes a beeline for the photo boards. The first one is Castiel's early life. True baby photos, grainy: him and Adra in the hospital, Adra looking still like a child herself. Even as a baby, Castiel had her same straight nose and wild, dark hair. There's one from a couple years later, of Castiel sitting on a large pumpkin, frowning very seriously at the camera. Some mall photography photos. Adra and toddler Castiel at her college graduation, both beaming. Another one of Castiel in her graduation cap. Down at the bottom are the photos from Castiel's Catacombs of him and Gabe, frozen permanently in a laugh, permanently crushed together in the shared office chair.
Right. He sort of remembers leaving his number with his English teacher. He was strung up on so many medications at that point that he's surprised he gave her the right one.
"Yeah! Yeah, definitely.”
“He snores.” When Castiel sleeps, he snores, loud and constant like a car engine. Now he doesn't. Now he isn't.
Dean bites his lip. He leans over and kisses him, “Any time.”
“You know that wasn't my fault, right?” Dean snaps.
Everyone claps politely and Jo rushes back to her seat. Ellen wraps her arms around her, holding her close.
Mom swings by and stabs a couple orders into the order wheel for Ash, and says, "You got a customer at table 4."
"Yes? Is there something you need?"
“Yeah.”
"We're, uh, having dinner at Bobby's tonight, the usual gang.”
“Doctor Marilyn, hello. This is Dean, a friend of Castiel's.”
Dean chuckles.
Cas pauses, cutting his laugh short. "Wait, Dean." He puts a hand on his leg, "I do. I do like you."
“Thanks.”
Dean smiles. Gilda's pretty, with light brown skin and long, dark curls. He totally gets it.
Novak stares at her. She tosses him a wet rag and points to the booths by the window. He coughs a few times while cleaning, but he rolls up his trenchcoat sleeves and washes tables like he was born to do it. Huh. Dean mentioned something after he met up with him the first time, he thinks the kid has bad lungs. Poor guy.
, No, he crosses that out, too.
He furrows his brow.
The Bradbury's are waiting for them by the door when they get home, smiling at them. Mr. B hands them a plate of cupcakes.
“Jerk.”
He nods, “That I can. Maybe I'll steal Gabe in the meantime.”
“Yeah?”
Dean rolls his eyes, "Some people. Well, you know him, he's probably doing ungodly science experiments with it."
The world goes quiet. Dean is pulled backwards and pressed against something warm. Arms come around him. Someone is screaming; maybe it's a machine, maybe it's Adra, maybe it's him.
Anna would huff a laugh, “I'm sure. Still, there's a charm to them.” She would tear off a couple and tuck them behind her ear. The others she would put on his pillow.
“Alright?” Dean says, looking him up and down.
Castiel would be the last one to forget to treat him like a child; Jack realized that he was grateful for that.
The lancing pain retreated. The Empty gave him a searching, baffled, but no longer hate-filled look, and wandered off, stopping here and there to stare in mystification but no particular resentment, at a mossy tree trunk, or a beetle, or to meet the bright, inquisitive eye of an insect-questing bird.
“I like what you’ve done with the place.”
“And then?”
“Have you written it down?”
“They have friends on earth. Sam has Eileen. Dean has Sam,” Castiel whispered to him hoarsely from the blackness of the empty in a voice that resounded like rain on a tin roof.
He and Castiel were at odds as to what exactly constituted heaven. There was a part of Jack that wanted to gather Sam and Dean to himself so that he could keep them from harm. So they could be with their mother and father again, and all their fallen friends, the ones for whom he had not yet been able to find a justification to return to earth.
Bobby had said the same, but added ‘you eejit’ for emphasis.
“Are we recycling angels now?” He had murdered so many of them. He wasn’t sure he deserved to have that crime erased but they had not deserved to be banished into oblivion.
(“Balthazar—are you comparing Sam and Dean to a mass extinction event responsible for wiping out two-thirds of life on Earth?”
“So, you think it’s just confused?” Castiel pressed. He was teetering on the edge of a feather at present, because he had loved Dean for so long now and the other angels had told him that Dean had corrupted and contaminated him and he had known they must be wrong, because he had touched Dean’s soul and seen its depths and found it beautiful. Yet it was really the decade of hanging around with humans that had confused him most; them saying one thing and doing another or not saying anything and doing something quite unanticipated. They were a confusing species. With all due sympathy for Castiel’s confusion, Jack still hoped that one could study them forever and be eternally surprised.
Castiel had been about to embark on another lecture on the nice things that heaven needed to be stocked with in readiness for Dean—Jack could see in his mind the seething toy box of random, generally shrink-wrapped, objects that Castiel believed Dean must have—when the Empty, as much as a black wave of oblivion-seeking nothingness could be said to wail and rock, began to wail and rock. If it had possessed wild elf-locks of hair it would have been clawing at them.
They were still debating it as they stepped from the Empty into Heaven; no longer white and sterile and charred by the blasted wings of murdered angels but green and tree-filled, and with the smoke of the hut from John and Mary Winchester’s house throwing a soft grey question mark into the sky.
“To spend the day with my boyfriend. And don’t change the subject. This is the first year since forever that you don’t have your normal support system here to help you.”
“Great.” Dean felt the wet patch and knew that was going to be uncomfortable later on. “Let me change my pants before we go.”
"You know, you could have just worn a condom and you wouldn’t have to come back."
“Well, it’s great. Good job with the music chose.” Ash congratulated clapping Cas on the back.
. That’s just stupid, because even though I don’t like wearing condoms, I’ve never had a problem before. No pregnancies and no STIs. You know how lucky that makes me? Like once or twice maybe but not for two fucking years. And now that everyone thinks I gave someone something, I’ve become a pariah. I haven’t gotten laid for two months. All I’ve done is play with myself and tonight I was jacking off and somehow I got hand sanitizer on my dick and it feels like it’s on fire.” He looked into the blue eyes that did him in months before. “Can you make sure I won’t fall off or something?”
“His ceiling? Is this some weird sex thing?”
Before he could snap back, Cas stepped up to the mic. “Merry Christmas, everyone. Before the night ends, we here at the Roadhouse want to give you a little Christmas cheer. So the band has agreed to play my favorite Christmas song. So without further ado, The Angels.”
They both looked over to see what the problem was, but Dean’s attention was caught by Cas yet again. He smirked and went over just like a moth to a flame.
“Well, you’re holding my manhood, so knock yourself out.”
want.”
“You do?”
The crowd had gotten into the music when it pepped up and some were even singing along even if they didn’t know the lyrics. But Cas did and was off tone but he didn’t care as he continued the song. Ash had joined them again and was laughing at the foolishness of the words along with Jo who was attempting to sing too. When the song finally ended, the crowd cheered, even if they were too drunk to know what they were cheering for.
“You’re a writer?”
“He is, but I’m not interested.” The biggest fucking lie.
It was a quarter past two that night, or was it morning, and Cas was standing outside Dean’s apartment door. It was Saturday so that meant Dean had gone to the bar and struck out, so he had called his last resort. He had called for another late night booty call and like always Cas came running. If Cas had a little more self-respect, he’d have said no, he would’ve said that months ago, but that was who he was. He was so pathetically in love with Dean that he was willing to do anything for the man.
“Hell no. This is all you.”
Dean smirked. Charlie was his best friend and only wanted the best for him, the same went for her, but she didn’t have any tack. But to indulge her, he looked over. He could see a table of four guys, who were laughing at the one that was drenched with what was most likely beer. They were ribbing on him pretty hard, but one was silent, one just had a smile on his face watching everything. Dean smiled with him.
“What about you, Cas?” They looked at each other. “What’s your Christmas wish?”
“Once,” he then paused. “And I only tried once too.” He smirked. “Well, we’re idiots.”
“I’ve seen them before,” Ash admitted quietly. “They aren’t that good.”
“No thanks,” Charlie replied trying to flag down a bartender. She even started to wave her arms to get their attention. It didn’t work. Actually, they seemed to avoid them even more.
“Ok…ay?” That was awkward. “Well, I’ll see you around.”
“Dean?” The new voice asked. Gabriel came around the corner, just staring at Dean. “Oh, my god. No way. You’re Cas’s hot guy.”
“When you were engaging in intercourse, where you against a wall at any point?”
“You didn’t see him, so you don’t get an opinion,” Gabriel said before taking a sip of his beer.
was going to be a problem. Dean wasn’t a ‘talk’ kind of guy. He was under the strict belief that actions spoke louder than words. But for Cas, he’d be willing to try.
“Hey doc. I didn’t know you lived here. I’m on the third floor.” They lived on different floors, explaining why their paths never crossed.
Dean groaned. “Did Charlie talk to you?”
“And your parents?” Dean gave him a look as he aggressively shook the eggnog and vodka in a shaker. “Oh. I’m sorry.”
Cas didn’t like how Anna had said that, but he was just going to continue ignoring them.
“Fuck you,” he sneered back. “I ain’t queer.”
“Like hell I am, Jo. Now give me my fucking keys.”
“Hey,” he said with the same cocky smirk as the last time.
“No, I really don’t.”
“And that just proves my point,” Dean glared at the two guys. “Jo you can’t let him choose the music tonight.”
That night, Cas did see Dean’s bedroom ceiling. But that was just one of the many things he saw. He saw Dean’s bedsheets very closely, almost to the point he could figure out the thread count, he saw Dean’s body, he was able to touch every inch of it as well, and he even saw Dean’s dick, something he willingly worshiped. But most importantly, he looked at Dean’s eyes most of the night, the radiating green entranced Cas and showed every moment of pleasure that they both felt.
Another eye roll. “No, the ‘spot’.” He even used air quotes.
Back at the apartment, the sex was even better than the first time. He reveled in every little sound that fell from Cas’s mouth, trying to make more come out.
“It looks like we both got our wish.”
Looking over, they could see Anna making out with whoever she’d been talking to.
Dean went and grabbed it. “No, I’ve been charging it.” He looked at it and blushed. 23 missed calls and even more text messages. “It’s been on silent.”
“Do they do that?” Dean and Ash shrugged their shoulders. “Okay, and just so I know you’ll actually do it, if they don’t do requests, you get to pick the music we play when we’re cleaning.”
“No. Do you think I’m crazy or something? If I didn’t have lube I’d probably jack off with my spit if I had to.”
“Jo, no,” Dean protested. “Cas has shitty taste in music.”
“So does that mean he doesn’t get to control the music tonight?” Dean asked hopeful.
“Cas,” Balthazar chuckled, “what was his ceiling like?”
“Please,” Dean begged, stopping Cas from continuing, “I haven’t stopped thinking about you and I really need to do this.” He didn’t know why he said that, but it was out of his mouth before he could think. The following silence made him wonder what Cas was feeling, but he didn’t dare look.
“I can't keep coming over and sleeping with you.”
“Oh, I guess smallish? I don’t know what would be small or big in that sense.”
Dean finished the song that night, wanting to call someone but one person he really wanted to know, he didn’t know his number. So he contained his excitement and went to work the next day. And went back to the Roadhouse that night to see Cas and finally get his number. But he never showed. The next day he couldn’t make it out, but he went again that Sunday, again no Cas. He went every weekend, all weekend, going at different times just to see if he missed him, but he was never there. For a full month, he did that. Until he saw Cas again. The relief was out shadowed by the frustration and anger he felt. Like Cas had somehow ditched him. He didn’t even realize that he went over to Cas until he was right in front of him. He was surprised with himself and then when Cas answered in an angry tone, Dean couldn’t contain himself and practically demanded his phone. Putting his number in it and texting himself helped with his emotions, but when Cas stopped him and reprimanded him like a child it surprised him. He knows he growled his question at Cas but from his reaction, that’s not how it actually came out. But he had said that he would leave with him so that was all that mattered. And they had another fantastic night. The difference was that Dean had Cas’s number and could talk to him whenever he wanted. If he could get himself to say anything.
“Well, it’s red…”
“Okay, can you describe it for me?”
“Told you I haven’t finished it.”
Cas took a large breath in, resisting the urge to shiver from how his name sounded in Dean’s voice.
“I’ll give them away for free.”
For the next half hour, the band played a mix of rock songs and Christmas tones that excited the patrons and by the end, even Dean was enjoying himself. But it might’ve been the alcohol he continued to drink behind the bar. Eventually, Jo got on the stage and kicked everyone out, in a way that would make her mom very proud. When it was finally cleared out, the employees were able to clean before they all went home. Jo and Ash swept the floor that surprisingly didn’t have as much glass as it normally did. Cas was wiping down the tables and moving chairs onto them when he was done, and Dean was cleaning the bar’s counter and glasses that were still left to do. He even finished his last drink of the night, but he had one more with Cas before they could go home.
“No, it doesn’t appear to be anything wrong. I recommend lotioning the affected area and refrain from sexual activities for a week.”
“Please remove your pants. I’ll need to examine you.” He gave another sigh as he went and grabbed a pair of gloves. Without a further ado, Dean dropped trou yet again. Still looking forward as the guy handled him again. “May I ask a question?”
“You’ll get something for us then. And then we’ll get to know each other. Like I could finally find out your last name.”
He rolled his eyes. “Okay, just be safe.” He closed the door and left.
“It’s ‘cause you don’t have any leather on.” Someone informed them.
Out of desperation, he asked his friends which proved to be just as useless as he figured it would be. The guys he worked out with gave terrible suggestions, things that only a half brained idiot would think worked. Maybe that was why they suggested them. Even talking to Charlie was pointless when she said she could find anything about Castiel if she had his last name. Dean was going to use that as the backup plan. A Plan Z type of backup plan. His desperation went so far he even asked his younger brother about it. After Sam laughed for a good five minutes at Dean’s foolishness, he was the only one that actually gave good advice. To just go to Cas’ dorm room and force him to listen to as many apologies Dean felt was necessary. So that was why he was standing in front of Cas’ door debating whether to knock or not. He finally concluded to just get it over with when he heard someone walk into the building.
“What?” Dean asked moving away.
“I can’t do this anymore.”
“Yeah.”
“What?”
“Record it like I begged you to do with the first one. Dude, you’re really good. You should try to get a contract.”
Dean reached under the counter to get his drink and took a quick sip. It had warmed up a bit so the alcohol had a stronger taste than before. He winced at the taste, and then took a larger sip thinking it would be better the second time. At least with the alcohol in his system, the song was easier to listen to and not be reminded of his past.
Dean glared at her until she was swallowed by the crowd. When he couldn’t see her anymore, he pulled out his hidden glass and took another sip. Screw her. If Dean wanted to drink Christmas away, he was damn well going to.
“You’ll need a one-time injection and then I’ll prescribe you some antibiotics as well.”
“Dean, you don’t have to do this. We could go on a date, grab some dinner and—"
Dean shrugged as he put them away to wash later. “Tasted fine to me.”
Or he could just got downstairs and see if Cas could do an unscheduled appointment. He’d been meaning to see him again, and a pain in the dick was the perfect excuse. Grabbing a pair of underwear, Dean tried to wipe off the lube and sanitizer and before he could cuss even more then he had been, he put on a pair of sweats and quickly left his room. Taking the safer option of the elevator, he went down the two floors and hobbled his way to Cas’ dorm room.
“Two,” Cas corrected.
“You know what, I don’t need this shit,” he said marching past everyone and out the door.
“If you let me.” He hoped.
Cas raised an eyebrow but moved out of the way, gesturing for the other to enter. He watched Dean slowly move into the room.
“Do I have to kick some guys ass?”
“And why not?”
“You can say that. Can you not laugh or anything while I tell you what happened.” Cas opened his mouth but shut it as he nodded. “You know how I had gonorrhea? Well the bitch that gave it to me told everyone that
Cas was has put on his jacket and was wrapping a scarf around his neck. Noticing he was being watched, he looked up and gave Dean a small smile. “I was gonna walk home myself.” Dean nodded not really know what else to do. Eventually, Cas caught up to him and they started walking together. “So, what are you planning to do tomorrow?”
That was the first time he texted Cas. It took an hour to figure out what he wanted to put, deleting and retyping message after message until he accidentally pushed send.
“Mr. Winchester?” His angel asked looking at the folder. When he looked up, his professional demeanor shifted to one of irritation. “Dean,” he deadpanned.
The sound of the door opening could be heard. Turning around, Dean was about to give Jo, the most logical person who would follow him out, a piece of his mind. He was going to let her have it but turning around actually revealed Cas instead. The oncoming rant got stuck in his throat.
Dean dropped the dumbbells he’d been lifting. “Well, you can wear some if you want to feel pretty.” Three people held back Benny as he lunged towards Dean. They dragged him away so he could calm down. Dean shook his head with an amused smirk on his face. Benny was a homophobe that would beat up a guy for looking in his vicinity for too long without a second thought. Most of the group had fun pushing his buttons seeing how far they could get before he snapped, but they never went as far as Dean did. Dean mostly did it because he had a feeling that Benny was gay, or at least bi. And if that was the case he wanted to be the one to pop his cherry and welcome him to the LGBTQ community with a bang.
“No,” he laughed. “It’s a completely different song than the first one.” He then got embarrassed. “Do you want to hear it?” Sam eagerly nodded. “Okay,” he took a shaky breath in, “it’s not finished, so don’t judge it too harshly.” Sam rolled his eyes, as he followed his brother and sat across from him to hear the new song. When Dean started, Sam smiled that only grew as the song went on. And then it ended abruptly.
“My brother just got married so he wants to spend it with his new wife.”
“Well,” Gabe winced, “no guy’s perfect.”
“Then I guess you’ll get your answer tomorrow,” Dean chuckled.
“And have you called him?”
The guy stood up and took off his gloves. “Because your ‘spot’,” finger quotes again, “is nothing but lipstick.” He grabbed the folder and walked to the door. “I recommend washing your dick better.” He opened the door and slammed it shut.
“What is it this time, Dean?” The doctor asked when he stepped into the room. There wasn’t a hint of professionalism in his voice.
“No.”
“What’s it called?”
Cas smirked, much to Dean enjoyment. So he complied and dropped his pants again, turning around so his ass was facing the doctor. Hearing rubber gloves snapped onto place made Dean’s cock harden. But the needle going in killed the mood.
It was already twenty past nine and the band was still setting up. Each instrument was tuned or set up as if there was no rush. The singer was at the bar, talking with some girl who looked like she was loving the attention but knew at the end of the night she’d be going home alone. But the guy didn’t realize that. Poor guy. They were some local band that thought they were something just because they’d played other bars in town but all they were there to do was play until the place closed and to entertain the drunk patrons that were sticking around until they couldn’t anymore. And since they were already late, their performance time was dwindling.
“Guys, I just got out of a… thing. I’m really not looking for anything right now.”
Cas sighed walking forward. “And what makes you think I’ll leave?”
“Hello,” the wet guy said almost out of nowhere. Dean didn’t even realize Cas had been sitting with anyone. “My name’s Gabriel, but you can call me Gabe.” Cas looked as if he was about to murder his friend.
“Okay, I’ll try.” Cas raised an eyebrow. “I’m not great with words.”
Sam the ever supporting brother just laughed at Dean’s pain. “The sooner you do, the better you’ll be.”
“Dean Winchester?” A nurse called, yet again, breaking him from his reminiscing.
“Yes, I would, Dean.” He left with Dean before any of his friends could embarrass him.
He looked up from his phone, texting Charlie again, mostly to cuss her out that she knew Jo was into torturing balls and didn’t say anything. All he got in response was a bunch of crying laugher emojis. He was going to have to punch whenever he saw her next. With a pained sigh he got up and followed behind the nurse. If he wasn’t in so much pain he’d have asked if there were any other people that worked there. He was then led back to the seemly only room in the clinic, and he waited again.
Pushing Cas into the dorm, he followed in and closed the door.
“While you were engaging in intercourse—”
“…and how many drinks did you make for yourself?”
“You didn’t know.”
“Why do you think…”
“I’d be better if I could come— “Not the time. “Can we talk in your room?”
“Dean, are you okay?”
“Oh, this is because of work? I thought it was about that guy from last week.”
Dean laughed and drew Cas in for another kiss.
Dean smiled. “No.”
“Not funny, Dean. Anyway, Keystone isn’t shit.” Dean rolled his eyes. “Don’t knock it ‘til you try it, buddy.”
“Hey there, Cas. How are you?”
Well,
They were face to face. Cas reached up, caressing Dean’s cheek. “I won’t,” he leaned in but Dean stepped back. “What’s wrong?”
“It’s just one shot,” he argued.
“Have you felt a burning sensation when you urinate?”
“Why do you have my keys?”
“Okay,” Cas nodded. They shared another kiss. He was about to leave when he just had to ask a question. “Why didn’t I see you around?”
A frantic knock on his door caused him to stop. At first, he thought it was in his head since the knocking went with the beat of the song, but when he heard it again at a place that threw off the rhythm Dean stopped to see who it was. Opening the door he saw Sam, looking frustrated and then very annoyed.
With a sigh he walked over to the open door. He passed by a couple that looked terrified to be there, and a young guy that looked as if he was expecting the worst. All in all a cheery place. Following behind the nurse, Dean didn’t notice anything other than how her ass bounced with every step. If he wasn’t worried about a possible STI, he’d charm her out of her pants. Leading him into one of the examination rooms, she told him someone would be with him shortly. He asked if she’d come back and kiss it better, but his normal charm didn’t work in a clinic. She rolled her eyes and closed the door. That didn’t count as a rejection, at least not to him.
“Cas,” he panted out, “I’m—”
Dean laughed. Typical Charlie.
He nodded. How did he know that?
They both turned to the person that spoke. Charlie laughed seeing who it was.
, what are you doing here?”
“No, you idiot.” The doctor said leaving the room and slamming the door again.
“Are we still talking about the spot or my dick? Because if we’re talking about my dick, let me tell you it’s bigger than—”
“That was terrible,” he said giving the glass back.
“I can’t do that,” he practically screeched and then cleared his throat to talk normally. “I’m not doing that.”
Ash looked confused and smartly stayed silent.
“I have my ways,” Jo winked that them, and Dean started to get hard.
And then Dean was kissing him. Cas was surprised for a split second but then remembered that’s why he was there. Well, not to kiss, but to do more than that. He was trying not to get in his head, and Dean’s lips helped. The doors dinged before they opened, and Dean pulled back.
“Oh I don’t know, ‘cause you’re being a dick. And that’s saying something since you usually are.”
Dean looked at him in surprise. Balthazar and Anna were as well, never seeing their friend angry like that before. They then turned to Dean to see what he would do.
“We’ll get past that.” He sighed in relief. “I thought this was a one-sided thing. Good to know it’s not.”
It was cold outside, maybe snow weather cold but Dean really couldn’t tell. Not that he cared at the moment.
“I can’t do this.”
Dean looked up and saw the radiant smile on Cas’s face. He nodded again and grabbed his guitar. Taking a calming breath, he started, solely focusing on the guitar. And when he started singing, he faintly heard a gasp. Not wanting to stop to look at Cas, he continued so he could finish the song. The song he desperately wanted Cas to hear, and when he was he didn’t want to know the reaction he was getting. It was too embarrassing. But eventually, the song ended, and he had to look up.
“No, we’ve had sex. Dates mean going to dinner, or a movie, or getting coffee and just talking.”
The first was that his brother, Sam, had gotten married. True it wasn’t a bad thing, in fact, Dean was ecstatic for his baby bro for finding the one he wanted to spend the rest of his life with. And Jess, the woman his brother married, was the best. Dean would joke with her that he was the better Winchester, and sometimes Jess would agree, but there was no mistaking the love in her eyes when she looked at Sam. But it was going to be the first Christmas as a married couple so they wanted to spend it just the two of them, much to the annoyance of Dean. For years, it had been the brothers who spent the holidays together, it was usually just the two of them during Christmas time even before their father had passed.
And true to his word, Dean popped Benny’s cherry with a bang. A very long and loud one that took place in the shower stall. They were both amazed they weren’t kicked out. They figured someone must have enjoyed the show.
“Have you recently had sexual intercourse?” He asked as he was on his knees while moving Dean’s dick around to see the spot that brought him there.
Before Dean could respond, the line went dead. He didn’t like that doctor. There was no way in hell that was possible. Being away from home was for sowing his wild oats. And that was what he was gonna do. Grabbing his keys, he left to the closest bar so he could find someone to take his mind off of… Fuck that. He just wanted to get laid. He grabbed a drink as he scouted the room for a potential partner for the night. There were a few that he would go for but for some reason they didn’t strike his fancy. It was as if something was missing with each and every one of them. Growing frustrated with himself, he was about to leave when a woman walked up to him. She still wasn’t what he was looking for but at that point he’d sleep with anyone. Walking back to his dorm, she tried to get to know him, and under normal circumstances he would have divulged but he kept wondering what he was looking for.
“You want to see the ceiling of my bedroom?”
“Yeah,” Lucifer chuckled, “so much better.”
He took a deep breath. “I have a spot on my dick.”
“What song?” Gabe asked curious about the conversation.
Cas glared at Dean but didn’t answer, he just turned back to the stage as the band started to play. The music had a slow pace, with the singer starting very low and almost morose. It was familiar to Dean, but he couldn’t figure out where he’d heard it before. The lyrics weren’t the happiest, actually, they were really not at all. Maybe a little hopeful but almost not quite. He looked over at Cas raising his eyebrow at the weird choice of song. It wasn’t until the music changed to an Irish jig did a shiver go down Dean’s spine. He did know the song. He knew it perfectly well. For years, when his father was around during the holidays, he’d sing along to a song at all hours of the night and drink ‘til he passed out. Whenever either of the brothers heard the song, they knew nothing good could come from it.
“No, you don’t. Do you know how whiny they got about how much you were pining?”
Dean stopped which caused Cas to stop as well. “I’m not gonna do that, okay, man? You should spend it with your family.”
“Has Jo, Ash, and a bunch of other people more than willing to help.” Dean was about to say something else, but Sam stopped him before he could say anything. “And you don’t have to look after me any more Dean. Again, I’m not eight.”
Up the shaft, now touching the head. “You should shower to remove any—"
Jo smirked and hoisted the tray up, placing one of the shots in front of Dean. He looked at her in confusion. “The guy only ordered one. Take a shot and loosen up. It’s almost Christmas, Grinch.” She walked away but looked over her shoulder and gave Dean a wink.
“I can,” Jo lit up, “but,” then deflated again, “I get to request a song.”
Wow, they were stupid.
“Damnit, Dean,” Cas sighed. “I like you too.”
“But look at everyone,” he further lamented. A guy brushed up against him reaching for his drink and gave Dean a wink. “Did we have to come here on a theme night?”
“No, Dean. I’ve tried to get to know you.”
“Dean,” he interrupted for his own sanity. “I’m sure this is a fascinating story, but can you please disrobe and sit on the exam table.” Dean complied; the cold metal was soothing. The doctor put on gloves again, and pulled a rolling chair over to Dean to examine for any damage.
“What?” He looked around the group and noticed that, yeah, Ash and Jo were underage. “Oh, yeah I guess so. Well, Cas and I will do two then.”
“You might be surprised,” Cas winked and headed to the small stage. He talked to the band and they seemed to be excited at the request.
“I want to get to know you, Dean. I want to go on a date with you. But it seems like all you want from me is sex, which at first I was fine with, but I’m starting to fall for you. And I know I can’t because I don’t know anything about you.” It wasn’t happening again.
Cas couldn’t hide the smile on his face. The other laughed, except Anna who was completely confused.
“May I,” she asked holding out the strip. He nodded nonchalantly.
“We could always leave,” she was still trying to get someone’s attention. “At this point we’ll be lucky to
Still stunned that he had agreed, Cas followed him out. Looking at his friends before stepping out of the door, he saw them give him two thumbs up and encouraging smiles. God, he hated his friends. Continuing outside, he followed the guy, who Cas still didn’t know his name, to a slick black car. It was impressive and beautiful.
“Okay,
“I think I’m fucking hilarious.” He smirked.
“So you think you’re funny,” Benny sneered.
“Gabe? Yeah, I do. Not that I can stop him, but they seem happy together.”
“Please, you have the smile of a love-sick puppy. So was it the one I showed you?”
That stopped Dean in his tracks. Slowly turning around, he looked at the other man.
“What? I haven’t…” Jo just gave him a look. “One, okay?” A raised eyebrow. “Fine, two. Are you happy now?”
“How’d you do that?” Charlie gasped.
“So, nothing’s wrong?”
“You’re here,” he said almost like he was surprised.
going?”
They turned around and Dean saw his doctor leaving a dorm room.
“So what should I do, huh? Why shouldn’t I drink?”
“Jerk.”
“Dude,” Dean groaned, “nurse dude, you can’t be serious.”
Dean looked at the doctor in disbelief. “What could possibly be the good news?”
“What?” Dean asked, wanting to get back to his song.
‘Accidently’, he bumped into her, and then apologized for his foolishness. They continued talking, Dean wasn’t really surprised that he didn’t have to try as hard with Lisa as he normally had to. Within a few minutes they were on their way to Dean’s dorm, much to the delight of his rising cock. They chatted all the way, but he couldn’t say what they talked about, he was more interested in seeing her in even less clothes. He could picture her riding him, moaning as he went deeper into her. He had to discreetly adjust himself a few times along the way. The moment Dean closed his door and turned around, Lisa was on her knees pulling his shorts and jock down around his ankles. They spent a few hours in different positions until both were sweaty and gasping for breath. Eventually, Lisa left with her hair a mess and a grin on her face. Dean said he would call her, but they both knew that wouldn’t happen. They had a fun time and that was all it was.
“Are you okay?”
And waited.
“What?”
“Let me blow you and then we’ll be even.”
Jo was twirling his ring of keys on her index finger. “Looking for these?”
“Typical Gabriel.”
“Don’t really care what’s healthy or not right now.”
Fuck.
“I’m sorry,” he said and then continued in a husky voice. “I would really love to get you home, Castiel.”
“The test came back. You have gonorrhea.”
“Hello,” Gabriel said like the little monster that he was. The new voice seemed to shake Dean for a moment, but he quickly recovered. “My name’s Gabriel, but you can call me Gabe.” Cas hoped that was the end of that, but he knew Gabe so there was going to be about fifteen more inappropriate things said. So Cas stopped that by stomping on Gabe’s foot.
“Yes.”
“You were the one that sang that other song.” Dean nodded. “And you wrote it too.” Another nod. Cas didn’t say anything else but took the guitar out of Dean’s grasp and placed it gently down. Dean was confused as to what Cas was doing until he had a lapful of Cas who was kissing him hard. “That was amazing.” Dean didn’t know if Cas was talking about the song or the kiss, but at that moment he didn’t care. “Okay, so this is how it’s going to go,” Dean smirked and how confident Cas was. “We’re going to have sex, and after we’re going to go to sleep.”
“Really?” Cas smiled. “How do you know it?”
And after it was done, Cas left. It wasn’t like he wanted to, but Dean wasn’t as confident as he had been earlier. They got dressed, Dean less so since he lived there, and then waited for Cas at the door.
“Why would you think that? Did he inform you of having an STI?”
Dean didn’t have an active social life any longer. True, he was still fighting the stigma of having an STI, but that didn’t bother him. What bothered him was that no matter how hard he tried, Castiel wouldn’t have anything to do with him. No matter how many times he apologized for the unwanted facial. Not that he was ever able to say that. The first time he pretended to have another STI, but his luck finally ran out when he met one of the other doctors that also worked at the clinic. She really needed to work on her bedside manner. But the good news was he was still clean, not having sex with anyone other than his hand will help. The next time, he asked the nurse about him, not that she provided any information. But going to the clinic for the fifth time in a week drew some questions, so Dean had to stop.
“That’s not what I asked, Dean.”
Jo rolled her eyes. “Do I really have to spell it out for you?” From the blank face on Dean’s face, she rolled her eyes again. “Spend the day with Cas, you big idiot.”
“So if I go back there, I won’t see a glass filled that’s shouldn’t be there?”
“Just the shots you’ve seen me take.”
“Sam?”
“Do you want to meet him or not?” Sam got up to answer the door.
A few moments later, they pulled into a parking spot next to an apartment building. Dean turned off the car, cutting the song that was playing off, and got out. Cas followed again, only slightly getting caught on the seatbelt. Then he had to run up to catch up with Dean, who was already at the building's door. He was holding it open like a gentleman and followed inside. Again he took the lead to the elevator. He hit the down button, which confused Cas. They were on the ground floor. Was their more underground.
Dean had had a number of flings in his life, but that’s all they were: flings. At least to them they were, but to Dean, it was another heartbreak. Each one of them told him how wonderful he was, but they never got to know him. They’d just have sex with him for a time and then never call again. Sometimes, he even saw them with someone else, either on a date or already in a relationship.
“Yeah, right.”
“Then get up there and introduce the band yourself,” she huffed.
“I can’t. I could never do a presentation at school. The one time I did I threw up in front of everyone.”
“Your Christmas wish. The one thing you really want to come true.”
“All day?”
After that night, Cas believed he’d never see Dean again. A one night stand, that was all it was. Throughout the week, they had badgered Cas about his ‘mystery man’. Anna, who had been making out while everything happened wanted every detail, even demanding a picture of Dean. At that point, he blocked her number for the rest of the day. That next weekend, he met up with his friends again. The subject was still on Dean, even though none of them knew his name, Cas didn’t kiss and tell.
“Here you go, Dean. If you have any questions, just come back in and someone will be able to help.” He was about to leave but turned around. “And just remember, Dean, wrap it before you tap it.” He said with a wink then left the room.
“Hi,” Cas said with a hell of a lot more confidence than before.
“You’re gonna have to stay around all night if we get service
“So, why were you so nice to Cas?” Jo asked still trying to get the mental image of her mom out of her head.
During the next week, Cas received the first text. It only contained two words:
The crowd gave halfhearted applause as Cas got off the stage and raced back to the bar.
And since his brother was going to be spending the holiday in married bliss (he really didn’t want to know if that was how Sam was going to be spending Christmas because…Ew), Dean had planned to just spend the day with his ‘Uncle’ Bobby, the man who practically raised the Winchester boys after John left one too many times. But Bobby was going on a cruise. Dean was mystified that Bobby knew what a cruise entailed much less willing to go on one. Then he learned he was going on the cruise with his friend, and Dean’s boss Ellen, everything started to make sense.
“I’m sorry, Cas.”
“Ellen—”
“You’re a writer?”
“Yeah, that’s what I want too.” He poured the drinks into their respected glasses and placed them on Jo’s tray. “So, why aren’t you with your mom on her cruise?”
“What?” Dean asked pulling away. He could feel his heart start to break.
. He needed to go to the hospital. No, how was he going to explain that to a doc—
“Holy fuck,” Cas muttered as he saw Dean make his way to the table.
“I’ll take the cap,” Charlie said quickly and then snapping it out of her hands.
“You sure? I won’t think any differently of you.” He looked around at the group who were trying not to laugh. “They might, but I won’t.”
Nothing else could be said. Dean was lost in the bliss as he came, pumping his hips forward into Castiel’s lax hand. When he finally came down, he looked down and saw the doctor’s face covered in his cum.
Still wiping the cum from his face, Cas didn’t say anything. Dean pulled up his pants and slinked out.
“Uh-oh,” Charlie smirked and breaking the moment he was having, “Dean is in love again.”
“Which one was it?”
“No, I’m not. I was out at the bar and I met a friend of a friend. Well, after today she won’t be my friend anymore. I mean, who doesn’t tell a guy that the woman he’s hooking up with is into CBT. You know what that is, right?” The doctor’s left eye twitched. “So she had me tied up and then—”
“Where are
Lucifer smirked at the comment, knowing that Anna didn’t hear it. She was too focused on…
“Or better yet,” Balthazar smirked, “ask to see the ceiling of his room.”
“You want to know just as much as us, Luci.”
“What’s your Christmas wish, Dean?” He asked to continue the conversation.
“If that’s going to be your attitude about it, I just might.”
“Why didn’t any of you take a picture for me?” She lamented. “I get lucky one weekend and Cas gets some hot guy.”
Dean doesn’t remember much of the night other than he
“I’m still going to be sticky.” He argued
“The drink, Dean,” she sighed. Wasn’t it bad enough to be working on Christmas Eve without all the corny jokes that people said when ordering their drinks?
“You’re slightly swollen, but everything seems to be fine. I would recommend to ice your testicles when you get home for as long as you can handle and not engage in any BDSM for the time being.” He stood up and removed his gloves. “But I’ve seen what you do with my suggestions, so live long and prosper.” He started to leave but was stopped by a hand on his wrist.
“My name,” he then got in and closed the door.
Cas pulled his shirt off and wiped his face. “I don’t care. Please leave or I’ll call someone to make you leave.”
“Well, good for you.”
“I’m not.”
“My father,” he muttered.
had affected him so much. “You sure?”
“Please be alone, please be alone, please be alone,” Dean mumbled as he knocked on the door. He groaned was the door opened.
“You are twenty time hotter now.”
“Perform it like you did the last one.”
“Of course I want to meet him,” Dean then yelled, “just so I can warn him about your snoring.”
“And blowing me is going to let you do that?”
He looked up, his eyes an icy blue. “Get out, Dean. Get the hell out and never come back.”
“Hey, it’s you again.”
The group turned to see what caused that reaction from Anna. And there he was, Dean, leaning on the bar talking to one of the waitresses. They were laughing at something. A small part of Cas was jealous but then crushed that emotion down with the fact that Dean was a one night stand.
“Yeah, I’m sure you were.”
“You…wrote a song?” Dean nodded. “Can I hear it?”
Cas looked at his uninvited guest skeptically, but then gave a sigh. “Pull down your pants.” Without a second thought, Dean did. Before his life went to shit, being naked from the waist down was a common occurrence. He would’ve commented on it if his dick didn’t feel like someone was pushing pins into it. “Well, you penis is still functional, you still have an erection.” The touch of Cas’ hand on his junk did something weird to Dean. It still hurt but he was getting even more excited? “I can already tell you have a bad reaction to the sanitizer.”
Dean nodded, trying not to remember how at one point he had Benny’s legs around his waist while he fucked him against the stall’s wall.
“Oh, shut up.” Gabe sulked off towards the bar. The group chuckled as they watched him try yet again, hopefully with a less disastrous conclusion. But to everyone’s surprise, he just went and grabbed more napkins. “You have an admirer, Cassie,” he said throwing the stack onto the table.
Dean nodded.
“It’s Castiel and I live here,” he then noticed her companion. “Dean?”
“What did you think, Dean?” Cas asked.
Castiel looked at the pair with a skeptical expression on his face. “Yes, I do. Dean, I must warn you—”
“Another point for Team Gay.” Jo rolled her eyes at Charlie’s comment. “So anyone catch your eye?”
And there was something good came out of it. Not for Dean, but for his brother Sam. For the past two months there wasn’t any scarring new stories that Sam wished there was a way to wash his brain.
He moved his hand down the shaft. “But I don’t see anything of concern.”
Dean turned around sharply, gearing up to tell this, yes hot, doctor and tell him off. And maybe explain why he didn’t wear condoms, but it all died when he looked down at the doctor. Cas was staring up with his blue eyes that stunned Dean. His dick started to rise again. Dean would’ve loved for Cas to reach out and grab him, but instead the doctor moved back successfully ruining the moment. Even though the moment had passed, that still didn’t stop him from getting harder.
There are things that brothers should never know about each other. At the moment, Sam was wishing he was an only child. That would be better than listening to his brother talk about his latest sexcapades. Since Dean had left, once a month Sam had to endure his brother going into explicit detail of everything he’d done since the last call. He had to listen to that time at the orgy in the locker room, the identical twins that shared everything, and that girl who shot Ping-Pong balls out of a very unsanitary place. At the moment, he was listening about the dominatrix that did a number on his brother’s balls. And then Dean started talking about a doctor. Sam was waiting for the other shoe to drop, maybe something about screwing on an exam table, or using stirrups in a way that weren’t appropriate. But that didn’t happen. His brother
Cas tried not to smile as he stood up. Unbuckling his belt, he watched Dean lick his lips. Unfastening his button and lowering his zipper, Dean straightened his posture on his knees. Giving a sigh as he put his thumbs past the elastic of his briefs and shoving his undies and pants down in one go. Dean was in awe when he finally got to see Cas naked, at least from the waist down. He licked his lips again staring at Cas’ dick. It was already half hard, and it wasn’t very long, maybe about 5 inches when he would be fully hard, but thicker than Dean’s was. It was a thing of beauty to Dean. Gently grasping it, he heard Cas gasp as he gave a lick. That was a sound he was going to love hearing again. Putting it into his mouth, Dean hummed getting an even better taste then that lick. He wanted more. And he was going to take it. Moving forward, Dean was able to take Cas all the way in, not having much of a problem, and hearing Cas moan. Now
Cas smirked and grabbed Dean’s hand. “To walk home hand in hand with you.”
“Are those his?”
“That’s better,” he was still trying to keep that shiver at bay, “and yes, I’d really like to go home with you.”
Dean had lifted the shirt to his underarms and was trying to get Cas to take it off.
“Well?”
“That was…” Cas gasped.
“Maybe it’s because you didn’t take no for an answer the
Dean didn’t know how to respond while someone was grabbing him. “Yeah,” he squeaked out staring straight ahead.
After telling his friends about the ‘lipstick incident’, as he called it, they made fun of him like the proper friends they were. But after a week, Dean was getting tired of it. It was funny at first, he’d laugh along with them, but that quickly got old.
“It looks like you got your wish,” Cas said looking up.
“Stop mopping,” Jo said slamming his bottle of beer in the counter.
“Jo, I’m working. Do you really think I’d do that?”
“So, since Ellen isn’t here, who introduces the band?” Ash asked.
“I can’t do this anymore.”
“Novak. Do you have a younger brother?”
“What’s that’s supposed to mean?”
From that point on, they continued their night, just with Jo, who proved to be a great companion. Throughout the night she hung around Dean, playing with the collar, and saying things about how it was his color and that maybe he should keep it and wear it again. He loved the attention, not paying much to what Jo was saying. Every so often, Charlie would leave the couple and get more drinks switching Jo and Dean’s drinks from the hard stuff to water and soda without Dean realizing. When he did, Jo persuaded him that if he was sober by the end of the night, she would reward him for being a ‘good boy’. So, when it
“Not my dick this time.”
“Well, you won’t be doing that until tomorrow,” Cas winked.
Jo gave a critical eye to the bartender but didn’t say anything to him. “C’mon, guys,” she told the other two, “let’s see if anyone needs refills.” Ash and Cas nodded, grabbed their trays, and left leaving Jo and Dean behind. “How much have you had to drink tonight?”
But it didn’t start that way. No, their arrangement or Cas’s feelings came later. Seven months before, Castiel Novak didn’t even know who Dean whatever-his-last-name-was was.
“Can you—” Cas started, but was interrupted by another kiss and then a door to the face. “—take me back?” He ended in a whisper.
“Yeah,” Cas heard himself say. What the hell did he just say? That wasn’t him, that was Gabe. When did he become Gabriel?
fast.”
“Yeah, well at least I’m doing better than Anna,” he tossed the last of their napkins into the pile.
It was a week after midterms, so that meant it had almost been two months since Dean had sex. So that meant after his gonorrhea treatment was finished, and he was able to have sex again, he didn’t. Whenever he went out and tried to hookup with someone, he’d always be turned down. At first he thought it was a fluke, he was just having an off night, but then it happened again, and again, and again. When he asked his friends about it, no one said anything, but they looked as if they knew exactly why. He even asked Benny, who instead of answering took a swing at Dean. He reiterated that no one could find out what they did. That time, it worked better since they weren’t naked and cum wasn’t dripping out of Benny’s ass. It wasn’t until he saw Charlie that he found out. As it turned out, Donna told everyone that she got gonorrhea from him, not the other way around. After that, that information spread like wildfire around campus. Dean was pissed, rightfully so, and when he tried to confront Donna it was like she disappeared. But if that was the case, how did he get a STI?
“Hi,” Cas said, his deep voice sending shivers down Dean’s body.
“And how do you know that?”
“Siblings?”
The sound of glass breaking stopped the start of their argument. No one was getting rowdy but there were drunk people around and drunk people did stupid things.
“I wonder how funny you’d be when I pound your pretty face in.”
Dean rolled his eyes. “Sam, you know I can’t.”
“Because my dick’s tender.”
“C’mon, you’re great at talking in front of a crowd.”
“I’m fine,” he tried to make it sound authentic. The look of concern didn’t go away but Cas turned back to the stage.
“You know, Benny,” Dean started, “you talk about my dick a lot. Do you want to be the next in line to get a taste?” He smirked knowing just how to get under Benny’s skin.
“Looks like they’re going to do it,” Jo said.
Dean moved down, kissing Cas’s neck and moving to his collarbone.
“You sure that isn’t too much weight, Dean?” Benny asked already snickering over the upcoming punchline. “Don’t want you to see ‘spots’.” The others laughed, but Dean rolled his eyes. If they were going to make fun of him, couldn’t they be creative? Well, looking at the group, it wouldn’t surprise him if he was the only one who was passing his classes. It might be with C’s but at least he was passing.
“Or the fact that his girlfriend was right next to him?” Lucifer snarked.
It was difficult for Dean to swallow the spit that had collected in his mouth. He did so anyway. Could he finally admit out loud something he’d been dying to say?
“My longer relationships have been with guys,” Dean mused.
“Donna?” A voice asked behind them.
Looking up, Benny’s eyes clearly showed his rage and if Dean let his grip slack for just a second it would’ve been over. But slowly, those same eyes filled with lust. Eventually, he whispered the magic word, much to Dean’s joy.
“Let’s get to my place before we do anything else,” Dean said tugging Cas, who was dazed from that kiss, out onto the hallway. Cas didn’t even realize they’d gotten to the apartment until he was kissed again, being lead into the dark place. They continued to hold their lips together as Dean closed the door and took off his jacket. Dean then moved on to Cas, removing his jacket and shirt kissing alone his collarbone and up his chest when the shirt revealed more and more skin. Cas moaned grabbing onto Dean’s head forcing him back up to kiss again. Slowly leading the way to the bedroom, Dean continued the strip, both his own and Cas’s and then finally reaching their destination.
“I’ll try.”
Sam turned to his brother with a deeply concerned look on his face. “What did you expect I was gonna do when you haven’t answered your phone for days.” Days? That couldn’t be right. “Dean,” he said gently, “it’s Thursday. So yeah, days.”
That was how Dean was at the moment. He had queued up one of his resent favorite porno videos. It was about a young man getting a checkup from another young man dressed like a doctor. He didn’t know why he liked it so much, he’d never liked medical play before. But that video, and others like it, made him blow a lot faster than normal. He hadn’t seen either of the men fuck the other, let alone cum, and he was already shutting his laptop and wiping himself off. He was determined to see some actual action before his big finish. Pumping some lube into his hand, he pushed play and started slicking up his dick. Going slow at first he watched the doctor, the only way anyone would figure that out was because he wore a lab coat, tell his patient to disrobe. Going over the head and then back down as the patient got naked faster then any human should be able to and jumped back on the exam table. The doctor started his exam that made no sense since the guy came in for a sore throat. But Dean didn’t care about the story as he watched the doctor touch and tease his patient, saying something about a prostate exam. He resisted the urge to move faster so he added more lube to his hand. By the time the doctor had two fingers in his partner and his mouth on the patient’s cock, Dean though he was going to cum. No, he couldn’t yet. He wanted to see what happened next. Another pump of lube. The doctor was now naked too and there was a slight burning…
“You mean like getting to kiss you?”
Dean was looking around at the commotion from the table in confusion. “Cas,” he said getting the table to quiet down again, “would you like to get out of here?”
Dean jumped away from the door as if it was the one who yelled. “Jeez, Cas, warn a guy.” He said clenching his chest.
“Cas, can you—"
“Well I have good news and bad news.”
Throughout the drive, Dean wanted to grab Cas’s hand or kiss him, but he resisted. Even leading him to the elevator, Dean resisted the temptation. But inside the elevator, he couldn’t hold back and kissed him. God, that was a kiss. Dean almost didn’t even hear the elevator opening. But he did, and they carried on to his apartment and had the best sex Dean had ever had.
Dean knew how to deal with people like that, being raised by John Winchester there was an ever revolving door of douchebags that Dean and Sammy had to deal with. And there was only one surefire way to show who’s boss. Without a second thought, he grabbed Benny’s junk, clenching his fist. Benny gave a gasp and fell to his knees.
“What the hell was that?” Another person that Dean hadn’t noticed before cried.
That next weekend, he went back to the Roadhouse. It was uncommon for him to do that, but after the week he had, and his mind still stuck on Cas, he really needed a drink.
After that, every weekend he would get to the Roadhouse expecting to see Dean there, but their paths never crossed. At first, it annoyed him, then made him sad but then he accepted the fact that he’d never see Dean again. The worst thing about it was that every so often, he’d hear ‘Temporary Bliss’ at work. Eventually, he talked to the new guy, Sam, who told him he got the song from his older brother. After that, they started talking a lot more and even started hanging out outside of work. Then Cas did something stupid and introduced his friends to Sam. They were nice to him, and Gabe was as inappropriate as always, but his charm faltered when Sam started to flirt back. Everyone was amused that Gabriel had seemed to have met his match. They started dating after that, and so he had to listen to both Gabe and Sam talk and worry about the other all day long.
“Hit me was the bad news first.”
“Maybe they already know you’re going to order a shitty beer.”
“Cassie,” Donna warned herself.
“Dean, you’re not driving. I know for a fact you’ve had three shots…”
“Dean Winchester?” A nurse called breaking him from his reminiscing.
“What?”
“I don’t understand why he was so pissed,” Gabriel said as he tried to dry his shirt with bar napkins. It wasn’t working but he, again, tried.
“Bobby—”
“Cassie, what are you doing here?”
They both paused and gave a shutter. Not something either wanted to think about.
“Well, a few days ago I was fucking this dude,” the guy’s eyebrow rose, “and I think he gave me something.”
“Dean, I don’t think we should be drinking on the job.”
Of course he did. He wasn’t blind. The guys short dark blonde hair fit perfectly with his striking green eyes. And his dusting of freckles that Cas wanted to see how far down…
“It’s my dick.”
“It was,” Dean smirked. He licked his lips again, the last of Cas’ cum still on his tongue. “Can we go on that date now?”
“I wrote a song for you.” What the hell? Why’d he say that?
“Isn’t it?” He knelt down to be I level with Dean. “You don’t have to suck me off, Dean. It’s an interesting offer but—”
“No, but lighten up and let the poor boy do his job. I don’t want to have to mop up the puddle he’s gonna cause if you yell at him again.”
“Fine,” he sighed, “but you don’t get to laugh, okay?” Cas nodded. “To walk in the snow.” He took a breath in expecting Cas to say something, but when he didn’t Dean continued. “I love cold weather. It reminds me of my mom. Whenever it snowed, she would bundle Sammy and me in our warmest clothes and we’d play in the snow for hours. And when it got too cold, she’d take us back inside and make us all cocoa and we’d watch movies all night long bundled under this huge blanket she’d only pull out when it was just the three of us. Even when she got sick, she’d do that for us. The first snow after she died, I tried to keep the tradition alive for Sam. It was going great until it came to the cocoa part. I was 10 and I’d never used the stove before.” He laughed. “I got into so much trouble for that.” He remembered the yelling, the cussing, and eventually the slap across his face.
“Bullshit,” Gabe laughed. “Just go and ask him out.”
“I would say so. Can we go on a date and start this all over again?”
“Too far from family?”
“Ok…ay?” Cas said slowly. “Well, I’ll see you around.”
“I’m sorry. I didn’t catch that.”
“Good looking enough that you don’t want to just sleep with him?”
“And why is that?”
Fuck. Why did he do that? But to his amazement, Cas showed up. And the pattern of texting and having sex started. At first, Dean would try to have a nice night in with Cas, maybe cook for him or just watch a movie together, but each time they just have sex and Cas would leave. Eventually, he stopped and realized that all he was going to get from their relationship was sex, and slowly but surely Dean excepted his fate. If he couldn’t be in a relationship with Cas, at least he could spend time with him in bed.
was a sound he was going to love hearing again. Moving back, he eagerly went forward, feeling the full length in his mouth as he ran his tongue as he went back again. Feeling Cas’ hands on his head, Dean moved faster, wanting more to taste. Hearing Cas pant his name was sending him to another world. A world that Dean never wanted to leave. But with one final forward motion, Cas’ dick was as far back in Dean’s mouth that it could reach. The hands gripping his’s hair and the taste of Cas’ cum sent Dean over the edge himself. Hearing and feeling Cas regain himself, he moved back and was able to see how he had unraveled the doctor. Maybe that was how the porno ended. Who cared.
“Guy at the bar. He’s been looking at you for a while now.”
“Someone’s got to be here to make sure you yahoos don’t trash this place.” Dean raised an eyebrow not believing that bullshit. “Fine! I wasn’t invited. She said she wanted alone time.”
“So do I get some pills or something like that?”
alcohol. Why isn’t anyone paying attention to me?”
“HOLY FUCK!” Anna shouted causing many people to turn their way. Including Dean and the waitress. “Good job, Cas.”
The guys laughed harder.
"Cas you're gonna-- you gotta--”
The dinner went on and after a while, Dean had to practically push Sam and Gabe out of the door when they looked as if they were about to have sex in his kitchen. If he couldn’t, his brother sure as hell wasn’t going to.
“God, you should’ve heard Charlie. She’s just pissed she didn’t guess your type right.”
Without responding, Dean put the car in reverse, and they were off. For a split second, Cas panicked again but he was already in the car and had the seatbelt securely fastened, so what was he going to do? Jump out of a moving car? Cas just sat back and let the music play onto the next song. Dean started to drum his fingers on the steering wheel to the beat of the song. Cas smiled seeing the confident, and insanely hot, guy relax and not be so cocky. The next song started to play, and Dean reached over to change it, but Cas stopped him.
“We have gone on dates, Cas.”
“Four brothers and one sister.”
“Yeah, and what will I do after it’s done.”
“Ash?”
“C’mon, Cassie,” Balthazar pleaded for the tenth time that night, “you have to tell us something about that guy.”
“Can you believe these guys?” Jo asked watching the band screw around on and off the stage. “Why would Mom book them?”
don’t want you just for sex. That’s what
hot.”
“But you got his number?” Sam asked a few days later. They were having their weekly dinner together.
“What?!” His pants were around his waist, but he hadn’t buttoned them yet. “That can happen?”
His luck had come back.
Cas rolled his eyes and unlocked his door. “Leave Dean.”
“Castiel.” What the hell was wrong with him. He never told people his full name. “Cas, actually.” Dean looked over with a raised eyebrow. “I usually go by Cas. My name is kind of a mouthful for people. So it’s just—"
It had been two days later, and Dean was once again worried he had an STI. It would be his luck that Benny would have something and ‘neglect’ to tell anyone. Stupid fucker.
“Hey,” he said as smoothly as he could.
“Yeah, Cas,” Jo laughed, “where’d you ever hear that song anyway?”
“I know, right?” The guy chuckled.
“I knew that song you requested.”
“Don’t we both,” Dean said grabbing a few glasses.
“Well then, stop mopping,” Jo declared as she left to go back to work.
“What are you talking about?” He laughed.
“Well, you didn’t snap at him like you’ve done to everyone else. You know, Ash is terrified to get his table’s drinks.”
“Why?”
“What about the other two?” Dean really wanted the two shots.
“Hey, Cas.”
“Um…Dean?” Jo said. “Two of us can’t drink yet.”
“I don’t snore,” he yelled back as he opened the door.
Dean watched the doctor leave, with a smile on his face. He had a way to bother him away from the clinic. A tug on his hand brought him back. He smiled at Donna, finally knowing her name, and led her upstairs. It wasn’t a remarkable time. In actuality, he didn’t remember much from the night. They had sex, they got off, and she left. She didn’t even stay for a second round.
“I’ve been writing,” he said bashfully.
“Dean Winchester?” A nurse called breaking him from his reminiscing.
“But it’s working, isn’t it?”
was the one that gave it to
“Was it a female?”
The first time ever, Dean was going to be alone for Christmas. So he had a right to be pissed. At least sad about it, but he didn’t do sadness so that wasn’t going to happen. So all he could do was be mad. And go to work at the Roadhouse like nothing was wrong.
Looking discreetly towards the bar, he saw only one guy looking at him. His friends, on the other hand, weren’t so discreet.
“Okay, I get it.”
“No.”
After the potential possibility of his dick falling off, not knowing if the doctor was joking or not, Dean took it easy for the next few days. And only lasting three days, it was becoming a pain in the ass not to even jack off. To take his mind off his blue balls, he decided to go to the bar. But that proved to be stupid when he got there and saw all the patrons participating in the bar’s leather night. Guys in harnesses and jockstraps and girls in bralettes and assless chaps. He was dying.
“We tried. Is your phone dead?”
“Wait, I know this song.”
Dean stopped. That wasn’t right. At all. He slide his hand up and down again and the burning intensified. Staring at his slightly red dick, didn’t stop the pain. Looking at the lube, thinking that he might have jacked off too much and developed an allergy to it (That can happen, right?) he noticed to his horror that his lube had been knocked over and for who knows how long into his session, he’d been slathering his dick with hand sanitizer. He was going to kill Sam for warning him about the upcoming flu season and told him to get the sanitizer. What the
“C’mon, I know you’re nice to only me. Or at least you aren’t as much of a dick to me as you are to everyone else. That has to count for something, right?” He then became self-conscious. “Or did I read this whole thing wrong?”
“No, you’re thinking about Sam. I’m the better looking Winchester sibling, not the public speaker.”
“Free?” Jo gasped. “Wait, why do I care? Yeah, just do that.”
It was cold and he was pissed. What a way to spend Christmas Eve.
“I can’t do this.” Cas almost whispered.
They smiled at each other for a few moments, the brotherly love strong between them.
“You didn’t get his number?” Sam accused.
“Are you insane? How is giving me a blowjob going to equal all of this?”
“Dean?”
“Okay,” he went in for a kiss but was stopped.
Gabe’s eyes sparkled with mischief and he was about to say something, but Cas beat him to it.
“No one is that good looking,” Dean laughed. But his brother knew that laugh. It was his nervous laugh.
“Thanks, Jo. After that day I’ve had, I really need this.”
“Who?”
“Drink,” Dean mumbled.
“Not really. They were too engrossed in each other to talk to me.”
“Yeah, a coworker of mine played it before. It’s one of the only song I actually like that he plays.”
“Not swinging that way,” Lucifer was gaping too, “I can honestly say that that guy
“Cas’s hot guy?” Sam laughed.
Cas’s eyes widened. And he knew for a fact, his friends had the same look on their faces as he did. The guy didn’t falter and just continued to grin.
“HOLY FUCK!”
“Castiel,” Dean said effortlessly. It rolled off his tongue and made Cas shiver. “It suits you.” Before Cas could respond, even though he didn’t think he could, no one had ever said to him before, Dean turned on the car. And instead of the roar of the engine, the jumbled mess some people would call music blared. Dean immediately turned the volume down to something a normal person could tolerate. “Sorry ‘bout that. Do you like this song?”
“Oh, fuck!” Jo exclaimed. “I have to don’t I?” Dean chuckled. His latest drink was a little stronger than he intended. “Dean, can you do it?”
“Thanks, Dean,” Jo mocked as she placed her own tray on the counter.
That got Dean thinking. Cas was right. Cumming on a guy like that wasn’t something a simple apology could fix. But he knew of a way to make it equal.
It progressed the same way as the first time, without the introduction and the explanation of the elevator. That time, it was quieter until they were in Dean’s apartment where the moans quickly came (but the climax took much longer to reach). And after was exactly the same as well, where Cas left a little shaky legged.
The next time he saw Dean was a month later. It was a night where only Balthazar and Anna were there; Gabe on a date with Sam and Lucifer was stuck at work. They spotted each other quickly and Dean rushed to Cas like a man on a mission.
He smiled. “Yeah.”
Sam smirked. “Sure. But I’m telling Bobby you’ll be at work tomorrow.”
“Sorry, got distracted in your eyes.”
Thank God.
“Fuck yo— “He was interrupted as Dean shoved his smelly crotch into Benny’s mouth holding it him in place.
“Yes?”
“Go talk to him,” Gabe said nudging Cas’s shoulder.
“I don’t know, but it’s the only thing I can think of.” They stared at each other for what felt like hours, neither of them moving. That was until Cas started to laugh. “This isn’t a laughing matter, Cas.”
“Gabe,” Lucifer sighed not loving the fact that he was the only one of his friends that weren’t attracted to men, “don’t be lewd.”
“Then why do you think you have something?” He said through gritted teeth.
“Or, we can order in.”
“The wet one,” she then whispered, “he is totally coming this way.” Dean looked at the guy. He wasn’t bad, but the interesting one of his group was the silent one, who captured his attention again. “Well, was I right?”
“Mr. Winchester?” A deep voice called.
“Yeah, I know every Benny on my body, buddy. This is new.”
“Um…not really.” He must just like the song too.
“Okay,” Anna said frustrated, “can someone explain what the ceiling has to…Holy fuck.”
“Dean, you should follow your dream.”
“No. Anyway, during the act, it appears your penis scraped up against something and became irritated.”
Drumming his fingers on the table, Dean was getting bored. He hopped off and started wondering around the room. He started opening drawers and cabinets seeing what interesting things were hidden. Not much was, other than the usual things like tongue depressors and cotton swabs. There wasn’t anything interesting probably, so people don’t steal. He took a cotton ball just because he could. Still looking through things, he heard the door open.
Dean just looked at him with a blank expression that actually spoke volumes. From the little that Cas knew of Dean’s parents, he knew more about his mother since Dean liked to talk about her, but what he did know was that John Winchester was not a pleasant man to live with. Even before the death of his wife, Mary, John was still a tough person to be around. The drinking and abandonment were the least of Dean and Sam’s upbringing. “I’m sorry,” Cas said remorsefully.
“Castiel is the only one who remained pure at heart,” he explained, patiently, he hoped.
It occurred to Castiel that he had probably known all along that the Empty was what Dean would call a control freak, but while in the past any change to its environment had enkindled black rage, now it seemed too overwhelmed by this unfurling strangeness to object. It moved in a slow daze to a drift of bluebells snaking through a rise of growing trees. “What’s that smell?”
“Murky as the Empty?”
“He fell in love with a human,” the angels returned.
“Rowena is the right person to run hell,” he said firmly.
“A drop of snow?”
(He had read all of Shakespeare when he had read everything else, but he was now going back and re-reading it, not, as far as he could manage, as an omniscient deity, who understood every line, and could see it being written, but as the college student Jack could have been, grappling with it, being shocked by the way a line of verse from centuries past could reach out and take him by the heart.)
“What is it?”
Castiel made to object, because Jack was in a dangerous place, and, besides, there were bears, and then saw the logic of his argument. “I suppose that’s reasonable.”
“I’m awake.”
Jack gave him a mild, fond look. “I think, as an omniscient deity, that I can do what I like.”
He and Castiel were communing by something almost like angel radio, more like celestial whispers, because Castiel said they should try not to disturb the others who were sleeping. (Into Jack’s mind came images of the children of selkies singing into seashells so that their mothers might hear them in the depths of the sea; of ragged children with tin cans and string; of men in foxholes connected by thin silver wires that snaked through the shell-coughed mud. History was his library now, and even though he had read it all, there were chapters that had been more vivid than others. Some that he wanted to revisit; others even he could barely look at without a shudder.) Being Castiel, he had said it in the kind of stage-whisper that carried like a hailstorm and made the Empty thrash and writhe like a seethe of black treacle and Jack close his eyes and picture them in a child’s storybook, the great heaving wrath of the Empty wanting to crash down on an oblivious tiny, trench-coated Castiel and he, sternly, with a hand outstretched, keeping it at bay.
Dean had been accused of contaminating and corrupting him with his touch and now he was afraid that he was altering the Empty in the way that, according to quantum mechanics, a system could be disrupted merely by being observed. Of course, quantum mechanics was merely a clumsy humanoid attempt to replicate the same celestial mechanics that ordered non-interference with God’s plan; by which heavenly law he had lived the majority of the millennia of life before what his brethren called the Winchester Event.
“Good,” Jack said. “Dean has a strange talent for not knowing how much he’s loved.”
The answer was yes, and no, and mostly no, but with some yes mixed in with it, like a rogue thread, which was fitting, because even more than Sam, Dean had always been a rogue thread in the celestial tapestry. Then Castiel rhapsodized about Dean and it was beautiful, poetry, it shimmered like lotus flowers on silky blue waters and Jack felt the thrill of it ripple through him, and he realized that it was perfectly all right to be blinded by love, that that feeling he had for these flawed beings who had raised him, which was utterly untainted by his awareness of their flaws, was the way Castiel saw Dean. It wasn’t that Castiel didn’t know, almost as well as Sam did, that Dean had strange tastes and a restricted palate, it was that he did not see them as failings, only as part of the miraculous whole that was Dean. Whom he also, on occasion, thought was an ass-butt.
“What are they?” the Empty demanded, pointing into the trees but not anything like as aghast as Castiel might have expected.
More than a decade ago, that had surprised Castiel, the angel, who knew nothing about humans; because he had known from the first touch that Dean had never belonged in hell.
She buries her face harder.
“Is everything alright?” Adra hesitates, then props herself on her forearms and leans towards him.
sign they hang on the garden's back gate.
"Hey!" He and Sam say at the same time.
She looks around at the bare plaster walls and says, not for the first time, "We gotta get a flatscreen in here."
It's Jo's turn to go wide-eyed, shaking her head, "Um, no thanks. I'm not really doing much of that these days. But um, I'll let you know if I do?"
“If these are what I think they are,” She whispers, leaning closer, “I recommend you be discreet.”
A few feet away a crowbar rests on the ground. He picks it up and holds it in both hands. The hood of the Impala is smooth, glittering in the late afternoon light. He lifts his arms up and swings down, swings down, swings down.
She shakes her head, “I dunno. I left before I could find out.”
She raises her eyebrows, “Oh, Cas too?”
Without missing a beat, Cas says, "Yes, I need it for ritual purposes."
"So you're like, a professional dessert reviewer? Any other notes, besides the apple pie?"
In his pocket is a folded up piece of printer paper; He had jolted awake in the middle of the night and vomited up his speech onto his keyboard, knowing if he didn't get it out it then would be lost forever. He couldn't do that to Castiel. He had to say something.
John takes a long drink, a self-satisfied glint in his eyes, and tosses it over. Dean catches it with one hand.
The goblins race across the field, weapons drawn. Dean looks to Charlie, lets out a cheer, and starts running. His kingdom follows behind.
"Yeah, right," He ruffles her hair and she swats him away.
His legs work now.
“Ash Harvelle is your fraternity brother?” He asks when he recovers.
"Hey, I'm your idiot."
“It's fine,” He says, “I don’t have any pressing matters.”
“Thank you, they were a gift from Dean.”
Tears are dripping down her face now. She takes a minute to collect herself, wiping her eyes with the back of her hand. “I... I'll miss him, you know?”
“And?”
"Well, c'mon Rocketman, let's get inside. It's fucking cold out."
Oh fuck, that's right. It's November 2nd,, that's why his stomach hurts.
“I... Can't fault you for helping a friend,” He admits.
“Thank you, Dean,” Ash says.
“Uh,” He says, “I was dropping off Jo, you know Jo Harvelle?” He jerks his thumb behind him, “She lives in the townhouses over there.”
She blinks, and a slow smile spreads across her face.
While they set the table, Sam and Dean bicker about who got to sit at the head of the table last time. Dean loses rock paper scissors and shuffles in next to Cas with a glare at his baby brother. He needs to start picking something other than scissors. Jo and Ellen bicker about where Jo's applied to college and whether or not it's too late to get that music scholarship. Cas, Jess, and Ash sit back and watch, amused.
Novak flips back a couple pages, "The blueberry was good, but it could use a little acidity to give it more depth of flavor. I recommend lemon juice."
Dean grimaces, “He started feeling nauseous, so he's hiding out in the bathroom.”
Castiel breathes hard. He doesn't look Dean in the eye. Connard.
He shifts in his seat.
“Dean...” She wrinkles her nose.
When he doesn't speak for a moment, she continues, “Castiel, you know object permanence?”
“What is it, Castiel?”
No one is there. He blinks back tears. Idiot. Connard. Then he sees it. The vegetable plot is covered in a thick black mold. All the vegetables are dead.
Ruby shoves off the wall.
Castiel looks away. Dean doesn't get it. Cas has to do it himself, he has to. If he doesn't, she'll-- Oh.
At the end of one letter, Dean looks up. "Were you and her like... dating?"
"Why do I have to do it?"
“Woah, hey, please don't murder my – my Castiel,” Dean stage-whispers, “I happen to like him.”
"I'll say." She gives him a small smile. She's cute, pale with dark hair. She pats his arm, "Well, nothing's broken, so that's good, just be careful when you lie down for a couple days. Ice it if it hurts.”
Eventually Bobby gets tired of him feeling sorry for himself and smacks his knee with the newspaper.
Adra nods once and gets up. They can leave their things with no problem, apparently. Dean swallows and follows the woman out. She makes small talk with the nurses at the check in, who's hip has been much better since her replacement surgery. Adra shows him down the hall to the coldest water fountain, and at the very end is a window overlooking the highway. Cars whizz by, little specks on far-away earth, blissfully unaware of everything going on behind these walls.
Good enough. He finds some and puts it on.
Before turning onto the main road, Dean tosses him a candy bar, “Uh, thanks. For bein' a good sport.”
(SPOILER WARNING)
He hates her for leaving, almost as much as he loves her in spite of it.
“This date. It's been nice,” He says through a slow smile.
It's disconcerting. First, there's a long wooden box surrounded by flowers. Then, there's Castiel, lying still. He's got rosy cheeks and his face is calm, not pinched tight with pain. His tie is flipped the wrong way around, and Dean goes to flip it back around. It's disconcerting the way he could be sleeping. But...
John knocks a pile over, scattering the pages everywhere, "Now look what you did. I knew where everything was before."
And with that, all the light has left the room. Dean's chest gets tight. Missouri puts a hand on his knee and squeezes.
"Uh. It's a Vulcan kiss. Like Sarek and Amanda do."
Kevin grimaces, “Nervous.”
“Sorry,” Dean says to her. He leans towards Castiel and drops his voice, “Dude. Holy shit. How do you know that?”
He takes a deep breath.
“Amen,” Dean mutters under his breath.
Sam is half-hidden behind his brother, stealing glances at Castiel like looking too long might hurt him somehow.
He's earnest, that's a good word for it. She can see why Dean likes him. "Hey, we close at 9, but you're welcome to stay if you want to help us clean up."
She pinches the bridge of her nose, “Look, dude, I appreciate you doing that for me, but I still think you should see your family.”
Castiel opens his mouth, but he is interrupted by a cough, and a cough, and a cough. Eventually, he gives Sam a mournful look.
Anna grins, “I'm glad you like it.”
“Hello, my boy,” Adra says, coming over and putting her hand to his cheek.
Mom touches her cheek and smiles, "Atta girl."
“Am not. If you don't wanna clean it, you can keep him in your room like Dad told you to.”
Still, the question makes Cas' heart shoot up into his throat.
“How's my favorite patient this morning?” Meg asks, checking his vitals.
. A journalist will come by and take photos of the garden for a magazine. Dean and Adra will stand together by the fountain and try not to cry.
They don't say anything else. The longer the silence stretches on, the more nervous Dean gets. What was he thinking? He doesn't even know if Cas likes him like that, and he just kissed him out of nowhere. Fuck. He's probably just waiting for the right time to tell him off, to say he never wants to see him again. Fucking awesome. Great. Way to go, Winchester, ruining like, the best friendship you've ever had. You stupid motherfucker.
