Sherlock pulled out his phone and opened up Google maps. He typed in Brown's address and zoomed out. "There are far too many parks to be searched by foot." He glared at the device then turned the screen off.
"Good that's...good."
John came closer to him and transferred the baby into Sherlock's arms. "As much as I want you to interrogate him so you can get a few punches in, I have to agree because I don't have the money to bail you out."
John was interrupted by some chick saying :"Can I ahve some fchips?
"No, he wouldn't right now. I suspect he's going to lay low in a cheap hotel for a few days if he has enough cash. He wouldn't use a card because we can trace that."
"How are you determining which are actual overdoses and which are murders?" Sherlock asked.
Did the other person know they were distracted, focusing only on Brown? Did he know they knew the order of kills? There were too many unknowns, all of which leading John to think they were too late. He wanted to be hopeful, but he had a sick feeling in his stomach saying otherwise.
"Where's yours?"
About twenty minutes later, and to their relief, Emmett answered the door of his cheap flat. "Mr. Holmes? What uh-"
"Sherlock, please." He interrupted and walked through the doorway. "You're the next target."
Finally, an idea formed in Sherlock's head. Whenever he heard John tossing around upstairs during a nightmare, he would play the violin to soothe him into better dreams. If it worked for John, why not this infant?
Emmett breathed a huge sigh of relief. "We're going to be okay baby girl." He brought her to his face and snuggled his nose against hers, letting the stress of the past few days dissipate.
Sherlock responded in kind and relasexed that yes, John did want him in this way an edvery way he want him.
~~~~~
John shrugged and tugged on his jacket. "Text Greg about the warrant on the way."
Sherlock grimaced, "Hop to it."
Of course he knew what John was thinking. John resigned himself to permanent maker of tea once more and stood up to head into the kitchen.
Sherlock hummed in response, and the two could finally sleep peacefully. You know, when Eleanor wasn't waking up at four in the morning.
John left him to go make another cup of tea. Sherlock probably didn't need another one, but it was an excuse to give him privacy to get in the tub.
All too soon Sherlock was clean on the only part that could kind of pass as platonic. John didn't even think about attempting to clean his body, that was a step too far. Even for them, right now, at that moment.
"Accurate. Take me tio the scene."
Alright, that's it folks. I'm sorry I don't have more, I really didn't want be
Sherlock adjusted his positioning and moved the bottle so she could drink from it. She latched easily and grasped her hands around the fingers closest to her. He couldn't help but smile down at her.
Sherlock's forehead creased in confusion, "This behavior is not characteristic of me, how could you possibly have guessed this?"
Sherlock's words about adoption don't reflect his actual views, he was just saying what he could to get the information he needed. (He thinks adoption is a great service, but that it does need a lot of improvement because too often kids are allowed to be with abusive guardians).
"I thought I was going to starve before it got here." He placed the plastic bags on the table and began removing styrofoam boxes from them. He didn't bother asking Sherlock to fetch the utensils so he got them himself and dug in.
They were pleased the elder woman seemed much less cold. "I'd love to." Connor introduced themself to the baby as if she were an adult, and Eleanor gave them a gummy smile in response.
"You're lucky you're an only child."
Sherlock blew out a long breath over the tea, pretending that his sigh was just to cool it down. After taking a sip and deliberating he spoke.
Sherlock scoffed and sat opposite John in his leather chair. "Hardly."
"OKay. UH.....You're really good at this game and it's really cool to watch and I'm going back to m post now bye.":
An insult in the highest degree. A word that Molly knew too well, seeing as when her body reached puberty, it was evident by the mark on her shoulder that she was impotent. For this reason, she hadn't been able to join her sisters in the Breeding Program, and had instead been considered for war service. Unfortunately, it became instantly apparent that though her heart had a great willingness to try, it was not nearly as strong as her brothers' and sisters'. She flinched at the loud sounds of bomb raid drills ringing in the air, whimpered at whips and cowered when the Humans came and roughly grabbed her chin and pulled at her shoulders like she was property to be handled. She only spat fire when in pain, and not out of aggression.
Looking up, the teenager found himself face-to-face with a rather peculiar figure. A teenager, probably around the same age as him, stood tall and angular amongst the line-Up. He had dark, curly hair the colour of midnight, and his pale skin seemed as ethereal as it was unsettling. More strange still, his eyes were a curious colour, not quite blue and not quite green. He stood with his head cocked slightly to the side with an impatient expression, his stare as piercing as it was cold. A deep blue scarf was wound about his neck, keeping the chill out.
His eyelids and his limbs felt heavy, as if they hadn’t been used for some time. Like dragging through wet concrete, the Dragon struggled to move. Sherlock grunted with the effort, belatedly noting that at some point he had shifted into his Human form. His eyes opened painstakingly, and as his vision focused, the sight of white walls greeted him. There was an itching in his right eye, an ache that wasn’t leaving. He pressed his ring finger to the sensation, trying to blink it away. Slowly, Sherlock sat up.
Seated on the bed, John and Sherlock found themselves rather curled about one another, like kittens in a basket seeking out warmth. Under normal circumstances, the level of intimacy would have perhaps unsettled John, as he was unused to such things without one of his Alters stepping in and taking over. Yet he felt comfortable, with Sherlock. Open. His head rested on the detective’s chest, and their joined fingers toyed idly with one another even as Sherlock’s eyes stared somewhere into the distance. His rumbling voice hummed vibrations against John’s ear, like the purr of some great cat. It was a rather soothing noise, if John were being honest with himself. “My mother’s first husband came from a richer line, purebloods and rahs destined to be in control of large companies and finances. As such, Mycroft and I were born in a lap of both luxury, and responsibility. We were cared for by our Nannies as much as our own mother, though Mummy even back then made it clear that we were loved and very much wanted. Still, she had her teaching job- mathematics and physics and whatnot- and so there were large stretches of time where my brother and I were left to our own devices.”
as of yet to
“Do you plan to continue your association with Sherlock Holmes?”
Mycroft’s gaze flickered with something unreadable, but his answer was smooth.
Sherlock halted, but he continued to call after him.
Sometimes as he slept, he could almost feel Sherlock by his side, desperately searching for him. In these dreams, Sherlock would run in the opposite direction, figure bending and twisting in the distance, screaming for John.
There was something he needed to come back to, but he was already forgetting what it was.
The fire Dragon he had been treating before the actual battle had vanished. His Mistress came to the tent, all but hyperventilating as she realised he had been lost in the chaos of battle. None of Andy's condolences seemed to assuage her, and John had listened from the edge of the tent as the women had torn a strip into the medical captain, snarling at him more harshly than a Dragon herself as she'd berated him. Sherlock to his credit remained silent, even when John flinched at the sound of two voices rising. It was too much like the fighting he had heard when he had been back home, and the young soldier soon fled, feeling as if his nerves were made of taught elastics drawn too far.
all in John's steady voice and manner.
John also found quickly that the conversation lead to topics that he had trouble navigating safely. Attempting to find a line of speech they could both relate to, John shyly found himself glancing at the Queen’s scarred face- curious but unable to ask directly less it be seen as rude. After the fourth or fifth glance, Ryuk let out a soft rumble of amusement that sounded like marbles rolling on a wooden floor, and Rania poured more tea smoothly even as she told John
John could only assume by the current state he was in and the slightly manic look in his partner's eyes that he had gotten accidentally caught up in one of Sherlock's more obscure experiments. His sigh was one of long-suffering patience and sleepiness, and Sherlock didn't seem to even register it on his radar, so consumed as he was in creating a blanket cocoon.
“What did you expect him to tell me? Keeping secrets again brother dear? What did you threaten the poor man with to try and coerce him into pushing me away?”
Then there was a freezing blast, and the Dragon's crushing pinning weight was off of him. John was still for only a moment, but when he rolled onto his side, Sherlock was locked in a fierce battle with a fully transformed English.
“Hmm... did you go to the moon?”
himself sick. He's gotten a mite better, but he's still not out of it yet.”
, so she supposed she owed him. She no longer had to hide unless she wanted to, which sometimes she did. No longer did she have to lock herself into closets, clapping her hands over her ears and whimpering and wishing that she wasn't the personality that John called on during his 'scared' moments. In fact now her job was much easier, as she was only forcibly called on when John sometimes had a really bad nightmare.
The more he looked, the less answers he found. There was nothing particularly interesting about the man lying before him, even as he coasted above the world on his cloud. Nothing except for the fact that his face was particularly expressive, if a bit ordinary. The kind of face one would likely forget in a crowd, at least when it was lax with sleep like it was now. Sherlock could imagine the man's scowl, and how he had been able to see that John would not have had any problems attempting to wrap his hands about his throat had he thought he'd stood a chance. The memory of the fire that had lingered in the man's eyes made Sherlock rethink the idea of
Since the incident with the White Dragon, the creature had been nearly impossible to keep tame. Hardly sleeping, and eating only when was absolutely necessary. The Dragon refused to settle, instead choosing to pace the length of the miniscule tent after training sessions, frost streaming from his lips even as sweat stood out against his forehead in jewelled beads. The restlessness could be felt in every pore of the creature’s skin, in the bend of his spine. John felt as if he were looking at feral animal, coiling itself up to spring on some unexpecting passerby. It was completely maddening, having the Dragon’s thoughts whirling through his own day in and day out, sharp like shrapnel and cutting.
John woke without having really realised he had dozed off, a crick aching in his neck from falling asleep propped against his headboard. The book he had been reading lay discarded in his lap, the tome on mythical creatures staring up at him innocently and yet accusing John of giving in to his impulse to learn all he could about Sherlock’s unseen world. He blinked at it somewhat grumpily, groaning as he forced himself to rise. Everything hurt – it felt like he had been running a marathon lately.

He wasted no time in pleasantries.
I am only human after all! Comments/kudos of course are always welcomed with love and cuddles, and I hope you enjoy! :D
That was perhaps the worst part of it, the terrible loneliness of it. Sherlock had to grit his teeth against the steady ache in his chest, the part of his brain that longed to devolve to his baser instincts and scream and howl for his Mate.
He began to wonder if this is what working with Sherlock Holmes would entail. Being left behind in strange places and expected to find his way back home without any help whatsoever.

They did not notice the whispering brush of leonine skin sliding seamlessly through the water, nor did they notice the whiskered face peering once over the wet-slicked rocks down by the shore. Nothing but water could be seen when Merina looked back towards the sea, but she shivered as she thought she heard the dying echoes of a song she almost knew drift far away.
“He is due to wake up any time now, he’s been taken off the anaesthetic.” Mycroft’s voice drifted to him from the entrance to the hospital room. Sherlock made no outward sign of having heard him, but the words registered somewhere deep inside of him. His chest felt twisted in knots, and it was entirely unpleasant and strange. “You should know that recovery for him will be slow, and that he’ll likely slip in and out of things for a while. It’s not like films, he won’t wake all at once.” Sherlock listened to the slight tap of the man’s umbrella, his gaze locked onto John’s face. It was easier to deal with, in that moment. When he did not offer an immediate reply, Mycroft exhaled at length. “You would do with a few more meals, and some sleep. Remember, the two of you as it stands are connected now. Your health, is his.”
Instead, Xavi spoke first. His voice was rough, hoarse with dread as he finally looked up at her. There was a haunted line to his shoulders.
“That would be because there were none used.” She sounded almost amused, as if she were being indulgent. Tracing a line along the body’s trachea, the Gem murmured her deduction. “Air. By itself, we need it. We inhale it, both Human and Gems. Yet inject it into someone’s vein, and what do we get?”
“Here, the rich display social status via extravagance. Generally, the more gaudy and priceless the better. I think I recognise the pattern, it's likely the litter for the leader of most of Eastern Afghanistan, Queen Rania.”
So he watched and waited, and patiently learned.
put on a very beleaguered sigh, but did not try to fight.
She nodded in affirmation, saluting him with a smart flick of her hand.
“You're new, aren't you? It's not Claude I'm talking to? Or Sneak?” He knew very well it wasn't either of the two, but Sherlock needed to get the personality talking, and to do that coaxing would be necessary. To his surprise however, John's face twisted darkly in rage, and a familiar Welsh accent barked out angry words.
John had reminded Sherlock of himself, and in the process, made the Dragon thoroughly disgusted by his own cowardice.
“I don’t understand. I don't even really think I know what your feelings

John wondered to himself, and noticed as Sherlock's gaze flicked briefly to a small birthmark on Molly's shoulder. At first glance, it was almost shaped like a tiny spiral.
little girl might. Except John was a five foot six tall ex-army doctor, and though he was by no means fat he had with him the weight of muscles that had been to war. Sherlock's thin frame in comparison stood little chance, and the detective soon found himself winded as John's strong arms squeezed about him tightly. Only his somewhat garbled but intelligible squawk of protest finally made the little girl giggle and release him.
“How do I honour the

He scowled at John, frost leaving his breath in a huffing smoke, flaring his wings in complete and total exasperation. The army doctor rolled his eyes at the Dragon’s sarcasm, rubbing at the bridge of his nose and sighing sharply through his teeth. His growl was very human, but in that moment, he wished he could roar like his friend could.
Albert for his part sounded almost sheepish, a laugh that was callous and cruel uttering from his lips as he said ruefully “S'pose that's fair n' all. Still I wonder, Holmes. You said we must be bored of this, and that in't a lie... but the way you said it implied we're missun' something of interest.”
people, wouldn’t you?”
John's first instinct was to snap back, but Lestrade's words rang in his ears. He found his hands rising in what he hoped was a placating gesture, voice lowering calmly as he stated “I'll let you leave if you want. After you've eaten. It's not that I don't believe you can't care for yourself, it's... I worry.”
For a moment, he debated climbing just one more stone.
“I guess so.” John shrugged. He scratched the back of his head, thinking. “But I’d also like someone who knows how

Holding Molly, he thought he understood. There was something wonderful and strange about Dragons, something at once terrifying and magnetizing. There was an adrenaline, brushing elbows with something so dangerous, and a pride at earning their trust. As it was, he couldn't imagine ever purposefully hurting his own Dragon. Despite what everyone warned against, it was impossible to look into Molly's eyes and see nothing but a small and scared girl, and Mike knew that it was that reason that
The fact was, Sherlock had no control. And though that settled in him like a heavy stone in his gut, the Dragon knew it like a brand imprinted into the back of his neck. So long as he wore a collar, he would not ever be truly free.
“John Watson makes Sherlock Holmes
The Spirit’s blase attitude irked John somewhere deep in the cavity of his chest, and his voice was surprisingly accusing as he looked at Sherlock fully, gesturing to the pot of tea that sat before them.

“I’m. I’m sorry- I-I didn’t realise this room was-I’ll leave.”
unconscious, rather impressively so by John's fist, and his knuckles had stung a bit even as he barked at Sherlock to
Mycroft nodded, shifting uneasily. He didn’t know how to explain his own specialty in Magic, wasn’t sure if it would turn Greg off of him. Shifting as a whole came with a host of preconceived notions and expectations. Being the technical oldest of the royal line didn’t help his cause, either.
Sherlock snorted indignantly, blowing fog out in a cloud around him before silently gathering his courage to flounce inside as menacingly as he could manage. Given the fact that he was as unsure of himself as a baby cow being thrown into a pack of wolves, he felt he did a fairly impressive job.
“I feel useless.” He whispered, and might have continued if it hadn’t been for the hand that settled upon his shoulder, silencing his tirade.
So when the detective admitted to wanting to take on a case that was offered to him “by a past acquaintance” John honestly hadn’t known what to expect. A part of him thought that Sherlock would lead him to an old case like Mrs Hudson had been, someone grateful for his help but in trouble once more and in need of a consulting detective.
She shook her head as if in amusement "Always chasing after a new thrill.” She turned fully to John then, the purple-pink curls that haloed her face tumbling in the breeze of the night. “It’s been a pleasure, doctor Watson. Truly, a
The Dragon bowed low and mockingly, his eyes cold and cruel. John was beginning to tremble with the amount of effort it was taking not to scream at Sherlock, and he knew on some level he should stop, should just… breathe.
That was, John thought this once he got his jaw up from off of the floor.
"You're a distraction for him, you know. He doesn't feel. Sherlock Holmes... he doesn't have
“The closest interpretation on this planet’s Swing Ballet.” Tanzanite replied, blue eyes looking over Morganite critically. John looked down at those indigo toes, already flexing against the linoleum. “Yours is Contemporary. They’re cousins, close enough to merge without too much trouble. I’ll lead.”
Sherlock was also somehow... softer on his girl days. Less tense, less defensive. Quieter and subdued. John would consider asking if he was okay, except that it was obvious that Sherlock wasn't hurting. No, he just seemed gentler, more prone to do things for others, though he was still wholly the detective, underneath the dose of empathy that seemed to fill him. It was like rain after Sherlock's normal lighting-personality, a muffled wash of water against the windowpane. Pastel instead of glittering, callous sharpness.
“There

“What you’re saying is, he might put on an act when at the Ball?” Greg nodded.

voice mocked him, speaking into his thoughts and spiking Sherlock's temper. He could feel his patience beginning to wear thin, although he might have lasted. Even if the strange Dragon insisted on speaking to him.
The mirror opposite of John.
The Human flinched away from his spidery and hesitant touch, mindlessly lashed out at him before seeming to realise who it was. Upon seeing Sherlock anguish crossed his blue eyes, and he pressed himself automatically against the Spirit’s leg, pressing his face against his thigh and begging numb forgiveness that tasted like ash on John’s tongue.
Well, he'd be on guard.
It would only be later that John would question Sherlock's use of the word
She landed in the dust in a front-curl, up on her feet in an instant. Darting past Sherlock's much larger form, she brandished claws that glinted blackly from the ends of her humanoid hands. Her eyes were slitted gold against dark skin, and she snarled from behind the mask that kept the sand out of her mouth and her identity hidden. Still, there was no mistaking the height of her frame, the smallness of her limbs. Barely more than a child and yet frothing at the mouth with rage. John found himself ducking as she lunged with inhuman speed, making a slice for his internal organs before whirling like a dancer, ducking to sweep his legs out from under him.
He walked along the dirt road, ears picking up tell-tale splashing sounds coming from the shore. True to his predictions, Sherlock was a sleek knifepoint in the water, dark curls slicked back so that the angles of his face appeared razor-sharp.
Sherlock watched, holding his breath as large blue eyes looked up at him, seeing but not processing, the entire posture of his
“He doesn't seem to have any mental problems? Anything besides the aggression and protective tendencies? Are his wings functional? Everything checking out like it should? He's not unnecessarily confrontational or weak in stamina?”
“You were experiencing a nightmare.” Sherlock hissed, even as he felt his heart pound. John was somehow pushing him aside. His body was moving willingly. Why was it moving willingly? The detective wasn't sure. If he had to hazard a guess, he might say it was shock.
Except this computer would have
His superior officer's voice was high and slightly surprised, edged with faint suspicion as she came to stand over Sherlock and inspect him. John was suddenly vitally glad he'd managed to trim Sherlock's messy black curls into some pretence of order the other night. He tugged on his sleeve, further trying to hide the strange tattoo that stained his wrist. An absent gesture. He could not tear his gaze away from the Dragon's still form.
True to Murray's words, most people found their Dragons had a seemingly instinctive
It seemed that list was getting disturbingly longer the more time he spent thinking. To help remedy that issue, John set the kettle to boil. Nothing like a cuppa to stop his thoughts from spiraling out of control. The comforting sound of the water set to bubbling filled the kitchen, partially muffling the commotion going on in the next room over.
Subservience.
“And you’re not paying me to stay away from Sherlock Holmes or provide you intel on him. End of story.”
Then a dangerous, savage roar shook him from the base of his spine to his toes.
“I’m going to admit, I had ulterior motives for meeting you.” Mycroft looked at him in confusion. Ulterior motives? Greg was quick to explain. “Your mother… she told you to interact with me I take it?” Mycroft nodded, the pieces rapidly clicking together even as Greg spoke. He felt surprise and shock as it was suddenly made clear.
There was a breath of peace as Hajera announced their names before kneeling herself, Queen Rania rising to her feet in one graceful motion to reveal a glittering dress of aquamarine and midnight blue. Her Dragon wound itself about her neck, seamless in its motions. When she spoke, it was with the calm quality of someone absolutely and completely secure in the knowledge of their own power and ability. Her English was nearly accentless, cultured with a British lilt that gave away the origins of her tutors.
came home to find me apparently beating the older kid close to death with my bare hands as well as an umbrella. I don't remember, but the story goes they had to physically tear me away from the kid and drag me to my room. Then the wife took the kid to the hospital, and the husband kept an eye on the house. Apparently a few hours later I came out of the room, and I remember
Sherlock seemed to know with an innate sixth sense when John was going to awaken. If he wasn’t already alert to his waking, then the Dragon himself was passed out cold. John found this as he turned his head, a soft expression melting over his features as he looked at the Dragon. Sherlock lay curled in what had to be an uncomfortable position in the plastic chair he’d taken to roosting like a gargoyle in. His knees were tucked to his chin, his wings wrapped about him in a makeshift shelter. His eyes were closed, the lines at the corner of his mouth smoothed so that he looked younger than usual. Sherlock’s dark lashes fluttered, his eyes roving behind their lids with dreams.
And yet even the detective had limits on his patience.
The simple fact of it was that John liked sex.
“What else?”
“You don’t.”

I'm really glad you all are enjoying! One more chapter then the boys are off to battle. :)
it is appreciated!
Sherlock was not prone to emotion, but the case had taken on if possible an uglier pattern, one he did not notice until now. The victims were getting younger.
Sherlock’s lips twisted minutely in a small smile of approval, and for a moment the awkward beginning of their meeting was forgotten. The detective revealed from behind his back John’s coat, throwing it to him with only the barest hint of hesitation. John caught it instinctively, his fingers wrapping into the soft leather.
“There, there. It's okay. You're safe, I promise.
“Oh. Hello, again.”
The elder Holmes’ parting words before he left Sherlock to his waiting game rang in the detective’s ear, niggling its way under his skin.
It looked like the soldier's promise to him to ask instead of order things from him, might not protect the Dragon after all.
shrieking about him-
the regular amount. He's known for not only being aggressive, but cunning and vindictive. Revenge-minded.”
Sherlock’s scowl, evident frustration at his lack of understanding of John’s words made the soldier chuckle slightly, even as the Selkie dove forward, resting an instant out of John’s personal comfort bubble. It was a last second move, brought on by John’s instinctive flinch. Sherlock’s expression was impatient, and his eyes flicked towards the darkness, outside. John felt a tingling along his spine, unfamiliar adrenaline pricking his blood as Sherlock hummed a wheedling melody of desire.
was gold. His body… everything was different and John’s wide eyes struggled to take it in, unable to accept the disorientation that swept over him and forced him to see what was before him as fact. He was glowing, a soft light from his skin that tinted everything into brilliant hues of amber and sunlight, illuminating the tiny loo like he was a firefly. Yet that was not all. His pyjamas were gone for a form and a costume that was unrecognisable and yet essentially John Watson, of a sort. In a way.
Great.
voice piped up immediately,
However the elder Holmes continued on, ignoring John's question as he spoke, looking at the twitching of his hands as if they were marginally more fascinating than the man standing before him.
Sherlock tasted like tobacco, like peppermint and tea and impatience. A heavy aphrodisiac that left John feeling as though he were falling without end. It was a breathless sensation that reminded him of adrenaline and the harsh beauty of Afghanistan, and hungrily he leaned forward for more, only to feel the detective begin to draw away. For a second, that falling sensation turned into lead in John’s stomach, his fear that this was something Sherlock did not want causing his eyes to fly open, his ears to redden in shame.
Mycroft seemed to take the barest of breaths then, his hands tightening around the handle of his umbrella. When he spoke, it was as if he were purposefully trying to gentle the grisly demise of the victims for his brother’s sake. Sherlock could have snorted in derision, it wasn’t like he felt the least bit of remorse for anyone who had a hand in tormenting John.

Yet the detective was already on his feet, phone in hand as he texted Dimmock, Lestrade being away. When he looked back at John, any glimmer that might have been vulnerability had already been dissolved. If it had been there at all, it was now impossible to find under the disguise of excitement over the case.

Mycroft Holmes wondered if John knew, just how much such a small light could lend hope when he stared at the face of the cold world he had immersed himself in for someone else's sake.
- so I've mentioned that Egypt (in fact, most of Africa) and the east have an alliance, and have had one in this world for many years. This alliance was solidified in an act of marriage between Rania's father, and her mother (who died during Rania's birth). This is why all of Rania's siblings have Egyptian names, a token to her mother's heritage. It is also why Rania in terms of appearance (at least to my mind) is much darker than most of the natives of her kingdom.
“You will get to see him within a few more days; have some patience if you can. In the meantime, I thought we might discuss visiting hours for some of your other acquaintances.”
Sebastian seemed to splutter, decreasing in size and stature even as the soldiers lined up cleared room to make way for-somewhat surprisingly, a petite blonde woman. She stood apart from the others in both attitude as well as appearance, flaxen hair cut short to her ears, blue eyes sparkling in a way that didn't seem to within the military mentality. They were the colour of sapphire's, and lit up when she smiled at Bill and greeted him as if he were an old friend. Murray didn't dare relax, shoulders still hunched against unseen attack as he eyed Wilkes with mistrust. John didn't blame him- the man looked fit to commit homicide.
John appeared smaller, although not
And quite suddenly, John felt him
“....You think so?”
But that didn't make any sense, at least to John. Then again he was Human, so he supposed Dragons thought differently. Perhaps the creature had only known the small Cages of the Kennel, and this was how it responded to a larger space compared to his past ones. The thought sent a small spark of pity flowing through John's chest, but it was tiny when compared to his overwhelming relief at his life no longer being actively threatened. He sighed as he leaned his head back against the wall, shuddering with suppressed emotion that was flowing to the surface now that the wake of adrenaline-induced bravery had passed. He struggled to get his breathing steady, tears of alleviation threatening to fall even as he watched the beast cautiously, lowering his eyes whenever the Dragon's gaze snapped back to him as if to make sure he was still a quivering mess on the floor.
“Experiment. Accidentally poured the refuse of it on the flowerbeds.” Not a complete lie, he hadn’t meant to pour them on the lilies. His original plan had been to dump it on Mummy’s roses before he’d tripped. Sherlock was surprised to hear a warm chuckle in response, his Father grinning. It lit up the entirety of his face, and for a moment, Sherlock saw a hint of his own features, hidden in there. Arthur’s tone wasn’t angry.
His superior shrugged without preamble.
The man snorts as if the question is horribly dull in nature, cutting him off as deft fingers twirling the modules of the microscope even as his dark baritone rumbles.
But on the floor, Cerioth tensed. His dark eyes narrowed into slits and the muscles in his arms flexed almost imperceptibly, and John soon saw why.
and a blast of frigid air hit John’s face like a slap. He closed his eyes and leaned into it, eyes opening just in time to be blinded by an arching crack of lightning. It sliced through the air, hitting somewhere beyond the palace and leaving an echoing roar behind it. John was deafened, his hearing returning in ringing waves that for a moment sounded like music.
Usual trigger warnings for this chapter, mind yer step :)
The Water-Spirit thought to himself not for the first time that he rather loathed human beings.
as they were slitted in agony. The army doctor saw the crack, his heart stopping as his eyes tracked its length, from one end of the egg to the middle of it. It tore through him, leaving his chest feeling as though it were wet and fragile like tissue held under water.
“You’re starting to fade.”
Overhead, thousands of stars glittered like peculiar gemstones. John let his eyes drift shut, leaning against the Selkie’s shoulder. For the first time since he had returned from Afghanistan, he allowed himself to truly sleep with someone directly next to him.
“Or go ahead, laugh at me. Not like I’m not in a terrible position, trying to avoid being

“Do you really think that is wise? Perhaps it would be unwise to have John return so soon to your flat, given his insistence on leaving it in the first place.”
He knew what he would be
What did this… Blue mean by ‘someone will hurt me’ if she tells you their name?”
But his assurance was cut off, as suddenly, Soo Lin let out a warning screech from where she had been standing (head tilted, listening, dark eyes widened in growing horror) that made the very carts tremble, the glass and metal tools of the medical trade trembling in their places.
Right.
In retrospect, John understood the logic. Still, he felt a surge of annoyance and exasperation at the government, or specifically whoever had come up with the outlines to join the military.
“John Watson. Yeah, Sherlock and I are new. It's our first year. Didn't really know what to expect.”
SO SORRY THIS TOOK SO LONG! DX many apologies, however with school starting up I have found myself suddenly waking up at five and going to bed at ten again. So.
I thought… Well I thought the way I felt would never be reciprocated.” A pained, nervous swallow, and the apology that John for once in his life didn’t want finally came. “I’m so sorry, for the pain that I have caused you.”
What was the most surprising, however, was that upon being sure that he had John’s attention the Selkie opened his mouth, and spoke.
Sherlock called out to John, his voice whip-like and sharp. He was a captain calling his men to attention, and it was instinct for the soldier to obey.
good, she didn't want to upset Mr. Holmes, but she didn't want to talk any more. The conflicting feelings must have been
by its very nature.”
Sebastian Wilkes was a ghost of Sherlock’s past. A shade that most of the time, the detective would rather he didn’t remember. He was a relic of the darker parts of the man’s memories, and had the same, slightly dodgy smile on his face that he had when they had both been teenagers. John was struck instantly with the tension that filled the room in their entrance, and also by the instant sensation of animalistic hatred that lined the man’s attitude despite his polite enough tone in greeting them. Seb sat behind a huge, polished wooden desk, hands decorated with a single gold ring and wrist donned with a rather flashy-looking watch. However all sense of manners dissipated with a flash of a sharply-edged smile and Sherlock’s very slight flinch in response. Before he opened his mouth, John knew that he’d probably have to be very careful in what he said. If he wasn’t careful, he’d probably find himself being arrested for assault. He tried not to linger too long on what it meant that he’d attack a man over someone like Sherlock Holmes.
He would take the rule he had adopted from dealing with his Father then.
Cara's feet seemed to float upon the sand, and the waves as they licked on her feet were a distant, cool sensation. A part of her felt as though her eyelids were rather heavy, like they became when she curled herself up in the large blanket her house had, by the fireplace. All fuzzy and soft. She thought the pony's neck and nose must be soft, if it looked so shiny from where she was standing. Her fingers itched, arm lifting to seek out its surface, to touch. Her lungs felt as though they were filled with water, and yet she couldn't drown, not so long as there was the horse, watching her. Guarding. Protecting.

Why would he hide it, after all it’s against his nature to put people in danger, and living with me is risky should one of his personalities decide to manifest...
foresight from Mike) barely visible on the ceiling from the haze that blurred everything. It didn't affect Molly's breathing, being a Dragon, but she knew right away that Humans could die from smoke asphyxiation and immediately looked around in panic for her Master. He was nowhere in sight.
” was lost in the playful giggles of his sibling's light as air voice.
Greg inhaled deeply, coughing the next instant as the cold air assaulted his lungs despite his Magic. Mycroft stepped forward, ignoring how the Dragon’s skin burn his own pink as he patted his back.
Music could be heard lilting from the flat even from the front step, the sharp chords of a guitar reverberating from an amp drifting over the pavement. Though Sherlock was absolutely abysmal at recognising modern forms of music, he
The older Demon sighed, fingers tightening upon the handle of his parasol. His voice carried a note of impatience. “Are you aware that as a higher Demon I can sense when a lower Demon’s condition has changed? That I know that you engaged in intercourse with a human and bit into their flesh, physically tasted their blood?”
man before him would go to in order to gain Sherlock's faith. John was offering a way to run, and even if it was a slim chance, had it been anyone else the Dragon may have taken it.
Painfully ordinary next to Sherlock Holmes.
Raz's quiet voice inquired softly, and John froze as his parent's fell silent for too long, the lack of voices causing his chest to constrict painfully even as he halted in his movements. For a second, all John could hear was his own breath, much too fast, much too shallow to bear.
Rin’s voice was ice-calm.
“American. Interesting, why would
“John... you know that I trust you as well right?”
As well suspicion held that perhaps Mycroft was just pulling some elaborate joke on him, except the Holmses were never ones to poke fun. How many personalities were there if it was true? Had he met any of them and had just been unaware of the change at the time? There was so much new data that his Mind-Palace was virtually spinning with it, demanding that he get the answers to questions and get them
Instead, he found an empty lower floor, devoid of life and looking as if it had been abandoned in a hurry. Stacks of old cases were toppled over, and the couch lay barren and neglected. Lestrade frowned, hearing a muffled thump from upstairs. It was odd that neither Sherlock or John were on the first floor, but then again, the D.I admitted to himself that the detective did have a habit of crashing literally anywhere he felt like. It would not have surprised Greg to discover John had given up his bed for the man, choosing instead to sleep in the armchair on the other side of his room. Lestrade called out again for the detective and companion, even as he mounted the first step.
Sherlock was discharged from the hospital a few days after being treated for a mild concussion and drowning. During those few days, the detective regained some of his strength, and no longer felt like a kitten that had been tossed into the Thames one time too many.
“Change of plans.” The darkly-curled teen lied smoothly, blue eyes flicking to his hands even as he did up the buttons of his shirt from the bottom-up. Sherlock's words were partially true at least, Sebastian had met up with him in that library for the first time only a month or so before, and he had run out of the second batch of drug he had gotten as of three days ago. For three days he had debated with himself, fighting over whether or not he should meet up with the shark-smile man. Yet finally, the calling had made him give in.
him. Each of his kind had something, each one a little different from the other. From the start, Sherlock knew what called him to the fair boy.
John had never been good at dancing. A typical British male through and through, his few school social events had lead him to discovering quickly that he had two left feet, and possibly a third leg that was invisible, tripping him up. He mastered a few base moves to impress secondary school girls, but beyond that he was well and truly hopeless.
he, when he barely acknowledged his
The young man reared up off of his back, fingers clawing into the silken sheets beneath him, shimmering blue like waves of water as his head whipped about, searching for clues as to where he'd been taken. John found memories coming back to him, all hazy and indistinct, but they did not serve to soothe but rather agitate him further, especially as he came to know that he was lying on a bed made for a king.
“Now, now, Sherlock. No need to assume the worst immediately. Our little friend appeared to have misjudged the amount of rainfall that's happened the past couple of weeks- we picked up Claude at the park, knee-high in mud.” And indeed, once Sherlock looked closer he could see tell-tale traces of what looked to be rough play. A splash of mud behind one ear, grime underneath John's fingernails. Claude looked vaguely shamed as she looked up at the detective, blue eyes wide as she mumbled
Though Mike's Mother had long passed (sickness, there had been a coughing disease one winter that took many people) her legacy it appeared had lived on. When Mike had attended her funeral, he had discovered that his Mum had kept more money than he knew tucked away for him.
The elder Holmes sucked in a breath through his teeth. For a moment, he considered refusing to tell his brother. Grey eyes flicked to manicured nails, even as the elder Holmes carefully conceded that despite his reservations if Sherlock wanted to know, he would likely find out on his own. His voice felt heavy with defeat.
When Daniel opened his eyes again, he scowled accusingly at Sherlock, eyes narrowing into slits. His voice was freezing. The detective felt his fury at him like cold nails sliding down his back.
In response, the man shrugged with one shoulder concomitantly.
John understood, then. He felt himself relax as the reasons were made clear to him, even as his mind still spun with the gut-dropping fear and surprising joy that had been thrust upon him (A
Many thanks as always to my fantastic beta
Looking up at his reflection, Sherlock saw how John's face seemed
It was when Bensen pulled the breaks on the truck that conversation fell abruptly silent, Sherlock’s senses alerting John to the fact that they were nowhere near their usual borders. Something was wrong, and the silence of the sand outside made the hair on the back of John’s neck prickle with discomfort. It felt as if the wind itself were dead. Beside him, Rory shifted uneasily, darting a glance over to Marley.
to do. Especially when I see something so unjust happening, such as this farce of a marriage that’s been thrust onto you.”
Mary had admitted to him even as he'd helped her get a good grip on the stonework that they'd scaled that she had had a crush on him for most of the summer, and the knowledge alone sent most of John's fears and reservations sailing away, only to be replaced by wondering disbelief. The young woman's short-cropped hair glittered like flaxen under the starlight as she explained to him that she'd merely been afraid to tell him, her voice low and earnest even as she'd taken his hands.
The word shivered in the Dragon’s mind, and Sherlock shuddered in kind. Illegal, illicit, and unwanted. That was what a Bond was. Nothing but inconvenience, and so easy to see, the physical manifestations telling. John would have suffered terribly for Sherlock’s one moment of weakness, and the thought made the Dragon’s stomach twist in knots.
“How can you possibly think that you don't belong, when no one wants to
“They never stayed with me long enough to find out. I always wound up hurting them or hurting myself before they could...”
A feeling of panic began to well inside Sherlock's chest, and he felt as though he was already entertaining the idea of an early-set in Stockholm Syndrome. He had seen other Dragons with it before, who mistook a lack of beatings for kindness in their Masters. They'd follow their Humans around with mooning eyes and happy smiles, all the while ignoring the leashes connected to their throats. He scowled bitterly at the thought, nails biting crescents into his palms as he finally released John's arm and allowed the soldier to rinse the last dredges of soap from his hair.
“This is your last chance. Your loyalty towards Sherlock Holmes is touching but useless. Daniel, The amount of money I can give you-”

there? Are they all so......
The silver glint of his scar flashed in the dark of the cove, the Selkie’s eyes latching upon it, cat-like and piercing. It seemed to happen in the span of a breath, though it may have been much longer, as John was beginning to panic at the lack of air going into his lungs. One moment he was being strangled, the next he was being unceremoniously dumped to the ground, his leg and shoulder tingling from the wet and cold and causing John to grit his teeth to suppress a pained moan.
“This is not your territory.” The god repeated, his voice hard. The voice that came from the wolf was male, but deeper than any human's. John felt his pulse thud dully in his ears, everything inside of him screaming at the unnatural quality of it.
The Detective stares at him, for a moment his thoughts going completely slack. Cut like puppet strings as he has to remind himself to respond.
Because really, the death of the group of homeless people weren't the first death they had to cover up for, and none of them
He had gotten what he wanted.
“Were you two close?”
“Not much then. Did you know that between male and female Dragons, the females yield a significantly larger clutch? A male Dragon may only bear one egg in his lifetime, and yet they grow still so attached to it, even though its chances of it actually hatching are slim.”
project. Mycroft had seemed doubtful, the flexing of his hands upon the handle of his umbrella musing as he stared somewhere in the middle distance.
Manners. Dragons were apparently really picky about them. John had been aware of it, even in the way Cerioth had spoken in the car to the other Dragons when they had been driving home from the Kennels. Was the creature hovering there..... because it wanted
His sentence caught off with a cry as Wilkes' Dragon suddenly shrieked and curled to the ground, gripping his neck with a roar of pain that near deafened John from where he stood. Bill shouted, and on instinct John made to lunge forward- Only to be dragged back into place by Sherlock's impossibly strong grip. Holding John discreetly by his wrists, the Dragon's voice hissed in John's ear.
His voice curled around Sherlock like a snake's.
. The result was instantaneous. Sherlock could
John’s dancing was left forgotten for the moment, and the ex-army doctor privately hoped that enough action would occur on this journey that it would be a permanent dropping of the subject.
Sherlock’s skin didn’t tan, but it was prone to burning if he forgot to apply sunscreen and make an effort to take a break during the hottest parts of the day. The Dragon’s scales could be used as an offering of shade if he was desperate, the sail-like membranes tougher than mere skin. It was so warm, that John often didn’t even realise that back in London fall was fast approaching, the shedding of trees sending small children so very far away outside, running to make leaf piles. Dragon and soldier alike began becoming used to the desert and its harsh beauty, and with that ease John forgot steadily about his home, finding a better grounding in Sherlock’s quiet presence. He instead found familiarity in cold, austere nights under a star-filled sky.

of ice, leading around his Crate and out the door. It disappeared from view around the corner, but gave a promise of reward. Licking his chapped lips, the Dragon reached for another one, the cool sensation on his fingers mercifully sweet as he brought it to his lips and sucked on the second cube in contemplative thought.

eyes. His curls, once shorn but attempting to grow out again, slightly messy from London's wind. His expression was unreadable.
Nothing would change, and Sherlock thought that at least he could possibly convince the mortal that he was scary enough that he'd be left on his own to think. Maybe, if the Human proved not to be utterly dull, he could have him be a servant. A companion, of sorts.
“Well, what is it that you need to say to me then? What must I watch out for this time, hm? Killer assassins? Vampyres? I mean, if
Though she had been telling her story just fine, John noticed that here Irene’s throat had seemed to close up. He knew with terrible certainty who she was now, but still he waited for her to push through with her story. He knew that the woman he was talking with wasn’t here, not really.
“A dragon is a legendary creature, typically with serpentine or reptilian traits that features in many different cultures. Since the dawn of time, Dragons have been the subject of both legend and speculation, deriving from many different traditions and originally thought to have been of mythical descent. However, with modern science, the "Dragon Gene" has been proven to be a mutation of the genetic strand of a Human, allowing the subject to "Shift" into a beast-like state at will.”
“Sherlock Holmes, yes. I deduce you’ve got him held somewhere nearby… given the fact that you were collecting seawater and have his scent all over you.”
It was an obvious ploy, but it had no choice but to work.
But everything thing was hazy and ghost-like, indistinct like the blurred lens of a magnifying glass brought too close to one's face.
But it appeared that the decision was out of his hands, as in a moment later, he heard his father hesitantly acquiesce.
But Dodge wasn't excusing her actions. Rather, she seem unconcerned as to whether or not John judged her, letting him draw his own opinions and conclusions from the facts and facts alone.
“A fight.” Xavi answered promptly. His voice was hollow. “They’ll take master and Dragon, and they’ll tell the Dragon to... kill or the both of them will be t-tortured.” He gritted his teeth at the last word, his eyes falling shut. Molly reached out a hand to Xavi, scared and sorry that she had made the Dragon relive his pain.
Sherlock paused, thinking over the question carefully. When he answered, it was with a sulky sort of surrender that made it obvious that he was being honest.
bestowed upon me that I cannot find myself?”
Because it was also extremely evident that for all of the creature's power and energy, the Dragon was unwell. Its ribs were like rows of shelves on its side, and John was sure that if he could touch them he could fit an entire hand in the space between. The creature's scales shifted as it slept with flashes of pained red, and there was a steady stream of foggy breath as the Dragon panted in its sleep. Then there was the arching forms of its wings, which looked if possible worse off than he had originally thought. The black, sluggish fluid that the wound had been oozing covered most of the creature's back, and spread just over its shoulder in a greasy, sickly kind of way. It looked like motor oil after it had been used.
That was not part of the plan.

He turned then to Mike, arching a thin eyebrow and looking him over slyly.
Instead John met Sebastian Wilkes, a man that was human and that owned a smile that was far more shark-like than friendly. The entire time he spoke, Sherlock’s own smile looked more and more politely forced. It was then that John slowly came to recognise that when the detective said “acquaintance” he had meant “enemy”.
behind. There was no name behind his reason for flight, only an overwhelming sense of terror. A feeling of fear that his family would leave him behind, that he was somehow not needed to complete the Watson picture.
The floor was cold under John’s bare feet, but he scarcely cared. He was already padding towards the balcony, tossing aside the curtains and feeling the cold shock of the wooden railing. Wet, his fingers came away with pearly drops of water, more than he could believe. He stared in shock, laughing to himself before bringing his fingers to his lips. John’s eyelids fluttered closed, the water was wet and cool, pure. He cupped his hands, drinking more deeply before reaching his hands up to the water that dripped from the slanted roof above.
There were many.

It was funny, how those thanks given to him left him feeling ashy and small. John spent the first three nights after the battle in a hospital bed, bouncing back and forth between nightmares and dreams that left him aching, blood pooling to his groin and leaving him crying out a name that he should never had known. The priest had come to see him, to talk to John about his feelings after the “attack”. The captain hadn’t told kind-faced Father Henry that in his mind, it wasn’t so cut and dry. Still he confessed his sins, and was told that it wasn’t his fault. That he had been “overcome” by the creature’s dark magic, that what had happened had been a cruelty.
Just did it.
“I don't have

you.” There was no mistaking the enraged, jealous tone in the Dragon’s voice, and John didn’t have a chance to explain before he found the backs of his knees hitting Sherlock’s cot, his balance over-toppling. It was instinctive that the soldier reached out, but unfortunate that the nearest thing to John happened to be one very angry Dragon.
But to make it up to you, in this chapter we get a look at a new character~~ and also a giggle or two at the image of a seal detective :P
With John slumbering away, Claude mentally whispered the plans to her brothers and sisters. As one, they all nodded.

Fear, pain and shock can do strange things to a person. That was what John's parents were told when the doctor came to see them and tell them about their son's condition. Dr Finnegan was an elderly man, and his Irish brogue was carefully differential even as he held up the clipboard in his hands and explained to them why John had to be sedated.
It had been his Mother's last Christmas present to him before she passed on.

John stroked his thumbs soothingly over the Dragon's prominent cheekbones, face softening from his fierce expression into something gentle and sad.
he had to hide the curling smile on his lips and instead replace it with a flashing glare of disdain. Because after all, it would do no good to look so excited when the teacher was yelling at him for reading ahead in the textbook.
Looking down at the book, he sighed in defeat and rubbed his hands over his face in exhaustion. His thoughts bit at him like vipers.
“The Mole.” John blurted in realisation, and Morstan nodded sharply, a small smile playing on her features.
“Well… this was. Unexpected.”
The first time she'd cut away those bloody curly locks, she'd laughed in manic glee.
“Need some encouragement, eh? Bet I could make the little man scream a bit, muss 'im up.”
Yet no one shared their kills, and he was too small yet to hunt.
Trying to feel like he wasn't meeting John Watson for the first time all over again, the Detective after a moment raised his own pale, long fingers to meet the soldier's grasp. His low baritone to its credit remained unflappable and cool, despite his inner thoughts racing at half a mile a minute. And because he couldn't help it, he asked again.

Again, Hamish rejected his idea. Sherlock’s gaze swept over Hamish’s jumper, noticing how little crumbs rested on it from lunch. Bread, except John hadn’t packed their son a sandwich. Instead it had been crackers and cheese. Yet there was no evidence of crackers on his son's uniform. Hamish also had a sticker on the back of his hand, one of a race car. However, his teacher didn’t give out stickers much, and tended to prefer those in the shape of planets and or stars. Something about positive reinforcement that the detective never quite bothered to understand. Tilting his head, Sherlock deduced the most likely culprit for his son's excitement easily.
“You said it was my choice. I choose to tap out. I'm.... I'm better off alone.”
Suddenly there were explosions and body parts in my kitchen and games of
He wasn’t quite sure, it was hard to see, hard to know. When he opened his eyes everything seemed not quite as it should be, the memory twisting and warping before him. A distant part of Sherlock’s brain supplied the obvious: concussion.
The next morning dawned for John with no return from Sherlock, and Dodge standing in his tent with her hands on her hips, kicking the side of his bed. Her expression was mildly annoyed as John sat up, blinking blearily into the dark of twilight.
He wondered if the government actually trusted their theories to actually resemble real life – not that said theories took into account the fact that they were dealing with living bombs just
"We believe of all things a seal attacked him, judging from the teeth marks. Though it's rare, it's not unheard of, especially during pup-rearing season. The females are known to be aggressive. Needless to say in the dark, a small boy might very well mistake it for a monster. It's natural when put into context, why he panicked upon reawakening."
All anger drained from him, yet John's mouth remained a thin line of displeasure. Well, at least
Kandahar was a bustle of activity. Due to it being a section of land that had been conquered again and again by various countries, the streets were filled with the crowded noise of Human and Dragon life going about their business without thought. The streets were filled with market-like activity, and like a vibrant rainbow of colour, John could see clothing from every part of the world being worn in the crowd. Egypt had been Kandahar's main ruler now for years however, so it wasn't difficult to see this was where most of the sartorial inspiration came from. The general designs were billowing scarves and saris, hijabs and long clothes to keep the sun from burning skin and blistering people's faces. At least, that's what John saw when he looked at the shop vendors trying attract their attention by hawking their merchandise to the soldiers as they passed by.
The elder Holmes opened his mouth, and both of the men knew it was to object to the detective's feelings towards John. However whatever Mycroft was going to say was cut off by the insistent chirp of a text message, the contents of which as his hands reluctantly dug for his mobile effectively rendering whatever the older Holmes might say in defence as null and void.
For the more the army doctor found out, the more he found it a miracle at all that Sherlock decided to try and trust again.
With a tremor that shook the very walls of the Cages themselves the beast stumbled and fell onto the ground, long tail nearly impaling John as it lashed one last furious time before going limp and still with unconsciousness. He and Mike stumbled away and then forward, trying to regain their footing even as the dust settled, and the shrieks and jeers of other Dragons filled the air with noises of distress that became deafeningly loud and swelled to echo in the Kennels.
Sherlock’s voice, already like thunder in John’s head, felt as if it were in an even deeper resonance when he was actually speaking. The Selkie’s head was tilted in question, and confusion wrinkled the furrow of Sherlock’s brow and made the normally smooth plane of his forehead crease. John licked his lips, abruptly trying to think of a way to explain the concept of cold with limited vocabulary. His eyes trailed to the many stones littering the shore, one hand reaching out and dipping into a shallow pool to grab one at random. It was deep grey, smooth and ice-cold from seawater, and before the Selkie could protest John pressed it to his upper arm, watching Sherlock hiss in annoyance at its chill.
A painting of relaxed submission that Sherlock did not normally associate with Humans.
“Did you even get any sleep like that?” John asked, the tired tone in his voice dripping with a familiar warm affection that the detective had admittedly missed. He straightened, ignoring the small aches of protest his spine made as he brushed John's concern off.
“But I made a mistake.” The army doctor muttered hollowly, and Greg offered him a small, sad smile.
The creature was smooth, sleekly so, and its whiskered face nosed over Sherlock carefully before blowing at him salt brine and hot breath, making the man wrinkle his nose in distaste. In response the seal whuffled at him crossly, swimming about the rock in a circular motion before it dove underwater. When it resurfaced, Sherlock was looking at his older brother's pale and unimpressed face, and he shuffled reluctantly aside to let the man take a seat on his rock, freckled muscles pulling him sinuously beside him.
It was better than a magic spell.
“Do you hear that?” John whispered, and turned reluctantly when Mike made a small confused sound in the back of his throat. The blonde boy felt as if eyes were glued to the back of his neck, burning him. Claiming.

“I'd say.... Private Detective.....”
He reassured in a high voice despite how
Mycroft’s face was not pleased as he wrapped his cloak about his shoulders once more, preparing for the shifting of his other form as he came to the front door of John’s home. His pale, reflective eyes matched the moonlight outside as he bid his farewells, and John watched with his arms crossed uneasily over his chest as the Selkie made their way along the beach, disappearing into the water with a negligent flick of their tail. The water looked cold, and John shivered against the chill wind even as he shut the door, squaring his shoulders to face the shadow of the man standing before him.
Sherlock chittered his annoyance, curled in the shade with his seal skin creating a nest to sit on.

new territory without permission, a thought that made him glance nervously back down the stairs. He lingered in the doorway, unable to move forward yet pinned at just the edge, muttering lowly in indecision under his breath. Dragon-Tongue curses flowed over his lips effortlessly without second thought. His voice was wild and rusted with strain. There was silence, heavy and pregnant as he listened for any noise other than the dull crackle of something cooking in the distance.
, she could feel his caress, lingering across her shoulders. Comforting and warm. Wordlessly, she turned and curled into the wide, warm embrace. Her tears soaked the edges of her sibling's suit.

“As I told you I don't talk for days. I also don't feel entirely male all the time. Truthfully I don't identify with any one gender. Sometimes... Sometimes on more feminine days I dress in different clothes... act differently... Doesn't happen often but still....”
Bill didn't react. Rather, he kept the same carefully blank expression on his face, hands remaining unclenched at his sides. He answered between decidedly clenched teeth, ice creeping into his tone despite the fact that he remained rather composed.
John found himself dressed in a woollen jumper, jeans and a blush-pink apron that he borrowed from Mrs. Hudson at five in the morning. He stared at the pan of bacon that was currently sizzling hotly before him on the stove, one hand resting absently in his pocket. The other was wound about the handle of fryer as he waited patiently for the Dragon downstairs to catch wind of its scent and make its way up the stairs.
The facts were there, written in biological tells that not even a doctor could hope to hide. The way the army doctor's eyes followed him when he paced, dilated slightly and almost predatory. The way his cheeks pinkened when the detective kissed him, hungrily and without hesitation (after the first few initially shy approaches, the detective had become rather an enthusiastic participant of snogging in general). Finally, the way in which John's smile lit up when Sherlock did something especially
with savage brutality.
For once just letting go of his concerns and fears, John allowed himself one small whoop of joy before he dove under the water. The thundering of the falls reverberated in his ears, a rumbling growl that shook and shivered all over his skin. It was the first moment of happiness since his abduction, he thought, in the moment between his next breath and swimming forward. John found power in the water, had done since he was little, and his eyes opened as he looked within the great pool before him, and saw he wasn’t alone.
He let loose a roar that seemed to shake the very sand beneath him. Sherlock, uncaring of how it pained him, threw open his wings. He caught the air, speeding towards John even while in the pit of his lungs ice sprung forth, steaming as it came into contact with desert heat.
“Oh. James doesn’t have parents.” Sherlock and John looked at one another, and in that look was a mixture of concern and unease. Turning his son to face him, Sherlock looked Hamish in the eye. His voice was deceptively calm.
trust you Sherlock. Especially when it comes to things of... this nature.”
A very small part was missing a little girl, who chattered nonstop and told him all about
. Except this was the aftermath of the tears. Cold. Detached.
When John finally slumped against him in defeat, Sherlock nearly didn’t hear the exhausted whisper. As it was, he did.
Before he could, the detective cut him off.
dull.
He thanked it once again now.
red, couldn't feel it drying and turning tacky on their skin. Hiding from brother, as so many of the personalities did. The only ones who ever stayed were her and Daniel. No one else liked brother.
John found something soothing in the action of unloading his gun, in disassembling the parts with gentle hands and care, in checking to make sure the firing pin and spring were properly placed and that the gun itself was well oiled. He fell into the motions with surprising ease, all the while keeping up an internal monologue for Sherlock on what he was doing. The Northern Dragon's eyes sparked with interest, the scaled parts of his half-human form tinged a curious violet like plums. It didn't take long before Sherlock was asking impatient questions through their link, demanding to know about the sear lever and how much of recoil the gun had. John answered each question patiently, hands going through the motions, his blue eyes watching his Dragon with amusement. There was something.... unearthly about Sherlock when he was deeply fascinated by something, a sort of wide-eyed curiosity that took hold of him completely. It set in the creature's bones, making him seem younger somehow, almost childlike. The image of a Hatchling, bright-eyed and impetuous, filled John's thoughts for a n instant, and he blinked in surprise before it cleared. Sherlock as a child... John wondered what he must have been like,
“You haven't even seen your grandmother since you were very small, John and part of that has to do with the fact that your parents wouldn't let you. I know her passing was hard for you, despite this. But her will left you the cottage to go to if you were
John dreamed things were shattering. Breaking to pieces. In his mind, the darkness itself seemed to break apart, splinter and crumble. He moaned, twisting on the couch, but a weight was pressing him down. Something heavy, but not crushing. Holding him in place. He whimpered in his sleep, trying to twist away, unable to do so. Something was tapping his face. Pressing against it.
, no thanks to you
KILL THEM!” The little girl shrieked. She knew it was no use, she was already slipping away. Yet an image of Sherlock filled her mind, as well as John, overwhelmed and lost in the white static of their head. They couldn't. The detective would know. John would go to jail. They would all go to jail.
“He found a tiny village, one with a girl that he knew that Sherlock wouldn’t be able to resist. She was smart, for a human, and had a biting tongue. She was beautiful, if cold.” Her expression grew sad then. “There was only one problem, she loved another girl in the village.”
Alone or loneliness, something told him that soon he'd have to choose just which he'd prefer.
And now, Sherlock was quite unsure what he could do to fix it.
Mrs Hudson's gaze softened into nothing more than wet tears, and somehow that was worse, far worse than the old woman's ire. She looked over the man critically, more her son than a tenant to a flat, and noted with some surprise just how pale the detective was, how he seemed to have lost weight. Sherlock had a tendency to be on the thin side, but he didn't normally look so gaunt, like a skeleton attempting to remain upright. There were dark, purplish shadows blooming under his eyes, and his long fingers were restless, tapping away. Though the elderly woman didn't know of the true danger of Sherlock's physical state, she did indeed know some things, and that was that her detective was prone to bouts of what could only be described as depression. Fits of ennui of which in the past used to cripple him, drain the colour out of the world around him. At one time, the young man might have solved this sadness, this disgust with the human race by stimulating his thoughts with drugs. Powerful thing, cocaine was. As well as heroin. Mrs Hudson's own husband had been involved in all sorts of sordid things of that nature, and she knew first-hand how very easy it could be to lose control. Henry hadn't always been a bad man, and it hadn't been until it was too late that she had been able to see the darkness that had consumed him. She was no stranger to waking up with bruises, to feeling as if the world had gone grey overnight, washed out by tears and sleepless nights. She knew that Sherlock had once been a little girl named Shyla, and she knew from that alone the detective arguably had enough ammunition with which he could likely justify a relapse.
“We are no one. No one at all.”
When John had been very, very small his Mother had once bundled Harry and him into the best (and only) Winter clothes they'd owned, sneaking them past their Father as he snored drunkenly on the sofa and outside into the hushed night of Christmas Eve. He could remember how she tugged them along lightly, the smell of cinnamon cider still on her breath and a smile on her tired face that he didn't get to see very much in those days warming her eyes to a light blue.
sadly before throwing the blanket around his huddled form. The Dragon muttered slightly, fighting sleep for a second longer as he looked at her with hazed blue-green eyes. His voice was soft and childish, and a thousand times more fragile than Sherlock would ever be willing to admit. Though the murmurs were in Dragon-Tongue, Mrs. Hudson understood the question asked completely.
Though John's Dragon was still mostly out of it, he responded to Molly's tiny whimpers with snarling and snapping, seeming to be too dazed to realize that his protests were useless given the fact that he was in a metal box with air holes drilled in it. The noises he made were horrific, and even Cerioth looked vaguely tetchy and nervous as they grew in volume, the Dragon's hands tightening minutely about the wheel. It was interesting, to see even other Dragon's flinch away from a Red Card. The Northern didn't seem to notice. Its Crate rocked savagely as the beast threw itself against the metal confinements again and again, and John worried to himself that he'd have to deal with bruising along its shoulders and neck when he got him.
. Keeping his voice low he ran soothing circles under the collar around Molly's neck, pleased when his Dragon slowly began to relax against him.
When John finally managed to pull his wrist away, there was a mark, a twisting Rune overlapping delicately about his skin. It circled about his arm, glowing a faint blue before dimming to black. Small, but intricately designed. It looked incomplete, but promised to be beautiful when whole. Hexagonal in nature, two or three patterns traced up his arm. Plain black, one with swirling designs that looped over each other, another as delicate as a snowflake. When he looked at Sherlock questioningly, the Dragon's eyes glowed with the same light. Blinking, the Dragon's only explanation left mysteries surrounding John's thoughts.
She was born amidst screaming and fear. That much, she could recall. She remembered waking to darkness, the four walls of an unknown closet, and she could remember yelling outside. She had been born in one of the care homes, in the middle of a brawl, really. John later would not remember why he was found tucked away tightly into one of the broom cupboards of the place, nor why he had insisted that “The Bad People” were going to hurt him. He wouldn't even remember who the people were, only that they had left him with yet another blackout and yet another feeling of distress and unease.
Things are beginning to reach the climactic part of this section of my story. We are coming to a close on John's war years. I hope you enjoy.
Sherlock scowled slightly, and his hands twitched as he fiddled absently with the cuff of his shirt. The crook of his arm tingled slightly in memory, and he had to bite the inside of his cheek in order to not recall how it felt to be gloriously strung out beyond any semblance of caring for this world. That was an unfair protest, he thought. Still, he could appreciate the loophole for its deceptive cleverness.
“I'm in my room.”
Reluctantly, he forced himself to admit that he had been very lucky, all considered. The bullet had been perilously close to his lungs and heart, and had missed any major arteries. Though the digging out of the bullet seemed to have been ugly, John could feel already the beginning stiffness of healing flesh. Most importantly, he was
He began, then actually bit his lip, as if he wasn’t sure what to say. John felt like he couldn’t get enough air into his lungs, a feeling of panic welling inside his chest and turning his breathing into harsh gasps. All he could think of was:
“Because
Sneak paused just at the door, eyes drawn to some invisible space on the floorboards in front of him. His words were so quiet, Sarah almost didn't catch them. Yet she somehow knew that even in a crowded room, she would have somehow heard.
andahar was attacked. Draski were launching a frontal assault in order to steal supplies that they hadn't successfully acquired from the army base on their previous raid.
“See that's the funny thing about my loyalty. Usually, it doesn't exist.....”
It wasn't even like he would take the boy as a bed slave, not when he had no need for such carnal pleasures. At least, not after tonight, when such things were mandatory to complete the ceremony. No, chances are Jounhin would merely become another unnecessary presence, hating Sherlock as much as he hated mortals but unable to leave, lingering in the marble halls of his palace. A promise to his Mother, and nothing more.
Outside, the world had turned white in a rare, large snowfall, much to Elena's apparent wonder. They walked to the park, and every few feet she'd stop, stilling long enough to fling herself into the snow with a giggle and a mighty shout, rolling in the cold, white crystals until she was completely soaked. John watched on in nostalgic happiness, remembering many a Christmas waking up to do the exact same thing with his older sister minding him. Sherlock looked on at his daughter behaviour with a mixed expression, wanting to be pleased, uncertain of what events would lie ahead.
"I skipped all of it. I already know the story, thanks to Aunt Molly's nostalgia marathons when I was little having forced me to watch The Lion King four times."
"Oh, practically everyone," said Ms. Stoner, "She was deaf in that ear, and would turn the other one towards whoever spoke to her. She explained to people she wanted to know, and plenty of people she didn't want to know demanded an explanation for why she wasn't looking at them."
John actually couldn't remember the plot of either drama well enough to point out a difference. He stalled for time by telling her "You'll read it anyway. Once I name one, you'll be grounded for skipping class." Rosie smirks at him, knowing he won't remember, but John suddenly realizes he doesn't need both plots, just one plot and a setting. "The murder methods were different," he said. "There aren't any massive trampling herds of wildebeest in Denmark."
"But nothing happened at the cafe. She ate dinner, bumped her hip, and didn't talk to anyone. It's depressing, but there's no motive for murder in it," argued Soames.
"Because I did read Hamlet after Dad stopped yelling at me Thursday." said Rosie. "And killing his dad would have been a lot harder than Shakespeare thought."
At the station, Sherlock and John piled up the evidence against Christiansen. The key. The scholarship. His knowledge of her bad ear. His knowledge of the bump on her thigh, making that side too tender to sleep on.
Ms. Stoner looked at Sherlock and John, and began.
Getting a look at Christiansen's keys proved to be supremely boring. They watched his building starting fifteen minutes before the end of his last class for hours on end. Finally, just when John was ready to give up and figure he wasn't coming home that evening, Giles showed up. Sherlock had the better angle on his hand as he locked up his bike, so John couldn't see, but Sherlock made a slightly satisfied noise next to him. "Three keys in the building's pattern, then?"
Sherlock smiled. "As to that, my daughter did her research. There's only so many ways to ingest a substance without it passing your lips. Julia Stoner just happened to have one more than most people."
Rosie, who hadn't left the room when Ms. Stoner came in, looked slightly interested at the mention of these findings "Did anyone who lived near her know about the eardrum?" she asked.
"I was just going back to the bio lab to check on my experiments, Dad. I came back once I had the cultures inoculated. I was actually in English, but I got there after Ms. Michaels took roll."
"Oh, yes," said Ms. Stoner. "I have a friend in the pathologist's office. She showed me the report. The swab was there, marked negative."
"Im lettting you have a look as a favor to Greg, but there's nothing to see," said Soames. "The girl killed herself."
"Yeah, but let's of guys' girlfriends don't have murder victims for roommates," countered Sherlock.  "You can tell our friend DI Soames the rest."
"We can now you, you arsehole. Press reports never specified strychnine.  Julia only knew that from her pathologist friend. Enjoy prison," said John.
"That's not an improvement," sputtered John. "You're not supposed to be in any of the labs without supervision, and I happen to know your biology teacher has her off period during your English class. - She called me during it once, but I couldn't call you about it because your schedule showed you in English."
"No,I just told her the experiments were a priority."
Three hours into the grounding on Saturday, John seriously regretted his decision. Rosie had gone into a massive sulk and was sitting in the chair, rolling her eyes at him and Sherlock, not speaking to either of them, and not bothering to touch the book. This had the potential to be a very long weekend. Nothing could have made him happier than evicting Rosie from the chair so a client could sit in it. He smiled as Sherlock started showing off to the client - finally an excuse.  "Ms. Stoner," said Sherlock ,"please say something more interesting than that you have a twin, whose jumper you're wearing - your size and a good color for you, but glitzier than you would buy for yourself-, that you came here by train even though you have a car, or that you skipped breakfast and lunch, making you shake slightly."
"Rosie, your turn, did you only skip the first few minutes of class - which just happened to contain the quiz - or did you skip the reading, too?"
Strangely, that was the question that broke Ms. Stoner down. "She was in her bed, on her side, looking at the wall. We shared a room as children. Mr. Holmes, she would never sleep that way. She couldn't sleep on her back or her stomach, and she was afraid to sleep facing the wall. The only way she would ever sleep was looking at the room. Her roommate says she's still the same way now. Mr. Holmes, please believe me. My sister was a happy person. She had a good shot at that scholarship half her floor was competing for. The police are wrong to say she took poison, went to sleep the wrong way, and died." She sobbed, destroyed by the realization.
The look at the crime scene was short, just long enough for Sherlock to see that the bed was in a corner. There was no difference between  the headboard and the footboard, with both being industrial metal railings, but the room itself helped to define the bed.
She hummed the tune then, the same the music box was still playing. It was the voice that John had heard, haunting and lovely at once.
) great grey clouds rolled into the sky, the moon that once washed out the square below becoming veiled as darkness descended over Recheinbach like a still breath. Like an eerie marionette show, everyone's dancing stopped. All heads turned expectantly towards the platform with the Water-Spirit standing, his palms turned up towards the heavens. Like a shivering whisper, the town chanted under their breaths, the sound like thousands of locusts humming just under the skin.

If John concentrated, he found that there was a disconcerting lurch in the back of his mind. Images that he knew did not come from his own mind drifted before his eyes, pictures and vague ideas of places he had never seen.
It was then that Sherlock glanced over, noticing the empty glass vial that lay discarded at his side. Forcing himself to blink away the burn of chlorine in his eyes, the detective made himself grip at his companion’s shoulders, determined to figure out Daniel’s state. Daniel, seeming to sense his question was quick to reassure.

He should have been the least likely to end up here, warm and safe and being looked upon with something akin to kindness. He didn't deserve it. Didn't even want it. What made him different from the other wretches, chained to their cages by collars and unable to break free, shocking devices driving them to their places in their cells?
were sometimes hard to block out, and John knew the sound of static his friend was most likely to hear at the Northern Dragon's puzzling words.
The mortal felt small in his arms, almost tiny. Though he had looked fierce enough even when chained and bound down below, now Sherlock could see that he had essentially been bound to a child, a boy. The shocking youth of his features looked up at him, as in unconsciousness the Spirit held him and used the edge of the ghastly bridal robe to smear away the paint that had covered him. Streaks of riotous red and blue came way, shimmering silver lining it. To Sherlock, it felt like clay between his fingers, ruddy and faintly oiled.
dared to question John's competence.
The next day came, and with it the stress from the past couple of nights seemed to dissolve like snow during Spring. The sun streamed through the curtains of John's room, rousing the army doctor from his rest slowly. John blinked, winced and rolled over sleepily. His mind was slow to remember the events of before, for a moment he was only aware of the delicious ache in his limbs and the warmth surrounding his body like a cocoon. He stretched, yawning hugely as he sat
She hated when her brother was like this.
“Someone's got an attitude don't they?” John murmured, but got to work quickly. Once again faced with the sluggishly bleeding infection, the soldier found himself thinking that he had gotten to it just in time. It looked slightly red and inflamed, and John figured a bath would be in order again tonight before the two of them went to bed. Trying
“You have your mother’s flame, but I’m pleased to say admittedly, my sister’s kindness, lurking in you. Something of her nature.” His hands reached out then, tipping Sherlock’s chin upwards so the light caught in the teen’s eyes, held it. Arthur smiled. “Don’t let your mother kill that kindness, no matter who you turn out to want to be in the future. Your mother forgets often now- what it’s like to feel
The child might have continued, if a voice hadn't called over the crowd, shouting a name that obviously belonged to her, given the way she reacted. A slightly older boy, likely the girl's brother by John’s guess, was standing on a wooden crate. His dark gaze was faintly disapproving as he called the girl's name again, cupping his hands to his lips.
And a moment later, Sherlock's high-pitched, animalistic
But secretly, John liked the clingy, sticky cuddling afterwards so much more. The way Sherlock would purr, and tell him in hushed tones all he wanted to show their daughter, and all he loved about John.
"Well maybe I'm just an exception."
in the morning.” His pale eyes flicked pointedly to Victor's feet, his smirk widening as he saw the clashing red and green cuffs peeking over his dormate's shoes. Victor chuckled, the sound low, but it cut off when he saw the material of Sherlock's shirt. Black silk. Fancy. His frown was small, strangely unsettling on his normally sunny face, and he looked up at Sherlock uncertainly.
Sherlock
Yet the next words were not what John had been expecting to hear his mum reply with, and they made him sway on the spot like a ship capsized as he watched her slump in defeat.
He'd spat at her, eyes flat and remote, and he'd turned away and looked out the window, watching the stars twinkle and shine in the dark.
Sherlock, scrambling back as if she had held her hand to a flame.

“How can suicides be serial?” John asked, his brow crunching in confusion.
Sherlock never did say it out loud.
And Sherlock found himself nodding, accepting even as those hands moved away, and Sneak straightened, voice quiet. His words took on that of a storyteller's, and he stared at his hands even as he began.
Sherlock, all but torn to pieces in an alley. Raped or beaten, his curls sticky and matted with blood. Thick, coagulant. The detective's coat burned, like Lizzie Adam's dress had been (the third victim). John waking to find the detective gone from his bed downstairs, thinking he had merely wandered off when in fact he had been drugged unconscious and kidnapped (Erren Brown, fifth victim). The dreams had cost John more than a few cups of tea and beauty sleep, and naturally Sherlock pretended not to notice. The detective focussed on the case with the keen senses of a cat, pushing further and harder than other cases in a cold and calculating desire to avenge that he had no idea he had possessed until now.
Sebastian checked upon him to find the young man binding his breasts with ace bandages, Sherlock staring at his own reflection as if for the first time, he were seeing something real.
That would never work.
Bloody hell, they had only known him for a few months and already they were
He was recalled back to life harshly, unfamiliar hands striking his chest in a brutal, clinical fashion, forcing the water from John’s lungs. It burned, and he did not wake easily, resisting it in the instinctive urge to avoid as much agony as humanly possible. Still the hands did not leave him be, not until nausea curled through the ex-army doctor, and he rolled over desperately to vomit up what felt like half the ocean from his stomach. Smooth stone met his knees as he did so, and dizzily John realised that he recognised the texture of it somewhere in the back of his mind. His leg ached from the cold, and the rest of him shuddered with it even as he breathed gratefully, the repeated inhalation of oxygen feeling like a blessed gift even as it burned.
and as if in apology for her earlier harsh mauling, bit John's arm. Only...
It soon came to be that John’s squadron was put on patrol outside the compound, directed by Wilkes to measure out the army’s borders. Not a particularly dangerous task, and one that John had been subjected to before a few times now with his companions. Yet it was the first ride in the jeep that had ever felt so tense, no one quite willing to make conversation or maintain eye-contact with John save for Murray. Bill mercifully seemed to pick up on the situation, and kept up a cheerful stream of mindless babble of his time spent on other postings, occasionally pausing to interject with a question or confirmation to his Dragon to make sure he wasn’t embellishing too deeply. Rin’s golden scales glinted in the desert sun every now and then, dazzling John’s eyes and lulling him into a kind of hypnotic calm. She spoke rarely aloud, but her voice was comforting in his head, and she was clever enough to even keep wit with Sherlock. This was rather fortunate, as the Northern Dragon had a habit of getting tetchy on long drives.
Instead it was a different kind of shiver, one that left the Dragon feeling warm and coiled tightly like a spring, wanting suddenly to take to the air and fly and never touch the ground again and taste the clouds as they form in the early morning air. The kind of hum one got from having their wings touched by the kiss of sunrise as you coasted far above the rest of the world.
The maid found Shyla hours later, curled up back in her bathtub. The girl's comforter was wrapped about her tightly, seemingly the only thing holding her in place. In Shyla's hands was the family photo that normally sat bolstered against her wall. The darkly-curled girl was slowly cutting it into strips, watching the photograph sink into the water around her. To the maid's distressed inquiry, Shyla merely intoned a dull and distant “Experiment.”
“I’ve been told I’m not the greatest listener, but I’d be willing to try.”
John is struck with the need to prove his physical presence, and his lips find the plush lower half of that cupid’s bow, the plane of a sharp cheekbone, the column of Sherlock’s neck. He lingers there, sucking a mark in a sudden fit of possession, all teeth and lips and tongue. Sherlock’s knees buckle slightly, threatening failure even as the back of John’s knees hit the edge of the bed. This doesn’t deter the army doctor much, and he pulls Sherlock forward without much though, the taller man falling on top of him in a sudden fit of clumsiness that is both sweet and somewhat hilarious.
John had heard of nymphs and their kind, mostly stories from his grandparents about how they once inhabited the rivers and oceans that had once surrounded Reichenbach. Tales of beautiful maidens and men that would bask upon stones in the water and sing strange melodies came to him like the lingering flavour of a long forgotten wine.  It marked his thoughts, and it made John wary of the creature’s hands, delicate but tipped with webbings and predatory claws. It was an homage to her potentially dangerous nature. Though, John supposed if Molly had left him alone in the pool, the mermaids weren’t known for drowning humans.
kind went and got involved with Fae, and the next thing we knew a contract had been forged. Your numbers wouldn’t deplete so if you hadn’t gotten meddlesome. Now we starve for most of the year, only to gorge ourselves come this night.” The Demon wasn’t sure why he was explaining secrets of his kind’s history, but the timbre of his voice seemed to calm the small human beneath him, even if it was subconsciously.
The file read
Raz's voice was so soft, John almost thought he didn't hear his apology. The quiet “Be well, John” was lost in the wail of the wind, and lightning crashed, blinding everyone momentarily with white-blue light. When John blinked the spots from his eyes, he was standing before the Water-Spirit, looking at him for the first time as he crouched chained and bound like an animal brought to slaughter. The young man's eyes were wide and terrified, but his chin was clenched in an act of defiance, and though destruction seemed to threaten and tremble in the very air, John's voice was loud and clear. The lines he had been forced to learn branded themselves on his tongue, and though he knew they must be said, he spit them at the unearthly figure's feet as if he were hurling throwing knives.
Her smirk of pity was left unseen.
of crinoline and soft flounces, overly ornate.
John dreamed of a sun rising, pale and gold and elegant on his cheeks, warm. Like a blazing medallion it struck the water, burning the ocean hotly and setting it sparkling like a rare jewel. He squinted against its glare, and to his surprise a whuffling came from his parted lips,

"Now. Explain to me why the fuck I shouldn't kill you as soon as we get back to the flat."
Angry words, words John knew he wasn't supposed to know the meaning of and yet did.
The egg was cold.
Sherlock had chosen dark colours, things that reflected against his pale skin and made it seem downright translucent. A pair of dark black trousers, tucking in a shirt that was a deep plum purple, the colour of an African Violet. Over that ensemble, he had chosen a charcoal
“I'm sorry.....H-How did you-”
Besides which, Molly wasn’t so sure it was war memories that threw her off. She was instead thrown by the sensation of being subhuman once more. People did not look her in the eye at the store, and when she left the house she was expected to be collared. The fabric of it was softer than those in the army, but it still felt as though it were a noose, choking her. This she couldn’t bear to tell Mike, if only because it would have broken his heart. There was nothing the man could do, freedom useless when Molly had no education besides what she had been able to scrounge, and no real means of a livelihood. At one time, it wouldn’t have bothered her. She wondered what had changed, why her skin now felt too tight and her scales too chafing.
John could only assume was the infamous
Lungs burning, John kicked upwards for air, watching as the sinuous flick of the creature’s tail mimicked his upwards ascent. His head breaking water, he heaved in gulps of oxygen. John’s eyes opened to find a dark, playful face peering up at him, dark eyes blinking coquettishly. He stepped back, resisting the urge to stumble and fall back away into the water.
You very nearly killed half the town!”

“It’s nothing I haven’t done before.”
They were approached by a nurse in military garb, the glint of her collar giving away her rank even as she greeted them with a timid sort of bow. Her wave of dark hair was expertly pinned back, twisted into elaborate braids that were still professional even while being beautiful. The Dragon's almond-shaped eyes were dark like the colour of midnight, filled with distance and calm. Thankfully, her tongue was not cut, though she bore the bearing of a breed from the Asian slave trade.
Night time.
Unease.
either. His instincts were beginning to take over, and they demanded that he view any protection as good protection.
She stroked the Dragon’s scales tenderly, a wordless thanks. John was not surprised when the Dragon lifted its head, speaking aloud.
“John.”
But not John.
His sister's face became veiled with a grin that flashed lightning. Radiating pure and open joy.

Still....

She snapped her fingers, breaking Morganite out of her stupor.
Greg had been prepared for the sudden lunge to happen, yet he still found himself staggering when the teen launched themselves, trying to duck under his arms and utterly failing. The D.I struggled as the boy all but shrieked like a barn cat that had its tail pulled, snarling out curses even as Greg pinned him to the ground, attempting to reach along his belt loops for his handcuffs. It was just as his left hand brushed cool metal that the boy reared unexpectedly- one last final effort to break free. Unthinking, the D.I had used his right arm to hold him down, hooking it around his chest to press his knee more firmly against the teen’s tailbone.
The creature rolled the name in his head, trying to shape it to his underwater dialect. When he hesitantly tried to sound it out, John couldn't help but giggle slightly. Because what came from the boy's lips was a horrible garble of sound, coming out vaguely to sound like
Molly had attempted to comfort him, to engage in conversation, but John had been reluctant to engage, utterly despondent towards the idea of making friends in such a place. Instead, he had found himself cataloguing the layout of the room, searching in vain for some kind of hope, some kind of iota of something recognisable.
but that’s no large issue in the grand scheme of things.”
and still he leaned forward, greedily accepting the touch. Craving it. He hated the way his skin pressed against John's. Loved it more than anything else. The strange scent that was the army doctor- a unique and interesting blend of gun-oil, tea and shampoo- filled the detective's lungs. He inhaled for more, paralysed. Yet desperate to move away. For John was saying this, murmuring things, and his words sent a sharp pain of something
She murmured to him even as she'd looked up at John's face through the pale fan of her lashes, and the young boy already drunk on wine and more than a little bit overwhelmed found himself foolishly making promises.
“Those two are going to be dangerous together. She always fills his head with such meaningless tales. He's getting older, I hope he doesn't take them so seriously any more. Last time she told him about the elves that live in people's gardens, and he spent the entire week digging up my flowers in search of them.”
The wolf continued, seeing Irene’s dismay “This will be a farce. You will convince him that you love him, that he loves
“Your face will freeze like that, if you keep that up.”
"My condolences, John. I didn't mean to get too carried away… It's just I've missed your grandmother so and when I saw your face… We were childhood friends, John. It's hard, having everyone leave you. If you know what I mean."
People didn't mention how
John came home and the detective looked up, and for a moment the Dragon's eyes widened in a fear that was not logical as much as instinctive. The detective curled about the egg in his chair, a snarl reaching his parted lips. He waited for yelling. He waited for his Mate to turn against his child-
This was better than the detective had hoped for. He hadn't planned on broaching the subject of the other personalities with Claude, but if she knew why some of them acted the way they did, why John's psyche thought them necessary to his survival, then perhaps he could help before he'd even fully gotten started with breaking down their personalities into a file within his head. He smiled at John, earning a grin from the child inside, and his voice was warm and soothing as he nodded back towards the chair across from him.
” He asked in some surprise, and his daughter looked at him, a spark of possessiveness in her gaze.
could be read into it even by John. The old woman sipped at her drink daintily before continuing.
John’s face scrunched into a look of suspicion and confusion, as if he wondered if this was some kind of trick question. His tone of voice made Sherlock feel stupidly foolish as he responded, his voice laden with what could only be described as blatant incredulity.
“L-let's get out of here.”
Unwillingly, a shiver rippled up John’s spine, and his eyes closed. He felt himself being dragged into the darkness. Sleep was calling to him a sweet lullaby. When John opened his eyes again, there was a glitter in those dark blue irises that hadn’t been there before.
, sleep tugging the Dragon firmly. She pulled on his hand gently, no longer quite so worried he'd attack her in a moment's notice, laying him out gently on the floor before standing to grab an afghan and some pillows. When she returned, she
As always, thanks to my lovely beta, Tpurr!! you are fantastic and amazing. Thank you for all you do.
Sherlock's scales were as mottled brown as the dust that filled the air, sand and grime filling John's lungs and vision and causing him to cough blearily. The taste of grit lined the back of his teeth, and a hollow ringing in his ears was the first thing the soldier came to acknowledge as he pried his eyes opened and attempted to see past the mass of scale and wings sheltering him like a sinuous cave.
without his clothes. It was a luxury he had recently started to take for granted, and mentally he cursed himself for his own foolishness. Seeming to sense his unease, lieutenant Dodge tilted her chin towards the entrance to the tent.
John’s voice roughly answered, even as his fingers twitched in reluctant longing.
It was two days before they were expected to be posted that Sherlock's wings finally looked healthy enough to fly. John woke that morning to hear the great, sweeping noises of Sherlock stretching the leathery appendages in and out experimentally, the thin membrane between each outline of the structure glowing a blazing blue in the morning sun. He stood in the living room, gazing pensively outside. There was a restless energy within the Dragon, a contained and restrained hyperactivity. Both John and Sherlock had been skirting about this day, knowing it would happen soon. The oil had done a good job of healing the Dragon's wing, the only visible remnant the pale silver scar. His powerful wing muscles were still weak, yet hadn't atrophied during the creature's forced grounding. This was in part because Sherlock remained fairly active whilst in captivity, and partly due to the fact (as Sherlock explained in a bored tone of voice) that during the summer Northern Dragons “
Yet each time, that voice was drowned out by the memory of smooth seal pelt under his hands, and by the haunting lilt of a melody half-forgotten from childhood, swiftly gaining clarity the longer he listened to its croon from upstairs.
And evidently, Sherlock wasn't even aware.
John flushed a bright red, hastily scribbling down the strange teen’s name on the mug. He set it aside for Greg to handle, manning the cash register as he muttered the charge. “That’ll be two pounds thirty.”
It glowed soft gold around everything it touched, like the pixie dust that Harriet had used to love so much in her precious copies of

Sneak's smile was languid as he laughed, shaking his head in faint disagreement as he replied “No, you wound up on the
Those blue eyes sparkled, and the man lifted his head and purred.
Though John couldn't see the faint trembling in Sherlock's frame, he could hear the wavering in his voice. Clasping his hands loosely together between his knees, the ex army doctor felt a small smile curl his features. It was tinged with the sadness over the fact that Sherlock felt like he had to ask, request that he be allowed to be himself within the walls of his own home.
“When you say dangerous.... How dangerous do you mean?”
What Mrs. Hudson had apparently not told John when he had moved into
He had been ten at the time.
Sorry it's been a while, I was on a lovely vacation for a bit in Malta! :3 Really enjoyed it actually! Hope you like the chapter!
The thought made him want to kick himself. Now was not the time for despair.
Another crack of thunder, and this one was filled with a terrible finality. The Water-Spirit spun on his heel, stalking towards the door. His entire posture screamed an end to the conversation, bellowing for Molly to escort his ‘ignorant clod of a brother’ and his betrothed, respectively either out of his temple or to his rooms. The small, mouse-haired servant squeaked past the Spirit while he stalked angrily out, her brown eyes wide with despair as she looked at the pair, now sitting at a meal that had gone mostly cold.
he was still seeing spots of black in his vision. He worked to keep the adrenaline out of his voice, so often misconstrued as anger.
It was excitement, a craving to chase the dangerous.
No engravings whatsoever.
Upon John’s return to his tent, several things became evident to his notice almost immediately. The first, and most immediate was Sherlock. The Dragon all but crowded him upon his return, glazed eyes narrowed in focus that quickly became just a little too close for comfort. John found himself backing up even as Sherlock invaded the previous barriers that they had wordlessly at some point agreed upon, the Dragon inhaling deeply along the line of John’s neck, breath warm and slightly sweet. It took John a second to remember Xavi’s words and touch, echoing in the back of his mind.
Claude fancied herself rather gifted at reading people.
Sneak closed his eyes, and pretended to fall asleep. If only so he could be held a moment longer, if only so he could feel the fogged-up glass-like version of love still permeating through the marrow of his bones. Like a gecko, curling up on a rock so that he might feel the distant flavour of a long-set sun.

“It would be the events that would ultimately, lead Sherlock to finding Gregory Lestrade.”
, I can swim just
There was really no catch at all.
She pretended not to feel the
The wailing was nearly inhuman.
The drugs had brought the whole sensation tumbling down though. He had come crashing arse over ears off his throne of power, only to land at the feet of his brother and his hatefully worried scowl. Mycroft had taken away his freedom, claiming such things as ‘love’ and ‘worry’, which was laughable coming from The Ice Man. Sherlock had found himself chained, tied to another person to the point of not being able to spit without a dozen CCTV cameras watching him closely. And it killed him, destroyed a part of him and made him hate a lack of control
If Sherlock was tired, he didn't much show it. Instead those light blue eyes looked out sharply from his frame of raven curls, cut short once again the other night so that his ears stuck out rather awkwardly. They swept their gaze over the other Dragons that also stood at attention behind their Masters, noting and mentally calculating each of their strengths and weaknesses.
“Got what was necessary. Now. Breakfast.”
“You're free to try. But I have a taser on me, and something tells me you're smart enough to realize that if John woke up feeling like he just became scrambled eggs he might be a little annoyed.”
He also knew without a doubt that he’d be getting a clue any day now. It was simply Moriarty’s way, the puzzles and the riddles all having one aim, one goal: to attract Sherlock’s attention.
Standing in his usual pristine suit, Sherlock swayed gently by the window of Baker Street, his chin tilted to cup his violin as with deft fingers he drew his bow across strings pressed gently to their neck. The sound that came from the violin was low and sweet and sad, aching, and John felt his throat tighten from it even as he looked the detective over frantically, trying to gauge if he was okay. The detective looked thinner, and more tired than John had ever seen before. As if he hadn't slept once over the course of the four nights he had disappeared into his room. Dark purple smudges marked the underside of Sherlock's cerulean gaze, and the man seemed determined not to look at his companion as he continued to play the piece to its completion. It was only when the song finished with a mournful key that John even realised what surrounded the detective's feet. Packed bags greeted him, and the army doctor felt his heart leap into his throat as without further hesitation he rose, blocking the doorway with the physical manifestation of his body.
my interest.”
“We’ve got Vultures coming at us!” Death-types, then. Ones that thrived not on violence but murder. John once again reached for his quiver, knowing it was going to be a long and gruelling evening.
For a second the waves were still silent, save for their gentle lapping against the rock and Sherlock's bare toes. The salt-flecked droplets of water dripped from his hair in pearly orbs, and his curls as they dried sprung away from his face to snarl themselves together and give him an expression of a wild animal poised for hunting. Then, a ripple in the water, and the edge of a tail striking the waves to propel a creature forward, and Sherlock found himself eye to eye with a large, dark brown seal.
Love...
So, instead I suggest you don’t struggle and instead offer the one thing that might make this better.”

Mycroft loved it, he loved every second of having someone younger than him to teach.
Wilkes' gaze was sharp as he looked at Bill with an expression of smugness and bullying cruelty.

Then Sherlock dove, dropping like a stone out of the sky and forcing the last lingering feeling of disgust in his imminent future to stay behind, somewhere in the air. Reaching into himself, he drew out his own hunger, his nostrils flaring and his eyes slitting. He braced himself for landing, inhuman legs absorbing the hard shock of his feet touching down onto the platform of the gate. His tail, a long and barbed thing, went wide behind him and provided balance. His long fingers were a white contrast against the darkness of the wood beneath him. Sherlock straightened slowly, cat-like and noiseless as his head craned about, seeking out a suitable target.
And Moriarty leaned onto the balls of his feet, eyes glinting as he hissed.

Growling in frustration, Greg finally set the offensive mobile down, running frustrated fingers through his hair. The lingering weight of half a dozen fitful nights weighed on him heavily, causing an ache along his spine and a pressure headache in the front of his skull.
“This childish feud has gone on long enough, brother mine. People have begun to suffer. People
unintentionally prolonging the pleasure. The detective writhed, spilling into John’s mouth, and then later on the sheets as his partner moved away, stroking him through the aftershocks. Finally, Sherlock slumped back onto the bed, the last of his orgasm melting his limbs into compliant jelly. He stared up at the ceiling in a dead pant, hardly believing that what had just occurred had come to pass.

you. You can feel their pain and their joy and their memories… most people cry, the first time.”
himself out of the fusion so brutally that John felt a physical ache with the sensation.
Sherlock's voice had sounded distant even in his own ears. Surrounded by shattered dishware, his knuckles bloody and bruised, he likely looked like he was made of the coldest of stone. Yet he felt like he was molten lava. Unformed. Out of control. His voice lowered to a whisper. “I have no friends.”
