“Well, we thought I should tell you before, you know, you see it and freak out”, Sam continued, a weak smile on his lips. Steve was getting really nervous about this. What was wrong?
Steve had managed to deny him sex for almost a week now. Only because he fell in love with his own merchandise. And maybe because he wore this jumpsuit while both of them were at home. Inwardly, he shied while outwardly placed soft butterfly kisses on Steve’s skin. Very persuading normally.
Disclaimer:
“Not today”, Sam sounded sorry and Steve raised an eyebrow. How very interesting. “But maybe another time”, Sam’s smile was bright and encouraging and Steve could feel how Bucky next to him was as cheerful as a child on Christmas day.
For whatever reason, Tony had never assumed him to be the all innocent blond haired blue-eyed guy from somewhere behind the moon. It was pleasant to talk to somebody who had no expectations towards him. So somehow, those words slipped from him after they had spent a fairly long-time drifting from sleep to consciousness and back. He was surprised by it himself. Maybe, he considered, he’d said it because right now, it felt like they could be…
Sam looked confused for a second, then a grin appeared on his face. "That's what I offered"
Shit, was all Steve could think in that moment. And he never cursed. He answered nothing, trying to look on the ground and acting like he couldn’t hear the brown-haired guy speaking.
“No”, the other man said annoyed, “why do you even want to talk that much?”
The other- Sam- only laughed and rolled his eyes: “Wow, you are indeed able to speak”, he gave him a pat on the back, “you know what I’m talking about.”
Steve raised his head again, looking directly in Tony’s eyes because what else could he lose?
He scooted closer: “You can whisper if you feel more comfortable” Steve only sat there in shock. Now he was sure that there should be no amount of alcohol that made a sane man like himself sleep with somebody like Tony Stark. But apparently, there was such an amount- which added to the fact that Tony Stark itself was a pleasing sigh. The one thing that stopped the blonde from turning crazy was Sam’s elbow. And the light pain that came with it meeting his side.
“Maybe you should rethink your idea of sex”, he spat out and tried to angrily glare at the other. It was working but instead of reacting equally angry Tony only licked his lips: “That’s exactly what I am talking about”, he said and stressed every word. “But if you are not interested”, his voice got cunning and his smile turned into poison, “I can wait until you come crawling back to me”
“Yes, we have”, Tony interrupted him and flipped the page. Steve was furious. Normally he did not care at all if people were ignoring him or not. But in this situation, he felt like he couldn’t stand Tony a second longer.
“I spare my cusswords for special people”, Steve spat out, but he couldn’t suppress the playful smile on his lips. He felt himself reminded of how exactly they ended up here.
There was an awkward moment of silence before Tony asked way too excited and with an enthusiastically attitude: “Do I get payback for the last days?”
“That’s great I guess”, Steve felt relieved on one hand, yes, but on the other, it kind of disappointed him that Tony didn’t offer more, hadn’t even mentioned it.
“Mh?”, was all the Steve managed to reply and Sam looked even more concerned than before. Bucky just shook his head once yet his eyes told a very different story from his rather calm demeanor. If Tony Stark now appeared in front of his car, Bucky would have most likely run him over without a second thought. Steve wasn’t sure whether he was glad or sad that this did not happen.
As far as I have plotted this story out, there are only one or two (depending on whether I will split it in two parts or not) more chapters before this fic ends. Which would make this the first longer story I ever completed (which is absolutley amazing!!!)
“You”, Steve spat, emphasizing the word like poison, “were the one crawling back to me first.”
“What the hell are you doing here?”
I was pretty busy finishing my book (had a bet whether I would manage to write it until New Year's Eve) but now I finally found time to continue writing on this (I totally missed it).
He grinned and winked at the other, his whole body acting with his statement, rubbing against Steve’s. Steve was torn between hating and adoring him. As always. He felt Tony hovering above him once again, controlling his body by being above him and decided that he was not one to steal control from so easily. He clashed their mouths together, partly because he wanted to, partly because he needed to distract Tony somewhat. His hands settled back on Tony’s hips, where they seemed to be most of the time as he had already left red spots, and swapped their positions in one fluent motion, kneeling above Tony now, all innocent smiles. It took Tony only a swift second to adjust to the new situation and within a few moments his face featured a grin again.
“I’m full of surprises”, Steve joked and tried to look especially mysterious. Sam only kept laughing.
"Which one was that?", he asked after he had drunk everything. He tried to sound angry because he indeed was angry, but at the end it came out as curiosity.
“Interested in an orgasm?”, a rough, seductive voice breathed right into Steve’s ear. He flinched and felt goosebumps running down his spine. It should be forbidden for everybody to talk in such a tone. Especially if your name was Tony Stark.
Whereas the anger was slowly drying out, leaving him empty, the ache was still present. Bucky tried to beat Tony up the second day Steve looked like attending a funeral when they drove to school. Sam stopped him. Steve wasn’t sure if he should care. Later, he did realize that beating Tony up would have probably been the worst solution possible. Yet, at least it would have been some solution.
“Is this your way of telling me that you’re bored?”, he asked and glared at Steve.
Normally. But today Steve only chuckled: “Nice try Tony.”
“Are you sure you can resist?”, Tony whispered right into Steve’s ear. His voice was raw and seductive and his fingers once again rested on the other’s waist. His grip was probably a bit too firm but he was need and – even though he didn’t want to admit it – desperate.
I hope you liked Sam. The next chapter is going to be longer again, so that's an excuse for this one being so short.
"I'll call Bucky then", he already dialed the number while they rose from their chairs.
“Oh God”, he moaned, “That was not fair”
The moment Tony's body really moved, bucking himself into Steve, simulating little thrusts, Steve lost it. A low, suppressed moan escaped him, and Tony just did it again. His fingers started to move, caressing his skin and holding him still, keeping him at the mercy of the other. He had had (having some dark secrets Steve) lap dances before, but he never wanted to tear somebody's clothes of right at the beginning.
“No”, he wanted to reply. Badly. But he couldn’t. He had started this mess and he should end it. He would stand the laughter, the mockery. Yet, his breath still caught in his throat when he answered, his voice raw and almost inaudible. “Yes”
Tony seemed to nod but still kept still, not pushing him over the edge, not letting him come. That bastard. He even made him curse. And beg.
“I would not have put it this way, but yes”, Pepper finally stopped her full-on assault and relaxed against the closest wall.
Every time Tony snapped his hips up, bringing their crotches together, rubbing himself against the other body, his breath hitched and his muscles tensed. His fingers formed into fists and his nails pressed into his skin. No matter how much he tried to swallow them down, little moans and pleas fled his mouth. And Tony enjoyed it. His face showed triumph.
30 minutes later, he was covered in sweat and his hands were aching. It was a good ache accompanied with the painful way his lungs constricted on to less air and his skin burned from the exhaustion. He was still punching against the punching bag, not caring if his knuckles were split open in the process or not. Because it felt good. Because whilst he didn’t imagine Tony’s face, he could just let go. All of his anger, his suffering and desperation, his heartbreak, all of it turned into energy and the relentless way his fists collided with the hard leather. God, it felt so good to be angry and to be able to relief said anger at the same time.
Tony nearly killed them with his angry stares before he got up from his chair.
With a bit of luck and alcohol they would probably come up with different things to talks about. Preferably their own love life. He saw how they looked at each other when they thought nobody would notice. And hopefully, if there was something like fairness in this world, they would start a relationship so that Steve could spread out their sex life in public as bittersweet revenge.
Steve ignored him in favor of banging against said door, cursing silently under his breath. He was not going to do this. Hell, he wasn’t even sure what this was supposed to be, why his friends were involved in this. This whole situation was just ridiculous.
“Maybe I mentioned it”, Steve’s opponent shrugged his shoulders indifferently. He made a pause, his mouth curving up again in one of his vain smiles. Scanning Steve’s body and spat out “What a waste” before he turned around and left, head up high and not at all guilty or reasonable.
Tony grinned and even chuckled, his breath hot and close when he talked. “So desperate, aren’t you?”, he asked and applied more pressure to Steve’s chock, giving all the friction Steve wanted – and needed.
Steve was used to being on the edge around Tony, torn between want and hate, and slowly, without himself admitting it, also between lust and true affection. It was not that kind of affection one would offer a love interest, maybe not even that kind of affection one would offer a friend, but he slowly grew fond of the other. They sometimes talked afterward, Tony lazily sprawled all across the sheets (or whatever they had been using) and Steve about to leave but caught in a chat. Steve couldn’t remember why they had started talking in first place but it had surprisingly been interesting and even fun.
“So have we-?”, he asked even though he already knew the answer. He hadn’t drunk enough to forget.
“You may have been successful this time.”
“No, no details!”, Steve was close to jumping from his chair and putting a hand on Sam’s mouth, “we are certainly not discussing any details in public!”
I hope you enjoy
"Friends, right?", Sam replied.
He felt the grin on his face before his thoughts had settled on it. Nevertheless, it felt good to be the one grinning. Tony saw it. His eyebrows rose but Steve left him no time to say something.
Sam and Bucky had started to behave differently too. Or maybe he just started imaging stuff.
“I love being a tease”, Tony said sharp and challenging, “so if you want me to stop, you have to make me”
This time, he was gifted with another of Tony’s long, intense stares that made him moan and whimper all at the same time. He had never met a person before that could give looks like this. It was not exactly a dirty smile. It was suggestive and so very, very promising. And it went with hands that finally opened his trousers and lips that danced over his treasure trail. It felt like a relief and even more torture all at the same time.
“I think we already talked plenty enough”, Steve spat, turning around, leaving the mess he created and Tony alone.
“You really know how to drive me crazy”, Steve said, his voice dark and praising. Tony only hummed in content, his lips caressing the sensitive skin on Steve’s neck, coaxing a blissful moan from him.
As always, comments are appreciated.
Pepper laughed: “The last time I checked, you two had a thing going on, that kind of does make you responsible”
They stayed like that for enough time so Steve could dose of for a couple of minutes. When he woke up again, Tony was looking at him thoughtfully. There was a soft expression in his eyes that was so unlike everything Steve had seen before. At least not on Tony’s face. But as soon as Steve shifted a bit (his arm tugged somewhere beneath Tony had fallen asleep) the other’s expression changed back to normal.
Steve’s hands had now reached the zipper of the jumpsuit and the other pulled it down with such force it could have torn. The air hitting Tony’s body wasn’t cold but chilling and he moaned loudly, encouraging Steve to go further. He used the moment of stillness between them to wrap his hand around Steve, crashing their lips together while his hands slid under Steve’s shirt and followed the line of the other’s muscles before he paid more attention to his ass. Steve only snarled and shot him a glare, his lips leaving angry bruises all over Tony’s skin.
“You’re not some little school boy, you either touch me or you don’t”. Tony teased.
Steve sighed. School couldn’t get any worse than this. Nobody was more curious than his mother anyways.
The door was closed and something doomed to him. Something that smelled like betrayal.
And he wanted it a lot. More than he’d ever admit or realize. There was curiosity there, plus the fact that sex without the necessity of overwhelming tenderness was something he needed and wanted all at the same time.
He paused a moment and Steve felt sinful lips on his neck, followed by painful teeth on his bare skin. "Or would you rather sign that contract?”
Tony couldn’t suppress a greedy moan. It had been far too long. Far too long for patience. He happily moved against the touch, encouraging Steve to go faster, further. Steve complied, his lips crashing on Tony’s once again, their kiss full of hot lust and desire. Tony hummed into it the moment Steve’s finger entered him, his body all too eager to respond to the touch. He still wanted more. He tried to struggle beneath Steve’s touch, connecting their bodies even further. Steve hold him down, stilled him, left him only at the mercy of that single finger curling inside of him, making him see stars.
Maybe it had become more, a weird kind of friendship, driven by the familiarity they felt for each other - despite the urge to kill one another. But when Steve had seen Tony with Pepper - who was indeed famous for being Tony Stark’s beautiful, smart on-off- girlfriend - he had felt his heart aching. He hadn’t been expecting that. And he felt stupid for not having known before. Maybe he had just refused to acknowledge it because he had liked the illusion of being the only one for Tony.
Steve managed a tiny but honest smile. It felt good to know that he was not alone.
“Is something bothering you?”, the other asked and there was something like concern in his voice. Honestly? Steve wanted to laugh. He did not because he felt weaker than he had hoped he would.
Bucky as well as Sam looked somewhat displeased and Steve kind of sensed that they wouldn’t stop picking on him unless he gave them something better to discuss. He turned around and waved for the waiter, ordering them another round of drinks.
The crowd started laughing and whispering and some of the brave ones dared to come up with mean stuff on their own. Steve felt his face redden and could hear his knuckles cracking so hard did he try not to beat anybody. And beating meant in this case a serious injury by somebody who had to chop wood since he was old enough to handle an ax (old-fashioned parents for sure).
He got one immediately. The other’s eyes followed his every movement and a delightful smirk appeared on Tony’s face. It only spread and became a terrifying yet sinful grin: “I don’t pay them”, his voice was nothing more than an intense, suggesting whisper now. “I make them sign a contract”
Tony seemed to have recovered, and judged by his arrogant smile he was chocky-himself again. “No stamina left?”, he teased his smile spread into a grin.
“I’m wasting your time?!”, Steve snapped, “You think it’s me?!”
“And I thought you don’t swear”, Tony interrupted him, a playful smile on his lips, “am I corrupting you?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Their lips collided and there was no gentle kissing but a rough battle, intensified by their hands traveling the other’s body. He could feel fingers again on his shirt, moving up and down his bare back, pulling him closer and scratching his skin. He could feel his own hands settling on Tony’s waist where they fit so perfectly he almost assumed they were made to lay there, pressing Tony harder against him, leaving marks and bruises. If there had ever been reason in his mind, it all had vanished with the door closing. Tony’s kisses where a tease, half a smirk, half teeth trying to bite his lips. Steve did the same. Their bodies moved against the wall and Steve was not sure if it was him pushing Tony roughly against it or if it was Tony pulling him against himself. Probably both. However, he couldn’t care less. Tony moaned in their sloppy kiss, his hands now traveling along the inside of his tights, making Steve shiver. Tony sensed it and smirked, moving painfully slow, closer and closer to Steve’s crotch.
“Oh, I think that’s very much what we’re discussion right now”, Tony insisted, his fingers drawing lines around the form of Steve’s body, ready to tease or touch, to confuse Steve. Tony knew what he had to do. But Steve knew him too and they had been together for so long he’d learned to resist. And to fight back.
Tony smiled, his eyes dilated and lips parted slightly. “I’m so sorry”, he breathed out ironically and that was enough to send Steve over the edge of control. He felt the firmness of the grip on his hands increasing, felt Steve’s body pressing him into the wall and then fingers probing at his entrance.
My exams are over too so I had time to go over it again. I hope you enjoy because I definitivley enjoyed writing it!
“You are jealous”, Tony interrupted him, a statement that could have been cruel hadn’t it been a simple statement of fact. Steve felt himself flinch. There was no mockery or tease in it.
“You really are a sex addict”, Steve shook his head, rolling his eyes.
Steve was unable to look away, captivated by Tony's aura. He was impassive, just sitting there, waiting. His mind seemed to have blackout, all his thoughts were solely focused on this swinging hips and the hypnotizing shine in Tony's eyes. He felt like prey that was cornered by a predator, taken aback by surprise, fear and deep inside excitement.
“Considering all the things you’ve done, I’m surprised to see you embarrassed and scared of other people’s opinion.” Steve only snarled and then left the room. He was not scared of the other people’s opinions but he despised being the centre of public rumors. All he wanted now was some quiet because the chance of finding any friends in this big, cold city was about zero. And he definitely preferred being alone over being part of the “People Tony fucked”-list.
“Seems so”, Steve replied and the grin on his face was even a tad scary. Tony only laughed, low and husky, his hands already unbuttoning Steve’s trousers. He felt Steve’s body ache with need, similar to the way his body ached with it, knew that they had denied sex to each other for too long for an appropriate foreplay. He pulled the trousers down in one go, his fingers brushing over Steve’s tights and hard-on. He watched the other’s reaction closely as he started to rule against Steve’s erection. Steve moaned loudly, his hands tightening around Tony’s body, his head buried in the curve of Tony’s shoulder and neck.

...And he hated the idea of anything that might delay getting to Bucky. Somewhere, Steve knew that he was only just holding his composure together on that one. That his patience and determination were built around these deadlines. That he was already spending so much of his energy trying to ignore that imagined torture chamber - and, now, those remembered screams… That he might break and ruin everything, if something forced him to wait.
All of his attention was focused on Tony’s lips, on the small of his back now, Tony’s hands stroking over his ass, spreading him open. Steve felt himself moan, parting his legs without thinking, arcing his back-
This most forbidden of thoughts, this most secret desire…

“And then?” Tony asked, weary now.

“You’re more scared of me right now than I am of you” Adam sneered.
Tony felt an ache in his entire body, and had no idea what to call it. He’d been replaying that moment, over and over, all night. Always with a flinching pain in this stomach, and a general feeling of shame… But this time it felt different.
...And Tony hated himself for thinking of that as something he shouldn’t get his hopes up over – or as something he would hope for, at all.
...But if that was the result of a… blood compatibility, or something…
He let that feeling tug him forward, a tingling release rolling up his legs as he fell into step. His shoulders loosened, allowing a warm, watery sensation to soak up through his muscles, rushing to fill the gap.
In that same mocking, musical tone. Steve had the same urge to clench his fists.
“Trouble sleeping?” Nick enquired wryly, casting a knowing eye over Steve’s tensed muscles. Steve huffed a little breath of acknowledgement, and stepped back - but didn’t loosen his shoulders. Out of spite.

thing–
“Well, yes, there’s that,” Tony laughed, shyly. “And… I… I was going to talk to you about something, is all…”
“Oh, nothing bad – I just keep feeling… I don’t know, they almost feel like muscle cramps? In my shoulder, mostly…”
For as long as Tony was saying he was fine with it, Steve could only guess how he really felt. Whether he’d fucked this up by embarrassing Tony or scaring Tony or angering Tony – if Tony was annoyed over his unprofessional behaviour or unnerved to think of how Steve might think of him… At least if Tony yelled at him, Steve would have a start. There’d be less chance of him spectacularly missing the point, if Tony yelled the point at him first.

A little voice in his head whispered,

Tony got most of his donations under the pretence of scientific research rather than medical transfusions, so he was used to seeing it racked up in vials. He wasn’t used to it yielding under his hands like this, being able to watch it surge and swell as he held it tighter…
” And Steve saw Tony’s eyes go to the little silk-lined caddy that stood next to the bed, the one Steve had caught the barest glimpse of as he was falling. And then Steve heard the familiar, ripping sound of duct tape being pulled from a roll.
“It’s?” Tony prompted.
And the cold sadness of realising Tony wouldn’t be there… that everything was wrong and anxious still, that Tony wasn’t his… even though he was…
“I...I, uh, have something I need to talk to you about, too,” Steve sighed, miserably. He put the sketch down, and swallowed hard before he made himself look at Tony again-
Which Steve liked, actually. It was something Steve had been searching for his entire life… But, obviously, it made it difficult to explain certain parts of it. The overwhelming pride Steve felt, remembering Tony’s skin shimmering in the sunlight. The look on Tony’s face… The bodily commitment Steve felt to Tony now, the sense of purpose, the fantasies about Tony sinking his teeth into Steve’s neck…
Another stabbing pain in Steve’s chest. Even deeper, even… worse.

But then that left room for that little flicker of revelation – that little chill-
One hand grabbed at Steve’s hair, the other clawing frantically at the sheets, as the pleasure pulsed deeper, and hotter, drawing down from the small of his back. His cock throbbed, thick beads of pre-come dripping onto his stomach in time with that increasing beating sensation.
But Steve was already in too much of a rage to see any of that.

notice that the nervous little voice was conspicuously absent, at the very moment it always made itself known.

“...I was just thinking… That maybe I’m not mad at Steve any more…” he said, like he was trying it out. Rhodey narrowed his eyes at him.
“I have no doubt that they’re still trying to make a weapon with it,” Steve nodded. “So, you’re right, they must have some other reason to ask you…”
And then Steve was kissing him again, more urgently this time, devouring Tony’s mouth without any restraint-

“Yeah, I’ve decided never to ask if there’s a dress code” He said it so earnestly, Tony had to allow himself a thin little smile. And then, as Tony was scanning the room for his shoes, Steve added “So…when you say this place feels unnatural…”
It was a fittingly beautiful evening in Malibu.

fun in his head… that it never worked out the way it did in his daydreams…
He did glance up, briefly, when he heard the two of them step into the workshop. He caught a glimpse of Barnes, and the shadow of Rogers, just a generic shape behind him – Tony looked away before he could take in any more detail.

“Perfectly normal, I assure you” Dev looked between Tony and Steve as he spoke. “In fact, I’m pleased you dropped by this evening. We like to give people a few days to find their feet, but after that one of us would’ve reached out anyway, just to see if you have any questions – almost everyone does, when they’re settling in.”
And Tony just…
“I hate that I’ve hurt you, that, of all people, it’s
“Well, I appreciate it, but there’s really no need,” Steve replied, eventually. “The stories about my susceptibility to sunlight have been greatly exaggerated.”
Tony, looking up at him with those wide brown eyes…
Oh, fuck, why had demanded everyone’s attention-
Steve felt himself fall apart, each of his muscles taking it upon themselves to surrender completely as Tony began to move inside him, thrusting into him slow and deep, again and again-
Lying on the floor,

And for a few seconds, time just stopped. Steve faintly heard the rustle of fabric as Tony loosened his clothes, he felt the dip of the mattress as Tony knelt between his legs. Steve did his best to push himself up, as much as he could with his arms pinned out like this, his heart pounding against his ribs and his mouth suddenly dry-
He sat up suddenly, his hand still curled around Tony’s cock, and – mainly out of habit – he whispered,
...She’d remind him that the triple espresso wasn’t helping.
And, tonight, it was as good as it had ever been. He and Tony traded little observations, even little jokes, as Tony was working. There were call backs to things they’d talked about before, references they both got – a genuine sense of familiarity, despite the cacophony of reactions that Tony still sparked in him.

He sighed and let his arm flop out to the side, not even bothering to put the phone on the bedside table.

“I’m not in,” Tony bit out, as his feet made contact with the landing pad with a soft bump. “I’m actually out.”
There was a flash of blinding panic in Steve’s head, bright enough to blot out his most basic senses.

However, the upside of my having to rearrange my shifts/holiday at the last minute is that I'm now off work for THREE WEEKS - which means I can't get caught out by the rota changes for a while 😆 (and yes, I AM turning off the work phone for a while, because as much as I love them and like to help out - I'm tired)
Just looking at it was achingly, painfully nostalgic.
– to walk away now… It was still Tony’s own mind making that choice. It was still just a question of how much Tony would have to want something before he could harm Steve in any way… It was Tony’s own heart and conscience and soul that recoiled from that idea.

He’d been sitting on the couch in his workshop, staring into the middle distance, for maybe five hours now. Ever since that dream-like exchange when he’d said goodbye to Steve and Bucky at the elevator, with a smile that felt strange on his face… Tony didn’t even know what he’d come back to the workshop for. He’d just sort of drifted here in a trance, and sat down, and…

I did it to him, the first time around - that’s why I didn’t tell him about his parents, and why I sent him a letter that didn’t say anything… and why I was never vulnerable in front of him like that. I did it to Bucky. I spent two years looking for him while he was actively hiding from me, when he didn’t
But Steve knew, this would have looked different to him, once.
“Ha, I don’t think I’ve ever eaten this sitting down,” Steve reassured him, nervously handing him his meal.
He knew what this moment meant to

life. Dimitri never once doubted that he was exactly as he was meant to be, that every event in his life had happened exactly as it should – he had the ultimate, unquestioned proof right there in his arms…
Bucky rather liked his room.
He sprinted down the corridor as quickly as he’d ever moved, and all but threw himself down on the couch-
“But God Tony, if I’d known it would’ve mattered, if I’d ever thought you needed anyone to stand up for you, if I’d thought it would mean anything coming from
He pulled back with a gasp, sliding his fingers free of Tony and grabbing him by the waist. Tony’s shout of protest was swallowed by a surprised yelp, as Steve lifted him effortlessly, pulling him into his lap again.
And just as Steve was about to lose himself in another round of giddy reminiscing, there came a knock at the door.
And Steve was just…
And then Bucky paused, his eyes caught on something over Steve’s shoulder. And then Sam looked up. And even before Steve turned around, he already knew-

“Jayba isn’t like my Dad. He’s more like my Mum, and
Just wanting more, knowing it felt so good,
And Steve knew it was completely genuine.
...If he was being honest, he wanted to have an answer when Tony asked why he hadn’t told him before.
"Please, surprise us," Clint smirks earning more cheering from the crowd.
"What about you, Tony?" The interviewer turns to the billionaire with a smile. "What do you think of Steve's significant other?"
On that note, Tony walks away, retreating to the lab where he plans to lock himself for a few days. He knew Steve hated him, but he never realized how much until tonight. What hurts even more is that he knows Steve is right-- Tony isn't and won't ever be half the man he is.
"Nope, not seeing anyone," Bruce states short and sweet and Clint and Natasha nod as well.
"Is that so?"
"I'm unfortunately very sure, I'm already late," Tony swats Steve's arms away and misses the warmth instantly. "Besides, Bucky really isn't all bad, sweetheart. He just seems a bit understood."
By the time Tony manages to escape from his room, it's already 20 minutes past the time he'd told Bucky he'd meet him. He's not sure what he expects the former assassin to be doing when he makes it into the lab, but he certainly doesn't expect him to be laying on one of Tony's many tables with his head in his hands.
"Thanks," Steve says honestly, gaining a little confidence. "And to answer your previous question: yes, I am seeing someone."
"HYRDA poisoned Bucky so if his arm, the one they gave him, were to ever be removed a slow-burning poison would be released into his system," Tony informs, refusing to look at the two super-soldiers; this is too urgent, he won't let his emotions betray him.
"Yeah," Bucky forces a smile onto his lips for Tony's sake. "I guess we do have a bit of an understanding."
"We're not puppies, Thor," Bruce shakes his head making Thor shrug with an innocent grin on his lips.
Deep down, Steve knew that things weren't the same as they used to be. And maybe that's better, right? He has the Avengers and his wonderful boyfriend, Tony, and now he has Bucky back. But the 1940s Bucky he remembered was kind, charismatic and confident. Present-day Bucky is anything but and Steve finds himself struggling not to force the old Bucky back onto him.
"Sir, it seems as though there is poison in Mr. Barnes' blood. Based on my calculations, it has been there for quite some time."
"Because you and I have something, Buck," Tony shrugs carelessly, his response bringing Bucky out of his thoughts as he stares at the brunette curiously. "We get each other. We have an understanding. You're Steve's best friend and that means something to me."
What's worse is that Steve knows, he knows how much Tony resents his father for how he treated him. No one ever brings up Tony's family because despite Stark's annoyingly arrogant personality, they all know how much Howard still impacts him to this day.
Steve.
"Shit, fuck," Tony looks into Bucky's worried blue-grey eyes and his heart jumps. "Get Banner. And Steve. We need to figure out a cure."
But see, that's the problem. Steve doesn't want to answer any questions or talk to any people; he would prefer it if he could just watch the rest of the team do the interview from the comfort of the couch in Avengers Tower.
"It's the poison, you're hallucinating," Tony explains quietly, carefully taking small steps towards the cowering soldier. "That wasn't you. None of the violence, the killing... none of it has ever been you."
"JARVIS, how's he looking?"
"But I think we can expand it to the whole team," the interviewer continues making Tony pout. "Loraine from Colorado is wondering if any of you are seeing someone special?"
"Chill, Cap," Clint claps the taller blonde on his back, a signature grin on his lips. "You look good and everyone already loves you, you'll be fine."
And then there was the war. And HYDRA. And Steve plunging into icy waters in his normal, idiotic self-sacrificial manner. And so none of that ended up mattering. And then Bucky came back.
- - - - - -
He presses his lips against Bucky's softly, gently so as not to cause him anymore pain than he's already in. And they both relish in the feeling for probably a bit too long; after all, it's nice to fall into something that won't have any consequence. Almost like a dying wish.
"Thank you, doll," Steve smirks knowingly and Tony shakes his head with a grin as he slides cash over to Steve.
"Hey, Buck. It's okay," Tony hesitantly steps towards the long-haired brunette but Bucky coils away from Tony's outstretched hand as though it's poisonous.
"JARVIS, run a full body scan," Tony orders with a shaky breath already going to work on removing the Stark Industries arm from Bucky's flesh.
Tony, finally getting out of Steve's grasp, rolls his eyes at his boyfriend. "I built him a new arm, Steve. He's your best friend, I'm just helping him out."
The crowd laughs again making Steve go beet-red but the interviewer simply raises an amused eyebrow.
"If you could that would be wonderful."
"Oh, you're
"I do, Tony, and that's okay," Bucky opens his tired eyes, a small smile forming on his lips as he relishes in the feeling of Tony's skin on his. "Because if I had chosen differently then I wouldn't have met you."
"Tony, wait," Steve pleads, surprising the both of them as he grabs the brunette's wrist. Tony's heart jumps as he finds himself looking into a pair of pain-filled blue eyes. "Please, just stay."
"The Clintasha friendship is as strong as ever," Clint grins earning a flick on the forehead from Natasha.
"Roughly 2 hours, sir."
"There's this theory..." Tony trails off as though he's waiting to see if Steve wants to hear it, and the blonde simply nods at him to continue. "That when two people of the same sex go out to eat and request one check, the waitress will set the check in front of whoever she thinks is the top." Tony says innocently, popping a left over french fry in his mouth with a shrug.
"Tony, leave!" Bucky moans painfully and Tony scoops him up as best as he can, laying him on the couch in the corner of the lab. "Please, I don't want to hurt you."
“Our overall goals needn’t concern you,” Jesse answered. “The facts are as follows. Neither of you are able to rely on your famous strength or agility at the moment –
“Oh, absolutely.” Tony nodded, pulling his file reader out of his pocket anyway.

In that moment, Tony was so aware of what she’d done for him. Of all the different qualities she had and the choices she’d made that had led him to the love of his life. And against all odds.

“We can do this!” Tony squeaked, as he wiped the tears from his cheek with the heel of his hand.

“I think the problem is actually in your brain,” Tony started, carefully – and then, when he saw the flash of alarm on Bucky’s face, he raced to clarify- “But that doesn’t mean there is anything wrong with your brain. It’s not actually anything to do with your brain…”
“I prefer not to” Adam carried on, relaxing his arm “But, unfortunately, a more nuanced use of Tabula Rasa takes time, and preparation. If you go to attack me, then I’ll have no choice but to use a blunt instrument – and I gather you don’t want that. So.”

And Steve really didn’t like any of this.

And then Tony kissed his throat again, setting every nerve in Steve’s body alight. His eyes watered at the intensity of it, his lip trembling as that moment shifted and stretched around him.
Tony was sure, if he was an outsider watching this scene, he wouldn’t like himself. He knew he was being bitter, and childish – he even felt a pang of sympathy, once or twice, when Steve made some earnest observation about the food or asked a desperate question about Tony’s energy research. The way he absorbed Tony’s cool, closed off responses like physical blows, immediately steeling himself to do it again…
“I didn’t
And then Tony began sliding Steve’s hand over the length of him, slowly, letting Steve feel how thick and hard and warm he was…
And then Steve’s lips finally brushed against his, and parted so naturally, and just melted against him – and, God, it was like he was just

of his drug fuelled outbursts – because they’d been on different topics entirely.
that Tony had chosen to give him something beautiful, and soft, and indulgent, as a gift for tonight.
That it was a far more comforting explanation than anything he’d been reaching for.
Quietly, and as quickly as they could, they climbed up and made their way to the back of the room.
Oh, but he couldn’t talk about
as he was about to feel bad about it, he felt Tony shuffle closer to him, and put a tender hand to the side of his neck…
, not to like me. It’s not a flaw of yours, not to trust me. And, yeah, it kills me you never will… but I guess that’s my problem to deal with, isn’t it?”
“You here with a mission, Sir?” Steve prompted, barely masking his irritation.
“So why not tell us all of this in the first place?” He asked her. “Why ask us for help at all?”

, he had to make sure Steve knew-
Steve chuckled wearily. "We're both too stubborn, you know that?" He turned his hand and caught Tony's, and brought Tony's knuckles to his lips. Steve pecked a few kisses onto each knuckle and then said, "You have a family, Tony. Don't tell me you wouldn't miss them."
"God damn," Tony said suddenly, face pillowed on Steve's chest, "I need a shower."
Steve studied Tony for a long moment. “It's not as weird as you think,” he finally sighed. “I dunno, Tony. Are you sure it's okay between you and Pepper? I don't want to get in the way.”
” He gripped hard, dragging across the bed as Steve stood. “I should - have told you,” Tony strained slightly, “before I kissed you, it’s okay. Pepper and I worked it out.”
Tony was still going. "You need to stop - just stop thinking about everyone else and think about what you want, Steve! So. What. Do. You. Want?" He punctuated the words with repeated jabs to Steve's chest. At the last one, Steve covered Tony's hand with his own, to cut him off gently.
“You know me, big spender.” Tony picked up the phone book and located a place. “Probably shouldn’t actually order over the phone, these landlines are
He didn't say it; he didn't want to rile Tony any more than he already had.
Tony pulled back fully and gave Steve a withering glare. “Excuse you, Rogers,” he exclaimed, “I can destroy my life all by myself, thank you very much. You don't have to do shit, and don't try to push me away now, not after all this. You,” Tony jabbed a finger in Steve's face, “said you love me, and I love you, so you don't
“Yeah, getting smacked down by the Hulk can do that to a guy,” Tony grumbled. “Where are we?”
Steve allowed himself a watery chuckle. “I think… that's just the hero gig.” Though he'd been fucked up for as long as he could remember.
Steve blinked loudly, and then fell back against the bed in defeat. “Star-Spangled -
“Weird,” Tony said, the Tony Stark Grimace back on his face. “Don’t worry, I didn’t realize either. Guess we were both focused on… other things.” He quirked an eyebrow at Steve. “You saw her, right? I mean, I assume you did, ‘cause you’ve been thinking really loudly since we left.”
“I can’t be here,” Steve panicked, making to get up and leave, “I’ll sleep in the car-”
"I'll think about it," Steve conceded. He wanted to give Tony more, give him what he deserved, so he added, "I'm okay with a polyamorous relationship. I just need some time." No amount of time would truly make him ready for this relationship, he knew, but he needed something. "And we need to finish our mission." Which,
There was no more conversation that night, and Steve thought Tony would agree that, in that moment, there was nothing else to say. They fell asleep in each other's arms, and right there, in that shitty motel room on that shitty motel bed, it was just the two of them - no mission, no world to save, no loss or sorrow or apologies. All of those things existed elsewhere, in another time, and Steve slept more peacefully than he had in years.
"T-Tony?" Bucky groans, falling into a coughing fit as soon as he says a word. Blood splatters onto his hands and shirt making Tony cringe.
"Uhm, I'm sorry, miss. There must be a mistake," Steve rubs the back of his neck awkwardly, trying to be as polite as possible as Tony gapes open-mouthed at the small table for two in the back of the restaurant.
Shooting a worried look at the worn-down super-soldier on his lab table, Tony goes to get a wet wash cloth and a bottle of water. When he returns, Bucky is sitting completely upright with an eerie calm expression on his face.
"And what about you, Mr. Captain America?" The interviewer turns to Steve who is still absorbed in his drawings on Tony's hand.
"That's the response I was hoping for! So the audience sent in a few questions for you all prior to this show. How about answering the public's most burning questions?"
"What do you mean?" Tony responds innocently, going back to work as though nothing happened.
"I- uh.." he trails off shooting a helpless look to Tony who nods his head encouraging him to go on. "I was drawing," he admits and raises up the pen as proof.
"Just because you're a genius doesn't mean you know everything about me, Stark."
Tony smiles gently ignoring the wet trail of tears on his cheeks. Nothing matters except the last moments of the man in his arms. "You're welcome."
Bruce looks over Bucky's blood pattern curiously, tapping the holographs obsessively for minutes until he pulls away with a grim, straight-lipped expression.
"H-Hurts," Bucky groans, weakly gesturing to the area where his arm and technology attach.
"Reservation for Barton."
"Right away, sir."
"Clint is an idiot and I don't know how anyone would date him," she smirks and Clint feigns hurt even though the humor is clear in his eyes.
"Uh.. I'm sorry," he grins sheepishly and runs his free hand through his short blonde hair. "What was the question?"
"Listen! His partner works too much and is probably a little self-centered-"
But he didn't and they aren't. So Tony does the only thing he can think to do.
"You're seriously going to drink with me, Rogers?" Tony raises his eyebrows in surprise, completely taken aback by Steve's request. He's not sure he's ever even seen the Captain touch alcohol, let alone drink it.
"Hold still, Grease Lightning," Tony mutters as he tightens a part of the new arm he had made for Bucky. "I almost think you'd rather be armless then strut around with my wonderful creation I so nicely constructed for you."
"Genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist," Tony responds calmly, slowly losing his patience. Contrary to popular belief, he hates fighting with Steve but sometimes he feels it's the only way the other man will talk to him.
Steve wants nothing more than to run after Tony, to apologize and do everything in his power to make sure he's never hurt again. He knows he screwed up big time, none of their fights compare to the betrayed look on Tony's face as he walked away. If only Steve could have just told him how he felt, but instead he went and picked a fight just to avoid it.
Within seconds Bucky's skin regains color and blue-grey eyes find warm coffee brown and the view makes Bucky's heart surge. If he's dead then that's okay because this is a heaven he could damn well get used to.
"Tony's insane," he finally rolls his ocean blue eyes.
And Bucky tried his hardest to be okay with that, really, he did.
"Easy for you to say, Stark," Steve huffs. "You were born into publicity."
"G-Get away from me!" He demands, pushing himself against the wall and as far away from Tony as he can get. "I'll hurt you!"
"Buck?" Tony calls, frowning at the weirdness of the situation.
Before Tony can respond, the waitress returns with the check and the pair wait expectantly as she sets the check in front of...
Steve's best friend.
"What?" Steve asks, completely aware of their still-intertwined hands.
With a mischievous glint in his eyes, Clint turns around with a grin. "I think I have an idea."
The two brothers loved each other dearly but fought over the simplest things. Unfortunately, men and women happened to be one of them. It all started with a joint crush on a very beautiful, very unique woman named Peggy. Bucky had loved her first, naturally, as Steve wasn't always the super-soldier he ended up being, but at the end of the day, Peggy chose Steve.
"Tony?" He groans as he attempts to sit up with a little help from the billionaire next to him. He frowns when he meets the blue eyes of his best friend; okay, maybe not heaven? "Steve? Did the cure work?"
"No," Tony insists through a muffled sob wrapping his arm tighter around Bucky and pulling him closer. "No you don't."
"It's an honor to be here," Tony flashes the woman his signature publicity grin that's all white teeth and Steve actually thinks the interviewer might faint.
"I like you now, just the way you are," Tony responds honestly, a hand slowly twirling Bucky's hair in between his fingers.
Steve on the other hand was a nervous wreck. Not only had Bucky confronted him about hurting Tony, but his own guilt was eating him alive. A team dinner is his best shot at getting Tony to hear him out.
"I think I can make a cure," Bruce states firmly and Tony prays he's right. "But I'll need to go to my lab to do it. And Steve, I'll need you to come with."
"We're testing that theory. Tonight."
"A-Are you sure?" Steve glances at his best friend whose eyes are now closed and his face in a grimace.
He leaves the kitchen with his head down, going straight to his bedroom and ignoring the eyes of the rest of the team.
"Howard?" Something changes in Bucky's eyes, a flash of anger or pure hatred and suddenly Tony finds himself up against the wall with Bucky's human hand against his throat.
"Okay, first question comes from Kelsey of Ohio for Thor!" The interviewer cheers. "She asks: Thor, what is it like being the only Avenger from another planet?"
Steve feels himself turning even more red if that's even possible and he doesn't dare sneak a peak at Tony.
"We're actually going to do something a little different with you guys, is that alright?"
"Me?" Steve frowns, a worried expression instantly on his face when he realizes he'll have to leave Bucky. "Why? I can't leave Bucky."
"I would say they're definitely something. Attractive for sure, he's got my approval on that one," Tony winks at Steve who has to fight an eye roll. "But Steve could totally do better."
"Well, I'm certainly old enough, aren't I?" Steve challenges, a smirk that makes Tony's heart flip forming on his face.
When Bucky's eyes meet Tony's, they're completely glassed over with tears and seem almost... empty.
"Literally," Clint adds. "She literally shoots us down."
"I believe that Stark and the Captain have traces of unresolved... tension," Thor tries to find the right word, but the rest of the team furiously nod their heads in agreement.
And when Bucky came back after finally regaining control over his own mind, Tony understood that he wasn't the same person he was in the 40s even if Steve didn't.
"I was asking if you're seeing someone special but now I'm curious as to what you were doing," she says kindly and Steve's eyes widen.
"Can I tell you something? Promise you won't take it the wrong way," Tony says suddenly to which Steve immediately nods. With a deep breath, Tony averts his eyes from Steve's and lets out a nervous chuckle. "I-I thought you hated me this whole time."
"Why are you so nice to me all the time?" Bucky asks in his normal gruff voice, looking anywhere but into the billionaire's eyes because he's not sure what he'll find there and he doesn't exactly want to know either.
"I would date you, Clint!" A girl yells from the crowd making Clint laugh.
"Okay, clearly we're missing something here," the interviewer shakes her head. "Who are the two lucky people getting to date Iron Man and Captain America?"
- - - - - -
"Steve, I love you, but if you don't calm down you're going to make me pass out," Tony shakes his head with a small smirk on his lips, pressing a quick kiss to his boyfriend's cheek as he walks by.
"Together," Steve and Tony reply in unison and Tony smirks as she walks away.
The two arrive minutes later with Steve instantly rushing over to Bucky's side when he sees his best friend in pain. Sure, they might not be getting along the best right now but he doesn't want him to die.
But Tony is Steve's and despite their differences, Bucky would never steal his brother's man.
"What's going on?" Banner asks in concern meeting Tony by a table full of syringes and dozens of holographs.
"Wow!" The interviewer exclaims happily. "Those are good!"
"Okay," Steve manages a nod still feeling pretty shaken up. "I think I can do it."
Tony doesn't let Steve finish as he leans across the table, pressing their lips together to shut him up. The kiss is soft and gentle, as though both of them are pleasantly surprised by it. And after a few seconds when Tony pulls away, they're both blushing furiously.
Tony finds Bucky's eyes, tears falling freely down both of their cheeks. Tony doesn't know what to say. No, he doesn't love Bucky— it's Steve, it's always been Steve— but he would be lying if he said there wasn't something there. He'd be lying if he said he didn't feel something whenever Bucky complimented his work or accidentally grazed his skin with his own.
It's obvious how much Tony cares for his Captain what with his eyes shining whenever the blonde enters the room and the latter being the only one who can drag Tony from his work in the dark hours of the night. Bucky sees it in the way they brush up against each other, unable to keep their hands off of one another when they're in the same room. He sees it when they're cuddled up on movie night. He sees it all the time. And Bucky is a big enough person to admit he's jealous.
At this point, Steve is a bit of a nervous wreck. He has to fight to keep his leg from bouncing up and down, opting to rapidly drum his fingers on his thighs instead.
"Hear that, Buckaroo? Looks like you've got a clean bill of health."
"No, you won't. I'm not leaving you. I'm here til' the end of the line, remember?"
When they pull away, Bucky has a blissful smile on his lips even though his eyes remain closed. His voice is no more than a mere whisper at this point. "Thank you."
Tony. I wish-” Steve stopped, because he wasn't sure what he wished. For Peggy back? His old life? Which life? He felt like there were so many different iterations of himself, so many versions of Steve Rogers and Captain America, and they were all so separate from each other. “She looked… she looked real good,” he said instead, because he couldn't lie, and that was the only truth he was sure about.
Tony put his hand over Steve’s mouth. “If you apologize for having a panic attack, I’m going to actually scream. Maybe have my own panic attack, who knows.” Tony moved to sit next to Steve on the bed. He opened and closed his mouth, like he was trying to find the right words, and said, “We're both pretty fucked up, huh.”
Steve thought, but he didn’t say it. The mood was stable, now; he didn’t want to bring it back down.
“She was… she was
They finally left the water when Steve kissed Tony's palm and found it far more wrinkled than usual. After toweling off, neither bothered with clothes; Tony took one look at their discarded outfits and didn't look again, which Steve was perfectly fine with. All the better to admire the work of art that was Tony Stark.
Speech finished, Steve moved his hand away from Tony's mouth and caressed his cheek instead. Tony seemed to be at a loss for words, which was an incredibly rare occurrence. Steve waited patiently, brushing his fingers up and down Tony's face, trying to memorize the lines, the little wrinkles and scars that hadn't been there before.
Steve thought with a pang), it had felt like Steve couldn’t get enough of Tony, and the other man responded in kind.
Steve Rogers had been called many horrible things in his life, and “liar” from Tony Stark’s mouth still hurt the most.
Tony seemed interested in Steve's pants as well, though he was having a hard time with the buttons. Steve withdrew one of his hands from kneading Tony's ass (which earned him an annoyed sigh) and undid the buttons smoothly. Tony gave him a shit-eating grin as he finally stuck his hand down Steve's pants to claim his prize.
they succeeded, would cause some complications in the already complicated love life of Steve Rogers.
“I know. It's weird, right? But honestly it makes sense, I think I - I
“Yeah, I guess,” Tony rubbed a hand over his face, “Maria is expecting, well, me. I wasn’t kidding when I said I was still in my mom.”
As usual, Tony's mouth was running nonstop, and every movement was accompanied with an "ah," "yes," various swear words, and the best one, "Steve." Steve had always been rather quiet, but he allowed himself to make the small noises that he knew Tony liked. The rickety bed rocked, and they were too caught up in each other to care.
Tony let out a long groan and rolled onto his back, and Steve cuddled into his side and stroked his chest absentmindedly. "I hate when you're right," Tony griped, scratching Steve's scalp in a way that felt far too good.
Tony pushed himself up to look Steve straight in the eye. "Fuck yes you can. I doubt this trash heap has enough hot water for even one shower, so it's better if we share anyway." Tony made a face and added, "If the water gets cold, I'll just use you as a space heater."
“I missed you,” Steve whispered, and if Tony disliked that Steve was getting tears in his hair, he didn’t say anything. “I missed this.” So maybe Steve was a little touch-starved. It had been so long since he’d been held.
Tony opened his mouth, and closed it again. He did this a few times, and Steve quietly marveled at how much Tony had changed; before, he would have just said exactly what he was thinking, with no care to how he said it. Clearly, he'd learned something from Pepper about proper communication. "I already do," Tony eventually said, voice small. "I miss them so much my chest hurts. Like I'm being choked, or when the suit's chest cavity is crushed." He tilted his head in an imploring manner and continued, "But it felt like that without you, too. Even though you were the one who crushed my chest cavity. God, that feeling lingered for so long, and at first, I thought you had done permanent damage. I had myself CAT scanned and everything. Turns out it was just a broken heart."
You really know how to ruin a moment,” he said, with barely contained laughter. “I'm trying to defuse your bomb and you keep taking my tools!”
“Tony-”
After a few minutes, Tony groaned and deepened the kiss, sucking Steve's tongue into his mouth. Steve let out a languid moan as Tony sucked, and he could feel his face flushing even as blood rushed downwards. Tony always had known how to get him riled up.
Steve, feeling somewhat coy, raised an eyebrow and prodded Tony's prostate again. "What did you say?"
he wondered.
- if Erskine hadn’t chosen the wrong man -
“Chr- Christ,” Tony choked out, “
“No, no, you listen, Rogers. I… if something happens once we get the Stones I need to, I don't know, have closure. And I'm thinking you do too,” Tony said, finally making eye contact again and shifting to sit on the edge of the bed, near Steve, and Steve's stomach did a flip, despite the seriousness of it all. “Can we just… talk?”
“That’s not true,” Steve murmured, eyes fluttering closed under Tony’s ministrations, “you’ve made the most sacrifice plays out of any of us.”
Steve snapped his hips obligingly, picking up the pace, and Tony cried out, a guttural sound that rocked Steve to his very core. He wouldn’t last much longer at this rate, and he could tell by the sounds Tony was making that the feeling was mutual.
"I-" Steve found it hard to speak past the sudden lump in his throat. Tony would do that? Stay with - for him? They could hang around here, in the 1970s, for months, years even, before traveling back to 2023. Blinking back tears, Steve shook his head. "I don't think that's a good idea."
Tony was the one to set the pace, of course. He fucked himself on Steve's cock in an even rhythm, and Steve timed his responding thrusts to hit the best possible angle. He wanted - needed to make Tony feel good, feel all of Steve's love and desire burn straight to Tony's core.
“Oh, just thinking about old times,” Steve replied warmly. “All the hours we spent just like this, in your bed.” His face flushed slightly as he realized the implication of the statement. “Sorry, that - I overstepped.” He made to draw away, sure he'd ruined the moment, but Tony's arms locked him in place.
Tony sniffed. “Yeah, me too,” he finally said, and his voice was a bit wet. “This is nice. Can we do this forever? I forgot how much I cherish this pillowy chest of yours.”
… wasn’t.” Steve almost trembled under the weight of the words, Tony was wrong, it was his fault, if Bucky hadn’t fallen if Steve had found him if Steve had done his job to destroy HYDRA -
Just as suddenly as the anger came, it receded like a wave, and Tony slumped back into Steve's chest. “Fuck, that's a lot.” They cuddled in silence for a few minutes, Steve kneading Tony's shoulders lightly while Tony stroked Steve's hair. It was almost like the last seven years had never happened, and they were back in Stark Tower, stealing a precious moment in Tony's room. Tony would be absolutely horrified at the comparison, and the thought caused Steve to chuckle.
“Sorry.” Steve pulled his hand back, recalling the last time he had touched the housing, how Tony had slapped it into his hand -
Slowly, Steve eased a finger into Tony, who pushed back on it with an impatient grunt.
No, what was he thinking? Tony was
this, Steve. I need
” Tony drew the word out, and his filthy moan was definitely intentional this time. He pushed at Steve's shoulder to move him on his back, straddling Steve's lap. Steve arched up into Tony, allowing him to feel just what Tony did to him.
“Ugh,” Tony fake-wretched, “don’t say things like that, I’ll lose my lunch.” He scratched his beard. “The small amount that we had, anyway. Damn, I could really go for a pizza right now. Think I could threaten a pizza guy into handing one over without paying?”
Suddenly, a spark of realization dawned. Perhaps it was true that Steve brought the fight out in Tony, and that had been a bad thing in the past, but it didn't have to continue to be a bad thing.
"You could fly over?"
Steve gave a weak chuckle, absentmindedly stroking his hands up and down Tony’s back. “I’m surprised we got to this point without a fight. You remember how many times our arguments would end like this?”
So there they were, in a borrowed (“It’s stolen, Rogers, there’s no way we’re gonna get it back to Jersey.”) car, eight long hours into the trip, with far too many to go. Steve wasn’t sure how he and Tony had been able to get on for this long; they may have struck a peace to get the Stones, but they hadn’t spent this much time together alone since… since.
Steve chuckled. “Really? Just for that?” He shook his head and set his shield down on the table. “I dunno. I bet this bed will be in my top ten nicest.”
“Au contraire, Cap,” Tony grinned mischievously, “maybe I want to explode.” He dragged his hips across Steve's achingly slowly, and Steve itched to flip them both over and pound Tony into the shitty motel mattress. His impulse control had always been tenuous at best, so the only thing stopping him was Tony's face - he was loving this, the power he had over Steve. Far be it from Steve to burst that bubble.
“Rogers, shut your brain up and please kiss me already,” Tony grumbled, and pressed his lips onto Steve's.
“God, yeah. We’re such hotheads.” Tony pulled away slightly to look Steve in the eye, and once again, Steve was struck absolutely speechless. How had he ever let go of someone this precious? “You know, after… when I got back to Earth, and that whole argument, I… vowed to stop fighting.” Tony pressed back into Steve's chest, and looked almost forlorn. It didn’t suit him; Steve had never seen his confidence fall away so abruptly. “I had a family to think about. Have a family. Gah, being in the past is so confusing. So I vowed to stop. And I did, I stopped fighting physically. But I was still… fighting myself.” He spoke slowly. “And I was still… fighting you. Fighting our history. It - it caused some problems. I tried to work through them. I thought I did.”
Thus far, Steve was pretty sure the only reason they hadn’t gotten into an argument during this trip was because Tony was able to focus all of his ire at their situation on the music piping through their car radio. Tony was solidly an 80’s man, a fact Steve had learned intimately well during their… Steve hesitated to call it a relationship, even privately. It was more like a series of moments, half of which involved some sex act. Steve blushed to think of his almost insatiable behavior during the thick of his and Tony’s… moments. After their first kiss (Steve’s first since 1945 -
Steve felt the tears, but staunchly refused to let them flow. Not when Tony was holding up so well, and Steve still needed to speak his piece. How did he respond to
Steve didn’t reply. How could he? It had never been said during their relationship, but Tony cared for him, loved him. And Steve… “How can you still love me? I hurt you,” Steve said, voice low. He gestured helplessly around the room. “I pulled you into this. Even now, I'm destroying your life.”
But he couldn't always follow his heart.
"You know, we don't actually have to go back right away," Tony suggested slowly. "Time is in our hands and so on and so forth. We can stick around here for a while once we get the particles." He pressed a soft kiss to Steve's furrowed brow. "If you want."
Since Bucky, his mind said, but he knew it’d been much longer than that.
Tony raised a brow as his eyes caught on something in the distance, and he said, "On second thought." Steve followed his stare to a large poster on the wall that stated,
Silence fell over them like an oppressive blanket, and Steve didn't dare raise his tearful gaze. “Goddammit,” Tony finally muttered. “Fuck. Damnit, Rogers.” Tony was curled in on himself, Steve could see his hands clasping and unclasping on his knees. Finally he exclaimed, “I’m gonna regret this. Or maybe I would regret it if I
Tony looked down, clearing his throat. Okay, maybe he wasn't holding up as well as all that. After a moment, he gestured to Steve and said, “Okay, I think that's… that's what I needed to say, you can go now.”
“Are you scared to admit you want it because of your oh-so-high morals or because you’re fucking stubborn and need to prove something?”, Tony continued to pick at him, proofing once again why he was such a tease to Steve. Provoking all those thoughts Steve unsuccessfully tried to ban from his mind. Most of them involving a significant lack of clothing.
“Don’t you think you should get a room?”, that was Clint’s voice. He sounded more amused than really indisposed, however, he painfully reminded Steve of the fact that there were people. Not only Bucky or Clint or Natasha, other people. Tony who didn’t stop touching him only smirked, his head turning the slightest bit in Clint’s direction: “It’s my house after all”
As some of you may have recognized, English is not my first language, and therefore I always try to improve my English. If I've made some mistake all the time, feel free to tell me so I can improve my writing
“You will pay for this”, he managed to say between gritted teeth and caught Tony’s lips again, this time leaving his marks on the other’s upper lip.
First, he felt his naked skin covered by soft and cold silk blankets, then his foot brushing slightly against the bare skin of somebody else. Steve’s breath hitched and he opened his eyes carefully blinking. It took its time for his sight to adjust to the light and the headache to stop his thoughts from spinning. Somewhere between his violent blinking he could sense the other body lying next to him. When his view was finally clear, he tried to scramble away immediately, his whole mind paralyzed in shock.
The next chapter (already written as this one was for what felt like months) will Feature another new character. I hope all of you want to meet Sam  ;-)
To my defense, being a law student is stressful but after this semester’s exams were written (and I was ill for a week) I finally managed to finish this chapter.
Steve only rose and eyebrow but Sam raised his hands defensively: “I’m only being honest”
“Waking up somewhere with somebody is pretty normal after parties. In fact, it’s what the whole stuff is about”, Tony said, sitting on the bed only with his trousers on.
“You blame me the whole day for being Tony Stark and then you honestly ask if I have lube and condoms?”, Tony gave back letting his teeth sink into Steve’s skin playfully and challenging at the same time. “I’m not sure whether you want to insult me or if you’re only not that bright”, he continued and raised an eyebrow inquiringly.
“We’ll see. But as soon as somebody even tries to make fun of me I’m gone.”, Steve threatened, but a smile crossed his face. “Have fun getting lost then. I’ve already picked you up twice from some tube station at the end of the world”
He spent most of the time after school on track team, running and running and running.
Tony clearly left him no time to come up with a way to leave the cinema with a hard-on. Probably they would have solved the problem otherwise, but the sudden lack of spectacular action (the only thing Steve was aware of in this movie) made it painfully clear that there was not much time left to consider it. He pushed Tony away and just sat there breathing in and out steadily. He hated him. So much.
Steve felt his cheeks reddening and there was a wave of embarrassment even though nobody else could hear them. “That… that’s not what we’re discussion right now”, he spluttered out, trying to change the topic. He knew Tony would go for him like an eagle for prey once they started to talk about some of Steve’s kinks. He hated to admit them.
“I don’t know. You’re the one who managed to end up in a bedroom with the guy you almost started a fight with the week before.”
(See the end of the chapter for
He stayed.
Bucky was laughing too, a low sound that Steve hadn’t heard from him in a while, or at least not around a person that wasn’t a pretty girl he was taking out. But Sam was there and he suddenly remembered the way Bucky had looked at Sam before and that was a damn good distraction, because other people’s love life most of the time was.
Tony tried hard to suppress any noises but he had no chance. It took only a couple of seconds and he heard a throaty little moan that Tony had probably tried to swallow. He grinned and swirled his tongue. The other’s breath hitched. Steve grinned around the dick in his mouth. A hand settled in his hair and he was pulled closer, his mouth becoming fuller and fuller. He felt Tony’s fingers shaking and his breast rising faster and faster under the pleasure. He swallowed hard and the hand in his hair pulled sharply, the fingers roughly gripping his hair.
“If you take my baby, I’d personally drag you to every party I know about”, Bucky dared, but he broke into laugher a few seconds later. Most likely he imagined Steve standing awkwardly in the middle of the dance floor.
"After all that time...", his voice broke because it wasn’t right to talk about this here, "I thought that, maybe, I’m special"
-Not yet. Still 1:30 minutes to go.
“Can’t you figure that out yourself?”, Tony came closer, his Cheshire Cat like grin deepened and the way he spoke turned into a purr.
And he was right. Tony kissed him with such need their teeth clashed and he couldn’t tell where his mouth started and the other’s ended. It was breath-taking and perfect because it was all that he liked: violent, urgent and fun. His hands dug into Tony’s shoulders and for a swift second, he even considered taking control back again. That was before Tony’s hand slid with a wicked smile between his tights. He almost screamed.
Tony smirked, his hands met Steve’s in the brink of a second: “Deal.”
“Don’t you think angry sex is the best?”, Tony whispered in his ear, the Cheshire grin once again playing on his face.
It took Tony only a couple of minuets to get some staff who would clean the kitchen and inspect the damage. Steve was still sad about another piece of furniture burnt by Tony’s affinity to open fires and explosions. Well, at least their life was never boring when there was no world to save.
Tony looked at him, eyebrows still raised questioningly, then back down at his journal. “What about doing something else?”, he suggested and placed the journal on his night-stand.
“Do I look like I care?”, she asked back, raising a delicate eyebrow.
"Glad you asked", Bucky grinned, "otherwise I'd invited myself to the game.”
Tony stopped right in front of him, their bodies almost touching, leaving Steve at ache, wanting to feel the other's movements. Tony lowered himself down, slowly and teasing with everything he had on display.
Steve only stared at Tony for a couple of moments. That was clearly not what he had expected. Not at all. He took another couple of seconds to clear his head and find a response: “Sure you’re not the one crawling somewhere?”
He looked a t Tony for a painful long moment and searched for glues. Tony looked not as flamboyant and cocky as normal. His face was torn between mild anger and honest care.
There were nights in which he couldn’t sleep, wasting all of his energy to think about him and Tony and what they were and weren’t. Yet, after all the headache this topic had caused him, he still hadn't found a proper term for them. It was not friendship nor romance or simply sex.
It had been comfortable to just sit there, Steve staring at the wall and Tony scribbling down stuff. It was not what they usually did, not at all. Steve sighed. He was not in the mood for anything that involved moving his sore bones, particularly not sex and Tony seemed to be absorbed with his new project. He shifted and lay down. It hadn’t been his intention to make Tony fall of the bed and after all, it was not his fault when Tony cowered on the very edge of it. He heard a little sound and Tony cursing before the other got up and looked at him, eyebrows raised.
“I thought you just moved here and had no friends.”
“I don’t think we should do that again”, Steve said, his voice firm but not as persuading as he had hoped it to be.
“Are you staring at me?”, Tony muttered still half asleep and cuddled against him without a second thought.
“Uhm, if you think so.”, Steve answered, a bit unsure of what to do now.
“Say it”, his opponent breathed out, his voice rawer than before. Steve sensed how the body beneath his worked hard to steady his breath, knew that Tony was trapped and that those were BLAND? Word now without a meaning. He said it anyway because there was no surrender in it anymore, no pride lost. “Please”, he growled before their lips finally collided.
I decided on giving you the ending of the last chapter again so the beginning of this one does not sound completley weird ;-)
Steve could see what Tony liked about her. It made his skin crawl because they were so perfect for each other.
As his best friend he knew all too well how lost Steve felt in the city, in school, everywhere. And because Bucky was outgoing, flirty and even due standards of city people cool, he had taken the lead in finding new friends. Obviously with success. On the other hand: his parents had moved here two years ago, which had given him some advantage because he had had way more time to learn how those city people worked.
Every time Tony’s fingers scratched over the skin of his inner tights, every time they left thin, angry marks there, every time he had to sulk in his breath like he was drowning, he let out tiny pleas. Tony loved it. His lips curled back into a self-content leer every time he managed to make him beg, every time Steve closed his eyes in silent bliss. At one point, he realized that he had started to touch Tony, his hands roaming over the other’s body, demanding release in this very different way. When it was Tony who moaned this time, his sinful lips forming a silent ‘oh’, Steve knew he had accomplished his mission.
After I've survived my first two exams here's a new chapter.
Maybe he had been wrong and this was more than co-dependency. Maybe, it was affection. Or even a twisted kind of love.
They were lots of people around them, laughing and trying to pat on Tony’s back. He looked clearly annoyed, about to roll his eyes -Steve knew this face well enough- and yet he didn’t send the crowd away. Steve just by instinct knew what all of this meant. Tony Stark and Pepper Potts were back together. They looked perfect and even worse like they were meant to be there, surrounded by a large crowd who admired them.
I hope you enjoy (because I really enjoyed writing it)!
Bucky shrugged his shoulders: “Maybe we ask him something about his not-existing love life?”, his voice was full of irony.
From all the things he had expected Tony to do - and there basically hadn’t been anything he wouldn’t dare Tony to do - it had certainly not been a blowjob. On the other hand: Tony had said he wanted to make him beg. And that sure was a way to manage that.
Steve had seen her before and had admired her red hair and delicate features but feared her sharp voice and toughness. Now she appeared behind the crowd, that divided itself in front of her like she was a goddess to admire. She seemed furious.
Tony’s voice grew louder now, angrier: “You told me that we would not get involved with each other. End of the story.”
Because I've already written 7 of the 10 chapter I'll be able to update every Friday (I'm so proud of myself, normally it takes me forever to finish a story)
Tony only shrugged his shoulders, his eyebrows raised: “Is that jealousy now or prudery?”
“Probably both”, Steve thought and got in the car.
He only stopped when he felt his body was too tried, his muscles aching and his lips, cracked, were desperate for water. When he turned away from the punching bag, the rest of the world came fading back in slowly, but this time he was prepared. Sam and Bucky had been watching him and he distinctly remembered Sam holding the punching bag in the beginning, when his rhythm had been less regular and his blows weak.
“I do,” Steve cut in, with as much conviction as he could muster. “I love you so much that I can't
Tony pointedly did not meet Steve’s gaze. It was still a sore subject between them, then. “Yeah, I, he, uh… caught me trespassing, totally bought that I was from MIT even though I’m pretty sure visitors aren’t supposed to be in the ‘Important Artifacts’ section of the lab. Man, S.H.I.E.L.D. security really always has been shit, hasn’t it? He,” Tony giggled, and it sounded a little hysterical, “He even bought that my name was also Howard. Literally gave me the cube. Guess he was distracted, with the… flowers and everything…”
“Wow,” was all Steve could reply, and he knew his voice was strained. He blinked back his tears. He had to speak his truth, for Tony. “Okay, uh. Well.”
With a ragged cry, Steve hit his peak, and he struggled to keep his gaze on Tony, because Tony was coming too, and God fucking damn was he beautiful - waves of pleasure overcame Steve, and he had to lean back and close his eyes, but he could still hear Tony swearing, feel Tony thrusting at a feverish pace, feel Tony’s cum spurt onto his chest. The sensation was overwhelming, and Steve greedily drank it in, like a dehydrated man finally watered. He'd experienced orgasm with Tony many times before, but none had ever been like this, so full of raw power and emotion, neither of them wanting to let go but having no choice.
Steve sighed. He’d hoped Tony wouldn’t notice his ruminations on Peggy, because seeing her again was, frankly, a massive stab to the heart. Not only was he still in love with her, she reminded him of everything he’d ever lost; her, Bucky, his pre-serum life, his 1940’s life, the Avengers, Bucky again, Sam… Tony.
"I'm used to cold showers," Steve shrugged, and Tony's grimace only grew, much to Steve's amusement.
"That's what I want, but I'm wanting to run away, instead of towards something, and that's where I have a problem." Steve sighed in resignation. "I want a life, but I have no idea what I would do with it. It feels like my whole existence is fighting, and, well, maybe it is. I've always been fighting, and I have no idea how to stop. And you stopped." Tony looked like he was about to interject, and Steve put his left hand over Tony's mouth, running his thumb along the plush lower lip. "You said it yourself, you were able to stop, and then I showed up and you started again. I want a life, but it can't be with you."
“We're gonna get them back, Steve.”
Steve Rogers didn’t know what he had expected from his and Tony’s little jaunt in the 70’s, but a road trip certainly wasn’t it.
An hour later, Steve and Tony were sprawled on their respective beds, surrounded by empty pizza boxes.
Steve huffed a laugh. "We’re gonna need something slower.”
Tony hummed, and then suggested, “Maybe after this is all over, you can finally get a life, Cap.”
“What?” Tony asked, voice barely above a whisper.
Tony broke away with a small gasp, and his pupils were blown wide, so his eyes almost looked black in the dim light. “I need you,” he murmured, “inside me.”
“Oh, god,” Tony groaned as soon as his body hit one of the queen-sized mattresses. “This bed has got to be one of the worst I’ve ever been on, but damn if it isn’t fucking incredible right now.” He sat up. “Mark my words, when I get back to the future, I’m finding this mattress and burning it for making me say such nice things about it.”
in a very good relationship, and there was no chance in hell that Steve would ever ruin that. He'd ruined enough of Tony's life. Even though Tony had said he loved Steve “present-tense” - what did it all mean? Steve laid frozen, paralyzed with doubts, and he almost didn't register Tony's almost record-breaking eyeroll.
"Why not? It's not like they'll miss us in the future. We have our GPSes, we can go back to the right time whenever we want." Tony looked at Steve almost imploringly, and Steve's heart ached, burned with want and desire and love, begged to say Yes, Tony, let's stay.
“What,” Steve said, “are you talking about?”
“About an hour and a half,” Steve replied evenly. “Guess you were tired.”
Steve exhaled slowly, mulling it over. He was still hesitant about their relationship; he still thought what he'd said was true.
“But looking back I realize it was because of…
“You are seriously one of the most frustratingly unselfish men I’ve ever met,” Tony told him. “And I’m the most selfish. No wonder we didn’t last.”
“Look, I had no idea how long we'd be in the past. I refuse to take it dry, not even for you, sweetheart.”
Steve swallowed thickly around the words, but he knew they had to be said. The full truth. “I loved you. I still love you, so much. And I'm so happy you found someone to love you, and to love.”
trustworthy. Be back soon.” He flashed Steve a winning smile, and the super-soldier felt warm to the tip of his toes. This was absolutely going to be a long few days.
“It's fine,” Tony responded, “more than fine, really, is it part of your serum effects for everything you do to be so alluring?”
to pull any bullshit. Not tonight. If you really do love me-”
“Ultron wasn’t,” Tony interrupted, almost matter-of-fact, but Steve could feel the pain in his stance. “Zemo wasn’t. HYDRA…
Steve started to shake his head, then changed his mind and nodded. “It kinda was,” he laughed wetly, “but you deserve to know everything. First, I know you said you're not sure if you can forgive me, and that's okay, I don't expect you to. But I am sorry. For everything. I never wanted to cause you pain, and by not taking action, I caused the most pain.” Steve couldn't look at Tony, as hurtful as it was.
” Tony sighed languidly, and he pulled Steve's shirt over his head in one motion, interrupting the necking. “Steve, I wasn't kidding about the time, I really need you to whip out that Star-Spangled Ding Dong of yours.”
“If by a while you mean I was doing this just last week, sure,” Tony snipped, and Steve blinked owlishly at him. “C'mon, Rogers, you think I don't ride Pepper's strap constantly? I thought you knew me.” He pushed back again. "I demand more."
It was wordlessly decided that they were ignoring Tony's bed (arch nemesis) in favor of Steve's. "We've baptized this in our cum, Rogers," Tony explained as they settled back into cuddling position, and Steve snorted despite himself. That earned him a shit-eating grin from Tony, who continued, "When we go back, I won't burn this bed. No, this bed belongs in a museum."
"Consider me warned," Steve grinned, and he couldn't resist placing a small kiss on Tony's lips. They kissed for a few minutes, languidly exploring territory many times charted, and Steve's heart burned.
“Kidding, I'm kidding, Rogers, don't get your virtuous manhood in a twist.” Tony eyed the phone. “Seriously though, I'm starving. Don't you have any ancient 1940's money we could use?”
“It will work,” Steve shot back with a touch too much aggression, and Tony held up his hands in mock surrender. Steve pinched the bridge of his nose and apologized, “Sorry. Been a long day.”
“Steve, wait,” Tony exclaimed as he grabbed Steve’s hand, “wait, just
“I have a hard time making anything about myself, you know that,” Steve retorted, and he could feel as the tension slowly drained out of the both of them. He let Tony guide him back to their previous entwined position, allowing himself to enjoy Tony’s fingers carding through his hair.
"Stop," Tony exclaimed, "thinking about what I need and for once, just once think about yourself!" Steve was struck by Tony's voice, no longer the civilian but the superhero, leader of the Avengers. "You're always so concerned with what others want that you ignore your own needs. You know Natasha, of all people, told me that you haven't had so much as a one-night stand in six years?"
“Considering I’m still a resident in my mom’s body, no,” Tony replied with his trademark grimace. “And all our money would be considered highly suspect at best." He shook his head. “Gah, I knew I should have built boosters into the quantum suits.”
“Yeah,” Steve croaked, but Tony was still speaking.
“Fuck,” Tony whispered, and then said louder, “C'mon, Rogers, we're on the clock here.”
"Yes, polyamory isn't a 21st century invention," Steve huffed. "Though the term is new. I was a queer back then too, and queers were always ahead of the curve. I was never personally in a relationship like that, though I wasn't ever really in a relationship. I'm not a good point of reference."
“After HYDRA, I thought I would end up hurting you if we stayed together. I thought we could both move on, that it wasn't ever that serious anyway, and I'd hoped Zola was wrong. And then after Siberia, I realized I'd become the one thing that would hurt you no matter what: a liar. To you, and to myself.” The tears were falling, now, and Steve couldn't stop them this time. “I promise you, I will never lie to you again. I can't.”
"Fff- fuck," Tony huffed, "I'm ready, come on."
Instantly, Steve's mind went blank, and he automatically kissed back with a fervor he hadn't felt in years. He grasped Tony's face with both hands, sucking hard at Tony's bottom lip. Steve could kiss Tony like this for hours, revel in the scratch of Tony's beard against his face, Tony's nails on his back, Tony's-
