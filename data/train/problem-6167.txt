I-’m such a little bitch for characters repeating lines back to each other chapters later, AND saying the name of the story in the story. Sorry if it’s too cheesy for y’all, I just love love love it.
She only curls her fingers and her toes in anger and frustration. The hill's too steep and long for a getaway, and they know it. No one holds her down anymore, they’ve already caged her in.
“Excuse me Madame, but I think Sobol has cheated.” Eva stepped forward suddenly, “She didn’t kill Mila, and she stole my gun from me. The rules didn’t say she could do that.”
He’s cut off by the other guard wrenching a taser from their chest and jabbing him in the chest. Maria Hill quickly grabs the helmet off her head, “These things really pinch your nose.”
Madame had ears all over the place and she couldn’t afford to make another mistake.
“Remember to bring them my body. Don’t let Eva have it and be careful on your way back. She’ll want to kill you too.”
“Or are we going to fight?”
Toni stuffed her shirt down more furiously, and kicked her shoes on “Oh shit shit shit.”
As she stared at the retreating men, she felt nothing for her sister. Was she a monster then?
“If we both die, there’s no asset. That’s two decades of resources wasted.”
She fell asleep with her mind set to being sober, her bed was soft and Rhodey fell asleep next to her.
“It should only take one day, and you will be promptly returned. Better go get briefed now, it’s almost time to go.”
“Should we… kill Eva first?” Tania says,
She seems like an Erika now, oh well too late for that.
Before he could ask any questions, a gunshot rang through the apartment, shattering the glass and his eardrums. He only shot back a foot and paused a moment, before lunging towards Fury and pulling him out of view of the window.
Since her outburst last year, they’d stopped taunting her. A small miracle.
“That does explain a few things. What’s it’s name? Gender?”
“Well, she’s not actively trying to kill us!”
“Maybe.” She says, “Or maybe they’ll assume your body was burned away along with your parents in the terrible car accident, that resulted in a huge fire engulfing the car.”
But when Toni  looked up, she was holding a gun, aimed right at Pierce, “I’m sorry.” Says an electronic voice, she quickly pulls off the digital mask and wig, revealing her identity, “Did I step on your moment?”
“It was four months.” She said
She turns to leave when she remembers being dragged somewhere. It’s like a dream, but it’s clear, Madame led a few men to the tables with her in tow, and then nothing. Like it all disappeared from her brain, she gives herself a headache just thinking about it.
“With who?”
Strangely they woke up together, even sitting up in the bed at the same time, silently putting on close before he tried to make awkward conversation.
She skips dinner that day, opting to go to her favorite abandoned classroom in the lone wing. She starts off with push ups, then squats. She’s been working on holding handstands since last June, because she thinks it’ll help her with ballet.
“Toni Stark? As in Antoinette Stark? As in Howard Stark?”
“Oh yeah, no prob. I was just-” she paused, she didn’t know why she kept that project alive other than spitting Howard by doing what he couldn’t, but she wasn’t about to tell him that, “doing the right thing. Of course we didn’t really expect you be alive.”
She can’t tell if Madame is surprised or even pleased with the outcome.
And of course it turned out to be killing her slowly (not slowly enough), and she had to give Howard credit for his help in solving that little problem.
But she’s never been in contact with them, and at this rate, she never will be.
She stripped off the dirtied shirt and made towards the stream. The first few dunks in the cold water rinse the initial black, but the sides that she’d slept on had really worked their way into the fabric.
“Oh yeah it can.” Sindy bit her lip, “Let me show you.”
“What?”
“You can call me Toni.” She replies still walking down the hall
They stood at the gate, peering inside, the other woman turned their heads towards the lone window in the back of the cell, but Toni stared at the closest guard till he made eye contact. She looked at him angrily, rebelliously. Just like she knew he would, he picked her out of the bunch, so he could feel powerful as he beat the rebellion out of her.
He didn’t see it that way. Still when Strange urged her to call him, she was about to when all sort of alien hell rained down and the sponge bob the musical rejects showed up. Of course Parker hitched a ride, and of course they ended up finding a gang or old pop culture obsessed aliens, and half alien.
As if on cue, they step towards each other a mad fury of limbs, Steve doesn’t think he could join in, and he doesn’t think he wants to.
He narrowed his eyes in response, “Россия.” He answered finally. Russia.
Before the first could recover, she leveraged her weight against the second guard and kicked him with both feet.
”We’re all daughters of Russia, our mission is to serve.” They recite in unison.
“We’ve gotten through to someone, he says he’s her emergency contact. James Rhodes.”
“He pulled me out of the car and held me to the ground for ten or twenty minutes. Till they came and brought me to Russia. I refused to go along with their program so they put me into this sort of electric chair. It made it hard to remember things for a while but they left my file on a table nearby. I read everything, but it was like reading someone else’s biography. It was only after I escaped that memories came back.”
“What does that mean?”
As she places the last one, under a shelf in the linen closet, she heard the door start to open. Her body tensed, but she didn’t panic. She calmly stepped into the bathroom, hoping Mazur was too drunk to notice her. Maybe he’d pass out on his bed and allow her to escape unnoticed.
“Is that what happened to Nika?” Tania said, “You told her what happened and they killed her?”
“Why’d you kill them?”  she asks,
She hangs up soon after promising to be there within the hour. She’s considering just flying her helicopter.
Rhodey forced coffee down her throat and she pointed out a home IV kit in the back, he rolled his eyes, “You have a problem you know?”
“So it’s mine?” He says finally
Toni approached Tania, “Ready for ‘Battle Royale’?”
Rhodey glanced at the newspaper cautiously. “Tones.”
A death sentence if she’d ever heard one, Toni smiled in return, “I don’t know if you understand the point of this program Eva, but the reason we’re here is to complete missions.”
“You can’t just-” he started, “You can’t just decide something like that! I was ready!”
“Oh but she would.” She walked towards Nika, who’s eyes were huge and pleading, “She says we wiped your memory. That your name isn’t Antonia Sobol.”
“I never managed to prepare anything to say today. What can one say about their dead..deceased parents. She was beautiful, he was charming, I guess. I think because I only knew them as a child, barely as a young adult, I didn’t really know them at all. I knew them as perfect beings, rulers of my life. I never knew them as people.” She spewed bull shit for about two more minutes before ending with a quote from Howard about success that made him sound like a total asshole. But everyone applauded, and a few even caught her afterwards saying how kind and genuine she had been.
“Hi Antonia.” The woman replies,
Zma shakes her head, “This being so sudden, we don’t have time to get you in their system legitimately, but the costume should sell it, and you’ll be able to access his room with the key in your grab bag.”
Koila was not good at guarding her expressions, so Toni knew she’d bought the story, “I wish I could say I was brave, or I defended the Prime Minister, but I was just trying to escape.”
“And now she doesn’t exist.”
Annie gulped, she’d not been prepared to answer any questions, she didn’t even think they’d care.
“She’s not lost.” Toni mutters,
“I’m serious.”
“Really? I thought your parents were both only children and your grandparents died.”
“I’ve played this game before, Shvets,” Toni said, stepping closer so the barrel of her gun was flat against Eva’s head.
“I guess we have more in common now then we did when we were children. Dead parents, big trust.”
“This is a little more important than a commencement speech.” Steve says
“That’s cool.”
“Yeah it was a surprise for me too.”
Considering Toni was already dieing of palledium posioning, she figured she’d cut to the chase.
Toni remains silent, but he continues, “Go on then, take off the mask. I want to put a face to all the stories I’ve heard about you.”
“Early for what?” Koila says, and Toni just points to the sky, where a sleek black chopper approaches, it’s nearly silent, and hard to see in the sky. It’ll be weeks till they find out Koila got out of the country, and they’ll never find out where Toni went.
They all acknowledged her in one way or another, whether it be a smile or a sneer, when Madame turned on her heel towards the North Wing.
With every assassination she committed, she spent less and less time at the apartment. And she wants to scream at someone, to take all her frustration out of the people responsible.
“They called a class meeting, dinner is extended till all the others are finished.”
Every time they neared a corridor where they could hear the voice of the party, Toni’s face paled, and Manya leads her in the other direction.
“JARVIS?” She said,
“I’m not getting revenge, and my name isn’t Antonia. I’m avenging them. I need to avenge them.”
She hums in response, and before she loses the nerve she says, “I want to tell people.”
“On the hour,” she gestures to a nearby clock that reads one forty in the morning.
She back off her knees and thought a moment, “Probably with me sitting in an old woman's apartment for an hour, listening to her life story.” She sighed, “I’ve already heard it ten times.”
“You were a Red Room asset?”
And she was alone, nobody told her to enter but nobody told her not to. So she pushed the unusually heavy door open and walked into the room. Her first analysis was that it was really cold. Ironic.
“Useless girl.” She said, turning towards her desk, laying her hands flat, “Did they call him something?”
She smiled, “No. I’m Amanda. I keep getting my neighbor’s mail. But Eugenie’s getting old, so I have to bring it to her, but she lives two floors down on the other side of the building. Kinda left it to the last minute this week.”
Toni knew for a fact she was much better at British accents, which she had no doubt Kozlov knew too.
“What?” Pepper asked.
“I come here sometimes. During lunch, and dinner.”
It’s a sparring day, so they spend the whole morning in the gym warming up. Rumor has it they’re going to eliminate someone this week.
They both shuffled to opposite edges of a clean mat, both stiff and uncertain.
Amanda gets a clean punch in the face knocking his mask to the ground, but he turns so suddenly, Steve doesn’t see much other than his long hair.
“No. Everyone thinks I’m dead.”
She realizes tears are welling in her eyes. For a second she considers lying, but all her other relationships were just about destroyed because of it, she can’t get out of this one.
Only a few weeks after she was outed, Toni was walking down the hallway, she spotted Sasha and Lucette talking near the staircase and moved closer to hear what they were saying.
I've been trying to get in touch with user EQfan74, if you know them or have can contact them, please send them my way.
“No” Tania shook her head, “Are you going to kill me?”
Tania was right. The other girls, even the fat and weak one, were bigger than her. They were all three years older, giving them an advantage, plus they’d had extra years practicing unstructured sparring. But the difference between sparring and combat training was vast.
“911, what’s your emergency?” A polite clipped voice said finally. Toni couldn’t talk, so she just gasped into the phone hoping the operator would hear her.
“I went there once with my aunt. Got lunch, then she had an emergency and had to bring me to this big white room. I sat outside with my book, The Velveteen Rabbit, she argued with them for a little while and then we got ice cream.”
So while she’s sitting in her office listening to Pepper let out every grievance she’s had with Toni for roughly four years, and tunes her out, she lists the ways god screwed her over and if she believed in him she’d be thinking of ways to pay him back.
“Why not?” She says, eyeing the door, wondering if she’d make it. She wouldn’t.
“It’s Bucky.” Steve says, “Bucky Barnes, he must’ve been captured during the war,”
“There’s nothing to tell.”
“Of course not.” She finally found the light switch on the wall and flick one of them, turning on a light nearby, illuminating Nika, strapped to a chair.
“You can’t kill me.” She stammers, “I made you, I created you!”
Now all she had to do was get out of this shit hole prison.
“I just arrived to tidy your room, sir.” She paused, looking around the filth, “We didn’t expect you back so soon.”
There were a few lining the halls in the back of the building, and she started her routine.
“I guess.” Toni shrugs
“Save yourself, this hero thing is total bullshit.” She reached over and found what looked like a first aid kit
“You’re right.” Toni said, standing up with her tray, “I am unhinged, so maybe it’s best for you to take a step back, who knows what I might do?”
She looked around the deserted highway, no one else was there, and she didn’t dare look over the other cars. They might still be alive. She checked her heavy jacket for her phone, praying it hadn’t been destroyed in the crash. The screen was badly cracked, but she managed to pull it out of her pocket without it falling apart.
“What about when you woke up?”
He can’t help the pit in his stomach that hopes that isn’t true.
Tania shook her head. “Rumor has it that your amnesia is bullshit. Nika told us some stuff before she was eliminated. Crazy stuff.”
“You don’t know a damn thing about what I lost.” She spat, “You don’t know what it was like to have a terrorist pointing a pistol at your head yelling, ‘This is for Captain America. Long live the revolution, let the Accords die!’ after he crashed his car into your, killing-”
Instead she was surprisingly receptive to escaping. Maybe she’d been plotting all along like Toni had, maybe she’d been too afraid to hope.
“кандидат в красную комнату?” he says coldly, she doesn’t know what the red room is, or why she’s a candidate, but she doesn’t want to find out. The soldier nods, and a few more people emerge from the car, dressed in black suits like the first man.
The girls say nothing and Madame takes it as acceptance.
Staring out the window is getting old fast, Steve lies beside her fast asleep, and she’s got a pit in her gut waiting for him to wake. He stirred slowly, just as the light from outside hits his face.
“Hey there,” one of the two newscasters sitting at a large white desk said, he was stocky but handsome and his grin never seemed to fade, his partner at the desk was a woman, just as pretty but her smile seemed genuine,
“Just shut up Sasha, I didn’t do anything to you.”
No matter how hard Toni clamped her eyes shut, she couldn’t drown out the wailing. All day and all night she listened to the miserable girl next to her screaming her head off. Toni wanted to stick her head through the thick metal bars they were currently trapped, and break her own neck for a second of peace and quiet.
Being restricted to the wheelchair was worse, but it provided a nice place to rest her head on her hands, while she listened to the Avengers argue back and forth.
“He was tall and scary. He held onto my leg and wouldn’t let go.”
“Ever since I got myself expelled, Maria and Howard decided it was best not to spend money on a school environment until I was mature enough to handle it, so I’ve been homeschooled. But this year since I only have two years on highschool left, and Maria is leaving for a tour across the states with “Mothers of America” I’m going to convince Howard to let me go back to school. Where are you going?”
The black car approached slowly, and a slim man exited the car. He walked calmly towards them and Toni slumped back to the ground.
Two hundred and fifty wins and fifteen losses. She hadn’t lost since Nika died. Twenty seven of those wins have been against Tania, and everytime she trapped her, the older girl wouldn’t stop wiggling and cursing Toni out. But Toni didn’t let go until the Instructor called the match.
Only then would they give her breathing room, less suervaline, and more autonomy.
Toni doesn’t even notice she’s screaming till her arm slips and she falls off the bed. The slick floor makes it hard for her to push herself back up to the bed, so she lies there a moment.
“No.” She said, stopping suddenly, “I’m done making excuses for you. You’re a big boy, and if you don’t like the accords feel free to protest.”
The gunshot cuts her off. It rings throughout the hall. Lara’s body slumps over itself, and a spray of blood covers Svetlana, and a few girls close to her.
Toni nodes, she can’t feel her limbs the longer they walked down the hall. She seems to know exactly where they’re going even without watching Madame.
“Are you almost done?” Toni says, to Natasha
She whipped her head around, the blue alien seemed annoyed, she struggled to her feet, “Does it matter what he thinks anymore? He blew away in the fucking wind.”
“What’s going on Instructor?” Lara asks in a small voice, she doesn’t dare look up at the woman.
Asset: Lucifer
Maximiliano Gómez was poisoned by his lover, and he was killed in Belgium in 1971. I came up with the idea of Toni beginning a fake affair and poisoning her lover before finding Maximiliano Gómez so I think it’s perfect! He was from the Dominican Rep. and the assassin was also killed, plus he was 28, so it doesn’t follow Gómez’s story at all, but I borrowed the name. I also used the date he was killed as the chapter date, but it’s also my other friend's birthday, I have a lot of friends born in May!
Tania sat back in her seat, smiling. Maybe she saw through Toni’s act. She really was shaking.
Lucifer. She wanted to laugh. It seemed like not long ago she was calling Madame the devil, and now the older woman had turned around and branded her with the name. Lucifer.
The mansion was glowing. Reed must be away for the weekend, but Toni hoped he was away for the month, otherwise his son would never get this place clean in time. Filled with drunk people, who always seemed to cling to walls and doorways making travel hard, Toni realized she was much too sober to be there. Her fix was downing 6 full cups of whatever beer they were serving and actually earning a round of applause.
It was almost magic how fast Lucie and Toni clicked, they had the same interests, opinions everything they had was shared. Even secrets.
Toni nods numbly, are they just letting her go out alone?
“Alex,” she muttered, and for a moment she was afraid no one was there to hear it, she didn’t know if she could wait for someone to show up and do it again, but then she heard the shuffle of sneakers next to her, “What was that? What’d you say?”
Before the first mission it didn’t both her much. Like she was used to being slapped and shoved.
She took a long time to write, but we got there! Really excited for the next chapter, and it has a pretty large time jump and will be from Steve's pov, so don't be confused!
That night, as they make their way to their sleeping quarters, Toni is stopped by Madame.
Inside the large mansion, girls filter in and out the doors. It almost looks like a boarding school, they’re all wearing uniforms, and a few carry books, but the image is ruined by the details. Most of them look like they’ve been crying, a few have bruises up and down their limbs, and all of them have an angry red mark around their left hand.
Steve crashes through windows and doors after him and almost doesn’t notice the figure right behind him.
-April 4th national tell a lie day, big theme in chapter 3
“Yeah, I’ll try not to make a mess.”
“He’s not in control. He doesn’t know what he’s doing!”
“I’m alright, fell on my hip. Probably gonna leave a scar right on above it.”
“Well you’re either pregnant, in withdrawal, or have a serious illness and we should get you to the hospital.”
Her mouth was raw and sore, she clutched her neck and could already tell where bruises from his death grip will appear soon.
The first time they met face to face, he screamed about something unimportant. His face flared red, and his eyes squinted like little bugs. She hated him.
“Hello darling.” She snaps to attention, and turns to the front. A tall blond woman sits on a heavy black desk. Everything about her is pointy, her bones almost poke out, her dress sticks out to a triangle, and especially the sharp high heels she taps on the ground.
“I don’t know.” Toni replied
The pilot gives her a cordial wave as she jumps off the aircraft, and wastes no time taking off again.
They didn’t really. No one said anything to their faces, the gossip magazines must not have gotten word yet, or maybe they were still caught up on her boobs.
“Do you know?”
The Instructors are tight lipped and agitated the next morning. Breakfast is quiet and quick, the other girls sensing the Instructors change in attitude too.
(See the end of the chapter for
July 12th came and went with no fuss at all. She allowed herself ten minutes to look at the small box in her attic filled with tiny toys, onesies, and ultrasounds.
“OK.” He says getting up, then helping her. “Come back. We’ll talk. I don’t want secrets, I don’t want us to crack.”
“Why don’t you have a roommate?” Sasha asks one day
Toni stood beside Tania in silence, but an agreement had been formed.
Sasha laughed, “Speaking of stuffy, did you hear who’s attending this year?”
All she gets is a severe look, “Come by my office later today, I’ll take over from here.”
“You’re guilty.” Steve continued, as if she’d said nothing, “You created Ultron, and you skipped out on fighting him, because you were mad I wouldn’t tell everyone I liked you. Are you really so insecure?”
“I was bugging a hotel room. He came back early, if I left or tried to fight him, it would’ve blown my cover.”
“What?”
With Sam in the sky, Amanda and Nat on the ground it almost looks like he’s about to go down when he suddenly kicks Natasha to the ground with one leg.
“Well you found me.” Toni said, she grabbed her small bag and made out the door towards Nika, “Woah, where are you going?” She peers in the room, “What’re you doing here?”
“No. I remembered being dragged into a room, strapped down to a machine, it hurt so badly and when I woke up, everything was almost blank.” She pauses, “But they lied. They said my parents were Henrik and Marzia. That they sold me. And my name was Antonia. But I saw my file on a table nearby and read everything written about me. That’s all I know.”
“It’s been me.” Toni pauses, “I killed every instructor, every handler, ever one I could find.”
Target: Judyta Marek
She smiled, “She was my aunt.”
It took some doing to prove her identity, thankfully Howard kept a DNA sample in the books in case an illegitimate heir showed up after he died. But she did it, and she was one hundred percent his daughter.
“You? Oh no, there’s been a misunderstanding. I meant my performance. I think I really sold it. You were alright too, though.” He said, leaning down for a kiss.
It’d been satisfying to try on Pointe shoes first. The satisfaction wore off when she tried to use them. Her toes bled most nights, she had to clean the shoes herself.
“Really? Howard?” He shrugs and she has no idea what he means, while at the same time betting he wonders if he ever gave up common whore and hard liquor for marriage, which he didn’t.
“No.”
“Yes.” Toni replies, “I needed you to trust me.”
It was a while before they stopped, the doctor had gone without a word. She slowly rose from the bed, the pain in her stomach was just a faint burning.
“Thank you Toni.” Coulson says, “SHIELD and America thanks you.”
What would stop them from using this opportunity to kill two birds?
“Don’t do that!” He says, she gets her jeans on and starts out the door, “I’m not the bad guy here! I just liked what we have, and you can’t commit to being Iron Maiden or Toni Stark, how can you commit to a relationship?” He catches her arm on her way out the door, turning her back to him.
Klara ambled towards her, but she hit the girl in the neck with her open hand, sending her tumbling. The two girls fled towards the door.
Toni bit her lip nervously, the wave of nausea over and she slid to the tile floor, looking at her feet not answering.
So she skips her library, and email session. She calls herself with breath techniques, and just waltz’s down to the cafeteria by herself. And sure enough, her computer is back in her room when she gets back. She’s not naive enough to think she just missed it when she first looked, or that she scared Sasha into giving it back. She knows they got whatever that wanted off it and now she’ll just wait for the other shoe to drop.
But Mother wasn't glaring at Antoinette, she was glaring at Francesca, who was glaring right back.
“Hmm. Trouble’s like this did run in your family. Of course, your father would never admit it, not the great Ho-”
The doctor looked down at his shoes, and said nothing. Rhodey walked slowly towards the bed she laid on, and touched her shoulder, “Toni.” She said nothing, finally letting her face crumble. The tears finally slide down her far as she turned to Rhodey and pulled him in for a hug. She still couldn’t sit up so he knelt down beside her and laid his head of her arms as she sobbed with him silently.
He must’ve mistook her widened eyes for panic at losing her job, rather than fear of being caught. He heard her silence as evidence that she couldn’t leave, he took the opportunity to press his lips to hers, stilling holding her arm tightly.
Toni tried not to look at the other girl, she’d seen too much of herself in that moment. And she needed to be strong.
Mystery brunette seemed okay with the arrangement, and she followed him up stair to a large red bed in a room lined with mirrors and windows.
Toni wishes she’d been wrong. She wishes Sasha could have looked over the two weeks they spent together, and realized their friendship isn't superficial and over looked her family history.
Toni only rolled her eyes, “Happy to see me, Utkyn? When it comes down to it, you’re really gonna have to get over that crush.”
Toni laughs, but it’s forced, “It was a nightmare not weak bladder syndrome, you really should study hard in biology, or you’ll fall even more behind.”
“At least we did it together, right?” She murmured, but she saw the look on his face and knew he’d heard her, “Together. Except the people who got killed.”
He’s so distracted he almost doesn’t see the soldier coming from the side with a machine gun, but he cocks his shield in time.
Date: May 25, 1994
“Where’d she go?” Toni says
She didn’t remember anything. A common one, Toni had to announce this weekly, sometimes daily, to her classmates and Instructors.
Her black blanket and clothing gave her camo in the night, all she had to do was hide her skin, which was so pale she’d been called translucent.
“He’s perfection. The product of Hydra sciences and Red Room psychology, they engineered the perfect soldier.”
Thankfully, it wasn’t long till another girl, Svetlana, got on Pointe, Katya and Lidia followed her. Now only Nika and Lara weren’t using Pointe shoes.
“No. I didn’t think I’d accidentally knocked my cute neighbor to the ground.”
Steve looks at her a second before saying, “You wear glasses?”
“I don’t know. They sent me a folder with the information but its’ a closed adoption. I didn’t look.”
“You are not wrong.” She’s about to give in, and have her meeting pushed when a phone rings across the hall. She doesn’t have a landline, and it’s not her stark phone ringing. It’s the burner phone she gave a very specific person to call her with in emergency ten years ago. She shoots out of bed, managing to lift Steve’s arm even,
“No no, I was pretty much running down the hall. It’s my fault-” He started, and joined her in picking up the papers, they were almost all mail, labeled with the name 'Eugenia Wilson’. He squinted at the paper a moment before looking up at her, “Eugenia?”
Toni is surprised, she expected questions about when, where, maybe about Maia or their relationship. She doesn’t see why this matters.
She hadn’t been in NYC Children’s Center in awhile, since a ribbon cutting ceremony in the nineties.
She walked down the corridor alone and confused as to what she’d seen. She got herself into bed, and stared at the ceiling frustrated because she didn’t have any answers.
“My aunt.” She chuckled, “She’s kind of an insomniac.”
“Ms. Stark.” She looks up, the mirror across the room, she sees her reflection. Her hair is matted to the sides of her head, and little white strips of paper cover cuts across her cheeks. Her eyes are bloodshot, and wild.
She doesn’t recognize herself in the mirror most days, she can only see the similarities between herself and the tall dark man who killed her family, terrified and terrifying.
And she certainly intended to.
Her face was plain and expressionless, and they wordlessly said goodbye.
“No.” Manya says, “My father granted me the autonomy to choose my husband, more than other girls get. I never picked anyone, and now I’m nearly thirty and unmarried. Practically an old hag.”
Toni slips off the gloves, and pulls the pads onto her palms, barely in time to cover them before Nika starts hitting. She hits hard, and has good form and posture, but she puts too much into each punch. She’ll tire herself out like that.
Tera paused, “Toni that only leaves, pregnant. Who’s the last person you had sex with and did you wear protection?”
This is what she loved about Lucie. She didn’t judge or assume, maybe because she was in a similar position, or maybe that’s just how Lucie was.
They sat in silence for a beat before Toni asked, “What’s the worst thing you’ve ever said?”
“We can’t have a crazy asset running around, can we.”
“It’s shortened.”
Toni nodded, and Madame smiled, “I have something to tell you. An offer. Leave your life behind, swear loyalty and you will be rewarded. Submit or be submitted.”
She set them down outside the compound, and she almost didn’t believe she was home because she’d dreamed this so many times.
“The fire cone outside pulls off red better than she did.”
“Have you ever loved another girl, besides Francesca?”
“I know.” And she leans in quickly, planting a soft kiss before turning to go, “It wouldn’t be long till someone tracks down who I really am, I’ve got to get ahead of it.”
“Do you have any idea how that happened by the way? You being alive, I mean. Besides the super serum, which really shouldn’t have worked that well by the way, it’s just not possible, because even if your were suspended and survive the shock of freezing, you still need air. What are the chances a channel of ice breaks right next to your nose or mouth! Like point seven million I’d guess!”
“I’m busy antoinette.”
“So you’re keeping Captain America hostage? I mean I found him so if anyone should get to keep him hostage, it should be me. By the way, no one has thanked me for discovering our ‘national treasure’ possibly saving him even.”
“They didn’t say.”
“You are so smart and I know you know that, I know you think because you’re light years ahead of these kids mathematically or scientifically you can never be friends with them or you can never socially interact but it’s just not true. You have your parents' personalities too, not just their brains. Your dad’s wit, your moms charisma, just because you’ve had bad experiences doesn’t mean you should ever, ever let them define you.”
The blood splattered all over Toni. She’s given a washcloth and a new shirt. She walks towards the sleeping quarters alone, two empty beds lie in her class’s section, and they’ll not be used for a long time.
Now more than ever, she wishes he’d just killed her too.
“And what exactly am I?”
“Whatever it takes.”
“Yeah. Howard’s daughter.”
He turns back, having been handed a gun, but Natasha shoves the man out of the way and disarms Pierce. Toni rushes another guard, it’s over in just a few seconds, Toni didn’t see much of what Natasha had done.
She falls right to the ground gasping but the Bucky recovers faster, he stands quickly and looks at Steve. He just stares.
“Bull? Yeah. I didn’t need another ‘Stark Goes Off The Deep End At Parents Memorial’ headline. It’s easier to just fake it.”
“Yea yeah. I remember that. I told her who funds your education. Have any schools in mind?”
“You’ve impressed me over the years. You’re reliable, skilled, and intelligent. You won’t be hard to commission.”
Maybe if it wasn’t two in the morning she could’ve snarked back, but the plane ride home was bumpy and terrifying, so she hadn’t slept in nearly a day.
“What?” Toni responds,
Surprised, he nearly falls from both of their combined weight, and they’re back to brawling again.
“What kind of name is Antoinette? I mean there is just not a good shortening to it.”
Her eyes burn along with her throat, and tears line her eyes. Slowly they fall down her face and she struggles against the gurney. No. no. no. no. She can’t let Alex die, not like this.
She sat down opposite Tania, “I know. I know.”
“Subject appears to be breathing. Vitals are strong, but hypothermia is present.” What.
She gestures towards the woman and the soldier fighting, “It won’t be long till he pushes her off again, and he’ll turn back to us. Four against one is better odds.”
“I can’t tell if you’re giving hints or leading us off the scent.”
Steve looks back to the shooter, is this his backup? He looks just as confused though? Suddenly, two hands appear on either side of the hook, gripping the concrete wall. They tense, and slowly pulled up to reveal a woman.
With one ear pressed against it, he could hear the faint hum of classical music, nothing else.
She can’t.
Would they remember her? Or just her greatest failure? Her greatest loss.
Just clips like, “Little Annie Stark! Are we supposed to believe she’s going to inherit that company?”
Francesca nodded, smiling to herself, “Yes, yes he did.”
“Yes.”
She left a week after he died, there weren’t any more tears left in her whole body, they’d all been cried out at his funeral. All of them fake.
Toni replays Madame’s crass, callus words in her mind as she walks down the hallway.
“I’m not an asset anymore.”
Asset: Lucifer
Steve’s head snapped upwards, “Where?”
“They might. You’ll be better off trying than, calling it quits in this god forsaken forest.”
“He saw too much.” the man remarked coldly, “Come now, Madame is not one to keep waiting.”
With that, he’s out the door. If Kate started to protest, Steve didn’t hear her.
They sleep restlessly, and get up silently. As a class they move together, but like zombies. It’s Tania that talks first. “Get out of my way Sobol.”
“Howard? Maria says it’s time to go.” Toni said loudly, projecting over the girls shrill voices.
Toni didn’t reply, so she continued, “What about Petra? Katya? Or was this how you did it to Tania?”
Toni sighs, and pulls the mask from her face, Pierce starts to turn but she steps closer and rests the but of the gun on his back. “I’ll bet you look just like your father. I’ve heard your just as smart as him.”
Toni sighed, it would be a good job. She wouldn’t be bored, she could sleep at night. Plus working for HYDRA and the Red Room’s archenemy would be satisfying. But she wasn’t ready to be taking missions from anyone but herself for a while, and she already had one on her mind.
“Antonia.” She says, which surprises her, first names are rarely exchanged, mostly last names or in Toni’s case, убийца, монстр, демон. Murderer, monster, demon.
-Had to come to terms with the fact I couldn’t rewatch the entire movie to get all these scenes correct. If you’re reading this, you probably watched the movie, so I tried to stick to scenes that would be changed by Toni’s presence.
The man paused, and gulped, “Not if it was your switch.” He chucked the thin glass of champagne to the ground, where it shattered.
She lived in a different world from everyone else. They all seemed so naive, and carefree. All she could do most days was count down till her due date.
She wakes up in bed, a very muscular arm draped around her. Not a bad way to wake up.
“Steve.” She replied, “Is it just you?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Toni had been last to return from her mission. Eva looked most put together, in uniform and braids, while Tania was in uniform, it looked rushed and her hair was gathered in a bun.
“I did what I had to do, to get away from you.”
“Stop.” Madame says, the guards, Toni and Katya look to her, “Take Sobol too.”
“I was a little preoccupied.” She said, her lip curving into a smile, “Starving and injured.”
“That father of my girlfriends daughter? Yeah!”
Toni found that the soldier, Barnes, getting away didn’t affect her very much. Steve and Fury hesitantly told her, as if expecting her to bolt the second she could to hunt him down. She assured them that she wasn’t planning on murdering anyone in the near future.
She pressed the pistol to Tania’s head. The older girl closes her eyes, but she’s smiling as she softly mutters to herself, “This is it. My big break.”
“It’s going to ease him in to modern society, it’s the easiest-”
The strong doors that held her in all these years opened wide, but Toni didn’t think the toll had been worth it. The baggage she carried with her made her hands and backache, but it was too late to turn around.
But Eva followed her, “Oh we’re not afraid of you. We’re afraid of what you might do to civilians.” She was following so close she might’ve stepped on her heels.
This is literally almost done. The next two chapters are really short, like 10 between the two of them. Jesus. Thanks again to my beta, you're a godsend.
Toni was stuck in the middle, which she hated. But there was little time to dwell, they all looked towards Madame standing in front of them, waiting expectantly.
The dress was fine, as were all the others, Toni just hated the party.
“I heard gunfire and thought you’d finally bit it. Color me surprised.” Tania said with a smirk,
Zma quickly put a stop to it with the flick of her wrist, she knocked the hand of a girl picking at her leotard, and she cried out.
Toni exhaled deeply, and Katya struggled under her harder. Deep down, they both knew there was no way she’d win this fight, but neither wanted Katya to die.
“This isn’t purgatory.” Toni whispered, “This is hell.”
“It’s not like you don’t punch back Sobol.” Nika says, starting to hit again, this time slower and more focused, “And you got here in year eleven.”
She turned to him, her gaze piercing his eyes, “Why change things up now?”
Tania scoffed, but no one argued with the Instructor. She took their silence as acceptance and led them to the next class.
But Toni grapples with her pistol and ducks to the ground as the first wave of bullets floods their campsite. She lets off a few shots, but none of them hit. Her rifle in her bag near the other side of the clearing.
Kozlov nodded, and moved on to the next girl in line. She skipped a girl every few questions, but Toni knew she wouldn’t be missed. Kozlov had a special hatred from her, she didn’t know why.
“We should go. We’ll be late.”
“No I’m serious. I live like a block away. Pep and Rhodey are going home after this. They won’t expect me. I’m sober so I can’t offer you any booze but I’ve got like a case of sprite and redbull.”
“Who was that?” Steve walks down the hall putting on a shirt, “What’s wrong Tones?”
“Oh yeah?” She grinned, “What’s it cost?”
“Shhh. Your sacrifice is for Mother Russia.”
“Whatever you’ve done doesn’t matter now. You redeemed yourself.”
Toni smiles, the bartender pours them, and hands over the glasses, both Toni and the woman drink. “Not my friend, but you’re still drinking.”
“First of all, it’s not illegal to be gay in America, and I thought Lucie and I had a passionate romance through sixth grade, if you keep changing your story, the court will never believe you.”
“I guess I forgot how mad I was supposed to be when I saw how beautiful you are.” Steve grinned,
“I was in the backseat.”
Steve’s mind goes blank, he’s too far away to help her. He’s a supersoldier, he can crush her windpipe with a finger. If only he had something to throw at him. Like a shield. If only he had a shield.
“Toni.” Natasha says, “An asset never misses.”
“Who’s that?” Antoinette asks,
“That’s fine, I have to go anyways.” She gathered her clothes, and thanked god they were casual, so she didn’t look like a total slut doing the walk of shame.
She leaves the headquarters in a faze, calling a ride home, and mulls over the day. It was a big day. Captain America is alive, found, kinda funny, but thinks of her as Howard’s daughter because of course he does. It’s like the universe found out she felt back to normal so it yelled, surprise surprise bitch.
He struggles to his feet anyway, hoping to buy time for Sam and Nat regroup and join him, when black grappling hook lodges itself in the sidewall of the highway, both Steve and the soldier look towards the hook embedded in the concrete, pausing a moment.
Almost cried at all the comments I got all of a sudden. There's a special place in heaven for y'all. I don't know when I'm getting 3 done, haven't even started editing yet, but I'll do my best. I'm going camping this weekend, and seeing Endgame tomorrow so probably mid next week.
She’d brought some jeans, a little ripped from working on her car, and a plain black T shirt and vans. She didn’t bring any more underwear so they thong stayed.
So Toni goes all guns a blazing on hydra, you'll laugh, you'll cry, it'll be better than Cats.
“You’re supposed to be sleeping.” She says smiling,
“You think I don’t know that?” She replied, “Years of these taunts, and you never broke, never sunk to their level. You were my example to others. Why now?”
“What? What’s so stupid?”
I've been trying to get in touch with user EQfan74, if you know them or have can contact them, please send them my way.
“Of course, the party is officially for a fantastic second quarter of the business year,” Manya says, “I’ll let you in on a little secret: They don’t usually hold balls for successful business seasons, but they’re always looking for beautiful women to marry off.”
“I’m sorry.” Toni says, “I didn’t mean to make the Tania situation worse.”
“I want to know how you got your name.”
“So. You have a daughter.”
In a flurry of movement, all the girls shed their plaid skirts and button up shirts, and slipped on the black leotard, it pulled at Toni’s thighs in an uncomfortable way, and she saw other girls picked at the hemline of theirs too.
Deep down Toni must’ve known some of the other girls didn’t want to be there just as much as she didn’t. Lidia certainly didn’t want to be there, Nika had pretty much been sold off to them. But if anyone was supposed to be loyal to ‘Mother Russia’ it was Tania Utkyn. Or so she thought.
She fell suddenly, her knees hurt from the force of her fall. Steve gripped her arms to steady her, and she managed to send him a smirk before all the lights went out.
“How long did you know?” Rhodey said once she was standing
The grade school she was at was private, just like all the other schools she’d been to. It had itchy, ugly uniforms and strict teachers, Annie personally thought they should unionize to get better pay, more flexible hours, and benefits but no one listened. The girls there were much nicer than previous schools, Annie figured their awareness of her family, and fortune might have something to do with that but they all came from fairly wealthy families so she gave them the benefit of the doubt. She actually had a group of people she hung out with, well hung out with is a strong word, she sat with them class, and lunch and mostly agreed with whatever they said and didn’t say anything.
“You killed her.” Toni says, “You and Instructor Matveev.”
Only Toni and Tania remained, Tania looked up, “You’ve done it now, Sobol.”
She whipped around again, “The soldier? So you did meet him.”
All the displays of ruthlessness and strength bought her no good will with Eva, who now rallied younger girls against them both.
“So we’re not going to kill each other?” Toni asked suddenly,
Time: 1900
“Maybe you don’t deserve to be treated like a person. Maybe you’re a monster.” Katya says
“You think Madame would allow that?” Tania says,
She wasn’t alone.
Tania sighed, “Do you think we would’ve liked each other?”
Whew thats 13, I hope you realize the pain and suffering I went through for this, and drop a like or comment. It's been a thirteen day process of posting these and I look forward to hearing your reactions!
The candidates stood from their chairs and approached her, lining up one by one with their hands placed on the small of their backs, Eva shifted away from Toni unnaturally, and stiffened whenever she got too close.
An unlikely sight. The two hated each other. Madame was near them, all waiting, so she quickly walked up the steps and met them.
“I’m not going to die here. Not like Tania, or Nika, or all the other girls.” Eva said as she held Toni’s legs down with her legs, and tried to wrestle the gun from her hand. She considered letting go for a moment. Giving Eva the gun and surrendering.
“You talked to her?”
“I’m not dying. I’m escaping.”
The ride there is long and boring, she doubts the pilot wants to talk, so she leaves the small room, closing the duffle bag and her school uniform inside, and sits in the only passenger seat in the back.
The hallways are a maze, and she doesn’t try to mask her footsteps,
Whoever got in Tania’s bad graces during the week was exiled to fight Toni at the end of it. She almost always beat them, they got laughed at, and then they kissed ass till they were back on her good  side.
“Just shut up Maria. I don’t need this right now.”
“I’m being sold already?” Toni said, a quip about being rescued from a whore house was on the tip of her tongue and only by the grace of God did she resist.
The next week they were sparring again, but Toni couldn’t muster up much energy.
A woman stood in the corned between the door and the wall, and watched the girls walk in, she held a large black bag behind her, that swung as she approached them.
“Yeah actually it is. What’s not fair is a group of psycho terrorists murdering my baby!” She cried, and took a deep breath, “And I’m getting pretty fucking fucking tired of people telling how to feel!”
“Well, there’s only two more files left so while they get her we can finish up.”
Toni finished working out faster than normal, she started to pack up her stuff and return to the sleeping quarters when she hears the shuffle of footsteps.
“I always eat at six, judging by how hungry I am, I’ve missed two meals. The men wouldn’t let me speak English because I would draw attention, but I was allowed to speak Russian. From my knowledge of Russia, most settlements are big clusters of cities, or lone villages. And I’m mildly allergic to chloroform, it gives me a stomach ache.”
“I should be his backup then. I won’t hesitate.”
“She kissed Lucie.” “I heard she’s a lesbian.” “ She got her roomate sent away because she rejected her.”
He left in a hurry, busy with secret organizations to glue back together, and Toni returned to Steve’s room.
Tania shook her head, and they stood there in silence for a few moments.
“When did I say that?”
Finally Steve broke the quiet, “You aren’t pregnant.”
The sound was familiar. Gunfire, Toni decided. Eva had stopped right in front of the table, but was turned towards the door now. Tania must’ve been caught not far from here, and was probably dead.
I accidentally post this as my third chapter, oh well
Has it been 2 and a half months since I posted? Yes. Do I have an excuse? No. Am I sorry? Yes. Will I ever learn? No. God bless my beta, idk why she puts up with me. I'm excited for y'all to read the notes I made while writing this whole thing because you'll get to experience no less than two mental breakdowns(as of now). Junior year kicked my ass, writing kicked my ass, we really aren't thriving, but I love getting notifications that my subscriptions have been updated so this is your no nut November gifts your welcome.
Toni can hardly breathe after a while, flashes of one night stand in Moscow pass through her head, Tania’s face makes a brief appearance when a memory of them in the stairwell after a day of sparring comes to mind. She can’t tell what’s real, happening right then, and what happened years ago.
She’d won the match, Petra knew it. But she still squirmed under her tight hold as if getting free would be enough to win.
Toni approaches the door hesitantly, but opens it in one pull, the rush of the rising sun blinds her as she looks at the huge backyard of the Red Room.
He stalked off into the night, leaving one guard to finish the job. Toni took care of him rather quickly and uncovered the body from a hidden closet in the garage. It’d been no easy task sneaking it in that morning.
“Alive? Yes. She’s taken over SI. Her name’s Antoinette, but she goes by Toni.”
“Leave.” She said back, she didn’t think her whisper would carry in the wind, but they responded, “The wizard was very clear in emphasizing how it important it was you stayed alive, so I cannot.”
She tried to pull away at first, but soon he’d backed her up to the wall, and the arm that wasn’t steadying her was groping at the edge of her skirt, pulling up and up. She cried out and smiled, maybe it sounded like moaning to him, maybe he liked that she was afraid.
“That’s quite enough.” Zma said, “You’ve been knocked down Ms. Utkyn.”
“Kate?”
“That’s where he grabbed me. That’s how he held me against the wall.”
Toni walked up at a reluctant pace and Zma waved her hand impatiently. She positioned Toni in front of the girls, “There are three things you want the audience to focus on during a dance,” she gestured to her face, her fingers tracing the sharp bone of Toni’s jaw, “the face,” she began, then she moved down the her hips and set both hands lightly on top her her pelvic bones, “The end of your torso,” and finally she gestured down to her neatly tied ballet flats, “And of course the feet.”
A shocked Tania raised her hands, “Don’t shoot!”
She got out though, fighting tooth and nail to make sure she and Yinsen, made it out alive. Of course, he had to sacrifice himself though, and she couldn’t stop him.
“Why are you helping me?” Toni mumbled
“Hopefully not too far.” She said, turning towards the stairs
“No she doesn’t.” Tania says slowly,
The flash drive was still in his pocket, he checks it every few minutes to make sure it was still there.
“We’re not dumb.” Katya says, “She was annoying you so you told your bestest friend ever that she was a threat, and they eliminated her.”
The devil, Toni thought, but she didn’t respond.
“I mean, I’m obviously not going to be the final candidate.” Nika says, “I was chosen from my town. My parents wanted to send my brother Dima to school. They were given a fair amount for me, my sister was less lucky.”
The lady smiled, “I am your mentor now, you may call me Madame.”
“Wow, I feel like I haven’t seen you in.. four years.”
Between Sokovia and all the other Avenger Operations, they’d made a mess. Maybe they should answer for it? After all, they had all this responsibility.
Toni tries not to let the words get to her. She knows they’re a ploy. If she lets her guard down, Shvets won’t waste a second killing her. She won’t hesitate as Toni does.
In the meantime, they had a meeting to crash. Toni could see how easy it was for HYDRA to hide within SHIELD all these years, as it was child’s play to sneak into the base of operations.
After a rather hard kick, the woman is pushed to the ground and the soldier seems to remember he was originally after the three of them, and he grabs another pistol out of some deep pocket or and lines up his shot.
“Well I hate to intrude on you ‘me time’ candidate.” She paused a moment, “Why don’t you start waking up an hour early so you’ll have plenty of time to get ready in the morning.”
Did Madame know she was being sold her her parent’s killers? Did she care? Antonia Sobol didn’t remember the conversation, even with her perfect memory, it happened over a decade ago, she shouldn’t have memorized the speech Madame presented her with.
“Revenge?” Pierce asks,
Katya was dead, and everyone thought Toni killed her.
“Take the pill.”
She blinked, “You’re on the run from almost every government on Earth. You don’t have a job, or a home.”
The candidates of Toni's class are assigned a small mission, the three lowest girls in the class are given rifles, while Toni and Tania are told to run. Everyone wants Toni dead, and she's cornered in a room with one of the girls, when they hear gunfire from outside. They investigate and Mila's been shot, Eva is distraught, and Toni takes advantage, forcing her to walk to the exit at gunpoint and ending the mission. Because Toni 'won' the mission, she's awarded a real life assignment. The object is to plant small bugs in the hotel room of a Ukrainian man, and she does. However he arrives back to the hotel early, and forces her to preform oral sex. A mysterious agent appears, and injects him with an anesthetic, before leading her out of the hotel. She realizes the agent was the infamous Black Widow. She rides home and thinks the universe is punishing her for all her actions in the Red Room, but has her icy exterior back in place by the time she arrives at the mansion.
She was agile, small boned and unassuming. Anyone looking at her could tell she didn’t know how to fight. She could use it, get stronger, learn all the moves in secret, and then take them by surprise.
He wasn’t just a nanny, but a butler and an impromptu personal stylist. He earned that title two hours before Annie’s first red carpet appearance, some award show. Father was friends with a actress up for an award, when her official personal stylist not only got her size wrong but apparently her age, the now six year old would not fit into the bright pink tutu built for a three or four year old, not that she’d wear it anyways. Jarvis, always to the rescue, returned from Annie’s large closet with a crimson dress that had never been worn and was forgotten in the back. It was fancy enough, so she changed quickly, record time in fact, and even though the rest of the carpet was a blur that she couldn’t recall if she tried, which was very rare for her, she had a photographic memory, she kept the dress, and she liked the color.
The tabloids noticed too, dubbing Toni an adult which apparently meant people could make jokes about her, sexual jokes. She didn’t mind really, some of them were funny, but she couldn’t help but wonder if they knew she was thirteen or were just choosing to ignore it. She’d found a countdown timer to her eighteenth birthday on a site filled with young celebrities legal birthdays.
“The set stage?” Toni asks, “Filming something Coulson?”
“And who exactly is that?” Nick says finally after catching Steve up on what’s really been going on in SHIELD- or Hydra.
“Annie! I saw you at the Oscars on TV last night!” the other girls nodded enthusiastically, some more than others.
TMZ noticed their relationship, and honestly it’s about time. They weren’t even being subtle about it. So now between ‘look how far she’s come’ Toni also see’s ‘spiraling after girlfriend leaves’ stories on the front cover of teeny magazines.
If Maria had ever been surprised in her life, it was that moment. She didn’t look angry, but impressed and considerate. She glanced towards Howard for a moment before standing up and silently returning to her room. Toni stormed out the front doors ignoring Howard’s angry cries.
Just as she was giving up for the afternoon, she heard a rustling coming from a hallway she’d not yet gone through.
The instructions are clear, the stealth suit goes on underneath the maid uniform, her hair should be kept up in a ponytail, and the bugs go in her pockets, until she’s ready to place them.
“Please go.”
She slowly turned her head away from the window she’s been staring out, and made eye contact with him. “You fought Thanos, did he give you can't clue as to his plan for after the snap? Did you find any coordinates while you were stranded?”
Toni shook her head, and Manya smiled, “Want a tour?”
But she did it, after submitting to a full psychological evaluation, they had no more excuses. And she became the CEO.
“You will.”
“Well, I think you took the skematics and put it into production without giving me any credit.”
Tania became more bold after Svetlana’s death. Challenging anyone who’d rise to her bait, and in turn, she stopped bothering Toni as much. Probably since Toni stopped sniping back, but also since she was the only one who Tania couldn’t beat.
Toni did her best not to think about it again, she crashed with Tera, refrained from partying because obviously she makes terrible decisions while drunk. Sure she went out, but after analyzing the past few weeks, she’s probably ought to cool it before she hurts herself.
Toni was confused, which was a rare occurrence for her. This was obviously a ballet studio, not a boxing ring like she’d been expecting.
“Lucie! I’ve been looking all around for you! Maria said you’d be here.”
“It wasn’t true.” Toni says defensively, “Nika lied, and she died for it.”
Toni stands up first, and with just a glance at Tania she sees something wrong.
(See the end of the chapter for
But she didn’t, she sneered at Toni in the hallways and called her everything but Toni, Annie Anna, Netti, Antoinette. Every name had a sting to it.
She motioned to a nearby couch that looked relatively clean. Cleaner than the others.
Toni looked towards the Instructor for permission to let go, but her eyes widened when she saw Madame standing next to the Instructor.
“What do you mean?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Tania whipped around, “What the fuck is that supposed to mean?”
But that’s where the similarities end.
Tania was second to reach Pointe shoes, so the teacher often made them do duets together.
Date: August 1st, 2018
Not crack as in drugs
“We managed to save you, thank goodness, your sister Ursula was less fortunate.” She gestured behind her, where two men in black suits wheeled away a gurney covered with a grey cloth, presumably carrying her sister.
“What did he do to you?” Steve says, finally catching up to her, “I know what kind of missions he was sent on.”
I'm ashamed to say I used the word 'whom' in this chapter. Hate me if you will but the free website Paper Rater (great too for writing essays and fanfics, this chapter is not sponsered by Paper Rater thou,) reccomended I do and I almost didn't because I didn't want to sound pretentious but I checked and it's gramatically correct and the character who said it seems the the person who'd say it even if it wasn't gramaticlly correct so I put it in there.
Toni had no idea if they were right. Maybe she was a lesbian, to be fair she did kiss a girl. But if she was a lesbian, why was she hurt or offended when someone called her a lesbian? If she was attracted to girls it shouldn’t insult her right? Rhodey assured her earlier that week that it was ok to be offended, because her classmates weren’t exactly celebrating her sexuality, they were demonizing it.
“Yes I’m aware, he’s official stealing something I spent millions of dollars to discover.” Ok, maybe she cared a little.
While she’d been thinking, one of the cars behind her had pulled up, and was getting dangerously close, she unthinkingly bent down to dodge bullets, right as she crashed into the car blocking her.
The second guy is on the roof with a pistol, he shoots a few rounds at the knocking Steve out of his shock. Before he can try again the metal man jumps off the building, and when Steve makes it to the ledge he’s nowhere to be found.
Not really.
“Do you regret it?”
“Well she might as well have a gold spoon up her ass, and a diamond crown in her head.”
They seemed paralyzed in their spots, so she wiped the drops from her eyes, and whispered, “Go.”
Toni’s hand rested on her back, when Zma snatched them, “They should never think of your hands, or what’s in them for that matter.” She tapped Toni on the back as if to say ‘you’re done now.’
She looked to Jarvis with tear stains down her cheeks, and spot of wet all down her shirt, “Jarvis! I can’t do it!”
All he can make out is the glint of a metal encasing his arm like it’s made of it.
“Pittsford High, it’s in New York. Hey, if Howard lets you choose any school you want, you should just come there!”
The way out of the hotel was quicker and darker, they took staircases and side hallways. A black car was waiting in the alley, and Toni turned to the woman to say thank you and goodbye, but she stood down the hallway.
He walks down the halls with purpose, and never pauses a moment to consider which identical corridor to take, he must be familiar with this place. He ignores the questions she pesters him with for the rest of their walk. Finally, she follows him silently, till he stops outside a large set of wooden doors.
“I don’t know what’s true.” Toni says, her head hurts trying to remember. All she can see are flashes of a life she lost, that feel more like dreams. “They did something to me.”
He begrudgingly raises his hands and starts to kneel, and lets himself be taken into the transport van.
As if reading her mind, they squashed any hope of escaping, she pretended not to care about the surveillance, “What is my mission?”
“No, he had another child in nineteen eighty six, a girl.”
Manya glances at her a moment, almost longingly, like if they were a little closer, or it was a little later, she might have gone for it. Instead, she pulled away, “I’m probably being missed at the party. You are. We should return.”
“If you’re just going to lie then what’s the point of escaping? You’ll still be their drone.”
No one gossips.
She runs a hand through her hair, and thank god she managed to put a shirt on before Eva arrived, she uses it to wipe away her tears,
“You punched a kindergartener!” Lucie exclaimed, they were lying opposite on Lucie’s bed. Toni’s feet on the pillows, Lucie’s head on the pillows.
He ruined the moment, “Who’s the father?”
You deserve it. She thought to herself.
“Walk with me darling.” She says, and Toni follows her to a familiar room. It’s so darks she can’t see very far, let alone to the back.
“Madame. Utkyn. Shvets.” Toni said,
Toni pitied her, she was a pretty thing. Probably fourteen, maybe fifteen. The rest of the prisoners, besides Toni, were in their late fifties.
“Well aren’t we?”
And her enthusiasm is squashed yet again, why does he keep bringing up Howard? To be fair he doesn’t know the dick head he became, but still.
Been told there are some continuity issues, and they're right. I'll reedit later, but I was honestly just trying to get all chapters out. If you want more, I'm seeing Endgame tonight so I'll probably write a story around that once I've healed emotionally. Peace.
“Yeah? And what do you need? Your little slut?”
She was right. Poison was very difficult, too much and it’s suspicious, too little and there’s no effect.
“I’m not telling. Besides, maybe it was my fault. Maybe I embarresed myself and can never face them again.”
The girls surrounded her, mostly not from her class, as there were only three other girls remaining. Klara, Eva, Tania and Toni. Tania hardly bothered her anymore, in fact, she became a target herself.
She blinked, “I’m not.”
They could tell when Steve and Sam’s assault on the helicarriers began, the gunfire and missiles coming from outside tipped them off. Unfortunately, they had to sit through Pierce’s entire evil villainous speech before he finally gave them an opportunity.
She woke up with a start, completely wet. Two girls stood in front of her, probably about fourteen, but their expressions, and wide eyes made them look younger. Between them sat a large grey pot.
“Toni?” Steve calls, “I’m in here.”
“Toni,” she heard him say, it was the first time he’d spoken to her since she got back, she almost let herself respond. “Toni.” He repeated, agitated.
His response shocked her, he was simply ignoring her, despite know what he did.
Comments are not only welcome, but encouraged. Tell me what you think, what you want to happen and anything that crosses your mind, I promise you every comment makes me update 5x times faster!
The doctors smiled comfortingly, placing a hand on her shoulder, “We'll take a day or two, decide but try to do it quickly.” She turned to leave the room so Toni could get dressed, but Toni said, “What do you think I should do?”
“You only think so cause you’re losing.”
“Yes.” Toni said, “In Russian, they called him the soldier.”
“Things will be changing ladies. The program will be moved up for you.” No one dares ask why, but Madame answers anyways, “Mother Russia is in need of strong women to protect her. Eliminations will not be early, but combat will start tomorrow, no more sparring. Espionage will start in six months.”
The return home is quiet and no one acknowledges Lucie Steele, but they traded emails and Lucie’s parents are mad. Apparently Howard Stark called them and told them their daughter turned his daughter into a dyke.
The virus is planted seamlessly, and if Sasha wasn’t the devil incarnate, Toni might even feel bad.
“What is she talking about Steve?” Natasha said, from her desk. Toni barely noticed the others were still there, she didn’t think of the consequences of her words, she just wanted to cut him.
The next award show she went to was much smoother, she was seven now, and the stylist had approved outfits beforehand, Ann preferred red specifically, and that's what she wore. She kept her bearing this time and snuck away from Maria towards the reporters, “Ann! Ann! Can we talk to you for a second?”
I've been trying to get in touch with user EQfan74, if you know them or have can contact them, please send them my way.
“He killed my parents.”
A woman. A flaming woman.
“Maybe I wouldn’t if I had a few answers.” She replies
“No freaking way! I bet you can’t wait to share a bathroom with those prissy bitches.”
-Koila Nailatikau was the first daughter of Fiji and later became the first wife, she was kidnapped during a coup against her dad but survived.
She already knew three languages, Spanish, Russian, and of course English. Most of them were Russian or were at least Slavic. She knew there were rumors about her, how she was ashamed her heritage so she pretended to be an American. They acted as if her being American, or posing as an American, meant she thought she was better than them.
We don't deserve Lucie
“So you left? You faked your death?” Natasha said,
“Unfortunately, rebellion isn’t a good thing for a spy, otherwise I’d praise you for having a backbone.” She looks back to Katya, “A rare trait in a school like this.”
His train of thought is cut off by Maria Hill walking in, “He’s gone. We’re taking him in.”
Date: January 8th, 2004
Time: 1900
It lands feet in front of her and the pilot waves her on board. Silently they take off again, towards the city.
Toni nodded numbly. Maybe her blood would boil while she did it, maybe she wouldn’t have the strength to care for her wounded pride.
“I don’t know what you think you’re doing, but it’s not helping.” Katya says suddenly,
Madame is quiet a moment, before she turns to the Instructor and the guards, “Take Orlov.”
“That is the worst line I’ve ever heard.” Toni chuckles, “Please tell me it’s never worked.”
Date: September 10th, 2001
Felix. Alya. Ilya. Julie. Even more.
She breathed in hard but the air in her throat hurt and she choked. Pins and needles seemed be poking her in the face, and bile rised in her gut. She fell out of bed and dashed to the cabinet filled with vodka, and martini glasses, numbing the pain didn’t work last time but second times the charm.
She cycled through them in four weeks, week one she starts with Spanish or French, then English, then Mandarin or Korean, once and a while Japanese, and finish it off with Czech or Hungarian. Her other cycles consisted of mostly the same, just shuffled. And Toni memorized it, by heart.
“What the fuck is wrong?”
It wasn’t till a pool or blood circled her skill that she got up and returned to the line. They all stood at attention, waiting for their next order. The Instructor, Kevac, simply ordered the next two girls to begin their spar.
It burned her to talk about Nika like that, but she could risk someone else dying so Toni could spread her sob story. Every single candidate had a tale to tell about the events that led them there, some much worse than hers.
“Yeah. It’s for you. The grip twists with you, and pulls a little so it doesn’t whack your hand so much.”
“I see you decided to take a shower this morning, Sobol?” The Instructor in charge said, Toni nodded, avoiding eye contact with Eva.
“Maybe.” Toni replies a little smile playing on her lips, “You think I’m that good at ballet?”
Katya groaned quietly, before her head finally fell to her chest, a few more drops of blood slide down her neck and torso, but her body was still.
She walked down the streets for a few miles before she could hail a cab. It was a miracle that the mansion hosting the party was completely secluded from the city, or she would have been stranded.
“So you’d follow me. And so I could set us both up to be taken for execution, I knew the guards would want to take a pit stop on the way with you, so I need us to go at once.”
“Well, why don’t you go play with your dumb robots.”
“Why?”
“While you’ve already built up a reputation.” She stepped out from behind her desk, and stood directly to the side of Toni, she craned her neck up at her.
Time: 0200
He let go of her arms suddenly, maybe he was done, being so drunk it’d probably tired him out. Then he put his hands on her shoulders and pushed her to her knees.
“And I am the hero type?” Natasha says
But Toni doesn’t so much as glance at the furniture before Manya leads her to the middle of the room, they pause a moment, looking into each other's eyes, before Toni closes the gap.
The match’s that day were quick and painless, no one was on edge this week. Tania quickly took Mila down in record time, but both girls good naturedly got up and walked back to the line together.
“Stand up.” Toni said, hoping her voice wasn’t wavering too much,
Katya’s face falls, and Toni says, “Give her some more time. I’ll train her.”
“I was gonna wait until Steele shows up, then I can get a good look at her and I’ll have a good excuse to be in the hallways.”
“Listen you low rent whore, just because your life is shitty doesn’t mean you get to make everyone else’s life shitty. Go take your daddy issues back to the trailer park because we’re tired of hearing you bitch and moan about your ‘struggle’ next time your attempt assault, I’ll call the dean and we’ll see exactly how far your scholarship gets you in juvie.”
To be fair Toni knew Barnes was alive and a brainwashed assassin. Steve told her he was alive and a brainwashed assassin. She however wasn’t informed he killed her parents. She honestly didn’t hate him, she barely liked her parents. But after Steve rode the guilt trip of not telling him about her secret child and father of said secret child for almost a week, she was pissed.
“Even you couldn’t be so cruel.” Eva sniped back, barely turning her head to look at Toni, “She’s dying, we need to get her help.”
“She will be eliminated then. How else to punish her for lying about you, than killing her?”
Antoinette gulped, “I was expelled.”
“He gives consent to any surgery to save her life. We need to more quickly.”
“Howard was drunk, and Maria never learned so he took the wheel.”
But the day was still good, she’d planned on taking her new laptop down the the library and emailing Sasha and Rhodey before starting her research project. Maybe even stopping by the cafeteria for a snack before retiring for the evening. It was only December but Toni felt very ready to leave this school at the end of eighth grade.
When Tania cornered her, she faked left and tried to run, but Tania snagged her wrist, pulling at the bruises circling it and whipping her down to the floor.
She moved into the Avengers Tower shorly afterwars because there weren’t any other SI offices nearby or in cities she’d care to live in.
She couldn’t think like that. He was all she had. He was her new mission, her motivator. If he was employed by Hydra, maybe she’d have access to her parents killer. The man who ended her life as she knew it.
Yeah I did change the post date to cash in on views from the new black widow movie, what about it?? You have something to say? Keep it to your self. I deserve this, this is self care.
“You leave your entourage in there?” Brynn said,
Her arms go quicker than her core, so she takes off her shoes, and ties up her hair and starts jumping jacks. Her legs ache, and her stomach shoots pain, but she goes till she’s done a hundred.
Some girls saw Antoinette coming, and tapped their friends or rolled their eyes, when she asked, “Can I play?”
“Huh?” he murmured, and Fury opened his fist to reveal a small flash drive, “Trust no one,” he said in a rash voice, his breath was getting more uneven by the second.
She looks over the rest of the file, word by word she figures out what they’ve done to her, and what they’ve taken. Brainwashing, mind erasure. By the end of the page she’s seething, but capable of wiping the tears from her face and walking out the door.
“Toni.” Steve says,
With one swift movement, Madame pushes a large metal cap over Toni’s head, and flips a small switch near the control board. She can’t see anything for a moment, it’s all white.
“Not on my watch,” Rhodey said, helping her through the door of her apartment, she realized she’d been speaking out loud and hoped she hadn’t said too much.
“Yes.” Zma nodded, “It’s easy to knock big things off balance, and even easier to tire them out. That’s why you are all being instructed in the art of ballet. Elegance and grace are just as important as brute strength.”
“I know you’ve lost a lot. I can see that now.” He said, “But you’ve still got stuff left. The team, Iron Maiden, me.”
“An Instructor brought you?”
“I have coffee and stuff if you want-”
Thankfully, Eva gives up shortly, probably to regroup and try again in an hour.
I've been trying to get in touch with user EQfan74, if you know them or have can contact them, please send them my way.
The room is cramped, but there's enough room for her to change, and sit to reread the brief. It mentions no motive for the mission, only location and target. She pauses momentarily at the top of the page.
“Nearly, you can take off the mask if you want, we have to get out of here soon anyway,” Natasha says, not looking up from the computer
Toni sends a look at Tania before breaking away towards the woods.
She paid them no attention, but her face said it all.
“She’s dying!” Eva shouted, “We have to get her help!”
“You’ve been CEO for a while anyways. Might as well take the title and paycheck.”
“Ok, now you’re making up random alcohol side effects.”
“You know if you keep paying her, I could get her arrested for prostitution!”
As Pierce turns to his security guard, Natasha and Toni make eye contact. “Now.”
“He’s not even brain damaged?” Toni asks after a minute.
“French? French kiss?”
“Now what?”
Toni wakes up with a shudder, it’s way too cold in the room. Too white and too cold. She tried to sit up, but her stomach burned. Her face shattered as she laid her hand on her stomach through the thin hospital gown.
“That’s why you don’t go there?”
“I left a change of clothes in my bag, I’m going to get it. You better not move him before I get back.”
“Yeah Antoinette. The high school program there will be perfect.”
“I thought you were a kid? Are there people still looking for you?” Steve says,
Rhodey didn’t press.
She never used her real name. Her real fake name. She never used her real name either, for that matter.
Then there were the tabloids. After twenty years of no Starks to follow around, they were more than eager to say she was a drunk, or an addict, or a party girl. Or maybe she was cheating on Steve, with some supermodel or Olympic athlete.
“Why am I here?” Antonia asks, “What is this place?”
“Antonia Sobol and Petra Repov. Please begin your match.” Madame walked in quietly, no one noticed her observing in the back corner.
She turned away from Lara, and scanned the group before her eyes set on Toni. “Sobol? Come.”
His heart pounds straight to his head but he hardly feels it, all he can think about is running as fast as he can after the shooter. Every time he gets the guy in his sights he seems to disappear.
Ironically, Sasha wouldn’t have gotten revenge if Toni hadn’t gotten revenge, and Toni could later appreciate the humor in the situation, but it took a few years.
The automated beep the little robot makes, startles Toni, and when his hand thing moves up and down Toni wants to cry.
“I’m trying to figure out where Pierce is meeting with the rest of the committee and how to get inside. SHIELD kept pretty good records but this place is ancient.”
Nika pauses, “It’s ok. Maybe she is a goat.”
Coulson gulps, “It’s nineteen forties themed.”
He ignored her, stepping closer to Toni, “What do you mean? You said-you said they didn’t-”
“I’m not exactly the hero type. Don’t play well with others.” Toni says
His metal hand shoots towards it catching it with ease, but Steve can only see the face that’s now staring him down.
Going through a bit of writers block at the moment, and schools been HEcKing rOugh so if y'all could give me a bit of encouragement, it'll going a long long way! Thanks!
Toni only smiled, and tried to focus on Tania’s weaknesses. Strong legs, weak arms, too arrogant, easily riled. She repeated the mantra, and hoped Tania wasn’t doing the same for her.
“Which one?”
“Umm, yes, I can.”
_	_	_	_	_
She took the hand tentatively and let the woman help her up.
After hours of stretching, and laps, the Instructor called them into line. The eight of them stood still, the back of their hands lay on the small of their backs.
Suddenly he leaned over and picked up the beer bottle half spilled on his bed. Toni wanted to scream, but she calmed her nerves, maybe he’d throw it on the ground like he did the other cans. Instead, he stared at the stained white sheets, now a murky brown. He discarded the bottle on the ground, but turned towards the phone, right next to the bathroom and Toni.
Madame didn’t even look sorry when she quietly said, “Eliminate her.”
And that pill was the easiest one the swallow yet.
The lady reporter she talked to asked pretty demure questions, and she probably figured it’d been a cutesy but boring interview when she asked, “Do you have any comments for people watching at home?”
“Should we lock them up?” Koila asked, as the last cuff on Toni’s foot fell, Toni shook her head, and without warning, shot two bullets into each guard’s head.
She was chosen last in sparring and fights due to that fact and many others, one of which being her unpopularity with the commander of her class, Tania.
“Did I put a gun to her head?”
“No.” Toni sighed, she set the wet shirt on a nearby rock, and tucked the pistol back into her pants.
Sometimes Tania’s victims would trash talk her. Usually loudly so Tania would hear.
“So you’re going to track down your family?”
I've been trying to get in touch with user EQfan74, if you know them or have can contact them, please send them my way.
“And if we’re both lucky, we’ll never see each other again.” Madame continues, “I have your files, they’ll be sent with you. Now let me tell you about your new job.”
“Ms. Orlov, if you ever plan to go on a successful mission, I suggest you at least attempt to mask your atrocious accent.” She replied
They place a mask over her nose and now she can’t see or feel anything again.
“I don’t care about your fairy tales Pierce, now shut up or I’ll put one in your leg.”
Time: 0800
(See the end of the chapter for
“I know.” Toni pauses, “And I’m not going to kill you. I’m putting you somewhere, where you’ll never see the light of day again.”
But what really stung was Obie.
“How exactly am I supposed to kill his handlers?” Toni snipes
Everyday when school let out for break, she walked over to the girls in a large group playing some combination or tag and fairies or horses. They turn her away politely, maybe because they didn’t want to hurt her feelings, maybe because they didn’t want to attract attention.
“She grabbed me by the elbow.” Toni said, Madame paused, waiting for an elaboration but Toni offered none.
Bruce dropped her off at her room and confirmed their plans to work in the lab tomorrow, “At noon ok? And don’t drop by my room to find me, I sleep in the nude. I’ll find you.”
“About Lara?” Toni says
“Promises promises.” Toni sang, stepping around the older girl in a circle, “Doing a lot of talking for someone who wants to fight.”
“Who are you!” She cries louder,
“Really? I mean, of course.”
She sat through twenty minutes of the examining celebrities dresses, before they came to Jodie Foster, apparently accompanied by Howard Stark.
She didn’t have to think too hard to see the man in blacks face. He still came to her in nightmares and the dark.
She sat down on the bed and like Francesa had left all over agian, she cried. It was her fault everyone left. She called Francesa a slut, she never appreciated Jarvis, she’d given her baby away, she’d gotten Lucie kicked out. Soon enough Rhodey would leave too, probably sooner if she kept crying like this.
Toni stares at the thin layer of dust coating her hands in disbelief. It blows away in the wind after a moment, so she starts digging into the small pile of dust clumped on the ground. It wasn’t long till she cracked her nails, and the tips of her fingers started to bleed. She could feel the presence of another behind her, watching. She ignored them.
“Everyone likes their parents more than I liked mine.”
He thanks her, even lingers for a moment watching something, probabaly behind her, before leaving.
“I can’t just sit here while you die.”
Madame finally stopped outside a small classroom, she’d only been in there a few times for measurements. They were fitted with new uniforms every two years. She’d assumed that was the only purpose of the room.
When she gets to the end of the strands she grasps it suddenly and pulls Eva’s whole head downwards, “No one in this room has any authority to tell me how to run my program.” She smirks as Eva as she stands up straight again, “Especially the fool who lost the only advantage she ever had.”
Natasha tenses and starts to dive behind one of the cars they hit in the crash that had been abandoned, Sam starts gets the falcon suit ready, and Steve prepares to charge him and draw his fire. All three are cut off when the woman leaps from the ground to the soldier.
In her shock she doesn’t even notice the next few texts, alerting her Coulson has received all the recovered items, and people, and is sending them to the proper places for restoration and rehabilitation. Basically that SHIELD is taking over her operation.
Toni scoffs, emotional trauma can sometimes be worse. “So is the cello player still in the picture?”
“I just don’t think it’s fair for you to take them all,” She leaned in and whispered dramatically, but her entourage of younger girls, and the candidates that crowded around her could certainly hear, “Especially with you being so unhinged.”
“Oh, it was. You were always expected to be the champion of your class. Even when you arrived I knew I could make you into the next great asset.” She smiled, almost warmly if you didn’t look at her eyes, “And you were so little when you came. So naive and kind. Like an angel, you didn’t want to hurt anyone.”
Steve sighed, “I’m sorry.”
“You’ve been identified as a gifted young lady, and this is a school to hone your skills so you may serve.”
“Well no, Howard, and his wife Maria passed away in two thousand five, when she was eighteen. She inherited it when she was twenty one. She’s actually the one who found you, she kept Howard’s project alive, to find you. She’s actually her today, we could probably find her for you.”
It was only a few minutes till the Instructors appeared at the door, she suspected a camera was hidden somewhere, but maybe they’d heard gunshots.
Katya took two or three before she started to try and block, but she couldn’t land any hits. It wasn’t long till she fell to the ground. Toni couldn’t let her up again, she’d be punished, so she leaned over Katya and held her down against the mat.
Toni nodded, and took the woman’s extended hand, “The injection was a low grade anesthetic, he’ll wake up thinking it was a dream.”
She shrugs, “It all evens out.”
Target: Antonia Sobol
Right next door was her daughter. Her only family. So she waits outside the room where she got blood drawn, till the doctor leaves. She almost doesn’t go in but is drawn to the door.
So she went downstairs to the useless, carless robot that reminded her a lot of someone she knew, and she names it Dum-E after Howard.
The teacher soon joined them, and asked what was going on, and Antoinette didn’t argue when they said she’d stolen their ball and punched Holly in the nose unprovoked, because with a crowd of fake witnesses she didn’t stand a chance. The teacher was surprised to say the least, she’s always known Antoinette was anti-social but never violent. She had someone help Holly to the nurse and took Antoinette to the principal's office, where she was quickly expelled.
The underground tunnel isn’t exactly unexpected. Natasha seems to know about it, Sam takes it in stride and Amanda… well, she seems more annoyed than impressed with SHIELD facilities.
“Um. I don’t know probably not.”
“Of course!” Nika says, “You’re the best in class. Tania talks a big game, but she’s jealous. You should’ve heard her the night you started Pointe.”
“I tried to follow you. Tania’s not letting me sit down in the mess hall, so I figure I’d hang with you, but you weren’t in the library, and I saw you go down one of these hallways once, but then I got lost.”
“But I can sure as hell try.” She said, and she spun on her heel, dropping the tray in the trash. But Eva lurched towards her, and dragged her back by her elbow.
“Pep.” She started, “I’m all alone now. Not really, but you know what I mean.”
“Tones. You can tell me anything.” He slides down to the floor next to her.
“Hi Maia.” Toni walks closer,
“Ivana Yanev died unexpectedly early,” the cruel undertones didn’t escape Toni, unexpectedly early. The girl was not favored to be the final asset. “But thankfully Antonia Sobol was recovered shortly afterwards.”
When it all came to a head, she knew what she’d done, she regretted nothing.
“Oh Lucie! I miss you so so much! I wish they’d sent me home instead, so I didn’t have to deal with the ever present eyes on me, but then you’d still be here suffering and I couldn’t take that either!”
“She’s not my daughter. OK? Not really, I just gave birth to her a decade ago and haven’t had any contact up until an hour ago.”
“Neutralize as in rescue.” Natasha says, “I honestly don’t think he’s capable of killing him, even if it’s for his own life.”
Not that she lived at the tower, she lives with Pepper in a aparment a block away. She used to anyways. Until Pepper told her she couldn’t handle her girlfriend being in constant danger. She said she was leaving, but not leaving Toni. Basically we can still be friends, but in different words.
It was another week before she finally talked to Steve, or at least left something for him to find besides her cold dead body.
Most strikes landed squarely on her cheek, sometimes she hit her nose, other times she outright missed and punched her neck. It was only a few minutes till Svetlana stopped crying out, a few more till she stopped moving.
“He doesn’t know she exists so it doesn’t really matter.”
Partially because the last age group was only six, and partially because of her high intelligence.
“Oh my god, you’re pregnant with Ronnie Richard’s baby.”
The operating room is cold and clean, she’s ignored for the most part, the nurses are busy and the doctors are washing their hands. She wants to run, and scream and yell at all of them, because if she loses this baby, she loses herself.
But she’d be cold that night.
The time they spent waiting around for Thanos to show was insane, then Quill couldn’t block his feelings for thirty fucking seconds, and got all of them dusted. Or most of them dusted. She and blue chick survived. Parker didn’t which was her fault, she dragged him into this. Into all this shit. His ashes were still staining her hands, as the alien helped her onto her aircraft.
“That’s not fair.” Rhodey starters,
She couldn’t hold back anything though. Not if she wanted to get out. Showing the Instructors she cared, meant showing them that she was unnecessary.
“No,” She manages to raspily say, “Save my baby.” Her vocal cords burn, she can’t cough, her mouth is so weak. They must have already started the anesthesia.
She often had only one person for company in the library late at night, Sasha, her old friend who made it her life purpose to be a bitch to Toni two years ago when they both started sixth grade.
But her best friend in the world was dead and hadn’t thought to tell Toni she’d been dying since the day they met.
“I want to be alone. You can take the vodka if you want, and any other drink you find. I know theres some in the fridge.”
She bypassed the rest of security, Coulson must be pretty high ranking she figured, and was led to a dark room with whole screen wall projecting a feed of Captain Rogers. Some doctors were operating on him, operating being an exaggeration because they were mostly doing a mild checkover of him and treating his minor hypothermia.
“You must’ve suffered a head injury in your escape. Don’t fret darling, the Red Room will help you grow so you’ll never hurt again.”
“I’m still not convinced you can withdraw from alcohol.”
“I’d known her for years, just like I’ve known all of you for years. But she was the first one to talk to me like a person.”
Also this chapter title made more sense pre edit
“If things weren’t like this. No Red Room, no trials. If I met you on that corner instead of the Instructor, would we have been friends?”
It takes weeks before the bug starts to show, just like planned. Sasha blames Toni, of course because she’s not stupid, but Toni didn’t plan for her revenge.
Tania scoffs, and leans back, as if that’s so unlikely, but Toni hid behind a table with Eva on the other side, ready to shoot, she had no doubt if given the chance, Eva wouldn’t hesitate.
Another groan and Toni wants to run to her, but Eva could be watching, waiting for an easier shot.
Toni blinked, they weren’t supposed to talk about life before the Red Room. Maybe she was just forcing out a detailed response, because she knew Toni’s Russian accent was no good. Perhaps she wanted to expose that she wasn’t Russian at all, and isolate her even more.
“They moved up the execution.” Toni said shortly, taking a seat in front of the woman.
Two years after she found out everything she could about her daughter, and Toni was busy. Good busy.
Maia lived in California.
“She could die!” Sam yells back, and the guard flinches, “I said be-”
“That can’t be true.”
“She’s a risk, Nat.” He says, thinking Toni out of earshot
Asset: Asset Name/ID Confirmed
Toni whirled around, flashing a toothy, probably bloody smile, she said, “Figures you’d need to run away to land a hit.”
Like an epilogue but the rest of the MCU w this 'verse's Toni.
Toni looks back to the papers, “No.”
“We can kill anyone.”
She realizes that the fire had blown all night, towards her. She was covered in a thick layer of soot from her torso to her neck.
“Never been better.” Tania says shortly, “I guess the underwear model plan is a bust after all.”
“Oh, sorry,” Toni said lightly, bending down to gather the things her roommate dropped.
When asked about Nika’s disappearance, Toni just said she’d been eliminated for spreading lies.
“And who is that exactly?” Nick says,
“Hello? My mom told me to call this number in case of emergency, and both my parents just...crumbled to dust. I need help. This is an emergency. Oh this is Maia Peterson, whoever this is can you please come quick. I’m scared.”
I did this instead of my project, so I hope you enjoy while my grades suffer
“Find me her next of kin.” He said, and once again she heard a door open and close, this time she could see a spot of light near the sound. Her vision was coming back.
“Because you’re so innocent!”
“Captain Rogers, you’re late.”
“A whole state? One person? Is it some ex?”
She looked towards the bed as if she hadn’t been watching him, “I’ll go get you new ones.” She stepped out of the bathroom and towards the door, but he caught the crook of her elbow, it took every bit of willpower not to flip him over her back and pin him to the ground.
Toni looked up at him, “That was her name. It was between Alex, Riley, and Charlie. Alex Stark sounded better so...”
She sits with Tania at lunch. Not next to her, of course, but there’s only so many tables, so each untouchable can’t have their own.
Her eyebrows broke into a furrow, “Rhodey, I gotta tell you something.” His nod prompted her, “I’m not all out of family.”
Maybe she’d see Tania or Nika. Would they be mad?
“It wasn’t a booty call if that’s what your asking.” Toni said suddenly, pulling away from him, “I’m not 19 anymore.”
An intimidating man, Toni identified as Mr. Volkov, told Toni she must be punished for being unnatural, and corrupting his daughter.
She was already waking up late, and so changing her clothes made her unmistakably late for roll call, her tight braids were still damp.
The girl, Eva Shvets, wouldn’t have to wait much longer. In mere minutes, she’d kick the right box out of the way and see a stray hand or leg, and promptly fill Toni’s body with bullets.
“At least pretend you have a sliver of self respect Francesca.” Antoinette turned to see her mother standing in a doorway nearby, she looked mad, maybe at Antoinette for being expelled.
-Just checked and I'm like 130 words from being at 30,000 words total like jeez i wrote all those words all by myself my man thats a lot of words
“Is that even legal?” He replied,
“What do you mean?” Toni said,
She opened her eyes and felt awake for the first time. Torn between being exhausted by the crash and exhilarated by adrenaline she clumsily clawed at her seat buckle, while calling, “Mom? Mommy?”
Katya crawls back, “No! Please no!” She cries as the guards unceremoniously take both her arms, and dragged her towards the door.
“Yeah.”
“And the name, I had the honor of choosing myself.” Madame continued, “An asset’s code name is to reflect the nature of their work and their personality, Black Widow, of course, is beautiful and deadly, silently and toxic.”
Madame smiled quietly, “It’s a curious thing. Light pressure to the wound would allow time for the blood to clot.”
The wagon took a sharp turn, nearly pushing Toni off her bench, suddenly it went at such an incline, Toni snapped her head to see what was up the hill.
Steve forgives her. Forgive her. His words of course. She doesn’t know exactly what for, probably her attitude or behavior or lack of hustle. Oops not that last one, she was just listing off elementary school soccer coach voacab and that one accidetnyaly got thrown it. She smiled brightly, when he told her, “I forgive you too.” She lied.
Steve turns to Nat, on the ground. He’d completely forgotten, trusting her to be alright.
It doesn’t hurt at first. She feels a slight buzz at the top of her head, on the tips of her ears and fingers. Then the buzzing turns to a burning and a pounding. She screams in anguish and looks up to see one woman standing in front of her smiling.
The office Madame spends her days in is smaller than she remembers. And she can remember so vividly now. Everything.
“Don’t have to worry about that much more.” Toni muses quietly
“It’s a fair question!” He called after her down the hallway, “The timeline barely adds up, and your not exactly known for being faithful, so excuse me for making sure-”
That day she went home, Jarvis was cleaning, Maria was in Turks and Caicos on a post awards season vacation and Father was in the basement working. So Annie turned on the TV and went to one of the channels that spent a week after the awards shows talking about what happened. They usually bored her, but she need to be prepared if anyone brought it up again.
Toni just grinned, “Yeah, maybe.” Bruce went off down the hallway, and Toni counted his steps till she couldn’t hear them anymore.
He ramblemed for a few seconds, not managing to say anything to her before she raced out the door.
It came back in bits and pieces over the years. She strained her head trying to remember her mother’s face or the smell of her father’s cologne. They were never great parents, but they were parents.
“That’s what they all think.” Toni wants to probe what she means but she’s out the door and soon out of the apartment too quick.
“No not Lara. That girl was so sweet, it’s a shame.”
Once again silence ate at her for a few seconds, she worried she’d been talking in her head.
Target: Antonia Sobol
“Oh good, I was hoping you’d say that.” She pressed a small button on the corner of the desk, and two men entered the room behind her.
She stormed out of the room knocking over one of Lucette’s suitcases. Lucette just stared at her in confusion, “What’s her deal?”
“Am I not? I thought I was dreaming when you walked in.”
Fury being alive is however unexpected. Natasha is happier than she lets on, even with the morphine for her bullet wound, she doesn’t get emotional.
“No,” Toni says, passing her through the door frame,
911. She kept repeating the number in her head, but she was tempted to call Pepper or Rhodey or… Steve. He should know about this. But she settled on 911, hoping they’d find her before any living terrorist’s finished her off.
“No.” He said, “They’re all upstairs, I’m the front door greeter.”
“I’m not a prisoner,” The girl said, “I’ve been kidnapped, I’m a kidnappee. Prisoners deserve their sentence, they commit crimes.”
“I’ll get out of here. Any hole you throw me into, I’ll claw my way out, I’ll pull myself out.”
“He was driving them home that night.”
“You can’t control everyone.” He says, “You can’t micromanage life.”
“How was it? Did you meet anyone famous?” Another girl, Tamara maybe, said
Asset: Winter Soldier
They got their own apartment only a few weeks ago and it was still unfamiliar, but more private than the tower.
“Who are you?” She says, backing up,
Madame was quiet, “I see.”
Annie probably could have stayed at the school if Maria wasn’t in Turks and Caicos and could be reached, if Father cared at all, or if Annie agreed to apologize, but she was, he didn’t, and she wouldn’t. So she changed schools within the month tried to forget about Evelyn.
Toni would have stayed with Peter if she didn’t think the alien would forcibly take her. So she trudged miserably behind her till they arrived at the ship and boarded in silence.
“So I do know you from somewhere, we have met.”
“Well none of that.”
“Good morning, candidates.” She said, smiling widely at the terrided line of faces. Twelve girls stand at attention. Toni was third to last in line, and certainly going to get a question. The other girls hadn’t figured Kozlov out, they didn’t know her routine.
“So you’re married?” Toni says, stepping a bit closer
“It doesn’t matter.”
The drama is real in this one, maybe little long thou
Her desk was characteristic disheveled and despite being often tempted, Toni didn’t move any of her stuff onto Willa’s desk or bed. She didn’t need to give Sasha anymore fuel, to call her out on being selfish or kicking Willa out of their room, Toni could picture it now, “Lonely Loser”, taunting her in the hallways, it was better than the other L word, lesbian.
Madame steps back, “I’ve still got it, I can take you.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“I’ve beaten you a hundred times, I’ve been undefeated for years.”
The boys didn’t see her coming, they were busy already throwing the ball back and forth, making fake slam dunks despite the fact their feet never left the ground.
The rest of the Avengers live in the tower, which used to named after her because she designed, funded and physcially built it but since four other people hauled ass for two hours now it’s everyones. Sharing is caring, but Toni couldn’t care less so she doesn’t know why she’s sharing.
He blinked, “She never talked about you. I didn’t know.”
She develops a headache only moments after she steps inside the Red Room mansion. She’s alone, it being late at night, but the familiar hallways and doors make her sick already.
“She’s dead. She hasn’t moved, and I’m guessing she doesn’t have a pulse.”
He’d retreived the newspaper early that morning, he always woke up early, and smack dab on the front page was her fathers face, and above it read, “Starks Die In Tragic Car Accident”
They say she took it too seriously, she couldn’t take a joke. She was too small and weak, so she’d be asked to leave any day now. Eliminations didn’t start until year fourteen, but despite being nine, she was placed three years ahead of her age.
Just as she was about to storm into the room, Natasha peered out of the doorframe looking annoyed.
They fall to the bed, unceremoniously losing clothes as they roll on it.
“You trust her?” He says finally,
Eva looked away, unanswering and Toni knew the girl was gone. “So walk.”
But bringing up theories on how and why she’d killed Katya and sometimes even Nika were the best ways.
Steve nodded, and for a moment it was silence. Awkward silence. “Hey, uh if you want-if you want, you’re welcome to use my machine.” He gestured to the small basket of laundry she held. “Might be cheaper than the one in the basement.”
The first few missions were child’s play compared to what she’d done for the Red Room. A hostage rescue, and recovery of items. All just half an hour from her flat.
“Loyalty is freedom, work is peace.”
She didn’t have much time to inspect the interior design though.
Also this is kinda sad, see end notes for why :( I'm also pissed my mom won't let me have my friend over even though there's gonna be a heat emergency over the weekend and we're literally doing nothing. But it's fine obvi, just more bullshit to whine to my therapist about.
“Tell me.” Tania says,
“Yes, you idiot what did you think I meant?”
The kind robotic voice replied, “All the Avengers are on their floors, with the exception of Captain Rogers who’s down the hall. Should I give him the go ahead?”
If they even bothered to investigate, they’d find guilt-ridden Manya, and a dead body fitting Toni’s description.
They only made eye contact for a second, but Katya’s eyes were wild and afraid. She would die, one way or the other. She might’ve been confused as to why Toni didn’t do it then and there, and maybe she should have, but she couldn’t bring herself to end this poor girl’s life in a dingy basement, on a wrestling mat, in front of six teenage girls.
The ride home was smooth and relaxing, Danvers was a good driver.
Toni scrunched her eyes brows, she considered turning away, but that would only show how much his words hurt, how deep they cut. “I didn’t choose not to go to Sokovia because of you and our shitty relationship.”
“Have you ever kissed a girl?”
“Yes. How is Ms. Potts by the way?”
“Thor'll be back by now, you don’t need me.” She said
The remaining five candidates watch in silence, and Madame must have slipped out while Petra was still fighting back. Toni silently returned to the line, her cheeks wet with tears, and her hands heavy.
“Stop it!” Toni cries out, striding towards them, “Leave her alone!”
She slipped a pistol, and the keys from their belts, and tossed the key to Koila, who despite her shock, was able to begin unlocking herself without direction.
They slept together two months in. Toni showered three times, but could still feel his hands, and his mouth. She felt dirty and used, and she didn’t expect him to call but he did. That’s when she began her mission.
“She was being fired, for sleeping with Father, on her way out she begged me to tell my parents I loved her and not Maria, and that I wanted her for a mother insead. So I said, ‘I don’t want a slut for a mother.’”
“I’m not having-”
“It wasn’t an easy job. Lots of problems came up. Like when bratty little girls insisted on coming on a business trip with her parents. We originally just added you to the hit list, when I had a bright idea. My good friend ran a school for bratty little girls with no parents.”
“Why would she do that?” Toni said,
“I’m glad we were friends, even if it took us a while to figure it out.”
-June 4th this is a funny and terribly sad reference. In 2018 twitter dubbed June 4th national amnesia day, after a joke on the Simpsons that ‘nothing happened in Tiananmen Square’ which is a call back to the Tiananmen Square protests in China in 1989. The protests were enormous, but the protesters were shot at and mowed down by tanks, by order of the Chinese government, who didn’t want to give the people political freedom. While this isn’t a direct tie to what the chapter is about, amnesia or the recovery from it, it’s important to remember and be thankful for the freedoms we have. Toni actually grew up in a similar climate, with no freedom or free speech, and communist Russia was also a very hard place to live, so I guess it ties together better than I’d thought.
Tania laughed, “We’d last two days in an apartment together,” she’s joking, but her breath hitches on every word and Toni know she close,
“Toni. You’re not deformed.”
He turns back to Sam and Nat, who’ve gotten to their feet.
“You can’t be serious.”
“I don’t believe you.”
They began and Toni quickly took advantage of Petra’s lack of technique. She had no balance or grace, but she knew the skills and moves. Toni had to knock her off her feet before she could attack.
“Can I try to make a shot?” she said just as quietly, she had nothing to lose.
“We’ve researched it plenty Ms. Stark. You can watch the feed of him waking up, and then one of our agents debriefing him and then, and only then will you get to talk to him. But you’re going to have to leave after.”
She had to promise Steve the next time she found out she was dying she’d let him know. She could tell he was really mad deep down, but he wouldn’t admit it. They got married in a courthouse with Happy and Pepper and didn’t tell anyone.
_	_	_	_	_
Annie didn’t cry often, but that afternoon she cried for a long time before Jarvis found her sitting in front of the TV, the program had long since ended and it was now a random reality show but Annie just sat in front of it sobbing.
She didn’t shop often, only when an item is worn out or was ruined. But she wondered about it a lot. Her parents never had problems with money, but that was because her father worked all the time. Was she indirectly being paid, or was there so much money on the card it wouldn’t have to be filled for years.
“What an interesting turn of events.” She says simply, “I have to say I didn’t see it coming.”
She looks up despite herself, and Eva grins, “We were thinking, maybe you should tell Madame you don’t want anymore missions.”
Ignoring her, Toni continues, “I mean if I was named Judyta, I’d change it too. But how did you land on ‘Madame’? Was it given to you, or did you pick it out yourself?”
It’s been a while since she’s actually seen the woman, and it shows on her face. New wrinkles run through her chin and forehead, and her neck started to sag.
“I was angry. I lashed out.” Tania murmured
“That can’t feel...good?” Toni said uncertainty
She looks to the remaining eleven girls, before her eyes settle on Lara Vasilla. “Vasilla. Come here.”
Irresponsibility, danger, selfishness. A true patriot of Mother Russia would never.
“What do you mean?” Steve asks, sitting up in bed,
The girls bully Toni out of fear, because they think she’ll get them eliminated, they all kinda bully each other because they’ve lived together for so long and all the stress of potentially dying really gets to them, mind you all the other girls are 20 years old, Toni is 17 so there’s also that.
That particular evening, Howard sat on his couch while two women in impressively high heels acted out some sort of story. Their dresses covered their thighs, but were sheer, showing off an intricately laid set of lingerie that gave Toni a headache when she thought of attempting to put it on.
“You don’t go into withdrawal from alcohol. I don’t think so anyways.” Toni said, interrupted but nauseous, but continued, “Besides I haven’t had more than a glass in weeks, there no way I’d be feeling it now.”
Toni taps the counter of the bar and regrets it immediately. It probably hasn’t been washed in the last ten years, and she can feel the sticky residue on her fingertips. She ignores it, and continues, “One more for me, and another for my friend here.”
She tells him about Peggy, Aunt Peggy to Toni, who is at a home not far away but is losing a battle to alzheimer's.
“Well that explains it.” another girl sitting farther away remarked under her breath, but Annie's come a long way since punching Holly in the face, she just ignored the girl. But apparently she wasn’t trying to ignored because after other girls asked more question, she butted it, “So why’d you go anyways? You weren’t even invited.”
When Madame doesn’t respond, she continues blabbering, “She’ll be the best candidate in our class, in our whole school!”
Asset: Asset Name Confirmed, Awaiting Final Candidate
It wasn’t long till he invited her out for a drink, and she only hesitated for a second.
“Want to get out of here?”
“Yes.”
Time: 2334
She went to eight classes everyday, learning everything from astrophysics to studying literature, to learning two languages at once. The other girls were behind her, and they hated her for it. Everyone knew and spoke English, her Instructors told her it was the ‘universal language’ and next year they would work on perfecting their American, British and Australian accents.
She reached for the gun before Madame handed it to her, pointed it at Nika and pulled the trigger in one fell swoop. She couldn’t stand to hear her plead anymore, she couldn't stand to think about it one more second.
“Aunt Peggy. Visited me at MIT, came to all my dance recitals, brought me presents on Christmas. I knew her for nearly twenty years. I researched Alzheimer's for five of them. How long did you know her again?”
“You don’t have to leave yet, sweetheart.” he purred, brushing his hand down her cheek erratically, his fingers couldn’t maintain the straight path, “We could dirty them up a bit before you get clean ones.”
It’s mentioned that Lidia Yakovlev killed herself the year before because she thought she would be the next one eliminated. She was right and remarks that the girl who tried to kill her in the test deciding who would get a mission would’ve been with her on the ground and Lidia would have had a gun. Ironic.
Toni really didn’t think she was pregnant. She really didn’t. But two dozen positive pregnancy test highly suggested otherwise, and a visit to her doctors confirmed it. They placed the date of conception the week of the previous christmas.
“Or Utkyn and Sobol could settle their score. Either way we’d have a clear loser and winner. We’d have the final pair to progress to the next level of the program.”
The chapter title made more sense in the unedited version, oh well
But soon, they were done. Neither wanted anymore, and neither wanted to move. Toni usually pulled her pants on my now, but the sheets were soft and the brunette was...a person. So she stayed, not asking permission from her companion, not that he was lucid enough to give it.
Toni could barely feel the muscles in her leg, by the end of class, and she still had formal schooling to complete.
“You choose one. I can’t decided.” Toni shields her eyes dramatically, turning away from the red dresses and her disapproving mother.
“The man?” Madame said, “What man?”
“How do you know that?” Natasha says, grabbing the paper, “I looked this over ten times, it looked like an office building.”
However, after sending an agent late last year, whose mission was to seduce her, and convince her to run away with him, it was revealed Manya wasn’t interested in men at all. And so, incomes Anya.
Kozlov let it go and moved to the next girl, “What book is your literature class reading at the moment?” She asked in a perfect American accent, the girl being question blinked a moment, not for lack of understanding. They’d studied English extensively, but since Kozlov had asked in an American accent, that’s how Klara, the girl, has to reply.
“You hate people.” He mutters,
“I think you’re misplacing your anger.” Natasha says, “You know he was a puppet just like you. He didn’t have any control.”
“I can’t make you believe me.” Toni says, looking away.
“What? What will happen?”
This week, poor Nika Lupu, a tall, slender girl with lovely black hair, who excelled in history and science, spilled her lunch all over the table on Monday.
“No.” She says, quickly wiping the tears from her cheek, “That’s psycho doesn’t get to kill you.”
“What is he doing? Why is he going back to the-” She’s cut off by the unmistakable sound of a gunshot, followed by the terrified whinny of a horse, she turns to the remaining man with her,
An agent walks in with two handfuls of manilla folders, plops them down on the desk and says, “This is what you missed Captain Rogers.”
This chapter has graphic scenes that may be triggering to some, if you'd like to skip but want the plot see end chapter notes.
Toni paused a moment, “I was eight when I started here.”
But would the remaining girls end the game? Along with Eva, Klara Petrov and Mila Fedorov were in the basement, armed and ordered to kill them.
“She’s an asset. She’s highly trained, and I don’t know what I’m walking into with that meeting.” She pauses, “Without her, I wouldn’t have even known where it was.”
The cold floor did little to comfort Toni as she waited to die.
“Including HYDRA’s.” Natasha remarks
The woman next to her is silent a moment, “I’m not your friend.”
The she laughed. She laughed, with Captain America, Captain “Steve is fine” America.
It took weeks for her to notice a single change. It wasn’t as if she could suddenly lift weights with ease, or run for hours. But she could feel the tightness of her legs, and the hard bumps on her stomach, of newly forming abs.
Car accidnent? She hadn’t been told they were driving anywhere, she hadn’t talked to them since last week when they told her they disaproved of all her actions and life choices and she said they didn’t know the half of it. Her last words were “Well. Fuck you two.” Her last words.
Toni’s whole body flinches at a loud sound nearby, she thought for sure Eva had spotted her, when she realized it was coming from outside.
“Oohhh,” Jason exclaimed, “It’s not even that he went with another woman while his wife was there! It’s why was his wife there! She’s not an actress, and she brought their daughter a literal child who wore a flaming red potato sack! Like who is making these decisions?”
Only her shoulders tensed, the rest of her body remained calm. She continues to wash the shirt with one hand as the other reaches for the pistol by her knee.
The girls silently watched, as she slipped the shoes back into the black bag, she looked up at them, “Well? Get changed.”
She looked up at him, ‘This is for Captain America. Long live the revolution, let the Accords die!’ rang in her head.
“Perfection. Howie why don’t we take these skematics upstair with us for after we finish our game?”
“Which is exactly why you won’t be involved. We’re trying to capture not kill, you’re too unpredictable. The mission is-”
She’d always supported the right to choose, partially in the beginning because it infuriated Howard, but the more research she’d done, the more appalling it was women weren’t naturally afforded the right to choose. Now that the choice was up to her, she made up her mind considering both options, but she wanted this baby to live. She knew she’d have to give it up, and she’d probably never meet the person with half her genetic makeup, but she didn’t care, because she couldn’t give this child much in life, but she could give it life.
“Well, maybe you should take another look, because this is ridiculous.” He finally set the paper on the table, “It’s taking away our freedom, our rights!”
“Where is my laptop?”
“Madame will answer everything.” He says simply,
“So everything you just said was…?” She asked
But at what cost? Prolonging her death? She’d be tortured, maybe spill some information, she couldn’t decide, because she didn’t even know their organization.
No one said a word, but in the back a normally quiet girl, Lara, raises her hand.
She obliged, telling them who she was wearing, and how much fun she was having maybe exaggerating a little.
“What about your friend here?” Pierce gestures to Toni, and she tries to keep her face blank, “I assume you two didn’t meet at book club.”
“I’m donating blood.”
They talked tensely for a few moments, and Steve grew wearier, what was he hiding? And what happened to him in the first place?
“Sobol. Orlov. You will go first.” Toni swallowed hard and tried not to look at Katya Orlov, but out of her peripheral vision she could the girl standing there. Her eyes were wide, and her shoulders tensed. Toni would win this fight, and everyone here thought the loser would be eliminated.
“Can I ask you a question?” Pierce turns to another man, “What if Pakistan marched into Mumbai tomorrow? And you knew they were gonna drag your daughters into a soccer stadium. For execution. And you could just stop it, with the flick of a switch. Would you? Wouldn’t you all?”
“Then don’t.” Steve says, “Keeping things as they are isn’t hard. All you have to do is not leave, so there’s no reason to make everything more difficult.”
He slowly makes his way around the bar, and she lets him cuff her silently.
“Hmm? Oh yeah, be right there, hold up for me, mmk?” Howard said standing up and walking to the back bathroom, only lulling to the left slightly.
“The strong don’t kill the weak.” Toni says
Lucette laughed slightly, “Thanks for that. I’m sorry I...outed you.”
They reached the long corridor, and Father’s door was opened slightly, but Mother ignored this, so Antoinette did too. Mother walked into her room and went to close the door when she noticed Antoinette standing there.
“How will this teach us to fight, Instructor?” She said in a small voice. She was a tiny thing, about as big as Toni. She looked like a dancer already, with delicate features and graceful arms.
Madame walked in first, a small group of Instructors behind her.
The blue alien, Nebula, told her they’d survive for about a month before the food runs out, followed by oxygen. She grimly nodded, and a small part of her longed for the end.
As if a message was sent to all the eligible Russian bachelors, the party was filled with young men. They’d been told she was twenty-five, had been schooled alone then sent to a western university only to return to her home to secure a successor for her fortune.
She only dropped her head in defeat. She was untied, and the restraints hadn’t left much of a mark on her hands, so there was no evidence of her capture.
She’s sent to speak at the front, she’s handed a microphone, and looks out at the sea of concerned faces, quiet pity for the poor orphan. She spots Rhodey and Pepper, whom must’ve just arrived, and in the back she even sees Brynn Wayne of Wayne Enterprises.
The wagon finally pulled into the driveway of the mansion, and they got out of the back. The first man gave the driver some coins, and they stood outside a moment while he drove away.
Toni swallows hard, steeling her nerves, “They’ll be looking for me.”
The girls murmur to each other a moment before remembering themselves. Toni stands, back straight, eyes at attention. She doesn’t even blink and Madame notices, giving her a soft smile.
A murmur travels through the group, Toni hears a whisper, “Someone’s going home.”
She tried not to remember their names, but if it was mentioned in passing, it was stuck in her brain along with piercing blue eyes, and her first conversations with Madame or her last conversation with her mother, it was filed away with all the things she didn’t want to remember.
She arrived at the SHIELD HQ only hours after hearing about the discovery, they must not have known she was coming, or that she knew where is was because they only caught her entering the second security clearance, after intimidating the first entrances guard to let her in.
“I can take you.” Eva said, without a tremble
“About us.” She says shortly, she sits up and wraps the sheets around her, before leaning back on the headboard to see his reaction, when he doesn’t reply, she continues, “Us dating.”
“The mission isn’t important.” Toni barks, “Sometimes missions are wrong.”
She got there just in time to see Tania sitting on top of Klara, choking her to death, her legs gave one more pathetic jerk before her whole body stilled. Tania rose from the mat and stood next to Eva, who let one tear slip down her cheek before she quickly wiped it away.
“What do you call this then?” She beamed again, and went for a right hook that landed with a satisfy crunch, but Tania was all laughs when she recovered, “Can’t talk your way out of this one Sobol, I’m bigger and stronger, and I’ll end you.”
She didn’t know how far she could travel. A vacation certainly wasn’t an option.
It only took a second for them to lock eyes. Toni did her best to look unbothered at being noticed, but was unsure of how convincing she was.
The soldier glowers back wordlessly
“I met her, she was really nice, she and Father went somewhere after but I had to go home and Maria- I mean my mom had a migraine.”
Kozlov nods, and takes off down the narrow hallway, towards the classrooms and away from the sleeping area.
-June 26th national torture victims day chapter 4
“They should. Sometimes I hope they do. But I’ve been given a unique opportunity. I’ve been trained to do this all my life.”
“I didn’t go because I’m pregnant.”
“I don’t think she did, I think she was scared. Terrified.”
“If I remember correctly, you were about to blow my head off two minutes ago, so I don’t feel too bad about being cruel.” She poked the back of Eva’s head again, “Stand.”
She’d be able to secure a good husband and successor for Howard.
“Classes haven’t even started yet and I’m probably already expelled.”
“Well, there was only one Madame.”
“I have to admit, that was probably the best performance I’ve ever seen.” She turned around, and Steve stood there leaning on the door frame smiling.
She mumbles code into her walkie talkie, and Steve can make out is someone on the other end asking for the shooter's status. He’d forgotten all about him, he pauses “Tell them I’m in pursuit.”
The rest of the year Nika comes to her in her dreams, sometimes sad, usually angry. She never touches her, but the screams are enough to torture her every night. Her absence is quickly discovered, but Toni won’t tell them what happened.
She shouldn’t have said it. Damaged assets were useless too. No matter how good she was, if she was broken, she wasn’t worth the while.
He throws the shield to the ground and wraps the other hand around Amanda, who tries to break his grip furiously, but can only kick her legs. Then in one fluid motion, she throws her leg over his hands and neck and pushed off him.
“Yup, you’re about five weeks along now.” The doctor said cheerfully, ignoring Toni’s current situation. But she expected nothing less, this doctor had already pumped her stomach twice, and given her an IV to sober her quickly a few times, she found it fitting when all of the consequences to her actions came to a head.
She pauses a moment, then laughing she says, “Black mail? How sweet. It’s been a while since I’ve been blackmailed, you make an old woman feel young again.”
All these skills and tricks they’ve taught her for years, and she’s still so powerless.
“We all did.” Steve said.
She rolled over, and tried to block Toni’s next hit, but she was too fast.
They get to the street when the alarms started blaring, Koila tenses, but Toni says, “Don’t worry, we’re actually early. I was expecting them to notice as we were getting out.”
“Hello?” She says, her voice is unfamiliar,
“Oh my gosh, Stark!” Steve yelled from the kitchen, Toni rolled her eyes and traipsed in to watch the show begin, “You do realize people other than you live here?”
“You’ve proven your worth.” Madame began, “Through discipline, perseverance, and loyalty.”
“Yeah it’s called alchohlism.” She paused at the sad look on Rhodey’s face. Maybe re-evalute she thought, it couldn’t hurt to ease up on the drinking, and maybe see Rhodey more or actually get to know her pretty new secretary, Pepper.
“It was four months.” She repeated, “I was being chased by three SUVs, and a fourth hit me head on. There were no survivors. Not the drivers of the other cars, not our daughter. And certainly not me.”
He takes her hand, and they walk up the stairs.
They were given an unfamiliar change of clothes, black pants, a plain blue shirt and a thick jacket. Plus a backpack filled with supplies, like food and water. Enough to last at least a week, maybe more.
She blamed Toni for taking all the missions, and Toni wants to scream that she doesn’t want them, but they’ve created an image, a persona for her, and it’s going to take more than a heart to heart to break it.
They teased her about what she’d do when she finally lost, where she’d go. Her spine shivered at the thought, and her face got tight, settling in a grimace to stop tears from spilling down her cheeks.
“They were going to kill you!” Toni exclaims,
“Wouldn’t be here if they knew I’d run away,” Toni remarks,
“Yeah, please tell me what he or she did so bad you’ve basically blocked off the entirty of the east coast.”
“I’m not going to lose you over something this stupid!” Toni said in a huff.
These kinds of works are a BITCH to write, so if you have any comments, positive or constructive criticism, leave it below!
But all that seemed meaningless. Absolute unimportant, when Bruce flew down from the sky and told her about Thanos.
The day after the award show, Annie walked into school just as usual, and sat nearby them, they seemed to be talking normally about some boy in their class, and how hot he was, and when Annie agreed passively not even sure with boy they were talking about, Eryn, the unofficial leader of the group said,
After the informal debriefing, Fury took her outside of the hospital room Steve was recovering from his fall in, “You have a place at SHIELD if you want it. You’re skilled, well trained. You’d make a great agent.”
“Yeah I know babe.” He walked towards her opening for a hug and he practaclly carried her back to bed where they sat in silence for a minute.
Katya sneers, “I’d rather die than spend another minute with you.”
Carly hit Jason again but her grin stuck too, and Annie couldn’t hear much of what they were saying anymore.
“Right.”
“Afraid people are gonna target me because of you because I am too. But we’re not superheroes. New York doesn’t have it’s own Batwoman, but I think I’ll be fine.”
Toni narrowed her eyes, trying to keep her face even and not radiate the fear she felt.
“What’s not fair is that years ago I had a plan. To protect us. A plan that would’ve come in pretty damn handy.”
“Yeah?” Toni braced herself for the look, and the pause, and the word. Lesbian.
“I don’t want a slut for a mother.” She said, breaking Francesca and her own heart with one sentence. Maria’s head shifted upward with approval, she’d done the right thing in her book, and she spun on her heel considering Francesca secure, now no one in the house wanted her here. Annie copied her actions, turning towards her bedroom and wishing Francesca’s sobs would fade away quicker. She knew no matter what she said, Francesca would be leaving. She couldn’t afford to be taken down with her. But she’d loved her, with her whole heart and she mourned the death of their friendship.
Then she lifted a pair of large pink shoes in the air, after giving out the leotards, “These are Pointe shoes, professional ballerinas use them. I expect you all to be able to use them in no less than one years time.”
It was a simple process really, they take a little blood. Painless. It’s at the end, when the doctor tells her she’s all set to go home, and walks into the next room, smiling widely, and says, “Ok Maia!” Less painless.
While she’d been looking towards Madame and the Instructor, Katya rushed her. Unlike the other girls, Katya wasn’t much bigger than Toni, agile maybe, but Toni was better. She let Katya grab her arms and swept her feet, knocking the girl to the ground.
Her gut sinks. They still don’t know. Elimination means exactly what it sounds like. One of them won’t leave this room alive. Just like Madame said, she doesn’t let candidates escape.
It wasn’t their first big fight, but it looked like it might be their last. Barnes choose a very bad moment to show up, with a murder charge on his head.
“Ms. Stark.” A young doctor calls her after she checks in, “come with me.”
“Oh! She paused! She paused Sin!”
“Antonia Sobol. Daughter of Henrik and Marzia Sobol, who recently lost their jobs and sold two of their daughters to the Nazran Olive House. To be slaves, whores.”
“You had a baby? When! You’re nineteen!”
She was an assassin. Of course, that’s what she’d been training for. But also an evac operative, and a spy, and thief, and much more.
It wasn’t long till the guards came around. They took two women outside every night for execution. The longer the Prime Minister held on to his position, the more prisoners would die, one of which was his daughter.
They didn’t suspect her for being a traitor. She had a reputation as the most successful asset yet. They wouldn’t see it coming, and they wouldn’t notice her leaving.
Sure enogh two monthes later the Stark pistol XI 4 came out, exactly how Toni had designed it, with Howard Stark printed across the handle.
She planned the escape diligently. It all came together when she got her first long term mission.
“Stop joking alright.” Tania said seriously, “Either I die soon, or Eva dies soon and we have to fight to the death. It’s not going to be good. Everything’s going to change.”
She felt like the room had gotten smaller the longer they talked, and Toni couldn’t even bring herself to look towards the woman as she gave the final details of her new assignment. She just nodded in understanding and turned away.
Toni slowly scooted out from behind the table, and stepped over the boxes, almost silently. Good thing Eva was so distracted by whoever had been shot, Toni easily snuck up behind her and grabbed the gun.
The dress that evening sat on her well, and her curly hair magically had volume, thanks to a very dedicated hair stylist. She looked much older than she was, fifteen or sixteen or even older. But this is what they wanted, they did this on purpose.
“You’ve been physically harassed before.”
“But not at the office?” She said
“Oh don’t act like this is all for your parents. You’re upset I had them take you. You wish I’d left you in that car.”
“I’m sorry. I didn’t know.”
-May 4th global anti-bullying day, as per UN
“I’ve heard a few things recently that really upset me.”
Toni must have made a face, probably of disgust, because Elle and Sindy laughed,
Tania shakes her head, “So you think they’ll just let us both be assets?”
Steve throws his jacket on the bed, “God damnit Toni this is why I don’t want to go public.”
“Let’s get one thing straight. Just because I’m attracted to girls doesn’t mean I don’t have standards, so you giggling about me going into your room at night is ridiculous because anyone with eyes wouldn't touch you with a ten foot pole and a barf bag. Secondly, I think me telling the administration about your stealing activity lately might stop you from coming back next year all together, but even if it doesn’t, telling them how I hack your tired ass laptop back to hell will certainly get me expelled so I won’t be seeing you next year. By the way, as you know I’m an oblivious rich girl, so tell me what a girl like you from a poor ass town with a criminal record will look like to colleges, I’d really really like to know.”
The ride was silent. Her apartment was in the heart of Moscow, where she could be operated by Hydra at a moments notice.
She walks for nearly two hours before she finds a creek, the best place to set up camp. She walks ten minutes in each direction to make sure neither of the other girls had the same idea.
“Amanda?” He says,
Tania’s pauses a moment, then starts to say something else, when Madame walks in followed by a pack of Instructors.
She heard someone cry out from the hallway, and saw Eva slowly walked to the doorframe, sharply gasp and run into the hall. If she cranked her neck back, she could see her holding something in her arms, but more importantly, she could see the rifle she had, laying on the ground behind her.
She’s inherited Stark Industries on her twenty first birthday, and Uncle Obie seemed fake happy for her, which was nice.
No matter what she did all week, Tania wouldn’t even look at her. It was a given that she was stuck with Toni for fighting on Friday.
Toni smiles sweetly, “This way?” and without waiting for a response she starts down the hallway.
Target: Howard Stark, Maria Stark
Time: 2200
Captain Rogers is what Howard always called him, Captain America was too formal, they were supposedly best buds, but Steve or Rogers wasn’t respectful.
“And here I am.” She shrugged, “He wasn’t supposed to return for hours, I would’ve come sooner if I’d known...”
“солдат. что это?” Toni blinks in surprise. Soldier? The man must be with him, she decided. And he was confused.
The spar was quick and easy. Toni let Nika get a few hits in early on, but it was a clean sweep at the end. Eighty two wins, fifteen losses.
Steve looked around chuckling himself, “What?”
And suddenly Toni was kissing Sindy, but not like she’d kissed Lucie. Lucie was gentle and soft, but Sindy was excited and adventurous. Her tongue wasn’t shy she basically leaned over onto Toni mid kiss.

Nika drops her arms. “You’re eleven?”
She’d packed a blanket with her. They’d allowed the girls to bring whatever they could fit in their bags.
The hairs on her arms stood up as she saw Eva’s black flats pass her hiding spot a third time, she moved slowly and deliberately, taking her time searching every room, because she knew she had the luxury.
“Unimportant.” Toni squats down, and sifts through the first box of papers,
It was the last day, and it would have been perfect. Rhodey arrived that afternoon to take her away, she’d thought for the last time, but Maria had other plans. She packed her bags in silence, and met Rhodey at the exit of the school.
Before he could react, she jerked her elbow to her nose, and wrapped the long chain between her handcuffs around the second guard.
It’s cold most days, snows a lot. Toni’s only seen snow a few times before she thinks.
They touch back on earth quickly, in Wakanda, where Toni kept meaning to visit after it opened up to the rest of the world, never found the time between recently attempting and failing to save the world.
The selection process was explained to her in her first week. Do what we say, be smart, strong and perfect in every way, and maybe you’ll survive.
“Not fast enough.”
“Antonia?” She says, “My name is-”
Madame strolled in moments later, holding a manila folder with a stack of white papers, she seemingly read it aloud, “Antoinette Stark. Born 1985, to Maria and Howard Stark, heir to Stark Industries and it’s fortune. Gifted in mathematics, and coding, IQ 146.” She closes it suddenly and drops the folder on the table next to her.
She stepped away from him, but his grip was surprisingly tight and strong, “What kind of customer service is that?” He asked, “I’d hate to have to call the front desk about this, be a pity for a pretty thing like you to be out of a job.”
A team up probably wasn’t what Madame or the Instructors wanted anyways, so Toni ducked a different way and found herself trapped in this tiny room with Eva and her assault rifle.
She followed Sasha two doors down, where a girl with a crown braid sat on a bed bobbing her head to music.
“I am not weak.” She declares, casting her gaze towards the rest of the group.
Van shook her head, “No who?”
Svetlana was a deer in the headlights, she’d had no intention of winning this fight, but no one had been killed in the ring yet.
“Subject near artifact recovered. Appears to be human.” She found Captain America’s body! She actually found him? Fuck you Howard!
“So Howard doesn’t have any kids?” the Captain says
“Some of you are not as advanced as other.” Matveev says, “And that makes you a liability. Would anyone here like to prove they are not weak and therefore not expendable?”
Bucky’s face.
Toni smiled back softly, and let Manya lead her down the hallway, she narrated the significance of each room while they last. Some dining rooms were decades old, some board rooms were still in use by their original owners.
“I told you I liked my parents, my sense of humor isn’t as dark as yours is Toni.”
Overkill if you asked Toni. These women couldn’t hurt a fly if they wanted to. They were depressed, bitter, and hopeless, certainly not deserving of the extra security.
She catches a glimpse of Fury on the ground and grimaces, “His.”
The crowd of kids around her didn’t cheer, or even react much, maybe due to disappointment or maybe shock. Everyone was silent, or almost everyone, one girl directly behind her whispered particularly loudly to her friend, “Well she’s still a freak.”
But Toni didn’t have that. Howard and Maria would judge her for the rest of her life, Ronnie didn’t seem like the fatherly type, not to mention he was legal and she wasn’t so their whole relationship created problems by it own, and she had Tera but Tera had been a drinking buddy, not a co-parent or support system. In the end she knew if she did this, she’d do it alone. But the print finally worked, and on her way out the doctor handed her a picture of her baby. And her decision was made.
“He said it was the only way.” She held her hand out, “We have no other options, now come with me.”
“Please, you an old hag?” Toni says, “You’re the most beautiful woman in that room.”
She lay behind a huge table that’d been pushed sideways, and cardboard boxes stood between her an her soon to be killer; another girl, just three years older than her at nineteen, but equipped with a machine gun.
Evelyn face was foaming, she looked like she might start crying, when suddenly it changed, she Annie turned around to see the teacher standing behind her, and she was angry.
Now even during her spars, she gets dicey when someone grabs her neck or her hands.
“How’d you kill her?” Tania says,
ILY Jarvis RIP Francesca
Tania cursed the Instructor under her breath, along with Toni and the spectators, if Zma heard it, she didn’t show.
“Your surgery was successful, you’ll make a full recovery.”
“There was stuff about you in those files wasn’t there.” he says, “Haven’t had the chance to go through them all yet.”
Tania is an easy one. All brawn, little brain. Before her private sessions, she’d have been snapped like a twig, but since she been working on muscle, despite not showing it, if she could get Tania riled up and out of breath quickly, it wouldn’t take much to knock her off balance.
Madame scoffs at the sight of her, “Have trouble putting on your clothes?”
It was easier to pretend to be drunk while she took shots of water than to sit in her cold apartment staring at the TV reporting her latest mission.

Maia waves goodbye.
Steve gaps, she’s so familiar, was this the other figure following the soldier the other night?
Lucie paused to consider, “Why?”
“I’m trying this hero thing out.” She grouched right back
“Well it’s been forever.”
So she embraced ruthlessness.
“Sindy, Elle, you be here when I get back.”
For a moment she considered following Tania, but the older girl shot her a look of pure loathing as they were released into the maze of rooms, as if to warn her away. She heed that warning.
She scans the room, wondering who’ll go. Maybe she will, it would be a twist, but it wouldn’t hurt class morale nearly as much as a more popular candidate’s death would. A reasonable choice for elimination.
Rhodey follows the doctor into her room, and she lays back down on the bed.
So she packed her things, ditched the bong and even wore something fancy to Christmas Eve with Howard and Maria Stark, she honestly didn’t know why she expected it to go differently than every other Christmas Eve.
“Begin.” A familiar voice said, they turned to look towards the source and saw that Madame had joined the Instructor in observation. There would be an elimination, Toni was sure of it.
“She’s late, she was supposed to be here a couple days ago but...I don’t know.”
“What’s the body count at now?” Klara said as she slouched into the hall, “I heard you enjoy eating blood, is that true?”
Toni steeled her breath, “I didn’t want Nika to die, but I don’t want Katya to die either.”
After almost two decades of being entirely invisible, it was unnerving to be watched all the time.
“That’s if he even buys it for a second! They only found him a few hours ago, how accurate it you’re little set? How well have you researched this?”
“I could die.” Toni said
She responds quickly, her heart racing, “Call Phillip Coulson.”
“And SHIELDs,” Pierce adds, “If you do this, none of your past can remain hidden. Are you sure you're ready for the world to see you? As you really are.”
The last few stragglers in the back of the bar, slowly make their way to the door, and then it’s just the two of them at the bar.
Servants clean up dinner quickly after that, Mother stayed at the table, Antoinette did too, she hadn’t been excused yet.
Nika is killed for ‘telling lies’ and Toni starts out the chapter fed up with lying, but finishes the chapter lying through her teeth so she isn’t also eliminated
But Sunday night she got a notification, “Shit.” Brynn exclaimed, she rarely swore, “What?” Toni replied
“That’s another project. It silences automatically, tells the shooter when the targets in range, and had pin point accuracy.”
“Then what’s plan A?”
“You love me?” Toni said her voice shaking, she sat up on her knees now.
“Listen to me. Did he have a metal arm?” She said, finally standing up from the desk,
“What good name? The only difference between you and me is you did it in front of your wife and child.” Toni replies equally as calmly
Evelyn might have started to deny any problem but quickly decided against it, “I think you’re a stuck up little brat who doesn’t deserve a thing she has.”
Fury held up his phone, a message quickly typed out on it read, “Ears everywhere.”
Toni nodded, she knew what was happening, but how could she even try to stop it without getting the back of Howards hand again.
She didn’t know where they were going, though she recognized each hallway. She recounted classes, and lessons as she past rooms filled with girls and Instructors.
New being a relative term. He’d lived there for months, but spent half the time living in SHIELD barracks instead. They were usually closer, more convenient. Plus he felt more like he was just away from home when he slept in the dull grey room.
“We couldn’t save both of you, you were losing so much blood, and there was already damage to the fetus.”
I've been trying to get in touch with user EQfan74, if you know them or have can contact them, please send them my way.
She should have seen it coming honestly, because everything she touches turns to ash, or worse. Nothing gold can stay ponyboy.
Steve paused, “And how’d you think it would go?”
Asset: Unnamed Candidate
She hands her a small black pistol from the table, and gives her instructions, “Kill her.”
Also this one was iffy, prob gonna edit it
Tania leans closer, “Not really, you can tell me. I have to say I’m impressed you turned the tables that quickly.”
Anya Sokolov was set to inherit an enormous wealth. Daughter of some elusive oil company’s CEO, and has been homeschooled for her entire childhood, this party was her unofficial introduction to society.
“You aborted it?” He said, “You killed our baby?”
She cuts her hand on the rocks as she claws at the ground, trying to get away from the men surrounding her, but they grab her arms and she’s so tired she barely fights as they throw her into the back of the van that pulled up when she wasn’t looking.
“I don’t know.” Toni said shifting her weight on her heels, they were only an inch or two high, while Sindy and Elle’s were easily four, “Why don’t we sit.”
“I love you too.” And before she knows it, they both lean forward, and close their eyes.
She sighed, “No one called me Lucette. It’s Lucie. Lucette is like...so stuffy.”
Then she’d slowly walk towards the boys on the basketball court, they played with a much smaller net, because they were very short, but Antoinette could definitely join in. Well, she could join in if when she asked to play they didn’t sneer at her, even calling to the teacher and accusing her of bothering them.
“All sorts.” She says, and starts unstrapping the restraints on her arms, why are there restraints on her arms? Before she can ask, Madame says, “You’ll learn world history, science, math, literature, and of course the feminine tricks, seduction and hand to hand combat.”
Suddenly he stopped walking, Toni rested on the ground panting. She carefully touched the back of her head, finding her fingers covered in blood. She tried to jump back away from the murderer, but his grip on her foot was like iron. She could only pull for a few minutes before she was out of breath, and she hadn’t gained an inch. She rested on the ground a few moments, when she heard the hum of an engine nearing.
She stops, “I don’t have anything to give you. Leave me alone.”
“I don’t think that’s the point.”
New York City was probably a mistake. Known for her wild party attitude, she got invites the second she stepped foot inside the city.
“Oh, I’m sure that Harvard thing was much more important.”
With a single word his whole demeanor changed.
Toni didn’t speak. She didn’t want to. Maybe they’d take her off missions, she was torn between immense relief, and the knowledge that an asset that doesn’t go on missions is useless. And useless means dead.
Natasha stops, “Have we met before?”
She took a look at the scene one more time before she left, the guard still unconscious, about to wake up to a dead body. The mansion looked quiet and peaceful from here, she almost wanted to go see Manya again before she left.
-May 25th national missing kids day, also my friends birthday chapter 2
Nika looks smaller in the dark hallway, more lost. Her eyes are as round as saucers when she sees Toni.
The agent nodded, “Let’s.”
“That’s quite right.” Smiled Madame, and Toni's blood lit on fire. She couldn't save Nika now. All she could do was kill herself as well. Submit or be submitted. Kill or die.
“On whose orders?” he says, letting her further into the apartment,
“그 책에 대해 말해줘?”  The Instructor asks, Klara wasn’t any good at Korean, none of them were, since they’d only started learning it a few weeks ago. So asking Klara to summarize the book just wasn’t fair.
“What are you going to do?” He asks
“Three months, maybe a little longer.”
“Aw come on Howard. Go look at the robot.”
“Well I’m Sindy and this is Elle.” Sindy said, before looking Toni up and down, “Toni, Toni, Toni. That’s a boys name.”
“But I won’t bore you with that, Utkyn and Sobol are tied with two eliminations each, Shvets has none. We usually choose the final assets by kill count, eliminating the one with the smallest.”
She’d had a leg up since they started nearly two years ago, literally and metaphorically. Not only her daily workouts that built up muscle tone, but also her small figure and petitie look. She was one of the girls in her class who actually looked like a ballerina.
Natasha looked up, and Toni shoved the gun into his back roughly, he fell forward slightly, and turned around chuckling, “There she is.”
“Hello. My name is Instructor Zma, I will be teaching you combat.”
“Is that an interrogation room?” She asks
Toni’s mouth went completely dry, was this a trap? Was she lured here to be laughed at then kicked out to her boring dull room.
“Yeah, why?” She pauses in realization, “I can’t.”
Tania starts to reply when another voice chimes in, “Can you two quit flirting or get a room?” they both pauses awkwardly, “Some of us are trying to sleep.”
“I’m fine, doc didn’t say I had to stay and the Towers medical facility is state of the art.”
She finally had to leave after a week on staying put, throwing on her loosest dress and maybe she looked pregnant or a little fat, but no one knew who she was so she walked down the Italian streets with pride.
They woke up late that night, most people had left, those who hadn’t did their best to that afternoon.
“Yes.”
“You think you’re some hero?” She says, sneering, “Well, you’re not. You’ve only made it worse.”
“A few things here and there. It isn’t long till someone puts together who I was. Who I am.”
“I’m Jason Leonards and this is Carly Vespice and we’ve gone through almost every look to grace the 1992 Oscar’s carpet last night, except maybe the most controversial. Jodie Foster, won for Best Actress last night, her fourth nomination and second win. She wore a pale pink suit with a little red ribbon, but we aren’t here to talk about what she wore on her, we’re talking about who she wore with her!”
The presumption sent murmurs through the group, and Toni almost didn’t notice the Instructor call her and Tania’s name.
“Next time it’ll be even more of a tumble.”
Ann is assured the plan was to send her to boarding school after elementary school anyways, but she’s thinks it had more to do with getting kicked out of school after school, they’d probably run out of private schools, and god forbid Antoinette Stark goes to public school.
It’s him again. The shooter. The Winter Soldier, Natsha told him about the asset, the ghost. Before he can think about what to do next, the car is flipping and they’re all sprawled on the highway, cars zooming beside them.
