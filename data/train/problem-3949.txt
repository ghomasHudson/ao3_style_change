Cas’ lips turn up a bit, but he still looks like Dean hollowed him out with his words. He realizes quite suddenly that it was a selfish thing, Cas’ confession all those weeks ago. Dean’s glad that Cas finally decided to take what Dean had been too afraid to offer, and he’s glad that Cas was able to find some peace through it. But Dean’s never been very good at being selfish. Seeing how Cas looks just as gutted as Dean had been that night, Dean almost wishes he’d never opened his mouth.
Charlie manages to stay at least a little sympathetic before starting her hysterical laughter all over again, doubling up and wheezing, his items lying forgotten on the counter between them.
“I had just gone through a really…nasty breakup. It was stupid though, irrational. I’m glad I failed…”
His plan, while heroic and romantic and meaningful, well, it hadn’t been perfect. Use the spell Nick left to open the door to the Empty. Find Cas. Tell him he loves him, tell him he wants him home, tell him there’s nothing,
“Speaking of how much you two love each other, has Cassie seen the backyard?” Hannah asks, and Cas looks away from Dean to look at her.
of his lines, but Cas, I thought it was great.” Dean carries his bag over his shoulder, his costume folded up neatly for tomorrow’s performance along with his gym clothes. Cas holds his head in his hands.
“You told me every picture of her burned. I wanted you to have at least one,” he says with a shrug. Dean is looking back down at her, and she is smiling up at him. She is beautiful. She is radiant, holding gently to the baby in her arms.
“Okay,” Cas says simply, and they leave it at that. “I should probably go home,” Cas says finally and stands. “See you tomorrow.”
“What?” he asks, but Dean is not ready for Cas to play dumb. He is ready for the screaming and the fighting and things returning to normal.
It’s so sincere that it stings a bit, and Dean knows he doesn’t mind. Cas isn’t greedy with his love, with his reassurances. Dean just has to get used to asking for them, accepting them.
, not the way I love Dean. You don’t understand what it means to be in love with someone.” Gabe’s eyes harden, and he leaves. Cas goes back to huddling.
They make the 90 mile road back to Sceadan Street in under an hour, and the memories start in on Cas immediately. Dean is attached to each and every one. They are all attacking him, assaulting him, ripping him apart, and Castiel is doing all he can to keep them at bay. He knows he fucked it up. He knows. He doesn’t need these memories to tell him that, but that doesn’t stop them.
This time though, as he grasps the edge of the bottle, the chair slips out from under him, sending him and the entire shelf that the bottle was on shattering towards the ground. Dean is too shocked to cry, doubly so when he feels John jerk him away before he hits the ground.
“Hi. Cas. You’re in my house,” Cas says, stepping away even though Dean follows him for every inch, that grin still on his face.
“I—” Dean starts again, then gets tangled up in the words. “I know what you meant now. When you said it wasn’t in the having, but just in being. You don’t have to love me anymore. I…I know I fucked things up. I dragged you down, made you human, just like me, and I know that isn’t what you want. So, you don’t have to love me, but just, please, let me say it. Please.”
Cas keeps expecting him to leave, but a beat passes, and another, and both are still trapped in the small, silent moment stretching outward between the two. Eventually, the cashier speaks again, voice casual.
fucking awkward. Dean’s hunched over, and Cas’ arms are fiercely tight around him, but his own are just kind of mushed between their stomachs. Cas’ breath—faster than he’s used to, given that angels don’t technically have to breathe—is ghosting over the iced juncture of his neck, and Cas, though bloody, is the first thing he’s smelled that hasn’t been tar and mountain or bourbon-laced sadness in weeks, so, slowly, Dean relaxes, and his hunch becomes more of a slouch, until he’s basically kneeling in the floorboard with his face pressed into Cas’ chest.
“Deal,” Cas agrees, reeling Dean in by his hair and kissing him. They stay that way for a while, kissing lazily and feeling each other like they always have. When they finally decide that they’ve had enough, Dean kisses his new
assholery, verbal degrading, mention of a panic attack, depression, belittling, telling him he's a fuck up (not sure of the verb for that), and just general making to feel like he's worthless. I'm sorry...
“Thanks, Sammy. Tell Jess the same.” Then he’s off to first period to stare at the empty desk with Cas’ name on it, the silence at the “Castiel Milton” portion of roll call.
, Dean thinks. If he’s breaking his diet, he’s dining on steak and ordering dessert. He goes back to the voicemails saved from when they were still together.
another man. Dean, however, jerks away from Cas immediately upon the sight of her, clamoring out from under him and grabbing the first piece of clothing he can find to cover himself.
“It is,” Charlie says, her voice suddenly very serious. “These people suck, but they are hella good at their jobs. They shove those damned pills down your throat and wear you down and break your spirit and make you think that you are nothing just because you like the same sex. There have even been a few times when they’ve made
“Cas!” Cas hears his name on those lips, and what is he to do but pause. He turns after a moment, and standing there, still clutching Emma to his chest, is
“Grumpy pants in the morning, are we?” Dean says, mouthing along Cas’ neck and exposed shoulders, back and glorious ass. Cas grumbles again, but Dean is not convinced, especially with the way Cas is writhing beneath him, spreading his legs and arching his ass up to meet Dean’s nipping and licking mouth. Dean bites Cas’ ass cheek before lapping his tongue along the bite to soothe it. He then licks broad stripes against the underside curve of Cas’ ass, where Cas' cheek meets his leg. He makes it to the middle and laps at Cas’ hole, earning himself a whine from Cas.
"And Ms. Milton asked the boys to get dressed, told Cas she loved him, and went to make the happy couple a pie. The End." If only, right...
“Me too,” Dean says, and after a moment of swelling silence, the pair hangs up the phone. Dean crawls back into bed beside his wife feeling colder than ever, and Cas drives back into the city to sleep in a bed
As they ride off their high, they remain pressed close, skin sticking to the other with sweat and come. Cas finally unwinds his fingers from Dean’s, letting their now limp dicks fall to Cas’ stomach, drawing a whimper out of them both. They just lie there and breathe for a while, then Cas laughs a bit.
“Gabriel,” Cas chokes out, horrified, still staring at Sam. “This is Sam Winchester.” Gabriel reels back to look at Cas, eyes wide and incredulous.
“You're on step seven, Cassie,” she says, dropping her jeans and panties to the floor before crawling towards him. “This is what step seven is. You’ve humbly asked Him to remove your shortcomings, and here, that means you’ve asked Naomi to fix you. That’s why I’m here, to show you that straight sex is better, and
Kneeling there in that chapel, he becomes the mold of who these people have been trying to make him. Everything he’s worked for, everyone he’s ever wanted to be, slips away and he is left with Lucifier. He is left with Dorothy. He is left with Dick and Tessa and Hannah and Lilith and Demian and Barnes and every other patient who has been in and out of this clinic. Cas is gone. He isn’t the gay playwright in love with his best friend. Instead, he is left with Castiel, man on the mend from homosexuality, Christian, good.
“Whatever you want, Dean,” he whispers, brushing his lips against Dean’s once again, and when Dean pulls away, he manages to get a handful of lotion smeared across both of their dicks. Cas hisses at the cold, and Dean kisses his neck in apology. Soon enough, Cas is back to his nibbling, and Dean begins tugging, hand tight around them both. It doesn’t take long, what with Cas having been brought so close to the edge moments before and Dean knowing he wasn’t just sucking a cock down his throat, but that it was
“I thought we’d hang out, if you wanted. Make use of that rain check,” he says, tossing Cas a wink. Anna rolls her eyes.
?” Cas says nothing. His mom probably warned Naomi of Dean, of their situation. She has been playing him all along, and he hates them all in this moment. “If someone did that for me," Naomi continues with a small shrug. "I’d do everything in my power to thank that person.”
Cas’ grip is tight and slow, agonizing, really. He keeps Dean from moving with weight of his body, the touch of his hand. After what feels like an eternity of glorious, agonizing jerking, Cas picks up the pace a bit, rocking his hips against Dean’s with a slight grunt every time. Cas’ rhythm is soon stuttering out, giving way to frantic, erratic thrusts and jerks, and with the added friction of Cas’ cock rubbing against Dean’s—not to mention the
“I think so,” Cas answers, uncertainly. His brows are knit together again, and if his head weren’t pressed into the pillow, Dean feels sure it would be cocked to the side.
“God, don’t let me regret this,” Sam mutters instead of responding. “Give me ten minutes and we’ll leave.”
“You don’t,” Dean asks with a smirk. He doesn’t look like he believes it. Cas says nothing, just keeps his eyes firmly on Dean’s so he doesn’t have to look down.
“What do you want?” Dean asks finally, and he’s proud to say his voice doesn’t shake. Standing there in his father’s old leather jacket, dick still limp from his romp with Bela, heart still shattered from his affair with Cas, hall pass in hand, Dean’s voice does not shake in the slightest.
“I don’t even want to hear it. You boys are like my own. I’m not going to leave you stuck here with him, and I’m definitely not gonna leave you out on the streets. I been plannin' on taking you boys for a while—with your consent, of course. Even got some lawyers involved. That’s the real reason I came for Christmas, to try and talk some sense into your daddy, to try and make him see that unless he started treatin' you boys right, he was gonna lose ya.” A long moment passes during which Sam and Dean stare at Bobby in wonder.
When Dean gets home, he drops Sammy off and goes straight to Cas. He doesn’t bother with the front door, instead, heading for the window. He doesn’t bother knocking either, instead slipping his fingers into the crack Cas always leaves open just for him. He slides through the window with a lithe grace, landing next to Cas’ bed with a soft thud. Cas looks up from the book between his hands, eyes shining.
“That’s so wonderful, babe!” he exclaims, leaning forward and pressing a kiss to Cas’ lips. Cas’ cheeks burn. “You’re finally gonna be published! It’s your dream come true, Cas,” he says, and Cas nods, a smile tugging at his own lips. They sit in silence for a moment before Dean speaks again, his tone light. “Maybe she should put Emma up on the stage. The kid’s been going on for
“Dinner in eight,” she says, leaving and pulling the door shut behind her. Dean finds himself in the dining room with a smiling and oblivious Sam eight minutes later. “Sam, sweetheart,” Lilith calls from the kitchen over her shoulder, an apron tied pristinely around her waist. “Could you set the table for me?”
“I was. I shouldn’t have said most of what I did yesterday, but that doesn’t mean there wasn’t truth to it.” Dean’s eyes lock on Cas’ for the first time today, and Cas’ heart stutters in his chest. “You’re toxic to me. When you’re around…things in my life fall apart. I’m not blaming you or anything, it’s just how I react to you. When you’re around, I think I’m invincible and that nothing bad could ever happen. I act recklessly and carelessly, and everything I love gets taken from me. When you’re around, I think that everything is right with the world, and that’s just not true. You’re a taker, Cas, and I have nothing left to give.” Cas’ mouth flutters open and shut, his heart slamming in its cage. Dean is not wrong. Cas has been nothing but toxic to Dean for years, taking every inch of happiness he’s ever had and shredding it.
“Well, nothing really. It means you’re closer to getting your new baby than if you had signed up today, but since Dean just put your names and didn’t take it further, you still have to meet with our consultant to discuss the options.”
“Take a break. The next couple of scenes are mostly mine.” Dean tries to smile. He doesn’t know what’s wrong with him; all he can think about is how he’s never felt this with Benny. He’s never felt like the love and terror he was channeling into his character was real, but here he is, staring at Cas, thinking that he’s never seen the guy so free, thinking that he’s never seen the guy so beautiful, thinking he'd do anything to protect him. Cas steps away from Dean to help with the set change, but Dean finds himself rubbing his perfectly manicured hair into worried spikes.
He couldn’t know any of this, not that night, but he knows, as he stands watching Dean twirl Emma around the dance floor, that there’s nowhere else he’d rather be, no one else he’d rather love.
them the last few feet through the doorway, clutching Cas with everything in him until the light of the barn explodes around them and the wall he’d used to open the Empty gurgles closed again.
He deserves to find peace, too, but he doesn’t know if peace is possible with Cas looking at him like that.
good, Cas,” Dean says, putting a hand on his best friend’s shoulder, stopping them in the middle of the sidewalk. “You put your heart into this, and it shows.” Cas manages a small smile. “Now, I’m hungry, so what do you say we go to Ellen’s and grab a burger?” Dean grins at his best friend, and for the first time tonight, Cas really smiles at Dean.
Cas’ hand comes up to cradle Dean’s cheek, and it’s a shock-reverse mirror of every other time they’ve been on death’s doorstep, unfamiliar and terrifying and
“Charlie, that is enough,” Naomi says, but Charlie’s eyes are already glittering. Cas can't help but grin.
His breath comes in short, panicked bursts, and the sound barely makes it to his ears before being swallowed up by the Empty.
“Hell yeah, I’m proud. I practically raised the kid.” Dean smiles out of the windshield for a long moment before glancing back at Cas. “What about you? Is the guy that hired me your only sibling?”
Dean thinks through his daze, daze because Cas is a different life than the one he has, daze because Cas ripped him apart, tore him to shreds and is now standing in front of him, looking as terrified as Dean feels.
Once inside the threshold, Cas allows himself to kiss Dean, reeling him close by the lapels of his shirt and kissing him softly. After a moment, Dean pulls away, grants himself one last kiss, and says that he needs to check the mail. Cas grins and turns to get started on the delicious lunch he’ll be making. When he hears the door open again, he keeps stirring his pasta but turns to give Dean a grin, one that Dean doesn’t see as he flips aimlessly through the postage.
“Not dying,” Dean grunts, trying—and failing—to get his legs under him. Cas startles, and they buckle to the ground at the mouth of the barn. “Just cold,” he finishes lamely, his knees protesting the sudden impact.
“Cas,” Dean had murmured eventually, his voice broken, and Cas couldn’t help but to look up into Dean’s face, look up into the sorrow and hurt.
“Sorry, buddy,” she says, wiping down the bar with a steady hand. “We’re closed ‘til ten,” but when she offers him her full attention, she pauses, a grin stretching across her face. “Hey, it’s Juliet!” she exclaims, straightening up and waving at him.
“Shut up,” Dean says with a smile and a burn of his cheeks. Then he kisses Cas, hot and heavy and desperate with one arm wound beneath Cas’ back and the other fumbling with the lotion on the bedside table because neither had the foresight to bring lube. Cas is kissing, licking, sucking against Dean’s neck, so much so that Dean’s hands tremble and fumble and make it absolutely impossible to get the lotion where it needs to be. “Cas,” Dean pulls away with a groan. “If you want to finish what we’ve started, I’m gonna need to you to stop doing that for like two seconds.” Cas grins at Dean before leaning forward and kissing him softly.
“It’s okay. It’s your birthday. I’ll clean it up. You go take a shower.” Bobby smiles reassuringly at Dean and stoops to start picking up the breakfast. “Go on,” he says when Dean stands there a minute longer, debating whether he should help. Even so, he steps guiltily around the mess and heads for the shower. His wash is quick, perfunctory even, and when he is done, he dresses in the same mechanical manner. Sam is waiting at the kitchen table when Dean comes down the stairs, a candle-topped slice of pie awaiting him at the table.
“Uh, nothing much. This is Sam’s friend, Jessica,” Dean eventually says, and motions to Jessica. The two girls smile and exchange hellos. Jessica turns back to Sam, and Lisa soon enough turns back to Dean. He doesn’t know what to say.
He runs into April on his way out and it takes everything in him not to punch her across her pretty little face. She sees him, and recognition flashes into her eyes.
“Dean,” Cas sighs, leaning forward and trying to catch Dean’s eye. Dean doesn’t say anything, just stares at his clasped hands before him. The silence stretches into oblivion around them, and before he knows it, Dean is drowning in it. There has never been an awkward silence between Cas and Dean. Cas, the epitome of awkward, has never once in his entire twelve-year friendship with Dean caused an awkward moment, but now…
to me so I can find out what the fuck's wrong! So when you’re ready to tell me about what your problem
“Sorry Emma,” he says, stepping inside and turning his back to her so he is preserving her modesty and speaking towards the wall. “They’re ready for you, Dean,” he says, and Dean smiles at his daughter, does up the last of her little pearl buttons and stands.
“Dean,” Cas shrieks, pushing Meg off him and fumbling for his pants, as though Dean hasn’t seen it all before. Dean, however, Dean is already scrambling down the ladder, jumping at the highest rung he can get away with and all but sprinting towards the house. “Dean, please wait,” Cas calls. Dean can hear him clambering his way down the ladder before jumping away and running after Dean. Cas eventually catches up with him, flinging a hand around Dean's arm to turn him around. “I’m so sorry. I shouldn’t have brought her up there. That’s our place.”
“Sure thing, bug,” Dean says after clearing his throat and turning his thoughts away from Cas. He reads with Emma until Lydia shows back up, wearing that dress Dean swears he likes with lips painted pristinely.
“Bobby’s…Lebanon…Vermont. I don’t know.” He doesn’t know anything anymore. He just knows he can’t stay here with her, with his father, with
Cas probably thought Dean was just jerking him around all over again, torturing him for the fun of it.
“I’m not gonna make you stay,” Bobby says softly, that smile still on his face. “But, boys, he was so damn
“Cas, it’s not going to break.” Dean, just to prove it, stomps once, twice, three times against the ice. He even slams both feet down against it just for good measure, laughing when his foot slips and he crashes to the ice.
“They’re going to love you,” she tells him before kneeling down before him. “Now listen. I know you’re scared about your first day of school, but you’re already
When it is over, Cas sags against Dean, wilting slowly inside of him, Dean’s come slowly cooling between them. Dean lets him, holding his boyfriend close to his chest and staring up at the ceiling, uncaring to the nastiness of this post sex state. Dean stares up at that ceiling for an eternity.
“Well, you did a wonderful job. I saw it at school the day before, and I thought it was good. But when I watched it the next night, I cried like a baby even though I knew what happened. It was so,
a slut,” Kevin says loudly, laughter hiding in the edge of his voice and Dean can’t help but laugh too, especially at the comically wide eyes Benny offers up to make sure Andrea didn’t hear.
His son is having gay sex with a monster, and he’s practically begging to have Cas fuck him up the ass.
“Sam,” Dean starts finally, softly, warily. Sam looks over, eyes wide like Dean just told him he ran over his puppy. “You don’t see the way she looks at you.” Sam’s eyes grow even wider, and it might be comical if he didn’t look so terrified. “Give it to her, and let me be the best man at your wedding,” Dean says with a smile, and the terror slowly seeps out of Sam’s eyes.
“I hope by ‘hang out’ you mean crazy amounts of making out and shower blow jobs,” Dean says, turning and batting his eyelashes at Cas.
“You’d never be able to go to far for me Dean.” Cas said simply, “I’ll always want whatever you want.”
“Nope!” Dean said, pulling Cas down further into the couch until they both lay side by side, with Cas slung over Deans chest. He wrapped his arms around Cas’ middle and laid one of Cas’ legs over his waist. “Better?”
“Me either” Dean laughed, “but I’ll be damned if I’m not kind of enjoying this. Not that I like the fact you’re in pain, I hate that, but this is nice. Are you okay?”
“Pack your things, Anna. We’re leaving right this instant,” her mother hisses angrily, still packing the suitcase.
is what makes him feel the most cut open and raw. Even flaying out his love for Cas doesn’t compare, because even when he hasn’t said it, he’s
“I’ll send your chauffeur your way,” he says and hangs up. He leans forward and kisses Cas again, cherishing in the feeling. It has been far too long. “Sam wants you to pick him up on your way back to my place.”
The wind rattles the tin of the shop walls, and Dean shifts his thoughts. He remembers how he thought of Cas on his wedding day, thought of how different the whole thing would have been. Lydia had insisted they have the wedding before she started to show too much, so the whole thing was wrapped up into three months of planning. She looked beautiful that day, none the less, but Dean was still thinking of Cas. He was standing there in the church, eyes of hundreds of people he didn’t know watching him, surrounded by groomsmen that Lydia had picked—aside from Sam, of course. He stood there, staring down the aisle at the doors in the back, and for an instant, he almost convinced himself that everything up until that moment had been nothing but a twisted dream, that Cas going to the clinic, saying what he said, leaving, wandering the country, his suicide attempt, tearing through woman after woman, man after man, finding the bar in Seattle, being lied to by Lydia, that all of it was some nightmare. He almost convinced himself that he’d blink, and the strangers would disappear, replaced by family and friends, the church would disappear, replaced by the little clearing beside their treehouse, the woman starting her march towards him would disappear, replaced by the dark hair, a dark suit, a pair of smiling blue eyes. But he blinked, and he was still surrounded by strangers, he was still in the church, he was still marrying Lydia instead of Cas.
“What the hell's it to you? If he likes boys shouldn’t mean nothing to you!” Bobby jerks John a final time, this time tossing him away from his sons. Bobby glares at him for a long moment before kneeling down to pick Sam up.
“Isn’t it better to have loved and lost than to have never loved at all?” he asks her, attempting to smile to cover his shaking.
“Cas, calm down." Dean rubs a hand over his eyes. "You’re his understudy, right?” Dean asks, all traces of sleep gone from his voice, but he still has to squint up at him. Cas nods slowly.
“It’s okay,” Cas answers. He presses Dean gently backwards, until his knees hit the bed, and he collapses onto it, still clinging to Cas’ coat. “I’m gonna make you feel so good,” Cas purrs.
“Nah…I got Cas a street sign,” Dean says with a small laugh. Dean, despite his low sense of self-worth, honestly believes Cas will love his gift.
The first time Dean made love to Cas was weeks ago, mere days after their first time period. Cas was a whimpering mess, and Dean decided that he rather liked seeing Cas come undone beneath him, almost as much as he liked seeing Cas come undone above him. So Dean takes hold of Cas’ hips and pushes his tongue inside him, savoring the whimper Cas lets out. From there, Dean stretches him slowly, first with his tongue, then with his fingers, pulling him apart until Cas is nothing but a writhing mess beneath him.
a Cas and Dean wedding…” he says after a long moment, and the thought alone hurts him. He always thought they would be together forever, even at five.
“Yeah,” he says, then falling silent. Miles pass, and Dean is ready to let it go. If Sam’s not joking, he’s not going to push it, raised him or no. Then all at once, words erupt from Sam like a dam were breaking. “Itsapromisering,” he half-shouts, and if he didn’t look so terrified, Dean might laugh.
As they do, the crowd around them starts applauding and cheering, and, at first, Dean thinks it’s for them, and he thinks, maybe, they should have moved away from the protest for this, but then everyone starts cheering,“Nevada’s blue! Nevada’s blue! Nevada’s blue!”
He even goes as far as to whip his head around to the front window to check for what he assumes is solid proof Cas should not be allowed to sell cars.
He’s worried that he’s going to tell the doctor the truth, rather than following the human rule of saying he’s fine.
“Wonder why Chuck didn’t disappear the dog?” Sam says, and Dean sees his wheels turning, wondering if the dog is some kind of Trojan horse.
They awake in a field of wildflowers in the middle of who knows where, and Dean gently cups Cas’ face in his hands and gently tips his face up. He studies his face carefully. Cas’ lip trembles slightly, and he licks at his lip.
It turns out that leaving Grace to her own devices for what turns out to be three hours, with no supervision, is, in fact, not a great idea.
“What?!... is he okay?” Dean’s taken aback by how concerned Sam sounds. He knew Sam and Cas knew each other, but he didn’t think it was very well. Apparently it was way better than he thought.
But when they start hunting again, and digging up graves at 3 a.m and doing research until dawn becomes completely commonplace, routine kind of goes out the window.
“I wanted to help him, Sam,” Cas says. “He couldn’t live with what he did. I feared what he would do.”
The image changes, and, slowly, the colors resolve. The picture comes back into focus, and a familiar outline followed by an even more familiar face comes into view.
Cas nods, still not looking up. Dean sighs and settles in next to him before letting himself get sucked in. After the whole nonsense with Amara, he’d be lying if he said he didn’t want this kind of escapism himself. He can give in to the siren call too, at least temporarily.
"Yeah. But, I don't know. It's been long enough that it hurts less when they do. Know they're better off now anyway, far away from me."
“Lena, huh?” Dean asks, only half listening, still reeling from the idea that Cas is living a somewhat normal human life with a job and a house and an honest to God white picket fence.
He doubles back and knocks on the doorframe. “Sorry to interrupt, but, uh, well, you’re the only ones left in the universe since you won’t agree to finish my story.”
“Whoa, okay, buddy. You are definitely not okay,” Dean’s voice crackles in the distance, as the firm weight of his hand comes back to his shoulder. “Sam, he’s...I don’t know. But he’s spacing out on me. I’m going to try and snap him out of it. You drive.”
The thing is, Dean forgets to close his garage most of the time --it’s in his backyard, it’s not visible from the road, and when his Baby’s not in it, there’s not much of anything of real value inside -- and Cas takes this open door as some kind of blanket invitation to borrow his stuff.
“I very much doubt that," Cas sighs as he places his hand against Dean’s cheek. “Dean... are you...are you really sure?”
“Most surgeries are, Mr. Novak,” Dr. Fuller says with a good natured grin as she replaces his gown, seemingly satisfied, “though, if you're truly curious, there's considerable research on the purpose of the appendix.”
It's an excruciatingly long walk -- Cas ought to be horizontal and every couple steps, his body seems keen to remind them. That alone would be problem enough but Grace, who seems to think Dean has whatever was wrong with Cas under control, has decided to enjoy a leisurely walk. She's sniffing everything and trying her hardest to make them trip over her leash.
last night. You feel okay?" He places a surprisingly cool hand to Cas' temple. He frowns. "Sam, we still got that thermometer?"
Ultimately, much to Dean's apparent chagrin, he tells the waitress that he intends to share Dean's rather large breakfast platter in the hopes that something on it will return his appetite.
And, if he’s really honest with himself, he kind of likes this weirdly serious, dorky guy that won’t stay out of his garage, and therefore doesn’t think he should leave the guy here all by his lonesome.
Once Cas is sitting, he pushes up one leg of his sweatpants and winces at Cas’ knee, “...that needs antibiotic ointment and a Band-Aid...”
He knows, intuitively, that something’s been blocking all of this -- all of the things that go bump in the night -- out. But he knows that it still
Cas raises an eye. “If we knew what the witches in this town were up to, we would likely already be on our way back home.”
That when Cas inexplicably returned from the dead, imbued with his own grace, in answer to all of Dean’s prayers, Dean couldn’t look him in the eye.
“Yeah, well, for some godforsaken reason, that moment of true happiness was, well,” Dean reaches down to pet Miracle, and his hand bumps into Cas’, ”telling me he’s in love with me. You dumbass.”
And if Dean himself had a pet, well, he would never have a pet because the damn thing would shed all over his baby, but
He does almost get jolted back to reality when everyone is shaking everyone else’s hands, telling them
“Well, anxiety? Flashbacks? Withdrawal? It adds up.” Cas raises his eyes again, and Dean rolls his. “Did my homework after Hell. Doesn’t mean you should get advice from me on how to deal. My strategy for this stuff is usually to not to.”
“I'll check on you again in the morning, otherwise a nurse will be up to change the bandage over the stitches and bring your evening dose of antibiotics.”
“Lena will be disappointed. I was going to show the Duncan’s a station wagon... one that belonged to a WWII general.”
“Okay, well, your pal here is laid up,” Dean says. “His appendix was about to pop so took him to the hospital.”
But the way Cas is doing it? That’s... Dean still doesn’t know what it is. But he thinks he’s getting warmer.
“I don’t know. Your mojo just started spit firing at my cosmic doppelgänger. You know what that was about?”
“Yeah, well, doesn’t mean...” Dean abruptly drops his hand to bat Cas’ away from the door to the backseat, “Hey, what... what are you doing? Get in the front. This ain't a taxi.”
Garth doesn’t make Dean want to test just how open and accepting Sarah’s longtime place of worship really is.
After all, his younger brother is basically an overgrown golden retriever who just so happens to own a golden retriever. So yeah.
“What?” Dean sounds like he’s been punched in the throat, and the next thing he knows Dean’s arms are wrapped around him so tightly he doesn’t think he could pry them off. “You...you goddamn idiot...Cas...Castiel Winchester, you matter to me. You matter a whole hell of a lot.”
At that, Bobby leans over Dean and puts his hand out. Cas takes it hesitantly as Bobby introduces himself, “Bobby Singer. Dean’s Dad in all the ways that matter. Nice to meet you, Castiel. I've heard a lot about you from this one."
He doesn’t know what exactly he thought was wrong here, and looking at Cas suggests that he’s probably overreacted. From a glance at his slightly pale skin, Dean comes to the conclusion that, at worst, Cas has a cold, which is certainly reason enough for him to be a little absentminded, but not for Dean to come rushing over in a panic.
Snuffling in frustration, he shifts closer to Dean and wraps his arms around his torso, burying his face into Dean’s shoulder.
He flips up his phone again, stares at the now black screen, and thinks, maybe, he really should call Sam.
“Okay. Fine. Metatron,” Dean says pointedly, and Cas immediately swivels back to the television, turning it back on. The rhythmic introduction to Sense8 plays in the background, but he still presses, “You said you put him in traction. You probably could have killed him...”
Now that was what he wanted after a good meal. Along with cracking open a cold beer, ogling a fine ass, and waiting to romp around a bed to burn off the well-earned calories.
“You asshole!” she snapped at him before running after the fleeing loser while calling empty platitudes,
“I appreciate the offer,” Cas said seriously. “Father Raphael mentioned that you had passed along a message for me.”
“We’ll have childcare offered as well,” Dean said after a brief discussion on the details of the raffle and chips and all that.
“Hello, Dean.” Cas said as he took a seat on the firm, red-cushioned chair by the small table. “This is Gabe. Gabe, this is Dean.”
Dean immediately scowled, but Scott didn’t look as if he were making fun. And he was sitting in front of Donnie’s computer.
“Got yourself a real catch there. Good job.” He slapped Sam’s knee, deciding ‘I was checking him out for you’ was a pretty good excuse. It was true too, he was fairly sure. Before Sam could respond, Dean’s hip buzzed. He pulled out his phone and held up a finger to his brother to wait.
“My life is already a living hell. I’m a queer kid in the Bible Belt with an abusive, drunk father and no friends. You can’t make my life worse.”
is Clarence!” Dean watched her for a moment before remembering the story from all those months ago, the one that encouraged him and Cas back together to begin with, and Dean grinned.
The next time they kissed, it was Cas who started it. He had just been given the news that his play would open in L.A., and he was absolutely ecstatic. He’d jumped into Dean’s arms, and kissed him before he could think twice about it. Dean’s cheeks had burned, and though he pulled away slowly, his hands lingered on Cas’ waist. After that, Dean had swallowed his discomfort and sat Cas down to talk.
They start slow. After all, it’s been ten years, and there is a lot of lost time to make up for. They start by making themselves familiar again with the other’s mouth, licking and groaning and moaning and only stopping to breathe long enough to assure them both that this is real, that after ten years of wrong and ten years of
Jess leaves when visiting hours end to go home and see Sammy and Adam. Cas stays the night, and never once does he put Mary down or let anyone else hold her. When she’s awake, he talks to her, telling her about her room and the library and how loved she’ll be. When she’s asleep, he sits perfectly still, gazing down at her with every muscle tensed as not to wake her. He doesn’t sleep at all that night.
“Please,” Cas snorts, pushing back the curtain a bit to see the crowd of students waiting for the play to begin. “I’m the only kid dumb enough to take on being the president of the GSA.”
“Yeah, it’s me,” Dean replies, pulling the toboggan off his head and tossing it to the side for someone else to deal with.
. At least all those years ago, he only hurt Dean—not that that is ever okay—but now, he’s made sure the single most important person to Dean is refused the right to see him. Cas has taken the only thing Dean loves, and he may never forgive himself.
The next night, he has the same dream, so he calls up Naomi, and they talk for a long while. She tells him he probably misses the best friend Dean was to him, that it would be helpful for him to arrange a meeting for him and Dean to catch up, so he can further spread the truths he learned from clinic. He thanks her, hangs up, and thinks that perhaps he will call Dean, but he goes to bed night after night without ever following through on the thought.
It was slow after the ice cream. Dean was working through what happened, working through the anger inside of him, and Cas was working through the guilt. They started as friends, kept a careful distance between them at all times. If they were together, Emma was between them or a pillow or least three feet of space. It was
“Yeah, but we can still get out of here,” Dean says, wiggling his eyebrows suggestively. Lisa rolls her eyes, but stands to leave. “Hey, Sammy. We’re gonna take a drive. Call me when you get ready to go,” Dean tells Sam, shrugging into his jacket and receiving no response from his little brother. Dean rolls his eyes. “Sam Winchester wears make up.” Sam laughs at something Jessica says. “Sam Winchester cries his way through sex.” No response. “Sam Winchester keeps a ruler by his bed, and every morning when he wakes up he—”
“Jesus Christ,” Cas groans when Dean licks a stripe along the underside of his dick and stops to suck at the head. Dean hums in agreement, drawing another groan out of Cas. They discovered Dean’s little affinity for sucking cock a few days ago, and since then, that’s all Dean has wanted to do. Every time he and Cas are alone, he is on his knees. Every time he is alone, he is fantasizing about being on his knees with Cas. Dean thinks he might have a problem, but it’s just so fucking hot. Seeing Cas come apart with his cock down Dean's throat...it’s the biggest gratification Dean’s ever gotten. Dean likes knowing he’s making who he’s with happy, especially when it's Cas and he enjoys what he’s doing so much.
“Your brother must really love you,” Dean drawls, leaning close and running his hand over Cas’ chest. “I’m your slave for a whole 24 hours.” Dean presses a kiss to Cas’ jaw, to which Cas backs away uncomfortably.
Castiel says nothing…what is there to be said to that? It did feel good… It felt as good as sex with Dean, if not better. It felt honest. It felt like he wasn’t forced to hide because he was with another man. It also felt wrong. It felt like, despite everything, he still wants the big hands, the broad shoulders and the dick. It also felt dirty, and he, unlike Dorothy, comprehends enough to know that he was just raped.
She said they showed her that ‘sexual attractions are good for the body and soul.’” Charlie falls silent, lost in some memory. “They raped her, Cas,” she says eventually, voice soft and scared. “She stopped talking to me after I confronted her about the rape. She said it was consensual and that it meant a lot to her, but she couldn’t even tell me his name.”
"So how do you think they got there?" Judge Mills asks, and Dean fights his urge to blame Lydia. She's already making this whole thing hard, no need to give her a reason to.
The walk back to his own house is excruciating. If Dean thought every step hurt after Bela, then this is torture. It is snowing. Dean guesses this is the cold of their relationship, and God, does Dean feel it. It eats him alive until he can’t tell if his fingers or his soul is colder. He is so distracted that instead of climbing back into the window, he walks right through the front door.
It takes everything in Dean to jerk away from Cas, every ounce of strength in his frigid, brittle body, but it comes as enough of a surprise to Cas—who apparently
“Thanks guys,” Dean says with a soft smile. They mean well…he knows that, but he doesn’t want to have to put on a front for them too. He wants to go to the library, or maybe Bobby’s room, anywhere quiet will do, and beat himself up over what happened with Bela because he’s an asshole, and he deserves that shit. He wants to sit in silence until the silence devours him, swallows him whole like he was never there in the first place.
Cas really does take a few still-life’s, a few of the trees and some of the posts lining the trails, but his true masterpieces are of Dean. Dean skipping rocks across the shimmering lake, Dean tossing a stray Frisbee back to some kids, Dean chasing the ducks, Dean looking at Cas, Dean, Dean, Dean. Cas is a wee bit smitten…
“Accomplished step six, I see,” she says, closing the folders and threading her hands over the top of them. She offers him a smile that, to an outsider, would look sinister and scheming. To him, it just looks supportive.
“Bobby,” Dean forces down his food half-chewed and starts, cutting him off with his face hot beyond compare and lips sticky with syrup. “You don’t have to…please.”
“I’m—I’m not,” he stutters finally, and he doesn’t mean that he doesn’t like boys, he just means he likes girls too.
“Don’t,” he whispers, but it’s sharp in the otherwise silence of the car. “Just…just don’t, alright? Please.”
“No further questions, your honor," he says before turning on his heel and heading back for his seat with Dean following closely behind. When they get seated, Judge Mills looks at the brothers, obviously considering carefully.
“I know you are, Sammy,” Dean says softly, chewing on his lip before continuing. “But listen, you’re my kid brother, and I’ll do whatever you need to help. I’ll stand guard by your door at night if you want. I’ll go to all your parties and act super lame so no one even notices how lame
“No, it’s just an essay,” Bobby says, reaching for the papers, but it’s too late. Dean has found the cover page, and he has found the name scrawled across the top.
“No,” Dean says, taking her hand off his face and stepping back because really, it's a no-brainer. Ask him Lisa or Cas, and it'll be Cas every single time.
“She’s his too,” he says, not wanting to hear her try to make it better because she can’t. The only thing that could make it better is sleeping in his arms.
“No,” Dean says finally, taking the keys back from Sam. “Dad gave them to me for my birthday right before he said he wants us to come over and meet his new fiancé.” Sam reacts much in the same way Dean did. His eyes get extremely excited about the car, then his whole world shatters at the word fiancé.
When the old library comes into view, Mary smiles, eyes teary. Jess meets her at the door, her long hair more gray than golden these days, her eyes now shining with life and loss. She embraces Mary, combing back her hair with practiced fingers. Mary begins to cry. Jess holds her close, biting back tears of her own enough to speak.
“Wait,” he gasps, pulling away and catching Cas’ wrists. Dean looks Cas dead in the eye when he speaks. “I want to go bare back.” Cas’ breath hitches in his throat.
too much of your sex life as it is and I want to see and hear even less of it with Cas." He shudders, and Dean grins, finding ever the pleasure in making Sam uncomfortable. "Okay, my question is, why Lisa if you’re with Cas?” Sam asks finally, and Dean’s playful banter deflates.
“You stupid boy!” he shouts, holding Dean up by his wrist, the rest of his body hanging limp like some rag doll, too frozen to stand. “Damned kid,” he spits, throwing Dean to the side, away from the glass. “You ruin everything you touch!” Now, Dean begins to cry, but they are silent tears, tears so his dad doesn’t hear.
“It’s cool with me if it’s cool with her parents,” he says, taking Lisa’s hand into his with an absent smile in her direction.
“Gotta put baby brother through school somehow… I got my GED instead of a diploma, and college is something I can’t afford without a job. I figure there’s a few things that can earn quick money for a face like this.” Dean is trying to joke, Cas knows, but it falls flat. Cas doesn’t say anything in hopes that Dean will continue, and he doesn’t disappoint. “I used to love it. All the sex I could ever ask for, never any strings attached,
“Hey, Dean,” Sam says, meeting his brother halfway for the bone-crushing hug he knows is coming for him.
“Get the fuck out,” he hisses, glaring straight at Cas. Cas, sitting on the arm of the chair Dean is hunched over in, reels back a little. “You heard me!” he barks, but Cas’ eyes just widen.
“See that window over there?” Cas asks, hanging upside down from the tree in his front yard, an arm stretched out as he points. Dean sits in the grass at the trunk, staring up at Cas. “That’s my room. I have an aquarium. Would you like to see?”
“I love you,” Cas murmurs, a smile ghosting across his lips as he looks at his boyfriend, milk dripping down his chin and hair askew from Cas' hands. Dean slurps and swallows.
Dean breathes out a slow breath and tries to get used to the feeling of someone else holding him together.
“I pulled some favors with my friends at the library.” Cas is smiling fondly at Dean. Some favors, in reality, had been Cas bribing the librarians onto letting him in after closing hours and upon succeeding, spending weeks searching through multiple newspapers' new born archives. He would do it again too, if it meant seeing Dean as happy as he looks right now.
“How do I look at him?” Dean asks after a long moment. He isn’t sure if he really wants to hear the answer. Sam replies anyway, speaking through the hesitation in Dean’s eyes.
music when they were together. “That’s all for today, Castiel. Go by the front desk to get your vitamins and get some rest. I’ll see you tomorrow for stage one group at nine o’clock.” She looks down to her clipboard without sparing another glance at Castiel. Cas makes his way out of her office feeling dazed.
“I said five more minutes, bitch,” Dean growls, but there’s no real malice in his voice. Sam’s not the one he’s angry with. It’s God. Even so, Sam calls him a jerk and lets him lie there in bed for five more minutes before he comes back in and wakes him. “Fine,” Dean moans and sits up in bed, rubbing the sleep from his eyes before standing and getting dressed. He meets Sam downstairs a few moments later with his boots tied and his veins in desperate need of the song of coffee. “Let me get some caffeine and we’ll go,” Dean promises, reaching for the pot and a mug.
“That’s my girl,” Dean praises, giving her tummy a soft squeeze. A knock sounds at the door, and Sam pokes his head in, to which Emma squeals.
“I will be soon,” he murmurs and takes that first leap of a step with Gabriel close at his heels. After closing the distance between him and the door, Cas must take a deep breath before he can knock, but when he does, blood begins to ring in Cas’ ears. When steps begin to sound from the other side, his whole world stops.
The sun is just about to set, and the children are elsewhere and self-content for the moment. Just as Anna is about to breathe a sigh of relief, the door to her borrowed and shared room flies open. She stops the groan slipping between her lips when she sees that it isn’t sticky little hands coming for her but instead, her mother’s satiny and demanding hands. They are pulling the suitcase out from beneath the bed, throwing their things in angrily.
never like the rest, who cares? They’re probably all would-you-like-tea-with-your-crumpets, lame asses anyway!
“I want to kiss you,” Dean says, referring to the absolute control it took to keep from leaning over and kissing him right then and there.
drinker as well as an admitted victim of past abuse, putting a small child in his care would be irresponsible. No, it would be downright deplorable." Judge Mills rolls her eyes.
“Forever,” she croons excitedly, falling back and relying on Sam to catch her. He does. Of course he does.
“We’re leaving,” Dean says, and it isn’t an invitation to argue. It is simply a fact. He tries to step past her, but she rises and stands before him. She is a small woman, several inches shorter, rather petite, and really much too young for John now that Dean sees her up close.
“Oh dearie,” she said gently as she lifted Cas’ head slightly, wincing at his accompanying gasp of pain. “Don’t worry, I’m going to do everything I can. This curse is nothing to sneeze at, and being that you’re an angel it’s got to be so much worse.”
The brothers both spat dirt, blood and broken teeth as they lifted each other off the ground once more. They smiled through the incredible pain. Chuck had given them the ability to withstand this, he’d trapped them in hell and broken them over and over, he shouldn’t have been so surprised they wouldn’t stay down.
“Hey guys.” Sam said as calmly as possible, trying not to make them jump. It was futile though, they both jumped apart like the other was made of fire. Cas shrieked and Dean almost panicked in his effort to get the angel back into place. When Cas was back in his arms Sam was surprised to see Dean kiss the top of his head a few times and cup Cas’ face.
Dean knew everyone was aware of his suffering, despite him trying to cover it as best he could. When he entered a room people would get quiet, they’d give him looks full of meaning and unspoken comfort. Jody couldn’t go longer then a few minutes without grabbing his hand and squeezing, Donna couldn’t stop tearing up when she saw him, Bobby kept giving him manful pats on the back. Claire was the worst though, the one that hurt his soul to see. She’d just give him a watery half smile and turn away, she knew exactly how he felt.
A fresh torrent of tears trailed down his face as he rocked in agony once again. He played it over and over in his head, every word, every facial expression, every breath. They where forever burned into his soul, he’d remember that moment in excruciating detail every second of every day.
“Are you fucking with me?” Dean asked, jumping off the couch again. As he did Cas screamed again and almost bit through his tongue in sudden pain. Dean immediately grabbed Cas in confusion, then stared at his brother with wide eyes that would have made Sam laugh hysterically if not for his best friend being so hurt.
“Not much.” Sam sighed, “I’m sorry, I’m looking I swear. Everything I’m finding says it just has to wear off or be broken, but nothing is saying how it can be broken! I texted Rowena and she said she’d have to examine Cas to know exactly what spell was used. I thought I’d ask first since... well she’d have to see you like this.”
The reunion went on for hours. Family and friends heard the word that their angel was back and poured into the bunker like a river. Every few minutes the bunker door would slam open and feet could be heard rushing down the spiral stairs, and voices would be raised in jubilation.
“Sammy,” he said. “If the situation where reversed I’d say the same thing to you. And if the situation where reversed you’d still do the same thing I’m about to do. Don’t worry Sammy, I’m going to find him, and I’m going to bring him back. Then I’m taking him to the fucking beach like I promised all those years ago. You and Eileen can come too.”
“Hate to break up this beautiful reunion, especially before it earns itself an R rating, but we need to get moving.”
“It’s getting worse the longer it goes on.” Cas said stoically as he could while trying not to scream. “When you guys helped me in it didn’t hurt so bad.”
“You deserved him, Dean.” Charlie said gently as Dean put his head on the table miserably. She rubbed his neck in commiseration and affection as he let his emotions out. “You deserved a happy ending with him. You still do.”
Cas chuckled from his nest in Deans chest and Sam realized it was pretty funny. He’d do it too, if he could save Gabe.
Dean maneuvered himself and Cas on the couch until the angel was curled up practically on his lap. Cas was shaking and gasping, it broke Dean’s heart to hear it. Cas was mumbling something over and over, but through gritted teeth it was hard to understand him. Slowly Dean felt Cas relax by degrees until his jaws unclenched.
For Dean it wasn’t even a choice, he’d do anything to save Cas, he’d proven that already. Out of all the things he’d already done to save the angel, all the choices he’d had to make for his safety, this one was the easiest. It didn’t involve sacrificing others, unleashing otherworldly beings on the earth, or traversing through a hellscape for a year, so it was no big deal. All he had to do was hug his best friend, who, to be perfectly frank, needed a damn hug anyway. And, if Dean was going to continue to be perfectly frank, he didn’t mind it at all.
Within second they where both writhing and grunting, their cocks twitching and their bodies  bucking as they came into each others hands.
“So there’s something going on in the Akron area, it looks like one of dads unsolved cases, should be check it out?”
“Figures.” Crowley said as he dusted nonexistent dirt off his suit. “How are we going to find the clod?”
“There you go, squirrel.” He said smoothly, “mother made it so that once you found me it would start locating the angel.”
“I had left my mark on you by then.” Cas explained. “Even if you didn’t remember our battle out of hell, your soul remembered.”
Dean had always hated the afterglow. That stupid moment in time after cumming where you felt like everything was just perfect and wonderful with the world. Whether he was with a partner or by himself he’d never wanted to enjoy that moment of pure good feeling that others insisted sex was all about. It made him feel vulnerable. The world wasn’t a place where you could feel that happy and content and not have it ripped away from you at any second. This time though Dean let himself feel that fully as he and Cas laid in each other’s arms, panting, kissing and just touching. It wasn’t so bad, in fact he kind of saw everyone’s point about it.
That was how he’d imagined this night going. Doing it doggy-style with a shifter sex worker wearing Cas’ face. The guilt. The shame.
Fifteen days without Dean, and Cas has Naomi convinced that he truly believes being gay is wrong. Fifteen days without Dean, and Cas has her convinced that he believes God can "fix him", that he has given his life over to Him, effectively conquering step two and three. He is well on his way to completing his "searching and fearless moral inventory of himself," step four. He hates every goddamn minute of it for the doubt it plants in him, but he spends the night unloading it onto Charlie, and Charlie groans right back, telling him about how angry Naomi got in group that day, or about how gray Gilda’s eyes look when it rains.
The years pass just like that. Dean splits his time between his house and Cas’, laughing and crying and telling everything to Cas, watching out for Sammy. Twelve years later finds them much in the same place. A few differences, of course. Dean’s hair is darker, leveling out at a light brown, sandy blonde if you squint. Cas’ hair is darkest, coming in at a shocking coal, chocolate brown in just the right light. Anna turned out hot, thin and curved and porcelain. Sam turned out tall, what he lacks in muscle made up for in his ever growing height. Cas turned out gay, trusting only Dean with the fact. Dean is in the drama club, but none of that matters. The only thing that matters is the silence falling around them.
“Beers,” he agrees, grinning at Cas like nothing changed.  As they each leave the store empty handed, Dean offers a quick heads-up to the manager. “Clean up on aisle six,” he says, and Cas stares. “What?” he asks, a barely-there smile gracing his lips. Cas has missed the sight of that.
“Damn it,” Dean hisses under his breath. She had likely fallen asleep on the couch again, and he woke her up in his escape. “Sorry, Lyd,” he says, bending to kiss her forehead. “Sammy called, needs me to come get him.” The lie rolls off his tongue easily. She settles back into the cushions, and he is gone, out the door before he can change his mind.
“I have two daddies!” She tells Jess excitedly, practically bouncing in Cas’ lap. “Did you know that?”
“No, I just…why?” and Cas falls silent. “Come on, Cas. You solicited my brother into letting you catch a ride with him all the way to Seattle. The least you can do is tell me why,” Dean teases, pushes with a smile. He does not know what he is asking of Cas.
“Yes, that’s me,” Cas says as though him stepping forward when his name was called wasn’t obvious enough. The man’s nametag reads, “Garth,” but by the time Cas’ eyes have flicked back up to the man’s, he’s introducing himself.
“Wouldn’t have it any other way,” he tells her, and she snorts, releasing him. Bobby steps forward and pushes his hands into his pants pockets.
The fire burns the house to the ground. It leaves nothing but char and ash and the tiny lockbox that has the boys’ birth certificates in it. It doesn’t even leave a body for the widowed father and his two boys to bury. It takes everything from them, including their mother, and from that point on, Dean doesn’t see a point in learning his letters or his colors or his numbers.
“Don’t go away angry,” Gabe says sweetly, a dark look on his face. “Just go away.” Cas scoffs in frustration and slams the door on his way out.
“What do I want?” John asks, stepping closer and raising his arms. Dean flinches involuntarily, but if John sees, he doesn’t comment. “I want to tell my son happy birthday. It’s been too long, Dean.” John moves forward again and wraps his arms around Dean, squeezing harder and harder to the point of pain until Dean hugs him back. “I’m proud of you, boy,” John says, and Dean does not know what to do. His entire existence warms at the words of praise coming from between his father’s lips.
It took the rest of the morning to finish replacing the bulbs and loading up the tools from Edith’s house. She asked him what time his service might be on Sunday. Apparently St. Michael’s had Mass at seven and 11:30 in the morning, so she promised to come if it were possible as she hadn’t missed one in forty-three years, even when she was in labor.
A new wave of sobs overtook Dean, but Sam saw the difference in them. These where tears of grief and sadness, yes, but also relief and healing. He didn’t know what Jack was talking about, he didn’t know if he’d ever be told the truth of what happened in this room, of his best friends demise, but he knew a sacrifice had been made.
Hours later they still lay in bed together in the soft light the lamp shed. They hadn’t talked much more in that time, they’d just enjoyed the miracle of being together again. Deans stomach broke the love spell by grumbling angrily.
He wondered why he’d chosen to fight them in the first place, knowing as he did, that he’d created them to finish him. He could have avoided this a million different ways, he could have stopped at any time, but he wanted it to END.
He and Jack rounded the doorway and found Dean curled into a ball on the floor, a bloody handprint like a billboard on his shoulder. Sam rushed to him, pulling Deans hands away from his face desperately trying to make sure he was okay. Dean fought him, clutching his hair, tearing his nails into his skin, refusing to look at Sam.
“Mine.” Dean crooned, grasping Cas to him and running his hands on ever inch of skin he could reach.
Sam started the final step of the spell, Charlie chanting along with him, lending some of her strength to his. He felt the pull as a dark, oozing hole opened in the wall. His powers had been enough, it had worked.
Dean shook his head, he didn’t think he’d ever be able to wrap his head around the fact his kid was now god. Cas’ kid. He smiled at that, if anyone could raise god to be good it was Cas.
Dean stormed in seconds later with a look of fierce determination on his face. He looked at Sam and that face crumpled a bit as he tried to find the words to say.
Sam helped as much as he could as his brother moved Cas and himself upright. Cas went pale and bit his lip to hold back a scream, but nodded to Dean to keep going. Sam took hold of Cas’ hand as they walked towards the bedroom and rubbed it between his own. Again, additional affection couldn’t hurt. He felt Cas’ grip tighten in gratitude.
Cas actually blushed in response, which made Deans stomach drop to his feet. This wasn’t any better, he was still sickeningly, crazily in love with this angel. He forced himself to look away from Cas and concentrate on Crowley.
“Oh, Cas!” Dean exhaled, pushing himself against him. His dick was so hard it felt painful, the friction he felt as he pumped himself against Cas was like heaven.
Cas snapped fully awake at that touch. He could feel Deans hand against his shoulder, scorching him, branding him. He gasped in shock at the sight. Dean, he was here.
“It’s the first thing I tried.” Jack said, tears already welling at his failure. “After putting everything Chuck did to right, I tried to save you. I couldn’t reach into the empty no matter how hard I tried. All I could do was put my faith in Sam and Dean to rescue you. I knew it was well placed.”
“It’s okay,” Dean soothed gently. “It’s going to be okay sweetheart, I promise. I’m going to figure out how to break this curse. I won’t let this hurt you anymore, my angel. You’re too important to me, do you understand that? Can you possibly understand how important you are to me? How much I need you with me?”
“What?!” Sam sputtered, “how? Dean you said it yourself a million times, we don’t retire. You said it’s the only thing you could ever do.”
Dean didn’t let him finish his questions. Instead he took Cas’ face in his hands, running his fingers along his jawline, over his cheekbones, and finally across his lips. He seemed to be memorizing every plane of Cas’ face with the intensity of his stare.
“Well, at least I know you have a competent hunting partner to keep you alive.” Dean laughed before sobering suddenly. “Don’t you dare get hurt though. Don’t you dare die before we get to enjoy this shit.”
Dean rolled on top of the angels prone body, Cas legs wrapped around him instinctively as their bodies slotted together perfectly.
Cas watched as Dean fell into a deep slumber almost immediately. How could anyone sleep so shortly after a panic attack? With the help of an angel, of course. He didn’t feel guilty for using the very small amount of grace he had left to let the love of his existence sleep peacefully. For Dean he would willingly use every ounce of grace he ever had, stolen or been gifted, no questions asked.
“When?” Dean asked lazily. “When did you fall Cas? I’ve been wondering who actually loved who first here.”
Dean couldn’t stop himself, would never stop himself again, from cupping the angels face in his hand and pulling him forward. Their lips met and Dean could swear sparks flew, just like the night they’d first met. Cas’ lips parted slightly and Dean dove into the kiss further. His tongue drove into the angels mouth and he heard a desperate, hungry cry escape his throat. Cas tasted of thunder and the ocean, his new favorite taste.
“Me too.” Sam said honestly. “Those two, I can’t think of anyone else with a bond like they have. It’s like the one can’t breath without the other, they don’t know how to exist apart.”
They barreled towards the fissure, and didn’t hesitate to jump through it when they reached it. The three of them suddenly crashed through the blackness and into the searing light of the bunker, toppling over each other as it closed behind them. Dean heard two voices yelp in happiness and smiled, Sam and Charlie hadn’t given up on them.
Dean nodded, no arguing that. Sam walked out giving Cas a quick hug before he went, additional affection couldn’t hurt.
“Well,” Crowley drawled as he picked himself off the floor and studied the heap of bodies at his feet, “nice to see you too.”
Taking a deep breath he calmed himself. If anyone could hear him, actually listen to him, it was Charlie. He was tired of keeping it in and ashamed of how he’d let himself be silenced about Cas’ sacrifice. He could trust Charlie, he would. In a rambling soliloquy he told her the whole tale. When he was finished he continued, he told her how he felt. The pain, the anger, the grief, the regret. He never got to say it back, he never got to tell Cas how much he’d loved him too. Everything came pouring out of him and once he started he couldn’t stop. The dam had burst, he’d never be able to plug it up again.
“I’m not sure.” Cas gasped, pain flooding back. “It’s just been getting worse since we left our last hunt.”
Safe. Dean heard the high pitched whine escaping from the back of his throat as he tried to breath normally again. He could almost hear Sam talking him through his panic attack, “four beats in, hold it four, four beats out.” This wasn’t new to Dean, he’d had a few in his lifetime, he just didn’t think kissing Cas would trigger one. That thought alone was enough to make Dean laugh at the absurdity of it all.
“Why me?” Dean asked, not really caring at this point as long as Cas stopped whimpering in pain. He’d do whatever it took, cuddling Cas wasn’t going to fucking kill him.
“I fucking hate witches!” Dean growled, “Sammy, what’d they do to him? They’re dead, shouldn’t their spells be gone anyway? And he’s a damned angel!”
“He left me,” Dean finished in tears. “He left me again, Charlie. This time is so much worse because now I know, I can’t lie to myself anymore. He did love me, the same way I loved him. I always told myself it wasn’t possible, that angels can’t feel that way, especially for someone like me.”
“What are you doing here?” Cas growled, not truly angry. He had missed the king of hell, in a weird and uncomfortable way Crowley had understood him on a level no other ever had.
With that his angel slowly and gently took of his coat and boots. He unbuttoned his flannel shirt, something Dean had looked forward to for god knows how long, and covered him in layers of sheets and blankets before tucking him in like a child.
“No need to apologize Jack.” Cas said, holding up a hand in warding. “I know you would have saved me if you could have.”
His head bobbed up and down while Cas writhed helplessly on the bed beneath him. Dean very much enjoyed this, he’d always gotten a big kick out of making his partners go crazy, doing it to Cas was far, far better then he’d ever expected. His own cock was painfully swollen and leaking precum everywhere, he’d soaked the sheets beneath him already. If he wasn’t careful he’d come without ever having Cas touch him. He could feel Cas building toward the inevitable and backed off again, crawling up the bed to lay beside him.
Sam had no doubt whatsoever that Cas felt the same towards Dean. Cas would do anything for him, and gladly. Angels weren’t supposed to feel, but Cas had an amazing capacity for emotion that was growing every day. All of that was due to Dean, and the love Cas felt for him. Idiots.
Dean tore his eyes away from Cas reluctantly to look at his watch. He inhaled sharply when he saw they had less then 8 hours left. He felt like he’d just found Crowley an hour ago, Cas a few minutes max. The time that had drug on endlessly was now rushing by at warped speed.
Dean snuck one more look at his watch and sighed with relief when he saw his panic was slowing time down again. He refused to look at Cas, seeing him might speed the clock up again. Every once in awhile Dean would feel Cas touch his back and get a jolt of energy, his angel was using his grace to keep Dean sprinting.
Cas turned to see them and exclaimed in happiness. As he embraced Claire, Dean saw that she no longer tensed up at his touch, instead she returned the hug with enthusiasm. She had finally forgiven Cas for everything he’d done.
Dean then leaned in slowly, so slowly he could feel his heart hammering the same frantic rythem as Cas’ against his chest, until their lips met.
Crowley lifted his eyebrows in suspicion at deans words. Then his face smoothed out and he handed the hexbag back to Dean.
“Okay then. She’ll be here as soon as possible. In the meantime I’m going to keep looking. You guys need anything?”
“Haha, maybe.” Sam answered, “but not really. Dean and I are close, no question, but either of us could survive without the other if we had no other choice. We’ve both made that choice before, not that it worked out, but we have. Ever since Dean met Cas though, its different. We’ve lost Cas before, and every single time it’s like I’ve lost Dean too. He doesn’t just grieve him and move on, part of him dies too. Every time it’s been like living with a zombie. One who drinks and blacks out and screams in his sleep.”
“Yeah, yeah.” Dean said, rolling over to find his clothes. “And angels should probably get up too. We have guest, in case you’d forgotten, and they’re all probably wondering where the hell we are right now.”
“I know.” Cas said sadly, running his hand down Deans side. “And I’m sorry. I didn’t think you’d ever feel those thing. I don’t regret what I did, I would never regret saving you, but I don’t know if I would have had the strength to do it knowing how much pain it would cause you.”
Suddenly Deans lips where pressed against his own. Deans hands where on his skin, his body pressed against his own as much as possible in their awkward position on the ground. Cas had thought he knew was happiness was, but everything paled in comparison to this feeling.
Dean nodded sadly, another sob hitching in his chest as he stared at Jack. Jack managed to smile beatifically through his tears.
Cas eyes dilated at Dean’s words and his breath caught in his throat. Dean cupped his face in his hand and brought is own down, resting his forehead against Cas’ and looking him in the eye.
“Great!” She said enthusiastically. “He’ll be here in a minute, he said he had to grab something first.”
The locator spell twirled the hexbag as if it where drowsing for water. The spinning increased as Dean kept walking. The faster it spun the faster Dean went, until eventually he was sprinting. He saw a body in the distance and almost groaned in anticipation. This was him, he’d found Cas with plenty of time to spare.
“Talk go well?” He asked curiously. He’d been worried about it. Dean wouldn’t tell Sam what had happened that horrible night, Sam thought he might be willing to tell Charlie though.
Sam knocked the next morning before opening the door to check on Cas and Dean. He waited a few minutes and knocked a little louder.
“We’re aware!” Dean shouted as he ran. “Now would be the time to pull another rabbit out of your hat if you got one!”
“Because,” Rowena said calmly. “At least he has you, here, willing to do whatever it takes. Not many would have that, not many have the person closest to their hearts at their beck and call. That’s why this curse is so serious.”
Dean laid his hand on the whimpering angels back and felt Cas immediately relax. He still shivered under Deans palm in pain but it didn’t seem to be quiet as overwhelming as before.
Being alone had become Deans favorite thing, as long as alone included Cas. He met Cas’ azure eyes across the miniature table strewn with umbrella laden drinks and smiled.
“Sam, what do we do?” Dean asked, not taking his eyes off Cas. As they watched the angel curled himself into a ball on the couch and covered his head with his arms. Dean couldn’t take it anymore and went to the couch and the fallen angel and rubbed his back consolingly.
That voice, more then any other, shocked Cas out of the best moment of his existence and back into reality. Crowley.
Charlie looked at the ceiling with tears in her eyes. Sam wiped his own face covertly. This time really had been terrifying. Deans grief was invisible to him, he thought he did such a great job covering it up but in reality his misery was so strong it affected everyone he encountered. Sam feared every time he left the bunker what he’d return to. Empty liquor bottles, vomit, broken glass, Dean unconscious, or worse, awake and ranting. His worse fear was that he’d find his brother dead, he didn’t think Dean would die by suicide but as a hunter it would be easy to get killed on the job if you stopped being careful. Dean was also getting older and while the god-luck had kept him healthy despite his binge drinking and diet it wouldn’t last forever. Sam hadn’t had high hopes that Dean would live another year without Cas, he just didn’t know how.
Dean mumbled in his sleep and turned over roughly. Cas reached out to him quickly, checking that he still slept and hadn’t woken himself with the movement. He chuckled at his own anxiety, Dean had often complained over the years at Cas standing over him while he slept. If only the hunter knew Cas did this almost every night he could. Sleep was the only time he could see Dean truly relax, unless he had nightmares, which he did often.
“I prefer pie,” he winked at her, cause old ladies loved a flirty good-looking man, then eyed the space around her.
Dean nodded in some appreciation. He could use a strong pair of arms to help out, someone who might have an idea what each tool was. “I am, but definitely done for the night. Give me your number and I’ll call next time I’m here in the evening.”
“Sam?” Cas dropped his hands, which had found their way to his waist at some point, and took a step back. He looked so damn puzzled.
Yes, there would be prizes and chips. No it wasn’t technically against the law, the buy-in would be at the door and they’d be entered into a raffle. Fifteen dollars for the chips, and they’d be entered into the raffle no matter what.
“Should I start from my very first sin? I think I stole bubblegum from the corner store and got my ass beat raw.” He chuckled darkly. Then a soft tapping sound on the lattice startled Castiel. “Can you see me through here, Cas?”
Castiel felt his hand being lowered. He did nothing as his wet palm stroked the rough folds of jeans, the zipper scraping lightly between his fingers. It felt nearly as hot as inside Dean’s mouth, but this, this made Dean groan.
“Of course I do,” Dean said easily, stuffing his dirty clothes in his bag and checking to see if he’d have to do laundry before he left. He was a dab hand at packing to travel, given their upbringing. He’d been responsible for Sammy and his stuff once he was tall enough to pack on a motel bed.
Then he placed Castiel’s hand back on the wood ledge of the barrier and stopped touching him altogether.
Dean felt rather satisfied with the idea, if not the having to wait. Saturday was four days away, but he’d been on longer cases. Maybe he could be out before it was time for him to miserably fail on Sunday.
Dean would’ve stuck his tongue out at Sam with food, but it was so full he was sure to lose some. And he wasn’t going to waste one crumb.
An embarrassed twitch showed at the corner of Castiel’s mouth, the first sign he understood innuendos. Admittedly, the innocence was kinda appealing.
Dean didn’t think he could talk, let alone tell anyone to call an ambulance. He drank down half the water which, if his father’s words were true, just spread around the heat. “Charlie,” he gasped, leaning over to reach for her before she left to get another sample of lava. “Bring me a beer.”
“You are marriage material, no lie.” Dean nudged Sam under the table. His little brother definitely needed someone around who wouldn't balk at getting a dab of grease on his skin.
like homework. Dean took a big spoonful and hoped there was enough contestants to fill him up if this was all he got. Upon his lips closing around the handle, the roof of his mouth objected strenuously to the burning heat. It wasn’t terrible, but it wasn’t
Despite the fact this reminded him of a porno he watched once, he held out two flyers. “I’ll take a raincheck on that drink. However, I am going to be a judge at the cook-off and would love to take a taste of your...chili.”
He did go back to fit the pipes in the sink and determined, with a certain sinking feeling, that if the harder-to-reach pipes would need to be replaced as well. That was not a small project, none of this was.
Dean pulled his focus from the other man to roll his eyes upward. “I’m fine. I’ve hit my head plenty of times.” Or had it hit for him. The vibration was lessening somewhat though. “Umm.. about a moment ago.”
Once the priest reached the bottom of the stairs it was clear this certainly wasn’t the same Father. He was older and black. Not much older, but pushing forties at the very least. The priest had a tired air to him, dull features and hair cropped so close it could have been shaved no less than several weeks ago. “Hello.”
“Dean.” He shook her hand, then Charles. “I met him in the middle of the semester and we really hit it off. I…” He had to girdle his loins here, or whatever the saying was. “I’m moving out here so I can be near him while he gets his PhD.”
“Liquor?! Oh my God. Sorry God.” She looked upward and then back at him. “Why do we have all that? You can’t drink all of it.”
He lugged his beat up laptop into the first place likely to have wifi, a Patt's Burgers, with hot fries and a spotty connection. He checked out the emails detailing it his name, Dean Paxton, brief history, and the details of the case.
Sam snorted, a hand passing over his mouth. “What? Did you seriously just say guys only want one thing? We’re
He knew she didn’t mean that, but there was something to be said about accidental teasing… He bit his lip, the memory of large fingers curled on his collarbone rising up. No, concentrate. Think of soft boobs and plump asses. Girl asses, not ones clad in jeans belonging to blue-eyed guys that belonged to someone else.
He did a lot of touching last night and he wasn’t proud of it. That was the only reason he didn’t even mention Sam leaving abruptly. Yeah, Sam sent him a couple of puzzled looks, but didn’t comment on it either.
“What. the. fuck.” He growled at the sight of the table with only one occupant. “Tell me he went to the bathroom or something.”
Then the lights above exploded, literally exploded, sending a shower of sparks down as the door opened.
She smiled and nodded, so trusting. “I get that, I do. Hey, let me take you out for dinner. It’ll help you with your feeling, ha ha.”
He waited a moment as they looked at the yard on the corner, obviously having some idea of who he’s talking about. “Okay, dismissed!”
He leaned forward, elbows balanced on his knees. “If I may ask, do you feel sorry for doing that?” Castiel tried to word it delicately, using his most neutral tone.
He reminded himself several times of the categories because Crowley frowned at him when he saw him peeking. Color, Aroma, Consistency, Taste, Aftertaste. He took a quick gulp of water and hurried through the answers. ‘Dull 5. Good 7. Meaty 6. Hot 5. Lots 8. Total 31’.
All the anger and frustration and confusion rushed through him, finding a prime target. This was entirely her fault.
That still meant Dean was liplocking with someone Sam had already established a claim over. That still made Dean a pretty shitty big brother. Sex-tousled hair and a shiver-inducing voice should not have had any impact on the immutable, irrefutable rule that one didn’t steal another guy’s...guy.
Now he doesn’t necessarily enjoy the tour or hearing all about the place’s history, but he listens for his brother’s sake. He’s completely turned around and the sun is beating down like the fiery hand of God. “Isn’t there a place to grab a drink?”
Dean looked at Sam...who was staring at his phone. He kicked him, frowning at his brother once they locked eyes. Dean flitted his eyes toward Cas pointedly.
“So why aren’t you staying with Castiel?” Sam watched Dean plop down his black duffel bag next to the empty bed.
“What are we toasting to?” Cas asked, a crinkle appearing between his eyes as if it was a foreign concept.
“I’m going to split you apart, angel. You can call me God, if you want.” Bitter disgust coated his soul even as he spoke so lewdly, because he was so goddamn
“Drama queen.” Donnie left the back room as well to hang out in the party scene. Fine. Dean wanted to be alone anyway. Alone with his two beers, his silent phone, and his last scraps of dignity.
“Fuck, Cas,” he mumbled as he wrapped his fingers his bare skin. Yeah it was a good thing, a very good thing. Pre-cum was already leaking over his fingers, making everything hot and slick as he loosely pumped with one hand.
In response his touch took another route, sliding down the whole skin of Castiel’s stomach, pushing away the sopping remains of the shirt that slapped wetly against his hands.
“No.” Despite his words, Cas was getting slick and loose. “I can see you, to the soul. I’m not saying no, because it’s you.”
Heartbeat pounding in his ears, he froze like a trapped animal. He was very afraid the call of his faith wasn’t as strong as the call of this man.
The sudden shock of seeing a taut expense of stomach, tan with a dusting of dark hair, rendered him speechless. Good god it was hot in here, he hadn’t realized he was kinda short of breath till now.
Roland extended his hand first. “It was great meeting you, Dean. Samuel talks about you all the time.”
“Nope, no.” Dean was doubly mad he colored up like a schoolgirl. Couldn’t he even glance at a guy without getting accused of scamming on him? He most certainly did not look like a guy who needed to be setup, he could get his own dates damnit.
Dean decides that the best way to handle everything is to stop thinking about it. This does not work.
“Well, I guess, but maybe I should do it. The Father can come off a little scary at first.” She was clearly not on board with the idea at all. He didn’t think Charlie was so easily intimidated if she thought Cas was intimidating. Maybe it was just the position of being a priest.
“That was amazing!” Sam gushed, almost giving him a hug but pausing at the wet shirt and his odd stance. “Did you hurt your arm?”
“Have you talked to Sam yet?” Benny asked as they were setting up behind a curtain. The other guy was peeking out into the rest of the venue.
Dean’s gaze travelled to the round collar around the man’s neck with its white band. Oh. Oh. He felt frozen in place, between a wizened senior behind him and the frankly gorgeous man in front of him.
He chuckled, she'd gotten snarky hadn't she? And look at that, he always thought she hated his music. Maybe she started to appreciate it after all. Or him?
“Yeah, I like him fine.” He gave Dean another odd look and held up his phone again. “If you want me to, I will.”
Bradford raised his eyebrows as Dean entered the store with a stack of yellow flyers. She had done a good job on short notice, it had a central park location, she assured him, and pertinent details such as face painting and other kid activities.
His voice was deeper than Dean would have guessed, great for a bass singer. It practically travelled to his bones, the same way a really good beat did. Dean blinked at him.
Thank you for prodding at me to continue! My summer has just come to an end, so I'll have more time! Well... I'll make more time anyway. Enjoy!
Dean grinned for the rest of the day. He didn’t have a computer and while he appreciated Friendster because it led to him meeting Cas, it seemed pretty lame.
Clearly dude thought he’d get to have Sam all to himself. Dean had pity on the poor guy, he just had this look about him. “Take a seat. Don’t mind him, he’s just overprotective. If he didn’t like you, he wouldn’t have invited you.”
“No, we do use personal names in conjunction with the title. However, friends may be even more informal and drop the title altogether.”
They both watched her hug her boys and trip while placing her bowls in a box. One cracked right down the middle.
“No, it’s a community event,” Dean said quickly. “No affiliations necessary to show up. That sounds great, have your grandfather bring whatever he’s willing to offer as samples and handouts. Does he know anyone with a microbrewery?”
Dean bet there were a lot of females of many ages in the pulpit that weren't thinking of God when they looked at him. “I’ll grab a voltage tester and then pick up more light bulbs for you.” He finally looked back at Edith, flashing her one of his best smiles. If part of the other church’s popularity was their incredibly good-looking priest, well, Dean was good looking too. He knew it, it was part of the reason he was so good at his job.
Dean jumped up and grabbed some clothes to get showered. Normally a night after the show was a scene of, if nothing else, empty bottles and some sign of chaos. Everything was pin neat in Sam’s room.
Dean woke up with a sore neck and fully clothed, still on the couch. Around him were tissues stuffed in the empty bowl and a number of empty bottles that clanked when he stood up. He stretched for a good long minute, buckled his jeans, and went to the bathroom to get cleaned up and changed.
As he went to shove his hands in his pockets, it hit something heavy and smooth. Oh, the pilfered bottle. Pulling it out, Dean twisted off the top and offered it to his left side without thinking.
So denial was the order of the day. He just had to get to the last gig under his belt - phrasing! - and he’d head back to Lebanon and leave Sam to it. No more help, that was for sure. Dean was just going to get as plastered as possible like he had originally planned and keep reminding himself Sam was better off without his screwed up, boundary crossing brother.
Dean nods at Sam and four of his frat buddies as they take a seat, winks at a table with five college age girls. There a couple of familiar faces he’s seen at shows before, that was cool.
But the third time Dean mumbled out a ‘mm hmm’ in response to Sam going on and on about his classes or charity or something, he cleared his throat. “Look, Dean…”
Benny lifted up both his hands. “No judgment here. What happens behind closed doors is nobody’s business.”
Charlie still had the same dopey smile as she shrugged. “It’s not a sin in our religion. I think it’s a bit unnatural anyway, asking any person to forego earthly pleasures. As long as one respects their body and that of their partner, it’s a beautiful Godly thing.”
It was frustrating getting back home. He wasn’t even sure if he should text Cas, so it was gratifying to receive one when he was nearly home.
Sam was right in the way Dean was on this case now and he’d never turned tail and ran from an awkward or difficult situation. What he needed was something in his growling stomach and a good sleep on the wide bed with a handmade quilt.
“I’m gonna go check out that breakfast.” Dean took his phone and his dignity down the stairs two steps at a time, getting lost twice in the side halls before reaching his nirvana. Their kitchen was amazing. Breakfast was on no less than five platters. What kind of master chef did they have? Right off the bat he saw the bacon, sausage, ham. And other stuff like eggs, toast, and fruit.
The priest didn’t react at all to the pointed diatribe except to fold the flyer twice and tuck it into his black robe. “I will give the thought consideration. Good day, Minister.”
That’s right, he had called other Father ‘Father’. How confusing. “So what, if you have a whole room of priests you just stand around saying, Father, Father, Father, Father?”
Dean nodded, then snatched the glass right of his brother’s hand and took a sip before Sam could nab it back. He choked. “Soda?
When they arrived at a nice set of dorms Dean was tapping his feet and drumming on his knees, the music was just turned down so low.
Due to some flattering praise, there will be several timestamps added to this in the nearby future. Hearts all around!!
“Absolution is to wipe away your sins in the eyes of God in accordance with your repentance. If you are truly sorry, forgiveness comes from the Sacrament I bestow and not myself.”
“Small towns can be difficult to navigate sometimes. Lots of twisty streets. But I bet you’ve lived here all your life, huh?”
He received all the people who were ashamed of admitting the same old sins to the same old person every time visited him when their guilt became too great.
Dean raised his hands, unable to form words. Yeah Cas wasn’t sitting in his lap exactly, but he was certainly straddling him. “Y-yeah, like that. But, um, you, uh...lower yourself.” He should’ve figured Cas would do so. He really should have. And it wasn’t like any time some giggly girl plopped herself down. For one Cas was heavier, a solid line of heat from his thighs to hips. “That’s how you do it, yep.”
It was a huge relief to let go of the thought Sam had been dating on the downlow out of fear of his father and brother. No, Sam was doing his good old-fashioned shy thing.
Whatever else he was in life, there were many ways to torture the damned and the righteous, and Dean took his time rubbing his thumb up and down and rubbing the head. He grinned viciously as the angel began to swell, slow at first, then rapidly.
Time passed in a seductive crawl, only loosening its grip when their hands fell away from each other and they resumed walking in silence.
“You know,” Dean crooked a smile at them, “nothing wrong with being straightforward. The worst someone can say is no, right?”
It was nerve wracking. Evening fell and the ceremony was super long and super boring. Oh he clapped wildly for Cas, paying no mind to anyone else.
Girls were pretty. Girls were soft and curvy and fun to touch. This was entirely different. The weight was solid, the skin scratched a bit, everything about it felt raw and shocking. His doubly traitorous cock throbbed, apparently uncaring that this was just...just...what?
Even the sound of the name made Dean’s stomach pitch and roil. Not enough to stop eating or anything, but it wasn’t fun. “Naw man, she always texts me if she wants some.”
He moved his hands on Dean’s shoulders, the heel of each palm resting on his chest. It was light, almost tentative, not the attitude he should have while on a guy’s lap.
Charlie did not disagree. “Yeah. I’ll see you soon.” They hung up and she pursed her lips. Where could that stupid will be?
. They’ve changed their name, we don’t have any recent pictures, just look for the new guy in town. He has a gambling problem too.”
He choked as the tiny amount settled on his tongue and started coughing, but it was too late. It had been swallowed and was about to ruin his life.
Tucking his phone back in his pocket, he left the bathroom to hang out with Sam for a bit. Maybe they could play video games or shoot the breeze, whatever. Yeah, had to remember what was important.
.’ Held back? What about held down, cause she loved it when he forced her face first into the mattress and went to town.
“So in all that fundraising, did you guys talk about what causes grease fires and alternatives ways to handle it?”
And that's he ended up in a large event center, walking with Sam and Cas through groups of college students, parents with their kids in wheelchairs or crutches or folded up sleeves.
After they ordered Dean began the mission’s first step; find out if Cas is interested. “So, you seeing anyone at the moment?”
A wave of guilt made him feel even worse than Benny’s utter lack of belief. It wouldn’t be the first night Dean struck out, but jiggly bits would be around after Sam left forever.
“Have you been baptized?” It was so rare he had someone wander into a booth without any sort of idea how this worked, he simply assumed that the man was a complete layman.
Charlie was staring at him as if he just pulled a rabbit out of a hat. “What was that?” she plopped down next to him like a girl at a sleepover.
“I'm afraid that I did not agree with their definition of leadership.” With that vague statement his eyes dropped low.
Oh, so that’s how he was playing it? It wasn’t about his preferences at all. Dean straightened out his stack and looked the man over. Tit for tat. “Takes one to know one, huh pop? Why don’t don’t you focus on your actual child.”
“Not gonna lie, that look is gold. The last time someone looked at me like that, I got laid.” But seriously. How could anyone interested in the guy misinterpret a look like that? Clearly this needed to be the equivalent of spelling it out for Cas to get his message across to his brother. “But okay, let’s go bold. The most obvious move in the world is, if you’re absolutely sure, is just sitting in their lap.”
“I don’t...I mean, I know.” He appeared flustered, his eyes even more blue from up this close. How did a person even have that blue of eyes? Maybe it was the contrast of black lashes and skin just a few golden shades from pale.
He kissed Dean like he was trying to taste every bit of him, mouths slotted together perfectly. At first it was sure strokes and then his tongue was sliding in and out of Dean’s mouth filthy and slow.
Dean tilted his soda back and coughed, forgetting the watery dregs were all that was left. He could feel his leg jiggling nervously under the table, trying to remember what he had said about 'Mark' who was 'new' at the garage. “Yeah, who knew he’d be so needy? I mean, it’s not hard to stop blowing out headers is it?”
Shaking his head, he went jogging up the sidewalk when the sound of boyish yells broke the air. He stopped, looking one way and the other, then breaking into a run to his left.
Dean stared after him, head tilting. He wasn’t sure if the Mayor was angling for bribes or hitting on him. Could be both, he supposed. Finishing setting up the bottles and cards, he noticed that while they were talking quite a few contestants had arrived with pots, bowls, and spoons.
It was cheery and efficient, with six-packs of beer on the end cap right in front of him. He automatically reached out for one, but his fingers fell short as he blinked. Would a gay Minister drink beer? He sucked dick, so maybe.
