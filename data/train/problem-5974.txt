“Tony,” Steve moaned, tossing his head back and blinking at the ceiling before returning his gaze to his King’s taut features.
“Well.  That was rather unfortunate, wasn’t it?” the Lord said, sounding almost bored by the whole thing.  “Though, hopefully, a good lesson for you.  I trust we won’t have a repeat of this sort of thing?  I’m usually a fair man.  Follow the rules, and you’ll be treated well.  Disobey, and you’ll find that I have years of experience in making people regret that choice.  So, you’ll either learn to abide, or you’ll find out what happens to those who don’t.  In the meantime, I believe a nice, brisk walk should rid you of some of that energy and help clear your head.”  He snapped his fingers and two other guards appeared in dress that matched the colors the Lord was wearing and far finer gear than the guards at the warehouse.  “See to it.”
“Of course,” Tony said.  “If you need help with anything, just ask JARVIS.”  Steve nodded, unsure what Tony meant by asking JARVIS for help, grabbed his clothes and headed the bathroom.  Closing the door and turning on the light, he looked at Tony’s shower.  And realized why Tony had mentioned asking JARVIS for help.  The shower was like a water park without the slide.  Jets of all different kinds adorned the walls, a granite bench was carved into one wall and a keypad with more technical displays than the first moon rocket was built into one wall.  Okay then.
She had written it with care, the way she did most things, but this…he could almost see her, snipping off a piece of tape with sharp, silver scissors.  The lengths were cut, not torn.  She had wanted it straight.  A thick pen, black, one that would keep with time.
“Track my—you can do that?” Tony said, pulling the phone away from his ear and staring down at it. “No, you can’t.”
“Hey, Tony.  Wow.  You look great,” Steve said as he stood up from his seat on the sofa in his suit that fit him like the silkworms wound it around him and smiled softly at Tony.  Tony’s breath caught in his throat.  His chest hitched and his stomach sank to his knees then floated back up to a cradle of warmth that filled his belly.   “I like your tie,” Steve told him, a small, shy smile tugging at his lips.
“I’m okay.  I am, Steve,” Tony insisted.  He wasn’t, but he would be, because Steve was here, and he would be okay for Steve.  It was easier this way, to be strong for Steve.  He could do that.  He could give Steve that, and Steve would make it true, make him strong.  Make him shine.  It was a ludicrous thought, except for the part where it worked, flooding him with a calm, centered warmth.  It had always worked.  Light a candle in the darkness, he thought.
He wondered what it would be like to rub the bar over Steve’s skin while the water rained down on both of them.
Tony pushed two fingers deep inside Steve, letting them slide back and forth over Steve’s passage, tracing along the sides back and forth a few times before he pressed hard against Steve’s prostate. Steve’s body jumped under his hand, then stilled as Tony rubbed circles over his back. He fucked his fingers in and out a few times, just to get Steve’s body ready, then pressed them firmly against Steve’s prostate, not jabbing at it anymore, just pressing and circling his fingers over the sensitive bundle of nerves, mimicking the motion his other hand was making on Steve’s back.
It wasn’t the first time the house had known death, after all, he thought as he looked up at the sketch framed over the fireplace. That had been a long knowing for all of them, but when it finally came, it had been as simple as slipping into sleep, and for that, at least, he was grateful.  The sketch was one he did after they first moved back here after the War, but he only got around to carving the frame years ago.  Ian helped him hang it a few months after they lost her, and if he saw the other image on the folded back of the sketch, he hadn’t said anything. Steve wondered if Angie told him not to ask.
Hiraeth is a Welsh word that has no direct English translation. It is a mix of longing, yearning, nostalgia, wistfulness, or an earnest desire for a home to which you cannot return, a home which maybe never was.
“That you sleep in the King’s bed by his side.  That he notices what foods you prefer and asks the chef to prepare more of those.  That he sends for books from as far away as the universities as far away as Ghoad on matters of war and art and things that he thinks might interest you.  That you have a chair in his workshop where he has never allowed anyone to stay for more than a few minutes before.  That he has the musicians play on the chamber balcony while you walk the garden because you like the music.  That he sent General Rhodes to the port—” Cam listed off, ticking each on a finger.
“No good, Steve,” Steve said, mouth twisting.  “Good,” he said again, pointing at Anto once more.  Anto wasn’t certain what the word meant, except it was intended as some kind of pleasantry, and he liked the way it sounded when Steve said it.   Steve pointed down at his leg. “Good,” he said again.
“What if he laughs in my face?  What if he gets mad I even asked him?” Tony asked in a thin, reedy sounding voice that he hated.  He wasn’t even sure who he was asking, really.
“I’ve given the men leave to eat and rest for the night,” Captain Rhodes announced as Steve walked up to the small circle of figures just outside the Sept. Tony grunted in agreement, wiping a hand over the sweat and dirt that gathered along the back of his neck.  Steve himself was itchy with heat and the salty sting of the beach sand.
“You—what?” Steve began, then shook his head and glanced away for a moment before looking back at Stark.  “I can’t…you, I can’t keep up.  Is everything always some spiel with you?  Do you rehearse this stuff?”
“I have never seen a more patriotic use of the flag.  Did I tell you that? I mean, I was definitely standing at attention.  So to speak,” Tony said with no small amount of glee. “But these? Please, never wear anything else I will buy every pair they have.  I’ll buy the factory. As the proud owner of both race car and airplane ties--I’m going for a whole transportation them there, I guess--can I just say, I wholeheartedly approve.”
“Yeah. Yeah,” Tony repeated with a deep sigh. “Thanks, Rhodey. For, you know. All of it. I should have—years ago, I should have—I could've done what you did—Army records are a piece of cake, for Christ's sake, but I didn't—I never did. I never fucking did. Damn it, I never wanted to think about him, much less...much less let myself believe, even for a moment that maybe, just maybe...God, maybe someone like Steve might actually have loved me. I couldn't deal with being wrong—with losing that again. That was the path to recalling exactly where I keep that last bottle, my friend, trust me, and it took your mom and her twelve-step course on TV/VCR repair to help me put it away the first time around.”
“A shield.  Like the one I carried,” Steve said with certainty.  Yes, he would like that. His shield on Tony’s hand. Something of him left with Tony, something
“This is Steve. He’s my Omega. We’re bonded,” Tony announced with a grimace.  “I am actually trying to stop,” he assured Steve, at Steve’s rather annoyed look.  “Oh, and he’s also Captain America, but I currently find that less interesting.”
One of Steve’s hands came around from where he was cradling Tony against his chest, and he traced a single finger down over the chain that was hidden beneath Tony’s shirt until he came to the flat metal tags laying in the center of Tony’s chest.  Steve’s eyes, dark and hooded, followed the path of his finger, only returning to Tony’s face after what seemed like an eternity.  Tony’s breath caught in his throat, or it would have, if he’d remembered how to breathe, but that suddenly seemed like a tall order.
“Of course,” Tony said, his mouth flat as he ignored the lie. “The belligerence of our allies has gained them little, General. The Dark Sea has claimed more of their ships than they have taken targets. If the Sea Queen rules the depths as the sailors claim, she favors the Free States in this, I think. I see no need to risk our ships and their crews on such an endeavor, that is all. Besides, there have long been pockets of these societies eschewing slavery for centuries, and we’ve never raised banners against them. And uprisings have occurred with or without the influence of the Free States. I believe my father sent you to deal with one in the Greenlands when you were just cutting your teeth as a soldier?”
“You begged Tony to take you down into the catacombs where you insisted there is a hidden torture chamber because Peran told you that you could stand on the grate at the center courtyard and still hear the screaming if you listened hard enough,” Steve reminded him.
“S’okay,” Tony tried to assure the alien.  “Heal me. Fix me. The gift is life, right?  That can’t be ba--oh! Oh, yeah. Yeah, there you go, that’s--” he let out a long, low hiss.  “You should really put this in the brochure,” he managed to rasp out as the alien’s finger found the ring of his hole again and started to rub at the puffy rim with his thumb. “Ahhhh, God, yeah, wow,” Tony said with a choked-off gasp that became a long, low moan.
Tony grinned wickedly, eyes crinkling at the corners, and ran his thumb around the head of Steve’s cock, too lightly, damn him, making Steve let out the breath he didn’t realize he had been holding in a frustrated hiss at the denial.  Steve could feel Tony’s own cock pressing insistently against his thigh, though Tony seemed unconcerned.  He was twisted away from Steve, soaping his hands, working up a lather, and Steve’s body knew what that meant.  A shudder ran through him, too hot all of a sudden, but then Tony’s hand was back on him again, and the heat felt good, settling low in his stomach in a coil of pressure that seemed to expand with each sure movement of Tony’s hand.
Steve dropped his gaze from Tony’s and moved forward on his knees. He braced his hands against the mirror, just below the splatters marking the glass.  Tony stood quietly where he was for a long pause, then moved forward, the gym mat squeaking under his feet. Steve felt Tony slide down behind him and heard the snick of the cap from the tube Tony had retrieved.  Steve half-expected it to be hard and fast, almost would have welcomed that, a pain he could deal with, could take, could take from Tony, but it wasn’t like that at all.  Tony’s hands on him were gentle, as they always were, and that hurt more, Steve thought, though it didn’t make any sense.  Soft and gentle and careful, skimming over him, mouth and hands, until it was almost too much.
“Um..no, no…um, I’m sorry.  I was just leaving.  Don’t…um…don’t go on my account…I mean…I’m…leaving.  For work,” Steve managed, looking around at Tony hopefully.  God, he was terrible at this.  Tony was smirking into his coffee, but he saw him flash a quick look at the woman that Steve couldn’t read.
“I handled it.  Though, I would suggest leaving those on until he learns his place.  He still lacks proper discipline, though I’m sure that’s something you are more than able to provide.  I’m told he was a soldier, once.  Raiders fished him out of the sea or some such story,” Lord Sitwell remarked.
“I can’t quite remember,” the man said smoothly. “We were both pretty tipsy. It had the word chapel in the name, if that narrows it down any.”
“Yeah,” Steve said.  He brushed a stray curl of Anto’s forehead.  “Tony is home. Wherever you are, that’s home, Tony.”  He smiled.
close.  It’s going to work,” Tony told him.  “We got the Army Corps onboard.  They’re looking for different renewable sources—solar, geo, wind, whatever, but this…this could replace all those at a fraction of the cost.  Pepper’s got all the financial data.  I’ve talked to R&D, manufacturing, marketing, legal…we’re there.  We can do this.  I know, it’s a risk.  We’ve been a weapons manufacturer since Dad hung out his shingle.  But, I think it’s one we have to take.  We’re…supplying an industry where the market has become something I barely recognize.   It’s not like when you and Dad started. There’s no Big Bad to fight, not anymore.  We stopped fighting to protect freedom.  Now, we just…fight what we tell the people to fear, and call that security.”
“We had dinner at Guy Savoy’s last night.  I think there were thirteen courses,” Steve said with a deprecating smile.  “So, yeah.  Gym.”
“You would take me with you?” Steve asked somewhat incredulously.  He hadn’t even thought of anything like that.  Such a thought had not even entered his mind.  He had looked at his life here and seen only these walls, and now, Tony was offering something else entirely, as if it were a given that Steve would be a part of this future.  He could not, of course, return home as Tony’s concubine.  Just the thought of it was horrifying.  But, that Tony would even consider such a thing was, Steve could acknowledge, incredible in its own right, let alone that he would propose it seemingly because he thought it would make Steve happy.
Tony felt itchy heat rise up his back, making him slightly dizzy and nauseous. He groaned a bit, something…he needed something…it would, if he could…it would…it would…this would go away or not away, but would feel good somehow, which was ridiculous because how could this feel good, ever?  That was crazy, but it  might be okay if he could just…just…
“Tony?” a shocked voice from behind him called out.  There’s that moment, right before you jump off the high-dive, when your stomach clenches and your heart pounds, and your head says do it while your hindbrain pleads with you to do anything but, and that had nothing on this, but it was what his mind conjured up as he turned slowly to face Steve.  “Tony?  Is that really--Wha—what are you—what are you doing here?”
“Tony,” Steve started with a slightly exasperated tone. “There are some things that biology dictates for all of us, but I want to do this for you because…well, because I want to take care of you. I love you. I mean, I want to wear your mark and your scent so all the other Alphas in the cave know that I belong to you and will leave me alone, sure. But, I spend hours sitting down in your workshop with you because you’re smart and funny and kind, and I like being around you. And I want you because you make me feel incredible, and I love how I get to make you feel. Now, will you allow me to take care of you? Please?”
“Your Highness, I was so pleased to get your message.  As you know, I strive to always provide the very best—“ Zola said, dipping into a deep bow and giving Steve a nudge with his hand as he swept it back behind him.  Right, kneel, Steve reminded himself, dropping to his knees.
“Yeah,” he nodded. “Against all odds, we’ll meet one another, and I’ll— I’ll take you out for dinner next time, Tony.”
“Diabetes?” Tony quirked an eyebrow, and he waved his own ice cream. “Unless you’ve got dysfunctional insulin or so-so, you’re safe buddy.” He stopped. “You…
Pulling himself out of his misery, he decided to look at Natasha and tilted his head for her to come and sit next to her. She subtly glanced towards Tony, and he shook his head.
“Where are you going?” Steve curiously asked. “Which hotel are we going to? I hope they aren’t pricey.”
He’d wanted to bring him to somewhere pricier, and totally his style, but this was Steve discovering Midtown Manhattan, not his attempt to date him in the worst get-up for any event that he has ever had in his life.
Tony tapped his foot, humoring the unsubtle way of changing the subject. “I’ve got an idea, you’ve got any idea about New York’s most beloved buildings?”
Natalie?” Steve wondered, remembering the name. Something about being his secretary but also jabbing a needle in him? He had to ask that in the future, but now, he shook his head. “Her name’s Natasha.”
“I did, yeah, I did.” Steve fiddled with Tony’s hair, and it was becoming one of his favorite things to feel, too. “But I still stand with what I said earlier. I… I wouldn’t have this night with you, if I have a time machine. So… thank you, Tony, for talking to me when I was staring at the clock.”
in love yet, but he was teetering dangerously so, because he’s getting the warning signs he’s had with Pepper. But that was different because Pepper and him just kind of realized they had a great dynamic and liked each other; there was no need to ‘fall’ in love because they were already, kind of, in love in their own way.
"I'm not angry that you cheated, I may sound terrible but you know what a pessimist I am. You know how terrible my own thoughts would get, you've fucking seen me at my worst. What I am angry is that you didn't even respect me enough to tell me that you don't want this anymore. You didn't even respect the history we had together to let me off the hook. You didn't even respect him enough to let him live his life openly, reducing him to nothing more than a dirty secret. You did what you wanted and you kept what you needed, not even letting any side waver."
A few years later, they had Peter, who was the blessing they were too grateful for. Steve felt like his life was complete, he had an amazing husband and a beautiful child of their own. Their own little bundle of joy who was going to be loved and cared for fiercely.
"For two whole years, you gave into your vices and desires. Do you know who I could turn to Steve? Do you think I'd want to turn to it again, after everything I've gone through?"
Tony just grabs the first aid box from the drawer next to the bed and places it on the floor next to him while he sizes up the cuts on Steve's body.
Steve grips Tony's waist and swirls it around his sheathed length, like he's trying to churn Tony's velvet insides that feel so good for Steve, he'd probably die if he didn't have this. If he didn't have Tony.
"Not everyone's a genius prodigy like you, Tony", she bumps his playfully on the shoulder with a fist.
Tony nuzzled his head into Steve's neck, placing one ear over his heart. His one hand flitted through Steve's golden locks, which were longer now and the other intertwined with Steve's own as the soldier and scientist played with each other's wedding bands. Tony placed a light kiss to the hollow of Steve's throat, eliciting a chuckle from him and who in turn, pecked Tony's hairline with a light smooch, all the while playing with the scientist's deft, calloused fingers with his own.
Eventually, Tony glanced at Steve mid-way during his speech and noticed he was making goo-goo eyes at him.
Tony clasps his hand around Steve's broad back and runs another through his hair, comforting him like a hurt puppy. He's smiling at the littany of words pouring from his mouth and also at the tickling sensation of the beard at his shoulder, snickering in response.
Before Steve knows it, Tony's pushed his legs up and places his feet on the edge of the table in front of him and twists himself, while having Steve buried inside of him fully and completely.
Tony wakes up on the couch, still wrapped in his blanket burrito. The TV is still running, playing the third installment in Star Wars and he glances up to see Rhodey, who's stayed all night like a pillow for Tony.
The fear grips him by the throat and holds him in a vice-like grip, choking him, untill not a single molecule of air lies within his lungs. His breathing is a little laboured, not as bad as he presumed it would be when he got the news. That he's getting a visitor. Who comes in peace after everything that has happened. Tony's putting up a brave fight with the rest of his body and trying therapeutic techniques to calm himself down but he feels the tremors traveling through his body because of unwarranted fear. Fear and perhaps a bit of terror- it's ghastly breath tracing it's serpentine path, slow and eerily, down the back of his neck and length of his spine, initiating volatile trepidations that rock his very being. An icy bite traverses throughout his body as he brings a hand to meddle with the knot of the tie, sitting at the hollow of his throat, and smooth it down repeatedly, trying to feel the soft velvet and let it's smooth, silky texture of the fabric calm his nerves as little as they could.
He works his way up Steve's limbs before he reaches the body, which seems to be where the cuts are the worst.
"I hate that I made you scared of me, Tony. I hate that you flinch now when you see me or even hear my name. I promised to protect you forever and I... I'm sorry Tony. I....I was just upset ever since London and.... I'm terribly sorry I hate that you probably now hate me now and it's all my fault because I'm a coward and a horrible person to you. I don't expect you to ever forgive me and I won't force it upon you. I just want another chance, Tony. I want.. please. Please!"
Birthdays weren’t a touchy thing for him; it was more of a tasteless thing to celebrate, after his mother died and Bucky kept going out for war deployment. He didn’t like going out, and if he did, it was to buy bread, because he can’t afford cake.
“You’re. Duct tape. You’re using duct tape,” Tony said, picking at the mess of star-printed duct tape on one corner. “And here I was stupid enough to think it was decoration,” he said, grinning up at Steve with both awe and amusement.
Tony preened, sitting up smugly and wiping his mouth on the back of his hand as Steve panted for air, his body twitching and trembling and eyes only half-focused. Tony leaned in, crowding into Steve’s space, his smile half-lidded and self-satisfied.
Steve said, trying to edge around Dr. Cho, his eyes fixed determinedly on the door, only to be stopped again, this time with a little shove.
“Nat, he isn’t hurting me, okay? Jesus fucking Christ, this couldn’t be more embarrassing,” he muttered, his cheeks heating as he gave her a glare. “It’s all consensual. Consensual non-consent. A rape fantasy. We’ve been planning it for ages.” She did not look convinced.
“It happened so fast, I couldn’t- I didn’t even see anything, and then- he fell, and I didn’t-“ Steve mumbled, his breath getting faster, and Sam reached out, his hand grounding and warm as he rubbed Steve’s shoulder.
“You know, I was just thinking the other day how unfair it is how nice you are,” he mumbled. “And pretty. It’s unfair.” Tony was quiet, and Steve was sure he’d crossed a line.
“Yellow,” Tony gasped, and immediately Steve stopped, carefully setting Tony’s foot down and kneeling beside Tony, touching his face gently.
Tony couldn’t help but shake his head with a tired laugh. It made sense, of course. He reached for her hand.
Tony pulled into the underground garage and tapped a few commands into his phone, muting Jarvis and disabling a few security fields that Steve had requested, then tossed the phone on the dash with a grin.
“I want you to watch,” Steve murmured, his cheeks growing pinker at the boldness of his request, and Tony was lost to it.
“What’s this?” Steve asked, leaning forward curiously. Tony grinned smugly and Steve’s heart skipped a beat because Tony was too pretty to be allowed.
your computer. It just has a shiny new dress to wear when it comes to the coffee shop,” Tony said. Steve shook his head, his eyes narrowing.
“You like beds better.” Tony waggled his eyebrows, which Steve opted to cover with his hand. He pulled away afterwards, just in time to see Tony smile again.
“No,” Tony laughed, “—that’s a constant with the life of Tony Stark. People leave. People get tired of me, when they get to know me.”
“Billionaire, former playboy, genius, philanthropist, Steve.” Tony corrected, resting his chin between his pecs. That made him blush a little, but he figured this was a thing that Tony did, and he loved Tony, so he’s going to yuck it up because he looked honestly adorable. “You’ve got to remember that.”
“No, no, you looked like a great sight,” Tony smirked, kissing his chest. Steve felt his face heat. “I mean, honestly, tell me you actually model somewhere. I’m going to start a clothes line. You model every single men’s outfit.”
He looked at him straight in the eyes, and shook his head. “Ah—shit, Steve. No, I’m—I just realized something. I’m sorry I took it out on you, I swear I’m not really mad—“
There was a beat of silence, before Tony turned his head towards Steve, who was impishly grinning at him. He had a golden foil ball in his hand, and was about a foot away from the ledge.
this wasn’t. This wasn’t how it was supposed to go. They were becoming sexually-charged, and god, Steve was getting into it too.
Hoo boy, just a few chapters more! Hope you're enjoying! Please tell me your thoughts down below! It will be greatly appreciated :D
“Not—not really,” Tony murmured, leaning his cheek onto his head. “I guess it couldn’t be helped that they’re keeping Captain America to themselves.”
Steve could understand. He was weird with emotions himself, and maybe that was why he was urged to share more than he had with anyone in SHIELD. “I grew up—poor, and, uh.” He looked to the sky. “I just wanted. There’s a lot that are gone, and well.”
Steve didn’t mean to stare at everything. It was just—so surreal, seeing so many people, that were just
“Oxygen, carbon, nitrogen…argon…?” Steve tentatively asked. He never was able to get a chance to catch up on science. He didn’t have the money to go to school.
The genius gave the other man a playful shove, but Steve held on strongly. “Okay, that’s how you’re going to play it, Bulldozer.” He raised his hands and tried to escape Steve’s grip by a maneuver he was taught by Natalie, but then Steve just—countered it.
“I know I’m famous and I know Stark Tower is literally just a few ways off, it’s literally huge and I was waiting for JARVIS to tell me that there’s this blond waiting in the lobby, or shit, something,” he grit his teeth. “I waited for two god damn weeks, and every night, I’d want to go out and see you again, but I’d convince myself that you weren’t going because I thought—I didn’t have to do it myself!”
for beer, no, he still had his style) when someone bumps onto him, someone running. More like hitting a bulldozer, because he goes flat on his butt on the pavement and down on his back.
Steve reached out to put his hand on the nape of Tony’s neck, curling his hand gently around it. He thought about what to say for a moment, and nodded to himself.
“God, Tony,” he murmured, looking at the mirror, observing his bloodshot eyes—he was crying? He didn’t know he was crying, not again, not again—“I miss you.”
Those words haunted his mind for several days, as if it was a promise that he had agreed to but never verbally. The water that cascaded onto his body reminded him of that time, in the hotel, where they spent their last few moments together, Tony cradled into his arms.
Before they arrived to the Empire State Building, Tony gestured to different buildings in the way, talking about engineering facts and such. Most prominently were the former American Radiation Building (
Steve hummed. “Glad to be of service, Mr. Connoisseur, will we be purchasing more trinkets for me? Or more chocolate for you—“. Steve ducked just in time and caught the golden foil ball in his hands, thrown courtesy of an irate Tony. “—Tony, don’t litter. Even if they are Ferrero Roche, dogs and cats won’t love them.”
He watched as Fury regarded him with a stare, before turning around. “Well. If that’s the case, I will be getting the others here. No sense of losing time. Fucking eccentrics…”
The other man grinned, and tutted. “I’m taking tourist vibes here. I’m just saying, it’s Grand Central Terminal, not Station. Better be knowledgeable. You can be New Yorker if you’ve stopped gaping at everything.”
The hundred dollars given to him to “enjoy your stay in SHIELD, Cap, it will be a meantime till we give you a permanent base” was heavy in his pocket. He didn’t have the heart to ask for a decent pencil and sketchbook too, because that felt too weird.
But it’s not like it wasn’t believable. Beside him was probably someone who talked like gunfire; he talked, and talked, but he was excitable, and somehow that was endearing.
It was after what it felt like a long time did he finish showering when another statement echoed in his mind.
“I was lost, Tony,” he barrelled on. His shoulders were hunching, but he was soldiering on. “I was lost, and you were there. You saw me and you talked to me, and god, you, with your chocolate brown eyes, and your funky beard that I grew to like; you, with your oversized coat and bottle of vodka. You and your Ferrero Roche. God, I want to tell you so bad about Pietro.”
“My dad,” Tony continued, as if that explained everything about him holding dangerous arms at age six. “I’m a genius, through and through. My parents are rich as hell, and any move I did, the cameras followed me. I went to MIT, Massachusetts Institute of Technology. I got my degrees for masters and doctorate, fifteen and sixteen years old, respectively. Physics, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering. I’ve got a BS on thermonuclear physics too, just got that for the hell of it.”
Tony clicked his tongue. “I don’t care. I’m hungry, and chocolate can only satiate my hunger for some time. Now,” he gestured towards a building. “Metlife Building, Steve.”
And that was how he and Tony spent the hour; where the seconds flew fast, the minutes blurring into one another.
For some reason, he knew he had to answer, partly because of being fair, and largely because something in his mind nagged for him to do it. “Steve.”
Tony didn’t so much as blink at the abrupt topic change (and simultaneous confession) but he had figured it out as much. However, he thought it was just a picture, so it made Steve’s action even more meaningful.
“One day, we’ll meet again.” The genius continued, putting his hand over Steve’s chest, like a promise. He leaned into him, kissing his lips.
Steve looked up to the sky, and was startled that it was actually nearing night time. The sun was setting and has he really run for five hours?
Steve was an introvert, and for some reason he was always attracted to extroverts with sharp tongues.
“Uh,” he muttered, knowing that he was treading on unknown territory. “Ye-es. I presume you’re Tony Stark.”
that she was tasked to watch over him, but over the last few weeks, he found somewhat of a kinship between he and she. Maybe because he just really liked great people, or people who could tolerate him? That was a large deciding factor.
Tony offered out his hand, and Steve reached out and took it—and Tony pulled him in, and Steve fell. As if he wasn’t made to fight a war, as if he wasn’t Captain America. As if he wasn’t two-hundred pounds of muscle.
The blond looked at him underneath his eyelashes, and took his mouth onto his, and broke away. “Baby, let me take care of you.” He whispered, breath hot and heavy on his neck. “I’d love to, if I can.”
Right now, it felt like the weight of the world was crashing on them, and Steve was grounding himself to reality, through him.
walked next to Nick Fury. Steve, already anticipated the Hulk with the Avengers (because Fury’s opening statement about Hulk was basically ‘you have to find a way to control him to your advantage’)—but when he met gazes with Natasha, he glared; she sent her a wink, mouthing
The mention of Peter elicits a small chuckle from Steve, who recalls the fight between him and the kid. He absolutely adores him and is happy that Tony is now mentoring someone personally, like how he did Wanda and the rest of the team, side by side with Nat.
"Steve, oh God, I missed you too, oh lord, this is so fucking hot, dear God, your beard is driv- driving me nuts, FUCK! You are full of surprises, daddio!"
"Congratulations, Mr. Stark. And most importantly, we thank you for supporting yourself and us by taking part in the program."
Tony closed the distance between them and pressed his tender lips against Steve, while he placed a hand on his cheek and caressed the slight stubble there.
He just stands there, barely blinking or even moving as he slowly feels his breathing get more and more laboured and it feels like his lungs are burning with a raging vengeance, trying to consume him from the inside out.
He's partially terrified that the other man or Steve saw him. He's not going to face Steve and give him the fucking benefit of watching him break down and collapse on the floor. He's definitely not going to give that lousy, worthless bastard the benefit of that. Not in this lifetime or the next. If Steve's almost home, then he can walk out on him and perhaps even run him over. His heart aches at that because not in a million lifetimes could he ever muster the strength or the goddamn will to ever hurt Steve and look into his watery blues and feel his soul crumble at his puppy face. He can't and he never will. That's why he's leaving without a single trace of his existence in this house.
That's why he'd rather be anywhere else than with me. Because all I do is ruin everything and make him feel miserable.
Updates won't be very regular after this. I think I'm hitting a block but I promise I'll work through it :')
It shows him Peter. His kid. His kid who's always looked up at Steve as his hero, averting his eyes from Steve as he backs away from him. Peter's always been discreet with his emotions but now, now he just breaks down and tells Steve to leave.
Tony tries taking a step but his knee gives way and he settles for hobbling towards the big dumb figure standing and staring at him.
In his peripheral vision, Steve watched Tony walk over to the bedside table and dip his fingers in the warm oil.  Confusion fogged Steve’s brain for a moment, then he saw Tony slip something out of his pocket.  He must have made some kind of noise because Tony turned and cast an amused look over his shoulder.
He still didn’t know why he got fired from the jobs Sam found for him when he’d thought he was doing pretty good, but apparently not good enough.  Frankly, he thought the thing with Mr. Nguyen was all some misunderstanding since he never got any messages about coming in early or taking the weekend shift. Sure, some days were still harder than others, and he still had the occasional nightmare or moment when something would set him off, but it was better. He was better.
“It’s different with you,” Steve replied, sounding almost surprised by the admission.  “I could always talk to you.”
“Yeah, well.  I figured if you were maybe going to calling be out my name by mistake at inopportune moments for the rest of your life, you should probably have the real thing,” Tony told him with a lopsided smile.  He wants me to use his name, Steve realized with a wave of surprise.  His real name.  It’s important to him.
“Just wondering.  It’s strange not to know what’s normal for me now.  I mean, I know you said we’re friends, but I wasn’t sure what that meant.  Exactly,” Steve clarified, shifting a bit in his seat, like the words made him uncomfortable, and Tony had to try very, very hard not to send a prayer of thanks to the heavens that Steve apparently wasn’t going to pursue this line of questioning too far.  “But, it’s nice.  That we do this now.”
One of Tony’s hands was running up and down Steve’s back, fingers splayed wide as the passed over the raised skin there while Tony’s mouth scalded across the worst of the weals, the skin too damaged there for Steve to really feel it, but he knew. He
“Hey Tony,” Steve said and took a swing at the bag, making it rock back a few feet and catching it on the downswing. This time, he did turn to look at Tony.
“Welcome back!  Did you kill a boar?” Cam asked excitedly as soon as Tony crossed the threshold to their chambers.
The guy stepped out of the limo, and Steve was left to wonder if he was meant to follow.  The guy bent back down to peer into the limo at Steve.  “Well?  Come on.  We only have to put in an appearance.  But, I paid for the whole evening, so…let’s go, hot stuff!  Want to get my money’s worth,” he said, the smile that didn’t meet his eyes back on his face, leaving Steve to wonder what he considered getting his money’s worth.
“Oh, yeah, no problem,” Tony replied quickly to cover the disappointment that welled up in him.  Something had opened there for a moment, and then slammed shut again, and he didn’t have the first clue why, except the feeling that he’d said something wrong.  Again.
He shut the comm off, hesitated a moment longer, then switched off the air recirculator.  He wondered how long it would take. Felt like one of those math problems about two trains or something.  He used to love those. A tad morbid to calculate your own time of death, though, he supposed. He laughed, then switched on the repulsors and shot off into the dark.  Not like he was going to run into something out here, he figured.
“I…” Steve started.  Stopped.  Shook his head and felt his jaw clench.  He was messing up, somehow.  Doing this wrong, and the King was going to send him away and Zola would be waiting. Waiting with the boy, and it had been so easy to slip beneath the waters, where it was dark and cold, and this was so much harder.  He drew in a shaky breath.  The King was watching him in silent expectation, his face hard and unreadable.  “I didn’t want you to send me away, Your Highness, and I…I just knew it would work.  When you asked.  I could see it, in my head, that it would work. I couldn’t build it, or tell you how, but…” he trailed off, shaking his head in apology.  He wasn’t saying it right, what he wanted to say, but he couldn’t explain it any better.
“Well, I would love to chat, but I have to finish…this thing, down in the  lab, you know…work stuff,” Tony stuttered, already turning to head back upstairs.
“You are most welcome, Steven,” Tony said in a melodic, teasing voice, then his hands stilled where they hovered over a button.  “I wanted you to feel beautiful.  You should.  Always, but—today.  Especially today,” Tony said, lifting his gaze to Steve’s.  Tony gave a huff of a laugh, almost deprecating, to the extent Tony could, bit at the corner of his lip and dropped his gaze to somewhere in the center of Steve’s chest.  He went back to his task, though slower this time, the frenzy of a moment ago seeming to have left him. He was slow, deliberate, undoing each button with care and peeling the tunic apart, his fingers ghosting over the flesh of Steve’s chest beneath just enough for Steve to feel the heat of Tony’s hands even as the air cooled his skin.
“Owowowow,” Tony muttered in vague annoyance as much as actual pain as Natasha helped him slowly sink onto one of the metal benches that lined the inner hull of the Quin-jet.
“Good,” Bruce said.  “Tony…look, none of this was your fault.  Whatever happened, it happened when the jet blew.  He got winged with the repulsor, but that actually may have helped keep the blood loss from being worse.”
In particular, Steve liked the King’s library above all, where the books seemed to outnumber the dustmotes that danced on the sun as it filtered through the windows.  Books of every sort, on every subject imaginable.  Books and…maps.  Maps of the entire kingdom.  Steve spent countless hours combing through them until he felt certain he had their likely route to the area of General Ross’s encampment memorized, thanks to Tony’s descriptions of the sights they would pass, as well as the best possible options for his escape.  Even now, his stomach churned with guilt at the subterfuge.  He knew the feeling was misplaced, yet couldn’t quite shake the sense of recrimination at using Tony’s largesse as a means to his escape.
Big thank you to tastes-like-coconut for the beta, as always!  Follow her on tumblr for some wonderful art.
Tony knew Coulson had just said it, but he needed to hear it, over and over, like the more times it was said, the harder it would be for the universe to take it back.  No take-backs, you hear, he thought hazily.  No take-backs.  People were staring at them.  They were making a scene.  He didn’t care.  Let them look, as long as Coulson kept saying Steve was okay.
The file whirred to life, and Steve blinked at the sudden brightness.  Not lights this time, but sun, radiant and high, catching the camera’s lens head on for a moment before the angle shifted.  Off to one side, he heard a splash, followed a moment later by high-pitched shrieks of laughter.
“Okay, yes, I lied a little bit after the memory thing and I was an absolute idiot for months, I know that.  I’ve literally watched the videotape, and it kills me, but you could have just said, or, you know, if that didn’t work, then just grabbed me and shaken me until I came to my senses or something, because how am I supposed to ever think that someone like you would ever like someone like me, when I don’t even…I mean, I’m just saying, you could have been more clear, is all!  No, wait, I’m not done,” Tony continued in a near shout when Steve opened his mouth to say something.
“Yeah, I know. We’re a bit beyond that, I’ll freely admit, but it isn’t like it would be a bad thing.  Taking it slow,” Tony pointed out.  He sucked in a breath and bit his lip, but Steve kept silent.  “I was serious about the therapy thing.  You and me. We go talk to someone.  Counseling.  Dream journals.  Trust exercises. Towers of furniture.  Whatever it takes.”
“It wasn’t your fault. Any more than Bucky’s death was mine,” Steve said after a long beat of silence.  It felt good to say it, even if there was still a part of him that refused to believe it.
“Is that what you're building out there in your garage? Robots?” Steve asked, still grinning like this was Christmas, and Santa gave him a stocking full of idiot Omega.
He shook his head, dropping his arms to his sides and sucking in a deep breath.  The voice, whoever or whatever it was, was silent.  Steve looked around again, hoping against hope to see someone, perhaps one of the children from the village playing a jest on him, but no one appeared. Finally, he set off back towards the farm, his eyes straight ahead, steadfastly refusing to think about anything other than getting home.
“I—yes.  For a short time,” Steve replied and slid a plate with two large slices in front of Tony, along with the glass of lemonade.
Tony watched Steve’s eyes flutter shut as he drifted off, then curled up on the few inches of bed next to him as best he could.  Some kind of brace, Tony thought.  It could run heat and cold on intervals.  Thin, but with embedded sensors to monitor vitals and measure muscle tension during contractions.   Something that could flex and allow mobility, maybe shift some of the movement to Steve’s hips and give his spine a break, the way a mountain backpack does.  That could work, Tony considered.  Definitely could work.  He could probably have a prototype design ready in a few days if he put his mind to it.  Might give Steve some relief, anyway.  Could work.  It could.  Could—
“Is it too much?  Dinner and all?  I can tell them to call it off,” Tony offered.  Please say no, please say no, he mentally chanted.  He wasn’t sure how he’d handle only getting a couple of hours of Steve’s time during a commute.  Steve seemed to treat the morning’s Tony-shaped surprise like a forced march he had to suffer through and then like something Tony would ditch like a Taylor Swift boyfriend, given half the chance.   Not exactly the kind of attitude that screamed ready to rekindle a relationship, Tony mused.
“You know, I love and adore you completely and want to basically worship you all the time, but you’re kind of a dick when you want to be. I’m just saying,” Tony replied.
happy, Steve, I truly am. I’d hoped… well. It is not every day that even a king gets what he wants.” He let out a long sigh. “I would love to celebrate further, but regrettably, we must be getting back. The Ul will be arriving soon, and while a king’s time may be his own, beginning our meeting with Ul-Tarn by insulting him is probably unwise,” Tony said.
Brock couldn’t have done this, of course.  Steve understood that well enough.  Their current financial situation was the reason he was here, after all.  But, well, really, it wasn’t so much about the extravagance of the evening, though that was nice in and of itself, sure, but it made something slightly uncomfortable lodge itself in Steve’s chest, like a little hitch when he breathed, this idea that Tony might have done this--at least this part of the night--on Steve’s account. For him. To make him happy.
“Raj’Inama,” Tony said softly, his voice warm. He reached out and cupped Steve’s jaw, his thumb grazing lightly over Steve’s cheek, just above the seam of the veil.  Steve nearly went limp with relief, leaning in to the familiar gesture.  Warmth bloomed inside his chest. He felt boneless, liquid, as if he could melt into Tony’s hand, if he truly tried.
“Tony—what??? What are you—wait.  You mean, there’s…there’s some kind of signal that I could…and you would…” Steve’s voice trailed off.  He looked off towards the swath of trees in front of them. “Just like that. Just—just like that. Wow.”
He opened the refrigerator and peered at the contents with a frown.  Nothing really screamed baby food.  Probably not Natahsa’s borscht or those mushrooms Bruce had wrapped up in cheesecloth, he thought with a grimace.  Tony rummaged around a bit, finally pulling out a container of leftover lasagna.
It took a week for the fishing gear--sans pound of crickets-- to arrive. A week in which Tony largely ignored him, except for the few minutes during which Steve passed Tony’s lunch to him through the garage door, like a guard handing a prisoner his tray, and then the slightly less awkward dinner and movie routine they had established for the evenings.  Steve put the time to good use, or so he hoped.  He reached out to a couple of the people at Caltech that the agents in R&D had mentioned, spent far too much time trying to get his sketch of the robot from Metropolis to look the way he wanted it to without ever quite getting it there--something was off, he didn’t know what, but the movie was one of those before-memories, so it was hard to say--and ordered a few books on astronomy so he could at least talk to Tony about the subject if he got the chance again.
Why did he crave this sometimes? What impulse drove him to push until he got it? Was he punishing himself somehow? Why did he feel so much release when it was over, as if the pain itself carved some kind of phantom weight from his body that he barely knew he was carrying? He didn’t have an answer this night any more than he had any others, but it was true. He wanted the night’s punishment, whatever it would be. Tony always seemed to know what he needed, after all.
Yeah.  Right. Because he was doing just great on his own, Tony thought, frowning as he looked around the room again and mentally urged Ty to hurry up.  Okay, tonight notwithstanding, he was doing okay, he told himself.  Classes were going well.  When he managed to make it to them.  Not that he really needed to go, as Ty pointed out.  He was well beyond the material.  He kind of missed it, though.  And a few of his professors had started to notice, but Ty said they were just blowing smoke because they’d get in trouble with the administration if they didn’t at least put up some fuss.  Not like anyone was really going to make a big stink about it, since he could pass his exams without actually going, no problem.
“It’s alright, Steve,” Tony said quietly, gently, so gently. “You did so good.” He stretched his palm out over the rock and slowly took it from Steve’s open hand. Steve’s gaze tracked the rock until Tony tucked it into his robes. “Thank you,” Tony told him in a soft voice. His hands roved up and down Steve’s arms, almost as if warding off a chill. “Better now?” he asked, and yes, Steve realized that he was. He felt… firmer, somehow, without the rock. He didn’t quite know how to explain it, but the sense of being more himself again was there, at the edge of his mind.
Steve’s eyes were dark and wide, little more than a ring of white visible at the edges, his mouth slightly parted.  As Tony watched, Steve’s tongue darted out to wet his lips, an unconsciously titillating gesture.  Tony heard himself moan and dipped his head, letting it fall against Steve’s chest, resting there with his back curved so he could look down at the space between them.  His own cock was red and full, raised just slightly off Steve’s hip.  Steve was always ahead of him, his own erection already jutting out next to Tony’s stomach and leaking fluid in small, wet spurts over Steve’s stomach and groin.  Tony moved his hips again, slowly this time, the mimicry obvious.  When he looked up, Steve’s eyes were squeezed shut, mouth flattened as the muscles of his throat constricted, his Adam’s apple bobbing up and down.  Tony watched, mesmerized for a moment, then turned his head to the side and took Steve’s nipple between his teeth.
Color.  Damn it, Tony thought, grinding his teeth in frustration.  He got up from his chair and walked over to bend down low enough to see his reflection in the Audi’s driver-side mirror.  Yep.  Great. A smear of grease slashed across his check where he’d let his hand dangle.  So much for bringing sexy back, he thought with a sigh.
“You’re not selfish, Tony.  You’re about the least selfish person I know.  I wanted to come with you,” Steve said.
“Dugan got pneumonia.  You took him to the convent,” Tony said with a sudden jerk of his hips.  He buried his head into Steve’s chest, digging his forehead in.  His mouth was wet. Sloppy.  He didn’t care.  He pressed a wet kiss to Steve’s breastbone.  There had once been a scar there, bisecting Steve’s chest, though it was long gone.  If Tony closed his eyes, he could still see it, red and blistered with the skin stretched too tightly.
“If I had a nickel for every time I heard that from you…I’d have, like, two nickels,” Tony grinned, turning to Pepper.  “He’s very proper. You need to loosen up, I’ve told you that. It’s bad for your health, being all uptight all the time.  You’re like Cameron Frye over there.”
“God, I think you might be more fucked up than I am. Which, believe me, would be an accomplishment,” Tony muttered.  “Okay, I’ll bite.  Why is getting your ass kicked your favorite memory?”
“Be still, I said,” the overseer admonished roughly and pushed the thing in hard, then again and again, and Steve grunted, trying to hold his feet under him as the man worked him open. Then it was done, and the pressure left with a swift jerk.  Steve let out a breath he hadn’t meant to be holding and clamped his jaw shut and held his head up, staring forward until Zola finally ordered him to turn around.  The overseer gave Steve’s shaft a few, hard strokes, then lifted his balls and pulled them through a metal ring before sliding his cock through and settling the ring at the base.  The blue wrap came next, tying simply in a knot in the front.
Once his shift ended, he caught the bus home and managed a quick, cold shower before picking up Bucky’s phone, having long ago given up his own, and working up the nerve to call the number on the card with the spider on it.  He prayed for voicemail, but the phone gods were not with him.
At the appointed time, Steve strode across the suite, ignoring Bucky’s wolf-whistle, and knocked on the door to Tony’s bedroom.  Tony threw it open a moment later, and Steve forgot what he’d practiced saying, the little speech he’d thought would be charming flying right out of his head when he looked down at Tony, who was dressed in an impeccably tailored grey-striped suit, his hair still a little damp from his shower, and the white shirt he was wearing halfway unbuttoned where one hand hovered like Steve had caught him in the act of getting dressed.  And that…well, that was enough to make whatever Steve had planned sort of melt into a buzzing blackness, while his mind helpfully supplied a somewhat nonsensical, if predictable, stream of words like skin, bed, shirt, chest, wet, neck and
This is what it feels like to be loved, Tony thought.  He knew it, because it was familiar, it had been there for maybe longer than he’d realized.  Love wasn’t a surprise, it was a promise, a choice, made every moment of every day, again and again, and it was a pattern they’d both fallen into a long time ago.  It just took a little forgetting to realize it.
He didn’t tear it out of Fury’s hands.  He wanted to. But, he didn’t. He thought that might be frowned on.
Wind whistled outside, and he could hear the rain pelting on the roof in large drops and thunder rolling off the mountain.  A goodish kind of storm, that was what Peggy would have said.  Angie never much liked the way the storms would roll off the mountains in waves of dark clouds carrying thunder and lightning, but Steve always rather liked those nights. They carried a strange kind of energy with them, a feeling like...like something might happen.  Yes, something might happen, like a brushfire or a flood, he remembered Peggy teasing him when he stood in the doorway and watched the clouds pour down from the mountain.  There never was a brushfire, though one time, the river nearly flooded after nearly two weeks of rain, but someone put up a dam overnight and never even took credit for the feat.
Cam bobbed his head towards the workshop again, flattening his mouth and making his eyes go wide.  Steve let out a breath, looked over his shoulder and then back at Cam.  He gave a little nod and stood up.  Cam followed him into the workshop, where Tony was hunched over a gear of some kind with a large, leather glove on one hand and a small, heated tool of some kind that Steve didn’t recognize in the other.  Tony was, by all appearances, hard at work, but there was a smile tugging at the corners of his mouth that he kept trying to push away.
“I’m sorry.  About what happened.  I should’ve, I don’t know.  Come to see you or something,” Steve said.
Brock came around the top of the stairwell in a race, then stopped at the sight of them, drawing up abruptly.
“I want to go home. Please, Ty, I—” Tony broke off as Ty’s grip on his chin turned bruising.  Ty leaned down close, so close that Tony could smell the alcohol on his breath, sending a danger signal blaring in the recesses of Tony’s mind.
“I really am proud of you, Tony,” Steve said, bringing his hands up to cup the sides of Tony’s face. “You worked so hard.  I know it wasn’t always easy, being the only Omega. All that pressure.  Having to be perfect, all the time, so they wouldn’t have any excuse.  You did it, though.  You showed them.  All of them. Everyone out there who thought this was some crazy stunt or just me indulging you, you showed them that you belong here, just as much as anyone else.  More.  But, you’ve always been more, haven’t you?  Always.  So much more than they want to let you be,” Steve said, his voice gentling, eyes going soft and crinkling at the corners, the way Tony liked.
“Suck,” Steve told him, and Tony closed his mouth around Steve’s thumb, tasting leather and metal and sweat and Steve.  He moved his mouth forward a bit, taking more of Steve’s thumb into his mouth.  His tongue darted out, almost experimentally, against the smooth leather, feeling the line of stiches and creases where the glove fit around Steve’s hand.  His eyes caught on Steve’s face, pupils blown wide, dark pools of blue like the night ocean, lips parted just enough for Tony to see the small pants of breath working in and out, muscles tight across his jaw, a slight furrow deepening on his forehead.
That was the thing.  Everyone had someone.  Maybe you didn’t find that person, but they were out there.  No matter who you were or what you did, there was someone who would love you.   Sure, it didn’t mean eternal bliss, even if you found that person.  Real life wasn’t a fucking storybook.  But it meant—well.  It meant you were someone who could be loved.  You had that.  And as it turned out, just knowing that meant something to people.  Maybe you wouldn’t be happy.  There were no guarantees.  But, everyone had the chance, and that mattered a whole fucking lot to people.  Hell, murderers had soulmarks.  Hilter, Stalin…Trump.  They all had marks.
Steve swallowed past the lump in his throat.  He should be horrified. Repulsed. It was a sin as surely as anything could be, wasn’t it? He should be afraid, too.  He should be a lot of things, but all he could think about were the dreams, and how he felt in that span of waking, before the last wisp of the dream curled away, when he felt like everything was exactly as it should be.
“I don't think that's a good idea right now, Tony,” Steve responded quietly, glancing at the lawyer, his voice low and strained, raspy, like Steve sometimes got when he couldn't quite get his air, which hurt to know, to be able to recognize so easily, to slip into old where-did-we-put-the-inhaler-this-time-so-we-will-definitely-probably-remember-it habits like a second skin. Because it would be easy. So very, very easy. Those feelings, they had buried themselves so brutally well that Tony had assumed they were gone, but that, clearly, had never been the case. They were the jack-in-the-box, and he was on the last note, his heart hammering in his chest because he knew, he knew, dammit, that one more turn and that was all it would take.
usually retained by the harem, he was using it to line his own pockets, among many other failures, of which you are far too aware.”
“That’s right,” Tony said, smiling softly again, though there was a tightness to it that hadn’t been there before. “Like a million bucks.”
“Okay,” Tony replied.  He cleared his throat and pointed with his fork. “Seriously, the manicotti is amazing.”
Tony sighed and dropped his head for a moment.  “You’re killing me here, you know that, right?” Tony asked when he looked back up at him.
, that was…he didn’t think like that anymore.  I’m not that person.  I’m not.  Binary systems don’t work like that.
“I mean,” Tony continued, taking his hands out of his pockets and pointing at his chest.  “You get these plans you want so badly, and all I get is shot down. All in all, not how I was picturing this evening going. So, let’s say, we make a trade.”
“Hey!  You two there!  What’s going on here?” a uniformed officer demanded, shining his flashlight at where Tony stood next to the remains of the getaway van, in a drizzle of water from the hydrant, with five would-be kidnappers taking cat-naps on the street around them.
“To fight with,” Tony explained, then knelt down on the floor and pushed the button again, this time making a booming-whooshing sound to go with the little burst of sparks.  He placed his action figure in front of the robot, igniting the sparks once more and adding his own sound effects so it could face off against Captain America.  Steve couldn’t help but smile at the adorableness.  He had the sudden urge to turn and tease Tony, make some comment about how cute he had been as a boy, which Tony would pretend to hate, but
“How old are you?” Tony blurted out.  It was that switch being flicked again, he thought a moment later, when the soft expression slid of Steve’s face.  Tony never knew when he was going to hit it, but he seemed to have a knack for finding it.
It was the same. Well, not the exact same, of course. But, close enough. And there, protruding obscenely from the wall like the best kind of pornography, was the same perfectly curved ass that Steve remembered, with its hole stretched gloriously around a bright red plug, as if the man had never left this room since the last time Steve was here. A sharp, nearly-broken cry escaped him before he could catch himself. He shoved his fist into his mouth and closed his eyes, then opened them again, wanting to drink in the sight. It was better than he remembered. Better than the drawings he hid in the box under his bed. Better than
“What’s the point?” Tony asked.  Tony’s voice was pitched low, husky. Like he was sharing a secret  It seemed to echo in Steve’s chest.  He could feel his heartbeat rise to meet each word. Water dripped down Tony’s tanned chest.
“Try doing it naked,” Barnes suggested.  “Seriously, you all look at me like that all you want, but I’m telling you, we lock these two naked in a closet and this’d be over in like ten—“
sinful things.  First to one taut peak, then the other.  Sucking, laving, nipping, all in some pattern Steve couldn’t discern but that made his whole body feel like it was lighting up with some kind of low-level of electricity fired over his nerve endings. Things that Steve had only vaguely thought of a few times when he was in the bathroom trying to get himself off as quickly as possible so he could get to bed without making Brock feel bad for how long it took him after Brock finished.  Too soon, or too late, he never seemed to get it right, except that tonight, maybe, Tony didn’t really seem to care, which was more of a relief than Steve wanted to admit.
“You didn’t have to do this, but…” Steve began, eyes glistening as he looked down at Tony.  “I’m glad you did.”
“Soon,” Tony promised as he released Steve’s reddened cock. He gripped each of Steve’s balls in his hand, weighing them and feeling them tighten and harden, then gave them a sharp tug. Steve’s hips jerked forward, and he grunted in sharp surprise. Tony reached between Steve’s legs and wrapped a hand around the head of Steve’s cock, pinching the end between his thumb and forefinger and holding it for a moment. Steve let out a deep moan, his chest dipping forward so it pressed against the bed, body going lax. When he felt Steve relax, some of the tension leaving his back and thighs, he let go and moved to grip Steve’s hips as he lined himself up. He pushed in slowly, relishing the way the incredible liquid heat of Steve’s body engulfed him.
Long, shuddering breaths slowly filled Steve’s lungs.  He knelt there, panting, one hand still holding his cock, dripping with come, and the other quivering as it bore the brunt of his weight.  He was going to fall, he thought, somewhat dazedly, and then Tony’s arms were around him, rolling him to his side, where his head was gently laid in Tony’s lap.
“Huh?  Oh.  Yeah. Sure, that--that’d be great,” Steve told him, smiling flatly.   A wave of something Steve told himself was hunger passed through him.  That was what he wanted, right?  That was what he had asked for last night.  If he was getting what he wanted, why did it feel so… disappointing?  His mind flashed to the snarl on Brock’s face last night when Steve suggested it, and he thought of Tony, making sure it was good for Steve, taking his time,
“Well,” Fury started, drawing out the word and bringing Steve’s attention back to the present.  “Just that he’s a bit, I don’t know…I guess you’d call it
“Does he always do that?” Rhodes asked Bucky, handing Tony a plate stacked with mini-cheeseburgers and fries. “How does he do that?  I want to go down to these tunnels and, I don’t know, hand out sandwiches and, like…medical care or something. Call my Congressman. Write strongly worded letters.”
“He seemed…I don’t know, distant.  God, that age, though, it’s all so terribly awkward, isn’t it?  And college now…that has to be intimidating for him, I would imagine,” Peggy observed.
He never should have gotten Steve involved in this. He knew how dangerous it was.  How dangerous Obie was. But he’d let himself be talked into it, and now…now Steve was in danger, real danger, because Obie was done playing around, obviously, and it was all Tony’s fault.
“Okay, I have to ask,” Steve said, nodding his head towards the far wall of the living room and gesturing with his hand.  “I know a lot of your collection is modern, and I meant what I said. It’s amazing.  Really.  But…what’s with the professionally hung empty fire extinguisher box next to the Pollock?”
“God, yes. No. I don’t know.  This is—so much, please, Steve, I’m dying here.  You’re killing me, this is cruel and unusual, God, Steve,” Tony muttered through gritted teeth.  Steve smiled, a low laugh escaping him, then leaned down and sucked the lobe of Tony’s ear into his mouth, teasing at it with his tongue and teeth, then sucking away the sting.  He let it go when he heard Tony moan and felt his neck tip back in surrender, abandoning it to trace a trail down Tony’s jaw and neck, sucking and nipping, then following up with soft, light kisses, laving at the spots with his tongue. Tony was going to have bruises there tomorrow, he thought, and the image that filled his head sent sparks of hot, burning desire bursting down his body to pool at the head of his cock.
Steve tried calling Brock’s phone. Twice.  Brock didn’t pick up.  Steve realized he was still holding on to Stark’s phone, which was probably rude, but he looked down at the feed and called Brock’s number again.  On Stark’s screen, he could see the bar’s camera view of Brock pulling out his phone, looking at the screen, then letting it ring.  Steve looked up.  Stark was still discreetly looking out at the Vegas strip, but Steve had the odd sensation that if he had looked up just a moment before, he would have caught Stark looking his way.
Steve nodded and watched Tony slide out of his chair and walk away, then pulled out his own phone to check the messages.  Nothing.  Odd, he thought, glancing over at where Tony had his head dipped down to his chest, shoulders hunched and the phone glued to his ear under a neon sign that formed an arrow and pointed to the restrooms.
And so they planned. Tony had safewords; green for keep going, yellow for give me a minute, and red for stop. If Tony’s mouth was occupied it would be one, two, or three finger snaps. Steve could use as much strength as he wanted, could leave marks, but no permanent injuries, and preferably not a black eye, although Tony emphasized that he did want to be slapped around. Bondage was an enthusiastic yes, and Steve was to ignore any and all struggles and protests from Tony that weren’t the safewords. Jarvis was kept in the loop too, so he could monitor the situation and know it was consensual. Even just planning it had them climbing each other, unable to get enough.
Tony reached across the gearshift and laced his fingers with Steve’s as he sped back towards midtown in his obnoxious and beloved orange Audi, grinning at Steve sideways. If Tony had been standing, he’d be bouncing on his toes in excitement.
Tony looked back up at Steve’s face, and despite Steve’s situation, he still flushed delicate pink from his cheeks to his chest, and Tony couldn’t keep up with his own heartbeat to see that Steve’s bravado was still tinged with that thread of shyness. Tony wanted to touch Steve, wanted to lay him back and worship him with his hands, his mouth, his body, his soul, until they became molten and inseparable.
They all followed Dr. Cho to the private waiting area, where there was a large window that overlooked the ICU med bay. Through it, they could see Tony in one of the beds with the curtain only partially drawn. He looked desperately small and frail bundled in bandages and blankets, surrounded by wires and IV bags and beeping monitors.
Steve had growled when Tony gasped slightly too loudly, and Tony had almost fallen to the ground when Steve let him go. When he emerged from the corridor, he looked a little rumpled and flushed and had to tuck his boner in his waistband, but Steve was all laughs at a table, toasting a glass of champagne with a SHIELD agent in a lovely blue dress that fit her like a gossamer second skin. Steve shot Tony a possessive, undressing look at Tony over his champagne glass, and Tony thought maybe Natasha was giving them a look, but she was whispering in Thor’s ear and hiding a smile behind a wine glass when Tony glanced over.
Tony, how much did this cost? I can’t accept- I can’t afford-“ Steve stammered, embarrassed as he pushed the laptop back at Tony. Tony just pushed it right back.
Tony was crying true tears in earnest now, tears mixing with blood and snot and cum to run disgustingly down his face and chin, and he was distantly aware of his choking sobs echoing in the concrete room filled with hard surfaces. The effect only served to compound the reality of the fantasy, and Tony found himself shaking, trembling as overwhelming sensations ravaged through him. Tony curled on the floor against the wall, barely upright.
Steve treasured those hours spent with Tony. Never mind the fact that Tony must secretly have some rich friends, because suddenly his art was selling right off the walls, and he could hardly bring in new canvasses fast enough (which of course gave him an excuse to spend another evening with Tony ordering takeout and lounging on the couch, while Steve rested his head on Tony’s shoulder and looked at his paintings with a happy smile).
Steve halfway rose out of his chair and turned to stare in shock at the man, just in time to see him pull a gun and fire three shots.
“You act like a whore, and now you look the part,” Steve said cuttingly, and spit on Tony once more. “You can stay here the rest of the fucking night. Maybe tomorrow night too. I don’t have any use for a whore in my bed.”
could have hit me harder. We-“ Tony glanced away, an irritated huff escaping him. “We like it rough sometimes, okay?” Natasha finally seemed to believe him, and nodded.
“Steve, what are you- Steve you’re hurting me!” Tony grunted, trying to push up, but Steve planted his hand on the back of Tony’s neck.
“I never want it to end,” he murmured, captivated, a hand pressed to Steve’s chest, and he could hear Steve’s heart as clearly as he could feel it, echoing through his fingertips. Steve stilled, his eyes closed as though entranced. Tony moved again, unhurriedly. Deliberately.
“Yeah. Yeah, I am,” Steve murmured, his gaze one of complete adoration. “Thank you. It was… It was fun. Like… a lot of fun,” he added, that adoring gaze darkening. Tony shivered in delight.
Steve was humbled as Natasha and Sam nodded their agreement, and he felt an overwhelming surge of emotion.
“I’ve never seen your smile so shy, I felt so small compared to how much you loved me. Tony, it was the happiest day of my life.” Steve was sniffling again. “I just need you to come back to me, sweetheart. We’ll get through this together, and you’ll be all better, and… and maybe we can share this with our friends, too…” Steve wiped his face, closing his eyes. “God, Tony, I love you so much. I love you so that I can’t breathe when you’re not around. I love you, I love you,
“Sorry, family only,” the paramedic in charge said firmly, planting his hand on Steve’s chest as soon as he made to climb into the ambulance. Steve gave him a withering look that could melt an iron girder, his mouth in a tight line of false calm.
“Nat, put the fucking gun down, now,” Tony said in a low, deadly voice, and she looked at him finally, her eyes raking over his body, naked and covered in welts and fluids. Instead, she looked at Steve levelly.
This was unexpected, and Tony felt a little spike of fear. Playing in their own home was one thing, but playing in the rest of the tower, where the others lived?
“The security fields I had you disable are for the utility room on the 88th floor, east wing. Everything around it is still secured, and Jarvis is there, too. I thought it’d be fun to get a little… creative,” he said, and Tony smiled, letting his head fall back in a bit of relief.
“This is correct, Ms. Romanoff. I have been monitoring the situation, and am ready to alert prearranged help if the parameters that Sir and Captain Rogers have set are exceeded,” he said, emphasizing the “prearranged” part to indicate that they already knew who to call if they needed help, and it sure as hell wasn’t Natasha. She was quiet now, and looked around the room at the conveniently available towel and fleece blanket spilling out of the bag, the bottles of water, the pre-cut cables coiled in a “haphazard” pile, the discreetly hidden first aid kit behind the bag, and she finally looked at Tony with absolute mortification.
“About seven years ago. It started as a hobby. My friend Pepper insisted that I needed something to occupy my time. Then I discovered that my coffee addiction turned into something of a coffee passion,” Tony said, sipping his own black coffee. Steve laughed softly.
“Tony? What is it?” Steve asked, his brow furrowed and his tone completely changed, back to his gentle, loving self.
“Mm, so much for swimming laps,” Tony teased softly, letting his head drop back against Steve’s shoulder, pressing back against him when Steve scraped his teeth lightly over the curve of Tony’s throat, his lips chasing the waves of goosebumps that skittered over Tony’s shoulder.
It hadn’t even happened in a battle. It hadn’t happened while Tony swooped gracefully through the sky, golden repulsors slicing through the air like lightning as he fought to keep people safe. It hadn’t happened while Steve struggled with the enemy on the ground and worried constantly about seeing a red and gold streak free-falling to the pavement below.
“Hey, don’t try to speak, sweetheart, you have a concussion. You’re going to be fine, but you’re pretty roughed up. You just need a lot of rest,” Steve said, quick to reassure Tony. Tony’s eyes drifted in and out of focus, and he squeezed Steve’s hand weakly.
“You know, I was serious about fixing your computer,” Tony said, his previous banter gone. He laid a hand on Steve’s wrist. “I mean it. I don’t want anything in return. I just want to help. As a friend,” he said, and looked down at his own knee. “As maybe more than a friend.” Steve just stared, his wrist positively pulsing with heat from Tony’s hand.
“My phone is in the car, and I muted Jarvis so we wouldn’t be interrupted. Tell her, J,” Tony said wearily, realizing how dry his mouth was. He felt downright dehydrated.
“I loved it. Thank you. You’re gonna have to kiss these welts better though, seems like you gave both me and Nat a heart attack with that little trick,” Tony teased, letting Steve lovingly feed him bites of donut and sips of water, and then cupped Steve’s cheek, looking at his gorgeous eyes with those illegally long lashes. “Are you all right?”
It was deeply intimate, quietly reverent, and profoundly comforting for Steve to pray over Tony. He was grateful that the nurses didn’t bother him, and he ignored their friends, hoping they would understand his need for privacy in this moment. He knew Tony might scoff if he saw Steve, but his eyes would be soft and grateful. After all, Steve had overheard Tony in more than one desperate moment with the Our Father on his lips.
me for dancing with a few people? Jesus Steve, flirting is practically my damn job!” And then Steve was on him, with three hard, brutal slaps across the face that left Tony dizzy enough that he went pliant as Steve flipped him onto his chest, tugged his pants further down, and kicked his thighs apart.
Tony, was his name. As in, Tony’s Coffee, the best coffee shop in the goddamned world. With its squashy chairs that encouraged customers to linger, rather than hurry in and out with their orders. Tony’s Coffee, with its fair-trade beans and shiny red and gold enameled, in-house roaster behind a window where everyone could see and smell. Tony’s Coffee, as in the place where Steve went almost every day to write, and more often than not, gaze surreptitiously at his muse behind the counter.
“Tony, I don’t- thank you, thank you so much, this is just- I don’t know, one of the kindest things anyone has ever done for me, I mean, I really mean it, you’re saving my-“ Steve mumbled against Tony’s shoulder, only trailing off when Tony’s arms wrapped around him tightly, and he kissed Steve’s temple lightly.
real, but real enough and the pain wasn’t pretend and Tony almost came right that moment. His howl twisted into a garbled plea for help, but the breath was pushed out of his lungs as Steve thrust into him, fucking him brutally. Tony’s breaths were forced grunts, and he couldn’t get away, his body completely pinned by all 235 solid pounds of Steve’s muscle, a hand on the back of his neck, and a hand on his hip, both of which were going to leave some spectacular bruises.
“Seriously, where do you get these sayings? You’re such an old man. Here,” he said, pulling a laptop out from behind his back, a big blue bow stuck to the case. Steve’s eyes went wide and he tossed his bag on a chair so he could hold the laptop as delicately as if it were made of spun glass.
“I’m sorry to interrupt, Captain, I have to ask you to step out while we check Mr. Stark’s bandages, he said gently. Steve nodded stiffly, not wanting to leave Tony’s side. He kissed Tony’s hand again and laid it on the bed, then gave him one more kiss on the forehead before stepping out of the ICU med bay.
The trust that Tony had in Steve to do this, and do it right, safely, respectfully, was immense. It wasn’t even until they’d been together quite a while that Tony felt comfortable enough to be tied up or held down, to give up complete control. He’d never trusted anyone else enough to allow that before. Of course, once that bridge of trust had been built, Tony realized he loved it. He loved letting Steve decide for him, loved letting Steve lavish him with pleasure (and the occasional delight of pain) while Tony was helpless to do anything else but moan and lose himself in the hazy indulgence of being the sole focus of every atom of Steve’s radiant love for him.
“Tony, are you all right? I could hear you down the hall, sweetheart,” Steve said at that moment when the door kicked open, then shouted in alarm to see Natasha, then shouted again and dropped the water bottles and what looked like a box of donuts when Natasha put herself between him and Tony. She had her gun pointed at Steve, whose hands were in the air, pants falling open around his hips, as Tony shouted and tried to kick the gun out of Natasha’s hands, his own hands still bound.
It was hours. Steve didn’t move a muscle the whole time. Dr. Cho finally came out well after the windows had gone black with night. She wore a grim expression, and Steve’s heart skipped a beat as he shot out of his chair, his stiff back popping like firecrackers. The others were close behind.
” he mumbled desperately. Did he just lose his entire fucking novel? Was his beast of a laptop finally dead? Dammit, he couldn’t afford another, he couldn’t afford the repair costs, he couldn’t afford-
Blood bloomed from a place in his chest, his shoulder, and horrifyingly, his throat. Tony’s eyes were wide and stunned, and immediately locked to Steve’s. His hand was clamped to his throat, blood pouring freely between his fingers, face contorted in horrifying shock, then pain and fear. Then everything moved too fast.
“Definitely the most serious. The bullet nicked the carotid artery, which supplies blood to the brain. His CT came back clean, so I’m confident that we were able to fix it before it could cause irreversible brain damage, although he may be a little fuzzy-headed for awhile, and probably won’t remember much of the incident. The blood loss was significant, and combined with a mild concussion and the broken tibia, he’s going to be laying in bed for quite awhile healing up.” Dr. Cho gave Steve a small, reassuring smile and squeezed his shoulder. “I know it sounds bad, but I really do think that soon enough the worst thing he’ll be dealing with is the abject boredom of bed rest,” she said.
“Ah-ah, family only, teammates don’t count,” Dr. Cho said. “He’s only just come out of surgery, and he’s too weak to have you all crowding around him.” Natasha took Steve’s hand to pull him back, but he yanked it out of hers.
Tony dropped his head forward again, his breath coming in shallow waves, and he slowed, backing away from the precipice; even the tiniest movement would throw them both mercilessly over the edge.
“What’s got you shining like St. Peter at the pearly gates this morning?” Steve asked, and Tony rolled his eyes, grinning.
“Oh I’m fine, just my piece of shit laptop is having an existential crisis again and I might have just lost my novel,” Steve said, flipping it over and popping the battery out and back in, just in case, but with no luck. Tony watched with curiosity, before laying a hand on Steve’s laptop and calming Steve’s frantic movements.
“You’re welcome. Now get to work. I want to hear all about what you didn’t write by the end of the day,” Tony said with a smirk, and headed back behind the counter. Steve stared after him for a full minute, before realizing he was in big, big trouble. Writing smut about Tony was one thing, and flirting with him was another.
Steve had Tony’s hand pressed to his lips now, and was murmuring warm memories into his calloused skin, when Tony’s fingers twitched and Steve’s head shot up. Tony’s eyes were open. Bleary, but watching Steve with those same soft eyes and the tiniest smile.
“Steve, we saw the footage; no one could have seen that coming. It had already happened before anyone could even turn in their seat to look,” she said firmly, which only made Steve choke on a ragged breath.
When he pulled away, he kept Tony’s hand in his and continued to talk to him, sweet memories of their first “real” date, and almost getting caught making out in the gym locker room, and the stupid and precious flower crowns that Jarvis had surreptitiously ordered from a florist for Steve and Tony’s wedding, when Tony had told him they were skipping town to get married upstate.
One day when Steve came in the shop, Tony beamed at him like a kid at Christmas, and Steve was unable to hold himself back from giving Tony a warm hug as a greeting, letting Tony’s infectious smile brighten his own face.
Immediately the mood lightened marginally. The others murmured in relief, making plans to take turns keeping Tony entertained while he healed, and to have Rhodey step in for Iron Man while Tony was grounded. They bitched roundly about the press and paparazzi already gathered around the hospital, waiting for them like vultures to catch a soundbite. Steve was silent through it all, staring at his laced fingers and white knuckles, until Sam nudged his shoulder good-naturedly.
“Anything for my best customer,” Tony murmured, his cheek resting against Steve’s blond hair for a long moment, before he pulled himself away. Steve let go reluctantly, clearing his throat and looking at his feet and the table and the gelato freezer, and finally Tony’s eyes.
“At least three more times,” he said, so sweetly, so gently, that Tony lowered himself until their chests were flush.
“Um. Me too,” he said lamely, but couldn’t take his eyes of Tony’s. “I really appreciate you doing this for me.” Tony seemed closer, and Steve liked it, and subtly shifted closer himself. They were touching from shoulder to ankle, and Steve liked how his smaller body nestled against Tony’s, fitting against him like they were designed as a pair. Tony’s lips were dangerously close, and Steve couldn’t pull his eyes away from them.
“Go the fuck upstairs. Wait for me in the living room. I cannot believe how you acted tonight, the way you pretended I was just some hired escort and not your fucking husband. Do you know how embarrassing that is? Jesus, Tony,” Steve said, his voice growing hard, and Tony’s heart really did skip a couple beats, it was so believable.
When Steve finally, blessedly brushed a fingertip in just the right way over Tony’s slit, Tony came, a white-hot moment that transcended this plane of being, only to turn him inside out and resettle inside him like a spirit coming home. He hardly made a sound, his body taut and spasming, just soft, shallow gasps and the delicate, wet sounds of Steve’s gentle movements inside him, filling the languorous air. And just as Tony opened his eyes to look at Steve, to luxuriate in his attention, Steve’s lips parted, he breathed Tony’s name, and he came, filling Tony and never once looking away.
she said, and Tony sighed, gently pushing her hand away before she could brush the hair off his face.
“Or maybe you like to come in every single day, rain or shine, and steal glances at a certain barista? I mean, I am sweet, very much so, so I don’t blame you for your sweet tooth.”
Steve patted Tony’s cheek a little too hard, leaving a smear of blood against his unnervingly white skin, but Tony’s eyes blurred and rolled up. Steve’s breath came too fast, his heart racing too loud, adrenaline making him shaky as the panic poured over him like icy water.
Tony’s breath went out of him in a rattling cough, and then Steve was there, standing over him with his cock in his hand, holding him down with one foot on Tony’s shoulder. Steve looked down at Tony possessively as he stroked himself, then with a muttered curse, came all over Tony’s face, getting great white spurts in Tony’s eyes and hair and chest where his shirt had ripped, and in his open mouth as he gasped for air. Tony closed his eyes, a vague sense of shame washing over him at just being an object to cum on, not even in. Steve just tucked himself back in and stood over Tony with a sneer.
“And I was able to save your entire hard drive, see? It’s all right here,” Tony said as he tapped a key, and the screen changed and there were all of his desktop icons where they belonged, with a new wallpaper that made Steve smile like an idiot. It was that selfie that Tony took of the two of them on the couch, both of them looking stupidly happy. Steve looked at Tony in awe, then launched himself at him and hugged him like an octopus.
“Please… Steve, I can’t take any more, I’m so sorry, I promise I’ll be good… Please don’t hurt me anymore…” Tony mumbled, his voice a cracked, broken thing, still wet with barely-dried sobs, but Steve said nothing. He heard a whispered curse, but nothing else. He fully jumped when he felt a gentle touch comb through his hair, and sucked in a sharp, fearful breath. While part of it was for the game, the other part was genuine startle, his body still prickling with energy and hyper-sensitivity.
Steve just stared. The screen resolution was incredible, and the mountain vista on the screen looked real enough to fall into. The keyboard was backlit with a shifting rainbow of soft light. He was stupidly focused on the fact that there was a touch pad like any other normal laptop, rather than a roller ball like on his ancient beast. He couldn’t comprehend the words that were coming out of Tony’s mouth. It was another language, right up until his last sentence. Steve looked up at Tony with wide eyes.
“I don’t want another word out of you,” Steve growled, going to Tony and hauling him up on his knees by the hair, gripping his jaw with the other. Tony scrabbled at the hand in his hair, trying to get his balance under him, but Steve kept him stumbling. “You acted like a fucking slut all night long, so I’m going to treat you like a fucking slut. Now open,” Steve said as he unzipped his pants and pulled out his already granite-hard cock, but Tony pressed his lips together with a strained sound, trying to turn his face away. Steve slapped his cheek sharply, and it startled a gasp out of Tony, and Steve took the opportunity to jam his thumb against Tony’s cheek to force it between his teeth and get his jaw open wider. When it was open enough, he thrust his fingers in Tony’s mouth, shoving them across his tongue until he gagged.
Well if that wasn’t the goddamned truth, Steve thought, already writing that saucy wink into a scene.
“No, old man, the internet isn’t finite,” he teased, then set a very large, very frothy drink in front of Steve, with Steve’s name written on the cup in neat block lettering.
It wasn’t even Avengers business. Tony was releasing the patent on one of his most promising developments in sustainable green energy into the public domain. It was an unprecedented move, but Tony was adamant that this project was about helping people and preserving what they had left of their planet. It was about rebuilding destroyed cities and bringing together scattered families, not about making a profit.
“Okay, wait, so…you’re saying that intel, the information that kept me from becoming Lot’s wife out there, came from my stripper-fake-husband?” Tony demanded, sitting up on the bed and catching his reflection in the mirror.  His face was ashen in the darkness of the room and the hand that clutched the phone was white-knuckled.  Bleached bones, Tony thought and felt a shiver run down his spine and coil low in his stomach, cold seeping through his skin.

“You see strength and beauty and purpose in what I would see as damaged and broken,” Tony said into Steve’s skin, his lips ghosting warm breath against Steve’s chest. “You always have. You loved me when I was no one and when I was someone you should by rights have despised. I see you the same way, but I need you to let me, Steve. I would show you, if you will but let me. Let me love you as you do me. That is all I ask. Please, Steve. Let me. I need you to let me, Steve, please. Please.”
Before Steve could muster a reply, Tony cuts quick- "and these will probably heal quick but I don't know about that.", Tony gestures at Steve's bandaged sternum.
"By the time I was 23, I was married. That's when I decided to put a stop to it. That and also me coming home one night and throwing up on the carpet in front of guests. Well, they were Steve's friends so not so much as MY guests but, yea.... Cleaning that thing cost a fucking fortune, that thing was a Persian!"
Steve managed to break his captured left arm free and ruffled his hand through the other person's hair, carding through the strands with his fingers and lightly brushing the scalp with his nails in small to-and-fro circular motions. The person let out a small moan at his ministrations before nuzzling their head into Steve's chest, like a cat being stroked and purring in response.
My dumbass keeps sayin I have a block but then I whoop up some shit like this. I'm just not going to give you false hope anymore but I will try and update as frequently as I can.
Steve's heart begins thudding in his chest as he brushes off his thoughts. He runs back to the room and picks up his phone to dial Tony's number and clutches the phone to his ear, desperate.
When you guys had Peter, he was on top of the fucking moon and he promised that he would never ever drink again because he's got a family now. He's got responsibility to deal with."
Steve would always coddle Tony with kisses or hugs whenever he felt like this or he would plop Tony down in his lap, as he ran his big, beautiful hands all over Tony's body, licking into him so seductively it would send fireballs shooting through Tony's spine.
The figures arm lies across Steve's midsection and he feels a hot rise of shame jog through him, paralleling lust and heartache.
"We went on a date. Yes, yes, it's true, don't freak out! We went out on Sunday and well it's been a few days and he hasn't called back so I'm just....."
The other man's hand was clutched tight at Steve's shoulders, the left being a prosthetic metal one which looked rather brilliantly crafted as his waist was pressed flush to Steve's naked chest. His head was thrown back and his mouth was agape, long strands of hair falling from his skull. The blonde was peppering the other man's chest with kisses, his tongue flicking over a nipple as his hands were clasped tightly at the small of the other man's back.
His lungs constrict and his chest hurts, the scar left by the shield on his sternum stings; it's stitches ready to cut off and let the blood flow once more. His chest was always sensitive and now, it's even more so. He draws a hand to the spot and presses upon it, to reduce the pain and winces upon contact as he wheezes slightly for air, muffling the noises escaping his stringy vocal chords.
He closes his eyes and holds them shut. That deep voice calls out to him for his attention but every time he hears it, even in his own head, all he can seem to do is cry. Or scream. Or want to throttle the owner. Or just want to claw himself from the inside out and squash his brains with his own hands. He's heard it too many times in his recent nightmares, ringing with a sense of doom loomimg about his head in the form of a shield and a bionic prosthesis that want to take his worthless life and cast him to hell.
Tony grabs a few more tufts and soaks them in more spirit, all the while telling Steve to apply pressure to the wound.
Bucky gets up and clasps his hand on either side of Steve's face, his eyes streaked with tears before he presses a deep kiss to his face. Steve just blinks back at him, at a loss for words.
The robot turns and almost starts to whirr in excitement but Steve just shushes it with a finger and it stops.
The soldier didn't bother to respond as he continued to lay kisses all around the smaller man's nape and travel upwards, licking behind his ear and then nipping the earlobe with soft bites. He nuzzled his beard into Tony's shoulder, sending moans and gasps shooting out of the genius's mouth as Steve continued his god-awfully amazing ministrations.
