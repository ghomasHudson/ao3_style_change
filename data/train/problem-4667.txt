“Fine,” Hayden sighs dramatically. “We’ll just see how it goes in rehearsal today.”
a conversation like this before, or this was the sort of childish back and forthing they typically did was unknown to him. It certainly didn’t help that he was swinging his legs back and forth like a child as he sat on a desk right next to Charlie’s.
” Hayden says. “He gives like no partial credit whatsoever and most of the answers aren’t even on the slideshow!”
Another worthy partial credit answer, another X marked on the page.
and no one can judge me,” Dean frowns. “There is gonna be a fuck ton of more people.”
“I’m a creature of habit,” Dean says, and squirms a bit in his chair. “So sue me.”
“Yeah, everything’s good,” Dean grins. “The greenhouse didn’t burst into flames or anything and the money’s on lockdown at the office.”
“Charlie likes to kidnap my horse every other day,” Dean explains and goes over to give Cas a hug.
“Yeah,” Dean keeps scrubbing at one particular spot on the floor but nods.
“But I
"Technically the practice of placing your textbook under a pillow to study through osmosis does not work," Cas informs his colleague. "You can learn through osmosis by surrounding yourself with the material you wish to learn. Such as moving to Spain to speak and practice Spanish."
Dean probably would have calmed down at that point...
“Oh come on! It was a good one!” the drama teacher giggles. Dean rolls his eyes but can’t help but laugh as well. “Thanks Dean. Again, I’m really sorry for being so pushy at the beginning.”
Strike one.
“But no,” Dean finally says with a shake of his head. “No, I don’t regret anything.” He smirks and gives Cas a subtle wink through the dark. “Sure helped me get to know you better.” Cas’ eyes widen a bit and then he looks down at the seat between them. Dean is chuckling until he looks down as well.
himself to think that four letter L word… that word still made him feel nervous. And if he
"Because he just--wait… your
“Dean,” she says very quietly. “That was very adorable and I’m happy that you two are happy in love.”
“It’s bad isn’t it?” a deep sigh echoes in the room. Dean looks up and sees Mr. Novak leaning forward with two fingers to his temples.
Dean’s type when it came to men. Dark hair, five o’ clock shadow, and bright blue eyes as an added bonus to the small checklist. Normally, Dean had no problem building up the courage to go up to the cute guy, or girl, at the bar to flirt a little and then ask for their number. Something about Mr. Novak was just different though. Words just… didn’t work.
more difficult than I had expected and so I just--”
” Charlie wrinkled her nose in disgust.
“That’s true!” Claire perks up. “So maybe that means I don’t have to come in tomorrow after all!”
“Thank you for the reminder, Dean.”  Dean nods once and adjusts the stack of quizzes in front of him.
“Alright, where’s MacCormack?” Gabriel shouts in his chosen actor voice. Ben Braeden, the student playing Ren MacCormack, immediately hides behind leading lady Patience Turner. “You’re gonna have to learn that in Bomont a stop sign means stop!”
“That’s… That’s very kind of you to offer,” Mr. Novak sighs. “But I would hate to burden you with my incompetence as a teacher.”
“Ms. Bradbury then.”  Soda sprays out of Dean’s mouth and onto the floor like the whale splashes the audience at SeaWorld. Fortunately, he hadn’t soiled any of the student’s work, but that didn’t stop Cas from pulling the stack of essays closer to himself.
“Cas?” he says quietly. There is no response. Dean swallows a bit as he closes the door behind him. He hovers over the other teacher for a moment, until he hears a loud sniff. He gently places his hand on Cas’ shoulder.
“Say what now?” Dean swivels around at the name drop. Charlie was halfway to the door, but stopped and coyly looked back.
“...well she’s not wrong,” he grumbles. Claire smirks and pushes the poinsettia closer to Dean.
"No he doesn’t,” Hayden scoffs. “Did you see the last worksheet he gave us? Half of the answers were in a completely different chapter! And if he was a good teacher, then the class would be easier. But it’s not. It’s freaking hard and he doesn’t do anything to help. He just keeps going on about stupid stuff that doesn’t make any sense!”
"But, Charlie--"
“Are you unsure of what care a poinsettia needs?” Cas asks.
Mr. Novak smiles at him. A genuine smile. And it doesn’t stop just there. He lets out a small chuckle. Dean lets out his own nervous chuckle and rubs the back of his neck. An eight-bit version of the “Game of Thrones” theme begins playing from Charlie’s phone, and the student stage manager calls for everyone to get back to their seats. Mr. Novak excuses himself and Dean stupidly waves him good-bye.
Strike three. Dean’s out.
"Yes.”  The silence falls heavy between them. “After I was informed that I was being transferred from my first school, it was Gabriel who told me that Mrs. Butters was retiring and that I should request to come here. It’s thanks to him that I received the position in the first place."
“Please?”
“I’m glad you were able to find the classroom,” Mr. Novak comments as he walks into the door on the left. “Many students get lost the first few days.”
The only bright side to all of this was that Charlie had been placed on the first bus with Cas. So if she was going to talk to him about not quitting, that would be the time to do it. He could only hope she would be able to talk some sense into him when Dean failed to do so.
“I see,” Cas finally sighs, a little slump to his shoulders. “So it
” Cas raises a curious eyebrow at Dean.
“I’ll be sure to tell
“Footloose,” Charlie beams.
“Thanks,” Cas mutters, a slight pink growing on his cheeks.
“I’ll explain more next week,” Charlie waves off and then hugs Dean once more. “You’re a lifesaver Dean!” She hurries out the door in excitement, only to return a few seconds later to say, “I love you!”
“Good night Dean,” Cas whispers, and then exits the car.
“Oh well,” Charlie shrugs, interrupting Dean’s trip down memory lane. “Too bad you’re not interested at all in the show.” Dean jumps from his seat and blocks her from exiting the door.
“Y...yes, but--”
“Blocking?” Dean blinks.
“Dean!”  Dean grumpily looks over to Charlie who is waving him over to a seat in the front row. “You’re gonna sit with the rest of the leads up here!” The distance education teacher sulks over to his assigned seat.
"It's actually
Now, Dean understands Cas' silence. Even though Dean thought he was helping, it was clear that Cas still had a storm of doubt and fear raging in his mind.
“I see,” Cas says. “So it's more of a matter of helping your friend out despite having stage fright than a motive of potential partnership.”
“Yeah well it’s not fun for us teachers either,” Dean grumbles. “We’re supposed to be the ones in charge.”
off!”
“I can’t do this anymore Dean,” he whispers. “I quit.”
“But then a student went missing and… and I thought I was going to lose my job. The moment I started thinking that maybe I do want to keep trying because I love it, it felt almost like it was being torn away from me. Like, the universe was granting my bitter wishes before I realized it was a mistake to think that way. Going from determination to utter despair… It was a lot. And even though I'm glad she is safe and nothing happened… I still feel scared.
“...I don’t know,” Dean sighs with a slump to his shoulders. Garth nods and gives him a gentle pat on the arm. As soon as the school’s parking lot comes into view, Dean becomes antsy.
“Thank you,” Cas mumbles with a slight blush. “I could always… attempt to make one for you as well, if you’d like.”
“So… basically the power point is the answer?” Dean asks. The other teacher nods. “You know, it’s just a month into the school year. Kids will probably pick up on this really quick.”
Cleaning up is not all that tedious or difficult. Claire and Jack put away the advertisement signs and Dean counted out the money in the cashbox. They’re having another look through the greenhouse for any stray objects, when Dean finds a lone poinsettia hidden under a table.
“Dean!” Cas gasps as Dean hisses in pain. “I’m so sorry! This is all my fault! It just didn’t feel right for us to leave it like that and Gabriel had insisted that I knew what I needed to do. So I thought ‘what the hell’ and thought that kissing you was ‘what I needed to do.’ But now I see that this is just turning into a huge mess and you’ve been hurt and are possibly upset by me now and--”
Dean checks the answer key.
“Any ideas on how to save the flowers?” Dean asks.
“I am being very serious Dean,” Charlie responds. “Like, Vulcan serious. He showed up to my room after I made that announcement in the faculty meeting and signed up. I think he’s looking to make some new friends outside of Gabe.” Dean’s eye twitches slightly at the name. “And like rehearsals take a lot of time and work. There’s choreography to learn, and lines to memorize, singing parts to practice--
“Charlie?!” Dean gags. Cas abandoned his seat to gather up paper towels for clean up. Dean immediately drops down to the floor to help. “Dude that’s even
“...yeah but Sammy might be,” Dean sighs and closes the script. “I should have known better than to tell him so soon.” He scratches at a weird brown stain that had been on the cover of the script since he first got it. “And anyways… it feels a little hypocritical if I’ve been telling Cas not to quit something he’s good at and then turn around and do the exact same thing.”
if you’d get off your phone for five seconds,” Adam grumbles, maybe hoping no one else hears it. Hayden turns to him with a slight glare.
"Yes," Cas mutters. Dean had sort of expected Cas to exit quickly, but he remained seated and silent.
So he keeps singing. Singing like he's alone in his car. Or he's jamming along to the radio in his kitchen. At the chorus, he decides to take a risk and look at Cas again. Cas looked starstruck. Maybe even a bit smitten.
“I told him not to wear those,” Cas groans. “I specifically begged him last night to not bring those monstrosities in.”
keeps forgetting to check,” Adam scowls and then mutters “Hayden” under his breath. Dean notices that Cas looks up and he can’t help but wonder if he just stopped himself from rolling his eyes.
semester so the kids had no fucking clue what any of the material was. Most of the kids didn’t even know until the report cards came out, and then came the angry phone calls from the parents. Not for the sub though. For Cas, because when they all found out what happened, that’s when he was feeling better and came back.”
“Did you ask Gabe?” Dean tries to say the Mythology/English teacher’s name with as little venom as possible. “I’m sure he’d leap at the chance to ditch his classroom and hang out with you.”
would be the perfect time to kiss. He knows it. A part of him wants to argue that it was still rather unclear if Cas felt the same way or not, but they were (kind of) holding hands for Pete’s sake! And Dean just worked through his insecurities and fears of singing in front of complete strangers. He could handle the anxiety of the unknown of how Cas felt. And what better way to let things known than with--
“Not unless someone else buys him,” Claire says. “Like, somebody in this room who has a special someone to give it to…” Jack and Claire have matching smirks on their faces as they look at Dean.
Dean opens his mouth, ready to decline the plant again, but then he starts thinking. He thinks back on Dr. Garth who bought a couple of flowers two hours ago and how he couldn’t stop gushing about how excited his wife Bess would be. He thought about Charlie buying a pot a few minutes before their last customer and how she couldn’t wait to give them to her girlfriend. Then he thinks about Cas, and he begins to imagine the cute look of surprise on his face if Dean were to say… hand him a poinsettia…
“...so--”
“I’m tired Dean,” she sighs. “Not stupid.”
to admit that to himself… then it was just going to make Cas leaving hurt a lot more. For now, he would be fine in calling Cas a friend and he was thankful for that. At least he had something with him. Even if it was just friendship.
“You’re welcome,” Charlie whispers, and slaps the script hard against Dean’s chest.
Well, he never actually
“Pleeeeeeeeeeeee--”  Dean turns his chair away from Charlie’s elongated plea. It takes a couple of loud sips from his mug before Charlie runs out of air. It’s quiet, aside from that one LED light that flickers on and off (yeah he should really call somebody for that), and suddenly Charlie stands up and places both hands firmly on the desk.
“These quizzes were taken at the end of the day,” Mr. Novak grumbles. “After the presentation I gave.” Dean winces with a soft “oooh…”
“I told you he’s looking for more friends outside of Gabe.” (Push.)
“Uhh… yesh?” Dean responds through squished cheeks. Brown tired eyes narrow in slight suspicion.
“Not usually,” Mr. Novak doesn’t bother looking up from his grading. “Since I have the door closed during class. I’ve also grown accustomed to the sound of the greenhouse fans.”
After finding his love and passion for his chosen career once again, Cas took teaching in stride. He split the class time so they would listen to a short lecture in the first half and then go and work on their plant projects in the second half. Cas happily reported to Dean that a lot of the poinsettias had started to thrive thanks to this method. And as far as Dean could tell from the biweekly quizzes he would grade, B’s were becoming the new class average. Of course there were still hurdles Cas had to work through, but he knew where he wanted to be as a teacher and let that drive him to improvement.
“No,” Dean growls and stomps over to the door, plopping himself on the floor to tie up his boots. “I can’t do this Charlie. I’ve been trying for weeks now but I can’t do it. I
“Mr. Novak and I are just good friends,” Dean says and promptly ignores the students in favor of re-counting the money in the cashbox.
Their fingers were touching. Just the tips of their pinky fingers, but it was enough that it sent electricity down Dean’s spine. He did his best to act casual, as though they weren’t touching like this. He tried even harder to control his breathing when he felt Cas shift his finger slightly closer to Dean’s. He completely allowed Cas’ pinky to slide underneath his own. They stare at their interlocked pinkies before looking up at each other.
“Because Gabe’s been chumming it up pretty good with him already.” (Shove.)
“Don’t do it for him,” Charlie looks at him sternly. “Or Sam or me. Do it because you want to.” Dean runs a thumb over the
“Dean,” Mr. Novak nods. “I… I’m afraid I’ve lost complete confidence as a teacher.”
“Yeah,” Dean swallows as he gets ready to burst his bubble. “Yeah they’ll figure it out and just take pictures to use as cheat references for later.” The other teacher groans again and buries his face in his hands. Dean clicks his pen slowly as he tries to work through the answer key for grading.
“C is still passing,” Dean points out. “And it’s not like I’m telling you to teach it
But maybe Charlie was right. Maybe they had happily slid into that stage a long time ago. That stage that involved that four letter L word that…
“That’s what I’ve been told.”
“Right,” he says and picks up the first quiz.
Dean had two options at this point. He could go home after school and have what he would call a typical “chick flick” moment. Eat a whole tub of Rocky Road and cry about how his pitiful crush refused to see him. Or he could say “fuck it” and wait outside of Cas’ office, like the lame love-sick puppy that he was, to finally talk to him.
“Almost Paradise.” The love song for the musical they were in just a month ago.
“In the fall? Won’t they all die?”
Mr. Novak sat two rows behind most of the student ensemble, carefully looking through what looked like a packet. His eyebrows scrunch together in puzzlement before he turns the page and Dean can’t believe such a simple action is making his heart flutter. He also can’t believe that he’s just sitting there by himself. Dean looks to his left and right before taking a deep breath.
“Charlie’s gay. I'm…”  It wasn't that Dean was ashamed of his sexuality anymore. But it had only crossed his mind at this point that Cas could very well be straight and might feel weird about it. His jealousy caused him to assume there was a relationship happening between Gabriel and Cas, but now he felt that he was being delusional.
“Yeah I--”  Dean stops and turns to Cas. “...you got my obscure reference?”
“I’ll just cut my losses and try online dating for once,” Dean shoves again.
“Fine,” she huffs and slides her hands off so they make that squeaking sound. “I guess it’ll just be me and the students getting to know Mr. Novak better this semester.”
“Yeah,” Dean gathers up the wet paper towels to throw away. He doesn’t look up right away, nervous about the sort of face Cas would have. After the discomfort of the wet paper gets too much, he risks it and looks. Cas gives him a sincere smile that immediately feels warm and safe. Dean remembers to breathe again.
"I thought it was adorable," Cas says, then leans forward to meet Dean’s lips. Dean relaxes into the kiss and wonders for the hundredth time how he got so lucky. Lucky enough for this to all work out despite their equally shared awkwardness. With Dean, Cas found confidence and passion once again. And with Cas, Dean found someone he felt comfortable enough to be himself.
When he only focused on Cas, he felt alright. Worries and insecurities simply melted away. The familiar urge to sing begins to overtake the urge to vomit.
He entertains the idea a second too long, because the next thing he knows, the lights have gone down and the high school band has begun the first song. There officially was no escaping it now...
“I-It’s not actually a free period really,” Dean explains as he straightens himself up. “There’s just no students that signed up for that class so it’s just me time.” Confused blue eyes blink at Dean. “But, I-I can still totally help. If you need it or whatever.”
“Of course. It’s part of the curriculum that they grow plants.”
But before his breathing goes out of control again, he feels a gentle hand touch his  shoulder. Dean looks and there’s Cas, smiling. He gives his shoulder a gentle squeeze as he mouths the word “breathe.” Dean immediately does so. The stage manager signals for the Bomont group to get into position. Cas is right next to Dean the entire way until they have to get into their positions.
Don’t think about it Dean.
“After all of this, the angry phone calls and the ticked off kids, Cas just... he just decided today that he’s going to quit teaching.” Charlie lets out a soft “ooh…” of pity. “I tried telling him that shit like this happens all the time but he won’t listen to me. Just got his mind set that he can’t do it anymore and that no matter what he does it’s just gonna fail. I was kind of pissed about it… until I almost walked out right now thinking the same way he did. But with the whole musical stuff.” Charlie hums thoughtfully. “Sorry I almost walked out. We can try to--”
“I know,” Charlie mouths back and flips him off.
“Cas?”  Cas finally looks up at Dean. His eyes were red and shiny.
“So, anyways,” Dean clears his throat and makes his way to the trash bin. “Nothing’s ever gonna happen between me and Charlie. And before you go off and guess I have a crush on Lisa or Mr. Donatello or some other teacher--” The risk of Cas guessing his pointless crush correctly was still there. “--I don’t actually hate singing. I just don’t like singing in front of big groups. It makes me nervous as hell. But Charlie needed some help.”
Charlie smiles at him. “That’s what she said.”
After the show had finished, Patience hosted a student cast party at her place while the teachers met at Charlies for a party of their own. By the time eleven hit, a few teachers decided to move the party to the nearest bar while others decided to head home for the night. Gabe was one of the bar participants, so Cas would need a ride home. Between the double performance they had just done and the extra socializing, Dean was more than happy to offer him the ride.
“I… I suppose I’ll grade them on a curve,” he mutters. “Take the lowest and highest scores and grade them from there.”
Footsteps thud from inside and a second later Dean comes face to face with a dark skinned woman. Dean blinks in surprise. She looks at the poinsettias in his hands then looks up in suspicion.
As good as Rocky Road sounded at the moment, it would have to wait as Dean had chosen the second option. He waits about twenty minutes before walking to the other side of the school. Sure enough, he finds Cas in his office once again. The difference this time however, is that Cas is not pacing around like a tiger in a zoo or on the phone. This time, Cas is hunched over his desk with his hands covering his face. Dean doesn’t wait for the opportunity to be dismissed again, and cautiously enters the office.
“Seriously?” It was Dean’s turn to blink in confusion.
“...Stop the bus,” he says, standing from his seat and moving towards the doors. The bus driver is about to order him to get back in his seat, but Dean repeats a bit louder, “Stop the bus and let me out!”  The bus stops and Dean immediately storms over to the truck.
…” She looks to Cas.
“What do you say I take the lead and show you around the Enterprise?” Dean had said to the new teacher after the meeting. Mr. Novak’s eyebrows knitted together and his head tilted to one side.
“Well now that I’ve made a dumbass of myself, you don’t have to feel bad for earlier. We’re even now.”
sometimes. After the fifth try, Dean just gave up.
"Maybe you just need a little different approach now," Dean suggests. "You got the PowerPoint down, but you gotta remember that not all kids learn through textbook osmosis."
“Thanks,” Dean replies. They stare at each other a moment longer before walking side by side down the long path.
“I know,” Charlie gives him a smirk. “But you’re just saying that now since Cas isn’t here to overhear that.” Dean groans and Charlie snickers. Great, now he’s thinking and worrying about
“Cassie!” Gabriel chirps as he skips down the aisle to get to them. He plants a boot on top of the chair in front of Cas and grins brightly. “Feel my legs!”
“Do you regret it?” Cas asks. Dean looks at him with a slight head tilt. “You sounded amazing of course--” Dean mutters a bashful “thanks” at the compliment. “--but I know it was still a struggle for you. So… Do you regret doing the show?” Dean puts a finger to his chin in thought.
“You have probably been overwatering the poinsettia,” Cas finishes.
“Think of the children, Charlie!”  Charlie shows her offense at Dean’s comment by gasping dramatically and slapping a hand over her heart. Dean grins innocently. This conversation taking place in Charlie’s classroom after school was sounding all too familiar to Dean. Though, whether it was because they actually
“Awesome,” Dean grins. It’s another couple of minutes of smiling at each other before Cas shyly prompts them to get back to grading again.
cannot sing in front of anyone! No matter how much I try the breathing thing or stretching to ‘loosen me up,’ it’s not working. I’m sorry I wasted your time for so long, but I’m just not cut out for…”  He stops mid lacing as the words start to sink in. Words that were practically identical to words he had heard earlier in the day. Dean closes his eyes and pinches the bridge of his nose. “Sorry.”
“Chicken in the most respectful way Mr. Dean,” Jack says in an attempt to save Claire.
Dean can hear the cast begin to sing the chorus that leads into Dean’s first solo, but his eyes stayed on Cas. The other man’s smile never falters and he mouths another “breathe” for good measure.
“H-Hey Cas,” he tries to keep his tone even and not guilty sounding at all. He takes note that Cas seemed to have hastily thrown on some bright yellow crocs on his feet and a tan oversized trench coat. “D-Did I forget something?”
“Good luck,” Dean mumbles through another bite. “And go home as soon as you’re done ok?”
“That would be such a horrible feeling,” Garth says for the third time. “Just imagining getting a phone call and hearing that my little Gertie went missing.”
“Not like, plant nerd stuff,” Charlie whines. “I’m more into the tech and science of space and fantasy. Not
“Can I help you?” she asks.
"Yeah whatever," Dean grumbles and tries to ignore how hot his face feels. It's quiet again between them. There’s a squeak of leather as Cas slides over into Dean's space. It takes him a moment to realize that Cas was giving him a hug.
“Seriously?” Dean laughs.
“Well,” Cas finally says after a long moment of silence. “I… Thank you for the gift, Dean. It’s beautiful.”
“Y...yeah,” Dean says.
Dean blinks again and then quickly flips through the other quizzes in his stack. He wasn’t sure if he should feel relieved or concerned to see that the students’ answers seemed just as confused as he was beginning to feel.
“Absolutely not!”
“Hayden?” Garth calls out. “Hayden Foster?” A few students look around while one group of boys say “I’m Hayden Foster” in their best falsetto voices.
“Oh no,” Claire deadpans. “Whatever shall I do about the paper for the class I’m not taking?” While Claire wasn’t technically signed up for the class, Dean didn’t really have a problem with her hanging out in his classroom at this time. So long as she stayed quiet and busy and out of the camera’s view, then she was allowed to stay. Dean dismisses the class and as soon as the student seated next to Kaia leaves, Claire jumps up to her girlfriend for a tight hug.
No, the kids seemed pretty confident in letting Dean know that Cas had some sort of interest in him, and Dean certainly felt confident in his feelings towards Cas. Still, it was probably better to assume Cas didn’t feel the same way. Better to be safe than sorry. The dread of not knowing whether this flower would push them into the relationship-zone or completely ruin their friendship slowly started to make Dean double guess everything...
confirmation that Cas did like him in that way (as if the kiss wasn’t enough already). Unfortunately, no more words would come out… but this was a start at least.
“Perhaps,” Cas sighs. “She is one of the leads in the show, and Charlie recently checked all of the lead students’ grades.” Dean hums in understanding and takes a smaller bite.
That became the only thing Dean could focus on for the rest of the day. While he sat in his third and fourth period class, he thought about the possibility of Cas being in love with him. As he drove to his apartment after school, he thought about how there was no way Cas was in love with him. When he drives back to the school for their six o’clock call time, he thinks of all of the times he caught Cas smiling at him and only him. Sitting on a stool while Cassie applied stage make-up on his face, Dean convinced himself that Cas was just being friendly and that Charlie was crazy. By the time the main leads lined up on the stage for their mic checks, Dean had gone back and forth on the “is he-isn’t he?” that he could barely remember his lines.
the one who offered to help run the cash,” she says. Dean sighs, but it’s true. Cas had simply said, “Could you--” and Dean immediately said yes. What he had agreed to was running the cash register while Cas left for a meeting with the university. Mostly to go over the basic requirements and procedures that was expected from Cas as he taught concurrent enrollment the next school year. Dean couldn’t stop from smiling as Cas explained why he would be absent that Friday afternoon. Much like the poinsettias the students were selling, Cas had truly grown as a teacher. And yeah, it still sucked that it was just Dean with Claire and a kid named Jack selling the army of red Christmas flowers for three hours after school… but it was worth it for Cas to keep growing.
Dean Winchester was absolutely in love with Castiel Novak.
Since Hayden was safe and had been found quickly, there was no punishment given to Cas or any of the other teacher chaperones. Hayden was suspended for the rest of the week, not permitted to attend any more field trips for the rest of the school year, and had to write an apology letter to Cas. This caused a larger strain to happen between the student and teacher relationship. She was given permission to transfer out of the class after the semester finished.
“Because,” Dean explains, pulling out his teacher planner from his backpack and pointing to the third week of March. “That’s the week the universities go on spring break. So I go to the Jr. High schools and hype up those kids for distance education. Meaning, I can’t go. And Cas needs there to be a teacher on each bus.”
Somebody in front of him almost stands up, and it brings Dean’s attention to the congregation before him. It was Cas who brought Dean’s focus back from the empty audience. Innocently adjusting his pants in order to sit properly for the number, but it was what Dean needed. Slowly, the theatrical world around Dean began to fade and it was just he and Cas.
“Not in a greenhouse they won’t.”
“Oh... right,” Cas slightly deflates. “I suppose she does have a tendency to talk about Star Trek.”
“Dean is fine,” Dean chuckles. “Getting called Mr. Winchester by other teachers makes me feel pretty old.” Honestly, it made him feel old when students called him that too, so he usually instructed them to just call him Mr. Dean.
“And I’ll grab my car and drive back up to pick you up,” Dean adds.
he’s going to be in this? You’re not just coming up with some bullshit to get me to join?”
“Late change of heart?” Dean suggests.
smile belonging to this gorgeous man be for Dean and Dean alone? How has Cas not gotten tired of Dean and his inability to make words at times? Dean suddenly felt like a nervous mess just like the first time he saw Cas before the school year started. He thought that being an official couple would help with his moments of uncertainty, but no, not really.
"Talk to me, Cas," He says. "You've been quiet the whole time but I can tell you got something on your mind."
“Whoa wait,” Dean smiles and steals a quick glance at the man sitting next to him. “You did other plays before this one?”
“Thank you,” Cas nods and then heads back to the main entrance of the farm.
“I doubt many of you had to transfer from your very first school due to excessive complaints however.”  Dean looks on with sympathy at his crush. “Gabriel had assured me that this school could be my fresh new start but it’s becoming apparent that history is about to repeat itself.” Admittedly, Dean feels himself click his pen a little
"No!" Dean scoffs. Cas keeps staring. "...maybe…" Cas gives a half smile. "...shut up." Dean decides that the quizzes were much more interesting than the chuckling man sitting across from him. This is why Sam tells Dean that it’s better to ask questions than to
“You have your classroom rituals, I have mine,” Dean huffs again.
“Not gonna happen.”
“HEY!” he shouts into the night air. “HOLD ON CAS!”
“We have rehearsal for the musical after school,” Mr. Novak frowns. Dean groans at the reminder. “It did sound like they would mostly be focusing on the student’s choreography at the beginning… so there should be time to potentially continue grading. As long as you’re not needed and it won’t be too much of a bother.”
The energy that buzzed through him when he sang on stage, the thrill of talking with students and watching them get excited about participating in his class were nothing compared to this moment. Just those words sent Dean’s mind shooting off into a million different thoughts, but all of them ecstatic to finally hear it. He doesn’t fight the urge he gets to pull Cas in close and kiss the heck out of him. Cas' lips felt so much better now that they were against his lips and not his teeth. They felt so nice that Dean never wanted to stop kissing him.
"Well at least I got you to smile with my crap singing," Dean wipes a tear from his eye.
staring at them.
“I’m good,” Dean responds with a slightly nervous smile. “Besides, I don’t have a special someone.” Claire and Jack look at each other and then back to Dean with matching doubtful looks. Dean suddenly feels a bit self conscious. “What?”
Fortunately, Cas was getting better at recognizing when Dean’s mind started racing faster than he could keep up. He goes back to meet Dean half way and gives his hand a squeeze, which instantly brings Dean back to a familiar feeling of safety and calm. It's the same sort of feeling Dean gets when he's hanging out with Charlie, or when his mom would sing to comfort him. Cas didn't usually sing, but he didn't have to for Dean to feel it.
“Alright,” he finally says with a small smile. “I… I would really appreciate your help again.” With his brain now
Man if Cas were here…
“No, it’s fine,” Dean shakes his head and tries to figure out whether aquaponics was a watering technique or a straight up water horse.
“I suppose he would,” there’s a hint of annoyance in Cas’ tone. “The only problem I see in asking him is that it would be like bringing another child to the trip.”
“For my behavior last week,” Cas sighs, slowing down their pace even more. “I shouldn’t have shouted at you like that. Especially since you’ve been nothing but kind and helpful to me all this time.” Dean glances down at their hand when he feels Cas’ accidentally bump into his. “It was unfair for me to assume that you wouldn’t understand how difficult it was.”
ume something when you’re not sure…
Speak of the devil… A few seconds later, Cas pushes open the classroom door. Dean thought he looked like a cartoon office man, what with the overwhelmed look on his face while carrying in a large stack of papers and trying to make sure none of them blew away.
"Scared that I'm going to fail again. Scared that I'm just kidding myself and not actually going to be good at this. Scared that I won't actually make a difference to these kids. Still scared… that I'm not good enough…" Cas moves his hand away from Dean's arm and covers his face with it. A moment later, he hears a small sniffle.
For thirty years, Dean Winchester was able to keep his secret talent hidden. Nobody outside of his own family knew about it, and he liked to keep it that way. Not his old college buddies. Not his exes. Not even his best friend.
“I’ve scheduled an appointment with a student’s mother during that time,” Cas says. “She informed me about how frustrated she and her daughter felt about my lack of consideration and willingness to help her daughter raise her grade. Though, if I’m being perfectly frank, this is the
“It’s ok,” Charlie says quietly. “I could sort of tell something was eating at you and making you off.” Dean glares at his half laced boot. “Do you want to talk about it?” He chews on the inside of his cheek deciding whether he wanted to or not.
me?!” Dean chokes.
“Yeah! Don’t they feel awesome!”
"I'm bi."
Rehearsal wasn’t quite what Dean expected. Though, if he were being honest, he had no idea what to expect anyways. As soon as they did a quick roll call, Charlie sent the students in the ensemble off to learn musical parts while she had the main cast read through the script. Fortunately, there was no singing yet. Unfortunately, Dean was becoming more and more overwhelmed with each page and song that they got through. As soon as they get to the intermission and Charlie calls for a break, Dean jumps up and thrusts the script into her face.
Not that it was any of his business, but he had a pretty good idea what that look could have meant… It’s not like he hadn’t been pulling the same thing with a certain agricultural teacher for months.
“Yeah, we went to go check on Bobby John and his flower army before leaving this morning,” Claire says.
“I really should be more patient with him though.”
“Yes, ok. I’ll… do the singing sh--OMF!” Dean is promptly cut off by a tight bear hug.
“Is he patient with you?” Dean raises an eyebrow in suspicion.
“L-like?” Dean sputters. Cas quietly reads the next essay and Dean swears his heart beat is louder than the greenhouse fans across the hall. “Hey you can’t just drop something like that and then ditch the subject!”
“Sorry,” Dean quickly says. “You scared me.”
“...Oh,” Cas says in a tone that Dean doesn't want to try and interpret.
“No! I mean… maybe I’m mad at myself because I…”  His smile falls into a frown as the words get stuck in his throat again. Cas waits but nothing comes out of Dean’s mouth. “Words... don’t freaking work when I’m around you, ok?” He slides his hands down from Cas’ shoulders to his hands. “It drives me friggin nuts but...yeah…”
from what Dean could tell. He sees the shy smile on Ben’s face from the corner of his eye as Patience smiles right at him. When Ben seemed to remember that a teacher was still in the same room, Dean was already pretending to be searching for something in his backpack.
“No problem Cas,” Dean replies with a shrug. They stare at each other for another moment before Dean turns to the door.
Strike two.
that sounded. Days before they went on their planetarium date, Dean practiced asking the question any chance he got. Cas hadn’t even said hello before Dean just blurted it out. To Dean’s joy, Cas agreed. They still hadn't quite dropped the "I love yous," yet, but Cas continued to assure Dean that his actions let him know.
time her daughter has expressed any sort of honest concern about her grade in the class.”
He fidgets with the stripe tie around his neck as the kids belt out the chorus. With each passing note, with each line being said and each foot step stamping out the choreography, Dean could feel his heart pounding harder and harder against his chest.
“Is everything alright?” Cas asks once he replaces Kali at the door and allows Dean to enter.
“Uhhh no reason,” Dean lies. Cas narrows his eyes slightly, in the way that still makes Dean think he’s trying to read his mind.
you to focus!” she says and her hands squeeze his cheeks a little. “Are you absolutely certain that you are going to be ok to sing these next few nights?”
“Oh shoot!” Charlie jumps out of her seat and rushes to Cas. "Sorry Cas, your printer and the copy office's printer have nearly identical names!" Dean takes the opportunity to slip past them and retrieve the item he had initially come to the classroom for. It wasn’t difficult to find since Charlie always placed it in the same spot. He smiles at Cas, who was helping to divide up the fliers to the three students, then smiles down at his gift.
Dean shrugs. “If it wasn’t for you, I would still be tripping all over myself in trying to talk to Cas.”
“Whoa, whoa, whoa!” Dean holds his hands up. “Y...you’re
“Cas,” Dean reaches out and places a hand on the rambling man’s arm. “You’re talking faster than the speed of light.”
“This isn’t a ship, Mr. Winchester,” he said slowly. Crap, they were on a last name basis. “That’s not even the mascot of the school.”
“Oh,” Cas says, looking up at Dean with curious eyes. “I… yes, I suppose poinsettias are lovely for this season.” He takes the small pot and Dean tries to ignore the fact their fingers brushed against one another. “Thank you Dean.”
To say things went back to normal after the field trip would have been an understatement.
“Got it. So you’re just going to have them grow a bunch of daisies for their final project or something?”
It was near impossible for Dean to pretend to be asleep after that. A few students came up to ask what was going on, but were quickly sent back to their seats by the bus driver’s yelling. Dean then had to assure the students that everything was fine, but he could tell they didn’t believe him. Fortunately, Garth didn’t go into more dental stories, but the conversation wasn’t necessarily helping to ease Dean’s worry.
“SWEET LORD OF THE RINGS!” Charlie throws her hands up in exasperation. “It is just walking people! How do we keep forgetting the choreography for
“And our leaves aren’t crispy,” Claire points out. “They’re actually wilting which
“Not at this time, no,” Mr. Novak replies, once again not looking up from his grading. Dean nods and slowly marks an X over the number. He moves on to the next question.
“Oh no,” he almost whispers and quickly exits the bus. Dean quickly follows. Charlie and another parent chaperone from the second bus wait to hear Cas’ response. “She’s not in there either.” Charlie’s eyes snap over to Dean and he shakes his head. “We’ll just follow the protocol we discussed. I will stay here and look for her while the rest of you get the students back to the school.”
“Well in that case, I’m

a date. Obviously, he had lied to himself and now had to deal with the heavy disappointment weighing down his heart.
“Yeah, and at least he sort of acts like he knows what he's doing now," Claire chimes in.
“Deaaaaan!” Charlie whines as Dean swings open the door. It’s a humble little room that’s used for distance education class. A large television sits front and center of the room with rows of seats in front of it for the students. On the one side of the wall is the board with the fancy fonted “Distance Education” letters, with the college schedule for the students, and another whiteboard with upcoming dates to remember, as well as the quote and song of the day. Opposite of that wall is Dean’s desk, the only place he felt comfortable enough to make his own.
It wasn't the same silence Cas had been giving Dean earlier. That one was more based on frustration while this one felt melancholic. Dean stayed respectful of Cas' space until they pulled up to Cas' house.
It takes Dean a total of five seconds after pulling up to Cas’ house for him to realize what the hell he was doing. He was about to make a grand gesture of romance towards this dorky new teacher. Who may or may not feel the same way about him?
“Dean!”
“I guess I can see that,” Dean snorts. Cas presses two fingers to his temple with a sigh.
“I’ll call Principal Billie while we drive over,” Charlie says, already pulling out her phone.
“My apologies… It’s just that the group has moved on from this room,” Cas mutters. Dean looks around and realizes that he is in fact the only person left in the greenhouse. Aside from Cas who came to get him.
“Yeah, yeah, I got it,” she says, more to her phone. Dean was fairly certain she did
But no. Ms. Charlie Bradbury was none other than the high school
“...fine,” Dean says.
“And they’re not bad kids. They really aren’t. A few of them sleep through the class or are a little harder to work with but… the majority of them look like they’re actually learning. Adam and Claire just showed me that. And before that, a student told me how this class was going to help him and his mother grow some food so they have more to eat.” He pauses and stares down at his feet.
“It’s just in the morning, we’ll be back by lunchtime. Just have Gabe pop in a video for your first class, and then you have a prep-period second hour.”  Dean leans forward and looks at her with puppy-dog eyes. “Please?”
“Probably not as much as Gabe did when he ripped his pants trying to do the splits tonight,” he says. Dean smiles when he hears Cas snort and then begin to laugh. And then it hits him.
“Inhale…”  Dean inhales. “...and exhale.” Dean lets out a long exhale as Charlie smiles at him. “Good job Dean. Now, you want to try it again?”
"This is quite frustrating," Cas grumbles."But… at least she's safe."
“It’s Cas,” Dean mutters, then quickly adds, “Teacher related stuff.”  Charlie sits next to Dean on the floor. “You know how he got sick for a week? Right when midterms were happening? Well the sub was a complete idiot and printed off the wrong exam for the students. It was the midterm for
“Yeah any time. And like, I’m not here to judge you on your relationships or anything, but just know that you don’t owe anyone anything either ok? A relationship needs to be balanced if it’s going to work.”
know better. And he could tell that Cas was purposely creating space between them. It was obvious from the moment Cas assigned himself to the first bus and placed Dean and three other parents on the second bus. There were only two buses going up for this trip. So much for needing a co-chaperone… It was nothing but dental horror stories from Garth the entire forty minute drive…
“But you said you would,” Charlie pushes back. “And what about you-know-who?”
Dean’s about ready to give Garth some bullshit excuse as to why he’s going to sleep instead of listening to him talk about dentist stuff again, when Cas scrambles into the bus.
"Whoa, hey now," Dean holds a hand up to get the teen’s attention. "Mr. Novak isn't that bad now, is he?"
Cas glances away. “My brother is sort of giving me a crash course in major pop culture references… just so I can understand you a little better…” Dean can’t help the huge giddy smile that appears on his own face. Before Dean can say anything, Adam and Claire are right next to the two teachers.
“Hey,” Dean frowns in slight protest.
his boyfriend?” Dean looks away with a slight blush on his cheeks and a huge grin on his face.
“Jokes on you, I got the keys lover-boy!”  Cas pulls his hand back and Dean growls a bit at Gabriel’s finger guns. He turns his attention to Cassie Robinson walking up to the group now.
“Indubitably,” Cas deadpans and Dean can’t help but snort. They arrive only a minute later to the house.
“I can’t believe it’s all over,” Cas mutters.
“Charlie put you up to that didn’t she?” Dean sighs playfully.
Oh shit. Dean really wishes they could go back to not talking.
“Charlie?” he calls out. “Charlie, your Drama club fliers are being printed in my office and I've just run out of paper!”
“Allergies huh? Well, I hope they’re not bad enough to keep you from explaining yourself in the principal’s office.”
What?
“Just keep watching,” he mutters in embarrassment. Charlie has now hopped on to the stage as the student dance leader explains where the choreography gets lost. She listens, then walks through the choreography along with the students. After tripping over a couple of students, she nods and reworks the positioning of the lines. “See that?”
“GoodnightDean!” Cas sputters quickly and all but runs away. Dean stares at the empty space and blinks a couple more times. Then… it hits him… He sprints after Cas.
(Push.)
"Would have been nice to hear it from him," Dean mutters, folding his arms. Cas calls the group of students and chaperones over to the worker who would be giving them the tour.
“Whatever it is, I’m sure I’ll love it,” Dean says.
“Yeah,” Dean swallows. “It could be sooner.” Cas looks up at Dean through his dark lashes. “We could always… you know… I think Charlie said there was a planetarium opening up next week. We could... check it out after you’re done with your thing.”
You’ve got some time. And I’ll be there to help you. At least in getting it all set up with the universities.” Cas sighs and hands his doughnut over to Dean. “Don’t like jelly filled?”
“Just... the two of us?” Cas asks.
In. Out.
A short explanation of the sheep farm later, Dean and Cas are heading back to Dean’s classroom to return the wooden figure in its proper place. Once there, Dean sits in his chair and does his routine spin to make sure everything is in order. Black Impala Hot Wheels still stuck to his computer monitor? Check. Two movie posters (The Dark Knight and The Magnificent Seven), still serving as his personal backdrop? Check. “Best Effin’ Teacher Ever” mug? Check. And now with the wooden horse placed neatly near the computer monitor, Dean smiles as everything is accounted for. His chair returns to its original position facing the student’s desks, and there stands Cas. Dean suddenly feels a bit embarrassed.
thinking. What he does instead just comes to him as easily as singing to Cas had been a few months ago.
“...I think you’re awesome.”
“Here you go,” He hands over the change while Claire hands over a potted poinsettia to the woman.
“I’ve had a headache all day,” Cas grumbles. “I’m afraid if I put sugar into my system it may grow worse.” Out of habit from having to watch over his own brother, Dean presses the back of his hand against Cas’ forehead.
Dean lo…
“Cas!” Dean laughs and places his hands on Cas’ shoulders. “It’s ok! I’m not mad!”
“Maybe a little,” Cassie giggles as Dean rolls his eyes with his entire body. Dean might have been imagining it as they walked off to a practice room, but he could have sworn that Cas looked a little sad.
“I um...” Cas stammers a bit. But then he takes a deep breath and looks Dean directly in the eyes. Fiery determination burns within the blue eyes that squint at Dean. “Yes.” It was practically a growl and so Dean gulps. He opens his mouth in order to ask for forgiveness for daring to forget something. Not a single word passes his lips however, as two firm hands grab onto his face and pull him forward.
With Hayden waiting for her parents in Principal Billie's office, Dean hopped into his Chevy Impala and made the forty minute drive back to the farm. Of course he called Cas as he drove up to let him know their missing student had been found. The line goes deathly silent while Dean explains what happened. He was nearly convinced that he had lost cell service until he hears a long tired sigh from the other end.
was playing in his head
“Well one of the parents that volunteered to go cancelled since she was so mad about the grading mix up. We’re looking for someone ASAP, otherwise the trip will get cancelled.”
“No!”
“No, it’s fine. It’s just… no one has ever called me Cas before.”
"I'm just saying because last time you forgot," Adam folds his arms over his chest. "Mr. Novak docked us all points for that."
actually in his head.
…Holy shit, did he really just say that?!
whatever it was they had going. He didn’t feel so nervous and uptight around Cas anymore. Which made it easier for him to be a little more open about himself, and a lot more comfortable about singing. Cas called him a jukebox on more than one occasion, but he still tapped his toe and bobbed his head to whatever song Dean was singing.
“Can I be honest with you for a moment Dean?” Mr. Novak murmurs. “I mean… Mr. Winchester.”
“One time,” Jack says with a small sheepish smile. “We got him to talk about this friend for the entire class period instead of what we were supposed to do.”
sang in front of a large audience and the thought alone terrifies him. Yet his stupid crush is convincing his mind that it won’t actually be so bad. Just a few hundred people staring at him for a couple of hours in exchange for the chance to
“Oh damn,” Charlie says. “I mean, kids are tough. But parents are hell.”
“It was pretty obvious,” Jack says. “With the way Mr. Novak talks about you and the way you always come over to visit, we sort of figured it out pretty quick.”
“Cas!” Dean slams a palm to the door to stop it. Cas blinks at him curiously and Dean worries his frantic heart is going to burst out of his chest.
“Ms. Bradbury, the Drama club fliers aren’t in the copy office,” Patience says.
that when you have to kiss Ben in rehearsal today,” Claire smirks. Patience’s face turns beet red and she immediately covers her face in embarrassment.
“Told you,” Claire smirks and nudges Jack playfully. Jack bites his bottom lip to keep from laughing.
Oh fuck.
“Oh, so don’t get the principal sick, but your teacher buddy is whatever,” Dean snorts. Cas’ eyes widen a bit and he reaches out to take the pastry back. Dean promptly stuffs half of it into his mouth. “Too late!” Though it sounded more along the lines of “foo wate!” The agriculture teacher chuckles until he coughs. As soon as the large mouthful had been carefully chewed up and swallowed, Dean adds, “Dude, you should just head out now. Your last class is your other prep-period, so just go home already.”
“Maybe we need to check the drainage too,” Adam nods. “If all else fails I guess we could re-pot them. Or burn them. Depends on how I’m feeling later.” Claire nudges him sharply. “I’m kidding!” Dean bites his bottom lip to keep from laughing and looks over to Cas. Relief washes over Dean when he sees Cas has a slight smile on his face and looks pretty proud.
“I…”  Dean wants to say no. He
“Sorry,” Cas mumbles into the flower petals.
“Still?” Charlie asks with a slightly exasperated tone. “I
“Hey, it’s ok,” Charlie says to him gently once he’s sitting down. “Just breathe ok? Can you breathe with me?” Dean nods and follows Charlie in a few deep breaths. He tries to ignore the curious stares from his fellow teachers and students. Especially Cas…
"Just give it some time," Charlie whispers as they get closer to some students. "And don't worry, I'm still working through the layers."
“What do you think should be done?” he asks. Mr. Novak looks back and forth at each stack.
“I’m telling you it’s because of the water level,” Claire argues back.
"...you're kind of the first person I've sung to," he admits quietly. "On purpose at least. Unless they're family." Cas tilts his head.
“Night Cas,” Dean says as he lets himself out.
“I should go,” Cas sighs after checking the time on his wristwatch.
“Doesn’t that sound get annoying?” Dean asks, pointing his pen towards the loud humming sound behind him.
“...right,” he says. They stare at each other for a moment. “The quizzes are on the front table.”
hit something off with the strange little agriculture teacher…
“You’re
“Uh no,” he says. “Well… almost, but I decided to save it from the plant orphanage.” He feels his mouth dry up. “I uh… actually wanted to give this to you.” Cas looks up at him.
Well, either way, Cas would need to know sooner or later.
teacher. And she was on the hunt for a leading man to play the antagonist for the all school musical.
thinking about the kids Charlie,” Dean huffs and continues making his way down the hall and to his classroom. “Don’t you think it’s weird to be including adults in the show?”
"Well maybe Mr. Novak shouldn't be so anal about stupid dirt," Hayden rolls her eyes.
“Please excuse my husband,” Kali sighs. “He gets quite excited when Castiel shows signs of having a social life.” Castiel appears at the top of the stairs, wearing blue plaid pajama bottoms and a gray and red AC/DC shirt. This outfit made Cas look like a completely different person. Less put together and maybe a little more disorganized then he presented himself to be. A warm feeling grows in Dean’s chest as Cas quickly trots down the stairs.
Over the last two months, Dean had made quite a few choices that were sometimes overwhelming and oftentimes uncomfortable. But they were all choices that allowed him to get to know Cas. He still couldn’t quite wrap his mind on how Cas went from “pitiful crush” to “good friend.” And even now, as their fingers were interlocked, Dean felt their relationship was sliding into the next stage.
“Um, Ms. Bradbury?”  The script freezes mid air between the two as they look at Mr. Novak. He looks incredibly confused. “Sorry to… interrupt… I just wanted to confirm with you that you are still available to help me with grading my student’s quizzes tomorrow during the second hour block?” Dean slumps slightly as Charlie lets out a groan.
“Yep!” Dean says and quickly stands. “Anything for my lovely wife.” Fake wife actually, seeing as Charlie had casted the history teacher to play Dean’s wife. He winks and offers his arm to her.
Well… that
It still made him feel incredibly nervous and shy when complete strangers came up to compliment his talent. But it also did wonders in stroking his ego. Sam, who basically came to every performance, always said with a smile and a playful eye roll, “Great, now you’ll
“I’m so proud of you Cassie,” Gabe sniffles and wipes a fake tear away from his eye. “I knew you had it in you.” Cas buries his face into Dean’s chest. Kali comes to the rescue by grabbing Gabe by the shirt collar and dragging him away.
“Who needs a radio when Dean can be your own personal jukebox?” Cas says from the edge of the stage where he’s pulling apart the prop corsages and boutonnieres that were shipped in that morning.
“Oh not the puppy-dog eyes!” Charlie tries to swat Dean away. “Ok fine! I’ll go.” Dean punches the air in triumph. “On one condition.” He looks at her curiously. “You have to sing for me right now.” Dean lets out a small whine of his own upon hearing the condition. “Don’t worry…” She hands Dean her phone and lifts herself off the floor. “I’m not going to try and watch you this time.” She puts a finger to her chin as she looks at Dean. Her director gears started to turn in her head. “Remember what I told you. The feeling of frustration you felt trying to keep Sam safe growing up?”
“Yeah, when I’m
“No, Dean… it’s ok,” Charlie cuts him off. “Obviously a lot is going on right now. But also… I should be the one saying sorry. I kept trying to force you out of your comfort zone and didn’t listen to you.” She leans into him and rests her head on his shoulder. “If you really want to quit the show, then that’s totally fine.”
you I will do whatever I can to help you get over your stage fright. I’m a Drama teacher for fuck’s sake. It’s what I’m trained to do. And like, come on, spending lots of extra time with a cutie? I mean, for a guy I guess he’s cute.”
“And geese,” Dean adds and Charlie groans. “But if you hand over my present from Cas that you kidnapped from my classroom, then maybe I can convince Gabe to be the chaperone instead.” Before she has a chance to give her usual "I don't know what you're talking about," the classroom door swings open and Patience leads Kaia and Ben into the room.
“Totally,” Dean responds over a mouthful of his own doughnut. “I had some very reliable sources tell me that you’re doing a lot better. So why not jump into the next level?”
“Our flowers have tons of water though! It’s gotta be because Hayden left some of them out in the sun!”
“Well ‘tis the season for colds and junk,” Dean shrugs. “Just grab some orange juice or vitamin C packets on your way home and chug it. And get some extra sleep tonight. None of that late night gaming.”
Dean swallows and takes a deep breath as the last few words are sung out by the ensemble. And finally, for the first time in his entire life, Dean sings in front of an audience.
The curtains open, a little slow at first, and Dean grips his podium a little tighter. Charlie was right about the lights being bright… but he felt like he could still see some faint outline of the chairs in the auditorium. His eyes dart around more as the curtain is almost completely open. Fear grips him tight and the urge to vomit tickles at his throat.
“It wasn’t so bad,” Dean shrugs and follows. “Just follow the yellow brick road to the end.” Mr. Novak tilts his head a bit.
The fact that they were holding hands on the front porch, well, Dean would take that as a slight win and a
“You’re not?” Cas still looks like a terrified kitten and Dean has to keep from laughing harder.
“I guess,” he shrugs and pulls out his keys to unlock the door. “What’s the show again?”
the case until said best friend caught him singing in the faculty lounge. It was his prep-period and he really needed some caffeine. So twenty five cents later, he’s pouring the entire can of Coca-Cola into his “Best ‘Effin Teacher Ever” mug while belting out Def Leppard’s “Pour Some Sugar On Me.” At the peak of the second chorus, he turns and nearly drops his mug at the sight of Charlie staring in bewildered excitement from the door. Now, if Charlie had been, say, the biology teacher or the computer science teacher, Dean probably would have gotten a simple “you sound good!” and that would be the end of it.
“Of course,” Cas says, and finally leaves the faculty lounge with Dean.
Dean turns his attention back to the long table at the front which had six stacks of papers. Those had to be the quizzes, and if he were to guess, he would say that they were separated into classes. As he settles down onto one of the cold chairs, he notices that one stack already had a few red marks and numbers on them.
“No problem Cas,” Dean offers a nervous half smile. Cas holds the pot a little closer to his chest and gently touches the petals. Dean watches him with curiosity at first, and then with worry. “Did I pick a bad one?”
Dean smiles and hugs Cas back. "Any time Cas."
Though with how often Charlie liked to “take the horse for a stroll” to her classroom, it becomes difficult for Dean to follow through with that.
Once the curtains close in preparation for the beginning of the show, anxiety saunters right back into Dean’s mind. There was no escaping it now. Dean would have to sing. Well, maybe he could just run out of the school right now. Nobody would notice him! Except maybe the others in the cast, but he was sure he could easily push past them all.
"I feel very honored then. Thank you."  Dean squirms even more in his chair.
“You got this,” he mutters to himself. “Charlie said he was looking for more friends. It’s fine. Normal. Just normal friendly teacher stuff.” He takes another quick breath and marches forward. Two steps in, Gabe bounds over and plops himself in the empty seat right next to Mr. Novak. Dean’s internal scream only gets louder as he watches Gabe throw an arm around Mr. Novak’s shoulder and lean into his ear to say something.
“Really?” Dean asks with a huge smile on his face.
"Right," Dean nods slowly, then perks up. "No yeah, you're right! I mean, look at us!” He gestures to the auditorium. “You’re surrounded by teachers here who have years of experience under their belt! Like, Lisa. The lady playing Ren’s mom in the show? She makes sure she gets through the entire math lesson before going around and helping students individually. Or even Charlie. She’s a natural.”
“Extremely,” Cas chuckles to himself. A fond smile appears on his face that Dean wishes were for him instead. “He’s done so much for me throughout the years and it’s only now that I feel like I’m at a position where I’m worthy enough to give back the generosity in kind.”
“I don’t really blame you,” Dean says with a shrug, which causes another gentle hand bump. “A lot of teachers think that I have it easier since there’s another professor doing the heavy lifting. I’m more like the Longbottom when it comes to which teacher matters more.”
“No, I mean, yes?”
“Yes,” Mr. Novak says slowly. “The help would be quite appreciated since I am hoping to have these results by midnight tomorrow for the students.”
"...oh…" Cas simply says. They're quiet for a moment.
If Dean didn't know any better, then he would have assumed Cas was having an off day instead of full out ignoring him. But Dean
Then he realizes that if he can barely remember his lines… then how the hell is he going to be expected to sing? Singing in front of Cas was still just singing to one person. This show was going to have him sing in front of a large group! Adults and teenagers just staring and silently judging as he stood up here and made himself look like an idiot! As Claire’s voice echoes from above to tell Dean to go ahead and test his mic, he feels himself sway forward at his sudden lightheadedness. He catches himself by putting his hands on his knees, but he’s breathing as though he just finished running a marathon. A second later, Charlie is leading him to sit on one of the benches backstage.
“Is this supposed to convince me or scare me away?” Dean deadpans.
“Yeah that was fun,” Claire snorts in amusement. “But the point is, we sort of figured something was up with you guys. But for some reason, you’re both too chicken to do something about it.”
They filed the kids back onto the bus, ready to head back to school. Dean let Garth take over roll call duty as he took a headcount of how many students were on the bus. 40 students and two other chaperones aside from himself and Garth were all accounted for.
“Thanks! Merry Christmas!” the woman smiles and walks away with the plant.
The screen once showing the instructor for Biology 1010 clicks off and Dean grunts as he stands from his swivel chair, immediately drawing the attention of his small class of five. “Alright, you heard the lady. Go over the practice quizzes on Canvas before taking the test, and make sure you get that research paper done by next week and turn it in.” He gives each of his students a playful warning glance until he gets to one student in particular. Hayden Foster already had her phone out, as usual, and completely ignored Dean. Typically, Dean was much more lax on the “no phone” policy than the rest of the school, but even he found himself getting a bit tired of Hayden’s “creative” ways to pretend she didn’t have her phone out. He fights the urge to let out a loud sigh and instead points to a blonde girl who sat on the floor at the very front of the room. “No late work accepted this time around, got it Claire?”
“...alright,” Cas says slowly and looks down at the essay again. Dean takes a long sip from his mug and silently thanks the heavens that he was able to save that--
," Hayden scowls. "I'll take care of it."
because you like someone then.”
“Dean,” Cas says once they’re into the next greenhouse. “I’m sorry.”
“Soooo, what do you say? Wanna save Bobby John from the plant orphanage?”
“Not for a show like this,” Charlie counters, following Dean every step of the way. “The whole show deals with kids standing up against adults in the name of what’s right. So if kids were playing the adults, it'd get a little muddled, don’t you think?” Dean thinks on it for a second.
“I’m just saying, it’ll be the perfect chance for you to get to know him,” Charlie sing-songs the last bit and Dean bites his bottom lip. “Dean, I
Inhale. Exhale. But not too fast or he might faint.
“That’s… ok, I’ll admit that I’m getting a little confused myself...”  Mr. Novak lets out a low groan and covers his face with his hands. “They’re high schoolers. They tend to forget things really easily.”
a date that Cas was asking Dean on. And besides…
In. Out.
It’s just Charlie. No judgement.
Now that the show was over and Dean had finally admitted to himself that he was in love with Cas, the universe seemed to do everything in its power to keep the two of them separated. With the start of December came the start of the universities finals. Between ensuring the students were able to turn in their projects, take their final exams, and making sure the universities received everything, Dean no longer had time to help Cas with grading. And by the time those finals were over, Cas had already recruited Gabe as extra help in grading his class’ semester finals.
“Is this typical teacher sickness protocol?” Cas asks.
“Hey Dean, you mind if we go over lines?” she asks.
“He’s like, mostly serious when he talks to us,” Claire explains. “But whenever he talks about his ‘friend from the show,’ his voice sounds more excited.” Claire begins to mimic Cas’ gravelly voice. “‘My friend from the show did this,’ ‘my friend from the show said that.’ Just lots of little stories that totally sound like stuff you’d do or say.”
“I already decided.” (Shove.)
“Cassie?” Dean blinks, then smiles a bit in relief. “We’re just married in the show.” He makes quotation marks with his fingers at the word “married.” Cas is still frowning. “Dude, I promise you it’s all just playing around. Ok? Trust me.”
"That wasn't crap," Cas says, instantly sober. Oh no… now it’s starting to hit Dean what he just did... "You have a wonderful voice." Dean shrinks a bit in his seat. "I can see why Charlie chose you for the role as Reverend Moore." Dean shrinks even further. "Dean, why are you shrinking?"
crash into the other teacher. “My friend Dean here has a free period so he should be able to take my place!”
“Yeah, that didn’t need to happen to make me realize I’m not cut out for this,” Dean shoves the script back.
“Dean, I am
“Cas?” he repeats. Dean suddenly realizes he called him a nickname.
shut up!” In which case Dean, always without fail, traps him in a headlock and rasps his knuckles hard against his head.
His hopes continue upward by the time they reach the tomato farm. Forty minutes surely was enough time for Cas to come to his senses and be in a better mood. It would have been a real bummer if they went on this hour-long tour without talking at all... But as soon as Cas stepped off of the bus, he brushed past Dean without a second glance. Dean's jaw clenches a bit as Charlie hops off shortly after.
“It’s just,” he finally says. “I was so sure about quitting my job. Everything that could go wrong kept going wrong and I was sure I was just doomed to fail this school like I did in my first one. I had convinced myself that I wasn't good enough and that I had just wasted my time and money on a dead-end career choice." Dean opens his mouth to argue against calling teaching a "dead-end career choice," but a gentle hand pressing against Dean's arm makes him close it.
title and swallows.
“But nothing Cas! If you’re with someone who doesn’t respect you and always makes you feel like shit, then maybe something's gotta change or end in the relationship!”
“Not that it’s any of our business,” Claire clears her throat. “But you obviously have the hots for Mr. Novak.”
Cas to truly understand that he shouldn't carry the weight on his shoulders. To let things into his heart. Then how things can get better.
“The copy lady said she hasn’t gotten anything from you since before Christmas break,” Kaia explains. “She says to try one more time.” Charlie grumbles a few elvish curse words under her breath as she goes to her small office space in the back of the classroom. The girls follow their Drama teacher to the small office, leaving Dean and Ben in the main classroom.
Out. In.
About ten minutes into the tour, Dean’s mood had completely soured. The tour and farm itself wasn’t boring, but Dean couldn’t help but feel that he was wasting his time. The whole purpose of Dean being a chaperone was so he could spend more time with Cas. Like a date. Even though Dean had told himself that this field trip was absolutely
Dean let out a loud “FUCK!” before whipping his head towards his driver’s window. A stern looking Cas stood on the other side, pointing a finger downward to the ground. Dean gulps and opens the door. The shocked look on Cas’ face made Dean realize that he was probably motioning for the window to be rolled down instead of wanting Dean to come out of the car...
As soon as there’s more space between them, Dean gently nudges Cas. “Good job, Teach.”
this to you. Like a gift. Because I…” He’s going to do it. “...I just thought you might like it…”
"I called in a sub for this stupid trip and I'm getting the cold shoulder," Dean growls.
“Home sweet home,” Dean says after putting the car into park. Cas nods but doesn’t give any indication that he’s getting out yet.
Unfortunately, Winchester sickness protocol is only helpful when used at the correct stage of the sickness. Cas’ body had already dived into the “chicken soup and lemon tea” zone of sickness during his teacher-parent meeting. Just like Sam after his law school finals week, Cas had strained his body so much that he had to call in a substitute to properly recover. And Dean missed him terribly.
Since then, Dean had been itching for redemption. But anytime he tried to talk with the guy (the two other times that he tried), Dean’s pop culture references flew right over his head.
“Told you!” Claire nudges a frowning Adam.
“You haven’t even talked to him yet!” (Push.)
"I love you, Cas," he says. Cas’ eyes widened in surprise and that's when Dean realized he just dropped the "love" word first. No practice beforehand. No words getting stuck in his throat. It just came out without a second thought. He'll admit that it felt nice that he didn't overthink it, but holy hell was he overthinking it now. Before Dean has a chance to say something and maybe make himself look like an idiot, Cas gently kisses Dean’s hand.
“You shaved your legs,” Cas comments.
“Well, introduce him to your D&D group. I’m out.” (Shove.)
“Great,” Cas rolls his eyes. “Just what I needed before midterms.”
Once the students leave to hang up the many fliers, Dean holds up the horse figure for Charlie to see that he has it back. She pouts and Cas looks at Dean curiously.
“Yep,” Dean lies and tosses the papers into the trash. “Exactly that.” Cas nods thoughtfully and soon they go back to their seats and pick up their grading material again.
“I understand,” Mr. Novak nods, but Dean notices the slight droop in his shoulders. He gives Charlie a side eye for disappointing this gorgeous man. This goes unnoticed, due to Charlie throwing her arm around Dean’s back.
“It’d be a lot more ‘merry’ if I wasn’t here right now,” Dean grumbles and earns a look from Claire.
Dean opens his mouth to agree, but something in his mind panics and he blurts out instead, “Or with Charlie. She likes space stuff too.”
“Wait, I’m not trying to dump this on you because I felt bad for it. I…” Oh boy, here it comes. “I wanted to
“I’ll have them grow poinsettias.”
“Sounds good,” Dean smiles, which grows even wider when Mr. Novak smiles back at him. After about the third flip his stomach makes, Dean coughs and glances up at the classroom’s clock. “I still have fifteen minutes before I’ll need to head back. But I can come help again after school is out.”
“Think of the children, Dean!”
While a part of Dean was happy that he and Cas seemed to be back on speaking terms, the other part of him wanted to bring up the topic that caused the small silent treatment. It seemed like whatever Charlie had said to Cas at least helped him to realize that Dean wasn’t an enemy. However, he didn’t actually say whether he changed his mind on quitting or not. He hoped that after the conversation Adam and Claire had in front of them that Cas was reconsidering.
“It’s not that hard to say it,” he growls to himself. Then with each bump to the steering wheel, he grumbles, “I love you. I love you. I love--”
"This is it, right?" He asks.
again. He tries to focus on his breathing while Charlie pushes the play button on her phone. The bell at the beginning was meant to prepare Dean for the incoming music, but all it did was set him into a slight panic.
“I told you not to wear those,” Cas glares up at the Mythology teacher.
“I know,” Dean sighs with a smile. Once she disappears again, Dean numbly walks back to his chair, slumps down, and stares at the ceiling in despair until students start coming in for the next period.
"Thank you," Cas smiles a bit. "But I have been told that I have a bad habit of rambling when I become nervous. Which seems to be a continual problem when I give my slideshow presentations. It has left students completely confused at times, like today when I begin explaining a plant's decomposition process."
“But the show is in like a month,” Dean frowns.
“Really?! You mean it?!” Charlie’s eyes become the size of dinner plates and they sparkle with excitement when Cas nods. “Oh my God that would be awesome! Thank you! I promise now that I totally won’t complain during the field trip. Even if it is going to be an hour full of stinky chickens…”
Wait.
"Thank you Dean," Cas murmurs into Dean's chest. "For everything."
It takes Dean a total of three seconds to realize that Cas was kissing him. Cas had smashed his lips against Dean’s open mouth so he could feel dried lips on his teeth very well. Just as Dean’s about to lift his hands to do… something… the lips are gone, along with the two hands on the side of his face. Dean stares up at an incredibly tensed up Cas. The once determined tiger now looked like a terrified wet kitten.
“Yes. Um… I don’t mean to be rude but…”  Dean looks back at the stacks of papers spread out on the desk.
“And for the record,” Dean drops his voice low so it was just between the two of them. “We’re not in love!” Charlie gives him a look that screams “yeah, sure.” Dean gulps. “Ok fine, you know how I’ve felt about him for a while but… there’s no way he’s… you know.” She and Dean look over to Cas, who quickly goes back to working on the props and
“I’m good now,” Dean says, even though he wasn’t completely. “Thanks.” Charlie hands him a water bottle before having to join Claire and the other tech students at the booth.
“Especially if they do things that make you uncomfortable. Like… I don’t know, wear booty shorts even though you told them not to.”
“Because
"My mom would sing that to us as kids," Dean feels the need to explain himself. "When we were feeling sick or just really crappy and… I guess looking at you, it felt right?" Cas gives Dean one of those smiles again. The smile that is so fond and just for Dean.
in front of his crush/friend, he would feel too embarrassed to continue. But he didn’t. He felt at peace. Maybe he would have if he allowed himself to wonder why at this moment singing felt like second nature to him. But he doesn't think about it. He won't. Otherwise he knew he would stop.
“Dammit Gabriel!” Cas shouts as he’s tugging at the door handle. Dean could swear he hears a loud howl of laughter from inside the house as Cas leans down to retrieve a key from under the house mat. A second later, Dean has caught up to Cas. He has to slam both of his hands against the door to stop himself from completely crashing. The loud slap causes Cas to shoot up and crash into Dean’s chin.
“I allowed the students to leave a few minutes early,” Mr. Novak explains as he joins him shortly. “So I got a bit of a head start. This is a copy of the answer key. Do you need a pen?”
“But then I talked to Charlie and she helped me to realize a few things. One, that no teacher has a perfect beginning in their teaching career. There’s always stubborn students, and angry parents no matter where you go. She also told me how difficult her students were to her when she first started and… well, it truly made me realize that my classes were really not that bad.
“It’s just a stage kiss, Patience,” Adam Milligan comments, still seated in his usual spot at the center of the room. “Samandriel says it doesn’t actually count as your first kiss.”
“Do you really think it’s wise to be suggesting this to me?” Cas asks while he inspects the doughnut he chose from the faculty lounge (it was meant to boost morale as the teachers were preparing for midterms next week). “Concurrent enrollment is a huge commitment and it’s only now that I feel like my presentations actually make sense.”
“Thank you, dear husband,” she smiles and takes his arm. “Then maybe we can get Patience and work on our singing parts in the opening song?” She flutters her eyelashes at him for good measure.
He rounds the corner of the last hall and finds Mr. Novak standing in the small hall opening that leads to his classrooms. Dean waves and the other teacher offers a half smile.
“Well don’t forget that participation is a majority of your grade,” Dean says. “Not just for his class, but for this one too, Hayden.”
when Dean realizes what he had just done. He was so sure that upon realizing he just
“The highest grade I’ve given so far is a C+...”
“Sorry,” Cas mutters apologetically. “I just overheard you both the other day talking about going to a bar and then... something about how she needed two hands to wield if she wasn’t mounted and how well your piercing damage works...”
“There’s this field trip I’m planning,” Cas says. “It’s a tomato farm that is able to grow all year round thanks to an electrical power plant built nearby. I’m using it for a unit I have planned for when we talk about recyclable farming methods.” Dean makes a noise of interest. “The trip will probably happen at the beginning of November but… while parents are able to volunteer to chaperone, I am still in need of a teacher to be a sort of co-chaperone.”
“You… never had to say it,” Cas mutters. “Your actions have always spoken louder than words ever could. So… I’ve known for a while now.” Dean grew tense until Cas gently squeezed his hands. “And I just wanted to let you know that… I like you in that way as well…”
on the other hand!”
“Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!” Charlie squeezes him a little tighter with each “thank you.” When Dean lets out a soft gagging sound is when she finally lets go. “Ok, so rehearsals start next week. We’ll read the script and then basically split the rehearsals between the students and the adults. Anytime the ensemble goes off to learn music or dance choreography, we’ll do the blocking and scene work for the adults with some of the leads. When the kids are working on scenes, you guys can work on the music and stuff.”
"Nice," is all he can say, with a genuine grin. When Cas smiles back at him, Dean has to fight the urge to grab his face and kiss him at that moment. He compromises with a thumbs up.
“Nope,” Dean holds up his pen and gives it a few clicks. Mr. Novak nods and sits down. Noticeably, on the opposite side of Dean and a few chairs away. Dean gulps and scoots a stack of quizzes closer to himself. They begin working in complete silence.
“Deadline huh?” Dean smiles. “Well, no sweat there. Just call me your fairy god-grader because we’re gonna bippity-boppidy-do this.” Charlie snorts and Mr. Novak blinks.
“If I am getting sick, I didn’t want to spread it to our boss,” Cas mutters with slightly flushed cheeks. Dean holds the doughnut up to Cas’ face.
“No,” Ben shakes his head. “It just... looked like Patience needed some help so I said I’d help her out.”
...oh.
“My mother always signed us up for our church’s Christmas pageant,” Cas sighs heavily. “And Easter pageants…”
It’s not until they are half way through the tour, walking through greenhouse number two, that Dean’s irritation shifts into a sort of sadness. He doesn’t want to be mad at Cas, especially if this is really it for them. Every choice that Dean had made was for the sake of his dumb crush, but it helped them. Dean could actually call Cas a friend at this point instead of some cute dork that he never could talk coherently around. In fact, Dean was quite sure he had moved past from “I have a dumb crush on Cas” and more towards “I am in...”
“Probably just hold back from watering for a couple of days,” Claire says, more to Adam.
“That sounds fair,” Cas snorts and picks up another essay. They continue their respective grading process in silence, even to the point where Dean begins to lose himself in the zone.
“I should let you get home,” Cas finally says.
“Mr. Novak, when a leaf is turning yellow, it’s because there’s too much sun right?” Adam asks, his tone clearly waiting for their teacher to confirm that he is correct.
Dean almost gives himself whiplash at how fast he looks up from the quiz. Cas is reading through the essay in front of him, but his eyes aren't actually moving. He finally looks up at Dean through his eyelashes. A bit of worry and hesitation shines through. Dean swallows down the excitement at the fact his pitiful crush is not in vain.
