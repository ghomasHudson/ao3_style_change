He only narrowed his dark eyes in response, shuffling in a new slide without glancing back down. “Fine. While not supernaturally-charged, smelling the garlic you ate two days ago
Oh, fuck it all. “In that I’m in love with him, you mean,” he said bitterly, averting his eyes from his brother to stare at the wall.
Without raising his eyes, Sherlock visibly swallowed and turned around. John stifled a gasp.
“I…” He visibly swallows, and his mask slips. “I suppose I am. Yes.”
But god, Sherlock was here. His blood was singing, his heart was trapezing in flips, a feeling not unlike adrenaline beginning to pulse. Suddenly, it didn’t matter that John didn’t love him back the way that Sherlock loved him. This little thing, this thing that was
Alarm singed his veins, making his spine straighten and his shoulders set. “What for?”
Sherlock gave a semblance of a smile, and then closed his eyes. It was obvious it was for John’s benefit, and that he’d jump back up the moment he was alone, but John took it in kind and went back upstairs. He slept fitfully that night.
“17 Quincy Street,” Mycroft said quietly into the receiver. That… that was John’s address, he realized with an internal groan. He spared a glance, but Mycroft had his back to the room, facing the window that overlooked the fields of the complex, hand to his ear. Anthea never looked up from her own device. John limped just a bit faster.
Past his surprise, John took a step further, letting his feelings bubble to the surface. “Don’t
By the fourth Monday, though, John couldn’t hold his tongue any longer.
ME: ...
ME: Apologies. I’m afraid I’m unable to keep my emotions in check.
Outside the window John watched the mob of people littering the walkway, and beneath it the cars hovering at a standstill. Today was the official move-out day, where the twenty thousand people who helped build the Intrepid and prepare for the journey ahead were just… leaving. Going home, back to their original sectors, and then to watch the launch Friday morning on projected screens with family and friends. The only people staying were the Intrepid’s crew, and then the some-dozen people working as the temporary mission control during the launch.
Before John can reply, Mycroft returns, coat draped over his forearm and the twinkle in his eye dangerous. “You’re quite correct, I haven’t reached my day-to-day quota as of yet.” And then he glances down Sherlock’s body purposefully, narrowing his eyes on the midsection before flashing a smirk. “But it looks as though
John sighs and leans forward, helping his daughter climb down. “You know,” he says, “years ago if you went even
But where was Sherlock? All of a sudden, the man in the hazel jumpsuit was nowhere to be seen. Where had he gone? Someone gave John’s pale uniform a look, but he ignored it.
Was John not as interesting as Sherlock had thought? It was such a destructive thought, that John’s life wasn’t worth the effort due to his ordinariness. It was even worse to find himself upset at the idea. But Sherlock was part of his life now in whatever capacity, and the sudden cold shoulder thrown his way still stung. Days became weeks, and when it hit three full months of living at 221B, John was holed up in his room and utterly miserable.
9 FEBRUARY 2016
well that he was laughing.
A burst of sound in the distance, a definitive direction slightly to the right. He turned towards the noise and began to run, the sand thankfully yielding to his uncoordinated feet.
It wasn’t his place, either, but he couldn’t stop thinking of the possibility and Sherlock's prolonged absence. Maybe all that John’s been noticing was a relapse, and Sherlock has to leave every few weeks to get a fix? It’s not unheard of, though the symptoms and time frame were a bit off.
Wilde says. That quote had always poured warmth into his stomach, for reasons he never quite knew until he understood exactly what Gwendolyn meant by saying it. If he could, he’d tattoo the quote onto his soul for the world to see - for one person to see, in particular.
John doesn’t know how long he can make this work. He doesn’t want to think about it, but. At midnight there’s little else to do.
Numb.
“It’s 05:30,” he said. “We need to hurry and get out of here before sunrise. It’s already beginning to lighten up.”
Of the fourteen Sectors, each sent in one person that would represent them on the DSE Intrepid. This person was the most knowledgeable in their field, and would be able to put this knowledge towards determining if the new planet was fit for human life in the long term. For example, if food was unable to grow in alien soil, the Agricultural Sector representative would test the factors and form a solution towards crop success. The initial competition to become the representative was rumored to have been grueling and cutthroat, and the chosen people even still have to undergo continued testing to secure the position. John, meanwhile, was simply written into this elite crew as an ‘oh, yeah, let’s throw this washed-up former med student into the mix, that’ll be fun’. He felt out of place, to say the least.
damnit.
But John was already shaking his head. “It’s too far a fall,” he protested. “Remember? We’re not touching the ground at the moment, we’ve a great big hoop around us, for whatever reason. I never quite learned why.”
“There’s small music shop me and Rosie passed through. You were in the loo.”
“That was painless,” Sherlock commented. John hummed under his breath.
ME: I’ve actually become involved in world politics. John would be proud.
John, grinding against a leather-clad arse.
“Invasive ones,” he answered, eyes widening in emphasis. He went to duck under the tape, and then stopped again. “Just… try and appease him. Please. He has the ability to make my life difficult, given the chance.”
There was a corner booth at the very end, nestled against the wall and under a lonely hanging light. The table was so small that their knees knocked together beneath it, but John wasn’t going to object. “I’ll have a coke,” he told the waitress.
Sherlock’s condescension could be heard from 30 meters away, apparently. “I’ll certainly endeavour to, Doctor!”
If John ever admits that to himself, however, he’ll drown so far into his own personal pit of self-loathing that he won’t be able to climb himself out.
“I realized that… it doesn’t matter.”
“Obviously.”
“I’ve done many things while you were asleep,” he says. “Before.”
John purses his lips together. Behind him, the front door opens again, and this time it’s Anthea. She walks down the front stoop, nearly stepping on John’s hand, and mumbles an apology down at her phone at John’s sound of protest. Mycroft’s umbrella is looped around her wrist. As if on cue, a familiar black car pulls up to the curb. Mycroft stomps out his cigarette, but before he opens the passenger door, he pauses and looks back to John with eyes that twinkle in the most unsettling of ways.
“Hm. I asked for three.” He finally glanced her way and offered her a grin half-hidden by the mask, so spontaneously dazzling that the poor girl never stood a chance. “Is there any way you can stretch it?”
“Oh?” John asked lightly.
make sure to tip off the universities Benjamin applied to, to just where he got his applications from.”
“Quite,” Sherlock bit out after a moment, shifting away from John and twining his hands behind his back, the pinnacle of poised. John’s eyes darted between the brothers, but it seemed as though their hard stares spoke a language of their own.
John’s brain buzzed out. Huh? That was probably the
“Doubtful. Maybe you should stop arguing with a wall, perhaps that’s how the attention is being drawn.”
When Sherlock turns his head and meets John’s stare, he blanches. Molly says one more thing, gesturing towards the sitting room, and when Sherlock doesn’t immediately react she takes a step forward and nudges him out of the kitchen.
“Greg explained,” she says quickly, thankfully cutting John off before he can ramble on some more. “Not very well, but I understood the gist.” She finally meets his eyes, her brows curved in worry. “Are you alright, John? Is everyone alright?”
After what happened in Sherrinford, John is the first to visit Molly, bringing Rosie as an excuse. Not a very good excuse, given that both his daughter and her godmother positively adore each other, but it’s a pretense that Molly seems to appreciate nonetheless.
William Stanley Braithwaite
Making up his mind, John swoops in, apron and all, to gather Rosie into his arms. She squeals while he swings her back and forth, her feet dangling as they dance in an almost cartoonish version of the waltz.
Sherlock nearly barks out a response, but then pauses. He glances at John, and then at Rosie, where she’s twirling around in her favorite toy, and then seems to shut down, utterly lost and biting at his lip as if he’s trying to gnaw it off. He’s hesitating. With a sigh, John takes Lestrade off speaker and holds the phone up to his ear.
His eyes don’t open. John can feel his voice through his chest, where his palms are still connected.
He could be selfish.
The man was in the act of climbing through the ropes onto the platform, looking like a spider with his long limbs in such a narrow form. He had angular features from what John could see, and fair skin with a contrast of curly dark hair. When his eyes met John’s, catlike and startlingly pale, there was a hitch in his movements. His foot hooked onto the rope and he fell face-first into the mat.
Another hefty sigh, and John pushed away his plate with a grimace. “How good for you two,” he muttered.
John’s stomach betrayed him, enough so that he could ignore the mention of Sarah. That was Sherlock’s first deduction in John’s direction, however small, and John wasn’t as unnerved by it as he would’ve thought. Shaking it away, John slid off his apron and hung it up to the side. “Sure, as long as it’s not from the cafeteria. I may have gotten old, but my taste buds still work the same.”
“Ah, no,” she said slowly. Her typing was irregular. “You have a visitor on the top floor, requesting a meeting. I’m… that’s all right, isn’t it?”
“Oh,” he said, almost to himself.
“John,” Sherlock said aloud, jolting him from his daze. He hadn’t realized Sherlock had lifted his eyes, John's own unfocused and heady, now widening as if in headlights. He let his shirt fall back over his stomach and felt heat rush to his cheeks.
At that moment, the door downstairs opened. The thump of familiar steps soon climbed the stairs. “I quite rather like Eleanor,” Sherlock mused, standing up and absentmindedly straightening his jacket. “That could also be ‘Ellie’, couldn’t it?”
With uncertainty, John continued with his own work, scuffing at the ground again. And that’s when hell decided to break open.
, you haven't given me much to build hope in."
Sherlock scoots over some more. John slides next to him, and finds himself having to sit closer to support the body of the instrument in a way that isn’t uncomfortable. They’re pressed along their arms and thighs, Sherlock’s other hand on the fretboard, and they’re very purposefully avoiding direct eye-contact, the heat stifling between their clothes and buzzing as if they’d been set on vibrate. Rosie’s tottering around the sitting room, paying them no mind.
Since John’s subconscious seemed to think that he hadn’t had enough horror for the day, his sleep was filled with nightmares.
John scoffed, but finished his plate. Not because Sherlock told him to, mind, but because he really hadn’t eaten all day and he was famished. He finished his second coke along with the rest of his rice, and then slapped down his own card before Sherlock could. If he was going to get bossed around, anyway, he might as well pay for his own meal. Sherlock noticed, of course, but only huffed out a laugh at the display.
over-”
There was something about his voice. Guarded, yet ashamed. Like he couldn’t tell John something. He should be able to tell John
But before they reached the police tape, he hesitated. “The Detective Inspector you’re about to meet has known me the longest, and is also the least annoying out of them all. He… he’ll be asking you questions.” He was fidgeting with the hem of his coat. “I’ve never brought anyone to a crime scene before, so he’s bound to be curious.”
“Oh, but I will,” Mycroft said, something almost akin to
On of the women stepped forward, and another ran off to (supposedly) find the person in charge. “I’m an overseer,” she said, face unsure. Her jumpsuit was gray rather than black. “We’re, er, trying to find the head at the moment for you. You can understand that we’re a bit busy, setting up for launch and all. I haven’t heard about an accident happening.”
“Oh.” Sherlock cleared his throat, showing John that he was self-conscious. “Well, while I was attracted to you, I wasn’t… physically attracted until that, erm. Night. The first kiss.” He was blushing, and his hands were fiddling in his lap. The rest of his words were quiet. “From then, it was like wildfire.”
He snorted. “Not really my area.”
“Oddly enough, I don’t believe you.” Sherlock turned his head slightly, studying him and then tightening his lips. Trying to get a read, and ultimately learning nothing new. “You did almost… die.”
“I like any songs about scientists, John, regardless of the artist. This one happens to fit the bill. See, it’s right there in the title.”
, Rosie would be your best friend.”
“- sounds like you’re quite besotted with this Scott fellow-“
“Cut the theatrics, please, I assume we don’t have the time.”
John rolled his hips, and both men sighed. “The first time,” John breathed, speaking of a forbidden thing, “You sat on top of me. Not like this, but…” He shuddered, beginning a rhythm between them.
The man snorted through his nose. “The captain? No, he intensely dislikes me. I’ve only heard about your... doctoral success, is all. You’re a bit of a legend in the hospital field, you know.”
Sherlock skidded to a stop, looking around frantically despite his blindness, trying to get a read on sound alone. There was a cacophony of sound, out of tune. Dissonant. Fortissimo.
A damp curl drapes over Sherlock’s forehead, like he’s bloody Clark Kent, or Superman, one of them, and it shines the purples and blues and pinks that flash around them. Before John can think twice about it, he reaches up and pushes it back into place, with the others, and runs his hands through his hair and down his nape and further, further, past collarbones until his fingers are pressed into the left side of his rib cage.
Oh, god, that was it, wasn’t it? Sherlock
Down in the labs, it was quiet. Mike cut through halls with familiarity, nodding to the occasional student. It was becoming late afternoon, on a Thursday, which meant that this calmness must be the norm.
“Isn’t there some sort of training I would have to go through?” John protested half-heartedly. “I know nothing about space, save for the fact that to be there for an elongated period of time I would have to be in top shape. Which I am certainly not.”
“Gamma radiation would do nothing more than weaken a human,” Sherlock pointed out. After a beat, his tone was hesitant. “So, you’re classifying me with the ‘good guys’?”
Sherlock made a low noise under his breath, oddly complacent for such a (relatively) boring outing. John, with a steadying hand on the stone, bent down to straighten the flowers and clean off the rest of the moss. He paused. “Huh.”
Dr. Watson. There isn’t a second to waste.”
ME: Or I'm more predictable than I thought.
ed, sliding on his suit jacket. Anything heavier was unneeded in the warming weather. “You’re relatively young, and in good health. Well, physically.” He eyed the cane purposefully, but said nothing more in its direction. “For example, how old do you think I am?”
“If you can play that song from
he coos,
She kicked off into a sprint, and all John could think was
“Yeah, I don’t know what that’s supposed to mean.”
“Nearly.”
“Relation,” he repeated. He cleared his throat awkwardly and tried not to let his words betray anything negative. “Are you an AI, then?”
BASKERVILLE A.I. PROGRAM - BETA
Mycroft tightened his lips, studying him with a barely-there narrow of his eyes. Whatever he saw in Sherlock didn’t seem to be good. “I’m trying to tell you that John Watson will forgive you, given time,” he said quietly, voice turned down from its nasally usual into his more natural voice. It was achingly familiar. “Imagine if your doctor killed himself in front of you two years ago, and how you would be coping now. If you would still be alive, at least.”
“Hi, John,” she greets, smile not quite reaching her eyes. Rosie leans out of John’s arms towards her, and John motions for Molly to take her. She does, gently. “I wasn’t expecting you to visit. Not that I… it’s, um. A pleasure. If I knew, I would have…”
John was running, stumbling over foothills and past trees in his haste. Was he running from something? Towards something? All he knew was that he was sprinting, his legs free of pain, and he felt physically incapable of stopping.
He then stood at the entranceway to the kitchen, gaze trained on Sherlock as he drank and fiddled with the glass. He needed to say something. Sherlock leaned back in his seat to give him his full attention.
Sherlock blinks. “Pardon?”
“Is someone following us?”
“Yes…” John says slowly, suspiciously. There’s a rock forming in the pit of his stomach, and he really, really hopes that Sherlock’s (not?) about to ask if-
She’s almost too quiet to hear. Sherlock gives John one last look of betrayal, then cocks his head in invitation, eyes inquisitive and touched with a sort of sorrowful kindness that he only reserves for her. John wonders if he’ll ever forgive himself the way she’s already forgiven him. Self-conscience of the eyes on her, she walks up awkwardly to whisper something in his ear.
John could see why.
Sherlock blinked past the water, mouth pursed. “Like I’m the sun, or some other poetic rubbish.”
ME: What is stage 3?
He looks up and meets Molly’s eyes, where she’s cleaning off the plate that had the chicken wings. She looks worried. “Is… Is everything alright?”
ME: How do you feel about ‘Beta’? ‘Feel’ being a relative term, of course.
“It’s time.”
I have plans.” He pushed away her foot with his own and slammed the door.
Sherlock came into the sitting room as Mrs. Hudson left, clothed in an apron tied haphazardly over his pajamas and armed with a metal spatula. Why did he wear pajamas, John mused, if he wasn’t going to sleep in them? He was otherwise impeccable, as was the way of the world, and it took John much too long to notice that he was watching him with suspicion in his eyes.
A hand creeped back into Sherlock’s curls, just resting, and he didn’t mind. And then it tightened with a sharp pinch, and Sherlock nearly came just then.
John couldn’t accept it. He wasn’t scared of his death; he was scared of the Earth’s.
John narrowed his eyes thoughtfully. “How do you know?”
Their words overlapped, so John stopped with a chuckle and nodded Sherlock on. This was feeling too reminiscent of a first date. Sherlock cleared his throat, hands sliding into his pockets, before finding John’s eyes purposefully.
His breath felt knocked from his chest, air whooshing at the sheer feeling in John’s gaze, the raw emotion mixed with a distrusting edge that Sherlock immediately never wanted to see again. And it was aimed at
“I do seem to remember your overall unawareness, yes.”
John felt his breath catch in his chest, ice-cold vines spreading across his ribcage at the sight of the formal heading. “Oh,” he mumbled weakly.
“I’m not supposed to be,” John replied slowly. “I’m your doctor, not your partner in crime.”
He trails off when Sherlock drops his head into his hands, grounding the heels of his palms into his eyes. He makes a pained sound. “I’m not going to call you an idiot in front of your daughter,” he says through his teeth, evidently the most irritated he’s been at John in months. “So I’m merely going to think it very, very hard, in hopes that you’ll telepathically take the hint.”
It wasn’t the first time. With a shrug, John grabbed his duffle and took the regular stationary sidewalk, which was mostly empty of crowds. The climate was warmer than yesterday but pleasant, and higher in the arc there was a screen with the local news playing. The sound from the broadcast wasn’t intelligible unless he focused on it, anyway, so he wasn’t bothered. He seemed to have some familiar company on the path, though.
“No, I’m not listening,” John said honestly, mouth barely moving around his gravelled words. His brain was throbbing, and he tilted his head up the barest amount to glare at Sherlock over their table at the dining hall. “You drank more than me, why aren’t you miserable?”
Sherlock tried to keep anything resembling horror from crossing his features before nodding. Another night of ‘will-he-won’t-he’, hyperaware of every move, and touch, and look. Wondering if that lean will turn into a kiss, or if that hand will reach over to knead his thigh. “Excellent idea,” Sherlock said with an easy smile. “I’ll plan it for next Thursday evening, he has Friday off that week if memory serves.” It did, of course. “I’ll make sure he gets home before midnight.”
of you?”
“It’s not fun for me,” Sherlock admitted quietly. He didn’t think John could hear him, but he could, apparently.
Truer words have never been notioned. In the open, with normal people who had normal problems passing by him on the sidewalk, it was easy to focus on the things he needed to know rather than the things he already knew.
“I see you and Sherlock have been getting closer,” she commented. “He doesn’t get very close with people, so that’s great you two found each other...”
He said it like it was a date. John grimaced, looking at the flashing lights ahead and then back to Sherlock. “What kinds of questions?”
He could practically hear the other man rolling his eyes, which said something about how much John already knew the man despite their limited interactions. “
ME: My best friend was shot and killed two weeks ago. How do you suppose?
“Mmm,” John hummed back, mirthful.
“Oh, right.”
Exhaling shakily, Sherlock leaned back into his chair, relaxing just a bit with a barely-there wince. John was sympathetic; sleeping in a bolthole was never a comfortable option. “The moment I realized the shooter was you, I…” He closed his eyes. “That was when I knew that you were different. Well, that and the first ‘brilliant’, but namely… It’s just, you’ve, well, I’ve never known somebody that immediately cared as much as you do. For me. Anyone that I can even venture to call ‘acquaintances’ took a… bit of warming up before getting anywhere close, to say the least.”
“Her, she looks familiar,” John said absently, brows furrowed. It said her name was Alesia Brockton, though he was fairly sure he’d never heard that name in his life. Her pale eyes, staring directly at the camera, were unnerving in their intensity. “I’m… not sure how. Why are you asking?”
A pinch of ash flurried to the concrete. Sherlock scuffed it away. “What is it?”
ME: So Mycroft is winning?
Sherlock beneath him, his hands pressing harsh lines into John's shoulder blades. His cold lips trailing along warm skin, bathing the room in his irresistible scent. A kiss to the carotid artery. His eyes are a deep red, and his hair is endless as it brushes John’s jaw. Fog surrounds them. A hiss, the cool rasp of a frozen tongue on his flesh, and then a throaty, baritone sound, then the sting of sharpened fangs as they dig into his neck and John
“Actually, no. I’m not a ‘living thing’, remember?” He stood at that, crossing over to John in several gliding strides. “I don’t have a heartbeat, not anymore, and there’s no weapon alive that could penetrate my skin, save for those belonging to my own kind. Would you like to feel for my pulse?”
he says. “That’s interesting. Of course, I know how to play it, but that’s not what I was expecting.”
“Mycroft,” he greets cheerily.
Four weeks after their last night together, though, Sherlock broke that rule quite spectacularly.
that’s the case. So, John would have to appeal to the more traditional side, to the biology behind it all and how it could
John’s chest was still heaving when he was instructed to sit and buckle in at one of the chairs provided, his fingers numb when he tried to maneuver the straps. He eventually did it, but his hands were shaking with uncontrollable tremors.
without a case, you’d be shooting holes in the wall.”
Sherlock shrugs, but he looks pleased with himself. “She was interested. Who am I to ignore a curious mind?”
he hissed back. “Sherlock, the man that I… the man who… I watched him
“No,” John manages between gasping breaths. “I have-I have to-”
Soft curls brushed John’s chin as his head shook, cold hands bleeding through the small of John’s back. “No, not tired,” he said, and the hands curled John’s shirt into fists. “Human.”
John snickers, stretching out his legs and crossing them at the ankles. “I’m sure you could recite it word for word, the amount of times she’s made you suffer through it.”
“You need work like I need cases,” he rationalizes, t-shirt hem choking as Rosie attempts to climb him like King Kong. “If you go without it for too long, you’re an absolute horror to live with. Off with you!”
And, of all times and all places, that’s where John first saw Sherlock Holmes. Cup forgotten in his hands, John couldn’t help but pause – and that’s what would usually happen, was it not? When seeing someone so unbelievably beautiful, that’s what you would do, right? Stop and stare and hold on for dear life.
But Sherlock was already deep in his reading, eyes scanning the screen of his device with fervor. John wasn’t going to get an answer out of him any time too soon, so he instead went to fetch the nourishment he required, if it could be called that.
Shockingly, it’s freezing cold outside. John’s perched on the steps in front of 221’s door, breathing warmth into his hands and trying to keep his mind as deserted as Baker Street is, at the moment. Soon it’ll be bustling like it does every year, full of drunken patrons and groups of teens headed home from the fireworks display that just ended, but for now he’s grateful there’s only the occasional car passing by to worry about.
Blue roses and murderous brothers were temporarily pushed aside, and 221B returned to normal, if not aggressively platonic and free of the cobwebs that Stansex had cast upon it.
Sherlock stops playing, melody unresolved. Somebody turns up the telly on BBC to the crowds of people at the riverside of the Thames, all flashing colors and whistles and celebration. John wasn’t expecting midnight to come this fast. Sherlock stands, sets the guitar off to the side, and suddenly they’re upon each other, John’s breathing unsteady and quickening by the second. Air, he needs air-
John felt like his lungs were rubbed raw, yet he kept taking harsh, gasping breaths as his feet scrambled the canyon wall for purchase. Blood ran down his arms, his palms cut to shreds from tightening his grasp on the sharp rocks. The rising sun behind him was making itself known.
growl, albeit under his breath, and he dropped his food into the trashcan with a
Sherlock had rendered him speechless. There should be a medal for that, somewhere. Had Mary ever rendered him speechless? At that thought, Sherlock sobered and realized what exactly was happening. It was his
John cleared his throat, and Mycroft turned to him reluctantly. “Dr. Watson, a pleasure. Don’t worry about punishment, I know how persuasive my brother can be. You will need to immediately see our resident clinician, of course, to make sure you won’t be experiencing any lasting effects from your time outside.”
Either John was taking the piss, or Red Lake was something Sherlock deemed off-limits.
It was endurable, at least.
His tongue darted out to his fingers, and the grin turned manic. “Until then, let’s have some fun, shall we?”
Sherlock was contemplative. “I have a brother, you know. Seven years my elder.”
Sherlock turned, slowly, and met John’s eyes. He looked almost scared for the splittest of seconds, before painting his face carefully blank. “No,” he said lightly, not breaking their stare. The animosity was dimmed, but still smoldering beneath his eyes. “Thank you, Sarah.”
They say nothing more, but also make no move to continue on their way, and it’s awkward. John swaps their glasses and takes a sip of eggnog in a move to look more casual than he feels, but it just ends up awfully intimate. “You throw a good party,” he says after a beat.
“Not quite,” Sherlock echoed, slumping back into his chair. A couple days ago, he was full of grace and that odd sort of charisma John couldn’t place, a whirlwind of a man with long limbs and bright eyes. Today, though, everything was lackluster. His hair was limp at his scalp, there was the barest bit of stubble shadowing his jaw, and the skin below his brow was incredibly dark, like he’d taken soot on his thumbs and pressed them to the hollow of his eyes. He looked, for lack of a stronger word, absolutely exhausted. “Close, I concede.”
John was leaning unabashedly into his touch. “And you?”
not the case.
“Where are we going?” John asked after the fifth or sixth turn, starting to feel the slight pain in his leg once again. He was hoping to grow out of this limp eventually, if the therapist’s word was anything to go by. Psychosomatic or not, it bloody
"Sherlock Holmes ripped the limbs from the man, and began draining the body of blood. It is said that if he ever returns to the moors, an ancient curse will be freed and, in overall terms, something bad will happen,” Mary said, obviously disbelieving. John swallowed with a dry throat, and blood rushed an orchestra past his ears as he pretended not to believe, either.
“Rain,” Sherlock said off-handedly. John muttered in agreement.
“Capable of knocking you on your arse,” John finishes drily.
Sherlock watched him expectedly, eyes flickering to the phone. John shrugged. “Old friend, seeing if I was still coming to the village. Before the army and after my father’s death, the visits were like clockwork.”
The pale hand was just descending, hydrogen peroxide-soaked cotton ball ready, before John lightly grabbed his wrist to stop it. “Really,” he said, “It’s fine if you need me to do this part. I know that blood isn’t your…”
After that, she wandered off with the mutilated brain under her arm in tupperware. John couldn’t say that the interaction gained him any insight.
After a moment, the ship just… disappeared.
Disembodied, for lack of a metaphorical term. As if he was painlessly split limb from limb until only his thoughts remained. Like a light switch had flicked, bathing his body (wherever it may be) in something blacker than darkness.
exist. When something is so far out of the ordinary, there has bound to be some citations on the matter. So, simply, John typed:
John winced at the volume, rolling his shoulder with careful movements. Sherlock unwrapped his arm from John, once certain that he could stand without assistance, but kept himself close against John’s side. He cleared his throat.
Sherlock’s asleep. He’s sprawled out on his stomach, ankles hanging off one side and face smashed against the other. One of his arms is curled underneath him, while the other extends past the arm of the sofa, like he’s reaching for something beyond them both. It doesn’t look comfortable for anyone, let alone a 40 year old man, but his face is completely relaxed and his breathing is even. The leather shines from the condensation.
John felt some of the harsh lines seep from his shoulders at the beautiful sound. He was still cautious, but Sherlock had a way of calming him down as much as he could rile him up. “Oh? What ever were you going to ask, then?”
"Hm," John hummed, amusement tickling his stomach as he glanced around back at the station, watching the tram’s doors unfold. The phrase was vaguely familiar. "I would have thought you to be above pop culture references."
He scrambled against the wall’s face, grasping for purchase. His hands and arms were wet with blood, though adrenaline was far overtaking any pain he felt. There just wasn’t enough available air, and the atmosphere was heating up with increasing speed. He was beginning to lose his grip. And, if it made things any better, the orange glint of sunrise was beginning its ascent. “Need a little help here!” He yelled through gasping breaths. His right arm fell first, and suddenly he was (painfully) aware that all of his weight was hinged in his left shoulder. “Help! I need-”
John mulls that over, and decides that if he ever meets this ‘Benjamin’ bloke, he’s clocking him. “I’m hardly using Sherlock to write my essays,” John says carefully.
He began pacing, absentminded strolling by the window. “Oh, yeah, I travelled here with my flatmate.” That by itself sounded weird, so he tried to elaborate. “He’s… well, he’s a close friend of mine, so we made the trip.”
What? John stopped the machine, trying to control his breathing as he used one of the available towels to wipe his brow. He turned around to see what was just so fascinating.
Rosie’s practically screaming in delight. John dips her until she’s nearly upside down, hand cradling her head.
this evening. “I think I’d like another round.”
Trapped. He was trapped, like an animal.
Sherlock pursed his lips, a barely-there dimple flashing beside his mouth worriedly. “You shouldn’t, you know. Trust me.”
know was becoming scarily close to the truth. ‘Scary’ being an apt adjective in this scenario.
“Sherlock Holmes, right?” She said, smiling something conspiratorial. A rush tinged at John’s blood at the name, and he could only mutter his agreement. She continued on. “He’s not a very well-known legend, to be honest; it was only truly popular in our grandparents’ generation. It died off enough so that people our age in the village tend to know of it, but not pay it any mind.”
“Me?” John protested. “Where will you be?”
. After sawing through bone and fat as if preparing a cut of meat for hours on end, everything was hurting and his nose was beginning to sting from the stench. Sherlock seemed annoyingly unbothered throughout the ordeal, jotting down notes and studying the mangled body with unfaltering interest, and it made John all the more irritated. He’s seen his own fair share of blood and guts, after all, so he wasn’t about to let the posh scientist beat him in a game of…
They listened as the footsteps grew quieter the further down he got. Lestrade chuckled without humor, almost hysterical, and told the officers, “I guess fuckin’ write down pink, let future historians try and decipher it.” He turned to John and said, tiredly, “You better follow him. If you figure out what the hell he’s on about, give me a call, alright?”
As predicted, Sherlock returned the next day near lunchtime. His steps were quiet and stiff on the stairs, as he had most likely spent the night in less-than-ideal conditions. When he inched the door to the flat open, his clothes were rumpled and hair messier than usual. His face was calm, though he studied the flat with a cautious frenzy, meaning that he was making sure that he was alone. Which he decidedly
“Obvious,” John echoed, breathless. He couldn’t believe they were doing this. Sure, he had agreed, but he didn’t seem to have the right frame of mind lately. What happened to the good-old, rugby coach John Watson?
Bugger it. “I wish I could see you,” Sherlock sighed, cupping his hands around the face above him.
RJ slowly came back online, eyes turning unsure and hands moving his ship carefully onto the floor. John supposed that robot-like trance was some sort of protective technique when emotions (if they could be called that) spiked too high to handle. RJ cleared his throat.
A moment of quiet, and then the voice was almost gentle. “Because I need to determine if you’re worth the effort or not.”
Sherlock figured that that was enough.
“You know why,” the brother said quietly. There wasn’t any pity or regret in that smooth voice, but there seemed to be some softer emotion in play. “You’re getting too close to the truth. We’ve survived this long by keeping our existence a secret, and it’s how we live. How we survive. The men are nearing the Circle of Lebanon now.” John had passed the landmark earlier, recalling the curve of tombs around a great cedar tree. It wasn’t very far. “So, once again, I suggest that you run the opposite direction you came.”
Sherlock cocked his head. “I was never angry, John, only… thinking. I wasn’t ignoring you, either.”
John turned his head towards the noise – it was coming from a gaping archway, the stone doors of it ajar to the suffocating blackness that lied within it. He realized with a start that it was the entrance to the catacombs; from the time he had visited, back in primary, he remembered that they were off-limits to visitors. He wasn’t ready to oppose the rule. And yet, he couldn’t ignore the sharp tone of the mobile phone, his curiosity warring with the adrenaline.
Sherlock only looks at him, blurry around the edges, and completely ignores the bait. “
“You need to stop doing that, it’s unfair,” he said.
“I guess-“
“It… was brought up in conversation, yes,” John said slowly, leaning back in his chair. He stuffed the card in his pocket without a second thought. “Any reason for the visit?”
ME: Well played.
John leaned back further into his chair, far from relaxed but wary enough. “I don’t even remember my time in medical school. I’m not even sure if I…”
“You-
A pause, and then John was pushing him out of the crowd, guiding Sherlock around tables and chairs and people until he hit a wall. It was dark away from the dance floor, and surprisingly empty, relatively speaking. John’s hands were creeping up to his neck.
“Do you have…” Sherlock clears his throat. “Do you have anything to tell me?”
What do they look like, John wonders? Like friends, like lovers? Or have they always looked like this? He glances to the living room, where absolutely nobody is paying attention to them, and leans in closer. He’s not keen on confessing his undying…
“... Yes. That’s me,” John finished. “I’m assuming the captain told you?”
He heard a grumble, and then felt the presence behind his shoulder more than he heard the steps, cold air pressed to his back. From the corner of his eye, he could practically see the wheels in that brilliant mind turn and rattle in confusion. “Stansex,” he murmured.
outside.
John giggled again, louder this time. Sherlock added that to the mental tally of times he’s made John laugh since he’d came back. The list was far too small.
As if from a movie, John was waiting expectantly for him at the table, chair pulled away so he was unambiguously facing the door. His legs were crossed, and he was holding a lukewarm cup of tea expectantly atop his knee. It was a touch dramatic, but that’s what he had to resort to now, wasn’t it? “Oh, Sherlock. Hello.”
“You should give him a call,” John says finally. “Just… let him know you’re okay, at least. He cares about you.”
He could feel a delicious huff at the carotid artery. “You’ve figured out the best-kept secret of humanity by your own means, just by observation. Sherlock will be proud.”
“How old are you exactly?”
” Sherlock mimed back sardonically, seething.
The cemetery was quaint, in a word, a family of moss-draped oaks bathing the land in a greenish hue. The late afternoon was sharp with a dry wind flying over the moors. The gravestones were in no particular order nor structure, and as far as John could tell, there has been no new additions since the last time he visited. It took much too long to find his father’s slab.
A beat. “With a what, John?” Sherlock asks in a suspicious voice. “Use your words.”
John sighed and did as he was told, moving to sit atop the table and lift his shirt. He heard Sherlock hiss in a breath and mutter something that suspiciously sounded like ‘bastards’.
“Too messy, I’ve got enough blood on my hands as is. You know too much, though, getting too close to what I am. To what Sherlock is. Your search habits are very telling, good doctor.”
“Molly?” he asks, unsettled.
He finally spotted him in the shadows of one of the more larger machines, stacked up on one wall with deep crevices and winding wires. It was so ostentatious, John nearly believed that it was more decoration than of actual purpose. Dear god, was Sherlock expecting John to go all James Bond, as well? John kept close to the machines, but didn’t try to hide himself as much as the other man, who was currently ducked behind a large spool of rope.
John closed the distance with a desperate sound, wrapping his arms around Sherlock’s waist and crushing their lips together as close as the universe would allow. Sherlock scrabbled his hands along John’s shoulders and tried to push even closer. In both the blessing and curse of gravity, both men toppled into the sand beneath, Sherlock’s breath whooshing as his back hit the ground. It was worthwhile to have John above him, though, caging him into the earth. His giggles rumbled into Sherlock’s stomach.
When the food was brought, John didn’t disappoint. “So,” he began. “My scent?”
He thinks back to before the Fall, to the days where Sherlock was striking and harsh, cool and calculating, permitting an impossible air of condescension and capable (oh-so-willing) of tearing apart any passerby with his sharp tongue. Like he was always trying to prove himself. John had felt used, those days, like he was merely there to pass the time, but he didn’t care. He finally felt
Sherlock rolled his eyes, annoyed that John wasn’t catching on quicker. He jabbed a finger towards himself, eyebrows high and expectant. “Biomedical engineering. The reason clone lifespans now average 107 years, and cancer is, for the most part, obsolete. As of late, I’ve been toying around with a temporary delay in the virus’s increasing reach. It isn’t much, but it might buy the Earth a few more years at the most, if given the funding and proper application. I need to take air and lung samples outside of the dome. Only, it’s deemed too hazardous for the crew to leave, so I wouldn’t be able to get clearance.”
Sherlock tilted his head in John’s direction, lazy as ever despite the fact that they were barreling 20 over the speed limit just inside of London. He drove a jeep, fully loaded and matte black with industrially-tinted windows. The ray-bans he wore were sharply attractive. “What? I’ve never crashed in this car before, and the last few that were totaled could hardly be classified as fatal. I prefer to drive fast, is all.”
“Are you okay?” John asks, scanning over Sherlock’s face. “We lost you for a minute there.”
They had already disassembled the steps. There was no way for Sherlock to get back up.
Aggressively platonic. Right. John stepped away and shook his head. “You’re a dead man walking.”
A lot happier and moreso plumper since the last time they met, being with Mike was like riding a bike. If John could still ride, that is. Taking a sip of tea (his coffee had gone cold), John reveled in the frantic page turning of textbooks in the dining area and rushing students in the main halls.
John hummed through a smile, body slid all the way down until only his head was propped against the door, chin to his chest. “Yes,” he decided.
In quick, robotic movements, Sherlock grabbed his coat from the floor and stumbled out of the flat.
Sherlock says nothing. But he closes his eyes, so John supposes he understands, anyway.
with Janine, and…”
And he tried to ignore the way Sherlock’s neck had felt under his fingers, as hard and as cold as ice.
“... Okay. Remind me never to go to a Holmes family reunion?”
“That’s very uncharacteristic of you,” John commented offhandedly, carding his fingers through his own dusty hair once and deeming it proper. Sherlock flicked another curl in place, seemingly satisfied, and manhandled John to face him to he could redo the bow tie.
“Okay?”
, and that was enough.
“That sums it up,” John said dryly, earning a chuckle.
The fingers paused, and Sherlock’s eyes did that thing that John hated, where they got all sad before carefully turning blank. “It wouldn’t just be me that gets punished,” he said mildly. He finished the bow with a precise tug, and lingered another moment to straighten it. “Besides, this shouldn’t be too terrible, I’d think. We don’t even have to make conversation with anyone other than ourselves. I’ll go up when they announce the representatives to the public, you’ll stand with a polite wave when they introduce you as COM, you’ll dance with a few people and I’ll have a drink, and then we leave when it’s appropriate.”
John was livid when he came home from work. Absolutely livid
Sherlock’s hands run up John’s arms until he cups his face, palms cool and dry like a stone. His eyes are glassy and his breaths are shallow, and he shakes his head in short, quick jerks. “No one else,” he manages. “Just for you.”
“Yoo hoo!” Mrs. Hudson greeted, holding a stack of papers in her arms. “Oh, don’t mind me. My, Sherlock, it smells wonderful, if I knew you could cook I would’ve invited myself up more often! Here’s the mail for the week, then.”
ready, and then it pulls them apart. Bollocks.
“Right.” John fiddled with his lapel, and his shoes were pinched and squeaky against the floor. “I’ve been studying my arse off this past month, I think I’ve finally become a decent doctor,” he offered.
“Kathmandu.”
John was wary, but otherwise not feeling up for anything close to an argument. “Yeah, alright. At least get us one room, to keep the price down.”
Another sip. “Treating me well, I suppose. I’m living at Finsbury Park, all I can afford on a pension. I’m actually looking for a job to see if I can eventually upgrade. Know anyplace that could use an old washed-up army doctor?”
The Intersectorial Center for Astronomical Means was truly a sight to behold, once John had the mindset to behold it himself. Glimmering stacks of buildings surrounded the inside perimeter of the dome, of every material and shape but all consistent in their modernity. Darting between buildings and crossing over each other were the walkways, lines of powered conveyor belts that transported people from point A to point B in a matter of minutes. The sun was visible through the dome, though since the glass was so heavily protective most of the light came from illumination beneath the walkway and from glittering streetlamps stuck in organised patterns throughout the massive, city-like facility.
John nearly asks why, but then remembers. Sherrinford. Eurus. Sherlock’s nearly day-long absences once every few weeks, ones that John already knows the reasons behind but would rather not ask after. He misses hearing Sherlock play, but he wouldn’t be surprised if the violin has bad connotations at this point. He mentally chides himself for buying the sheet music. Instead of lingering on it, he hums in acknowledgement and turns back to studying the woodwinds on display.
The last of London’s reach narrowed out, and soon they were flying down the M4 through the flatlands and open sky, occasionally jolting over stumpy hills. John kept his eyes distinctly away from the speedometer, though he couldn’t help but notice that they passed up every car on the motorway, weaving to and fro between the sparse traffic.
Sherlock straightened his jacket, shaking himself into the present and quirking his mouth with something bittersweet. “In the flesh.”
(or wrong) things during Sherlock’s fits of boredom.
Easy for John to say. He wasn’t currently reciting the countries of the world in alphabetical order in a useless attempt to control a quickly hardening erection. “How are you-” Sherlock tried to helplessly ask, only having to choke off his words with a desperate sound when John tilted his head even more to nibble at his jaw.
Sherlock’s lips twisted, but it was more sheepish than anything else. “It was an experiment on you, to see how far I could push you. Surprisingly far, all things considered.”
John pursed his lips, and set his glass down at the counter. “Come on, at least try for a kip on the sofa.” Sherlock let him touch his arm, and John still could hardly swallow the shock of frigid skin under his fingers, hard like a stone. How long had Sherlock been sitting directly below the vent? Arms careful and legs bracing despite his limp, John did his best to lie the man down on the couch, covering him with one of Mrs. Hudson’s quilts.
John giggled. The cabbie gave a loud sigh. “I’m going to need an address soon, boys.”
Letting the system scan his Neuron-chip to log his movements and health data, John really just didn’t know what to think about the whole situation, though his curiosity still remained. People began to disperse around him to fill up their own areas, quiet chatter filling the air, and the computer loaded up a training exercise directly into his chip.
with him? He felt discomfort with women, men, and the one person he
and anything by the Brontë sisters in particular, like the romantic sop he is.
“Yes,” he said in a fine voice, blinking owlishly at John. It was easy to forget that the boy was an AI, his face reserved but eyes unabashed in the emotions they could portray. He was, despite talks of intelligence and responsibility, simply a child, after all.
The man didn’t laugh, only instead met John’s eyes again with a hard, thoughtful expression. “Your name?” He asked expectantly.
Sherlock’s bad humor melted away from his face, brows twitching in confusion, and then he almost looked
Sherlock makes a pleased sound, setting the puzzle off to the side so he can fold his hands together. “Multiple presents? I must’ve been a very good boy this year.”
John’s heart is trying to claw its way out of his chest. Sherlock sings a whole octave higher than his speaking voice, not a falsetto but something warmer and sweeter, at the very top of his chest.
he was so sobered at the moment. “Sherlock…”
“Yeah, I’d imagine,” she says, but her tone is odd. Before he can figure it out, she tilts her arms in his direction, overdramatically until Rosie hiccups a stream of giggles. “D’you want your daughter back?”
“You did this while I was asleep,” Sherlock says, like he's breathing the words.
“You might as well be.”
What a ride it’s been. Life, that is.
wasn’t my point.”
Sherlock suddenly
“You’re upset,” she commented lightly, as if talking about the weather. Which was 58°C outside the dome, the ceiling had said, in case anyone cared. “Why are you upset? Am I making you uncomfortable?”
Sherlock cleared his throat. “Thank you, John.”
Hours later at approximately three in the morning, the front door opened.
“It’s time,” Sherlock murmured, thumb rubbing John’s hand unabashedly. It wasn’t a question, and John didn’t take it as such.
So why was he in this situation?
friends,” John reminds him, pointedly. “And you decorated.”
“Oh, really?” Sherlock asked sarcastically, rolling his eyes at the stupidity. At least John had realized the error of his words right after speaking them, so there was
happened. That would be impossible. Well, so would vampirism, so maybe John should forget about what he knew at the moment.
“The body?” Sherlock interjected pointedly.
“It’s your fatal flaw,” he says in a whisper. “Thinking that everything I do is for Mary’s benefit, even when she’s not here anymore. Not letting yourself entertain the thought that maybe, just maybe, I simply enjoy your daughter’s company without feeling the need to distract myself with the Work. That I clean after you both because
He couldn’t lift his hand back up to the newfound holds, the pull of gravity much too strong in his weakened state. He felt the blood on his left palm begin to lessen the friction between skin and rock, and with horror he realized that he was beginning to slip.
ME: Please, no.
“Still at the old bakery. She’s living up to her name, I can tell you that. But I’m sure you can tell.” He patted at his stomach, earning a chuckle from John. “We’re expecting our second, actually. Our first is twenty-seven months.”
“Resident doctor,” he announced, tapping the title on his chest and hoping he was able to pull off this no-nonsense attitude. People didn’t like to argue with other people who showed authority. “I got a notification about someone requiring medical assistance. There better be a good bloody reason why it’s thirty minutes before wake-up and I’m not in my bed.”
He felt ridiculous. More than ridiculous. John was a firm advocate of the physicality of the world, a doctor of man and a believer in the human body. He shouldn’t be thinking the thoughts he was having.
John was thoroughly unsurprised. “So we weren’t being secretive at all, were we?”
“That’s-”
ME: I’m logging off now.
“Incoming neuron-print from Sector 11, ready on your mark.”
“Sherlock…”
“No one,” he said, turning his head straight forward. When she didn’t move, he sighed in defeat, and said, “Look, if I don’t leave now he’ll just go without me, so if you could-”
Twenty minutes later, Sherlock was covered in mud from crawling through the hole in the ground hidden by the dumpster, and John was sporting a cut on his arm from tackling Hawthorne as he tried to escape. But Lestrade had shoved the similarly-filthy criminal into the back of his car and was walking towards the two men with a breezy smile.
John felt his eyebrows come together. “My own good? Sherlock, I’m an adult. I’ve been to war, I’ve- just. No. I can handle life in danger of criminals ambushing us in the street and rogue experiments, you know.”
” Sherlock suddenly blurted, emphatically, as if the objection had come from the baser of his being. He tried to mask the emotion in his eyes, turning his head to stare off into the dining room once more, but he didn’t succeed. “It’s a bit too late for that, wouldn’t you say? Though…” he huffed. “Living together has certainly been immensely difficult.”
He hadn’t brought his keys or his phone with him. His gun was… somewhere. He vaguely remembered storing it back into his room after he returned from Devon, so at least the illegal weapon wasn’t strewn on the couch in plain, no-warrant-needed sight. Point being, the walk was entirely spontaneous, and he almost chastised himself for being so single-minded. His bare feet were blistering against his shoes, but that was the least of his problems.
“There,” he said in a rough voice. “Drunk.”
“Only a few seconds,” the redhead piped up. John had always been bad at names. “D’you remember who hit you?”
“You’d be dead
Molly sighs quietly, and lets Rosie play with her hair without even so much of a wince. She seems to be mustering up the courage for this next part. “Can you… tell me, John? Exactly what happened? Before…” Her voice falls flat.
It was just sex, the messy, horrid thing that made Sherlock’s palms sweaty and mouth dry when he thought about it. The messy, horrid thing that meant nothing to John. The thought of Sherlock’s one-sided
She narrows her eyes, but a smile threatens at her lips, so John’s fairly sure he’s in the clear. She looks back down at Rosie to murmur in a way even more gentle than Sherlock, and then nods her head towards the man in question. “How’s the fr- Holmes, by the way? With all of this? I’d ask, but that’d mean we were on friendly terms.”
“I sincerely empathize with you there,” Sherlock said gravely.
John would get something medical somewhere on his back, perhaps the chemical compound for adrenaline (which he liked to doodle on spare paper) or the caduceus (morality), if so inclined. If even
"Yet," John replied without heat. He barely knew the man, after all, and in such a precarious situation it wasn't a great idea to waste time squabbling. “Go through the plan again, you weren’t very clear the first time."
The man’s cheeks were beginning to fade to a more normal shade of pink, rather than the intense red they just were before. He was a clone, at least.
ME: Very funny. Seems as though your humor processor is in working order. Perhaps I should put in a request to deactivate it.
“I don’t,” John said quickly, lifting his head to trail his eyes instead around the dining hall. He wanted to milk this, just a bit. “You know, when someone’s training partner is missing, that someone gets paired up instead with the captain. Who does not ‘go easy’, in any sense of the word.” Every part of his body was throbbing, and while he was used to aches and pains at this point, he wasn’t accustomed to the ringing in his ear from Lestrade’s bellowing voice in close proximity.
John himself was nursing lemonade. “Nope, nothing. It’s bizarre, he treated me as if I were an old enemy who pissed in his tea. To put it mildly.”
John turns his head to look at him, right as Sherlock looks away. Mrs. Hudson doesn’t even notice his disinterest, still talking a mile a minute, and John watches him nod in mock-agreement and surreptitiously down the rest of his eggnog, leftover from Christmas. He dangles the glass in front of her eyes with only his thumb and forefinger as evidence, as if to say ‘oh, would you look at that’, and excuses himself to the kitchen. John chuckles and turns back. “Sorry, what was that?”
“I’m almost finished with my work!”
before tossing it off to the side. The waves crashed and rolled with the storm.
“Excellent observation, John, truly a riveting sight to behold.” He flipped to the next page, eyes only flickering up to John’s face to narrow and then return to the book. His irises were getting darker by the day, John noticed, and his mood directly followed the trend.
“Happy New Years Eve, doctor,” Mycroft greets primly, damn umbrella swinging from where it’s looped around his wrist. Snow litters his hair and soaks the welcome mat, though the partygoers have already tracked it into 221B enough for it to be negligible. Mycroft cocks his head. “How’s your knee, by the way? I noticed that you tripped outside of the clinic last Wednesday.”
John froze, eyes widening, and he came with a drawn-out groan. He hit his head against the wall at his back, hands scrabbling against Sherlock’s shoulders as he rode it out. Sherlock’s hips were beginning to shake beneath them. John unwound his legs and carefully returned to solid ground again.
“Thanks,” he said. “Promise we’ll leave the moment it’s acceptable?”
The room was modest, the furniture well-crafted but not flashy. Dropping his things onto the bed closest to the door, John scrubbed a hand over his face as Sherlock inspected the room service menu with little interest. It was nearing on five, and while Plymouth had much to offer, John was wrung out from the drive.
“AB+,” Sherlock answered promptly, not even glancing up from his laptop. He was still dripping from his shower. “I’m not donating blood, John.”
“And for you?”
He crowds John against the table. John feels his heart pulsing on the side of his neck, sees the mirror of it in Sherlock’s carotid, this close. Sherlock swallows.
He huffed out a broken exhale. And then, his large hand completely enveloping John’s, his mouth suddenly split into a blinding and achingly boyish grin, face painted in adoration. His eyes were swimming. It took John’s breath away.
That night, Sherlock awoke from sleep with the most painful feeling he’s ever had, right inside of his chest. Like every pulse of that dreaded muscle in behind his sternum was killing him rather than keeping him alive.
“You’re only thirty-six, yes?”
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “Unnecessary. I need a second opinion; we’re going to the morgue.”
“Understood.”
“Wait a second,” Harry interrupted, finishing off her cup of juice during one of her visits. John, in his own determined way, refused to stock alcohol in his flat. “So you’re saying you didn’t do anything? Didn’t give him a dirty look, shag his girl, nothing?”
Later on, John let himself have a drink. He forbid himself from going overboard ever again with Sherlock in mind, but it seemed to be one of those nights that warranted a bit of numbing. He hardly noticed it whenever Sherlock finally arrived, deep into the nighttime and unsteady on his feet.
“No, they’re overplayed! Maybe-”
A breath. And then, ever so slowly, John lifted up his own hand so that it pressed against Sherlock’s through the glass. He liked to imagine that he could feel the man’s warmth against his palm.
Sherlock, though, didn’t take his eyes off of Molly. “She’s the representative for Sector 11, geoscientific monitoring. We tend to cross our paths time and again, whenever one of us is researching anything regarding the virus. She’s a nice girl, a bit forward at times, and she has a rather large crush on me. She’s our ticket out of here.”
You know what? Sod that.
“Need a little help here!” John yelled with a thin voice, severely deoxygenated and starting to truly feel the effects. This atmosphere was definitely not fit for human consumption. Suddenly, the handhold under his right hand crumbled away, flinging his arm back to his side, and his left shoulder began to scream in white-hot pain as it became the only thing holding John’s body weight.
“Myth.”
ME: It’s either this or the impending World War III. At least the news hasn’t set off any nuclear bombs, as of yet. With hope, this could be the turning point the governments need towards worldwide peace and cooperation to find a solution.
John’s eyes bugged out of their sockets, and his back stiffened to ramrod-straight. “R-requested?” He stammered, “Requested by whom, exactly? Who’d want me for a doctor?”
It was a bit flattering, to be honest. John didn’t even know what he was missing, until the first time he saw someone piss Sherlock off and tear down the thin wall of civility the man barely had. Sherlock had a quick mouth and an alarming eye for detail, and John had had a first row seat to the show at the time. Was this what Mike was
How many, many a mile!
“I see,” said John. “Can you turn into a bat?”
“Then keep doing what you’re doing,” Sherlock managed between his teeth, head knocking back into the wall. John huffed humidly against his neck, and he released Sherlock’s hair to yank down his own trousers.
got repetitive, the number of times it came up (constantly), but he had to make it stick somehow. Sherlock had moved right along from the raw pain he felt with John in the beginning into a more dull, ever-present ache.
“What blood type are you?” John asked that morning, a whim of a question. He was sipping a coffee, his drink of choice after a sleepless night; recently, a near daily occurrence.
“Yes, an insurmountable one.” John takes a sip of water, perches it on the hard curve of his knee. “Fortunately, the title has since been passed on to me.”
Sherlock Holmes. Drunk last night and going to Molly’s, spilling out the secrets of the past, what, five years? Coming on six?
A decent start. He began with what he knew about the (thing) man:
Sherlock doesn’t stop scrubbing, says nothing. John knows he spoke loud enough.
that. I’m just… how is that possible? That thing you did back there?”
18 FEBRUARY 2016
“Beg your pardon?”
John mustered up a tired smile. “You too.”
“Moriarty,” Sherlock began one morning over toast, eyes training unblinkingly at John and teacup up to his lips. At the word John’s eyes flashed up, mouth pursing and spine straightening hard for a split moment before he forcibly relaxed. He turned his eyes back down to the newspaper in his hands as if he hadn’t just reacted. Telling, very telling.
Sherlock was just down the hall, hand on the doorknob to one of the classrooms, and from what John could see he was shaking with quiet laughter. Instead of breaking the silence between them, it only irritated John. Who was
Sherlock’s eyes slid somewhere behind John, and he huffed out an amused breath. John cautiously turned to see what he was looking at. When he saw, he couldn’t help but snort too.
“So,” Sherlock continues, “Despite countless assurances that Janine was for a case and that absolutely nothing happened with the Woman, and the fact that you’re
“They connected the training facility to the warehouse beside it, since we won’t be requiring day-long training anymore,” Sherlock said absently, scrolling through his phone without much interest. His eyes nearly looked white from the screen’s reflection. “We’ll just take the walkway there, no need for a car. Though I suspect my brother gave in to appearances and had himself driven there,” he had to add with a bite in his tone. He still wasn’t in good graces with Mycroft, for a reason John never precisely figured out.
He could ask. He could turn Sherlock around and demand him to tell him what happened, to scold him for not showing John before, for not feeling as though he could confide such a secret in him.
But Sherlock was laughing. “Come now, John, you don’t even know what I was going to ask!”
“Why are you
“Buck & Bear?” He asked slowly, blinking away the fog. “What’s that? Some sort of hunting-themed thing?”
“Ready?” Sherlock murmurs.
After a beat, she nods and sits at her armchair, setting Rosie on her thighs and supporting her back. John follows to the couch, and when the silence begins to get uncomfortable, he takes a deep breath and says, tentatively: “Molly, I’m sorry for everything that happened. Sherlock’s sorry, too, I promise. It’s not… It’s just, we didn’t have any choice. If it weren’t life-and-death…”
Sliding into the other empty seat in a flurry, Sherlock braced his forearms onto the table and leaned forward conspiratorially.  “It’s time,” he said in lieu of greeting.
Sherlock huffs a laugh, placing John’s empty glass off to the side. “They’re your friends,” he says. “You invited them.”
“Are you positive about all of this?” John asked.
“Like a conveyor belt,” John stated.
Rosie’s cry sounds from the floor above. Sherlock kisses him sweetly, one last time, before dropping his head to John’s shoulder to catch his breath. “I’ve dreamt about this,” he admits.
So, John promptly switched therapists and then nearly died. Maybe that was destiny telling him to get his arse into gear.
He doesn’t wait for long. “Oh, go on,” Sherlock finally sighs, falling into the chair opposite and sweeping out his hand. The mild annoyance in his features is oddly comforting.
“Sherlock Holmes,” Mike said simply.
John realized that his eyes weren’t just adjusting to the darkness, but that the first hints of dawn were beginning to lighten up the sky. He pushed himself up into sitting position, grunting at the tender spot at his side where Sherlock had shoved him. The chill was aching at his shoulder and thigh, but he’d be damned if he was letting his limp return. Ever since he got to the ICAM, the change in scenery had made it dormant.
It all comes to a head after dinner.
‘Address?’
Sherlock laughs, and by the relaxing of his shoulders John can tell he’s also relieved by the change in subject. They look back to the table. There’s only a few more little things that John nabbed up, and Sherlock sets down the pipe to instead study a piece of sheet music.
Five different people with five different circumstances, and yet they were all drawn back to living in the village. It was a nice village, to be fair, the population growing steadily as the main cities grew larger and more people discovered the beauty of the moors.
“Untrue.”
John blinked. “That’s… thanks?”
Sherlock complied, pausing the training mode. John couldn’t help but sigh at the relief of his chip dimming down, his brain beginning to feel whole again. “You’re good,” he said dumbly.
It was cool between them, but still, no exhalations coming from Sherlock's closed mouth. Suddenly, he made a soft noise in his throat and dropped his head to John’s shoulder, pressing his face to the fabric there.
“Thank you,” he said.
Which brings John to his next point: Sherlock Holmes was completely blind in his deduction when it came to John.
At 10:00 on the nose, John was standing with the crew beneath the entrance to the DSE Intrepid, awaiting for official orders from the captain. He spotted a tall head with curly hair further into the crowd, and John reluctantly inferred that Sherlock’s next ‘appointment’ must not be until later. Realizing he was feeling that strange anger again, John physically and inconspicuously pinched his thigh to snap out of it.
John’s lips quirked, and that felt like a victory. He aligned their bodies and sank down, hissing through his teeth past the pain and heat and into pleasure. Sherlock wanted to meet him, to thrust his hips up into shared space, but he knew John needed this sense of power. To have control while everything else was falling.
push it towards ‘worth it’ territory. And if John was finding himself almost asking the man himself later on in the night, then, well, he could just blame it on the alcohol.
“Who said there was?”
Sherlock’s eyes flashed with something almost frightened, but John shook his head. He reached up with his free hand to yank at his skin-tight neckline. “I’ll talk you… through it.”
“Ah. No. I don’t think we will be, either. Things are different now.”
John Watson has been in love twice before in his entire life; once, with a perfectly normal woman who had built him up from the ashes she had found him in, and then had (of course) revealed herself to be a dangerous assassin right before getting herself killed.
but the car stayed perfectly in its lane. He opened his eyes with a sharp exhale through his nose. “Nope, didn’t help. Something else.”
Sherlock helped him up, but didn’t relax his stance. “Come on, John, I’m sure you’ve seen your fair amount of danger.”
He hears the front door open and close behind him. Something heavy drops over his shoulders, and he’s mildly surprised to discover it’s his own jacket. “Thanks,” he says. “Look, Sherlock, I’m sorry-”
Sherlock had called him a romantic, back during his wedding. How bloody right he was.
“Why bother?” John teases, gesturing down to Sherlock’s pajama-bottoms-and-tee-clad frame, dressing gown long since shed in his restlessness. “You look perfectly decent to me. Just slide on some slippers and a scarf, and you’ll be ready to go.”
“I can’t ask?”
Well.
Now, with air to breathe, John could settle. Mary treated it as just a legend, something that was created solely to terrify people. Granted, any sane person would treat it the same as well, but John was slightly insane, so the legend was being treated as an academic source. But in the style she told it, there was no room for interpretation: it was just a story, and nothing more.
“Hey! There’s someone outside!” He heard someone yell.
Sherlock’s eyes gentled, even though his cheekbones looked near menacing along the line of his coat’s collar. His smile became something wistful. “And I, you.” He then, very tentatively, held up his hand so it pressed against the glass between them.
Quirking his lips, he lifted the police tape and motioned John ahead of him.
“I’m…” He leaned further, his voice drawing out quietly, at a complete juxtaposition to his words. “I’m awake. I’ve no interest in sleeping, or resting. You…” His voice was utterly defenseless. “You make me want to feel
“You can’t do that,” he said.
Sherlock’s expression dropped, but not by much. His eyes darted all over John’s body, never lingering anywhere too long, and in the end it seemed to be fruitless. “I’ve told you before, I can’t. Not very well, anyway. You… there’s something about you, something that I can’t read. I see you as anyone else would see you, though with a few notable differences.”
March turned into April, April paved way for summer, and life went on.
Sherlock glanced up, face the epitome of innocence. “Just experimenting, is all.”
They ended up being put into ‘quarantine’, a blindingly white room split into two with a pane of glass in the center. On one shared wall was a huge window, looking out to the ICAM as the sun began to rise. Above the city, the protective dome was nowhere to be seen.
“Without a doubt, we’ll be there.”
That spurred John into action. He shuffled even closer, and despite himself Sherlock stepped back, legs knocking the back of his chair. John didn’t notice, stopping just a few strides away.
BASKERVILLE A.I. PROGRAM - BETA
John locked his jaw closed, knowing when and when not to challenge authority. Sherlock, unfortunately, did not possess that skill.
“John!” Sherlock greeted abruptly, voice muffled through his mask, a tad unsure. Apparently he had caught onto John’s sudden change in attitude, and John found himself immediately feeling bad about it. Sherlock hadn’t done anything wrong, after all.
Even if- well. Commander, I hardly think that’s any of your-”
Oh, thank god they understood. Hurriedly, men in protective suits rushed into the room, maneuvering Sherlock into his own suit. The process wasn’t long, and while John understood it was necessary, he couldn’t think anything more eloquent than to
Contrary to popular belief, John Watson is no stranger to being in love with a man.
Beneath the digital time was the smaller countdown, bright red and down to seven minutes. As John settled, arms wrapped loosely around his knees, he watched the families usher inside, only to open curtains to watch the incoming light show. Others pulled out lawn chairs, cracking a beer and laughing boisterously with friends. John could see one or two others far off follow his lead, climbing onto their roofs to experience the aurora.
(the only literature he’s admitted to liking), and his hands freeze above a navy, rectangular box. His fingers flutter.
ME: Yes. You know, a name. My name is Sherlock. My landlady’s name is Mrs. Hudson. I have a friend named George Lestrade. And then there's Jo
And then he hesitated. Not in the vampire way, in the way that he would battle between sinking his teeth into John’s carotid artery or not, but in a completely different way, the way that softened his eyes and dropped his lashes, the way that thickened the pregnant air between them, hands settling on the table’s edge. Their foreheads brushed.
John tilted his head. “You really need to do this, don’t you?”
“Explain it to me,” he says instead.
Classic.  “Not what I said,” John said lightly, shedding at the table. Scooping up the cane, John tapped the phone on speaker and cursed even louder when it wouldn’t compute. “Damn phone.”
Something dropped in John’s chest like a stone. “Oh,” he said slowly. “Oh. Well, if you’d like, I can talk to Mycroft to see if there’s anything he can do towards helping me switch rooms with-”
ME: As your GPS has undoubtedly noticed, we’ve been spending the majority of our days in the Baskerville facilities. Mycroft has made funding it his top priority, and there’s talk that human cloning is going to begin in its experimental stages. Because of these dire circumstances, humane human experimentation has been given approval.
John makes to follow, but it’s as if there’s a tether at his waist, keeping him in place without a hint of yield. He knows
“Not now, Sherlock, I have errands.” Grabbing his keys and stuffing them in his pocket, he gave Sherlock one last glare before shuffling down the stairs. He was getting better with his cane, but the damn thing still made it hard to make a dramatic exit.
“Still here,” John muttered testily.
“How… sensible.” John’s lips were pursed. “We’ve only seen it twice, though.”
She’s looking at him strangely. “How are you two?”
She seemed to mull over how to word something, but in the end she blurted: “Are you going to the banquet?”
expect.
John blinked out of his daze, turning back to his partner. “It’s nothing, I just must’ve met her earlier. What about her?”
Sherlock’s silver eyes narrowed, sharp and suddenly calculating. “Are we?”
Sherlock, after all, John has years of experience with.
Drunk. John’s never seen Sherlock drunk, and if
Outside the dome, John had heard, is the closest to silent nature can get. No wind left to give, and insects were some of the more recent organisms outside of mammals to fall victim to the virus. The waves of the ocean were far enough away to stay unheard.
That smile came again, the one with the dimples and the mirthful eyes. “I promise, John.”
“Please, John?” He asked carefully, body relaxed despite their chips bombarding with tactics, John’s own particularly pushy. He knew Sherlock was getting struck with the same. The baritone voice continued on. “If I get this information together now, there may be hope for the scientists still on Earth to go further with it after our departure. This is their last hope.”
yes, Sherlock, I’ve heard of Coldplay. I’m more amazed that you have.”
John turns his head to the side and smirks.
With a sigh, John let it go. For now. Opening his eyes, he watched Sherlock gnaw at his thumbnail, feeling himself get distracted before remembering that he had two more questions to ask. “There was a dent on the car, and paint under your nails. Did you stop the car from hitting me?”
“... Then Scott meets Hamish. The one person he cannot observe like the others, where he can’t tell if his testosterone is higher than normal right now or which park he went to yesterday morning. He can’t detect these things, because the overall

sparring, but he nodded along all the same, though still puzzled. “Okay, yes. And you’re trying to leave because…”
Sherlock turned down one of the main streets, keeping a lookout as well. “You told Sarah that you always left the night before.”

Occasionally, John goes into work. It’s not
Why was he being so unabashedly kind? Usually he would keep his gentle nature subtle, and then cover it with an insult to save face. Now, John’s heart was throbbing with such ferocity that he’s sure Mrs. Turner’s married ones next door could hear it. He tried to shift the focus. “What do you dream about?”
That didn’t seem to be the right thing to say. With a purse of his lips, Sherlock crossed his arms and leaned back further into his seat, looking John up and down. “You’re not very exciting.”
“... Watson? Oi, Watson!”
Was Sherlock Holmes dangerous?
ME: It’s utterly fascinating, as well as detrimental, obviously. Wherever you go, whether it's turning on the telly or grabbing a pack of cow tongues from the store, it's all anyone can talk about.
“Do you really need to do this? This isn’t just... an experiment that you want to do, but something that you have to do?”
ME: That’s a lie, my chest constantly feels like it’s being torn to shreds. I was hoping that that would be relieving to admit, but I feel no difference. Maybe I’m dying. I’m unfamiliar with the grieving process, but I’m not sure how much longer I can reasonably tolerate this.
Sherlock’s cat-like eyes were narrowed thoughtfully, and he gave a quick nod as if he won some sort of debate in his mind. “He’ll talk to you.”
STOP;
Did Sherlock’s brother order them not to make conversation, in case John could convince them away from killing him? Seemed likely. He huffed out a breath, moreso irritated than wary. “Go on then.”
“I… er-”
Sherlock’s hands tighten.
“Oh, er,” John muttered, pressing up against the ropes behind him. He crossed his arms across his chest. “John. It’s John-”
The sudden words didn’t startle John, but they nudged him into action. He pushed up with a groan and closed out of the simulation before turning around to his supposed sparring partner.
Thirteen’s face was downturned towards the ship, but John spotted a small smile. “It will,” he admitted. “I’m not done yet.”
ed out of existence the moment it could.
When she brought up the banquet, John found himself wholly unsurprised.
He jabs at Sherlock’s stomach until he drops his arm in self-defense, his own breathing shallow and rapid and, he’s sure, his heart in his eyes. “Don’t test me.”
John makes a mental promise to punch Mycroft in the nose the next time he sees him. As it is, he nudges the detective as he strums, the rhythm aimless and vague, now. “I’ve been thinking,” he says, ignoring Sherlock’s snort. “About what you said, a few months back. If we had met whenever we were younger. I think that… I would’ve liked you. Even if you were a git, like whenever we first met, because we’re still together years later. Somehow. Er, point is. I don’t think there’s a certain age we could’ve met at, or a certain place, or even a certain circumstance that wouldn’t have eventually brought us right here. Where we… are supposed to be.”
The man was unpredictable, so Sherlock wasn’t sure how much good his ‘expert opinion’ was in this circumstance. John had seen death and had brushed it himself once before, so it wasn’t a near-death state of shock that he was reacting to. There hadn’t been a flare-up of his PTSD (his nightmares had waned over the last few months, and Sherlock hadn’t heard him screaming in weeks), and his limp was still a non-issue. On paper, John Watson was perfectly fine.
There it is, like tugging out a stray hair from the root. The pain is sharp and oh-so-welcome. Sherlock’s hands spasm on John’s face, and he stammers, “I… yes. The same.”
Feeling particularly brave, John pressed an arm against the center console to lean over. Sherlock, only sparing a glance back at the road, watched him close in with unmasked interest. “Good,” John said with purpose, running his tongue slightly along his bottom lip. Sherlock followed the movement with rapt attention, mouth parting.
“Blue,” Sherlock said slowly, voice so deep it vibrated into the earth. “Artificially colored, obviously. I don’t precisely know the meaning behind the color, though I do know that roses are not a common flower to bring to a gravesite, unless the one who brings it had a romantic relationship with the deceased.” His head quirked, a question. “Is your mother here?”
“I just called a cab, you have five minutes.”
John seemed to sober, but resolve pushed passed the blur. He pushed forward, shaking off Sherlock’s grip and gripping his hands back on his waist. “You’re drunk too,” he accused. “This is just... It’s fun.”
The words didn’t register. The virus? Exodus, universally accepted by all as the contagion that singlehandedly brought humanity down to its knees? Found as a hormone in everyone’s blood plasma, it mimicked the properties of estradiol in women and testosterone in men to gain access to the body and negate fertilization. As if something that proven didn’t exist? “What are you even talking about?” John asked incredulously.
“Not France?”
“This isn’t going to be easy,” Captain Greg Lestrade of the DSE Intrepid stated, strolling down the walkway between both lines of evenly-spaced crewmen. His voice bellowed in the quiet. “I’ve been easy the last couple of days, let the record show, only giving out simple exercises to get you nice and loose for our remaining month together. That ends now.”
“What?”
“We’re walking through the main entrance,” Sherlock replied.
Sherlock presses his lips together. “Alright.”
John couldn’t say that he missed the war, but he couldn’t say he didn’t miss it, either.
It’s been nearly a month since their last (worthwhile) case. The feeling in the flat is… tense. But familiar.
of course
"I could kill you." Sherlock's jaw tensed, eyes darting to the side and swaying his body the barest centimeters back. "I try to be good, John, I
On the third morning of John’s training, though, he hardly spared a thought for Sherlock Holmes. Not because the man could be easily forgotten; more or less for the fact that Sherlock himself had arrived with an aura that John had difficulty believing. There was something about him that John couldn’t place, an eccentricity that seemed more natural written in words rather than real life. It was easy not to think about a man that could have easily been from a book in John’s childhood. A man that didn’t exist in the first place.
Hours before dawn, John thrashed awake with an inhuman sound, startling Sherlock who hadn’t been able to fall back asleep after awaking from John’s hand unconsciously brushing his own. Sherlock, alarmed, touched John’s shoulder and John rolled on top of him in a flurry, blindly wrestling his hands above his head and pinning them to the pillow. His knees caged Sherlock’s hips.
Sherlock was running, running through dirty alleyways and over dumpsters and up fire escapes. He could hear John’s heavy footfalls far behind him sloshing through the filthy London water, and he deliberately slowed a bit to let the man catch up to him. A year ago, he wouldn’t have bothered; now that the blossoming fondness had grown into something akin to friendship, he had more of a… respect for the man. If that was the word.
Sherlock only smiled, heartbreaking, and John convinced himself not to be affected.
at what he didn’t. He was alone, now, the bleak beginnings of morning peeking through the curtains and slanting the sitting room in washed-out shades of blue. Sherlock, with endless patience that had only emerged during these past few days, respected John’s need to be given breathing room.
Sherlock rolled his eyes, doing some warm-ups on his own. His mouth seemed permanently pressed into a white line. “Part of my punishment,” he sulked.
“If the virus doesn’t exist anymore…” John said uneasily, “... then what is killing everything else?”
John nearly refused to save face, but this was the most permission he’d ever have to touch a damned interesting medical phenomenon, an
he’d said with a small, eager smile of his own.
John felt a bruise on his shoulder, where something that felt like metal had pushed him out of the way. Something strong, much stronger than human flesh.
John’s skin was still cold when he arrived back to the hotel. The legend itself was lounging on one of the beds, flickering through channels on the telly.
John could cry.
fine,
“How long have you been thirty-six, then?”
The land surrounding the lake was flat except for one steep hill, making John feel oddly as if he was back in Afghanistan, where he could see a person walking towards him miles before they arrived. Their pace was slow, and Mary aimed a torch in front of their feet so they wouldn’t trip over any rocks. John cleared his throat.
“Naturally,” John replied. He eyed the newly-renovated facility, now set up into individual pens separated by rope. Boxing rings, he vaguely recognized. “Do we have partners, then?”
he says, waving his hand like he’s smacking at a fly, and his own drink sloshes out onto his hand.
John furrowed his eyebrows and glanced down to his feet, which had been pacing the hotel room without even the smallest jolt. Unfortunately, when Sherlock called attention to it, he felt the damned muscles begin to lock up. “Shit,” he muttered, plopping back onto the bed as if his strings had been cut. His phone was jabbing into his side, so he pulled it out of his jeans pocket and dropped it to the bed.
John was about to thank him, slightly embarrassed, before making a realization with narrow eyes. His tone was accusatory. “You got out of the car the same time I did.”
John leaned down, feeling a sick sort of thrill at looming over the man. His hands steadied on those broad shoulders. “If you’re not human,” John said, “Then what can you be?”
Before, he had done what he pleased, going out all night without a word otherwise or destroying John’s jumpers or putting a milk carton of compost in the fridge and, overall, acting as though he still lived alone, though more accidentally than with purposeful displeasure. He realized that now. But ever since the pool incident, things had… shifted. He was still a selfish bastard, but John didn’t seem to mind it as much. And Sherlock had no qualms making exceptions to his nature, if it meant seeing John in a good mood. For the first time in his life, Sherlock had learned compromise.
He darted forward, and John had no choice but to follow.
ME: Cheeky.
“For God's sake, Sherlock, what am I supposed to think?” John questioned, shaking off Sherlock’s hands. They kept the same distance, close enough that John could see barely-there flecks of gold close to Sherlock’s pupil. Those same pupils dropped to John's mouth, and then back up again. “When you ignore me for a month after a very specific turning point, there’s not much else I can figure. Between this and all of the things you’re not telling me, it's a medical miracle that I don't have whiplash.”
“It’s all science!” called Sherlock from the kitchen.
John doesn’t look back.
One day, no cases on in the last couple of weeks and Sherlock’s mannerisms beginning to get snappish, John proposes that they visit the antique’s fair over in Islington. It’s a bi-weekly event, rows of tables lining the passage swarming with people, the various stalls overflowing with the most delightfully random of artifacts. It’s an uncharacteristically warm September morning outside, after all, one of London’s rare cloudless days with a shimmering sun that is near-white against the blue; the perfect day for a stroll.
on tumblr! I post little drabbles on occasion, and I'm open to prompts :>
“Well, I
somebody to ask, just so I can shake them by the shoulders and ask them how much of an idiot they are if they can’t see the answer right in front of their eyes?”
“I got it… years ago,” John said carefully, his breath nearly back. “I know it’s ugly. It doesn’t bother me… too much anymore.”
“No,” Rosie protests, but it’s half-hearted. Sherlock chuckles and nods to the shopkeeper, turning on his heel with John right behind him.
Sherlock felt his blood heat at the sight. Dropping to his knees, Sherlock grabbed John’s waistband on either side to both free his erection and tug his hips closer to the edge. Hands dropping to dig into John’s clothed calves, Sherlock swallowed down his cock in one move.
The sparring wasn’t too harsh this time, just light back-and-forths that pushed John further and further into the rhythm. It was obvious that Sherlock had backed off, after hearing that John had never fought before. He didn’t seem bored, but he had a breezy air as he worked John around the mat with sure, precise movements. Only the sheen of sweat to his skin and the half-smile betrayed his investment.
“Never bothered you before.” John’s voice sounds terribly fond. “I’ve long gotten used to your violin playing at random hours of the night.”
“Hello, my love. Did you have a nice day with Sherlock?”
“Is your friend alright?” The shopkeeper asks, an older man with hair down to his waist. John almost replies, but he instead presses his lips together in a tight semblance of a smile, nodding a vague assurance, and turns back to the matter at hand. He’s not sure what he should do. At the very least, he plucks his daughter from Sherlock’s arms in case the mental absence is a hint towards something worse, Rosie none the wiser.
His head cocked, infinitely curious. “Do I dazzle you?”
Damn. “You’ll have to be more specific.”
Eventually, Sherlock found an inn that seemed much too grandiose for a casual two-night stay. Also well out of John’s price range, if he paid half. Sherlock, for all of his whining over being unable to read John easily, seemed to hear the unspoken question directly from its source.
"That's precisely what I'm suggesting," Sherlock said simply. As if an afterthought, he added: "And don't call me Shirley."
It shouldn’t take an hour long, at most.”
Sherlock went faster and mouthed at John’s good shoulder when he finally came, emptying himself into the fire that joined them. A few jerks of his wrist set John off, pulsing around him and groaning out with a beautiful sound Sherlock hadn’t heard in far too long.
“Is he…” She nervously glances back to the door.
August had readily made its home in London, and while John was certainly in it for the long haul, he was having trouble mentally getting used to the fact that he was flatmates (and then some) with a creature of myth and shadows. Whenever possible, he couldn’t resist starting up an impromptu Q-and-A session to try and make heads or tails with the biology of what his flatmate actually
these things, these relationship labels or sentiment or… John. He didn’t want John, he had made that perfectly clear since day one.
John felt warm from head to toe, but he kept himself from grinning, still somewhat cautious. “So, that’s to say that the first time we were, er, together, it wasn’t too… unexpected?”
“Likewise. After you.”
One strum along the strings, the chord Sherlock’s made something slightly blue. John tries again, from the bottom this time, and feels a smile tugging at his lips when the result is actually pleasant. He’s never been much of a musician, save for a year as last chair playing clarinet, but he can see the appeal, now. “I like it. ‘S nice.”
‘Has killed before’ should be a big red flag. A tip off to Scotland Yard, and then a new address in a new city. Just as a precaution. But, then again, John was already all kinds of fucked up, so instead: “Alright. I would prefer you didn’t, but. Okay.”
Nothing. The answer was nothing. Troubled, he gave Mycroft a terse nod and went on his way. Behind him, the familiar beep of a phone, and the shift of fabric.
ME: Both the cloning and robotics programs have been equally advancing. With the top minds of the world working on the latter, you can have a body in as soon as five years. At this rate, even sooner. It'll be a rudimentary body, of course, but a vessel for you nonetheless. We need to bump you up the list so we'll be right after Mycroft.
point is that he’ll never be.
“You were an army doctor.”
“Great!” Lestrade exclaimed, clapping John on the shoulder. “Donovan will take care of Hawthorne, but I need to tie up a few loose ends. Meet you at the usual?”
Not only that, but the most important piece of information: John didn’t love Sherlock.
The small, striking intimacy in his eyes, avoiding John’s as if the things he felt was shameful. Before he could mull it over, John blurted: “Let’s start over.”
” Sherlock drawled in irritation. “I’ve been setting experiments and checking data these past couple of days. I didn’t think you’d care.”
He strides away. John nearly has to restrain Sherlock from stomping after him.
Merry Christmas :^)
“We’re the same age. That’s, quite literally, how twins work.”
“He’s not wearing a protective suit,” someone commented.
Forty-five minutes later, his phone vibrates.
it. The horror!”
“Really, Sherlock?” John hissed. “You’re drawing more attention.”
John glanced up at him sharply, but Sherlock kept his gaze straight ahead. “Won’t they find out we left?”
Stansex was the name of the village John’s grandparents had lived, as well as where his father was buried. A memory of blonde pigtails muddy from the ditches in the moors flashed through his mind, before he made a sound of recognition. “Mary! It’s been, what, nearing a decade since we last talked? How’ve you been?”
Sherlock was familiar with Stansex.
Sherlock chuckled politely, settling on the sofa beside Mary after he finished cleaning the kitchen. Without John here, the mess piled up considerably, yet
But Molly had already hurried off around the corner, gone in a moment. John watched her go thoughtfully, pursing his lips, before turning around to start his limp back down to the labs.
“Elliot, for a girl,” Mary corrected, hand cradling her belly protectively. “It sounds more modern. John doesn’t like it. He wants something older, more traditional, like Beth or Eleanor. Could you imagine?”
Such Moments are John’s favorites.
So he tilts his face up.
all of this?” John finally demands, incredulous. “You don’t have to feel guilty anymore. But you’re giving up cases, you’re babysitting— for God’s sake you’re even
John nodded, still wiping the test tube that had already dried fifteen minutes ago. “Right. Garlic?”
“What are you working on?” John asked eventually. The boy held up the ship towards John for him to see, and it was identical to the one just outside the window. John felt his eyebrows rise. “You built that?”
Yay, we finished it! I'm notorious for never finishing fics, so I'm glad I got this one done before series 4 (even though this last chapter took me nearly a month, so sorry about that one).
“Molly,” Sherlock said as a greeting, pushing through the door into the laboratory. John kept himself from studying the man too hard, as he was afraid of Sherlock discovering exactly what was spelled out across his face. Luckily, as it’s been for the past few weeks, Sherlock paid him little mind. “How’s the samples? Did he kill his brother-in-law, or did I dig through an innocent woman’s garden for nothing?”
“What the hell was
Afterwards, Sherlock tugged on his pants and kept his back to John, careful to hide his wet eyes and ruddy cheeks.
“Save it,” John interrupted. He kept his eyes closed, but his brows were furrowed. “You're still not wearing a shirt underneath your dressing gown. If I look down, I won't see shoes. I know what I saw.”
John stumbled over his feet, mouth dropping open incredulously when he processed the words. “A brilliant-
Instead of answering, John said, “I didn’t know vampires smoked.”
Sherlock pulled off and gripped around John’s erection to finish him off, licking down to his testicles and matching the pace with the hand around his own cock. John came over his abdomen with a cut off shout, hips bucking and legs flexing. When he became oversensitive, Sherlock released him and focused on himself, pressing his forehead into John’s thigh.
Despite his thrumming heart, John pretends to ponder over that for a moment. “You just called me an idiot again, didn’t you?”
“Sherlock?”
“I am, though not in the last few years. I spent some time in Afghanistan, an army doctor, and I originally trained at Bart’s. After getting shot in the shoulder, I was invalided. I decided to come back where I at least recognize the streets.”
RJ’s eyes were as wide as they could go, meeting John’s with intensity too old for a boy of just ten years. “There’s too much energy. We can’t make energy too much anymore, but there’s a ginormous bunch of energy that supplies everything. Where is it coming from?”
gay!’” He does the impression with flourish, shooting up to round around the clutter towards the front door. John almost follows him, except his limbs won’t move and he can’t even
Well, he certainly had a
ME: Well, that can’t go on. Do you believe that, given the opportunity, you’d pass the test?
“I haven’t heard you play much anymore,” he says.
“Don’t worry about it, Molly,” John says, closing the door behind them and setting the diaper bag by the table. Molly’s smile is already a bit more genuine with his daughter in her arms, if still guarded, her thin hand running through Rosie’s curls to brush them out. “We had some free time,” John continues, “And my babysitter has nearly burned his eyebrows off at Bart’s, so we thought we’d pop by while he sorts himself out.”
There was a nudge in his side. “Sorry,” said John absentmindedly.
“I’m under the impression that people do little else.” John replied lightly, sipping at his tea.
“I overheard that you’re visiting your father’s grave in Devon, for the anniversary of his death. Would you like to have company?”
Falling into the couch, he cleared his mind as well as he could. But, even on the edge of sleep, he couldn’t shake the flash of fangs and wicked red eyes.
–kerzh-
Now, the dome liked to play the whistle of nonexistent wind and the chirp of long-extinct birds. Despite himself, John scoffed beneath his breath.
That seemed to stir the man – Sherlock. Popping out the slide and scribbling something on the paper beside him, he hooked his apron over his head and threw it carelessly to the side. His movements were precise but uncalculated, as if every move he made was part of a daily routine. When he strode across the room, it was as if he glided on air.
John staggered, but recovered quickly. “Sherlock?” He asked, hair mussed and expression the epitome of concern.
She could’ve been, but that was a story for another time.
Sherlock clears his throat and puts the box back on the shelf. “They don’t have my preferred brand here,” he says as he shuffles Rosie to his other side. He peers down at her face, his deduction effortless and gentle. “I believe it’s nearly nap-time, wouldn’t you say?”
It really was a nice day, he mused. While the cool breeze and shady clouds were artificial, it was well-paced enough that it could be believed. The sports complex of Sector 2 was just like the other thirteen sports complexes on Earth; a large dome housing dozens of fields where residents could exercise without having to worry about melanoma. The sun wasn’t a life force anymore, as much as it was now a danger. But there was nothing to be done about that, so John digressed.
Pathetic,
Rosie’s sitting on the floor in front of Sherlock’s armchair, head tilted back and owlish eyes wide. The taller man is occupying said chair, guitar perched in his lap at he quietly plays, chords spattered with single finger plucks. He’s hunched over, not quite to her level but enough to meet her eyes.
“You probably were,” Sherlock said, unwinding them so he could walk around to John’s side, crowding him against the table. He reached up to swipe his thumb against John’s cheekbone, impossibly tender. “Unfortunately, whenever it comes to you I seem to be the biggest idiot in the world.”
It hurt. And then John muttered “Sherlock,” in such a small breathy voice, and the pain gave way into a much more startling hurt that pricked at the corners of his eyes. John began to move, and Sherlock lost himself.
“John, I…” Mike began, but John was already out the door, quick on his feet even with his cane. He wasn’t angry at Mike, only the fact that he’d had enough of… whatever was happening here. With as much dignity as he could muster, he found his way back to the elevator.
“I don’t think you… no, you don’t understand. What you’re saying. Seventy years ago, before my
“We’re doing some light sparring today as the first exercise,” he began, strolling towards the center where people were beginning to gather for announcements. “While we obviously do not expect there to be a need for active combat skills, the practice itself can be an viable way to keep in shape and blow off steam whenever tensions rise up there. Because they
“Yeah, yeah,” John said absently, not even having the audacity to roll his eyes. Concern flitted through his body almost as if a physical pain, putting his aching muscles to shame. He dropped his fork to his plate and pushed it aside. “Sherlock, when’s the last time you slept? Or ate? Or did anything that humans require?”
And then he felt it, the patter of steps through the floorboards at his feet. They were sluggish and heavy, but not deliberately so. He closed his eyes in defeat, a juxtaposition to the speeding race of his heart.
“So,” he began, beer in hand. It was nice to spend this time with genuinely friendly people, those who expected nothing from John so he could just lie back and soak it all in. “You’ve all stayed in Stansex, then?”
John tried to follow, calling out Sherlock’s name and pulling on his shoes with halfhearted tugs, but it was no use. When he stumbled out into the night air, roads at a lull and streetlamps flickering, it was to emptiness. If John hadn’t known this bloody man for coming on six years, he might’ve run around greater London to find him, but he knew that Sherlock was probably going to one of his boltholes to hide away for the night. John was supposed to work tomorrow; at that point, he’d sneak his way back. Proceeding to horribly avoid John for the coming weeks, almost definitely.
John felt a chill. “‘They’? As in, Sector A?”
“I’m going to use the loo too, actually,” Sherlock heard John announce, terribly transparent.
First;
Sherlock looked at him sharply. “First and foremost, we’ll need to have a sit-down soon so I can explain to you
John’s tongue peaked out between his lips as he jotted the quote down on his notebook page. Next, he searched ‘cold’.
The atmosphere swiftly thrummed back alive with rage, like thick and foul exhaust clouding the interior, and the steering wheel squeaked as Sherlock’s white hands went even whiter in fists.
Damn. Damn, damn, damn. Along with the others, John ran to the only window in the hull, located next the exit bay. Sure enough, Sherlock was jogging up to the ship, great black coat over his jumpsuit flying behind him. John quirked his lips at the unexpected appearance, but otherwise felt a sense of unease at his next discovery:
John sighs, but he’s already scooping up Rosie and stuffing his feet into his shoes in one move, just barely managing not to topple them both over. “Mrs. Hudson!” He calls, making sure he has his keys and hiking Rosie up further his side. In his other hand, he’s tapping out a reply.
ME: ...
Sherlock clears his throat. “Is it alright if we stop by the shop on our way out?”
“No matter, the smell’s strong enough.” Sherlock clapped his hands together once, rubbing them together in excitement. “How long are you giving us?”
“Could be fun,” John says offhandedly, dabbing at Rosie’s chin with a flannel. She’s old enough to handle her own spoon, a whopping 18 months, but breakfast is still a messy affair. “I know you like antiques, never knowing what trinkets and such you’ll find through the clutter. It’s a beautiful day outside. We’re getting a bit stir-crazy, too, so an outing could do us all some good.”
Sherlock frowned and slipped into his Mind Palace, to search for the origin of such a pedestrian musing. He had barely taken a few steps towards the room, where he stored all new things, until he had the time to decide, if he wanted to keep them, when he noticed it. There was a new staircase leading upstairs. Worried - nothing should be built without his knowledge - but intrigued Sherlock followed the stairs upstairs. They stopped in front of a plain door and he pushed it open carefully. It was a simple square room. The walls were the colour of sand and the curtains, of the only window, were of a light blue. There were shelves against the wall and a bed in front of the window and Sherlock frowned, as he stepped farther into the room. The shelves were filled with all kind of things, in no particular order. There were books about cooking and weaponry, side by side with books about the newest surgery techniques. Empty bottles were scattered around the framed picture, of what looked like a happy family. Sherlock couldn't make out anyone in it, but he noticed the crack that seemed to split the whole picture. Interesting.
"You’re kidding." Sherlock shook his head at John's disbelieving tone and gestured for them to move towards the exit of the park. "Not at all. He is probably going to kidnap you, in the next week, if you stay around me."
"Yes," John shrugged and their hands bumped together, as they continued to walk down the street. "But before I become desperate enough, to take money for ratting out my friends, I will shoot myself."
Sherlock rolled his eyes and let his sheet fall to the floor, before he turned towards his bedroom. At least, that got Lestrade's attention and he sputtered behind him. "You can't just... Sherlock, it's not decent to..."
"It's finished," John informed him, but kept his back turned to Sherlock. Thankfully - and angry with himself, for feeling this way - Sherlock got up from the toilet and took his pyjama pants off completely, before he could think twice about it.
Sherlock nodded. "It does, especially as I know why you smell like this. Everything went well then, I presume?" Of course it was easy to deduce, that John had been successful. He was relaxed and didn't even complain as Sherlock directed most of the warm spray in his own direction. Still, Sherlock liked to hear it in John's own words.
"You tasted of
the bored voice of his brother supplied, even as a shiver ran through Sherlock's body.
Sherlock rolled his eyes at Mycroft's suggestion. Certainly it was possible to spend endless hours at work because you loved it, but Sherlock didn't believe that was the case for John. The work at a surgery had to be extremely boring for a skilled surgeon and ex-army doctor. A case of Pneumonia was probably the most exciting that occurred.
Lots of fluff and h/c in this chapter. If you like John taking care of Sherlock, I'm sure you'll like this chapter.
“Another reason not to indulge in idleness, less one can’t finish their work, before the Lord calls them to His side.” Mrs Miller straightened her hat anew and glanced noticeably at her watch. “Oh, just look at the time, I need to hurry if I want a selection of the brightest roses. Would you be so dear and let the others know about Mrs Brown, since you’re already planning on just walking around town?”
Silence.
"Drink up. I will clean up this mess," John gestured to the vomit on the floor, "And then we need to talk."
For once, the suggestion from Mycroft was met with a nod as Sherlock hung up his coat and then went into the kitchen.
Please, read the trigger warnings before starting on this chapter! If you can think of any more warnings, that apply, please let me know.
"Obviously," was all Sherlock had the time to say before he was enfolded in the arms of his lover. "I am so glad."
"Just don't get sick all over my evidence," Anderson growled from somewhere in the room.
Sherlock's lips parted in surprised wonder, at the revelation from the most annoying part of his Mind Palace. It was true. John had acted, without thinking of the consequences for himself. No one had ever done anything like this for Sherlock. What did it mean?
He managed to climb out of the bathtub and was wrapped in a soft towel, before he had even the slightest chance to feel self-conscious. Sherlock glanced at John who was busy - or pretended to be so - with rinsing the bathtub, while he dried himself. Suddenly it was easier to speak what was on his mind, to the back of his lover than to his face. And although Sherlock hated himself a little for his own cowardice, he still used the opportunity.
"Does your interest in kissing me mean, that we are still dating?" Sherlock cursed the wine for pushing the question past his lips, when John stared blankly at him. So much for not scaring him off.
Sherlock stopped abruptly. "Friends?"
"Do you want us to be on a date?" The light of the candle danced in John's eyes, as he leaned forward on the table, to gaze openly at him.
“Heart failure, Doctor MacGill says, if you want to believe a Scot.” Mrs Miller pursed her lips and Martha refrained from pointing out that their doctor had never been to Scotland, in his whole life.
The mere idea made Sherlock shudder despite the warm water, but John still didn't seem to understand. "What will come to light?"
"Oh fuck and I gave you an opioid." His host ran an agitated hand through his hair. "You didn't look like an addict and I... Sorry, that came out wrong. I just mean..."
"Bad people," Sherlock clarified and stole another kiss from John's lips. "Besides, our first date included you shooting someone."
"Yes, we are... if you want to." John frowned. "Why wouldn't we be dating anymore? We just started."
"The Intercontinental. The victims are a Ms. Mary Valentine and her brother Michael Valentine. Sherlock are you still there?" Lestrade added when Sherlock didn't reply.
“Oh yes, they shun all other plants to get the nectar from them,” Martha agreed easily, preparing another plate with Swiss rolls.
"Fuck off!" He really needed to study memory techniques to find a way to throw Mycroft out of his Mind Palace, although his subconscious mind would probably just create someone else to reveal his deepest fears to him and be his voice of reasons. At least Mycroft was less annoying than Mummy.
Sherlock repeated John's words in his head and the blush faded from his face, when he confirmed that his lover was serious about not blaming him for his decisions. Still there was something else...
Sherlock blanched. He hadn't thought of that. Why hadn't he thought of that? And why did it come as a surprise, now, when he had - falsely - believed himself in the hands of the murderer, for some time now?
“Your bees are very fond of your rhododendrons,” Sherlock remarked casually, putting the cherry scones, that had set to cool by the oven, onto a plate.
"So, just to make this clear: You didn't sleep with me, because of some twisted rationalisation on your part and not because you found me... repulsive?" Sherlock hated how small and insecure his voice sounded but the question had to be asked. He needed to hear from John, that he still wanted him in every way.
"The one that was also a rapist?" There weren't too many serial killers lose in London, but Sherlock still wanted to make sure.
And here is their dinner date. ;)
Sherlock glanced back over his shoulder, at the confused looking Inspector and shook his head. "Do as I told you and you will see that I was right, as for who killed them," Sherlock shrugged. "I don't know and it's much too boring a case, to use my time to figure it out."
"It's a memory technique to sort and store important information," Sherlock explained and then sighed when his eyes flickered to the still body in the grass. "I could have interrogated him, if I had paid more attention."
Sherlock frowned. There was the slight possibility that it had something to do with the
"The massage oil is in the bottom drawer," Sherlock informed him with a smirk.
Sherlock opened his mouth to protest against the insults, but kept it close, when he noticed how John's shoulders sagged and he nodded in acceptance, at Lestrade's words. Great, now he had two people, that would nag him about being more careful. If they met up with Mycroft, they could have a chat over tea.
"Christ, you..." John turned around hastily and Sherlock came face to face with his lover's half-hard cock. But before he could even get a taste of it, John had grabbed him under the arms and hauled him to his feet. "Get out."
"Yes," Sherlock added a note of impatience to his voice, as he already moved to slip into his coat. "Now where to?"
"Stop it!" The words were commanding, but the hand that enclosed his wrist was gentle. Sherlock blinked down at his hand, where his own fingernails were digging in the flesh of his chest.
"I highly doubt that the
"A date consists of two people going out and having fun together," he still started carefully, to test the waters and took heart from John's encouraging smile, "I would say that the description fits us well."
"God, Sherlock. Do you always have to do that?" Lestrade pressed a hand against his chest and glared at him. "I will suffer a heart attack, one of this days."
"Sherlock?" John's worried voice made him resurface from his short trip to his Mind Palace. Blue eyes looked worriedly up at him and the words sprang to Sherlock's lips without his permission. "You killed them."
"I am hungry," Sherlock heard himself finish his former sentence. as he shifted nervously from one foot to the other. "Do you fancy Chinese. I know a good restaurant just a few streets away."
“You know,” Sherlock started slowly, “that honey made from rhododendrons is also known as
“But of course, Mrs Miller.” Martha flashed her teeth in an extremely wide smile. “It’d be my pleasure.” Maybe, it wasn’t the best choice of words, in the circumstances, but Mrs Miller only nodded with a false smile and hurried off to bother someone else.
"What is it?" John moved up his body and placed his chin in the crook of Sherlock's shoulder.
"I..." Sherlock started, only to be interrupted by the annoying voice of his brother in his Mind Palace.
“Indeed,” Mrs Miller crossed the street with a few steps and Martha was uncomfortably reminded of her own damaged hip. “It’s rare to see you out and about at such an early hour. Usually, one can’t find you outside your house until well into the afternoon.”
He shuffled over to John, who looked up at his approach and held out his hand for support, but kept his eyes on Sherlock's face the whole time. Somehow Sherlock managed to climb into the bathtub without incidents and he sighed in bliss, when the warm water enfolded his sore body.
""Wait a sec!" Lestrade stared at them both, like they had grown horns. "He," he pointed at John, "Lives here? With you?"
"One might think that you are prepared for it by now, considering that I
the siblings had played. Maybe someone had figured out what they had done to pass the time and decided to bring them to justice. Somehow, that sounded right.
"Ah now I remember," John's voice crackled, in Sherlock's ear, "I was worried, that you would get yourself killed, with this idiotic stunt."
Sherlock barely remembered to wrap the sheet around himself, before he hurried towards the living-room to greet Lestrade. "I hope the case is interesting," Sherlock called out to the DI, as he rushed into the living-room, before Lestrade could so much as call for him.
“That might be, but it doesn’t change the fact, that the old folks still dictate how the village is run,” John pointed out and then shuddered. “I still have nightmares about Mr Andrew with his pitchfork.”
Sherlock crossed his arms in front of his chest and drew the sheet tighter around his body, in the process. "That's what I just said. Do keep up. Now, back to the case..."
John waved Sherlock's words away. "I don't have much. As long as there is a bed and a wardrobe in the room, I will be fine."
So what could he deduce? He wasn't in a hospital, but he was lying in a bed, with cheap, but soft sheets. Combining that information with the dusty air in the room and the faint noises, from the street below, brought Sherlock to the conclusion, that he was in someone's flat. A flat, that was located on the third or fourth floor of a building, that was located in the outskirts of London.
"All the others were so ordinary, but Michael liked them well enough." The words, coupled with the sensation of a wet tongue on his ear, brought Sherlock back to the present and he shuddered in disgust, as she sucked on his earlobe. Everything in him screamed to push her away, but when he tried to make his arms cooperate, he only managed to weakly push against her shoulder.
"Yes, we can do that or," John worried his lower lip with his teeth, as if nervous about something. "We could go to bed and I could show you just how much I love you."
John sighed. It wasn't an angry sigh, but a slightly annoyed one. Sherlock had made sure to catalogue all of his lover's sighs in his Mind Palace, to judge his mood by them.
"Well, I certainly do," Sherlock shot back. It didn't appear important to mention, that his former sexual encounters had mostly been disappointing, since it didn't mean that Sherlock didn't want or enjoy sex. He would only never sleep with his ex-lovers again.
"It can't be this easy," John protested.
Somehow Sherlock managed to get most of the tea down his throat, although his hands were shaking like mad. It was impossible to say for sure, if it was an after effect of the drugs or if the cause was his own panic.
"It's fine." Tension ebbed from the shoulders of the man, as he sat back down in his chair. "I’m John Watson by the way."
"So you are well again?" Sherlock frowned at the question, but then recalled that John had made up a story of Sherlock having a bad case of migraine, brought on by some drugs, that someone had slipped him at a bar. It was almost frightening how easy an DI was fooled these days.
"Sorry," the apology came easier over his lips than expected, "I got lost in my Mind Palace."
One of John's eyebrows rose at that, but the look in his eyes softened at the same time. "Your Mind Palace?!"
"Are you alright, mate?" Lestrade's worried voice sounded next to him. "You look a little pale."
Yes, Sherlock mused as they continued their dinner, this was going to work. And he couldn't wait for tomorrow. He was sure that Baker Street would feel even more like home with John in it.
“Oh yes, family. What we wouldn’t do for them.” Mrs Miller nodded in understanding, as if she knew the first thing about it. “It’s admirable that you go to such lengths for them.”
His head hurt. Sherlock stifled a groan and forced himself to lie perfectly still, although his head felt like it was going to explode.
The Mycroft in his Mind Palace always had such great advice, Sherlock mused sarcastically. As if he wasn't aware, that he had to figure out where he was, before he even thought about opening his eyes. Firstly, he concentred on what his nose could tell him. There was no antiseptic smell in the air, therefore he wasn't in a hospital.
Sherlock's eyes snapped open at the voice and he jerked upright, only to regret the movement a second later. Stars exploded before his eyes and he barely managed to lean over the side of the bed, before his stomach emptied itself. He heaved, even as nothing came up anymore and tears started to form in his eyes, as a result of his splitting headache.
“Oh, that’s a shame.” Sighing John reached for a cherry scone. “Next time you make some then. If we move in across the street, we’ll even be able to help you with it.”
"Don't you dare go to the gym," Sherlock whispered against John's lips, "I like your small belly. It makes for the perfect pillow." A huff of laughter brushed against Sherlock's chin before their lips met again to engage in a passionate dance.
"Is that alright?" John asked as he sat down on Sherlock's bum with his legs to each side of Sherlock. "I am not too heavy."
"You will move in tomorrow," Sherlock announced with a bright grin and plopped a deep-fried prawn into his mouth.
"What are you looking for?" Sherlock raised an eyebrow at John and glanced at the items he had placed on the nightstand. Lube, condoms, tissues, cotton buds, patches, wound disinfectant...
“That looks wonderful, Mrs Hudson.” John helped arrange all the plates on the table, but frowned when Martha held a champagne bottle out for him to open. “That’s not exactly proper for tea,” he remarked, but dutifully poured a glass for each of them.
"Brilliant as always." John's lips twitched up. "I swore to myself that night that this would be the last one, I would kill."
They prepared their drinks in silence - a splash of milk for John and two spoonful of sugar for Sherlock - and then retreated to the couch. Sherlock frowned at how far away from him John chose to sit. Usually, at least their thighs were pressed together, but today his lover left almost enough space for a third person between them.
"Because it looked like he was going to shoot you." John's eyes narrowed at him. "What the fuck were you even doing? You didn't react to anything I said. You didn't give me your assessment of the situation or any other fucking clue, as to how to proceed. So don't take it out on me, that I made a decision, based on the information I had."
“Mrs Hudson!” With a huge smile, she waved at the couple that made his way over to her.
There was confusion mirrored in John's eyes for a second, before he proved that he was slightly smarter than average, since he appeared to get the hidden meaning, in Sherlock's words. "Sure, sounds great. Lead the way."
Carefully, Sherlock took the two steps to the toilet and sighed in relief, when  he sat down and let go of the pressure in his bladder. The sound of the water filling the bathtub drowned out any other sounds and Sherlock felt himself relax. Usually, he wasn't shy about his bodily functions, but right now he was glad that John's back was turned to him, while he peed. There was probably some psychological explanation for his feelings, but Sherlock didn't intend to look for it. There were enough other things he had to worry about. The case still wasn't solved and Lestrade didn't know about what had happened the other night. Therefore, it was likely that the DI would call around again to ask for Sherlock's help... and for details of what had happened.
Sherlock smiled tenderly and breathed a kiss to his shoulder. "Nothing, just... if you keep calling me
“Good riddance,” Sherlock muttered and Mrs Hudson hid a giggle behind her cup, when even John didn’t reprimand him for it.
Sherlock smirked, when Lestrade's smile fell and was replaced by disbelief. His eyes moved from John to Sherlock and back to John, who merely shrugged. "It's as he says."
"Then why are you dressed, instead of being in bed?"
"Sherlock, you are home." A brilliant smile broke out on John's face.
"I can't tell the police about last night." Sherlock closed his eyes in despair at the simple truth.
"Have a nice day, Sergeant," Sherlock called over his shoulder, as he entered the crime scene after Lestrade.
Relief washed over him and Sherlock nodded to all of John's requests and threw back the covers. As long as he got to clean himself, it didn't matter to him if he took a shower or a bath.
"Your phone." Sherlock stared at the object in the man's hand, but didn't try to take it from him. Certainly, this was a trick, although Sherlock wasn't sure what the man would gain from it.
"You don't get alone with him," John pointed out.
"And where is the third cup then?" Sherlock didn't have to turn around to know, that Anderson had his arms crossed in front of his chest and was smirking triumphantly at his back. The cretin really thought he had thought of something, that Sherlock hadn't.
"Stop!" John caught Sherlock's hand in his before he could do more than tuck at his pants. "If you need them to stay on, they stay on. Actually," a sheepish note entered John's voice. "I think I will leave mine own on, as well."
Sherlock considered that for a second, but dismissed it. Their man hadn't played with his victims, but he had wanted to let them know over tea why he was going to kill them. Very British, indeed. It also led to believe that the motives for the murders had been personal. An angry ex-lover perhaps? But why would he kill both brother and sister?
"I didn't know, how else to scare you out of your wonderings, on what John and I get up to in bed." Sherlock smirked. He could clearly imagine the crimson blush on Lestrade's face, while he threw on his clothes. "Now tell me about the case."
"Sherlock! Look out!" The shout echoed through Sherlock's Mind Palace, followed by a shot, that almost deafened him, as it tore him back to reality.
Sherlock hissed, when a long fingernail scratched a line over his nipple. His attempt at grabbing her hand ended with him reaching into thin air, before his arm fell heavily back onto the floor.
intended to use them. So he was probably searching for...
Sherlock wiped his suddenly sweaty hands on his trousers, while he waited for John to reply. His friend was worrying his lower lip between his teeth and frowned down at his plate. God, but he had ruined it, hadn't he? Sherlock took another swallow of his wine, as his hope shrunk with each passing second. His offer had come much too soon. He should have waited until at least their third date, before inviting John to live with him. Just because Sherlock was sure, that he wanted John in his life, didn't mean that his new friend saw it the same way. Interest in dating didn't necessarily translate to commitment. A lot of people only dated for fun, without wanting anything more serious. They certainly didn't move in together, before they hadn't tested if they were compatible in bed.
"You were covered in vomit and shit back then and needed help. It's a bit different than getting flashed like this," Lestrade cursed, as he stopped next to the door to Sherlock's bedroom.
Sherlock turned sideways, to watch as Lestrade held his hand out, for John to shake. To his surprise his lover didn't make any move to take the offered hand. Usually, John was telling Sherlock to be more polite, so why would he...
Finally, Sherlock reached for the massage oil and dribbled it on John's chest and belly, while moving further down his body. He rubbed the oil in John's skin and took extra care to massage his nipples, until they were perky and glistening. Sherlock wasn't particularly interested in having someone play with his own nipples, but John loved it, as his groans proved. And the thickening hardness in his pants was also a clear statement. Actually, Sherlock had planned on spending as much time on John's front, as his lover had spent on his back, but when he noticed the tip of John's cock peeking over the waistband of his pants he changed his mind. He kept one hand attached to John's right nipple, while he sent his other to a different destination.
Even the voice of Mycroft in his Mind Palace seemed to come from far away, but Sherlock tried to follow the advice. He managed two more steps, before the edge of the carpet became his downfall and sent him tumbling to the ground. Out of the corner of his eyes, Sherlock detected movement, as the other person in the room moved slowly over, to where he lay helplessly on the floor. Well, at least he had solved the case.
"I am also the only one who does that," Sherlock smirked as he trailed a finger down the cleft between John's cheeks, until he reached the ring of muscles at the end of it and rubbed suggestively over it.
"Move around," John gasped.
Sherlock heard the question that wasn't voiced and nodded. "You can do so as well." He blushed at how weird it was of him, to want John's hands on him, but fear his eyes roaming over that part of his body.
Sherlock couldn't help the exasperated sigh, that fell from his lips, as Lestrade gestured between them, like the idiot he was, instead of just saying what he meant. "We just had sex last night, if that answers your question." Sherlock ignored both the embarrassed glare from John and the fierce blush in the DI's cheeks. "Can we talk about the case now?"
"I love you, too." The words were so easily spoken, that Sherlock wondered why he hadn't used them sooner. It was the simplest and most beautiful truth: He loved John Watson.
Sherlock sighed as he hit the button for the second floor. Sometimes, it was enjoyable to bicker with Donovan but today she was merely annoying. Not only because her remarks were far off the mark, but also because it felt like she was blaming him for what had happened, although she didn't know the first thing about it. John was right, he should really take money for helping the police with their work, if they decided to verbally abuse him every chance they got. Maybe then his lover would also decide to work less.
"Boring," Sherlock sighed, but Lestrade's next words prevented him from ending the call. "They have been shot with the same gun as the guys that were killed by our serial killer."
Tea splashed over the rim of the cup and onto the saucer, when Martha sat the cup down with more force than planned. “They are old, they won’t live forever,” she offered as calmly as possible.
"But I know how you hold your body when you grin. So what is it?" Sherlock turned back around and closed his arms around John as he pressed their foreheads together. "I was just thinking of our first corporate murder."
For a second Sherlock wondered how John's mind worked, that he had arrived at this conclusion, but he decided to solve this mystery another time. "Why shouldn't I want to kiss you?"
He flinched when the man reached a hand towards him, but it was only to gently touch his forehead. "You don't appear to have a fever, but I am worried about your illusions. I didn't think, that your concussion was that bad, but..."
"John," Sherlock called out, when his lover turned to leave. He couldn't make much sense of all the mixed emotions, that were whirling through his mind, but he was sure of one thing: He didn't want John to leave. "Please stay." Sherlock patted the other side of the bed. "Just for a bit." Sherlock held his breath as John stared worriedly at the empty space of the bed and only released it, when his lover nodded.
“Ball!” Rosie cries in delight.
Molly nodded quickly, unbothered by the turn of events. Her eyes kept flickering over his shoulder. “Of course, that’s fine. Tell him I said hi!”
Inside of his mind, he could see John with perfect clarity, silver at the edges and a harshness to his brow that was both incongruous and so terribly, terribly
But to use his
“John,” Sherlock muttered helplessly, and then whatever string between them snapped and John was yanking Sherlock down, teeth knocking as their lips slotted together, slick and hot, hot, hotter than Sherlock would have thought possible. He let out an embarrassing sound, and his arms reached down to wind as tight as they would go around John’s waist. Air wasn’t important anymore, not if it meant parting from John’s lips.
“God!” John repeated, unable to help it. “That was, what, nearly three days ago? How are you even still on your feet?”
Sherlock was pulling at his curls, trying to pace but instead managing to stumble around uncoordinatedly, nearly tripping over his own feet. “Five years,” he said into nothing, hands insistent at his head, “Five years of this. Of the watching, of the wanting, of the letting you come home drunk and… and then not be bothered. Do you see now, John?”
Sherlock hums, and shifts impossibly closer. “It’s simple,” he says, almost like an admission. “I still prefer the violin whenever it comes to composing, but this is new. Akin to ambient noise, clearing my mind more than prompting it to think. It’s… different.”
John nodded, once, watching the distance close in with wide eyes.
But, quick as a blink, as soon as his mouth opened all good humor vanished from his expression. It was as if he had inhaled a toxin, breath halted in his throat and eyes wide. John, doctor before anything else, took an alarmed step forward. It was as if the man was frozen, eyes locked onto nothing in particular near John’s face.
That was more than enough.
“Dinner, then rent a movie?” He offered.
They crash together. Despite his skin, Sherlock’s lips are warm, and he presses John’s face to his like they’re going to merge into one, and John wouldn’t be satisfied with anything less. Sherlock kicks the chair between them over to where it topples into the living room and clambers off the desk to press John into the window, hands still locked around his face. The cold at his back and the warmth at his front are in stark contrast with each other, and when John’s fingers go beneath Sherlock’s ratty tee to knead into the muscles of his back, a low groan escapes from Sherlock’s throat. John swallows it down like he’s suffocating and it’s a gallon of oxygen.
was the one stiffening in his seat, his eyes narrowing dangerously. “Are you done?” If there’s one thing that John Watson wasn’t, it was a damsel in distress. “I’ve known you for three months, Sherlock,
Sherlock cleared his throat, uncommonly awkward. John found it endearing. “No… boyfriends, then?”
“Has Sherlock ever told you about Benjamin?” Mycroft finally asks.
Sherlock’s lips tilted and his neck rolled skyward, as if he was saying
ed. “Hard so say.”
Sherlock shook his head, wet curls limp against his forehead. John always thought that he applied product to make his finished hair so perfect, but it seemed to dry that way naturally. “Not yet. How long are we staying?”
Sherlock blinked once. And again, and again, and again. Soon his eyelashes were fluttering, a tell-tale sign that he was flustered. “C-clarify. Please.”
“I’ve said my share for the night,” he said as he pulled into the road, voice carefully nonchalant. “Now it’s your turn.”
The smile grew. “Wonderful. Whenever possible, please schedule John Watson to assist me during my reserved times.”
“Would you like to engage in that tradition?” He closes his eyes, the barest falter of emotion before opening them back up and closing off his face once more. “With me?”
A relevant URL appeared, and he dove right in.
John’s eyes this close were cobalt blue and hazy from his inebriation, unfocused on Sherlock’s eyes but suddenly and obviously enrapt when they dropped to his mouth. Sherlock could feel the other man’s heat against his skin and he felt his heart throb which much more force than usual.
“Sh’lock! I’m home!” John yelled from the doorway, even though Sherlock was currently in his armchair typing from John’s laptop. He glanced up, and in one sweep he was able to deduce that not only was John
They had almost circled back to the gang, back at the stone rubble. Mary cleared her throat delicately. “Well, the end is more ridiculous than the story.” When John thumbed at her hand, welcoming, she rolled her eyes with a smile. “Well, this part is a bit more vague, but it’s what I heard. A treaty was made after this happened amongst Dartmoor, to protect them against the return of the cold one, the beast named Sherlock Holmes. Witchcraft was involved, if you can believe the credibility. It’s sort of ominous, but basically:
With horror, Sherlock realized that they were drunk. He was taking advantage of John’s state for his own irrelevant wants. As if burnt, Sherlock pushed away all at once.
Sherlock shifted the car into park and met John’s eyes, the picture of innocence. “Because we’re here instead.” At John’s unamused stare, he continued, wary. “You haven’t eaten since we were in Stansex, and I have on good authority that human beings require food to survive. Hence, dinner.”
John clenched his left fist, though not out of anger, and felt the slight tremor it held. He definitely couldn’t go back to his doctoring ways, not in this state. “That’s… actually perfect, Mike. I’d love to be back in Bart’s, even if it’s just cleaning beakers and yelling at students for snogging in the corners.” Oh, how the tables have turned. Mike smiled.
John narrowed his eyes. “Ye-es?”
“Later,” John promises.
He breathed, bewildered. How much whiplash could he take today?
“Just…” John huffed out a breath, pushing himself off the armchair. Something in his knees clicked as he stood. “I can’t just… I’d have to get my affairs in order, to start.”
But it was all worth it when he made it to Bart’s.
Sector 2 was dedicated to Biomedical Research. Whoever the representative was, they would (in simple terms) be able to find out if humanity could survive and retain fertility in a new, virus-free environment. As John climbed up into the ring, all he could think about was just how smart this representative must be, if he continues disobedient behavior and yet is
Lestrade’s grin was blinding against his tanned skin. “Cheers, then! Let’s go see another one.”
John mentally chides himself for bringing him up, but it was bound to happen eventually. “No, no. He’s back at ho- well, that is. At Baker street.”
At first, only the corner of Sherlock’s mouth twitches, like one of his barely-there lopsided smiles. He ducks his head to his feet, as if he’s going to deduce himself from the scuffs on his own shoes. John’s about to continue. But then Sherlock looks back up, and for the barest,
Sherlock’s playing louder, more confidently, and he’s really in his element, John thinks. Not the center of attention, though the bloody git wouldn’t mind that either, but playing the music right now, he’s responsible for the joy of the people he cares about most. His eyes are closed, and his fingers play the most complicated of melodies as if by heart and not from an 80’s pop song, turning it into something beautiful and organic and so utterly
“So we just… leave him out there?” John asked incredulously.
“Hmm?”
would it be?”
Sherlock scowled. He could just go home himself, he hardly needed John with him at all times. But he
His sister’s voice came out in broken waves.
Eventually, though, it was between public sex or asphyxiating. John pulled away with a huff, something unlike anything Sherlock has seen before in his expression. Sherlock could feel both of their heartbeats in every inch of his body.
“Three cases closed in the past week,” he commented, rubbing his hands together in the chill evening air. There were bags underneath his eyes, but he seemed more awake now than in the past few days. “I would have thought that the Baskerville case you told me about would have tired you both out.”
ME: No, no. Well, of course, as a pregnancy hasn’t naturally been conceived in nearly a year, but nothing currently.
John thought, and nodded carefully. “Alright. Erm. Let’s say… that there’s this tall bloke named Scott, and a shorter one named Hamish.”
