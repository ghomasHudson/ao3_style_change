"I'll tell him." Dean said, almost in a whisper, Cas just wrapped his arms around Dean's shoulders and held him closer.
"have you found anything I had asked you to look for? What does that mean? Oh? Why? You don't have to shout. That's quite interesting, I have seen it happen, but I assumed all humans do the same. Okay, and what am I supposed to do with that information? Don't use it? Well I wasn't planning on it considering what you just said. I can't tell you whether to tell or what to tell Sam, I don't even know if Dean knows, and its about him. trying to see if he already knows would also work, yes. Yes, i will try to be less blunt about it, and Jack, you'll talk to him after Sam? Thank you, Charlie, and please explain to Gabriel how you explained to me." Cas ended the call.
"I knew it was later January, was never allowed to celebrate it since I was four, so I just... Forgot. It wasn't important to anyone so I forgot." Dean let out, voice wavering.
"I had gotten them for you for your birthday on the 24th, but I couldn't give them to you unconcise." Cas told him, it stung but he was the one who tried to kill himself on his birthday, so he couldn't really argue.
Cas started unwrapping the bloodied bandages, "I don't know how much you know about your medical history before you were dragged across the country to hunt, but Charlie wanted to know if you had a family history of depression, you do, but that is not what Charlie needed to talk to me about, Dean, do you know what autism is?" Dean nodded, Lisa had talked to him about it after finding out Ben was autistic, he just thought Ben had picked up more of his traits than Lisa's. "So are you aware you were diagnosed with it before your mother died?" That made Dean pause, he didn't, though Lisa had told him how similar him and Ben were, he didn't think it had anything to do with him, thinking back, Lisa was probably trying to ask him not just tell him about it. Dean slowly shook his head, he couldn't seem to meet Cas's eyes.
“I know buddy, but your bed doesn’t have any sheets on it yet.” Castiel walked up behind his son and kissed him on the head. Aiden slumped his shoulders. The last thing Castiel wanted to do was upset the kids. Speaking of kids…Claire was unusually quiet.
By the time Castiel had calmed down it was almost an hour after he’d been taken back to his room. Most of his rage focused on his pillows at this point. The notebook that held the heroic story of redemption that he’d been writing now littered the floor in scraps.
“You are going to get past this dark time in your life, I’m honored to be the one to assist you on your journey. We can work through this one step, one day, one hour at a time.” The doc left his card on the table next to the bed and walked out of the room leaving Castiel with nothing but silence and his own thoughts.
When they arrived Dean was still floating on a cloud. Too lost in Cas to pay attention exactly where they were going until Castiel pulled away from him. They were in a bedroom filled with candles and pies.
“Oh come on Charlie, Gabes all jokes and sugar.” Sam was the first to respond while Gabriel seemed to find his fingernails increasingly interesting. “If he really wanted me he would’ve said something by now, you’ve got one couple don’t push your luck.”
Dean was surprised he hadn’t even needed to say anything to the receptionist before he was being sent into an office he’d only ever been in once to sign his initial contract years ago.
“Look man, I’ve already found a place and started moving some stuff. I’ll explain it to him when he wakes up. He’ll understand.” Dean deflated, there was no anger behind his statement, more like resigned acceptance.
“It doesn’t matter, the only omega I want could never want me back.” Castiel dropped his head to the bar, muffling his words.
Dean jumped as he was pulled back to reality. “Aww come on Cas, don't be like that. If I left you, who would keep you company?” Flashing his million-dollar smile. “I mean don’t get me wrong, it's not like I wouldn’t rather be elbow deep in an engine right now but I know how stressed you’ve been about this paper. I figured I could come to lighten your mood.” Dean dropped his magazine on the table and switched sides taking the chair right next to Castiel
“Look, Papa!! I’m a snowman!!!” Claire held out her hands and Castiel realized only then that Claire was not wearing her clothes, they were piled on the bed. Adding that to the plus column, he thanked his lucky stars that this house had nothing but hardwood floors. Castiel picked up Claire and headed for the bathroom. He didn’t want to take time for baths tonight, but now he had no choice.
Castiel amended his last statement on his own. Pam gave a slight nod and smile as she made a note in the open journal on her desk.
“That is not for us to watch. We just need to all be happy that those two idiots are finally together. Good work gentlemen.” Charlie smacked Gabes feet off the desk and settled down on her laptop, they were going to be here for a while.
Next thing he knew his alarm was going off, where those hours had gone, he couldn’t tell you. Claire was being unusually affectionate this morning. It was Friday so maybe she was happy that it wouldn’t be a school night meaning they get to stay up 2 extra hours tonight…but that was more typically Aidans thing, he hated having to stop in the middle of his Lego construction projects.
Jess sat back down in her chair and looked to Sam for the answer. “Well, actually beside us…” “And Missouri” Jess chimed in. “yes and Missouri you’re the only person to know. We wanted to tell you because Jess let me in on the secret plans for the nursery that you’ve helped her put together and we only felt it was fair.” Sam gave the two conspirators a glare but there was no heat behind it.
Dean read over the whole contract again just to make sure that there was nothing new added, having a brother for a lawyer made him extra wary when it came to signing things.
“Now that we’ve got that out of your system.” Pam pulled the gloves off of his hands and handed him a bottle of water. “Let's move on to the next step.” Castiel sat down on the mats in front of the window and started stretching. Bringing his heart rate under control Castiel grabbed a resistance band and stretched out his legs. “I do trust Dean to look after our children. I trust that he believes he was doing what was best for us. I don’t trust him when it comes to me.”
“Mom, did you and Dad really bet on Dean and I ending up in a relationship?” At this point, Castiel was in shock.
Back in the room, Castiel had already begun to gather his items. He’d heard enough to know that Dean was putting him out. There's no need to fight to get better if he has no reason. The kids were the light in his life, they would soon be gone. At least this way he could save Dean a little on the medical bills.
Cas curled in his bed, the other side was too often empty and cold for him to not feel as though a part of him was missing and now something might seriously be wrong with him. He needed to talk but Dean was clearly too busy for him. He decided on the only other person he knew wouldn’t mind a late night conversation, but calling this late would be rude.
“who says they have to bite on the neck Moose?” Gabriel loved when he could make his boyfriend blush. Sam was so sweet and still innocent in some ways.
Cas tried his best to school his expressions but he had been undoubtedly startled by what he’d reluctantly had to accept was is only and best friend. Somehow Dean came over to visit one day and just never seemed to leave
Dean sat on his small cot in a rented room only a few miles away from his intended target with what felt like the weight of the world on his shoulders. He knew his aversion to real discussions and prolonged absences were going to cause problems, but he never thought for a second that Castiel would up and move the kids away without discussing it with him. In all fairness, it’s not like he was available to talk recently.
The more wholesome mornings he would wake up with either one or both of the children in bed with them. Whether the reason was nightmares or just middle of the night wandering. Having two mini furnaces curled into them, feeling the bed full but not overcrowded. His whole family right within his grasp. That was the best memory that he would relive from time to time.  Moments he wished he could stay in, instead of waking up to reality. A reality where his husband…or ex-husband depending on how you looked at it, was in a psych ward. A nicer one but still basically a nice room with padded walls.
“Now Castiel sweetie I brought you some broth to sip on. Eat as much as you can and when you’re ready, you’ve got a few people that want to say hello.” Missouri brushed her fingers through Castiels' matted hair after helping him sit up in the bed. “Yes ma’am.” Cas smiled at how easily this woman warmed his heart and at the same time, seems to terrify his ‘fearless’ husband.
Dean plopped down in a chair somewhere in the room, the mumbled prayers let him know that Dean was somewhere to his right.
Sams professional persona slipped back into place while he wrote down which tests he need to draw blood for. “Just Cas can you at least promise me you’ll consider talking to Dean about this? Just give him a chance. I know he’s stressed out about work, but he’d never want you to have to go through something like this alone.” Sam nodded and gripped Cas hand before he stood up to walk out of the room. He was understandably tense, he hated keeping things from his brother, especially something that had the potential to be life changing.
"Hush Sam, if they do she'll be the cutest girl ever. Deans green eyes, with Cas' dark hair. I can see it now." Jess put a hand on Cas shoulders.
“Homework first!!!” Cas couldn’t help but chuckle at the collective groans he heard come from the computer room. They both trudged back to the dining room backpacks in tow. It’s not like they had difficult work. Aidan had simple addition that took him at most 4 minutes to complete. Claire mostly had color by numbers, today's sheet was a duck on a sailboat in the ocean.
Castiel stood back observing both boys and laughed to himself. There was no better sight than the look of pure joy on Deans face or the happiness and excitement radiating through his scent, if only he were the cause of it all, then the world would be perfect.
“Don’t worry about it Dean, just Mr trickster and the queen up to some shenanigans I put a stop to it though.” Sam shrugged with his back still to his brother, not sure how much he should say.
“Cas, look man, I don’t know what happened between you two. I wasn’t there that night but what I will tell you is this is the opening you need. Its time you tell Dean everything. Tell him how you feel, lay it all out for him and let him make the choice. If he likes you too then great! All of this pining can end, if he doesn’t want you then you know I have a room at my place with your name on it until you find a new apartment.”
“Umm no this is not like him at all, he’s never had this type of outburst before.” Dean jumped off of the couch and was throwing on his jacket. “I will be there in 10 minutes.”
“What makes you say that Cassie? Are they still grilling you about life plans? Or did they not answer your call?” Gabriel couldn’t turn around to face his brother as he stared down the peanut butter fluff cream he was mixing on the stove.
Stepping into the tent where Cas was sitting he saw Chuck giving last words of wisdom, suggestions of directions to take and maybe who wouldn’t be a bad choice.
Dean couldn’t help but chuckle Gabe had sent 6 suckers for the twins a month ago. They both still had one each. Of course, Lenox would remember that it was still sitting on top of the refrigerator in the candy bowl.
From that night on, Aiden tried to care for Claire. He would fill her cup with juice, so she didn’t have to wait for uncle Sam to be done reading whatever was on his desk. He helped her get on her shoes and be ready to leave in the morning. Aiden hated and loved the new responsibility. He loved the fact that he was doing what he had promised daddy and papa that he would always do. He hated that he couldn’t just be left alone. Aiden still loved his solitude, but now it was him playing with Claire after school, it was him that she would annoy with the stories of what happened in class and what the latest drama was with her barbies.
“Woah, guys how about Aidan you help me make the batter for apple pie waffles? And Claire you’re going to be in charge of helping me make my cinnamon whip cream? Let's leave dad to relax for a little bit longer okay?”
“Do you want me to stick around? I’ve got a little time before I really have to leave.” Dean grabbed a piece of toast and went to get dressed. Normally he’d have bacon and waffles but today he just wasn’t feeling up to it.
“Alrighty good answer, your turn Dean-o.” Dean had barely glanced up while Cas told his story. He remembered that day. He’d pestered the babysitter so much about the moving truck and who was in it that she’d sent him outside to play with Sam in the yard.
Sorry I've been gone for a while. I have moved across the country, graduated college and now I'm on to the next stage of life. I will try to keep up with regular updates until the story has come to completion. I do hope you guys are still with me. I appreciate those that are still along for the ride.
“By now? I’m pretty sure he knows everything. He overheard me and Cas talking about his weekend trip to see the specialist and had a meltdown at work thinking Cas was cheating…….”
“You know what how about you grab your sleeping bag and put that on the bed for tonight? I have to go find your sister, she’s being too quiet.”
Cas and Dean were cuddled up on the couch, settled in for their Saturday movie night. “Comfy baby?” Dean pulled his husband even tighter against him. Ever since he came so close to losing the man, he stopped denying his love of cuddling. Anytime Cas wanted to cuddle Dean was right there with a blanket ready for him.
“Of course not, but we haven’t had the sweets from the new bakery that opened up down the street so I wanted to give you options. Don’t worry I’ll make sure nothing goes to waste.” Dean was snacking on his second tartlet at this point absent-mindedly flipping through a magazine that Jess had left in the room earlier that week. “Oh, I almost forgot” Dean reached into his jacket pocket and pulled out a ziplock bag that held two pb&j cookies. Contraband. “Jess told me to make sure you get these. I'm guessing they're a bribe.” Cas loved the smile on his husbands face, almost childlike.
“Yea, apparently they decided to wait. What they’re waiting for, I’m not exactly sure but at least they aren’t just sitting around pining for each other anymore. If I had to deal with that anymore I was going to scream.” If anybody asked Sam would only say that he was sort of paying attention to the baking competition Gabriel had on the screen, but he was being sucked in. “Wait, I thought if you wanted to build something you had to use like gum paste, why is that chick using fondant?” Gabriel just chuckled. “I knew it would pull you in sooner or later Samsquatch.”
“I…..” Dean couldn’t make I contact. “I’ve been offered to extend for another 6 months” Deans closed his eyes and just waited for the fury to be unleashed on him.
“Sam ran some tests and made some calls to an old college buddy of his because he wasn’t going to tell me anything unless he was 100% sure what the results meant. One of my kidneys is starting to fail. We thought maybe we could wait for the specialist to come here since we seemed to catch it early but my legs and feet have started to swell so it was decided that I need to get to him for treatment as soon as possible. Meaning this weekend.” Cas said the words and couldn’t bear to look Dean in the eyes, he knew there would be tears and he couldn’t handle that. “I still hadn’t said anything because it just felt like it had been a secret for too long, Dean I….I’m sorry.” The tears hit the table below Cas betraying his unwavering voice.
“Dean, I’m trying to say. I’m trying to ask.” Castiel got up from his seat and moved to kneel in front of Deans now pulled out chair. Resting his hands on Deans thighs Castiel looked up with the most love and adoration filled eyes.
Castiel went back to the house she had chosen, admittedly it was his favorite out of the available options, and it was coming available just as the lease on their current home would be ending.
“Cas, babe calm down. I called them out of school today. I also called your boss and got you the day off. Who -by the way- was shocked to even learn I exist….why is that? Anyway, I wanted to spend the day with my family, so I made it happen.” Dean went on eating his breakfast like this was perfectly acceptable.
to go home. All I see is how these are not the people I love. These are shells with a few facts and fabricated personalities. I’m going home.” Castiel marched toward the front door of the beach house.
“That is your highness to you, my good handmaiden. I am discussing logistics and strategy, you can wait for your queen inside.” Charlie waves her hand at the door chuckling as Dean bows and continues on his way. Sam just rolls his eyes. Charlie grabbed Sams arm before he walked reached the door. “Come with me, Sam.”
“Hello, Dean….yes I am fine….I just have an idiot for a brother…..yes Gabe is back in town….I will tell him…goodbye Dean.”
“I’m not sure that I would make a good addition to the group. I have been told that I am awkward and my tendency to stare can be quite off-putting.” Castiel put his notepad away and tilted his head in confusion at her inflamed cheeks. “Also, you would be the only one on the trip that I would know, and I wouldn’t want to monopolize your time. I do appreciate the offer; however I must decline.” Daphne’s shoulders slumped as she mumbled a quick goodbye and hustled to get away from the area. In her haste, she ran straight into Charlie almost knocking the laptop out of her hands.
“Last week? So then you know what it is?! Is he dying Char? Oh God that’s it, he’s dying and I was too busy with the shop to even notice, what kind of terrible husband am I Charlie? How did I not notice that he needed me??” Deans questions came out like a rapid-fire slowly losing intensity as his voice cracked and gave way to raw emotion and tears.
“Really, you’ve been talking to Charlie about me? Like you don’t have enough going on in your own life” Sam rolled his eyes but continued. “Yea Dean we’ve been talking about you, only because we’re concerned. You’re working like it’s the source of your oxygen and with everything, Cas is going through we worry.” Sam leaned back against the counter and just waited.
Sam and Jess weighed the desire to do anything to keep Cas alive with the potential of risking Jess and the safety of future children. Charlie would be risking her independence and freedom. She had been on her own for years and being a post-transplant donor put too many eyes on her. She’d be tracked and monitored meaning she couldn’t pick up and take off like she tended to do from time to time. Even Cain weighed the options, but his advanced age added an additional danger factor, it was possible he wouldn’t wake up due to complications with the anesthesia.
“Kids go upstairs and play, I’ll come up in a little bit.” Dean shuffled the kids up the stairs. He knew it would be better to talk to Cas sooner rather than later. Mainly because he would have to leave before any of them woke in the morning. Any fall out needed to be started so that they could be at peace with each other before he left for a long time again.
“Dude, there's a camel in the backyard.” Dean was looking through the curtains in his room. Sam took a peak “That’s an alpaca dumbass.”
The only thing Castiel had to look forward to these days were the walks he would take with Missouri, she was the only one who didn’t treat him like a dying man. She talked to him like he was any other person.
Dean got up, hopped in the shower and got ready to start his day. As he walked out to the kitchen, he could hear Cas on the phone clearly talking low enough he didn’t intend to be heard.
“We’re all going to get them through this together. We are a family, and we are there support system. We can be there for them in more ways than donating body parts.” Sam helped Jess pin-up her hair as she slid in the tub.
Gabriel stuck his hands in his pockets and shrugged “figured I should be here for when you set the rugrats free from their prison.” He used the sucker to point at Castiels round stomach. “With all this good influence, somebody has to be around to teach them how to cause a little mischief”
“I don’t what Cas? Don’t get me wrong this whole day has been amazing, but I mean it's your graduation we should be doing things for you and I kind of feel selfish for taking you away from your family. We should be doing things you like and I mean….yea” Dean couldn’t quite find the words either. The waitress picked that moment to deliver their steaks. Both men welcomed the meaty aromatic distraction. Dean had though those steaks looked good on tv, it was nothing compared to having one sitting right in front of you.
“Hello?” Sams' voice was little more than a grunt. Dean looked at his watch, it was like 2 am where Sam lived. He hadn’t thought this through he just needed answers
A slight smile appeared on the doctors face as he went to take a few more notes in his small notebook.
“Yes, we did.” Castiel sat on Dean's lap. “I could tell you all about the farmers market where I had a gluten-free seafood crepe, or about the museum that I found but I know those don’t particularly interest you.” Castiel ran his fingers through Deans' hair. “What I want to know is how many times did you have to listen to
the woods, technically I was…under them.” Cas began to chuckle at the childishly simple plan that had worked for so many years. The plan that he had no way to thank his best friend for making happen for him. The plan that helped him realize the alpha he’d wanted all this time was right in front of him.
“You’re not useless Jess, just because you can’t be the one to donate for Cas doesn’t mean you can’t be useful. You always have been a good friend to Cas, he loves your cookies and loves it when you dote on him. He needs that smothering love just as much now if not more.” Sam wrapped his arms around his wife and walked her to their bathroom, and prepared a bubble bath for her to relax.
Castiel finally woke up to a silent room. The only sounds being made by the machines monitoring everything about him. When he finally opened his eyes, he found himself looking towards the window, his first thought that it was still dark outside
Dinner back at the inn was very lowkey, they enjoyed homemade pot roast and creamy, cheesy potatoes. Of course, Dean had pie for dessert while Sam and Castiel both decided to sample some gelato.
“I’m perfectly satisfied with my gelato Dean. Although with as much as you seem to be enjoying it I might have to try it later this week.” Castiels tone may have been even, but his eyes never left Deans lips. The perfect pink cupids bow lips were glistening after he slowly licked them. He fantasized about leaning over the table and just kissing Dean. Scooping Dean up in a bridal carry and taking him back to the room and making Dean moan like he is with every bite of pie.
“Think about it, you didn’t know her beyond the fact that she was your nurse, she could have been some crazy woman who kidnaps patients. Why trust her?”
“Now that’s handled….” Charlie leaned closer, her expression edging toward downright terrifying. “What are your intentions with Sam. If you value your life, take this question seriously.”
“Sit down and shut up boy. Castiel, your husband was admitted here last night after an attempted suicide. Your brother was the one who found him when he brought the kids home earlier than planned.”
Cas glared at his older brother instantly regretting his choice of refuge for the night. Although it was infinitely better than being witness to whomever Dean chose to bring home this time. So many times before had Castiel been the one to bid farewell to Dean’s numerous one night stands. Jealousy was not an adequate word to encompass Castiels’ feelings. He had been in love with Dean for years, why else would he live with someone who wasn't his same secondary gender? He’d always had the options of the segregated dorms but the thought of being away from Dean was just too much for him to even contemplate.
Dean decided to try and let Charlie's words mean something; Instead of freaking out over what he couldn’t control. He went for something he could control; he deep cleaned every common area in the apartment with the greatest hits of Led Zeppelin blasting at ear bursting levels. He was vacuuming the living room and lip syncing to Ramble On, it wasn’t until the second chorus that the knocking on the door finally made it through the music.
“No Dean you don’t get it, he’s an omega, which means his parents are making him do an omega run!!! They’re going to mate him off to some creepy old man that thinks its fine to chase down boys!! We’ve got to help him, he’s too young to be claimed.” Sam broke out those puppy dog eyes one more time.
“Is there any way I can convince you to eat that somewhere else?” Cas had stopped typing at some point while Dean was deep in thought staring off into nothing. “I can barely hear myself think with all of the noise you’re making. You do realize theres a no food allowed sign on the door right?”
“Sam I appreciate you and Dean inviting me along on this trip, however, I do believe that it is time for me to go. My behavior last night was unacceptable and I will not stay anywhere that I am causing others to be uncomfortable. Especially when I am an invited guest.” Castiel was packing his duffle and checking greyhound schedules.
Castiel raised his eyebrow in question tilting his head in the process. “I’m not exactly sure what you’re trying to say, Dean.” Castiel wasn’t exactly well-known at the school, he kept to himself did his work and generally did his best to blend into the background and go unnoticed. “I don’t know who you think I’ll tell.”
Sam stood there looking at how much thought Castiel had put into making this trip amazing for them, not for them
“Somebody tell me again how these two idiots could be so oblivious? They have to be actively ignoring it. Look at Cassie’s face. It’s even too sweet for me.” Gabriel gestured at the camera.
“Hannah, Castiel is a stereotypical alpha in that he prefers omegas.” Dean left it at that. Hopefully, that was enough to help her decide on her own to move on.
“I know Jess, you’re right, you’re right. I just worry I’ve seen things like this go wrong so many times and I don’t know what I would do if I lost you.” Sam slumped against the wall outside of his patients' room. “I have to go see my patient but please just at least let me know if you’re a match before you go signing away pieces of yourself?” Whatever answer she gave made Sam chuckle as he tucked his cell phone into his pocket.
Castiel sat hovering over his mug, steeling himself for the conversation. If he was lucky they wouldn’t answer and he could just leave a voicemail. It wasn’t like they didn’t know Dean. He knew that Dean just wasn’t the kind of omega they had in mind for him. They wanted him to have a small, quiet, and properly raised female omega that would give him the picture-perfect family. Practically the exact OPPOSITE of Dean.
Dean felt like an idiot but he held up his part of the deal, Charlie was paid overtime and he was getting his costume together for a weekend spent being her handmaiden.
When they got back to the house Sam didn’t even go inside. He walked them to the door and promised to come over this weekend to make smores and roast hotdogs.
“Yes, the day I let my parents know I’ve finally got the omega of my dreams and I’m ready to settle down.”
Steeling himself for what would be the longest night of his life, Dean secured his weapons and thought over the plan. He slowly slipped into his cold and distant calculating self.
Dean couldn’t stay at work, he had to go home. “Charlie I need to go home, I’m sure you guys can handle the shop for a few hours without me. Have one of the guys take over my appointments for while I’m gone?” Dean stood up and put his jacket back on, clearly, he had been neglecting the most important part of his life and needed to make a change immediately.
“Look, Gabe is usually pretty cool about keeping our secret if it got out that any of us did…this.” Dean gestured back to the karaoke bar. “Look, man, we’ve all got an image to uphold, ya know?”
“Dean is this loaded baked potato soup?” Cas yelled out from the kitchen. Sam cringed knowing that there was no way that his deep voice didn’t make it all the way to Lisa. He looked at his brother and nodded his head in the direction of the kitchen. Sam then pointed at himself and Gabe, then the bedroom door, then the front door.
“Daddy isn’t that great at bath time, he got water in Claire's eyes and that made her scream. So I asked to come downstairs before them.“ Castiel couldn’t help but chuckle at their oldest, he was always very frank in opinion and never hid his thoughts.
“Gabriel, did you know mom and dad had a bet going about me and Dean?” Castiel had his trademark head tilt.
“After Sam noticed he wasn’t looking too hot and figured out it wasn’t a cold, Cas swore us to secrecy. He said you were already so stressed out running the shop, that he couldn’t add to that. He did promise to tell you once there was a definite diagnosis, which happened last week.” Charlie tried to focus on anything except the glare Dean was giving her. Feeling like a small child under the scrutiny of a disapproving parent.
“So Dean donated $40 towards our night. Meaning he knows he’s in trouble when I talk to him. So are you finally going to tell me where you’re taking me?” Sam glanced over at Gabriel hoping to get a hint. Gabriel had an uncontrollable sweet tooth, so he hoped wherever they went there were some healthy options to go along with whatever dessert Gabriel was going to get.
Never having been there himself he expected the worst. He expected to drive up to a building that reminded him of a penitentiary, barbed-wire fences, metal detectors, and armed guards included. Sam double-checked his GPS when he pulled up to what could have been confused for a plant nursery next to a hotel. The sign by the door reassured him that he was in the right place. After signing in and being escorted to the common room Sam got his first glimpse of the brother in law he had not seen in a considerable amount of time.
“Dean Winchester I told you that pudding ought to be gone. Now you sit down here and eat.” The nurse walked back in with a tray of soup broth for Castiel to attempt. Next to the bowl of soup was a sandwich and chips, no doubt more food she planned to force on Dean.
SO many things had been said. What was supposed to be a therapeutic session, an initial breeching of the issues that brought Cas to his current position turned into an emotional vomit session. After a couple of questions, Castiel just wouldn’t stop talking. Talking about how he was hurt, talking about how he was sad, talking about how he was angry, talking about his desperation.
“He’d never want anybody like me Red, he’s going places, he’s going to be some corporate CEO one day. You know he needs some perfect, proper, delicate, beautiful omega.” The self-loathing came across as a scent all to itself. Somehow breaking through the strong scent blocker he used daily out of habit.
Dinner was ready, Cas had a couple beers on the table waiting, and he changed into those jeans that Dean always said hugged his hips just right.
“You know I kept trying to think of where you would take me so I could figure out what would be my healthy options, this…I wasn’t expecting.” Sam gestured at the front of the building as Gabriel held the door open for him. Something unusual which put Sam off balance, as an alpha he’s used to being the one in charge and being the one to do all the grand gestures. Gabriel was different than any other beta, that’s the only reason he finally gave him a chance.
It was almost time for Dean to leave since he had to be back at work early the next morning but Cas decided that he wanted Dean to stay. “I know you’ll probably be gone by the time I wake up but I want to fall asleep with you next to me.” Dean couldn’t say no to his angel. They cut the lights off and snuggled close in the small bed.  “I love you Dean, please forgive me” Cas whispered knowing his husband was already asleep.
“So now that we’ve fixed those two, am I going to have to issue a royal decree as the queen for you two?” In her short amount of time with Gabriel and Sam, it was obvious that there were some mutual feelings. Gabriel had true emotion behind all those crass innuendos and jokes. Sam always seemed to watch Gabe when he wasn’t looking, with a pining look in his eye.
The green papered box with the drawings was handed to him, he made a noise somewhere between a greatful sigh and an upsetting cry, written on it was "Happy BDay Dean, From Jack (and Gabriel)" he made sure not to rip the paper, opening the box inside, there were snacks, mostly fruity candy but it also had some chocolate, Gabriel had rcently gotten Jack on the candy train, and Jack always wanted to give a piece to Dean, figuring out what he did and didn't like, Dean's face had a small smile tugging at the corner of his mouth.
With the snap of his fingers the glass was put back together and Cas threw a towel over it just to cover it up, eventually Dean started to calm down, Cas got up from his seat against the other side of the wall where Dean sat and went to him, his eyes were closed, and he was trying to catch the last bit of breath he'd lost, his forehead covered in sweat, making him wince occasionally when some got into the scratches on the side of his face, his hands still shook, fingers turned a shade of purple, hands bearing raw and bloody bite marks.
He didn't know when he fell on the floor, but he was certain he was on it now, everything felt like it was in slow motion, he was on the ground, he caught the sight of his hands which refused his command to stop shaking, slowly dripping with someone else's blood, he didn't notice the door opening, but flinched the moment a pair of hands touched his shoulders, he saw John there, shaking him, or maybe he was just shaking, his eyes scrunch as if waiting for a punch that had yet to come, he tried to back up to the wall behind him.
"I think its time you went to bed for now, you can sleep or we can just sit there, but its time to get off the floor, tomorrow we can make pie and you can bathe." Cas told him, getting him up off the floor, grabbing the box from Charlie and Eileen and helping Dean onto the bed, the plate from breakfast ended up in the sink and cas replaced it with the fidget toys.
Castiel pulled his cell out of his bag, the annoying Lollipop ringtone. “Yes, Gabriel….no I just left the desk…are you sure this has to happen now? Alright, I will be waiting by my car.” Castiel hung up the phone and walked the rest of the way to his car.
Cas tried to get up and head for the bathroom, but Dean only held on tighter snuggling into his shoulder.
“Can’t be meeting the family, cause you’ve grown up with Cas so you know the family. What about mating?” Deans scent spiked and he has never been more excited to see a bacon cheeseburger and Charlie's chili cheese fries in his life.
The taste of the pb&j in Cas mouth soured, it's amazing how guilt can turn something delicious into sand. Cas chewed slowly trying to decide his words carefully, he wasn’t ready to talk about it and he knew that wasn’t fair to Dean.
He walked over and kissed Dean on the forehead to wake him up. Dean startled and sat up quickly. “Hey, babe you're home already?!? What time is it?” Castiel started to answer when he noticed Dean squinting at him oddly. He idly thought,
“Knock, Knock” Cain walked into the door, in his scrubs which was an unusual sight. “Are you sure that you want to go through with this?”  Cain held his file in his hands. “Yes, I’ve made up my mind, this is the best option even if it's not
So used to being left alone for the majority of the day the ringing of his cell phone startled him, but he knew that ringtone.
The man was droning on and on about something but Castiel was too lost in his own thoughts to really catch most of it. Something about being allowed to grow his own garden was mentioned in there if it was really worth it maybe Castiel will listen next time. It was somewhere about five minutes into the ordeal before the doc realized that Castiels eyes had glazed over.
dead. That’s his older brother, who seems to be a bit….” Charlie searched for the right word..”Mental.” Dean wanted to be mad at Charlie for the hacking, the invasion of privacy and going behind his back to do it all, but he had already planned to ask her to do it anyway.
“Alright Sammy, I hear you, alright? How is Cas doing? You said he sounded bad?” Dean leaned against the wall. There was a man in the next room he needed to have a
“Would you two please sit patiently? I understand we’re not normally in the car for this long and you’re getting antsy. Just keep your hands to yourself.” Trying so hard to keep the edge out of his voice Cas attempted to keep the peace. It wasn’t their fault that there was standstill traffic and he hadn’t slept well during the few hours that he did get.
Every time he thought about the fact that they were actually together, he could feel those bubbly giggly feelings wash over him as if it were the first time. The only part that seemed to snag his happy omega heart was the fact that he and Cas hadn’t mated. The words of promise were there, and he could smell the adoration and desire in Castiels scent, so what was missing that made Castiel want to wait?
“Shhh…its gonna be alright sweetheart, I will work  on getting you discharged into my care and keep the two idiots away for now, but you will have to face him at some point.”
Dean seems nervous, but Sam can see his excitement rising. Dean’s slowly grinning now. He pulls Sam in for a rib crushing hug and Sam obliges. This is the happiest he's ever seen his brother considering what they've been through.
It wasn't supposed to go like this, Sam just wanted to distract Dean for a little while, but in a drastic turn of events, he almost lost his brother, for real this time.
“He’s fine. Listen. I know you told me to not come with you but I don’t care. I’m coming with. Can’t let you get yourself into trouble again.”
Astonished, Cas looks up at the hunter. The human for whom he sacrificed everything; all of it, because he made him question everything he had known about heaven.
Dean confesses. They've had a long, tiring day. Going to family therapy for a case, turned out to be just what they needed. Sam lets out his breath in a long drawn out sigh. He knew there wasn’t anything that he could possibly say to make it better. Dean is grieving. He has lost too much; as has Sam but he understands that he has always had his big brother to take care of even the littlest things. Dean remembers losing their mother much more vividly than Sam; not just because he was too young to remember, but because Dean always made sure his baby brother, his Sammy, never had to relive that horrifying truth until he was old enough to understand it. Now it’s Sam’s turn to take care of Dean, just like he did, all his life. He'll keep the faith for both of them, he won't back down.
How can he forget looking in its eyes, seeing his worst fears, with the most terrible part of him staring back at him? Everything the Empty told him was true, or it had seemed true at that moment, and Cas was on the verge of giving up. But somewhere along the way he realized that he’s not worthless.
Jack was his responsibility and he had made a promise to Kelly that he would protect her son no matter what and teach him everything he can about embracing his human side. Now Jack’s gone and Cas doesn’t know what to do. Right now, he’s helpless and he can only hope the Angels haven’t gotten a hold of him, or worse, Asmodeus’ demons. He can tell Jack’s a good kid from the little time he’s spent with him. After all it was Jack who woke him up in the Empty.
“Are you sure? Because from what I remember, the last time it got you killed. And I can’t let that happen again!”
Dean hits the brakes and pulls over to the side of the road. This is not the conversation to have when he's driving.
But he also felt the pain, the guilt, the feeling of hopelessness, his inadequacy and his failures. It still haunts him to this day and he doesn’t know how to make it stop.
He becomes lost in thought again. In fact, he’s so distracted that he doesn’t hear the footsteps coming towards his direction. He looks to his right and watches as Dean rushes to him, frantically waving at him to stop the car. Cas stops the ignition and gets out, all confused and worried.
Dean feels a flash of irritation followed by a moment of grief. He remembers what it was like with Cas gone.
, who is furious now while trying so hard to hold back his tears. Dean feels a little ashamed. He did make the decision in haste, not caring whether he lived or died. He has given up. But he can't do that to Sam.
Dean pauses for a moment, collecting himself. “You’re more important to me than you think, Cas. Can’t you see that?”
It happens again. And again. Dean can’t sleep much nowadays but whenever he does, he usually wakes up screaming.
“I believe you Sammy. I do. But I’m just so tired of losing everyone I love. I couldn’t save mom. God knows where she is or if she's even alive."
This time, Sam waits for Dean to respond. Several seconds pass, but Dean doesn’t say anything. Sam’s done putting their coats in the closet; he shuts the cupboard, walks up to him and puts a hand on his shoulder. He gives it a gentle squeeze, like an assurance of some kind. Dean's looking anywhere but at Sam.
He will never forget the day he woke up in the Empty. It was pitch black, nothing to see and nowhere to go. How poetic, Cas thought. After everything he’s done, he probably deserves it. An eternity of solitude and unrest, nothing but his memories to accompany him. And then just when he thought he was all alone, he found someone. It called itself “the Empty” but it looked just like his vessel.
Dean's wide awake, breathing heavily, soaked in sweat. He's quiet now but even then, Dean pays no attention to Sam. Instead he's fixated on his bedroom door, like he’s waiting for someone. Sam takes a seat at the edge of the bed, and feels how unusually cold Dean’s body is. He wraps a blanket around his brother and holds him until he stops shaking.
“Why do you care so much Dean? What if you get killed while you’re trying to protect me? What will I tell Sam? I can’t live with that guilt for the rest of eternity. I can’t take that chance. So if I die, I die. I deserve it. I’ve just made everything worse for you. I don’t want Sam to lose his brother because he’s trying to save me.”
“You don’t understand the consequences it can have if I tell you. It can be catastrophic! I can’t risk it, Dean!” Cas raises his voice.
Sam shifts in his place till he’s facing Dean, who's still leaning against his Baby. He takes another gulp of his cold beer, looking surprised, almost embarrassed. Sam patiently waits for an answer.
It’s extraordinary the things you can accomplish once you put your mind to it. At the time, Cas had little hope that his plan to escape the Empty would work. He never thought he had it in him. He took a gamble and now he’s out of that dark place, the void, leaving behind the worst parts of himself in the Empty. All his time on Earth, and the Winchesters, taught him to fight for what you want and when the time came, Cas knew what he had to do.
“I need you to keep the faith, for both of us. ‘Cause right now, I… Right now, I don’t believe in a damn thing.”
But how can he say that to Sam? Billie told them to keep working, keep fighting. But they never stopped, and he won't ever stop. He can’t abandon his brother and leave him all alone. That's not what family is for.
Dean gets out of bed immediately after to wash his face. He knows he won’t be able to sleep now. He's focused on his reflection in the mirror and there it is. A flash of familiar blue eyes. He's not afraid though.
“I… I don’t know what to tell you. I don’t understand anything. All I know is that when I lost you, I thought it was final and I tried to bring you back, I tried! I prayed to Chuck, I begged him to bring you back, to bring mom back, but nothing happened! There were days when I just didn’t want to live anymore. I didn’t know what to do!”
Cas takes a step back. He doesn’t know how to stop Dean. Again, nothing works. Dean can be so stubborn.
“I don’t know how to make you understand, Dean. It’s not just about that. I can’t stay here. I want to, I do, but I can’t. You don’t understand, you never will. And I can’t blame you for it. It’s better if I go. Let me go, please.”
“Of course I’m not okay. We just lost Cas and we don't know anything about mom and I don’t know what to do.”
“Dean, I will never judge you for feeling how you feel, you know that right? I’m your brother and I love you. I’ve looked up to you most of my life and I will do anything for you. But I’ve also seen you around Cas. I know you, Dean. You and him? That’s something special. And I think he knows it too.”
Sam has snapped. Dean can tell it's not gonna be pretty. Still focused on the road, he answers almost mechanically.
He doesn’t know how to fix it. Nothing seems to work in his favour and he’s starting to feel like he shouldn’t be anywhere near Sam and Dean for their own well-being. He’s never told them about this, but he feels like if he does, they’ll agree with him. He is broken, and he knows it. But he doesn’t know how to get rid of this feeling.
In that moment Cas is reminded again that he is an immortal being and he’ll never grow old, but Dean is not. He will age, and he will one day, leave him. He puts a hand on the hunter’s shoulder and asks him with concern, “Dean, what’s wrong? Is Sam okay?”
Dean can’t believe Cas just said that. He looks at his angel with resolve. He’s determined to stop him and he will. He’s not going to leave Cas on his own again. He’s always had trouble talking about his feelings, no chick flick moments, but not today. Cas just came back from the dead, again. Dean can’t lose him now. Not today, not tomorrow, not
He knows he should start the car and start moving but there’s something eating him up inside. He wishes he still had his wings and could just zap himself anywhere but it’s his fault that the angels fell, so he no doubt deserves it. It was a trap, and he fell for it like a fool. Just like he thought he could help by letting Lucifer in. Dean tells him that it wasn’t his fault; that he was only trying to help but Cas still feels guilty for everything. He wishes he could be of help, and not just a screw-up. Whenever he tries to do the right thing, he fails, and that burden, that failure is absolutely crushing him every moment of his existence because he’s hurting everyone around him.
But before he can reply, they’re interrupted. Dean’s phone is ringing. He takes this perfect opportunity to avoid the question he doesn’t know the answer to. If he tells Sam that he’s never thought about it,
Dean takes a hesitant step towards Cas. It’s been a few seconds since he stopped talking but Cas hasn’t said anything. Dean can feel the tension building. He’s looking expectantly at Cas because he’s confident it will work in his favour.
Dean looks away and takes a step towards the driver’s seat to open the door, and looks back at him and speaks with a new conviction in his voice.
Castiel plopped on the couch cell phone in hand. Nerves causing his hand to shake he dialed the number and prayed no one would answer.
“I’m real proud of you man.” Sam looked up from his bowl of fat-free frozen yogurt. “You put a lot of the kids' worries at ease, well Aiden anyway. “ Sam previously hadn’t mentioned much about what he had discussed with Aiden when Dean was not around. That was an uncle-nephew bond and he was not going to intrude.  “He was scared that when you got a job it would take you away like your last one. Honestly, he wasn’t the only one worried.” Sam let the moment hang knowing Dean was not one for big emotional moments.
Castiel started out with a few gentle punches letting the question roll around in his mind, why did he trust her? Why didn’t he trust anyone else, he could have, most people would have called someone else, but Cas went home with a virtual stranger instead of his husband or his brother-in-law.
“He’s stabilized, sir. It was touch and go for a second because Castiel was fighting the breathing tube.”
“You guys don’t know what you’re missing.” Dean used his fork to point at Sam and Cas unintentionally flicking some filling across the table.
Castiel went through the next week as normal as possible. Every day he and the kids put together a different room, making sure it really felt like a home for them. The bedrooms and kitchen were the top priority as those were the most used rooms for their family. Keeping in with their traditions, the kids were allowed to redecorate their rooms. Instead of a video game theme, Aiden opted for Minecraft. Claire decided quite seriously “I’m a big girl now Papa” So instead of unicorns she opted to have her room simply covered in rainbows. Castiel rolled his eyes and made sure they both had the rooms just the way they wanted it.
Finally, back in America, he’d tracked his family down ready to crawl on his knees and beg forgiveness for whatever misunderstanding occurred. He’d spend the rest of his life making up for the pain he’d caused Cas and the kids.
They had to hate him for what he’d done. Claire wouldn’t understand, but Aiden would. He would hate him for trying to leave, for being so selfish. Luckily Claire is young enough that she could completely forget about him, it was for the best.
“Lucky the elf, what’s your favorite color?” Cas only sighed, he hoped his brother screened his calls and didn’t answer business calls the same way.
“Yea Can I speak to Dr. Winchester? Yes, I’ll hold.” Charlie ambled back to her desk and started on her task of rearranging Deans schedule for the next week. Now that he knew, there was no way he’d leave Cas side, or let him take that trip alone. He may be self-degrading, and at times closed off, but when he loved he loved hard and with full dedication. He was meant to be a caretaker. Under all that tough exterior, he was just a big softie.
Castiel hadn’t looked up before now, too stuck in his own little world with his thoughts and his burger with extra bacon. What broke him out of his solitude was the realization that the once rambunctious crowd had all but disappeared and the only sound he’d actually heard was Dean walking in the door.
“You rest sugar, I’ll be back to take you home later.” Ellen kissed Castiel on the forehead and laid his bed back before turning out the lights and closing his door on her way out.
“So tell me about this conversation between you and Charlie.” Cas tried to keep the mood light, maybe she hadn’t given up the secret and it was something else. Deans shoulders noticeably slumped as he sat the sandwich and a glass of strawberry milk in front of Cas.
“So Charlie, it is Charlie, right? You seem way too…high tech for a place like this, so how did they rope you in?” He sat on the edge of the desk and offered her some strawberry licorice while his eyes seemed to be scanning the papers on her desk looking for something.  “Well, I don’t think that much your business.” Charlie barely looked up from her computer screen, if this was him trying to flirt, he was seriously wasting his time.
“No, I’m just going to watch Babygirl.” Castiel turned her around so she was facing the screen. Aiden shifted his position, so he was pressed into his Papas’ side. Castiel sat with the kids and let the morning replay through his mind over and over. The whole time Aiden was explaining each part of the video game they were playing in vivid detail. It was irrelevant that Cas could see it all for himself, Aiden felt the need to educate his Papa. Castiel was more than willing to be able to silently nod while his mind tried to figure out what to do if his marriage truly was over.
“Castiel you have the chance at happiness here, no more pain, no more loneliness, no death.” The woman with long brown hair, tan skin, and brown eyes spoke to him as he walked past her.
“That is correct, my husband already has my heart, I feel like it would be wrong to give it to someone else.” What should have been a very sweet sentiment hung heavy in the room.
Dean knew he was only using her to fill an empty spot in his life, but he didn’t care. He couldn’t have the one person he desired above others so she would do, not to mention she was extra enthusiastic as she had been chasing after Dean for a while now. Whether she was the wolf Dean wanted or not was irrelevant, she was there to scratch the itch that he couldn’t continue to ignore.
“Yea I’m good red, so tell me beyond mooching food what brings you by today?” Dean stood up and headed back to the kitchen, there was too much on his mind to be idle. Thank goodness he still had cookies to put together but instead of peanut butter and jelly, he opted to mix up a fresh batch of white chocolate chip, one of own personal favorites.
“Yup everything is all set ready for you to woo your crazy omega right into bed.” Gabriel wiggled his eyebrows at Castiel just to make him laugh. “Relax bro, the hard part is done now you get to have the fun part. I’ll take care of mom and dad. We’ll see you tomorrow hopefully sporting a fresh bite.” Gabriel took the robe and headed off towards the crowds of people.
That night was another campout. The boxes had all been placed in their respective rooms and the furniture set up accordingly, but Castiel just did not have the energy to unpack anything before the morning came.
With the kitchen complete he decided to attempt sleeping. Bundled up in his sleeping bag Castiel stared at the ceiling, completely zoned out from reality.
Castiel laughed. “Yea we can go get donuts then we can head home.” Castiel started to put away his book, and the beach towel spread out in front of his chair.
“Hey Boss, sleep in or get you some morning lovin from that handsome hubby of yours?” Charlie’s eyebrows danced suggestively as she looked up from her computer.
“Winchester. Come in have a seat. Tell me, what was so important that we couldn’t have this meeting in the field? Preferably at a bar?” Deans boss was an older unassuming man with grey hair and a matching beard, but there was something about him that terrified Dean.
Cas hesitantly rose to his feet to approach her. After the basic check on all his vitals the nurse led him to small room with a few chairs, a bed and a computer. “Alright darlin’, just have a seat here and the doctor will be here in a few minutes.” She slipped the clipboard in the slot on the door and closed it on her way out.
"That's great and all Sammy, but our first date was at the roadhouse, I barely paid him any attention and I'm pretty sure that's the monthly karaoke night this month." Dean was all but defeated, there was no way he could make this first anniversary special enough to show Cas how lucky he really felt to have his love.
His children still a mystery to him. The oldest Aiden, once his shadow was wary of getting close to him. Dean completely understood, being the oldest himself he understood that drive to protect and guide the younger ones. Claire barely showed any signs that the issues of the family had affected her. Some of her artwork had changed, instead of Papa Cas there was daddy Dean and uncle Sam.  Her stories of “this week at home” involved less baking and more time outdoors.
“I’ve had it! I’m done playing second to your job!” Castiel tossed Deans duffle bag out of the room. “I understand your current contract is binding, but I also know when it ends.” The whole time Castiel is speaking in a hushed furious whisper, the last thing he wanted to do was upset the children.
“Always” Cas attempted a smile but his body was weak. Looking into his husbands' eyes he could see so much pain, desperation, and love.
“yea I am Sam, thanks. Look I know I started yelling before you could even get a word out but, you know how it is. If Cas can talk to anyone it should be me ya know?” There was so much more that Dean wanted to say but he was already so drained. He’d pushed himself out of his comfort zone for Cas he wasn’t doing that with Sam too
Cas summoned every bit of strength in his body and forced his eyes open just a bit. “Dean?” He barely managed to make a sound over the beeping of the many monitors.
“Do I really Sam? It was you that noticed I hadn’t been eating, it was you that noticed I was always tired and you only see me on the weekends at Sunday dinner. So I think its clear at this point where his priorities are right now.” The anger and frustration was boiling to the surface as Cas took a deep breath to keep himself in control.
The couple in question sat down still so lost in each other they hadn’t acknowledged anyone else at the table.
“Hey!!” Someone was running after them. Before he even bothered to turn around Castiel started mumbling something about leaving a decent tip, only to be silenced when he realizes that it is Dean Winchester calling after him, jogging out the door to catch him.
Not one to pass up such a rare opportunity, Castiel pulled out his phone and began to record the performance. Not exactly sure what he planned to do with the video, but he just had to have it.
Cas spent that entire afternoon and early evening dancing around the kitchen to his own music mix. He took special care making sure the burgers were perfectly seasoned, and the fries were at the right point of crisp. He had spent the most time creating artwork in the top crust of the pie, carving shapes of bumblebees and flowers in the crust. He had it perfectly timed out that Dean would be getting home just as the burgers finished cooking and the pie would be ready shortly after.
Dean was lighting a few candles after closing the windows when Cas walked out of his room. Dean practically tripped over himself trying to walk closer.
“What to deal with? What's that supposed to mean? Dean may not be the best at discussing his feelings but damnit at least I know he’s trying.” Castiel stretched his arms across his chest trying to bring relief to the tense muscles.  “Okay…instead of focusing on that lets talk about you. What have you been up to since our last meeting?” Pam began their normal yoga circuit, Castiel following as is their normal routine.
“Sam, its all my fault, I shouldn’t have left him. Maybe if I hadn’t…..Sam what am I going to do I can’t lose him, I owe him so much.” The words barely had sound. Dean’s world was crashing down around him. It was only at this moment he truly realized how much he had taken Cas for granted. He assumed Cas would always be there, and he could leave things unsaid because there would always be time for that later.
“Cas, this is amazing. You are amazing.” Dean locked eyes to ensure that Castiel truly believed and trusted his words. “I love you Castiel now make an honest omega out of me and feed me pie.” Dean pulled Castiel towards the bed slowly stripping him of every piece of clothing.
Cas looked anywhere but at his husband, his guilt for not sharing his condition earlier was only getting worse, but this was not the time or place for that discussion.
“Hey Cas ready for some dinner? By the time we’re done eating, the crumble will be perfectly warm for you.” Dean tried so hard but he could swear he sounded like a 5th grader talking to a girl for the first time.
“That is a good thing. He’s breathing on his own now. He’s a fighter. The more autonomous behavior, the more he is waking up. Small steps. But this is good news.” Sam couldn’t hold back he wrapped his arms around the nurse and just cried.
“Guys you know we don’t have time for this, you both need to be at school by…” Castiel glanced down at his phone he’d shoved in his pocket. “Crap 10 minutes ago. Both of you run upstairs and get dressed, your clothes are already sitting out like they normally are, we don’t have time for arguing just go.” Claire and Aidan looked at each other and headed for their rooms.
“Wait, we all have our own rooms? Cas you gotta let us pay you back for this, had to cost you a pretty penny.”
After two weeks went by, it was obvious that Bobby was not coming back to the business and was essentially giving it to Dean. Dean shouldered all of the responsibility trying to do it all on his own and while the business not only survived but gained success, his marriage was suffering. It was becoming clear to everyone at their Sunday dinners the Cas had taken all he could, and Dean was oblivious because he was either working or sleeping.
“It's NOT A CAR SEAT!!!! CAR SEATS ARE FOR BABIES!!!! I HAVE A BOOSTER SEAT CAUSE IM A BIG BOY. YOU’D KNOW THAT IF YOU WERE HERE. PAPA KNOWS THAT!!! WHY ISNT PAPA HERE?!? I WANT PAPA BACK!!!!
illegal?” Sam stepped in front of the two masterminds of this plan, which as far as he could tell wasn’t going any better than their other half-baked ideas.
“Let’s play a game of ‘I Spy’ while we wait, Claire birds do not count.” If she pointed out one more bird he was going to snap.
The mystery was driving Gabriel insane, but Naomi was loving it. Before Castiel was just some young omega from a small town with no real draw for the alphas, now powerful alphas from all over the country came for a chance at mating him during a run.
Jess held the phone out to him again. “It’s Cas, he’s awake and asking for you, Sam already told him you needed to rest so this was our compromise.” Jess grabbed his hand and thrust the phone into it forcing him into action.
Sam walked in on the tail end of a conversation Cas was having on his cellphone. Bounding in like a happy puppy he carried in a bowl of fruit and some yogurt for his favorite brother-in-law. “Morning Cas. How’s it going today? I’ve got some time before I have to start my rounds so I figured I could spend it with you.” Sam sat down in the chair next to the bed and started sipping his own coffee after putting the things for Cas on his tray.
Dean set up the old hideout spraying the walls down in scent blocker and building a covering for the entrance that he douses in the blockers. He douses himself too. He’s proud, first of Sammy for wanting to do this for a friend, second of himself no one will ever find this hideout.
“Well honey I’m doctor Barnes and I believe that with a new plan we can help you work through some of those repressed emotions teach you to proper ways to focus and deal with them in the future.” Castiel wasn’t sure what she had planned but the fact that they were allowing him to stay after what happened, he wasn’t going to question much.
Pam guided Castiel into a dew yoga poses. “Good, now do you think the trust came as quickly as it did because you feared what Sam or Dean might say?” Castiel let the thought roll around his mind while they continued to stretch. Looking out the window was not as satisfying as it was winter and not as many plants were in bloom but Castiel let the view distract him from the few negative thoughts trying to take over his mind.
“Well, Dean I see not much has changed, when you do something you go big whether its good or bad. I will tell you this, what’s happened is not unfixable. Do you want to try to fix it?” Missouri started packing up her spices back in the bag she brought with her and put a lid on the pot.
“Oh, did you really think I didn’t know? It’s my job to know everything about everyone. That’s how I’ve grown to be so successful Dean. The world survives on secrets. ” Ramiel punched a code into the pad on the wall and the glass door swung open. He sauntered in and slowly circled Dean still bound in the chair. “ My most favorite of secrets of yours, however, is that delicious husband of yours.” Dean tensed up in his chair. Not Cas, he couldn’t let his family suffer for his poor decisions. “Now, be a good boy and sign here on the dotted line. I’ve already got an assignment waiting for you.”
When they got in the car Sam insisted on driving, he needed to be distracted from all the tension in the car, and he had to make sure they ended up in the right place. He had his own secret, they weren’t going for a tour of Chocolate World, he’d gotten them tickets to make their own chocolate bars. His own way of saying thank you to Castiel for their awesome rooms.
“Yea, umm I have a paper I need to get done and turn in so I gotta get going.” Dean reached out and comfortingly rubbed her shoulder. He knew how it felt to accept that your crush wouldn’t want you back.
“Umm.. not really anything is up Charlie.” Dean bumped shoulders. “I just hadn’t seen you in a little bit, I know I’ve been caught up with my own stuff I figured we could get together and catch up.” Dean had already ordered for the both of them and was glancing around praying for the waiter to come with his burger. If he had food in his mouth then he wouldn’t be able to answer the questions that were no doubt bouncing around in her head.
Dean stood in the bathroom for a moment, taking his clothes off, in front of a mirror starting with his shirt, he looked disgustedly at what laid underneath, his sight wasn't as blurry as when he put pajamas on, and he could actually get a good look at himself now, and it didn't look great, he was thinner, ribs jutting out more, the gunshot to his chest was trying to heal, matched with healing cuts which lined his arms and upper arms along with scars, he had to start with unwrapping his wrists, long jagged angry lines running up and down his forearms and more going the opposite directions, a few burns and bite marks to compliment.
It continued three weeks in to being on the road and staying at motels and John hunting when John drunkenly hit him for the first time, he had tried to stop it once when he was five and again when he was thirteen and tried to really fight back.
"The man hit me almost every time I was around him for a long enough period of time, he buried me alive more times than I'd care to remember, he's even shot me on occasion, he used me as bait for whatever monster was hungry, he's left me to raise Sammy alone and left me to find ways to make money to pay for Sammy's food and school alone since I was little, he took away my chances of being a kid because I was the one who raised Sammy and taught the kid right from wrong, I've been the monster in his eyes since I can remember, what's there to make me think even being near him would be in any way safe?" Dean admitted, he was crying now, and he couldn't seem to bring himself to care.
He looked at his pants next, all the slices that the fuzzy pajama pants hide, he wore longer underwear ever since he was younger because it was less likely to get infected if it had something at least covering it in between his ripped skin and his usual jeans.
It started for Dean when he was four years old, the nursery fire that killed his mom, he had walked out and seen his mother burning there on the ceiling before having his baby brother shoved into his arms and John screaming at him to get outside.
"Can you tell me why you thought I was going to hit you? Why you looked at me and saw John Winchester and thought at the very sight of him you were in immediate danger?" Cas asked yet another question.
Cas knew he couldn't make all Dean's depression and PTSD go away, but he was content in just getting through day after day with him.
So once things started to settle down more and Sammy found people he was happy with, John came back into his dreams, he couldn't disagree this time.
but eventually he was too tired to mess with any of them, falling asleep with Cas in his arms, Cas still didn't sleep but he enjoyed listening to Dean's heart and breathing while he slept, which was much better and more comfortable than standing in the corner and watching him sleep.
Dean didn't say anything, he knew idealizing John in Sam's eyes was crushing him, if Sam had done half the shit he had to he would have shot John so long ago just to keep him safe, he was a hypopcrite and he knew it, but that was his kid, Sam was his kid and he just wanted to keep him away from everything that could hurt him, even if he hurt himself in the process, but Sam wouldn't even know him if he died and didn't get to tell him, he just wished that Sam could know him wihtout all the disgusting shit he's had to do.
Cas had tried to snap him out of it, it wasn't working, so Cas just sat with him on the floor and made sure he didn't hurt himself further, talking to him about anything that might help him calm down, the TV long sice turned off.
Dean had told him, being unable to speak was difficult but this way he didn't have to use his energy just to communicate.
Cas stayed there for long over an hour, but decided he needed to get Dean some food and some actual water or juice instead of alcohol, and change the bandages on his face. Dean made an undescribable noise when Cas sat back up, it was similar to how a child might whine if you took away their favorite stuffed animal.
The way she shows me I'm hers, and she is mine, open hand or closed fist would be fine, the blood is rare and sweet as cherry wine
"I'm going to talk to you about something while I bandage your head again." Cas had finally told him by the last bite, Dean nodded, still feeling like his vocal chords had betrayed him and left him alone with Cas.
"Would you like me to stay here on top of you for a while?" Cas was met with a nod in the crook of his neck, "I'll stay for a while, but you have to let me change your bandages in return."
"What happened this morning?" Cas tried to ask him, Dean was at a loss for words, knowing exactly what happened and why it happened but unable to convey what or why.
Mark Dean down as scared and horny because as possessive and hot as that was, it scared him. Cas scared him. Letting himself be under someone else's control scared him. He craved to be taken care of by the man in front of him and he was scared of what that meant, what that would mean if Cas ever got tired of him. He had wrecked and put that car back together, including all her imperfections, and imagining that he could be that to someone else, to an angel, made him feel like the most loved but insignifigant thing in the world.
Cas handed him the other box, "you've aged :p from Charlie and Eileen (and Sam but not really, he said you didn't like celebrating your birthday but we threw in what he got you too)" this one didn't have anything special on it so ripping it wasn't a concern, at the top there was another thing wrapped in newspaper and he knew it was a silent gift from Sammy, he looked at what Charlie and Eileen gave him before opening the one from his little brother, Sam knew he hated his birthday but occasionally silently gave him something, always wrapped in newspaper, the box wrapped in green paper contained small toys, fidget toys, he recalled, Charlie really liked them and Sam had had a fidget spinner at one point, but the sound bothered Dean to no end, he messed around with a few of them before remembering Sam's gift.
Hiding his baby brother in the bathroom or under a bed, a closet even, anything to not let his little brother see him like that, Dean was raising him alone, Dean gave Sam anything he needed when he needed it, stealing food when John had forgotten to give him food money, but when he got caught he told Sammy and anyone else who asked he'd lost it in a poker game, telling only his father they didn't have grocery money because he wasn't given any, he also lied about the bruises on his arms, as long as it kept him and Sammy together, so he could protect him.
Everything seemed fine, until a man had hit a child on whatever show seemed the least boring, Dean was happy with whatever chick flick came on as long as it wasn't 'Dr Sexy MD' which got ruined when he had to be in it and got shot, but the child getting hit by their dad had immediately sent Dean back to his own father hitting him, the differnce was the father was hit for hitting the child in the show, but no such help would ever stop John, he recalled a day when John had hit him to the ground after he had dug himself out of a grave "too soon" after being burried alive, which the thought of made everything worse, he could feel the dirt in his mouth, covering his lungs when he tried gasping for air, it was so heay every time it happened he didn't think he could get out.
Cas helped Dean sit up again and Cas sat back down on Dean's legs, he put the bandages on the nightstand for after Dean was finished eating, Cas trying to help him eat but Dean trying to refuse because he was embarassed to have to be fed by someone else, but because he hadn't had anything but alcohol in weeks his hands wouldn't stop shaking enough to hold anything but the juice pouch.
"I'm in Georgia with Gabriel and Eileen, just about to go search for some bones, so I don't think I've got anything to do with it, I don't know where Dean is though, he's either hunting or at the bunker." Sam told him.
"I thought you would have known, you told me while you were drunk once that John called you 're*arded' frequently, and Charlie said it was a derogatory term that was used in the previous century to describe autism before they called it that." Cas told him, finishing up wrapping his face back up. "Would you like me to lay on top of you again after you get confortable?" That answer Dean is sure of and he nods his head.
Dean woke up to the smell of Cas, who smelled like dirt, which Dean wasn't too fond of after having a few too many mouthfuls of before, the woods after a storm, which smelled good, and a warmth that was hard to describe. Dean started a gentle hum, Cas noticing it wasn't his usual style of music, but it was nice.
Cas started the water and put the plug in the drain, feeling it to make sure it was an alright temperature for his human, he hoisted his body up, holding him under his knees and back, snapping to get the last of his clothes off before setting him gently in the still filing up bathtub, Cas ditched the tie and everything over his shirt, rolling the sleeves up while the water rose, shutting the water off to not let it get too high.
Dean took the plate, thanking Cas and eating the eggs, Sam always messed up eggs but he was just procrastinating getting to the fake meat, Sam was a vegetarian, which was fine by Dean, but he couldn't stand the way fake meat felt when he tried to eat it.
The two stayed up for a while longer, Dean looking through the box, a note shoved at the bottom that said "STIM TOYS" and said hosw some of them worked, the rectangle with squares folded into a cube and folded back out, and two tangles one with textures and one regular one, and some biting ones that he had made the comment "I'm not a dog,' which he was reluctant to try at first but Cas had wanted him to give all of them a chance so he did, he actually liked the chewy ones, still feeling the need to say he wasn't a dog, there was also some stress balls, some of them had some sort of liquid or slime in them and some had beads, he liked the fidget cube, the chewlery, and the puzzle ball where you have to put the right color in the right hole ones the best, he knew Charlie was the one who picked out the chewy things because of one night she'd caugh him biting his hand when he was worried about sam who was on a hunt without him for one of the first times since they'd been at the bunker.
"Dad gave him a cupcake for his birthday every year around May second, not always on the right day, but it always happened, but I was the one who gave him little presents every year. So of course I remembered Sammy's birthday, he's my little brother." Dean told him, subconcisely messing with one of the toys Charlie and Eileen gave him, he didn't want to talk about it further and Cas could tell it hurt to talk about.
It started for Sam with a phone call from Cas, it filled him with dread, but still neither knew what could possibly be wrong.
Dean was tired, he had told Sam that so many times, he had told anyone who he cared about that he was tired, he guesses they just didn't believe him, maybe he had said it too much to where they were just used to hearing it.
"A cabin, I will not tell you where because in your state of mind I do not want you going anywhere without me." Cas told him, knowing Dean would need to know eventually, "before you ask, everyone is safe and at the bunker, but I want- everyone wants to make sure you aren't a danger to yourself before we go back, including telling me if something makes you uncomfortable."
