Sherlock froze where he was and then glared up at the Dom.
"It's your only word," Greg countered. He walked around him for a moment then paused just behind. He pushed his foot between his legs and nudged at his caged cock.
As Sherlock ran, watching the floor disappear beneath him on his phone, he couldn’t believe how ingenious this plan was. He didn’t mind running, but doing it because he had upset his Dom put a spin on it that he couldn’t quite get his head around. It made every step feel that bit heavier, but in another light, every step was closer to John, to his forgiveness; therefore making it lighter in comparison to the previous one.
“My fault.” John was proud of it, not ashamed of it. “It was the least I could do for my sub.”
"Good, because I don't." He couldn't help thinking about Mummy. Had she enjoyed what she had done to him or had she simply not cared? He wasn't sure which idea was worse.
The moment it was slipped between Sherlock's lips, he began drinking greedily. The water tasted so good and he couldn't get enough.
“Go where?” John asked wearily, the light pouring in through the window suggested it was an acceptable hour to be awake, even if it was an unusual awakening.
Sherlock sniffed. "Like a safe word?"
“I… No, sir. Sorry, sir.” He closed his eyes in defeat and his ear was released. “You’re going to make me start a new tally, aren’t you?”
Together, they untied him enough to make him kneel up. Whilst John applied the pegs to his boys nipples, Greg and Mycroft used a length of rope to tie the detective in his kneeling position. The rope wrapped around his calfs, tying them to the bench so he couldn't move his legs at all.
“I give you your own space, yes. Last night would have been dangerous if I had left you. There was a high probability that you would ’drop.”
“He's dead,” the detective replied, but it was in the direction of the DI.
John closed his eyes and nodded once, then he realised that was exactly how this could be fixed. He had to be specific with Sherlock, and the three of them just had to act normally around him. Act like nothing had happened. "I'm sorry, pet. I should have made myself clear. Get in with us after you pass around the beers, then come sit next to me."
Greg couldn’t believe his friend’s naivety, but then he didn’t know his sub intimately like he, himself did.
“We better get going, Sherlock,” Mycroft said from the door. “Or we won’t be back in time for dinner.”
The doctor knelt behind his sub and removed his shoes and socks. At least he could do that much. Sherlock wriggled his toes, inspring John to tickle them. He couldn't move under John's ministrations even if he had had the energy to try.
“May I ask a question, sir?” Sherlock's voice was incredibly quiet as he spoke.
“Panic has these effects on subs differently. It is fine.”
“What do you mean ‘what is that’, your brother said you’ve had Doms before?”
John shrugged. "If attention is what he wants…" He walked out of the bedroom and across the cottage to the wet playroom.
The doctor smiled a greeting and shook the proffered hand.
“I moved, sir. I made you angry, sir.”
John smiled softly to himself. "Come over and lay on the bed."
Greg clipped Mycroft on the back of the head sharply. "Enough!" The DI reached out, snagged Mycroft by the scruff of the neck and had him on the floor, on his knees bent double in seconds.
Huffing through the gag, the detective knelt, further annoyed when the Dom joined his cuffs together behind his back and joined his feet. John poked and prodded his position until he was knelt upright perfectly, back as straight as possible.
than that, it felt fantastic. His cock was throbbing with pent up arousal. It always felt worse when the cage came off. He remembered it was there, he knew that sounded stupid, but sometimes he would like his Dom to fuck him with the cage on. It was at that point, with that thought going through his head, that John changed his position. He did it slowly to prepare the sub. He hit his prostate straight on, once, twice, three times and suddenly his release spurted from the tip of his cock before he tried to stop it. He coated his own shirt as well as his Dom’s in come. He wasn’t aware of anything for a moment, but when he came to, he was on his knees in front of John’s chair. The post orgasm bliss evaporated in a second at the look on his Dom’s face and he swallowed hard. “Sir-”
Greg treasured the sharp pull of his hair and focused on pleasing John far more than the others had.
"Not at all. It wasn’t a difficult task for the genius.”
Sherlock sat in the cell for at least another hour before the door opened, heavy and groaning.
"Good boy," he whispered softly.
"You know how bloody far from the truth you are with that statement."
John watched him for a moment. “You're all over the place. What's wrong?”
“John-”
“What of it?”
At the lack of response, the doctor continued, “This attitude will not go unpunished, pet, but you are clearly tired after yesterday’s events, so you can have an extra hour in bed. When you wake at 8 we can discuss the tally we didn’t deal with last night.”
He grabbed Sherlock's hand as he went to lift it. Using it as leverage, he spun him enough to grab his other wrist. Sherlock knew there was no point fighting, he trusted the doctor and yesterday had proven that, but now-
“You ok, boss?” Sam asked, looking concerned as he closed the door behind the sub.
This wasn't good. This was really, really bad.
"I'll start deducing John."
“Yes, sir. Sorry, sir.”
John smiled sadly, "Sure, mate. On the floor."
Damnit! He was better than Mycroft! He pulled the stool over and clambered up, he needed to see out before his hands or collar went near it. He thought of trying to get the collar off, he was, after all, good at locks, but that was beside the point. All or nothing. However that wouldn’t anger John, it would upset him, Sherlock was sure. He seemed to be a very sentimental Dom and the aim of this was not to anger or upset the doctor, but to prove a point.
Head low and cock throbbing, the government official crawled to where he was told and stopped beside the door.
John smiled. “A pet. For now.” It would have been a boy, but he had asked. He paced the room, pausing at the shelves along one side of the ‘play’ part of the room as opposed to the ‘punishment’ side.

He threw himself back on the sofa and tucked his feet up beneath him so he could try and focus on his Mind Palace again.
The doctor chuckled. "It's a good job it's not cold, boy, that might have made you jump a little higher."
Greg held his finger to his lips and then pointed at the kneeling sub. Mycroft had curled into his Dom’s leg and had fallen fast asleep.
Mycroft’s pout stayed firmly in place but Greg just rolled his eyes. “Two minutes.”
The detective pulled free. “I don’t get what the big deal is! After Donovan took her away these events are hardly a surprise.”
“I don’t mean to interrupt the clever people, but that outburst can’t look good to a jury?”
“I’m good here, thank you, John. Plenty of work I can do,” he smirked up at the younger man, well aware his brother was about to be in all sorts of trouble.
Eurus started digging through the box of equipment. "But I've got what I want."
Telling himself they only needed to endure this for a few more hours, Mycroft dropped to his knees. "Can we get this over with? I have important work to attend to when I return to London."
“It may be temporary to start with.”
“What is it?” John asked. “What are you hiding?” He heard his own sub sniggering behind him. Clearly having already deduced what was going on.
Sherlock didn't even work his jaw.
Across the room Sherlock had begun an string of expletives. John shut him up by the simple expedient of sticking three fingers into his mouth. Unfortunately, the sub bit down on them in protest.
“Like he hasn’t seen his baby brother being punished before.”
"I will not spank you or use the strap whilst you are in so much bother with your leg. I will keep your tally total until you are well enough for it to be dealt with. In the mean time." John got to his feet and left the room.
The silver thing shimmered and then disappeared. Sherlock blinked at where it had been before stepping out of their landlady's flat.
"Oi!" Greg complained. "None of that. I really need to relax and I know for a fact my pet has some sore muscles that need to soak. Behave, Doctor Watson."
John was so... casual was the only word for it. He had structure to his day, but he also had freedom. Freedom he hadn’t expected from a Dom, let alone a professional one.
Sherlock laughed and snatched up his violin, opting to play a decent version of the national anthem.
The little boy was refusing to wake up and Sherlock was in the shower.
“Apple,” the little boy grinned as John let him tap the button, but the boy just frowned again.
Mycroft didn't look so sure but he didn't say anything, just went back to his breakfast.
"It bloody is! If it wasn't for him I wouldn't be stuck in this stupid cage in the first place."
Sherlock curled up into a ball as soon as he was placed on the bed. He still felt like a failure, something he wasn't used to feeling.
"Come, pet."
John waited to hear any actual complaints and then closed his eyes briefly. The spanking with his hand he could do quick and easy... The strap... Well Sherlock wasn't going to enjoy it but that was the point.
Greg was about to ask what was taking so long, but he spotted John holding Finn and knew instantly. He was stood beside Mycroft, his girls beside him.
Sherlock just sobbed harder.
"Do you know why you're being punished, submissive?" John's voice took on the formal punishment tone that Sherlock really didn't like, the old punishments were hardly casual but he made himself sound so detached.
Finn, his tongue sticking out, started stirring and stirring until he had a good batter.
"Two, sir."
John pulled the gag from his mouth.
“'Course I did!” Sherlock snapped.
“He’ll open up when he needs to.”
“Unless I have expressed permission from you, sir.” Sherlock was defeated now, shoulders rounded, head down.
"Firm but fair."
“Then go and put the kettle on. Mycroft would you like a cup of coffee?”
John got no response, however. Rather than jumping to the wrong conclusions and deciding Sherlock was ignoring him – after his attitude so far since he’d been caught, he knew that would be a bad interpretation of his actions to come to - he realised that his sub might not know the answer and his pride was too large for him to admit it. Rather than punish him further, he would help him. Sherlock needed to know that Doms weren’t against him or subs in general, he had just come across a bad bunch. He needed to gain the detective’s trust and the only way that was going to happen would be through communication and punishing him when it was justified, not when he felt like it or when Sherlock was upset about something. The sub needed to know if he was upset or angry that he could talk to John about it, not the alternative, which would be shouting and yelling until he had caused enough offence to be punished.
"You came here of your own free will, Miss Adler," Mycroft turned his nose up at her. "It appears our sister it too much for you to handle. You got too big... too clever. You couldn't beat Sherlock, how did you expect to beat Eurus?"
"Yes!" Finn agreed, kicking his feet and almost falling off.
At that, the older sub started shaking his head frantically.

Kate grinned. “That's amazing. Where did you go?”
"You must have woken up, realised you were cold and put socks on and then gone back to bed."
"Oof, watch it, John."
“There was only one piece left…”
"Want me to do it again?"
“No, sir.”
Counting without protest. This was definitely an improvement and John could see that it was going to be a good day.
“37. Sir.”
John jerked awake at the third time that Mycroft thrashed on the bed.
“There was, yeah. I was um…” he turned his head away, not wanting to speak about it anymore. He wanted to talk to talk to him, he wanted to believe he could trust him. He’d been there when Wilkes had gone too far. He’d looked after him and not punished him like he believed he deserved but there was something. Something inconceivable that wouldn’t let him. It hadn’t even been 3 weeks and he’d let the Dom get too close to him.
“Panic is a reaction in a sub caused by a lack of understand or a bad memory or… no sign of help or assistance. Talking to you about my bad memories has been helping me come to terms with them. They don’t worry me anymore, at least not like they used to. Plus, you're here, so what else is there to worry about?”
Greg’s head fell back, partly in frustration, partly in disappointment.
answers.
Sherlock sniffed and looked out over the ocean.
“That’s one.”
Deciding he was getting distracted by reminiscing, Sherlock shook his head and listened for John, but there was no sound coming from the other man which was a welcome relief.
“What do you say, pet?” John asked, nudging him slightly when Sherlock didn’t respond. His glare clearly said ‘Don’t let me down’. He was secretly wondering how they knew each other. When there was a further 10 seconds with no sub greeting, John moved out of the way and clipped him on the back of the head. “Unlike you to be so shy.”
He rang off and sighed, he would check all the rooms on this floor in order. The only room with anything of significance with what Mycroft had just said was the one next to Sherlock’s.
“Like a dog.”
"Right, so talk."
John clocked him on the back of the head. "I didn't let you loose just to get yourself off. Get up."
The Dom strode right up to within inches of his sub and shoved his hand in the detective's curls, Sherlock managed to control a wince at the tug, it wasn’t soft and gentle.
Mycroft went swiftly down onto his knees, not wanting to get caught up in whatever was about to happen to his brother. He was certain it wouldn't be good.
The detective sighed and glanced up, slowing down to just one step at a time. Both Doms were on the landing outside of the room where the dead woman was. “But they take the poison themselves; they chew, swallow the pills themselves. There are clear signs even you lot couldn’t miss them.”
The sub bit his lip to try and stop, but it didn't really work. Suddenly, he couldn't take it anymore. Despite being cuffed, he leapt to his feet and ran towards the door. He needed to find a place to hide where he could wallow in his shame and self pity.
Sherlock’s customary glare was back.
The drive back to Baker Street was much more relaxed and pleasant than the drive to the courthouse had been.
“Because you’re not gonna do that.”
A guard walked over immediately and removed the gag from Mycroft, he dropped it in his lap.
"Hmm," the Superintendent murmured.
"It's every reason, pet. You know as well as I do that you get yourself into trouble when you're bored. I'm not letting that happen."
"And if that isn't enough of a threat - that you know I will stick to - how about 5 instant slaps with the strap?"
“Are you sure?”
Mycroft managed to break his fall but he did nothing else, he just lay there and took it. The pair of them had decided on the way over to do whatever they were told to no matter what, then they would go home and forget about it completely.
Sherlock grunted his complaint, but both Dom's ignored him. He could always use his safe signal. If he chose not to, then he must be getting something out of the situation. Or be willing to calm down enough to accept the punishment without getting off on it.
It turned out that Sherlock had quite good upper body strength and when he had finally expelled all his arms’ strength he took a deep breath through his nose.
They waited like that for what felt like forever. When the detective was finally calm enough, John stood up, resting heavily on his cane for the first time all day.
"The thing that always gets to me is how sometimes she repeats things over and over and other times she's completely original and random."
Nodding once, John turned to the stool he’d set up. “Stand.”
When the car pulled up, John grabbed his sub by the scuff of the neck and dragged him bodily from the vehicle.
“And?”
"John!" The detective responded snarkily.
“Pet?” Greg’s question was a low growl as he stalked across the room.
Sherlock glanced up at her, he didn't want to piss her off while things seemed calm. "I use a good hair products. John laughs at me about it," he admitted.
"Yes you can. Everything you've said… I've heard it all before and probably worse."
"Boy, get your arse up here."
John walked in on the end of that discussion. "All the more reason for you both to eat. No, no arguing. You'll eat what I cook."
“Could’a fooled me.”
Mycroft closed his eyes then let them snap open. "Gregory!" He yelled out.
Rolling his eyes, the detective got to his feet.
Sherlock wandered into the living room next, his blue dressing gown hanging off his shoulder. "You need your own photo album or you'll wear that one out," he said as he dropped into his chair.
The laughing continued.
“It’s going in there, boy, whether you fight it or not.”
“You are in a lot of trouble,” John hissed in his sub’s ear once Mrs. Hudson had left. He threw him into the wall, “put your hands against it. Now!”
Seeing that Sherlock didn't understand, John fell back on their dynamic. "If nothing is wrong, then march back to the house and kneel in the living room until I get back."
Hissing in pain, the government official closed his eyes and let himself settle into the discomfort.
"A humbler? He'd have to come out of the cage too."
“Isn't this punishment enough?”
"You know, Ice Man. It must be difficult to go from control over an entire country, to this."
The detective's face had flushed a bright red and the colour was creeping down his chest. He would have been making pleading sounds, but he was biting the gag to help himself stay silent. He found himself slipping into subspace, but didn't want to be. He tried to shift to see if he could make John move, but it didn't work.
Mycroft stood and followed the two Doms, keeping his hands behind his head resting at his nape. He couldn't help but shake his head at his brother who had started struggling again.
"Do you miss it? Hospital work?"
“Your brother said you were a cheeky brat.” The eight words were said almost… fondly? No, that couldn’t be right. “He said that you hate to be dominated. Pretty shit trait in a submissive.”
The detective looked at John pleadingly for help. The blond just shrugged in response and went back to the waffle machine.
“Of course, I’ll be through in a moment.”
The government official nodded and rocked back and forth, his cock still burning.
John let out a heavy sigh. "That's something, at least." He hooked his arm through Greg's and they started walking.
"The desk is here for show," Greg clarified for John who was watching, slightly unsure himself.
Sherlock’s shoulders relaxed as he sighed in relief. “A case has to take priority, sir,” he answered honestly.
Sherlock's eyes went wide until he realised where he was.
"Move!" Irene yelled at the older Holmes.
"Mine."
"Yes you did. Then made it far more difficult than you needed too."
She and Irene made a good team when it came to that.
The light came on in the room and a loud noise blared over the speaker system. Mycroft covered his brothers ears against the sound, then immediately felt guilty because Sherlock couldn't block it out himself. He pulled his jacket over Sherlock's shoulders and over his head.
"For what?"
"I know. He's such a brat. It's a shame he is so gorgeous and intelligent, or I would leave him here permanently."
Greg snorted. "You kidding? He's always like that."
When a waiter came over to take their order, Mycroft was rather surprised to see that Sherlock didn’t look embarrassed about where he was knelt, he didn’t look shifty, just straightened up slightly. He just spoke to the young man in a calm manner, ordering John's for him.
Sherlock kicked him angrily, his head tilted to the side. He was dead. He was wrong! How the bloody hell had he been wrong… the man could have been lying. In fact, it was highly probable he was.
"It's my favourite word," he growled, teeth close together.
Irene stopped and locked the chain off, then she ran both hands through both brothers' hair at the same time.
“I’m on my way over. Where’s Sherlock?”
Mycroft settled by his Dom happily, but he cast a worried frown in his brother's direction. He couldn't help but fret over him. At the touch of Greg's hand on his shoulder, however, he returned his attention to his Dom.
"Sir, I was just-"
His eyes flickered toward Finn briefly. He couldn’t help but think that boy had helped as much as he, Mycroft and John had combined.
When he was done, he got rid of the jar and climbed up onto the bed to lay next to his sub. He looked down at Sherlock for a moment from where he sat back up against the headboard. He was facing the other way and seemed to have calmed down, his breathing shallow. John could mistake him for being asleep, but knew better.
Without saying another word. Mycroft stood with his pizza and swapped it for the one on Sherlock's lap.
"It's Irene's little pet name for you. Jim liked it too." She tried it out again. "Ice Man. Ice. Man. Iceman. Oh, I like it."
“Because the punishment is the paddling and part of the reminder of the lesson you should have learned is the pain afterwards. It doesn’t mean it should be excessive and it doesn’t mean it can’t be eased should it be possible.”
As he worked a second finger in, he put his foot on the spreader bar, pinning his feet to the floor as well as out wide. “I can leash you to the floor if you don’t keep still yourself, Sherlock.”
“No you don’t, sir.”
"I don't expect you to count," the older man informed him. "This will hurt enough without you worrying about that."
Mycroft snorted. "Very elegant, little brother."
Mycroft's expression didn't look overly impressed as his collar was tightened but he didn't argue verbally, which was fortunate for him. Greg gave his boy's thigh a long stroke, then gave his arse cheek a hard squeeze. While Greg continued to work on Mycroft, the doctor paced across the room to where Sherlock was, he crouched down beside the too still man. Blowing lightly into Sherlock's ear, John saw little tremors of delight travel across his boy's skin. He leant closer and sucked Sherlock's earlobe into his mouth, nibbling on it.
Mycroft cupped his brother's cheek. "It is not your job to decide what does and does not upset your Dom. That's his decision. It's also not down to you to predict the future. You didn't know you were going to hurt yourself doing your job. You didn't know you'd bump into Miss Adler and you didn't know how she would react. Stop worrying about things you have no control over.

It had to be the shepherd's pie they had had last month. It was simple enough. "You are actually going to eat it if I cook it, right?"
Greg bent down and picked up a shell. He brushed the sand off and looked at it. It was beautiful and he handed it to Mycroft. The government official made an appreciative noise and handed it to his brother.
Irene still had her foot pressed to Sherlock's neck.
He didn’t look impressed.
Sherlock looked away, embarrassed.
Sherlock didn't care about that, but he didn't say anything. Instead he moved around so he could massage the stiffness out of John's shoulder.
In relief, what was left of the soap just fell out of his mouth, but the taste was still there. It was still there and it was awful.
John glanced across the room at Sherlock then ignored him again. "Mycroft, pass me mine please."
The Dom pulled a leather collar from his pocket and moved towards his newfound sub. He unbuckled and moved to do it up around the detective’s neck. Sherlock grit his teeth as the blond did what he wanted.
“New police issue,” the Dom hissed in his ear. “Perfect for rats like you.”
Sherlock tried to move away, forgetting his feet were chained together.
"Why would we have-"
“Please, sir,” he whimpered.
“Could I ask a favour, sir?”
“Disobey me the way you did and you have things to make up. For a start, proving to me you can take care of yourself, once again. That is, after all, one of the main reasons that you are here, isn't it?”
As soon as Sherlock put on his coat, the doctor took his hand and pulled him along. He had decided he needed to be very clear with Sherlock, but it didn’t seem like enough. He couldn’t put a halt to this side of the relationship or Sherlock would believe he had done something wrong. Again. He hated this Sherlock, but it was better than no Sherlock at all.
Sherlock looked down at the floor, his nose crinkling as he thought. "Oh." He looked over at his Dom. "I want that too. That was... good."
“Please, Beth, treat him normally. He’s scared enough.”
“How- How’s Myc?” he asked tentatively, interrupting the DI from his thoughts.
"You have thi-thirty seconds to finish me off, Sherlock. Or a punishment will be warranted."
Mycroft let out a huff, then started edging backwards an inch at a time. It seemed to take him forever to get out of the corner.
"Of course, he didn't delete Casper," John muttered, following his friend onto the street."
Sherlock blinked as he processed the Dom's words. "More, if you please, sir." He didn't want to be able to thrash about. Not like he was expecting John to do anything else, it was clear what he intended.
“I’m on it, Mycroft!” he snapped back, not ready to face the anger of the older Holmes whilst the younger one was in Panic in the corner and already hurt.
"Ok then," Greg laughed.
"Problem?"
Sherlock ground his teeth but glanced at his brother. "Yes, mistress," he growled.
"Yes, sir."
"Nice one, boys," Greg said with a grin. "I was expecting it to take you a few days."
And gagged as he was grabbed by the arm and thrown into the wall by the doctor.
"I don't know, sir."
The doctor could see him wanting to ring off, but he reconsidered quickly.
He calmed immediately at John's touch and even moreso when the doctor kissed him.
“Sir,” Sherlock complained tugging at his wrists, despite knowing he couldn't pull them apart. Even now, it felt like something he had to do.
Sherlock jerked in surprise when John reached up and cupped his cheek. "Fancy a bit of paddling, babe?"
"Please, mistress," he begged after a minute.
"Yes, sir," he repeated.
“What if I need the toilet?”
Greg crawled over to the TV and turned it off, then came back to John. He wanted to lay his head back down, but hadn't been told to, so refrained.
"Have you got another one?" Irene asked the youngest Holmes.
“No, sir. It’s… I get excited with cases and forget things and…”
Greg shrugged. "I don't need much, just a short chance to let go."
Unsurprisingly, the boy began sucking with a lot more enthusiasm, swirling his tongue around the Dom’s knuckles.
John cradled him to his chest like he might disappear at any moment. “You were such a good boy for me tonight, Sherlock. Do you know that?”
"Yeah." Greg followed John into the kitchen. Both men knew the brothers needed to talk, even if they did so without uttering a single word.
Greg laughed. "Maybe it is the point."
"You know how this works," John spun him around and went to a near cupboard. He pulled out a plug.
John smiled sadly, he should have known. Without wasting time, John scooped his boy up and carried him into the house. "Oh, pet, I wish you'd told me you'd hurt yourself. We wouldn't have had to sit through Irene yapping away."
“So you set up surveillance on
John grinned and ran his other hand down his face. "You can safeword, mate. Do, you can come and we can go and play with our boys."
Greg shrugged. “I don’t. I just bloody hope so.”
Finn chose an orange bucket and a lime green spade. Then he found a bag of small castle shaped moulds. "Can have this? Pweese."
“Good boy,” John whispered when it was empty.
“I have enough evidence to charge you, Sherlock,” he replied eventually
The Dominatrix bit her lip, then went and fetched a cane. When she came back, she used it to strike each of the brothers on the arse, urging them along.
Sherlock held it in both hands but rested his head on John’s shoulder, seeking comfort. He didn’t respond verbally to the comment just nodded, rubbing his head up and down over the Dom’s shoulder.
Evening rolled around and Sherlock’s belly rumbled loudly. Usually by now he would be hungry. A few months ago a couple of days without food was as natural as breathing, but the last few weeks regular meals had done him the world of good and he had definitely noticed. That still didn’t mean he would eat what was on the tray. He wanted John;
"Not. Yours." Sherlock hissed back. He brought his foot up and kicked her away from him, grinning as she went sprawling on the floor. Sherlock burst out laughing at her, and Mycroft was clearly smirking around the gag that wedged his mouth open.
“How many times have you been cuffed with those things?” John asked. “Enough to know you can’t get out of them anyway.” He picked Sherlock up again and threw him over his shoulder. “You should be thinking yourself lucky, boy. I could have quite easily have dealt with you in the front room. In front of your brother.”
Sherlock was actually asleep, or at least appeared to be.
On the other side of the car, Sherlock slipped into the seat and closed the door.
Greg folded his arms. "Now turn back around and get back in the corner."
Sherlock felt the dildo push deep inside him, his hole accommodating it without much resistance. He saw stars as it brushed his prostate and his head fell back. It felt like the sound inside his cock was getting larger as his dick tried to respond to the sensation.
John smiled, glad it had been the honorific question raised rather than a grunted ‘what’.
John reached forward and cupped the detective's cheek, tilting his head back. "You will be punished for that, but not with another enema."
John grinned at Mrs. Hudson. He couldn't help it. He was so proud of his husband and how he handled Finn. He never would have dreamt Sherlock could be like this during that first mad case that had brought them together.
John shook his head, staring at the younger sub. “May I make a suggestion?”
With a low, menacing growl, Eurus tackled the Dominatrix to the floor, beating her with her fists.
“And that’s not to mention how happy and settled Finn is, and you and Sherlock. There’s no pressure here, mate. Just think about it.”
"Well, if you need an excuse, dear, I'll be able to help look after Finn," Mrs. Hudson said with an exasperated air.
Irene brought the cane around and struck Mycroft on the thigh. "What do you say?" Irene barked when Sherlock was about to lunge.
"Oh my, you're so right, unless they're muzzled." She returned to the box and came back with two gags.
Sherlock nodded and then eased himself up slightly on his arms. Up and down. Up and down. He felt like a yoyo, but it felt good. No,
The sub didn't answer with his eyes still shut, making the Dom pause and look over him properly. "That was a question, pet," he prompted levelly.
"Yeah. Fine," he groaned as Sherlock pushed his fingers in. "You have about a million years to stop that."
"I'm sorry, Irene," he continued, becoming more and more concerned, his coffee forgotten, "but we really should be going, it seems my submissive is getting tired."
“Stop!” John barked, smacking his naked thigh. “Don’t make this any harder on yourself.”
“Boy…” His new sub was walking a very fine line, he didn’t seem to be doing it on purpose however, more like he had merely forgotten the way things worked here. The way authority worked.
"May I paddle, sir?" He needed to be alone, away from the others for a few minutes.
Sherlock worked his jaw and glared at the doctor in response.
At the sound of footsteps on the stairs he took a deep breath and walked towards the door.
"But you've just been promoted-" Mycroft started.
As the Dominatrix talked, the brother's eyes met. They knew Irene didn't understand what she was dealing with in Eurus. The Dominatrix was playing a danger game and didn't even know it.
“Hmm. Never done it in February,” John laughed. “But you haven’t been out of the house for a few days and I know you hate feeling caged in.”
Eurus got to her feet and paced across the room.
Greg had known it would be a long shot, if he'd been in John's shoes and Mycroft had behaved in such a way... he'd do exactly the same. He told the doctor that and rang off, hoping he had been reassuring.
At the look on his face John burst out laughing. "Let's leave him to it."
"Good." John took his hand and together they got to their feet and headed back to the bedroom.
look at Donovan.
“Yes, sir,” the detective bowed his head low, so low that John saw the back of his collar.
"Sherlock! You said you made sure he would never come back!" Mrs Hudson said, rushing out of her flat.
“Down you go,” Mycroft instructed, pushing his brother down to the sofa with a hand on both of his shoulders.
The way he said it so easily made the Dom’s heart clench. He was glad he had decided against it at this point otherwise he would be in one hell of a position.
“Sir?”
Sherlock spent the next few hours hiding. The hallway on the second floor had many rooms that he’d never even thought of going in, they couldn’t be important though because his Dom had never mentioned them to say not to go in. But first he had gone to his room to find some clothes. He’d realised that his plan to anger the Dom had gone well out of the window days ago, he was too patient to be wound up. He couldn’t work out what he was thinking, submitting so easily. What was it about this Dom that made him want to be good? He didn’t know, but it was a question he had been asking himself for days but he still hadn’t managed to put his finger on it. Guilt hit him when he realised that John must have left the door to the playroom unlocked, here the Dom was trying to trust him and he rushes off throwing that trust right back in his face.
"Yes, sir." The government official hid his surprise and went to do as he had been told. His insides were clenched up in sympathy for his brother, although the memory of the morning's small explosion dampened it a bit. He prepared the enema precisely as he knew his Dom wanted it done, then carried it to him.
“You should be licking and hollowing out your cheeks, Sherlock, the gag does not prevent that.” The doctor sighed heavily. “You can be as quick or as slow perfecting this as you like, but pointing out the obvious, you don’t like it much so logic would suggest GETTING ON WITH IT!” John ended on a yell making the younger man flinch.
Mycroft fell in behind his brother. He looked towards the camera in the corner knowing they were being watched.
Mycroft covered his face with his hands. "Sorry, sirs."
John bent over and picked the struggling man up, throwing him over his shoulder. He took him out of the wet room and towards the room with the suspension set up.
Sherlock hadn’t failed to notice the cane he heavily relied upon, the Dom had used it the last time his brother had practically dragged him into the same room as the blond. The difference was, this time, the older man stopped whilst stood, therefore Sherlock had also not failed to notice that he barely leant on it at all. He was about to comment on it, but was frozen in his tracks by the Dom before he could.
She grabbed him by the chin. "What's with the sour face."
“He feels he let you down.”
“Suitcase, yes.” Sherlock seemed to dismiss the older men’s confusion. “She’s contracted with the same Dom for at least ten years, but not happily.” He looked around for a moment. “She’s had a string of lovers but none of them knew she was in a contract.”
“I was hoping we could play together in here first rather than punishment, but you had to try and run off.”
The boy had to stop himself looking back down at the cause of his small outburst.
“Answer. Now!”
This chapter is dedicated to mariaWASD. She knows why ;)
"I don't know-"
Greg did just that, but John didn't make a move to open him up or fuck him, just left him bent over it while he fucked his cock with hand.
But Greg was laughing too.
“He always has been one for racing off…”
"I'm going to go and check on Mycroft," Greg announced.
“4, sir.”
"Hello, little sister," Sherlock said, sounding cheerful.
The DI smiled and slid into the seat. Mycroft didn’t move to rest on his leg, but he moved to kneel beside the younger man. Sherlock couldn’t help but smile within the confines of John’s protective grasp. He hardly ever saw his older brother in trouble. Even though he had lived with the pair, Mycroft was the ‘perfect’ sub and many of his characteristics led to him being a Dom-like figure while Sherlock had stayed with him.
Sherlock doubted he would fall asleep but he leant against the Dom's leg, revelling in the comforting presence that he probably didn't deserve.
“Eager, pet?” John chuckled as he placed his coat next to Sherlock's.
The third time John tugged the leash, the sub dropped what was in his hand. That action scared him into turning around and grabbing hold of the leash tightly so the material dug into his fingers. He tugged at it sharply.
“Am I forgiven, sir?” He asked after a while, he found he didn’t like this Dom being mad with him he
John smacked the back of Sherlock's head as the detective made another move towards his zip. "Greg, you may have to find a place to pull over. If this one doesn't behave, I may need some gear from the boot."
“That wasn’t deliberate, was it?”
Sherlock blinked dumbly when his cock was grabbed and squeezed.
“So, Sherlock,” Irene began, intrigued by the man John had spoken so highly of, “you're a detective?”
In response, Mycroft mouthed, "Sorry, sir."
"I'm more pissed at you calling me doggie, in all fairness."
"Its been a week, you've been relatively good for the last 3 days. And today you were amazing. I am ready to start trusting you again."
Finn glanced at Greg slightly confused. The DI just winked making him smile.
“Will you punish me if I don’t?” Sherlock’s tone was a bit more abrupt than either of them were anticipating.
The detective opened his mouth once, twice, then closed it again, glancing at Greg.
He quickly snapped the cuffs around his wrists that Greg had given him out in the corridor, well aware they'd be needed. Then he grabbed him by the arm and spun him around.
Sherlock had charged up the stairs and then held back as he remembered John.
Despite his own aches, Mycroft thrashed against the cross as the two woman used Sherlock's balls as if they were ping pong balls.
It took a moment for the order to sink in, but when it did, Greg moved his hands quickly, settling them behind his back.
Mycroft pushed his pants down and stepped out of them, then he joined Greg under the hot water and into his embrace.
"Not fair!"
That made the doctor look around in search of it, he shook his head in confusion about to ask his boy as well but he was off again.
Eurus wiggled the dildo again. "Yes, but I don't want to be bored. Let's play with Mycie next."
“Well… he still went to prison, but for the burglary on the other side of town rather than murder. He didn’t even know the guy. I have no idea how New Scotland Yard made such an elaborate leap. Just because he was ‘in the area’. They wouldn’t know-”
Greg slapped him instantly. "Watch your mouth boy, or you'll be walking the beach with a gag in your mouth. I don't care who might see it."
“Say yes sir, boy, or I will gag you again.”
He ran his hand through Sherlock's sweaty curls, trying to calm him down so he could breathe properly.
“Your attitude is not helping your situation, Sherlock. I would have thought after a month, you would be well aware of this.” He picked up his stick again and began to pace around the kneeling sub. “Punishment from Dom to sub is for the benefit of learning a lesson as well as letting the submissive feel guilt free. You know this. Now crawl to the clothes in that pile and get changed. You won’t just drop your suit on the floor either, you will lay it over the back of the chair and deal with it later.”
John closed his eyes and leant back, thudding his head against the top of the bench several times.
He would not be caught unawares again. It would make him slip up. He would not give John reason to punish him even more and even if he did - by accident, mind - the reason would certainly not be this woman. He couldn't bear the sight of disappointment in the doctor again so soon. He wanted to make him happy. To prove to him he could behave. That's what the whole contract was about, wasn't it?
The Dom dry washed his face, taking several deep breathes while leaning against the rear wheel arch.
There really was no choice. Mycroft moved out of the way and let Irene work. Much to his surprise, she unfastened the cuffs and did nothing more.
“Alright,” he growled after a few more minutes, but just as the DI began to loosen his grip, the doctor turned, spotted Donovan in the window of CID and fought like mad for freedom again.
“Is that because of the British Government sat beside you?” John asked of the other Dom, when the owner turned away again.
"That's... scary. I think we're corrupting him."
The doctor flicked the light off and shut the door.
"It's intrigued."
Mycroft dropped to one knee, trying to cushion the impact.
"Don't worry, Irene, she'll be watching," Sherlock laughed from the floor.
When Greg removed it, he stroked his pet's cock until it was nice and hard, then he gave it a slap, causing Mycroft to wince.
"Now clean me up, gently mind," he added as he unbuckled the gag and watched him stretch his jaw.
None of the other men saw it coming, but as soon as they reached the beach, Mycroft pulled out of Greg's grip, grabbed Sherlock's hand and ran off towards the sea.
This time John managed to grab his hair and forced him to his knees. "Problem with that?"
The detective sobbed, still on his knees and John knelt beside him holding him tight.
When they reached the top floor the DI was already waiting for them.
“I don't want to.”
“Well, I would say you are practically there. Just one last thing.” He covered his hand in lube and began running it up and down his boy’s cock. Deciding to make it easier for the younger man this time, he whispered, “You can come when you’re ready.”
“Um…” Sherlock stumbled again, Sherlock never stumbled. “Greg popped around earlier while you were out.” He cleared his throat, his confidence gaining, but only slightly as he stood up straighter. “He tends to come to me when he is out of his depth.” He appeared quite proud of this fact and John smiled.
Before the Irishman could respond, the screeching of tires could be heard as Sherlock was almost thrown flat on his face if it wasn't for the chains holding him to the van floor. The van jerked to a stop, going up on the curb as it did so.
"I was attention seeking, you don't have to go. Please don't go," he dropped to his knees in front of the doctor.
“Morning.”
As soon as the water was at the perfect temperature, John took his boy's hands and helped him to his feet. They stepped into the shower together, the hot water washing over them both.
He would have spat endless vitriol in her face if he could have done.
They heard a quiet, “In!” and the older Holmes brother stumbled into the room.
"Sir-"
John helped Mycroft, Mrs. Hudson, and his father-in-law to carry in all the leftover stuff from the beach as Greg hurried the girls inside.
Knowing she had apparently done the right thing in Eurus' eyes, Irene snorted. "I don't care if they are too tight, if Eurus wants them that way, that's the way they will stay."
“Is it wrong to celebrate?”
The detective gawped at the room. It was decorated completely in a jungle theme. The bed was draped with mosquito netting and there were african masks hanging on the walls. In the corners, spears and blow guns were leaning against the wall artfully.
He scrambled off the bed to land in front of Sherlock where he was staring down at the broken dishes, breathing heavily. He yelled something incoherent and John knew he had to stop the ‘explosion’ that was imminent.
The doctor was suspicious. "Yes, but why?"
“Er…” she seemed to recognise the Dom’s obvious dissatisfaction with the younger man and felt the need to point out what a good sub would do, so she held up the tape for him. “Try the main road.”
"That will never not be the weirdest sensation."
“John?” Sherlock asked, confused. “Did you hear that?”
"Fold them." The Dom jerked his head at the clothes that the detective had just dropped in an unsatisfactory heap. "You know this. 12."
John sighed. One of his closest friends’ little brother had some serious trust issues. Those stupid bloody Doms that came before him.
John paused for a moment before he opened his mouth. "They don't have to be mutually exclusive."
“Doctor Watson,” the small blond was petite as she looked up over the reception desk. “You aren’t due in for several more weeks. Is everything going ok with your new submissive?”
“You will eat everything I give you. Your brother says you are way too underweight and that you don’t eat healthily if at all. As I am a doctor, I will make sure what I give you will help you to build up muscle mass and a better diet.”
“Hold this lump while I cuff this one over there.”
In no time, Sherlock had cleared his whole portion. John went to cup his cheek but realise he had gone incredibly pale. “Babe?”
"But, I don't-"
"I'm going to touch you in a minute. I will stroke you for 30 seconds. If you can control yourself I will let you have a proper orgasm at the end of it. If you can't, I'll change the dildo to the fucking machine and milk you dry. Say yes master."
"Pet, what is it?"
“Another one. Hands above your head! Disobey me again and I’ll punish you right now.”
The fun ended when Sherrinford came into sight. Mycroft's expression went from happy to blank in a heartbeat.
The detective nodded, his head buried into John's shoulder. “I'm sorry, sir,” he whispered.
“He knew you were helping him. Why did he bail?”
"What?"
“Cheeky shit.”
“John, this case is important!” Sherlock argued.
Mycroft bent and pressed his forehead to the floor. John was a good Dom, but Greg was so much better. Greg was the best.
The Dom ran his fingers through Sherlock's curls. "You're welcome." He smiled to himself at his pet's gratitude, but he refused to get too hopeful.
“I’m allowed in there alone, sir?”
"Thank me."
Sherlock turned his head to look at the Dominatrix. "You're quite the mercenary, hmm, Irene."
John sat up and sighed. "I wish I knew."
"Yes, sir," he whispered.
John smirked. "You're a terrible liar, pet."
Greg's mouth pressed into a thin line. Mycroft was right. Still it wasn't fair, but hell, life wasn't fair was it? "Shit." He turned to John. "He's right. I'm sorry, but he is."
“I’m sure the girls can figure it out,” Greg said with a chuckle. “The amount of this stuff they have at home is immense.”
Sherlock just ducked his head as John continued washing the still sub.
John took a deep breath and let out a shaky laugh. He rarely showed his own emotions to his subs, he would hide them behind a mask, but if something could be said of John Watson, it was his observational skills as a Dom. He may not be able to make deductions like a Holmes, but he could still tell a lot from a single glance, whether that was because of his army experience, the fact that he was a doctor or the fact that he was a professional Dom, he didn’t know. What he did know was right now, hiding his emotions from the near-broken man in front of him would have been a very stupid thing to do. “You’re right, of course. I’m sorry, it’s just…”
“I’m going to be 30 seconds, just while I get some stuff from the fridge.”
They didn't speak as they entered the room and approached Sherlock. He knew they were there, of course, and kicked up a bigger fuss.
Greg smoothed down his boy's hair, then he pushed him gently so he started spinning. "I don't think so, pet." As he watched Mycroft twist in the air, he debated how long he wanted to tease him before he did remove the cage. A glance at John made him realise the doctor was thinking the same thing.
"Be still, Mycie," Eurus ordered.
“No, pet. Use your words.”
He ran his hand up and down the boy’s arm, reassuringly. “Time for some lunch, pet.”
Sherlock smiled when John extended the leash out. It was retractable and reached nearly 15 yards, plenty of room for him to stretch his legs. The doctor walked with his hands in his pockets as he watched the younger man. He was so childlike at times as he examined some of the flowers around the edge of the lake.
Sherlock nodded once and got out of his clothes. This plan would work, he knew it would.
“John, things really aren't looking good for him.”
“Is he dead?” Sherlock’s voice was oddly detached.
More words were exchanged between the Doctor and the woman. After some back and forth, the Doctor reached in and pulled a blonde woman out of the blue box.
The Dom held his arms out and it didn’t take long for Sherlock to bury his sweaty self in his chest, wrapping his arms around him snugly. “I'm sorry, sir. I'm really sorry. I shouldn’t have run off, sir.”
With a glance at the other Dom and the only sub in the room, John stood immediately and went to the flat door.
Mycroft couldn't help the eye roll that he gave at that and Irene noticed it. "I don't want to see that,” she complained. “I need a blindfold for him."
The guard shifted the position of the gun to point directly at the detective and he went still, but he still wore a sneer on his face. "Leave me up here, don't pick on Mycroft!"
It wasn't until their number was called out and Greg came back with the food that he did speak. "I'm sorry, sir."
“Now your turn,” John demanded sharply.
Sherlock watched the open door, confused.
"Be quiet Sherlock! Do you really think you have a say in things at this moment in time?"
John hugged him. "Absolutely not. You have reason to celebrate. You stood up for yourself against a woman who hurt you and now she's going to pay the price for what she's done. I'm proud of you. We all are."
At the look on Sherlock's face, Mycroft almost lost it. He was suddenly much happier with Greg's choice of clothing for him.
Both Greg and Mycroft nodded at that. Sherlock had been so convinced that he had to go life alone for so long, it seemed he didn't realise how many people truly cared about him. John was right, he needed to understand that for his own good.
“I’m sorry, sir.”
Sherlock froze at the door, trying to decide whether to turn around or not.
Greg reached out and snagged Mycroft’s hand, giving it a squeeze. He knew his boyfriend was just as moved as he was, even if Mycroft didn’t show it.
Irene ran a hand along Mycroft's side, then smoothed it over his stomach. "For a man, your body definitely looks good, almost as good as Sherlock's. It's time to put it to work."
Mycroft knew that was aimed at him as well as the doctor. “No, sir. Sorry, sir.”
"You did? That's nice," Sherlock returned his attention to the laptop he was currently typing on with one hand.
Some of this chapter's idea's came from a comment from ThatWeirdFangirl although not identical, and split in half the idea comes from them, so thank you!
He had taken it surprisingly well, remembering to count off individually each stroke as it had landed. They had proceeded to cuddle for the remainder of the evening, the sub curled up on his lap sipping tea whenever John brought the cup near him.
"Yes, sir." Mycroft leaned over and rested his head on Greg's shoulder.
“I do?”
Sherlock barely contained the rolling of his eyes, well aware John planned every scene in excruciating detail.
“I know.”
“Well it bloody well would be if you untied me,” Sherlock countered immediately.
She glanced at the phone which had started ringing again. For the third time in under a minute. “Is it about to get worse?”
"But-"
"And?" She inclined her head, tightening her grip on Mycroft's throat.
He heard a soft chuckle as he went back into the flat and was faced by Sherlock’s landlady.
"Yes, sir. Thank you, sir."
"No. I said I wanted them to rest."
“You can take him upstairs again if you like?” The Dom offered softly. They weren’t strangers to his place, after all.
Sherlock’s hands had slowly returned to behind his head as he watched his Dom but John wasn’t content with that, he grabbed both his arms, forced them behind his back and held him that way. “You know, this collar is mine. You may think it yours but it isn't. I gave it to you the day you came to me as a control mechanism but also because of law, you know every sub in a relationship, it doesn't matter what the context, every sub has to wear a collar. But I will not have my subs being rude to me or anyone else outside of my house! I despise it normally, but in public it is worse, far worse. That sort of attitude is inexcusable. It’s worst than coming without permission. Now you know how much you enjoyed that don't you?”
John stretched his finger around the boy’s rim. He actually admired how Sherlock fought himself to keep still.
Sherlock growled. “I do not need to be told how to go to the toilet. And certainly not by you.”
"Was I wrong?" Eurus asked.
The Dom nodded once. “Very well. Just tell a member of the staff if you need to go. I’ll be as quick as I can.” With that he closed the door and stared down at the sub fighting the cuffs.
John brushed his hand through his hair again as he worked feeling back into the younger man’s arms. “Should have calmed down quicker then.” He rolled him over so he was more comfortable. “If you had fought me much longer I think I would have needed to sedate you.”
"Just for the day, or do you want to spend the night?" Sherlock couldn’t imagine that working since Finn still slept with both him and John.
John shook his head with a smirk, "I don't want to wake him up too soon or he'll wake up in brat mode."
“6 hours! But I was-”
For a moment Sherlock thought they were getting in the cop car that Greg had obviously driven, but he was taken passed that just as blue flashing lights came flying into the car park.
Before Sherlock could complain anymore the screen that was on the console spun around in front of him, reams of data or it.
"Alright?" John asked after a moment.
John set about cleaning up the playroom, picking up things and rearranging the furniture and the shelves, the whole time he kept an eye on his kneeling submissive. He was trying to get into the stubborn sod's mind, but he was failing. Sherlock was too well guarded at the moment. That 50 feet tall wall protecting his head would drop eventually, John just knew he'd have to wear it down with what was looking like trust and acceptance. Just because that was the plan at the moment didn't mean John would not enforce his new rules, nor follow through with the methods of discipline Sherlock was aware of. And he was clearly aware as the boy didn't move. He certainly didn't reach for his dick again, but whether that was through obedience or just knowing he stood no chance, John couldn't guess.
John winked as he got to his feet. He paced to the corner and gripped his kneeling sub by the curls, yanking his head back.
John just watched. He didn't want anything from his brat unless it was subspace. He paced around him for a moment and then began to smack at his arse, jostling the liquid around inside him.
Sherlock bucked again, or at least tried to when the dildo brushed his prostate.
The DI nodded. “Whether he wanted you to come then or whether he knew leaving at that stage was bad I don’t know, but whichever way you look at it that is a massive improvement.”
John walked the short distance to the bedroom and sat on the edge of the bed. He placed a hand on Finn's shoulder and shook him gently. "Come on, wake up."
Sherlock growled and thrashed in the Doms' arms. John reached down and grabbed Sherlock's cock in his fist, or at least the best he could through the cage. That stilled the detective quickly enough, though it didn't do much for his attitude. John attached a leash to the cage and tugged on it. As anticipated, Sherlock's knees buckled.
John played with his nipples, getting them to perk up and peak between his fingers. It was fairly obvious to the kneeling man what was coming next.
The doctor folded his arms and inclined his head questioningly.
She bowed again and retreated.
“4, sir.”
Greg closed his eyes again. “Yes, sir.”
It took a moment but eventually Greg appeared at the window. John waved him down and was incredibly happy that the DI nodded his ascent.
As a Dom Mycroft had privately contracted, John had promised to make sure Sherlock ate as he had been informed that he preferred to play truant when food was concerned, but right now, he still needed to be punished and the best way of punishing the wayward boy was leaving him alone for a while - not too long - he didn’t want it to be like what his previous Doms had done, the door wasn’t locked for the sake of emergencies and Sherlock could say anything and John would be straight there, despite his anger.
“Nothing, sir.”
“You were going to hurt yourself. Or me.”
John frowned. "I don't like caning him."
“Sherlock knows where all the private ones are too. I swear, he used to walk around all the time noting this sort of thing in that Mind Palace of his.”
“My Dom, sir,” he replied cautiously.
“No, I don’t think you realised what you were doing. Did you?”
Eurus' face appeared on the screen as her brothers stopped on their knees.
It was a split second for Mycroft to move and kneel over beside his little brother.
Sherlock nodded mutely, but John didn’t push for a verbal response. The sub was clearly confused enough as it was.
Finn abandoned his job and ran to greet her, hugging her around her knees.
"Pizza it is," John glanced at Greg to check and the DI agreed.
After a moment, Sherlock nodded, if only to get Mycroft away from what he was sure would be a bollocking if he said no to the proposal.
“Don’t say a word,” John ordered, fetching a bottle of water and a straw from the mini fridge.
“Stay.” With that he headed into the kitchen to make himself tea... after he’d locked the flat door.
John left his hand in Greg's hair and pushed his head to his knee. "Shhh," he whispered softly.
“Not going to happen, pet,” John said drawing his attention back to his Dom.

“If you promise to stay in here, I will unleash you and let you unpack. I’ll give you an hour and if you obey with minimal complaint, I will let you have your violin back for an hour. How does that sound?”
John put his hand under the detective's arm pit and pulled him to his feet. Sherlock ignored the pain in his leg and held onto the table when his leg gave out, but John had already turned to pay and when he looked up Irene was watching him, am eyebrow raised.
Sherlock swallowed. "Why what?"
Comments can make an author want to give up writing completely (you know who you are) if you do not like my fics, DO NOT READ THEM, I do not need your negative bollocks nor do I care about it.
“So why didn’t you say?”
The detective looked over his shoulder in surprise at 'please' coming from his brother's mouth.
Irene's actions made Mycroft begin to thrash about again.
With a last glare at the heap on his living room floor, he slid across the carpet on his knees and grabbed Sherlock, tugging his body into him and rocking him gently. “Shh, pet. Shh. It’s alright. He’s stopped. He won’t touch you again.” He was careful not to touch him in too many places. He would need medical treatment, but they would hopefully both benefit from this. John in a way that let him know his sub was safe back in his arms and Sherlock in a way that let him know the attack was over. He just had to convince him it never should have happened in the first place.
When there was no response John shifted his grip so only one of his hands gripped both of his sub’s arms behind his back and he used his now free hand to grip Sherlock’s curls again.
When John caught up with him again his wrists were snapped together in metal cuffs rather than the contract cuffs. Sherlock didn’t know if he preferred them or not, they’d be easier to escape from, but there was the lack of comfort and lack of personal touch.
Content he wasn’t harmed, John pulled Sherlock up to his knees then gave him the order again.

Sherlock smiled up at his brother who was still stood ankle deep. "Why don't you join us, brother-mine?"
Greg grasped his sub by the jaw and tilted his head up so he could look him in the eyes. "You're just as naughty as your brother in your own way."
The DI looked around and then backed through the corridor, beckoning the doctor follow him into a more private area.
“Good boy,” John praised, running his hand through his curls. “Well done for not just going up there. An oversight on my part, I apologise.”
“No!” John barked, his tone was not to be messed with. “You do as you are told, boy! And that you need to learn.”
Sherlock looked rather bewildered.
With that, Eurus shoved her brother back with a thud as he fell off his knees.
When he still refused to move, John bent down, picked him up by the scruff of the neck and dragged him inside the house, slamming the door shut with his foot. At no point did the detective use his feet.
“That's not how it's done, Uncle Myc,” he reached forward and tapped his own counter. “That's how it is done.”
John set off after the detective.
John sighed, realising that to him it seemed like a massive over reaction, but to Sherlock it seemed like his brother was mocking him.
When he climbed into bed, he lay such that he could watch the video feed.
“John-“
With a glance at the younger Dom, Greg ran through to the room Sherlock had just come out of.
“Would you like a drink, Greg? Sherlock was about to put the kettle on again.”
“Can you take your shoe off?”
The look Sherlock gave his brother told him to behave, and it was rather odd being that way round.
John focused on one at a time, tightening it so air was sucked out of the tube, peaking his nipples up inside. He watched as his pet bit his lip at the new sensation.
The DI just laughed. “You think I was wrong to tell him about the baby?” He was watching as the girls were completely out of sight in their hole, just the occasional pile of sand came up and over the edge.
The next thing he knew, the dominatrix had brought a riding crop down across his back.
Finn's chuckle made Sherlock laugh.
have happened in his eyes.
“Always, Sally,” he smiled politely and lifted the tape, he stepped under and then held it up for his Dom.
Sherlock's mouth closed with a snap.
As the old man fell to the floor, Sherlock dropped his pill in shock. No reason to take it now anyway.
“It would be good to have you at all the crime scenes he turns up at.”
Sighing, the doctor pushed his head down.
This is mainly porn! I hope you enjoy the quicker chapter
"But-"
"Again."
“Permanently?”
Next, the Dom gripped Sherlock by the curls at the back of his neck and pushed him forward. A month ago Sherlock would have fought the older man, but right now he wasn’t as bothered not being able to see him anymore.
“Basically a cab that slowed down,” John asked, still trying to catch up with what was going on. Why had they chased it in the first place?
"I don't want to gag you, pet, but I will if I have to. Remain respectful and keep your mouth shut unless I've given you permission to speak."
“No, you're not.” The doctor stood in his three piece suit, his tie loosened through the stress of the last 24 hours. His arms were folded across his chest and his voice was stern, almost dejected.
? Did Sherlock Holmes even have manners? And since when did he get a Dom.
"John, let me take a photo. Please," Greg begged. "I want to show that around at the Yard."
But then John grabbed it. "I'm not too sure he's telling the truth, Greg."
"Later," Greg cut him off.
John’s heart clenched. Sherlock thought he was going to damage it just because he had messed up his opportunity this morning? He hastened to reassure the younger man. “I will not cause any damage to your violin. It is yours. I may have it at the moment, but that does not give me the right to destroy your property and especially something so precious. Even more so, the fact that the contract between us is only 3 months does not give me the right to do any damage to it. The same goes for your microscope.”
John used his hand in Sherlock’s hair to pull him back to his knees. The boy groaned as his position was shifted and so was the hook. The Dom moved backwards and it was only when his arse was tugged that he realised John had tied something to the external end of the hook in his arse.
"But-"
As he spun in the air, the government official heard the snick as John opened a tube of lube. Soon, he felt the smooth press of a plug against his hole. John was insistent but slow. He pressed and pressed as it slowly crept passed his sphincter and settled inside him. Mycroft expected it to begin to vibrate but it didn't. He wasn't certain if that was a good or bad thing. It was frustrating either way.
"Oi!" John smacked Sherlock on the arse. "None of that." He didn't trust his boy at all, so he fetched a padded blindfold and fitted it in place over his pet's eyes.
He reached out and snagged his sub by the wrist. “Get rid of those pants, pet.”

“Watch me,” he growled.
Sherlock caught sight of the window where he'd escaped from all those weeks ago. John now had it bolted and completely Sherlock proof. It made the detective huff. The doctor hadn't touched it after Sherlock's escape, he'd understood why he'd gotten out and accepted that he hadn't actually run off and had no need to further block that escape, it seemed now he did.
Soon enough, Sherlock was panting out “20, sir,” and burying his head into the sheets of the bed.
"Which one? They're both morons."
"You should have chosen me, Sherlock." She went to the chest and came back with a posture collar and karabiner. She buckled it around his neck and attached it to the cross, keeping his head back and upright.
"Pizza sound good, little brother?" Mycroft prompted, clearly deducing what he'd decided but was just too... Quiet to vocalise. The younger Holmes just nodded.
"I'm not callling you a child, boy. But the brain chemistry of submissives is similar to that of one. I fear I was too gentle with you. I initially started to get harder as this progressed and then it had been so easy to become lenient as you'd learnt to behave and because of that, you lashed out by running away. As you haven't explained why you ran, nor seem to want to I am making the assumption that you need more of my full on attention."
As soon as they were within range, Sherlock tried to radio for information about their family only to find the radio had been sabotaged.
“How you doing, Sherlock?” Greg asked.
"Good boy," John reached over and smoothed Mycroft's hair.
"It wasn't sugar cubes and caffeine tablets." John swatted him with the riding crop again. He couldn't believe Sherlock was still struggling. The pepper enema had to be driving him mad by now. He walked around and crouched in front of his boy. "If you want that plug out, you're going to have to do better than that."
Sherlock couldn’t help himself, he burst out laughing. “You give the pearl to ladies. The shell is pointless.”
"It's pointless trying to run from it. It keeps appearing."
The boy's eyes widened. “What?”
“Well, sir, if it was a friend, you would have no doubt mentioned it earlier as you would have been looking forward to the visit. You’re also pacing, sir, like you’re nervous.”
Greg, alarmed, grasped his friend by the wrists and stopped him from hurting himself. “You've got to calm down and look at this logically. He loves you.”
Sherlock chased the cup as it was withdrawn from his lips. "John! No fair." He stamped his feet in a frenzy. "I'm thirsty."
"At least you will have tried!"
The guard snarled at him and grabbed him by his cuffed wrists.
"If you boys behave, we can go for a walk on the beach later," John promised. He knew Sherlock loved walking along the shore, he could only guess that Mycroft did as well.
Before Mycroft could respond, he was pulled to his feet, uncuffed and thrown against one of the crosses. Soon they had both been stripped of their clothes and strapped to it, hand and foot. Sherlock received the same treatment, then the guards left.
"That will do." Irene flicked the parachute again. Next she fetched some weights and returned to Sherlock. She added them to the parachute one by one, watching as his face screwed up in further discomfort. "Thank me."
“Your safe word still stands, pet.”
“I don’t think he is.”
As John lay down the third strike there was some kind of pleasing satisfaction from the already positive response from the sub, he usually fought a lot more but this time he was fighting it, hard.
The screen went black and after a moment the youngest Holmes came in through the side door.
As they got closer, the doctor dropped his fists to his hips. "Look at the two of you. You're both completely covered in sand."
Sherlock snorted, watching John. He didn't quite know what to say. “We aren't even engaged.”
Irene kept hitting Sherlock, ignoring the other woman.
"But that's not what you said, sir," the detective said puzzled.
It was just in time because Finn and Sherlock returned to the table and sat down. The little boy had decided to get eggs after all. He was happy sitting on a booster between John and the detective. He felt almost as tall as John.
He pushed the cushion underneath him and told him to kneel again.
He could see the internal war occurring inside his sub like it was a map laid out in front of him. He decided to make it a bit easier by gently tugging, this time Sherlock didn’t fight and slowly moved his head over onto John’s lap.
"Come here," Greg ordered, holding his hand out.
"Sherlock, you dont-" John cut off when Sherlock just bowed his head, he hated these establishments as much as Sherlock clearly did. At least with a club or a bar there was mutual consent at the public display of submissiveness that Sherlock still hated. "You may talk to Kate, if you wish."
Careful to follow his Dom's orders exactly, Mycroft took a sip of his own tea, then handed Greg his. He went ahead and drank the rest in case his Dom had further orders for him.
The Superintendent led John through to where their main room was to dump their bags. They took a while so when they came out were surprised to see Sherlock trying to get some friction to his cock through the cage bars.
“He’s fine. Just mad.”
“How would you know? You know nothing. Now go home, Mycroft, I am busy.”
Mycroft glanced away from his Dom.
Oblivious to the elder Holmes' thoughts, John started feeding his boy. He managed to get the entirety of the waffle into him.

Sherlock hurried to the bedroom and got rid of his clothes. He didn't just ditch them on the bed, he folded them and left them on the chair, then hurried back to the doctor.
"Nothing," the Dominatrix shook her head. "Nothing at all." Irene turned abruptly to hide her discomfort and selected a riding crop from the chest. When she turned around she had a smile on her face. "I simply thought I should take this up a notch."
“Sir?”
The sub followed him through to the sitting room. “Can I get you a drink?”
"But-"
“Oh yes, usually headfirst into danger.”
The sub moaned something inaudible in response and John sighed. He had never seen a sub this affected by these sorts of events, but then again he had never seen a sub quite like Sherlock before; unique in every way and only a sub because there were three categories: Dom, switch or sub, there wasn’t a range of choices.
“Get up off your knees. You don't deserve to kneel for me.”
"Mycroft, go and check on John."
"Maybe he gets off on punishment."
“That's the fourth time you've failed to address me correctly, Sherlock,” John replied, choosing not to respond to the question and offer a reprimand instead.
They smarted like mad, made worse when John pointed at the floor. "Knees."
"You don't know what he wants!"
The other Dom folded his arms, looking thoroughly displeased. Donovan also seemed to tense. “What seems to be the problem?”
“Now, Sherlock!”
"2, sir."
Mycroft let his head fall back against the cross. This was all they needed, their little sister and Irene becoming best friends, pals, mates. He looked over at his brother, hoping to see Sherlock pulling a Houdini.
Eventually the boy had decided he wanted to be alone and, seeing as John had not given him an order that would counteract him being alone, he expected him to just wander off. But rather than doing just that and leaving to go to his room, he came over and knelt on the floor beside his Dom. He leant against his leg in the normal comfort seeking position. It was the first time he had ever done it out of choice. He’d stayed there a few minutes and then asked permission to go.
“Greg, you fucking moron. How is she still working here?” John thrashed, but it was half hearted. He knew he wasn't getting out of the cuffs.
Sherlock glared at him and the was answer enough.
"Go away," Mycroft moaned from where he had slid down the bed.
"Irene. Good to see you," John said, squeezing Sherlock's hand. He could sense how tense his sub had become beside him. "We've just finished a case of Sherlock's."
Eurus stared at Irene, long enough to make the older woman uncomfortable.
Part of him wished John was with him to see this, but he knew his fiance never would have let him get near the box, let alone enter it. He thought it would be good to show the doctor that he didn't just grab anything he saw. Had Mycroft been in here?
Sherlock climbed up on it awkwardly, head low. “Thank you, sir.”
Mycroft instantly began thrashing again, tugging and pulling at the straps holding him on the cross.
"Oh we were. But this one refused to carry on without knowing what was going on in here." He sounded annoyed. At Mycroft in general but at the fact he had overestimated his behaviour.
"You will never find me subbing. Did far too much of that in the army. Get back on your knees."
Sherlock shifted immediately to do as he was told and John just sighed. "Time."
“But, sir!” Sherlock complained, trying to force his cock through John's hand that had stopped stroking.
John took his hand. “Don’t you dare go into Panic, pet, there is no need.” Mycroft moved out the way, so the Dom slipped from the sofa and crouched in front of Sherlock, taking his other hand as well.
“Now why don’t you pour us all a cup of tea?”
Donovan backed away from the slightly cowering sub on sight of her boss. “Lestrade, I-”
He didn't move when John straightened up, he didn't even let his hands waver.
It happened about 10 minutes later. Sherlock had pulled a stool over and was stood on it, his hard leaking prick rammed into John's mouth.
Each drop of the paddle blew fire through his arse, made worse by the fact he'd had nearly a dozen that hadn't counted. That had been wasted. He would be done by now if he had gotten his priorities right.
The man who had climbed in couldn't help himself, he reached up and rested his hand at the nape of the Irishman's neck.
"Yes, Mycroft. Where are we?"
There was a knock on the door and out of reflex Sherlock snuggled into his Dom. John smiled at the top of his head. He couldn’t believe how far the younger man had come in a week. “Come in,” he called softly as not to startle his sub.
They cuddled for another hour or so before John slid out from beneath him. At his sub’s worried look, he hastened to reassure him, “It will not be as bad as you are imagining. I promise you, pet. You have blindfolds on your ‘no’ list, I should have known not to hide from you, so turn over and take hold of the headboard. We’ll do this with you facing me.”
“Just think about it. You've both been amazing with Finn. Sherlock’s been amazing.”

“But sir-”
"Not much. Trauma was interesting. But I was a GP before I started doing this full time." He reached out and ran his hand through his kneeling sub's curls. "Somewhat less drama at a local surgery. Much more boring." John sipped his coffee while watching his boy. He was knelt as perfect as he'd ever seen him.
John just laughed. "Don't worry, boy, it isn't going anywhere." He tapped at the base with his fingers, drumming out a pattern.
Finn took it and hugged it to his chest.
Mycroft watched him carefully, slightly surprised at such a question from his little brother, the one who hated Doms, period.
"And?" Mycroft was frowning in confusion.
Sherlock's gaze darted straight to the camera. “Mycie...” he closed his eyes, he had to say goodbye, didn't he? If this was it, it couldn't be for nothing. “Tell John... tell him that I....” that time he sighed heavily. “He knows. And you,” he glanced towards Moriarty who was wearing a manic grin, the gun held loosely in his hand. “Mycroft, you aren't the-”
Greg looked towards one of the monitors. "I think mine may be stirring. I'd better check." He slipped out of the room without a backward glance, but called out, "Yell if you need me, John."
"I seemed to have understood you that time." He cupped Sherlock's cheek and tipped his back to look at him. "You are getting better," John informed him. "You're learning again, it's a shame I have to tie you up like this to make it happen."
“Oh, yes, Mrs. Hudson, if that is okay? I live a way out of the city and he needs to be here for this case.”
John let his paddle fall through the air. It was the one with holes in.
“Of course.”
The doctor took his sub to the nearest door. "You'll find this room is the only 'normal' one." He pushed the door open and shoved Sherlock's head through.
Sherlock was staying as still as possible, or rather, as still as the fucking machine going in and out of his arse would keep him.
Greg nodded once. “Of course, mate.”
John ignored his attitude for the moment. “Are you following any leads?”
If John didn't know any better he would have said he heard a contented sigh from the kneeling man. He took a seat and ran his hands through Sherlock's hair again.
"Stop that!" John barked, swatting his boy on the thigh. "Don't make this worse than it already is. Grab a posture collar while you're gone!" John yelled after the retreating government official.
The guard flinched, then set to work. He checked his stance and began cropping Mycroft, starting at his shoulders and moving downwards.
And Greg plucked the giggling boy from thin air. He was far too light for his age. "Would you like to meet my daughters this weekend? They're dying to meet you." He glanced at John. "Of course, we'll have to get John and Sherlock’s permission." Both he and Mycroft thought the couple could use some time to themselves during all of the inevitable chaos that was about to ensue.
Irene was breathing so hard that her chest heaved. "On your knees, Mycroft." She took a step towards him, but she had lost all power of intimidation she had ever had.
John reached out and grabbed his hair.
Mycroft took a deep breath and then dropped his head. "I'm sorry, sir."
"You cuffed down there as well?"
Sherlock tried bouncing him, but Finn only held on tighter. The detective lay the little boy across his lap and started tickling him.
The sub shook his head, not answering. His top teeth had snuck out and sucked in his bottom lip.
Mycroft, who had paused at the door once again, couldn't help but snigger.
The passenger nodded, looking around in confusion. “Sorry. Are you guys the police?”
Greg had his head tilted on one side, watching as events unfolded. His fingers fell from Mycroft's mouth. The sub took it as his cue to latch onto the Superintendent's cock, startling him in the best way.
John caught his husband by the arm and pulled him close. “You really are a magnificent father, you know that?”

"Ow!" Mycroft said with a cheeky grin, though he did nothing to protect his arse from further blows. "You brought me coffee, sir. Thank you." He started to reach for the nearest mug, but the Superintendent grasped him by the wrist and spun him over.
“You are going to pay for your insubordination, Sherlock. Do you hear me? I don’t care what set this little temper tantrum off. Ill calm you down, punish you, and then we can go and enjoy a nice conversation with your brother without this brattish behaviour. Are we clear on that?”
The Superintendent let out a deep sigh of contentment. He did get tired of being the Dom all the time, no matter how much he treasured his time with Mycroft or even Sherlock. He needed this, briefly, to recharge. "Do you get bored of this?"
“Why not?" He growled, kicking out at the wall.
"It's not a limit, sir."
"Does that mean you'll need to check in with her while we're gone?" John asked.
"Sherlock," Mycroft whispered. Then he repeated himself louder. "Little brother, wake up!"
After a few moments Siger stepped in and at that Mrs. Holmes went completely white.
The government official looked down at his brother, his eyes still full of mirth.
At that, the detective let out a small smile, digging into the Hawaiian that was now on his lap. He could handle pineapple on pizza. He couldn't handle mushrooms.
Sherlock ducked his head. He knew he hadn't deserved an orgasm, as frustrating as that was. "No, sir."
The little boy didn’t seem convinced. He tried to get down, out of Sherlock’s grip. All he wanted to do was run away and hide.
He turned.
"What's the problem?" Eurus asked, letting go of her kneeling brother.
"Yes, sir," Sherlock said hurriedly.
“He might be against the contract, Greg. This could be it.”
"You couldn't Dom me even if you wanted to. Your head isn't anywhere near in the right place for it."
The younger man laughed out loud. “Actually, sir,” he called down to him. “I’m more than glad.”
Greg's girls were anything but shy. Beth and Amy pulled him along by the hands, calling for 'Mycie' to hurry up.
Greg followed him, stopping only long enough to pet Mycroft on the hair and order him to follow. When they got to the other room, John had already started selecting the rope he was going to use. He bound Sherlock's arms behind his back, joining his wrists to the collar, then he attached the winch to his wrists and began to pull him up. It left Sherlock somewhat upright, but bent over with his legs uncomfortably spread.
Knowing there wasn't anything he could do, even if he wasn't trussed up like a turkey, Sherlock closed his eyes.
John looked between them at the batter that was now full of chocolate chips and laughed. “I can see already that you two make quite the pair. Where did you get them from, Sherlock?”
Once the detective had reached the corner, he knelt up straight and put his hands behind his head.
“You earn the right to be called pet and in return you kneel more comfortably.” He used this system a lot. He was sure it would work with Sherlock like it had with so many people before.
“I suppose he likes the fact I help on cases,” the sub’s voice was distant in thought.
"Sherlock?"
Eurus stopped laughing. "I don't care about speed. I want to own them." She looked deeply into Mycroft's eyes. "This one, I want to make pay for leaving me here."
