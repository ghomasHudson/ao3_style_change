Dean's actual birthday is on a Thursday and no one is more disappointed than Victor to find out Dean's not having a party. “Dude, I had this whole plan to play spin the bottle.”
part of her to notice how much his dad is drinking.
The road crews clear up the snow and what's left all but melts the next day, which means school isn't canceled. Missouri makes her wear a turtle neck, a sweater, a coat, as well as a pair of thick pants and her puffy gloves, hat and scarf. By the time she and Gabriel walk to the bus stop, she's boiling up.
“Deal.”
“You can't shoot a cat, Dean,” Cas glowers, pointing her finger at him,
Victor shrugs, “Whatever. I was just being nice.”
She glares at him. “Stop asking stupid questions and pay attention.”
“Oh I'm sure she'll dump him and go for you if you ask,” Castiel tells him and Dean has to do a double take because what the hell is she doing giving him advice about girls like it's
“Yes,” Mary says, taking out the overcooked casserole, “You know what, screw it, let's go out for Chinese.”
“Oh hey!” Michael claps his hands, “Open my present next,” he trades her his wrapped box for the Superman movie, hands it to Gabriel who hands it to Raphael who hides it out of sight while Cas opens her gift. It's a Scarecrow action figure and judging by the way she jumps up and throws her arms around Michael's waist, she loves it. Then she sits back down finishes opening up the rest of her presents.
“Superman”?” she asks, holding the video up, glaring at the room.
did!" He shouts, dropping the bike in frustration.
Opening the bag, Dean shoots Gabriel a look. “You want to beat up someone because he stole your candy?”
“No, mom,” Dean sighs. “It's nothing.”
Dean looks his father dead in the eye. "I was kamikazeed."
As soon as she drops to the ground, Cas stills, sure that Missouri is going to open the door and shout at Cas to come inside. She counts to five and then takes off running.
“If I wanted to kill you, I would have done it a long time ago,” Castiel says, seriously. “No, I wanted you on my team because I thought I was okay with being a loser, but I'm not. I'm tired of losing everything important to me and that includes you.”
Castiel smiles broadly as Dean gives her a grape ring pop from his bag. “Thank you, Dean,” she says, taking his hand in hers. He stares at her hand for a minute before shrugging and squeezing it back.
The pig is heavy but he can still hear the clang of coins inside, so it‟s not completely full. Still, he's surprised she's just giving it to him.
John stands behind Dean while he nervously rings the door bell. The door swings open and a young, skinny black boy answers. He's an inch or two taller than Dean, but Dean figures he has more weight on him so he can probably take him in a fight. He's obviously older than Dean though by at least three years if Dean has to guess, so this may be an issue.
She sighs, rolling her eyes up at the night sky. “
This time, she does look at him, “I told you, Dean. Kissing is what married people do!”
This time Dean's strangely appeased, because at least he knows how long he's in for. Besides, he can think of worse girls to be married to, like Lilith. “Oh, okay. Wanna play Ghostbusters after this?”
“You're going to get into trouble.”
Twenty minutes later Dean's sitting on the couch trying to watch TV with his parents when the doorbell rings. He jumps up, rushing to the door.
Dean closes his locker and turns to Cas, but he doesn't see Cas, class nerd, he sees
Dean's thirteen when puberty hits him in the worst way possible. There's the growth spurt, the hair in new and exciting places, sweating, pimples, and best of all, the constant erections. It's during this time when he gets his first girlfriend Andrea Creston. She's funny and popular and she smells like apples when she kisses him for the first time. He still sits next to Cas in class though, even though he scoots his desk over so he's not sitting right next to her, because she's the class dork. Almost everyone teases Cas, especially the girls Dean's so desperately trying to impress.
Quick Happy Birthday to Sam Winchester!
Dean was seriously regretting telling Sam about his crush when the angel had died, he folded his arms over his chest "How would I even do it?" He asked shyly, Sam smirked leaning back in his chair "All you have to do is ask him out and I'll take care of the rest"
"Cas?..Castiel?"
Gabriel laughed, "Nah, Cassie can talk your ear off about almost any topic."
"Cas is a fucking saint he will not care if you don't go all out on your first ever date!" She exclaimed frustratedly after having to sit and critique Dean's outfits for nearly an hour "Dean you're just being ridiculous you look good."
"Yes, I am." Castiel said with confidence "Oh and- no suits necessary."
Castiel blushed at the sudden complement, "Thank you."
"Oh god you didn't go get some girl pregnant did you?" His mom asked and Dean chuckled a little "No nothing like that trust me"
"We can't really do anything can we?- in public?- go on an actual date?" It sucked because if they stepped out together holding hands after a date cameras would be there and the next day it'd be plastered over every new paper and on every celebrity tabloid site. Then it'd be interviews, questions- scandals, that would lead to them ending it. Dean knew that all too well.
"Anything?"
Dean put down the bottle with a sigh, it was quiet, his eyes focused on the lake as he watched the water trying not to read too much into the warm feeling in his chest "Thank you."
"I'm not stalking you or anything I just like coming out here."
"Do I?"
"Gabriel-"
"Hey Anna." He greeted the girl he was obviously familiar with "Sorry about that school has taken up a lot of my time so I've been ordering a lot of take out."
"You won't," Dean looked him in the eye "I can take it." Cas stared at Dean for a few more seconds, looking for any hints of doubt or hesitation but when he found none he pulled his fingers out and rolled the condom over his cock, he lubed his hand up and generously coated his dick with it, wanting to make the penetration easy for Dean. Using a hand he guided himself to Dean's hole pushing a little harder to get past the rim he watched Dean's lips turn into an 'O' and his eyes shut tight but with no ask to stop or slow down he didn't. Watching as he tore Dean open moaning softly at the tight heat clamped around him, pulling him in- "Stop" Dean breathed, letting his eyes open, he looked down to see he had only taken a little over half of Castiel and had more to go. Dean put his head back in the pillows, "Gimme a minute"
Sam chuckled awkwardly, he had been very adamant about that, "Yeah..that was for Gabriel, I didn't want to keep him a secret."
was with Madison when I was a junior but it was with Gabriel..we'd just met and I was already head over heels so one night about six months after I let myself go just for that night and.." His smile grew "God I'll never forget it." Sam had been saving himself for that special someone ever since he learned about sex and Dean knew that but hearing that it was Gabriel?- he'd joked about it in the past but dang.
"Yeah, exactly.."
"Oh right!-this is my tall, smart and handsome fiance Sammy." Gabriel grinned proudly, obviously he didn't marry Sam for his looks but it sure did make people jealous "He's
"What?- why areyou staring at me like that?" An awkward smile appeared on her face as she chuckled nervously.
He hoped off of the expensive marble of Castiel's counter and made his way to the large sitting area, jumping to sit down on the sofa and drown more of his sorrows in gummy bears
"Is it because of me?"
Castiel chuckled, "Of course they can." Gabriel smiled briefly, "How are you feeling?" He asked straightening out the bowtie "A little nervous..a lot excited"
"It's delicious."
Dean's hands gripped the side of the pool, "I'm not sensitive and I don't want anything." He pushed himself back in the water and Castiel stayed at the side, just watching Dean swim to the middle of the pool, at only eighteen Dean was quite good in the water, especially with his speed and technique, no wonder he was Captain. "I've never kissed anyone before."
Man it was a beautiful day, Dean was laying on a long poolchair just after a swim in the pool before him with a beer in hand, wearing black sunglasses over his eyes as he stared up at the sky, damn was it a great day. The sun shone over him in his blue pool shorts and he sighed happily taking a long sip of his beer. "Dean- Dean are you even listening to me?"
Dean hadn't been manhandled like this in a long while and he was quickly remembering how much he missed it, being
Dean knocked on Sam's door; it was finally time, he decided to deal with his confusing ass feelings for Cas but he knew he needed help to do it so who better than his own brother
Cas silenced him with a kiss though weak "Don't be, just stay with me?" Dean nodded "Okay, yeah.."
"I don't know what the problem?- I've known him since college and he's always been supportive of Gabriel's and my sexuality." He said, thinking of how Sam had hurt his brother by being so deep in denial. Dean nodded "Same here, but maybe he'll come around."
." Dean scoffed "I'm pretty sure
- not
Dean just smiled and kissed Cas again forgetting the world to focus on the perfect boy before him
Dean was making the first move?- Dean
All those times he and Gabriel had sex he never once let Gabriel take him, always being the one on top, the one in control- it'd been the same with all the girls he'd slept with- just because Gabriel's dick was there everytime they did it didn't mean anything. Sam huffed and tossed his phone away back onto the bed, he changed out of his towel and into some sweats with a loose shirt, he found Jess in the kitchen and he smiled, surprising her by coming up behind her at the stove, wrapping his hands around her waist "Hey."
"..Amazing."
"You're being serious?"
Dean grabbed Cas' face "No- no- no" He found tears start to prickle at his eyes "Cas you can't die on me..I'm sorry" He sighed "I'm sorry about that stupid fight we had before, I hate when we fight I just..I know you can take care of yourself" He rested his forehead against Cas', ignoring Sam behind them "Cas..I love you- more than an friend and I know if you could talk you'd be calling me an idiot for not saying anything which I am but I'm saying something now- granted you're unconscious but I do love you"
"You're still wearing clothes"
Dean rolled his eyes "Cas I've always known, I just hid it because I didn't want this to happen"
"She is, I just haven't dated in a while so you kind of surprised her."
He also wore a large biflag and a sort of cape and had the same flag painted on his cheek as well as bisexual flag bandana..he looked
"You don't care about those." Dean always ignored whenever his father insulted him, calling him a 'worthless fag' etc they were just words and his father didn't matter anymore so they didn't hurt. Castiel repeated "What did he say?"
"Shut up"
Cas groaned "Just admit it!- you're ashamed of our kiss Dean- that you kissed a man"
Damn, his boyfriend was breathtaking, Dean had obviously never seen Castiel naked so this was very new for him but shit..Castiel really was an angel- a beautiful
"Why not?" Castiel asked pushing himself into the water to lean against the wall of the pool, "Because I'm thirty and single." He joked, "And that's bad..?"
"Maybe but I've taken that into account."
"You ready?"
"Huh" Was all Dean said "Just promise me one thing" He sounded weirdly serious, Cas nodded almost immediately "Yeah of course what?"
Sam moaned loudly as he climaxed, spilling into the condom, Jess clamped down on him and screamed as he thrusted hard for the last time making her come, riding out their highs until Sam pulled out and stood up, discarding of the condom, Jess frowned at him, obviously expecting cuddles. "What?-where are you going?"
Sam paused- they'd only dated for a few weeks- it took so long for him to break up with her because his parents loved her so much but him?- not so much
"What?"
She shrugged, "I have friends."  Dean nodded "Fine- now keys." He put his hand out and she placed keys in his palm "Just lock up when your done- and please don't have sex in here, my mom would kill me, she's still mad for that stunt you pulled at Christmas."
"Huh?" Castiel blinked, "Oh- it was just one class project in school, we hung out one time twelve years ago."
A lot of his teammates had been okay with it aside from the whole
"Can I come in?"
"Good to know"
"There's nothing to talk about Sam."
"If you could change one thing from our past, what would it be?"
Castiel hated Dean's life almost as much as Dean did and he was scared that one day Dean's father would come home and beat on him so much come next day Dean would be dead. That man had so much hate and anger in him for years, grieving is hard to do but turning your anger on your children wasn't even an option.
Gabriel hung up and threw his phone down on the table, immediately bringing his knees to his chest and sobbing uncontrollably
Dean watched him kiss down his chest and abdomen with an abnormal amount of infatuation for the man, "Things.." Dean's lips parted in a surprised 'O' shape when Castiel kissed the head of his dick, "First."
"Your room is upstairs second door on the left." Gabriel told him, "I'll go with you."
Dean was drunk, he'd went to grab
"No it's fine, I want to move out okay?"
Dean flushed "Well um..I've kinda had a crush on you too but I didn't think you'd ever be interested" He admitted "You're like wayyy outta my league Cas"
" He ran a hand over his face, only Sam knew and he'd sworn his brother to secrecy "I've dated other people of course but that one stings."
He had the pool all to himself, doing slow laps across the water, enjoying his alone time before his parents were to arrive and ruin it with their excessive questions and judgments. Dean was finishing his fourth lap when he'd reached the end of the pool and he came up for air, having to do a double take when he saw Castiel sat in green swim trunks on the side of the pool, water almost up to his knees as he watched Dean intensely. "Oh, hey."
He turned to Dean with pleading eyes but his friend just shrugged at him 'what's a little kiss?' Dean had said, '
Castiel grinned, happy that they were both satisfied and they shared a kiss "I can't wait then"
he owns a very nice restaurant in Upper Manhatten, I could get him to reserve the place for us tonight."
"I'm getting married Dean!- that's what wrong!- I thought I was ready for this,
The chatted more about themselves until the milkshakes were finished and the fries were eaten- the milkshakes of which were
"Apparently I've been..
They'd met his first day in the diner and overtime became friends even when he wasn't in the diner, now whenever he came in she always waited on him and they spent a good ten minutes chatting a joking around before he gave his order.
"Would you like to go on a date?- a real date?- it can be as fancy or as casual as you want, I just want to give us a try."
was just using him, leaving him sore and heartbroken in the morning
"There were times when I was younger I actually believed he would change, he'd get sober and stay that way for two weeks
“Don't kiss her,” Duanne warns, “You'll get cooties!” He takes Dean's hand and starts drawing two overlapping circles with his finger nails, all the while saying the magic words, “Circle, circle, dot dot now you have your cootie shot.” Dean sighs, relieved. He's safe now from girl germs.
“Call my sister a freak again and I'll make you regret it! Come on Casafras!”
Remember last year when you caught pneumonia?”
“I never thought about it that way,” Chuck admits. “Wait, are you saying David's gay?”
Well if she's not going to eat them, he might as well. “Okay,” he reaches over her and takes the boxes of cinnamon hearts. “What about the cards?”
Dean doesn't know what to say to that. “You…are?”
Okay then, Dean thinks, jumping off the couch to get away before she makes him dance with her. This is good information to know.
“Was it from you or Victor?” Castiel asks, and Dean shakes his head. “Then no, I don't care.”
“John!”
Dean's actually impressed Anna and Balthazar can keep up.
“So uh, what did you do this summer?” Dean asks, putting his feet in the desk in front of him.
Dean laughs, “Sure, whatever Simon will know the future.”
John shakes his head. “Sorry, son, but you're gonna have to give it back.”
She'll admit, she loves when he gets protective over her. But alas, she isn't going to lie to Dean just so Gabriel can give the bully his comeuppance for something he didn't even do. “No.”
Awhile later they were sitting on the sofa, watching the Turtles fight Shredder's horde when Castiel pecks him on the cheek. Once again, the flutters in Dean's stomach appear, this time not going away as she cheers the Turtles on.
“CASTIEL!” Gabriel shouts. “GET UP.”
“We need to talk, Dean.”
Three hours into it though, he really regrets his decision.
“Michael, honey, have you taken out of the trash yet?” a sweet sounding woman asks, coming in from the sliding glass door leading out to the back yard. Seeing John, she stops and smiles.
but that lead to a whole why doesn't Cas come over anymore debate and so, Dean decides to pick his battles. “Whatever, but if she does anything skeevy I'm kicking her out.”
,” Dean shakes his head, “You weren‟t.” He goes to walk away when he hears Victor calling him, asking if they're going to hang out that afternoon. The thought just doesn't interest him. He'd rather work on the comic with Chuck. “No,” he calls back.
Because it's gym class, they have to go outside again, only this time Castiel can't play due to her arm. Dean expects her to read while everyone else plays, but she watches the game with rapt attention.
“Not the way we play, Anna,” Michael assures her. “Now are you sure you want to play? We play with an actual baseball, not a soft ball.”
“You're the one who wanted to play the dad,” Castiel reasons with a shrug.
The foster mother snatches Cas' sled away from her. “I said no.”
"You, miss, are staying here.”
Castiel ignores him for the entire time she's next to him. Dean shrugs it off when she runs to second without even saying hello.
“I see. That is an interesting development,” Castiel says eventually.
Dean tries to bend the handle bars back into shape as she looms behind him. "You broke your bicycle."
“What do you think of my playing?”
“Shut up!” Dean and Castiel yell in unison. Further embarrassed, Dean runs out of the house and jumps into his mom's car as fast as he can.
“Where do you think you're going?” Missouri bellows as soon as Michael opens the door. The four kids still, afraid to move. “I have expressed my feelings about you taking your sister with you on your foolish adventures.
“Here,” Dean puts the piggy bank on the in table. The sooner he gives it back, the sooner he can get out of there. “Can we go now, dad?”
“Oh,” Dean says, not at all comfortable with her answer. “Wait, how long are we gonna be married for?”
Balthazar this, Balthazar that. Dean's sick and tired about always hearing about that guy. “And you say there's nothing going on.”
At first when Dean takes his seat next to Cas he thinks she looks normal, frazzled hair, cardigan sweater.
"Child!"
Meg just grins at Castiel as she takes her seat. “You get any Valentines, Clarence?”
Dean gulps, “Mom, Dad and I already had the talk.” There's no way he's going through that again.
Sure enough, when Cas arrives at their hill, Raphael is flying down the hill so fast his sled isn't even touching the ground, screaming at the top of his lungs. As soon as he reaches the bottom he goes flying off his sled and crashes into a snow bank. Then he stands, putting his fist in the air.
Dean traces the patterns in the wood with his finger. “What if it's uh, someone who used to like you but doesn't anymore?”
“She broke her arm.” It makes it sound like she did it on purpose, and from the look on her face it's obvious she caught his tone too. He shrugs back.
“I don't want to go to the stupid park anyway,” Castiel pouts for a moment before turning to Dean, “I have the latest Batman, would you like to see it?”
“Take off those clothes, you're going to die of the heat.”
"Do you want anything?” he asks, opening his Incredible Hulk backpack up, revealing what's probably more candy then most kids get on Halloween. Cas take a few pieces of candy, some chocolate bars and a grape flavored lollipop for her, some peanut M&M's for Dean and some other miscellaneous candy for the rest of her friends. She puts most of the candy in her own bag, unwrapping the sucker to eat while they wait for the bus to arrive.
The last girl's birthday party Dean went to was Lilith White's and she'd thrown a tantrum about not getting the right colored pony, but there's something about Castiel that makes him think this one will be different, so he says yes.
She turns and looks at the time, “You have to propose. Get down on one knee and ask me to marry you.”
Their games never end until Castiel gets pissed at Michael for something he does and starts yelling in his face. It's comical, watching Castiel yell into the giant's face, hands and hair flying around, completely livid. She's covered in dirt and sweat and her skin is glowing and
,” Dean mutters under his breath.
“Do you want to play house?” Castiel asks. Sam's down for his nap and Dean's mom is on the phone. Victor's grounded and Chuck has a dentist appointment, so it's just them.
They don't talk on the way to Castiel's house except for Dean's instructions on how to get there.
a joke? What if someone actually
“Whatever,” Sam frowns, “He should have powers. Maybe he can read people's minds! Or he knows the future! Oh I like that. Yeah, he knows the future!”
Castiel tosses him the cards and he opens them. The first one has Superman and Lois Lane flying in the sky and on the inside written in Victor's big handwriting is pretty much just what Cas guessed. Dean wonders what the hell his friend is thinking. The second one however, that's the one that concerns him. It's just a simple handmade card out of red construction paper with Castiel's name written on the front in black marker. Dean opens it up to read.
They get in a few more rides before the sun starts to set and it's time to go home. As soon as they walk in the door, Missouri shoos Cas up to the bathroom to take a hot bath and starts in on Michael and Raphael for not bringing her home. Missouri feeds Cas soup that night like she's trying to curb an illness that hasn's happened yet and starts feeling Cas' head every five minutes.
have a problem with questioning authority,” she says, using finger quotes. Their summers together growing up always went like this. Cas goes to Bible camp, Cas gets kicked out, comes home and then they hang out. This last summer was the first one where they spent it apart.
Dean doesn't respond, instead he thinks about his dad's words, trying to think of a valid argument against them. But the only thing he can come up with is he's only fourteen and there's plenty of time.How the hell is his dad so sure Cas is
Dean sighs and sits down in the seat is Dad usually sits in. Mary doesn't sit, but leans against the counter. “Tell me what's wrong.”
Looking back on it Dean knows what he did was stupid because, well,
“Let's do our homework,” she says, moving away from him nervously.
“Do you have any idea what you're doing?” Sam asks as Dean rushes down the stairs to the basement to look for their old Nintendo but is unable to find it amongst all the old boxes of pictures and his parents college text books. There's no way he's going to use one of his new controllers. As it is, there's only one person he can think of who would have a spare.
She's right though, there's no way Dean's parents would ever let them play Spin the Bottle or Truth or Dare or anything that might lead to actual fun, hence why he's going ice fishing instead.
It's Cas who answers, giving Dean his bag of peanut M&M's. “He tried to bully Gabriel into giving him his candy.”
“I regret ever meeting you.”
After they play with Sam, or more accurately Sam gets bored of their arguments and goes to play with his toys, they watch TV. This is the part that's dangerous because one minute they will be sitting on the opposite ends of the couch, and the next they will be side by side, snuggled up beside each other. Dean should protest, kick Cas away, something, but the truth is he kind of likes being close to her. Almost always, they end up curled up side by side, fast asleep while Scooby Doo runs from this week's ghost. Mary puts a blanket over them and snaps a picture for her scrapbook.
Dean's not expecting his father to begin chuckling, but that's exactly what he happens. "I guess that explains the piggy bank,” pointing to the object in Dean's hand. “Did you take that from her?”
the loser here, not
"I thought we talked about this," John Winchester says, wiping his hands off on a dirty rag,
“Uh, Okay.” Is she really going to sit there and take his shit
She's still Castiel though, class nerd. There's no way that's going to change once school starts.
"Fine."
The school year goes on and Victor and Dean make up, just like they always do and things are good, for the most part, Cas continues to wear those stupid clothes and invade his thoughts.
hard,” Castiel says, clearly reading Dean's mind. “You could still be with
“Missouri is going to ground you into the next century,” Michael informs Castiel, but he's putting her on his sled while he says it, so she can tell he's not mad.
“Hello, Dean.” Her eyes narrow as he takes the controller out of her hand, “is there anything else you require?” She's barefoot and has lilac colored toe nails. Dean doesn't know why this affects him, but it does. It's bad enough she's been the number one star of his fantasies lately, does she have to give his brain even more fodder?
I was gay."
"We're. Not. Fucking."
"Of course I'm sure."
Dean swallowed the pills "Nah, Sammy needs me." He sighed, taking the time it took to drive to his apartment to close his eyes and get the pounding in his head to stop.
Dean turned his head fast and Gabriel chuckled at his reaction, "I've got two eyes Dean, it doesn't take a genius to pick up on whatever tension you two got." He paused, "..and I may have just seen you guys kiss on the patio."
Cas frowned at the way Dean's teeth were chattering so he pulled off his trenchcoat wrapping it around Dean who jerked "What are you doing?"
Sam stared down at his fiance, giving him a look "Really Gabriel?" Gabriel shrugged "Relax my Samshine, y'know I love your personality." He stood up on his toes to kiss Sam's pout from his face.
Castiel chuckled pulling the bottle from his lips, he always was able to keep Dean from his bad habits at times, he'd even gotten Dean to quit smoking after telling his boyfriend that he didn't want to taste an ashtray every time they kissed "I'm sorry." He said with mock sincerity.
He let his hands run freely through the softness of the feathers enjoying ever second of it, watching Cas moan under his touch, smiling each time Cas' wings quivered
Dean stood up fast "I did not kiss Cas, he kissed me" He said pointedly to Sam
"Make me bitch."
guy." He swallowed, "He was twenty seven when I met him I was only a sophomore but it got fast quick, the best relationship I've ever been in and I loved him more than anything."
Dean nodded softy "I didn't want it to be like that either" Cas looked up into his eyes "What?"
Dean laughed,
"I don't need to, I have eyes."
"Gabriel Novak speaking"
"Yeah..he died in combat."
Dean's brows jumped, "Work?"
Castiel tore his eyes away and shook his head "No one Balthazar, c'mon I think I saw the face paint stand free."
the words-"
"Dean just-"
Cas nodded almost immediately as they kicked off their shoes and socks and Dean pulled his own shirt over his head tossing it away, their hands cupped each others necks as they kissed, just taking in one another's..everything
He rubbed up against Dean's ass pressing his weight against him, he pulled off Dean's boxers and Cas used a bit of his grace to open Dean up
Dean looked into Cas' pleading eyes and he felt his embarrassment slip away "I'm..I'm not going to Cas, promise" He said "I really am sorry about out fight-"
Castiel rolled his eyes at himself and settled with the fact that he'd call Dean after his breakfast and he went back to brushing his teeth. He showered faster than he'd liked to admit and changed into his usual loungewear which was his favourite pair of black Versace sweatpants and a simple gray tshirt.
The next day they woke tangled in the sheets, sunlight shining over them through the cracks in the barn
Finally Cas tore off the clothes around his arms and the two moved further up the bed, Dean layed on his back watching Cas kiss the tattoo on his chest before he slid down Dean's body, and unbuttoned his jeans pulling them off his legs
Sam nodded awkwardly, keeping a smile from growing on his face "Okay"
Castiel grinned easily "Move to the Bahamas and drink Mai Tai's on a beach,
"Those magazines don't know jack about me, they just assume one thing and the rest of the world believes it"
"You really liked them?" Cas questioned "I mean I have read about your love life-"
"I know..I just..please give me a chance?"
"Gabriel don't be rude, introduce me."
Dean respected Castiel's rule so the second they got their breath back Dean was apologising profusely, but Castiel didn't think it was necessary, though after that they tried to cool down a bit because Castiel really wasn't planning on losing his virginity even at seventeen.
Castiel didn't need an explanation as to why Sam was upset because from what Gabriel told him he already had a good idea "He broke up with Jessica?" That one
. Cas gripped Dean's collar and held it tight as they kissed moving towards the bed until Dean's knees hit the frame and then his blazer was being pushed off his shoulders.
Dean looked up at the angel who was staring down at him and realised that he was laying in Cas' chest "Sorry, did I wake you?" Cas asked quietly "You seemed to like it"
Well it
"And for the record..I put in a transfer last week..I'm moving to Manhattan, to be closer to you." He gave a sheepish smile, "Surprise?"
Castiel sighed, "Fine." He let Gabriel take him upstairs and through the many bedrooms, Castiel paused his eyes grazing over a partly open door and a man who was pulling up his boxers not noticing that Castiel was looking, through the door, but the man quickly tore his eyes away and turned to his brother "Who's staying there?" He asked curiously pointing towards the door, the scene felt eerily familiar to him.
Cas shook his head "Not exactly..I mean no offense but you're no Chris Evans"
"I don't doubt it..not much anyways I've been sneaking around with you so much they're making me ask forgiveness at church."
"Nothing.." He kissed Castiel, "You still want me to..or are you good?" Castiel frowned "You're asking?" They came there to have sex it'd be pretty weird if they didn't have sex.
"So?- are you excited?" Gabriel questioned pulling Castiel from his thoughts "Sure"
Cas smiled "Then we shall take this slow" Dean smiled back "Well then if we're taking this slow then I think we need to go on a date..
But his brother didn't stop "Why did he have to kiss me?" Was all he was mumbling as he headed for his bedroom, luckily Sam caught up with him and they found himself in Dean's bedroom
Breakfast went over quickly (which had
Cas nodded "Yes we should"
Say that again?!
Wrapping his arms around Cas in an almost protective manner, he took in his friends honey sweet lips, moaning softly as they slowed down, kissing more passionately
Gabriel cut him off "But you have
and all."
"Yeah and what's with the slippers?" Gabriel chimed in pointing at the open mouthed dinosaurs on Dean's feet. "They're my happy slippers."
He pulled out of Dean and flipped him over onto his back, jerking himself off over Dean's stomach, "C-cas?" Dean's eyes were slightly wide and he couldn't help but stare
Dean pursed his lips, pressing his fingers to the necklace he wore "..I was twenty four." He clenched his jaw, "It was six years ago and I've dealt with it but hearing my parents talk about him like that it just pissed me off- they had no idea and no
Dean knew first hand what it felt like to be invalidated by bullies and bigots but coming from someone like Cas?- it made him question his own community. All the straight
They rocked perfectly in sync and the fast Dean got the deeper Castiel's nails dug into his back, Dean fucks into Castiel so good and he doesn't stop at all until Cas is crying out that he's about to come and then his thrusts start to speed up until he's buried deep and they're both cumming hard and Dean is just moving lazily to ride out the orgasm until he knew for sure he wasn't gonna come anymore and finally pulled out, but he stayed on top of Castiel's, their foreheads pressed together "How you feeling?"
Dean rolled his eyes and opened the door, he found Sam laying face down on the bed, looking disastrous.."Oh my god, are you dead?"
"Dean I-"
The Novaks quickly scolded the two and Dean was rudely thrown out without any 'book'. Needless to say it was the last time they tried
Dean wanted to do it before he chickened out so he went straight from Sam's room to the library where he knew the angel was playing monopoly with Jack
"He was always busy."
"He's a cop- well FBI now, and between me travelling all the time and him always busy when
Sam and Gabriel knew Dean was right. It was the truth, being bisexual wasn't easy, because most people just weren't accepting, it's not that they didn't understand they just choose not to listen because when they pictured a bisexual person it wasn't someone just loving another person they were interested in (man or woman) it was two guys and a girl having a threeway or two girls and a guy having a threeway, love, feelings and emotion weren't even considered as factors.
"Yes." Castiel answered fitting on his last shoe, Dean smiled at him "Have you been working out?" Castiel rolled his eyes fondly and stood from the bed "C'mon let's go before I change my mind."
Cas looked around and they indeed were parked outside his house "Great" He said already pushing the door open not noticing Dean was doing the same
"Cas..you're giving me a chance, I'll never walk away again, I'm here for as long as you want me around." Castiel smiled shortly, he knew that Dean really mean't it. Every single word he said and he was already planning to have the man around for a long time "Then yes you can kiss me Dean."
Dean blinked "What? No- I need a game plan." Sam laughed at that, "A game plan?- you wanna know what my 'game plan' with Gabriel was when we met?"
"Don't remind me I have to see that dick this weekend."
Dean blushed "In my defence..I thought you were a demon" Cas nodded chuckling "Yeah that makes it better Dean"
Dean could hear Sam's smile over the phone
I heard what he did when Sam first met him, Gabriel was beyond upset." He sighed, "To Lucifer everything is a competition." Castiel swam over to him "What about you Dean?- how has the last twelve years treated you?"
of felt" Dean sighed and he forced himself to look up "..Cas, I felt like I existed and everything..it just fell into place" He leaned back on the table "..I know I love you Cas, I've known for years- and you can hate me for it..but I'm telling you now..and hoping you'll forgive me for being a complete idiot"
"Maybe for you.." He laughed lightly to himself, getting out of his head "Perhaps it just didn't mean nothing to me, but well.."
Dean was nervous about talking to Castiel because yeah he assumed but he really had no idea what Cas was going to say and he didn't like it one bit. He invited Castiel inside when he showed up right on time and offered a drink which Castiel declined.
"Both?" He sighed, "I'll still be a Novak just a
Sam just shrugged, grabbing his boxers, not turning around to look back at her as he put them on "Bathroom." He managed and walked way shutting the door and locking it. He gripped the sink and huffed harshly- fucking
"Okay, I'll be there soon."
Castiel saw Dean's hand slow down an realized he must've been close, and he himself was on the verge so he pulled out until his cock head was threatening to slip from Dean's hole and then he rammed back in, he grinned at the way Dean screamed, both of his hands fisting into the soft sheets, he was clearly shocked at being forced to take all of Castiel in one hard thrust and when Cas looked at Dean's stomach it was being painted with ropes and ropes of come, Dean was just panting nonstop his hips jerking upwards every few seconds waiting for the pleasure to end. The sighed was so arousing that Castiel was coming as well, burying himself deep inside Dean before spilling into the condom.
And Dean found himself being attracted to them
It's nice, holding another person to his body like this- he likes it. But sadly it is very short lived when his ringtone started to to off his eyes widened as he frantically but quietly pulled himself from Castiel's body, rolling off the bed and landing softly on his feet watching Castiel for any movement and when there was non he went back to finding his pants.
Cas nodded and worked his hips slow though making sure he hit Dean's sweet spot reveling in every sound Dean made
redheaded BFF Charlie."
Dean picked his head up as the silence was broken, he didn't believe that in all seventeen years of Castiel's life he never once kissed somebody, "..I'm about to graduate and I haven't even been kissed before." He ground the cigarette into the concrete.
Cas frowned "Sam and Jack did this?" Dean shrugged still looking around "Happy anniversary"
Castiel raised a brow at him in question so Dean elaborated "I had a place like this back in Kansas, I lived there my whole life so moving for college made me a little home sick- not to mention I left my younger brother behind."
"Can we talk?"
Dean scoffed "Can"t wait to see that." Gabriel scowled at him and Dean's lips instantly snapped shut, thankfully Gabriel walked off to go find his husband.
"I deserved it Sammy"
Dean mentally fist pumped about having not completely ruined his chances with Castiel
Sam shook his head, "At first yeah..I mean I've known that I didn't want girls since I was seven but then I started getting bullied for it, even when I hadn't told anyone- I'd get beaten up, pushed around..then I spent that entire summer when I was fifteen going to the gym and when I had that insane growth spurt I came back straight and popular."
Cas blinked "Dean..I.." Both of them just stared at eachother for moments not really knowing why but then Dean suddenly surged forward and he was kissing Cas
"Well I don't want to kiss you" Cas' voice getting louder and he was getting more frustrated
Gabriel didn't want to talk to him, he'd broke up with Jess and as of right now he had no one, and it was all his fault. He was back to being that broken beaten down kid and he'd put himself there.
Dean couldn't even believe Lucifer was doing it but none of Gabriel's other siblings stepped in so he didn't either until Sam overheard Lucifer telling Gabriel that Sam would get bored of him soon enough and realise he made a mistake wasting two years on him, yeah, that made Sam furious and he went off on Lucifer before grabbing Dean and Gabriel and getting them the hell out of there.
And while Dean supported the two, they were still stuck in the honeymoon phase and that mean't all of Dean's fears would come to life and this was one of them. "S-sorry Dean." Sam apologised, the boy looked dishevelled, his growing hair was a mess and his shirt had definitely been moments away from being taken off.
He thought about eating before he left but then shook the thought from his head. He didn't want to mess up his shirt- but he was definitely going to order take out when he got home because at a restaurant like that he just knew he'd leave hungry.
But then Cas said 'not like this' and ever since then the gears had been turning in his head, "Cas, we're here"
Cas stopped moving his head "Because they're jerks" He said "People like them tend to bully people like me"
Cas shoved him "Shut up"
"You wanna talk Cas?- let's talk" Dean turned to him, standing up "You kissed me- I didn't even-..." He huffed avoiding Cas' eyes "Cas..I grew up one way- I was taught all these things that are seared into my brain"
"No you actually can’t because we’re already here" Cas pointed outside the window "We live like..five blocks apart"
"Well I'm glad that you're excited."
He sighed "..So no- I didn't know I was..bisexual- I knew that I had feelings for guys- but I never acted on it because I didn't understand it, not..not until you kissed me"
Castiel smile went at the use of his full name, Dean was getting serious, "You could have chose anyone but you chose me..I just want it to be good for you."
Gabriel shared a knowing look with them, "Alright, my moose awaits- I made a promise that I'd slow dance at least once."
for awhile before I asked you out."
"It doesn't matter." He laughed dryly "You have done pretty much everything under the sun- so I wouldn't expect you to understand."
"Fine I'll go, but only to the kitchen you better have some snacks for me"
to say this."
He said and Sam blushed even harder "And thank you m'lady- at least one of you appreciates it."
"Jess I'm so sorry."
"Is he mad at me?- I really didn't mean to make a scene like that I just..I couldn't take it anymore." He tried to explain, he really didn't want Sam or Gabriel angry with him.
"But you let the whole world think that you slept with him."
"Awesome."
"There's time, graduation is a month away thats enough time for us to figure it all out just..please, don't say no."
Cas nodded "Me too" Dean stared at him, running his tongue over his bottom lip "..Goodnight Cas"
Castiel huffed in annoyance and Dean immediately noticed this "Woah hey, I didn't mean-" Dean lifted himself out of the water and he sat with Cas, "I didn't mean to upset you-"
They both sighed contently as Castiel pulled out, sliding off and tossing the condom as well as using a few tissues to clean himself up. "So.." Dean started once they both settled "Hi?"
The ball goes flying towards Cas and even though it's clearly her ball, her team mates still don't trust her to catch it, so the second and third basemen rush at her at the same time Dean takes off for third. He crashes into her, sending them both to the ground. There's a very audible crack and for a second he thinks it might be him but nothing hurts. Looking down, Castiel's eyes are closed and there are voices asking where the ball is.
“Ronald.”
That wasn't exactly what happened. “No.”
Dean ignores the feeling in his stomach at them using his nickname for her, pushing it down and concentrating on hitting the ball to its intended
“Ugh, you're an idiot. I can't believe I'm related to you,” she says, walking away
“Do I have to?” Dean whines. He's just glad no one else is here to see this. If Chuck or Victor were here, his life would be over.
person who likes her.
in a bikini and he's too busy trying to get his brain to think of anything else but her chest or legs or stomach or butt or hands or really
“Yes, be careful,” Missouri grants it, ushering the three boys out of the house while Cas glares at Missouri. Seeing this the woman simply shrugs.
“Thank you sir,” Michael replies, eyes sparkling at the compliment, “This is my brother Gabriel.”
"Hey!" He turns around to see her running after him, leaves falling out of her unruly hair.
“Cas, say thank you,” Missouri tells her, but Cas just keeps glaring at the woman.
Andrea smiles and puts her hand on Dean's shoulder. “You're really cute, but it's just not working out.”
“Come on, Dean,” Victor hisses in his ear, “Get her.”
. Whatever, she's pretty.
Dean doubts his dad knows what he's saying, but nods anyway. “Of course, Dad. Is that it?”
It's later day when Dean finds himself pushing Victor. “Dude, what the hell?”
"Are you the kid who took Castiel's money?" the kid glares at Dean, not giving a damn his dad is standing behind him.
Castiel claps for Jo as she steps to the plate before answering Dean's question, “You're alright. you're not as good as you think you are, but I don't think that matters to you. You don't care about baseball, not the way you care about art or books, and don't try to tell me you don't read because I
Castiel's eyes snap open. “Wait!”
Of course things change when school starts. They go home together still and even though Dean can sit anywhere else, he sits next to Cas. When she raises her eyebrows at him he shrugs back at her. Dean is quick to notice how she's no longer looking at him with a mixture of pity and anger, but instead she seems to be quietly amused by him.
"Why is it broken then?" John asks, taking bike from Dean to assess the damage. When Dean doesn't answer the question immediately, he asks again.
because she was
“No thank you,” she says, shooting a glare in Dean's direction. He struggles not to glare back, just because his dad is there. As it is, John's eyes narrow anyway and then he turns away to cough.
broke my arm,” Castiel corrects, sending a glare his way.
She just needs to strategize. She can't sneak out the front door as Missouri's currently on the couch watching “Miracle on 34th Street.” She can't leave through the back door either for the same reasons. Going out from the bottom floor's not an option. Acknowledging this, Cas quickly redresses into her snow outfit and opens her window. Cool winter air blasts her face and Cas pulls down her knit hat over her ears, straightens her gloves and nods seriously at the outside world before climbing out the window.
his dad cares so much.
Cas shrugs, “Sure.” She can finish Zelda later. Michael picks his book back up, “Alright, so this is Mohammad Ali, the greatest boxer of all time. Don't let anyone try to tell you otherwise.”
? He's almost about to say "who says I want to be friends with you‟ when she continues. “What's your favorite baseball team?” She asks it like she's asking a question of life and death.
Dean snorts. “Please, it's a walking, talking, cat wearing a hat. That's no ordinary cat, Cas! It's probably a werecat!” Dean watches a lot of old movies with his dad, so he knows about these things
,” she mouths.
“Nope, you can go,” Dean goes to close the door when John's voice calls out Cas' name.
Dean considers himself an atheist, but he's pretty sure there's some cosmic force out there that hates him. This becomes obvious at the end of March when the weather gets warmer.
By some miracle, the bus arrives at that moment and the bully isn's able to respond. This can only be a good thing since he's the kind of bully who responds with his fists for lack of anything to say.
He wishes he knew what was going on in her head, but it's impossible to tell where she's concerned. All Dean can really think about is how happy they were before he went and fucked it all up. At least he made the right choice today, that has to count for something right?
“Yeah,” Pam snickers, “Hit it to Cas.”
There's a collective silence as even Luther looks surprised someone actually picked him.
“I know dad" he starts, voice mocking. "when two people really love each other-”
Cas looks down at her white blouse and pleated skirt. “They're just clothes.”
Without a second of hesitation Dean responded, “Yes.” And then a moment later added quietly, “Don’t leave. Tonight. Don’t leave before I wake up.”
For the next week the pool was absolutely off limits. In fact, nearly everywhere in town was off limits. He was terrified that somehow the news would have spread or that he might accidentally run into Dean somewhere else. Eventually though, Charlie pressured him out again—threatening to just go back to the pool herself and apologize on his behalf.
And that’s when he saw him, a dark shadow leaning against the wall looking out the window. The man’s back was to Dean but even in the dark he could tell exactly who it was. His heart was in his throat, mind repeating this is it, this is it over and over as he realized that he was about to die.
“Charles was a good man, Dean. He’d inherited an empire from his father and tried his best to impose order and structure onto the chaos of random crime. He greatly reduced the number of murders, of petty—”
“I don’t blame you,” He said as two fingers pushed right into Dean’s body. He let out a breath like he’d been punched, moaning and rocking back on the digits. “You take it so well, like you were made for it.” Cas started scissoring him open roughly and he could tell that the other man was just as desperate as he was. One thing he’d learned about Cas was that he liked to take his time feeling Dean’s body, opening him up until he was a crying mess. Secretly Dean wondered if Cas got off making his partners feel good, like he’d rather make someone else come then finish himself.
“It’s okay, Gabe,” Anna sniffled, taking her brother’s hand.
The sight of such unfettered submission made him moan, using his thumb to smear come across those freckled cheeks. Dean’s tongue darted out, asking permission, and Castiel complied, letting the man suck the come from his fingers. They sat like that for a minute just breathing heavily, eventually he pressed their foreheads together and smiled. A small laugh escaped his lips, the sound making Dean flush. He pulled his thumb free to kiss the sweet man beneath him, hand finding its way into his hair as he pushed their sweat slicked bodies together again.
In the days leading up to his brilliant plan, he’d done some research of his own. Castiel had spilled a lot of blood but it always belonged to someone bad. Not that it justified murder, but Dean felt a lot more comfortable with the idea that Cas was some kind of vigilante protecting the innocent than a killer of good men. The discovery only served to strengthen his sense of rightness, that whatever the other man was doing he should support one hundred percent.
“Uh, yeah.” Sam eyed him up and down, flicking his gaze briefly to the others. “Are you—you must be Castiel?” He flushed slightly as Castiel nodded and he wondered idly what exactly Dean had mentioned about their relationship. “These your, uh, friends?”
“We can trust him, Dean. You know that.” Sam said emphatically, eyes opening wide and pleading.
Gabriel snorted but Castiel only glared at him. “Michael is under the impression that the colt was taken by his brother, Lucifer. As for why I’d like to cause Michael’s suspicion of his brother, it’s simple.” He paused, looking at Dean sternly. “I want to see them burn.”
Dean nodded, feeling like he might cry. Cry or explode, he wasn’t sure which. A bead of precome ran down the side of his dick, dripping to the floor. He bit his lip to stop from whimpering as Cas gasped and groaned behind him.
“Cas—” She started, looking worriedly between himself and Dean.
“Meg.” He greeted, nodding curtly.
“You’re coming back tonight?”
“Let’s go to bed, Cas.”
Dean chuckled uneasily, “Yeah, I was.” He scrubbed a hand over his face, letting his arm fall across the back of the seat, fingers inches away from Castiel. “Look, man. If you weren’t interested or whatever, you could have just said something. Didn’t have to run away in the rain.”
“I just want to look professional. We need these people on our side and they are not likely to aid criminals—”
“I needed you to believe it was your fault and keep the others from looking too far into my means.”
he’s not even in your field!
Castiel nodded, he’d assumed this would be the first question, considering how hurt Dean had been the last time the subject was broached. He took a steadying breath, suddenly weary of exposing their plans. “I said before that it was to cause unrest. This is true. The gun belongs to Michael, a treasured family heirloom. I stole it and had myself arrested the very same day to give myself an alibi.”
He watched with rapt attention as calloused fingers circled the tight pucker of muscle as Dean teased himself slightly before pressing one slicked finger inside. They moaned together as the digit disappeared right to the knuckle, the sight so beautiful he couldn’t help palm himself in time with Dean’s gently thrusts.
“The blonde one.”
The warmth of Dean’s fingers gently urging their bodies closer pulled him from his thoughts and he found himself pressing their forehead together. They stayed like that, breathing in quiet tandem, sharing air in the impossibly small space left between them.
“I’m serious. From what you’ve said, though, he doesn’t,” he paused to consider, “he doesn’t sound like a bad person.”
“Good morning.” Castiel said calmly and then turned to Dean. “Why don’t you get us some coffee?” He offered a slight smile and the man beamed back at him, practically bouncing toward the pot of coffee and rushing back with two mugs.
“We weren’t even in the same year! It is weird for a some random junior to add him a year after he graduates.” Castiel said, idly clicking through the rest of the album.
“N-no, it’s fine. It’s totally fine, absolutely—uh—fine.” He cringed at the repetition, eyes darting away to stare holes in the ground as Dean laughed. “Uh, it’s a really great book.” He muttered to the grass.
When they pulled away Dean shut his eyes and moaned, picking up the pace while Castiel gulped in air helplessly, barely able to comprehend the tight heat around his cock, the perfect friction as Dean clenched every time he pulled off.
“Good, rally them. Tell your men to come here tonight, after midnight.”
“So you lied to me again.”
His brother scoffed. “For you maybe, but how do any of us know we can trust him? Besides, we already have an inside man. Two is a crowd.”
“Good boy.” He could hear Cas spit, then the slick sound of his hand moving up and down his shaft. Dean was so hard he felt lightheaded, but he resisted the urge to touch himself, straining to hear Cas instead.
Castiel stretched, spreading his body across the small bed and listening to the pop of muscles stiff from sleeping at an awkward angle. From down the hall there were sounds of the tap running followed by a bubbling popping sound he couldn’t quite identify. He was half hard and wondered idly whether he could get a blowjob. It was highly likely that he could but he decided to forgo asking for Dean’s sake. Judging by the orderly state of the apartment, it was a pretty safe bet the man was big on punctuality too.
“No you’re not. We were—everything was great and then, and now, you’re somewhere else. Did I do something? Did I make you unhappy somehow?”
“Afternoon Dean. If I see you poking around or catch you try’na talk poor Kevin into helping you skirt my orders, so help me.”
“I’m, I’m not very good. I barely know how.”
There was a long moment of silence, broken only when Cas sat down. “I leave and you keep trying to catch me, I guess.” He shrugged and that was it. The rest of the meal went by in silence, there wasn’t anything left to say. Dean would let him leave, give him a head start, and then pour himself into the search to capture him again. That was how it should be, everything going back to normal. Only that thought only seemed to make him feel worse.
I'm so sorry this took so long to post, so to make it up to you I tried to write a long chapter. Unfortunately, the next chapter will probably also take a little more than a week because of exams!
He looked to Victor for confirmation and then man nodded. “Abduction rates are high around the seedier parts of town.”
“Why are you calling?” He finally managed to ask, feeling an overwhelming sense of worry clawing its way up his spine.
“What?”
“One more thing—your father’s friend,” he tried to think of an alias that she’d understand. He couldn’t say Alastair’s name over the phone, couldn’t risk the operator overhearing. “Al.”
“Went smoothly, what do you—what do you mean?”
If anything, Benny only looked more concerned. “Ben, I’m fine, really. We’ve all been here longer than we’d like. Cas—tiel is, uh, is in custody already so I doubt we’ll have anymore trouble tonight.”
There was a long silence where Dean worried he’d ruined the moment, where he wondered if Cas was going to toss him away and laughed at how pathetic he was. But then Cas said, “I’ll be here,” and tightened his arms around Dean. It was probably just his imagination but he could have sworn he felt Cas kiss the top of his head as he murmured, “In the morning. I’ll be here.”
“What?” He demanded.
“Cas?”
“I guess.” He took a sip, still tracking every movement, looking for any indication that he might—
“Cas,” Dean said unsurely, looking more and more like he’d made the biggest mistake of his life coming here. The look made Castiel’s heart hurt, this wasn’t how he’d envisioned everything happening, he didn’t want Dean to think they were frightening or evil. It was strange how much he cared what this man thought of his lifestyle, of his friends and family.
Anna turned then, pulling Castiel in close enough that she could whisper. “I’m glad you decided to trust him, little brother. You’ve spent far too much time alone.”
Hesitantly, he complied, coming to sit on Castiel’s chest a scant few inches from his mouth. Castiel licked his lips, leaning forward slightly to run his tongue teasingly over Dean’s cockhead and paying special attention to the slit that was already leaking precome.
“Sam can take him out of town. He can say I was pretty upset about something and just took off on a bender.”
Their bodies tangled together, the heat of skin on skin enough to make them feel feverish as they rocked into each other. Dean whimpered, rolling his hips in search of the friction they both needed. He raked his nails down the curve of Castiel’s spine, greedy hands grasping at his ass to better grind their cocks together.
“It’s not you lamb, it’s your little friends.” Balthazar added.
“Yeah, no problem.”
Dean practically skipped the few feet to the sink, making as quick work of his teeth as possible. The man’s eagerness was almost adorable, exciting something in Castiel so that when the door started to close, he shook his head. “Door stays open, baby.”
“Sammy’s good people, Cas.”
“Baah, ba-AH.” Balthazar imitated some strange amalgam of a sheep and a moan that even made Anna cover her mouth in a laugh. The sight would have aggravated him further, but Balthazar’s face was unusually warm, a taunting smile playing at the corner of his lips. This wasn’t malicious, it was friendly and teasing and the thought was somehow satisfying.
“All I know is that I haven’t seen you this happy, like, ever.”
“I’m sorry that you find this so upsetting—”
Charlie snorted. “Cas, do you know how many time he’s used that line? Basically every girl at school had a private ‘lesson’ from Dean—if you know what I mean.” She waggled her eyebrows as he continued staring in horror.
Anna looked nervous and sad again, like she was going to start crying before Gabriel stepped in to save her, “My sister works at a club down town. I was walking her home when—when,”
Dean was determined now. He hollowed out his cheeks and sucked hard, mouth making obscene slurping and gagging noises the entire time. When he ran the flat of his tongue up and down the thick vein under the head of Cas’ cock, it made him hiss: “Yes, fuck don’t stop, I’m so close. Just like that—
“Hello, Dean.”
“What’s the matter?” Cas asked, innocent and soft as if the asshole really cared. “Cold feet? You do still want to crack the case, don’t you? Be the big hero, save the day?”
"Please, Cas. Need it harder." Dean whimpered, fingers clawing at Castiel's thighs trying to push him back inside, to force him deeper.
“I should make you prove it.” Cas hummed, slowly grinding himself against Dean’s groin. “What do you think, Dean?”
It took Castiel a while to process the joke, flushing when he noticed that he’d been staring. “Oh, of course.”
“You ever been touched like this, pretty?”
“Oh, it makes me tingly when you’re all business like this.” She said, rolling her hips and sliding a hand down to cup his groin.
Beside him, Dean’s body was a furnace that radiated a warmth he craved, wanted so desperately to crawl inside of, to give in to, to accept the comfort and solace it promised. Every few steps their fingers would brush together, a brief contact proved to be almost as distressing as it was reassuring. Maybe if he could just feel the solid weight of their fingers entwined together, he could assuage some of this guilt, this worry. Maybe, if they were together—
“Where?” He felt awake all of a sudden—mind clear but confused.
“Yes, that will be lovely. Goodbye, Meg.” He tried to sound sincere while fighting the urge to cringe. Just down the hall Dean slept peacefully, unaware that a short distance away he was pretending to be someone else’s lover. It felt like a betrayal.
He was almost asleep when Dean started speaking again. “Cas,” he asked hesitantly, quietly.
“Yes?”
“Dean? Do you have any idea what time it is?”
Dean woke up alone and cold in his bed sometime around ten. A sinking feeling ran through him and he sat up to scan the room, but there was no sign of Cas anywhere. He flopped back down and stared up the ceiling. Belatedly, he realized the shower was being turned off and a few seconds later a very naked Castiel came out of the bathroom toweling his wet hair.
“Um, yeah?” He said, silently pleading to any and every god in the universe that no one walk through that door.
“You’re kidding.”
“You’re leaving.” It wasn’t a question and Dean tried to force the words to sound neutral, casual.
He moaned and looked up into Dean’s warm eyes, letting the man brush away an errant tear with his thumb. Castiel didn’t even feel embarrassed to be crying, not now, not like this. Dean cupped his face and crashed their mouths together, kissing like it was the only thing that mattered in the world.
“Factory district?” Balthazar offered.
From the back seat Dean smirked, “Guess I’m not the only one s’well trained.”
“I just overhead Jo Harvelle talking and—you’re going to flip,” she pulled at his desk chair until he turned around enough to face her. “Guess who got a job at the community pool?”
“The captain says he wants you to sit tight.”
But that’s not what happened, Cas just smiled slightly and offered over a glass. “I believe congratulations are in order, then.”
“I want your hips still,” he said sternly. Then, more softly, “but I’d like your hands on me, wherever you wish to touch.”
“Chuck raised you? Guy could practically predict every move the police ever made; no one even knew what the guy looked like. You tryna tell me The Prophet was some kinda paragon of virtue?”
“Come on, let’s get you to bed.” Dean nodded as Cas reached around him, hooking one arm behind his back and the other under his knees before lifting him into his arms. He knew this should be embarrassing but he was too lightheaded and blissed out to really care. It felt nice, being bridled carried, pressed up against Cas’ chest and neck.
“Hey, hey, you’re okay. I’ve got you.” Dean cooed, rubbing a hand along his back as he kept coughing.
The moment Castiel slid behind the wheel of his car, wave after wave of suppressed emotion overwhelmed him. Balthazar may have been lying dead in a hospital bed and he wouldn’t know until he spoke to Meg again later, Michael might kill him today, and Dean—he’d lost Dean. He heaved in a breath, angrily wiping tears from his eyes as he put the car in gear. This was no way to behave, he was not this man, and he was not going to lose control like this. Solider, solider, he repeated to himself over and over.
“Questioned the survivors yet?” Benny asked.
“You’re an idiot, though.”
“I’m not being overly dramatic, Gabriel. I’m being frank.”
“Anything.” The word ghosted over Castiel’s lips and he breathed it in, let it fill him. “Anything you want,” the other man continued, eyes slipping shut. “Anything for you. Always, anything for you.”
“A bad man.” He whispered, sounding sadder than he’d intended.
Written in the same blue pen and elegant handwriting as the first ones were the words:
Panties. Inside were five pairs of expensive women’s underwear—pink satin, white lace, a pale blue with a lace trim, black satin, and a pink silk pair with delicate looking bows around the thighs. Dean’s mouth went dry, palms sweating, head a dizzy mess. In his shock it took him a few minutes to notice that his cock had started to stir, hardening slightly in his pants. No one asked you, he snapped, appalled and confused by his own reaction to contents of the package.
Rowena taps a crimson nail to her lip. “Seems to be a bit of a grey area.”
“We could get tickets to a Wednesday matinee for a show on Broadway?”
Dean will take all the luck he can get these days.
Dean could attempt to defend himself, but honestly she’s not wrong.  So instead he tosses out, “Donna picked it!”
He’s expecting to see surprise in those baby blues; instead he finds a comical grin, “Baby steps, my Omega, baby steps.  I’m here till the end.”
“Can you have a baby?”  Her face is gentle laced with concern.
The younger man is frozen in his spot. The jet even rumbles a bit and Dean could care less because that is way over the top. Jesus Christ that’s a fucking ton of Christmas decorations.
Castiel had anticipated the question, so with a sweet, innocent twinkle to his eye, he answers, “A store that caters completely to omega males. They have quite the extensive lingerie department.”
Castiel lifts Dean into his arms, carrying him over to the black van.  It takes some juggling, but eventually Dean sprawls out on the floor of the vehicle so Cas can drive. The first thing Dean notes is heat blaring from the van’s dash along with the trench coat wrapped around his shoulders.  Such a fabulous aroma surrounds him that Dean can almost pretend this is his forever.  His alpha talks as he takes them back to Dean’s house, a constant flow of wishes in one hand as the blood from Dean blemishes the other.
I do believe the game is upon us.
Interjecting quickly Cas cuts in, “Dean, calm down.  No news since the last time we spoke.  I am healthy and well; nothing has happened, and I am still unsure of my return date.”
Jesus, the principal is calling him. This can’t be good. “Yes, Garth, I know who you are. Is Meg okay?”
Pulling back, Dean’s vision goes wonky. “The spaceship’s moving on its own.”
“Which one should we sing, sweetheart? We have to practice so when you are a big omega, you will be ready for your alpha.”
“No matter what happens, I need you to always remember one thing.”  Her hand opens stroking the unborn child between them, “I speak the truth.  My loyalties will be tested; I might have to tap dance for the rest, but when it’s you, me, and junior here, no one lies. Got it?”
A memory tumbles through his mind, building strength as Dean attempts to ignore it.
The alpha scoots to the far side of his bed, then timidly pulls the sheets back.  “You could nap here.  I promise to stay on my side of the bed.” Castiel's eyes search Dean’s. “It would be … relaxing to have your scent here.”
“Hot bath or massage?”
“Got it.”  Her voice wavers, but she’s still in control.  “Tell Charlie to bring Benedryl.  He’s getting a wicked rash.”
Damn it, Max.  The first day he arrived Dean was messed up on whatever anxiety pill his friend gave him.  The omega doesn’t remember any of it.
Green trees with white tips line the curvy black top.  He probably should call Benny and tell him he’s heading home early, but he’ll be there before the housekeeper ever leaves so it seems like a nonissue.  Freedom pumps through his blood.  Never in Dean’s wildest dreams did he ever think to want such a wonderful life.  Happiness swells into his scent as they head up to the house.
Darkness surrounds the space as the alpha surveys the land.  He can hear the ocean behind him as he steps forward to enter the thick green jungle.  One of Dean’s favorite spots.  The shadow alpha isn’t here, but the tingle behind his ear tells Castiel the bastard is not far.  They will show themselves soon.
Hastily Bela gathers her purse, heading to the locked door towards the elevators.  She twists the handle, but nothing happens.  Bela starts banging on the door, “Let me out.  Please, I am so done.”
“My house,” the professor announces, unlocking the door and waiting for Dean to enter too.
Once Meg is freed from her car seat, she and Claire sprint into the restaurant without him. The second he steps through the doors, hundreds of post-its are essentially thrown in his face. For several moments, little pink, blue, and yellow squares are raining over his head.
In a booming clear voice Dean replies, “NO Cas!  Do NOT leave.  Please stay.”
Dean tightly embraces his alpha glaring at him intensely.  “No Cas.  This is my home.  I willingly chose to be your mate for life.  However, it would be nice to have a brother too.”
A shuffling of feet brings a tall bearded man.  The lack of scent tells Dean he’s a beta; the man puts out his large hand with a grin. “Pleasure to meet you, brother.  I’m Benny, cook and housekeeper.”
Suddenly Gabriel howls in a dark feral voice, “My eyes!  My eyes!  I’m blind.  Set me on fire!  Where is the blaze I’ll jump right in?”  His cousin actually dashes towards the exit and Castiel has to tackle him while the man yells, “Light me up Mother Fucker!  Just set me on fire Cassie, I can take it!”
A kiss to his lips helps camouflage his embarrassment.  Cas doesn’t hold back.  Damn.
Gabriel rubs his face harshly, “I never said it was over, just paused for station identification.  I was giving him his space to take his month and see if he returned on his own.”
However, Cas’s face tightens further with stress, “No, this will not do.  Your health is important, Dean.  I will call my doctor and make an appointment for you.  I insist.”
Everything stills in that instance.  Cas doesn’t halt his progress until the tips of his fingers ghost through, connecting with the wisps of Dean’s hair.  An electric shock quivers through his skin from just that simple touch.  Emerald green eyes lock onto Sapphire gems, the two men frozen in time, not wanting to lose the essence of the caress.  Dean glimpses the fear trembling in his angel’s eyes, but it’s not from panic.  Castiel appears worried; perhaps he pushed his hunter too far.  With a reassuring smile, Dean whispers, “My beautiful Cas, I give you all of me.”
“Idiot!”  Cas yells, slamming the other alpha against the cement, bliss mixing with the rage as Dick’s head cracks against the wall.  “You absolute moron.  You know nothing about MY OMEGA; he wasn’t getting off on their pain.”
Enjoy!
Hanging his floppy brown hair, Sam sighs, “Meg and I need our own space.”
Tender hands stroke up and down Dean’s back as he continues to watch the scenery go by, the cloudy sky of the storm leaving a gloomy appearance.  Castiel has a point.  It doesn’t matter what Dean believes, he will knot with Castiel during his next heat, assuring a pregnancy.
“No.  The person who spoke those vile words to me last night was not Cas.  I truly believe there is something more than multiple personalities cursing my alpha.”
A call to Hannah must happen; it’s a moral imperative.
“Damn it,” the omega hisses because there is nothing here.
“Who’s Emma?”  Meg blurts.
Golden-brown eyes reply, ya think?
“We are not discussing this.”
That simple thought causes him to snap, losing Meg will never happen. The dancer pumps his legs harder, speeding up his pace. Theo’s escape is slowed by the tiny woman’s thrashing. He can do this, there is no other choice. Meg entered the home of a mad man to save him from torture and possibly death. Now it’s time for Cas to repay the courage that she showed him. In seconds, he closes the gap, his mind releasing a mantra, ‘take the bastard down’. Castiel doesn’t have to subdue him totally, just stall the kidnappers until help arrives. Surely he’s strong enough to accomplish that task.
“Umm, okay.”  Then Cas thinks of the question he has been dying to ask someone, about Macleod and his wife.  “Does she know about his activities while abroad?”
Four days after the event, Balthazar and Castiel had discussed, in detail, their abhorrence towards a certain alpha.  During the meeting that included large amounts of whiskey, they had contacted Oz Investigations.  A private eye firm that was run by Charlie and her partner Dorothy.
With those four words, Dean regains control, finding his smile once again.  Castiel is his life line, unknowingly hauling his pathetic ass out of the horrors of his past, and into the light before them.  “I’m good Cas.”  He exclaims as he hits the gas harder with his foot chasing the noon sun.
The other patients have so much crap on their own plates that Dean’s sexuality is not even a blip on the radar. Well, obviously Cas’s brothers have an opinion, but again, big shocker! They want Castiel to be happy; period. His gorgeous angel’s intentions are crystal clear; he desires the ex-bounty hunter, not as a plaything, but a permanent fixture in his life.
“Dean could be useful.” He offered weakly, refusing to acknowledge the part of him that filled with giddiness at the mention of loving Dean.
“Michael’s suspicions will grow, that is the intended outcome.”
“I—you’re going to need to slow down and tell me everything that happened. From the beginning.”
Shortly after that plan failed, while wallowing in self-pity, he realized that he had something the department never did—he knew that Cas needed something from evidence. Clearly he’d given up thinking Dean would fetch it for him which meant that he’d have to come get it himself, or at least send a crony Dean could beat down for a phone number or something.
“Don’t you tell me to listen, boy. I should drive over to that hole of an apartment and make you see sense.”
The word went right to Dean’s dick, now soft in his come soaked underwear. He flushed a little, knowing deep down that he’d go. Something was wrong with him, something truly fucking broken because he couldn’t help himself. The way Cas talked to him, the way he’d just demanded
There was a pause, Dean closed his eyes and bit his lips as Castiel continued to work him open. “Could, could you—uh—slow down? Who is this?”
Another silence passed between them. “Oh,” Dean finally whispered, keeping his face hidden against Castiel’s chest.
He caught Dean’s gaze and licked a long, slow stripe from root to tip before taking him fully again. His tongue worked the vein along the shaft, going deeper and deeper and deeper. The detective babbled above him like he was possessed, entire body shaking with the effort not to buck up into the warm heat of Castiel’s throat.
"Before I say anything- just know this is
why you don't have a boyfriend yet"
She was no longer the cute paralegal tha worked in his department, she was
Cas blinked obviously taken back by the question "Um..I guess I just knew, I didn't see girls like I was supposed too, besides when my first girlfriend wanted to have sex and I couldn't get hard I pretty much knew"
Dean quickly checked his phone for the time before putting it back into his pocket. "I'd
"When?"
Dean looked good..his hair was shorter and he had a nice stubble, he was bigger he had more muscle on him, Castiel gulped twelve years and damn Dean Winchester still made his heart stop.
Dean was scared- well nervous saws more like it, his hands shook on the wheel and Cas watched him "Dean?"
Dean cleared his throat "Well tomorrow is gonna be the day me and Cas met and I kinda wanna do something special for the both of us"
Dean shrugged "I mean for as long as I've known you you've never shown any real interest in any girls..I kind of always thought it was because you didn't think you could tell me you like dudes"
"Dean-"
Gabriel nodded "I know- you want to find your 'soulmate'" He sighed dramatically "Well what are your plans then?"
Cas glared "
a gentleman?" Anna gave Castiel a thumbs up before walking off to put in their order. "Sorry about her she's
"Well not exactly..I mean she kind of avoids me."
"Yes and I was just leaving for that date, you really couldn't have waited until I left?"
There was a long silence, they just stood together not saying anything for a long while, "Oh!- there you two are." Gabriel said suddenly and they were turning around "Dean Sam requests your assistance..he's having a melt down." He whispered the last part, not showing how he was slightly worried.
His lips were on Dean in a light kiss, not full on the lips but it didn't matter because it was over as soon as it started, Dean was pulling away with a laugh "How's that?" He said, leaving Castiel surprised and very much confused, he pressed his fingers to his lips..
Cas flushed "I'd like that.." Dean beamed proudly "I can't believe I get to take my dork tutor who's wearing a shirt with frickin'
"..I used to have someone a long time ago..and after I still dated I still fell in love but it wasn't like before..I think I just gave up."
With just ten minutes left until his driver was to pick him up he sat down on the couch and decided to watch whatever was on as he waited.
"I bet you haven't."
Dean let concerned big brother seep into his tone. He was scared for his brother.
Dean groaned playfully but found himself missing the comfortable silence with Castiel "A bestman's job is never done." He commented, going back into the house to see why Sam needed him. Gabriel sat where Dean previously was and looked a his brother watch Dean go for a moment "Y'know you never actually told me how you and Dean knew each other- well properly at least."
