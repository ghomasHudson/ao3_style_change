"John, won't you just drop it?"
"Sorry, I can't tonight. I have to do some grocery shopping."
"Yes, I've been eating out."
Sherlock finishes to button up his pyjamas shirt and glances at John.
"I was just trying to make conversation," Mycroft retorted with a frown as he entered the kitchen, his gaze scanning it idly. Greg smiled.
"Sherlock! Sherlock!"
All of a sudden the door was slammed open frantically. A trembling and extremely pale Sherlock, very much like the one who had left him tied to the chair in the basement, entered the hospital room and stopped abruptly as he came face to face with John.
Sherlock could not hear what they were saying but they both seemed quite upset. He wondered if they were going to end up grappling like in movies.
, John!"
"What are you talking about?"
"Sherlock," John said, a warning in his voice. "You know, that scowl may get stuck on your face forever if you don't stop it."
"Tired of technology?"
"You don't want me to go?" he asked, and he seemed so disappointed John could not bear it. So he splattered a grin on his fluffy face and waved his paws.
"Good morning Mrs. Hudson! Sorry to bother you so early, but I was wondering, do you happen to know a place I could buy a ring not too expensive?"
Angelo frowned, apparently affronted.
"I'm serious, Seb."
"Dead, yes. Obviously he left the letters before he died for someone to make sure Sherlock would read them, but that is not the point."
"Well your brother is mentioning him as if you did, yes."
"You should."
"He can't be much of a rival."
"We both know you've grown used to sleeping in the other one. It's fine. I don't mind."
John paused. In the end, he could not stop himself from asking.
Sherlock smirked, and in his low baritone voice, ordered:
"Yes. But can we turn off the light?"

You watched, letting memories of John flow away with the assassin's blood.
"Good." Moriarty nodded and parted Sherlock's legs wider.
The first thing his gaze fell on was the wall of his room. He felt something warm and breathing in his arms and looked down. John's hair. His smell. That of his shampoo, too.
He smiles, remembering his own bewilderment that day, and Mike's amused smile.
I wonder when your hell truly started... When did you understand? When did you know you'd have to go? When did you start lying to everyone? Lie to-
"To finish the game."
It's not poisoned, if that's what is worrying you. I wouldn't have gone through the trouble of coming to see you if I only wanted you dead. And why would I?"
"Bravo," she whispered. "You haven't changed a bit. You're still so... sharp." There was an edge of bitterness, perhaps even pain, in her tone, under the ostentatious playfulness. She smiled. "This calls for some celebration, don't you think?" She took the phone and composed a number. "This is room 212. Please bring us a bottle of Champagne and two glasses. Thank you." She hung up.
"Do you even realize the situation we're in? You'll end up in a cage, in a zoo! And I... They'll probably bring me to the police for keeping a tiger on a
Harry sighed as she stretched on her chair in her office. Technically it wasn't exactly
"Amsterdam!"
"Interesting you should mention Sherlock's notebook first, of all things," he muses. "I can see your priorities–"
"All right. Eat, then."
Y'know, St Paul's epistles," Seb goes on. You know. Mary told you. It was Ron's funeral.
"This?"
"And why, pray tell?"
John laughs.
"I'm fine, really."
Sherlock's eyes were scanning the room. He was standing very still, only his hands, twitching with tension, betraying his impatience. John wondered whether he had heard him at all.
The stingy he conquers by gifts,
"What are you saying? This man here is Jim Moriarty!"
"John! It's been so long."
John bit him. Hard.
"It's fine, you're logical enough for the whole street, remember?"
"Try to sleep again?"
"Talking to you is tiring," Sherlock deadpanned, turning to face the other side.
John guesses the 'Baker Street irregulars' is just the name of Sherlock's homeless network. He had no idea it had a name. Sherlock never told him. John can almost hear him:
sucked and fondled and taken care of, mind you). But as ridiculous as it sounded, this was Sherlock, and it made all the difference.
John walked to the sofa, grabbed Sherlock's robe, and gave it to him as he handed him the second cup, on which was printed "Half". Sherlock glowered, but met John's mirroring glare, and did not want to argue now. He had yet to learn anything about the case.
"For goodness' sake Greg didn't I already tell you that? I told you before I went and we talked about it when I got back, what do you–"
"Sherlock!"
John's eyes widened as realization hit him. He checked his watch – still five minutes.
Sebastian never shot.
Sherlock sent him a glance sideways, observing his tensed features, but shook his head negatively.
"Is there anything you can tell me about it?"
John shifts uneasily. "Screamed your name."
She hangs up and turns to the ladder that's appeared while she was on the phone with Sherlock. The violin has stopped, but the voice is still singing. And now Mary can hear the rustling of the sea. She walks towards the ladder – green, why is it green? Something about a case... a green ladder? – and feels the sand under the soles of her bare feet.
"I didn't say I ate a lot. Please do pay attention."
"I feed upon it and extinguish it"
He started playing with the paw closest to him – it was exactly like a cat's, except in much bigger. Again, John couldn't help but melt. What was wrong with him? He liked cats, but wasn't dotty about them either. He couldn't figure out why playing with tiger-Sherlock was so much fun.
"Stop pretending you can read my every thought," John snapped, trying to shrug off the hand on his shoulder, and failing as the geip just tightened on his shoulder. Then in a blink Sherlock's face was just an inch away from his own. John's breath caught in his throat.
"You mean you're going to lie there while I finish writing?"
too. Yet I'm no closer to understanding what he meant than back then. It might be because there is no keyhole.
"But John, we can't stay here like this all day."
do you think you're doing, John? Get out of there
His eyes fell on the two mugs he'd left on the table. "Better", one said. "
"Oh God, Seb."
, John tried to convey through his nuzzling.
Are you scared he will use me against you again in the future?
Three. (but he's proud – five)
At the door, John turns to Shinwell and says before he can utter a word:
"Sure. Great." Then a small doubt poked at his mind. "What's the name of the restaurant?"
Sherlock opened his eyes. The first thing he felt was the wetness on his cheeks. He brought a hand to his face and sighed.
woman?"
With a grace John could never have even when he was sober, Victor stood up and went to the counter. John watched him from afar, full-on charm and all smiles with Angelo, and thought with a lopsided smile that he was probably a lot more similar to Captain Kirk than himself. Or to Bond. But John did not like the man enough to concede that point just yet.
He gasps, then blinks in surprise. Sherlock observes him more closely, then sees, too. The bulge in his trousers.
needed someone, there's always you. But you're a kept man. Useless, too."
He still looked like a man who'd seen too much, she thought, and who'd somehow aged prematurely. It wasn't that he seemed older than he actually was – he wasn't that young anymore after all – but there was a depth in his gaze that betrayed something boundless within him – sorrow, perhaps. Or maybe love.
Finally, there had been signs. Nothing clear, nothing obvious. In fact, nothing Mycroft could undoubtedly identify as his brother's doing. Still, he now had good reasons to hope that Sherlock was alive (and still in the game, whispered a dark voice in the recesses of his mind).
"Sherlock," John began worriedly, a warning in his voice. Sherlock ignored his flatmate.
"She sounds like a funny girl. I'm really looking forward to meeting her."
"What?"
Sherlock nodded and John noticed a faint blush spreading to his cheeks, which deepened every time John kissed him.
John mused as he snuggled up closer into the embrace. But it was fine. If he could stop being so stupid about all this, and act rationally, they could probably come to an agreement: they both needed some good quality sleep after all, and only seemed to get any when they were lying together. It was on this optimistic thought that John fell back to sleep, purring softly in Sherlock's arms.
Why had John mentioned the Woman then?
, John thought.
feel about me having her and Blake in my life?"
Expectedly, she stares at the comment. Then breaks into laughter.
"Do you want to invite her over dinner? I can tell her we were just cuddling, and-"
"And what about you, then? The man in the tower. Are
"Mycroft Holmes, I am arresting you on suspicion of the abduction and false imprisonment of Dr. John Hamish Watson."
"It is! Please, I..." He glances nervously towards the kitchen as he hears Molly coming, "I didn't lie to you, Dr. Watson."
"Irritating," he suddenly says. "He was irritating. And way too tactile."
"Sherlock, do you seriously think Mycroft would let any harm come to someone you cared about?"
"Sh... Sherlock..."
"Why should we wash each other? Do normal people wash each other? I thought only animals did."
"My flatmate."
"Come on, John, you know how I work. You know how I
"Don't move. It's cosy," she grumbles.
"Not really, no. I pushed the crib to a corner. I can't get rid of the son, though."
"In a fit of anger?" Donovan said as if Sherlock was the idiot here. Then she sighed heavily."Look, if he killed his boyfriend out of love, he would have reason to have a fit when he came home. Anger, or despair... could be both. He would have still been upset, probably enraged at how his boyfriend abandoned him. And the picture? Well, he might have thrown the mug at it after the murder — and don't give me that look! He might've prepared his tea before, left the mug, thrown it later."
He jolted back to reality.
John's hands brush against your nipples again and you glare. "Do you have to keep doing that?"
Anything in? I'm starving. Oh f... There's a head. A severed head. - Just tea for me, thanks. - No, there's a head in the fridge. - Yes? - A bloody head! - Well, where else could I put it?
"You should worry about yourself," he advised sternly.
"Serial  killer is a man – in his forties I'd say – he knows all the victims but  not since long, a few days at most. He met them all once, then met with  them again "accidentally", which is when he killed them."
"I'm not falling for this, Seb."
," Sherlock answered flatly. She stared.
Why? he'd asked.
John didn't understand what the whole thing with throwing up was – he didn't see the point. It didn't make him feel any better, didn't lessen the pain, didn't make him forget. Maybe it was his way of shooting at the wall. He drew a smiley face on the toilet lid.
"Why wouldn't you like me to call you Jim, since you've visibly been very keen to take on the name?"
Twelve-year-old Mycroft Holmes snorted.
"You mean friends with benefit?"
The consulting detective smirked smugly.
was very pleasurable. Yet his position, perhaps, or the fact that he could only lie there and wait, made him stiffen almost imperceptibly. The moment Sherlock realized it, he forced himself to slacken at once, praying that John hadn't noticed.
This hadn't been planned, Sherlock was sure. Whatever this was, it had never been part of
"Sherlock! Are you all right?"
"Sherlock, what are you saying?" John asks hoarsely, a strain in his voice. You blink. Did you just say that out loud? Your fingers between John's legs are apparently becoming more and more talented, as John is having more and more difficulties to catch his breath. You smirk.
It’s cryptic.
"Sherlock? Sherlock, look at me."
"Come on, Sherlock."
Oh, but that was so wrong. For both of them. He let the bitterness and sheer hurt wash over him and transform to desire and devotion, crossing his arms down on his hips, rocking in abandon to the tempo, throwing his head to the side voluptuously.
"Sure sounded like it."
Maybe you should move out. No, you know you can't. You physically
"Don't wanna talk about it?"
His body heat is overwhelming, and soon you can no longer tell whether the wetness you feel all over his skin and brow pressed to your chest is rain water or sweat. He lets go of your throat with a sigh and arches his back as your fingers brush the tip of his hard-on.
Empty. Was Sherlock's grave empty, or was Moriarty in it? She had never asked. Sherlock would know. Moran probably did. Irene watched the back of the man standing next to a tall red-haired woman and two smaller blondes – not the same kind of blond, one closer to grey, like Dr. Watson's, the other, more like ambers. Irene noted with satisfaction that none of them looked as good as she did in her black widow outfit. Nothing too stunning, of course – she did not want to attract attention. But black did not suit either of those women.
"Hello, Ms. Harvest. Would you follow me to a more quiet place?"
But she was already running down the steps. He shrugged.
"Oh yes. Always loved letters and numbers."
"Sherlock, that's not the same."
"And that's all right with you? You seem like quite the romantic type..."
There was no way he was going to face his flatmate while in this form on one of his

Sherlock's eyes turned to slits, but his mouth curved into a sardonic grin.
"Should we get a cat?"
to elicit a gasp from the detective who clutched onto his back, now using his nails to engrave the concerto on his skin. John groaned.
"So you would rather do the talking first. Fine."
If you absolutely need to contact me, send an email to this address. I cannot guarantee you will get an answer promptly. But this will be the quickest and safest way to reach me."
Something like fear flickered in the opalescent eyes, and John felt the urge to drink it all up.
"Am I not even allowed to visit my little brother now?"
He repressed a sigh. He had seen worse, after all. Much worse. He'd been terrified this morning when he'd thought he might have lost Sherlock for good.
Sherlock did not see the punch coming, and it sent him straight to the ground. He breathed in deeply, trying not to gasp, because whatever was coming, he deserved it. But when he looked up John was gone. He came back a second later from Sherlock's room with a sheet and a blanket, gathering the detective in it very gently, holding his bandaged arm before bringing him to the couch. Sherlock wondered idly why he hadn't brought him to the bedroom, if he liked the sheet and blanket so much.
He jumped, however, when he felt Sherlock's hand – the one that was playing so skilfully the second violin part of the concerto – creep up his right buttock.
, he wasn't very talkative. Plus, she enjoyed listening to music while hot steaming water was poured on her body, and it helped her relax after a hard day's work.
Oh, I see. Playing detective again, are we?"
"I've tried this a hundred times already. I know his answers by heart now."
"John."
"John. John, wake up. John. John! We must get you to a hospital! John! JOHN!"
Sherlock stifled a sigh of frustration. Why was it so difficult to communicate with John now? He'd growned accustomed to not having to keep himself in check around his flatmate, and having to pay attention to everything each of them said and did in order to devise a line of conduct was proving to be more troublesome than he'd expected. It had been so easy before. Sherlock would just be himself; sometimes John would have enough, would leave for some air; he would, eventually, come back – always – and everything was just fine. But now that they had taken this extra step in their "relationship", Sherlock knew that the impact of everything he did or said would be greater on his flatmate, and that he no longer had his usual outlet (the girlfriend).
Of course, John knows you. He knows how you are when you meet someone. "Nice person" isn't something you deduced from your first meeting with Mary Watson. But then again, you don't exactly want to tell John what you saw this afternoon: a brave but unhappy woman doing her best, loving and natural towards her child and husband, dealing with what life throws at her like it must be dealt with, energetic, positive, but, ultimately, alone: and all the information you have on her, and which you had even before meeting her, only corroborates your observations.
His gesture stuns you. A memory of a white sheet, a nightmare, and Sherlock poking you at night to help you feel better flashes in your mind. "I know. It's fine."
"Irene? Irene Adler?"
(See the end of the chapter for
Mrs. Hudson serves the tea in prudent silence. Mary frowns. "John, am I eating too much?"
Sherlock blinked, marveling at the tiny black signs on the screen. Sure, John had said "I'm in love with Sherlock" and "I love you in any form" the previous night, but this was different. It was a direct confession – the very first confession Sherlock ever received.
Sebastian let himself fall back on the sofa and watched Sherlock.
Mike looked at her strangely. "But they do get along, though."
"He could have sacrificed lives."
You stepped closer. Her grip tightened on her glass, hand shaking slightly .
John took a deep breath and entered the living-room. He froze. Sherlock was sitting, back to John, facing the windows and absorbed in the contemplation of an old battered hat that lay on the low table. It was snowing outside, and the room was grey and silent. John's heart clenched and he bit his lips as the loneliness radiating from the scene hit him. He felt the urge to run to Sherlock and hug him and say: "Merry Christmas!"
"Stop being so obvious."
"I don't know."
Lestrade shook his head. "But he's right, you know. What good does it do now?"
They were as cold as ice.
He went to the window and looked out in the street absent-mindedly. There had to be something. Something he could do for John. The piece of paper with the little dancing men was still lying on the living-room table next to John's laptop. Sherlock knew he'd have to take care of it sooner or later. This wasn't something to give John, but it was necessary to ensure his safety. Sherlock didn't feel like playing with Moriarty at all – he wanted to crush the man. This was a little game his archenemy had set to have his own fun while he "watched him dance". He clenched his fists.
You can still hear her laugh now, as clear as a bell. Not a chuckle or a giggle, but a real laugh, blunt and artless.
She blinks and turns to you with bewilderment before bursting out laughing. Every time she sits there smoking at night, you find her dazzling. Always you fear she might fall.
The detective was so startled by his flatmate's outburst that he did get off at once, and sat in front of him with pleading eyes. John looked away and took his phone. Sherlock groaned.
"Of course. Cheers!"
Sherlock extended a hand under the bed in an attempt to catch the stout and plushy animal, pulling it back again with a cry of protest as the ridiculously sharp teeth bit him.
Sherlock observed the manul for a while, his gaze intense, before sitting down abruptly. John started.
'Yes, indeed, my bonny lassie,' said the Brooklet. 'They glint on my banks at night. Paddle about, and maybe you'll find one.'
Your eyes widen. God, will this man never let you breathe? "What?"
And then Moriarty had to go and tell him what Sherlock's true intentions were. It made the detective wonder what the criminal could have possibly told his friend before Sherlock even got there. What sick games had he been playing on his mind? Sherlock had been too scared to ask John until now, but knew he would eventually have to find out.
...the question might as well be reversed, though. Since when had
"Mmm... not sure. Let's see." And teasingly, he gave Sherlock a peck on the nose. The taller man growled and bit John's lower lip, making him gasp. He grabbed the leash and pulled John in for a wild, inflamed kiss. His firm grip on the nape of John's neck, his hips bucking slyly against John's erection, his tongue piercing him almost pushed the poor doctor over the edge.
She looked like a kicked puppy. Irene caressed her cheek and patted it.
After he'd lit the last candle, he turned off the light and admired their living-room, which was truly transfigured by the soft glow. John beamed.
The iron fist he receives on his nose cuts him short and he screams in surprise.
ordinary. Sherlock found everything about the animal so endearingly odd: his round eyes circled by concentric white and black rims, his very short legs, his low and widely set ears and his unusually short claws. Just priceless, he thought. If he'd believed in God, he would have thought that God had created the manul to boost every other animal's self-esteem. Or maybe so people like Sherlock, so practical and who never bothered with plushy toys, would finally understand their appeal. For some unfathomable reason he loved the flattened face and shorter jaw, which had fewer teeth than any other cat's – it was all so
He did, however, follow Mycroft's advice. The two brothers were very different in some ways, but their advice being sensible was definitely a common quality. Like that one time when Mycroft simply called to inform him that the policeman who had started working at the Met in April 2012 and who was of German descent was a hitman. From anybody else, Greg would have laughed it off. But naturally, it turned out Big Brother had been right. And so expectedly, he had been right about John Watson as well.
. His
What's the point of hiding one shirt if you show that you've kept perfectly preserved all the rest of the wardrobe?
"I want you," he corrected precipitately. He felt himself blush with shame, hating to sound so bestial in front of his ethereal, intellectual partner, but he forced himself to keep his head up, and to look Sherlock in the eye.
He walked backwards, spinning his cane in his right hand, letting himself fall back on the armchair, and spread his legs with the cane, running the stick up and down his inner thighs, as if tracing them with a brush.
You let out a broken chuckle. The warmth of John's hands on your back is spreading to your entire body. His smell is enveloping you. The smell of his room is shrouding you. You feel swaddled by his presence as his hands roam your back, gradually covering every inch of your skin, and you wonder how he could possibly be closer than this. You try to imagine what it would feel like if he were truly making love to you, and fail. There is a sense of respect and a selflessness in his touch that render it all the more powerful – irresistible.
"It's such a pedestrian way to get off, really," the consulting criminal had teased. "It's just like sex."
"Greg..." John mutters. So he calls him Greg now. Did he, before Sherlock left? Sherlock cannot remember.
"Wait!" she hears behind her, but pays it no heed. She runs on and on and realizes with a pang of guilt that she is still wearing his coat. She should have given it back before fleeing. What if he's cold? What if he

"Cabs freak me out now with your cases..." she mumbles.

"You... have no idea what you're talking about..."

He put his hand on Sherlock's thigh, digging his fingers in.

When they arrived at the house, Hilton was already back from his ride. He sent them a funny look, but did not make any remark on their dishevelled clothes.
Sherlock nodded.

Their gazes locked. Irene took her time. She drank a sip of wine, put down her glass, her eyes never leaving Sherlock's.
"Sherlock..." John murmured, giving a little pressure to his shoulder.
He nods. Looks away. "Playing with Moriarty was one option. The first option. Playing against him. A good old villain against the hero. But I was never a hero. I was never a good person."
"Uh...?" John emitted, crazed with need.
Hence John's panic, overriding his fury and his shock – and yes, he had been shocked to see his friend shatter to pieces under the touch, gaze and above all,

She blinks and turns to the stranger who has just spoken. He's rather tall, blond, with brown eyes. Good looking. He smiles.
He started as he felt Mrs. Hudson's hand on his arm. His eyes shifted to her, but he barely registered her presence. All he could read on her face was concern. Why was she concerned? There was nothing to be concerned about now. It was too late.
"For you, you big idiot! Sherlock, you can be such a fool. Your brother loves you. You have no idea how much he loves you."

"Sherlock,  I'm in love with you!" John suddenly burst out, now clearly exasperated  with his friend's attitude and utter lack of tact.

Smiling, you peck her on the cheek and get the suitcase for her. "The best would be for you to stop smoking you know. Your health?"
"Thanks, Sherlock, shut up now, don't get into deeper water."
"Or maybe... Do you think you need to cuddle with someone else?" Sherlock asked hesitantly.
Their eyes meet and a second later they break into a fit of giggles. The comparison was so silly and so true all at once that it was just hilarious. Once they've calmed down, Molly stands up and says:
The doctor opened his eyes and fixed his partner's opalescent ones, frowning slightly.
"We have more time than that. We're not expected before 7."
"Really? The hair, perhaps?"
"Why is Whewell more useful than Hume?" John asks, and you can once again focus on what he is asking rather than feel awkward about his touch.
What he could be though was the long-suffering, supportive, protective friend, and he vowed to never, ever fail him. Fanning and spreading his fingers, he followed the body contours around the lower back, hips and thighs, sweeping his hands upwards and outwards, shaping them to the curves of the flesh (or, rather,

"Well, the situation itself is fairly simple." His voice was already full of excitement. "For clarity, let's call A the one who wrote the letter – for Anonymous; M the one who committed the murder – because it
"You always wake up before me when we... Oh God did
John felt his heart clench at the words, and he hugged his friend tighter. But Sherlock suddenly swooped on him and impaled him with his tongue. John squirmed and moaned under the onslaught, but soon surrendered. Just as he did though, the detective broke the kiss and looked him in the eye, frowning in childish discontent.
"So... It's tomorrow, isn't it." He didn't even bother hiding the affirmative tone.

"Hello, Sherlock. Dr. Watson. How have you been?" Mycroft inquired in an unctuous tone.
Mrs. Hudson gets up to pour the boiled water in the tea pot. Mary loves to have her fussing over her and John.
"Of course I want to take you, you idiot. But..."
"What? Why? What did I say?"
"I did sell him. I sold Sherlock to Jim Moriarty."
"You know, just while away the time. Isn't that what we all do?"
Slowly, a small, small smirk made its way to Sherlock's face.
"John."
Sherlock, listen to me. So what if Moriarty knows you have a mind palace? Obviously he would. And what if he can enter it? You're still the master of the ship. He can look around all he wants, it doesn't mean he won't get lost or that you cannot completely change the way things appear, juggle with images and memories and recreate time and space to your fancy – it's yours, and you've got nothing to hide or to be ashamed of. You're twisted and gorgeous and bloody brilliant – if your mind palace had just been a simple map inside your head, Moriarty may have had complete control over it, provided he knew this unchanging map. But it isn't. It's always moving, evolving, it's
It starts raining. Sherlock's body gets warmer. Soon it is even burning under your hand. Your kisses are hungry, desperate, begging to be reciprocated. And because it is your dream, they are. When you enter him the heat becomes almost unbearable, the grass turns to flames – or fiery flowers, perhaps? In the distance you catch a glimpse of a sunflower.

"Didn't he know yours?"
"Once," Mycroft went on, apparently ignoring her, "he asked me if I thought there was something wrong with us."
Yngvar gulped and complied shakily, looking out of the window, trying to catch a glimpse of the sniper.
Their eyes locked. Slowly, he saw the tide rising within her pupils, waves of disgust and anger and... scorn. Her face broke into a rictus.
Sherlock swallowed. "Why did you do it, John?" he asked so lowly his friend could barely hear him. "You said you enjoyed it, but... Why did you do it?"
"Sorry dear, I'll talk to you later. Thank you for the tea!"

"Well, it cost him his life. Just like the others. Joseph Openshaw didn't like James Calhoun, but would never suspect him of murder – not even his wife's, although he must have been aware of his hatred for black people. Calhoun must have met him on Portsdown Hill and pushed him over the chalk-pit. As for John... "
"Great. So you're going to slice me to pieces?"
"That didn't taste very grass-like to me," he remarked when they parted, his tone playful.
"Yes. But he was my friend, too."
It had been theirs.
He caught a glimpse of stupefaction and...
It was raining again outside. The lights were getting scarcer as they drove on into the night. The cabbie was still listening to the radio.
a murder, so there is a murderer; and V the victim, Brad Campbell. On the day before the murder, the police receives a letter indicating that V has contacted A and asked A to kill V in a certain manner, described in the letter. On the day of the murder, the police indeed finds V dead, having been killed as described in the letter. Consequently the police concludes that A = M - the person who wrote the letter is the killer.
"I loved it."
"Preparing breakfast I mean!" Sherlock added precipitately, realizing the ambiguity of what he'd just said.
!" he stammered. Sherlock smiled and kissed his way up to his lover's belly. He located the conception vessel meridian in the middle of John's abdomen, and from there could find all the points intersecting the chong mai meridian.
"What do you mean?"
The consulting detective glared, but it only made him look more eatable. John averted his gaze again. He really was doomed.
"When can he get paternity leave?"
"Yes," Victor replied simply, but it did nothing to abate John's anger.
The younger Holmes froze. Then he sneered.
a man to boot – and that was overly confusing too.
"Well, anyway. I can do it if you want."
"Then sex and romance are no different. I told you, those are
"Not exactly how I would've described myself, but..."
"Who is he?"
"No. It's OK."
Oh. Right. This Thursday is Harry's thirty-eighth birthday.
Yeah. OK, OK. And why would you listen to me? I'm just your friend. - I don't have
Sherlock nodded. "Yes. That's the problem."
Sherlock just turned his head the other way.
And so he had invited you to die along, or fall down to hell: "Y
Dazed from the kiss, John barely had time to register what had just been said before Sherlock's mouth fell to his left nipple and his hand sneaked down and grabbed his balls, pulling none too gently.
"Here is the room," you say as you enter it. Sebastian looks round.
You threw them away?"
"Thank you, John. You're a real friend. I'm really glad I met you, y'know that? So please no hard feelings. Pals, yeah?"
"Is this
"But then—"
"Excuse me?"
"Statim flavit mea locum, Sherlock!"
John groaned.
The two men who had just entered the hotel lunch room were dressed as tourists. They belonged to the last type –
"What?"
As the words dawned on him, John's eyes widened. His vision blurred a little, although no tears came out – he wasn't on the verge of crying; just of falling even deeper in love with his friend, if that was even possible.
"Miss Danes, I know exactly what key it is, and so do these gentlemen. May I please have the cards now?"
"I am excited!" she asserts, so loudly several other clients turn to you. To be fair, you're quite used to that by now. She doesn't even blush, and doesn't seem embarrassed in the least.
"Yes, but it could be important."
happen every time?"
They still did not look convinced. Sherlock could not understand why it wasn't evident to them that Henry didn't have the profile to be the killer. They were just ignoring everything he pointed out because it didn't fit their nice little theory, but they were
"I'm sorry I haven't been calling or writing."
"I recommend you be a little more cooperative, Mr. Breckinridge. Do you remember a middle-aged man with grizzled hair and a hat to whom you sold a goose on Christmas Eve?"
"He would have died."
"Oh." Sherlock fell silent again. This was... good. If John was truly willing to discuss things, it should be... good. "What did you want to talk about?"
What could have brought Sherlock – no,
H.O.M.E.
Her roar echoes in the room and the two siblings have a staring contest – Harry's heated glare against John's dull gaze. He wins.
"I printed all of them out. The smileys," Hilton suddenly said as the house came into view. "Here."
"Why?"
He stopped the water of the shower. There was no use moping about it. He was still confused as hell, but it hadn't been his intention to confuse Sherlock. Yet how would he not be, when even John didn't know what he wanted?
Even if you look up all these people, how are you supposed to make sense of this? Obviously, Sherlock had never written in the idea that someone, other than himself, would ever read him.
"I cannot imagine she put it quite like that," he replied icily. "BPD is hardly a psychosis, Sergeant." She shrugged, but had the decency to blush a bit. It didn't look good on her.
"If I had known how engrossed in it you'd be, I would've never bought you that guitar," you say as you come back into the living-room.
John stood up and walked to the door.
flat!" she told you. That's true. These past few months, you haven't been using your old room at all. It could easily become Blake's, eventually.
"But in fact, no one's really normal around you. Lestrade is a crazy enough D.I. to ask for your help on cases and for following you all the way to Dartmoor. Mrs. Hudson puts up with you and can fool CIA agents. Molly Hooper enjoys working at the morgue even more than playing with her cat and falls only for madmen. I'm not even going to start on the subject of Mycroft or Irene Adler – not to mention Moriarty's obsession with you. As for myself... I get off on danger and am addicted to the thrill you give me. I'm not even gay and yet I always put you before my girlfriends. I ignore body parts and clean up the remains of failed experiments while I eat my toast in the morning. I work at the clinic in the day as I answer your texts and do research for you, that is, when I'm not ditching the job altogether or sleeping off the previous night. I come home for tea and force you to eat as if I were your babysitter and not your flatmate, follow you on crime scenes, watch crap telly and write on my blog before running around London after criminals – or pursued by them. If I wasn't living with you, I'm sure I'd be the madman in the house."
"Yes, he is," Mary comments absent-mindedly. John is a soldier. Sometimes she has a hard time picturing him on the front; but then some other times, she doesn't find it hard to imagine at all.
"I won't see you tomorrow. I'm staying with Maggie until the 27th. We're going to her sister's tomorrow, remember? I told you that, too."
turned into: he did not look silly or grotesque or pathetic. The worst he could get was to appear
"Time. With me."
"Sorry..."
"What are you thinking about?" Sherlock asked in a small voice, feeling John's heart pounding against him.
He felt something deep inside him break with a snap – and then it was gone, just like Harry slamming the door in her wake.
It didn't cross his mind that filling his stomach with Earl Grey-flavoured caffeine, milk, and sugar, mightn't be the best idea either. It wasn't much later when he began to feel heartburn and retched, that he knew something wasn't sitting well.
"Sherlock is dead. There's no reason anyone would want to target us," you concede. "Maybe I'm just imagining things and panicking for nothing, but... You know. Old habits die hard."
"Right. You have a manul. Great. You do know it's not legal to keep one as a pet, don't you?"
The rain keeps pouring on you, and you can hardly make out his silhouette at all. But you remember where his grave is. You should have told the cabbie to wait for you, you realize. You have no idea how you will get home. You did not take your phone with you.
"Why are you doing this?"
"Do you mean the landing?" Sherlock inquires lightly.
"Sherlock. Look at me." His voice was gentle and his tone self-possessed. Sherlock was hanging his head, but hearing that voice compelled him to comply.
Her day had been bad, but now that she had vented her frustration she felt empty. She wanted to know how John was doing. How
Greg had panicked the first time John had admitted to his feelings for Sherlock so openly, fearing he would start to cry and the situation would become out of control. But John hadn't cried. He'd kept a sad smile on his face for the rest of the evening, and Greg hadn't dared mention girlfriends again.
"Well, that's... unexpected."
. He was getting more irritated by the second.
You take another sip of tea, feeling your throat tighten.
"Um, who's crazy again?" Greg asks.
John shivered at the lifeless voice. Sherlock must have been deep in thoughts – and apparently not good ones. He shrugged at his friend's question.
But Jim's henchman? He should have known by now. He should have been able to understand the sniper. But he did not. He simply did not.
You stare. Your brain has stopped functioning. You simply stare. Sherlock. It really is Sherlock. Seb is speaking again, but you barely register. You look at him, then at Sherlock again. Sherlock.
"I'm not actually homeless!" Shinwell protests, "I just... like the street. Old habits die hard, you know."
"Look, this just isn't the right time!"
"Yes you are. This is your way of saying "I don't have friends", "Nobody loves me"."
did not sound like a good idea for someone who was so unfamiliar with 'mornings after'. But having seen the jumper, John
Had he seriously just been embarrassed by
John smiled and kissed his way down to the area he was massaging, pressing his lips to the left hipbone, the coccyx, the right buttock, the left one... As he went back up again and traced the pelvic bone with kisses, his touch sent jolts of electricity throughout Sherlock's body at first, then shivers and waves of soft, gentle pleasure that went straight to his groin.
But Mrs. Hudson has already seen them, and Greg, following her gaze, turns around and stares. You can tell from the look on his face that his eyes have met Sherlock's.
"You hair... It's dishevelled. You can't look cool like that."
"My wife! First you wrote all this nonsense about a string of lovers on your stupid blog and I did not even know someone was defaming my wife on the web! Oh, but I couldn't believe it was her, and it was all so childish on your part that I thought I'd just let you off with your little cases told like bloody adventures when my wife had just been murdered. But then that bloody detective of yours is proved to be a fake and kills himself, and I wonder: how could that blogger of his not be in the know? You planned the murder of my wife and you-"
"This is boring, John. Find another topic of conversation."
WHAT A HORRIBLE MAN.
"Can we have the bill, please?"
"Actually, I'm good here too," Sherlock mumbled, wrapping himself around John and feeling the warmth. John smiled and stroked the back of his head.
"Of course not," John replied bitterly, standing straight and stiff, hating Sherlock for being so oblivious, hating himself for being so foolishly jealous.
can provide him with. You are smart enough to do that right, actually. You're so good at observing and deducing people that there is no reason you shouldn't know exactly what he desires even before
Sherlock simply smiled.
Sherlock arched an eyebrow at Mrs. Leverton, who seemed torn between exasperation and amusement. But it was with a perfectly polite and friendly smile that she replied, quietly but with no theatrics, "I believe we still have some. I may be able to give one to your wife if you send her to my room some time tomorrow. In fact, tell her I'm inviting her for tea. Can you wait until then?"
John arched an eyebrow. "The lap dance?" He couldn't believe they were having this conversation in
The spell was broken the moment Sherlock's hands left his torso. John groaned discontentedly at the loss. Suddenly Sherlock's tongue was running over John's mouth and his lips parted unabashedly, craving the touch – and a deeper contact. But the tongue retreated deviously, leaving John thirsting. The ex-soldier let his head fall back onto the pillow with a moan, defeated.
"Sorry man, she's taken."
This time she put down her magazine and fixed her gaze on her husband.
"...and I can hunt, too!"
John glanced at the book on his desk and nodded. "No. I don't."
"Anderson in a bathing suit."
"Sherlock, it's me. It's John. Can you hear me?"
Absolutely. Irreversibly.
"Lovely painting you've got here."
"You're... don't tell me you're Sherlock's
"What?" he asked, listening carefully.
"I know you want to be punished."
If Sherlock couldn't delete John himself, he found he could delete the links. Just like Moriarty's web: the network between the memories, what bound them to emotions. The
"Please... I can't... No more..."
Irene took out her phone. Her fingers ran over the keyboard smoothly, French manicured nails never in the way.
people?
"Did you enjoy it?"
John felt his heart clench at the words, and he hugged his friend tighter. But Sherlock suddenly swooped on him and impaled him with his tongue. John squirmed and moaned under the onslaught, but soon surrendered. Just as he did, though, the detective broke the kiss and fixed his gaze on him, frowning in childish discontent.
...Did
Not to the one he would like, I'm afraid."
"Oh please, Sherlock, turn back now! I don't want to leave you here but I will have no choice! Please transform back."
Suddenly standing up, he signified to the weird guy that he wanted to pass to go to the toilets, thrusting his chin forward contemptuously. The man blinked, looked up at him, and smiled. Then he closed his eyes and leant back in his seat as if he were in the deepest slumber.
"I wanted to go to China."
"No... Look, I..."
"Wait, are you serious?"
"You feel my hands, John?"
Lestrade. It wasn't the first time he'd snapped at the man. So why had John been so angry? He was usually upset when he was a prick with Mrs. Hudson or Molly, and Sherlock thought of it as John's natural gallantry. But he didn't usually get so irritated from Sherlock just refusing a case.
When John came back downstairs an hour later, Sherlock was on the couch, his violin by his side, holding a cup of yellowish liquid and drinking through a straw, empty-faced. As John entered the room, his eyes lit up. The doctor sent him a weak smile and Sherlock scoffed. He put his glass down and picked his violin, pulling the strings tentatively, faking confidence.
The murder rate kept decreasing, though. There had been only two victims this month. Well, "
"And do you think I am?"
, he thought, and he had the urge to see the tiger vulnerable and purring under his hand. He shook his head, trying to get a grip. What was
? John couldn't wrap his mind around it. He still felt dazed when Sherlock stood up abruptly, keeping the manul in his arms.
Of course you and her answered simultaneously.
"It blinds you," he finally let out in a whisper, "it blinds you, but it clears my mind. I told you already. You are unbeatable as a conductor of light."
It's fine! If you're telling me, there must be a problem, right? If you want to get a divorce because you don't love me anymore, fine. But if it's just because you got pregnant and the other person isn't ready to face this or something, I... What I'm trying to say is that... Well, it doesn't matter. Whose it is. I'm happy with you. I don't mind if–"
John blinked, lost.
Hilton looked around confusedly, in shock. He was trembling, trying to look for a phone as if there would be one in this room. John growled, annoyed, and muttered:
"You assume?" Mycroft echoed in what could only be teasing, and John wondered, not for the first time, whether both men enjoyed antagonizing each other or if they just did it out of habit.
"Mycroft is an idiot because he cares and will not admit it," she says. Mary tilts her head to the side. "You see, he wants to believe he is cold-blooded and heartless – impervious to
As he serves himself a cup of tea, he thinks idly that he wouldn't go for a married woman, period. Except, maybe, if it were the love of his life. He laughs a little bitterly: can't say he's expecting that any time soon.
"I'm afraid mine are a bit rotten by now."
He was cut off as the chunky cat started rubbing its forehead gingerly on Sherlock's leg, so softly he only sensed the fur stroking him through the fabric.
"I'm sorry, John, but we don't have all night – you must have some time to sleep, it's the whole point after all."
Clapham Common is so big a park you can easily spend an entire day strolling through it. It is only morning, and John doesn't intend to walk all day: but he still enjoys the quietness and the cold winter air. He always believed a walk had to be brisk and invigorating. One month after he woke up in hospital and started living with his sister, he has recovered enough (physically, anyway) to resume his walking habit. Harry moved in with Chris in early September, and is now all settled in a rather large flat with two bedrooms near Clapham South Station. Chris had grown up there with her parents, who moved to their country house after retirement. As he walks past the disused bomb shelters and the tennis courts towards the West side, John thinks his parents would have been retired by now, too. It's a disturbing thought.
The tiger groaned in dismay. It left the clothes there and limped to Sherlock's room, jumping onto the bed and rolling on its back. It sent John a look. John just goggled.
"With all due respect, sir ..." he began.
"No it's not! They were... They should have... Oh this is so frustrating."
"You've been paying attention to me all night long," he concluded. …
Lestrade. I've been summoned. Coming? - If you want me to. - Of course. I'd be lost without my blogger.
"No."
As he threw up the rest of what was left in his stomach, John kept gasping. His hands were trembling with something akin to horror and disgust, and all in all Sherlock could not decipher whether he was experiencing upset digestion or a panic attack. He brought his other hand to John's front and rested it on his chest, trying to help him regulate his breathing. But this only seemed to make John even more disgusted and soon Sherlock knelt back, befuddled. So he really was the cause of all this?
This was the sign that Moran had started the last act. The sign that everything had been set in motion.
She glared a few more daggers at him before resuming her search. Finally, she seemed to have found what she was looking for. She stared at the emerald earrings, apparently lost in thought.
"I'll just get you some cat biscuits at the supermarket, I was going to do my shopping this morning anyway."
"What? Wait! Where are you going? Just... what the
"Yes, of course."
?" you echo with amusement. "I can tell you're close friends now."
And so he'd let Lestrade get to John and bring the doctor back to Baker Street. In fact, his coming had served his purpose: there was no denying now that his little brother had become pathetically dependent on John's presence – or even just the idea of his presence, the certitude that he'd always come back.
The consulting detective turned this in his mind for a second before grasping the meaning of it.
"And John, too," Mike went on, apparently getting more and more embarrassed as the awkward quietness stretched on, and keen to say something. "His wife is lovely. I know they're planning on getting a divorce, but..."
"John."
"That's too bad. Guess we'll have to bleach it again and dye it blue when you get back."
"A kiss."
Glasses clinked and hands touched.
say you begged him twice."
"You owe me," the man continued, his voice calm but firm.
he only had to lean in a little to get closer, just a bit closer... Then he remembered he was a manul and jumped back in horror, letting out a heart-rending whine.
"Don't get me wrong," Mary added, seeing her face. "We love each other dearly. And he's the best man I've ever met."
"There."
As if reading his thoughts (and maybe he was), Sherlock's fingers on John's chest ran all the way up to his scar and the bleeding cut under the stitches, caressing them so lightly at first it felt like a feather, then adding more pressure, mixing pain and pleasure. John pondered whether a violin would have felt so utterly denuded and vulnerable, had it possessed a nervous system. He had the confusing impression of being a mere instrument under Sherlock's touch, and wondered absent-mindedly if that was because he knew that his partner, unlike all the women who had touched his scar (and many had, in fact, avoided it) would remember every cluster of scar tissue and collagen fibre, every unintended shiver, jerk and moan that he couldn't control.
"Yes, enough!" cried Sherlock as John's jumper grazed against his nipples and his firm, muscular thigh was pressed against his pounding penis. He meant to say
Unfortunately, yes."
Slowly, he stepped closer to his 'flatmate', playing with the gun he was still holding in his right hand and ignoring the pain radiating from his left shoulder. He stopped and aimed the gun at Moriarty's head.
"What?"
"No, but–"
"Please tell Mycroft I won't start giving him Christmas phone calls either. Have a nice day."
He felt Sherlock take his hand and squeeze it none too gently.
Aw, real one?"
"Do you want one?"
"Quite well, Mrs. Palmer."
"Dr.  Watson!" Mycroft greeted with one of his perfunctory smiles. "How ave  you been doing lately? Not so well, I presume. Well, have a seat, make  yourself at home."
"Leaving already?"
"Yes?"
"Yes, that's what I said."
"What would yours be?" Sherlock asked, slightly puzzled by his friend's laughter.
But they were too far apart and he couldn't make out what the other man was saying through the storm – and when did
‘You’re thinking that Mrs Leverton ordered something to be brought to her room, and that the murderer was the person to bring it to her.’
"I'm not angry."
John was about to say that wasn't what had shocked him, but now that Sherlock mentioned it, it was a little... unexpected. But of course Sherlock would have had friends. Everybody did, at some point. Right?
"How do you know?" he inquired, his eyes filled with wonder – and probably admiration, too.
"No, no!" Sherlock exclaimed in not-his-voice – he hated that voice, an old man's voice, a crooked old man's voice, a cripple's. "That's not why I came." Not that it mattered now. "Just wanted to give you back your wallet." He should have slipped a note in it. No. Useless. John would have needed the shock of seeing him, Sherlock, in order to believe Seb was bad news. "I'll go now." There was nothing else to do.
"John."
"Nngh..."
"Hey, Molly. It's been a while. Is everything all right?"
Killing him would be so easy right now. It would make things so simple...
... whispered an evil little voice
"It really isn't. This isn't just dating, you see. I have
"But John..."
"The mug. Oh sorry, you were talking about the book, of course–"
"Are you still sleeping?"
Sherlock turned to the open door. Stepped towards it.
They waited until the afternoon to go back to Emily's house, and the young woman seemed a little too happy to see them again to John's taste. But he'd had a much better day, with Sherlock moping around and hating it, because Sherlock hated waiting, and they didn't have much choice if they wanted to meet the brother.
You close the door to the flat quietly behind you. Your eyes meet the skull and once again it dawns on you all at once. Sherlock is alive. You fall into the armchair.
"Have you told him he moved back to Baker Street?" he said suddenly, ignoring the fact Wiggins was still in mid-sentence. Wiggins rolled his eyes.
"Wh... What are you doing?"
"Are you involved in a romantic relationship with my brother, John?"
"Good, good. And these gentlemen are from the police, I presume?" the man asked, eyeing their suitcase with some confusion.
"Can we cuddle tonight?" he inquired.
Mrs. Leverton smiled.
‘But—’
"Your supposition is correct."
Victor shrugged again.
This probably wasn't the right thing to say, for Sherlock seemed appalled at the thought. Soon horror and disdain were replaced by shame and fear on his face. He looked so distraught John couldn't help but lean in and hug him. He felt the urge to kiss him, and embraced him more tightly so he wouldn't be tempted.
"None of the victims were mothers."
John kisses you again, nuzzling the nape of your neck, and you can feel his smile against your skin. "That was rather the point."
… Right. Whatever they had, it wasn't simple. And it got even worse when Sherlock started to analyze his own situation. He had no idea whether he could give John what he wanted. He'd never asked for a romantic relationship, but he'd been a fool if he hadn't realized that having sex with someone you deeply cared about usually led to just that.
"Of course I am. But why all of a sudden?"
John saw how lost his flatmate was, and was overwhelmed with guilt. Sherlock did not deserve to hear such words hurled to his face just because of him – because he'd been stupid and had angered a woman. Seeing Sherlock's little theatrics, John had been so touched, and so sure this was proof that Sherlock truly cared about him... But hadn't Sherlock said only the Work mattered? These past weeks, however, John had seen him genuinely happy playing with him in manul form. Holding him. Touching his scar.
"Like Ms. Adler perhaps?"
Sherlock understood what she meant when he found himself face to face with two assassins later in the evening. They were idiots, though, and as Moran shot one, the other was distracted and Sherlock easily put a bullet in his head. He'd found that it was by far the best way to off someone: one did not have to see the gaze in their victim's eyes.
Now, on with his role.
"I only have one friend, after all."
"I dreamed that someone died."
Sherlock snorts. "
Sherlock turned the telly on for John, washed the dishes, opened his laptop and scrolled down the pages for him. He made a mental note to buy him a keyboard with larger keys.
This time, it was John's turn to freeze and feel extremely cold.
John gave him a smile, and Sherlock rolled his eyes. Yet somehow, John's presence in the room made Mycroft's a lot more bearable.
"Sherlock, why can you never get such good grades as your brother?"
"Is that all right?" the doctor asked, looking his lover in the eye intensely. "How do you like it?"
Sherlock's eyes widen slightly, but she's already turned away to go get John. "Just put on the headphones and don't close the door!"
"He used to say that a lot, didn't he?"
"I don't see Greg very often, no."
She sent them a friendly smile and went back into the house. Once her steps had subsided, Hilton leant towards Sherlock with an air of secrecy, and whispered.
A pained expression filled Sherlock's face. Moriarty had been right, of course. He couldn't have hurt him otherwise. Sherlock had declared he wasn't interested in sex and relationships, decreeing that it wasn't his area.
The tiger kept his gaze locked on John's for another minute during which John wondered whether he was dreaming. Perhaps he hadn't woken up at all, and was still in his bed having some kind of nightmare. Eventually, the tiger broke eye contact, and resumed his previous posture, head resting on his front paws. John took a step towards him.
John turned round eyes to Sherlock, astounded that he'd just uttered such words. He shook his head.
"Yes, and how many years can a mountain exist,
"We both know you like being in charge and don't get to do it often when you're with me because... well, I like controlling too."
"Yes, I'm coming."
John bit his lips.
The beating of your heart hammers in your ears, deafening. The warmth in the room is making you dizzy.
"What?"
This chapter was kindly betaed by Tigzzz and by Salsify.
... wrongly.
Yes, that sounded like him. That sounded like something he would do. Something symmetrical, something dramatic.
"Just drop it. I've seen enough."
He was interrupted by Sherlock lowering himself and pressing his lips to his promptly, messily, almost missing his mouth and kissing his chin as well.
When he had found out the reason for the murder of Victor's father, he had known that his friend would hate him for it. He had known that telling him would destroy their friendship. And he had known that despite all this, he would still tell him, simply because it was the truth.
John pales and Sherlock glowers. But Seb bursts out laughing with juvenile mirth. "I'm good at imitating him, aren't I? Dear old Jim."
And as she said so, she walked down the last two steps, and past Eliska. Of course, the door leading out of the mansion was also guarded by two other men. Not a problem, though, Irene thought idly.
him. He never replies. - No, Sherlock
"Why do I what?" John presses on.
The curtains were drawn and the bed had been slept in, but there was no trace of his flatmate. Sherlock was getting more concerned – and more curious – by the second. He hadn't heard John go out at all, even though he'd been up most of the night. John could have walked down the stairs while he was taking a nap, but it was highly improbable that the unsleeping detective would have missed the telltale creaking of the steps... Sherlock observed the crumpled sheets for a minute before leaving thoughtfully. He was half-way down the stairs when he stopped dead in his tracks. Hadn't John cut his hair recently?
OoOoO
Playing.

"I feed upon it and extinguish it"
"You are in no position to refuse me."
OK, I'm doomed; it seems that I just can't write short chapters anymore. This is silly. When I think my first chapters were around 2,000 words... Anyway, I truly hope you enjoy reading this chapter – as much as it can be enjoyed. Special thanks to all reviewers – you have no idea how much I appreciate your taking time to leave comments. Well. Actually, I'm sure you do :)
"Is that so? Then I wonder why it isn't him sitting here in your place."
"Yes it does! You've got to flesh out a bit!"
"Is this the eating problem again? Look, I told you: this is for your health. You're perfect. You don't need to put on weight aesthetically speaking, I'm just..."
"Oh God I've gone bonkers."
"So... Why did you introduce me to these people, Seb?" he asked. "I mean they're nice and all, but you've never introduced me to anyone. I didn't even know you had friends."
but as you got used to it you began to like it very much. The way he asked so directly about things he didn't understand, such as proper behaviour, like a defiant child who keeps asking questions about the world but whose tone is always half-accusing.
"How very romantic of you."
"Shh," she soothed, putting her finger on his lips. "Now you're more broken than believing in a higher instance."
She smirked as she turned back to him.
Of course it isn't only that. There's Mary too. The apples. Questions that Greg cannot answer, but to which Mycroft,
Exhausted, he fell in the only chair in the room, an armchair, and noted that it wasn't as comfortable as the one in 221B. Not that he would ever sit in it again.
blood. Jumping to his feet he charged out of the kitchen and burst in on a still sleeping John. Grabbing him by the arm, he turned him on his back. His eyes widened at the sight of the scar and stitches. He started shaking him.
Sherlock smiled up to him.

"Finished?" he asked. John nodded. Sherlock put the plate and bowl away. "I'll take a shower."
"...So?"
"Oh you..."
"This phone call it's, uh... It's my note. That's what people do, don't they? Leave a note."
"You mean with the guitar?"
As Sherlock leans down, looking over the edge of the roof to the ground below, Jim keeps mimicking his moves and leans in too.
After he's done having a wash, John decides to tidy his room. Newspapers are still lying around, even if he tried to set in order his few possessions some weeks ago. Tidying up isn't part of the routine, but sometimes he just feels like it and takes the opportunity to clean up the whole place perfectly. It doesn't take much time – not as much as cleaning 221B would have taken in any case - but it still delays his morning walk and when he finally goes out, it is already noon.
John hung up and sighed.
"We're going to need to coordinate."
He feels very awkward at first, and barely looks the barman in the eye when ordering his drink. The very idea of a gay bar means you're looking for a partner, whether it's for a long-term relationship or just a quick fuck. Not because it's a
"I won't be able to help you if you're so guarded, John."
Sherlock had groaned, pressing John closer to make his point. Having John in him was ridiculously comfortable. Moreover, Sherlock was well aware that moving and losing John's warmth inside of him would inevitably lead to acute pain eventually, and he wasn't very keen on feeling that any time soon.
As John bent down to pick up his filled plastic cup, he noticed a man had come up behind him, and for some reason he couldn't quite explain, his scent seemed familiar, although John could not place it. He stood back up, and turned to leave.
"Oh, it doesn't matter to me, dear. I'm sure Sherlock is delighted. Where has he gone off to on Christmas? Don't tell me he's got a case."
John wakes up in the night. Just like that, out of the blue. He's not gasping, nor panting, nor trembling. It's not a nightmare. Why did he wake up?
Sherlock deepened the kiss. His luscious lips were soft at first but then turned gluttonous and utterly began to devour him. John moaned as they moved on to his cheek, his chin and his throat, swabbing, nibbling,
"Nothing, just... I'll call you back."
"I just came back from a night outing in a cemetery, drenched, and am being blow-dried by..." You waver, then finish awkwardly, "my flatmate.".
"Enough of your theatrics, Seb. Do not make me lose patience with you."
PS. Got something
"I want you to come back to London and to take up your job again."
"Nothing. Ignore me. I'm in shock."
"But you never... Oh, never mind. I'm not really hungry. Just order whatever you want."
The taller man did not answer. His eyes were blazing, reflecting the fires. Mirrors. Sebastian lit up a cigarette and dragged on it.
That was uncalled for and he knows it. Harry's been doing her best for him, and he is very well aware that she hasn't had a drop of alcohol since... since. He should be able to formulate this, even mentally.
He stepped back and looked his partner in the eye, a smile on his lips.
You laugh and rest your brow against his shoulder. "Yes, it is. Just get into the water."
Soon enough Sherlock had realized that he did not like upsetting John in any way. Always it elicited a complementary response on his part, just as negative: guilt, shame, embarrassment, annoyance. Always mild feelings, of course. But apart from Mycroft, who was unbeatable in the field of irritating Sherlock, John was the only one who could elicit such responses. Irene Adler had confused him. Mrs. Hudson was capable of making him feel sheepish, but it wasn't frequent. Lestrade could annoy him, but Sherlock knew how to retaliate, and often the D.I. relented because, after all, he truly needed his services.
"I was just trying to make up for that idiot's blunder. It is necessary that we spend the day with Elsie Cubitt."
Mrs. Hudson stared at him. Worry filled her face.
Sherlock smiled up contentedly as he stood, and replied: "Perhaps."
, not misting over, but truly
"Oh God," you murmur, as if realizing only now what is happening. You squeeze his hand in yours, desperately, elatedly. Sherlock is alive.
"I am perfectly fine, thank you."
"Nobody could be that clever."
When Sherlock opened his eyes, the first thing he saw was a brownish, appetizing nipple mere inches from his face. He blinked, and did the only natural thing to do: he kissed it.
"Well why don't we try and see?"
"Well, you
"Destroy them."
"Yes. What was that all about? And why was Abby Slaney in Elsie's room last night?"
you, John, you're not
am going to kill
"Probably when I get back."
"Yes, Ms. Cyclamen! Of course..."
, and from two songs:
It hurt, but John knew he'd deserved it. Clearly, both his attitude and now his running away were upsetting Sherlock. He pictured him in tiger form, and it was almost enough to make him drop the wine and offer to get some Chinese take-away. But he couldn't stand Maggie up now – and he wasn't
"Meow..."
"I know..."
"Technically I didn't–"
The police don't consult amateurs.
John wasn't sure Sherlock could read his thoughts. But perhaps he did, for the tiger stood up, grinning, and jumped off the bed to walk to the door. John followed him nimbly and found his body wasn't as clumsy as he'd thought.
"I was just thinking that it'd be funny if Mycroft had left any of his surveillance cameras in the flat."
"But–"
He blushed, avoiding Sherlock's gaze that had been fixed on him, probably analysing his every expression, trying to deduce him. John prayed that he wasn't succeeding.
"I don't understand," the Woman's voice was saying, "why don't you just kill him now that you know what he's up to?"
"But..."
"Goodnight, John. See you tomorrow at the park."
"Yeah, but it's a cartoon chick."
He seemed to be with other people – and an animal, too? Probably a dog. It didn't matter, all that mattered was that you had found him and... Walking up to him, you put a hand on his shoulder, making him turn to you in bewilderment.
"Look, now... I'm sorry the Freak died. Don't give me that look, he was a freak, and I still think he was an insufferable prick. It doesn't mean I wanted him to kill himself."
"And I wanted to apologize to you."
She tilted her head to the side.
Sherlock turned to him with a gleeful grin, his coat hanging loose, his hair more ruffled than ever and his torso gleaming with come. His eyes were sparkling and excited like a child's.
"About yourself, I mean."
"Mmm, I wonder what that says about you, then."
…OK. Not faking it. You would definitely bite if you were awake and I poked your cheek like that.
"Shh... It's fine, John. Please stop feeling so guilty. You never lied to me, never hid the fact that you loved Sherlock. I know. It's all good."
As he spoke, John let his free hand play with Sherlock's earlobe and stroke the soft spot behind it. Sherlock sighed with contentment and nodded.
The dark-haired man smiles, and for the first time you realize how similar his hair is to Sherlock's – especially since he's let it grow. A flash of pain traverses your gaze, and he catches it. Moving closer to you, he asks in a low voice:
But John hadn't said a word. He hadn't left, either. So Sherlock could only find one explanation: he must still be in shock. It must have been more hurtful than insulting. He must be more broken than indignant.
"What risk? Nobody else would have known!"
Sherlock had lied to him that day and told him to spread the word. Was Moriarty there, still alive, his snipers hidden somewhere and forcing Sherlock to tell John whatever the madman asked of him? But what was the point, since he was going to die anyway? Surely he must've known by that point...
"Molly, where are you?"
wasn't coming. The good doctor truly must have been a long-suffering flatmate.
"Did you ever want to?"
"Yes, John?"
"Take me tonight," he whispered against John's lips when they parted.
The doctor shrugged.
You stare.
Having now unbuttoned the striped shirt completely, Sherlock fondled John's torso and lifted it so he could pull his shirt up his arms gently until it was all crumpled around the wrists, by the manacles. John arched his back, more out of excitation than obedience, and it was quite unwitting – he probably had no wit left at all. It was crazy how Sherlock's hands could throw him off balance so badly, making him feel like he'd fallen into another world, somewhere in Wonderland where Sherlock was surrounding him completely with his strokes his scent his voice...
"What does this mean?"
," the ex-soldier continued in the same sultry, ironic tone. "Are you sure you do not want to take
"Lovely. How are Joseph and him doing?"
"Not yet."
The doctor smirked.
"No. But tell me, I'm interested."
"I was surprisingly aroused by the fighting," Sherlock commented to cheer John up. "The jam was unexpectedly pleasant but I'm not sure I would try it again. We could do it with something else, though. There's still the lemon in the fridge."
But the mere sight of food repulses her and she closes the door just as quickly. Damn this all.
"What would you like to do this afternoon?" John asked out of the blue. Sherlock stared.
"I won't experiment if it will jeopardize what we have. Had..." He sighed in frustration. "I don't know where we're standing, John. This... this is new. It's confusing. Not you. Not us."
Sebastian grumbled something about mad geniuses and their bad tempers, but did not press the matter any further.
Howling with pain the dog kept fleeing, until suddenly all became quiet. Sherlock froze in the night. The cold silence dampened his ardour and he stepped carefully to the small, still form lying on the pavement. It was the headless carcass of the dog.
"What?"
He stares.
"Indeed."
Sherlock was thrown off balance by the question and looked at his flatmate with bewilderment.
"See? How could you be any more reliant?"
"Maybe. You see lots of faces in a hotel, Sherlock. You don't remember all of them."
Sherlock nodded as he broke the seal and unfolded the letter.
. They were such trouble. And to think that he'd never married precisely to avoid this kind of situation. He sighed. That idiotic brother of his. Always one to wreak havoc even when he was
"I know. Thanks, Mary."
That had been the worst part of all. Sherlock's strategy had actually been for her
Moriarty's iPhone contains a surprising amount of music files, including songs and pieces. He'd left Rossini's overture there as well – the piece he'd played while breaking into the Tower of London (according to the camera videos in any case). Actually, he'd even configured it to be his morning alarm, something you were quick to change. Wakening was reserved to John.
"Thank you," Victor said pleasantly, taking the mug from John. "Better" was printed on it.
"Indeed. Perhaps you have read about me. I own a chain of luxury hotels in—"
"From the very beginning."
"Every fairytale needs a good old-fashioned villain."
"Um, Sherlock?" he said, panting.
"Meow!" John answered furiously.
"China? What in the world would you want to do in China? And I don't speak Chinese, by the way."
"Keep your eyes fixed on me."
He ran to the window and pulled down the curtains. Then, grabbing the fluffy striped back, he shook the tiger.
, he thought.
6-1-10-5. 61, 105. Geographical coordinates. You stared.
Victor's gaze was intense but inscrutable. John held it firmly. A small smile made its way to the other's face.
She gave him a somewhat wistful smile, but her expression quickly turned cheerful again.
"Why?"
Sherlock sighed with exasperation, trying to hide the unease. And the fear. "What do you want?"
her."
Sherlock stiffened.
"So... Mrs. Hudson came up to eat our toast?"
"Sherlock..."
"How are you doing, John?"
She had frowned. She'd never been good with riddles. As it had turned out, it hadn't been necessary. Jim had continued: "Freedom, Liska! Knowledge. Freedom thanks to knowledge."
Wiggins stood up and silently left the room.
"Yes, I'm a very unfair person."
Soon John was left with nothing on but his boxers. He looked around like an agitated puppy.
"Right. Great. Why China?"
"I got a note, too... I'm guessing this is from..."
"As for the clothes, the question is obvious, isn't it?" Irene Adler went on. Sherlock looked up at her and searched her face.
He looked away and met Mycroft's pointed gaze, which he shrugged off. It struck him that, perhaps, he wasn't the only one who found that John's presence made their interaction easier.
Hence his surprise and emotion when he had heard Sherlock play it in the middle of the night out of the blue, waking him up from a nightmare. At first he had thought he was still dreaming. Then he had remembered he was living with a madman who played the violin at three in the morning on a regular basis. And for once, he had been terribly grateful to him for disrupting his hellish sleep. Since then, he had taken up the habit of replaying the piece mentally each time he woke up from a nightmare. It soothed him and lulled him back to sleep. He rarely got to the 3rd movement, and even when he did, the frenzied tempo still appeased him, because it was so familiar, like an old friend knocking on your door, and ever since Sherlock had played it, John could almost say it felt like home. A home he hadn't had since his childhood.
"Do you always have to speak out of the blue and out of context
We. He'd said
Two. (probably four or five)
at the mortuary, so he knew, he knew I would be intrigued. He knew I would ask. He never intended to leave like that. Of course it worked, I did protest. And I pointed out the obvious: that we didn't know a thing about each other. He knew I would ask that. He'd prepared it all, for better effect. Just so he could recite everything he'd deduced about me already. He did, and then left, quite dramatically. It was all staged; great acting, though." Your brow suddenly clouds. "He always was, wasn't he?"
Mycroft simply smiled at him knowingly, and with those last unsaid words, left the flat. John waited for his steps to die down the staircase. When he heard the front door close, he let himself fall into his armchair, exhausted.
"No, wait! I'm sure it's you!"
However, the smirk doesn't last long, and soon you remember why you had to come all the way to London, which is probably the most dangerous city in the world for you right now. But precisely. You came to pick up something precious you'd rather have on your side – your "pet". Hopefully, your hair colour will have been clear enough – if he didn't get your message, then you have come for nothing, and that was so troublesome you really hope he
"Why are you doing all of this? What is it all for?"
"Here we go. Now, just let me make a call-"
"There's no need. You weren't rude, you were just... not interested."
John leant in and rested his head on Sherlock's shoulder – he stiffened and his grip tensed a little, but he didn't protest. Breathing in the tousled black curls, John stroked his friend's hand soothingly, running circles with his thumb.
"No. He hasn't forgiven you." She brings her cup to her lips and takes a sip. "He never will."
"Her first husband had been reported dead, and she found out he wasn't just after she got married again. As simple as that."
"Everything, John, everything! That's... elementary."
"It?"
"And why didn't Matthew think that he would get killed?" John went on, slowly coming back up to the front, brushing along the quivering arm, playing all the way down to the porcelain skin of the wrist, while his left hand crept back up Sherlock's spine and tugged at the sensitive hair on his nape.
Yes we can.
"Oh. I see. You didn't want to make me feel like I had to move out."
Hel... Oh."
John wondered if he'd been wrong – this scene felt rather familiar too: Sherlock, thinking about a case, and ignoring him, his violin in hand. Something was off, though. The quietness in the flat was almost surreal. Yet John couldn't bring himself to mention Lestrade's call, for he wasn't sure whether he'd been wrong or not: if Sherlock didn't know about Moriarty's little present to the D.I., then he certainly didn't want to tell him. He tried to sound relaxed as he asked:
"Hey, don't you think that's a bit extreme? Just because I killed someone? God knows this isn't the first ti–"
"So... You've been married for a year, and you've come because about a month ago your wife received a strange email with very queer smileys and when you asked her about it jokingly you saw she was very pale and looked utterly terrified, and she deleted the email right away. But since you promised her the day before the wedding that you'd never ask her anything she didn't want to talk about, you didn't press the matter further?"
This of course snapped Sherlock out of his little act and he finally looked up at the sniper, who chose this very moment to turn away and take his jacket.
"Can you look at the road, please?" John groaned as they almost missed a bend.
"Oh I am terribly sorry if I have offended you, I wasn't..."
"Sherlock... Sherlock..."
"What is
"What's wrong?" Sherlock asked.
"Sherlock, wait!"
John held him tighter, pressing their bodies against each other, looking up and pinning Sherlock with his gaze.
Sherlock's blush deepened but he complied, shyly. John parted his thighs even more, eliciting a pleading whine from his throat.
And with those brilliantly unhelpful words, he was out of the room. John sighed.
"So you're married?"
Now the manul shuddered at his partner's tone. What had got into Sherlock? He sounded angry. Truly angry. It was the kind of resentment he usually reserved for Mycroft. They had barely began to talk, but John felt lost already.
The cat rolled its eyes, and successfully escaped Sherlock's grasp, retreating to a far corner of the living-room moodily.
Victor put the skull back in place and took the offered glass of water, but made no sign of sitting down, electing to pace the room instead. His eyes were roaming, taking it all in at leisure. For the first time, John considered the curious gaze of a client like an unbearable breach of privacy.
"Sweetheart, what's wrong?"
"Seriously? God, you're smitten."
And  so he had kept it a secret from his friend and colleague. However, he  knew John's help – his gun, and his talents as a shooter, more precisely  – would be needed eventually. That is why he ignored his texts until  the man he knew to be the killer offered to have a drink at his place,  and they arrived there. At this point, Sherlock texted John the address,  the floor, and even the door number.
John heard a scream and was half aware that it must have been his own as he rode his orgasm until the very end, until all he could feel was wetness in his pants.
That soon he will be a father."
"That's not what I said."
"How am I... What the hell, Mary? How did you know–"
Fortunately (for John anyway), she had laughed it off. Sherlock hadn't.
"Are you waiting for him to send some guys to kidnap you and bring you to Buckingham Palace again?"
... is yours. It's brilliant and extensible and never-ending – a phoenix in flight."
Mary nods. "I've never been close to a dead person. I mean, someone who died. But it feels right to go visit them sometimes, don't you think? Not that Sherlock isn't always there with us, but..."
He suddenly turned and entered a coffee shop. Someone was following him -
"I wished I'd had time to kill him."
He did, didn't he? Then Sherlock should have an accident first – a concussion, and fake amnesia. Even to John. He'd pretend not to remember anything, and after a week or so throw John out of Baker Street.
"You're not eating?"
‘And two brandies for the pretty boys! Can I get you anything else sweetie?’
"She's not my girlfriend!" John snapped. Lestrade's eyes widened. "She dumped me this morning," John added tiredly.
Mary's voice snaps you out of your reminiscence and hits you like a bucket of cold water. How horrible can you be? Her tone is sad, gentle. You lack the strength to lie to her. Maybe you respect her too much for that.
John doesn't notice how much older Mycroft looks. Doesn't notice the bags under his eyes, not even the fact that Sherlock could no longer tease him about his diet.
. That was also what Sherlock had been tapping, repeatedly, until John had noticed. Then he'd stopped, perhaps out of shyness, perhaps out of restraint. Either way, John loved him even more so for the simple sobriety of the gesture.
Molly woke up with a start.
"By having sex with me?"
There was no way John could not have suffered from it, all the more so as he must have felt betrayed by Sherlock, and terribly hurt to hear the truth from the consulting criminal of all people. Another genius, who knew something about Sherlock – and John – that John hadn't even noticed, even though he'd been the one closest to Sherlock all this time. How could he not feel like an idiot?
"About the door you closed behind you when
"I... need you..."
"Why? Are you interested?"
"Brad and Helena were hitmen," Sherlock replied as he hung up, apparently satisfied that he got the information before his brother could give it to him.
He finished showering quickly and rushed out of the bathroom wearing nothing but a towel, turning his laptop on. While it was loading, he went back to the kitchen to have his sandwich. He stopped and stared at the plate. Out of the two sandwiches he'd prepared, only one was left.
"Sherlock–"
"Oh yeah? So tell me, I'm curious. You just happened to meet Molly Hooper on the street and fell in love with her, so you decided to stop being a homeless guy and suddenly found yourself a position?"
"You see," he went on, "he writes mystery novels."
Sherlock smiled jadedly. "This is chemistry, John. Whether you want it or not, if our relationship isn't fulfilling, you'll easily fall in love with someone el–"
You take one step back, still not letting go of her, but now finding the closeness too oppressive. "Why?"
She loved to see the perplexed pout on his face, the tension in his brow. The elder Holmes elicited such reactions from the younger one that she would have given a lot just to witness their reunion in Washington.
"I'm not used to this, and you know it!" he burst out at last, turning back to John whose eyes widened at his friend's fit of temper. "If something is troubling you I cannot deduce it – or I can only make wild guesses – because this is everything but up my street. I can tell you are worried and angry with yourself for some reason, and feeling pathetic too, but I have no clue as to
"He will."
"Why are you so cold?"
"John."
"Be assured that the pleasure is shared," Sherlock replied amicably.
"Oh I'll put it on the window that gives onto the backyard," she replies brightly.
"Good evening."
"Hey. Hey! Are you with me?"
"Oh yeah, he'll be just fine. Just a bit queasy from the trip, I think. He's the sensitive kind." John gloated slightly as he freely got Sherlock back for the names and the whole marriage thing. "I'm sure he'll be fine tonight."
"Darling? Are you awake?"
"Here, let's try something. Lie on your back."
"Well, you're always busy, aren't you?"
Sherlock scoffed and sunk in his pillow a bit more, giving John the most adorable brooding pout in days. John smiled and leant in for a kiss, but Sherlock bit his tender lips and he let out a small cry of pain and surprise.
"Did you understand the Latin quotes?"
Lestrade shrugged, a smile playing on his lips as he put the file on the kitchen table and turned to leave.
"JOHN!" You and Mary jump at the roar coming from the staircase. You just have time to exchange a look before the door to the living-room is slammed open.
"I have a very large bed. It should be all right."
"What?"
"Let's stop this, Harry."
, with those stupid paws. Picking it in his mouth, holding it tight between his jaws, he went back to the room and stared at John. The idiot
He'd never see Sherlock again, even if he died now. It didn't work that way. His attempt hadn't brought him closer to Sherlock at all: it had nearly ripped them farther apart.
into his very soul – whatever such a lousy concept meant.
"... and so we believe they have now left the country."
"Not to mention the fact that you have stopped working. How long do you reckon you'll last? Twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week with Sherlock Holmes."
Sherlock scowled.
What would he do? Well, he'd be bored, for sure. He'd whine and annoy Mrs. Hudson, most likely. And then... he would go out on his own, even as a tiger, perhaps at night, because staying all day in the flat doing nothing would drive him insane. If he found any interesting case, it'd be even worse, because he would surely end up investigating after all, regardless of his appearance. Sherlock was not stupid, but he was reckless, and he could do incredibly idiotic things if he got carried away – and John did not even want to think about the consequences.
"Yes," John concedes.
"I'm sure you will," she said with a wry smile, and left.
"Shinwell! I had no idea you'd come back so early, I'm not ready at all..." She falls silent as she sees her boyfriend pale and his eyes widen at the sight of John. She frowns. "Do you know each other?"
John squealed when he felt the wetness of Sherlock's mouth on his stitches again, and enhanced the swaying so their upper bodies seemed to be waltzing. The lower part obviously wasn't as chaste, and again he wondered how Sherlock could deal with all the grinding – even if he was becoming more abandoned with each stroked note.
"I know you're only trying to occupy my mind so I don't stiffen every time you touch a sensitive area."
"Yes, really."
He missed, however, Sebastian's very last sentence before he too put on his earphones.
between the two... associates. And again you were stupid – in fact it must be John who makes you lose all mental capacities – because you didn't think twice and didn't even bother controlling yourself. You made it obvious you were angry, and maybe he even heard the disappointment and the fear in your voice, although to you it just seemed louder and more precipitated than usual.
The weather today was endowed with a briskly stimulating coldness. Invigorated, Irene smiled and delicately tilted her head to the side, enjoying the shiver that ran down her spine under her vermilion cashmere dress.
No. But you might've been able to interrogate it.
"I have to tell her about Seb."
"No, don't be. It's fine. I'm fine."
He held her gaze.
But no matter what, your left hand remained as cold as ice.

, Sherlock replied mentally.
"You stopped smoking?" John exclaims, disbelieving.
"Are you planning on spending all the money you have left on bloody hotel rooms?!"
In one's head. "Anyway. Only one letter this time." S. "The final letter!" K. "You understand what it means, don't you, Sherlock?"
"Do you-"
"Impressed?" Seb retorted. John rolled his eyes.
"What? But..."
what's going on?"

, he felt like telling her. But it was pointless. And there was no time for pointless.
Suddenly he realized that John had managed to trick him to get his hair wet, and he frowned, a pout on his face. John didn't notice and was startled when he felt Sherlock shift his arm so the water would be pouring on him instead. He laughed.
You just woke up, interrupting me. Not that I mind, don't take me wrong. I'd give any notebook in the world to have you waking up beside me every morning.
"Sherlock, what the hell has got into you? You ignore me, reject my touch all day and refuse to communicate, and now this? What's going on in that crazy genius head of yours?"
Surely John would understand.
"How about 'Sebastian Moran was an assassin and tried to kill me but eventually shot himself'?"

She was referring to the bodies at the mortuary of course, but Molly paled nonetheless. It was stupid. Sherlock
Gasps were heard around
After all, it was what Sherlock had died for.
"Look... I'm sorry. It's just that... I've been waiting so long..."
You don't know what their relationship was like.

Both women stare dumbly, speechless. Finally, Chris bursts out laughing.
But this being Mycroft, the British government snorted, disbelieving and scornful.
"That day, I... dream..."
In the end, he spent the whole journey away from the compartment, and only went back ten minutes before the train was to arrive in London. His eyes were cast down as he entered the compartment, and so he did not see what was lying on the seat before he'd closed the door behind him. When he did see it, though, his jaw dropped, and he was about to run away and shout for help when he remembered that this was
John did not find it necessary to tell Moriarty that he wasn't sure of anything, and did not expand on the subject. He doubted the maniac would ever understand why it didn't matter whether Sherlock was in love with him or not. As long as he was needed, and as long as he could help, John would stay, and give Sherlock whatever he wanted.
"But just now..."
But instead of feeling relieved, Sherlock could only admit that he was furious and terrified all at once. Yes, that was it. Terror. Fury.

"You're trying to guess when."
Either John had been kidnapped by Moriarty
"No. And he won't."

His companion pouted and stood to watch himself in the mirror.
"You didn't ask me if I was fine," John remarked, more to himself than to his partner. Sherlock arched an eyebrow.
He chuckles bitterly.
"Someone delivered this for you just now, I was surprised – it's quite early isn't it?"
one Sherlock could have used against him. Jim Moriarty's other pawn. Now that she was out of the picture, only Moran was left. Moran with his secret agenda.
"Love, and be silent?" John suggested with a smile.
John took a deep breath before typing the end of his message.
unhappy."
So on she went again with a light heart, and by and by she came to a saddled horse, tied to a tree.
"No."
"I'm sorry. Please go on," Sherlock amended with one of his perfunctory smiles.
"Sherlock?" he said tentatively.
"Umm... Nope."
, John realized, but he was too engrossed in his lover to stop his ministrations. Sherlock, under the guise of his usual cockiness, was bringing John exactly where he wanted him, evidently hoping he would get carried away and take him on the spur of the moment. Well, that wouldn't happen, John mused with a smile, kissing the hip reverently.
Maggie, on the other hand, seemed to wonder where this was leading.
The glimmer in her eyes told Mycroft she knew this was the last piece of the puzzle he needed to make sense of Sherlock's little excursion in Karlštejn. His face became even colder.
Sherlock supposed, grudgingly, that it made two of them. Victor turned back towards him.
? I was just startled by your enthusiasm, considering how sick a simple train ride made you."
"...Take a bath with me?"
John is thinking his day cannot possibly get worse – something no one should ever, ever think – when as he is waiting to be allowed to go home Sally Donovan enters the room and sees him. He wonders if this is the day he's bound to murder someone with his own two hands. Coming up to him, she looks at his black eye and cut lip, and frowns.
He was about to jump off the bed when he realised that he was standing on his clothes. Swiftly, he made a pile out of them, and pushed them off the bed. He jumped after them and was surprised to miss his landing — his legs felt weak, or weaker than usual in manul form anyway. The drug, the doctor thought. Whatever Irene Adler had injected him with, the dose was for a full-grown man, not for
Mycroft was, of course, busy as ever. He had put under surveillance the flat Sebastian Moran occupied when he was in London. To no avail. Moran must have known it would be bugged, and although he acted very freely, not bothering to put clothes on when he went from his bed to the shower or to make coffee in the morning, he still did nothing that could be of any interest to Mycroft. He cleaned weapons, sometimes, but never left them in the flat when he was not in himself. He did not have dreams at night, or at least did not appear to have any. He did not call any name. He did not phone anyone. He did not write to anyone.
"I don't know. Just... be with her."
"Hmpf."
He jumped as the cat went limp and fell back in his arms. What the... could a manul

. He put down the book he'd just found under Henry's pillow -
John froze.
"... I see. Well, do you mind if I wait here for him? I've come quite a long way, and I'd like to be back to Norfolk tonight."
"Was it so bad?"
"I'll call them first thing in the morning."
"You are not responsible for Sherlock's death. You feel like a traitor because you doubted him, as anyone would have, for one fateful moment. This is guilt talking, not you. Just think, Lestrade. Moriarty was stronger than me. How could you have done anything?"
him, even if it was the last thing he did.
"Sure! Of course! Sorry to have bothered you."
"Victor, perhaps we should go—"
Looking at the Adairs, Irene wondered whether rain was worse than sunshine for a funeral. No. Probably the other way around. Sunshine must be worse. Far worse. Probably. A beautiful, sunny day can be only hateful when you are burying your son.
Right, I'm just common and stupid, but sometimes ordinary people manage to see things geniuses don't because they're so obvious."
"Excuse me?"
avoid. You're never going to get anywhere if he starts answering with questions.
Victor frowned, and spoke in lower tones.
He turned a page of the book he was only half-reading, pensive.
"I know I'm an idiot, all right!" Mary bursts out, very annoyed with herself and the situation. "I was the one who told him I'd only go out with him if he married me, so now..."
"It's all right. Go back to sleep."
"Can we?"
"I can't read your thoughts like you read mine. I don't know what I said that made you go into a frenzy suddenly, and I..."
Sherlock moved on to the bathroom — two different shampoos, two toothbrushes — and to the toilet. There were more books there, as well as the latest issue of Smart Computing Magazine. On the wall, a calendar with pictures of cats caught Sherlock's attention.
John holds her gently and looks her in the eye.
"I know, my dear, I know. Now if you don't mind..."
's sister? Sherlock's face darkened. Sebastian Moran. He and Sherlock were playing a dangerous game. Whatever the task Moriarty had left him to do after his death, he was certainly very keen to fulfil it. But Sherlock had hoped that what dear old Jim had in store concerned him, and him alone. Not...
jeering, but that was fine, because there was fondness in his teasing. So you shared your memories of Sherlock with him, knowing full well that you gave away much about yourself in the process.
"A hot bath. When I'm done, of course."
"Not exactly what we came for," Sherlock cut in, not waiting for the porter to open the door and getting out of the car the moment it had stopped.
, she thought absent-mindedly.
Sherlock spared himself the trouble to glare at him.
"Yes?"
But always Sherlock's presence remains, and will remain. Of that you are certain. Perhaps because his presence isn't so much in the flat as in your own mind. Still, it feels like the warmth in the room is also Sherlock's. Hugging the silence, you know it will never stop hurting.
"Only
. A very talented sniper, evidently.
"And what will you give me in exchange, Dr. Watson?" Mycroft finally asked in a honeyed tone.
The clouds were getting darker and darker, but Mrs. Hudson paid it no heed and arrived in front of the grave with determination on her face and a bucket full of disinfectants in her hand. Rolling up her sleeves, she was about to put on the latex gloves she had brought when a voice interrupted her.
"I still do not quite understand, you know" he said almost to himself. "How Sherlock could have gotten so attached to John Watson."
"Ooh, so you read the papers."
housekeeper, either."
"Well, yes, about–"
Sherlock decided it would be enough to only half-listen and noted what could be of some importance. Stepfather, got along with the kids, who did not mention their father at all. In fact, nobody mentioned Brad Campbell, and they all seemed rather cheerful. Not traumatized in any way. Certainly not in mourning.
"Obvious to you, perhaps."
could do the teasing and he relished it.
Greg averts his gaze, his brow furrowing. You know that look. His voice must be stuck in his throat. Three years of pain and guilt are bubbling up to the surface, stifling him. You can only sympathize, but still you wish he had waited just another day before coming. You're not sure Sherlock is in any state to take this for what it is: a proof of Greg's caring for him.
"It really isn't," Irene answered assuredly. The man she had left in the room upstairs would presently do the most insane things for her. Ms. Šárka really hadn't picked the right timing.
"Please just ensure he comes back," she replied softly.
"You have me lying naked before you and you need to
She runs a hand through her hair, exhausted. Her gaze falls on the little red + sign. The fifth one.
There we go.
– and I don't mean desire here, which is something else entirely – then I'll understand. You've done so much for me already. When I asked this of you, I... I know you consider yourself straight. I should have thought about it twice before asking this of you."
After the first reaction of bewilderment and despair came the annoyance. Then, John thought about the advantages of the situation, so as to forget the downsides of it.
"Who?"
"Why can't we just talk? Before I die or you die, can't you at least explain?"
So Sherlock made an effort and ate the meat John had prepared for him, and John made an effort as well and tried to be pleasant without being too patronizing. Now that the troublesome events of the morning were over, he was in fact quite content to see Sherlock in tiger-form again. It meant the case was on hiatus for the day and the night, and John thought that, after all, those transformations were quite handy: they did not prevent them from doing cases altogether, which would've been boring and would've killed Sherlock, but they happened just often enough to make the cuddle times necessary, and more and more frequent.
Sherlock looked almost... sheepish. He averted his gaze, pursed his lips, and sulked. Or so John thought, anyway. He stood up, walked around the table, and squatted down in front of his friend, putting his hands on his knees.
Moriarty just grinned, as if sure of his victory.
"But it doesn't prevent you from saying those things to him," Mrs. Hudson remarks softly.
There were many answers to that which crossed the detective's mind.
"So there was a fight?"
John doesn't remember closing his laptop, nor going out for a walk. When the world comes back into focus and it's raining cats and dogs outside, he looks blankly up at the sky and thinks he should really stop switching off like that. He notices that he's standing in front of a restaurant and people are eating. All right. Dinner time then. He makes his way back to the studio, casually wondering how long before he sees the smiley face again.
"Yes, yes, very nice to meet you," Mr. Leverton said perfunctorily. "Mr. Trevor, I'm glad you're back. I must go on a short trip in Sumatra again, and I was worried about leaving my wife alone again, after what happened last time. But now that you are back, I'm sure everything will be safe, won't it? Have you talked to the police? Any news?"
"Who's the idiot?"
Sherlock shakes his head. He drinks some tea, until he finds his voice again. Gets a grip.
"No, Sherlock! Please don't close them. Look at me. You won't remain conscious if you close them. Please."
John was disbelieving, but Hilton was dead serious.
"You are wasting your time."
"Of no help at all," she answered with a grin. He stared. "I just wanted to meet you. To meet a Holmes, of course – I've heard so much about you two that I was getting frustrated. But I wanted to meet you especially."
Delicately you place him back in his crib and make your way out of the room in silence. This flat is nice. You're so glad Mary got along with Mrs. Turner and could move somewhere so close to 221B. Of course it'd be better if she had her own room rather than sleeping in the living-room, but as soon as Blake gets old enough he can move into the extra bedroom in 221B and Mary can have the bedroom in her flat.
‘No regret, this seems to be shitty brandy.’

theory was the victim's shoes. No trace of poison had been found on the body, but not all poisons leave traces. The shoes, however, might still hold the evidence. Now, the only one who could have introduced some novel foreign poison was Sterndale – but he had intended to propose to her. The brother, however, had motive. So how did he get his hands on the poison? That was easy to deduce. Sterndale had said in his statement that they had gone drinking and that Mortimer was quite drunk when he told Sterndale not to marry Brenda. But if they had been drinking together, it was very likely that Sterndale too was drunk at the time. Consequently it wasn't improbable that he'd started blabbering about his passion – plants, and his latest discoveries.
"Goodnight, Mary. Have a nice day tomorrow."
John's face lights up noticeably, relaxing with unmistakable relief and something close to gratefulness.
OK, so maybe she wasn't that over Sherlock. But she had still given up. Hence her frustration with how the two men handled – or rather
"So what are we looking for, exactly?"
. He couldn't help but shiver at the thought and be overwhelmed with disgust.
"Please get to the point."
Your legs have reacted faster than your voice, thankfully, and are already running after him. You have no idea whether you're furious or terrified or disgusted with the world or hopeful – this state you're in reminds you of the war. The urgency at war, when there's a wound to be treated. Can't give in to panic, but still panic is looming. The adrenaline, rising. Fear. The necessity to act fast. To not make one single mistake, always lethal under such circumstances. You never considered yourself to be clever, never felt especially clever, but in those moments you were efficient. Life and death situations. Yes, you understood Seb. Whatever his reasons were, your hand would not have quivered either. Except you didn't only shoot at people, you tried to save their lives, too.
With a bang she finds herself back in the living-room on the hard boards. It is cold. Her back hurts. She looks around but sees no trace of John, or of Sherlock for that matter. The flat is empty. She's all alone. In her hand is still the bunch of daffodils. On the mantelpiece, the skull is grinning down at her.
Silence. This isn't what you wanted to say; in fact, you had very much intended never to mention the videos at all. You groan and roll back onto the bed, curling up on yourself, your back turned to John.
The cemetery. The grave. You really did go there. Mycroft. The grave must have been bugged. Yes. Bugged. The cemetery. Your grave. But with Moriarty's body in it. The earth. You look down at your hands, muddy like your shoes. Like your trousers. You shiver. John sees it.
"Quite sure."
"You're not getting the point."
Her eyes scan the menus displayed on the wall above the counter. She and John came a few times together, and Mary liked it a lot. But today nothing is to her liking. She sighs.
WELL NOW I'M TELLING YOU TO GO, John retorted.
"He doesn't live in a mental hospital, Sergeant!" Sherlock burst out. "He's a PhD student in history doing research on Napoleon at Queen Mary University. He wasn't a messy person — look at the kitchen, look at the bathroom! Only the living-room is upside-down. Doesn't it strike you as strange? Why would he start throwing books all over the place?"
"As I said, this is a trap. They most likely want to frame us. And if we leave tomorrow early in the morning, this means they
"Yes, I am quite aware."
"Is it what this is all about? Seeing how Sherlock reacts to John being
'Nay,' said the horse, 'I know naught of the stars in the sky, and I'm here to do the bidding of the Good Folk, and not my own will.'
Victor chuckled.
"I miss the jungle. I liked it there. Animals are very different from people, y'know."
And now you are.
"Sherlock, I'm sorry, I–"

"What a preposterous idea. Don't I have you?"
other people to shake off the boredom. You're like a kid who doesn't have friends nor a family to love him, completely alone in a room full of toys he can only use until he breaks them out of bitterness."
"And that was quite enough, thank you very much."
Slowly, very gently, Mary snuggles closer to you and embraces your cold body, resting your head on her shoulder. You take a deep breath.
in..."
Put an end to it.
"Make me."
"John ! It's been so long !" Angelo cuts in, hugging him forcefully.
‘Come in,’ Sherlock relented, and John wondered how he would break it to the Woman that her new boyfriend was in the hospital.
John was now thrashing and all of a sudden broke the desperate kiss, alarmed by the wetness he'd felt on his face and that certainly hadn't come from
She leant in and pressed her lips to his, rather gently at first, then more and more adroitly, in control. Truly an expert.
"No. To John."
John remained silent. He wanted to ask more, wanted to know why he had come back now, what could possibly be worth facing his old demons again. But this was not the venue for this. John almost regretted having asked. Even if Victor had kept his voice down, he felt like they had shared something intimate, and doing so in such a busy, public place, felt wrong.
She shakes her head, smiling.
"Fine, Sherlock. I'll let you experiment all you want. But you'll owe me a favour.
"Please, I'm begging you. Just destroy it. If anyone were to see it... if
"And so you stopped smoking?" he asks.
"Well, that's not exactly the same thing," he finally said. "We don't know his motives, and that's why it took so long to convince the jury – and the press – that he was a true genius. Why would a true genius commit suicide if he wasn't a fake? Then, there's your testimony and that phone call you got..."
"Oh John you should have seen your goggling face! Your eyes are so round to begin with, it was just hilarious... Won't you do it again?"
"I'm not–"
"No problem, John. Please have a seat. Would you like some coffee?"
Fear and an indefinable anguish flickered in the clear pupils, which blurred – but Sherlock did not avert his gaze. He forced himself to look into the depths of John's irises, to really look, even though their intensity was blinding, their determination dazzling.
Sherlock palpated the flesh a bit and once he'd identified the point he was looking for, pressed on the medial side of John's knee joint between the tendons. His other hand lowered to fondle the calf and stopped a few inches above the ankle, on the inside of the leg, where he pressed another point.
"Right. Whatever."
A white page. The last letter was a white page. Was it the last thing Moriarty wrote before he killed himself? Did Seb know it was blank? I have a feeling he did. A final way to cock a snoot.
Sherlock silenced him with his tongue and a bite to keep him quiet.
"He doesn't even try. He's busy," she answered. Sherlock, having forgotten their conversation, and the very fact that there had been a conversation, wondered what she was talking about.
John's grandparents divorced when their sons were very young still, and Mr. Openshaw moved to Texas bringing little Elias with him, while the mother stayed in England with Joseph.
Seb grins like a kid.
"Picture me completely unresponsive."
"No, it wasn't."
"I'm not sure I-"
Maggie thanked her, and walked up directly to the second floor, where she knew John's room was. A bright grin on her face, she knocked on the door and pushed it open carefully, popping her head inside. She was surprised to see that the bed hadn't been slept in, and that the room was empty.
"What happened this morning at the clinic?"
"Sherlock... Sherlock Sherlock Sherlock
She snorted, taking a sip of tea and pushing back a lock of hair behind her ear. "Are you sure that I did? Are you really?" The contempt and the acrimony in her voice, skilfully tempered by her biting, darkly amused tone, almost made Greg wince. "You can't even think for yourself," she spat. "You just listen to others, believe what others say, or don't. You're like a kid learning science, not actually understanding how it works, just learning it all and taking what he's told for the gospel truth! So you tell me. What do you think, Greg? If I tell you I did not cheat on you, that I just needed a night out and certainly did not want to meet your genius friend to get my whole life read on my face and shoes and handbag and spilled in front of strangers, will you believe me?"
like what you see!"
"Fine. Now that we're here, I suppose we can talk. Maybe we should have done that from the beginning."
"Isn't it your landlady's cat?"
"I didn't even get coffee!"
"The Virgin's not in hell. He's not in hell and you're just standing there watching!"
"What do you see?"
You wish you could see them – his eyes. You already know you will miss them.
His lips pressed to his, his tongue dancing with his, his nose rubbing his, everything was so soft and tentative, yet fervent... His kiss felt like a gift.
"Hi, Sherlock!" Seb exclaims as if the consulting detective's presence was the most natural thing in the world – as if he'd been expecting it. "For a second I thought you wouldn't make it in time..."
"No."
"I wonder how attached he was to him if he thought the best idea was to throw himself from the roof of a building in front of his very eyes."
"Won't you put something on?" he said, not even trying to conceal his amusement.
"What?"
The question surprised Sherlock. He hadn't really been thinking about anything; he had no plan, and the inquiry caught him off-guard.
"And what do you mean, people's mailboxes?"
He arches an eyebrow and Mary holds her hand up to show him her ring.
"Forget that last part."
When had he been curt? He tried to replay their exchange from the morning, but couldn't really pinpoint anything he'd said that could have been considered rude. What was he trying to say, then?
will bottom. At least the first time."
"But you won't be able to keep running away for long."
"I'm a fake."
John laughed stiffly.
But John couldn't. This was so typical of Sherlock, and yet picturing him trying to talk a horse out of something was so hilarious that he couldn't help it. Sherlock snorted.
"You're wrong."
Later, John would think that he must have leapt into his personal space to silence him before he spouted any more nonsense. But for now he was too astonished to think anything at all.
The consulting detective tilted his head to the side in puzzlement just as John came back.
"Thank God you don't like metaphors..." John grumbled, not getting a word of what Sherlock was saying. Islands? Energy?
Sherlock's eyes widened at the alluring comment and he shivered. He'd started the wrestling because he knew exactly the way Mycroft thought and brainwashed people. He had used John's domineering tendencies to convince the doctor he was a monster. There was no way Sherlock could argue against that, because he didn't even comprehend how John could be considered anything else than a hero – and a
"Mary..."
"You..."
Mrs. Hudson looked up, confused.
But it doesn't mean you don't feel like you're dying inside at the moment.
to his partner's exposed groin, fondling and pinching his thighs.
How can he be gentle about this?
"Damn this, I'll have to do everything. Sherlock, please talk to me."
"It's great to see you again, really," Lestrade tells him, still chuckling.
As expected of Sherlock, he didn't listen, and only let go of John's manhood when it was flaccid. The moment he sat back John's legs failed him and he ended up falling on Sherlock, whose protestations were muffled as he fell back. John let his head fall on his friend's torso and held on to him mechanically, as if he were a giant teddy bear.
Behind the shower curtain, John inhales sharply. Sherlock tries to see if his hand is trembling. His eyes scrutinize the silhouette behind the white plastic.
A genuine smile graced the detective's lips, his face filling with a peculiar mix of candid innocence and domineering playfulness. John hummed softly as he was kissed again, enjoying the waves of pleasure washing over him, revelling in how bonded he felt to the brilliant, insufferable man in his arms. He still felt somewhat awkward about being so submissive, but if that was what it took to reaffirm his partner's self-confidence, John would commit to it without the trace of a doubt. He trusted Sherlock with his life. There was no reason he should not trust him with his body.
"Please," he murmured.
crossed his mind, but Sherlock blamed it on fear.
"Were you with her on Christmas?"
John searched Sherlock's gaze for a moment. He could see nothing there but worry and anger mingled with fear.
"In three airplanes and two airports," Sherlock corrected blankly. Sebastian groaned.
"You've scared her away, methinks," he remarked amusedly. The other shrugged.
Ignoring the gun against his forehead, Moriarty turned towards John and resumed their discussion. Apparently, he did not believe for a second that Sherlock would shoot, and did not care whether he kept holding his weapon or not.
So what if Mycroft had surveillance cameras in the flat? He'd always meddled. This was nothing new.
The tiger frowned, which only made his face look fluffier and more adorable – but this time, John repressed his laugh. He did not think Sherlock would be the type to enjoy being considered cute – and to be fair, he could relate.
"And I failed."
John's touch had torn him all over the place, physically, mentally, and emotionally. The spots he had touched and the fact that it was
And may I ask who your husband is?"
Diving on her, you assail her with tickle, enjoying hearing her crystalline laughter fill the room.
"Sherlock," he sighed. "What the hell are we doing?"
John gritted his teeth. "I
It seemed a little strange to her that the landlady wouldn't have known that her lodgers were away, but it appeared to be the most likely explanation. Still, Maggie could not shake off the sense of unease that had dawned upon her when she had seen John's empty room. Quietly, she walked down the corridor to the only door that was closed, and that could be nothing else but Sherlock Holmes's room. She paused in front of it, hesitating. Suddenly, she wasn't so sure she wanted to know.
the guest? He was hit by a wave of nausea – the first of many to come. The warmth of the man's body standing beside him was making him queasier with every passing second. On the table before him, Sherlock's pearly grey body appeared to be made of ice and ashes. It looked so cold.
"His name is Blake."
"Don't be stupid. He didn't say he killed a man on his blog, Jim."
his knots tighten at first under the attack, then little by little be smoothed through the persistent kneading that was imposed on them. Expertly, John's hands grabbed his muscles and squeezed, tugging and pinching. When he hit a nerve or massaged a knot relentlessly until it surrendered to his ministrations, it was both painful and pleasurable, tearing Sherlock all over the place. It sent sparks and jolts of electricity throughout his whole body, animating him, giving him back his energy but also flooding him with feelings that threatened to drown him. He jolted as John found a knot in the middle of his back, where it curved.
"I see. Just another question: is this the man who came and asked questions about the geese too?" Sherlock inquired, showing the man a picture of James Oakshott on the screen of his phone.
Rising.
Sherlock was so bewildered he didn't react at first, but when he did, he couldn't hold back. Hissing, he struggled and scratched John's arm in the process – but the ex-soldier refused to let go of him and they ended up grappling on the kitchen floor, fighting tooth and claw. This should have been a good way to release the stress and tension that had built between them during the day as they'd gradually grown more annoyed with each other. But Sherlock wasn't used to being a tiger and had little idea of his strength. He managed to roll their two bodies so he could loom over John, growling threateningly, snarling into his face, his sharp-toothed jaw frighteningly close to John's jugular. John abruptly stopped struggling. He didn't make a move to defend himself. He only looked Sherlock in the eye, calm and firm.
John kissed him again to make up for it, but was pitilessly bitten back. He chuckled, shook his head and stood up.
Then she had realized; Sherlock always turned to John when asking this now. He only ever asked John. She wondered if the doctor understood it correctly. It seemed obvious to her that he wasn't so much asking if this was good according to society and people in general, but that it was according to
You stare. Her tone is serious. It is most of the time, which is the reason she is not only funny, but comical too.
"No!" John lied. "No, I'm not. It's just.. I wanted you to know it was OK. We don't have to share the same bed, and we don't have to... do it every night, either. We can do whatever you want."
, you write in your journal.
The very strange thought
Sebastian's eyes gleamed in the dark, and his face broke into a grin. The bitter smile on Sherlock's face told him his words did have the double meaning Sebastian thought they did.
John refrained from rolling his eyes, definitely thinking that
You broke into my flat."
"What were you thinking about?"
Yes, Carl Powers. Carl Powers minus the pool. That leaves only poison. Or the lab. But John never went to Bart's anymore. Had no reason to go there. There was still Mike. And Molly. Seb could find a way. Sherlock had already given Shinwell and the Irregulars his instructions – if John went to Bart's, he would know.
"You've been speaking to the Woman?"
She almost winced, but didn't. Sherlock felt his old admiration for her rekindle at such mastery of her expressions. If only she had as much control on her own emotions...
"You did," you repeat dumbly.
"Well, it certainly is a pleasure," he retorts, smiling thinly. Mary shakes her head and sighs.
"Where are you going?"
Sherlock had laughed while John had glared.
"Oh yeah, I think he's got something on. He didn't tell me much, though, and just stormed out early this morning. You know how he is."
"If you wish to eat anything, yes."
It took John a few seconds to remember the discussion. "I'll be honest with you. I hate to think about Harry or Donovan or Anderson knowing about it. I'm just... not ready for that. And there's something else, Sherlock. Public image. You have one now. You're not exactly famous, but in any case, you have a reputation of sorts. This is not something I should ever put on my blog, and I need you to understand why."
"John?" she called dumbly, for obviously no one was there. She closed the door and went back down to the first floor, entering the living-room. John wasn't sleeping on the couch either – and why would he have?
"No."
It is blank.
"Hello darling," she said with her easy, perfunctory smile.
ones. - People want to know you're human. - Why? - 'Cause they're interested. - No they're not.
Now, the question was: why was there no sign of violence whatsoever on the bodies when they obviously had been killed? Because the killer must be someone they knew. All three of them. And in the file Lestrade had shown him, only one person appeared to have been close enough to the three victims, although he was only mentioned once, and no one had paid any attention to him.
"I didn't!" Sherlock intervened. "I tried to push him because that idiot wouldn't move! I certainly didn't intend to shield him with my own body."
It was his writing but not his words: he had merely copied the fairy tale, Snow White. There was no message. Only a map of England and a pair of emerald, oval-shaped earrings.
"Oh and remember to hand back your key to Mrs. Hudson upon leaving."
"Ha ha ha! God, you're mad, man, completely mad!" Seb roars for the twelfth time.
"Well, they're not
Your eyes come to a halt on the window. The weather has cleared up a bit and it is now a beautiful but cold winter day. Mary loves winter, and she loves the sea – which is why you waited until it was ridiculously cold to go on your honeymoon, during the Christmas holidays. At the beach, naturally. You can't help but chuckle at the memory. It was so cold in the fishermen's village in which you spent a week, and you had bought her an emerald coloured shawl with amber sunflowers in a small shop run by an amicable, gap-toothed old woman Mary now referred to as "The Witch". It turned out she loved witches too.
When  they broke the kiss, John rested his forehead against Sherlock's, and  waited. As his flatmate wasn't making any comment, he asked hesitantly:
Sherlock kept crying at the unwanted touch and still couldn't stop his mind admiring the
He goggles.
"Sherlock!" John protested. He was appalled to hear how wanton his own voice sounded, and groaned.
"Why do you want to see him again?"
"B... because William wasn't supposed to hit him on the ah!.. head..."
Victor smirked.
Just then Mrs. Hudson decided to pay them a little evening visit. John held back a sigh – oh, she was going to fuss.
"If she does, maybe you should just tell her. Give her advice – strictly medical, of course... I don't know, insist on the risks."
"Yes," Sherlock said, although he didn't. Fleetingly, he thought it was uncommon for John to suggest ingesting caffeinated drinks after dinner. The door was closed again and he listened to his flatmate's retreating steps.
This time he looks away, and you can see his embarrassment. He hesitates to speak further.
"Of course it's not all right!" Sherlock exclaimed, exploding at last. He pushed John back. "Did you even hear what he said?"
"Oh well. I'll let you think about it, then."
Sherlock Holmes
"Gottle o' gear, gottle o' gear, gottle o' gear."
arrogant?" "Of course you bloody are! And what are you implying?"). Like in every other fight, Sherlock had won, and John was now lying in bed in the upper room. His sleep was very light, and when he heard the stairs' steps creak right outside his room, he was on his guard. When the door to his room was pushed open gingerly, he already had a hold of his gun, although he still pretended to be asleep.
"Haha, I'm afraid I am."
John just stared. "Everybody has fantasies."
Sherlock's eyes snap open. He sees the ceiling of a room. Somebody is panting. Him.
"You didn't intend to come back here, did you? So what did you intend to do?"
All right, so maybe she does care. John's affection is contagious. Mary wishes she'd met Sherlock when he was still alive, wishes she'd seen him and Mycroft interact, because it sounded most entertaining when John recounted it to her. Sherlock and Mycroft Holmes are fascinating men, like characters in books. They are amazing and infuriating and complex. Mary has no idea how John stood to live with Sherlock – well, because he was in love, she imagines, and even before that he cared so much – and she would no doubt have gone bonkers if she'd had to share a flat with him. But having the Holmes as
"Does it matter? Surely Maggie would understand."
John nodded voicelessly. He did not trust himself right now, and did not want to spout something stupid again. He swallowed, trying to ignore how Sherlock's face spoke volumes: is that what is expected of me now? Small talk? John felt terrible.
"But so was Sherlock," Chris comments.
"Why?"
John shifted awkwardly. Mike often teased him about his string of girlfriends; he himself had been dating a girl for a few months now, John recalled.
She shivered.
The taste of John's coffee brings so many memories back, no, an entire world, time past, like in that French book where someone eats a piece of cake and remembers his whole childhood, that Sherlock almost chokes on the first sip. John gives him an anxious look.
"It's pathetic," he let out between gritted teeth.
," John asserted with a small nod, kissing Sherlock's cheek chastely. "But in any case, if you do have something – which I highly doubt – I'm already contaminated, so there's no point in fussing now."
He averted his gaze in annoyance, and seeing the light pink tinge spreading across his cheekbones, John had to resist the urge to smother him with kisses.
"No choice, was it?"
"under the rose" ; denotes secrecy or confidentiality
"Keep it."
"Oh, that'll be John," Chris says as she stands up, going to open the door.
John heard her retreat down the stairs, closing the door behind her. His gaze was fixed on Victor. Victor Trevor. John wasn't sure how he felt about this, but it was nothing good.
Sherlock gulped and sent quick glances around like a trapped animal. He never liked this type of conversation – too much trouble, and it really wasn't his area.
"I really did call the zoo!" he exclaimed somewhat indignantly. "I assure you that everything you'll eat today will be perfectly fine. You won't be sick."
"Oh, John! Sorry, I had forgotten you. Can't we talk later? This is very delicate..."
"That's strange, very strange. Aren't there easier ways to kill someone?"
"I'm not gay."
"No, sorry. I was just thinking about something."
"...Right. Well, it doesn't matter. I'm here. I'll try to catch you before you can take a cab next time, but even if you do, I'll follow you, and catch you eventually. It's fine, Sherlock, it's all fine."
"You think?"
"Just go, you meanie. Your date will be waiting."
"You'd like to know, wouldn't you? Anyway, if you don't find something for me to do, Sherlock, I'll just leave you. This is a sinking ship."
"When were you planning on telling me?"
"What are you doing here, Mycroft?
"John..." you begin tentatively. "Friends protect people. And alone protects me. All that counts is the Work. For you, now, it is family. I knew it would be the end the moment I jumped. I knew I would never see you again. I cannot go back to you."
Blue eyes fixed him courageously.
"Yes, well, things happen."
Sherlock had been so deep in thought that the small paw on his chest surprised him. He smiled unwittingly and his hand ran down John's spine as if to return the gesture. But then the paw pushed him back. He froze.
"Come in," he said, and the door was indeed pushed open.
But the fact was, Sherlock hadn't. Started any mess. Or killed anyone. At least, Greg hoped so, and even came to be certain of it. It was perhaps a risk, but as the years went by, it became less and less likely to happen. Then John Watson had entered Sherlock's life, and Greg was pretty sure then that unless something happened to John, Sherlock would never become a criminal.
"Mycroft kidnapped you."
She looks disappointed, and you add precipitately: "I mean, as you said, we're in a gay bar, so it isn't like I stand any chance anyw–"
"I'm sorry sir, we don't serve
The manul felt insulted — of course he didn’t have rabies! — but then realised that this could play to his advantage. He snarled again.
? Because Sherlock wasn't suicidal, of that John was dead certain. Well, not the Sherlock he knew, anyway. He'd been so sure the consulting detective wouldn't be the type to use drug, and yet he'd been an addict... so maybe he would commit suicide under certain circumstances.
But John wasn't impressed at all and dared stroke his throat as if he were some house pet. Sherlock looked daggers at his friend's irksome smirk.
Moran shrugged – that was definitely a habit of his, you thought. Not a pleasant one either.
believe that. But I did see it, so the question is: how?
Harry rolls her eyes and ignores people in the queue who are sending them perplexed glances.
"Actually, can I have an orange juice?"
"Life!" Ron announced with grandiloquence.
without touching the detective – a movement for each note, slow and sensual, and he almost laughed, wondering how many people would use Bach to strip tease. Literally living the music through motions, he pushed his trousers down unhurriedly, then stepped out of them. Sherlock closed his eyes.
"You can't just turn on people like this and leave them hanging!" he shouts from the staircase before giving up.
To be fair, it wasn't truly planned or anything. He'd just had the terribly bad idea to finally go back to the flat. The one on Baker Street, that is. Which, technically, wasn't really the flat any more. And that's why it had all gone so wrong.
"I'm sure," Sherlock replied, his lips curving so clearly perfunctorily his comment was all the more insulting.
He nodded seriously.
"Purring is fine."
... is yours."
"The case. You haven't answered my texts today."
Sherlock had never been good with gifts. His parents' gifts had never truly felt like gifts, except for the eye patch his father had bought him on the last Christmas before he died, and the chemistry set Mycroft had given him the next Christmas to
. Sherlock just lay there like a broken doll, incapable of moving, incapable of calling him back. He was frozen.
"No! I..."
It isn't time yet," he said to himself. "But soon." He put out the candle. "Soon, Sherlock," he murmured to the darkness.
"Poe," Jim had confirmed.
This is where the abduction must have taken place. There were no traces of a fight, so it was implausible that John had been attacked by some other animal. Sherlock let out a silent sigh of relief. It was short-lived. Soon his eyes had fallen on the kennel in one of the corners of the garden. It looked like a small house with a red roof. Trite. Sherlock swallowed. A
The moment he'd uttered the words, he heard Moriarty's echo in his mind and paled.
weird?" John teased, moving on to the thighs.
"Why not?"
"Brilliant, isn't it?"
"You've got a son."
"God, you're twisted."
"My past experiences..."
"You... You came!" John stuttered, completely lost.
"Forget it," Sherlock grumbles. Well. So much for the information exchange. What in the world did he see on these DVDs? Maybe you should just go down again and ask Mrs. Hudson to borrow them. But Sherlock seems so intent on you
"I can't arrest people without evidence, Sherlock!"
"Mary..."
"Oh, I thought I heard you talking. Isn't Dr. Watson with you?"
transforming into cats?" Sherlock frowned slightly at being called a cat but did not object. He himself was trying to find an answer to that question. Because while one day might chase away the boredom, two would be too much. Beyond that, he didn't even want to consider the ramifications of spending the rest of his life as a tiger. It would be terrible: no murders, no chasing around London, no cases, no
"I meant, not about the case."
「なぜあの女と不倫したのか？」
Sebastian glanced at her. Perhaps she was more psychotic than he'd thought.
"I'm not sulking!"
"Sherlock, what the hell is going on?!" you ask as you see with horror that he is putting on his shoes and grabbing his coat. "Sherlock, wait!" But he pushes you back feverishly, opens the door and runs down the stairs.
Sherlock bursts out laughing.
Moran could not repress a smile. They walked into the clearing until they were both standing approximately in the middle. Sebastian looked round, feeling a presence. His eyes stopped on a heap of rocks, on top of which a crow was standing. He blinked. It was so odd and it felt so out of place that Sebastian almost laughed.
"So. Shall we play, now?"
Sherlock moved before he fully registered what he was doing, and pressed Irene against the nearest wall, holding her wrists and preventing her from moving.
Noticing his shock, John thought he'd gone too far and went to delete the last sentence, but Sherlock frowned and stopped his paw.
feelings", believing in some kind of asexual Sherlock, had only been a more elaborate kind of denial. He could never be sure about Sherlock's sexual inclination, but John knew his friend wasn't a sociopath, knew he
John stopped himself before he blurted out anything, but even Hilton seemed perplexed.
"Are you having second thoughts now that you've seen me, Mrs. …?"
"Brown. Josiah Brown. Is Henry... Do you think he..."
"When are you taking the case?" he asked rather sharply.
"Had what?"
"Mrs. Hudson! Is anyone in?"
"Yes?"
What had he been thinking? It was all nice and sweet to profess your love so dramatically, but what now? John had never considered getting into a relationship with Sherlock, it was absurd. The other man had made it quite clear from day one that he was not interested in romance. Romance. The word made John's head spin, and not in a good way. This was crazy. He was crazy.
"Your coat is drenched," he goes on, putting it in the bathtub as well. He rubs the towel behind your ears, then along the line of your hair in your neck and above your brow. You want to ask him whether your kiss was any good. It probably wasn't, since he did not kiss back. You try to deduce what he thought of it by observing him as he dries your hair, but he keeps rubbing that towel on your head and over your face and it makes you want to bite. You frown and shake off the idea. He is just trying to help.
"How can you know they were stupid?"
"Good," Sherlock said quickly, averting his gaze nervously. "Good."
"Right," he said. "It could."
As it was, though, Sherlock was sleeping, because he'd been trying so hard to turn his gigantic brain off for once, just to get rid of the
"I know."
Sherlock had to control himself not to roll his eyes. That was beside the point.
John growled.
"What?"
"The end, Miss Hooper. The return of the hero. But the thing is, he's not alone."
Today was a rather uneventful day in 221 Baker Street. There had been a visit from Detective Inspector Lestrade, who as always needed Sherlock to help him solve a case - a murder, if Mrs. Hudson remembered correctly. Sherlock had left beaming. But that was nothing out of the ordinary, and all in all, today was nothing exceptional. That is, until it went completely wrong.
I'm jealous of you."
"Long-term relationship? One-night stand?"
"Sherlock, we have to talk."
She was exhausted. It hadn't only been a bad day, but a long one too. The flat had felt so empty after Sherlock had left – and that was more than eight month ago. It certainly didn't feel like he was here just yesterday. More like centuries. Toby mewled and roused her from her thoughts.
