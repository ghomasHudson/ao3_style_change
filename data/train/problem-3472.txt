“You’re not interrupting,” Castiel affirmed, punishing Dean and addressing Sam in one swoop. Castiel frowned a moment. “You’re not due to be here until tomorrow, or we wouldn’t have brought our activities out to the garden.”
“Do you want to come back to my hotel after? So we can, you know, talk some more, have a coffee? I'd love to hear about your time in Africa,” Dean suggested timidly.
“Definitely,” he reassured Dean. “But only after I fuck you now. And only after you come again. I shouldn’t have missed the warning signs you were so close, I need to study this before we go any further.”
What started as a single diet-breaking burger ended up turning into a habit. Dean also stopped training as much. Unlike the centauricorn actors, he wasn't required to be even slightly naked and had loose clothing on to hide any changes in his physique.
Half the issues they'd had came from the fact they had to keep it a PG-13, and now he was finding out that wasn't even the case any more.
Dean Winchester, child star, had signed up for this film thinking it would be his big break into films for a more mature audience. He and his brother Sam had been in a series of successful child-centered action films. When Sam had decided to retire from the movie business, Dean had found himself at a loss for what to do. He felt the critics (
Dean realized then what his silence probably seemed like to Cas. “What? Oh! Yeah, of course, that was... freaking awesome,” he finished with a dazed and happy look on his face. “In fact... I wouldn't mind another go.”
The guy shook his head as much as he could. His bottom jaw was shaking in either fear or pain, Sam didn’t know. “I got told killing you was pointless and to get more creative. Come on, lady, I told you everything I know I–” he convulsed as Claire turned the baton on, sending jolts of electricity into his body.
Samandriel smiled up at Castiel. He occupied a female vessel from the universe they’d found him in. Regardless of the vessel, he had the same gentle-hearted nature.
Sam. It’s been barely a couple of centuries and he’s already…” Castiel trailed off trying to think of a better word than
“So you can stick around tonight?” Dean hoped he sounded casual enough that Castiel wouldn’t pick-up on just how damn much he’d missed him.
“No, I mean, yes? No, wait.” Sam’s cheek twitched. He took a deep breath and tried again. “Yeah, the seat’s free. Sorry, just all up in,” Sam tapped his temples as if that explained all.
Benny chuckled. “She knows I love the restaurant, but she knows every now and then, I still get bitten by the acting bug, so she don't mind me clearin' out for a bit every now and then. Secretly I think she likes getting the bed to herself. Plus, being in a few films draws the clients to us, people get a kick out of having their food cooked-up by someone who has acted with Annie Jones.”
She moaned and put her head in her hands. "Would've never had kids if I'd known they were coming after. Gracie jacked a car last week. Do you even know how hard it is to steal a car? When was the last time you'd even heard of one being stolen?"
Another Castiel was now kissing him. Dean wondered if the Castiels were ever tempted to kiss each other to expand some of their sexual energy while waiting.
Both brothers watched the TV silently after that, pretending like they weren’t both thinking of their dad.
Camera flashes went off all around him as he stopped to pose for various photographers. The photographers weren't as interested in him as they were his female co-stars, who had actually put effort into their outfits.
Dean couldn’t muster the words for how much he loved Castiel for thinking of this. For knowing him so well. His only response was to blush and duck his head, too overwhelmed to be able to voice his feelings properly. Castiel Three let out a growl as Dean clenched around him. He pulled out before his orgasm hit though, saving himself for Dean’s mouth.
“And I don’t want anyone but you either, Cas. It’s just a dumb fantasy. I don’t need that, I just need you. Honestly, Cas,” Dean moved his body to lean even further into Castiel’s naked, warm body behind him. “I don’t need anyone but you. The porn is just a fantasy, you’re my reality and the only one I want.”
They were all dressed identically. The only slight difference between any of them was how ruffled their hair looked.
dream? Because I was in that world before, but last time I knew. I knew it wasn’t real. I remember Sam and I were fighting and I hated it.”
Dean turned back around to look at Sam, one leg in his car as he rested both arms on the top of the open door. “Yeah?”
“You need to go into that room. There's a rack of clothes on the side, pick whatever you like. We don't have time to do anything about your hair now, let alone your face,” she tutted. “Press op starts in three. Be at the waiting area behind the stage curtain in two!”
Dean suddenly couldn't think. The most expensive? He'd heard lots of talk around about how the budget kept being pushed up due to this and that problem, but
“Mom! We’ve got to get to mom!” Dean’s chair clattered to the floor as he stood. Sam was a few steps ahead of him though, long legs eating up the space between the kitchen and the room their mother was sleeping in.
That was all the warning Dean had before Castiel Four slid into him. He must have of course known Dean was well prepared for this event – that had been the main objective of his morning activities with Castiel One.
” Sam stressed, growing a little bored of this conversation already. It wasn’t like it was an issue Dean had raised with Castiel directly.
“Traditional protocol at this point would be for us to get dressed up, go out, share a meal and an activity of some sort.”
They hadn’t started here. They’d started with cuddling five months ago – or perhaps five years, maybe five decades ago? Even Castiel was losing track of time now. With no Dean or Sam on regular time to help him keep relative to human time, he was back to the fluid-time experience he’d had before he’d met them. Where the days and weeks passed in but a blink of the eye.
“He’s my best friend.” Dean was trying to be stoic but Sam could see his walls were breaking down. “If it doesn’t work out, I don’t got much else. If we don’t work out…” Dean was stood almost toe-to-toe with Castiel now. “I didn’t expect to feel like this about you, about anyone. But here we are, just two dumbasses, and yeah, I think I maybe in love with you.”
It was almost a shame. Castiel had some nice crops in there he practiced with often for writing purposes.
“Nope, and I’m not going to force her into telling me. You can’t force people to out themselves, even if it is pretty obvious they aren’t studying every evening.”
“I'll give you this much: damn entertaining film, son. It was so fucking crazy it must be genius,” John praised.
Castiel was determined but kind while he prepped Sam. Every now and then reaching around to stroke or simply feel Sam’s cock, hands and fingers seemingly everywhere as he made sure Sam was feeling relaxed and happy. Even as he slid into Sam he kept peppering Sam’s back and ass with little touches, silently letting Sam know
“I still meant it,” Castiel said firmly. “I’ll always mean it, I wouldn’t just throw around words like that because–”
“It was a damn horse breeding bench, I'd swear on my mamma's grave,” John helpfully added, apparently close to laughter himself.
“Processed, agreed! Now fuck me,” Dean said a bit agitated. He was never at his most polite while horny.
“And that's why you're a professional, Dean,” Bela slipped in with a smile. “We have complete faith in you and Gabriel here to get the job done right.
He didn’t elaborate more, and Sam didn’t ask. He could guess, but after the weeks (months?) of trouble he’d been having trying to get the new soul sector open, Sam wasn’t really in the mood to hear Castiel’s troubles, as selfish as it might be.
Sam rolled his eyes and adjusted himself in his chair. "Don't pretend like that was what you meant, Dean." Sam turned to face Castiel.
At 1pm on the dot there was a sudden burst of light followed by a dull thud: a second Castiel had materialized into existence. He stood to the side just in time for a third burst of light as another Castiel, followed by another, and another, and another, and so on until the room held nine Castiels in total. A long moment passed when Dean thought that must be all of them, but finally a tenth (and this time final) Castiel appeared in the library too.
The first group of demons approached Sam two years after Chuck's ugly demise. Things were falling apart in Hell. The demons were falling apart and the sections of Hell required to house all of the souls were slowly but surely cracking up.
“It puts him into a better headspace,” Castiel confirmed. “Sam,” Castiel paused to ensure he had Sam’s full attention, “This can’t last forever. This isn’t a permanent solution. We’ve agreed on that.”
Sam snorted a laugh. “Hopefully should hear by the end of the week if I’ve got to the second round of interviews.”
“Do you understand now?” Ten was enough surely to give him a taste? Castiel didn’t want to take things too far.
“Dean, Dean Winchester. Your co-star. I was glad to hear what a delight I was on set, by the way,” he added.
He thought he might soon grow bored of pizza, but his appetite for it didn’t seem to abate. There was just too much pleasure to be had from the whole process.
“Together?” Sam looked at Castiel in surprise. “What do you mean?” Castiel had been woken up first though, he must have seen something Sam hadn’t.
Sam shrugged one shoulder. “Not hating it.” Though he hated how after only a week at Dean’s place he felt like he was moving through molasses all the time. His brain didn’t feel sharp like it used to. At first he’d put it down to fatigue from the move, but several days on, it just felt a lot like apathy.
Dean observed him walking around naked, smiling at how dorky yet adorable Castiel was. Dean took a moment while Castiel was busy with the room climate control to grab lube and condoms for them.
Castiel let out a laugh and maneuvered his pinky finger into Dean as well. “I think you’re doing it on purpose now.” He sped up and jammed his fingers in rougher, more like a finger punch. “It’s funny how soft you are here,” he wiggled his fingers, “while being so hard here,” Castiel nodded towards Dean’s dick.
Dean looked up at Castiel, concern dropping onto his face. “Of course I had fun, I’d tell you otherwise. You’ve got no reason to doubt yourself.”
Now the idea was in his head, Castiel wanted to test it out. To see if it was anything like his dream-self had thought and if he’d enjoyed it as much as his dream-self had.
“That’s what my brother Sammy said too, you two really should meet one day.” Dean winked at Jack. “He’s a lot older than you too. The gummy bears must be magic.”
Moments before Dean had made the decision to kiss Castiel, Dean had spotted Bela a few feet away. Months of pent up anger at the woman for creating the disaster they were about to go in and watch raced through him. Then, he'd noticed Castiel just behind him.
“That's the thing about life: you never know what's around the corner. Magic or mayhem, unless you are there, you'll never find out.”
"Dean, you want to do my gardening as well?" Castiel had his phone on loudspeaker so he could eat breakfast while talking to Dean. It was practically second nature to him now to use the loudspeaker when the phone call involved Dean. He found it useful to ensure he had both hands free on such ocassions.
And it would be all the better, knowing he had Castiel by his side, now, then, and hopefully forever.
“When are you due to hear about that job again? I hope it is soon so I can get you out of this place.”
Castiel weighed this up. “Not so much that. I don't think they expected Chuck to go off the deep end like he did.”
“Yeah,” Sam answered, trying not to show his panic. Castiel seemed perfectly at ease in the kitchen. Almost like he hadn’t just tracked Sam down and was currently standing in his Dean’s kitchen.
“No,” Castiel explained, “that was an article of furniture the centauricorns use to sit down on more comfortably. Or so they told me anyway.”
Celia waved Dean away. "Yeah, yeah. Guess I should be getting back." She stood from her stool with a sigh. "Unless you want me to stay for the company?"
Castiel lent back in his chair, amazed. “That's so cool. So really you had the rude child to thank?”
in Polish. Dean hadn't been able to pay much attention as he'd been too distracted looking at Castiel's lips and the joy in the other man's expression as he explained his play.
It was something Sam had been wondering. He and Dean hadn’t exactly been on talking terms when Dean and Carmen had split.
“Be quiet,” Castiel commanded, bringing his hand down harder, and harder, and harder, until Dean’s right buttock was about the colour of a cherry while the left remained untouched, unspoiled. The heat radiating from the right one enough for Castiel to feel as he knelt down and placed a gentle kiss to the right cheek.
Dean had nodded, agreeing. Not realizing his dad hadn't known his pay was in part to be a percentage of box office returns on the film. He
“Are you in pain?” Castiel was halfway to a panic, fearing he’d somehow injured Dean already, and not in the manner they’d been discussing. “Can I do anything? What’s the–” Castiel’s brain caught up with the feeling of wetness on the top of his thighs. “Did you just orgasm, Dean?”
“I think it was sexy,” Cas told him, voice low. “Seeing you enjoy something so much? You get so lost in awe when you’re focused on something that pleases you. A doctor who is also into classic cars? Double hot.”
It was the year 2289, and Dean Winchester had had enough. Yeah, Castiel was there visiting, but it wouldn’t be for long. He wouldn’t stay. They wouldn’t go to bed, kissing and holding each other like they used to.
Dean wanted to call him out on it. Wanted to ask if everything he’d said about Dean’s aging body still being beautiful to him was true or not. Wanted to ask if Castiel had missed sex more than he’d thought.
“They are telling me to rip up my beautiful masterpiece and torture it!” Chuck Shurley announced to the cast, who had been assembled for a first read through. “I might as well puke on it now, because that's what it will become.”
As the climate on Earth had crumbled into fiery, human-caused shame, and the humans had fled to other planets and zones, Dean and Castiel had taken advantage to use the wasteland to expand the garden. If someone was to find the edge and peek over the wall, they would find only death and ruin on the other side; all the markings of an Earth left abandoned long ago.
"You don't need to be, it turns out. We checked the rules and sub laws. Crowley made a few interesting administration choices when he was considering leaving Hell to Dean."
“We can buy them for each other,” Castiel explained to Jack. “Same with Ben’s moms, or any of the moms and dads. You can buy them for yourself too. Though, Dean doesn’t like flowers, I think I’ll get him something else. What do you think Dean might want?”
had-definitely-seen-better-days bar stools. His. So yeah, if he decided to play classic rock all day, that was also his decision and the preppies taking up room at the bar could always leave.
Dean turned the music up hoping to startle Dennis awake so he'd leave too. It didn't look like anyone else would be visiting the bar tonight, especially not the only people Dean really wanted to see.
The group started to split up soon after the third (maybe fourth? Possibly it was their fifth) round of shots. No one appeared to notice as Castiel and Dean caught a taxi together back to the hotel Dean was staying in.
They'd later traveled to Sierra Leone so Castiel could take part in the charity project he'd help set up to build homes there. Getting to see a small part of Africa had been such an amazing experience. Dean had gone to bed each night excited like never before to see what the next day would bring. Every day felt like they were really accomplishing something to help people, with their very own hands.
Dean pinned Castiel against the closed door, arms crossed behind Castiel’s back, embracing him, breathing him in as he indulged in the moment.
Later that evening, when he finally allowed himself to self pleasure, he came in record time. And as he drifted off to sleep he wondered when he'd started seeing green instead of white stars at the point of bliss.
“That is oddly specific. Another kink of yours?” Castiel slowed his strokes on their cocks. He could tell from the way Dean was tensing things would be over soon if he didn’t.
“It’s like, guh,” Dean hissed, his cock was now wet with precome. “Like this blast of happiness. Of knowing you want me so much you’re prepared to get naked in front of me.”
“Sam, what’s wrong?” Castiel had wrapped Dean’s robe around him securely and stood, frowning with concern as he watched Sam pace up and down the length of the kitchen.
Dean was so vulnerable when he was turned on, so prone to honesty. It was something Castiel had only discovered about the other man since they’d first gotten together the previous month. It was also just one of the many reasons he knew he had to protect Dean from others. Had to do everything he could to ensure he was the only being that got to see Dean like this for the rest of their lives.
Dean had his eyes shut and was leaning in. Sam smiled and went to creep out of the room to give them some privacy. Their lips were a hair away from touching Sam looked back a final time. He was happy for them.
Without Dean saying it, Sam knew he was thinking of their mom in that moment, back in the Apocalypse world, dealing with the knock-on consequences of Michael's obliteration. Even with him gone, they still had many other rogue angels to take out and a society to rebuild.
“This lady at the studio worked out, with a big enough flop, they'd trigger some insurance clause and could cancel out their tax bill for the next few years. I don't pretend to understand the specifics, but, basically any movie they start after this? They're going to start in profit and without paying tax.”
“You look so hot doing that,” Dean encouraged. “You’re the sexiest thing I’ve ever seen. Ain’t no porn that’s ever been this good, ain’t no being that’s ever turned me on as much as you do just sitting there.”
Other than Dean and a guy sat in the back of the bar, known as Dennis – who was hopefully asleep and not dead – the bar would be empty once Celia left. Just as it often was these days.
As they still had no leading female, the centauricorn actors hadn't even started filming their stuff yet. It meant Dean got to spend a lot of time with Donna and Jody and grew to like them very quickly.
He tried not to feel like this was a sign of the encroaching computer supremacy the films of his childhood had promised.
One by one they all went around the circle announcing their number until, “I must be Castiel… One? As this is my first time.” The other Castiels nodded.
“But I know you have to.” Dean's voice wobbled, even though he didn't want it to. “Why do I feel like this after only a few days?” he begged of Castiel.
Heaven or Hell should have had first dibs to Dean’s soul, with neither option worrying Dean given who was in charge. He knew though that if he didn’t end up in either of those places, he’d just be booted out to Purgatory, something they’d all agreed no one wanted. The Empty wouldn’t touch Dean even if they begged, leaving just Purgatory to contend with.
“The twins are great kids,” Dean shrugged. “Felt wrong not getting them something. I, er, got something for you too.” Dean pulled a bottle out of the bag. “Sorry it isn’t wrapped. Happy Valentine’s Day.”
Castiel thought a second. “Sometimes. If I’m not picking up on things quickly enough, then you should be more direct. You deserve all the pleasure I can give you, Dean. And no matter how much I try, I am not always good at noticing subtle hints.”
“No. You just seemed so... mature? I guess I assumed you were older. You look beautiful, but I had no idea how old you were.”
He was pretty amazed she'd made it this far without revealing what a big fan girl she apparently was. Dean was quietly thankful for this.
“I'm hungry,” Donna sighed, slouching. “I hate this movie star diet thing. They have whole tables of catering food and I can't touch any of it.”
The bar was exactly the kind of place Sam would expect Dean to drag him. It was the type of divebar he hadn’t been to in years. The onion rings were greasy and the beer was chilled though.
“Eh, I’m okay,” Dean shrugged off. “Sorry about the gummy.” They’d grabbed what was left of the gummy bear on their way of of Jack’s bedroom. The kid had somehow managed to eat almost half of it in the short time he’d been left alone with it.
build houses around the world. We need a big cash injection for a new group of homes we're trying to get done in Sierra Leone. Everything is stuck at the permit stage right now.”
“Castiel, if you really think he feels for you the way you hope he does, he’s not going to take this well.”
The studio tried to convince Dean to stay on, do another film by himself. Dean had considered it, but ultimately knew the fans would be disappointed. Plus, to have one brother and not the other? It would just sound like they'd have to kill off Logan and killing off one brother would have upset too many.
Dean shot him a smile. “No problem. For now though, we better go do shots with Jody. You don't wanna know what she'll do if we don't join in.”
“We were signed up for five films originally, Sammy and I. Fifth film finishes and they wanted to negotiate to keep us for another five. But by that point Sam's already eyeing up college. We agreed to two more. Since the writers knew there was just two more, they killed off the aunts in the sixth so the seventh–”
Sam shrugged. “I think it’ll help save me, if I’m being honest. I’ve nearly forgotten, Cas, what humanity feels like. A garden would give me a rest as well. We have the power now to expand this safe zone outside of the walls of the building. To build a dome of spelled wards over the land so Dean can see the sunlight again. To let him go outside once more.”
Upon hearing this, Dean quickly flicked through to his schedule notes and let out a breath of relief when he found out he wasn't also scheduled to be waxed.
“Yeah?” she was distracted, anxious, now in a budding panic over what she’d just potentially done to her liver.
“Hey, Benny. Cas here was just telling me about his time in New York.” Dean tried not to bristle at their quiet time being interrupted. Especially as it was meant to be a party. But he'd been kinda enjoying having Castiel all to himself.
With the demons more-or-less under control, Hell became less of an issue. Demons became less of an issue. Sure, they were still required to gank those that couldn't stay in order enough to obey a simple 'don't fuck up' rule. A little mischief went unnoticed, and he allowed them to keep making their deals. It was harm of unsuspecting bystanders Sam outlawed.
Sam took a deep breath in and exhaled slowly. He appeared to Dean to be a little dazed. Sam probably didn’t even realize how much of the Earth was now part of the garden.
“I heard they were making a spin-off film about the Jones' brother aunts and their backstory?” Benny chipped in, changing the topic. “Been wanting to ask you about it for ages, if I'm being honest.”
“Cosmopolitan? I didn’t know I was one of the Sex and the City girls now, Dean,” Sam commented, but still picked up the glass and took a sip. “Taken you a few hundred years, but you do know how to mix a good drink.”
“Oh brother,” Benny sighed. Dean took a peak and saw Benny had a blue cover. In fact, most of the people at the table had blue covers.
Not many people would consider hanging out at Jody’s house, wrapped in blankets, and eating soup to be a vacation, the Winchesters had never been
“We’re immortal, Sam, and I’m still technically an angel. If we can’t get a little biblical every now and then, who can?” Cas said while helping Dean into his own robe.
To Castiel’s relief Dean turned out to be competent, efficient, and even artistic when it came to doing yard work.
“Who’s next?” Castiel Five asked. His cock looked like a slight breeze would be enough to make him cum, but he was determined to not hog Dean all to himself. He wanted Dean to have the group sex experience he truly deserved.
Castiel took Jack off and helped him wash up and change into clean clothes. He had Jack in bed and was reading him a story when Dean popped into his bedroom, a glass of ginger tea with him.
Sure, it was going to be the end of his acting career, especially as he hadn't been smart like Donna and Jody had and taken another job already, but standing in that hotel room, having Castiel fix up his hair? Dean couldn't seem to care. He'd lost one thing only to gain another.
All alcohol served in the last 100 years was genetically engineered to get you drunk without the organ damage. It was somewhat ironic to Dean that in an age when this was possible, most people got their highs off direct brain stimulation. It did make some sense though: why introduce substances to create the effect your brain could achieve instantly?
A happy Dean meant a good life for all of them. If that meant Sam had to help fit hooks and pulleys to the beams of the bar, he’d be happy to do so.
“I don't want you to go,” he admitted, shifting on his seat delicately to get the best position for his throbbing behind.
There was definitely something to all of this that made Castiel feel Dean had gotten it right falling into lust with the virtual world of desire he’d been stuck in so often.
“Around two months altogether. And then I'm off to help with the housing project before I'm needed back here for press and the final film release.”
Dean shrugged. “I won't lie, it's true, I don't have to worry for a bit. My folks were good to me and Sam. They put every cent we made into a trust that we had access to only when we turned 18. Sam used the money to go off to college, bought himself a nice apartment in the city. I invested in some property.” He took a sip of his beer. “I guess because we never used the money before that, I kind of forget I have it? But it's true, I don't exactly have to think about these things.”
Castiel knew a place nearby they walked over to. Sam wondered if it counted as a walk of shame when he didn’t, in fact, feel any shame.
The schedule this time around was more packed this time than it had been before Dean's mini break from the film. They had a variety of endings to film and then the pick-up shots of scenes filmed previously that hadn't come out well.
“Definitely. Something more believable then. Twelve inch cocks, St. Andrew’s Cross, and a vat of lube? Maybe someone called Dr. Sexy and his nurse, Thrusto, whose prostate is higher up than normal and requires a simply enormous dick before his itch can be scratched?”
Castiel didn’t get a verbal response to his out pour of love. Dean’s lips wrapped around his cock two seconds later were as much of a thank you as he needed though.
“Castiel, it has to be you,” Balthazar declared to the assembled members. Another Balthazar nodded his agreement.
“I’m angry at myself!” Dean took a deep breath. “I’m angry with myself,” he repeated, quieter this time. “Cas, you’re my best friend.”
She opened up her Kay device (which Dean still referred to as his cellphone in his mind) and scanned an image of the drink in. Sipping a little more of the beer, she pulled another face. “Seriously, gross.”
“We’ll tell you all that later. Don’t know the full story ourselves yet. Claire’s been spearheading this one.”
Even Celia’s flirting wasn’t enough to make him smile most days. The respite between periods of feeling like he was useless weren’t really enough any more.
A knock at the door was what finally made them stop. Breathing hard and plump lips red from being bitten and sucked, they separated.
“Hi Claire,” Dean called over to Claire who was sitting quietly reading. Considering her previous excitement at Dean coming over for the evening, she was doing a remarkable job at pretending she hadn’t realized he’d arrived.
“Pfffft,” and an eye roll was Dean’s only response. He revved up his engine and had pulled away before Sam even finished putting the coordinates into his GPS.
Jody laughed. “You know she ‘liberated’ several other people from Heaven along her away who weren’t done living just yet? You boys have a lot to catch up on.” Jody looked around, hands twitching for her gun.
There was a highly environmental and political message, but without being overly preachy. And to keep the film from being considered hypocritical, the entire thing was going to be carbon neutral by staging everything on a set and using green screen to add most background elements. Which also meant no travel and that they should be able to keep to the film's tight schedule.
“Definitely. It will take me a while probably to get something else off the ground, but, definitely.”
Dean this time was on his back, ankles crossed behind Castiel's back. They exchanged wet, hot kisses as Castiel continued to drive in and out of Dean, fulfilling his every need, his every desire. Dean using his legs to encourage Castiel into his favorite rhythm.
Sam snorted with laughter down the phone. “Wow. You're really gone on him, aren't you? To bring out your chick flick side.”
“Lizzabelle,” Castiel said firmly, trying to get her attention as she looked up things on her Kay. How he knew her name was something Dean didn't know. He just accepted that Castiel knew all names these days.
This was their first Valentine’s Day as a couple. They’d been dating almost a year, definitely long enough that he wanted to buy Dean something more meaningful than a generic box of chocolates and a teddy bear. He was also cooking dinner for Dean to make up for the fact they couldn’t eat out since Castiel hadn’t been able to get a babysitter in time.
Charlie flashed a smile at her. “Empty threats, Jody. Where would I even get laxatives? It isn’t like they sell them in stores.”
After they’d all cum in his mouth they started fucking him again. Castiel Two and Castiel Eight took an opportunity to fuck Dean at the same time. Dean was barely ejaculating anymore, already too rinsed out of seminal fluid. His cock didn’t mind the attention they continued to lavish on him. His nipples were well sucked and bitten too.
The silence of the apartment got to Sam in the time Dean was out. Even if Dean wasn’t being useful, just having him there, a familiar anchor in a sea of uneasiness, had somehow made the process better. Sam had tried to be practical, tried to tell himself to just think of the next step, then the next, one at a time until he made it to the end. Stopping to think about the unknowns of the future was too fretful a thought.
Sam ruffled his hair to try and disperse some of the flatness that had built up from his afternoon sofa adventures.
Dean nodded fondly. “Of course. April and Emma were there as Sam and I grew up. They're good people.”
Sam was thankful to find Dean gone by the time he had finished cleaning himself up, but he persisted into the evening trying to get details. To Dean’s credit, he’d cooked for both of them before he started again with the questions.
Castiel was also pretty sure Dean’s previous activities would have him already primed for something more. Judging by how quickly Dean accepted his invite, he was correct.
“And I with you. Would you like a bath before we sleep? After the bath we can watch the footage back.”
The patrons to the bar had died off, literally and metaphorically, as the world around them changed. No one was interested in the ancient history inside the bar anymore. The wards woven into the brick of the building had gotten stronger over the years to the point where humans would barely dare to step foot inside, leaving Dean most months to himself.
Everything going well, several future versions of Castiel should appear in the bunker at 1pm. Castiel and Dean had spoken about the possible eventuality that no one would appear, in the event that they never did manage to get control enough over the time device to make it to this exact spot at the right time. Deep down though, Dean knew future Castiels would appear, he just had a sense that they wouldn’t let themselves fail at something they both wanted so much.
“I can’t see why not. We wouldn’t even have to use it. All we’d have to do would be set up a time and a date, and then get future versions of me to come back to that point and I can have group sex with you all by myself.”
“The secret to a long life is being happy about the idea of getting older," he said in lieu of a reply.
“I’m so sorry, Sam,” Castiel uttered lowly soon as Dean and Mary were out of earshot. “I should have put one and one together and realized who you were. Dean’s talked of you often and,” Castiel scrunched his face up, “I’ll tell him everything. Tell him it wasn’t your fault.”
Dean did his best to figure out if each taste of cum was any different to the last and thought at times there were changes, but it was hard to be sure with the pace the Castiels were pumping into his mouth. The main thing he was aware of with each mouthful was a slight difference in consistency, tied probably to how hydrated that Castiel was.
“I feel the same.” Castiel smiled sadly back at Dean. “I have a lot to thank Hannah for, getting me involved in all this.”
The kid pouted and tried a bit more of the beer. “Yeah, you warned me. I just thought it’d be cool to try something, you know,
Dean sat, trying to take it all in. Eyes flitting around his suite, he suddenly realized: “That probably explains why they were so quick to give into me requesting this stupidly huge hotel room too. More to expense in the final budget.”
Castiel look was pained, eyes creased with well-worn kindness. “It doesn’t, but I appreciate the thought. I’m happy just being here with you. You have a good heart, Sam.”
“Do you know how to fix a windowpane?” Castiel questioned Dean when the kids had left so they could get dressed for the day.
"G'night Sam, Cas," Dean murmured a couple hours later, kissing his fingers and touching them lightly to the photo on his bedside table. He missed them some nights more than others. Mostly he missed them during the day. The long, long day. As fewer and fewer people were coming to frequent the bar, Dean started to wonder more often what the point was of staying open.
Castiel’s bushes had never looked so neatly curated. It helped that Castiel had Dean coming back for an hour three times a week just to check out the garden, get in among the weeds and really look hard at the soil. Dean always did so on bent knees, face deep among the plants, ass up in the air. Often he took his shirt off first so the soil didn’t get on that when he delved in.
“It is better than the Ma'lak Box,” Dean had commented with a shrug from his deathbed, as they explained to him the conclusion they’d arrived at. The bar was much bigger, for starters. He had decent sized living quarters and the bar to survive and live in. For a man who had spent hours of his life in years gone by contemplating how he should spend the rest of his days living on a far-flung planet or in that damn box, he was doing pretty well.
“Then I’m clearly not doing this well enough,” Castiel Four lamented, driving his dick in again and rotating his hips. “Humms, it’s been a few weeks since I last took you from this angle, but I think it should be...” he tilted his hips slightly and smiled happily when Dean shuddered and shivered.
"I ran the numbers, and a few hundred potential scenarios, but it all boils down to: there isn't. The endgame on getting anyone but you involved is that… well, you'd kill them eventually. We thought we should just skip the queue and," he gestured to Sam. "You're the logical choice for King of Hell."
They kept at it, Castiel Four giving Dean his dick hard and fast, both of them approaching a hypnotic rut of moving flesh. At some point Castiel Four’s inner elbow ended up around Dean’s throat, helping Dean stay balanced on the arm of the sofa as well as giving Castiel Four a good levering point to pound him even deeper. They both knew just how tight Castiel could be around Dean’s throat, where the perfect balance was between erotically helpful and Dean passing out accidentally.
“He wants more, constantly more,” Castiel explained, trying to get through to Sam what was being created here. That Dean’s desire to achieve his preferred headspace was taking increasingly extreme measures as time went on.
“That's sort of the problem,” said a miserable sounding Kevin, their new writer. “We have too many endings.”
Castiel shot Dean a worried look, now suddenly feeling nervous himself. Dean in turn took Castiel's hand in his own.
“And then since they knew I'd been apprenticing Chuck, I was brought in to help,” he finished with a squeak. “I don't know why! I've never even written a screenplay before! I was mostly just writing blog entries for him about cats!”
“Although...” Castiel inserted a second finger, also on his right hand. “I don't hear much begging, now I think about it. A little whore like yourself,” Castiel paused a moment, to give Dean the chance to veto his language, “you're probably very good at begging, aren't you?”
“Oh. Would you like me to... leave?” Castiel asked stiffly, feeling like that was the end of things between him and Dean.
“You’re just annoyed I hit that before you did,” Sam teased, sensing Dean’s walls were crumbling. When he thought about that time with Castiel, he couldn’t even remember the specifics of the night. How big was Castiel’s dick even? It was all so fuzzy in his head now.
“I just find it hilarious!” Dean snickered. “The film was nonsense yet the critics and bloggers seemed to love it. Like they've never heard of
“I was so confident though, in the dream world. Over how I could make others happy in that way. It’s something I… lack in the real world.”
Castiel nodded. “I’d like that, Sam.” They exchanged phone numbers and Sam used the opportunity to get Castiel to input his name so he could look up what the hell it meant without having to figure out the correct spelling.
“Let me get this straight: you are happy to hit on random guys at bars, with the knowledge you might get rejected, but you’re not prepared to tell your best friend that you’re head over heels in love with him?”
“No, but I’ve lived much longer than you, and spent most of that not knowing happiness or the concept. And then I found you and Dean, and everyone else in our weird, perfect little family. At some point I figured it’s about time I learn how to be happy. Things aren’t perfect right now,” Sam snorted at the understatement, “but when are they ever? We’re together though.”
Castiel put his thumbs in under the elastic of his boxer shorts and used them to slowly leverage the fabric down. Dean started bucking into his own fist the moment Castiel’s pubic hair first appeared over the top of the shorts. Castiel paused again upon seeing this, his own dick now hard – though he knew it could get harder.
Mary laughed at Dean’s question. “I hoped. Well, I’d seen the ring. If he wasn’t proposing to me I knew I had to dump him.”
, it kept Heaven and Hell from arguing where he deserved to end up. It kept harmony in the universe.
They’d started slow, trying to remember each others’ bodies. Trying to remember what they’d both taken for granted when they’d first become physically intimate with one another. Dean had taken surprisingly well to being handcuffed to his bed while Castiel slid into his already loose, sloppy hole. Dean had shown Castiel different types of ropes they could try, different uses to anti-gravitation booths that he’d seen in his virtual pornography travels. They’d taken full advantage of the new room Sam had created to reconnect in a way they hadn’t in so long.
“I’ve missed you, Dean.” Castiel kissed Dean’s neck so softly before he took a step back. “What shall we do next?”
. You’ve only just met you can’t have had an argument already, that’s…” he trailed off and looked at both of them again. Swallowing, Dean took a step back. “Unless you had already met before.”
. The place that was more than just a base of operations. He missed it in the way he used to miss Heaven before that became just some place he used to live, used to exist. It didn’t hold for him the same sense of peace it used to before he’d met Dean Winchester.
“Please, please,” he panted after what felt like forever. “Please, fuck me. I need your cock inside me.”
“You’re in love with him,” Sam pointed out. “And the fact that I don’t have to specify names? That’s because it applies to both of you.”
“Now I know about the mess the film is going to definitely be, I can get ahead and start booking work for after. Donna suggested TV. I'd never thought of it before then, but now, I sort of like the idea.”
He really didn’t know why. It just seemed a really Dean-thing. “Isn’t it the point of humanity? Reproduce and leave a bit of yourself behind?”
Eileen. That was who he wanted to see. But since Eileen was out saving the world, and Sam was… Sam cast his thoughts for what there was to do. Dean laughed from inside and he could hear Castiel join in too.
Dean didn’t blush, he wasn’t sure he had the ability to feel embarrassed anymore about his desires. That didn’t mean he wanted Sam to know all his business, though.
In theory, if he had gone to Heaven Sam would’ve never seen him again, and if he’d gone to Hell, Cas would never see him again. But there was a general unspoken understanding they’d find a way to make it work. Find a way to make sure they didn’t have to go without ever seeing each other at the same time ever again.
It was fun finding new places and things with Castiel. Fun because Castiel seemed to look upon everything as if it was so new to him and so precious, even though he was the one with much more world experience than Dean had.
What we've just seen is the first official footage. We've recently wrapped up on shooting and are now in post-production.
Things were going to be okay, Dean decided about halfway up to the tree house, where Sam was already sitting and throwing down jibes about how Dean laid eggs.
He smiled widely, knowing everyone would jump on a story if there was even a slightest hint of acrimony between him and Sam, or him and the cast of this film.
“That's because I went off my diet, I was just bloated from eating 20 buffalo wings before that take! Cas, tell them my character wasn't pregnant!”
“Warming, hey? Orange flavor? Good choice.” He pumped a good quantity into his palm and then proceeded to stroke his hand down between Dean's pert buttocks, smearing the lube around his hole. Slowly Castiel moved up and down over Dean's hole, but still didn't go within.
The audience of journalists gathered clapped politely at the teaser. Dean thought they were being kind considering they'd been shown almost nothing.
“He’s in love with you, you’re in love with him...” Sam looked between his brother and Castiel, silently imploring them to just get over whatever this block was.
They sat down next to each other in the screen, Dean's family sitting around them. Castiel's sister, Hannah, was of course in attendance, but as the two were still pretending not to know each other, she was sat with the other studio big shots in another part of the cinema screen.
, that did shock Dean a moment. He’d really stopped being able to tell ages a while ago, truth be told.
He waved at Jody and Donna and walked towards them, panting to get his breath back. He inhaled deeply and tried to normalize his breathing after all the running about. It was then that he noticed the shirt had a scent to it that he just could not place. It also struck Dean as odd that he was the only one there in such informal clothes, with his co-stars in either button-ups and suit jackets or fancy looking dresses.
Sam noticed Dean watching a couple make out near the pool table. Their waitress seemed unworried about it and squeezed past them en route to delivering their food.
“You know why!” Dean shouted, standing up again and closing the space between them. “You fucking know why.”
The mix tape. Sam recalled Dean had made Castiel a mix tape. That wasn’t nothing, especially coming from someone like Dean.
There'd been a lot of upset when Sam announced he wouldn't renew his contract for more. Dean's younger brother just wasn't interested in continuing in Hollywood – or not at least until after he'd secured a degree or two.
“Oh. Oh fuck.” Dean leaned back against the sofa and placed his hands over his face. “Oh fucking fuck.”
Being the King of Hell didn’t feel anything like Sam assumed it would. They came to him with problems and he made decisions, found solutions. Sometimes over new-soul allocations, other times over who was allowed overtime or just how many paper napkins they needed to order.
No Castiel would fault Dean if his cock-sucking lips and tongue were not as attentive as they normally were, after all Dean had never had his attention split like this.
Dean didn't have time to contemplate his clothes or even introduce himself to the people he didn't recognize, as that was the moment they were all directed out onto the stage so that the first official press conference for the film could begin.
Flipping over and crawling towards the headboard, Dean leaned over to grab the top of the solid-wood headboard as directed.
“Isn’t it? Some people like commitment.” Dean sighed. “You know, beyond a space in your closet and all.”
Dean leaned over the table and wrapped his knuckles on Sam’s skull. “Funny, not hollow after all.” He sat back. “Again, what the fuck, Sammy? Why would I think that?”
“I'm going to turn the thermostat up a little. I don't want you catching a cold just because you wanted sex instead of a towel.”
Castiel laughed gently. “I don't mean that in a jealous way,” he explained as they walked together towards the elevators.
Sam’s appetite was nonexistent and the steak he’d ordered tasted like nothing in his mouth. The hyper awareness of Castiel sitting next to him, with his brother and mother across from them, was just too much.
It was on the tip of Sam’s tongue to say no. He was curious about Dean’s cop friends though, curious enough to say “Sure, just let me wash up?”
“Anna is in her 40s, I know that much,” Dean replied. “I didn't think much of it. And besides, it isn't like our characters really do much together, romantically speaking.”
“Studio put me up here for the rest of this week.” Dean looked around his opulent surroundings. “I was going to use the time to explore the area a bit, never really spent much time in LA before. Did you feel like... joining me, maybe? If we go to the right part of town, no one is going to care who I am.”
Dean gasped with joy when he felt Castiel insert two fingers from what had to be his left hand this time.
Dean nodded. He’d noticed her jeans and t-shirt, looked exactly like the kind of get-up Claire used to wear so many centuries before.
Castiel couldn’t find any fault in that logic (other than to wonder what porn Dean watched where the plumber demanded a call out charge) and soon his character was a pizza delivery guy, with a penchant for sugar-dusted pastries and an oral fixation.
“You know that’s not how it works.” Castiel picked up on the jealousy in Dean’s tone, but was starting to feel annoyed. “Then why didn’t you tell me in the other world how you felt? This shouldn’t all be on me.”
“Wait, so, Dean's character was a half-centauricorn thingy?” Sam added in a confused tone. “And so he appeared human but really he was top-half centaur, bottom half... human? But somehow without the,” Sam mimed the unicorn horn all the centauricorns had, “horn?”
“You’re building a room onto Dean’s bar for he and I to have sex?” Castiel peered intensely at Sam, mildly amused that after so many centuries Sam could still be made ever so slightly uncomfortable at the topic of his brother’s sex life.
Castiel Five took his position behind a glowing Dean. He couldn’t resist pushing some of the escaping cum back into its warm, little home.
“I don't... sorry. That keeps coming out wrong. I'm more in... awe. I'm really not used to this Hollywood stuff.”
Dean silently cursed himself for putting Castiel on the spot. “I'm sorry. I'm sure you're very well qualified. It was just... an unusual move for them to take. If I'm honest, I feel like they're taking an even bigger risk on me.”
“Dean wouldn’t, you know? Even with everything that happened with dad, he didn’t hurt him, Cas. He’s loyal, damn loyal. Dean understands what we’re doing, that this is all for the greater good. We move him to Heaven or to Hell and we upset the balance of
Castiel looked over the table at him woefully and sat forwards so he could take one of Dean's hands in his.
The remaining Castiel’s not currently balls-deep in Dean were mostly palming themselves through their open pant zippers. Some contemplated the tableau before them wishing they were Castiel Four. Others considered what they would be doing differently if they were currently the ones hard dicking Dean. For Castiel One it was all a little overwhelming though. He was struggling slightly with feelings of jealousy, even though it was only he and he alone in the room with Dean.
“Sorry to hear that, kid,” Dean said from behind Castiel. “Why don’t you come sit down?” Dean gently guided Jack over to the couch. “What’s up?” He crouched down in front of Jack. Castiel noted that Dean had rid himself of his jacket finally and done up his shirt all before Jack could see him as he had been.
“Hey, Mr. Cas. Never known you to order pizza before. But easy delivery for me since I already knew where it had to go.”
“Most are,” Castiel sighed, adding his agreement to Dean’s statement. “Though, if they weren’t, would I even have a job?”
It was true, and Sam could hardly deny it. It was on the tip of his tongue to slam against the demon and decry it all as lies, but he still had the scar on his left shoulder that had come with what they'd done to fix Heaven. No amount of grace was going to heal that. It also wasn’t worth arguing that what they’d done for Heaven hadn’t been a permanent fix, so it hardly counted anyway. They still didn’t have enough angels to run the place. The fighting and sacrifice so far had just secured it for a little while so they could try and find a long-term solution.
“With your clumsy ass? I’ve got it covered. Plus I need to leave something for Claire to do when she gets back past curfew again.”
Dean had never been too happy doing the press bit before a movie release, but he was well rehearsed. He knew to stick to whatever the PR gurus told him, flash out a few cute stories around the production, and generally smile a lot.
“And this Castiel? No one knows who he is! We were meant to have one big named actor in this film, instead we have Jess Jones over here,” he said pointing towards Dean, “and some theater actor guy who isn't even on IMDB! His resume lists his only on-screen work as a commercial for yaks' milk in
“Oh,” Castiel laughed. “Then I apologize, I probably shouldn't have just left it about after I changed. Someone probably mistook it for the studio's and hung it up.”
“Blonde or brunette?” Dean asked through a mouthful of spaghetti. “Or a redhead? Did little Sammy find a fiery red head to bed?”
“They did all the market research, all the correct due diligence so that it won't look suspicious if people poke about. The film sounds crazy, but then Hannah said they signed up you and Anna, and who was going to question it then? Two legitimate stars brought together for the first time.”
“I wasn’t exactly the greatest fiance.” Dean hadn’t ever asked what happened, what the final straw was. Sam had no easy answer to give and didn’t feel like going into it right there and then.
“My friend works for them. I told him if he ever had a delivery to your address to let me know. I’d do the delivery for him and give him 100% of the tip, plus an extra $20.”
Flicking through the script, Dean was happy to note much of the dialogue remained the same. He wasn't very sure what had actually changed in the film until he read a scene opening.
Castiel pretended to consider the premise, eyes sparkling with love. “I just don’t think I can write that, Dean. Too kinky, too unbelievable. The audience would never buy into it.”
“You are not meant to talk about anything outside of the sex act, Castiel Ten,” Castiel One reminded him sharply.
Claire gave no sign of hearing him. “I got a present for you and Jack,” Dean tried again. That got Claire’s attention as she shot up to join her brother.
The poor reaper sent to get Dean was there for weeks while Sam and Castiel argued it out with Billie over Dean’s final resting place.
This was still one of his good days, he reminded himself. And that thought alone made the pain in his chest radiate fiercely.
Dean leaned down on his elbows to look the girl on the other side of his bar in the eye, and then he winked at her. “Don’t be telling everyone my secret now,” he teased, but he meant it genuinely. Social networks like Zeely continued to be a goldmine of free advertising for the bar as people had to brag about going somewhere so historic.
The plan concocted to resupply Heaven was so crazy Rowena had initially refused to be a part of it. The options available to them though were limited and Heaven cracked a little each passing second, wrecking Castiel’s nerves as he waited for it to all shatter apart.
The more he thought on it, the more sense it made. Thanks to Dean, Castiel had the cleanest pool for a ten-block radius. Other people might only have their pool cleaned every few weeks, but Castiel, who used the pool maybe twice a year, was sure to have his done sometimes four times a week. It just made him feel better for reasons he couldn’t put a finger on.
“There's no female centauricorns because they're all gynandromorphs! Why else were there no females?” Sam pointed out. “You were totally pregnant by the end. You were a pregnant half-centuaricorn, starting the job of repopulating the centauricorn population.”
After two weeks at Bobby's, his agent finally called to tell him he was due back on set Monday to finish off
“Um, try not to eat it all at once, okay, kid? My brother Sam did that once and um, it did not end well.”
Charlie and Dean ended up with a slice of both pie, with ice cream. Sam opted for the cherry, figuring that at least had some fruit involved.
“Turn over, grab the headboard,” Castiel replied after studying Dean and the bed. He sounded firm and Dean realized he kind of liked it. A lot.
Castiel stood up to put the bottle on a side table and grab the gift bag. Jack had been very insistent on helping to wrap the presents inside. A lot of glitter was involved for reasons Castiel couldn’t fathom but knew he’d regret when he cleaned up next.
Sam’s breath hitched as Castiel’s hand found its way to his cock again. Sam let out a half-sob when he finally came. Sam assumed Castiel must have come at some point too, as he noted with faint, dizzy bliss Castiel pull off and tie the condom he’d had on.
Their trust and faith in him was embracing, but Castiel wondered sometimes if it wasn’t also misguided.
Sam drew breath in, though what was he going to say? Dean had to have a clean license for his current job, unless he’d been lying to them about that in which case–
“Uh,” Sam’s brain started to reboot. “Yeah, yeah… it’s gone really well. I put in an application for one place, helping out at an NGO who deal with–”
“Hey, me too! I mean, not me too, I mean,” he rambled, and then composed himself. “My brother's at college there too at the moment. I dropped by him a few weeks ago. Never spent much time there, but it seemed cool.”
Dean groaned. “This film is going to be the death of me. But I suppose now, thanks to you, I at least know the universe was against me from the start on this one.”
“I just wish...” Dean trailed off with a sigh. “I just wish I'd been able to spend time with you earlier.”
They were at their hotel room, preparing for a party the studio was putting on to congratulate them all. Following the party, they had the premiere, and then would be out doing international press together for a few weeks.
“Everyone knows,” Donna agreed. “But focus, boys, focus. World end-y matters here. We’ve been busy the last few weeks while you were taking your extended nap time.”
Castiel just couldn’t contemplate that whatever Dean had done could be awful enough he was moved to tears.
“Probably was for the best,” Castiel looked a little wistful. “Everyone seemed to get on so well. We'd never have gotten anything done,” he chuckled.
“Where are you even reading this?” It was way too early in the morning and he was way too hungover to be dealing with this.
"That's not… an impossible idea," Castiel said slowly. "Angels exist in parallel universes still. There has to be one with enough to assist us."
Maybe that was the problem. He'd been doing films with his brother and a cast and crew who had become his second family.
“Prequel,” Benny explained, sounding a bit put out that he had to explain. “Everyone wants to know how Billie and Ellen got together.”
Years of work went into the planning, while they all helped out to keep Heaven going as much as possible. Propping up the crumbling infrastructure so badly needed to keep their world in one piece. And when they’d achieved everything they wanted to achieve, they realized one important thing they’d neglected: Heaven still needed a leader. They tried to make it work with a board of angels to debate and vote on matters, but too many critical decisions had to be made in the background to make this a consistently useful set-up.
“I do, kinda. I'm supposed to be leaving Thursday morning for Poland, for the play I wrote. We start work on Saturday.”
"I have to finish a draft of my new novel today, which means I'll be in my study. If something urgent does happen please feel free to call me over the kitchen intercom.”
“You’re exquisite,” Castiel murmured against Dean’s skin as he kissed up his neck. “A new surprise around every corner.”
The flush of Dean’s right butt cheek made Castiel feel connected to humans in a way not much else could anymore.
Preview ticket sales for the film have jumped through the roof since news of Dean Winchester's off-screen relationship to Castiel (no last name, how
They couldn't create new angels, and while they discovered demons and witches with proper bribes, force, or false-promises of future power, could be counted on to do the bare minimum to keep operations going, it was not a long-term plan and they needed long term.
Dean rolled his eyes. “I do have meeting coming up. Isn't like we've all just quit acting. I've got to get a new job yet. Especially now.”
Sam was sitting in a booth when Castiel returned to the bar area. Dean was passed out snoring on his bed. A bed Castiel hadn’t joined Dean in occupying for too long for Castiel to remember.
“This guy you’re in love with? You should tell him. You’re a great guy, anyone would be lucky to have you in their lives.”
Dean had missed the exact moment all the Castiels had gotten naked. He watched with sleepy eyes as they all redressed, enjoying the sight of the reverse striptease going on around him. Castiel One then brought out the refreshments they’d prepared earlier. Castiel One helped Dean to his share of water, Gatorade and bagel bites – Dean’s preferred after sex food. Castiel One and Dean huddled together on the couch, holding hands and feeling lucky about their lives.
His time with Dean always felt so natural and Castiel dearly hoped Dean enjoyed the companionship as much as he did himself. If Dean had to work so many odd jobs to support himself through college, Castiel hoped he could at least get a little pleasure out of the time they spent together.
“We’ll work on the idea this evening over pizza.” Castiel walked forwards and kissed Dean softly on the lips.
Dean fell asleep that night, wrapped warmly and safely in Castiel’s arms. Castiel had been very happy with Dean’s suggestion of cuddling. And when they were feeling more healed they agreed they would discuss moving onto
Suddenly Dean couldn't stop himself and he'd grabbed the other man and kissed him thoroughly. All thoughts of the people around them fleeing his mind.
“The air’s clean, right?” Dean grinned. “Smells amazing all year round. And if you look up there,” he pointed to the canopy of a small woodland section that had been started, Sam’s eyes followed the line of where Dean’s finger was pointing.
“Can you go pick up the U-Haul, Dean?” Parking being what it was on his street, Sam hadn’t wanted to get the thing any earlier than necessary. He didn’t want to trust Dean with finishing off the packing though.
“You taught me well.” Castiel dropped more kisses wherever he could reach on Dean. And though he wasn’t touching his own cock, it was enjoying this experience nonetheless.
Dean thought a moment. “Ultimately? No. I got to live a life plenty of other people have dreamed about. Done a lot of cool stuff, though not as cool as you.”
“Jump in a taxi now, go on. Fulfill that desire I'm sure you've always had to run after someone at the airport and declare your love,” Sam was laughing but Dean was quietly calculating in his head if it was too late for that.
“Ah, for you we're thinking topless as well, but nothing lower down, we'll cover that tastefully. But the nipples–”
At some point in his life, Dean Winchester turned (biologically) 80 years old. It was not a number he thought he’d ever lived to see. His hands shook when he opened his medication bottles and the cold air in the bunker made him hurt more often than not in the mornings. And in the evenings. And really all day every day, if he was being totally honest. Castiel’s grace could only fix so much. His touch brought joy to Dean now, not just from the fact it meant for a few days Dean felt young again, pain-free again, but also for the company he provided when he came to visit Dean to administer care.
“Ha!” Donna took another mouthful of wine, and then another, and then a third. “The script is a mess. You know, I've heard Chuck's being put into rehab?”
Between the deliveries and Dean’s work in Castiel’s yard, Castiel was seeing Dean almost every other day – sometimes more on days he let himself give into temptation.
This time they did dry off. Dean lent Castiel a clean shirt and he shucked on the jeans they'd discarded on their way to the shower the night before. He didn't have anything on under his jeans, but Castiel was usually content like that anyway.
Castiel pressed his lips to the damaged skin again before licking slowly up. There was no blood at this point for him to taste, but the flesh still had a slight tang to it. He kissed the undamaged cheek quickly and stood back up again.
The workbench that was just the perfect height for bending someone over and going to town, Castiel realized all at once. He shook his head to rid himself of the thought.
“What?” Dean jumped back, looking down at his outfit. “They told me to just take whatever I liked the look of from off the rack, I was, er, running a bit late,” he admitted sheepishly. He felt silly standing there so casually when Castiel was dressed so beautifully in a three-piece navy blue suit. The suit seemed to bring blue out in his already super blue eyes.
“I kept having these dreams about Eileen while we were under. Didn’t really realize it was her, but once I woke up it all just fit together.”
Castiel smiled, “I’m fine,” he assured Sam. “This is good.” He ran a finger over Sam’s left pectoral.
“I didn’t want to be with her though.” Sam shoulders were hunched and he curled up on himself a little. He so strongly remembered how he’d felt about Jess in the other world. “In the dream world, at least.”
“It’s a pleasure to meet you, Sam.” Castiel stuck his hand out and Sam was impressed at how steel-faced he was.
It became quickly apparent in the shower the Castiel was both a talker and a loud moaner. Dean's cock had been throbbing and untouched since he'd sunk to his knees.
Dean considered his a charmed life on the day of his 80th birthday. He’d really received everything he could have asked for. And when he finally died and joined the great beyond, to Heaven or to Hell, he knew he’d have his family not too far from him, always and forever.
“Eh,” Dean shrugged, rolling on his side now so he could face Castiel. “At least I’m cute enough to watch sleep.”
“How about something stronger?” Donna suggested. “There's a bottle of vodka in that cupboard. I think we could all use a shot or two before we have to head back to finish filming ending number... whatever number we're on.”
“Can you stop reading those reviews?” Castiel said dryly as Dean continued to laugh raucously while scrolling through a compilation of reviews he'd been emailed by his agent.
In the end they had to wait another three days to ensure Sam would be away from the bunker for at least 24 hours. It was one thing for them to know about their kinky, time-travel orgy and a completely different thing for Sam to walk in to find multiple versions of Castiel all screwing Dean.
Dean would have replied but he was too busy mouthing the cock that had appeared in front of him. He nuzzled good, rubbing it up against his cheek and around his lips – his favorite lipstick for sure.
“Oh, God. Now it makes sense why they hired a director who'd only done commercials before! They wanted him to do everything thirty times out of nervousness. And poor Kevin Tran, his writing career is going to be over.”
Castiel rummaged through the bathroom cabinet for the ear thermometer he had in his first aid kit. He was walking back to his boys when he heard the unmistakable sound of a child vomiting.
He gently stroked the hair off Dean’s face and tucked it behind his ears. Dean’s hair had been so short a year ago when Castiel had first met him. Now it was long enough that it fell into his eyes a little…
They moved to the bedroom the three of them had been sleeping in, being sure to turn the key in the lock and keep Sam from accidentally coming in while they were in the middle of whatever was about to happen.
Castiel rolled his eyes but leaned in to kiss Dean soundly, mingling their breath together for a moment, the pistoning action stopping so they could share in these other sensations completely.
Between the pain, irritation, and boredom at not being able to move like he was used to, Sam’s thoughts had been consumed mulling over what they’d experienced.
“Heh, yeah. I guess.” Looking over the mountains of food still on the table, Dean picked what he wanted to have next.
, he told Sam of Castiel's theory that Dean hadn't enjoyed the last film so much because it didn't feel like family. Because he'd been used to having family around him. That Cas thought a TV series might fix that.
“They do, they definitely do. And you make me feel like I could have anything in the world. I'm not afraid of the future because it doesn't matter what I do so long as I'm around to spend more time with you.”
“Basically, yeah,” Castiel agreed. “It was one of my dumber plans, and in fact, one of my least useful skills. Turns out, most places? You can't just rock up and start fishing.”
“What's your back-up plan for when this film fails and you're exposed as a fraud? Being a child actor is one thing, but helming a film rumored to be the most expensive since
Dean quirked his lip. “She’s kickass,” he said with an approving nod. “She might take pity on you and agree to a date, you know, once your arms are strong enough again that you can actually wash your own hair, dress yourself, all those little things.” Dean smirked at Sam as if he wasn’t in the same boat.
Suddenly Dean was laughing, full of nervous energy. “This is one of the weirdest things that's ever happened in my life. These last few months. Then to cap it off, I meet you.”
“It's television man, most likely I get in for one or two episodes of a show, and then that show gets canceled anyway,” Dean argued, trying to be the practical one.
Castiel snapped his fingers and the cuffs disappeared from Dean’s wrists. Dean tried not to feel upset about the release given the deep, red marks left behind. He rubbed at the marks while Castiel and Sam talked over his head.
“We’ll find one, we’ll find a way to keep Dean happy.” Sam felt confident as he said this. “We always do,” he added, more to reassure himself than for Castiel’s benefit. “And so long as Dean’s happy, we can keep the peace. It’s been going so well, Cas.”
It was with some surprise that when Castiel opened the door to take receipt of his pizza he realized he knew the delivery driver.
Sure, he had Castiel's phone number, email address, and about everything else they could exchange, but Dean knew deep down it wouldn't be enough to rid him of this feeling of loss.
The reality of their lives struck again a couple of days later when they were finally back with their co-stars. The studio decided to split the groups into the humans and centauricorns for the press they had to do.
Castiel suspected the two of them were a couple and it made something in his brain twinge when he thought that through too much. He wasn’t going to debate the morality of the same being from different universes being in a relationship with each other. It just wasn’t worth the resulting migraine.
“I've just had a big shock and found out that my career as an actor is destined to be destroyed due to one lousy script choice. I probably need supervision in the shower.”
Well, at least Dean had the door shut this time. Sam had come to the bar not so long ago to find Dean out in the open at one of the stools, fucking himself on a dildo, watching porn. Though with the technology of the day, he wasn’t just watching, he was part of the scene, feeling the sensations. Sensors worn on the skin tricked the nervous system into feeling like it was part of the experience that was happening before the wearer’s eyes.
Sam excused himself to the bathroom after. He looked in the mirror while washing his hands and noticed he was smiling.
Sam was frozen. Confused more than anything as to why Castiel seemed so determined to get a reaction from Dean.
“They hired Chuck knowing he'd become a drunken mess, so they could get rid of him and pretend all the script difficulties were the mistake of multiple people?”
Castiel watched Dean for a moment before slipping on his own pair of sound-proof headphones and pressing play on his phone. Audiobooks and lying besides Dean might not have been a normal way to spend an evening together, but they were nowhere near the definition of normal and Castiel needed something to do all night. The lights being off stopped him from reading research volumes, which he’d come to decide was really a blessing.
“This has to be about $2 worth of lube here, Dean.” Castiel had poured a good amount over his fingers, so much so that they were dripping. He moved so he had better leverage to properly finger fuck Dean. He inserted his middle finger first, straight in, right up to the second knuckle.
Jack was crying and red faced when Castiel reached him. “Oh, Jack!” Castiel tried not to panic. Jack had been fine only 20 minutes ago when he’d gone to bed though. “Is it a virus?” Castiel asked Dean. “Should I get an ambulance?”
“You’re never homeless so long as I got a roof over my head, okay? Stop being a Crying Clara and let’s get this show on the road.”
“You’re the one who keeps,” Castiel swiveled his hips to just the right spot making both of them sigh happily, “who keeps bringing up my father.”
Eons past, Sam would have just dragged Dean out on a hunt. Got his mind out of the spiral of self-destructive actions that way, by reminding him what they were doing it all for. They were long beyond that, for too many reasons now.
But there she was in front of him, the woman from his dreams. The woman he'd been dreaming of for weeks now.
As the days turned to weeks, and to months, Dean and Castiel did what they could. They learned about each others’ bodies as best they could until such a time that Dean was finally healed and Castiel was back to his most recent definition of normal for himself.
Dean rolled his eyes and slumped back on his bed, regretting ever answering the phone. If he angled his body just right the phone would stay in place over his ear and he wouldn't have to hold it and expand even more energy on this conversation.
With his family around him, laughing, getting along, he felt like he could achieve anything, even the next few weeks of doing international press for a movie he didn't understand.
“No hitch on my car though. Can I take yours?” Sam picked up the note of hesitance in Dean’s voice. Almost like he didn’t think Sam would say yes.
Castiel stalled suddenly. “Um, are you okay with dirty talk?” He'd gone back to his normal voice instead of the sultry tones he'd been using.
“I started working there as a waiter as a gig between acting jobs. But I soon got good at the cooking. Fast forward to 25 years later and I still do a few bit parts here and there, but my main job is the restaurant. I don't ever wanna give her up now. My wife runs it by herself if I have to be away. Great lady. She looks after the kids by herself too.” Benny got his phone out to show them all photos of his beautiful children and gorgeous wife, smiling proudly as he waved the phone under all their noses.
“You work really hard too, Mr. Cas. You go at it harder than anyone I’ve ever met. Always up in that office of yours, pushing yourself. Anyway, I need to get to my next delivery. See you soon!”
“Sure, sure, Sammy, that’s…” Dean trailed off. He was looking at the mirror on the bedroom wall. His mirror, he supposed, in his new bedroom.
Sam grabbed a section of his own hair, ruffling it. It took a few deep breaths before he could get out the question that had been haunting him.
We the undersigned demand to see Sam Winchester given his own chance to shine as a shirtless, horse-human-unicorn hybrid with his rock-solid man meat on show. His beautiful chestnut hair dancing in the wind as he gallops across fields...
Dean breath was labored, tendons and muscles taught. The position he was holding himself in couldn’t be comfortable, but Castiel wasn’t done teasing his lover just yet.
“I don’t,” Castiel huffed. He did. He often did. He worried sometimes that he’d corrupted Dean and Dean had to remind him that being in a happy, healthy relationship, having the career of his dreams, and getting to sleep each night next to a man he loved was never going to be a dictionary definition of corrupted.
“We need to break this door down,” Sam told them, while he took a few steps back. “We have to get mom and get out of here!”
“They like being told they’re doing excellent work by you, Sammy,” Dean pointed out, knowing that feeling all too well.
“Tell them what you told me,” Claire pointed the taser baton at the guy, finger over the button that turned on the electric pulse. He whimpered and tried to squirm away. The tight knots around his torso attaching him to the back of the bolted-down chair stopped any chance of that though.
So that was why Castiel smelled familiar, it was the same smokey, rich fragrance that Dean had detected on the shirt. It also explained why Dean was the only one dressed so casually.
Dean had a nice butt, a good juicy handful with plenty of jiggle. Castiel had taken a moment to stroke it before he started with warm up spanks, just five to each cheek. The way Dean had gasped and panted let Castiel know he was doing right by his boy.
Yeah, it sucked how much he missed Jess. And it sucked that their engagement was over and he’d effectively thrown away the life he’d spent so many years building, but being in the bar with Dean felt
“Well, he was this big, strong, handsome soldier and he was so kind and sweet too. Made sense more than one girl had caught his eye. He had the ring, if it wasn’t me it was someone else.”
Dean groaned. “Lots of us were there for the dinner. It was a farewell from the studio to all the cast and crew, basically a wrap party.”
“What about chocolates?” Castiel asked, having no one else to get advice from. The twins could be surprisingly insightful at times.
“I've been spending some time with one of the guys I shot the film with. But he had to leave today for Europe.”
At last Sam climbed onto the bed to join Castiel. For the first time since they’d met Sam detected a hint of hesitance in Castiel’s look, just a moment where Castiel’s gaze dropped.
“That’s the sweet spot,” confirmed Dean, although no one in the room really needed verbal confirmation when it was clear to see from Dean’s huffy breaths his prostate was finally getting involved.
“A little of both? I need to hit the shower.” Sam pointed towards the closed bathroom door and slinked off to the sound of Dean laughing.
Dean writhed and moaned as Castiel continued to play, twisting his fingers around, pulling slightly, caressing Dean on the inside. He could feel the lube slip down and coat his thighs, but couldn't bring himself to care.
“We should go somewhere more private,” Castiel suggested while he rotated his hips into Dean’s. Pelvis to pelvis, almost nose to nose. Everyone but them was out for now, but neither knew how long that would last. As long as saving the world took, in theory.
“Greetings! I'm Bela Talbot, and on behalf of Crossroads productions, I'd like to welcome you all. We're just
Maybe they were arrogant, maybe they’d been through so much trauma that they just didn’t see barriers anymore, maybe they truly were all-powerful. But Sam was King of Hell and if that didn’t mean anything, if that didn’t prove they were more than they used to be, then what did? Maybe, just maybe, an angel, the King of Hell, some witches and a couple of hunters could find portals to enough alternative universes to convince some angels to come back with them, to help
Dean finished drying the glass he’d been holding and manoeuvred it under the beer tap. Frothy beer poured out, and Dean nodded to himself, always impressed at just how great he was at pulling.
“He’s always so out of control and beautiful when he comes,” one of the Castiels said. The others voiced their agreement readily.
Castiel recounted the story for Sam this time while Dean eyed up his brother. Sam seemed to be in a tequila sort of mood. Which probably meant Dean should be serving him water, and Sam would settle for beer. He poured and mixed the final drink and presented Sam with a–
“So,” Dean started, slowly connecting the dots. “So she offers you a few week's of work. In exchange you pretend you're some bizarre new actor the production company has just discovered who only goes by one name. But she gets you the funds to help your charity?”
“No, maybe? Guh, can you clone yourself so you can do this all at once? I really want you to come on my chest”
The real draw for Dean was that his co-star was to be a veteran of the action-adventure genre, Anna Milton. There was absolutely no way he could turn down working with her and not regret it.
It was a conversation they should have had a long time ago, if Castiel was being honest with himself.
“Ex-flyboy. I’m not able to fly an aircraft any longer.” Castiel looked into his empty glass and Sam felt his heart squeeze for the look of upset that flashed on Castiel’s face. Clearly there was more to that story.
“It turned out to be a simple fix. Somehow a group of children had gotten hold of a time changing device and were using it to enter shut buildings, travel back a few hours to when they were closed, taking what they wanted, and then traveling back to their original time, with the items.”
I have never been a fan of Dean Winchester's work, but he has at last come into his own propped up by a strong ensemble cast. His co-stars all give exceptionally strong performances, especially, for my money, Jody Mills as the human centauricorn hunter who convinces the other humans of their wrong-doings.
“I cannot wait to be done with this crazy place,” Jody told Donna and Dean in hushed tones later, as if this was news to them. “And away from that creep,” she nodded in Bela's direction.
That shouldn’t have made Castiel’s cock twitch like it did, but he realized over the years he had less control over his body than he used to assume.
“You deserve to be used so well. You deserve to know what it is like to serve so many men at once, to have their cum pour over you and be rubbed into your skin.”
“If no one else will ever hire me again, will you?” Dean asked coquettishly, fluttering his lashes at Castiel.
It was interesting hearing his mom’s side of things, Sam thought. It wasn’t how he would have described their dad. Especially not towards the end.
“What?” Dean frowned. “Uh, since never? There’s only  room for one fuck up in this family and that’s clearly me, so stop trying to steal my sunshine.”
"Oh, um, yeah. I saw your post about it and thought why not?" Dean laughed self-consciously. "I won't be offended if you don't let me have the job, Mr. Cas. I'm sure other people have heaps more experience."
His eyes were scrunched up and tears were seeping out. He could feel them trickle down his face, even if his consciousness was barely registering what was happening. He just wanted to indulge in the sensation of Castiel in him, filling him, making him
Dean didn't dare turn around least his expression of amazement give away to the assembled audience just how many lies Castiel was currently telling.
Before too long Castiel was packing up his stuff again. The hotel had kindly laundered all his clothes so he was ready to go.
They sat in companionable silence and waited for Dean to come out of his back office. When he finally did, his pupils were pinpoints and he was walking with a hefty limp.
“Hell no!” Dean laughed. “Like I said, I just wanted to get out of school early. And, well,” he paused, feeling embarrassed all over again. “I had had the total hots for Harrison Ford. Though at the time I didn't realize that's what the feelings were. I just thought he was so
“Did people really use to drink this?” The kid looked up at Dean with great disgust. “Three thousand dollars for a genuine-recipe 21st century beer, and it’s
“I... um, thanks,” Dean stuttered, 20 minutes later when the whole thing was finished. They were standing in the area behind the stage again, all congregating and getting to know each other.
It wasn’t until near the end of the dinner that Sam and Castiel were left to themselves while both of the other Winchesters went to the restroom.
The less selfish version of Castiel would just let Dean go. Let him go do what he wanted so badly to do. The irony of this being Castiel was already the least selfish person Dean knew.
“I'd love to hear more, I'm sure you two got into a lot of trouble. We're going to be spending a lot of time together in a few months promoting this film, so why not get to know each other, right?”
Dean slammed the door to his back office and sank down into the desk chair, head resting in his hands as he tried his best not to smash up the office or cry.
Sam’s arms felt heavy and he was colder, hungrier, and itchier than he’d ever been in his entire life.
“If you think he feels good when you fuck him, wait until you’ve fucked him after a few other dicks have been inside,” Castiel Nine said to Castiel One.
“Winchesters aren’t the only ones who can come back,” she said coyly. “Don’t think I crawled out of hell just to rescue your ass.”
Dean led Castiel into the living area and sat down on the sofa. Castiel sat down at the opposite end.
Gadreel sat in contemplation for a moment, one hand clenched around the ever-present locket he never took off. One time Castiel had accidentally seen inside and found there to be a photo of Sam. He’d never pried what had happened between the two of them, but there was no doubting the devotion in Gadreel’s eyes when he looked upon this universe’s Sam. The self-conscious way he tugged his vessel’s clothes up across his throat to hide the scars that never seemed to settle from their vicious, raised streaks of pain.
“No, I was just born there, but my parents moved on a few months later. They're artists, so we moved around a lot. They were always looking for inspiration to create new things.”
. Turned out they'd been looking to cast one boy for the film, and despite everything they tried, had failed to find the right kid. When they ran out of agency kids, someone had the thought of looking in the schools local to where they were hoping to film – so we'd have the right kinda accent. But after seeing me and Sam, they realized the issue wasn't in casting the boy, the issue was casting just
“Another tonic water would be nice,” Sam stuttered. “And… feel free to sit. I’m not great company but,” he looked the man up and down, “I wouldn’t mind someone to talk to.”
“I’m Castiel, and yes, that is my real name.” Castiel called the bartender over and ordered them both tonic waters with lime.
“Ya know, you’re my last delivery of the night,” Dean let on one evening seven weeks on. The pizza obsession had died down to twice a week, but only through pure will power and regular yoga sessions.
“Yes?” Castiel paused, dirty coffee cup in hand, wondering what was so important Dean would come back when he was already running late.
“It still might be,” Castiel explained. “Critical success doesn't mean commercial – and they did spend
“My roommate is pretty much the same. Harrison Ford for days, if he could.” He felt compelled to keep saying roommate. Even though he’d admitted to Castiel he was between jobs, it made him feel bad to then add ‘And sleeping in my brother’s spare room for free because I’m having a faux midlife crisis’.
Castiel brushed a thumb over Dean’s lips, rubbing the small amount of cum left around Dean’s lips into his skin as if it was lip balm.
The virtual fantasies Dean had become accustomed too could trick his brain into feeling this sort of pain, but the technology of the day still wasn’t good enough to leave behind the physical marks Castiel could inflict on him. And beyond self-flagellation, Castiel was Dean’s best chance of feeling like this.
They all found themselves thankful they had a nurse in the family now to give advice on recovery. A nurse who had done a lot of extra reading, research, and discussing enough hypothetical with a resident at her hospital that Alex had said she worried they probably thought she was planning to put someone into a coma, not help them from coming out of one.
Stepping back from where Dean was still bound to the tree, Castiel studied the unmarked side of Dean’s buttocks.
Benny stood up and followed Donna off to the bar. “She's gotta point, we are here to celebrate together.”
Dean's family were arriving at the hotel mid-afternoon so they could catch up before the film premiere later. Only Sam knew that Dean was bringing Castiel along with him. If Dean was being honest with himself, he was a little tense about introducing a special someone to his parents for the first time.
“Dean, you know you have to be quieter than that,” Castiel tutted and kissed Dean deeply on the mouth. “You don’t want Sam complaining again.”
“Yeah, no problem. The keys are on the table by the door.” The table that was destined for Goodwill since neither he nor Jess were attached to it. It was a strange feeling knowing that today would be the last day he’d see that table.
is the official term,” Bela cut in. “We need a trademarkable character. I need you to all get into the habit of calling the creatures this as early as possible.”
“I’m a paramedic. Now I help people instead of just...” Castiel trailed off and finished up the last of his drink. “Well, you know, hurt people.”
In the state he’d been in since his breakup with Jessica, Sam wasn’t sure how he’d even handle holding down a new job. It seemed like an impossible mountain to climb. Which was only part of why he didn’t feel more excited when he saw the email inviting him back for a second job interview on Monday.
goes against every moral code I have going. Especially when the means for it are well within our grasp. And besides, the relic only brings people back for three hours before they snap back to the time they’d been in previously. No one is going to get stuck here, it'll be safe.”
“And everyone saying we fell in love while filming this? I didn't even meet you until after!” Dean couldn't stop laughing. The whole thing was so absurd, but he felt so much relief that the feedback was middling to good for the most part.
“What do you want me to say, Sam? You were engaged for over ten years with no wedding. Clearly things weren’t all that great.”
Considering their sons had brought in millions of dollars at the movie box office, no one would ever suspect that John and Mary Winchester were anything but normal folk. Other than the one room they had that contained a big merchandise collection from the movies their sons had been in, their house was otherwise pretty normal.
“Brunet,” Sam said begrudgingly. “How about you? Not heard about anyone since Carmen.” What was the point in being a little brother if you couldn’t annoy your older brother?
“Tomorrow afternoon. Jess is coming by tonight to check through anything else left, she said she’d clean a bit since she took the vacuum with her to her new place, and then tomorrow she’ll sign the final paperwork. I just need to drop off the stuff for Goodwill and I’m done.”
“So. Castiel, the question everyone is dying to know the answer to is...” Donna started tapping the table top in poor mimicry of a drum roll. “How does a guy with no film experience, land the lead role in one of the biggest Hollywood films of all time?”
The manuscript had taken twice as long to write since he kept having to stop to deal with not-so-little Cas.
“Look!” Jack threw down the rest of the wrapping paper and held up the largest gummy bear Castiel had ever seen.
Castiel stretched to grab the lube from under a pillow, where it had rolled to after their session that morning.
On the wrong day, when he was in a bad way, Dean would probably find a way to sacrifice himself for a cat stuck in a tree. Not that Sam was in a position to really judge.
love you.” Castiel shot Dean a scathing look and went back to rearranging the cards in his hand in some order known only to himself.
“We need to get you out of here. Alex borrowed some wheelchairs from the hospital we’re going to have to use to take you back, your muscles must be made of jello right now from all the relaxant he was feeding you.”
“I don’t wish to impose. I would still be happy to buy you that drink, and then I will leave you alone.” When Sam still didn’t talk the stranger took a step away. “My apologies, I have–”
“But I feel with each year, he’s growing closer to doing something he and us will regret. The garden was an amazing idea. He’s tended to it well, and it’s so peaceful and beautiful there. The playroom? Also inspired. I’ve enjoyed getting to learn this side of Dean more than I can word, however…”
Castiel gently pulled out. He wiped the left over cum and lube on his cock onto his palm and used it to ease his way through working Dean to orgasm too. The dream world had certainly left Castiel with a lot of ideas Dean wouldn’t have thought Castiel could have ever of come up with.
Sam and Castiel stood there, Billie behind them looking bored, but his guys? His family? They looked so hopeful. Dean prodded at his eyes in the mirror. “You couldn’t have given me a body before my crows feet, could ya?”
“Just because I have wings, does not mean I lay eggs!” Castiel shouted after him, also running in that direction.
“Just Sam,” he laughed, unsure if Castiel was being serious. Sam found himself thinking that he couldn’t seriously be contemplating sex with a man who he didn’t even want to give his name to, could he?
Castiel Ten pulled out slightly just as he came, ensuring his offering landed mostly in Dean’s mouth across his tongue.
“Perfect with you,” Dean cried out as his back arched and his cock twitched again and come dribbled out. It wasn’t a lot of come, much to Castiel’s sadness, but then again, Dean had come last only a few hours earlier.
Truthfully, he was just ad-libbing what Sam had told him when Dean called him in a state after the first day of filming with the same fears as Donna.
“A bit, I've been able to stage a few productions now. Nothing big, of course, but fairly well received so far.”
“I love you,” Dean stated simply. “Have done for like, a long, long time. And I love your kids. And...” Dean surveyed the room around them. His gaze fond as he looked over the items of his own which had somehow migrated their way to Castiel’s bedroom. “If you're a dork, I'm a mega dork. And yeah,” Dean shrugged as if it was all that easy.
“So, is he going to be back next week?” Sam heard Donna asking Dean as he walked back towards the dining room.
“Good,” Dean settled on, cocking an eyebrow. “Because I do too, love you, am in love with you, I mean. So...” his voice wavered a little, fear, excitement,
When he finally forced himself to get out of bed it was if he’d contracted flu overnight. Everything hurt and his brain was fogged over. Sunlight beamed in through the flimsy curtains of Dean’s spare room by the time Sam convinced himself to leave the bedroom. Water, he hoped, would at least make him feel somewhat human again. He grabbed a chilled bottle from the fridge and downed half of it with the refrigerator door still open.
“Heartbreak? Indecision?” The overwhelming feeling that he’d fucked up his life and was too terrified to start again?
Sam was aware though that he’d only been living with Dean for just over a week and already learned more about his brother than he had in the past ten years combined.
The press had shouted for the men to come back, but instead they chose to walk hand-in-hand into the theater.
He seemed to Sam to be enjoying their forced convalescence while the others fought the druids pent on ending the world. With their muscle weakness as it was, they’d agreed it was safer if they stayed back. Three days from being woken up even Castiel was not fully back to his normal self.
“Was it hard, being a half horse thing?” Donna asked. “I wish we'd gotten to see what you guys were up to.”
, he told himself firmly. He had a new novel due with his editor by the end of the week and still had half the porn scenes to write. He liked saving them until last though, when all the boring plotty elements were done and dusted.
Dean clenched his buttocks up, putting pressure on the four fingers Castiel still had in him. “You make me really happy.”
Sam felt treasured, and hot, and confused, but aroused, so very, very aroused. It was like Castiel was all around him, inside him, presence seeping into Sam’s brain and making him demand:
It took Sam a long time to fall asleep that night. Memories of his dad floated across his mind whenever he shut his eyes. Of his laugh, of his moods, of how protected Sam felt when he was around, of his shouting. To Sam’s young self, John was always angry and Sam never knew why. As an adult Sam also could see his father had been sad and anxious so much of the time too.
“Humm.” He thought about it a moment. Something didn't add up. “I don’t really care right now. Future us will sort whatever it is out. I know we will. Ten sounds like a good number to me, my heart tells me that’s why we stop at ten. And I know myself, if I was really that worried in the future I would have said something at the start Dean, to the other Castiels too.”
They sat in the living room area of Dean's suite at the table in there so they could eat and continue talking.
“Well, you know,” Sam shrugged. “I got lucky with grants and all.” He felt like a fraud accepting praise for a career he didn’t think he was really looking to hold onto.
“I know that, but if I have a chance to say something I have to take it. I’m worried what is about to happen next week,” he took a shuddering breath. “I haven’t seen my Dean in two weeks and I miss him.
“Thanks. You’re really good with them.” Dean was so close Castiel could see even the faintest of Dean’s freckles.
With no completed script due to their writer's ever increasing dependence on alcohol, no lead actress, and no director, Dean thought perhaps the film would fall through.
“I agree,” Kevin sighed, hanging his head with shame. “It was that or they were going to kill the movie. Death was hanging around the set you see–”
“Those fuckers,” Chuck mumbled, reaching into the bag at his feet and pulling out another bottle. He took a long draw straight from the bottle.
“If we all eat burgers, we all gain the same, and then there'll be no difference on the camera,” Jody reasoned.
Castiel re-positioned himself again. Running his hands along Dean's back again, and then over his ass and down his thighs.
, I know I've been drinking, but that has to be the alcohol talking, Cas. That makes no sense at all.”
The three actors invited their new writer to lunch one afternoon to find out all the on-set gossip. Kevin had explained how he'd had to tweaked the plot in light of the new actor, Castiel, and then apologized to the three for the time he'd added to the filming schedule in doing this.
Dean’s hands stalled for a brief moment. Yeah, the disappointment still hurt, but he wasn’t going to let it ruin the time he did get to spend with Cas or Sam. They were always apologetic, but it was never of any comfort to Dean.
“Hi! I didn't know we were allowed to interrupt this private meeting,” Donna giggled as she dropped into the last remaining seat at the booth, right next to Dean. “You two have had your heads firmly together since we got here though. Time to share!” She giggled some more.
He knew he should have been happy about the fact he was likely going to get the job, if their reaction was anything to go by. He had the credentials and knew he’d impressed at least Talbot with his knowledge of their clients. Feeling down over his success, Sam stopped at the first decent looking bar he could find on his drive back to Dean’s house. Aware of the fact he had to drive back and not feeling keen on having to call a cab to get home, Sam ordered a tonic water.
“It was... a new experience for me too,” Castiel said forlornly. “Much different to anything I've done before.”
“He,” Claire kicked the man’s already prone leg, “said it was something to do with adding to you all going along with it. If you were separated, you woke up. Each time you woke up he just put you back under with new situations. The last one went on for a few weeks, apparently the longest. I got really close one time to finding you all, so he moved you.”
This wasn’t something they’d spoken of in many years. Their agreement that to keep the universe whole, they’d have to continue to give up their time on Earth and their time with Dean. And Dean would have to give up everything else.
“You have no proof of that!” Dean chimed in, knowing he wasn’t going to win this race but not caring either way as he too took off for the ladder.
The baton was something Sam recognized as normally being used in electrostim play, but he wasn’t going to bring that up right now. Claire seemed pretty relaxed with it in her hand.
Dean was on his knees in front of Castiel, mouth currently wrapped around Castiel's erection, fisting the base with his left hand, while his right hand rolled Castiel's balls and stroked along his taint every now and then.
“I lived in Norway for a few weeks,” Castiel told Dean, just before he bit into a freshly baked, still warm breakfast muffin.
“It’s a neutral space,” Sam said at the time, with what exuberance he could gather together in a situation that involved his dying brother. “A truly neutral space. For Heaven, Hell, and anything in between.”
Since none of them still knew the movie ending or really the plot in general, they had to distract reporters trying to ask them about the film with other stories. Donna also talked about a new TV show she was on – something that made Dean feel very relieved to hear about. At least one of the other actors involved would get out of this mess alright.
“Being a child actor ain't so hard. At that age, all you know is how to do is be a kid, so you learn your lines and that's about it. As I got older, I had to really work at it more. But that world was pretty much the last eleven years of my life in total. So here I am, aged 22, after playing a teenager for way too–”
“Was my subconscious telling me Jess and I wouldn’t have worked out?” The thought had been on his mind constantly. He had to voice it, had to reach out or it was going to consume him.
“No, I mean, maybe?” Sam whined. “I didn’t want kids,” he blurted. “She did. Somehow we’d never discussed it and then it came up and...”
“I understood that, but I just wasn’t sure about how effective spanking was for… that kind of thing. That people could really, you know, from spanking.”
Please may the earth open and swallow me whole, Dean silently begged. Putting on his most shit-eating grin, he answered: “It was a different experience without him around, but my co-stars really made me feel welcome. Not family in the biological sense this time, but family nonetheless.”
The light around her was so intense. He wanted to lift his hand to shade his eyes. He couldn’t though, he couldn’t seem to move anything below his shoulders.
The couch was comfortable and safe. The couch didn’t expect Sam to figure out his life. The couch did hurt his back a little, but that might have had more to do with the three hours he’d spent in the same prone position.
Sam wanted to ask ‘so what’, but didn’t dare. There was no other way, no hope, no choice but to keep going as they had. Eternity was a long time, sure, but things were okay, things were
Castiel’s next book series was all about an errant college boy who seduced the lonely man he sometimes did odd jobs for. The college boy grew up in later books, graduated, went to grad school, and eventually became an English lit assistant professor in his own right, on a tenure track.
“It doesn’t really matter when I come back, whenever I come back will be the time I came back today.”
“Did they literally just give the editing team a bunch of drugs before they put it together?” he asked Castiel.
“They are. Been like family to me. No one looked down on me when I joined as a recruit, way older than the others. Jody she...” Dean paused as he concentrated on merging at the intersection, “she lost her kid when he was young.”
They both chuckled and Sam could feel the tension from his shoulders dissipating little by little. Even if he and Castiel weren’t destined to be, he’d enjoyed the experience.
“Learning to fish, weirdly,” Castiel chuckled. “I wanted to learn from the best. Give a man a fish, he eats for a day.”
When time came, Castiel Two gave his goodbyes before he was yanked out of their timeline, copper tea kettle device in hand. Three followed and then the others all in order too until only Castiel Ten remained, having arrived slightly after the others originally.
“Nowhere in particular to be. You want to get breakfast? If that’s… not too much for a one night stand?” Sam winced as he said it. Castiel wasn’t easy too read and he didn’t want to scare the other man off.
Sam swallowed, his face feeling flush. “Cool,” he said lamely. “Er, do you want me to… keep going?” he nodded at Castiel’s cock.
“I knew it!” Benny shouted, slamming his hands on the table. A moment later he looked bashful at his own enthusiasm.
His voice was level and calm, but his body was tense, like he was prepared for a physical at attack any moment.
Castiel lifted his hand and brought it down again, hearing, feeling, experiencing the crack of his palm on Dean’s behind.
Sam rolled his eyes and went back to packing. He was nearly done now. Jess had made it easier on him by already taking her stuff while he’d been away. While he’d been hiding at the office under the cover that he’d needed to tie up loose ends on all his cases.
Castiel later helped Dean to bed when Dean was at the point of falling over thin air and needed someone to take care of him. He’d probably needed someone to take care of him for a lot longer than they were willing to admit.
Dean was dressed in his normal khaki shorts, baseball cap on, framing his delicately freckled skin and plump lips.
It was a wink Dean was starting to grow irritated with as it usually meant Gabriel was lying about something, such as “We just need
He'd be lying if he said that was the first night he'd spent drifting off while contemplating what life after the bar would be like. Wondering about the consequences of selling up and leaving, or just… leaving. Drop it all. Stop caring about inventory and bills, go back to his pre-having to care about tax life.
“Why do you like this?” he had to ask, had to understand so he could do better by Dean in the future.
“This is not my fault,” Chuck spat back, putting his palms out towards her while shaking his hands and head. “Not. My. Fault.
“Theater actor. We needed someone solid. I guess he knows someone. But the stuff I saw him shoot the other week, he did look great. And because he's used to theater, he gets it right on the first take nearly every time. Saving us a lot of time, I can tell you.”
Dean took Castiel’s hand in his and squeezed it gently. They smiled at each other, and Dean had to stop himself from leaning in to kiss Castiel again. They’d had their session for the day, now it was time to tend to the garden.
The lube left on his hand from fingering Dean earlier was almost dry or wiped off elsewhere now, but that didn't seem to matter as Dean somehow managed to rock up into Castiel's fist and down onto Castiel's cock all at once. Dean marveled at the friction Castiel's nearly lube-less hand provided.
“Oh.” Dean felt so downhearted. Though he was sure part of him knew this little bubble he'd been existing in with Castiel the last 24 hours couldn't continue indefinitely.
“Well, then you know why he does that. It’s them acting out their passion, love, and mutual interested in a visceral way. Both get pleasure from the act, both agreed to the act.”
, he thought, burying his face into his pillow, crying, emotions swirling. He wasn’t feeling numb at least. Guilt  was coursing through his veins making his chest feel icy cold.
Castiel breathed in a controlled way that put Sam in mind of yoga. His abdomen muscles tensed as he tried to stop himself squirming. “Don’t sell yourself short, Sam. Just because you’re in a motel sucking a stranger’s dick doesn’t mean–”
agent had been smart enough to know that clauses for events such as this were required. Dean's agent and lawyer, meanwhile, had only ever had to deal with his movie franchise contracts in the past, and they'd all been mostly standard after the first film.
So while Anna and a few other people had managed to get themselves out, Dean was stuck. Garth, Benny, and two actress he'd never worked with before, Donna Hanscum and Jody Mills, and himself were all that remained from the original cast of ten.
“Is this okay?” Castiel Five breathed into Dean’s ear, quiet and oh so very earnest. “Is this everything you wanted?”
“You just need to what? Keep things going for a few more years? It’s been long enough, Sam. You should let go, spend more time with us, here.”
Dean was still nodding as Castiel finally came, spraying thick, creamy ropes of come and painting up Dean’s lightly freckled chest, just as he’d promised. Castiel slid sideways after so he could gather up Dean into a hug. They were both a mess, and both the happier for it.
Sam nodded his head, agreeing but not really feeling it. He felt all sorts of numb, if he had to put a word to it.
Garth, a major role in the second half of the film, and an actor Dean was curious to get to know spoke up next. “Meaning what exactly? I was wondering that, the schedule says I'm to be... waxed... below?”
Castiel borrowed some of Dean's body wash and thought with a thrill of happiness how he'd smell like Dean.
Castiel sighed. “I really am a playwright mostly, with some acting. But more than anything, what I want to do is go back to my charity work. I help
“It never mattered much to me either way, the concept of being with someone didn’t appeal. And then,” Castiel sighed, “then I fell.”
Jody grinned wickedly. “Considering how much we've drank tonight, I think some burgers are called for.”
“I’m in love with my best friend,” Castiel offered up, sitting himself down next to Sam. “We sound like two peas in a pod.”
“The world is at peace, and we’ve destined ourselves to be miserable forever to achieve and maintain the status quo.”
Dean made a strange gurgle sound and Castiel knew he was torn between feeling this as a punishment as it meant no sucking cock later, and a reward as it meant Castiel would be restricting his breathing somewhat.
Dean shrugged. “Even if I don’t, what’s gonna happen? I can’t die,” he chuckled. “So long as I stay in here, it doesn’t matter.”
A good ten minutes of his time at the superstore had been lost to going through the types of chips they had. Instinct had been to grab sour cream Lay’s as they’d been Jess’ favorite. But Sam didn’t have to shop for her any longer. Wouldn’t ever have to shop for her again. He grabbed Cool Ranch Doritos instead, which had been his dad’s favorites. For good measure he included some Ruffles too. A few bottles of beer from Free State Brewing Company went in next. That certainly hadn’t been available in stores when his dad had been alive still. Though whether John would have been happy at not having an excuse to go to the brewery direct for his beer anymore Sam wasn’t sure.
“I have to get some stuff packed to go. But if you're happy to run errands with me, I'd love to spend what time I can with you.”
“That’s… that’s...” Dean sat down on the couch behind him. He looked up at the still standing Sam and Castiel. “That can’t be true.”
,” Kevin explained. “He's some higher up at the studio. Apparently if he's on your set observing, that means you're close to being finished. The film's already massively over budget.” Looking around Donna's trailer as if a thinking a hidden executive might jump out, he continued in hushed tones: “They think Chuck will sue if they don't finish the picture.”
“I’m not a one-time thing kind of person, Dean,” Castiel let him know, while he gently massaged the back of Dean’s left thigh, and then his right. “I wouldn’t want you seeing someone else either.”
, actually discuss their problems instead of things ending in a bloodbath. We’ve found a way to finally piece together the last of the plan,” Sam explained in a hurry, looking so proud of himself.
Bobby looked between Castiel and Dean, eyes taking in everything before him and the personal objects strewn around the room.
“We can vote you in, Castiel, and then vote again at a later date a few centuries from now? That was how they dealt with most of the humans’ politics in my universe.” He frowned momentarily at that, reflecting on some memory Castiel was never going to be able to fully appreciate. There was no way for any of them to fully appreciate the universes each other had come from.
“Sure. Where do you wanna go?” Castiel looked around for his shoes. Not even slightly sure when he took those off. They could be anywhere in the suite of rooms Dean was occupying.
With thanks again to the wonderfully talented artist I had the pleasure of working with through this
“We have a couple of whizkids working for us to take lead on all of that, top of the line workers, revolutionary techniques. None of you have anything to worry about. We expect the film to be completed and ready within the next six months. I expect to see you all at the premiere in November.”
Castiel had been around a lot more recently, almost constantly. Dean was feeling the happy hum of having him around so much, even though he did still miss seeing his brother frequently.
“Sweetheart...” Castiel rearranged them so Dean was now sat on Castiel’s cum-slicked lap. He cradled Dean’s head to his shoulder. “It’s okay, you must have wanted this for a very long time.”
“And if I want it to change?” Dean moved a touch closer. “What if I don’t want to spend any more time feeling like I’m wasting an opportunity?”
“Everything will be fine,” chirped up the ever unflappable Bela. “We're going to film the three endings we have, and then decide after what works best.”
A couple of weeks before Dean had started doing his yard work too, Castiel had been in a bind trying to decide the sexiest job for his protagonist to have. Castiel’s mind had gone through the mill many times before he’d put the question to Dean.
“Because I've been wanting to kiss you all day, since after the press conference, and knew I couldn't without revealing all this. But more than that, because after I'd been talking with you, I realized I wanted to get to know you beyond kissing, Dean. And I couldn't enter into anything knowing I was lying to you.”
Sam saw the pride and fear in Jody’s eyes as she said this. Claire was growing up, was grown up. It was hard in Sam’s head –and he knew Dean’s too – to consider Claire out there doing what she did. But they’d been in the same position at her age.
“That?” Dean cocked an eyebrow. Even with Dean’s experience of magical items, it was hard to believe something so simplistic could really have so much power. He leaned in closer and went to pick it up. “Looks pretty inno–”
Castiel pulled a length of willow off the tree and swished it around in the air. He could see the muscles in Dean’s back tense when he heard the sound. Under the hood Dean was now wearing, Castiel was sure Dean was probably grinning with happiness and anticipation of the willow.
“Then maybe I can show you after I blow you.” Sam smiled at Castiel and lifted his glass up to finish up the last of the watery ice. He wasn’t sure where his sudden burst of courage had come from, certainly not the drink. But it was there, and his mouth was watering at the thought of sucking dick again for the first time since he was a freshman.
